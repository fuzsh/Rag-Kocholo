These tiny treasures have been captivating hearts for centuries, combining the elegance of craftsmanship with the simplicity of sound.\n\nYou’ve most likely seen it spelled both music boxes and musical boxes. Both are technically correct, depending on what kind of English you’re using. (Yes, English is a confusing language, and these differences are primarily political and geographical). Both are appropriate terms for these. The only difference is whether it’s US English or British English. A music box is American English, and a musical box is British English. A fun way to remember the difference is that the American spelling tends to have fewer letters.\n\nMusic Box Facts for You Funky Folks\n\nA trio of Persian brothers invented the earliest mechanical musical instrument in the 9th century, centuries before Switzerland created music boxes.\n\nThree brothers, the Banū Mūsā brothers, are a trio of Persian inventors based in Baghdad, Iraq. They produced the earliest known mechanical musical instrument. This is one of the many mechanical devices they wrote and illustrated in their book, “The Book of Ingenious Devices. This book’s title translates to “The Book of Tricks.” The book was a creation of the trio working at the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma) under the Abbasid Caliphate. The book describes about one hundred devices and how to use them. This musical device in question was, in this case, a hydro-powered organ which played interchangeable cylinders automatically (Book Of Ingenious Devices).\n\nAccording to Charles B. Fowler, this “cylinder with raised pins on the surface remained the basic device to produce and reproduce music mechanically until the second half of the nineteenth century” (The Museum Of Music: A History Of Mechanical Instruments)\n\nMusic Boxes as We Know Them Were Created in The Late 1700s In Switzerland.\n\nThough it is difficult to pinpoint the origination of the very first music box, historians agree that it was invented in the late 18th century (circa 1770) and was small enough to fit in a pocket watch by utilizing many of the techniques and concepts of watchmaking (Rau Antiques).\n\nThe first successful device to play a musical tune as a music box was invented in Switzerland around 1770 (Smithsonian)\n\nSwitzerland has a rich history of crafting intricate timepieces, celebrated for their precision and elegance. One of the country’s earliest breakthroughs came from the music box, first invented in 1770. Today, Switzerland remains a hub of artistic expression, with a diverse community of talented creators capturing the world’s attention, like Robin Wood, Charles Reuge, and many more (BBC).\n\nLouis Favre Is Known as The Father of The Swiss Cylinder Box.\n\nLouis Favre, working in Geneva in the early 18th century, became known as the father of the Swiss cylinder box. (New York Times 1987)\n\nLouis Favre was a watchmaker but, more notably, helped make music boxes a thriving industry throughout Europe. (John A. Pfirrmann)\n\nMusic Boxes Use Various Mechanisms Such as Cylinders, Disks, Combs, Springs, And Even Digital Technology.\n\nMusic boxes originally used cylinders to produce music. Early music boxes were designed to play music using flat metal prongs plucked by a revolving metal cylinder. Eventually, music box makers developed a flat disc to play the music. (Smithsonian)\n\nEvery music box holds a beautifully intricate mechanism. The main parts of this mechanism are a cylinder or disk, a comb, tunes, and a spring mechanism. Music boxes use cylinders or disks with pins to pluck a steel comb’s teeth, creating different musical notes. Each cylinder or disk has a unique pin configuration that plays a specific melody, limiting the music box to a restricted collection of tunes. (The Musical Box Society)\n\nDuring the late 19th century, music boxes changed from cylinders to discs, making them more convenient for storage and switching. In the late 1880s, Symphonion Musikwerke brought a revolution to the music box industry in Leipzig by introducing an interchangeable disk music box, which made it more convenient for customers. (Rau Antiques).\n\nLater, flat metal discs replaced cylinders, allowing for a wider range of tunes and greater complexity. These boxes were available in varied sizes, ranging from pocket watch sizes to larger ones with 96 steel teeth on the comb. (The Canadian Encyclopedia)\n\nThe spring mechanism is powered by a coiled spring that turns a key or, in more modern models, a winding knob. As the spring unwinds, it powers the movement and sound of the music box. (The Musical Box Society)\n\nMusic Boxes Used with Paper Allow for A High Degree of Customizability.\n\nModern music boxes allow you to compose your melodies by punching holes in a paper strip, adding an individualized touch to your music. Paper-fed music boxes are also much easier to customize for whatever you’d like. (Tabor Music Box)\n\nSome early music boxes used paper strips with punched holes to create melodies, like the principles of a player piano. ( The Canadian encyclopedia)\n\nDigitization has allowed for highly customized music boxes in today’s global music industry. With the advent of digitization, the music industry has witnessed a significant transformation, enabling the production of highly personalized music boxes that cater to the individual preferences of music enthusiasts worldwide. (The Music Box Attic)\n\nMusic Boxes Were Designed After Snuff Boxes.\n\nMusic and musical snuff boxes were grown from the idea of snuff boxes, which many Europeans favoured. Snuff boxes were small pocket-sized boxes that would carry tobacco. (Sandmark House).\n\nSnuff boxes are small and usually decorate snuff (a scented, powdered tobacco that folks in England would sniff or inhale. Snuffboxes reflected the art and craft of the painter of miniatures, the enameller, the jeweller, and the goldsmith and silversmith. (Britannica)\n\nHave you ever heard of the National Museum of American History’s rare and intriguing musical snuff box? This remarkable creation, believed to have been crafted by an unknown Swiss maker during the 1830s-1840s, boasts impressive features. The segmented comb, composed of 16 sections and adorned with four teeth each, can play two different tunes. The cylinder, measuring 2-15/32 inches in length, is activated by a critical wound spring, adding to its intricate design. Without a doubt, this musical snuff box is a captivating piece of history worth exploring. (National Museum of American History)\n\nMusic Boxes Were at The Height of Their Popularity in The Victorian Period.\n\n“At the height of the Victorian period, anyone of means had a music box,” says Morton Weiner, the owner of Morley Antiques in Bronxville and a specialist in antique music boxes. “The traditional setting was the parlour, but today, the collector may have them all over the house.” (Ann Barry, 1987)\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, music boxes were extensively produced in Switzerland and Germany, positioning the two countries as significant manufacturers of these intriguing devices. However, during the second half of the 19th century, music boxes peaked in popularity, captivating audiences worldwide with their melodious tunes and intricate designs. (The Canadian Encyclopedia)\n\n“The golden age of music boxes in America was from around the 1860s to about 1910,” Mrs. Bornand said. “The earliest types of music boxes were made in Switzerland in the late 1700s and early 1800s and were small, intricate pieces. As time passed, the mechanisms became even more complicated and elaborate, until by 1880, wealthy Americans were buying large furniture‐sized music boxes. The industry died, though, when the phonograph became popular.” (New York Times, 1979)\n\nMusic Boxes Have Been Created to Preserve the Artistry Not Only of The Music but Of the Craft Itself.\n\nMusic boxes are not only charming musically, but they are also beautiful works of art. They feature hand-painted scenes, intricate carvings, and precious gemstone accents, displaying the artistry of modern artists. The creation of music boxes began with the blend of small mechanics artistry, such as watchmaking, and the artistry of snuff boxes. Snuff boxes were small pocket-sized boxes used to carry tobacco of different sorts and flavours. (Sandmark House).\n\n“Music boxes bring you back,” Mrs. Bornand, the daughter-in-law of the late Joseph Bornand, a noted professional music box craftsman from Switzerland, said. “Remember, they were once the only kind of ‘player less’ music. The sound of a music box reminds people of past moments. I like it that I am preserving part of a way of life that is now gone, and I am proud to carry on the family name.” (New York Times, 1979)\n\nBetween 1752 and 1850, a group of skilled artisans collaborated to perfect the art of watchmaking. Goldsmiths, jewellers, enamellers, and miniaturists combined their expertise to push the limits of their craft. As their skills improved, they were able to produce more complex and more extensive devices, eventually leading to the creation of beautiful and captivating music boxes. (New York Times 1987)\n\nRecord Players Killed the Music Box Stars.\n\nFollowing the invention of the phonograph by Thomas Edison in 1877, music boxes gradually lost their popularity to recorded music. With the growing preference for record players, the demand for music boxes declined, and eventually, record players surpassed music boxes in popularity. (Collector’s Weekly)\n\nIn the years following, an exciting development appeared as the first record player was introduced to the public. This marked a groundbreaking shift in the accessibility and availability of music, as 1895 ushered in a new era for music lovers everywhere. The gramophone record player quickly gained popularity and became a beloved source of entertainment for many. However, the widespread adoption of radio soon eclipsed the gramophone’s influence, signalling yet another transformative moment in the history of music technology. (Electrohome)\n\nAs the 20th century began, the demand for musical entertainment shifted towards player pianos and phonographs, slowly phasing out the once-popular commercial music boxes. (Folkways)\n\nMusic Boxes Are Still Valuable Collectables.\n\nAlthough record players became more popular than music boxes, collectors have continued to hold antique and vintage music boxes in high esteem. These boxes are highly sought after and can fetch impressive prices at auctions, sometimes reaching several hundred thousand dollars. The rarity, historical significance, and intricate designs of antique music boxes all contribute to their value, making them highly desirable collectibles (Frankenmuth clock)\n\nWhether it’s a gift for a birthday, Christmas, or even to remind someone that you’re thinking of them, music boxes provide a sweet and straightforward musical gift. And frankly, there’s something for everyone out there. There’s a music box available for Disney nerds, horror lovers, children, art enthusiasts, couples, and even people who spend too much time on goth TikTok. (The Music Box Attic)\n\nReuge, Founded In 1865, Is the World Leader in Traditional and Luxury Music Boxes.\n\nReuge is one of the most prestigious and long-standing music box companies. With their unwavering determination, they have brought this art form into the 21st century. The brand blends innovative ideas with traditional craftsmanship to produce state-of-the-art music boxes using new materials, themes, and acoustics. Reuge’s ability to stir emotions through lifeless metal is mesmerizing, and their masterpieces remain highly coveted luxury items. (Reuge)\n\nReuge has evolved beyond traditional music boxes to remain relevant in today’s market. It’s a testament to how the art form of music boxes has expanded and diversified into items such as holiday designs, bells, photo frames, interactive contemporary music boxes, classic antique singing bird cages, and more. (Reuge)\n\nCharles Reuge founded the company in 1865, initially as a watchmaking enterprise. Despite numerous technological advancements in the music industry, including phonographs, radios, tapes, CDs, MTV, and Spotify, the company has focused on crafting music boxes. Through unwavering dedication, the company has continued producing these timeless treasures in a modest manufacturing facility in Sainte-Croix. The company is determined to safeguard this tradition and uphold its legacy for generations. (Jasmine Coleman)\n\nOne of the most expensive music boxes sold for over $20K.\n\nA Swiss music box initially made for a Persian prince in 1901 sold for $23,481 at Sotheby’s, London, UK on 23 January 1985.
