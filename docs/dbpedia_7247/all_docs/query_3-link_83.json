        "text": "The Music Box was opened in 1921 by producer Sam H. Harris and composer Irving Berlin to showcase a series of Berlin’s “Music Box Revues.” Heralded on more than one occasion as the “best looking house on Broadway,” this 87-year-old venue has only been home to legitimate theater—unlike many of its neighbors.\n\nTo this day, The Music Box is co-owned by Irving Berlin’s estate along with the Shubert Organization."
