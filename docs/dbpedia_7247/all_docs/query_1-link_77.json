        "text": "Buy Music Box Mechanisms\n\nMusic box mechanisms, otherwise known as movements, produce the beautiful sounds that make music boxes a beloved gift and a household treasure. A metal cylinder or barrel with precisely placed pins rotates away from and then under a steel comb, plucking correctly tuned and placed prongs or tines creating a melody. The comb and barrel are in effect, created for each other and are tune specific. The shorter tines produce high tones while the longer ones produce the low tones. The number of tines on a comb indicates the musical ability of the mechanism. 18 note, 30, 36, 50, 72, 100 or 144 note combs play longer with more embellishment and more melodies. Some of the larger, more complex music boxes play 2 or 3 songs or have 4 or more interchangeable cylinders playing 4 or 5 tunes.\n\nSome contain drum-like sounds and/or bells.\n\nTheMusicHouse.com has one of the largest collections of cylinder mechanisms for your musical enjoyment.

Snuff boxes were fitted with tiny mechanisms to transform them into music boxes as early as the 18th century. Musical boxes differed dramatically since some music boxes were the size of a loaf of bread while others were the size of a dresser. People of Pre-Radio days enjoyed them as their parlor music.
