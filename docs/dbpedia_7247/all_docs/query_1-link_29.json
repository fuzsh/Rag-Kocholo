        "text": "Give us the big picture: What’s the vibe of the place, what’s it like?\n\nThis venue, in the far reaches of the residential Bywater neighborhood, is an aesthetic delight. It looks something like a post-apocalyptic wooden fortress, impenetrable except to those in the know (the public entrance is set in the back). Inside is part acoustic playground, part rural music venue, part museum. There are several small \"houses\"—built with wood and metal and plastic, in different styles—and each has its own musical \"instruments,\" be it percussion or wind or some more elaborate electronic devices hooked into windows and floors. It’s built for you to run around, explore, and make lots of noise.\n\nWhat kinds of events can we see here?\n\nThe shows here are one-of-a-kind. Anything from rock to opera might happen, the common thread being that artists are encouraged to make use of the unique sounds and setup available to them. Performances are true one-offs, with even the most polished songs being deconstructed and put together again using the wooden blocks or bells available. The venue encourages a particular kind of collaboration and invention, and most artists rise to the challenge.\n\nNice. How are the seats?\n\nSeats are where you can find them, either on wooden structures and platforms or on the ground. As things are likely to happen all around the venue, there really are no bad seats.\n\nGood for kids?\n\nKids are very much welcome, both to explore the houses when there aren't any shows (usually daytimes over the weekend) and to see the shows themselves. The venue hosts regular, kid-and-family-friendly workshops for instrument making, and general creative activities centered around music. There are also weekend markets, and in general the venue is very inclusive for all ages with a breadth of community-focused programming.\n\nAnything in particular that makes this place special, from the programming to a unique feature it has?\n\nThe program is a delightfully esoteric one, encompassing everything from local rock bands to nationally touring pop stars to international folk choirs to experimental performance art. You can also rest safe in the knowledge that shows you see here will never be repeated anywhere else in the same way, and that makes them feel incredibly special.\n\nIf we’re going to be in town, what—and who—do you think this is best for?\n\nIf you want to be surprised, impressed, and inspired all at the same time, even when seeing a band you've seen play a hundred times before, then this is the place. Every event is unique in its own way, and you’ll come away with very special memories."
