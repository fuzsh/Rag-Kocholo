        "text": "Thank you for visiting Herz Music Box Company, the only company in the world to produce musical boxes like the Swiss family workshops of the 19th century – the “golden age” of the musical box. Please stay to see our exquisite instruments. Those who have not seen antique examples of the musical box maker’s art will be astonished at their beauty, power, musical complexity, and richness of tone.\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing a Herz musical box, please look at my current offering located on the Models page. If you would like to know how I came to be the only American cylinder musical box maker in history, have a look at the About page. If you are interested in having your tune immortalized on a musical box please see custom tunes. If you have an antique musical box that needs repair or restoration, please see the Services page.
