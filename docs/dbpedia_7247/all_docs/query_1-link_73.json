        "text": "An intersection in Silver Lake recently designated as historic for its connection with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy’s classic 1932 film, The Music Box, will soon get its own sign.\n\nThe City Council on Wednesday voted unanimously to name the intersection of Vendome Street and Del Monte Drive as the “1932 site of the `The Music Box’ Starring Laurel and Hardy.”\n\nLaurel and Hardy won an Academy Award for short comedy for the work, which was\n\nfilmed on the Music Box Steps in Silver Lake. The premise is simple: the lads have to deliver a huge piano to a house at the top of the steps.\n\nThere’s a surprise ending to their efforts. Watch the short above for it.\n\nThe steps are visited by fans from around the world.\n\n“Silver Lake is home to so many historic outdoor staircases, contributing to the rich cultural fabric of our community,” L.A. City Councilman Hugo Soto-Martínez said in a statement. “We are proud to recognize this small but mighty landmark in the history of our city’s most important industry.”\n\nThe Music Box Steps already are marked with a plaque erected by the Hollywood Heritage Museum, The Society of Operating Cameramen, and The Silver Lake Improvement Association.\n\nThe Silver Lake Improvement Association will host its annual “Music Box Steps Day Festival” at Laurel and Hardy Park, across the street from the Music Box Steps."
