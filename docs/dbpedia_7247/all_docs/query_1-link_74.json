        "text": "Music Box Films has bought domestic rights to “In the Summers,” a coming-of-age tale from writer-director Alessandra Lacorazza Samudio which won Sundance’s grand jury prize and directing award in the U.S. dramatic competition.\n\nA directorial debut, “In the Summers” tells the story of two daughters navigating a turbulent but loving father during yearly visits to his home in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The Latin-American family portrait is headlined by Grammy Award-winning Puerto Rican rapper, songwriter, and actor René Pérez Joglar (known in the music industry as Residente), who plays the divorced father, while the two siblings, Violeta and Eva, are played at different ages by several rising actors, including Sasha Calle (“The Flash”), Lío Mehiel (“Mutt”) and Sharlene Cruz (“Flatbush Misdemeanors”). The cast is completed by Leslie Grace (“In the Heights”) and Emma Ramos (“New Amsterdam”).\n\nThe critically lauded movie will have its New York premiere in June at the Tribeca Film Festival, screening in the Narrative Spotlight section, followed by Frameline Film Festival in San Francisco.\n\nMusic Box Films plans to release the film theatrically later this summer with a home entertainment release to follow.\n\nLacorazza said her “biggest aim with ‘In the Summers’ is to tell a complex, queer, and Latin story with nuance and truth, and see my communities represented in an honest way – letting us sit in the beauty between good and bad.”\n\n“I am incredibly proud of everyone who poured their heart and soul into this project and believed in the film. I’m thrilled to have found a partner in Music Box Films and can’t wait for the world to see the incredible performances of all the actors, including René’s beautiful portrayal of a fragmented but loving father,” she continued.\n\nMusic Box Films’ head of acquisitions, Brian Andreotti, said the “whole team was incredibly moved by ‘In the Summers’ and the journeys of Eva, Violeta, and their father Vicente as they strive to sustain their family on their own terms.”\n\n“Alessandra exhibits such tremendous empathy as a storyteller, with the generosity to view all of her characters as complex people with the capacity to love and to change,” added Andreotti.\n\nHe said the film is “rooted in a specific time and place, but the clarity of Alessandra’s perspective makes it a universal story that’s accessible to anyone who’s ever questioned their place within their family, their community, or their own body.”\n\nThe film’s producer, Alexander Dinelaris at Lexicon said “Alessandra Lacorraza’s powerfully moving and personal story simply had to find its way to the screen, and we were determined to make that happen.”\n\n“Her talent and vision were undeniable and I know I speak for all involved when I say we are incredibly proud to have been able to play a part in the incredible journey of this film,” said Dinelaris.\n\n“In the Summers” was produced by Dinelaris, Rob Quadrino, Nando Vila, Lynette Coll, Sergio Lira, Daniel Tantalean, and Cynthia Fernandez De La Cruz. The sale of the film was negotiated by Brian Andreotti of Music Box Films, Pip Ngo at XYZ Films, and CAA Media Finance.\n\nMusic Box’s upcoming releases include Valérie Donzelli’s “Just the Two of Us,” Monia Chokri’s Cesar prizewinning “The Nature of Love; and “Mountains,” the debut feature from Monica Sorelle."
