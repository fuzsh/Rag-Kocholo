        "text": "THE INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Music Box is often considered a toy, but offers a distinct sonic experience, which composers enjoy utilizing for an impactful effect on the listener. Think of a flashback in a movie, where a kid is running through the grass on a sunny day – or imagine a serial killer caressing his cuddly toy. The music box offers the perfect sound for these intense and simultaneously subtle emotions.\n\nThe Plucked Piano is the ideal companion for the Music Box to create thrilling, mysterious and arcane soundscapes in no time. As the strings are being plucked instead of hit by a soft felt-covered hammer, the resulting sound is harsher and more rugged – perfect to get your audience into the right mood.\n\nMULTI-ARPEGGIO-DESIGNER\n\nThe Multi-Arpeggio-Designer is the centerpiece of every „Origins“-instrument. Two fully customizable arpeggiators create interlocking patterns and broad soundscapes by combining the unique timbres of the two instruments. The engine is designed to convey a musically meaningful, human performance, instead of a computer randomly aligning notes.\n\nLoad up one of 100+ inspiring presets or create your own arpeggios in as much detail as you like. The MAD provides a variety of different features and controls to realize your musical vision.\n\nCOPY ARPEGGIO DESIGNS BETWEEN DIFFERENT ORIGINS INSTRUMENTS\n\nYou created your own ingenious arpeggio design and want to use it with another ORIGINS product? Simply copy and paste your design to use it on-the-fly in any other instrument of the ORIGINS series.\n\nCOLORS MENU\n\nThe 12 individual color-presets provide even more possibilities to sculpt your sound. All colors are radically different in character and incorporate various effect settings and multiple impulse responses. While each MAD-Preset has an assigned color preset, you can combine everything at will, resulting in over 1200 predefined combinations."
