        "text": "The Maine Music Box collection has more than 22,000 musical works, consisting primarily of sheet music. It includes digitized cover art and scores, music manuscripts, and a small number of accompanying mp3 synthesized sound files. The Maine Music Box is a collaboration of three Maine libraries – the Bagaduce Music Lending Library (Blue Hill), the Bangor Public Library, and the University of Maine’s Fogler Library. The project was initially funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).\n\nAround half of the works in the collection are in the public domain (not copyrighted) and may be downloaded in full. Cover art thumbnail images, bibliographic, and keyword indexing data are provided for in-copyright works published in 1923 or later. For access to the full scores of copyrighted materials please contact the Bagaduce Music Lending Library\n\nLibraries and archives collect materials from different cultures and time periods to preserve and make available the historical record. As a result, library materials, such as those presented here, may reflect racist and homophobic views that may be harmful and difficult to view.\n\nContent comes from five major printed music collections:\n\nVocal Popular Sheet Music Collection (Bagaduce Music Lending Library) consists of over 16,500 pieces of popular American music representing the many vocal styles from the late nineteenth through the twentieth century.\n\nStatus: 5,775 titles in the public domain have been transferred to DigitalCommons@UMaine from the legacy site.\n\nParlor Salon Sheet Music Collection (Bagaduce Music Lending Library) consists of 3,569 scores organized in three unique collections: Vocal Parlor/Salon, Piano Parlor/Salon and Violin Parlor/Salon.\n\nStatus: 2,600 scores in the public domain have been transferred to DigitalCommons@UMaine from the legacy site.\n\nMusic for Two Pianos Eight Hands (Bagaduce Music Lending Library) consists of 223 rare scores that are out-of-print and/or out-of-copyright.\n\nStatus: not yet transferred, available on legacy site.\n\nMaine Sheet Music Collection (Bagaduce Music Lending Library) consists of over 2,200 pieces ranging from 1845-1997, and includes keyboard, choral, vocal, and instrumental music.\n\nStatus: 850 scores in the public domain have been transferred from the legacy site."
