        "meta_description": "The Leo St. Clair Music Box Collection takes you on a magical journey through the wonderful world of music boxes. One of the largest of its kind, the collection ranges from the antique and unique to the commonplace. Leo St.Clair served in the U.S. Navy during both the first and second World Wars, and the Korean conflict. It was during his military service that his interest in music boxes began, when the Queen of Belgium presented him with a box that is still the star of the collection. The displays not only celebrate his interest in music boxes, but his service to his country and fellow man. Once owned by movie stars and soldiers, the famous and the unknown, the collection is a delightful trip for young and old, through time and imagination.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Sulphur Springs Public Library, the Leo St. Clair Music Box Collection offers a collection of more than 150 music boxes, many one-of-a-kind, unique and antique.",
