        "text": "This year marks the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. And one of the most important people to bring the music to the masses is Ralph McDaniels. Uncle Ralph, as some people affectionately call him, started Video Music Box on public access television in 1983.\n\nHe joined âNews All Dayâ with more on the music that has powered his life.\n\nMcDaniels started as a DJ and says that he was inspired to create Video Music Box because he wanted to put something on TV that he and his friends would like.\n\nFor those looking to make their mark, McDaniels recommends writing your ideas or vision first. Then he says to find others who are interested in making those ideas come to fruition."
