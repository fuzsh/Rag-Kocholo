        "text": "Ever look inside the inner workings of a music box? From the beauty of the tunes they play, you would think there's a miniature orchestra in there. Instead, a rotating cylinder or disc with hundreds of tiny points pluck a series of keys at just the right time. Every winding of its clockwork movement delivers a perfect performance. It's amazing to watch music come out of such an odd assemblage of parts. Not surprisingly, early music boxes are highly collectible, and there are many enthusiasts. Here's some melodic history.\n\nThe record seems to agree that music boxes first appeared around the time of the American Revolution. Sizes ranged from breadbox to dresser, and many were elaborately housed by skilled cabinetmakers. Nonetheless, the internal mechanisms were intricate, and most were made by Swiss watchmakers.\n\nThe first dedicated factory opened in about 1816, and by century's end there was a scattering of manufacturers throughout western Europe. Metal discs provided the first musical scores but were replaced by cylinders not long thereafter. Subsequently, discs returned to favor until both found their place in the market.\n\nIn late 1800s, two giants in the category emerged. The first was Symphonion, established in 1885 as a maker of disc-driven music boxes. They pioneered many innovations during their 24-year run and were known for their extensive line of models. Among other things, Symphonion was also the first to introduce electric powered units, doing so as early as 1900.\n\nThe second was Polyphon, an outgrowth of Symphonion and the first to introduce music boxes en masse to the American market through its Regina affiliate. Both Symphonion and Polyphon products exude old-school quality and remain catnip for music box collectors around the world.\n\nRegrettably, the popularity of music boxes waned quickly. By the early 1900s, music lovers had discovered gramophones and player pianos, both offering louder sound and more easily interchanged variety. Regina lasted until 1921, having sold more than 100,000 music boxes in America but ultimately unable to survive changing tastes and escalating costs. By the end of the 1920s, the luxury music box business had all but disappeared.\n\nToday, several firms still manufacture music boxes, although not to the degree of years past. The Swiss firm Reuge absorbed many early makers and now produces a line starting at about $1,200. Nidec Sankyo in Japan, Porter Music Box in Vermont and several other Asian factories remain in the market, competing mostly in the novelty arena. There is even a small but high-end bespoke category catered to mostly by Reuge.\n\nFor serious collectors, however, there is nothing like the tone of the early models and the rich cabinetry in which they were housed. If you have one, treat it with care. Those are works of true craftsmanship."
