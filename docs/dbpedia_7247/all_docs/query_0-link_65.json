The city of Los Angeles joins them as plans to erect a permanent commemoration are moving forward.\n\n\"With this renaming, I am delighted that we are able to both recognize an important piece of our city's movie history and mark one of our city's unique and beautiful outdoor staircases,\" City Councilwoman Nithya Raman said in a statement.\n\nThe Society of Camera Operators, who in 1992 co-sponsored The Music Box Steps plaque, expressed their support for the city to dedicate this location. Michael Frediani, historical chair of the organization, who brought this site to the city's attention, said they hope to shine a spotlight on as many iconic film locations as possible.\n\nIn the second week of October, the Silver Lake Improvement Association will host its annual Music Box Steps Day Festival at Laurel and Hardy Park, across the street from the Music Box Steps.\n\n\"On behalf of the Silver Lake Improvement Association (SLIA), we're thrilled that the city is giving this official recognition to the Music Box Steps, one of the most famous and beloved film sites in cinema history,\" Vincent Brook, SLIA board member and founder of Music Box Steps Day, said in a statement.\n\nHe noted their annual festival has been going on for 29 years as a way to honor the \"legendary comedy team, their Oscar-winning film and the world-renowned film site.' Brook added that it's intended to remind the surrounding community and the city at large of this \"historic jewel.\""
