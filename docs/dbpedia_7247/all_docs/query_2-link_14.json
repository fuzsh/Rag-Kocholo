My search method is probably wrong. Trying to learn the secrets of producing a good sound using a wood turned box. Any ideas?

No guarantee but it is a start.\n\nJoined\n\nJun 13, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n235\n\nLikes\n\n313\n\nLocation\n\nJackson, NJ\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.blacklabelwoodworks.com\n\nMay 23, 2021\n\n#3\n\nIt also has to do with how thin and even thickness the bottom is. The bottom of the box becomes a sound board that amplifies the sound. I have made a fair amount of boxes out of Sapele it seems amplify the sound fairly well.\n\nJoined\n\nApr 7, 2019\n\nMessages\n\n64\n\nLikes\n\n23\n\nLocation\n\nWalworth, NY\n\nMay 23, 2021\n\n#4\n\nThankx fellas. I will try a very hard wood (pignut hickory) and a softer wood (soft maple) in various thicknesses attached to the same box as bottom plates. I wonder if the size of the chamber and what wood the box is made from makes a difference in sound quality. Also a removable or hinged top?\n\nJoined\n\nJun 13, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n235\n\nLikes\n\n313\n\nLocation\n\nJackson, NJ\n\nWebsite\n\nwww.blacklabelwoodworks.com\n\nMay 23, 2021\n\n#5\n\nI have done demo's on making them out of a solid piece of wood without using a separate piece for the bottom. I make a loose fitting lid with a chamfered edge that matches the top of the box to center it and insert a glass coaster in the top to protect the movement.\n\nAttachments\n\nmusicbox2demo.jpg\n\njohn lucas\n\nAAW Forum Expert\n\nJoined\n\nApr 26, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n8,427\n\nLikes\n\n3,814\n\nLocation\n\nCookeville, TN\n\nMay 23, 2021\n\n#6\n\nContact Mike Hunter. He came to mynshopnand we experimented with making music boxes. Pretty sure he spent more time perfecting them. You can reach him through his website.

The sound was quite good even with an inexpensive movement. I attached the movement to some thin wood with holes to act as a soundboard like an acoustic guitar. The bowl/box portion was the resonating chamber which acted like a speaker enclosure. But, you have many design options.\n\nMusic Box (opened)\n\nShowing soundboard and winding key.\n\nMusic Box\n\n(2014) Bucks Woodturners annual Pollyanna exchange piece – Theme ~ “Music Box” Maple with textured lid & finial. 5⅛”ø x 6⅜”h.
