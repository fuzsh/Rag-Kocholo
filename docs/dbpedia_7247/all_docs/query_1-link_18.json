        "text": "What if I need handicap / special seating assistance?\n\nWe recommend you contact the box office as soon as you buy your tickets (and no later than 24 hours in advance) to the show if you need assistance, as our seating policy is limited for all shows.\n\nI bought tickets, but haven’t received them in my inbox yet… What should I do?\n\nFirst, check your spam folder to see if the tickets ended up there. You’d be surprised how often they end up in there.\n\nIf your tickets are not there, please contact our box office for assistance. Hours are Monday – Friday 11 AM to 5 PM. Call us at (619) 795-1337, or email us at BoxOffice@MusicBoxSD.com.\n\nI want to be a Music Box VIP who gets to buy tickets before they go on sale to the public. How do I sign up?\n\nYou can sign up to be a Music Box VIP and you’ll never miss the opportunity to buy tickets before they go on sale to the general public!\n\nYou have bands I’ve never heard of. How can I find out what they’re like?\n\nGo to the “Calendar” section of our website, click on the band name and if it’s available, we will have posted a description of the band, as well as a video. We also have a spotify playlist located on our Home Page with songs from upcoming bands.\n\nWe have calendars inside the venue that you can grab and take home with you. To get the most updated show announcements and to buy tickets before the general public, sign up for our Music Box e-mail list on our website.\n\nThe website says it’s 18+ or 21+ and I won’t be that age until next month. Can I still get into the show if I’m under age?\n\nIf it states you must be 18+, you must already be 18+ to attend.\n\nIf the show states you must be 21+, you must already be 21+ to attend.\n\nWe’re a band and we would love to play at Music Box. How do we do that?\n\nPlease email Booking@MusicBoxSD.com with your band’s web page, audio or a social media page, band bio, a list of what venues in San Diego you have played at and with what other acts you have played with over the last year.\n\nWhat time should I arrive?\n\nGenerally, our doors open 60-90 minutes before show time so that guests can eat, drink, and socialize before the show.\n\nShow times for each event are published on our website just to the right of the band photo.\n\nIf you wish to check out our food menu before arriving click here.\n\nIs seating available?\n\nOur shows are primarily standing room only, unless designated as a “seated” show. You’ll be able to see if a show is a seated show by looking at the “event information” located on each event page.\n\nDuring a standing room only show, there may be opportunity for a seat, however they are very limited and not guaranteed.\n\nDuring a seated show, everyone with a seated ticket will be guaranteed a seat within our general admission area, however location is first come, first served.\n\nIf you wish to be guaranteed a seat in our mezzanine area, click here for more information.\n\nWhere do I park?\n\nThere is no designated lot for Music Box, however there is free street parking after 6 PM every day, and all day Sunday. In addition, there are 7 parking lots within one block of the venue with reasonable nighttime rates. Click here for a map of suggestions on where to park.\n\nIs there re-entry to the venue during a show?\n\nWe don’t allow re-entry.\n\nWhat is your policy regarding photos / video / audio?\n\nRecording policies are at the bands’ discretion and change night to night, We don’t allow professional cameras without written artist permission. You may bring your camera with the understanding that you may be asked to leave it in your car should the policy not allow you to bring it in. Phone cameras are typically allowed.\n\nIs there a dress code?\n\nMusic Box does not enforce a dress code, however from time to time a band may request one.\n\nInformation regarding dress code requirements for those shows will be posted on our website and/or on the ticket.\n\nI saw that tickets were $20, now they’re $25. I’m pissed!\n\nOur tickets often change pricing from advanced sales to day of show sales. Ticket prices will always be listed on each event page.\n\nDo you have a smoking section?\n\nYes. Our smoking section can be found on the patio outside the front door.\n\nYou may not bring drinks to the smoking patio, nor is anyone under the age of 21 allowed on the patio.\n\nCan I smoke weed?\n\nNo. While smoking pot is legal in California for private use, it is not permitted on our smoking patio or inside our venue.\n\nWhat rules should I know to avoid getting in trouble with security?\n\nDon’t mosh and/or run into customers.\n\nDon’t be visibly intoxicated.\n\nDon’t sneak smokes or drinks to those underage. If you do, your entire party will be asked to leave without refund.\n\nDon’t fight with other patrons.\n\nDon’t make other patrons feel unsafe.\n\nDon’t rest your beverages over or on the railing of the second or third floors.\n\nI can’t make it / I got sick / I had to work / I’m out of town. Can I get a refund?\n\nAll sales are final. No refunds or exchanges unless a show is cancelled or postponed via the venue or band and you are unable to make the new date.\n\nIn the event of a refund, refunds are issued in the manner in which you purchased. If you purchased via credit card, the refund will be credited back to the card.\n\nHow can I meet the band?\n\nOnly shows with a Meet & Greet ticket for sale have a scheduled time for fans to meet the band. If we don’t have this as an option for sale, it is unlikely you will have a chance to meet them.\n\nMusic Box needs to support my charity. Who do I speak with?\n\nVenue management reviews all charity requests, and tries to fulfill them. Most of the time we will give tickets to specific shows that a charity can use for auction.\n\nIf you would like to use the venue for a charity event, please click here for information on venue rental.\n\nDo I have to print my digital tickets? I don’t have a printer.\n\nWe prefer to scan tickets off of smartphones. Save a tree.\n\nYou know that part on the ticket receipt that says ‘you must print your ticket’? We don’t mean it…\n\nI recently played at Music Box, but left my microphone. When can I come get it?\n\nLost and found for musicians is handled differently than for customers. Please contact the production manager and arrange for the return of items. You will most likely be asked to meet at the venue when someone from production is in house to arrange for the return of lost items.\n\nUnfortunately, we can’t allow musicians access to the stage or production areas to grab equipment when someone from production is not present.\n\nCan you send me a floor plan of your seating (specific to my VIP mezzanine inquiries)?\n\nYes. Click here for a complete venue floor layout.\n\nPlease be aware we are a 3 level venue with Tables on floor 1, Opera Boxes on floor 2 (Mezzanine) and Couches on floor 3.\n\nIs this the old Anthology?\n\nThis building was Anthology from 2006-2012.\n\nWe are a very different space now. Please be prepared for a different experience and come ready to have fun!"
