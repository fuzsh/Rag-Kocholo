        "text": "music box, mechanical musical instrument that is sounded when tuned metal prongs, or teeth, mounted in a line on a flat comb are made to vibrate by contact with a revolving cylinder or disc that is driven by a clockwork mechanism. As the cylinder or disc revolves, small pins or other projections mounted on its surface pluck the pointed ends of the metal teeth, causing them to vibrate and produce musical notes. The sequence of notes produced is determined by the arrangement of projections on the cylinder. The deeper the teeth are cut into the comb or flat plate, the lower their pitch when plucked. A watch spring and clockwork move the cylinder, and a fly regulator governs the rate. The music box was a popular household instrument from about 1810 until the early 20th century, when the player piano and the phonograph rendered it obsolete.\n\nThe music box was probably invented about 1770 in Switzerland. The earliest music boxes were small enough to be enclosed in a pocket watch, but they were gradually built in larger sizes and housed in rectangular wooden boxes. A typical large music box had a comb of 96 steel teeth plucked by pins on a brass cylinder 13 inches (330 mm) long, and the cylinder could be changed to allow different musical selections. Changing and storing the cylinders proved cumbersome, however, and so in the 1890s they were replaced by a large-diameter metal disc (shaped and revolved somewhat like a phonograph record) with projections or slots on its surface to pluck the teeth. The discs, which reached 2.5 feet (75 cm) in diameter, could be easily changed, and disc music boxes had displaced cylinder models in popularity by 1900. By 1910, however, music boxes had been largely replaced by the phonograph. The music box is one of several idiophones (instruments whose sounding parts are resonant solids) that are plucked rather than vibrated by percussion."
