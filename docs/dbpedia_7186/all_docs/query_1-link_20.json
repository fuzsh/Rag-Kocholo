        "text": "Introduction\n\nWe are in the midst of a scientific revolution that will transform biological research and have profound effects on medicine (1–4). Recently, genetic modification using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat–CRISPR-associated protein), a system of adaptive immunity discovered in bacteria, has become widely feasible and cheap. By some estimates, it is 150 times cheaper than other genetic modification techniques such as the use of Zinc fingers, costing as little as $30 (5). Described in 2015 as “Science’s breakthrough of the year” (6), CRISPR-Cas9 heralds promise as well as perils. We might be able to eliminate single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and Huntington’s disease. At the same time, conscious selection of genes for specific physical and mental traits might reify social inequities and revive the possibility of eugenics.\n\nWith the first report of human germline modification in 2015 (7), these concerns take on an unprecedented urgency. The effects of these genetic modifications would be heritable and propagated into future generations. Researchers and ethicists are divided on how best to proceed (8, 9). Some call for a moratorium on human germline research since these techniques need to be refined, and more importantly, we need to understand their ethical implications and establish a communal understanding of how best to proceed (10–12). Others insist that we have a moral imperative to press on; the potential benefits to many combined with the observation that people are typically inept at anticipating social consequences of new technologies undermine reasons to wait (13–15). High profile media outlet opinions range from calls for caution to breathless anticipation (16, 17–21).\n\nIn December 2015, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine held a summit on the regulation of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-modifying technology (22). The summit was opened by PHD physicist and Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL) with a reminder that gaining public acceptance of what scientists and physician want to do with CRISPR-Cas9 is critical (22). The subsequent discussions included the need for basic and preclinical research, issues around somatic and germline uses of CRISPR-Cas9, and the desire for an ongoing international forum for discussions that include a wide range of stakeholders including public interest advocates and members of the general public (23). The final report opined that it would be irresponsible to proceed with germline modification without broad societal consensus about the appropriateness of proposed applications (23).\n\nThese initial discussions underscore the need for information about the public’s opinion about genetic modification. Given CRISPR-Cas9’s technical ease, low cost, and potentially wide-spread application, knowing current public attitudes is critical to planning where to direct educational efforts and how to inform policy and regulations (24, 25).\n\nHere, we conducted a large-scale survey of attitudes toward research made possible by CRISPR-Cas9. Our objective was to learn what level of support there is for this research among laypersons and to understand the variables that influence opinions regarding the ethics of genetic modification. Such initial information would serve as a yardstick of public opinion as debates continue among academics and the force of those controversies is communicated to the public. In this study, we tested two general hypotheses. First, the public’s reaction is not monolithic; social and demographic factors influence how people weigh pros and cons of such innovation (26). Second, the way information about new technology is presented influences people’s attitudes.\n\nThe social and demographic variables we considered were gender, age, ethnicity, education, and political affiliation. As expressed in a Nature comment, a 2015 biotechnology and ethical imagination summit (BEINGS 2015) gave the impression of gender differences with men focused on biosecurity threats and regulatory impediments to research and women on eugenics and the promotion of class, race, and gender inequities (27). We anticipated that younger people are more open to adopting new technologies. For example, age had an effect in a large survey conducted by Nature on people’s attitudes toward pharmacological enhancements in healthy individuals (28). Race and ethnicity may also affect people’s attitudes toward science (29, 30). Given the US history of unethical biomedical research on African-Americans, most infamously the US Public Health Service syphilis study at Tuskegee (31), it would not be surprising if this community were more sensitive to potential abuses of scientific research. Finally, political affiliations correlate with people’s attitudes toward complicated science (29). For example, conservatives are less likely than liberals to believe data supporting concerns about climate change (32, 33).\n\nWith respect to presentation of information, we considered two variables. We assessed the effects of explicit mention of risks of genetic modification, which we expect would dampen enthusiasm. We also assessed the effects of framing of the issue, which can bias people’s interpretation of complex events (34). The framing of an issue, often by the media, directs the public not only at what to think but also at how to think about an issue. When smoking was framed as a story about individual choice, it was unlikely to mobilize public support for tobacco regulation guidelines. However, when framed as a defective product that required the government to protect citizens, tobacco regulation gained support (35). Such framing can set up expectations as new information comes in that is configured to the defining frame. We used metaphors to frame research in genetic modification. Metaphors can influence people’s opinions about complex social issues and influence their views on policy. For example, when crime is discussed as a predator, people advocate for stronger policing; when crime is described as a virus, people advocate for cures for social ills that give rise to crime (36) [although see Ref. (37)].\n\nTo assess the effect of framing metaphors, we used contrasting vignettes (38, 39). This technique probes attitudes to minimally contrasting vignettes, using a between-subject design. Each participant is randomly assigned to a vignette and is unaware of contrasting versions. In addition to assessing people’s general attitudes, the method captures differences in attitudes rendered by differences in presentation. Each vignette is worded similarly, except for the framing and language supporting that framing. Each participant offers an opinion on one version of the vignettes. Our principal question was whether framing inﬂuences people’s attitudes at a population level.\n\nIn summary, we used contrasting vignettes to assess the public’s attitudes toward new innovations in genetic modification. We examined effects of how information is presented and the sensitivity of these attitudes to demographic variables. An understanding of the public’s view of genetic modification is critical to public outreach and to guiding policy on the pace and direction of this research, which will have a profound effect on all our lives.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe technical feasibility and low cost of CRISPR-Cas9 is likely to make this technology used widely. It could allow medicine to eliminate single-gene disorders, insert protective genes, and potentially replace or modify genes to enhance physical and mental traits. While gene modification techniques have been available for a few decades, these latest innovations are likely game changers.\n\nThe use of CRISPR-Cas9 in human germlines reported in 2015 (7) has given scientists pause. Recent meetings have been organized to generate discussions about the future applications of these technologies. Scientists, ethicists, and the media express a wide range of opinions. Missing in these discussions is a sense of how the general public would react to both the promise and the perils of such technology. This paper represents a first step in filling this gap in knowledge as scientists and policymakers ponder how best to proceed.\n\nThe most basic finding, based on 2,493 respondents, is that our sample of diverse participants is supportive of continuing research in human genetic modification. Our vignettes gave respondents information about the possibility of eradicating single-gene disorders, inserting protective genes, and introduced the potential use of genetic modification for enhancement.\n\nWe further tested the following hypotheses. First, the form in which information is conveyed and social and demographic variables modify people’s opinions. With respect to the presentation of information, we found that the explicit mention of risks dampened enthusiasm for the use of such technologies. Despite this dampening effect, the respondents remained supportive of the research.\n\nThe relative support for pursuing this technology was modulated by several demographic variables. We think it would be a mistake to view people as pro- or anti-science, or pro- or anti-risk. Rather, we postulate that these demographic variables affect the relative weighting of potential promises and perils of this technology. Women are typically less optimistic about biotechnology than men (40). They may be more sensitive to risks and concerned about issues like eugenics, whereas men tend to be more concerned about regulatory impediments to scientific progress (27). Consistent with these speculations, we found that women as a group were less enthusiastic about proceeding with genetic modification. Similarly, African-Americans were less enthusiastic about this technology. Age also played a role. This observation is consistent with previous surveys that suggest that younger people are more open to the use of pharmacologic enhancements and are likely to be less averse to risks (28). Education and political affiliation affected peoples’ attitudes. People with a high school education or less were more cautious in their appraisal of the use of this technology. People with left-leaning politics were most positive about forging ahead. People with right-leaning politics, while still positive as a group, were more subdued in their endorsement, consistent with the observation that since 1974 there has been a steady diminution of trust in science (41) among conservatives.\n\nWe recognize that a limitation of this convenience sample is that our respondents, by virtue of taking an online survey, may be more open to promises of new technology. Other factors may have biased our sample, including an age distribution that skewed younger, and more left leaning in their political orientation compared to the general population. As we quantify in Table , it should be emphasized that the present sample also differs from the US population on proportion of African-Americans, Latinos, and Whites, and on proportion of highly educated people, over-representing Whites and the highly educated. We note that traditional sampling methods of using telephone calls have biases in so far as the use of landlines is on the decline. A recent non-peer reviewed report (42) surveying a representative sample of the US public also found general support for genetic manipulation, although not as robustly supportive as our group. The M-Turk population is nonetheless diverse and samples from a wide range of education and income levels (43).\n\nWe also tested the hypothesis that metaphors used to describe genetic modification bias people’s attitudes. Metaphors are important in guiding the general understanding of scientific advances (44) and are hypothesized to influence people’s views on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 (26). We examined the metaphors of editing, engineering, surgery, and hacking. One limitation of the current work is that the metaphors were chosen based on an ad hoc selection of metaphors which we observed commonly in academic and popular press writing. Although we did not find additional metaphors widely in use, it is possible that an inductive search for common metaphors would yield different results. We found anecdotal differences in the use of these framing metaphors between the academic literature and the media. Specifically, the media uses the editing metaphor more often than academics. Perhaps, journalists’ use of the editing as a core metaphor is not surprising, given their profession as writers.\n\nThe lay public needs to be informed of these dramatic biological innovations even as they are evolving. Scientific organizations call for engaging people from all sectors of society in a debate about genetic modification including the use of human embryos in this research (36). Such engagement is critical to understanding if there is broad public support for relevant health policies and regulations. However, engaging the public is predicated on educating them about new technologies, their real world implications, and establishing an initial measure of their attitudes toward the promise and perils of such research. The present data suggest that public education efforts have substantial influences on attitudes depending on whether the risks of genetic modification are made explicit.\n\nWe did not find that common metaphors used to describe genetic modification influenced people’s attitudes. From our data, there is no evidence that the media’s use of language influences people’s attitudes in ways that scientists might not intend. We remain agnostic as to whether the absence of an effect in this study represents a “dose response.” Perhaps, more detailed information and language supporting metaphors might modulate people’s attitudes (37). Alternatively, this sample of participants with a relatively high degree of support for research in genetic modification may have been at ceiling such that they were insensitive to modulation by framing metaphors."
