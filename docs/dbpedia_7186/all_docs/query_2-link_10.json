        "text": "Steven Kovacs needed his cable hooked up… The Cable Guy needed a friend… But is free cable worth all this?\n\nJim Carrey is Chip Douglas, cable installer. Raised on television sitcoms, he wants life to look just like My Three Sons. And when he meets single guy Steven Kovacs (Matthew Broderick), he sees his chance for some serious male bonding. But Chip's idea of friendship - which includes physical assault, a game of 'Porno Password' and a medieval joust - may be hazardous to Steven's health. In Chip's own immortal words, \"I can be your best friend...or your worst enemy.\""
