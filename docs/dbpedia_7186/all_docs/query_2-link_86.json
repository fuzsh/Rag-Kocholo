        "text": "Welcome back to another live tweet session, kicking off 90’s movie month with Ben Stiller’s The Cable Guy.\n\nHere we go a live tweet session of #TheCableGuy\n\nI actually think it’s one of the best comedy of the 90’s, it’s a dark film that audiences didn’t get #TheCableGuy\n\nBen Stiller did a good job as director, good cast as well. A unique role for Jim Carrey #TheCableGuy\n\nA nice satire on TV too, and there’s Jack Black #TheCableGuy\n\nCould do without seeing Matthew Broderick in the shower though #TheCableGuy\n\nHere’s Jim Carrey and I love the way he plays this. It’s over the top but not extreme. #TheCableGuy\n\nIt’s a good opening, very unsuspecting. No idea what to expect if it’s a first time watch. #TheCableGuy\n\nGreat Jim Carrey is molesting the wall … #TheCableGuy\n\nBroderick’s character is such an annoying ass. #TheCableGuy\n\nLove the on going courtcase on the TV with Stiller as Sam Sweet #TheCableGuy\n\nBroderick’s character deserves a punch in the face #TheCableGuy\n\nAfter he acts like a dick he tries to get free movie channels off the cable guy. #TheCableGuy\n\nJim Carrey’s character is lonely … poor bastard #TheCableGuy\n\nEven if he’s unhinged the cable guy is a nice dude. Just don’t piss him off yo #TheCableGuy\n\nI wonder if this film came out today whether it would still be a flop #TheCableGuy\n\nThey both have Daddy issues #TheCableGuy\n\nThis film has some great dialogue #TheCableGuy\n\nJim Carrey’s character has been so poorly treated he’s desperate for a friend but he could have done better than asshole Brod #TheCableGuy\n\nYep Brod, Leslie Mann should have dumped your ass #TheCableGuy\n\nNow the stalking commenses and it’s really creepy … brrrrr #TheCableGuy\n\nThis basketball game is pretty hilarious, it’s well done #TheCableGuy\n\nIf Jim Carrey’s shorts were any shorter he would be wearing jocks … eeeesh #TheCableGuy\n\nEven though he’s totally unhinged, when Brod tells him they aren’t friends Jim just get heartbroken so sad #TheCableGuy\n\nHe plays it well and he would be less sympathetic if Brod wasn’t such an ass #TheCableGuy\n\nSo Judd Apatow wrote a lot of this film and Leslie Mann is in it … coincidence? #TheCableGuy\n\nSo now he needs help the cable guy is his friend … jerk!!!! #TheCableGuy\n\nHe’s so selfish! I can’t side with Brod, Jim Carrey all the way! #TheCableGuy\n\nHe’s so cunning though, but he’s not stupid. If things don’t go his way he will stuff your life up! #TheCableGuy\n\nJim Carrey’s character as a kid was raised on TV but most of us were #TheCableGuy\n\nI would love to go to one of these medieval restaurants – looks like fun #TheCableGuy\n\nIt’s Ms Garafalo in a fun cameo! #TheCableGuy\n\nWould have been interesting if Chris Farley had played the cable guy. #TheCableGuy\n\nThe silence of the lambs scene is so random! #TheCableGuy\n\nNow they battle! It looks so much fun though #TheCableGuy\n\nOoooops the fake out manuvuer! Go Jim! Kick his asshole face in #TheCableGuy\n\n“It’s like when Kirk and Spock had to do battle” and they play the music hehe #TheCableGuy\n\nLol now they battle on horses, yeah he’s not unhinged at all #TheCableGuy\n\nTotally not creepy breaking into someone’s place and leaving them a home entertainment system. Call the cops maybe?! #TheCableGuy\n\nSurely his character can’t be that stupid … #TheCableGuy\n\nWhere did all these people come from for a karaoke party?! #TheCableGuy\n\nLol he gets him a lose your lisp tape, uuuhhhh ok #TheCableGuy\n\nHa I had forgotten he got him a hooker! Yep why hasn’t he called the cops #TheCableGuy\n\nAt least Rick aka Jack Black is on to the cable guy, he’s not stupid #TheCableGuy\n\nJim Carrey singing Somebody To Love is just glorious #TheCableGuy\n\nThe song is quite fitting when you listen to the lyrics and what the Brod goes through in the film #TheCableGuy\n\nI love how trippy this scene is, fits in perfectly #TheCableGuy\n\nNothing quite beats Carrey’s 70’s outfit #TheCableGuy\n\nGotta love the sneaky polaroids he takes … naughty #TheCableGuy\n\nRen and Stimpy on the tv WOOO #TheCableGuy\n\nHa he finds out she was a prostitute, like really how did he not know?! #TheCableGuy\n\nYes get the unstable man angry … that’ll work out well Brod #TheCableGuy\n\nCarrey looks like creepy Ben Stiller in his ‘disguise’ #TheCableGuy\n\nLeslie Mann on a date with sleazy Owen Wilson #TheCableGuy\n\nAh the lovely bathroom assault scene, that’s not overkill at all #TheCableGuy\n\nAssault via eye brow plucking … hardcore #TheCableGuy\n\nHe’s that unstable he still tries to help Brod … #TheCableGuy\n\nEric Roberts cameo that’s just brilliant #TheCableGuy\n\nNow he’s all charming to Robin, classic tactic #TheCableGuy\n\nAh the perfect manipulator #TheCableGuy\n\nOh boy now Brod’s life is going to go to the shitter, but he sort of deserves it #TheCableGuy\n\nBrod is such a bad friend, just dumps poor Jack Black #TheCableGuy\n\nGeez you’re breaking his heart Brod, big mistake #TheCableGuy\n\nHe’s got great tactics for messing with people who flob him off #TheCableGuy\n\nHe took it to the extreme, he’s getting arrested for stolen goods. Because you know he was stupid enough to not question Carrey #TheCableGuy\n\n“Are you taking the pot” says his father haha #TheCableGuy\n\nBad luck Brod weekend in lock up, oh and here’s Carrey to cause more trouble. #TheCableGuy\n\nOh yeah he flashes his nipple, he knows what to do #TheCableGuy\n\nCreep factor at 300% right now #TheCableGuy\n\nOh good make up with your only true friend, smart move Brod #TheCableGuy\n\nChip Douglas, Larry Tate … clever names #TheCableGuy\n\nNow he’s at the parents house, creepy cable guy #TheCableGuy\n\nPorno password is clearly the best game ever #TheCableGuy\n\n“The password is vagina” #TheCableGuy\n\n“Penith … penith …” #TheCableGuy\n\nBetter Call Saul is Brod’s brother in this, how did I not notice #TheCableGuy\n\nBrod you are acting crazy, that’s not how you deal with it … #TheCableGuy\n\nHa Brod punched him in front of the family, bad bad move #TheCableGuy\n\nHe hacks the computer system, seriously Brod don’t you know how to handle anything? #TheCableGuy\n\nHe gets you arrested and fired, seriously dude how do you keep making bad decisions #TheCableGuy\n\nOh finally the smart one, Jack Black figures out that Carrey is loopy #TheCableGuy\n\n“They booted his ass for stalking customers” yeah no shit #TheCableGuy\n\nBut you know don’t call the cops or anything … #TheCableGuy"
