I will get back to you on yours and you can talk to other users here about their films. It's a great place to talk about film.\n\nFIRST TIME MOVIE VIEWING\n\nAct of Violence (1948, Fred Zinnemann)\n\nRobert Ryan plays a vengeful POW who stalks his former commanding officer (Van Heflin) who betrayed his men's planned escape attempt from a Nazi prison camp. An interesting and at times powerful film noir.\n\n6-6.5/10\n\nOne Girl’s Confession (1953, Hugo Haas)\n\nLow budget film noir from Hugo Haas who always puts his own stamp on these films. Haas noirs skirt a particular cross in tones that doesn’t always work but there is something charming about them.\n\n5.5/10\n\nHit & Run (1957, Hugo Haas)\n\nsee above.\n\n5.5/10\n\nREPEAT MOVIE VIEWING\n\nHarry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004, Alfonso Cuaron)\n\nblu ray\n\nA huge step up in film making quality with effects, cinematography and editing all being much better.\n\n7/10\n\nThe Blues Brothers (1980, John Landis)\n\nUHD disc\n\nThis is made like a real movie from the 70’s rather than a disposable comedy. Still entertains.\n\n7/10\n\nHarry Potter & the Philosopher’s Stone (2001, Chris Columbus)\n\nblu ray\n\nThis is the first film in the series and as such did not have the financial investment that the others would have once this one proved itself. A lot of world building in this one so a lot less action and plot but it is all charming to watch. The effects were even pretty terrible upon release and are pretty awful now.\n\n6.5/10\n\nMurder at 1600 (1997, Dwight H. Little)\n\nNetflix\n\nFun if not convoluted 90’s thriller with a good cast that features Wesley Snipes, Diane Lane and Alan Alda.\n\n6.5/10\n\nHarry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets (2002, Chris Columbus)\n\nblu ray\n\nThis one feels like the filler episode and has far too little of the three leads working together. The effects are still not good but are miles better than the first film.\n\n5.5/10\n\nFIRST TIME DOCUMENTARY VIEWING\n\nVal (2021, Ting Poo, Leo Scott)\n\nDocumentary centering on the daily life of actor Val Kilmer featuring never-before-seen footage spanning 40 years.

While it may be acceptable for children, adults unfamiliar with the books might wonder what all the fuzz was about.\n\n4.5/10\n\nMurder at 1600 (1997, Dwight H. Little)\n\nUnderrated thriller with a good cast.\n\n6.5/10\n\nHarry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets (2002, Chris Columbus)\n\nI found this a bit better than the first movie. It's more exciting and darker in tone, but Columbus' direction is so vanilla\n\n5.5/10\n\nVal looks interesting. I didn't know poor Kilmer had throat cancer. Sad to see what life does to some people.\n\nPost by theravenking on\n\nFirst Time Viewing:\n\nClosed Circuit (2013; John Crowley) - Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall are lawyers defending a muslim terrorist in this low-key British spy drama. While the story has some potential the whole thing is just too ordinary to really engage the viewer.\n\n4/10\n\nThe Duel (2016; Kieran Darcy-Smith) - This western drama runs for almost two hours, but it feels at least twice as long. A marshall (Liam Hemsworth) is tasked with infiltrating the cult of a charismatic preacher (Woody Harrelson) who might be responsible for the deaths of some Mexican immigrants. Hemsworth is surprisingly convincing as the lead and Harrelson gives his best effort as the villain, but it's as exciting as watching paint dry.\n\n4/10\n\nEscape Room (2019; Adam Robitel) - The escape room sets are the best thing about this, but it takes some time to get to them. The character introductions are rather inane, and acting-wise no-one gets to shine here, with everybody relegated to falling into panic and screaming their lungs out. The ending is also a huge cop-out.\n\n5/10\n\nThe Fabulous Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1977; Juan Piquer Simón) - There is the classic version featuring James Mason and then there is cheap C-movie trash like this.\n\n4/10\n\nJourney To The Center Of Time (1967; David L. Hewitt) - Another take on the Jules Verne classic. Only recommended for completists or people suffering from insomnia.\n\n3/10\n\nLost Continent (1951; Sam Newfield) - Incredibly dull science-fiction movie about an expedition to a planet populated by dinosaurs.\n\n3/10\n\nThe Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians (1981; Oldrich Lipský) - Growing up I read a lot of Jules Verne, but I never got to The Castle in the Carpathians. I'm beginning to think that Czech movies are not for me. Just like Valerie - A Week Of Wonders this is a bizzarro trip into a weird world full of nonsensical happenings. Had I not read the synopsis I would've had no clue what was going on here.\n\n4/10\n\nMystery on Monster Island (1981; Juan Piquer Simón) - Jules Verne's name gets used again for a trashy piece of nonsense. Not even Peter Cushing and Terence Stamp can save this.\n\n4/10\n\nNot Safe For Work (2014, Joe Johnston) - Aka. the Blumhouse movie no one has ever heard of. An office worker (Max Minghella) is stuck in a building with a hitman (J. J. Fields) on the lose. It's an okay movie with some black laughs, but it's so by-the-numbers that it's hard to recommend.\n\n5/10\n\nThe Secret of Steel City (1979; Ludvik Ráza) - Another Czech Jules Verne adaptation, about two warring towns, this time the source material is rewritten to serve as communist propaganda.\n\n4.5/10\n\nWarlords Of Atlantis (1978; Kevin Connor) - This has some fun moments and my inner 12 year old wanted to like it, but I'm afraid I've grown out of films like this.\n\n6/10\n\nTV\n\nThe Terror- Season 1 (2018) - I have to admit that I abandoned the Dan Simmons novel this was adapted from after about a 100 pages, and was tempted to do the same with this series after the first two episodes. I still decided to stick it out to the end. It tells the story of the doomed Arctic expedition led by John Franklin (Ciaran Hinds). Based on a true story it adds some supernatural stuff which doesn't always work. It has good production values and excellent atmosphere, but the plot is a bit hard to swallow and most of the characters aren't exactly likeable. Jared Harris is a stand-out however making the viewer really emphasize with Francis Crozier.\n\n6/10\n\nRepeat Viewing:\n\nContraband (2012; Balthasar Kormakúr) - Better than average action thriller. I don't care much for Wahlberg, but I enjoyed this one.\n\n6.5/10\n\nSpy Game (2001; Tony Scott) - I didn't like this much when I first saw it and rewatching it now I still think that Tony Scott was the wrong choice of director for this. The movie is far too stylized for it's own good where especially in the war scenes a grittier more realistic approach would've been needed. The plot isn't terribly original or particularly meaningful either.\n\n6/10"
