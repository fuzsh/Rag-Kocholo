        "text": "1966.\n\nThe Beacon Street Union was part of the “Bosstown Sound,” a marketing campaign in 1968 for Boston bands who were newly signed to the music label MGM Records. It was a marketing strategy created to help the label recover from a financial crisis it had been experiencing. The idea for the “Bosstown Sound” came from independent producer Alan Lorber who had already signed two bands from the “Boston” area: Orpheus and Ultimate Spinach. In truth, the “Boston” rock music community was just developing and there was no overarching “Boston” sound or “Boston” style. There were a handful of individual established bands that were having some success, like The Lost, The Hallucinations, The Ramrods, The Barbarians, and Barry & the Remains. Newer bands were developing like Ultimate Spinach, Orpheus, Chameleon Church, Phluph, Ill Wind, and Beacon Street Union. The bands were gaining audiences from the large student population of college campuses in the Greater Boston area who were starting to discover them. And at the time, they were just starting to discover each other.\n\n1968\n\nBoston Cycles Ad.\n\nSouth End Incident Ad.\n\nWhere was the “The Eyes of the Beacon Street Union” LP recorded? How long did the sessions last? Would you share some recollections from the sessions? How pleased were you with the finished product?\n\nWe were very excited to be in the recording studio. We recorded those first tracks at the new Mirasound Studios in NYC. They had just installed the newly developed 16-track Ampex recorder. Wes Farrell was the producer and he had complete control. We really didn’t know anything about the recording process and were not really comfortable with all the isolation in the studio. We were a live band that keyed off of one another when we played. The recording process that Wes favoured really required separation of the instruments. Now he had 16 tracks to play with. He wanted each part recorded cleanly so he could mix the parts and add effects to them as he wished. We were kind of disappointed about how much our sound got manipulated by him in the studio. We also recorded at Mayfair Studios in New York with the innovative engineer, Gary Kellgren. Gary and Wes had a history of making hits together. But when we heard the final mixed tracks, we were upset because they didn’t sound like us.\n\nThe Eyes of the Beacon Street Union recording session.\n\nDid Beacon Street Union do any promotional tours? With whom did you share stages and where did you tour?\n\nWe were signed to Premier Talent, and they booked us on a cross-country tour to support MGM’s release of “Eyes of The Beacon Street Union.” Our first stop was The Grande Ballroom in Detroit. The MC5 was the opening act. We went on to play Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, Seattle, Vancouver, BC and Washington, DC where we opened for The Who. The tour ended in NYC back at Steve Paul’s The Scene where Wes Farrell had discovered us. It was a great homecoming celebration.\n\nThank you very much for taking your time. Last word is yours.\n\nBeacon Street Union was a spontaneous, collaborative reaction to a need that we all had at the time to experiment with music as a way to explore how we felt about cultural, socio-economic and political change that was happening during the mid-sixties. In true creative fashion, we struggled to express ourselves – – but at the same time, we were exhilarated by the pleasure of playing live music for audiences. We played with great energy and unabashed confidence. We argued about musical styles as we negotiated new musical directions. Sometimes we argued musically while we played. The result was the music we made together, for better or worse, it was who we were as a band.\n\nDick Weisberg."
