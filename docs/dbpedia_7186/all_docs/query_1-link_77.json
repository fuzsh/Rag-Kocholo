That same year, Brokaw was hired by NBC News, later becoming the anchor of their “Today” program in 1976. In 1982, he became the co-anchor of “NBC Nightly News” alongside Roger Mudd, the next year becoming the sole anchor of the program. Brokaw would then hold this position for 21 years until stepping down in 2004. From June 2008 to December 2008, Brokaw served as interim moderator of NBC’s top-rated Sunday morning public affairs program, “Meet the Press,” after the untimely death of its moderator, Tim Russert.

Earlier that same year, Brokaw traveled to the Asian subcontinent to report on the challenges Pakistan and Afghanistan faced as they fought the war on terror. In addition to interviewing both Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharraf and Afghan President Hamid Karzai while there, Brokaw joined the Pakistani army in their hunt for Al-Qaeda in the mountainous terrain along nations’ shared border. He also reported from southeastern Afghanistan, at the base of the 10th Mountain Division, where U.S. soldiers were not only hunting for Al-Qaeda, but trying to win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people as well. Brokaw has a distinguished record as a U.S. political reporter. He has interviewed every president since Lyndon B. Johnson and covered every presidential election since 1968. He was NBC’s White House correspondent during the Watergate scandal (1973-1976), and from 1984 to 2004 anchored all of NBC’s political coverage, including primaries, national conventions, and election nights.

Goodale, a leading First Amendment and communications lawyer, joined CPJ’s board of directors in 1989 and served as its board chair from then until 1994. During his tenure, he built CPJ into a significant international force to release imprisoned journalists. He substantially increased the organization’s budget and enlisted powerful members to join him on its board, including Tom Brokaw, Anthony Lewis, and Kati Marton. From 1967 to 1980, Goodale served as general counsel to and vice chairman of The New York Times. In 1971, he defended the Times in the Pentagon Papers Supreme Court case and won a resounding victory. The case’s outcome prevented the federal government from exercising prior restraint (censorship). Another of his cases, the landmark reporter’s privilege case to protect reporters’ sources, Branzburg v. Hayes, went to the Supreme Court the following year. Goodale’s article in Hastings Law Journal in 1975, an interpretation of Branzburg v. the U.S., spawned over 1,000 reported cases involving the recognition of such a privilege as well as the adoption by 39 states and D.C. of shield laws. He has accordingly been called the “Father of the Reporter’s Privilege.” Goodale brought reporter’s privilege and other First Amendment issues to the attention of lawyers and courts nationwide by means of his high-profile cases and creation of a “First Amendment Bar” through his chairmanship of a Communications Law Seminar at the Practising Law Institute in New York, which he ran for 40 years. The seminar became one of the largest of its kind in the U.S., coining the phrase “First Amendment lawyers.” In 1980, Goodale joined the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, where he founded two legal practice groups which were innovative for their time: “Corporate Media and Communications,” and “First Amendment and Intellectual Property Litigation.” He has represented scores of celebrities such as Tina Brown, Harry Evans, and George Plimpton and media companies including Cablevision, Time Inc., and Hearst. From 1995 to 2010, he produced and hosted a television show in New York called “Digital Age,” about the influence of the digital revolution on media, society and politics. Ben Bradlee, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., Henry Kissinger, Tom Brokaw, Michael Bloomberg, and others appeared as guests on the show. He has taught First Amendment and communications law at Yale, New York University, and Fordham University law schools for over 30 years and published nearly 200 articles on the First Amendment as well as two books: “The New York Times v. The U.S.” and “All About Cable,” a reference book that has been cited twice in the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2001, the Columbia Journalism Review named Goodale one of the 200 leaders who shape the national media agenda. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Goodale is a graduate of Yale and the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nPhoto credit: AFP\n\nSee all of our Board of Directors »\n\nSteven L.
