        "text": "One of the country's most famous comedians is coming back to Eastern Iowa this summer! Are you ready to Git-R-Done with Larry the Cable Guy?\n\nMost of us got to know Larry during his time with the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. He teamed with Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and Ron White to form the greatest redneck comedy tour of all time!\n\nLarry the Cable Guy will be bringing his unique brand of redneck humor, along with a suitcase of sleeveless shirts, to Cedar Rapids this summer! Larry will be playing at the McGrath Amphitheater in downtown Cedar Rapids on July 26th!\n\nLarry has released seven comedy albums, three of which have been certified gold. He has also starred in several movies including Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector, Delta Farce, and Witless Protection. While those movies might not have hit box office gold, his voice certainly did as Larry provided the voice of Mater in Disney's Cars movie franchise!\n\nOf course, Larry does have one thing going for him that is a negative for many in the Hawkeye state. He's from Nebraska and is a HUGE Cornhusker fan! I suppose we'll let that slide. Larry got the accent he uses in his act during his time at the University of Nebraska. He credits several roommates from Texas and Georgia for giving him the idea!\n\nTickets are still available to see Larry the Cable Guy on July 26th in Cedar Rapids. You can also enter to win a FREE pair of tickets below! Git-R-Done!"
