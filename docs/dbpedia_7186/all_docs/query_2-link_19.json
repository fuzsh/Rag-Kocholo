Raised on television sitcoms, he wants life to look just like My Three Sons. And when he meets single guy Steven Kovacs (Matthew Broderick), he sees his chance for some serious male bonding. But Chip's idea of friendship - which includes physical assault, a game of 'Porno Password' and a medieval joust - may be hazardous to Steven's health. In Chip's own immortal words, \"I can be your best friend... or your worst enemy.\" Directed by Ben Stiller (Reality Bites).",

        "text": "...on the whole The Cable Guy is about as subversive a mainstream comedy as youâ€™ll find...\n\nJune 14, 2022\n\nAs with Reality Bites two years earlier, director Stiller makes some astute observations about Generation X and its love of television - and media in general.\n\nJuly 20, 2021\n\nJust on paper Chip is an unsettling character, but it's Carrey who really brings him to horrifying life.\n\nJune 16, 2021\n\nThe hook to this weirdly compelling film is its teasing nature as a comedy of terrors.\n\nMay 12, 2020\n\nSure, in the title role [Carrey] plays another in-your-face, over-the-top, wild and crazy guy. But for once he is not a lovable goof. He is a rather unsavory psychotic. And the movie itself is not pure farce: it is satire, with a disturbing edge.\n\nMarch 22, 2019\n\nThe Cable Guy is a gutsy move on Carrey's part, suggesting a willingness to grow just where commercial good sense would say to stand pat.\n\nMarch 11, 2019\n\nWhile it makes a convincing case that too much television is ultimately brain-rotting, it does so with an unjustifiable smugness.\n\nMarch 11, 2019\n\nThis is a darker film for Carrey, but he's still Jim Carrey. His shenanigans keep even the blackest moments goofy.\n\nMarch 11, 2019\n\nAs a supposed summer blockbuster, this is a very eccentric film: The Cable Guy mocks its star as a pathetic jerk and comes close to telling its audience that we are, too.\n\nMarch 11, 2019"
