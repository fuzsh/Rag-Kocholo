        "text": "In truth, being so many things to so many people is all part of the fun and games and challenge of editing. For as Mr. Williams wisely says: “The day that an editor picks up a manuscript without some sense of anticipation is probably the last day he or she should be at work.”\n\nWhat Is an Editor?\n\nAn editor is so many things to so many people that this rhetorically questioning heading is virtually impossible to answer in any concise form. In addition, any one editor is likely to be cut from such radically different cloth from the next one that generalizing about character, somatotype, background, interests, or whatever would be as meaningless as grouping them by eye color. If form eludes us, then, function should be where we look for unifying aspects, and for those elements toward which writers peer in trepidation or hope, aversion or gratitude, contempt or respect and even affection.\n\nEditors in publishing houses can be perceived as basically performing three different roles, all of them simultaneously. First they must find and select the books the house is to publish. Second, they edit (yes, Virginia, they still do edit, no matter what cries you hear about bottom lines, heartless conglomerates, and the defeat of taste by commerce). And third, they perform the Janus-like function of representing the house to the author and the author to the house.\n\nThe first function–the editor as hunter-gatherer–is the one most vital to the editor’s own reputation and advancement, a point writers might particularly keep in mind. Editors want books; they are not there to demonstrate condescension to submitted writings, despite the flash of indignation experienced by almost everyone receiving a rejection letter. Indeed, the day that an editor picks up a manuscript without some sense of anticipation is probably the last day he or she should be at work. Whatever the endless winnowing (and it is estimated that only one in fifty manuscripts or proposals is accepted), the highest moments of exhilaration in an editor’s professional life come with discovery and acquisition.\n\nAuthors know how they are individually discovered, but even they can have only an incomplete idea of how wide the plains of editorial search can be. Agents are of course the first conduit that springs to mind, and it is true that in the last fifty years more than 80 percent of all trade books were, by informal estimate, agented. (It is also a truism that it is as difficult to find a good agent as a good publisher, which supposedly presents the aspiring writer with a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma. But it should be remembered that the agent has many potential outlets and the acquiring editor but one, so that the former can play with many more possibilities and talents than the latter.)\n\nThe earth has circled the sun many times since a well-known publisher could display on his office wall a beautifully wrought needlepoint sampler reading “The relationship between publisher and agent is that of knife to throat.” Cultivation of agents occupies a significant portion of an editor’s waking hours, nor should this be thought of as seeking out dueling opponents. Instead, editor and agent are better perceived as two points of a triangle, the author obviously being the third. No one editor can conceivably “cover” all agents, so that as time goes by both sides gravitate more and more to the individuals they have successfully done business with before, and with whom they tend to have common interests. And yes, the burgeoning of these relationships not necessarily, but often, begins over that much-abused institution the business lunch, undisturbed by telephone or fax.\n\nOf course, editors must cast their nets beyond the worlds of New York and California agenting, both for further gleanings and for their own fulfillment. Writers’ conferences, creative writing courses, university campuses at large, magazines both literary and popular, writers who know your writers, scouting trips at home and abroad, foreign publishers–these are only some of the fields to be tilled. Luck certainly plays a part, but even there, some skein of logical happenstance has usually put one in the way of meeting and acquisition. Simply living in a university town for many years afforded me encounters with a number of admirable authors. And it should be noted that after one published book, the unagented author, sometimes even at the suggestion of the publisher, more often than not ties up with an agent. Agents too are hunter-gatherers.\n\nSpecial mention should go to the books that are thought up by editors, usually works of nonfiction. The word will go out that a certain writer is looking for an idea, and an editor may have just the right biography or current controversy in mind. Or the editor may conceive it in the first place and try it on a likely author. (A famous example was Cecil Scott of Macmillan suggesting the subject of what became The Guns of August to Barbara Tuchman.) Series are another device joining authors to contracts they had not anticipated, and they are often the product of the fertile mind of an editor or publisher. To renowned editor Jason Epstein in his Doubleday days goes credit for inventing a whole new genre of publishing, the trade paperback.\n\nThen there are editorial meetings, forums of electric inspiration, Athenian discourse, mutual support–also of backbiting, grandstanding, and the sort of compliments that are thinly veiled put-downs. They are, in short, strictly mortal conclaves. However, beyond the requisite items of agenda and record keeping, they vary as much from house to house as the individuals themselves, from a highly formal tribune of decision to a free-for-all devoted in considerable part to trade gossip. No matter what their nature, they tend to define editors in their singularity, especially in terms of what proposals, suggestions, opinions, and brain-picks they choose to bring to a meeting. Collectively, the editorial meeting says much about publishers in terms of the weight and credence given to the editorial sector as well as to individual editors, the process of decision, even the spirit and morale of the house. Though they are discreet in nature, ideally restricted to editorial folk except by invitation to colleagues in marketing, subsidiary rights, publicity, and other departments, prospective or aspiring authors can learn much about a publisher by some discreet querying of their own.\n\nThe second function is the editor as therapist-nag or magic worker-meddler. However he or she is regarded, an editor is, or should be, doing something that almost no friend, relative, or even spouse is qualified or willing to do, namely to read every line with care, to comment in detail with absolute candor, and to suggest changes where they seem desirable or even essential. In doing this the editor is acting as the first truly disinterested reader, giving the author not only constructive help but also, one hopes, the first inkling of how reviewers, readers, and the marketplace (especially for nonfiction) will react, so that the author can revise accordingly.\n\n“\n\nTwo basic questions the editor should be addressing to the author are: Are you saying what you want to say? and, Are you saying it as clearly and consistently as possible? If these sound narrow at first glance, think further. They cover everything from awkward syntax and repetition, to the destruction of a novel’s impact through a protagonist’s behavior so unexplained and unmotivated as to be unintentionally baffling. All of this is of course subject to free and extended discussion and the author is the ultimate arbiter, as all responsible editors would agree. They would also concur that knowing when to leave things alone is as high an editorial skill as knowing when to suggest revision.\n\nDoes all this always work out in a glow of amity and constructive engagement? Certainly not, no more frequently than do love affairs. Overbearing, insensitive editors and mulish, unlistening authors, whether singly or in pairs, have caused many a shift of contract and failed book. Both species eventually tend to meet comeuppance and run out of partners. The more basic question, frequently alluded to in the press, and mentioned at the outset of this piece, is whether devoted editorial labor still takes place at all. This observer, at least, is convinced that it does, despite the undoubted increase in commercial pressure, the disappearance of the family (for which read: laid-back, kinder, gentler, in-it-for-literature) firm, and the swift currents of changing taste and accelerated technology. The fact is that the zest of the acquiring editor’s initial involvement can no more be separated from concern about the finished product than flesh and blood from bone. In that sense, the editorial animal remains unchanged no matter what the economies, working conditions, or amenity slashes. Editors do care, or they wouldn’t be there.\n\nThe eclectic nature of editorial taste, particularly in relation to nonfiction, deserves special mention. A wise man once remarked, only partly in derision: “A good trade editor can talk about anything for five minutes and nothing for six.” It is absolutely true that catholic interests are a more important qualification than any one college major, including English. It is also an ill-kept secret that a few reasonably adroit questions directed at a prospective author of known enthusiasms can seduce the answerer into thinking his questioners know a lot more than they really do. On the other hand, as time goes by, most editors become singled out for certain known passions of their own, be it horses, opera, horse operas, great battles, sports, cuisine, or horticulture. Again, this is an element of compatibility a reasonably inquisitive writer should be able to figure out ahead of time.\n\nThe third function–editor as Janus, or two-face–occupies most of the working editor’s office hours. (All serious reading and editing is done off premises, much of it nights and weekends; again, you have to love it to do it.) Unceasing reports, correspondence, phoning, meetings, business breakfasts, lunches, dinners, in- and out-of-office appointments leave active editors feeling like rapidly revolving doors as they attempt to explicate author and house to one another.\n\nAn editor is naturally the author’s first and leading advocate in dealing with his or her publisher. It begins with the editor’s initial enthusiasm for the project or novel and continues through acceptance by the house, negotiation of a contract, actual editing (where whatever real deepening of the relationship there will be tends to take place), and the publishing process itself, from copy editing, proofs, and production to sales and publicity. Throughout, the editor is usually attempting to bring as many relevant colleagues into the picture as possible, with the double purpose of interesting them in the book and author at hand, and of demonstrating to the author that a team of dedicated professionals, not just the editor, is devoted to the cause. Also, in this imperfect world, when late delivery, financial emergency, unexpected complexities of all kinds, intervene to prevent perfect fulfillment of a contract, it is the convinced editor who will argue the author’s case.\n\nAuthors should, and usually do, appreciate the fact that one of the editor’s most crucial challenges is to be able to articulate, clearly and appealingly, the signal virtues of a given book. From editorial reports on through catalog copy, jacket flaps, and publicity releases, it is the editor’s initial core descriptions that implicitly explain why the book has been chosen in the first place and explicitly set the tone for how a book will be perceived both in and out of the house. Writing this copy is for most editors a true sweat–it is so much more pleasurable to skewer bad writing than to attempt, against all odds, to find fresh ways to lay credible encomia on the newest addition to fifty-five thousand annual U.S. titles. A related trial is the sales conference two or three times a year wherein the enthusiastic editor must stand and deliver to a skeptical audience of sales representatives a pear-shaped oration on the virtues of the titles he or she sponsors. It is the agony of the schoolroom book report magnified a hundredfold.\n\nAs for explicating the house to the author, this is often Janus’s more minatory side. Economics does indeed seem a dismal science when the editor must repeatedly explain why a full-page ad in the Times Book Review, color illustrations, a coast-to-coast tour, or whatever is unwarranted and/or unaffordable and why even some of the more modest requests cannot be met. The sotto voce diplomatic drumbeat beneath all this is that there’s one partner (the publisher) on one side, and many (all the authors) on the other, and that time, energy, and resources must be allocated accordingly. Like polygamy, it’s not equitable, but a fact of a certain kind of life. At the same time, when some extra effort is made on a book or author’s behalf–midnight oil burned by a copy editor, an imaginative publicity break or unexpected special market ferreted out–it is up to the editor to be sure the author knows about it.\n\nTrying to define the role of the book editor in America without mentioning Maxwell Perkins (1884–1947) of Scribner’s can be likened to writing a short history of aviation without the Wright brothers, so pervasive is the image of the man who edited Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Thomas Wolfe, and so many others. Where is his like today? is the invariable echoing lament whenever his name comes up. There is justice in this, for few would compare themselves to Perkins, but it could be speculated, at the risk of sounding defensive, that if he were alive today, he would be spending far more time than he wanted cozening agents, working up competitive bids, scouting afar, and generally being distracted from the manuscripts at hand. He would thus have a much harder time being Maxwell Perkins, so to speak.\n\nBe that as it may, Perkins still remains the beau ideal of his trade. Nobody remotely interested in the role of editors or their relationship to writers should fail to read Editor to Author: The Letters of Maxwell Perkins, edited by John Hall Wheelock. With their warmth, eloquence, total empathy with authors, and gentle but keenly persuasive suggestions, these letters stand alone as lasting beacons to those who would follow. In writing of Thomas Wolfe and Perkins, the English critic Cyril Connolly, talking about editors, generously found it “unnecessary to point out that American publishers are a dedicated group: they are loyal, generous and infinitely painstaking; they live for their authors and not for social climbing, or the books they want to write themselves; they know how to be confessors, solicitors, auditors and witch doctors’.”* So be it.\n\nThe future, as Mort Sahl says, lies ahead, and the role of editors, like everything else, is bound to change. Corporate pressures for economies in overhead and benefits are likely to lead to more outside free-lance editing and diminished house staffs. It’s a toss-up question as to whether more or less editing in general will be needed. On the one hand, entropic degeneration of the language, diminished devotion to accuracy, and word processor bloat all cry out for increased editorial ministrations. On the other hand, the legions crying “Who cares?” show no signs of fading away either.\n\nTechnology, ever the burr under the saddle of stasis, is bound to invade the editorial sanctum, a process long overdue according to recent jeremiads by Jonathan Yardley, Jacob Weisberg, and others who cannot see why editors have not turned en masse to the computer. The trouble is that so long as editing remains a suggestive rather than a coercive procedure, editing must always leave its clear tracks. The word processor itself is an inarguable blessing when it comes to writing or rewriting one’s own copy, but when someone else’s is on the operating table, seamless alteration would both insult and confuse. In that sense, until economical and user-friendly hardware and software for marginal comment, visible deletions, and the like are invented, the Post-it will remain a more significant aid to working editors than the computer. And editors themselves will remain subject to the “joy, fulfillment, grief, and frustration” of their craft, hoping that their ultimately invisible labors will make a real and positive difference.\n\nThe Evolution of the American Editor\n\nMarc Aronson\n\nMARC ARONSON is a senior editor at Henry Holt’s Books for Young Readers. As an editor of ‘multicultural” nonfiction for middle graders and young adults, he has specialized in introducing adult trade authors to children’s book publishing. He is also writing a New York University history dissertation on William Crary Brownell and turn-of-the-century publishing. Mr. Aronson created and teaches a course in the history of publishing at NYU’s Publishing Institute. Among the authors he has worked with are Bruce Brooks, Coretta Scott King, and Kyoko Mori."
