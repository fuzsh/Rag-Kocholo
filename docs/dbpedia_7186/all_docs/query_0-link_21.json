        "text": "HOLLYWOOD has already rocked Alcatraz and blown away parts of Oklahoma; space aliens are poised to zap the White House in next month's \"Independence Day.\" But the true disaster movie of the summer may just be \"The Cable Guy,\" a grim, sour Jim Carrey comedy that erases the boundary between anarchic humor and sociopathic malice.\n\nThough this should have been an opportunity for Mr. Carrey to expand upon his runaway success and solidify long-term stardom, \"The Cable Guy\" instead offers the shocking sight of a volatile comic talent in free fall. Set free to indulge his inner infant, he abandons the gleeful mischief of his \"Ace Ventura\" days for a much nastier and less entertaining alter ego. Mr. Carrey, who won legions of fans just by speaking from his buttocks, now tries the creepy gambit of talking with a lisp, sneering at strangers, behaving like a deranged stalker and wallowing in sad, stale references to ancient television shows. The film's only unifying attitudes are misanthropy and contempt.\n\nSuch antics are sure to scare off part of Mr. Carrey's devoted following. (Don't even dream about \"The Cable Guy\" as a film for children. They'd be better off reading supermarket tabloids and watching the evening news.)\n\nYet the star's record-breaking fee for this film may not be unwarranted, provided that Hollywood sticks to its current credo: take the money and run. \"The Cable Guy\" may generate short-range big business on the strength of Mr. Carrey's past reputation, but there will be fallout from the fact that he has been paid $20 million for giving a scary, uneven performance that's often painful to watch. This is the way to kill a golden goose.\n\n\"I can be your best friend or your worst enemy,\" declares Mr. Carrey's insidious loner, a cable television repairman who develops a barnaclelike attachment to a customer named Steven Kovacs (Matthew Broderick, a solidly good straight man). Actually, this weirdo can be both, which is the basis for the film's intermittently satirical tone. The Cable Guy, whose various aliases recall the sitcoms of a baby boom childhood or Nick at Nite, is a pure creature of the television age, and the film suggests he is to be both pitied and tuned out. Beyond that, \"The Cable Guy\" quickly exhausts its deep thinking and is left with the spectacle of Mr. Carrey going out of control.\n\nFor instance: when the Cable Guy (despite an almost sexual fixation on his new friend) decides to help Steven win back a girlfriend (Leslie Mann), he tracks this woman to a restaurant where she is having dinner with a date. Lurking in the men's room, the Cable Guy then forces the date's head into a toilet. He plucks the date's eyebrows, dusts him with powder and forces him to suck on a hand dryer. When the date is forced down on the floor, the Cable Guy dances around him with glee.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
