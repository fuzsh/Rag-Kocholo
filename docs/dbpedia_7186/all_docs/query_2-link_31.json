        "text": "...on the whole The Cable Guy is about as subversive a mainstream comedy as youâ€™ll find...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jun 14, 2022\n\nAs with Reality Bites two years earlier, director Stiller makes some astute observations about Generation X and its love of television - and media in general.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Jul 20, 2021\n\nThe hook to this weirdly compelling film is its teasing nature as a comedy of terrors.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | May 12, 2020\n\nSure, in the title role [Carrey] plays another in-your-face, over-the-top, wild and crazy guy. But for once he is not a lovable goof. He is a rather unsavory psychotic. And the movie itself is not pure farce: it is satire, with a disturbing edge.\n\nFull Review | Mar 22, 2019\n\nThe Cable Guy is a gutsy move on Carrey's part, suggesting a willingness to grow just where commercial good sense would say to stand pat.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Mar 11, 2019\n\nAs a supposed summer blockbuster, this is a very eccentric film: The Cable Guy mocks its star as a pathetic jerk and comes close to telling its audience that we are, too.\n\nFull Review | Mar 11, 2019\n\nThose who like enjoy seeing performers open up their ids in the name of comedy might get a kick out of Carrey's spooky malevolence. Others, however, enter at their own risk.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B- | Mar 11, 2019\n\nIt barely matters that The Cable Guy fails [to satirize TV], because it is crammed with other pleasures, not least Carrey, who lets us glimpse the human being behind the sociopath.\n\nFull Review | Dec 12, 2018\n\nCarrey's life-of-a-bad-party manner is a major hoot as he toys with Broderick over legal and illegal installations.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Dec 12, 2018\n\nTo watch Carrey leering with joy at the prospect of making respectable people guess dirty words, and Broderick trying to avoid the whole thing, is to enjoy their best comic synergy.\n\nFull Review | Dec 12, 2018\n\nIn the hands of a smart director like Stiller, Carrey pushes his acting career to a new level here. The question is whether the comic's less daring fans are willing to go there with him.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Dec 12, 2018\n\n[The Cable Guy] is so repellent as to be almost literally unwatchable. This comedy isn't dark, it's extinguished. It isn't entertainment, it's pathology.\n\nFull Review | Dec 12, 2018\n\nMore than anything, The Cable Guy is simply uncomfortable. It's Ace Ventura as the evil bad guy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Dec 12, 2018"
