        "text": "Based in San Mateo, California, acoustic guitarist Steve Eulberg released his ninth solo recording in August 2019. The 13-track, 44 minute CD, called Between The Tracks is a fine offering of relaxing, modern solo guitar magic that serves up a wide range of jazzy and bluesy acoustic instrumentals. On the inside of the tastefully packaged digi-pak artwork you can see a picture of Steve with his nylon string guitar. Guitars featured on Between The Tracks include a Huss & Dalton DS and a Cordoba Fusion 14 Maple. Steves track by track anecdotes are accompanied by his detailed liner notes, which describe early guitar influences such as Mason Williams, well known jazzy, guitar-centric artists including Earl Klugh and Antonio Carlos Jobim, as well as finger-style, guitar-centric pop artists like John Denver and Jim Croce. In his notes, Steve cites the late great Pete Huttlinger, Tommy Emmanuel, Phil Keaggy, ragtime steel guitar ace Rev. Gary Davis and Leo Kottke. Theres also a classical influence and Steve cites reflective music from classical composer Debussy, while the lone cover here is Guitar Etude No.3, an instrumental track written by pop singer Dan Fogelberg. You can hear just about every type of solo guitar style, from folk and blues to jazz and even ragtime on Steve Eulbergs superbly recorded 2019 solo album Between The Tracks. www.SteveEulberg.com"
