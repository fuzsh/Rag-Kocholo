        "text": "WHEN “The Cable Guy” appeared in the summer of 1996, it seemed exactly the wrong movie for its star, Jim Carrey, and its director, Ben Stiller.\n\nMr. Carrey had just surged to stardom, playing innocent, lovably juvenile, socially isolated characters in a series of hugely successful comedies that included “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,” “The Mask” and “Dumb & Dumber.” In “The Cable Guy” he shifted gears. As a mysterious figure who may or may not be a professional installer of cable television named Chip Douglas (a character on the 1960s television series “My Three Sons”), he turned demonic, disturbingly infantile and dangerously sociopathic.\n\nThat wasn’t what audiences wanted that summer from a big commercial comedy (the eventual box-office comedy champ that year was Eddie Murphy’s benign remake of “The Nutty Professor”), and “The Cable Guy” — a tortured, sometimes violent, entirely despairing piece of work — received some scathing reviews.\n\nAlthough it turned a respectable profit (despite Mr. Carrey’s $20 million salary), the film had a negative impact on the careers of its creators. Mr. Carrey quickly retreated into conventional likability (“The Truman Show”) from which he has only recently begun to emerge. And Mr. Stiller was permitted to direct only two more films in the years that came after, the interesting but far less provocative “Zoolander” (2001) and the fierce Hollywood satire “Tropic Thunder” (2008). Judd Apatow, a producer of the film, went running for television (“Freaks and Geeks”) and crept back into movies only eight years later with “Anchorman”; the screenwriter, Lou Holtz Jr., hasn’t been heard from since.\n\nLooking back, “The Cable Guy” seems like a seminal film, not only for the careers it sputteringly helped to start (it contains early appearances by Leslie Mann, Jack Black, Janeane Garofalo, Andy Dick, David Cross and Owen Wilson) but also for the striking new tone it helped to establish. It was one of the first “cringe comedies,” in which the humor is grounded in the painful humiliations experienced by its protagonist — in this case, a wonderfully stoic Matthew Broderick, playing the unfortunate young real estate executive who, in a moment of moral weakness, tries to bribe his cable installer into giving him the movie channels free.\n\n“The Cable Guy” plays beautifully in the 15th Anniversary Edition just issued on Blu-ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. And the unusually extensive collection of deleted scenes and extended sequences make clear that the film was even darker and more daring at some point in its evolution, presumably before it started being chopped in reaction to preview audiences. The cut footage doesn’t appear to survive in a form good enough to be reintegrated into the film, though it does make it possible to imagine a perfect “Cable Guy.” (My version would stop before the tacked-on, vaguely reassuring ending, which is to say at precisely 1:28:56.)\n\nThe film runs along two tracks, which occasionally and regrettably (for the sake of thematic clarity) cross. On one level it is a pure Hitchcockian fable in which a minor transgression leads to cosmic punishment.\n\nWhen Steve Kovacs (Mr. Broderick) offers his $50 bribe for movie channels, he unwittingly conjures his personal devil, Chip, who becomes a projection of his darkest desires, a figure wholly analogous to the Robert Walker character in “Strangers on a Train.” Chip insists that he and Steve are best friends forever, forcing an intimacy that Steve (at first snobbishly, then with increasing justification) powerfully resents.\n\nAt the same time the film wants Chip to be the embodiment of all the evil that television has wrought on American culture. A flashback finds him as a child, being left to amuse himself in front of the TV while his mother (an unrecognizable Kathy Griffin) goes out to troll the bars. The boy’s inability to find a real-world equivalent to the synthetic love he experiences watching sitcoms seems to have driven him mad, a promising idea the film never fully develops. (For a more complete expression of that idea, see Joseph Ruben’s “Stepfather” from 1987.)\n\nMr. Broderick, our greatest living straight man, provides some impeccably underplayed partnering for Mr. Carrey, who here may give the most audaciously stylized performance of his career. Speaking with an exaggerated lisp, thrusting out his lower jaw in a way that makes him look like a Chester Gould creation, and twisting his body into poses known only to contortionists and cartoon characters, Mr. Carrey seems at times barely human — which I mean as a compliment. The movies have produced only a handful of comedians with this degree of physical control and the imagination to go with it. If Mr. Carrey had continued in this vein, we might have had another name to place alongside Chaplin, Keaton, Lewis and Tati.\n\nBut Mr. Carrey’s career, like comedy in general, has taken a different turn since the 1990s. Stylization has given way to a sort of desultory, sarcastic naturalism, in which the joke lies not in Carreyesque abstraction and amplification but in a kind of muttered, balloon-popping underreaction to preposterous events.\n\nIt’s an approach exemplified by Seth Rogen’s deflating asides in the current “Green Hornet,” or Michael Cera’s fetal blankness in practically anything. Mr. Carrey’s manic energy in “I Love You Phillip Morris,” released last year, proves that he still has the stuff; what’s missing is a vehicle as smartly engineered as “The Cable Guy” to let him show it off. (Sony, Blu-ray $24.95, PG-13; an earlier DVD edition remains in print, though without the new extras.)\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nBURLESQUE Christina Aguilera as a small-town girl who dreams of success as a lounge performer; Cher is the old pro who takes her under her capacious wing. With Cam Gigandet, Stanley Tucci and Kristen Bell; Steven Antin directed. “The old bump and grind receives a squeaky-clean workout in ‘Burlesque,’ a backstage tease-o-rama about life in and out of corsets and garters,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times in November. (Sony, Blu-ray $34.95, DVD $28.95, PG-13)\n\nLOVE AND OTHER DRUGS A pharmaceutical salesman (Jake Gyllenhaal) falls for a waitress with Parkinson’s disease (Anne Hathaway) in a romantic comedy directed by Edward Zwick. With Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria and Jill Clayburgh. The film sustains “its blend of melodrama, low comedy and graceful wit for a good hour or so,” but then succumbs “to treacle, evasion and maudlin convention at the end,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times in November. (Fox, Blu-ray $39.99, DVD $29.99, R)\n\nFASTER Fresh out of prison, a professional getaway driver (Dwayne Johnson) seeks revenge for the murder of his brother; a mismatched pair of police officers (Carla Gugino and Billy Bob Thornton) do their best to slow him down. George Tillman Jr. directed. The movie is “a turgid, ultraviolent parable of revenge and forgiveness, as muscle-bound as its monosyllabic antihero,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times in November. (Sony, Blu-ray $34.95, DVD $24.96, R)\n\n127 HOURS Five grueling days in the life of a mountain climber (James Franco) trapped under a fallen boulder in an isolated canyon. With Amber Tamblyn and Kate Burton; Danny Boyle (“Slumdog Millionaire”) directed. “To say that this movie gets under your skin is only barely a figure of speech,” Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in November. “It pins you down, shakes you up and leaves you glad to be alive.” (Fox, Blu-ray $39.99, DVD $29.98, R)\n\nTHE NORMAN CONQUESTS Tom Conti stars in a 1977 Thames Television adaptation of Alan Ayckbourn’s interlocking trilogy of plays, each set in a different part of the same house over the same weekend.
