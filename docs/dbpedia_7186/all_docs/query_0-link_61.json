Veit '28, a former executive v.p. of The New York Times Co. who helped usher the newspaper's circulation and promotion departments into the modern era, and co-founder and former chair of the COllege's Board of Visitors, died on November 27, 2004, in Beacon, N.Y. He was 96 and lived in nearby Millbrook, N.Y. [more]\n\nSteven Z. Miller M.D. '80: Respected Physician and Teacher\n\nSteven Z. Miller M.D. '80, '84 P&S, who served as director of pediatric emergency medicine at the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, died on October 19, 2004, in a plane crash near Kirksville, Mo., that also killed 13 other medical professionals. [more]\n\n1934\n\nRobert D.L. Gardiner, land owner, East Hampton, N.Y., on August 23, 2004. Gardiner was the last heir to bear the name of the family that has owned Gardiner’s Island — 3,350 acres, 27 miles of coastline, forests and streams, and buildings dating from the 17th century — off the coast of Long Island, for nearly four centuries. Born in New York on February 25, 1911, Gardiner attended St. George’s School in Newport, R.I. He attended NYU Law School and in WWII served as a Navy lieutenant and saw action in the South Pacific. After the war, Gardiner worked on Wall Street at the Empire Trust Co. and served for many years on the Suffolk County Planning Board. He ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for the State Senate in 1960. According to The New York Times, Gardiner called himself “the 16th Lord of the Manor” and saw himself as a custodian of his family’s history on what is said to be the largest privately owned island in the world. Gardiner lived in East Hampton, in an opulent family house with a long history, but his heart was rooted in the island, which is in the bay off Long Island’s south fork. The island has been in Gardiner’s family since his ancestor, the English settler Lion Gardiner, bought it from the Montaukett Indians in 1639 for “one large dog, one gun, some powder and shot, some rum and several blankets, worth in all about Five Pounds sterling.” Although the island is off-limits to the public, Gardiner took occasional visitors there in his boat, the Laughing Lady, often surprising them by talking about Colonial-era events as if they just happened. Through the years, Gardiner feuded with family members about ownership of the island but continued to visit it after a judge overturned a ruling that he could not. He is survived by his wife, Eunice Bailey Oakes, whom he married in 1961.\n\n1938\n\nAdolph F. “Lefty” Meisen, retired college dean and history instructor, Oceanside, Calif., on August 22, 2004. A New York City native, Meisen was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the College and a 1939 graduate of GSAS, where he earned a master’s in history. A scholarship from the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation helped finance further studies at North Carolina, where he received his doctorate. After teaching for a year at Mississippi, Meisen joined the Stanford faculty for three years and taught Western civilization courses. His next, and final, teaching stop was Carlsbad Junior College, which was his “home” from 1949 until his final retirement in 1987. In 1964, the school moved from Oceanside High to a 121-acre campus of its own and became known as MiraCosta College. When Meisen retired in 1982 as v.p. of instruction, he was remembered for his avid support of MiraCosta athletics as well as for his academic innovations, which included a major expansion of vocational courses to meet the community’s changing needs. “Lefty came here when everybody on the faculty did everything,” Bill Foran, who joined the school’s faculty in 1951 and retired in 1987 as v.p. of student services, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “He taught me an awful lot about being an administrator. He was instrumental in moving to our new site and did a marvelous job of making it into a community college. … Whatever he said, he meant. And he followed through.” As second in command at MiraCosta, Meisen scheduled classes, designed curriculum, hired faculty and evaluated instruction. Meisen became president of the Carlsbad Rotary Club and played golf regularly at El Camino Country Club until undergoing a hip replacement four years ago. Survivors include his wife, Gloria; sons, Barry, Peter and David; and a grandson. Memorial contributions may be made to Tri-City Hospice or the Carlsbad Rotary Club.\n\n1940\n\nHarry Schwartz, writer, New Rochelle, N.Y., on November 10, 2004. Schwartz was born in New York City on September 10, 1919. He studied economics at the College, graduating as valedictorian, before earning a master’s in 1941 and Ph.D. in 1944, both in economics, from GSAS. Schwartz was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Drafted into the Army in 1943, Schwartz was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services, which preceded the C.I.A, and sent to Europe as a specialist in Soviet economic intelligence. He was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1945. Following his military career, Schwartz became an economics professor. He spent most of his career as “a government economist, a military intelligence analyst, a professor of economics and international affairs at several universities and the author of 22 books,” reported The New York Times, for whom he worked from 1951–79 as an editorial writer and specialist in Soviet and East European affairs. In the 1970s, in part because of a son’s illness, Schwartz’s interests turned increasingly toward health policy; he argued that the increasing socialization of medicine would erode the quality of health care. During the next two decades, Schwartz wrote about infant mortality, organ transplants, heart disease, AIDS and other health-related matters. Among his publications were Russia’s Soviet Economy (1951), The Red Phoenix (1961), Prague’s 200 Days (1969) and The Case for American Medicine (1972). Schwartz is survived by his wife, the former Ruth E. Blumner, whom he married in 1941; sons, John ’66 and Robert ’75; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\n\n1942\n\nErnest “Sandy” Black, retired journalist and PR consultant, Naples, Fla., on October 6, 2004.
