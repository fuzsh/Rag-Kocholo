        "text": "When Graydon Carter started his digital newsletter, Air Mail, in 2019, the initial advertisers included Hermès, Ralph Lauren and Standard Industries.\n\nThe first two names on that list made perfect sense, given the worlds of Hollywood, celebrity and international society that Mr. Carter covered exhaustively while he was editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years — a mix he has since transported to Air Mail.\n\nThe third was a head scratcher. Standard Industries? It sounded like a shadowy multinational corporation in a James Bond film.\n\nBy 2021, Standard was not only an advertiser in Air Mail but also an investor in the publication. That year, while speaking to a reporter from Business Insider, Mr. Carter shed some light on his publication’s new benefactor. He described Standard as “a very glamorous roofing company.”\n\nOver the past few years, Standard, described on its website as a “global industrial company,” has become a backer of several media start-ups in addition to Air Mail.\n\nThey include Pushkin Industries, the podcasting network co-founded by Malcolm Gladwell; Cabana, a lushly produced twice-yearly shelter magazine and e-commerce site; Spiegel & Grau, a book publisher established by two veteran Random House publishers; and Puck, a digital publication that covers wealth and power and has a profit-sharing arrangement with its writers.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
