Steven Weisberg, a film editor whose career through the ’90s onward led him to collaborations with directors like Alfonso Cuarón, Barry Sonnenfeld and Barry Levinson, died Oct. 16 at the Motion Picture & Television Fund hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. after several years of care for early onset Alzheimer’s. He was 68.

Weisberg’s death was confirmed by his ex-wife, Susan Ellicott.

Two of Cuarón’s early films, “Great Expectations” and “A Little Princess,” were edited by Weisberg. The two reunited for a foray into franchise filmmaking, “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.”

Weisberg also had a knack for editing studio comedies, with his first major feature credit being Ben Stiller’s directorial debut, the 1996 thriller “The Cable Guy.” Other notable credits include a string of Barry Sonnenfeld projects — the short-lived 2001 live-action series “The Tick” and his features “Big Trouble” and “Men in Black II” — as well as “Permanent Midnight,” Neil LaBute’s “Nurse Betty,” Susan Stroman’s “The Producers,” Barry Levinson’s “Man of the Year,” Roger Michell’s “Morning Glory” and Rodrigo Garcia’s “Albert Nobbs.” Weisberg’s final credit came in 2012 with the Meryl Streep-Tommy Lee Jones two-hander “Hope Springs.”

Weisberg was born on Jan. 16, 1955 in New York City and received degrees from Syracuse University and Binghamton University. He began working as an editor in the 1980s, with his first credit coming in 1987 as an associate editor on “Gaby: A True Story.” He worked under his banner Lush Meadow Productions beginning in 2008.

Weisberg is survived by his sons, Nathaniel and Joseph.
