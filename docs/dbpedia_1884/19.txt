And here we go again why'all callin in reinforcements The Mobb come through, stop up the shit P'll come through and shot up your vest Shoot at your head, not-a-leg eh? Nigga I will kill your bitch Then f*ck her and make you watch We do thangs, like raid spots Probably catch you on the Hummer, just give you my glock (Here) Or most likely in the club, we gon' give you them knots This is what gangsters dance to, or turn to a thug party Once we step foot in the bitch, it's on again Outside we got them boxy trucks Hoes want to jump, cause of that Benz emblem The hoe say she want to ride in the shit with the horse logo I got her out of her panties and boom boom And I done left bitches out in the boonies Frontin on that pussy, leave bodies wherever Niggaz tryin to kill me? Yo, we livin this 'til the day that we die Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive We livin this 'til the day that we die Survival of the fittest nigga, and we still alive We livin this 'til the day that we die Survival of the fit - nigga we still alive We livin this 'til the day that we die Survival of the fit only the strong.. No doubt, my niggaz hold me down whenever in beef Talkin all that bullshit but it's the hammer that roast If your shit ain't clappin off then you sure to lose Aiyyo the streets don't give a f*ck about you For you ain't bendin the rules Come around lookin icey then you runnin the jewels Nigga you ain't gotta like me, homey get your food ate The whole plate, rip a fella ear to ear I'm talkin his whole face And scream my name, cause it hold weight You cowards are jealous Glass slipper wearin niggaz we call 'em Cinderellas Gonna be a slug shower and there ain't a umbrella that can help you protect that ass from gettin wet I can see it in your eyes, your bitch ass is pet Home team I'ma promise and you cowards ain't a threat Introduce a fella to death, in the form of chrome Nigga, now you in the danger zone Aiyyo thug life we still livin it
