        "text": "Prodigy, half of the hip hop duo Mobb Deep, has died from complications of sickle cell anemia at the age of 42.\n\nHis representative said “Prodigy was hospitalized a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by a sickle cell anemia crisis. As most of his fans know, Prodigy battled the disease since birth. The exact causes of death have yet to be determined.”\n\nProdigy was born Albert Johnson in Hemptstead, NY, the son of Crystals member Fatima Johnson, the grandson of bebop player Budd Johnson and great-nephew of Keg Johnson.\n\nIn 1992, he joined with Havoc (aka Kejuan Muchita) as Poetical Prophets, releasing an independent demo, Flavor of the Non-Believers. The next year, they were signed to 4th & Broadway Records for their debut album, Juvenile Hall. Although the album did not chart, the second single, Hit It From the Back, reached 18 on Rap Singles.\n\nTwo years later, they moved to Loud Records where their album The Infamous went to 18 on the Billboard 200 and 3 on the R&B charts on the strength of the singles Shook Ones (Part II) (1994 / #59 Pop / #52 R&B / #7 Rap) and Survival of the Fittest (1995 / #69 Pop / #60 R&B / #10 Rap).
