        "text": "„Kick me whilst I‘m down or tied to a tree / their methods are complex, I ain‘t got it sussed / they‘ll go all night til I‘m paggered to dust.“\n\nLeaving your footprint in a crowded scene like hardcore punk is not very easy. Especially when tons of bands pop out of nowhere each year. Big Cheese are definitely not one of those bands who do disappear after releasing a demo and playing two or three shows. They’ve been around for a couple of years now, released a critical acclaimed EP in 2017 on Quality Control Records, home of UKHC, and toured Europe not only with Illusion, but also with Culture Abuse and Mere Mortal.\n\nTheir first full length is named after a science fiction movie from the 70s: “Punishment Park”. The movie, which is widely unknown to most people outside of the United States, creates a horrifying vision of the future: The Vietnam War evolved into a new World War and the United States became a military dictatorship. Those who won’t follow the governmental rules will be arrested into so called Punishment Parks, where only the strong will survive.\n\nSurvival of the fittest one of hardcore’s most favorite lyrical themes, not only because of bands like Biohazard or Terror, which celebrate social-darwinism to the fullest since many years. But with Big Cheese, the topic gets a new critical approach. With “Punishment Park” they ask “Why must always the strong (or rich) survive?” and try to give answers to the listeners.\n\nThe reason why society is corrupted is based on the system we live in. And that’s what “Punishment Park” is about. We must overcome it, by all means necessary. With songs like the religious-critical „Tower To The Sun“ or the socio-critical „Mad At The World“, Big Cheese try to make their statement. They sometimes sound like Killing Time or Rest In Pieces and showcase what hardcore can be capable of in 2020. Groovy like hell mosh-parts, which can be found in the opener “Penine Scrubs”, are one of the best things you will get to hear in hardcore this year, that’s fore sure.\n\nWhen you listen to “Punishment Park”, you get the feeling of being thrown back into the gritty streets of New York City in the early 90s. With it’s thrash-esque riffing and aggression in songs like “Heartbreak Ball” you can’t simply layback in front of your stereo, this is meant to be played loud and dirty and let your hair grow by at last five centimeters."
