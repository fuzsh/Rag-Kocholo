        "text": "Many groups have came , but few placed their imprint on the genre like Mobb Deep. Coming out of the Queensbridge Houses, the prodigious duo — consisting of Prodigy and rapper/producer Havoc — originally met as classmates at the Manhattan High School of Art and Design and decided to join forces under the Poetical Prophets and recorded a demo that landed the baby-faced teenagers a spot in Source magazine’s Unsigned Hype column. Inking a deal with 4th & Broadway Records and making the name-switch to Mobb Deep, the pair released their debut album, Juvenile Hell, in 1993 to little fanfare and was deemed a commercial brick, leading to Havoc and Prodigy being released from their contract.\n\nThe situation was dire and a harsh introduction to the ways of the record industry, but the duo quickly bounced back, landing a deal with Loud Records and heading back in the studio to record their sophomore LP, The Infamous. While Juvenile Hell featured outside beat-smiths such as ’90s heavyweights DJ Premier and Large Professor, Havoc — who had produced five tracks on their debut — took over a majority of the production duties on this outing, crafting all but one track on the album. Fellow Queens native, Q-Tip, served as a co-pilot behind the boards as well, assisting Havoc in refining his skills as a boardsman, which accounts for the similarities between some of the soundscapes found on The Infamous, and A Tribe Called Quest’s 1996 effort, Beats, Rhymes, Life.\n\nThe Infamous also displayed a huge growth in both rappers’ depth as MC’s, especially Prodigy, who delivered his verses with flawless execution and instantly evolved into one of the most highly regarded rhyme animals of the era. Havoc also saw improvement in his lyrical aptitude and played the co-pilot position just about as well as anyone that comes to mind. Keeping it light on the features, the Mobb did make sure to bring in a few of their like-minded homies that happened to be rap stars, including Nas, Raekwon, and Ghostface Killah, resulting in classic material such and set the foundation for many collaborations between all parties in the future. In vintage Queens fashion, Havoc and P also brought in their neighborhood cronie Big Noyd, who contributed one of the most memorable rap verses of 1995 and landing a record deal of his own off of his performance on the album.\n\nTouching down on April 25, 1995, The Infamous was met with much critical praise, going on to receive four-and-a-half mics in Source Magazine and achieving Gold certification by summer of ’95, a stark contrast to their debut album and clearing up any notions of them being busts. Running sixteen-tracks long, Infamous was an unfiltered view into the life of an inner-city teen living nihilistic and without regard for anything but getting paid and weathering the storms of the streets. Tales of shoot-outs, trips upstate, and friends lost are a constant theme and a display of the paranoia and Darwin-esque mind-state of a young man residing in New York City’s plethora of housing projects. Few smiles are cracked and danger is always lurking and rearing its remorseless head.\n\nIn 2020, a lot of things have changed, not just in Queensbridge, but in hip-hop as a whole. No longer are albums with the aesthetic that Infamous speaks to dominant in the conversation and revered as the cream of the crop. Just look at a plethora of indie artists today, including Roc Marci and Brownsville Ka, both of whom are more than capable of concocting classic ditty’s with a similar feel to Havoc and Prodigy’s magnum opus. Being that its anniversary is right around the corner, I’ve decided to take up the daunting task of ranking Mobb Deep’s The Infamous from top-to-bottom according to how well they stand the test of time lyrically and sonically. While there is not a subpar track featured on the album, there has to be a winner, meaning there has to be a loser, so with that being said, lets get to business.\n\n13. “The Start Of Your Ending”\n\nUpon popping The Infamous into your tape-deck, you’re immediately met by a chilling sample of Grant Green’s “Maybe Tomorrow and dingy percussion on the Infamous’ opening salvo, “The Start Of Your Ending (41st Side).” Havoc sets it off swiftly, rhyming “Cock back the gat and do a n — — like a big / 25, nah, kid, ya’ getting life / Forever burning in hell, n — — — is trife” and showing that this outing would be a big improvement on their debut release, Juvenile Hell, and that they came with their A-Game.\n\nProdigy picks up any slack that was left on the intro verse when he touches the mic and levels up with addictive bars, like “Who you wastings slugs, you ain’t buckin’ nothing / You better off bucking ya’ self, you need to stop fronting / I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine / Littles painted it black for crack sale intentions / To blow up, the whole projects, the infamous / Sons to grow up to be murderers and terrorists”and instantly displaying his growth as a lyricist. While someone had to be the first loser, “Start Of Your Ending” is far from a snoozer and is more memorable than entire albums, if we’re being honest here, but sadly gets that distinction in this case.\n\n12. “Up North Trip”\n\nMobb Deep take a trip to the state pen, get in a shootout, and cook-up crack on the “Up North Trip.” Prodigy gives a glimpse into the mind-state of an inmate riding the prison bus to one of the many notorious prisons in upstate New York. Havoc has blood in his eye on this outing and pays a visit to a foe of his to give him the murder murder business. But the highlight of the track is Prodigy’s introspective verse on this end, during which he questions the lifestyle he’s living while cooking up a batch of crack. Rhyming “In the form of oil, watch the cocaine boil / keep my eyes on it so the s — — won’t spoil / Then I pause and ask God why / Did he put me on this earth just so I could die? / I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong / Why I’m breathing and all my friends gone” he closes out the ceremonies with a little food for thought and serves as a rare moment of clarity in-between their criminal capers.\n\n11. “Party Over”\n\nCelebrations and festivities get snuffed out on The Infamous’ closeout track, “Party Over,” which features an appearance by Rapper Big Noyd. Starting off with the war call,”Yo, P, it’s on you, what you gon’ do / Whatever, party’s over, tell the rest of the crew,” the trio each deliver a menacing 16 and end the album on a high note. Prodigy leads the charge with his usual brand of nihilistic musings, describing his shank game with the lines “Put ice on a razor and freeze you in ya shoulder / I went for ya grill, but you dipped from my boulder / I know this kid that says he knows ya / Because of that, now I know where you lay ya head at and that’s that” before handing the mic over to Havoc.\n\nBig Noyd comes correct as well, rapping “My beeper kept beeping, the other number started leaking / Who is this’ on my mind I was thinking / Then I realized it was my dun putting 911 / Once I seen the numbers, I ran for the f — — — — guns,” again utilizing his air-time to the fullest. Driven by a sample of Miles Davis’ “Lonely Fire” and featuring some of the dirtiest drums known to man.\n\n10. “Drink Away The Pain” featuring Q-Tip\n\nThe pride of Queensbridge tackle their vices face-to-face on the upbeat “Drink Away The Pain.” Prodigy runs down his list of drinks of choice and characterize them as his lovers. Spitting “I Used to be in love with this b — — — named E&J / Don’t f — — with her no more, now I f — — wit Tanqueray / Tanqueray introduced me to her cousin, Gold / Last name was English and the first name Old,” he delivers and impressive verse and proves he’s more than just guttural gun talk and crime tales.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest front-man Q-Tip — whom played an integral part in the making of Infamous as a whole — appears on the record as well, but opts to center his verse around clothing brands rather than alchoholic beverages. Beginning his verse by rhyming “Tommy Hil was my n — — -, and others couldn’t figure / How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor / Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures / Said a Brinx is coming through at Fashion Avenue / On Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew / Of Muthaf — — — — who ain’t going out like suckers” and may have served as a precursor to Ghostface Killah’s famed cartoon-character caper on “The Forest.”\n\nHavoc serves as the anchor and turns in a serviceable verse, but honestly falls a bit short on this outing in comparison to his costars. And while Prodigy initially wasn’t sold on Q-Tip’s verse, thankfully the rap God’s stepped in, as it gives the song an added wrinkle and serves as a pleasant surprise til this day.\n\n9. “Cradle To The Grave”\n\n“Forever wild, from the grave / Kid, watch ya back, one-times coming all ways / They locked me up for 12 days, I can’t comprehend / Now I’m a free man on these streets again,” Prodigy states on the opening bars of the blood-in-blood-out testimonial, “Cradle To The Grave.” On a missing of vengeance on a rival faction for slaying a member of their squad, things take a turn from the worst as Havoc and a fellow crimey get caught slipping, leading to another member of their squadron being slain. Rhyming “He was bleeding from the head, I couldn’t believe it / We was defeated, if it was a case, we couldn’t beat it/ I Felt like crying (the temperatures rising) / I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dying,” Hav passes him gun to P, who came to alert them of cops lurking.\n\nWhile transporting the contraband back to the project building, the cops almost get the drop on him, painting the picture with vivid lyrics like “Jetted up the staircase to the third floor / Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor / Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw / Said ‘where’s the gun we saw?’/ We know you was there at the homicide scene / And if it wasn’t you, it was somebody from ya team,” but ultimately is saved by the locked door and completes this stand-out selection.\n\n8. “Right Back At You” featuring Raekwon, Ghostface Killah & Big Noyd\n\nBig Noyd and the Shaolin version of a ’95 Shaq and Penny pop up on the drowsy thumper, “Right Back At You.” Rapping “I’m lost in the blocks of hate, and can’t wait / For the next crab n — — to step and meet fate / I’m lethal when I see you, there is no sequel / 24–7, Mac-11 is my peoples,” Prodigy wastes no time letting his gun flash and immediately sets the tone. Havoc and Noyd come correct as well, but the true draw of this selection is Raekwon and Ghostface Killah’s marvelous contribution to close out the proceedings. “Who’s the richest nigga in the projects, who got it locked / Rocking convertibles, drop-tops and mad hot” signals the dynamic duos arrival, and they give a preview of the greatness that would be featured on their collaborative Only Built 4 Cuban Linx project later that year.\n\n7. “Temperature’s Rising” featuring Crystal Johnson\n\nThe official Queensbridge Murderers spin a tale about a member of their crew that’s on the run from the police after committing a homicide on the enticing “Temperatures Rising.” Havoc bats lead-off on this cut and informs their homie that there’s a snake in the crew, rapping “It’s all messed up, somebody’s snitching on the crew / And word is on the street is they got pictures of you / Homicide came to ya crib last night, six deep / Asking bout ya wherabouts and where you sleep” and sending him a care package through Western Union to survive on the lam. Prodigy sends his own kite to his dun in which he laments the impact that the QB Projects corrupted them and reaffirming his loyalty with lyrics like “Years ago when we was younger. seen the hood took us under / Very deep, wondering who’s snitching got me losing lots of sleep at night / You know my mouth is tight / I’ll never sing to the cops cause that s — — ain’t right.”\n\nPowered by a sample of Patrice Rushen’s “Where There Is Love” and featuring a stellar performance by vocalist Crystal Johnson, “Temperature’s Rising” sees Hav and P putting down the guns and showing a little crew-love and support, which has always been the QB way. An interesting tidbit is that this song was actually inspired by Havoc’s now deceased brother and former QB goon, Killer Black, who was in the middle of some legal trouble of his own during the recording of The Infamous.\n\n6. “Trife Life”\n\nQueensbrige meets Bed Stuy, Brooklyn when Mobb Deep perform the art of storytelling on “Trife Life.” Containing a sample of Norman Connors “You Are My Starship” “it’s just another day, drowning my troubles with a 40 / that’s when I got a call from this brown skin shorty / She asked me where my crew at, said we can do whatever / She gotta crew too and said that we should get together.” And while P obliges, he has his reservations and smells a setup. Deciding to see the situation through, him and a few crimeys catch the G Train to Myrtle-Willoughby, only to find a suspicious car waiting and retreat back to the bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the bridge, Havoc is plotting on a visitor to his projects coming through to see his girlfriend, but little does he know, trouble is around the corner. Rhyming “You’re leaving out the bulidng as you kiss your girl goodbye / Thought you was safe and got caught by surprise / ‘What’s gong on, as I reply / ‘Shut the f — — up and don’t make this to another homicide” before shooting the victim and taking his chain for resisting the juxe. Just another day in the infamous QB Houses.\n\n5. “Q.U. Hectic”\n\nHavoc, Prodigy, and company run into a little confrontation with some Brooklyn cats during a trip to the liquor store on the brooding “Q.U. Hectic.” Setting it off with hard-boiled bars like “I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as man / And taught to use my hands for protection in scuffles / Throwing my blows in doubles / I’m coming from Queens muthaf — — — — — carrying guns in couples,” Prodigy goes for broke all over the drum-heavy production.\n\nHavoc catches wreck as well, spitting “That’s my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless / Grab my Mac and smack a n — — senseless / Don’t try to play me, if you do, you better D.O.A. me / Son, I got em shook, grabbing little babies for shields” and stating the cold facts with the lines “But wait, it gets realer / Real like an innocent child that’s turned killer / It’s things like that that only make things iller / Doing sticks making cream if you ain’t a drug dealer. Full of grisly quotable-after-quotable, “Q.U. Hectic” sees The Mobb getting the job done with little survivors remorse included.\n\n4. “Eye For An Eye” featuring Nas & Raekwon\n\n“Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list,” Prodigy barks on the opening bars of “Eye For An Eye” before going in on the opposition with little remorse. Rapping “N — — — tried to creep on the side of my jeep / Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep / Over a 3-Pack, it was a small thing really, yeah / But keep letting them small things go will be ya failure” With a hook that doubles as a oath of brotherhood, on which they chant “As time goes by, an eye for an eye / We’re in this together, son. your beef is mine / As long as the two hands can load up a nine / We in this together son, your beef is mine,” is as chilling as it is effective. Havoc picks up where P left off with a solid verse before making way for Nasir, who delivers one of the more guest verses of his career.\n\nOne of his first sightings since releasing his own debut, Illmatic, the year before, Esco shines throughout the entirety of tthe verse, spitting “Wassup to all my n — — — — swerving through New York metropolis / The Bridge brings apocalypse, shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watching us / Mad-man, my sanity is going like an hour glass / Gun inside my bad hands, I slice, tryna bag grams / I know hoes who used to milk you, n — — — — who couldn’t killed you / That’s down with my ill crew of psychos.” Raekwon plays Mariano on the track and closes the selection out with talk of candle-lights and fiends with crack-pipes, culminating what has gone on to be seen as a classic pairing of some of New York’s finest talent at the time.\n\n3. “Survival Of The Fittest”\n\n“Sending this one out to my man, Killa B. No doubt indeed, where that weed?”\n\nWith that timeless intro, Havoc and P proceed to prove that the hood version of Darwinism is in full-effect on “Survival Of The Fittest” and sees the Mobb hitting on all cylinders over a sinister soundbed. “There’s a war going on outside no one is safe from” raps Prodigy, before continuing “You can run, but you can’t hide forever from these streets that we done took / Ya’ walking wit ya head down, scared to look, ya’ shook” and getting into the thick of yet another superb 16 bars.\n\nHavoc is steady as ever and sheds light on how identity theft can serve as a get-out-of-jail-free card, rapping “No doubt, watching my back and proceed with caution / 5–0 lurking, no time to get lost in / The system, n — — — using fake names to get out quick / My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces” and speaking on the downsides of doing a prison-bid. While only featuring two verses, “Survival Of The Fittest” stands as one of the more revered tracks by Mobb Deep die-hards and gets a positive reaction from hard-rocks and hip-hop junkies a lot.\n\n2. “Shook Ones Pt. 2\"\n\nThere isn’t much to say about the greatness that is “Shook Ones Pt. II” that hasn’t been spewed by some critic or listener out there. Simply put, this record is one of the most un-fuck-wittable tracks to ever grace this earth. Produced by Havoc and featuring a slew of samples, which he manipulates into a sinister backdrop, QB’s favorite sons wax poetic about stabbing folks’ brains with their nose-bones, flipping off E&J in a drunken stupor, and their disdain for halfway crooks. Arguably the most recognizable song that the group have ever recorded and the go-to record when mentioning The Infamous, “Shook Ones Pt. II” could’ve played in a Alfred Hitchcock flick, was a club banger in ’95, is still presence today, and is sure to catch plenty of burn even fifty years from now. If that isn’t what you refer to as a classic, then we don’t know what to tell you.\n\n1. “Give Up The Goods (Just Step)” featuring Big Noyd\n\n“Shook Ones Pt, 2” may be one of the hardest records in rap history, but just misses the top slot on this list. That bragging right would go to “Just Step (Interlude)”/”Give Up The Good (Just Step).” I know a few heads out there may take umbrage with us combining the interlude and the actual, but we make the rules here and if we’re really being honest, one isn’t fully complete without the other and it would be asinine for us not to. With that qualifier aside, the track is flawless, beginning with Noyd’s vivid verse about an appointment with his probation officer and a pending court case, which ended up as being more reality than fiction and serves as the shining moment in his spotty career.\n\nFrom the moment you hear the recognizable phrase “Queens get the money, longtime no cash,” you’re instantly drawn into the criminal minded mentality that Mobb Deep embodies as Prodigy rattles off his opening verse and ups the ante even more, rapping “Cause having cash is highly addictive / Especially when your used to having money to live with / I paused, stepped back, looked at my life as a whole / Ain’t no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul / I’m out for ‘delphia, ‘selfia, P’s not helping ya’ / I’m tryna’ get this Lexus up plus a cellular.” Big Noyd comes back out swinging with a show-stealing verse that can still be recited verbatim by any rap fanatic worth their salt\n\nHavoc also gets a piece of the lyrical pie, rapping “The streets is real, can’t roll without steel / I feel how I feel cause I was born to kill / Do what I gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starving / Not tryna find a job, son, it’s all about robbing” and remains as troublesome as ever and paints his mindstate over the canvas that is the plush soundscape, courtesy of Q-Tip. Infamous stands as one of the greatest rap albums released ever and “Give Up The Goods” serves as its crown jewel and embodies everything that the album conveys. Now, excuse us as we put this classic on repeat and mob out with our imaginary crimeys and thuns."
