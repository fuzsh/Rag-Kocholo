        "text": "As Mobb Deep's primary producer, Havoc created the backdrop for The Infamous with help from Q-Tip. According to Hav and Tip, as well as others who were around, Havoc would spend his time in the Queensbridge projects cooking up beats and would later take them to the studio for Q-Tip to pretty up.\n\n“I was there most of the time when Hav made the beats,\" recalled Twin Gambino (later known as Big Twins), a Mobb Deep affiliate and member of Infamous Mobb, in a 2015 interview. \"Hav lived in 41-15 and I lived in 41-16. He would look out his window and call me and we could talk to each other. Early in the morning he used to hit me up, ‘Yo, let’s get some beers and some weed!’ I used to go and get the beers and weed and go to his crib and he used to push on them [MPC] buttons all day. I heard every beat he made – ‘Survival of the Fittest,’ ‘Shook Ones Pt. II’ – I was right there.”\n\nHe continued, “It was dope but I didn’t know what he was doing really. He would press on the buttons, the beat would come out dope. Later on we would go to the studio, I didn’t really understand it. I was just happy to get off the block for a couple of hours and not hustling or anything.”\n\nHavoc told Complex in 2011 about working with Q-Tip on The Infamous, “A Tribe Called Quest, their music was just crazy crispy and sounded so professional. We was so rugged and gritty with it, we just needed a snare that popped out the beat, and that’s where Q-Tip came in. And it wasn’t even verbal advice, it was like, ‘Just watch what I do as I go into the studio.’ He was like, ‘Check this idea out. What do you think about this?’ Basically, it was more of just a watch and observe and take that and run with it.”\n\nQ-Tip said in the same interview, “I met Mobb Deep when they were doing their first album and we always stayed in contact. I remember I spoke to Havoc a few times and he was like, ‘Come through. Let’s work.’ I came through to the studio when they had the first ‘Shook Ones’ out. I can’t remember exactly though. You know, it was a long time ago.”\n\nHe also added,“I can’t remember which ones but I mixed a few songs on there that I didn’t produce. I don’t know if I was there at mastering, but I remember speaking to Matty and Havoc about the mastering and how they wanted it to sound. The engineers who engineered it, It was just another gig for them and they didn’t really give a s**t. I was just trying to push the sound and make it sound as best as I could with what we were dealt. I remember wanting it to bang. Hav was really the general, I was just a soldier so I was trying to lend a hand.”\n\nQ-Tip concluded with, “It was cool being in a dynamic where somebody else was taking the reins. It’s a totally different sound than the Tribe stuff.”\n\nBefore they were Mobb Deep, Prodigy and Havoc went by the moniker Poetical Prophets. It was a name that was so underwhelming that Diddy suggested they change their name if they were going to sign to the newly created Bad Boy Entertainment. While they eventually changed their name to Mobb Deep, the duo ended up signing with Loud Records, but it wasn't until after much deliberation.\n\n\"What really made us change it was [that] we were going to do a deal with Puffy at the time. He was going to sign us and everything but he said, 'There's only one thing about y'all. Y'all need to change your name.' We ended up not signing at all,\" said Havoc in a 2015 interview with Billboard.\n\nHe continued, \"When we were shopping around our demos and trying to get signed, Puff was one of the people that we went to 'cause we were really tight with Puff back in the day -- Prodigy more so. Prodigy would go out to clubs and stuff like that. Puff used to send us limos and we were kind of cool with him. I guess that was him warming up to us and trying to sign us. He wanted to sign us bad. He would've signed us but one thing he said, I remember, was, 'I like y'all and everything but y'all got to change your name.' He didn't try to come up with a name for us. He left that up to us. So when me and P was chillin' around at Def Jam the light bulb must've struck. We [came up with] Mobb Deep. Puff kind of initiated the name change.\"\n\nWhen hip hop heads think of Mobb Deep, they think of Prodigy as the primary emcee while Havoc was known as the beat-creator. Prior to The Infamous, though, it was the opposite. The Mobb's sophomore album's production was mostly helmed by Havoc and Q-Tip, however, prior to that – most notably on their debut effort Juvenile Hell – Havoc was the lyricist while Prodigy handled most of the beats.\n\nAccording to Loud A&R Schott Free, the roles ended up reversing when it came time to create The Infamous. “When they were younger, they say that Havoc really used to be the catalyst with the topics when it comes to what they would talk about,\" he recalled. \"At times, he would even sketch out and help P out on the writing side and Prodigy was the guy that taught Havoc how to program and chop beats. He was the production dude but since P would get sick so much, Hav had to learn to make his own beats and P couldn’t really do anything except sit around from his sickle cell disease, so he had all that time to think of song concepts. And that’s how everything started to change.”"
