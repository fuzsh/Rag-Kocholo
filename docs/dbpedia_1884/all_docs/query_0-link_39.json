        "text": "Born Christopher Lee Rios on November 10, 1971, in the Bronx, New York, Big Pun emerged as one of the most influential rappers of the late 90s. Born to parents of Puerto Rican descent, he experienced a challenging upbringing, which included dropping out of high school and battling with homelessness. These hardships, however, shaped him into a lyrical genius, and his experiences gave depth and credibility to his music. Big Pun's breakthrough came in 1995 when he met fellow rapper Fat Joe, who was impressed by Pun's freestyling skills. This encounter led to Big Pun's inclusion in Fat Joe's album Jealous One's Envy in 1995, marking his official entry into the rap industry. His debut solo album, Capital Punishment, released in 1998, peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 charts and became the first album by a solo Latino rapper to go Platinum. The album featured the hit single \"Still Not a Player\", which is often celebrated as Big Pun's signature song. Despite his meteoric rise to fame, Big Pun struggled with health issues related to his weight. He weighed around 700 pounds at his heaviest. His health problems eventually culminated in a fatal heart attack on February 7, 2000. Despite his untimely death at the age of 28, Big Pun's influence on the music industry remains significant. His legacy continues to inspire countless artists, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest lyricists in hip-hop history.\n\nDarnell Carlton (born August 20, 1977), better known by his stage name Crunchy Black, is an American rapper and Hype man. He was a longtime member of the Oscar-winning rap group Three 6 Mafia from the group’s founding until 2006. At the 78th Academy Awards in 2006, Three 6 Mafia and Frayser Boy won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for It's Hard out Here for a Pimp. Crunchy left Three 6 Mafia over monetary disputes involving his desire to forward his solo career. Black’s debut solo album entitled On My Own was released on September 19, 2006. Crunchy has said this album was released by DJ Paul and Juicy J without his permission. Crunchy’s second solo album, From Me To You is also said to have been put out without his permission by DJ Paul and Juicy J. From Me To You reached 12 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, 32 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and 10 on the Billboard Top Rap albums chart. \"On My Own\" reached 3 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, 163 on the Billboard 200, 15 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart, 28 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and 13 on the Billboard Top Rap Albums chart.In 2013, Crunchy Black joined Da Mafia 6ix, a reincarnation of Three 6 Mafia with DJ Paul, Koopsta Knicca and Gangsta Boo. He has a daughter named Ladee Pooh Carlton. Crunchy contributed heavily to Platinum albums When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1, and Most Known Unknown, as well as Gold albums Da Unbreakables, and Chapter 2: World Domination with Three 6 Mafia. Crunchy is known for g-walking, which he says he started doing in Memphis Clubs but admits he is not the originator.He was shot in the face and the leg in Las Vegas on July 1, 2012 and recovered very quickly from the injuries and was released from the hospital just days after the shooting."
