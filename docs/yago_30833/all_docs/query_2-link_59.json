Where else does one go to experience unbridled love and enthusiasm for what you do for a living? It’s obvious that the actors really appreciate the fans — after all, they readily give up a sunny Saturday afternoon.\n\n....\n\nThere were a few actors whose presence was sorely missed — Paul Satterfield (Spencer) and Michael Easton (John). In fact, it was at last year’s luncheon (my first) that I finally understood the appeal of Easton. His swagger as he entered the room and the screams from the crowd were mesmerizing. I was a fan after that. The fans have a passion for bad-boy characters that is shown in their near-hysterical response to Trevor St. John (Todd). I also enjoy the response when an actor shows up late. It’s a little thrill the fans love, and I frankly got a kick out of Forbes March’s arrival. He ran in like a bullet to the screaming joy of the fans.\n\n© Soap Opera Digest\n\nExcerpt from Column of Live 8/26/06: Forbes March\n\nIlene Kristen and Forbes March\n\nSaturday, August 26, 2006\n\nOK one more post today about Daytime Drama, but this time to sing the praises of two top notch multi-talented actors from One Life to Live.\n\n....\n\nIn spite of the high negative quotient involved here, both Ms. Kristen and Mr. March were the last actors to leave One Life to Live's fan club event reamaining until the last fan got the desired autograph. Kudos to these good people who appreciate their fans.\n\n© Column of Life\n\nSoap Opera Digest 7/07: Forbes March\n\nONE LIFE TO LIVE\n\nWho: Trevor St. John (Todd), Forbes March (Nash) and the ladies of Llanview.\n\nWhat: OLTL Fan Club Weekend. Including the Fourth Annual Girls Night Out with the Ladies of Llanview.\n\nWhen: August 3, 2007.\n\nWhere: New York Marriott East Side, 525 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY.\n\nHow: Tix are $65 for the Trevor St. John and Forbes March events. Tix are $75 for the Ladies of Llanview of event. There is a $5 discount per ticket if you purchase tickets to all three events.\n\n© Soap Opera Digest\n\nExcerpt from Forbes March Fanclub 8/07: Forbes March\n\nTea with Forbes\n\nWhen: August 15th\n\nWhere: @ Alice's Tea Cup on 156 East 64th Street\n\nTime: 5-8 p.m.\n\nPrice: $60 per person\n\nWant to join the fun? There is more information on z15.invisionfree.com/ForbesMarch\n\nFor more information: email Georgette at forbesmarchfc@aol.com\n\n© Forbes March Fanclub\n\nSoaptown USA 8/07: Forbes March\n\nForbes March\n\nAn intimate group of about 50 fans turned out for Forbes' event. The handsome actor came bounding into the room looking gorgeous as ever and thanked everyone for braving the heat to come to see him. The question and answer session started with a fan asking Forbes, in Italian, how his son is doing. He answered in Italian and then translated, that his son is doing very well, starting walking and is into everything. He spoke very affectionately about both of his children and how different they are. His son likes to break things and his daughter likes to paint. He is a true family man and would love to have a large family. He said his vision of the future is to be retired and sit at the head of a long dinner table filled with family and plan Christmas all year long!\n\nForbes talked about his character and how happy he is that the triangle is over. It had run its course and it was definitely time to move on. The talented actor talked about how soaps are storytelling and it doesn't matter about the lighting or sets, what maters is the story and if you tell a good story, the audience will come along for the ride. He spoke about a new character coming on the show named Jared. He will cause some problems with Nash and Jess. Nash and Jared have what he called \"Mental jousting.\" He also mentioned how he liked when Nash first came on the show and he was a \"bad boy.\" He would like to see the writers bring a little of that bad boy back into the character.\n\nForbes then went from table to table thrilling everyone with his personality and humor and warm smile. He spent a lot of time at each table and never rushed anyone. He has sucha cute and charming personality and is very down to earth. Lots of hearts were fluttering at this event! Unassuming, humble and genuine, Forbes March is the real deal. Every person left the event feeling special for the time Forbes spent with them. Thank you Debbie O'Connor for another great event.\n\n© Soaptown USA\n\nExcerpt from Soap Central 8/6/07: Forbes March, Bree Williamson\n\nONLY IN LLANVIEW: OLTL Fan Club Weekend\n\nEvery August fans come from all over the country to convene in New York City where the annual One Life to Live Fan Club festivities are held. Regardless of who your favorite actors might be, there is always SOME event that can interest even the pickiest of fans, and of course the pinnacle event of the weekend is the Saturday afternoon luncheon, held at the Marriott Marquis Hotel. This past weekend, Denise, Dawn, and I gathered to enjoy some of the events involving the actors, and we were pleased to see the turnout and the support for the show (and new head writer Ron Carlivati). If you’ve never attended the OLTL weekend before, you really must. There are so many events from which to choose, and the weekend usually begins with the Friday night Girls’ Night Out. With a small, intimate group, fans are treated to some big laughs and intimate one-on-one time with actresses like Melissa Archer, Bree Williamson, Christina Chambers, Beth Ann Bonner, Robin Strasser, and Ilene Kristen, to name a few. Forbes March had his own event this year, and typically Trevor St. John also has something for his fans.\n\n© Soap Central\n\nExcerpt from Soap Opera Digest 8/17/07: Forbes March, Michael Easton\n\nYour VIP Pass To OLTL's 2007 Fan Club Luncheon\n\nBy • Posted: Aug 16, 2007\n\nDespite it being one of the hottest days of the year, OLTLers were full of energy at the 2007 Fan Club Luncheon, held at New York’s Marriott Marquis on August 4.\n\n....\n\nNotable absentees included Trevor St. John (Todd) and Forbes March (Nash), who hosted their own events the night before, and Michael Easton (John), whose \"unofficial\" fan club was busy selling calendars at the luncheon to benefit the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance.\n\n© Soap Opera Digest"
