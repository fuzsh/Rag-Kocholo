        "text": "sjams said:\n\nI think the writers are wanting us to think that Rex is Paige and Spencer's boy, but I have a feeling that there is going to be some twist here! I was hoping that Hugh and Kelly would pass Duke's baby off as theirs. I love Hugh. He is a hunk! Anyway how STUPID is Adrianna? That guy is Nash's deadbeat friend how helped kidnap Tessica and Brennan? And BREE for the baby's nickname? Quinkidinck or what??? Don't think so! And the baby's name is Brennan Brennan? How dumb is that Richard Richards!\n\nSpencer is on my \"hate\" list. I have never liked him. He is way too shady for me. Blair and Todd is fine with me. I am tired of them arguing all the time. Maybe they could recast Jack..what a dud! I love Chris and Vangie...They make a striking couple. Nat and John...snore!! Ever notice how their intimate scene's are so forced and desperate? Whatever!\n\nI love David and Dorian, but I like this new side of Dorian with Clint. I know it won't last she can never be nice for very long. AND her being the stalker or behind the stalking? What's her motive for that, to test Rex's love for Adriana? I hope Adriana ends up preggers with Rex's baby. That would just eat Dorian to the core!\n\nTommy has to be Todd and Margaret's. Who elses could it be?\n\nDorian is not the stalker , but she did hire him and that's pretty low even for Dorian. So what kind of recourse can we expect Adriana life really in danger and not to mention Clint breaking Dorian heart which would be good for her, I quess the next few weeks will tell. Gotta love them soaps!!!!!\n\nI totally missed that Tommy might be Todd Jr! I guess that's a sign of how little attention I'm paying to the show lately. And I wish they'd stop making Marcie so dumb! I've always liked her character, but lately with this whole foster baby thing....\n\nWhile Dorian has always driven me nuts (though I love her with David), she's just a character I love to hate. However, Spencer is pure evil - get him off the show! I'm so sick of his smug, self-righteous self!\n\nBut the one I'd most like to see killed off or re-cast is Antonio! OMG! He's soooo irritating! He's such a twit!!! (like refusing to call Brennan by her name & telling Nash he can't see her - who died & made him Daddy?? and why doesn't Jessica open her mouth??) But he always is angry & hyperventilating!! OMG!! Someone should teach him how to act...or at least breathe!\n\npiratesmate said:\n\nI totally missed that Tommy might be Todd Jr!

But he always is angry & hyperventilating!! OMG!! Someone should teach him how to act...or at least breathe!\n\nHey piratesmate, I have to admit you are so right on the money about Antonio he is very annoying and I must say that Jess / Tess and Nash has some very stong chemistry I like to see them back together!\n\nHi All, I was out of town this whole week, so missed OLTL.\n\nFrom what I have seen, the candidates for Paige's son are: Rex, Hugh, and Nash. They have let off hints that it could be Rex. If Rex is Paige's son, Rex would be a Buchanin because Spencie is a Buchanin. That would make Rex Bo's nephew (possible future step-son) and Rex and Bo's bond would be complete. But if Paige's son was Hugh, I think the writers think it might be interesting for Hugh to find out Spencie was his daddy right before he throws the book at him. Hugh-baby might get Spencie off the hook (like hiding evidence) if he finds out Spencie is his daddy. Then we may be stuck with Spencie indefinately. Now if Paige's son is Nash... check this out... that would make Nash a Buchanin since Asa is Spencie's daddy. Ok, so if Tessica Buchanin and Nash Buchanin had a child together.. yikes! BUT, even though Tessica and NAGalie are twins and that would typically make Nash and Tessica both Buchanins, we already know that Tessica is not biologically a Buchanin even though NAGalie is. Whew! I'm confusing myself! Sometimes I don't think the writers know who Paige's son is. They might be waiting to see who we would accept as a \"forever\" character.\n\nI do believe Spencie shot Tom McBain, but what I had said before was that it may have been Roxie's presently dead drunken doctor husband that botched the surgery Paige was blamed for. Remember, a long time ago, Roxie stated that her husband was able to get babies from the hospital... or something to that effect.\n\nJohn really deserves better than NAGalie.\n\nAnd yes, Marcie is really getting on my nerves. She behaved so irrationally when she didn't want to give \"Toddy\" back. Did she look like someone who would make a stable parent? I don't think so. I guess it has always bothered me when adult soap stars argue loudly in front of soap babies. If anyone is headed for the analyst's couch later in life, it's that little A on AMC. That poor baby has been traumatized by JR and Babe's constant fighting. Now Toddy will have to deal with looney Marcie's outbursts.\n\nBlair and Todd.... ugh! I agree... Blair has not suffered enough.\n\nI don't exactly like Vangie with Cristian. I really liked her with that \"too hot\" psychiatrist dude. Please, let's see more of him!\n\nMaybe NAGalie and Antonio can ride off into the sunset together.\n\nTT\n\nOk, it looks as though I missed something. I didn't know Spencer was a Buchanan ? I know he was creeping around after Asa, but can't remember what happened after that. As for Antonio, it is time for him to go. I used to really like him, but now ugh! Maybe after he goes back to the police force things will get better with him, because that is when I actually liked him.\n\nI hope Hugh ends up being Paige's son, I really like the character. I also like the idea of him being with Kelly. As for Jessica, she needs to dump Antonio and get with Nash. Maybe the integrated Jessica will realize he is the one for her and Brennan.\n\nPrincess89 said:\n\nOk, it looks as though I missed something. I didn't know Spencer was a Buchanan ?\n\nThey never came out and said it. Spencer implied that Asa was his (and possibly David's) father when he (Spencer) was carrying around a black and white photo of his mom. Now can you just picture David finding out he is a Buchanan? He would be hysterical as he moves into the mansion. Too bad Asa is not doing good in real life. I think David would really give him a run for the money and they could be quite funny together.\n\nPrincess89 said:\n\nAs for Antonio, it is time for him to go. I used to really like him, but now ugh! Maybe after he goes back to the police force things will get better with him, because that is when I actually liked him.\n\nHehe.. I think you hit the nail on the head. Antonio has too much time on his hands and needs to get back on the force. I actually liked him too back then. And geeeeee whizzzzzzzzzzz.... what's it going to take to get Antonio out of that idiotic apartment with the spray painted fridge??!!! Ugh! You're a millionaire! Get the heck out of that dump with those two little girls!\n\nI see hope for Kelly and Hugh. Kevin is just a pain to watch any more.\n\nTT\n\nPrincess89 said:\n\nOk, it looks as though I missed something. I didn't know Spencer was a Buchanan ?

Maybe the integrated Jessica will realize he is the one for her and Brennan.\n\nHaven't read much of this thread but jumping in here as I remember reading up on this in a Soap magazine. Apparently they were going the route of Spencer coming to Llanview to get \"revenge\" on the Buchanans because Asa was his father. With Phil Carey's illness they sort of dropped the ball on that storyline (although it was mentioned at some point, but I missed that show as well) to pursue Spencer as having been a part of the death of John's father. Seems like they just didn't follow up on the whole reason Spencer came to Llanview to begin with. I really wish they had have continued that storyline in some fashion instead of just dropping it like a hot potato.\n\nI wish Phil Carey all the best and it will be a great loss if he is not able to come back to be Asa again. He WAS and is Asa Buchanan. I truly miss seeing him interact with the cast. (my prayers are with him and his family.)\n\nI do like Kelly and Hugh together as well. I know they are trying to go that route, but I do hope they pursue it. Hugh is very under utilized and I would like to see more of him on the show.\n\nSue Ellen (longtime viewer of One Life to Live--16 plus years.)\n\nSueEllen said:\n\nHaven't read much of this thread but jumping in here as I remember reading up on this in a Soap magazine.

Is is just his age or does he have an illness? I was completely unaware that he was ill?"
