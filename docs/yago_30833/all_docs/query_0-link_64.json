We at the New Jersey Firewood Company are proud to provide Firewood from locally felled trees from managed forests. We do not sell \"seasoned\", \"winter blend\" or any other firewood that isn't 100% kiln-dried, clean, mold and insect free firewood ready to burn the moment we deliver to your residence or restaurant. Our wood is Heat Treated and Kiln Dried in accordance with and beyond all USDA and DEC guidelines using the most efficient and environmentally friendly wood fired kiln currently available. We provide an environmentally conscious product which will not only prevent the spread of invasive insects but, with the removal of almost all moisture, will burn longer and stronger than other firewood. We hope that our product, along with good friends, good food, and good conversation, will become the catalyst for picture perfect moments and happy memories.\n\nForbes March.\n\n© New Jersey Firewood\n\nMaplewood Online 12/27/13: Forbes March\n\nI just wanted to give a shout-out for a company that we just used. He is not the cheapest supplier by any means but his product is simply beautiful and his customer service has been phenomenal. Because of the size of our fireplace and andirons we need firewood that is longer than usual. I contacted Forbes March (great name huh?) at The NJ Firewood Company http://www.newjersey-firewood.com/ and he delivered the most amazing product! (It is nothing like the irregular short logs we had delivered by a different company a few years ago.) He cut it to the custom length we needed, he provided us with a hefty \"chunky\" cut, he kiln dried it, delivered it and stacked it on my property. I purchased a 4' x 8' rack of these 22\" long beautiful, straight, hardwood logs delivered and stacked for $375. He even delivered extra because he ran late as he needed some extra kiln time for the chunky wood. The logs burn beautifully but the stuff is so lovely that I am hesitant to use it!\n\n© Maplewood Online\n\nExcerpt from Soaps.com 6/15: Forbes March\n\nSoap Opera Actors: Where Are They Now?\n\nWednesday, June 3rd, 2015\n\nForbes March: Soap star turned entrepreneur.\n\nWho could forget \"One Life to Live\" actor Forbes March in his emotional role as Nash Brennan (2005 to 2008), his love affair with Jessica Buchanan (Bree Williamson) and their deathbed goodbye after he fell through a skylight at the Palace Hotel. Though March reappeared in daytime as Mason Jarvis on \"As the World Turns\" in 2009 and played George in \"Degrassi Takes Manhattan\" in 2010, he hasn't been seen since. And now we know why… In an interview with DV8 March revealed how he moved to Jeffersonville, New York with his wife and two kids and got into the firewood business, which consists of splitting, kiln-drying and packaging hardwood for customers. The former daytime actor also has dabbled in growing tomatoes, raising organic chickens and would like to try his hand at raising organic shrimp. Prior to his \"One Life\" role, March played Scott Chandler on \"All My Children\" from 1999 to 2000.\n\n© Soaps.com\n\nNew Yorker 1/18/16: Forbes March\n\nFire Starter\n\nBy Eric Lach January 18, 2016\n\nForbes March wasn’t always in the firewood business. He spent three seasons on the ABC soap opera “One Life to Live,” playing the doomed winery owner Nash Brennan, who falls to his death through a skylight window. Soon after, in 2009, March quit acting, moved to Jeffersonville, New York, and established the New York Firewood Company. The firm now supplies kiln-dried, plastic-wrapped bundles of logs to seventy-five restaurants and hundreds of private residences in and around New York City. “I’ve fallen into everything,” March said on a recent Saturday morning, as he navigated his forty-foot delivery truck through Manhattan traffic. March and a helper, a burly man with tattooed shoulders named Ronald Stickle, had set out from Jeffersonville at 4:30 a.m. They had fourteen stops to make: a house in Westchester County, seven restaurants in Manhattan, one in Williamsburg, one on Staten Island, and four houses in New Jersey. “We got college kids, we got professors, we have old families on the Upper East Side—I’ve delivered firewood to the Roosevelts—we have Irish pub owners,” March said.\n\nAt Bella Blu, a restaurant on Lexington Avenue that serves wood-fired pizza, Stickle wheeled twenty-five bundles into the kitchen on a dolly while March sized up a honey locust outside. “In another forty years, that would be a gorgeous tree,” he said. “You got a nice long straight section with no branches.” March, who is forty-two, and from Nova Scotia, still appears more or less camera-ready, though his dirty-blond hair and pale-blue eyes have begun to compete with some crow’s-feet. Back in the truck, he explained how, after nearly two decades of acting and modelling, he decided to go into business. He first considered opening a winery, to trade on his old character’s name. “I had a huge following,” he said, as he double-parked around the corner from La Tarte Flambée, on East Thirty-third. “I could have sold wine up the ying yang.” But firewood was closer to his Canadian heart. On his right forearm, there is a long dark scar he got when he was eight, while cutting wood with a bow saw.\n\nThe delivery truck held more than five hundred bundles, mostly fine-split ash, but also large-split “regular” mix, plus hickory, cherry, and apple. “They have different smells,” March said. “Some people get into it like wine.” Hickory will make a house smell like a ski lodge. Cherry is prized for the way it crackles and pops in a fireplace.\n\nMarch estimates that his company cuts, splits, dries, packages, and ships about three thousand “Manhattan cords” (some forty cubic feet of wood, or fifty bundles) a year. Prices range from two hundred and fifty to four hundred and twenty-five dollars per Manhattan cord, depending on the species. Then there are special orders. “There’s an axe community in Brooklyn,” March said. “They always want us to bring them logs, to practice their axe-swinging prowess.”\n\nSeveral of the day’s deliveries were to wood-fired pizza restaurants, which have been crucial customers ever since March got the stamp of approval from Roberto Caporuscio, the owner of Don Antonio and Kesté, in 2012. Outside Eataly, off Madison Square Park, March and Stickle watched as a man driving a forklift carted off an entire pallet of their fine split. Pizza chefs are finicky. March once had a client who burned only white birch for his pizza. Another guy was partial to the red cores of beech trees. “If you change their wood, you change the way their oven behaves, and they can’t cook in it,” March said. On Houston Street, Stickle hopped out to make a delivery, while March stayed in the truck, which was parked illegally. He watched several police cars drive by. “If I get one more moving violation, I lose my license,” he said. “Then I’ll have to move back to the city.”\n\nLast year, as part of an effort to protect the city’s air quality, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a law prohibiting the installation of any new wood-burning fireplaces, and mandating that wood burned in a preëxisting fireplace have a moisture content of twenty per cent or less, by weight. (Drier wood burns cleaner.) These changes don’t much bother March, who has all the clients he needs. Plus, he already brings the moisture content of his logs down to eight per cent, drying them in a giant kiln that’s long enough for their ends to carbonize. “That’s very dry,” March said. “It’s ready to burn.” ♦\n\n© New Yorker"
