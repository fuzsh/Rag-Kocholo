McDonald’s) made famous by Seinfeld, McDonald’s lawsuits are far more likely to involve workers’ compensation or workers’ safety than coffee. If you include both corporate-owned restaurants and McDonald’s franchises, there are nearly two million McDonald’s employees in the world. With so many workers, and relatively little corporate oversight, injuries are bound to happen.\n\nThat said, McDonald’s guests also suffer injuries, such as slip-and-falls, burns (e.g., the coffee case), and even beatings. Guest injuries can occur as a result of equipment failure, inattentive staff, and/or lax safety measures, among other causes.\n\nWhether you’re a McDonald’s employee or a guest, if you were injured at McDonald’s, you may be able to recover significant financial compensation by filing a personal injury lawsuit.

(In November, 2019, the company paid $26 million to settle a wage theft lawsuit brought by tens of thousands of employees.) These cases can arise for a variety of reasons:\n\nHazardous conditions that lead to (or exacerbate) burns and other injuries\n\nLack of protection for employees, leading to harassment and physical attacks\n\nFailure to pay employees for overtime or other money they are owed\n\nSystemic sexual harassment\n\nGuests, like employees, are susceptible to slip-and-falls, burns, and even attacks. These injuries may occur because of one (or more) of the following:\n\nStaff inattention and/or lack of training\n\nFaulty or poorly maintained equipment\n\nInadequate number of staff\n\nLack of first aid kits or other legally required materials\n\nFailure to warn (e.g., no “Wet Floor” signs, no “Caution: Hot” label on coffee)\n\nMcDonald’s Injuries\n\nBelieve it or not, serious injuries can occur at McDonald’s, for both employees and guests. These are some of the most common injuries that occur in these cases:\n\nBurns\n\nSprains\n\nBursitis (joint inflammation)\n\nBroken bones\n\nNeck and back injuries\n\nConcussions\n\nProving Negligence\n\nIf you were injured, denied pay, or sexually harassed at McDonald’s, you might be wondering how to go about proving it. “Negligence” is the legal term for liability or responsibility in an incident. Proving liability generally involves satisfying the following criteria:\n\nMcDonald’s owed you a duty of care. The company was responsible for operating its restaurant in a safe manner, and they failed to do so.\n\nThey breached their duty. McDonald’s breached their legal obligation to avoid harming you.\n\nTheir breach caused the accident. McDonald’s actions were responsible for the accident, making them legally liable.\n\nThere were losses suffered as a result. McDonald’s actions caused you injury (physical or emotional) and/or property damage.\n\nPotential Damages\n\nIf you were injured at McDonald’s, you may be able to file a lawsuit against the fast food chain seeking compensation for one or more of the following:\n\nUnpaid wages (for McDonald’s employees)\n\nLost wages and/or diminished earning capacity\n\nPast, current, and future medical bills\n\nPain and suffering\n\nPhysical therapy\n\nLoss of life’s enjoyment\n\nSpeak to a McDonald’s Injury Lawyer\n\nIf you were injured at McDonald’s, contact the personal injury lawyers at Morgan & Morgan. Our highly skilled attorneys can review the facts of your case to determine liability for your injury and help you collect financial compensation during this difficult time. We work on a contingency fee basis, so there’s no cost to get started, and we get paid only if you win. To learn more, schedule a free case evaluation now.\n\nScroll down for more Load More"
