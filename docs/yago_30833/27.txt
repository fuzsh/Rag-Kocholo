Born in 2006, Bree came into this world as Brennan Buchanan. Her mom Jessica decided to give her the Buchanan last name and Nash's as her first. It wasn't until later when Jessica shorten her name to Bree as a way to try to separate Jessica's alter ego, 'Tess,' from the baby, seeing as it was Tess who had been in control of Jessica's mind and body when Bree was conceived. As sweet as can be, this little bundle of joy has become the apple of many eyes, especially her daddy Nash's who has been left to live without Tess and face the truth that Jessica is married to Antonio.

However, after Jess and Antonio's marriage ended, Bree was lucky enough to have her mom and dad reunite and is even going to be a big sister herself! Just when things where coming together for her family, little Bree lost her father after an accidental fall.

Bree would face more heartache when it was revealed that Chloe, her baby sister, was really Starr's child, Hope. Though Jessica managed to be there for Bree, as well as Brody Lovett, who loved her as if she were her own, Bree has no idea that her mom doesn't remember her - after Mitch Laurence erased Jessica's memory in February 2010.

Jessica regained her memory, became engaged to Brody and gave birth to Bree's little brother, who Bree suggested they name 'grandpa' because he looked like a little old man!

Bree lost her mother again after Tess returned when she found out Natalie and Brody slept together. It wasn't until weeks later when Jessica returned and promised Bree she'd never leave her again.
