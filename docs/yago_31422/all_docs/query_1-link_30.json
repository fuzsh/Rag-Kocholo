        "text": "With the signing in Paris on June 23, 1661, of the contract of marriage of Charles II. and Catherine of Braganza a new chapter may be said to have 'opened in the history of the Catholic Church in England. A general revulsion from the grim repression of the Puritan regime no doubt created an atmosphere of tolerance or indifferentism, at any rate among the more reliable middle classes, in which the sympathetic leanings of the King towards Catholicism found a freer opportunity for their display, though ever with a keen sense of the temper of the Parliament."
