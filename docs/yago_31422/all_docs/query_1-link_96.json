        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe line of succession to the British Throne is a partial list of the people in line to succeed to the throne of the United Kingdom. The succession is regulated by the Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and common law.[1]. As some of the descendants of the Earl of Harewood (No 40 on this list) have married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act (as have the majority of persons from whom those subsequently listed stem) their status in English law as regards succession to the throne is unknown and the list from No 45 onwards must be regarded as entirely hypothetical.\n\nThe line of succession is restricted to the heirs of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, as determined by male-preference primogeniture, religion, and legitimate birth:\n\nA person is always immediately followed in the succession by his or her own legitimate descendants (his or her \"line\") except for any legitimate descendants who already appear higher in the line of succession. Birth order and gender matter: older sons (and their lines) come before younger sons (and theirs); a person's sons (and their lines), irrespective of age, all come before his or her daughters (and their lines).[2]\n\nThe monarch must be a Protestant at the time of accession, and enter into communion with the Church of England after accession.[2]\n\nAnyone who is Roman Catholic, becomes Roman Catholic, or marries a Roman Catholic is permanently excluded from the succession.[2]\n\nA person born to parents who are not married to each other at the time of birth (a bastard) is not included in the line of succession. The subsequent marriage of the parents does not alter this.[3] Under British law, a child born to a married woman is assumed to be the child of her husband.\n\nApart from identifying the next monarch, the line of succession is also used to select the Counsellors of State (and a regent if the need arises) under the provisions of the Regency Act 1937.[4]\n\nThe first seven positions in the line of succession have remained unchanged since the birth of Princess Eugenie in March 1990.\n\nFor past versions of the line, see History of the British line of succession.\n\nFormat of the list\n\nThis list is sectioned roughly every other generation with some exceptions. Boldfaced explanations show how the people in the following block descend from the Electress Sophia of Hanover.\n\nIndividuals who are descended from the Electress Sophia, but are excluded from the line of succession for various reasons are marked as skipped.\n\nSuperscript letters are placed after a name to indicate the source of the name or the reason for exclusion from the line of succession.\n\nNames with superscript letter B are listed at The Official Web Site of the British Monarchy, \"Succession\".\n\nNames with superscript letter R are listed by William Addams Reitwiesner, \"Persons Eligible to Succeed to the British Throne as of 1 Jan 2001\".\n\nNames with superscript letter W are listed by Dan Willis, The Descendants of King George I of Great Britain (Baltimore: Clearfield, 2002) or in its online updates.\n\nNames with superscript letters XMP are excluded on account of marriage to a Roman Catholic (\"papist\").[5]\n\nNames with superscript letters XP are excluded on account of being a Roman Catholic (\"papist\").[5]\n\nNames with superscript letters XI are excluded in accordance with the general interpretation of English Common Law by which illegitimate children have no rights of succession to the British Crown. Illegitimate children whose parents later marry do not thereby gain any succession rights to the British Crown.[3]\n\nLine of succession\n\nDescendants of King Edward VII (1841â1910)\n\nCurrent monarch: HM Queen Elizabeth II (born 1926)\n\nSophia of Hanover â George I â George II â Frederick, Prince of Wales â George III â Prince Edward â Victoria â Edward VII â George V â George VI â Elizabeth II\n\nHRH The Prince of Wales B (The Prince Charles; b. 1948), son of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nHRH Prince William of Wales B (b. 1982), son of The Prince of Wales\n\nHRH Prince Henry of Wales B (b. 1984), son of The Prince of Wales\n\nHRH The Duke of York B (The Prince Andrew; b. 1960), son of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nHRH Princess Beatrice of York B (b. 1988), daughter of The Duke of York\n\nHRH Princess Eugenie of York B (b. 1990), daughter of The Duke of York\n\nHRH The Earl of Wessex B (The Prince Edward; b. 1964), son of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nJames, Viscount Severn B (b. 2007), son of The Earl of Wessex\n\nLady Louise Windsor B (b. 2003), daughter of The Earl of Wessex\n\nHRH The Princess Royal B (The Princess Anne; b. 1950), daughter of Queen Elizabeth II\n\nPeter Phillips B (b. 1977), son of The Princess Royal\n\nZara Phillips B (b. 1981), daughter of The Princess Royal\n\nVictoria â Edward VII â George V â George VI â Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon\n\nDavid Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley B (b. 1961), son of Princess Margaret\n\nThe Hon.
