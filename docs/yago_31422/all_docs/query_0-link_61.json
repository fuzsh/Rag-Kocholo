(I'm not sure why you mention Princes William and Harry at all, since at the time of your post neither one was married, and Prince William has since married a commoner):\n\n- Lady Diana Spencer was not a royal highness before (or after) her marriage to Prince Charles.\n\n- Prince Albert (who later reigned as George VI) was born a prince of a royal house but married someone who was not of royal birth but rather the daughter of a Scottish Earl. In fact, the Queen Mother (as she was later known) had many had many commoners in her lineage.\n\n- The current Queen of Sweden was born Silvia Sommerlath and most definitely a commoner.\n\nMarie-Christine von H-L and almost Count Rodolphe de Limburg-Stirum\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"almost Count,\" but in any event Count Rodolphe de Limburg-Stirum is not a member of a royal house and does not bear the title of royal (or any other) highness. So theirs is not a marriage between two royal houses either."
