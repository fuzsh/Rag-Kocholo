        "text": "Sender: Laing, Surgeon Lieutenant Colonel James Anderson (1845 - 1930)\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n01/08/1894\n\nApproximate date given. Partial letter from Surgeon Lieutenant Colonel James Anderson Laing to de László in which he thanks the artist for the photograph of \"yourself... with the Minister and his Secretary\"; he writes of a trip down the Danube and of his impressions of Vienna; he has heard that de László is going to Sofia to paint royalty there [3937] [3715]; he finishes the letter by praising the artist's industriousness in studying English. He probably met the artist through the Valentin family, with whom he lived while studying in Munich, and who are mentioned in letter\n\nSender: Singer, Hans Wolfgang (1867-1957)\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n26/07/1895\n\nLetter from the German art historian, Hans Wolfgang Singer, to de László regarding various travel plans and his own work. He mentions that he looked up Lucy, but she was not home. He adds that she lived on a \"not very elegant street\"\n\nSender: Berényi, Gyula\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n07/04/1896\n\nProfusely thanks de László for his generous Easter gift. De László can always count on him – if he does not want him as a model, he is ready to sit for de László’s colleagues on his recommendation\n\nSender: G. Heuer & Kirmse\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n13/07/1896\n\nLetter from G. Heuer & Kirmse, a Berlin-based firm of printmakers, to de László letting the artist know that they have not found any German magazine that wants to publish his paintings of invalids, and they have not yet finished the xylographic version of 'Evening Prayer' [10669]. They ask de László to send the historical painting he promised, which they say is of much more interest than genre paintings\n\nSender: Singer, Hans Wolfgang (1867-1957)\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n30/12/1896\n\nLetter from the German art historian, Hans Wolfgang Singer, to de László in which he writes of his recent engagement, he congratulates the artist on his commission to paint Emperor Franz Joseph's portrait, and he mentions that he got to know the artists Walter Crane and Edward Burne-Jones whilst in England. He asks de László whether he received the first two volumes of his \"Allgemeines Künstler-Lexikon\"\n\nSender: Singer, Hans Wolfgang (1867-1957)\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n10/02/1896\n\nLetter from the German art historian, Hans Wolfgang Singer, to de László regarding the artist's imminent trip to Dresden. Singer asks de László to dinner and adds that he could arrange for one of the artist's girlfriends, presently in Dresden, to come too\n\nSender: Singer, Hans Wolfgang (1867-1957)\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n18/08/1896\n\nLetter from the German art historian, Hans Wolfgang Singer, to de László thanking the artist for sending photographs and an exhibition catalogue. Were it not in Hungarian, Singer observes that the catalogue would be useful for his own publication, the Allgemeines Künstler-Lexikon. He notes that de László has exhibited \"a very large number of works\" (Singer is possibly referring to the Millennium Exhibition held at the Műcsarnok, Budapest in 1896)\n\nSender: Indecipherable\n\nRecipient: László, Philip Alexius de (1869 - 1937)\n\n14/10/1896\n\nLetter from the Mayor of Zombor asking de László if he will accept a commission to paint life-size portraits of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth of Austria to be hung in the ceremonial hall of the city"
