Bequest Albert Adsit Olemonfl Aug. 24, 1938 (Not available for exchange) ^^ 1 INTRODUCTION. THIS is not a biography, but an introduction. It must be sufficient, therefore, to say that the Marquise de Fonte- noy is the daughter of an ancient and lordly house, and the bearer of a name that is everywhere in caste-charmed Europe an \" Open, Sesame !\" to the most aristocratic coterie and to the courts of royalty. She is, too, the wife of a man of worthy lineage and of social, literary, and diplomatic distinction ; so that both by inheritance and by alliance she possesses the full spirit of the brilliant regime of which she writes. Her social and official career, moreover, has been such as to bring her into and make her a part of the court life of many European capitals, both in its brilliant public manifestations and in its less conventional domestic phases. With unusual opportuni- ties for observation she has joined an admirable ability to see, to remember, and to reproduce in fitting and expressive lan- guage. Beside the privilege of reading in manuscript the pages which follow this, the writer has for many years enjoyed the personal acquaintance of the Marquise de Fontenoy and her kinsfolk, and heard from her own lips many of the most interesting incidents and descriptions that adorn this book long before the book was written or even planned. And, listening thus, and knowing well with what assured authority she spoke, he more than once ventured to suggest that what was so pleasant for a few to hear would be equally pleasant for many to read. This belief was strengthened by perusal of the manuscript, and will doubtless be amply confirmed by the reception the public will give to the completed volume. INTRODUCTION. As to the book, its title but imperfectly denotes its actual character. It is really the transformation of court life into current speech. It is a presentation of royalty in all its phases of splendor or of meanness ; a history of statesmanship and a chronicle of anecdotes, a gallery of portraits and a show-case of jewels. It opens the doors of the audience-chamber and of the boudoir. It places before the reader the occupants and close neighbors of the thrones of Europe ; their intel- lects, their characters, their speech, their faces and forms, their passions and manners, their very garb and equipage; and all by virtue of the author's unchallenged ability to say, \"These things I myself have seen ; these things I myself have heard. These things I know.\" It is, then, a book on a most popular theme, written by a person of extraordinary fitness for the task. For such a work there can be needed no apology, nor felt a fear for its favorable reception. If one approaches it with even the least exalted motive — mere curi- osity— he will be more than satisfied ; nor will he be less who, in an austere spirit, seeks in it historic facts or encyclo- psedic information. Between the two there will be a multitude of readers of varying tastes and motives, all gaining here unfailingly the object of their quest — an instructive, enter- taining, and amusing living panorama of royal and imperial life, showing equally the jewel in the crown and the blot on the escutcheon. Unnumbered readers will thus find in the perusal of this work great pleasure, but not greater than the present writer finds in uttering these few and inadequate words of introduction. W.

VERY characteristic is the manner in which Queen Vic- toria received the news of her succession to the throne, on the night of the 19th to the 20th of June, 1837. The young Princess had just celebrated her i8th birthday and was then a blooming girl full of life and spirit who, if not regularly pretty, yet possessed a charm of her own quite undeniable in its winninof o-race and sweetness. A little after three o'clock in the morning the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chamberlain, and Sir Henry Hal- ford (the Royal physician) , who at twenty minutes after two o'clock had seen King William die, went off from Windsor to the palace at Kensington to hail the Princess Victoria as Queen. When they reached the Palace all its inmates were wrapped in profound slumber, and it was only with the greatest diffi- culty that they could obtain admission. After some delay the young Princess came to them, wrapped in a loose white dressinor o-own with her magnificent hair fallinor over her shoulders and with her eyes full of tears. She entered the room with her mother by her side. Neither were unpre- pared for the news, but the Princess was nevertheless greatly aftected, and it went forth to the world as an omen of the happiest augury that the young girl had \"wept to learn she was Queen.\" 2 17 l8 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. As she entered the room the Archbishop and his two com- panions dropped on one knee before her and kissing her hand hailed her as Queen. Then, by the special request of the new sovereign, they all knelt together in prayer, the Archbishop invokino- a blessing on the era about to open for the Princess and the people of Great Britain. It may therefore be said that Queen Victoria's reign was begun by prayer. The young Queen had been carefully trained with her high destiny in view. She had not been much before the public, though by judicious travel she had become acquainted with a considerable part of her future kingdom. Her education had been conducted by the Duchess of Northumberland, under the constant superintendence of her mother, the Duchess of Kent, who devoted the privacy of her second widowhood to the preparation of her daughter for public duty, and her per- fect demeanor and bearing when she first assumed her duties as a sovereign filled everybody with admiration and wonder. The reign, therefore, not only began most successfully, but with unusual anticipation and satisfaction. A new era had indeed begun, for from that time Court profligacy and Court extravagance were at an end in England. The young Queen paid her father's debts In the first year of her reign, paid her mother's debts in the second year, and never incurred any debts herself, nor asked Parliament for any addition to her income. The Coronation took place on June 28th, 1838, and there was more than usual splendor displayed at the ceremony, and more than usual rejoicing all over the land. The scene In Westminster Abbey was a brilliant spectacle. A large proportion of the gentlemen present were either in military or official attire, and the Ambassadors were superbly THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 1 9 arrayed, one of them, Prince Esterhazy, being covered widi diamonds, even to tlie heels of his boots, whilst the peers were in robes of State, and the peeresses \" shone like a rain- bow\" in their profusion of precious gems. The Queen walked up the nave escorted by two Bishops, eight daughters of English Dukes bearing her train, and fifty ladies of rank holding offices in her household following. The Archbishop of Canterbury having presented Her Majesty as the \" undoubted Queen of the realm,\" the building re- sounded with the shouts of \" God save Queen Victoria.\" The customary ceremonials followed, and then the final act was performed by the Archbishop reverently placing the Crown on the Queen's head. The peers and peeresses at the same moment put on their coronets, and the effect of the flashing jewels as this was done was startling in its brilliancy. The Queen was then enthroned in the Chair of Homage, and the peers came forward in turn, touched the Crown, and knelt and kissed her hand. It is a testimony to the truly womanly and domestic char- acter of the Oueen that her marriaee was, what it should be to every woman, the central event of her life, the point on which her whole after history turned. It was generally known that before she came to the Throne an intimate friendship had existed between the young Princess and her maternal cousins, the sons of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg Gotha. Albert, the younger of these two sons, was three months younger than his cousin, \" the Mayflower,\" as the PrincessVictoria was designated by their maternal grandmother. It was, of course, for the Queen to ask Prince Albert to marry her, and not for him to ask her, and on the 1 5 th of October, whilst he was on a visit at Windsor, she sent for him to her room, where he found her alone. They 20 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. talked for a few minutes, and then she told him her love, and that it would ensure her whole life's happiness if she married him. I need not add that the Prince responded with heartfelt gratitude and joy to this outburst of affection on the part of the young sovereign, and that halcyon hours began for them both on that memorable day. Victoria had nevertheless not only to declare her love to die man of her choice ; she had on a later day to tell it to the assembled Privy Council. \" Precisely at two,\" she went in. The room was full. Lord Melbourne, then Prime Minister, looked kindly at her with tears in his eyes, but he was not near the Queen. She then read her short declaration. She was trembling violently, but did not make one mistake, and she felt most happy and thankful v,^hen it was over. The marriage was not long delayed. The wedding was cele- brated on the loth of February, 1840, with a splendor unu- sual, even in Royal marriages, and the popular rejoicing was universal. Contrary to the established custom, by which Royal marriages have been performed in the evening, the Queen's marriage took place at one o'clock in the afternoon, and thus a new precedent was set which was followed all through the reign. The Prince, with his father and brother, left the Bucking- ham Palace at a quarter to twelve for St. James's Palace, and half an hour later the Royal bride made the same journey, accompanied by the Duchess of Kent. The streets passed through rang with joyous acclamations. The Qiieen was dressed in white satin, with a deep trimming of Honiton lace. She also wore a Honiton veil, and was wreathed in orange- blossoms. The satin was manufactured at Spitalfield's, and the lace at Honiton. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the ^ 21 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. Bishop of London took the service, and the Queen made the promise of \" obedience \" to her newly-naturahzed subject. Then the cannons roared from the Tower and the parks, and the bells of London and Westminster pealed forth their con- ofratulations. The weddino- breakfast was given at Buckinof- ham Palace. The marriage was immensely popular. It was a true-love match, and the people rejoiced in it as though no such mar- riage of affection had ever taken place before. There was, however, a good deal of difficulty about settling the position of the Prince Consort. Parliament had given him ^^30,000 a year, instead of ^50,000, which had been asked. His own good sense solved the difficulty of his position. In a letter to the Duke of Wellington, declining the command of the army which had been foolishly offered him, he described the prin- ciple on which he had acted from the first. It was to \" sink his own individual position in that of the Queen — to aim at no power by himself or for himself, but to be the head of her household, her sole confidential adviser in politics, and only assistant in her communications with the officers of the Gov- ernment.\" Even in this line, to which he rigidly adhered, Prince Albert was often exposed to public suspicion, and at one period to considerable unpopularity. He certainly took much part in foreign affairs, and his very last act was to write a memorandum for the Queen on the communication which the Government proposed to make the United States on the affair of Trent. He wrote this on his death-bed on the ist December, 1861. The Queen was reverenced, as no other English monarch had ever been before, for domestic virtues which few other English sovereigns have ever possessed. She was known to THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 2 3 be a good mother, and Prince Albert was known to be a good father; and by these unusual titles to popular affection they gave new strength and popularity to the Throne itself. The first of the Royal children to present itself was Vic- toria Adlaide Mary Louisa, Princess Royal of England, now the widowed Empress Frederick, of Germany. She was born at Buckingham Palace on November 21st, 1840. It is the constitutional duty of the members of the Privy Council to be in attendance at the birth of an Heir to the Throne ; and, consequently^ when the birth was announced there were pres- ent at the Palace the Lord Chancellor, Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Sir John Russell, and many others, with the Duch- ess of Kent, the Duke of Sussex, the Archbishop of Canter- bury, and a host of medical men. They received an early in- troduction to the Princess, but as the young lady was rather noisy, she was soon taken away. The Tower guns were fired in honor of the event, and there were many rejoicings in the country. On the 9th of the same month in the following year, the career of the Prince of Wales had its beginning. He was born at Buckingham Palace, the hour being eleven o'clock. He was also introduced at once to the Privy Coun- cillors and other distinguished people, who signed a declara- tion in the usual way as to the birth of an heir to the British Crown. This second ev^nt made the Queen very happy. The Prince was christened with orreat ceremonial at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Palace, on January 25th, 1842, the King of Prussia being chief sponsor. He was christened Albert Edward, the second name being that of his maternal grandfather, the Duke of Kent. Prince Alfred Ernest Albert, afterward Duke of Edinburgh, was born in August, 1844. The Princess Helena (Princess 24 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. Christian), was born in 1846 ; Princess Louise (Marchioness of Lome) in 1848; Prince Arthur (Duke of Connaught), in 1850; Prince Leopold (late Duke of Albany), in 1853; and Princess Beatrice (Princess Henry of Battenberg), in 1857. The totally unexpected death of Prince Albert was to the Queen so terrible a blow that she can be said never to have recovered from it. Like a destructive flash of liohtning' out of a perfectly clear sky, came the announcement of Decem- ber 8th, 1 861, that he was confined to his room by a very bad cold. A few days later the statement was made that he was suffering from fever, but that it was not attended by serious symptoms, though likely to be prolonged. In another day he was somewhat worse, but still no public apprehension was felt, and when, at midnight on Saturday, the 14th, the people who live within its sound heard St. Paul's bell tolling, and when on Sunday morning the people in the great towns were arrested by a funeral knell, nobody thought at first the meaning of the unusual sounds. The news on that fateful Sunday morning met the people on their way to church and chapel that the Prince had died at ten minutes to eleven the night before, and was everywhere received with consternation and surprise. The body of the Prince Consort now rests in the noble mausoleum erected by the Queen at Frogmore. Since the death of her husband, the Oueen — while not neorlectine State affairs — has lived to a large extent a retired life, and the cere- monial duties of her position have been chiefly borne by the Prince and Princess of Wales. Prince Albert was in the very zenith of his fame and hap- piness when he was taken away. The Queen herself said of his death, that the loss to her was so great that it would be Judge Huddleston of the Supreme Court of England. 26 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. the beginning of a new reign. It was practically the begin- nino- of a new reio-n. The Queen's widowhood severed her from politics. The Court was eclipsed ; and for several years the widowed Queen made no public appearances. The great event of the year 1863 was the marriage of the Prince of Wales with Alexandra, daughter of the King of Denmark. The whole country was alive with excitement and rejoicing. The Princess was accompanied to England by her father, mother, and sister, and was met at Gravesend by the Prince of Wales, who drove with her through the streets of London, amid the enthusiastic cheering of enormous crowds. When Eton was reached, on the way to Windsor, the boys cheered again for the beautiful young Princess. The wedding took place at St. George's Chapel, on the loth of March, the Queen attending in widow's weeds, but taking no part in the proceedings. All the other members of the family were present with the Prince of Prussia and members of many Royal families abroad. The Princess wore a dress of white satin and Honiton lace, with a silver-moire train. Her jew- elry was very magnificent, a riviere of diamonds, presented by the City of London, being alone worth ^50,000. An opal and diamond bracelet which she wore was the o-ift of the ladies of Manchester. At the close of the ceremony, the bride and bridegroom returned to the Castle, where they were received by the Queen. London and many other towns were brilliantly illuminated that night, and the scale on which the rejoicings were held proved the truth of the Laureate's line, \"We are each all Dane in our welcome of thee.\" The honeymoon of the Royal pair was spent at Osborne, the Queen's beautiful home in the Isle of Wight. A mournful incident, which brought the Royal family within THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. I'J the circle of personal sympathy, even of multitudes who have never seen them, was the death of Princess Alice, on the 14th of December, 1878. The death of the Princess on the anni- versary of the death of the Prince Consort was naturally felt by the Queen as a re-opening of the old sorrows. She had been her father's tender and watchful nurse ; she had lived as the exemplary wife of a Prince who was not rich as English Princes are ; and she died of diphtheria caught in the nursing of one of her children, A few years ago a great sensation was caused in European circles by the anonymous publication of a book which, under the title of the Roi de Thessalie, gave a very graphic and detailed account of the matrimonial adventures of the reign- ing Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, the husband of the late Princess Alice, of Great Britain. Notwithstanding her reported denial, there is not the slight- est doubt but that the author of the book was Mme. de Kalomine, the divorced wife by second marriage of the Grand Duke, and if any further proofs thereof were needed beyond those contained in the narrative itself, the fact of its having been dedicated to the Grand Duchess Serge, of Russia, nee Princess of Hesse-Darmstadt, the only lady of the Royal family who showed any sympathy to her father's morganatic wife, would be sufficient to convince the most skeptical. Under the most transparent of pseudonyms the story of the whole scandal is given, showing the part taken therein by Queen Victoria, and it is needless to add that the appearance of the book excited intense wrath in exalted quarters. M. de Kalomine, who was at the time Russian Charge d'Affaires at Darmstadt, became jealous of the unconcealed admiration on the part of the Grand Duke for his lovely wife, 28 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. on whose account he had already been obliged to fight three duels. Warned by an anonymous letter, he met her as she was riding home alone from a tete-d-tete promenade with the Grand Duke in the Heiligenberg woods, and accused her of being the paramour of the sovereign at whose Court he was accredited ; he lashed her face repeatedly with his riding- whip, causing her horse to bolt. Falling from her saddle, and slightly injured, she was carried home, and remained confined three weeks to her bed with an attack of brain fever. On her recovery she found that in consequence of a private tele- gram from the Grand Duke her husband had been recalled, and had been dispatched on a special mission to Japan. About a week after Mme. de Kalomine's recovery the Grand Duke visited her, and having declared his love, urged her to ask for a divorce on the ground of her husband's ill-treatment, and afterward to marry him. Louis IV of Hesse-Darmstadt, who was then only a little over forty years old, was still one of the handsomest and finest specimens of manhood in Europe, and it was not difficult for him to per- suade her to separate from M. de Kalomine, who, with his correctly-trimmed whiskers, short, stout figure, and generally graceless appearance, presented but a sorry contrast to the Grand Duke. Ten months later, in the spring of 1884, Mme. de Kalomine obtained her divorce, and the date on which she was free to marry again fell just two days before that fixed for the wed- ding of Princess Victoria of Hesse to Prince Louis of Batten- berg. Mme. de Kalomine lived so retired and quietly during the whole time that although the Grand Duke's admiration for her was whispered about the city, nobody dreamed that anything serious was about to happen. Queen Victoria. 30 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. The day before the arrival of Queen Victoria to attend the weddinor of her orranddaus^hter, Mme. de Kalomine entreated the Grand Duke to hesitate before finally uniting himself to her. She had fears as to the future, and reminded him that Queen Victoria was most anxious that he should marry Princess Beatrice as soon as ever the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill had been passed in the English Parliament. The Grand Duke smilingly remarked in reply that his respected mother- in-law would know nothing about the matter until after the ceremony, when it would be too late for any kind of obstruction. On the following day Queen Victoria reached Darmstadt with Princess Beatrice. At length the day — April 30th, 1884 — fixed for the marriaoe of Princess Victoria arrived. The wedding was to take place without much pomp and ceremony in the evening. At 1 1 o'clock on the morning of the same day the secret marriage between the Grand Duke and Mme. de Kalomine took place in the Palace Chapel. The only per- sons present were the Ministers of Justice and of the Interior. At the moment of the benediction a terrible thunder-storm ap- peared to predict troubles and sorrows to the newly married couple, who immediately retired to the very room used by the late Princess Alice as her boudoir, where they remained seve- ral hours, while the old Minister of the Interior gfuarded the door, frightened out of his wits lest the Queen should notice her son-in-law's prolonged absence. At 5 o'clock the grand ceremony of Princess Victoria's mar- riage took place. The royal cortege entered the chapel, the Grand Duke leading his daughter, the Queen following alone, then Princess Beatrice, and followlne her the Crown Prince and Princess of Germany, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Battenberg family, etc. il THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 3 1 The Queen was not present at the subsequent State ban- quet, preferring to dine alone with her younger grandchildren. Suddenly, about 1 1 o'clock at night, when she was about to retire to rest, the Crown Prince of Germany arrived and de- manded an immediate audience on matters of the very high- est importance. The Queen, frightened by the agitation de- picted on his countenance, exclaimed, \" Good heavens, Fritz, what has happened?\" In a few words he informed her of the secret marriage which had taken place in the morning. On hearing this the Queen uttered a terrible cry. What ! the husband of her favorite daughter Alice had dared to desecrate the memory of his dead wife by marrying a divorced woman — a mere nobody ! She become so red in the face and ex- perienced such difficulty in getting her breath that the Crown Prince, fearing an apoplectic fit, was about to summon help, when she stopped him. \" Where are they now ?\" she ex- claimed. The Prince informed her that they had retired to rest over two hours ago. Furiously the old lady tore open her door and was about to rush to the Grand Duke's apartments, when the Crown Prince, foreseeing the scandal which would ensue, held her back by main force until she had become a little more calm. She then decided to summon the Grand Duke to her presence. The latter was suddenly awakened from his sweet slumbers by the knocking at the door of a chamberlain, who, in trem- blinor accents, informed his master that the Oueen insisted on his appearing before her at once. His wife, very rightly fear- ing the worst, clung to him in despair, crying that she would never see him again. Her husband soothed her with promises as best he could, and twenty minutes later stood in the presence 32 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. of his Irate mother-in-law, with whom were gathered the Crown Prince and Princess of Germany, Princess Beatrice, and his own Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Justice whom the Queen had summoned. '* You must drive that liorrible woman away this very night,'* exclaimed the latter, \" and you must sign this decree of ex- pulsion which I have already had drawn up by your Ministers, Good God ! if I could drive the creature out of the place with my own hands/' shrieked the Queen frantically. The Grand Duke who, althouofh a Qriant in stature, is blessed with the weakest of characters, and has absolutely no strength of mind, after some hesitation gave way to his mother-in-law's wrath and signed the document. His bride, who, notwithstanding her fright, had finally dropped off to sleep, was awakened about two hours later by the disagreeable old grand-mistress of the robes, who com- municated to her in the most offensive manner possible the Royal decree of expulsion and stated that she had orders not to leave her until she left the Palace. The unfortunate woman, on seeing her husband's signature to the document, understood that she was forsaken by the man who, but a few hours previously, had sworn to love and protect her. While she was hurriedly dressing, with the assistance of her Russian maid, a post-chaise, with an escort of about forty mounted police, stopped at the nearest door of the Palace, and she was hustled into it and rapidly driven to the nearest frontier. The only person to wish her God-speed was the old nurse of Princess Elizabeth (subsequent Grand Duchess Serge of Russia), who conveyed messages of sympathy and affection from her young mistress to the unfortunate woman, and brough to her the Princess's own rug, as the night was Lady Brooke. 34 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. bitterly cold. As she drove away she caught a glimpse of the pale face of her husband peering out from the window, while at the next she perceived the angry face of the Queen. The ex-Mme. de Kalomine took refuge at a convent just across the frontier. Two days later a Royal messenger arrived bearing a written offer on the part of the Grand Duke to create her Countess of Romrod, and to confer on her the estate of the same name, on the condition thai she would surrender all her rights as wife of the sovereign, and never ao^ain set foot within his dominions. She contented herself with returning the letter with a^ in- dorsement to the effect \" that the Grand Duke's wife is not prepared to sell her rights.\" Summoning the leader of the opposition party at Darmstadt, who happened to be a very clever lawyer, she placed the whole matter in his hands. The latter commenced by having a certified copy of the marriage, with the Grand Duke's signature, published in all the Ger- man papers, and then proceeded to defend his client in the action for divorce, on the ground of incompatibility of temper, which the Grand Duke had brought against iier. So cleverly was she defended, that the action was about to fall to the ground, when, at the last moment, the Presiding Judge, won over by the promise of a much coveted title of nobility, suddenly remembered that the Grand Duke held a command in the German army, and that officers are not allowed to marry without the Emperor's permission. On these pre- posterous grounds the marriage was declared annulled and illegal and the divorce decreed. The poor woman now resides in relative poverty at Dres- den with the little boy, issue of her marriage with the Grand Duke. The latter, immediately after the expulsion, was taken i THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 35 off to England by his mother-in-law, who managed to keep him at Balmoral for over three months, by which time he had got over any feelings of regret for his lovely wife. The Crown Prince and Princess of Germany left Darm- stadt in disgust on the very night of the scandal, and the Prince and Princess of Wales did not attempt to conceal their sorrow and regret of so unseemly an affair. Less than six years after the death of Princess Alice the Royal family had again to mourn a breach in its ranks. Prince Leopold had always been delicate, but of late years there had been more reason to hope that he might some day be well if not strong. He had gone to Cannes in the beginning of 1884 to escape from the asperf ties of an English spring. A sprain to his knee in runnin;.^ up-stairs laid him up, and a fit of epilepsy suddenly closed his life. He had not been married two years, and it was scarcely three since he had taken his seat in the House of Lords as Duke of Albany. After his funeral the Queen wrote a letter to the nation, expressing her deep sense of the sympathy that had been felt by Her Majesty and the Duchess of Albany in their bereavement. When this letter was published, the Queen had gone over to Darmstadt to be present at the mar- riacje of Prince Louis, of Battenbero-, with her o-randdaucrh- ter, the Princess Victoria of Hesse. This marriage, as well as that of the Queen's youngest daughter to Prince Henry of Battenberof, orave orreat offense to the Prince of Wales, and to most members of the Royal family. Prince Henry is the son of the Princess Julia of Battenberg, whose blood is of the most plebeian hue, and whose brother, a Hebrew socialist, of the name of Hauke, was killed by the military during a riot in 1849. 36 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. The Queen's infatuation for her son-in-law, Henry of Bat- tenberg, is most extraordinary in a woman of her judgment and common sense, for the Prince, excepting for his good looks, has absolutely nothing to commend him. He is far from brioht, and his conduct before and since his marriage has been anything but admirable. How securely he stands in the Queen's favor is shown by the fact that he can afford to leave Court from time to time, and go either for cruises on the beautiful yacht presented to him by Her Majesty, or else visit his brother Alexander, who incurred Her Majesty's bitterest resentment by frustrating her pet project of a marriage between him and her granddaugh- ter, Princess Victoria of Prussia, whom he jilted on the very eve of the date appointed for their wedding at Windsor Cas- tle, in order to become the husband of the beautiful actress, Mile. Loisinger. One of the most popular, unassuming, and kind-hearted of all the members of the British Royal family, however, is the widowed Duchess of Albany, who has recently come before the public in the role of an inventor. The Duchess, though not beautiful, has a very sweet and attractive face, and while she has truly and sincerely mourned her husband, yet, on the whole, she cannot but be happier with her children now as a widow than she was as the wife of the youngest of Queen Victoria's sons. During the Duke's lifetime, after her marriage to him, she was never free from anxiety and care. For he was not only subject to terrible epileptic fits, but, moreover, he was deficient in the normal quota of epidermis. His veins and arteries were insufficiently covered and protected by skin, and the consequence was that the least exertion, the slightest scratch, THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 37 was wont to bring on hemorrhages of the most alarming character. What rendered matters very difficult was that he was ex- tremely self-willed; and he insisted on marrying the Duchess, notwithstanding the fact that every one of his family was opposed to the match on the ground of his precarious health. He died very suddenly at Cannes, as I said above, in the midst of a terrible fit of epilepsy and hemorrhage combined, brought on by over-exertion. Indeed, so great was the hemorrhage that it gave rise at the time to a widespread rumor that he had slashed himself to death with sharp scissors durincr the throes of the fit. In one way, however, his marriage was a great relief to his family, for the Duke possessed the unfortunate habit while a bachelor of making friends and associates of people who were in every way unworthy of the honor. Indeed, on more than one occasion was the Prince of Wales' forced to interfere in a rather vigorous and stern manner to prevent his youngest and best-loved brother from showing himself in public with men of more than questionable repu- tation, whose association with the Duke gave rise to many malicious rumors concerning his character. The Duchess is a sister of the Queen Regent of Holland, a widow like herself. Both are now in easy circumstances, and their present affluence presents a striking contrast to the bitter penury of their youth at the impoverished Court of their father, the r -igning Prince of the tiny principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont. Only those who have had an opportunity of coming into frequent contact with Her Majesty the Queen are acquainted with the irritability and imperiousiiess of her character, which have not been diminished, but rather increased by a half a 38 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. century of rulership over a considerable portion of the globe. Life at the English Court is by no means agreeable, and popular ideas as to the basking in the sunshine of Royalty are quickly dispelled by the frowns which so frequently cloud the countenance of \" Her Most Gracious Majesty.\" The least trifle annoys her, and although under ordinary circum- stances a woman of extraordinary common sense, she be- comes at times utterly unreasonable, and even harsh. Some of the most loyal and deserving members of her household have been dismissed and turned away almost at a moment's notice, not for any misconduct, but merely because their appearance had ceased to please, and had become tire- some to her very capricious Majesty. There is one case, that of Lord Playfair, who, notwith- Standine his lone and devoted services to the Prince Consort, was removed from his post of gentleman-in-waiting because the Queen had objection to his legs, which, being short and deflected, did not appear to advantage in knee-breeches and silk stockings. Mr. Lyon Playfair, as he was then, has since been consoled by a peerage, and by his marriage to a very charming American girl. Miss Russel, of Boston. Although the Queen's irritability keeps the members of her household in perpetual apprehension of Royal displeasure and wiggings that are extremely Imperial in their vigor, yet she is constantly doing little acts of considerate and motherly kindness which endear her to both her immediate entourage and to her subjects. I saw the fact mentioned in a paper the other day that Queen Victoria had not enjoyed a dance since the year 1861, when she lost both her mother and her husband. This is THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 39 true as regards the State balls at Buckingham Palace, not one of which has been honored by her presence during the last thirty years. It is a great mis- take, however, to be- lieve that she has never danced since then. For at the ten- ants' and servants' balls, which she gives every year at Bal- moral Castle during her stay in the High- lands, she has fre- qiuently trod a meas- u.re with some one of her favorite attend- ants, who, it may well be imagined, enjoy the privilege with a keen relish. On many occasions the late John Brown was her partner, and it was with mingled admiration and awe that both the numer- ous guests, whose good fortune it was to be amono- those ^'^^•'^ 92d (cordon) Highlanders. present, staying at the Castle and the members of the house- 40 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. hold saw the stout Httle lady, their august sovereign, spinning about in the most lively fashion to the tune of a regular Scotch reel. Indeed, so often did the Queen thus amuse herself that she aroused the ill-natured comment in the southern portion of her dominions, to the effect that if she was so fond of dancing she would do far better to select members of the old nobility as partners in dignified square dances than to dance jigs with Scotch menials. Queen Victoria is by no means the only sovereign lady who is fond of dancing. Both Queen Marguerite of Italy and the Empress of Russia are passionately fond of waltzing, and are, moreover, indefatigable. They enjoy a very notable advantage over the remainder of their sex, for, whereas, under ordinary circumstances, women are forced to wait until invited to dance by men, ladies of royal rank have the privi- lege of selecting their partners. This they do through their chamberlains and gentlemen-in-waiting, who bear to the partner of their choice the Royal command to dance such and such a waltz with them. If the cavalier in question happens to be already engaged for the dance with some other lady, he is forced to leave her in the lurch, as everything has to give way to these Royal commands. The gardener of the Queen is a very important personage whose post is no sinecure, for Her Majesty absolutely refuses to eat any fruit save that which is grown at Frogmore, near Windsor, and there is a perpetual packing and sending off huge hampers of fruit and vegetables wherever the Queen may be. By the way, the Queen has now to be very careful about Joseph Chamberlain. An Autograph Likeness presented to the Author. 42 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. ' her diet, and never eats underdone beef, mutton, or veal. Pork, Her Majesty never touches, except when made into sausages. Even the Royal cook has to chop the pork as fine as sand, and put plenty of stale bread-crumbs among the meat, and about ten grains of fine powdered dry sage in each sausao-e, and a little home-cured Melton Mowbray dried. Unsmoked bacon is always cooked with the sausages. Crabs or lobsters are not thought of, and very seldom oysters. The game put on the table must be high, but not too much so, and black currant jelly is always on the table. Her Majesty is a very healthy woman, but not very strong. She drinks little, but at luncheon enjoys a small glass of bitter ale. Then there is always afternoon coffee and milk cake. The tea consumed by the Royal household in England is always bought at a quaint, old-fashioned shop in Pall Mall, and has been bought there during' the reigns of Queen Vic- toria's, five predecessors. It costs five shillings and four- pence a pound, and was for a long while known as \" Earl Grey's Mixture,\" this nobleman having recommended this particular mixture to Her Majesty. When a dinner is gi\\^en at Windsor or Buckingham Palace, fish to the extent of $250 worth is ordered; but for an ordi- nary family dinner three kinds of fish are put on the table, whiting being almost invariably one of them. A sirloin of beef is cooked every day, and is put on the sideboard cold for luncheon. The Queen takes after her dinner one water bis- cuit and a piece of Cheddar cheese ; the Prince of Wales eats a bit of Gorgonzola with a crust of home-made bread. The tea, the cheese, and the royal bed are always taken along whenever the Queen travels. Her Majesty's wine, which is well known to be incomparable, is kept in the cellars of St. i I THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 43 James's Palace, and is sent in baskets of three dozen to wherever she may be, this being done more for the household and guests than for herself, as when alone she drinks only- very weak whiskey and water with her meals, by her physi- cian's orders. At banquets, however, she takes two glasses of Burgundy. The clerk of the Royal kitchens, who always carves, receives $3,500 per annum, the head chef the same salary, and the confectioners $1,500 and $1,250. An allusion which I saw in a London letter, published by one of the New York newspapers, to Queen Victoria's fond- ness for a \"nightcap,\" in shape of Auld Kirk whiskey and Apollinaris, reminds me of an incident which took place on one occasion on board the Royal yacht, \" Victoria and Albert.\" The Queen and her ladies had settled themselves in what they considered to be a very sheltered place, protected by the paddle-box ! Suddenly, she observed a commotion among the sailors, little knots of men talking together, in a myste- rious manner. First one officer came up, then another, look- ing puzzled, and at length the Captain appeared. The Queen, whose curiosity had been aroused, asked what was the matter, and laughingly inquired of the Captain whe- ther there was going to be a mutiny on board. The Captain replied that he really did not know what would happen unless Her Majesty were graciously pleased to remove her seat. \" Move my seat !\" exclaimed the Queen. \" Why should I ? What harm am I doing here ?\" \" Well, ma'am,\" said the Captain, \"the fact is that Your Majesty is sitting up against the door of the place where the grog tubs are kept, and so the men cannot have their grog.\" \"Oh! very well,\" smiled the Queen, \"I will move on one condition — namely, that you bring me a glass of grog.\" 44 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. Frogmore, to which I alluded just now, when talking of the Queen's love for fruit, was the house in Windsor Park 'which was formerly inhabited by the Queen's mother, the Duchess of Kent. In 1863 it was assigned to the Prince of Wales as a country residence at the time of hi*s marriage. It was there that his eldest son. Prince Eddie, was born, some- what unexpectedly, I may say, for the Princess of Wales had spent the afternoon of the day on which he made his appear- ance in the world skatingf and sleia-hin^ on Virc^inia Water. The child was born so quickly after return home that there was no time to summon either the doctors, the Cabinet Min- ister, who should have been in attendance, or even the nurse. It was Lady Macclesfield, the favorite lady-in-waiting of the Princess, who performed the duty of monthly nurse and sa£-e- femme for her Royal mistress, and who was the first to greet the tiny Prince on his arrival in this world. The Prince of Wales soon afterward gave up Frogmore, finding it too damp, dreary, and above all, too near his mother, the Queen, for the latter is exceedingly despotic with her chil- dren, exercising her authority over them not only as mother, but also as sovereign, and ordering them hither and thither, without any regard to their convenience, comfort, or inclina- tions. The Prince loves his independence, and therefore sees just as little of his respected mother as he can possibly contrive to do. One of his greatest annoyances when in her presence is that he cannot smoke. Queen Victoria, notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary, has a very strong dislike to tobacco smoke, and smoking is strictly forbidden in all those parts of the Palace at Osborne, Windsor, or Balmoral which she frequents. Some time ago one of her Cabinet Ministers received a 1 1 a^^ f<K«*-^^-Vy-»» y Ck^yC^x-^ 46 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. letter from her Private Secretary, General Sir Henry Pon- sonby, saying that Her Majesty begged that in future he would not send his dispatches saturated with tobacco smoke. The official in question turned the Royal snub onto a score of his colleagues, for he wrote to each in turn, saying that he had received a letter from the Queen, commanding that they should not smoke while writing their dispatches ! Her Majesty has, of late years, shown a tendency to ignore the claims and customs of Christmas. Before the Prince Consort died, in the days when the Queen's children were children indeed, Christmas created, literally, \" a great stir \" in the Royal house circle, for everybody had a hand in making the monster pudding that was subsequently to grace the Royal table, and great fun was invariably extracted out of the proceedings, but never did the mirth rise to such a pitch as on one memorable occasion when the Princess Beatrice, then the tiniest of toddlers, in reaching down into the recesses of the pan after a piece of candied peel, over-balanced her chubby little self, and tipped headforemost into the lithe mixture. She was rescued in a moment, but not before her fair, curly pate and face were a sticky mass of currants, raisins, peel, and spice. Perhaps the Royal family never enjoyed a heartier laugh together, and certainly Princess Beatrice never screamed so loudly ! It may possibly interest my lady readers to learn that all the washing of the Queen, the Princess of Wales, and, in fact, of the entire Royal family, is done at Richmond, where a laundry has been organized for the special behoof of the Royal households. THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 47 The wages there are exceedingly low, the employees being presumably satisfied for the paucity of their remuneration by the honor which they possess of washing the soiled linen ot Royalty. All the dresses and robes that Her Majesty the Queen has ever worn are kept stored and laid by in large cabinets at Windsor Castle. None are either sold or given away. The practice is a very old one with the British Royalty. THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. II. QUEEN VICTORIA devotes /io,ooo, or ^50,000, every year to entertainments at Buckingham. Palace. These consist of two State balls and two State Concerts, at each of which Her Majesty is represented by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Queen limits the expense of the State balls to ^io,ooo each, while that of the State concerts is fixed at ^15,000. Under no circumstances are these figures permitted by the sovereign to be exceeded. Court trains are not worn by the ladies at these entertain- ments, while the men, unless they belong to the army or the navy, are forced to don white knee-breeches and white silk stockings, which are very trying to the appearance. The second category of the Queen's guests are those who attend her periodical afternoon receptions at Buckingham Palace, which are known by the name of \" Drawing-rooms,\" and which are held for the express purpose of permitting 'Ubutantes to be presented to the Royal family. The majority of American ladies who visit England for the first time appear to believe that presentation at the British Court carries with it the entree to London society, invitations to Court entertainments, and a personal acquaintance with the members of the Royal family. This is a great mistake, for there is so little exclusiveness displayed by the Lord THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 49 Chamberlain's department, in restricting admission to the Queen's drawing-room, that the mere fact of presentation is absolutely without any social significance whatever. I may add the ventilation of the Palace is terribly defective, with the alternate intense heat and icy draughts most injurious to the health, and that the crush is intolerable. Everybody wants to c^ct ahead of everybody else, in order to get through the presentation and back to her carriage, for a Court pres- entation practically involves leaving one's house at noon, alighting at the Palace an hour later, after interminable waits, and standing upon one's feet thereafter, and amid an elbow- ing, pushing, somewhat selfish throng of women, in an at- mosphere laden with strong perfumes, which are a combi- nation of artificial scents, natural flowers, and cosmetics, until about four or five o'clock, when one finally re-enters the car- riage, crumpled, dispirited, faint from hunger and fatigue, and thoroughly disappointed. All this is undergone for the mere sake of spending about sixty seconds in the Throne-room, just the time required to walk from the door up to the spot where stands the Queen, or, as is more generally the case, one of the Princesses repre- senting her, to whom a low courtesy is made. The Royal lady utters no word of welcome or greeting, but merely acknowledges the salute by a slight inclination of the head, and then the presentee has to back out of the room with all possible speed. When the Court is at Windsor, invitations to the Casde are usually sent out by Sir John Cowell, but somedmes they come from the Lord Chamberlain, to whom the necessary instructions have been telegraphed from Windsor. Very short notice is o-iven, and an invitation has sometimes reached 4 5© WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. a guest on the afternoon of the day on which he was expected at the Castie. As a rule, the Queen's guests travel by the 6.30 train from Paddington, and on arriving at the visitors' entrance of the Castle they are received by the pages of the chamber, who always have a list of the people who are expected in their respective apartments. The company assemble in the corri- dor by half-past eight, everybody being in full dress, and those who have a rieht to wear the Windsor uniform are expected to array themselves in that hideous garb. The Queen enters at a quarter to nine with the members of the Royal family, and then the company at once go to dinner. The only personal intercourse between a guest and the hostess takes place after dinner in the corrider, when the Queen always converses for a few minutes with each visitor in succession ; and, after having gone round the circle, bows, and retires for the night. The Queen then goes to her own apartments, where she reads or writes, or listens to a reader for about an hour. Her Majesty occupies either her own sitting-room or the adjoining one, which was formerly Prince Albert's study. After the Queen has retired, the guests and the rest of the company adjourn to one of the drawing-rooms, of which there are three at Windsor, the Red, the White, and the Green, connected by doors covered with exquisite Chippen- dale carvings. These rooms are hung with portraits, and contain many cabinets which are virtually priceless. In the Green Drawing-Room is a Sevres dessert service vv^hich is valued at $250,000. It is a curious fact that Windsor Castle should be one of the only great palaces in Europe which is not supposed to be THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 5 1 haunted, especially when it is borne in mind that it has been the residence of the most cruel and bloodthirsty of English Kings. Hampton Court is haunted, so is the Tower, the latter by an undoubted ghost which has been on the walk for centuries. Whitehall was haunted by the headless spectre of Charles I as long as there was anything to haunt there ; in Sr. James's Palace, Queen Caroline of Anspach, wife of Georcje II, wanders at nioht in the Throne room, utterine moans of deep distress, throwing her shadowy hands over her head in an attitude of entreaty. At the Hofburg or Im- perial Palace of Vienna, the dread spectre of \" The White Lady \" roams around every time a misfortune is about to overtake the reigning family. It was last seen on the eve of the Crown Prince Rudolph's tragical death. At the Imperial Palace of Berlin a gigantic street sweeper, carrying a ghostly- looking broom, appears a week before the death of any member of the Hohenzollern race. In the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg it is a beautiful lady clothed in snowy draperies and crowned with white roses, who is the death messenger of the Romanoffs ; while, according to tradition, a little man dressed in scarlet haunted the Tuileries until the day when the Republic was proclaimed in France and the torches of the Commune reduced the grand old pile' to ruin and ashes. The superb old Castle of Heidelberg is visited at midnight on the vigil of St, John by a whole procession of shadowy figures, dressed in the fashion prevailing under the reign of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and it is asserted that their advent is invariably heralded by strains of the sweetest and most enthralling music. Buckingham Palace is far from showy on the outside, and were It not for the red-coated sentinels w^ho unceasingly 52 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. march up and down before the gates thereof, it would hardly give one the impression of being a Royal residence. The building has been considerably enlarged since it was first built, and is now used chiefly for drawing-rooms. State balls, and concerts, for the Queen seldom resides here for more than a few days at a time. The front of this ugly building gives no idea of the pleasant rooms situated at the back, and which overlook a large and beautiful garden, into which one steps through the French windows opening on to a green lawn, shaded all around by fine and well-grown trees, giving no indication in their luxuri- ant foliage of being in the midst of London. This verdant carpet leads to a crystal lake further on, where in quiet enjoyment broods of water-fowl and several swans live in contentment. The galleries, ball-room, and concert-room, which are reached from the staircase, are of great magnificence. Wall seats, draped in satin, are provided for the company assem- bling in these rooms for a ball, a concert, or any other Royal function, and at one end many handsome chairs are placed for the accommodation of Royalty, with, the Throne-room further on, where the Oueen receives her g-uests in state; and where many debutantes with palpitating hearts, as well as more familiar habitues, have made their courtesies. The whole house is splendidly kept — not a suspicion of dust or anything, which in London means a great deal. The deer-forest is the great sporting feature of the Queen's Highland country-seat at Balmoral, and it is now one of the best in Scotland, yielding from eighty to a hundred stags every season. Balmoral forest extends to about 10,000 acres ; but the Queen leases from Mr. H. M. Gordon the adjoining THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN, 53 forests of Abergeldie and Whitemount, which give an addi- tional 7,500 acres. The latter forest contains the celebrated Corrie Bin, which is the favorite feeding-ground of the red deer, and fine sport is always obtained. In 1874 the Queen enlarged her estate by purchasing from the late Colonel Far- quharson, of Ivercauld, the magnificent forest of Ballochbuie, extending to 10,000 acres, which \"marches\" with the Balmo- ral orround. The scenery is very grand in all parts of the Queen's forest, and, owing to the excellent configuration of the ground, three rifles may be out at the same time without interfering with each other's sport in any way. There is quite a net- work of bridle-paths in all directions, so that every part of the forest is easily reached. Prince Albert was a keen deer- stalker, and a fine shot. In Balmoral forest, on the Meikle Pass, the Queen has erected a cairn to mark the spot where the Prince shot his last stag, which was in October, 1861, on the day before he left Balmoral forever. Next to the royal deer-forests, the principal sporting feature of the Balmoral domain is the salmon-fishing in the Dee. The Queen has a stretch of fourteen miles, including both banks of the river, and beginning at Invercauld Bridge. These waters yield splendid sport during the spring months, and the pools are easy to fish, eight of the casts being among the best in the Dee. There is very good trout-fishing in some of the lochs on the Royal estate, which were originally stocked with trout by Prince Albert. Considering the fondness for horses that seems to be in- born in every American, it is strange that so few of the trans- Atlantic tourists should avail themselves of the opportunity of inspecting the Royal and Imperial stables of Europe. 54 WITHIN ROYAL IPALACES. This is a mistake, for horses constitute one of the pet luxuries of Kings and Emperors ; and the cream-colored horses of Queen Victoria, the \" Orloffs \" of the Czar, the \" Trakeners \" of Emperor Francis-Joseph, and the \" Meck- lenburgers\" of Emperor William are each in their way matchless. Queen Victoria's cream-hued horses reside in the stables, or Royal mews adjoining Buckingham Palace. The first teams of cream-colored horses were brought from Hanover by King George I, and until Queen Victoria's accession to the Throne their successors were supplied from the celebra- ted breeding-stud at the city of Hanover. When, however, in the year 1837, Qiieen Victoria ascended the Throne, and the Crown of Hanover passed to Her Majesty's uncle, Duke Ernest of Cumberland, the Royal cream-colored horses ceased to be imported and were bred in England. The \" Sacred Hanoverians,\" as the cream-colored are called, are very rarely seen by the public at large, save when taken out very early in the morning for an ainng on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. They do no work except on State occasions and remain ever untampered with. They are very showy, dignified animals, conscious of their own importance, and look down on the bays, blacks, or roans in the Royal stables with evident pity and contempt. Napoleon I was the cause of the cream-colored horses being abandoned on State occasions iby British Royalty for black ones during the last great war between France and England. In 1803 Hanover was seized and occupied by the troops of Napoleon, and the French Emperor, who hated King George III, and who, besides all his genius and bril- liant qualities, had an invincible propensity for appropriating THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 55 what pleased him most amo.ng other people's goods and chattels, stole the Elector of Hanover's cream-colored stud, to spite the King of England. Adding insult to injury, the Emperor had actually the audacity to have eight cream- colored horses harnessed to the p-or^eous and much-orilded State carriage in which he and Empress Josephine were drawn to Notre Dame to be crowned. This was too much for the infuriated English King, and in a paroxysm of rage he ordered the cream-hued stud at the mews in London to be discarded in favor of black ones. This state of affairs continued antil the downfall of Napoleon in 1814, at which period the British monarch claimed from the French Govern- ment the cream-colored stud stolen by Napoleon in 1803, but every horse of that tint had mysteriously disappeared from France, and to this day it remains impossible to dis- cover what became of them. The State carriages which are also kept in Buckingham Palace ought to be scarcely less attractive to American vis- itors than the historical \" cream-colored \" above mentioned. The \"gilded ark \" in which Queen Victoria rode to her coro- nation has a very noteworthy history of its own, and certainly is a most remarkable-looking object. It was built in 1761. It is seventeen feet long, weighs four tons, and the figures of the four Tritons supporting the traces are of exquisite Italian workmanship. The panels are beautifully painted, and it is surmounted by a golden Royal Crown. The majority of the other carriages in the Royal coach- houses convey the impression of being built on altogether too heavy lines, and in fact of lacking modern grace ; but, of course, they are exceedingly stately and some of them ex- tremely gorgeous in their appointments. They all, however, 56 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. look as if they had been specially constructed for traction by the huge \" Clevelands,\" which, until a few years ago, were the only horses used by Royalty in London, Within a stone's throw of the mews is the Royal Riding School, standing in the superb garden at the back of Buck- ingham Palace. Itis there that all the Queen's childreo were AUDIENCE CHAMBER AT WINDSOR CASTLE. taught riding by a riding-master of the name of Meyer, whom Prince Albert had imported for the purpose from Darmstadt. It is to his instruction that must be attributed the thoroughly German seat of the Prince of Wales and of his brothers in the saddle. Indeed, it is only the Queen's grandchildren who ride with the incomparably superior English seat. THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 57 The Stables are under the control of the \" Master of the Horse \" — one of the grand officers of the household — who at the present time is the Duke of Pordand. He changes with the Ministry. His deputy and the permanent superintendent is Colonel Sir Charles Maude, who bears the title of Crown Equerry. For her own personal use at Windsor and in other places in the country the Queen invariably makes use of a four- seated barouche, with a rumble behind for servants in attend- ance, and drawn by four invariably gray horses, less than sixteen hands high, and ridden by 'two postillions in very sober liveries. Ordinarily their jackets are black. The car- riage is preceded by a single outrider, and on each side canter two equerries on duty. These equerries, who are colonels or generals in the army, belong to the department of the Master of the Horse. The latter has numerous peculiar privileges, one of which is the use of the Royal liveries during his term of office, and the second is his right on all State occasions to a seat in the Queen's own carriage. The Prince of Wales stables are at Sandringham, where His Royal Highness goes in extensively for breeding hack- neys and cart horses. During the summer his hunting stud is sent down to Windsor for grazing in the Home Park. His stables cost him ^80,000 a year. This, of course, does not include the cost of his racing stud. The Queen's fox and buck-hounds are magnificently kept and trained animals. The historical associations of the Royal pack go back to times beyond the research of consci- entious modern historians, as there were kennels at Swinley before Henry VIII ascended the throne ; and it is alleged by Duke of Norfolk, K. G. Premier Peer of Great Britain and Earl Marshal of the United Kingdom. THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 59 Robert Huish that for at least four centuries wild stags and hinds were hunted by English monarchs. Every one who is an habitue of the meets of the buck-hounds at Uxbridge Common or Ruislip Town End, or a dozen other trysts, must have heard of the famous run of Charles II's reign from Ascot after a warrantable stag, which was not caught until night had fallen, the eager hounds, with their bristles erect. ■t MR BB^^^^^^HH* v v-s.- . •- J' . > ' .. 1 ^hbF^t^BBiIiH ^^^^^H ^^Er^' '' A !• OX-HUNT— TH1-, ^lART. running into their prey at a remote point in Essex, more than seventy-five miles distant from the spot where they found him. It has long been customary in autumn for the huntsmen of the Royal Buck-hounds, assisted by Her Majesty's chief game- keeper, and many other employees, to select from the herd in Windsor Great Park the red deer intended to be uncarted in the ensuing winter before four or five-and-twenty couples ot 6o Within roVal palaces. the best fox-hounds that Belvoir, Badminton, and other famous private kennels can supply. The usual place of deer capture is a grassy paddock below Cranbourne town — a sheltered spot, belted with primeval oaks and colossal beeches. The driving of these selected quarries — all of which have names bestowed upon them, with a view to their becoming as popu- lar as \" Harkaway,\" or \" Lord Charles,\" or \" Savernake,\" or A FOX-HUNT — THE FINISH. \" Coningsby,\" excites the greatest interest and curiosity, and is generally witnessed by a small party of invited ladies and gentlemen, whose names are well known at the meets over which Her Majesty's huntsmen are wont to pre- side. Both the Prince of Wales and Prince Georo-e are passionately fond of fox-hunting, and so likewise was the late Duke of Clarence, who was also an excellent polo-player. During his last stay with his regiment at York the Duke 62 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. was in the habit of devoting several hours a day to this, on<^. of his favorite pastimes. A large number of cats are kept about the mews, one of which, called \"Jack,\" is supposed to be the State 0.2.1 par ex- cellence. He is a magnificent Persian, of an extremely aris- tocratic nature, as he refuses to acknowledge a helper or liveryman, or, in fact, any one beneath the dignity of the State coachman. It was noticed, however, on the occasion of the visit paid by the Prince of Naples to the stables, that \" Jack \" at once recognized the presence of Royalty, and immediately paid his grateful respects to the Prince. Formerly there used to be a number of what might be called \"performing\" cats kept about the mews, and these, on the occasion of Her Majesty's visits, were always made to go through their performances, one of which consisted in their jumping from the back of a horse on to the stall-post, and so on throusfhout the whole ten-stall stables. The Jubilee landau is so named as it was used by Her Majesty on the occasion of her jubilee. It is a posting landau, driven by postillions, and is drawn by six of the cream-colored horses. Like the other carriages it is colored, lake and vermillion, picked out with gold, and is also decorated on either side with the Royal Arms. The wheels are red and gold with springs. This landau has been all over the country when the Queen has laid foundation stones or opened exhibitions. In addition to these carriages, there are no less than seventy carriages of all kinds for pri- vate use, such as when the Queen pays a visit to the Prince of Wales at Marlborough House. These are driven by pos- tillions with four horses, and plain liveries are worn. The Queen's coachman is Mr. Miller, who was strongly recom- THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 65 mended by Lord Bridport. Mr. Miller's special duty, in the early days of his employment, was to look after the thirty- five saddle-horses then kept for the use of the Royal family for riding. It is the maxim of the Royal Mews that every horse should be treated with kindness as well as firmness. The young ones are brought up to look upon the stable- men as their friends ; the result is that while they retain their spirited nature, at the same time they acquire wonderful docility. No bearing reins of any degree of tightness are used in connection with the Buckingham Palace stables. It is interesting, in visiting the State horses in company with Mr. Miller, to see how every one of the horses seem to know and like him. Immediately he enters the stables they seem to perceive he is there, and they turn their heads, as if asking for some recognition. One important point in training the State horses consists in makinor them accustomed to the sound of the drums and bands. It is the practice at the mews for the children belonoinor to the various stable officials to be sent into the stables frequently with their tiny drums ; and in order that the horses may get accustomed to the bands, Mr. Miller says that whenever he meets a band while he is exer- cising the horse, he makes it a point of always following it closely. In the Royal kennels, the Queen's pets are Pomeranian dogs which would not only win the hearts of any dog-lover for their beauty, but who have also earned the exacting ad- miration of the judges. These dogs belong to the Eskimo type of the canine species. They have a long, thick coat that seems to stand out from the body, a tail which curls tighdy and lies close to the back, a foxy head, small, erect ears, rather short legs, short back, and a generally square and 64 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. thick-set appearance, in spite of which, however, they are ac- tive as kittens. Her Majesty's pets are not Pomeranians in the ordinary acceptance of the term, being rather ItaHan Spitz dogs. They came from Florence, where they were purchased in 1888. The Queen always names the dogs her- self. Collies have always been a breed for which Her Majesty has also shown a preference, and this accounts for their num- ber in the Royal kennels. The majority of them are black- white-and-tan. 1 THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. III. ALTHOUGH it would be considered as rank treason in England to question in the slightest degree the repu- tation for good taste, chic, and elegance in dress enjoyed by the Princess of Wales, yet the fact remains that it is altogether and entirely undeserved. The merit of telling the fashion for the fair sex in Great Britain belongs not, as is generally supposed, to her, but to her husband, the Prince. The latter's taste, formed as it has been by his intercourse with the Comtess de Pourtales, the Marquise de Galliffet, the Marquise de Castellane, and others of the most famous grande mondaines at Paris, is above reproach. It is he who, amid his other multifarious occupations, finds time to personally supervise every detail of the Princess's toilets, and no innovation of dress or coiffure is ever inaugurated by Her Royal Highness which has not previously been submitted to the approval and received the sanction of the Prince. The only occasion when she was permitted to follow her own ideas with regard to dress was while her husband was in India, and the result was simply appalling, for by birth and education she is thoroughly German,. and her personal taste with regard to dress is likewise German. Until she married she was entirely ignorant of all the delicate elegances of the \" toilette intime \" of a Parisienne. For a time she had her own way with regard to the dress of 5 65 66 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. her three daughters, and in consequence, although they are nice and pretty girls, they appeared the most dowdy and inele- gant young ladies in the whole of the United Kingdom. It has only been since the Prince was induced to interfere in their behalf that they have been dressed with any degree of chic. The most recent instance, however, of the Princess's somewhat commonplace, and what would be described in London as Bloomsbury tastes, is her craze for photographing on china. The Court Journals gravely announced a little over a year ago that she had completed the entire tea service adorned with the portraits of her family. One can imagine, therefore, the feelings of the Prince gazing on his wife's breakfast table decked with this photo- graph-stained porcelain, when he saw a deep golden stream of tea running down the cheek of his revered mother's face on the teapot while helping himself to milk from a milk jug adorned with the features of his son, and subsequently rinsing his cup in a slop-basin decorated with a group of his family taken in front of the library window at Sandringham. The Princess, who, besides being a pianist of rare talent, plays exquisitely on that most difficult of all instruments, the zither, has now turned her attention to the sweet-toned philo- mele, a stringed instrument very much in shape like a violin, but much more comfortably handled. Not only the Princess herself and her daughters, but also her sisters-in-law are taking lessons, and Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lome, is particularly distinguishing herself on this queer-shaped instrument. , A pretty story is told about the Princess. The scene of it was j the Mansion House, the occasion was a ball that was given The Princess of Wales. 68 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. some years ago, and to which, among other \" invites,\" was a provincial Mayor, who had the honor of being introduced to the pretty Princess. The tale goes, and the truth of it is vouched for, that upon his Worship asking, against all rules of \" eti- quette,\" the Princess to grant him a dance, she replied with a touch of delicate humor : \" I do not know whether you will not be rather afraid ; some of my children are only just recovering from the measles, and you might take them.\" The wearer of the civic chain, however, was equal to the occasion, for, bowing low, he replied : '* I should be delighted to take anything from so charming a source.\" Those employed about the Court and thus brought per- sonally into contact with the different members of the Royal family, speak somewhat strongly about the different manners in which the offspring of the various princes and princesses are being trained up, or, to put it in the homely vernacular of the domestics themselves, \" taught to behave.\" The children of the Princess of Wales have won golden opinions in all directions during their years of pupilage. Her sons, when quite little fellows, used to be allowed to join in the games of some of the Windsor lodge-keepers' children, and would amuse themselves for many a long morning swinging and being swung by their lowlier playmates, with hearty enjoy- ment that never degenerated into boisterous or unruly pro- ceedino-s. When the Princess was complimented on their pretty behavior, she remarked that it was her especial object to teach courtesy and good feeling. The Duchess of Albany has now the same charming repute for inciting her little ones to speak politely to their attendants and to treat all classes alike with gentle consideration. When taking her mornins; THE ROYAI FAMILY OF GREAT BRiTAm. 69 walks with her tiny daughter, if the Duchess chance to meet a orardener or laborer in the grounds, she is at once heard saying to the little Princess : \" Now don't forget to say ' Good morning,' darling.\" But the Duchess of Connaught, excel- lent woman though she is, has educated her offspring on an entirely opposite system ; and rich stories are told of the magniloquence and exacting demeanor of these young people. One of them was heard to impart to his father, with dire indignation : \" Papa, I passed by the sentry in the grounds this morning and he did not salute me.\" \" I dare say, my dear,\" placidly replied the good-natured Duke of Connaught. \" But, papa, won't you have him put into the guardroom for such a piece of neglect ?\" This, however, the Duke declined to do, to the exceeding diso^ust of his offended son. Strange indeed is the blight that appears to rest upon the first-born sons of the Imperial and Royal families of Europe. The list of Princes holding the position either of Heir Appa- rent or Heir Presumptive to the Throne of the old world, who have been overtaken by premature death is one of considerable length, and includes the names of the Crown Prince of Austria, of the Duke of Brabant, and Prince Bald- win, of Flanders, of the Prince of Orange, the Czarowitz Nicolas Alexandrowitz, the Duke of Orleans, the Prince Imperial of France, besides those of many others, including the name of Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince and Princess of Wales, The ultimate demise of the young Prince on the eve of his marriage constituted the partial fulfillment of a popular superstition current in England, according to which Queen Victoria is destined to outlive both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Clarence, and to be succeeded on the ^O WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. Throne of Great Britain by a King bearing the name of George V. Possibly it was just the knowledge of this widespread belief, coupled with the dread of witnessing the realization of the public premonition on the subject, that caused both the Prince and Princess of Wales, to regard their eldest boy with sentiments of more than ordinary parental affection. Delicate from the very moment of his premature birth at Frogmore, he was always a source of particular care and of considerable anxiety to his parents. The Prince of Wales himself gave public expression to a feeling of this kind in 1879, in an address which he delivered on the eve of the dep£.rture of his two bovs for their first cruise as naval cadets on board the \" Bacchante.\" His Royal Highness declared on that occasion that he thought so much of the navy, and had received so much kindness from that branch of the Queen's service in different parts of the world, and that he had at first intended to make sailors of both his boys. But he feared that the delicate state of his eldest son's health precluded the hope. Still, he trusted that his second son, George, who was sturdy, would carry out the traditions of the service, and make a good sailor. Fortunately, the seafaring life on board the \" Bacchante \" proved beneficial to Prince Eddie's constitution, and when, four years later, he took up his residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, after having sailed round the world, and visited every portion of the vast British Empire, it was believed that he had in a great measure outgrown his delicacy of health. At the University, Prince Edward displayed the same ami- able characteristics which had endeared him to all those with whom he had been brought into contact during his life on Duke op- Clarknce and Avondale. 72 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES. board the \" Bacchante.\" And it must be borne in mind that qualities of no ordinary kind are requisite to win and retain the regard of one's associates in a position such as that occupied by the Duke-Prince. .Young England is essentially demo- cratic, and reverence for rank must be regarded as being one of quality that is conspicuously absent from its constitution. It is therefore necessary for the Prince, both on board ship and at college, as well as subsequently in regimental barracks, to steer midway between hauteur and that familiarity which is apt to degenerate into contempt. This he succeeded in doing remarkably well, and in such a manner as to win golden opin- ions from all with whom he was brought into contact, display- inof in the matter much of that grenial tact and considerate forethought which renders his father, the Prince of Wales, so deservedly popular. Nothinor could be more touchinof than to watch him with his mother, to whom he bore much moral and physical resem- blance. She held, at any rate until the date of his betrothal to the pretty and winsome Princess May of Teck, always the toremost place in his thought and in his conversation. He surrounded her with the most loving attentions, and it was in her society almost alone that he appeared to lose that diffi- dence which was not one of the least attractive phases of his nature. He seemed to realize that she understood and appre- ciated him more fully than any one else, and that she at least would never be guilty of attributing to lack of intellectual brilliancy a silence that was ascribable in the main to an unusually modest and retiring disposition. Not that this timidity of manner ever extended to the length of in any way affecting his personal courage and pluck. That was beyond reproach, and manifested especially THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 73 on one occasion in the saddle as a steeple-chase rider over an exceedingly stiff course at York. He rode his own horse, Skraptoft. There were numerous bad falls. But the Duke was more fortunate than his companions, and went over hedges, ditches, and walls in fine style, and without a single spill. He presented an amusing contrast to the other riders ; for while they, every one of them, manifested intense anima- tion and excitement, he retained an absolutely impassive demeanor from the start to the finish. His color never varied, and so imperturbable was his gravity that one might have been led from the aspect of his features to believe instead of riding a spirited and difficult horse in a steeple-chase, he was seated at dinner with the Archbishop of York. It may interest the young clubmen in this country to know that the late Duke of Clarence received an annual allowance of ^50,000 from his father. In addition to this, the Duke had his pay as a Major of the loth Hussars, amounting to fifteen shillings a day, with the usual allowance for forage. Not that the regiment pay can be considered as having been of any great help, for it did not even suffice to cover his mess-bill. These mess expenses consisted of 50 cents a day for his breakfast, half a crown, or 65 cents, for luncheon, ^i for dinner, and ^2 for wine at the same, besides incidental \" pegs \" and bottles of bitter beer throughout the day. From this it will be seen that an officer in the British army requires a considerable private income in addition to his scanty pay in order to make both ends meet. Nor did Prince Eddie's ^50,000 a year go very far, for, as a Prince of the blood, he was expected to subscribe to all kinds of charities ; to keep a first-rate stable, as well as steeple-chasers to run in the military handicaps, and to pay the salaries of at least a 74 WITHIN ROYAL PALACES, couple of gentlemen in waiting. This naturally ran away with most of the money, and it is greatly to the credit of the late Duke that he never exceeded his allowance, and died without leaving any debts behind him. His surviving brother, the Duke of York, w^ho up to the date of his brother's demise had to content himself with an annual allowance of ^25,000, now receives ^75,000. notwith- standing which he is frequently in debt, being far more inclined to extravagance in money matters than Prince Eddie. Until the death of her Royal lover, H. S. H. Princess Victoria Mary of Teck was like that nation which was declared to be exceptionally happy because it had no history. She was born some twenty-four years ago, at Kensington Palace, and is the eldest child and only daughter of His Royal Highness the Duke of Teck, and Her Royal Highness Princess Mary of Cambridge, the Queen's first cousin, and most popular member of the English Royal family. Even when quite a little girl, \" Princess Polly with the golden hair\" was much beloved by the British public, who had first seen her, a pretty, rosy-cheeked maiden of five, leaning over the balcony of Cambridge House, watching the glittering pageant of the Coronation pass slowl}^ along Piccadilly on its way to West- minster Abbey. The Duchess of Teck and her daughter have their own sitting-room in the wing once occupied by the Prince of Wales some thirty years ago, when he v^/'as first allowed by his parents the dignity of a bachelor establishment. The business-room and boudoir combined show clearly how Princess May and her mother spend their time.
