        "text": "Dom Pedro Henrique (13 September 1909 – 5 July 1981), nicknamed the Expected Prince (Portuguese: o Príncipe Esperado) was the head of the Vassouras branch of the House of Orléans-Braganza and a claimant to the defunct Brazilian throne. He claimed the headship of the Imperial House of Brazil as his grandmother's successor, recognized by her as such, in opposition to the Petrópolis branch claim led by the senior branch of the family in the figure of Pedro de Alcântara and later Pedro Gastão.\n\nPedro Henrique was born during the exile of the Brazilian Imperial Family. He was the firstborn of Luís, Prince Imperial of Brazil, second son of Isabel, Regent of Brazil. Due to the resignation of his uncle, Prince Pedro de Alcântara, a year before his birth, and considering the validity of that act, Pedro Henrique was born as heir presumptive to the Brazilian throne until the premature death of his father, when he became heir apparent. After the revocation of the banishment of the Imperial Family, Pedro Henrique saw Brazil for the first time at the age of 13. Despite the pending over the legality of his uncle's resignation, his uncle never challenged his nephew's claim. Pedro Henrique actively promoted the monarchical cause in Brazil associated with national conservatism, which earned him the recognition of far-right Brazilian Patrianovist Imperial Action.\n\nIn the 1960s Pedro Henrique became a member of the ultramontane Catholic group Tradition, Family, Property, initiating his successors as pupils of the traditional catholic intellectual Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira. Despite his efforts in favor of monarchism in Brazil and his recognition by the more conservative sections of society, Pedro Henrique's image was overshadowed by that of his cousin Pedro Gastão, who actively disputed the leadership of the imperial house and was much more popular with both government authorities, society and international royalty.\n\nBirth, childhood and life in Europe\n\nPedro Henrique was born in 1909 in France at Boulogne-sur-Seine during the exile of the Brazilian imperial family, which had been deposed in 1889. His father, Luís, Prince Imperial of Brazil, was the second son of Isabel, Regent of Brazil, and Prince Gaston of Orléans, Count of Eu. His mother was Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. His paternal grandmother Isabel was the heiress to the defunct Brazilian throne and the last Brazilian monarch to have her position officialy acknowledged by other countries' governments. The year before Pedro Henrique's birth, she recognized his father, Luís, as the heir to the succession when Luís's elder brother, Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará, signed a renunciation of his claim to the throne on behalf of himself and his descendants.\n\nThus, at birth Prince Pedro Henrique received the title of Prince of Grão-Pará, according to Article 105 of the Constitution of 1824. He was baptized in the chapel of the Château d'Eu with the waters of the fountain taken from Largo da Carioca, in Rio de Janeiro. His godparents were his paternal grandmother, the de jure Empress Isabel of Brazil, and maternal grandfather, Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta and Head of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies. The prince and his family lived between the Castle d'Eu and the palace of Boulogne-sur-Seine, both belonging to the Imperial Family. He was raised primarily by his grandmother Isabel and numerous preceptors imbued to educate him as future Emperor of Brazil.[4]\n\nIn 1920, his father died in Cannes, France, victimized by injuries acquired in the trenches of the First World War. Also in 1920, the decree of banishment is revoked by the then President Epitácio Pessoa. The grandfather of Prince Pedro Henrique, Count d'Eu, leads part of the Imperial Family back in Brazil. Isabel didn't travel because she was old and sick, making the trip not recommended. Still, Prince Pedro Henrique and Count d'Eu did not stay long in Brazil, because their lives were consolidated in Europe, and decided to go back there.[5]\n\nGiven the death of his father in 1920, Prince Pedro Henrique became Prince Imperial of Brazil, but on 14 November 1921, the would-be Empress Isabel died at the Castle d'Eu. So, at age of 12 Prince Pedro Henrique became the head of the imperial family and thus The Prince of Brazil. Had he became Emperor, his imperial name would possibly have been \"His Imperial Majesty Dom Pedro III, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil\",[7] considering his uncle's renunciation as valid.\n\nHe continued living in France with his mother, Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Sicilies, where she thought he could get better education with his brothers Luiz Gastão, Prince Imperial of Brazil and Princess Pia Maria of Brazil.\n\nFormation\n\nPedro Henrique was educated in France at the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris in Paris. He was described by his grandmother as \"a very intelligent child\". He graduated in Social and Political Sciences by the University of Sorbonne, in Paris.\n\nIn 1925, at the age of 16, the Brazilian government ruled against his request to serve in the military.[10]\n\nMarriage and issue\n\nHe married in Leutstetten on 17 August 1937 and religiously in the chapel of the Schloss Nymphenburg, in Munich, 19 August 1937 with Princess Maria Elisabeth, baptized Marie Elisabeth Françoise Josèphe Thérèse von Wittelsbach (born in Nymphenburg 9 September 1914), Princess of Bavaria, first-born daughter of Prince Franz of Bavaria and Princess Elisabeth of Croÿ. They had 12 children. This marriage served as a pretext for the Duke of Bavaria to confront the Nazi government, as sovereigns and several Heads of Royal Houses were invited, among them the Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and King Alfonso XIII of Spain, exiled due to the Spanish Civil War; the top commanders of the Nazi party were not invited.\n\nThe couple resided primarily in France; during several times tried to live in Brazil, but were impeded due to the difficulties of locomotion generated by the Second World War.\n\nLife in Brazil\n\nPedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará, died in 1940.\n\nPedro Henrique was only able to return to Brazil in 1945, when the Second World War ended. He settled first in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, in the Imperial Palace of the Grão-Pará, and then in the neighborhood of Retiro, in Petrópolis. His cousin, Prince Pedro Gastão, the eldest son of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará, challenged Pedro Henrique's right to the succession in 1946, on the basis that his father's renunciation had no legal force.\n\nIn 1951, D. Pedro Henrique bought a farm, Fazenda Santa Maria, in the town of Jacarezinho, interior of Paraná, where he launched as a farmer. In 1955 the Prince was urged by members of the upper ranks of the Brazilian military to accept the offer of restoration of the monarchy through a military coup that became apparent through the political crisis that the country was passing. The Prince refused the offer, saying he wanted the restoration by democratic means. In 1965, he returned to the state of Rio de Janeiro, settling in Vassouras, an important city in the days of Empire for coffee production. On site called Santa Maria, Prince Pedro Henrique resided until the end of his life.[12] He was active in the monarchist movement.\n\nOn his death in 1981, Pedro Henrique's claim to the throne passed to his eldest son, Luiz, Prince of Brazil.\n\nTitles, styles and honors\n\nTitles and styles\n\n13 September 1909 - 26 March 1920: His Imperial and Royal Highness The Prince of Grão-Pará[13][14]\n\n26 March 1920 - 14 November 1921: His Imperial and Royal Highness The Prince Imperial of Brazil[13][14]\n\n14 November 1921 - 5 July 1981 His Imperial and Royal Highness The Head of the Imperial House of Brazil[13][15][16][14]\n\nHonors\n\nDom Pedro Henrique was Grand Master of the following Brazilian dynastic orders:[17]\n\nImperial Order of Christ\n\nImperial Order of St. Benedict of Avis\n\nImperial Order of Saint James of the Sword\n\nImperial Order of the Southern Cross\n\nImperial Order of Dom Pedro I\n\nImperial Order of the Rose\n\nHe was a recipient of the following foreign honors:[18]\n\nCastroan Royal Family of Two Sicilies: Grand Cross of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George\n\nSovereign Military Order of Malta: Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\nAncestry\n\nPosterity\n\nPedro Henrique married Princess Maria Elisabeth of Bavaria at Schloss Nymphenburg, Bavaria, on 19 August 1937.
