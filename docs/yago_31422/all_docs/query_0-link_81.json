        "text": "The Great Uncoupling, And The Christ Church Meeting\n\nThe Constitutional Convention of 1787 was supposed to be a meeting of the United State's great politicians to create a replacement for the disastrous Articles of Confederation. However it quickly devolved into a debacle just as dysfunctional as the government they were trying to replace. The New England States refused to allow Slaves to be counted towards the representation of states in the new congress, and shot down the three-fifths compromise. With both sides at loggerheads, it was Elbridge Gerry who lead the walkout of the New England representatives and it was Gerry who announced the independence of New England from the United States the next morning. The first President of New England John Adams would later call this, \"The Great Uncoupling\".\n\nAs the remaining members of the convention descended into shock and turmoil, the representatives realized the country needed a strong figure to rally the remaining states together. The last thing they wanted was another walkout, which would only benefit the British. It was Alexander Hamilton (in concert with General Von Steuben in the army) who broached the subject of a constitutional monarchy. What would have been scoffed at before was now thought of as a possibility: depending of course on who was chosen. Von Steuben advocated for Prince Henry of his native Prussia, but this was dismissed almost immediately. No, any King of The United States would be an American only. This left only one logical choice: George Washington.\n\nGeorge Washington was a humble, noble, patriot. All qualities anyone would want in a sovereign. The problem was that Washington did not want to be a King. He did not crave power, nor did he seek it. He was so uncharacteristically flustered by the proposal that he left the Pennsylvania State House and took his horse on a ride through Philadelphia. He stopped at Christ Church and prayed for guidance from the almighty. It was here he was found by a group of men who would convince him to take up the crown: Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and 23 year old Augistine Washington; the only child of the General. None of the men present would ever reveal what was said that night, but by morning's light George Washington returned to the constitutional convention and announced he would accept the crown of America as it's first Constitutional Monarch. His Family motto explains it best: Exitus Acta Probat: The Outcome justifies The Deed.\n\nGeorge Washington announcing his acceptance of the Crown of The United States of America by Howard Chandler Christy (1940)\n\nMarriage Crisis of 1933\n\nKing Lawrence and Queen Maria of the United States were never blessed with children. Therefore the line of succession passed through Lawrence's brother Augustine, Duke of Charleston and his two daughters: Helena and Lucy. Following Augustine's death in 1928, Princess Helena became heir to her Uncle's throne. The subject of marriage for the young Princess intensified after her 21st birthday in 1932. Her Mother Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein championed a European match with a member of her large extended family. She preferred Prince Huburtus of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (The son of her cousin Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha). The King was neutral towards the idea, but the Princess shocked her family by announcing her own choice.\n\nPrincess Helena met Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller at a garden party in New York City in August 1932. She was instantly smitten with the charming son of Baron John D. Rockefeller Jr., and the two would exchange letters throughout the fall of that year. By December she had decided that he was the man she would marry, and on New Years day announced to her Uncle that she desired to marry Nelson.\n\nHer Uncle was surprised by the choice, as the Rockefeller's were the leading figures in Chase National bank, a fact that would not be looked on favorably by the public in the midst of the Great Depression. After several months of arguing with his Niece, the King would eventually soften as he saw how committed she was to this marriage. The King would meet with both Nelson and John D. Rockefeller Jr. aboard the royal yacht Columbia and began the negotiations with his future \"Nephew\". The terms were harsh for Nelson Rockefeller. He would divest himself from his families companies and assets, and would refrain from any politicking (Nelson being a known Liberty party supporter) By nights end, an agreement had been struck and the wedding date set for July 7th, 1933.\n\nTo say that the entire country did not support the union would be as inaccurate as saying that they did. In the Northern states, the response was mixed. While there were those that resented a wealthy privileged man \"buying\" his way into the royal family, most saw him as a decent enough man with several stances that were progressive for his day, such as support for the civil rights of African Americans. In the South, this fact would make him a figure of suspicion at best and villainy at worst. Governor Huey Long of Louisiana would go so far as to announce that should the Marriage go through, then the royal couple would be unwelcome in the state. With temperatures rising across the south, the newly elected Prime Minister Franklin D. Roosevelt would take to the airwaves and through the first of his famous 'fireside' chats calm enough of the population to keep dissent at a low grumble instead of shout. Huey Long would remain a persistent thorn in the side of the new royal couple until his death in 1956.\n\nThe day of the wedding, the new couple were invested with the title given to the heir presumptive: Duke and Duchess of New York. The couple would then embark on a month long honeymoon of the Caribbean aboard the royal yacht in order for the Duke to share his love of Latin culture with his new bride. This would mark the beginning of a strengthening of relations between The House of Washington and the nations of South America.\n\nThe royal family had weathered it's greatest crisis since the Civil War, and in the decades ahead the future Prince-Consort would find himself loved by some, despised by others, and loved by his wife as the greatest agent of change within the royal family in its history.\n\nThe Spanish-American War\n\nPost Napoleonic War Spain was a nation in decline. Centuries of conquest and treasure had now become decades of turmoil and mismanagement. Spain had seen a succession of lost wars in the Americas, Civil wars with the supporters of the Carlist claim to the throne, and failed attempts to topple Queen Isabella II and replace her with a German or Italian prince. Nowhere was El siglo terrible (The Terrible Century) better exemplified than Cuba.\n\nCuba was the Crown Jewel of the Caribbean. However it was one Spain had a tenuous grasp on. Spain had fought Cuban rebels in the 1870s during the Ten Year's War and had lost 200,000 soldiers. Supported surreptitiously by wealthy Americans who saw profit from a friendly independent Cuba, the Rebels never truly went away, and remained a running sore throughout the 1880s and 90s. Weary of another uprising which would result in further Spanish atrocity's splashed across their papers, the United States would send the Battleship U.S.S. Maryland to Havana as a show of force in January of 1898. One month later, the Maryland would mysteriously explode in the harbor, killing 268 crewmen. The explosion would send a wave of anger throughout the United States and the public would clamor for revenge against the barbaric Spanish. With both public and governmental passions swelling, Prime Minister Benjamin Harrison, 4th Marquess of Berkeley would call for a vote on a resolution for King George III to declare war upon Spain. This would be signed in April and the war would officially begin.\n\nThe first combat would begin on May 12, as the United States would invade Puerto Rico. The fighting there would go on until the armistice in August. In June, the American Navy would land troops at Guantanamo bay and would successfully occupy it. On July 3rd, the Spanish navy blockaded in Santiago de Cuba for weeks would attempt to break out and link up with a Spanish task force steaming from Cabo Verde. The Spanish under Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete would sail into the guns of American Admiral George Dewey. (subsequently Baron Dewey in 1899). It was a bloodbath from the outset. The American ships and crew were superior to their opponents by every metric. All six Spanish ships would be sunk with hundreds dead, or wounded, while the Americans would suffer one death, and one wounded. After this battle, the Spanish forces on Cuba would be on their own.\n\nU.S. forces marching towards out of Santiago would fight the battles El Caney and San Juan Hill. U.S. forces including the African American \"Buffalo Soldiers\" and a regiment of volunteer Cavalry under former New York State Senator Theodore Roosevelt known as \"The Rough Riders\" would be victorious against the Spanish forces. After these twin victories, a steep loss of morale amongst the defenders, and the destruction of Spanish naval assets in the Caribbean the government of the boy King Alfonso XIII would sue for peace in August through the British Ambassador.\n\nThe terms would be the independence of Cuba (as a U.S. protectorate until 1900) and the American annexation of Puerto Rico. After two months of intense negotiations, the treaty of Paris would be signed ending Spanish presence in the Americas. The United States would help to prepare Cuba for full independence at which point they would create their own independent government. As a final slight to Spain this new government would call for Prince Jaime-son of the Carlist claimant: The Duke of Madrid-to become the first King of Cuba. He would accept and be crowned on June 1st, 1900.\n\nAdmiral George Dewey, 1st Baron Dewey\n\nKing Jaime I of Cuba\n\nThe Springtime of Nations and the London Conference of 1830-31\n\nThe Europe that existed in the early 1830s was one of strife. The flames of revolution roared in The United Netherlands, Sweden-Norway, and in Greece. The Dutch were fighting a losing battle with the rebels in Flanders and Walonia,the Swedish crown could not secure their recently gained Kingdom of Norway, and Greece was effectively lost to the Ottoman Turks. With so much instability in Europe, Britain called for a conference to be held in London to solve the crises and bring order back to the continent.\n\nThe Great powers of Europe would send representation to the conference in December of 1830. (This would also signal the beginning of both a thaw in Anglo/American relations and America's entry onto the world stage as Secretary of State William H. Harrison was invited as a neutral observer.) A cease-fire was called in both Norway and The Netherlands (The Ottomans refused to accept one) while the conference occurred in the hopes of keeping the revolutionary fervor from spreading to unaffected countries. Initially Britain rejected the Talleyrand plan which called for a division of the revolting Dutch territory along linguistic lines in favor of a unified Belgian state. However, King Louis Philippe of France used the cease-fire to rush soldiers and military supplies into the proposed Belgian territory under the cover of night in the hopes of gaining Walonia for France. This would be quickly exposed and as a result King Willem I of The Netherlands announced he would instruct his soldiers to push back into Flanders and hold it for the Dutch crown. This would cause Britain to relent and accept a modified Talleyrand plan with Flanders remaining with the Dutch, and an independent Walonia.\n\nThe next problem was the governance of the new Walloon state. A prince of either The Netherlands, or France was rejected in light of the revolution and the French attempt at annexation. After a succession of royal names were bandied about, the conference compromised on Archduke Karl of Austria, Duke of Teschen. Karl had been the last Governor of the Austrian Netherlands before the Napoleonic wars and was thought of as a neutral choice for a buffer state between the two angry Kings. He would be crowned in July of 1831 and would relinquish his Dukedom to his second son Karl Ferdinand. Belgium would also be acknowledged as neutral country and its neutrality was accepted in a treaty between the great powers of Europe.\n\nNorway's independence was settled when Great Britain threatened to blockade Sweden if they did not come to the negotiating table. Norway would become independent of Sweden and in exchange Sweden would receive trade concessions from Britain. While the conference was deciding on its leader, the Norwegian provisional congress would elect Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as King of the newly independent nation. He was chosen for his relationship with the great powers of Europe. He was the widower of Princess Charlotte of Great Britain, only daughter of King George IV, and was close with Russia from his service during the war. Leopold was intrigued by the idea of leading the descendants of the Viking warriors of old and accepted the crown with King William IV's blessing. (In reality he was simply happy to be rid Leopold who he did not care for.) He would be Coronated in April of 1831.\n\nGreece represented the greatest problem for the conference to solve. The Ottoman Empire would not relinquish Greece as it was thought it would have a domino effect among the Empire's other minorities. After a multi-national fleet of British, French, and Austrian vessels parked themselves in the Aegean sea, the Ottomans relented. Greece would become an independent monarchy under Prince Otto of Bavaria. However his absolutist tendencies would see his overthrow in 1862. He would be replaced by Nicholas de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg. (Brother of King Auguste of Portugal)\n\nKing Charles I of Walonia\n\nKing Leopold I of Norway\n\nKing Nikolas I of Greece"
