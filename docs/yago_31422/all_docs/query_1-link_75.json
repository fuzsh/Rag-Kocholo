Fit for a King! Who would have thought?).\n\nDifferent Houses take different stances and within their own familial conventions most have proved to be sufficiently flexible to allow \"exceptions\", whether voluntary or imposed by circumstance. Most of the families concerned have survived a non-Part I/Part II marriage; the reality is more that those who continue to insist on (or must adhere to) specific or rigid qualifications run into trouble. The current Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg impasse is one example, while the near-miss of the Bernadotte's death wish for self-inflicted dynastic extinction appears ludicrous in retrospect.\n\nSangre_Real016\n\nAristocracy\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n131\n\nCity\n\nMakati\n\nCountry\n\nPhilippines\n\nwith all due respect, never did i denied such fact.. i believe that it has mentioned multiple times in this thread that each family have their own rules for dynastic marriage.. what i was referring to is in \"theory\" which completely says by virtue on its rules that a dynastic union should be of people of equal rank..\n\nthroughout this thread's discussion, we have seen how Bourbon/Rohan, Grimaldi/Hamilton, Orleans-Braganza/Ligne, Hohenzollern/Raventlow, Zahringen/Beauharnais, Saxe-Coburg/Kohary etc unions were considered dynastic, while a Hohenzollern/Radziwill union was denied, Habsburg/Windisch-Graetz, Romanov/Yusupov union were considered unequl and a Romanov-Bagration union is in question..\n\nthis is the beauty of this thread.. people are able to know and be informed of the rules and the amendments done to these rules.. and that there is no one-size fits all rule regarding marriage equality within the Gotha\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Mar 6, 2013\n\nMarc23\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nDec 5, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,864\n\nCity\n\nphiladelphia\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\ntrue.. that is actually what matters.. and few would question that a marriage of a Orleans-Braganza prince to a Ligne princess would not be considered dynastic as the House of Ligne is among the few families from the Gotha's Section III that is closest to be considered dynastic..\n\nWell,maybe the criteria for this dynastic marriage in this case was belonging to uradel families which de Ligne family certainly is...\n\nLet's not forget that even every ruling family had it's own rules which followed...\n\nLast edited: Mar 4, 2013\n\nSangre_Real016\n\nAristocracy\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n131\n\nCity\n\nMakati\n\nCountry\n\nPhilippines\n\nWell,maybe the criteria for this dynastic marriage in this case was belonging to uradel families which de Ligne family certainly is...\n\nLet's not forget that even every ruling family had it's own rules which followed...\n\nwell, possibly.. not sure really.. perhaps the Lignes Uradel status is enough for the Orleans-Braganza.. but some families like the Romanovs doesn't really care about a family's antiquity, as you said, a Romanov cannot even dream of marrying a Obolensky princess despite it being far more ancient than them..\n\ntrue.. some families would work for others, and some would not.. a Countess d'Udekem d'Acoz may be considered good enough to be Queen of Belgium, but not good enough for a Hohenzollern prince and it would take a Isenburg princess to make a dynastic union.. while a Countess Raventlow is good enough for the Hohenzollern heir.. tricky right? lol\n\nWarren\n\nAdministrator in Memoriam\n\nJoined\n\nJan 22, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n15,447\n\nCity\n\nSydney\n\nCountry\n\nAustralia\n\nIt's not so much \"tricky\" but simply a situation where different families, different Houses and different States had diferent attitudes to the formalising of their internal rules, traditions and conventions. Some \"marriage guidelines\" were based on formal Family Laws, some were laid down and formed part of the State's constitution, probably most had no formal rules at all. In these cases decisions could be made case by case or through family consensus or tradfition, or by a Fürst's individual whim based on his likes, dislikes, personal disputes, family feuds, favours owed and favours owing, precedent, religious stance, social and territorial ambition, and of course the state of his balance sheet and cash flow.\n\nMarc23\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nDec 5, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,864\n\nCity\n\nphiladelphia\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nwell, possibly.. not sure really.. perhaps the Lignes Uradel status is enough while a Countess Raventlow is good enough for the Hohenzollern heir.. tricky right? lol\n\nPrince Sigismund was never an heir...he may be in line for an heir,but he was never an Heir...so his potential marriage would not be treated the same as the marriage of an actual Heir,which Georg Friedrich was,since his father died...\n\nSangre_Real016\n\nAristocracy\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n131\n\nCity\n\nMakati\n\nCountry\n\nPhilippines\n\nPrince Sigismund was never an heir...he may be in line for an heir,but he was never an Heir...so his potential marriage would not be treated the same as the marriage of an actual Heir,which Georg Friedrich was,since his father died...\n\nwasn't he his nephew's heir before he had his sons? well, despite that fact, his father considered his marriage to a Countess Raventlow dynastic, and say if Georg Friedrich failed to comply to his grandfather's will to secure heirs from a dynastic union, them Prince Sigismund and his sons would be heirs to the Hohenzollern dynasty.. am i correct? or could have Georg Friedrich marry a non-sovereign, non-mediatised noble say a daughter of an English duke, can he still legitimize his claim by basing such union with that of his uncle?\n\nLast edited: Mar 6, 2013\n\nMarc23\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nDec 5, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,864\n\nCity\n\nphiladelphia\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nwasn't he his nephew's heir before he had his sons?\n\nHe was just in line,but was never an actual heir...And sometimes the rules are different for the actual Heir and the others...\n\nEmperor Charles of Austria wasn't allowed to marry a Hohenlohe Princess,while his brother was allowed,so the rules are different for the actual Heir and the rest in line...\n\nwell, despite that fact, his father considered his marriage to a Countess Raventlow dynastic, and say if Georg Friedrich failed to comply to his grandfather's will to secure heirs from a dynastic union, them Prince Sigismund and his sons would be heirs to the Hohenzollern dynasty.. am i correct?\n\nI guess,as the Heirs to Hohenzollern dynasty are decided by unwritten House Laws...\n\nAs there isn't any written document left about the House Laws,during the Kingdom of Prussia and the Empire of Germany it was up to the Head of the family to decide consulting all other legitimate male family members...

I hope he finds a Princess.\n\nthing is, even Grand Duchess Maria's claims are being questioned by some of her relatives.. they said that Maria is a product of an unequal union because her father the Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia married Princess Leonida Bagration of Mukhrani..\n\nthing is, the House of Bagration, probably the oldest house house in Europe who once ruled as Kings of Georgia until it was annexed by the Russian Empire.. Even so, the Treaty of Georgievsk which was signed by both Empress Catherine II of Russia and King Heraclius II of Georgia which guaranteed the royal status of the Bagrations.. but still, when Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia married Prince Konstantin Alexandrovich Bagration of Mukhrani, their union was considered morganatic.. ironically, it was said that her father, Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia got a lyyer from the Emperor and Empress saying that \"they would never look upon her marriage to a Bagration as morganatic, because this House, like the House of Orléans, is descended from a once ruling dynasty.\" Nonetheless, legally Tatiana Konstantinovna's marriage was morganatic.. this is from where other claimants base their views that Grand Duchess Maria is not the rightful heir..\n\nnow if Grand Duke George would choose to marry to commoner wife, i personally think i would cause more damaged to their family's claim to the throne.. i think he should marry dynastically to ensure his family's claim..\n\nNGalitzine\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nJoined\n\nJun 12, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n5,276\n\nCity\n\nToronto (ON) & London (UK)\n\nCountry\n\nCanada\n\nIt just seems so odd that families that lost their thrones a century ago are still so hung up on the idea of \"equal marriage\" while those monarchies that have thrived and survived have abandoned the idea.\n\nBrazilianEmpire\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nJan 2, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n1,122\n\nCity\n\nRio de Janeiro and Petrópolis\n\nCountry\n\nBrazil\n\nIt just seems so odd that families that lost their thrones a century ago are still so hung up on the idea of \"equal marriage\" while those monarchies that have thrived and survived have abandoned the idea.\n\nThey're following their traditions. Nothing more.\n\nThe Brazilian Monarchy didn't fall because the members of the Imperial Family were marrying Royals, nor the Russin Monarchy. They were overthrown by coups.\n\nNGalitzine\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nJoined\n\nJun 12, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n5,276\n\nCity\n\nToronto (ON) & London (UK)\n\nCountry\n\nCanada\n\nThe reason for their fall is not terribly relevant. What is relevant is that they lost their thrones a century or more ago and today these people are just commoners with an interesting set of ancestors. It seems more than a bit antiquated for a head of a family to tell someone we can't recognize your marriage because it is not equal when in many cases the country they once ruled over no longer exists (ex. Prussia and any of the petty German states) so your wife and children cannot be HRH Princess.\n\nI did read online that Archduke Karl is planning on de-morganautizing (lol) all of the Habsburg marriages since 1918 which will create a flood of new Archdukes and Archduchesses which is funny enough in itself but I guess a tiny step into the 21st century.\n\nSangre_Real016\n\nAristocracy\n\nJoined\n\nOct 9, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n131\n\nCity\n\nMakati\n\nCountry\n\nPhilippines\n\nIt just seems so odd that families that lost their thrones a century ago are still so hung up on the idea of \"equal marriage\" while those monarchies that have thrived and survived have abandoned the idea.\n\nits probably because those who only have the name tends to hold on to tradition while those who have power can actually bend the rules.. we'll that is how i think it is..\n\nwell, 50 years ago, one cannot say the same thing.. someone like Kate Middleton could have never become a prospect Princess of Wales, much more to be the Queen of England with her pedigree.. back then, all of the sons of Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark were stripped of their tittles because they married commoners.. and no commoners until Letizia was a prospect Queen of Spain.. Grand Duchess Josephine Charlotte said to have looked down on her daughter-in-law for being a commoner.. only those who have followed the tradition into marrying someone of noble blood are Belgium and Liechtenstein.. others broke tradition..\n\nMarc23\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nDec 5, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,864\n\nCity\n\nphiladelphia\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nYes, she would be HH Princess Gabriela of Kent.\n\nBut I'm not certainly if this marriage would considered an equal one. She can be the daughter of a Prince, but she's a commoner.\n\nTrue,but it can also depend from which point of view,as some Houses require only full membership of the a certain House for equal marriage purposes and Lady Gabriella is a full member of the ruling House,no matter she is only a Lady...\n\nFor example,if the choice for equal marriage would be between Lady Gabriella Windsor,as the daughter of a Prince,full member of the reigning House with most equal blood among younger royals,who is considered a commoner just by a twist of fate or the mediatized Countess von Graevenitz,equal to the royals by the birth right,but with merely noble ancestry for quite a while,what do you think who would be chosen and why?"
