        "text": "M\n\nMa (1) â (40 â 79 AD)\n\nChinese empress consort (60 â 75 AD)\n\nMa was the daughter of the Marquis Ma Yuan, general of the Emperor Guangwu and his wife Lady Lin. Her father and much of his army died of the plague whilst involved in an expedition against the Wulin tribes (49 AD) and his enemies at court succeeded in posthumously blackening his name which resulted in the family being stripped of their titles and benefices. Despite this disgrace Ma became a consort of the Crown Prince Liu Zhuang, and maintained excellent relations with her mother-in-law, the Empress Yin Lihua and the other royal wives alike.\n\nMa quickly attained her husbandâs favour and supplied him with beautiful ladies from the court to share his bed, so he would have sons. She herself remained childless. At the command of her husband she formally adopted Prince Da, the son of her niece and raised him as her own. Her husband succeeded Guangwu as the Emperor Ming (57 AD) and several years later Ma was accorded the imperial styles and titles (60 AD). At the same time Ming raised up Da as crown prince. She retained her husbandâs respect and admiration because she refused to allow her relatives to profit from her position, and she was consulted concerning troublesome matters of state, her advice always carefully given. With the executions that followed the abortive conspiracy of her brother-in-law Prince Liu Ying (71 BC) the empress successfully interceded on behalf of many and the retribution was tapered off.\n\nMa survived her husband as Empress Dowager (75 â 79 AD) and Da ascended the throne as Emperor Zhang. When Zhang wanted to create Maâs brothers marquesses she refused to consider it as their rank did not deserve it. When he gave them the titles they desired anyway (79 AD) the Empress Dowager so arranged it that they resigned their lucrative government positions, and thus removed some of their acquired wealth. A woman of scholarly tastes Ma educated the sons of Zhang in the wisdom of Confucius and established a mulberry garden for silkworms which provided some of the silks used in the Imperial household. Sometimes known by the name Mingde she was revered as âthe understanding and virtuous empress.â\n\nMa (2) â (c1340 â 1382)\n\nChinese empress consort (1368 â 1382)\n\nMa was the daughter of the leader of the Red Turbans, a military group which opposed the overlordship of the Mongol empire. This rebel group was joined by her future husband (1353), Zhu Yuanzhang (1328 â 1398), the son of a common labourer, who later married Ma (c1355), and governed the region around Nanjing. Zhu Yuanzhang later succeeded as emperor with the name Hongwu (1368), and Ma was accorded the Imperial title, though her marriage remained childless.\n\nRemembered for her kindly and motherly nature, the empress died aged in her early forties, and was interred at Nanjing. Her husbandâs successor, his grandson, Emperor Jianwen (1398 â 1402) was married to one of the empressâs own relatives, another Ma, who was granted the Imperial title, but died young (1395). The Emperor Yongle (1403 â 1424) is officially recorded as the child of the elder Empress Ma, but he was most probably the child of a concubine who was adopted by the empress (1360).\n\nMa (3) â (c1377 â 1395)\n\nChinese empress consort\n\nMa became the wife (c1390) of the Emperor Jianwen (1399 â 1402), to whom she bore two sons who did not succeed to the Imperial throne. She was the related to the Empress Ma, the wife of the Emperor Hongwu, and came from a powerful military family. Jianwen was offically placed as co-ruler with his father, but though he and Ma were accorded the Imperial titles, Hongwu retained real power. Empress Ma died young, before her husband succeeded his grandfather as sole ruler, and came to his ultimate disastrous and ignominious end.\n\nMaacah â (c975 â after 908 BC)\n\nHebrew queen consort\n\nMaacah was the daughter of Absalom and granddaughter of King David. She became the favourite wife of her cousin King Rehoboam (c967 â 910 BC), the son of Solomon. Rehoboam also married her sister Mahalath at the same time.Queen Maacah was the mother of Rehoboamâs son and successor Abijah. During her sonâs reign (911 â 908 BC) she was an influential person at court being granted the rank of queen mother. With Abijahâs death, Maacah appears to have ruled as regent for her grandson, King Asa. Later, Asa caused her to be formally deposed, and withdrew the honours granted her because of her involvement with idolatry, though it is possible that these charges could have been arranged by the young kingâs councillors in order that the queen mother be removed from power.\n\nMaacah of Geshur â (fl. c1000 â c980 BC)\n\nHebrew princess\n\nMaacah of Geshur was the daughter of Talmai, King of Geshur, and was given as a secondary wife to David, King of Israel, to cement a peaceful alliance. Never accorded the title of queen, Maacah was the mother of two of Davidâs children. Her beautiful daughter Tamar was raped and by her half-brother, Amnon. Her son Absalom, after murdering Amnon for dishonouring his sister, fled to the court of Maacahâs father, at Geshur. Absalom was later removed by his stepmother Bathsheba and half-brother Solomon, on the grounds of treason, after he attempted to marry Abishag, his elderly fatherâs widow.\n\nMaar, Dora â (1907 â 1997)\n\nFrench artist and photographer\n\nBorn Theodora Markovic (Nov 22, 1907) in France, she was the daughter of an architect, and was raised in Argentina, South America.Dark-haired and attractive, she came to Paris (1925) where she was a model for Man Ray (1890 â 1976), the noted Dadaist and surrealist photographer, and adopted the proferssiona; name of âDora Maar.â She then joined the Union of Intellectuals Against Fascism. After meeting the artist Pablo Picasso she recorded the painting of his piece Guernica (1937) using photography.\n\nMaar was Picassoâs mistress for almost a decade but was forced to share his affections with his longtime lover, Marie Therese Walter. She was the model for several of Picassoâs paintings including Weeping Woman (1937), Woman Reclining With a Book, Bust of a Seated Woman and Portrait of Dora Maar (1942), amongst others. With the end of her relationship with Picasso, Maar embarked upon a relationship with the writer James Lord, fifteen years her junior, who published an account of their affair in a memoir (1993). During the 1950âs Dora Maar turned increasingly to painting, and an exhibition of her work was held (1990) at the Paris gallery 1900 â 2000. Dora Maar died (July 16, 1997) aged eighty-nine, in Paris.\n\nMaas, Audrey Gellen â (1934 â 1975)\n\nAmerican author and film producer\n\nAudrey Gellen was born (Dec 7, 1934) in New York. She became the wife of Peter Maas (1929 â 2001), the novelist and screenwriter. Audrey Maas wrote screen adaptations for several television productions such as Our Town (1959), The Philadelphia Story (1959), The Heiress (1961), and Harvey (1972). She later went into television production with A Moon for the Misbegotten (1975) and Eleanor and Franklin (1976). Maas produced the film Alice Doesnât Live Here Anymore (1974). Audrey Maas died (July 2, 1975) aged forty.\n\nMaathorneferure (Manefrure) â (c1262 â c1210 BC)Â\n\nQueen consort of Egypt\n\nMaathorneferure was the daughter of Hattsulis III, King of the Hittites and his wife, the Queen Pudu-hepa. She became one of the wives of the famous King Ramesses II (c1305 â 1213 BC) in the thirty-fourth year of his reign (c1246 BC) after considerable diplomatic wrangling. The marriage was an imprtant one in Egyptian history and it marked the final reconciliation of the two countries, formerly enemies since the reign of King Ay in the previous century. The celebrations lasted for a full year. The name Maathorneferure was assumed at her marriage, her former name remains unknown. The marriage proved such a success that Ramesses married a second Hittite princess.\n\nMaathorneferure was raised to the rank of âGreat Wifeâ which she shared with his Ramessesâ other chief queens, which included her stepdaughters, Bintanath I, Merytamun and Nebttawy. Her name which meant âshe who beholds the Falcon (king) that is the splendour of Re,â appeared on monuments of Pi-Ramesses, as a full queen on royal statuary and on glazed plaques, used as amulets or laid in foundation deposits. The queen was depicted with her father on a stela at Abu Simbel and was remembered in the so-called Bentresh stela of the Ptolemaic period, which is preserved in the Louvre Museum in Paris. In later years the queen appears to have retired to the royal estate at Gurob and died during the reign of her stepson, Merneptah.\n\nMaatkare I â (fl. c1100 â c1050 BC)\n\nQueen consort of Egypt\n\nMaatkare I was the daughter and later chief queen to King Pinudjem II who ruled (c1070 â c1032 BC), though she has been incorrectly claimed as a daughter of King Psusennes I. As a child Maatkare became consecrated as priestess to the Theban god Amun and received the honorific title âGodâs Wife of Amun.â She is depicted thus as a child. Her mummy was discovered inside the tomb of Queen Inhapi at Der-el-Bahri (1881) and entombed with her was a mummified pet monkey, thought by the original excavators to her own child. This mistake was the cause of some wildly romantic stories and theories which were circulated concerning Maatkareâs supposed fall from grace. Her mummy is preserved in the Cairo Museum.\n\nMaatkare II â (fl. c950 â c920 BC)\n\nQueen consort of Egypt\n\nMaatkare II was the daughter of King Psusennes II and became the wife of King Osorkon I (c960 â c886 BC). At her fatherâs death (c945 BC), the throne was taken by Shoshenq I who caused Maatkare to be married to his son and heir Osorkon. Her rights to the throne as heiress were set forth in a long inscription in the temple of Karnak. Their son and heir, Shoshenq served as high-priest but predeceased his father.\n\nâMabâÂ Â see Â Â Â Fotheringhame, Pattie Lewis\n\nMabel of BellemeÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â Â Talvas, Mabel\n\nMabel of Bury St Edmunds â (fl. 1239 â 1256)\n\nEnglish medieval embroiderer\n\nMabel of Bury St Edmunds worked for the family of King Henry III (1216 â 1272) and his wife Eleanor of Provence. Her name was mentioned frequently in surviving records. Mabel was highly paid for her work, which included chasubles and religious vestments for use in the royal chapel, which were decorated with precious gems and pearls. She also produced a banner with images of the Virgin Mary and St John the Baptist (1244). Over a decade after she had left the royal service, Mabel received gifts from the king in recognition of her services.\n\nMabena â (fl. c470 AD â c500)\n\nWelsh saint\n\nSometimes called Mabina and Maby, is believed to have been one of the many children or grandchildren of the Welsh king Brychan of Brecknock, and his wife Ribrawst. She was the sister or niece of St Eiluned (Almedha), but no details remain recorded of her life. Mabena was represented in a stained glass window in the church of St German in Cornwall, seated, with a dead Christ, crowned with thorns, resting in her lap. The church dedicated to St Mabe in the village of the same name is probably identical with Mabena.\n\nMaboshoane â (c1875 â c1906)\n\nAfrican queen consort\n\nMaboshoane was born a member of the Mafokeng tribe. She was married (c1894) to Mitchell (c1850 â 1922), the principal chief of the Matseâekheng in Lesotho.

The Macarthursâ were later granted more crown land at Camden where Elizabeth began successful experiementation with merino sheep. With this project she had the assistance of her husbandâs nephew, Hannibal Macarthur, and it would form the basis frm which would eventually develop the Australian wool industry. Governor Lachlan Macquarie later granted the couple a further six hundred acres in recognition of Elizabeth Macarthurâs contribution to the fledgling colonyâs growing agricultural system.

A prominent member of the National Council of the Independent Labour Party (1909 â 1912), Mary campaigned for female munition workers during WW I.

Her family, the house of Macduff, had long claimed the right to crown the Scottish kings as an hereditary privilege, but Isabellaâs brother, the earl of Fife, head of the clan, was absent in England, and her husband was Robert the Bruceâs bitter enemy. The countess stole away from her husbandâs castle and hurried, with the best horse in his stables, to Scone, where she arrived just in time to place the crown on Bruceâs head, as the nearest available representative of the Macduff family. In 1306 she entered the household of the new queen, Elizabeth de Burgh, but was captured by the English soon afterwards.\n\nEdward caused the countess to be closely confined within a latticed cage in the turret of Berwick Castle. Lord Buchan was defeated and killed at the battle of Inverary on the Don River (1308). Lady Buchan was kept at Berwick until Edward II ordered that she be released for a milder custody within a religious house in the town (1310). She was finally released (1313) to the custody of Henry de Beaumont, nephew to her late husband, but died soon afterwards (before Aug, 1314), perhaps from the rigours of her years of imprisonment.\n\nMacedonia â (fl. c520 â c530)\n\nGreek patrician\n\nMacedonia died aged twelve, and became the subject of verses preserved in the Anthologia Graeca, written by Paul the Silentiary, which recorded the grief of her sorrowing parents.

She published two novels Julian the Magician (1963) and King of Egypt, King of Dreams (1971), and two collections of short stories Noman (1972) and Nomanâs Land (1985). She adapted the Greek tragedy The Trojan Women by Euripides, for the modern stage (1978) and later published the translation (1981).\n\nMcFall, Frances ElizabethÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Â Grand, Sarah\n\nMacFie, LucyÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Rothes, Lucy Noel Martha, Countess of\n\nMacGibbon, Harriet â (1905 â 1987)\n\nAmerican stage, television, and film actress\n\nHarriet MacGibbon was born in Chicago, Illinois the daughter of a physician.
