LIBRARIAN TO THE CORPORATION OF THB CITY OF LONDON. LONDON: WILLIAM TEGG. 1870. JOHN CHILDS AND SON, PRINTERS. TO THE READER. IN submitting this work in its present form to the public, my apology (if any be necessary) may be thus briefly stated. Having been requested by the publisher of the well-known and popular work entitled \" Tegg's Chronology \" (the first edition of which was published in 1822), to revise and modernize it for a new edition, I at once en- tered upon the work, but, finding therein so much that was unnecessary to the present generation, and so many additional particulars requisite to bring the work down to the present time, I have, with his consent, attempted a reconstruction of the work. No exertions have been spared to afford correct information on all subjects, the original authorities having been consulted where possible. Considerable care has also been taken with the History of London, and the London Companies, &c., &c. The lists of names having been alphabetically arranged, will, it is hoped, facilitate reference. Craving the indulgence of my readers for the errors which must inevitably have found their way into a work of this magnitude, and compiled from so many sources, and their assistance in pointing them out for correction in any future edition, I beg to subscribe myself, Most respectfully, THE COMPILER. 2000160 DICTIONARY CHRONOLOGY, AALBORG ABBEYS AALBORG, Jutland, taken by the Swedes in 1658 ; and at the peace of Roskild restored, Feb. 25, 1658 ; the Prussians occupied the town during the late cam- paign, 1864.

ABHORRERS, a political party in the reign of Charles II., who denounced the system of petitioning pursued by Shaftesbury and his friends to importune the king to re-assemble Parliament. An address from the grand jury and justices of Essex declared an abhorrence of these petitions : hence they were stigmatized as the Abhorrers. Petitioners and Abhorrers, in 1 680, divided the nation, which a few weeks later received the name of Whigs and Tories. ABINGDON, Berkshire, is supposed to be the Claveshoo of the Saxon annals. Its monastery was founded in 686, destroyed by the Danes in the reign of Alfred, 871. It was rebuilt in the tenth century, and was a mitred abbey, and at its dis- solution its yearly rental was ^1876 lor. <)d. Eldred, grandson of Alfred, laid the first stone of the New Abbey, 955. William I. celebrated his Easter at this town, being entertained by Robert D'Oilly, 1084. The town incorporated, 1557. It was the head-quarters of Charles I. in the civil wars. Captured by the Parliamentarians under Earl of Essex, May 25, 1644, who here placed a garrison for the Parliament, of which General Browne was governor. A cruel custom is said to have prevailed within this garrison of hanging all the Irish prisoners with- out a trial, a practice so notorious that \" Abingdon Law\" became proverbial. ABJURATION, Oath of, against Popery. First required, 25 Charles II. c. 2, 1672 ; against the Pope and the Pretender, 13 William III. c. 3,. 1 701 ; a Bill introduced by Mr C. W. W.

ABRAHAM, Era of, so called from the patriarch. It was used by Eusebius in 313, and began Oct. i, 2016 B.C. To reduce this era to the Christian era subtract 2015 years and 3 months. — Nicolas. ABRAHAMITES, a religious sect, suppressed by a patriarch of Antioch ; it reappeared between 800 and 900, but was annihilated for worshipping images. 4 ABSENTEE-TAX ACADIA ABSENTEE-TAX, levied in Ireland, 1634, on the profits, fees, emoluments, and pensions of absentees, 1715 ; it ceased, 1753; reimposed, 1800, but repealed the next year. ABSTINENTS, a mild sect of religionists, who appeared in France and Spain about the year 300, and repudiated wine, flesh, meat, and marriage. ABYSSINIA, Africa. The Abyssinians under King Elesbaan, defeated and de- stroyed the Homerites, A.D. 522 ; the natives were subsequently expelled their country. The kingdom was restored in 1268. The Portuguese sent several mission- aries into the country, and they converted to the Romish Faith even the Emperor Lusneius, in the I5th century, but they obtained religious liberty in 1631. Major Harris was sent on a political mission to the country, 1841. The Church Mis- sionary Society sent out two missionaries in 1829, but on account of the op- position of the native priests, they were compelled to return, 1838.

The English Government determined to send out an expedition to obtain their release, Aug. 1867. ABYSSINIAN ERA is reckoned from the Creation, which they place in the 5493rd year before the Christian era, on the 29th of August, old style ; and their dates will consequently exceed ours by S492 years and 125 days. They have 12 months of 30 days each, and 5 days added at the end. To reduce Abyssinian to the Julian year, subtract 5492 years and 125 days. ACACIA brought from North America, 1640. ACADEMY, an association of learned men, and so called from the groves of Academus, in the neighbourhood of Athens. In the I5th century the term Academy was revived in Italy, the first century in which literary and scientific academies were established in the modern form. The popular use of the word is sometimes perplexing ; hence in the voluminous catalogues of the British Museum, all acts, memoirs, transactions, journals, minutes, &c., of academies, institutes, associations, and societies, learned, scientific, or literary, are entered under the general name Academies, according to the county or town at which the society is held. The following are the principal Academies in Europe : — Antweip : Academy of Arts, founded, July 6, 1663; enlarged, June 17, 1796. Austtia: Academia Naturae Curiosorum, at Vienna, 1652 ; but in 1687 called Academia Csesareo Leopoldena ; Arts and Sciences of Vienna, 1705; Surgical, 1783. France: Academic Franfaise, 1635 ; Academic Royale des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, 1663 ; Sciences, 1666 ; National Institute, 1795 ; Celtique, 1807. There are likewise academies in many of the provincial capitals of France. Germany : Royal Society of Gottingen, 1733 ; Electoral Academy of Science at Munich, 1760. Italy: Academy della Crusca, at Florence, 1582; but afterwards called the Royal Florentine : Sciences and Belles Lettres, at Naples, 1779 ; Herculanean, at Naples, 1755 ; Etruscan Antiquities, at Cortona, 1726; Royal Academy of Turin, 1757.

Russia and Poland: Imperial, at Petersburg, 1725; Royal, at Warsaw, 1753. Spain: at Madrid are two — the Royal Academy of Spain, 1714; and Historical, 1730. There is also one of History and Geography at Valladolid, 1753; a Literary Academy at Seville, 1753. Sweden: at Stockholm are two — Scientific, 1739; Belles Lettres, 1753. Copenhagen, Sciences, 1742. Those in the United Kingdom are described under their names. ACADIA, America. Discovered by John Cabot, the Spanish Navigator, in 1497. The French first made a settlement here in 1604. See Nova Scotia. ACAPULCO ACTON BURNEL 5 ACAPULCO, Mexico. A Spanish galleon, Nostra Seigniora de Cabadonga, inter- cepted by Gen. Anson in the Straits of Manilla, June 20, O. S. 1743. It was manned by 600 sailors, and laden with treasure to the value of £313,000, and reached Spithead June 15, 1744. The town bombarded by the troops of Gen.

ACCLIMATISATION SOCIETY, established in London, June, 1860; branch societies have since been established in several countries. ACHAEAN LEAGUE, a confederacy began B.C. 284, by the inhabitants of Patne, Dyme, and Pharse, which continued for 130 years, till at last they were attacked by the Romans, and the league totally destroyed, B.C. 147. ACHALZIE, battle between the Russians and Turks, Aug. 24, 1828. ACHONRY BISHOPRIC, founded by St Finian, 530, and continued a separate see till 1585. It is now united with Tuam and Killala. ACHROMATIC TELESCOPES, first invented by Mr John Dollond, optician, of London, in 1758. ACOUSTICS. The doctrine of the different sounds of vibrating strings of different lengths, and the communication of sounds to the ear by the vibration of the at- mosphere, probably first explained by Pythagoras, about B. c. 500 ; and mentioned by Aristotle, about B. c. 300. The conj ecture of Aristotle first explained by Galileo, A. D. 1600; investigated by Newton, 1700. Galileo's theorem of the harmonic curve demonstrated by Dr Brooke Taylor, 1714, and further perfected by . D'Alembert, Euler, Bernoulli, and La Grange in the i8th century. ACRE (ST JEAN D'), a town of Syria, anciently called Ptolemais. In the crusades it was taken by Richard I. and Philip Augustus of France, after a siege of two years, July 12, 1191. Taken by Edward I., June 17, 1271. At this place his wife Eleanora gave birth to a Princess, named Joanna of Acre. In 1291 the Sultan Khalil marched against the town at the head of 60,000 horse, and 140,000 foot. After a siege of 33 days the Mamalukes made a general assault, the city was stormed and taken, and 60,000 Christians were put to death or sold into slavery ; the churches and fortifications were destroyed. In the 1 8th century, Sheik Daher fortified the town ; and his successor, Jezzar Pasha, built a new mosque. It was besieged but not taken by Bonaparte in 1799 ; and on July 2, 1832, was taken by Ibrahim Pasha. It was stormed by Admiral Sir R. Stopford, in the Phrenix steamer, Nov. 2, 1840, taken on the 3rd, and is memorable for being the first occasion of the use of steam in battle. Mr Burford, 1841, exhibited a panoramic view of St Jean d'Acre under bombardment by the British fleet. ACROPOLIS of Athens, built and fortified, B.C. 1057 ; partially destroyed, A.D. 1687; taken from the Turks by the Greeks, June 21, 1822; retaken by them, May 17, 1827. ACS, battle between the Austrians, Russians, and the Hungarians, the latter defeated, July 2, 1849. ACTIATIC ERA, founded on the battle of Actium, which rendered Augustus master of the Roman Empire. This event took place on Sept. I, 30 B.C. The Romans commenced this era on ist Jan. A.U.C. 724, and in the i6th of the Julian era. — Nicolas. ACTIVE, Indiaman, lost in Margate Roads, 1803. ACTON BURNEL, or Shrewsbury, a parliament held at, OcL 2, when an act was passed, called the \"Statute Merchant,\" against debtors, OcL 12, 1283. 6 ACTRESSES ADMINISTRATIONS ACTRESSES first appeared at the Vere Street Theatre, Dec. 8, 1660. A few days after Pepys has the following entry in his Diary : \"Jan. 3, 1660-1. To the Theatre [Lincoln's Inn Fields], where was acted ' Beggar's Bush,' it being very well done ; and here the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage.\" In 1656, indeed, Mrs Coleman, wife to Mr Edw. Coleman, represented 'lanthe' in the first part of the ' Siege of Rhodes ; ' but the little she had to say was spoken in recitative. Sir W. Davenant's patent, 1662, contained a clause per- mitting all women's parts to be acted by females. ACTS OF PARLIAMENT. See Statutes. The ancient ceremonial of giving the royal assent to acts was more graceful and significant than the modern practice. It was called \" Sceptring the Act;\" the sovereign extended the sceptre and touched the Act immediately before the proclamation of \" La reine le veult,\" \" the king (or queen) wills it.\" This practice throws a light on the ancient use of the sceptre. ACTS OF THE APOSTLES, being a continuation of St Luke's Gospel, and supposed to have been written by that evangelist at Rome, before 64 or 65. ACTUARIES. The British Institute of, first established, 1848; in Scotland, 1856. ADAMITES, a sect that arose in 130, and met naked, in imitation of Adam before the fall ; Prodicus was their leader. This sect was introduced into Germany in 1416, revived in Poland in the I5th century. ADDINGTON ADMINISTRATION. On March 17, 1801, Mr Pitt having resigned, was succeeded by the Right Hon. Henry Addington, late Speaker of the Commons, as First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Terminated May 12, 1804, when Mr Pitt resumed those offices. Mr Addington made a Peer, under the title of Lord Sidmouth. ADDISCOMBE, MILITARY SEMINARY, near Croydon, Surrey, for cadets intended for the East India Company's Service established, 1809 ; extended to candidates for the Infantry, 1829 ; the presentation of pupils by patronage was abolished by 1 6 & 17 Vic. c. xcv., Aug. 20, 1853. ADELAIDE, South Australia. First founded by the early settlers in 1836; officially selected by the Government Surveyor, Colonel Light, 1837. The town extended to 1000 acres in 1843. Copper ore discovered, 1844. The Bishopric founded, 1847. ADELPHI (The), built by the brothers Adam, architects, 1768. ADELPHI THEATRE, built by John Scott, and opened Nov. 27, 1806, as the \" Sans Pareil ;\" first called Adelphi, 1825 ; present building constructed from the designs of T. H. Wyatt, opened Dec. 27, 1858. ADEN, Arabia. An extensive trade with the East was carried on here in the I3th and I4th centuries. The Portuguese obtained possession of the town and held it until they were expelled by the Turks, in 1538. In the following year the Turks retired, and the Arabians gained possession. The merchant ship Vesta was captured, and the crew ill treated by the natives, at Point Clara, Dec. 28, 1836 ; remonstrances being made in vain, the combined Naval and Military Force, under the command of Capt. H. Smith, arrived off the town, on Jan. 16, 1839, and captured it on the 1 9th. ADMINISTRATIONS OF ENGLAND since the Restoration. In the reign of Charles II. 7 changes, James II. 2, William and Mary 2, Anne 3, George I. 5, George II. 5, George III. 16, George IV. 4. The following are the names and the duration of the various Administrations since the passing of the Reform Act of 1832. The Ministry of the late Earl Grey held office from Nov. , 1 830, to Aug. , 1 834. It was instrumental in carrying the bill for the reform of the representative system. On the resignation of Earl Grey, in ADMINISTRATIONS ADMIRALTY COURT 7 Aug., 1834, the Whig Ministry was modified, and Viscount Melbourne was made First Lord of the Treasury. This Ministry was dissolved by William IV., in Nov., 1834, when Sir Robert Peel formed a new Government on moderate Con- servative principles. Sir Robert's tenure of office, however, was .brief, for, in the following April (1835), the right hon. baronet was defeated on the famous \" Ap- propriation Clause\" of the Irish Tithe Bill, andLord Melbourne once more resumed the reins of Government. This, the second Melbourne Ministry, endured from April, 1835, to Aug., 1841, or upwards of six years, exclusive of the week's intcrregmim in 1839, when Lord Melbourne temporarily resigned, and was reinstated on the refusal of Sir R. Peel to take office. In the summer of 1841 the Whigs were defeated in two Parliaments elected under their own auspices, and Sir R, Peel formed the Administration which carried the principle of Free Trade, and was eventually upset in 1846 by the secession of its \"Protectionist\" sup- porters. Lord John Russell's Administration, which succeeded, lasted from June, 1846, to Feb., 1852, when a defeat on the Militia Bill induced his Lordship to resign office. Then came the brief Administration of the Earl of Derby and the \" country party,\" which lasted about nine months. It was disolved just before Christmas, 1852, and the Earl of Aberdeen succeeded as the head of a Coalition Ministry, but on account of the inefficient way in which they had conducted the Crimean war, were defeated, Feb. I, 1855. On Feb. 7, 1855, Lord Palmerston was appointed First Lord of the Treasury (in other respects the chief departments of thelate administration remained undisturbed), but was defeated in 1858 ; followed by Lord Derby, who was in 1859 defeated by Lord Palmerston ; upon whose death Earl Russell once more formed a Cabinet, Nov., 1865 ; but being in a minority upon the Reform Bill, resigned, June 26, 1866, when Lord Derby formed the present Ministry. It will be seen that the second Ministry of Viscount Mel- bourne held office for upwards of six years, that of Sir Robert Peel (the second Ministry) nearly five years, and that of Lord John Russell nearly six years. During the period in question, viz. from 1834 to 1854, three appeals were made by exist- ing Ministries to the public opinion of the nation, by the usual course of a general election : thus, Sir Robert Peel dissolved Parliament in December, 1834, and the result was a considerable, but not adequate, accession of Parliamentary sup- port ; Lord Melbourne dissolved in 1841, but the country returned a majority of 100 against him ; and the Earl of Derby's appeal to the people, in 1852, was similarly unsuccessful. ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM SOCIETY, held their first meeting at the Lon- don Tavern and Guildhall, May 5, 1855. A branch meeting held at Norwich, May 16; at Gloucester, May 18; at Yarmouth, May 17 ; at Finsbury, London, May 22 ; at Birmingham, May 21 ; and their last at Drury Lane Theatre, June »3, I8SS. ADMIRAL. Before the term Admiral was used, there was an officer designated Gustos Marts, or Guardian of the Seas. The title of Admiral of the English Seas was first given to William de Leybourne, 1297, by Edward I. That of Lord High Admiral, 1387, by Richard II. The office was executed by commission from 1708 to 1827, when it was conferred on the Duke of Clarence, who resigned in 1828, when it returned to a commission. Admiral of the Fleet receives £$ per day. The Lord High Admiral of Scotland discontinued, 1703. Henry VIII. appointed James Butler Lord High Admiral of Ireland, 1534. The present Admiralty office dates its origin from 1512. ADMIRALTY COURT, instituted by Edward III. and usually held at Doctors' Commons. It consists of the Instance Court, which has a criminal and civil jurisdiction : those of piracy are tried at the Old Bailey : also of the Prize Court, a tribunal for naval captures in war. By 2 & 3 Will. IV. an appeal lies from this court to the king in council. Provision is made for the judge, 8 ADMIRAL ISLANDS VOILES registrar, and marshal of this Court by 3 & 4 Viet. c. 66, Aug. 7, 1840.

ADULTERY has been punished by most nations, though with different degrees of severity: among the Jews, with death ; by the Athenian law, the husband might kill the adulterer, if detected in the act. Homer speaks of adulterers being stoned to death ; but among the rich Greeks they were allowed to redeem themselves by a pecuniary fine. In Spain it is punished by castration. In England, Canute banished the man, and cut off the nose and ears of the woman. Alfred, however, modified the punishment, for he made the following humorous enactment : \"To handle the neck of a ceorl's wife, a fine of 5^ '•> to throw her down without further consequences, icw. ; but for a subsequent commission of the crime, 6oj.\" During the Commonwealth it was made capital felony ; but this law was repealed at the Restoration. At present, adultery comes under the cognizance of the temporal courts in England as a private injury to the husband. The present Divorce and Matrimonial Court was established 20 & 21 Viet. c. 85, Aug. 28, 1857. Sir Cresswell Cressweli appointed the first judge.

Discontinued in 1856. AEOLIAN HARP, invented by John James Schnell, musical instrument-maker to the Countess of Artois. The sounding of a harp, hung by accident, in a breezy passage, suggested the idea of that instrument, and in 1 789 he first exposed it for sale by the name Anemo C horde.

Sir Alexander Burnes and several British officers were massacred at Cabul, Nov. 2, 1841, by the Afghans, headed by the son of Dost Mahomed. Sir W. H. McNaughten murdered in December. The British army evacuated Cabul, and, under promise of protection, directed their march to Jellalabad, but out of an army of 4500 soldiers only one ever reached there alive (Dr Bryden), the whole being murdered on the way, Jan., 1842. An avenging army, under General Pollock and Sale, after forcing their way through the Khyber Pass, took Cabul, Sept. 16, 1842, the fort and fortification being destroyed. The British evacuated the town and the country, Oct., 1842. AFFINITY. The table of kindred and affinity at the end of the Common Prayer Book is founded on Leviticus xviii. , and several previous statutes, and was first published in 1563. By canon 99 this table is ordered to be set up in every church. By 5 & 6 Will. IV. c. 54 (1835), all marriages within prohibited degrees to be void. AFFIRMATION is a solemn asseveration instead of an oath, made by Quakers and Moravians. First granted by 7 & 8 Will. III. c. 34, 1696 ; explained and extended by 8 Geo. I. c. 6, 1721, and 22 Geo.

AFRICA was given to the posterity of Ham, the youngest son of Noah, and by them alone was this great division of our globe originally peopled. It was known to the Greeks and Romans by the name of Libya. The ancients divided the aboriginal tribes of Africa into two distinct classes, the Libyans and the Ethio- pians. In 600 B. C. Pharaoh Necho circumnavigated Africa, having sailed through the Straits of Babelmandel, returned in the third year through the Straits of Gibraltar. In 13008.0. Sesostris, king of Egypt, sent a great military expedition into the interior of Africa. In A.D. 616, Chosroes II., king of Persia, invaded it ; and in 960, Matz-ad-Din, fourth Fatimate Khalif, subdued the whole of it. Explored by Sieur-Brue, 1697-8; by M. Compagnon, 1714; by Park, 1795-6, ana again 1805; Hornemann, 1799; Capt. Tucker, 1816; Bowdich, 1817; Ritchie and Lyon, 1819 ; Major Denham and Lieut. Clapperton, 1822 ; Major Laing, 1826; Richard Lander, 1831-2. Mr Livingstone and Oswell reached the Lake Ngami 1849, and again in 1850 and in 1855 ; discovered the Falls on the Zambesi River, which he called Victoria ; he received the gold medal for his dis- 10 AFRICA AGNUS DEI coveries from the Geographical Society, Dec. 15, 1856, and the freedom of the city of London, May 21, 1857.

Burton visited the lakes in l857~8. Capt. Speke discovered the lake which he called Victoria Nyanza, 1858, and in 1862, the source of the Nile, 1863-4. Mr and Mrs Baker discovered the Murchison Falls and the Albert N'Yanza, March 14, 1864. Dr Livingstone again started for the Zambesi River, 1865 ; rumours of his death reached England, June 9, 1867. An expedition sent by the government in search of him, commanded by Mr Young, left Southampton, and on the I5th July arrived at the Cape. The British settlements are, Cape Colony, taken from the Dutch, 1806 ; the Mauritius, taken from the French, 1810 ; the islets of St Helena and Ascen- sion, Fernando Po, Sierra Leone, and Cape Coast. A project was set on foot for exploring and evangelizing Central Africa by means of native agents, in 1855. AFRICAN ASSOCIATION, formed in London, June 9, 1788, by Sir Joseph Banks, to explore the interior of Africa, and to promote its civilization. It sent out Ledyard, Lucas, Major Houghton, Mungo Park, and two Germans, Hornemann and Burckhardt. It merged into the Royal Geographical Society, July 23, 1831. AFRICAN COMPANY, a charter granted by Queen Elizabeth, 1588 ; to a second, 1618; a third, 1631 ; a fourth, 1662, by Charles II. ; and a fifth by letters patent, Sept. 27, 1672 ; remodelled, 1695 ; trade settled, 1698. It would appear that the Government of Charles II. owed this Company ^11,686,800, and their divided capital was .£10,780,000. By 23 Geo. II., 1750, the settlements and factories of the Royal African Company became invested in the present Com- pany. The trade thrown open in 1821. AFRICAN INSTITUTION, founded in 1807 for the civilization of Africa, which established schools at Sierra Leone. AGAPEMONE and AGAPEMONIANS, a modern sect, alleged to be founded on brotherly love, and a fancied communion with God. The disciples live in a species of community, and no harm appears to result from the indulgence of this new fancy in creed. One establishment, situated near Bridgewater, in Somerset, founded in 1845, was first brought before the public notice in consequence of Chancery proceedings against Brother Prince, in May, 1850; and in the case Nottidge v. Prince, July 25, 1860. AGE, THE MIDDLE. This portion of history has been divided into five great periods, denoted by the vast changes which took place in the course of that time : viz. — A.D. A.D.

Insurrection amongst the native troops, and the principal building destroyed, 1857. The troops disarmed on the 1st of June; the rebels defeated by Gen. Greathed, Oct. 10. AGRARIAN LAW. The first Agrarian law in Rome for a general and equal distribution of conquered lands, after the conquest of the Hernici by Spurius Cassius, 486 B.C. Renewed 123 B.C., but evaded by a repeal of the law pro- hibiting the transfer of lands already divided, and by stopping all further divisions. AGRICOLA, the Roman general, born A. D. 37. He commanded the army in England, and erected a rampart and chain of forts between the Clyde and Forth to keep out the northern barbarians, 8l ; circumnavigated Great Britain, 85 ; poisoned by Domitian, 86.

AHMEDABAD, Hindustan. The handsomest city in the world. It was founded in 1412, by Ahmed Shah ; subjugated by Akbar, 1572 ; governed by various chiefs until 1780, when it was stormed and captured by the British ; it was after- wards restored to the Mahrattas ; taken again by the English, 1818.

AGYNIANI, a sect about 694, who condemned all use of flesh and marriage. Their tenets coincide with those of Abelians and Gnostics. AIR. The ancients thought that air constituted one of the four elements from which all things originate ; and this doctrine continued prevalent till 1774, when Dr Priestley discovered oxygen gas, and showed it to be a constituent of air. Scheele about the same time found that it consisted of two distinct elastic fluids, oxygen and azote. In 1646, Torricelli produced the first vacuum ; but Otto Von Guericke made the first air-pump, 1654, which has since been im- proved by Boyle, Hawksbee, and in 1830 by Perkins. Leopold, a German, first applied the air-chamber to fire-engines, 1 720. AIRE, France, captured by the Spaniards in 1641 ; and ceded by the treaty of Utrecht, March 31, 1713.

Charlemagne, in 12 AJZNADIN ALBANS 768, built a Palace and founded the Cathedral ; ravaged by the Normans, 882. It is celebrated for concluding the following treaties : that of 1668 (O.S. May 2), between France and Spain, which terminated the war respecting the possession of the Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium), by which France gained Lille, Armen- tieres, &c. The second was that of Oct. 18, 1748, between England, France, Holland, Austria, Spain, Sardinia, and Modena, and terminated the war respect- ing the succession of Maria Theresa to the empire. The Congress of 1818 regu- lated the affairs of Europe, after the restoration of the Bourbons in France : as- sembled, Sept. 29; separated, Nov. 21. AJZNADIN, battle.

ALABAMA, Confederate steam sloop of war, commanded by Captain Semmes, left Liverpool, July 29, 1862, and for two years was the terror and destroyer of the Federal Merchant Service, of which she captured over 60. She engaged the United States ship of warKearsage, at Cherbourg, June 19, 1864, when, after a brave defence, she sunk. The loss in killed, wounded, and drowned was 47 ; the captain and part of the crew were bravely rescued by Mr Lancaster, in his yacht, the Deerhound, and landed at Southampton the following day. ALAND ISLES. Aland means country of rivers, and these islands became memorable in the late war, and are very important, in a political and military point of view, to Russia. They consist of seven islands, which lie across the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, at the extremity of the Baltic, and close to the Gulf of Finland. In the I4th century this group of islands is mentioned as an earldom belonging to Sweden. In 1742 and 1808, the Russians took possession of these islands, but in the latter year the Alanders surprised the Russian com- mander, Major Neidhart, and took him prisoner. In 1809 they were retaken by Russia, and since then remained in its possession. The allied army landed on them, August 8, 1854, and destroyed the fortifications. Restored to Russia by treaty, April 27, 1856, but not to be re-fortified. ALANS, or ALANI, a people like the Huns, who overran the whole of Europe in A.D. 130. They established themselves upon the banks of the Danube in 406 ; they crossed the Rhine and settled in Spain, 411; war was their chief occupation. ALBA - LONGA, a powerful wealthy state, which became in after-times the mother city of Rome, and supposed to have been founded by Ascanius, 400 years before the foundation of Rome itself. It was destroyed, and its in- habitants brought to Rome, 642 B.C. ALBANIA, Turkey. This place was known to Ptolemy. Included in the great Bulgarian kingdom in the loth century. The Turks defeated them in 1388, and again in 1478. Ali Pasha made this state almost independent ; he defeated the Pashas of Berat and Delvino in 1811-12; subdued by the Turks, 1822; insurrection in 1843; the inhabitants revolted against the Turks, Jan. 10, 1854. ALBANS (ST), the ancient Verulam, and the site of the martyrdom of St Alban. ALBANS ALBION 13 A synod held here by Germanus, 429. In 1250 a great earthquake was felt in this town. In 1553 it obtained a charter of incorporation from Edward VI. ; but was disfranchised for bribery, by 15 Viet. c. 9, May 23, 1851. ALBAXS (ST) ABBEY, founded by Offa, king of Mercia, 793; and as an entire structure, is the most ancient in England. As the saint of this church was the first martyr in England, its abbot had a superiority over all others. Its revenues at the dissolution were estimated at ^2100 ; but the townsmen preserved the abbey from ruin by a purchase of ^400. The site of the abbot's dwelling and of the domiciles of the monks is now occupied by the Abbey Grammar School, en- dowed by Edward VI., 1549- In 1257 was dug up this old inscription : — 'In this mausoleum was found the venerable corpse of St Alban, the protomartyr of Britain ; ' it was in lead, and supposed to have been laid in King Offa's time. 'The Golden Book of St Albans,' in the British Museum (Cotton. MS., Nero, D. Vll.), is a conventual album, in which are entered the portraits of all the benefactors of the abbey, with an abstract of their donations. 'The Book of St Albans ' is another literary curiosity, and was so called because printed in that monastery, soon after the introduction of printing into England, 1486. It is at- tributed to Dame Julian Barnes, prioress of Sopewall Convent, in Hertfordshire. ALBANS, ST, battles. The first battle between the houses of York and Lan- caster fought May 23, 1455, in which the Yorkists were successful ; the Duke of Somerset being slain and Henry VI. wounded and taken prisoner. The second battle was fought on Shrove Tuesday, Feb. 17, 1461, when the Yorkists were de- feated by the Lancastrians under Queen Margaret, and Henry VI. was rescued. ALBERT MEDAL for saving life from shipwreck, instituted by Her Majesty, March 7, 1866. ALBERT, PRINCE. Francis-Albert-Augustus-Charles-Emanuel, Duke of Sax- ony, Prince of Coburg and Gotha, was the second son of Ernest-Frederick- Anthony-Charles-Louis, late reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Prince Albert was born Aug. 26, 1819, and married to Queen Victoria at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, Feb. IO, 1840. H.R.H. was naturalized 3 & 4 Viet, c. I & 2, and by c. 3, received an annuity of .£30,000. Made Prince Consort, June 25, 1857 ; died at Windsor, aged 43, Dec. 14, 1861 ; buried in St George's Chapel, Dec. 23.

(On the site of the Great Exhibition of 185 1. ) A meeting of merchants and citizens was called by Cubitt, Lord Mayor of London, at the Mansion House, when it was determined to erect a memorial to commemorate the services Prince Albert had rendered to this country, Jan. 14, 1862. The sum of ,£12,000 was subscribed at the first meeting, and a committee appointed to carry out the same. The erection begun in 1864. ALBIGENSES, a name formerly given indiscriminately to all the Cathari, or pure ; but in a more extended sense applied in the I2th century to a sect in the south of France charged with holding Manicheism. In 1209 Pope Innocent III. pro- claimed a crusade against them, and against Raymond VI., Count of Toulouse, who supported them. The war began in 1209, and lasted many years. Raymond VI. died in 1222 ; but the war was resumed by his son, whose successes so alarmed Honorius III. that the pontiff induced Louis VIII. to take the field ; and Ray- mond VII., pressed on all sides, made peace with the king, April, 1229. This was a mortal blow to the Albigenses. ALBION, the name by which Great Britain was known to the Greeks and Romans. The earliest notice of the word occurs in a work attributed to Aristotle, De Mundo, sec. 3, who wrote, B.C. 340, 'beyond the Pillars of Hercules is the I4 ALBION ALCHEMY ocean which flows round the earth. In it are two very large islands, called Britannic ; these are Albion and lerne.' Csesar's name for England is Britannia : he does not use the word Albion. Pliny says (lib. iv. c. 16), 'the name of the island was Albion ; the whole set of islands being called Britannic. ' ALBION, NEW, a name given by Sir Francis Drake to the province of California and part of the north-west coast of America, which he visited June, 1 5 79. Explored by Vancouver, in April, 1792. Cook stopped here during his third voyage, 1778. ALBUERA, Spain, a village situated on the main road from Seville to Badajoz, and the scene of a severe conflict on May 16, 1811. Marshal Soult, advancing to the relief of Badajoz, besieged by the British troops, made a vigorous attack on the allied army of British, Portuguese, and Spanish, under Marshal Beresford ; but after a severe contest he was repulsed with great slaughter. Soult retreated to- wards Seville. ALBUFERA, battle. The French under Marshal Suchet, afterwards Duke of Albufera, and the Spaniards, who were defeated Jan. 4, 1812. ALBUM. The earliest notice of this friendly memorial book is to be traced to the registers of the deceased formerly kept in every church and monastery, called the album, i.e. the blank book, in which the names of the benefactors to the church or monastery were recorded, that they might be prayed for at their decease, and on their anniversaries. The earliest writer who uses the word is the Venerable Bede, who in his preface to his prose life of St Cuthbert, 721, reminds Bishop Eadfrith that his name was registered in the album at Lindisfarne, ' in albo vestrse sanctte congregationis.' (Bedce Opera Minora, p. 47, ed. Stevenson.) Elsewhere Bede calls this book 'theannal' (Hist. Eccles.,\\\\b. iv. c. 14). At a later period it was called, both in England and abroad, the Liber Vita, or Book of Life, a name borrowed from St Paul (Philippians iv. 3). A beautiful specimen of an English album may be seen in the British Museum, Cotton. MS. D. vil. : it is the Album, or Book of Life, of the monastery of Durham. Izaak Walton tells us that Sir Henry Wotton, when ambassador at Venice, wrote in the album of Christopher Flecamore, a Latin sentence to the effect that ' an ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his country.' ALCANTARA, Spain, founded in 1156 ; taken from the Moors by Alphonso IX., king of Castile, 1214 ; given to the knights of Calatrava ; captured by the Portu- guese, April, 1 706. The French burnt the bridge over the Tagus, built by Trajan, 1836. The town taken by the English, April 25, 1706. ALCANTARA, Order of, a company of knights founded to protect Spain against the Moors, 1 156-7, raised by Pope Alexander III. to a knightly order, 1 1 77 ; confirmed by Pope Lucius, 1183; the grand mastership vested in the Crown, 1495; the knights obtained the privilege of marriage, 154°- ALCHEMY, the pretended art of making gold and silver by means of the philoso- pher's stone. It is sometimes called the Hermetic philosophy, from Hermes Trismegistus, one of the earliest alchemists. The first writer who speaks of making gold is Zosimus, the panapolite, A.D. 412, who has left a treatise in MS. of the divine art of making gold and silver. Among the early celebrated alchemists were Albert Groot, called Albertus Magnus, a German, born in 1282 ; Raymond Lully, 1315 ; Roger Bacon, 1285 ; Arnoldus de Villa Nova, 1313. Edward III. personally interested himself [1329] in the experiments of Rouse and Dalby, two professors of the philosopher's stone. Henry IV. made the multipli- cation of metals felony ; yet Henry VI. not only encouraged John Cobb, by licence, to transubstantiate metals into gold, but granted commissions [1444] for the promotion of an art that promised to replenish the royal coffers, in which he was followed by Edward IV., 1476. Queen Elizabeth was not a whit behind her ALCOCK ALE 15 predecessors in credulity, by patronizing Dr Dee. In later times, Peter Woulfe, who died 1805, is said to have been a believer in alchemy ; and Dr Price, of Guildford, professed to convert mercury into gold and silver. At the present time, some of the disciples of Jacob Bb'hme are still searching for the substance capable of transmuting the baser metals ; although the majority are more content to seek their wealth by the humbler means of commerce and industry. ALCOCK, Mr, and Mr Colclough, fought a duel ; the latter killed, and the former lost his reason, June 21, 1807. ALCORAN, the divine book, as pretended, of the Mahometans, and the standard of the Arabic language. It was composed by Mahomet about the year 610 : the prophet was said to have had assistants in the labour. ALDERMAN, from the Saxon eolderman, a general term for any civil dignity. The alderman of the hundred was elected by the people, and was inferior to the king's alderman, who presided in the County Court. There were also aldermen of guilds, hospitals, &c. Ralph Brooke, York Herald, states that King John first ordained the aldermen of London ; and Fabyan thus notices their first appoint- ment as justices : 'This year [1242] were aldermen first chosen, which then had the rule of the city and the wards, and were then yearly changed, as now the sheriffs be changed.' But by 17 Richard II., 1394, each of the 26 wards elects one alderman for life, or during good behaviour. In some cases the wards were the aldermen's heritable property, such as Farringdon, bought by Nicholas de Farndone, 1279. ALDERNEY, an island in the English Channel, and celebrated for a dangerous strait, called the 'Race of Alderney.' Here, Nov. 26, 1120, was wrecked the 'Blanche Nef,' the finest vessel in the Norman navy, having on board Prince William, eldest son of Henry I. , and his young bride ; and of the 300 persons who embarked in 'the white ship,' but one escaped to tell the dismal tale. In 1692 the remnant of the French fleet escaped through the 'Race of Alderney' after the defeat of Tourville by the combined navies under Admiral Russell ; and in July, 1774, the 'Victory,' of no guns, was lost here, with noo men. ALDERSGATE, one of the four gates in the city wall. The old gate was improved by Daye the printer, in the reign of Elizabeth, but was taken down in 1616, and rebuilt 1617. It stood near to the church of St Botolph, and was destroyed in 1761. ALDERSHOTT, Famham. A camp formed here, 1854. The troops reviewed by the Queen after the Crimean War, July 7, 1856. ALDGATE, or Old Gate, another of the London gates, first noticed in the reign of Edgar, 963. In 1606 it was taken down, and rebuilt by Martin Bond. After this gate was taken down in 1 760, Sir Walter Blackett, of Wallington, North- umberland, obtained some of the ornamental stones (part of the city arms, heads and wings of dragons, apparently cut in Portland stone, and probably set up when the gate was rebuilt, 1606), and used them in decorating Rothley Castle. ALE. Herodotus (B.C. 440) tells us that the Egyptians used a liquor made of barley, and attributes the first discovery of the art of brewing it to Isis, the wife of Osiris. Ale was also the favourite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, so much so, that St Dunstan introduced an ingenious custom of pegging their cups at certain distances ; hence the origin of peg-tankards, or drinking to pegs. In 1266, 51 Henry III., a graduated scale was established for the price of ale ; but in 1531, 23 Henry VIII. c. 4, the members of the Cooper's Company were ap- pointed to gauge and mark all ale barrels and to fix its price. In the city of London ale-conners were appointed in the reign of Henry I. ; Chaucer described them in 1348. The old ale-gallon abolished by 5 Geo. IV. c. 74, June 17, 1824 ; an alteration made in the duties by i Will. IV. c. 51, July 16, 1830. 16 ALE ALEXANDRA THEATRE ALE. Festive meetings of the country were formerly called ales ; as leet-ale, lamb-ale, Whitsun-ale, clerk-ale, bride-ale, church-ale, Scot-ale, Midsummer-ale, &c/ At all these feasts ale was the predominant liquor. ALE HOUSES. These houses are mentioned in the laws of Ina, A.D. 728, and have been under legislative regulations for the last 400 years. In 1490 no one was permitted to brew ale as long as any church ale remained unsold ; and, in 1494, II Henry VII., an act was passed to stop the common selling of ale. In 1589 all persons selling ale had both to hang out a sign (an ale stake), and to get a license. In 1590 they had to enter into a bond for .£10, and give surety for ^\"5, to keep order in their houses. It was further restrained in 1604, by 2 James I. c. 9 ; 4 James I. c. 4, 5 ; I Car. I. c. 4 ; 26 Geo. II. c. 31, 1753 ; 48 Geo. III. c. 143, July 2, 1808 ; and the hours fixed for selling it on Sundays, by 18 & 19 Viet. c. 118, Aug. 14, 1855. ALEMANNI, a people of Germany, descended from the Suevi, who inhabited the country between the Neckar and the upper Rhine. This name, Alemanni, or Ale-mant signifies a multitude of men, indicating the various tribes of which they were composed. They are first mentioned in the reign of Caracalla, A. D. 214, who was named Alemannicus, from a victory obtained over them. Gallienus at the head of only 10,000 Romans vanquished 300,000 of this warlike people near Milan ; after which he formed an alliance with the Alemanni. In after-times they made frequent inroads upon Gaul and Italy, and at last finally submitted to the Franks, and with them consolidated into a dukedom, called the Duchy of Alemannia. ALEPPO, more correctly Haleb, the capital of a pashalik of Asiatic Turkey, and one of the five pashaliks of Syria. The Arabian writers trace the origin of this city to the migration of Abraham into Canaan, who rested on the hill where the castle of Aleppo now stands. In 638 it was conquered by the Arabs ; in 1260 plundered by the Moguls, and again in 1401 by Timur. It was conquered by Selim I. and became subject to the sultans of Constantinople, Aug. 24, 1516. Almost destroyed by an earthquake, Aug., 1822. On Oct. 14, 1850, the Mahometans destroyed three Christian churches ; but the rebels received a severe chastisement on Nov. 7, when Kerim Pasha, at the head of 4000 imperial troops, charged 10,000 of them : the combat was desperate, and lasted 24 hours, the loss to the rebels was 1800. Massacre of the Christians at, Oct. 16, 1850. ALERT, Dublin Packet, lost with all on board, March 26, 1803. ALESSANDRIA, a town and fortress in Piedmont, built, 1168 ; in 1174 besieged by Frederic Barbarossa. Captured by the French under Bonaparte, 1 796. On July 21, 1799, General Suwarroff defeated the French under General Moreau near to this town ; ceded to the French, June, 1800 ; fortified by them, 1803-5 > surrendered by the treaty of Paris, May 30, 1814 ; taken by the Austrians, April 19, 1821. ALEUTIAN ISLANDS in the North Pacific; discovered by Behring, 1728; surveyed by two Russian officers, 1 768 ; fortifications built by Russian adven- turers, 1 785. Capt. Cook in his third voyage visited them. ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS. Treaty between Her Majesty and the King of Denmark for the marriage of, to the Prince of Wales, Jan. 15, 1863.

Gio- vannelli, and opened May 20, 1865. ALEXANDRIA ALGERIA 17 ALEXANDRIA, ANCIENT, owes its origin to Alexander the Great, B.C. 332 ; besieged by Antiochus IV., B.C. 169 ; sustained some damage in Caesar's cam- paigns, B. c. 48 ; captured by Amru, A. u. 640. Before the discovery of the passage round Africa by the Cape of Good Hope, Alexandria was the great mart for all the merchandise between Europe and the East Indies, which was trans- ported from thence to Suez, and so to India. — The modern Alexandria stands on an artificial neck of land, which joins the peninsula of Pharos. Taken by Bona- parte, July 4, 1 798, who killed about 300 Arabs and Mamalukes. On March 21, 1801, the British army was attacked here by General Menou, but repulsed with great slaughter; near 4000 French were killed and wounded. General Abercrombie received a mortal wound, and was succeeded by General Hutchin- son. Taken by the English from the French, when an immense quantity of arms and stores was captured, Sept. 2, 1801. Alexandria surrendered again to the British troops, commanded by Major Fraser, March 21, 1807. Some singular objects of stone found in excavations at Alexandria were submitted to the Archaeological Institute, Nov. 7, 1851. Visited by the Sultan, April 7, 1863. ALEXANDRIAN CODEX. A MS. of the Old and New Testament in Greek, preserved in the British Museum. It was sent by Cyrellus Lucaris, patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles L, 1628, who placed it in the Royal library. ALEXANDRIAN ERA. This fixed the creation of the world B.C. 5502 ; so that the year of our Lord I corresponded with the Alexandrian year of the creation 5503. This computation was continued until A.D. 284, or of the Alexandrian era 5786; but in A.D. 285, or A. Alex. 5787, ten years were subtracted, and that year was called 5777. To reduce the Alex, to the Christian era, 5502 must be subtracted from the Alex, era until A. Alex. 5786, and after that year by sub- tracting 5429- To ascertain the year of the Alexandrian era of any year of our Lord after A. D. 285, 5492 must be added to the year of Christ, and if before A.D. 285, 5502 must be added. — Sir H. Nicolas. ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY, formed by the first Ptolemy, king of Egypt, B.C. 284. In the siege of Caesar, B.C. 48, the library, which was at Bruchion, was burnt by a fire which spread from the shipping to the town, and 400,000 volumes perished. The library was subsequently re-established, and this place continued one of the chief seats of literature till conquered by the Arabs, under Omar I., A. D. Dec. 22, 640, which dispersed, if not destroyed, its literary treasures. ALFORD, battle. The Marquess of Montrose defeated the Covenanters, July 2, 1645. ALFRED THE GREAT, born, 849; ascended the throne, 872; defeated 300 Danish pirates, with ten galleys, on the coast of Dorset, 897 ; died, Oct. 28, 904. ALFRED CLUB, established 1808, was held at 23, Albemarle Street. It pos- sessed in its day many celebrated members, such as Byron, Peel, and Ward Lord Dudley. In 1854 it coalesced with the Oriental Club. ALGEBRA. The earliest work on algebra is that of Diophantus, an Alexandrine Greek, who lived about the middle of the 2nd century. The Persians and Arabs derived their knowledge of it from the Hindoos ; introduced into Italy by Leo- nardo Bonacci, of Pisa, about 1203. In the middle of the i6th century it was made known in France, England, and Germany, by Paletarius, Robert Recorde, and Stefelius. Vieta, a Frenchman, who died 1603, first used symbols for quantities; and in England, Harriot, who died 1621, extended his discoveries, and compiled a complete theory of equations. Newton invented the method of series and fluxions, 1665; indefinite division and quotients, by Mercator, 1 666. ALGERIA, Africa, taken by the French, June 14, 1830 ; treaty concluded, ceding the town to the French, July 4 ; insurrection under Abd-el-Kader, 1833 ; 2 1 8 ALGESIRAS ALIENS upwards of 500 Arabs, with their wives and children, suffocated in a cavern by the French troops under Pelissier, June 20, 1845 ; Abd-el-Kader surrendered himself to the French, Dec. 22, 1847 ; the town of Lahou taken, Dec. 4, 1852 ; the emperor and empress visited the colony, 1860; insurrection in 1864; second visit of the Emperor Napoleon in May, 1865. ALGESIRAS, Spain, or OLD GIBRALTAR, a maritime city of Spain. By this city the Moors entered Spain in 7X3 5 from whom it was not recovered till 1344, after a long siege, memorable for the first use of cannon. On July 6, 1801, Sir James Saumarez, with six sail of the line, attacked three French line of battle ships and a frigate ; and on the I3th of the same month, Sir James, with a British squadron, attacked the French and Spanish fleets on their return to Cadiz ; two Spanish ships of 112 guns each were burnt, and the St Antonio, 74 guns, struck her colours. ALGIERS, Africa. This territory includes the divisions of the ancient Numidia, and was conquered successively by the Romans, Vandals, Byzantine Greeks, and by the Arabs in the 8th century. The city of Algiers was built about 935, by an Arabian chief, Jussuf Zeri. In the nth century was founded the empire of the Morabites. In 1516, Aroodje-Barbarossa was proclaimed sultan of Algiers, and in 1533 it finally submitted to the Turks. In 1541 Charles V. was baffled in his ill-fated armament against it. In April, 1654, Admiral Blake taught the Al- gerines to respect the English flag. In 1682-3 it was bombarded by Du Quesne ; and again in 1688 by d'Istrees. In 1774 Charles III. made an unsuccessful attack, as did France in 1783-4. Lord Exmouth bombarded it, and abolished slavery, Aug. 27, 1816. On the 4th of July, 1830, it surrendered to a French army of 30,000, under Bourmont. On May 20, 1834, the French government, having determined to retain Algiers, was, after some opposition, sanctioned by the Chamber of Deputies. On Nov. 22, 1836, the French arms, under General Clausel, sustained a serious defeat here, by the loss of 55°° mer>- On Oct. 13, 1837, General Damremont successfully assaulted it, but was killed by a cannon- ball. The celebrated prince Abd-el-Kader surrendered to the Duke d'Aumale, Dec. 22, 1847 ; he left Amboise for Brusa, in Asia Minor, Dec. n, 1852. On July 5, 1854, was concluded the French campaign against the Kabyles, after the severe engagements of the previous month. On Nov. 20, 1854, an engagement took place at Meggarin between Com. Marmier and the unsubdued Arabs ; and on Dec. 2 the Arabs abandoned Tuggart, and was taken by the French. ALT, sect of Mahometans, so called from this chief, the son-in-law of Mahomet, 642. He was assassinated in 660. ALIEN PRIORIES, seized by the crown in 1414. ALIENS. An alien is a person bora out of the jurisdiction of a country. In France a residence of ten years gives to the alien all the rights of a citizen. In the United States an alien must have resided five years, and two years before he is naturalized he must abjure all allegiance to other powers. In England the Alien Act, 33 Geo. III. c. 4, 1793, arose from the influx of strangers at the French revolution. In 1827, May 26, 7 Geo. IV. c. 54, an act was passed for their registration; but this was repealed by 6 & 7 Will. IV. c. n, May 19, 1836, when new provisions were introduced. Persons born abroad of a mother being a natural-born subject, may hold real or personal property, certificate of Natural- ization to be obtained from a Secretary of State, 7 & 8 Viet. c. 66, Aug. 6, 1844 ; legalizing act of colonial legislature, 10 & II Viet. c. 83, July 22, 1847. A denizen is in a kind of middle state between an alien and a natural-born subject, and must obtain letters patent to make him an English subject. Naturalization can only be obtained by Act of Parliament. ALIWAL ALMANACS 19 ALIWAL, battle, between the Sikhs and English, Jan. 28, 1846. The loss of the Sikhs was estimated at 6000 killed, wounded, and drowned in the Sutlej. ALLEGIANCE. There are several statutes requiring the oath of allegiance and supremacy, I Eliz. c. I, 1558; I Will, and Mary, c. I, 8, 1689; and I Anne, stat. I, c. 22, 1701 ; substituting one oath for the oath of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, 21 & 22 Viet c. 48, July 23, 1858 ; power to modify the oath to enable Jews to sit in Parliament, 21 & 22 Viet. c. 49, July 23, 1858 ; amended by 23 & 24 Viet. c. 63, Aug. 6, 1860 ; form of affirmation in lieu of oath, 22 Viet. c. 10, April 8, 1859.

ALL SAINTS, or ALL HALLOWS, instituted 607. In 835, Gregory IV. altered this feast from May I to Nov. I, as at present. In Great Britain there are 33 churches dedicated to All Saints, and 13 to All Hallows. ALL SOULS, a festival observed in the Roman Church, Nov. 2 ; introduced into England, 816 ; the Council of Oxford declared it a holy day, 1222 ; abolished by the English Church at the Reformation. All Souls', Marylebone, is the only church in England with this dedication. ALL SOULS' COLLEGE, Oxford, founded by Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1437.

ALMACKS' ASSEMBLY ROOMS, King Street, St James's, built from the designs of Mr Mylne, and opened Feb. 12, 1765. ALMANACS. The earliest are those called Clog Almanacs, or Runic calendars, in use during Canute's reign. It was a square piece of wood, containing three months on each of the four edges. The days are expressed by notches, and every seventh day by a larger notch. On the left hand are symbols for the golden number, or cycle of the moon. The festivals are marked by symbols of the saints. There are many splendid MS. almanacs of the I4th century in the British Museum : among others, the Calendar of John Somers, 1380 ; another in Cottonian MS. 1450. In Lambeth library is an English calendar, 1460. At Oxford is one by Peter de Dacia, 1300. The earliest printed almanac in England is the ' Sheapeheard's Kalendar,' by Pynson, 1497; then followed Mayster John Thy- 20 ALMANZA ALPHABET bault's, 1533; Nostrodamus's, 1566; Mounslowe's, i$79; Lilly's Ephemeris, 1644; Poor Robin's, 1652; Lady's Diary, 1705; Moore's, 1713; Gentleman's Diary, 1741 ; Partridge's, 1705 ; the Nautical, edited for 48 years by Dr Maske- lyne, first appeared 1767. The first printed in Ireland, 1587; in Scotland, 1677.

ALMERIA, Spain, taken from the Moors by the Emperor of Spain, Don Alonso, Oct. 1 6, 1147. The cathedral built, 1524. ALMONDS came from the East, and were introduced into England, 1570. ALMONER, in its primitive sense, denoted an officer in religious houses, who dis- tributed the alms. By an ancient canon all bishops are required to keep an almoner. The almoner of France (la grand aiimonier} was the highest ecclesi- astical dignity there before the revolution. In 1804 Napoleon restored the office, which was continued till the time of Charles X. The Lord High Almoner of England was instituted as early, if not before, the time of Edward I., and was long held by the Archbishop of York ; at present the Bishop of Oxford holds it, and has under him a sub-almoner, a yeoman, and two grooms. ALMORA, Hindustan. Taken by the Ghorkhas, 1790; captured by the British under Colonel Nicolls, April 25, 1815. ALMORAVIDES, a family of Mahometan princes. They reigned in Spain and Africa.

In 1017, the following year, Edmund being murdered at Oxford, Canute became lord of the whole kingdom. ALNWICK, a town in Northumberland, celebrated for its stately castle, the seat of the Percies. It was a strong fortress in the time of the Saxons. Malcolm III. besieged it in 1093, and was killed. In 1135, captured by David I. In 1174 William the Lion again besieged it, and was taken prisoner. The present castle was erected between 1140 and 1180. It was sold to Henry de Percy, 1310. In 1411, Alnwick was a walled town, and a gateway called Bondgate was built. Alnwick was an abbey of Premonstratensian canons, the revenue at the dissolution was ALPHABET. According to Astle, the Phoenicians have the best claim to the in- vention of an alphabet, and from them descended the Pelasgian, whence the Greek, ALPINE CLUB AMARYLLIS 21 Etruscan, Latin, &c. The Hebrew, Samaritan, and Syriac alphabets have 22 letters ; English, 26 ; Arabic, 28 ; Persian and Egyptian or Coptic, 32 ; the present Russian, 41 j Sanscrit, 50 ; the Cashmirian and Malabaric are still more numer- ous. ALPINE CLUB, formed in London for the encouragement of information of the various Alps, 1858 ; first work upon the Glaciers published by members of the club, and edited by the president, 1859. ALPS. The Carthaginian forces under Hannibal crossed, B.C. 218 ; the French army under Napoleon I., May 20, 1800. ALSATIA, a name given to the precinct of Whitefriars, near the Temple, London : it was called Alsatia the higher, to distinguish it from the Mint in Southwark, which was called Alsatia the lower. Both these places obtained certain privileges, particularly arrest from civil process, and in consequence became the resort of the profligate and abandoned of both sexes. By an act, 8 & 9 Will. III. c. 27, 1697, these and several other privileged places were put down. Shadwell has dramatized the manners and language of the Alsatians, in a satirical comedy called The Squire of Alsatia, acted in 1688. ALSEN, Denmark. The Prussians attacked the fortifications, which were defended by the Danes, June 26, 1864 ; who surrendered on the 2gth. ALTAR. The eucharist in the early Church was commonly celebrated on tables of wood. Stone altars probably began to be erected about the time of Constantine. The council of Epone, A. D. 51 7, ordained that none but stone altars should be consecrated (Can. 26). Even the wooden table was however generally called an altar, and the word Table, according to Wheatly, was introduced into our rubrics in consequence of an order from Edward VI. in council. After the third century both names (altar and table) came to be promiscuously used ; the one having re- spect to the oblation of the eucharist, the other to the participation. The Fathers seldom call it Table without some distinctive epithet, as ' The Lord's Table,' the ' Mystical,' ' Holy,' &c. ALTORF UNIVERSITY, founded 1581. ALT-RANSTADT, peace of, between Charles XII. of Sweden and the king of Poland, signed Sept. 24, 1706. Another between Louis XIV. and Charles VI. was signed here, March 17, I7I4- ALUM is noticed by Pliny, xxxv. 15 ; the best was obtained from Egypt and the island of Melos. In the middle ages it was manufactured in Roccha, whence comes the name Rock alum, and also at La Tolfa. Sir Thomas Chaloner, the younger, in 1595, discovered atWhitby, in Yorkshire, the first alum mines known in England. In 1625 Charles I. prohibited the importation of it. At Hurlett, near Paisley, and Campsie, near Glasgow, are alum mines. In 1828 Mr Strachan took out a patent for improving it. ALUMBAGH, Lucknow, captured by the British army under Generals Havelock and Outram, Sept. 23, 1857 ; twice attacked by the Sepoys in revolts, but each time defeated them, Jan. 12 and Feb. 21, 1858. ALUMINIUM. This metal was discovered by Sir H. Davy in 1808 ; Oersted endeavoured to get the metal in a detached form a few years afterwards ; M. Wohler discovered it in clay, 1828-1846. The first bar of this metal was made by M. St Clair Deville in France, in the Emperor's laboratory, and presented by Napoleon to Mr Pepper, 1855.

AMAZON, Mail Steamship, burnt in the Bay of Biscay ; upwards of IOO passengers were lost, Jan. 4, 1852. AMBASSADORS, amongst the Romans, were sent to foreign nations, and received by them (Livy vi. 1 7). In England in the time of the Tudors, it became the custom to have resident ambassadors, or liegers, as they were named, at the differ- ent courts, in order to obtain correct information of the state of affairs in them. Baron de Forquevaux de Pavie was sent to Spain as ambassador to the court of Philip II. by Charles IX. of France, 1565. In later times they are distinguished as ordinary or extraordinary : an ordinary is one who constantly resides at a foreign court ; an extraordinary is sent on a special occasion. By 7 Anne, c. 12, 1708, an ambassador cannot be arrested, nor his goods distrained. There are four classes in England : I. Ambassadors ; 2. Envoys, or Ministers Plenipotentiary ; 3. Resident Ministers ; 4. Charges d'affaires, whose salaries are regulated by 2 & 3 Will. IV. c. 1 1 6, Aug. 1 6, 1832. Power given to administer oaths, 18 & 19 Viet. c. 42, July 2, 1855. AMBER. The origin of amber has baffled poets and chemists from the days of ancient Greece to the present. Its property, when rubbed, to attract light sub- stances was first observed by Thales, B.C. 660, who attributed a certain life to it. By some it is held to be a vegetable resin or gum ; others consider it a mineral oil. It is mostly found in the southern coasts of the Baltic Sea, where it is thrown up between Konigsberg and Memel. It is now used for ornamental pur- poses, such as necklaces, snuff-boxes, &c. AMBERLEY CASTLE, Sussex, built 1374. AMBERSBURY NUNNERY, founded 976. AMBOYNA, one of the Molucca or Spice Islands, first visited by the Portuguese, 1511, and claimed by them, 1521. Early in the 1 7th century it was taken by the Dutch. In 1604 the ships of the East India Company traded here ; and in 1612 they formed a settlement at Cambello, but were expelled in June, 1614. In Feb., 1623, was the memorable massacre of the English by the Dutch, on an accusation of a conspiracy to expel them from the island, where the two nations resided in pursuance of the treaty of 1619. In 1796 it was captured by the British under Adm. Rainier; but was restored, 1801 ; taken again by the British, Feb. 17, 1810, and again given up to Holland in 1814. AMBROSIAN LIBRARY at Milan, founded by Card. Borromeo, 1602 ; opened, 1609. It contains 40,000 printed volumes, and 15,000 MSS. AMERICA, named from Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine gentleman ; first dis- covered by Columbus, who landed at San Salvador, Oct. 12, 1492, where he left a few men as the ground-work of a colony. In 1497 the two Cabots explored the North American coast ; and in 1498 Sebastian Cabot visited Newfoundland. South America was not discovered by Columbus until May 30, 1498. In 1500, Caspar Cortereal, a Portuguese, touched at Labrador. In 1501, Bastidas, a Spaniard, visited Cape de Vela to the Gulf of Darien. Yucatan discovered by Diaz de Solis and Penzon, 1508 ; and Florida by Ponce de Leon, 1512. The Pacific, or Southern Ocean, discovered by Balboa, 1513. See California.

The first line was constructed between Washington and Baltimore, 1844. AMETHYST, a gem of a violet colour, the ninth in order upon the high-priest's breast-plate, Ex. xxviii. 19 ; xxxix. 12. Pliny says it resists drunkenness, which Plutarch rejects. It is found in the East and West Indies, and in several parts of Europe. De Boot (Hist. Gemmarum) mentions an amethyst, rendered colour- less, estimated at 200 rix-dollars, which being cut to the same pattern as a diamond of the value of 18,000 gold crowns, so equalled it in lustre, that he could not tell the difference. They are frequently counterfeited by spars and crystals tinged red and yellow. Discovered at Kerry in Ireland, 1755. AMICABLE SOCIETY, Sergeants' Inn, incorporated by Queen Anne, 1706. AMIENS, France. A congress held here, when Louis annulled the provisions of Oxford against the barons, 1264.

AMONTILLADO WINE, first imported into England in 1811. It is called Amontillado sherry, from the grape being grown on the mountains. It has a peculiar flavour, slightly aromatic, and answers admirably to the improved taste of the present age. AMORIUM WAR (A.D. 838) between Theophilus and Motassem, the latter suc- cessful. Sosopetra, the native place of Motassem, having been razed by The- ophilus, Motassem in revenge attacked Amorium, the birth-place of Theophilus, and destroyed it. These wars, between the Christians and Arabs, were conducted with the most savage spirit. AMOY, China. A trade with this town permitted in 1676. The fort destroyed by the English, July, 1840. The town captured, Aug. 26, 1841. The port opened for trade by treaty, Aug. 26, 1842. The town fell under the assault of the insurgents, 1853 ; but was retaken the same year. AMPHICTYONIC COUNCIL, instituted in Greece, B.C. 1000, as a federative tribunal for settling the disputes of the Greek states with one another. It usually sat twice a year : in spring at the temple of Apollo, at Delphi ; and autumn at the temple of Demeter (Ceres), at Thermopylae. The decisions of this council were held as final and sacred. AMPHION frigate blown up at Plymouth, when 250 persons perished, Sept. 22, 1796. AMPHITHEATRE, or two theatres joined together for seeing sights. The stadium of the Greeks was the ancestor of the Roman amphitheatre. In B. c. 60, M. ^imilius Scaurus built an amphitheatre of wood, at Rome, to hold 30,000 spectators ; it was supported by 360 columns of marble, of 38 feet high, and adorned with 3000 brazen statues. The first stone one was built by Pompey the Great — the present palace of Ursini at Rome stands upon its ruins — it held 40,000 spectators. The naumachia of Caesar, an enlarged circus, B. c. 39. The colosseum of Vespasian, now one of the greatest ruins of Europe, A. D. 69. The amphi- theatre at Verona, ascribed to Domitian (A.D.82), held 22,000 men. AMPHITRITE, a convict ship, wrecked on Boulogne sands, with 103 female convicts, 12 children, and a crew of 16 persons, all except three drowned, Aug. 31, 1833. AMPLI, battle, between the Greeks and Turks, in which the former were victors, 1821. AMSTERDAM, Holland. In 1204 on its site was nothing but a small castle called Amstel. In the I4th century it rose into a commercial town, and in 1490 was surrounded with a brick wall. In 1525 an Anabaptist leader, with 600 of his fol- lowers, took possession of the town-house ; and ten years afterwards these fanatics ran about the streets naked ! It was attacked by the Hollanders, 1578, and sub- mitted after a siege of ten months. The House of Correction built, 1595; and its Bank erected, 1609. Hotel de Ville built by Van Campen, 1646. In 1787 it surrendered to the Prussians, and Jan. 20, 1795, received the French with open arms, and was the capital of the Batavian republic. In 1806 it was the seat of government under Louis Bonaparte, and incorporated into the French empire, July, 1810. On Nov. 18, 1813, a provisional government was formed, and in May, 1815, William Frederic, Prince, of Nassau and Orange, was declared sovereign prince. AMULETS. Most nations believed in the efficacy of amulets as charms or pre- servatives against witchcraft and infection. The Egyptians had a great variety, and the Jews early used them, Deut. xviii. 10 ; Jer. viii. 17 ; and in later times ANABAPTISTS ANCHORETS 25 their phylacteries. The superstitious use of them still surrives in the anodyne necklace to assist infants in their teething, the child's caul on board of ship, &c. ANABAPTISTS, or those who baptize a second time. This sect sprung up in 1521, at Wittenberg in Saxony, under Storck, Stubner, and Cellarius. In 1532 a mob of these fanatics, led by John Matthias, attacked Munster, which they called Mount Zion. Several laws were enacted against them from 1525 to 1534, in Saxony, Switzerland, and other parts of Germany. They held the nullity of infant baptism ; that the church stood in no need of ministers, nor the state of civil magistrates ; and that God revealed his will by dreams and visions to chosen individuals. ANACREONTIC VERSE, a kind of measure adopted by Anacreon, the Greek poet, B.C. 525, whose poetry, for the most part, was in praise of wine. In this verse the accent is placed on the first, third, and fifth syllables. ANAGRAM, the transposition of the letters of words so as to form other words of a different meaning. The Roman anagram was confined to the dividing one word into two or more, retaining their original order ; but the modems transpose the entire of the letters in any way to answer their purpose. The appointment of anagrammatist to Louis XIII. was worth 12,000 livres per annum ; and the art, as now practised, was introduced into France in the reign of Charles IX., and into England soon after. Randle Holme, a quaint writer on heraldry, was addressed in this complimentary anagram, ' Lo, Men's Herald ! ' and ' Horatio Nelson,' the immortal hero of the Nile, is aptly converted into 'Honor est a Nilo.' ANASTATIC Printing, invented 1841. This process depends mainly on the an- tagonism of oil and water. A printed sheet of paper is moistened with diluted phosphoric acid, and is pressed on a clean surface of zinc ; and by this contact the acid of the unprinted part etches the zinc beneath, while the printed part sets offon the zinc ; thus producing a reverse copy of the printing on the zinc. The plate is washed with an acid solution of gum, and is then inked ; the affinities in some instances, and the repulsions in others, cause the lines of the device (what- ever it may be) to take the ink, but the other parts of the plate to remain clean ; and the printing then follows. — Dodd. ANATOMY, or dissection, first practised by Hippocrates, B. c. 400 ; cultivated in Alexandria by Erasistratus and Herophilus, B.C. 296; Galen, AD. 161. Mon- dinius, a professor in Bologna, was the first person who publicly dissected, 1315, and published anatomical plates of the human body ; but Vesalius was the first great anatomist, 1540 ; he published several anatomical works. Dr Harvey, his researches, 1616 ; Assellius on lacteals, 1627; and Picquet's discoveries, 1651. Laws to regulate, enacted, 1540 ; new statute respecting, 3 Will. IV. c. 75, 1832. Malefactors to be dissected, by 9 Geo. IV. c. 31, s. 5, June 27, 1828 ; this was repealed by 2 & 3 Will. IV. c. 75, Aug. i. 1832, entitled ' An Act for regulating Schools of Anatomy.' Anatomy of plants discovered, 1680. Modern comparative anatomy founded by John Hunter, 1793. Medical diplomas to candidates were first given at Salerno. ANCHOR. The invention of it is ascribed by Pliny to the Tuscans, and by Pausanias to Midas, who built Ancyra. The most ancient were of stone, some- times of wood inlaid with lead, and had a fluke on one side only. Eupalamus first made them fluked both ways. Sir Samuel Morland, 1661, invented the drum capstan. In 1809 Mr Hemman, of Chatham, invented the mooring anchor. Trotman patented his anchors in 1852, which were afterwards approved of by the Government Hunter, in 1856, made several improvements. ANCHORETS, or ANCHORITES, who lived in caves and cells, originated with Paul, Antony, and Hilarion, in the third century. 26 ANCONA ANGEL ANCONA, Italy; the Romans established a colony here, B. c. 170. The Lombards established themselves in this town about 590. Taken by the Saracens in 839. The Germans obtained possession in 1 1 74, but were expelled a few years after- wards. In 1532 Clement VII. took possession of it, and it remained under the dominion of the popes, until the French captured it in 1 796. Revolts from Rome, 1797 ; taken by the Russians, Nov. 13, 1799 > restored to the papal power, 1802. Taken again by the French, Feb. 23, 1832, and made a free port. The Austrians took it, June 14, 1849 ; the Sardinians, Sept. 29, 1860. ANDAMAN ISLANDS, Bengal, first explored circa 1607 ; became a refuge for shipwrecked mariners in 1791. They were surveyed by Capt. Blair and Col. Colebrooke for the East India Company in June, 1789 ; Capt. Blair sailed from Calcutta to erect a convict settlement upon the island called Port Cornwallis and Chatham Island, Sept., 1789; convicts arrived, Nov. 22, 1794; the settlement was visited by Col. Symes in 1 795 ; abandoned in 1 796 ; the Fleet assembled here in the Burmese war, 1824. The troop ships the Briton and Runnymede were driven upon these islands in 1844.

Arthur Ross was bishop in 1688, when this see was deprived of its temporalities. ^ It is at present united with the sees of Dunkeld and Dunblane. Its cathedral was nearly 160 years in building (1161 — 1318), and was demolished, June, 1559, by the followers of John Knox. ANDREW'S (ST), Cross. In 819 there was a battle between Athelstan, king of England, and Hungus, king of the Picts, when a bright cross, like St Andrew's (X), appeared to Hungus, who, having obtained the victory, ever after bore that figure. ANDREW'S (ST), Order, founded by the emperor of Russia, Peter I., Dec. 20, 1698, and is second in rank of the Russian orders.

The suspension bridge completed over the Menai Straits, Jan., 1826. The Tubular railway bridge opened, March 6, 1850. ANGLING. The antiquity of this quiet recreation is curiously traced by honest Izaak Walton, ' to Seth, one of the sons of Adam, who taught it to his sons ; ' and that Moses, in the Book of Job, also mentions fish-hooks, ' which must imply anglers at that time.' The earliest work on angling was written by Dame Juliana Barnes, prioress of the nunnery of Sopewell, near St Alban's, entitled ' The Treatyse of Fysshinge with an Angle,' printed by Wynkyn de Worde, 1496. The first five editions of Walton's Complete Angler were published in 1653, 1655, 1664, 1668, 1676, and these sold in 1854 for .£40. There have been numerous statutes for regulating angling : the first occurred in the reign of Edward I. ANGLO-SAXONS. The Angli, the allies of the Saxons, inhabited the western extremity of the Vandal territory, part of Mecklenburg and Hanover. The Saxon confederacy was divided into three branches : I. The Ostphali ; 2. The West- phali, one at the east and the other at the west of the Elbe ; and 3. The Angarii, who were situated between the first two divisions. They first settled in Britain, A.D. 449 ; their conversion by St Augustine and the clergy of lona commenced 596. ANGLO-SAXON STEAMSHIP, wrecked off Cape Race, when 300 of her passengers perished, April 25, 1863. ANGORA, Turkey. The chief town of the Tectosages in Galatia, B.C. 277 ; sub- dued by Manlius, B.C. 189; made a Roman province, B.C. 25.

The Tartars under Tamerlane defeated the Turks under Bajazet, with great slaughter, July 28, 1402. ANHALT, House of, an ancient German family, which claim their origin from Berenthobaldus, who made war upon the Thuringians in the sixth century. Joachim Ernest, who died 1586, left five sons, who divided the principality among them, and thus gave rise to the five branches of the family of Anhalt. These branches eventually submitted to the eldest, Anhalt-Dessau. At the establishment of the Germanic Confederation in 1815 there were three reigning dukes, Anhalt-Cothen, Anhalt-Bernburg, and Anhalt-Dessau ; the first line became extinct in 1847, and the second, Aug. 19, 1863 ; the heir of the third, Leopold, succeeded to the title of the Duke of, Aug. 9, 1817.
