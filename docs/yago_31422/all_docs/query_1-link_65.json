Lady Packer also wrote several works which were based upon her husbandâs private correspondence including Grey Mistress (1949), Home from the Sea (1963) and Deep at the Sea (1975).

She was appointed priestess of an all female cult founded by her to honour of the god Dionysius. Later she altered the rules of admission and began initiating young men into the cult. Paculla Annia encouraged promiscuity by introducing orgiastic nocturnal rites. This movement, which supported crimes like forgery and murder, attracted large numbers of adherents and quickly became a threat to social order and stability. Large numbers were eventually rounded up by order of the Senate in Rome, and put to death. Presumably Paculla Annia suffered this fate.\n\nPadilla, Maria de â (1335 â 1361)\n\nSpanish courtier\n\nMaria de Padilla was the daughter of Juan Garcia de Padilla. Maria became the mistress of Pedro I âthe Cruelâ, king of Castile (1350 â 1369) in 1351, the same year he was forced to marry the French princess Blanche de Bourbon for dynastic reasons. Pedro immediately deserted his queen for Maria, whom he established at the castle of Castro Kerez, where their son Alfonso, and his three sisters, Beatriz, Constanza (Constance) and Isabella were all born. Maria retained the kingâs affection till her death at the age of twenty-five, and was interred in the Cathedral of Seville, in Andalusia.\n\nSoon after Mariaâs death the king convoked a special meeting of the Cortes (estates) in Seville, and declared that he and Maria had been lawfully married, producing his chaplain, his chancellor, and a brother of Mariaâs as witnesses to the ceremony. The archbishop of Toledo took their oaths, the coupleâs marriage was declared legitimate, and thus Mariaâs children became legitimate. This decision was also an admission of bigamy. Maria was never crowned or even recognized as queen in her lifetime, and nothing more could be done than provide her with a magnificent funeral. Her son Alfonso died young in 1367, and of her two younger daughters, the elder Constanza (1354 â 1394) was recognized by the Plantagenets as titular Queen of Castile (1369 â 1388) and married John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, whilst her younger sister Isabella married his brother Edmund, Duke of York, both sons of Edward III.\n\nPadilla de Sanz, Trina â (1864 â 1957)\n\nPuerto-Rican poet\n\nTrina Padilla was the daughter of the poet-physician Jose Gualberto Padilla.

She is attested by a surviving inscription from Rome. Padusia, her husband, and a Christian deacon named Grunitus were all accused of plotting against the powerful military commander Aetius. He ordered all three to be condemned and executed in Ravenna. Padusia is believed to be identical with the court lady named âSpadusia,â who was identified as a friend and confidante of the empress Galla Placidia, the mother of Valentinian III. Her story was recorded in the Chronicle of Prosper Tiro and in the Chronicon of Haydatius Lemicensis.\n\nPaetina, AeliaÂ Â Â seeÂ Â Aelia Paetina Tuberonis\n\nPaganell, Agnes â (c1100 â after 1141)\n\nEnglish medieval heiress\n\nAgnes Paganell was the daughter of a Norman noble Fulk Paganell.

Her son, then aged only fourteen, is said to have been taken prisoner by his own father, who sent him as a prisoner to King Stephen. The king however, courteously allowed Robert to return home to Lady Agnes at Skelton. It would appear that this was a family arrangement to prevent the family estates, in the case of either side winning, from being forfeited. Agnes survived her husband, and left four children,\n\nAdam de Brus (c1120 â 1196), third feudal Baron of Skelton.\n\nRobert de Brus (1124 â 1194), surnamed âLe Meschin.â He became the first Baron of Annandale and left descendants.\n\nPagan de Brus.

Her mother was a member of the family of the counts of Rennes in Brittany. When the Viking leader Rollo and his followers besieged the city of Evreux, which was forced to capitulate to him, Count Berengar was slain (892). King Eudes of France then gave Papia to Rollo as his concubine, together with much booty taken from Senlis. Rollo then took over the rule of the territories of Rouen and Evreux, together with lands around the Bessin, near Bayeux, which would have originally constituted Papiaâs inheritance. Despite the fact that Papia was a Christian, her union with Rollo was a âDanish marriageâ (more danico), and was unsanctified by the church. Thus her children by Rollo were technically illegitimate. When Rollo made a political marriage with the Frankish princess Gisela (912) his relationship with Papia continued and she remained his concubine. She was later married off to an important vassal. Through her younger daughter Papia was the ancestress of Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122 â 1204), queen of France and then England. Her children by Rollo were,\n\nGerletta of Normandy (died after 933). She became the wife of William III (c895 â 926), Count of Auvergne, and left descendants.\n\nWilliam I (c910 â 942). He succeeded his father (927) as Duke of Normandy, when Rollo abdicated and became a monk. He was married and left descendants.\n\nRobert of Normandy (died after 932). He became Count of Corbeuil.\n\nGerloc of Normandy (917 â after 970). She became the wife of William III of Poitiers, Duke of Aquitaine (915 â 963) and took the name of Adela, by which she is known to history.\n\nPapia of Envermeu (Papie) â (c1003 â c1048)\n\nDuchess consort of Normandy (c1019 â 1026)\n\nPapia of Envermeu was a rich heiress from north-eastern Normandy. She became the second wife (c1019) of Richard II (c974 â 1026), Duke of Normandy (996 â 1026). Papia and her mother held estates at Envermeu, and her brothers later granted their own estates of Monterolier, Carouit and the Church of Gonneville, to the Abbey of St Wandrille (Wandregiselus), when they entered that establishment as monks about the time of their sisterâs marriage. Thus Papia brought the remainder of the familyâs estates situated from Envermeu, near the coast, to Les Andelys on the Seine River to the ducal family.\n\nHer two sons by Richard became the heirs of their motherâs family. Papia survived her husband for over two decades as Dowager Duchess (1026 â c1048). With her death her two sons granted the estate of Perniers-sur-Andelle to the abbey of St Ouen, Rouen, in memory of their mother. The suggestion that Papia had been involved in an earlier liasion with Duke Richard prior to their marriage would appear to be a confusion with Papia, the wife of Duke Rollo, in the preceeding century. Duchess Papiaâs sons later rebelled against the ducal house. Her children were,\n\nWilliam of Normandy (c1021 â after 1053), Count of Arques. He was married and left issue.\n\nMauger of Normandy (c1023 â 1055). He took holy orders and was created Archbishop of Rouen (1037).

She became the wife of Parthenius (c470 AD â 548) who held several high ranking military positions. Ruricius, Bishop of Limoges wrote a letter jointly to Papianilla and Parthenius recorded in his Epistulae, which reveals their marriage took place prior to 507. She bore her husband at least one child, unnamed in the sources. However, her husband later caused Papianilla to be put to death on the grounds of suspicion of adultery with his friend Ausonius. Her death was recorded by Gregory of Tours in his Historia Francorum.\n\nPapianilla, Avita â (c433 â after 474 AD)\n\nRoman Imperial princess\n\nAvita Papianilla was the daughter of the Emperor Eparchius Avitus (455 â 456 AD).

Her husband recorded in his Epistulae that Papianilla brought him a large estate in the Auvergne, in Gaul as her dowry. Gregory of Tours recorded in his Historia Francorum that when Sidonius secretly gave away the family silver to support the poor, Papianilla bought it all back. Her husband was elected as Bishop of Clermont (472 AD) married bishops being the norm at this time. She was living two years later. Papianilla left three daughters and an only son, Apollinaris (c455 AD â 515), who obtained political preferment under the Visigothic king Alaric II.

Scipio immediately handed over to Papiria all the former possessions of Aemilia, and she took a prominent place during the ceremonial processions attended by the women of Rome.
