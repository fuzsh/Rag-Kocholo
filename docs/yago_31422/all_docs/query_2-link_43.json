have enjoyed dining and entertainment with family, friends, and strangers, in the privacy of their homes or in public places. They have interrupted their daily routines by celebrating religious or secular holidays, or such personal rites of passage as birth, coming-of-age, marriage, and death. Food plays a central role in all these activities. It is the most basic human need, but as the study of entertaining practices shows, food is much more than a means for survival. Imbued with symbolic meaning since the beginning of human history, food defines our individual selves. Not just what we eat, but how we eat it has traditionally determined our membership in a group, and our status and power within that group. The structures and rules we have built around our use of food make it a form of communication not dissimilar from language. And like language, food is a shared experience. The goal of this encyclopedia is to present to a general reader the dining and entertaining practices and traditions of cultures from around the world from ancient times to the present, at festivals and family events. The work has an anthropological perspective in that it seeks to explain the links between a culture’s political, economic, religious, or social circumstances and its method of dining and entertaining, with ample space being devoted to popular culture. The encyclopedia is arranged alphabetically from A to Z. Its 120 entries range in length from several hundred to over 5,000 words. They\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nwere written by 64 contributors who are all experts in their respective fields. The encyclopedia has a worldwide focus and offers the following special features: a Guide to Related Topics, cross-references in the entries whenever appropriate, a list of printed and /or digital sources for each entry to facilitate further research on the topic, and sidebars to 22 entries. The two-volume set is also richly illustrated and provides an extensive general bibliography for further study. The individual entries cover cultures as diverse as Brazil, Sub-Saharan Africa, Italy, or Russia; popular customs found in cultures from around the world, such as the Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan or Deepavali in India; time periods from antiquity to the present; dining-related objects such as chopsticks, finger bowls, or serving platters; a variety of foods, beverages, and courses that figure prominently in entertaining; domestic entertaining from barbeque to coffee klatch and Tupperware party; family celebrations such as birthdays, baby and bridal showers or bar / bat mitzvahs; holidays and festivals from Christmas to Kwanzaa to Sugaring Off Parties; entertaining in public places from the beer garden to the Parisian café; the role of the media in entertaining; as well as famous hostesses. Given the wide range and multifaceted nature of the topic of entertaining through world history, an effort was made to include as much material as is possible in a two-volume format. The encyclopedia is intended to provide a stepping stone for readers interested to delve deeper into the rich and fascinating world of entertaining. The alphabetical arrangement of the work makes it easy to retrieve information on a particular subject, but the encyclopedia also invites browsing. With the help of the Guide to Related Topics, the cross-references, illustrations, and bibliographic information, it furthermore provides the user with a powerful tool for larger research projects on any of the many aspects connected with entertaining, a topic everybody can relate to in their daily lives. By widening the view from North America to the world, it is hoped that the encyclopedia contributes in its own small way to our understanding and appreciation of world cultures with their many similarities and differences. Multiculturalism and mobility are the hallmarks of our age, and the more culturally literate we are the better we can understand our fellow humans with whom we share the planet. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The realization of this project would not have been possible without the efforts of its many contributors and the enthusiastic support of the editorial staff at Greenwood Press. Special thanks go to Lindsay Claire, Senior Development Editor, who managed to keep the publication of the encyclopedia on track. She was not only a model of efficiency but an absolute pleasure to work with.\n\nMelitta Weiss Adamson\n\nA American Frontier In the early nineteenth century the new American republic underwent extraordinary transformations in every aspect of its life. Not least of these was the transformation in American ideals about who Americans themselves were and the new society that they were creating: a democratic republic inhabited and run by people with equal rights and opportunities. Such ideals, whether realized or not, flowed through the rules and practices of hospitality. Whether in lodging or dining, nowhere than on the new frontiers were democratic notions better seen and remarked upon by both visitors to the newly established United States and by Americans themselves. AMERICANS ON THE MOVE In 1794, Moreau de Saint-Méry, a French jurist of Santo Dominican birth who lived in the new United States for a few years observed, “One is astonished at the rapidity with which Americans have formed settlements in the interior. . . . He emigrates, especially if he be a northerner, to go South or West, to the backwoods of the United States on the Ohio, disposing of his property, selling the house, the wagon, the horse, the dog, anything that will fetch a price” (Moreau de Saint-Méry 1947).\n\n2\n\nAmerican Frontier\n\nAmericans were on the move as the nation’s population soared, mainly through immigration but also high birth rates. Census figures for 1790 give 3,918,000, living mainly along the eastern seaboard. Thirty years later it had risen to 10,086,000, and by 1840 it was 17,018,000. By the latter date 800,000 were foreign born. The West—west of the Allegheny Mountains, the Northwest Territories—beckoned. Land was abundant, cheap, and increasingly cleared of American Indians. The new state of Illinois, for example, had 55,211 white inhabitants in 1820 and 476,183 by 1840, but disease, war, and removal to areas west of the Mississippi River reduced tribes of the Illinois Confederacy to almost zero. To accommodate hunger for land and, as Moreau says, a ravening desire for money (all visitors from abroad noted Americans’ avarice as a central feature of their lives), America became the world’s center for innovations in transportation. Water and roads provided the first links to the gleaming west. The Ohio River, flowing from Pittsburgh provided a main highway to the Mississippi River and along it rose cities such as Wheeling, West Virginia, and Cincinnati, Ohio, in addition to numerous towns and villages. Families such as Abraham Lincoln’s followed the Ohio River from Kentucky to Indiana and Illinois, living in crude backwoods settlements with cooking and hospitality to match. As a young man Abraham Lincoln floated a flatboat down the Mississippi River to New Orleans and returned by steamboat. By then, the 1820s, steamboats were plying U.S. rivers and lakes in large numbers. Dangerous as they were—explosions, fires and consequent fatalities were common—these new boats carried many passengers, all of whom needed feeding, hence the rise of America’s first floating restaurants, catering to Americans’ peculiar dining habits. Steamboats were not wholly responsible for the most important construction feat of the period: the Erie Canal. Funded by the state of New York and finished in 1825, the 364 mile–long canal linked Lake Erie (at Buffalo) to New York City via the Hudson River. The canal brought goods from the Midwest and, in return, sent people from the east. If not for the canal, Chicago would not have developed into a major metropolis. Crudely made, rutted, mud and dust filled, roads were always a problem. Means of transport were either horseback, wagons (including Conestogas), and coaches, the latter two hardly knowing the comfort of cushioning springs. If ever the interior of the continent were to be developed, decent roads were necessary. The first federally funded road building project, the National Road (US Route 40 today) began at Cumberland, Maryland, in 1815, and reached Vandalia, Illinois, by the early 1830s. Thus was the Midwest opened further to settlement. Along the National Road route and many other new roadways, taverns, inns, hotels, hamlets, and towns sprang up. All, to one extent or another, catered to travelers, and a literature describing their journeys developed. The railroad was another—and one of the most amazing to contemporaries—aspect of the transportation revolution. From the first, the Baltimore\n\nAmerican Frontier and Ohio Railroad (B & O) in 1830, rails spread like spider webs across the country. Naturally, eating places and watering holes appeared at every stop: what may be the first lunch counter appeared at the Chicago rail terminus in the early 1850s. At railway stations, as along roads, rivers, and canals, hospitality and entertaining took on distinctly democratic American styles. HOSPITALITY ON THE ROAD AND IN NEW SETTLEMENTS Charles Woodmason, an Anglican minister, provided the earliest accounts of back country hospitality and culinary customs in rural North Carolina. His 1768 journal describing his efforts to civilize the Scotch–Irish Presbyterians of the region is a classic of dark humor, irony, and satire—a fascination with horrors. “These people eat twice a day only,” he said, “as for tea they know it not . . . neither beef nor mutton nor beer, or anything better than water.” In the back settlements people had stronger drink; Bourbon whiskey, distilled from the ubiquitous corn, rather than Scotch barley, was the common table drink. “Even little children were served whiskey at table, with a little sugar to sweeten its bitter taste” (Woodmason 1953). Wooden trenchers and wooden mugs, accompanied by hunting or scalping knives and big spoons, provided table settings; tables themselves were rough wooden trestles. There were only two meals a day, breakfast and midday. Even so Woodmason claimed that the food “and their Provisions I could not touch—All the Cookery of these People being exceeding filthy, and most execrable.” On one occasion he recalled: In this plight wet to the skin [I] rode to and fro till night came, when got to Cabbin of a poor Old Dutch Woman, who inform’d me that I was got into the Waxaw Distric among a tribe of Presbyterians . . . She had no Refreshments. Not a grain of Corn for the Horse, nor the least Subsistance. We left the Horse to shift for himself and to feed on the twigs and Bushes—Her Son was from home—She dry’d my Cloaths, and I sat up all Night by the Fire, quite tired and spent, having nor made what could be called a Meal for some days—Nothing but Indian Corn Meal to be had Bacon and Eggs in some Places—No Butter, Rice, or Milk—As for Tea and Coffee they know it not. These people are all from Ireland, and live wholly on Butter, Milk, Clabber and what in England is given to the Hogs and Dogs. (34)\n\nThis fare and the rough digs are reminiscent of many, but not all, travel stories from this time period. Bed and board in public hostelries varied greatly; stable, settled towns offered better accommodations. Bernhard Karl, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, a German traveler to Utica, New York, in 1826 was pleased by his stay at Shepherds Hotel, which he described as tidy and cheap. The food served tells another story familiar to visitors of the time: Breakfast is announced a half hour after rising time. The table is set in the dining room and laden with beefsteak, mutton, a chicken or other roasted\n\n3\n\n4\n\nAmerican Frontier\n\nfowl, fish, and boiled potatoes, generally of good quality. The waiters, or, in some places, the waitresses, pass around tea or coffee. Since the Americans are usually reticent people, such a meal passes very quickly and silently. Dinner is normally served at two in the afternoon and tea at seven. The table is then set as at breakfast, with the addition of stews and pastry. Wine is never drunk at meals. On the table are water and whiskey which mixed are considered the healthiest drink in the summer. Everyone must reach for what he likes, since the food is never passed around. There are no napkins; the tablecloths must fill their place. Apart from the spoons, there is no silverware on the tables. The two-pronged forks and the knives are made of steel with handles of staghorn. A praiseworthy usage absolves the traveler of the necessity of tipping at his departure. (157)\n\nTravelers with any sophistication—Europeans, especially—noted Americans’ lack of interest in fine dining, leisurely eating, and good dinner conversation. Rather, Americans ate fast, drank lots of hard liquor, smoked and spit tobacco (spittoons were fixtures in all public places), and wanted copious quantities of food. The main difference between the poor and wealthier appears to have been the latter, in the amount of food consumed. That most modern Americans today consume large quantities of cheap food shows the so-called progress of gastronomic democracy. In 1810 Margaret Van Horn Dwight left her home in New Haven, Connecticut, to find a new home in the new town of Warren, Ohio (along with a new hometown, she also found a husband and had 13 children). As described in her journal, the hospitality she received during the six-week long trek by wagon and by foot was abysmal. It makes one wonder why anyone would have chosen to undertake such a journey. Here is a description of what she experienced in West Chester, Pennsylvania: I should even rather drink clear rum out of the wooden bottle after the deacon has drank & wip’d it over with his hand, than to stay here another night (The house is very small & very dirty—it serves for a tavern, a store, & I should imagine hog’s pen stable & every thing else—The air is so impure I have scarcely been able to swallow since I enter’d the house—The landlady is a fat, dirty, ugly looking creature, yet I must confess very obliging—She has a very suspicious countenance & I am very afraid of her—She seems to be master, as well as mistress & storekeeper, & from the great noise she has been making directly under me for this half hour, I suspect she has been “stoning the raisins & watering the rum”—All the evening there has been a store full of noisy drunken fellows. (7–8)\n\nDown the road, the hosts were more pleasant but the surroundings were no better: The house by day light looks worse then ever—every kind of thing in the room where they live—a chicken half pick’d hangs over the door—& pots, kettles, dirty dishes, potatoe barrels—& every thing else—& the old woman—it is beyond my power to describe her—but she & her husband & both very kind & obliging—it is as much as a body’s life is worth to go near them. The air has already had a medicinal effect upon me—I feel as if I had\n\nAmerican Frontier taken an emetic—& should stay till night I most certainly be oblig’d to take to my bed, & that would be certain death—I did not think that I could eat in the house—but I did not dare refuse. (64)\n\nAfter slogging over the Alleghenies, through almost impassible streams and mud-clogged roads, and having to listen to lewd and blaspheming “Dutchmen” teamsters, Margaret, cold and tired, reached the promised land, a town much more pleasant than she had expected. The town was able to provide her with a good cup of lady-like tea. If travel overland was rough, all that was to change with steamboats and railroads. Steamboat accommodations and food ranged from crude to luxurious. Of the latter, an Ole Munch Raeder, Norwegian visitor crossing the Great Lakes from Buffalo to Milwaukee in 1847 observed: On the Great Lakes there is only one means of travel, for immigrants as well as for others, and that is the steamship. The elegance of such a ship is quite remarkable. The vessel is equipped in every possible way for the convenience of the passengers; there is, for example, a barber shop. There is also a band. (205)\n\nRaeder liked America, Americans, and even American pigs, which he praised for their fecundity and garbage-cleaning ( by consuming it) habits. Other visitors were not so pleased. In 1827 Frances (Fannie) Trollope, an English author and mother of renowned author Anthony Trollope, came to America to seek a better life in Cincinnati, Ohio. Embarking on a grand ship, she soon discovered a carpet made filthy with spittle and wrote: “Let no one who wishes to receive agreeable impressions of American manners, commence their travels in a Mississippi steam boat; for myself, it is with all sincerity I declare, that I would infinitely prefer sharing the apartment of a party of well conditioned pigs to the being confined to its cabin.” Food was often not much better, hard venison and peach-sauce, and “hung beef, ‘chipped up’ raw being staples” (12–13). Charles Dickens was as famous on the west side of the Atlantic Ocean as he was at home in England. The demand to see him in the flesh was so great that in 1842 he did a tour, making a huge sum of money (needed to support his 10 children). His impressions of his adoring fans, as published in Martin Chuzzlewit and American Notes for General Circulation, chilled their enthusiasm. Boarding the Messenger bound for Cincinnati he found that “at each [meal], there are a great many small dishes and plates upon the table, with very little in them; so that although there is every appearance of a mighty ‘spread,’ there is seldom really more than a joint: except for those who fancy slices of beet-root, shreds of dried beef, complicated entanglements of yellow pickle; maize, Indian corn, apple-sauce, and pumpkin” (170). Dickens further described the eating habits of Americans: Some people fancy all these little dainties together (and sweet preserves beside), by way of relish to their roast pig. They are generally those dyspeptic ladies and gentlemen who eat unheard-of quantities of hot corn bread (almost as good for the digestion as a kneaded pin-cushion), for\n\n5\n\n6\n\nAmerican Frontier\n\nbreakfast, and for supper. Those who do not observe this custom, and who help themselves several times instead, usually suck their knives and forks meditatively, until they have decided what to take next: then pull them out of their mouths: put them in the dish; help themselves; and fall to work again. At dinner, there is nothing to drink upon the table, but great jugs full of cold water. Nobody says anything, at any meal, to anybody. All the passengers are very dismal, and seem to have tremendous secrets weighing on their minds. There is no conversation, no laughter, no cheerfulness, no sociality, except in spitting; and that is done in silent fellowship round the stove, when the meal is over. Every man sits down, dull and languid; swallows his fare as if breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, were necessities of nature never to be coupled with recreation or enjoyment; and having bolted his food in a gloomy silence, bolts himself, in the same state. But for these animal observances, you might suppose the whole male portion of the company to be the melancholy ghosts of departed book-keepers, who had fallen dead at the desk: such is their weary air of business and calculation. Undertakers on duty would be sprightly beside them; and a collation of funeral-baked meats, in comparison with these meals, would be a sparkling festivity. (170)\n\nTravelers on antebellum railroads could not expect better bed and board than early road voyagers. Train travel was slow (15 miles per hour in the 1830s), seats were hard, and in warm weather open windows allowed in all manner of cinders and smoke from the locomotive, plus dust that covered passengers from head to toe. Dining cars were not even thought about until the later 1860s, so passengers got snacks from vendors when trains stopped at stations (to take on water and fuel). In 1848, railroads from Chicago to Galena in the western part of Illinois had sheds at depots where passengers could buy food. Long trips necessitated overnight stays in hostelries where the food varied. For instance, in 1857, Stephen Sharply wrote about a trip on the Erie Railroad to Cleveland, then onto New York for his sister’s wedding. He described stopping in Oswego, New York, at the American Hotel for what he hoped would be a good dinner and a good night’s rest: “They served me at the American with a little hard nubbin of steak, whether beef, or venison, or mutton, I cannot say. And the Irish maid who served it in a long, cold ball accepted to think that I was coming the genteel strongly to be eating warm meat at that hour” (3). At least he did not have to share a bed with more than one fellow traveler, as was often the case in the nineteenth century. In the morning Sharply breakfasted upon the remains of that steak. But most of the passengers were less irritated than they might have been due to the liberal amounts of brandy with which they were fortified. Virtually every travel account by foreigners and many Americans mention how much liquor Americans drank everywhere but in church, and in the back country, people sometimes even drank in church. Charles Dickens did not return to the United States for another 20 years and Fanny Trollope never looked back once she returned to her native England. Both, along with many of their social class, disliked the rough,\n\nAncient Greece unschooled, masculine-egalitarian, avaricious culture that they found in the new United States. Such ideas, taken by contemporaries as embodying democracy itself, were borne out in hospitality. One frontier town was a model for hospitality: Chicago. In 1833, the year it was incorporated as a town, Chicago consisted of 200 people and about 40 buildings. Among them was the Sauganash Tavern, a two-story clapboard hotel-dance-halltavern operated by a colorful character named Mark Beaubien, who said, “I play de fiddle like the devil and keep hotel like hell.” Every night was dance night as Beaubien fiddled dance tunes for guests—Yankees, French-Canadians, Southerners, Potawatomis—all men without benefit of class and regardless of origin. Beaubien charged 50 cents a night for a space on the floor and a blanket, along with food and lots of whisky. Food was mainly game all year round but also included local beans, corn, fruit, and fish. The proprietor’s most celebrated lines about his restaurant service was: “I eats 50 people for dinner every day, by gar” (Hurlbut 332). Charles Dickens might have created a character like Beaubien, but Dickens wouldn’t have wanted to dine with him. Further Reading: Bernhard Karl, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.

The Greeks included those living in the Balkan peninsula and also those settled in Asia Minor, southern Italy, southern France, and numerous Aegean islands. What bound them together were a common language, religious beliefs, and kinship. Those who lived outside these areas were\n\n7\n\n8\n\nAncient Greece\n\nregarded as “barbarians.” As in the case of the Romans, Greeks outside the Balkan peninsula assimilated some traits of their neighbors but many kept to the accustomed ways of their ancestors. In the Balkan peninsula the Greeks never formed a nation or a country as a united whole until they were conquered first by Macedonia and then by Rome. Within the Balkan peninsula the land was divided into city-states, of which the greatest were Athens, Sparta, and Thebes. Each city-state was determined to remain independent and was usually ruled by an elite group, but it was probably Sparta that had the most individual lifestyle and customs. During the Archaic Age (c. 630–480 B.C.) Athens suffered drought that led to uprisings, but these uprisings were put down by the lawgiver Solon, who also prevented famine by forbidding the export of corn and agricultural products. Only olive oil could be exported because there was a surplus of it. His tactics succeeded, and he also created the development of a city elite, which controlled many Greek states over several generations, thus ensuring stability. This stability enabled the Greeks to defeat the attack of the Persians in the fifth century B.C., and after the first Peloponnesian War, the stability led to the rise of the Athenian statesman Pericles. Pericles created an empire of states, dominated by Athens. Starting in 446 B.C., the age of Pericles lasted for 30 years, during which time the population of Athens and of other states was adequately fed. During the historic period of Greek history, the food eaten would obviously vary from area to area, but there seem to have been certain common foods and food products. When basic foods were available they provided great variety, especially for Athenians. A minor cereal in Greece was millet. The major cereals were einkorn and emmer (both are ancient varieties of wheat), and barley, the latter being both the two-row and six-row variety. The Phoenicians imported durum wheat into Greece. All these grains could be used to thicken stews, make a pottage or, more often, ground into flour. From the flour a large variety of breads and cakes were made. The Athenians were able to import more wheat than other cities, thus allowing them to have a preference for white bread (artos). Both wheat bread and flat, barley, griddle cakes (maza) could be easily obtained from city bakers or, as in country areas, be baked on flat stones. Poorer people subsisted on maza, which often served as a plate similar to the bread trencher of the medieval period. City bakers produced a variety of bread and pastries. In households, dough was put under a pot on which hot ashes were piled thus causing the dough to rise. Much of the bread, however, was unleavened, producing flat breads, although froth from beer could be used as a raising agent. Some wealthy households had their own specialized bakers. Cappadocian bakers were considered the best. Phoenician bakers would provide leavened bread as they worked with yeast or a yeast substitute. Bread was a staple to accompany opson, a variety of relishes—olive oil, onions, sheep or goat’s milk cheese, garlic, eggs, fish, smoked or pickled in brine, and, more rarely, tiny pieces of meat. Not all of these would be eaten at one meal. One product, trachanas made of boiled milk and coarsely ground millet, dried\n\nAncient Greece in sheets in the sun and then stored in tightly sealed jars was probably part of the diet. Other basic foods especially for the poorer elements of society were pulses. Many were gathered from the wild before being cultivated, such as vetch, peas, and lupines. Beans, lentils, peas and chickpeas were useful because they could be dried and stored as well as being used fresh. Chickpeas if roasted or eaten very young could be eaten as a dessert. Classical writers commented on the fact that they could cause intestinal gas but this downside was thought to be balanced out by their high nutritional value. Beans and peas could be added to meat stews; lentils, in particular, were used to make a filling stew or could be served on their own. Vegetables were plentiful and were often preferred to meat. These included cabbages, carrots, artichokes, chicory, onions and garlic, lettuce, leeks, celery, cucumber, and spinach. Both leaves and roots of beets and turnips were eaten. A wild form of asparagus was available. Herbs could enhance cooking of dishes. Thyme, dill, sage, basil, mint, rue, and hyssop were gathered from the wild or cultivated in gardens. Mushrooms and nettles were available in the wild. Some foods were used only by the poor: including fat hen, fennel, wild chervil, wild spinach, hoary mustard, and nightshade, all of which were mostly gathered rather than cultivated. The ancient Greeks enjoyed a wide variety of fruits, including grapes, figs, pomegranates, medlars, quinces, apples, and pears. Fruits were regarded more as appetizers at a meal than as dessert ingredients, although myrtle berries were an exception to this. Together with nuts fruits were regarded with pleasure at the end of a symposium. Apples may have been brought from Anatolia or Iraq, although wild, and presumably small and sour apples, were known in Greece. Other fruits included the wild and cultivated plum, cherries, watermelon and the musk melon, probably imported from western Asia, and a variety of berries. Dried figs and dates were imported from Anatolia, and their leaves were used as a wrapping for meat dishes. Medlars were eaten when they were so ripe that they were almost rotting. Nuts included almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, and sweet chestnuts. Lentisk nuts, which were also chewed to cleanse the breath, and terebinth nuts are less known today but were popular with the ancient Greeks. Both the trees have tender shoots, which can be pickled before being eaten. Pine kernels were often used both as dessert and as an ingredient in cooking. Dairy products were rare apart from being made into cheese. Cheese, probably made from sheep and goat’s milk, was eaten throughout Greece. It was not eaten alone but with honey, figs, and olives. It could also be incorporated into bread baking. Oxygala, however, a form of yogurt, was eaten and sometimes mixed with honey. Ancient Greek and Roman cuisine did not rely on non-cultured milk products, which can be explained in part because without refrigeration milk becomes sour very quickly and hence was difficult to transport to more urban areas. Non-cultured milk products were, however, a regular part of the diet of shepherds and peasants who kept sheep and goats. The Greeks, similar to the Romans, regarded milk\n\n9\n\n10\n\nAncient Greece\n\ndrinking as a feature of the barbarians, (the Greeks referred sneeringly to the Thracians as “Butter-eaters”). This might be due to the climatic fact that there was a line beyond which olive trees could not be grown. The southern European regions relied on olives and olive oil for cooking and other purposes whereas the northern areas were compelled to rely on milk products for their fats. Honey was the natural sweetener and preservative, and beekeeping, an admired skill, was a major occupation in Greece. The Greeks knew how plants from which the bees gathered pollen could flavor honey. Attic honey was flavored by thyme. Honey from Mount Hymettus was highly prized and was supplied to markets mainly in the form of honeycombs. In Athens it was eaten smeared on flat cakes. Mead produced by the fermentation of diluted honey was produced in Lydia. Meat was expensive. The killing of a kid, for example, meant a loss of a mature goat, which would produce milk and cheese; suckling pig was also considered a luxury. Athenaeus (c. A.D. 200), an Egyptian Greek author of the Deipnosophistae, a tale of 16 men dining together in Rome and discussing a broad variety of subjects including food, in commenting on Greek meals, wrote that goat’s meat was for slaves but wild boar meat should be kept for oneself and a friend. Butter and cheese made from sheep and goat’s milk was more appreciated than cow’s milk. Beef was more of a rarity because oxen were sacrificial animals. When they were slaughtered at religious festivals the meat would be distributed amongst those gathered to worship the deity. Dogs and asses were sometimes eaten. Whether this was a regular occurrence or done in times of famine is not certain. Meat was sometimes eaten in the form of sausages, of which the Greeks were inordinately fond. Animals such as hares, wild boars, wild goats, deer, and birds were hunted for food. Birds were best served spit roasted with cheese and oil sprinkled over them, perhaps eaten more of a snack than a full meal. These included domesticated fowls and geese as well as game birds—grouse, mallards, pigeons, and pheasants. Very few birds were safe from the culinary attentions of the ancient Greeks. Small birds of every variety including thrushes, blackbirds, chaffinches, sparrows, and larks were sold in markets. The eggs of these birds were also appreciated, either hard or soft-boiled. Both yolks and whites were used in preparing dishes. Most ancient Greek communities had some means of access to the sea so that fish was relatively cheap and plentiful. All types of fish were eaten including tunny, grey mullet, conger eel, dogfish, angel shark, and swordfish. Mackerel, mullet, and sturgeon could be imported from the Black Sea, the last more of a delicacy than a regular meal. Eels from Lake Kopaïs provided a more expensive dish; meals, which included this delicacy, were an example of conspicuous consumption. The Athenians despised small fish preferring to eat larger fish such as turbot and bream. The annual migration of tunny provided ample opportunities for catching large quantities of this fish, and it was eaten fresh and salted. Some of the smallest fish, however, were served as a fry called aphye, which could include squid and crabs.\n\nAncient Greece Shellfish was also abundant in coastal regions. Even cuttlefish could make a good meal. Oysters were particularly prized as they were by the Romans and were eaten in great quantities. Liquamen, the fish sauce, which was prized by the Romans, seems to have been devised in Bithynia, as a profitable way of making use of small fish, which might otherwise have been discarded. From there it spread to Greece, but it was the Romans who exploited and made use of it in so many of their dishes, as indicated by the recipes in the Roman cookery book of Apicius. Wild olive trees have been known in Greece from Neolithic times, but the first cultivated olives, with the intention of pressing olive oil, were grown in Crete and soon spread throughout Greece. The trees were prized because the goddess Athena was reputed to have raised an olive tree on the Acropolis in a contest with the god Poseidon for dominance of the land. Olive oil, which came in a variety of tastes, was most important for cooking, as a marinade and as a dip for bread. Wine was equally important. Grape pips are known from 4500 B.C. but this may indicate dried or fresh fruit and may not be connected with viticulture. Cultivation of vines appears to have been started about 2000 B.C. at Mytos in Crete. Evidence of wine-lees and grape pips was found in jars at Mycenae. Vineyards were usually small and the property of aristocratic producers until Solon encouraged the peasantry to plant vines. The Greek philosopher Theophrastus of Eresus (370–287 B.C.), who wrote on a wide variety of subjects, in his De Causis Plantarum (On Plant Physiology), explained the quality of soils and discussed the best conditions for planting, grafting techniques, and pruning methods. He advised that in hot climates grapes should be sprinkled with soil to shelter them from the sun. Harvesting took place in September. At first as elsewhere slaves treaded the grapes in a huge vat, but in the sixth century B.C. the Greeks invented the screw and the beam presses, which allowed more efficient extraction of the juice. Wine was then transferred to jars ( pithoi) or amphorae for transportation. The handles would be stamped with the merchant’s name and perhaps names of local officials who could guarantee the quality of the wine. The smaller the jar, the more expensive and the higher the quality of the vintage. Pig and goat wineskins were also used as containers. In his play Cyclops, Euripides made Odysseus put wine into wineskins to ply the Cyclops Polyphemos and make him drunk. The climate of Greece allowed harvests producing wine of even quality, unlike the more variable climate of northern Italy and Gaul. The Greeks added water to their wine, a feature that was also characteristic of the Romans. Different areas produced a variety of wines. Some areas added seawater to the wine; some added herbs and flavorings. Theophrastus noted that the mixing of aromatic Heracala wine with the salty Erythraean wine produced a strongly tasting wine. On the island of Thasos wine was mixed with honey to produce a sweet taste, and the result was regarded as a fine wine as were those of Lesbos, Lemnos, and Rhodes. Cheapest wines were akin in taste to vinegar but this was acceptable to Greek tastes as also was fresh\n\n11\n\n12\n\nAncient Greece\n\ngrape juice. The best wines were left to mature. The poet Homer said that Odysseus’s strong room contained jars of old sweet-tasting wine, packed in rows along the wall. The Greek wine trade soon developed into a huge industry and was almost a monopoly until the second century B.C. when the Romans invaded Greece. As wine production expanded throughout the Roman Empire, prices dropped, and the Greek wine trade became a part of the Roman economy. The Greeks had a thriving agricultural economy, which on the whole provided them with ample food and drink. As with most other civilizations meals were determined by daylight hours. For both breakfast and lunch Greek eating habits remained simple. Breakfast was the breaking of the fast after a night’s sleep taken soon after sunrise; lunch (deipnon) might be a main meal or one that provided some nourishment, as a break from work. The evening meal was the time for relaxation and later became more elaborate, becoming the main meal (deipnon). This became the preliminary to the symposium, which was the time for entertainment, feasting, and wine drinking. For the Greeks the symposium was the ideal form of entertainment and drinking. This followed the main evening meal and became an all-male, aristocratic, social drinking party. The aim of these gatherings was to share pleasure, release tension, forget the cares of the outside world, and promote good\n\nRed-figured Attic terracotta bell-crater from the fourth century B.C.

Vase paintings of women enjoying a symposium do exist, but these are probably indications of male fantasies. Women were present at the symposium as musicians, entertainers, loving companions, and even as attendants who looked after men who could not hold their wine. There were also betrothal symposia, usually held in the spring, at which eligible bachelors discussed the relative merits of girls who might become their brides with the girls’ fathers or brothers. The girls were not present but their marriage prospects would have been considered beforehand. On the island of Delos, an important festival to Apollo was held in May where games and sacrifices were followed by symposia at which suitors were chosen and girls betrothed. Alexander the Great, in what might be considered a parody of this, took with him a large tent that could hold over a hundred couches, which he used for lavish symposia and other entertainments, including the one when he forced his troops to marry Persian women. A symposiarch, or organizer, was in charge of arranging a carefully chosen guest list and then controlling the symposium while it occurred. A guest could ask to bring a friend, but he might just turn up with one and there were always gatecrashers seeking a free drinking session. The organizer, who kept a strict watch on the proceedings, would have no hesitation in expelling a guest who became objectionable. He controlled the pace of drinking and the entertainment and for this would have to have a commanding presence. According to Plutarch, who wrote a series of dialogues and questions in the first century A.D., including some which explained the symposia, the same spirit was required in marshalling a line of battle as in presiding at a symposium. The formalities of the symposium had to be strictly observed. Symposia usually took place in a square or oblong private dining room (andron), which opened directly onto the street or a courtyard, yet provided an intimate drinking place. The floor was usually composed of an elaborate mosaic or a design of pebbles. A small raised platform ran round the walls, and this seemed to have supported one side of the couches, usually 7, 9, or 11, which lined the walls. Guests reclined on these, one or two persons to a couch, and in front of each couch was a table. The custom of reclining on couches seems to have been adopted from the Near East, where the custom had been a royal prerogative. In Greece, it developed as early as the seventh century B.C. Youths aged 18 and over were deemed capable of attending a symposium and had the right to recline. There was an art in reclining. In Aristophanes’s play The Wasps a sophisticated young man, Bdelykleon, exasperatedly instructs his father, Philokleon, in the method of reclining and rearrangement of the legs. Reclining at meals set elite society apart from the lower classes and slaves. In Macedonia, for example, no man was allowed to recline until he had shown his prowess by capturing or killing a wild boar without the aid of nets. Before entering the room guests had to remove shoes and have their feet washed. Garlands of flowers might be offered as crowns or necklaces. The guests could then take their places. The chief guest sat on the first couch\n\n13\n\n14\n\nAncient Greece\n\nto the right of the entrance next to the host. To begin the symposium the host sprinkled wine on the floor and the guests commended themselves to each other in a fixed order. Refreshments and drinking vessels were placed on low tables and at the beginning three toasts were made. The first might be to the Olympian Gods, the second to the Heroes, and the third to Zeus Soter. The symposiarch then decreed what should be the ratio of wine to water and the speed of drinking. Water and wine were mixed in a ratio of 1:3, 1:5, and 2:3. Because the wine was not drunk at full strength, large quantities could be drunk. To drink wine undiluted was considered the action of a barbarian. Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae 436 e–f ) said that King Cleomenes of Sparta urged on by Scythian envoys drank wine undiluted and as a result in a fit of madness slashed himself to death with a knife. In his book The Laws, the Greek philosopher Plato thought that no one under the age of 18 should drink as it might inflame his high spirits. From 18 to 40, wine should be drunk in moderation. After 40, a man could drink as much as he liked to revive his youthful spirit and forget everyday worries. Wine was carried from storage to the symposium in decorated amphorae where it could be chilled in a psykter, a vessel with a rounded body, a short neck, and a high foot; the psykter could be placed in a large krater filled with cold water. The water was carried in a bronze or pottery two-handled hydria. Wine and water were mixed in a large krater, placed in the centre of the room. The krater was usually an elaborately decorated piece for it was the focal point and symbol of the symposium. The elaborate imagery expressed on the kraters often displayed events and experiences occurring at symposia. It was not unusual for revelers to drink three full kraters each evening. Liquid was drawn from the krater by a ladle ( kyathos) and placed in a shallow two-handled pottery drinking bowl ( kylix) or a two-handled cup (skyphos) of gold or silver. The aim of the symposium, however, was not drinking for its own sake; the aim of the symposium was to promote discussion on any subject. The symposium as described in Plato’s Symposium, for example, was concerned with defining the meaning of love. Athenaeus (Deipnosophistae 188 c–f ) said that Homer’s account of the symposium of Menalaus had young men proposing questions to each other as though they were in the company of learned men so they could hold civilized conversations. Plutarch in his Banquet of the Sages said that men did not attend symposia like vases to be filled but to speak seriously or to jest, and to hear and deliver speeches as the occasion required, especially if the participants are to take pleasure in conversing among themselves. Not everyone enjoyed symposia. Plutarch (A.D. 50–129), a priest at Delphi for 30 years, in his Moralia (2.2.147e) said that Pericles consistently declined invitations; he made one exception—the wedding feast of his cousin—and he even left that when libations were being poured at the beginning. Evenings ended with music, poetry, recitations, and playing games. A myrtle wreath was passed from one man to another until the host decreed\n\nAncient Greece a stop. The last man to hold the wreath had to recite or sing. A drinker might balance a wine cup on one arm or in the crook of an elbow and then attempt to pour wine into this cup from a cup held in his other hand. The aim here was obviously to balance the first cup successfully, and success might depend on the amount of wine consumed. Kottabos entailed throwing drops of wine at a metal disc placed on top of a column. Below was a larger disc. A guest hooked a kylix round the index finger of his right hand and spun it round in the air. Drops of wine would be flung out with the aim of knocking the disc off the column to hit the larger disc and make a great noise. Both accuracy and elegance with handling the kylix were taken into consideration. The prizes offered were simple—eggs, fruit, sweets, a pair of sandals, a cup, and cake. Other entertainments were less decorous. Courtesans, who had been well trained for their roles, played instruments, danced, or otherwise entertained the guests. Youths also took provided entertainment, many from distinguished families, probably as an introduction to the symposia. The Greek historian Xenophon (c. 428–354 B.C.) recorded that once two dancers acted a love scene between Ariadne and Dionysus so realistically that the subsequent embarrassment made the symposium end quickly. Even worse could happen if things got out of hand. Guests were reported to vomit and dance drunkenly through the streets and to crash other symposia, resulting in fights. Athenaeus reported that at Agrigentum in Sicily, some young men so overindulged with liquor that they imagined they were sailing in a trireme in a bad storm, tossed all the furniture and bedding out of the house to lighten the presumed ship. A crowd gathered outside and began to run off with this supposed jetsam. Even then the revelers did not stop but poured out of the house to cause mayhem in the street. Next day when still only half sober they were questioned by the magistrates and explained that they had only been trying to save themselves and the ship. The magistrates, probably remembering bouts of drinking when they had been young men, pardoned the revelers but said they must never drink so much again and this was promised. From then on, however, the house where the festivities had occurred was known as The Trireme. An even greater disaster occurred when Alexander, inflamed at a symposium by a passionate speech of a hataera (courtesan) by the name of Thais, led his companions on a drunken revel and set fire to the palace of Xerxes at Persepolis. In Plato’s Protagoras Socrates deplored this kind of behavior saying that where the drinkers are worthy and cultured men there will be no dancing or music or even dancing girls. These men would enjoy their own company without any frivolity, using the occasion to speak and listen in turn to each other. Yet in Xenophon’s version of a symposium, Socrates loved watching dancing girls and even tried to copy their movements. Symposia also might be places for plotting, for men were off their guard. Plutarch in his Parallel Lives (1.9.8) said that when Pelopidas, the Theban general, and his companions wished to get rid of the tyrants at Thebes, they proposed to carry out this action at a symposium. They wore\n\n15\n\n16\n\nAncient Greece\n\nwomen’s clothing over their armor and garlands of pine and fir to hide their faces. The symposium was so popular that it was adopted by the Romans but never to the same popularity possibly because the Romans preferred to have a banquet where food and drink were consumed together, rather than be kept just for social drinking. For the Greeks it was a male and elite pleasure, part of their cultural importance. One Greek state, however, had a completely different lifestyle that was based upon communal living and harsher societal rules in which the symposium had no part. This was Sparta. Spartan men ate one large meal a day in dining groups or messes (syssitia) of 15. Syssitia were compulsory and designed by the state to promote the Spartan ideology of hard living and male bonding amongst equals, although the men were divided by age and by their social status, which was determined by their martial prowess. Boys were separated from their mothers at the age of seven so that they could be included in their own separate messes. Admission to the mess was by lot. When a candidate was proposed, each Spartan in that particular mess took a piece of bread and put it into a bowl. If he had screwed up the bread, this meant he disapproved of the candidate, and a majority of screwed up pieces meant that the candidate would be rejected and excluded from that mess. He had to wait until he had proved himself either in warfare or by excelling in martial exercises before he could be presented again. Wine was permitted but any Spartan who became drunk or indulged in riotous behavior was immediately excluded from his mess. Unlike meals taken elsewhere in Greece, the men did not recline on couches but sat on hard wooden benches. Their main food consisted of barley bread, cheese, wine, figs, and the infamous black broth, a basic pork stew consisting of pork, pigs’ blood, and vinegar. This black broth seems to have acquired some reputation that only the Spartans could eat it. The Greek historian and philosopher Plutarch commented that a certain king of Pontus hired a Laconian cook to make this broth. When the king tasted it, he spat it out whereupon the cook said, “King, this soup should only be taken after a dip in the Eurotas,” a remark that seemingly indicates that the Spartans were in the habit of taking a bath before a meal. Athenaeus said that a Sybarite, after dining in a Spartan mess, remarked that it was reasonable for the Spartans to be the bravest of men since any sensible man would choose to die ten thousand deaths than have to eat such a wretched diet again. The food was not provided entirely by the state. A man had to bring to his mess each month a bushel of barley, eight gallons of wine, five pounds of cheese, two and half pounds of figs, together with opson, the relishes which could be made from meat, fish, and vegetables. When any person made a sacrifice to the gods it was expected that he would send a portion to his mess. Olive oil was provided by the state, and the Spartans ate barley cake soaked in olive oil. Calculations of the food provided have assumed that there were large surpluses, especially of wine. Some food must have been passed to the women, who kept houses for their men. Each Spartan warrior had a helot (a free laborer), who served him and could be called on to\n\nAncient Greece support him in times of war. Food and drink were given to the helots, and they were encouraged to drink as much as possible, including wine from the first pressing so that they would reel through the streets vomiting and making obscene gestures. Their drunken behavior would act as a warning to Spartan warriors both to show what could happen if they drank wine not mixed with water and also to remind them of their general behavior. In Crete men also sat to eat and ate their meals in common, with younger men serving the older ones. Sons sat on the floor by their fathers’ chairs and were served half the food of the father. All the food was served plain without any sauces. A separate table was allotted to strangers and foreigners. The Greek philosopher Plato admired this type of meal as being ideal for equality in a state although he preferred the Greek symposia for encouraging free discussion amongst equals. The symposium, however, never entirely lived up to Plato’s ideals. Once Greek freedom had collapsed under the Macedonian conquest in the fourth century B.C., the symposium became, if it had not been before, little more than a vacuous session of drinking and talking shop. In 359 B.C. Philip II became King of Macedon. He quickly saw that the Persian wars had weakened the grip of both Athens and Sparta on the Greek City states and accepted an invitation from the Thessalians to come to their aid and take over control of the sanctuary of Delphi. He found himself in opposition to Athens and defeated her in 338 B.C. at Chaeronea in central Greece. He did not destroy Athens; rather he preferred to create a federation with himself at its head so that he could lead an expedition to defeat the revived Persian Empire. Before this could happen, Philip was murdered in 336 B.C. His son, Alexander, then aged 20, intended to finish what his father had begun. He moved swiftly to defeat the Persians in three great victories. After the third in 331 B.C., the Persian King, Darius, was murdered, which left Alexander to press on with expeditions to Bactria and India. Here his troops refused to go any further. Alexander died in Babylon in 323 B.C. leaving an empire stretching from the Adriatic in the west to the Ganges in the east. In 12 years he had extended the boundaries of the Greek world far beyond what anyone could have imagined. He had destroyed the Persian Empire, burnt the great city of Persepolis and founded at least 70 cities called Alexandria, although the one in Egypt was to become his main legacy. Alexander had spread Greek culture throughout his empire. In many areas the influence of Greek culture was superficial, and local customs continued to exist. Alexander’s death in 323 B.C. left a vacuum, and his generals fought amongst themselves to establish their own territorial rights. Eventually three kingdoms were created. Macedonia, in the north, was formed under the Antigonid dynasty. In the south, Egypt was ruled by the Ptolomies, and in the east, Turkey, central Asia, Babylonia, and Syria were ruled by the Seleucids. These newly formed kingdoms were to face a more tenacious enemy. By 280 B.C. Roman armies were expanding into Greece. Several of the advances were the result of an appeal by a king or chieftain for help against an enemy, which only led to them succumbing to Rome.\n\n17\n\n18\n\nAncient Rome\n\nFurther Reading: Dalby, Andrew.

Alcock\n\nAncient Rome On the whole the eating habits of ordinary Romans were sensible and abstemious. Quite obvious these habits changed throughout the long history of the Republic and the Empire and when the Romans conquered other areas and peoples. In the hotter parts of the Roman world most people ate frugally during the day and especially if they needed to keep their wits about them; in the colder areas more food might be necessary. Eating was also governed by when work could be done during the day. Most of the working class rose with the sun and went to bed with the sun, as lighting in the evening was so poor. In wealthier households, evening banquets and feasts were held, sometimes as part of political propaganda, to win support for political parties, and as a way for patrons to reward clients. In theory and probably in practice the Romans ate three meals a day. During the day, food was necessary to sustain the body, to provide energy, and to satisfy hunger. Breakfast (ientaculum) was the breaking of the nightly fast, food being taken as soon as a person got up, and therefore was little more than a piece of bread washed down with water and possibly wine. Lunch (prandium), which could be eaten any time between 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. according to when breakfast had been taken, was a snack meal— vegetables, fruit, bread, and a drink. The main aim was restorative. The evening meal (cena) usually consisted of three courses. The first (gustatio) was a taster—something like prepared vegetables, shellfish, and eggs. The main course (primae mensae) was roast, boiled, or braised meats, poultry, sausages, rissoles, and vegetables, flavored with herbs, spices, and liquamen, the ubiquitous Roman fish sauce. The last course (secundae mensae) consisted of desserts—small pastries, puddings made with pulses, egg dishes, fruit, and even more shellfish and oysters. Snails were especially popular as were dormice stuffed with spices. This last course could be a time for more luxurious eating and soft foods, for the softer the food—such as eels and\n\nAncient Rome fish—the more this indicated the wealth of the host. Yet there might be a danger in this food because the softness often verged on putrefaction, which could cause at the least an upset stomach and at its most virulent, death. Wine was the main beverage, though both beer and wine were drunk in the northern parts of the empire and in army camps. Wine could accompany all the courses but more abstemious Romans kept the custom of adding water to wine. The Romans expressed themselves as being shocked by the Celtic habit of drinking wine undiluted, but diluted wine allowed some Romans to drink more than might be normally expected. Drunkenness often accompanied a feast given by an emperor but ordinary households disapproved of drunkenness. The poet Martial was caustic about Sextilanus who drank twice the allowance of wine allotted and did not dilute it with water. Heavy drinking can lead to health problems, and cases of gout have been found in some skeletal remains of ancient Romans. Drinking vessels could be of glass, pewter, or silver. Drinking cups made of silver were highly prized because they indicated the high social status of the host. Excavations have revealed the silver treasures of the House of Menander at Pompeii and of the Villa della Pisanella at Boscoreale. Most of the silver consisted of drinking cups, some in pairs others in sets of four, intricately decorated, presumably chosen in accordance with the host’s taste as well as with regard to providing something for the guests to talk about, especially with admiration. Not all Romans had three meals a day. Poorer people existed on bread or pottages made from grains and pulses, fortified by pieces of meat or fish to give some protein. Bread was usually unleavened and baked in a crock over the fire but the dough might be given some raising agent such as froth from beer, sour grape juice, or sour dough left over from a previous unbaked batch. Bread was enriched by honey or cheese (placed in the middle); it was sprinkled with poppy or sesame seeds or enriched with fruit. In towns people bought bread from bakeries, which ground their own grain in a donkey mill and sieved the flour carefully, so that the bread produced was less gritty than that ground in the home rotary quern. Simple though the meals were, for dinner, some attempt was made to provide something extra, such as meat or fish, and vegetables grown in the adjoining garden. Dinner in wealthier households was the time for relaxation when friends joined the family gathering and were entertained. The poet Martial (ca. A.D. 40–103), a Spaniard who lived in Rome and wrote a book of Epigrams, invited his friends to dine at the ninth hour but the meal could be taken at any time after 4 P.M. Dinner, like a feast, was essential in binding together the family or the community. Dining together implied similar social status. Entertainment after the meal was expected. This could consist of singers, dancers, and reciters. The contents of a grave at Colchester (England) included four reclining figures, obviously the diners, and five other standing figures reading from a scroll, presumably the entertainers. Athletes might also be hired. A torn bikini, found in a well in London (England), may have been the remains of one or two garments covering a dancing female athlete\n\n19\n\n20\n\nAncient Rome\n\nwho entertained appreciative guests. Hosts might entertain guests—not always very successfully. Seneca knew a freedman Calvisius Sabinus who paid his slaves to memorize the works of Hesiod and Homer, but he bored the guests by repeating half-forgotten lines learned from the slaves. The physical layout of spaces that are used for dining affect ability for communication as well as indicate relationships within a society. Hence, the couch and the position of the diners were very important. The Roman historian Livy (History 39.6) indicated that a number of foreign customs came to Rome from Asia Minor, and that the triumph of the Roman General Gnaeus Manlius Vulso in 187 B.C. over the Galatians intensified this custom when he brought booty back to Rome; luxuries such as couches, precious hangings, furniture, gold and silver vessels, and even cooks who specialized in a variety of culinary activities. The couches seem to have been the first triclinia couches to be used in Rome, but the custom of reclining almost certainly came from Greece. There were usually three couches, one placed on each of three sides of a small table. Each couch had places for three people, although couches placed in a semicircle were not unknown. The fourth side was left free for the slaves to place food on the table or to allow guests to watch any entertainment. Larger banquets and feasts would replicate this arrangement. The middle couch (summus) was for the most important guests; the middle place (imus in medio) was reserved for the guest of honor. The next important guest was placed at the nearest corner to the middle table on the righthand table. If a consul or an important dignitary was present, who might have to receive an urgent message, he sat to the right of the important guest so that he could easily be reached. The host sat next to him at the corner of the left-hand table ready to issue orders to servants. Presumably this arrangement, which meant that a diner was placed diagonally, almost in the lap of his neighbor, was part of a networking society. The Romans adopted the custom of reclining while eating from the practice of symposium, in which men in Ancient Greece gathered together to eat, drink, and talk, while reclining on couches. It’s possible that the Romans developed this custom around the third century B.C., when they came into contact with the Greeks of southern Italy, although the Etruscans had also adopted the custom. Adult males stretched out on couches, leaning on their left elbows and eating with their right hands. Boys might recline when they assumed the toga virilis, the toga of manhood, usually by the age of 16 or 17 but the privilege also implied that, as they had reached full citizenship, they had to restrain their teenage passions and submit to guidance in the rules of dining. Plutarch in his Moralia (679e – 680b) attempted to answer a question about the possible squashing together of diners on couches. He suggested that diners first lay flat on their stomachs to allow the right hand to reach for the food. When they had taken the food, they lay on their sides to give their neighbors more room. Probably people were so used to this way of dining that they thought nothing to it. If there were any discomfort, it would be worth it for a good meal.\n\nAncient Rome Slaves were permitted to recline during the festival of Saturnalia when roles were reversed and slaves were masters for that festival. Columella (active A.D. 60 – 65), who wrote a treatise on farming, De Re Rustica, advised that a bailiff should encourage farm workers to take meals with him in his house, but he should not recline except on feast days. Reclining meant total relaxation of the body. Sitting—a posture halfway between lying and standing—is only semi-relaxing. The Roman statesman and moralist Cato (234–149 B.C.) showed his stoicism by sitting at table and reclining only to sleep. Martial despised Maximus Syriscus not only for dissipating his fortune of 10 million sesterces but also for sitting on tavern stools and not reclining while he ate and talked. Lucian, a second-century A.D. prose essayist, was positive that the ability to imbibe while reclining distinguished a man from a beast and a gentleman from a slave. It is possible that Lucian included barbarians in this for on tombstones found in the northern empire people are portrayed sitting in chairs or on stools round tables on which a meal is laid. This seems to have been a custom adopted by Romano-Gallic or Romano-British people. Dining was the prerogative of social equals. Freeborn Romans did not dine with slaves. Slaves served guests. Slaves approached guests with bowls of water and napkins as soon as the guests entered the room and between courses; in an extravagant gesture slaves could offer the guests wine for washing. They could serve the food, press the guests to food and drink, anoint their feet, and spread coverlets. By the late empire handsome youths with long flowing hair were preferred, especially to pour out wine, and these “luckless boys,” as Seneca (Epistolae Morales 95.24, 47.5–8) said, had to “suffer shameful treatment” after a banquet was over. He also mentioned slaves standing silently while their masters dined: “When we recline at a banquet, one slave mops up the disgorged food, another crouches beneath the table and gathers the leftovers of the drunken guests. Another carves priceless game birds, and this is his only job.” At the end of the meal slaves had the right to consume leftover food and drink if they still had the stomach for this. A mosaic, now in the Vatican Museums and dated to the second century A.D. shows food debris lying on the ground—fish and chicken bones, seafood shells, lobster claws, fruits, and nuts at which a mouse is gnawing. Most guests dropped food on the floor expecting the slave to clear the debris; dregs of wine and vomit would not be unexpected. The sordid debris portrayed was probably depicted to amuse the guests but it was a reminder to the slaves that they must clean the floor after a meal or be punished. All slaves served their master warily as they did not know what could happen to them if they did not. Minor punishments were given for dropping a cup or spilling food; more brutal punishments were not unknown. One slave at a dinner given by the Emperor Caligula stole a silver plate. He had his hands cut off and was forced to parade among the guests with a placard round his neck proclaiming his offense. Emperors, in a custom copied by the wealthy, used a slave called a vocatur to watch the guests\n\n21\n\n22\n\nAncient Rome\n\nfor their behavior. Unseemly behavior would ensure that they were not invited again. This man also checked what the guests were eating so that he could tell the emperor which food was liked by a guest so that he could be served it again or even which food he disliked so that he could be humiliated and forced to eat it next time. A vocatur was in charge of issuing invitations and allocating place sittings. This laid him open to bribery. One wealthy provincial secured an invitation to one of Caligula’s dinners by paying a vocatur 2,000 gold pieces. Such moneys made certain slaves very wealthy allowing them to progress in their careers, buying their freedom, and becoming freedmen. The majority were men, although women servants or slaves wearing long dresses appear in banqueting scenes on sarcophagi. A tombstone of M. Ulpius Phaedimus, who died in Rome aged 28, and was a freedman of Trajan, records his career. He began as a server of drinks, moved on to become a tricliniarch, an organizer of feasts, before being chosen to carve roasts and fowls for state banquets. In the early days of the Republic the Romans had a pride in self-reliance and frugality; eating and drinking was on a small or frugal scale. After the conquest of Sicily in 241 B.C., the Romans could indulge in the more exotic tastes of the Near Eastern regions. Public dinners now became fashionable. The term epulum, given to a Roman feast, was first a meal associated with some religious function such as the Ludi Romani, which included a feast in honor of Jupiter. In time its religious connotation diminished, and the term became associated with any opulent meal provided by a man, and occasionally by a woman, for friends or for the public. Another public feast, called a convivium, in its simplest form was based on the symposium of the Greeks although it could follow the symposium pattern. It was a meal for friends, held outside a household, and was intended both to express a relationship between equals as well as be an opportunity for patrons to entertain clients and show off their wealth. Freedmen and slaves were not admitted but they could eat together in guild (collegium) dinners. Joining a guild protected these men, who had no family ties, provided like company for entertainment, and ensured that they would be given a decent funeral with the correct rites. In Gabii, decurions and members of the priestly college of the Severi Augustales banqueted in public on their separate triclinia. Collegia buildings have been identified at Pompeii and Ostia. One building at Ostia founded in the reign of Hadrian seems to have been the collegium of the carpenters ( fabri tignuarii). A central court, surrounded by rooms, is extended by a wing containing four triclinia with masonry couches, was almost certainly the dining area. A story by the historian Livy shows both the power of a guild and a guild’s overall love of the good things in life. In 312 B.C. the censors forbid the guild of flute players from holding these regular feasts, probably because they were too rowdy. The guild promptly went on strike and decamped to Tibur. The Romans tried to entice them back, to no avail, but the Tibertines knew the weakness of the members. They plied the players with drink until\n\nAncient Rome they were intoxicated and fell asleep, packed them into carts, and sent them back to Rome. The flute players congregated in the Forum, but their appalling hangovers soon drove them home. Cicero wrote that Cato the Elder praised the early Romans for choosing the term convivium (con-vivere) to describe the relaxing and reclining of friends at feasts as it implies “a communion of life which is a better designation than that of the Greeks who call it sometimes a drinking together (symposium) or an eating together (syndeipon).” Cicero said that he enjoyed even an afternoon banquet—that is, one that began early and cut short business days—possibly the modern equivalent of the long lunch. In time the terms epulum and convivium both eventually came to mean large public feasts in a variety of contexts, for feeding and entertaining many more people than simply friends of the host. Some Romans might invite guests after a public feast to come to their own home. The Roman general Sulla (c. 138–78 B.C.) often followed a dinner with a drinking party in his own house where dancers and musicians entertained the guests. Women and children did not take part in dinners but women sometimes were allowed to join the convivium and could recline on couches together, although this was unusual. They could give elaborate dinner parties and even feasts for other women. There was still a gender problem. In 7 B.C. Livia, the wife of Augustus, wanted to entertain both senators and the wives of senators together but her son Tiberius objected, as this might be considered unseemly. She had to entertain the wives while her son Tiberius entertained the senators at a dinner in the portico of Livia. Unexpected guests posed another kind of problem. In 45 B.C. Cicero wrote to Atticus (Letters to Atticus 13.5 [353]) that he had been asked to entertain Julius Caesar after he had stopped overnight at Philippus place on his route from Pozzuoli. Unfortunately this included all Caesar’s retinue, who had to be put in three dining rooms. Caesar also brought with him 2,000 soldiers, although Cicero probably did not have to feed these men. Caesar had a bath, oiled his body, and came to dinner. As he was “following a course of emetics,” he was able to partake of “a fine well appointed meal” and he indicated that he had dined well. Cicero provided his guests with all they had wanted and boasted that “I showed that I knew how to live.” He added wryly that “they were not the kind of person to whom one says, ‘Do come again when you are next in the neighbourhood.’ Once is enough.” He added hastily, “it was a visit or should I call it a billeting, which was troublesome to me but not disagreeable.” Private banquets became notorious for their ostentation in entertainment. In the first century B.C., the soldier and administrator Lucius Lucullus’s extravagance became notorious. Once when Caesar and Pompey met him in the forum, Lucullus invited them to dinner. They said they would dine with him that day, but they would not allow him to give notice to his servants, hoping that he would be forced to give them a simple meal. Lucullus outwitted them, for he merely told his servants he would dine with\n\n23\n\n24\n\nAncient Rome\n\nthem “in Apollo.” Each of his dining rooms had fixed allowance for dinners and in Apollo was served the most costly of foods. A banquet was therefore ready when the two guests came to dine. Such extravagance was satirized by one of the most famous accounts of a banquet. Titus Petronius, the presumed author of the Satyricon, who lived a life of notorious idleness, was attached to Nero’s court, probably in the 60s A.D. The Roman historian Tacitus records that when Petronius fell out of favor with the emperor in A.D. 66, he attempted to commit suicide by slitting his veins. He then bound them up, talked with his friends, had a good dinner, and slept for a while so that his death should appear natural, then resigned himself to death. His major work, The Satyricon, is a satirical work that records an extravagant, vulgar banquet given by Trimalchio, with its seven courses of 62 items, some served with Falernian wine said to be a hundred years old. Tricks included the outpouring of sausages and blood puddings when a pig’s belly was slit, and out of a boar’s slit belly, thrushes flew and were caught by fowlers and then cooked for the guests. Public feasts and banquets, often on a lavish scale, were intended to be a public affirmation of power and wealth. They were held by magistrates before elections and by family members to commiserate deaths or to celebrate birthdays. Status mattered. Cocceia Vera from Cura allocated money for a feast to be held in public on her birthday; the guests were arranged strictly in order of status. Decurions were placed on 10 triclinia, seviri were seated on two or more, and so on, thus reflecting the social spectrum. According to an inscription in Corfinium, a donor left a legacy to set up a carefully delineated fund for both the city council and the populace with the interest to provide a feast to remember him on the anniversary of his birthday. Decurions and their children got 30 sesterces each for a feast where they reclined. The Severi Augustales got 20 sesterces each and the plebeians 8 sesterces each for a dinner. The different choice of words indicates the different ranks of society. Only the decurions reclined; the rest sat. The seating arrangements indicate the privileged setting and the reinforcement of a social hierarchy. Generals held feasts for their troops after battles, senators fed their clients, and decurions and aediles entertained fellow citizens or their peers or gave public banquets to secure votes. Distinguished citizens also provided feasts for the populace. To take part in the festivities was to acknowledge, whether consciously or not, the superior power of the provider as well as the achievement of a collective identity. The three-day festival of the Arval Brethren, a high status brotherhood in Rome, made sacrificial offerings to the Dea Diva. After a libation had been made to the deity, the president of the brethren ate, followed by other members in order of status. On the third day slaves and freedmen were allowed to eat, but they were provided with good white bread instead of meat. In Rome generals and senators were expected to provide feasts. In 45 B.C. Julius Caesar gave a feast with 22,000 dining couches. Allowing three people to a couch, this would mean 66,000 people were feasted.\n\nAncient Rome Crassus in 70 B.C. held a feast for 10,000 tables of people after a sacrifice to Hercules and gave each person an additional allowance of grain for three months. In 74 B.C. Lucullus drove King Mithridates out of Bithynia and accounting this a triumph he gave a banquet for the senate and provided sacrificial feasts for the people, which included 1,000,000 jars of Greek wine, probably equivalent to four million liters. Such generosity was not confined to the elite. An inscription at Ostia records that P. Lucilius Gamala gave a feast on 217 dining couches, and on two occasions provided a lunch (prandium) for the coloni. C. Iunius Priscus at Arles gave two days of shows and a wild beast hunt for the citizens, a feast for the decurions on 13 triclinia and another on 34 biclinia for the advocates and other officials. Much of this feasting was linked to fierce competition for both public and private support. Emperors thought that this entertainment was a vital necessity to maintain power. Claudius entertained hundreds of guests and even went so far as to pass an edict allowing flatulence at banquets after he learned that one of his guests was acutely uncomfortable due to modesty. Domitian felt the need to provide entertainments in the Coliseum and the Circus Maximus. One of his most memorable feasts, given in the Coliseum on the Kalends of December A.D. 84, was recorded by the Latin poet Publius Statius. First, slaves handed out white napkins to the crowd. Then fruits were given—plums from Damascus, dates from Pontus and Palestine, figs from Asia Minor, and apples and pears from Amorica—all luxurious items. Pastries included some in the shape of human figures. Flamingoes, pheasants, and guinea fowl were tossed into the crowd for people to take home. Wine flowed freely, and the crowd was entertained by troops of dancing Lydian ladies and Syrians, and by gladiatorial fights, that included several by pigmies. The Emperor Caligula’s banquets were welcomed for their opulence but feared for what could happen, as he loved playing cruel jokes, especially reversal of roles where senators were stripped of their togas and dressed as slaves, then made to wait at table. On one occasion in A.D. 40, Caligula suddenly burst out laughing. The two consuls present nervously asked the reason for his mirth. Caligula replied that this was because he had just thought he could have had their throats slit before they had finished the meal. Both private and public dining was clearly appreciated, especially the latter. The first-century A.D. compiler of anecdotes, Valerius Maximus (Facta et Dictu Memorabilia 7.5), noted the hypocrisy: “For while the people approved of private frugality, publicly they set more store by an handsome show.” Seneca argued that the Roman people loathed private luxury, especially extravagant banquets, but they loved public splendor and expected some share in it. Cicero claimed that Cato the Elder disapproved of feasts, not surprisingly indicating that feasts could be seen as bribery to promote goodwill by providing food. Not all political intentions got results. Quintus Aelius Tubero was asked by his cousin Quintus Fabius Maximus to organize a funerary banquet for the people of Rome on the death of his uncle, Scipio Aemilius. Tubero, however, was a stoic who disapproved of extravagant\n\n25\n\n26\n\nAncient Rome\n\nentertainment. He therefore covered the couches with shabby goatskins and served food in poor Samian ware, which was declared by the people to be more appropriate for the death of Diogenes the Cynic than to honor the death of the mighty Africanus. The result was that Tubero was defeated when he stood for the office of praetor in the next election. The Romans extended the concept of feasting to the world of the dead. There were three aspects to this: meals provided for the dead and the mourners, meals provided to sustain the dead in the tomb, and food necessary to sustain the dead on the journey to the afterlife and in the afterlife. This applied both to burials and cremations. The funerary cult was based as much on fear as on piety, for it was believed that the dead were prone to resentment, even vengeance, if they felt they were neglected. To forestall this, the correct rites had to be carried out. In these rites food played an important part. Once the deceased had been cremated or placed in the tomb, a libation of wine to the Manes (spirits of the dead) was poured out. Offerings of food were taken at the tomb to be eaten in a funerary meal (silicernium) by members of the family. Sometimes poor strangers waited close to the tombs to partake of the feast after the mourners had departed, even though this was considered sacrilege. The period of mourning included purification ceremonies and meals, sometimes elaborate, eaten at the graveside, nine days after the funeral and then on personal anniversaries, such as birthdays, and annual festivals when the dead were commemorated. These celebrations had a dual purpose, ensuring that memories of the dead survived in the minds of friends and relations, and reassuring the dead that they were not forgotten by inclusion in the refreshment provided. Often money would be left in a will for the necessary food and drink—bread, cakes, meat, fruit, and wine. The Parentalia, held February 13 to 21, was the feast of parents and kinsfolk, when the dead were appeased by feasts and food offerings, including a family meal eaten at the grave. The Parentalia ended in the public festival of the Feralia, when the Manes (the spirits of the dead) were honored. The Lemuria, held on May 9, 11, and 13, was when hungry ghosts, the Lemures and the more dangerous Larvae (malevolent ghosts and evil spirits of the dead), gathered round the house. Meals were prepared for the ghosts. At midnight, the head of the family washed his hands in clean water and threw away black beans, while keeping his face averted, saying nine times: “These I cast, with these I redeem me and mine.” As he made his way out of the house, touching water on his route, the ghosts were believed to pick up and eat the beans. On anniversaries, relations and friends ate commemorative meals at the tomb, with a share provided for the dead person. The fact that it was not eaten did not mean that the dead spirit was not partaking of its share; it would be nourished either within its bones or its ashes. To prepare such meals, kitchens were sometimes provided at mausolea so that the food might be as elaborate as when eaten by the deceased when alive. Kitchens can be seen attached to certain tombs at Isola Sacra, the cemetery attached to Ostia,\n\nAncient Rome\n\nTombstone of Druisius with the representation of a funeral banquet, A.D. 80.

Meals shared at the tomb with the dead might not be enough to satisfy them. The tomb was the home for the dead, where they would expect all that they had had in life and food replenished their energies. Nourishment was provided by food placed within the tomb at the moment of interment or on the funeral pyre. Future nourishment from the human world came in the forms of food placed in tombs, and libations and burnt offerings at the tomb. These burnt offerings liberated the spirit of the food so that it passed to the dead. Libations could be delivered through pipes. For poorer people this meant the mouth of a flagon protruding above the ground\n\n27\n\n28\n\nAncient Rome\n\nserving both as a grave marker and an entrance for liquid nourishment. These can still be seen in situ at the Isola Sacra cemetery at Ostia. The funerary feast seems to have extended throughout the empire. In the catacombs of Kom el-Shuqqafa at Alexandria, Egypt, dating from the second century A.D., the dead were interred in a vast necropolis, reached by a spiral staircase, descending to a depth of 35 meters. A triclinium with three stone benches was provided, where meals could be eaten before the dead persons underwent the ritual Egyptian custom of evisceration and mummification, the processes of which are graphically represented on the wall of the principal tomb. When the catacombs were first excavated, wine amphora and tableware were found on a central wooden table in the triclinium. The premise of a tomb as an eternal home was constant in the Roman world. Trimalchio declared the importance of decorating one’s tomb carefully: “It is wrong to look after the house in which you live and to neglect the house in which you will stay much longer” (Petronius, Satyricon 71). Containers for ashes were placed in urns shaped as houses. The elaborate tombs at Ostia and those south of Rome, along the Via Latina near to its convergence with the Via Appia Nuova, are large square buildings, which take the form of rectangular houses. Some of the buildings have an underground burial chamber surmounted by a two-story building. Funerary gardens were also created round tombs where meals could be eaten. Trimalchio, who would have expected a funerary banquet on a grand scale, when giving directions for his future tomb, said that he would like to have an orchard with “various kinds of fruit growing round my ashes and plenty of vines” (Petronius, Satyricon 71). This concept can be seen in the Roman belief that the Elysium Fields were regarded as an idyllic landscape with abundant flowers and heavenly banquets. Some tombstones show the Totenmahl or funerary banquet. The deceased lies on a couch, holding out a cup as if to toast the living. A small three-legged table is in front, on which rests food. Such tombstones were popular in the Rhineland and Eastern Gaul. On one of the finest tombstones at Cologne, Germany, Gaius Julius Maternus, veteran of Legion I Minervia, reclines on a high-backed couch, with a pet dog at his feet. He raises a cup in his right hand and holds a serviette in his left. A meal of fruit and bread is set on a three-legged table covered with a fringed cloth. A banquet indeed for those who are about to enter the afterlife. Servants stand to left and right to wait on him. His wife, Maria Marcellina, seated in her basket chair, holds a bowl with more fruit. The dead expected to be nourished by these meals. Even so, none could escape the implacable reality that the pleasures of eating and drinking were ephemeral. Titus Flaminius, soldier of Legion XIV Gemina, on his tombstone in Britain at Wroxeter, Shropshire, was uncompromising: “I did my service and now I am here. Read this and be either more or less fortunate in your lifetime. The gods prohibit you from the wine-grape and water when you enter Tartarus” (Collingwood and Wright no 292).\n\nAnniversary Parties Further Reading: Alcock, Joan P. “The Funerary Meal in the Cult of the Dead in Classical Roman Religion.” In Harlan Walker (ed).

Alcock\n\nAnniversary Parties Anthropologists believe that early marriage was characterized by the capture of young women while out gathering food for their tribes or clans. Since tribes and clans were groups of extended family, a woman’s friends were often siblings, cousins, and other kin. A woman would be seized by a man from another tribe or clan who was assisted by his kinsmen while the other young women ran back to the village to get help from their fathers, brothers, and other male family members. Meanwhile the young woman and her captor would be in hiding until the search for her was terminated and, according to legend, the bride would be presented with a ring composed of braided grass that denoted her “taken” status. This period of hiding out usually lasted 30 days or one full cycle of the moon during which the new couple drank wine with honey and, at the end, the new bride was usually with child. From this initial explanation one can see the origins of brides, grooms, the bridal party, and the wedding band, in addition to the honeymoon. In time, this form of marriage by capture was replaced with a form of bartering for wives. Men and their brothers would approach fathers with\n\n29\n\n30\n\nAnniversary Parties\n\ndaughters from neighboring clans or tribes to negotiate the exchange of goods for a bride. The price a groom would pay to the father of a woman to make her his wife was called bridewealth or wed and is considered the root from which the term wedding originates. This exchange of goods or wealth was to serve as compensation for the father who was losing a household worker rather than gaining a son-in-law; it is hypothesized that this concept of the father having to give up the labor contribution of his daughter is the orig"
