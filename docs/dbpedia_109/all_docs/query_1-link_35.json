Beginning March 1, 2018, new buckets in US East (N. Virginia) must conform to the same rules applied in all other Regions.\n\nWhen you create a directory bucket by using the console a suffix is automatically added to the base name that you provide. This suffix includes the Availability Zone ID of the Availability Zone that you chose.\n\nWhen you create a directory bucket by using an API you must provide the full suffix, including the Availability Zone ID, in your request. For a list of Availability Zone IDs, see S3 Express One Zone Availability Zones and Regions."
