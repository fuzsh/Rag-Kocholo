        "text": "What Conrad said is correct. nbps is to keep two words together in case of line breaks causing your design to lose balance. You'll see this when you take the Web Typography course.\n\n%20 will not keep two words together, and is probably not used the same way as character codes like & are (ampersand).\n\n%20 is used in URLs as part of its' POST or GET content (I'll have to do some review on PHP or jQuery).\n\nwhat that means, is that the syntax %20 is used in a web address to portray a \"space\" to the data being submitted to the back-end.\n\nI'm not sure there is an HTML entity for a standard space (we're talking front-end content in the HTML file's body) because spaces get depicted correctly without interrupting code.\n\nSo, use spaces as much as you want, but if you run into an issue where one or two words are breaking the flow of the site when it's lowered in screen size, and you want to break the whole title/header/sentence some other way, you can use &nbps; at the location you want so the site knows where to break the content to another line.\n\nA quick brown fox jumps&nbps; over the lazy dog\n\nThe example above will show up like \"A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\nbut when the screen gets too small it will say:\n\nA quick brown fox jumps\n\nOver the lazy dog\n\nINSTEAD of\n\nA quick brown fox jumps over the lazy\n\ndog\n\nI hope this helps!"
