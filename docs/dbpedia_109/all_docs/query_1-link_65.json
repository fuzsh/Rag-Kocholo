        "text": "With modern day systems, are we able to use hostnames longer than 15 characters yet?\n\nFor example, our environment runs only on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 7 and Windows 10 workstations.\n\nThe hostname convention we use is currently 14 characters, except we’d like to revise this to support 17. The reason for this is to separate the types of web and app servers we use. So a cluster of web servers for our wordpress could be WRPWEB01 - WRPWEB09 and a cluster of joomla web servers could be JOOWEB01-JOOWEB09. We currently have WEB01-20 and they are mixed between WP and Joomla and it’s harder to differentiate between the two. We could separate them further apart, but as we grow our cluster it becomes scattered again.\n\nWe currently use 3 character company, 3 character location, 3 character role, 2 digits for numbering, and we use the last few if they are DR, Cluster, etc.\n\nHowever when you have web01, web02, web03, web04, etc and they run different web software it’s hard to know what’s what. Having an extra 3 characters to say this does CMS, this does something else, etc would help.\n\nSo you already have good naming convention - so my suggestion would be instead of using in character role word Web, to put primary role.\n\nIn your sample if your company only has web based CMS, then just replace word Web with CMS01, CMS02… etc.\n\nWith this server is identified by its predominant role and still you that it is a web server.\n\nYou can also use last 4 in different way - like 1-2 for role (C - CMS, E - ERP, etc.) and 2-3 for DR, Cluster (like C2 or CW2), so it all fits into 15 chars.\n\nWhy I am so on side of having up to 15 is that majority of application will be optimized in their base libraries to work best with known naming standards at development start point. In order to avoid being genuine pig for SW vendor, play safe and save your free time for fishing, hiking, biking … whatever you like doing\n\nI like brevity, so I may be in the minority. Specifying ‘web’ and ‘wp’ or ‘joomla’ is kind of redundant, as is having ‘server’ as part of the name. Personally, I’d keep it super simple. Using Chicago as an example, chjm001, chjm002, chwp001, chwp002. But this is coming from a guy who names his workstations by phone extension (i.e. ch1215), so take it with a grain of salt. Sorts nice in a network view, report, or spreadsheet though.\n\nch1215\n\nch1216\n\nchjm001\n\nchjm002\n\nchwp001\n\nchwp002"
