        "text": "LaTeX inside BibTeX\n\nBibTeX allows some LaTeX-commands to be used inside of tags. For instance, \\emph, \\texttt, \\LaTeX or \\verb could be inserted, being later processed for proper depiction inside the final document.\n\nMathmode\n\nSome people use the LaTeX-mathmode inside of BibTeX tags for various reasons. Some wish for a numeration like 2nd and 3rd for instance to describe\n\n,,The 20th annual meeting of BibTeX-users''.\n\nTitle = \"The $20^{th}$ annual meeting of {BibTeX}--users\"\n\nText enclosed in braces\n\nText that is enclosed in braces is marked not to be touched by any formating instructions. For instance, when a style defines the title to become depicted using only lowercase, italic letters, the enclosed part will be left untouched. \"An Introduction To {BibTeX}\" would become ,,an introduction to the BibTeX'' when such a style is applied. Nested braces are ignored.\n\nSpecial Symbols and escapes\n\nLaTeX provides means to describe special characters like accents or umlauts using a special notation, which can be used just the same inside of BibTeX Entries.\n\nAs well as these accents, some characters can not be put directly into a BibTeX-entry, as they would conflict with the format description, like {, \" or $. They need to be escaped using a backslash (\\)."
