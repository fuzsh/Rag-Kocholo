        "text": "You can use the backslash (\\) to escape characters like the colon.\n\nIn your example, then, you can use the format # \\: 1.\n\nOddly, a format like # \\: # splits up a number to display a number of digits to the right of the colon equal to the number of hash marks to the right, with the rest of the digits to the left. Some examples with the number 44.5:\n\n# \\: # displays '44 : 5' # \\: ## displays '4 : 45'\n\nIf the number were 445 instead of 44.5, you would get exactly the same results. It's also possible to substitute question marks (?) for the #'s and get the same outcome.\n\nI'm not sure if this will work in general, but for the example format, you can use the following instead.\n\n# : \"1\"\n\nFrom playing around with this format, it seems the colon is not so much the issue as what follows the colon is. Text is okay, but numbers are not, apparently."
