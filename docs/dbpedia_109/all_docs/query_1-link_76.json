        "text": "Use unicode to add special characters to your site’s text.\n\nUnicode is a standardized character-encoding format supported by most computers and browsers. You can use Unicode to add special characters to your site, like math symbols or different languages. You can also add extra design elements, like arrows, carets, and other icons.\n\nFor example, the Harris template's demo content includes Unicode caret and telephone symbols:\n\nBefore you begin\n\nWhile Unicode is widely used and supported, there's a chance some visitors may access your site from a device or browser that doesn't display Unicode. These visitors would see a box, question mark, or another symbol in place of the special character.\n\nFor this reason, we suggest using special characters strategically, so your meaning is clear even if the character is missing.\n\nNote: Adding Unicode is an advanced modification that falls outside of the scope of Squarespace support.\n\nStep 1 - Copy a character\n\nYou can find symbols in many places on the web. Here are a few resources:\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters\n\nwww.alt-codes.net\n\ntext-symbols.com\n\nwww.i2symbol.com/symbols\n\nTip: Here are symbols used in our demo content: ☎ ➤ → ©\n\nWhen you find a character to use, highlight and copy the symbol (Ctrl + C or ⌘ + C) as if it were regular text.\n\nStep 2 - Paste it into your site\n\nYou can paste Unicode anywhere on your site that supports text, including text blocks, the site title, banner text, and image captions.\n\nWhen you paste the symbol, ensure you paste it as plain text. You can use these keyboard shortcuts:\n\nMac - ⌘ + Shift + V\n\nPC - Ctrl + Shift + V\n\nUsually, the character takes the same style as that text area. For example, if you add it as normal text in a text block, it will follow your template's body font style settings."
