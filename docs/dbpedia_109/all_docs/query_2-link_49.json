For example, the characters of column, , are allocated to \"1\" key, and the characters of column, to \"2\" key.\n\nthe characters of columns are allocated to \"3, 4, â¢ â¢ â¢ \" keys, respectively.\n\nthe common way to enter Japanese texts using such a conventional Japanese keypad is through the multi-tap method.\n\nFig. Ib shows a keypad of a cellular telephone according to an international standard for entering English texts. The 26 characters are allocated to 10 keys. The common way to enter English texts using such a conventional English keypad is also through the multi-tap method.\n\nFig. Ic shows a keypad of cellular telephone in which Hebraic alphabet is allocated to 10 keys so that a user can enter Hebraic characters.\n\nFig. Id shows a keypad of cellular telephone in which Thai alphabet is allocated to 10 keys so that a user can enter Thai characters.\n\nFig. Ie shows a keypad of cellular telephone in which strokes are allocated to 10 keys so that a user can enter simplified Chinese characters.\n\nFig. If shows a keypad of cellular telephone in which Bopomofo symbols are allocated to 10 keys so that a user can enter traditional Chinese characters.\n\nFig. Ig shows a keypad of cellular telephone in which Korean alphabet is allocated to 10 keys so that a user can enter Korean characters.\n\nthe multi-tap method is very cumbersome and can cause a user to make mistakes on the character entry since groups of multiple letters are allocated on a limited number of keys and multiple letters are overlaid on each of these keys.\n\na single-tap method As a single-tap method, there are disclosed T9 (http:// www.t9.com), eZi (http://www.zicorp.com), itap (http://www.mot.com/lexicus/html/itap.html), and for entering Japanese texts, POS (http://www.muchy.com).\n\nT9 http:// www.t9.com\n\neZi http://www.zicorp.com\n\nitap http://www.mot.com/lexicus/html/itap.html\n\nPOS http://www.muchy.com\n\nOne feature of these methods is one tap (key press) for one letter.\n\nFig. Ih shows an embodiment according to the eZi method.\n\nthe most important difference between the single-tap and the multi-tap method is related to whether or not to use a given dictionary for a given language.\n\nthe single-tap method is based on an algorithm, which displays automatically the corresponding words after searching a given dictionary for a given language for combinations of the entered characters. For example of the eZi method, if a user want to enter \"boy\", he/she presses \"1\" key having letters \"ABCâ imprinted thereon for entering \"b\", \"6\" key for entering \"o\", and \"9â key for entering \"yâ.\n\nFig. Ii shows the POS system, which is a Japanese language calculation- input system according to the single-tap method. The algorithm is the same with the above-mentioned one.\n\nthe single-tap method instead of the multi-tap method, in order to seek the efficiency of character entry by allocating multiple letters to a limited number of keys of a small keypad.\n\nthe single-tap method pursues the efficiency of character entry through the reduced number of times of key presses and an accuracy of character entry.\n\nthe basic way to access a letter is a multi-tap method under the circumstances.\n\nthe multi-tap method needs lots of key presses and has high possibility that a user may make mistakes on the character entry.\n\nthe single-tap method can reduce the number of times of key presses, but has to establish a given dictionary for a given language in the system and to register new words continuously, such as vocabularies newly created by a user and abbreviations, in the dictionary.\n\nthe single-tap method as a one-key-for-one-letter way has limitations and disadvantages which give the system high load due to lots of character combinations according to the entered multiple letters and dictionary-searching according to the character combinations.\n\nthe present invention is directed to a character entry method to ensure the efficiency of letter entry, the expandability and adaptability of information services, and the information and communication service method thereby, which substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the multi-tap and single-tap method.\n\nthe distinctive features of the present invention are representative character keys, a virtual keypad, and virtual key entry method on the virtual keypad mode, in entering multiple characters by means of a keypad with about 12 keys. That is, the present invention provides a method for character entry that the desired character can be entered separately on each of a real keypad entry mode and a virtual keypad entry mode according to the prescribed way although the identical key is pressed in each of both modes, by establishing separately the entry mode of a virtual keypad that maintains the state of an independent entry mode regardless of the entry mode of a real keypad and the key presses on a real keypad.\n\nFig. Ia shows a Japanese character layout of a keypad of a cellular telephone, as a de facto Japanese standard\n\nFig. Ib shows an alphabet layout of a keypad of a cellular telephone, as the international standard\n\nFig. Ic shows a Hebraic character layout of a keypad of a cellular telephone, as a de facto standard\n\nFig. Id shows a Thai character layout of a keypad of a cellular telephone\n\nFig. Ie shows a stroke layout of a keypad of a cellular telephone for entering Chinese characters\n\nFig. If shows a Bopomofo symbol layout of a keypad of a cellular telephone for entering Chinese characters\n\nFig. Ig shows a Korean alphabet layout of a keypad of a cellular telephone\n\nFig. Ih illustrates an embodiment according to the eZi method as a single- tap method\n\nFig. Ii illustrates an embodiment for entering Japanese characters in accordance with the POS system\n\nFig. 2 illustrates a flow chart of Method 1 in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 3 illustrates a flow chart of Method 2 in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 4 illustrates a flow chart of Method 3 in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 5 illustrates a flow chart of Method 4 in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 6 illustrates an example of English text entry according to the Method\n\nFig. 7 illustrates a key layout of a virtual keypad according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention\n\nFig. 8 illustrates a depiction of a cellular telephone having a keypad for Russian character entry in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 9 illustrates a depiction of a cellular telephone having a keypad for Arabic character entry in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 10 illustrates a depiction of a cellular telephone having a keypad for Hebraic character entry in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 11 illustrates a depiction of a cellular telephone having a keypad for\n\nFig. 12 illustrates a depiction of a cellular telephone having a keypad for Devanagari character entry in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 13 illustrates a depiction of a cellular telephone having a keypad for Chinese character entry in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 14 illustrates a depiction of a cellular telephone having a keypad for Korean language entry in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 15 illustrates an example of alphabet entry on a PDA in accordance with the present invention\n\nFig. 16 illustrates an example of an information service method using the preferred embodiment of the present invention\n\nFig. 17 illustrates an example of URL entry using the preferred embodiment of the present invention.\n\ncharacters of a given language are grouped according to a particular criterion.\n\nâparticular criterionâ includes the order of characters, the identical phonetic value of characters, the same shape of characters, the similar grammatical characteristics of characters, the visibility and recognizability of users, and so on.\n\nthe number of characters in a group is preferably 5 â 12, because it is suitable for allocating the groups of characters to a small keypad having about 12 keys in number and can be handled easily.\n\nrepresentative characters are selected from characters of a group.\n\nthe number of the representative characters in a group is preferably no more than three, because the representative characters in a group are marked on a small key and the visibility and recognizability for characters by a user is decreased for many representative characters. Therefore, in selecting representative characters, a criterion may include the visibility and recognizability by a user. Subsequently, the representative characters of each group are allocated to about 12 keys on a keypad.\n\nFigs. la â lg illustrate character layouts for entering given languages on information appliances.\n\nFig. 7 shows an entry key layout of a virtual keypad according to the present invention.\n\nFigs. 8 â 14 illustrate examples of key layouts of real keypads for use in information appliances.\n\nFig. Ib is a keypad of the alphabet as an international standard. As shown in Fig. Ib, \"2\" key has letters \"ABCâ imprinted thereon. Each number key has letters imprinted thereon, respectively.\n\nthe alphabet is grouped into sets of 3 letters according to the alphabetical order, and \"Q\" and \"Zâ is allocated to \"1\" key due to the low frequency of use.\n\nthe representative character according the present invention functions as a representative that stands for the characters allotted to the key and as an index key to enter the particular characters of each group, and, more particularly, is used to invoke, select, enter and search the particular characters of each group.\n\nanother feature of the representative character of the present invention is that pressing of the representative character changes a real keypad input mode into a virtual keypad input mode.\n\nFig. 2 illustrates a flow chart of a character entry method after grouping characters, designating representative characters for each group and allocating the representative characters to a limited number of keys, as an embodiment (hereinafter referred to as \"Method 1\") using the representative character as an index key and a key for the mode change.\n\nMethod 1 an embodiment\n\nthe user recognizes the representative character key to which the desired character belongs. After identifying the representative character key, the user selects and presses the representative key in the phase 3.\n\nthe phases 4.1 and 4.2 are the response results of the system according to the present invention after pressing the representative character key.\n\nthe system displays all the characters allotted to the representative character key, and changes a real keypad input mode into a virtual keypad input mode where the user can select and enter the only characters shown on the display. Subsequently, in phase 6, the user selects and enters the desired character among the displayed characters on the virtual keypad input mode. Here, after the user finishes entering the desired character on the virtual keypad input mode, the system returns to the initial state for entering a character to become the real keypad input mode.\n\nFig. 3 illustrates a flow chart of another embodiment (hereinafter referred to as \"Method 2\") of a method for entering characters according to the present invention.\n\nMethod 1 the basic unit for entering a word is one character\n\nMethod 2 the basic entry unit is multiple characters.\n\na user enters 4â5 characters successively as one task. For example, if the user wants to input \"boy\", he/she recognizes the entire word and understands \"boyâ as an entry unit. In that case, Method 2 is more effective than Method 1.\n\nthe processes of Method 2 are similar to those of Method 1 except that Method 2 needs some additive functions due to entry unit of multiple characters.\n\nMethod 2 includes the process that a set of representative characters entered is stored in an input buffer and the user enters a signal of input completion (or the timer of system is activated by itself).\n\nthe characters allotted to the representative character key for the character entered first are displayed, and the user selects the desired character according to the above-mentioned process on the virtual keypad input mode.\n\nthe system displays the characters allotted to the key including the second representative character which is stored in the input buffer, and waits the user's selection input, maintaining the state of the virtual keypad input mode. This process is repeated automatically until the system identifies the key that denotes the end of a set of characters entered successively. Therefore, Method 2 corrects the inconvenience for the user to press the representative character key for each character, and is a suitable method for the typical users.\n\nMethod 3 shows another preferred embodiment (hereinafter referred to as \"Method 3\") according to the present invention.\n\nMethod 1 and Method 2 have the process in which a user presses representative character keys and the system displays characters allotted to the representative character keys.\n\nMethod 3 is a character entry method that the information of character construction collected from a notation system of each language and characteristic information of the notation system are added to Method 1 and Method 2. The detailed description of Method 3 is presented in the embodiments for establishing a character entry system for each language.\n\nFig. 5 is another preferred embodiment (hereinafter referred to as \"Method\n\nphase 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are similar to Method 1, Method 2 and Method 3, and the phases 5A, 5B and 5 C are added as new functions instead of phase 4 of Method 2, thereby generating the phases 7, 8, 9 and 10.\n\nMethod 4 is a suitable method for entering continuously the character entry unit, as a word or a character string, at one time.\n\nthe system stores the continuously entered representative characters in the system buffer, and, then, produces combinations of characters allotted to the representative characters to store into a table (phases 5 A and 5B).\n\nMethod 4 of the present invention can diminish the number of words, which is presented in the process of word selection, in the early input stage, compared to the single-tap system of the prior art. Therefore, Method 4 does not interrupt the ideation of the user for character entry process and can reduce a stress accompanied with the character entry.\n\nAnother advantage of Method 4 is that in case of entering the words unregistered in a given dictionary, it is more excellent than the existing multi-tap method in respect of input efficiency, input adaptability, and application, because the set of characters entered is inputted.\n\nMethod 4 of the present invention can reduce the number of times of dictionary search and the number of the displayed items, by selecting the first character of the desired word in the early stage to reduce the number of character combinations among the characters belonging to the representative characters. Moreover, with the Method 4, a user can easily enter words or character strings unregistered in a given dictionary.\n\nthe conventional art uses multi-tap method in order to enter words unregistered in a given dictionary.\n\nMethod 1 of the present invention needs six times of key presses\n\nMethod 2 of the present invention needs four times of key presses.\n\nMethod 1 for entering the Latin alphabet is described.\n\ntlie grouping and sets of the Latin alphabetic characters use those on the keypad and key allocation in Fig. Ib, because lots of users are familiar with the character allocation of the keypad in Fig. Ib which is already standardized internationally, and because to group the characters and to designate the representative keys are discretionary.\n\nMethod 1 uses the keypad construction of Fig. Ib. To begin with, the definition table for the representative characters and character elements belonging to the representative characters are required. Also, the representative characters to select the characters belonging to the representative characters on a virtual mode and combination rules of numeral keys or function keys are required. Table Ia shows character elements, representative characters, numeral combination keys, and numeral and function combination keys for use in entering the Latin alphabet\n\nthe representative characters are index keys to stand for the characters that will be entered; and the numeral combination keys and numeral and function combination keys are used as a entry key to select the desired character among characters displayed on the virtual keypad input mode.\n\nthe combination keys used as entry keys on the virtual keypad could be designated in any manner, and each of the combination keys could be altered arbitrarily.\n\nthe entry combination keys of the present invention are selected considering the relations between the representative characters and the, combination keys and convenience of key entry.\n\nTable Ib shows the character elements, the representative characters and entry keys of the virtual keypad for use in entering the Latin alphabet (European characters).\n\nthe representative characters are index keys to stand for the characters that will be entered; and the numeral combination ke3 â s are used as a entry key to select the desired character among characters displayed on the virtual keypad input mode.\n\nthe combination keys that used as entry keys in the virtual keypad could be determined in any manner, and each of the combination keys could be altered arbitrarily.\n\nthe entry combination keys of the present invention are selected considering the relations between the representative characters and combination keys and convenience of key entry. [Table Ib]\n\nthe entry unit is \"good\".\n\nthe user presses \"Gâ, âMâ, âMâ, and âDâ keys, the representative keys that correspond to the word âgood \" , continuously, and then, the entry-confirmation key. As shown in\n\nthe system stores the set of representative characters entered and displays \"G\", \"Hâ and \"I\" belonging to the first representative character \"G\".\n\nthe input mode of the system changes into the virtual keypad input mode.\n\nFig. 6 shows an embodiment of Method 3 according to the present invention.\n\nEnglish has a linguistic characteristic that the constitution of word has a pattern among 'consonant + vowel', 'vowel + consonant', 'vowel + vowel + consonant 3 , and 'consonant + consonant + vowel'.\n\nall the English words have to include one or more vowels essentially.\n\nMethod 3 is a method made by combining these linguistic characteristics to Method 1 or Method 2.\n\nMethod 3 the user enters only consonant elements as entry characters.\n\nthe system as shown in Fig.\n\nthe user can enter efficiently more characters without lowering recognizability and visibility for the displayed characters because the number of characters which the user selects on one virtual keypad input mode increases to about ten.\n\nall the possible words can be displayed and the user can select the desired words among them.\n\nthe English words have formative elements used frequently, such as the ending of a word and the beginning of a word.\n\nthese formative elements have two- character string (e.g., -ch, -sh, -ad, -ac, etc.), three-character string (e.g., -the, -ing, etc.), four-character string (e.g. -tion, etc.), and so on.\n\nthe database which is established with the character strings used frequently, can maximize the entry efficiency with a limited number of keys used.\n\nthe database composed of the endings of words such as '-s% '-ed', '-ing', and '-tion' can be established. If a user selects a particular suffix in the database and enters it, he/she can input many characters with a limited number of key presses. For example, the ending of 'act' can be selected from '-s', '-ed', '-ing', '-ivity', '-ion', and so on. Thus, the database including these suffixes can be established.\n\nthe user enters \"actâ and invokes the suffixes for \"actâ from the database using a function key Io display the possible suffixes.\n\nthe user can select one from these suffixes using a key, and, therefore, he/she can enter all the characters of the suffix through one key entry. Consequently, by including a database composed of these vocabularies into a database of linguistic characteristic information, the input efficiency of English text can be improved considerably.\n\nMethod 3 can be applied to all the languages identically.\n\nMethod 4 The method for entering the word âgoodâ using Method 4 is described.\n\nthe method for entering the word âgoodâ according to Method 4 follows similarly the phases 1 to 5 in Method 2 (Fig. 3) or Method 3 (Fig. 4). Because âgâ is designated and selected at the first character entry, the character combinations such as âgmâ, âgnâ, and âgoâ are formed due to the representative character âMâ of the next character âo\". If the user selects \"o\", \"goâ is finalized and the system finds the \"goâ in the formation table. Subsequently, the system searches a given dictionary using \"goâ as a search key, and displays the words beginning with the \"go\", such as \"goâ and \"good\". Finally, the user selects \"goodâ.\n\nMethod 4 can enter the desired word at the prior step.\n\nthe method for establishing an English dictionary for Method 4 is described.\n\na tree structure is used.\n\nthe constitution of the dictionary according to the present invention also has a tree structure, as shown in Table Ic. [Table Ic]\n\nTable Ic shows an example of an entry character string beginning with \"g\" and \"o\".

As shown in Fig.\n\nthe strokes are allotted to the odd number keys on the keypad; the representative character forms are allotted to the even number keys; and the (radical), as a key standing for the 222 radicals in number, are allotted to the \"#\" key.\n\nthe representative character form key stands for a group composed of similar character forms, like and character forms belonging to each of representative character form keys are disposed according to the priority of the frequency of use. As a result, the means of representative character entry for entering the Chinese characters are the stroke and the character form keys.\n\nthe character form keys of 14 are the means for expressing the relations among the Chinese character groups, radicals, and strokes.\n\na user enters the Chinese character, based on the character knowledge that which radical is used for a given Chinese character in the step of stroke entry. Therefore, if the user enters such character knowledge with the character form keys of 14, he/she can enter easily the Chinese characters through a few times of key presses. In addition, it is possible to carry out the method that he/she enters first the character form and next the stroke.\n\nthe radical is ; the first stroke is ; and the character form is which is allotted to the second order on the numeral key 2. Therefore, the user can find through three times of key entry (i.e., the entry of . In other words, by entering directly the information, which the first stroke of is and the character form is , to the system, the system can search and select rapidly the related Chinese characters and reduce considerably the number of the related\n\nAnother embodiment for entering the Chinese characters is described. To begin with, when the user enters the first stroke of the first component of the desired Chinese character, all the radicals with the stroke are displayed. If the user selects the desired radical from the displayed radicals, all the Chinese characters with the radical are displayed. Next, when the user enters the first stroke of the next component of the desired Chinese character, the system displays all the Chinese characters with the first radical and the stroke. Finally, the user can select the desired Chinese character from the displayed Chinese characters. For example, in case of entering , the user enters the first stroke and . The radical with the character form among the radicals beginning with the first stroke . Therefore, the system displays all the Chinese characters having the radical .\n\nMethod 4 of the present invention is combined with Method 1, Method 2 and Method 3, it is possible to constitute a special dictionary and index file to predict a word composed of particular letters, and improve the existing Chinese character entry system using the conventional methods and arts, considerably.\n\nthe methods for entering the Chinese characters according to the present invention are methods that the concepts of Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 4 are combined compositively.\n\nthe strokes and the character forms are considered as characters for convenience' sake, but it is unconcerned with the nature of present invention.\n\nthe method for entering the Chinese characters according to the present invention is compared with the existing method, \"The symbol definition apparatus\" (US Patent No. 5,187,480, Date of Patent: February 16, 1993, hereinafter referred to as \"T method\").\n\nthe entry means are five or eight strokes. If the user enters these strokes according to the writing order of the Chinese character, the Chinese characters and radicals corresponding to the entered strokes are displayed, and the user selects the desired Chinese from the displayed Chinese characters.\n\nthe displayed Chinese characters are disposed according to the static dictionary structure that disposes the frequently used Chinese characters on the head.\n\nthe entry - means are five strokes and 14 character form keys.\n\nfour kinds of entrymethods are provided basically, i.e., (1) a method using five strokes; (2) a method using five strokes and radicals together; (3) a method using five strokes and character form keys together; and (4) a method using five strokes, radicals, and character form keys together.\n\nthe displayed Chinese characters are , disposed according to the dynamic dictionary structure that disposes preferentially the frequently used Chinese characters on the front position considering the dynamically estimated use frequency. Therefore, the user can choose the entry method in accordance with one's preference. Moreover, the dynamic dictionary structure and the display method can improve the entry speed considerably.\n\nTables 8b and 8c show the entry speed of the method of the present invention and the T method. As shown in Table 8b, in entering randomly the Chinese characters, the method of the present invention can improve the entry speed by about 43%, compared to the T method. In entering the common colloquial sentence, as shown in Table 8c, the method of the present invention can improve the entry speed by about 13%, compared to the T method. [Table 8b]\n\nFig. If shows a Bopomofo symbol layout of a keypad of cellular telephone for entering Chinese characters. The method for entering is described, using Table 9. The Bopomofo notation for\n\nthe pinyin method is a method that the pronunciation of the Chinese characters\n\nChinese characters is represented as the alphabet letters and the desired Chinese characters are entered using the alphabet letters as a basic entry unit.\n\nTable 10a shows the pinyin and the corresponding Chinese character, the four-tone information, and the virtual keypad entry keys.\n\nthe representative character keys and the virtual keypad entry keys are chosen according to the pinyin for each of Chinese characters.\n\nthe input efficiency of the Chinese character is determined by the input efficiency of alphabet letter and the input/output method of the corresponding pinyin character string, because the pinyin notation of Chinese character is identical with a word composed of alphabetic characters.\n\nthe methods for entering the Chinese character pinyin according to Method 1, Method 2, Method 3 and Method 4 are similar with the entry methods of English words according to Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 4.\n\nthe many Chinese characters have identical pronunciation although they are different Chinese characters because of the homophony of the Chinese characters.\n\nthe pinyin character strings have definite rules between the first syllable and the next syllable, and, therefore, the pinyin input efficiency can improved considerably by establishing the preparatory information including these rules.\n\nthe first letter of the pinyin is a consonant\n\nthe next vowel or consonant can be selected from \"A, E 5 I 5 O 5 Uâ and \"N 5 Hâ.\n\nthe letters of the third syllable are arranged according to definite rules,' and, therefore, by predicting and displaying these letter series, the user can select, the desired character.\n\nAnother feature of the pinyin input according to Method 4 is the method for displaying the related Chinese characters corresponding to the pinyin. For example, if the user enters the pinyin \"de for the first time, the system displays the related Chinese characters in the order named. However, if the user enters the pinyin \"de( for the second time, the system displays the related Chinese characters in the previously used order so that the user can select and enter easily the desired Chinese character, thereby reducing the stress accompanied with the selection process.\n\nTable 10b shows the number of times of key presses in case of entering a\n\nTable 11 shows the Korean alphabetic letters, representative character keys, and character selection keys for use in the virtual input mode according to the preferred embodiments of Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 4. [Table 11]\n\nthe definition for the entry of the vowel part consists of only six basic monophthongs, The grouping and the representative character designation for diphthongs, such as are separat _,el i y defined. In the present invention, these diphthongs are formed by the combination of the cardinal vowels of six.\n\nTable 12a shows the rules of the cardinal vowel combination for entering Korean alphabetic vowels according to the present invention.\n\nthe feature of the Korean alphabetic vowel entry using the combination of cardinal vowel keys is that the entry method is appropriate for the structure of the Korean alphabet and takes effects in applying to Method 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 4.\n\narrow symbols corresponds to the functions keys on the cellular telephone.\n\nthe diphthongs such as are formed by the combination of the vowels such as .\n\nthese combination vowels are allotted to each of representative keys.\n\nthe vowels belonging to the representative keys are displayed simultaneously.\n\nthe user selects and enters the one among the displayed vowels. Therefore, the vowel input efficiency can be improved considerably.\n\nthe group of vowels belonging to the representative key such as , are displayed at one tune.\n\nthe user can select and enter the desired vowel among the displayed vowels. Accordingly, the user can reduce the times of entry and enter each of 21 vowels correctly using six vowels allotted to the three keys.\n\nthe Korean alphabetic vowels can be formed by a Cheonjiin(\" â â, â â¢ â, â ] â) method, a prior art.\n\nTable 12b shows an example of method for entering the Korean alphabetic vowels, which applies the present invention to the Cheonjiin method. [Table 12b]\n\nthe plural display and selection keys according to the present invention can solve the problem.\n\nthe above- mentioned keypad constitution and the entry rules work great. Because the vowels are allotted to numeral keys \" 1\", \"2\", and \"3\" without mixing with consonants, the vowels can be always displayed. Therefore, the user can enter the entire word by entering only the consonants of the word. In addition, by adding a Korean dictionary, the entry efficiency can be improved considerably. Now, embodiments for entering the Korean language according to the present invention are described.\n\nthe first consonant of belonging to the representative character When the user presses the numeral key 0 to enter , the system displays and directly. The user can select and enter using the corresponding function key or numeral key. Next, the user presses the numeral key 1 because the vowel belongs to the representative character key . The system displays . When the user select using the corresponding key, the entry of is completed. However, actually, the user used to the Korean alphabet recognizes the word at one time, and enters it continuously at once. Therefore, Method 2 of the present invention can be applied appropriately according to the same entry procedure.\n\nMethod 3 is more efficient.\n\nthe Korean character has definite patterns such as [consonant + vowel], [consonant + vowel + consonant], and so on. These linguistic characteristics are introduced into Method 3. Namely, if the vowels are displayed always on the screen, only the consonant parts are entered and the vowel parts are selected from the vowels displayed.\n\nthe system according to the present invention stores the entered character string in the buffer, and displays and belonging to the representative numeral key of the first alphabet . The user selects and enters using the corresponding key, and, then, the system requires the user to enter a vowel. By selecting and entering the vowel is formed. Next, the system displays the alphabets belonging to the representative key for stored in the buffer. Subsequently, the above-mentioned processes are carried out identically.\n\nMethod 3 changes into Method 4 by adding a Korean wordbook to Method 3.\n\nthe Korean wordbook which contributes to the labor saving of the Korean alphabet entry according to the present invention, is established automatically by the dictionary system of the present invention, based on the words entered into the system according to the entry method of the present invention. Therefore, all the words that the user entered according to the method of the present invention are automatically registered in the dictionary to establish a user wordbook. Once a word is registered in the dictionary, the user can enter completely the same word by entering the first syllable of the word. Because, the system searches the dictionary and displays the words having the same first syllable automatically.\n\nTable 13 shows an example of dictionary with tree structure, composed of the words beginning with , such as and\n\nthe system forms automatically a tree structure. Then, when the user enters again the word in his message text, he/she can find and enter by entering only one syllable without the key entry for\n\nthe Korean alphabet entry method according to Method 4 of the present invention contributes to the labour saving of the Korean alphabet entry by displaying the whole word by means of a limited number of key presses.\n\nTable 14 shows the result that the Korean alphabet entry method of the present invention is compared with other Korean alphabet entry methods, such as Korean Patent No. 0159191 (Date of Patent: August 10, 1998, hereinafter referred to as \"Method Aâ), and Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-1999-0052648 (Date of Application: November 25, 1999, hereinafter referred to as \"Method B\"), 10- 1999-0052650 (Date of Application: November 25, 1999, hereinafter referred to as \"Method Câ), and 10-2000-0062182 (Date of Application: October 21, 2000, hereinafter referred to as \"Method Dâ).\n\nMethod 14 Korean Patent No. 0159191 (Date of Patent: August 10, 1998, hereinafter referred to as \"Method A\")\n\nKorean Patent Application Nos. 10-1999-0052648 Date of Application: November 25, 1999, hereinafter referred to as \"Method Bâ\n\n10- 1999-0052650 Date of Application: November 25, 1999\n\nthe present invention can improve the input efficiency (i.e., the number of times of key presses) by 19% compared to Method A; by 24% compared to Method B; by 24% compared to Method C; and by 15% compared to Method D.\n\nthe present invention can improve the input efficiency (i.e., the number of times of key presses) by 23% compared to Method A; by 4% compared to Method B; by 23% compared to Method C; and by 23% compared to Method D.\n\nFig. 15 illustrates an example of alphabet entry on a Personal Date Assistant (hereinafter referred to as \"PDA\") in accordance with the present invention.\n\nPDA uses a pen by the name of stylus as an entry instrument. If the method of the present invention is applied to the key stylus entry-based character entry system, the character entry system with excellent input efficiency, different from the key-press entry method of cellular telephone can be provided.\n\nthe keys of keypad of cellular telephone are established by hardware, while PDA has a keypad, which is established by software, on a liquid crystal panel. Therefore, the input instruments of a cellular telephone and a PDA are different physically.\n\nthe software keys can send the input signal by pressing each of keys or lining with the pen. Therefore, if the methods of the present invention are applied to PDA, both keys and stylus pen can be used for the character entry on the virtual mode. Consequently, it is possible to enter characters through signaling starting point and up-down-right-left movement using a pen, instead of pressing the numeral keys. For example, if \"Aâ is a representative character, the user presses a numeral key corresponding to \"A\" in order to enter âAâ; lines lightly upward from âAâ in order to enter \"Bâ; and lines lightly downward from \"Aâ in order to enter \"Câ. The result is identical with the character entry method using numeral keys. The above-mentioned method can be also applied to other languages.\n\nFig. 16 illustrates an example of an information sendee method using the preferred embodiment of the present invention.\n\nvarious information services through mobile devices including a cellular telephone are in the phase of activation.\n\nreservation services by means of electronic commerce, information retrieval services for telephone numbers and geographic information, and language learning sendees, and so on.\n\nMost of the telecommunication services need entering character data.\n\nthe input data may be characters, numerals, symbols and so on.\n\nto enter data easily helps the activation of these services.\n\nFig. 16 shows the display provided in the airline reservation service as an example. As shown in Fig. 16, if the service requires entering user name, ID, destination and the place of departure as minimum character entry, the character entry methods according to the present invention can take effect.\n\nFig. 16 shows the display provided in the airline reservation service as an example.
