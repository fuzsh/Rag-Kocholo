        "text": "What’s a Special Character?\n\nA special character on your keyboard is a symbol that is not considered a number or letter. Examples of special characters include currency symbols, accents, the percentage symbol and punctuation such as a question mark. Similarly, ASCII control characters and formatting characters, like paragraph marks, are also considered special characters. The common factor is that none of these are alphanumeric.\n\nThe keys containing these special symbols are often found next to the numeric key section of your keyboard. However, there are hundreds of special symbols, and not all of them have a designated key on your device. Instead, you can type these using an alt keyboard sequence, where you press num lock, and enter a specific sequence of numbers while holding the alt key.\n\nUnlike alphanumeric characters, special characters are extremely versatile and can be used for a number of different purposes in writing, coding, and mathematical operations.\n\nSpecial characters may also be referred to as special letters, special symbols, or keyboard characters.\n\nIn this definition…\n\nHistory of Special Characters\n\nHow to Type Special Characters\n\nSpecial Characters in Passwords\n\nSpecial Character Software\n\nHistory of Special Characters\n\nThe history of special characters depends on the type of character in question. For example, early Greek writers began using punctuation marks to separate one thought from another. Eventually, these marks evolved to change the meaning of a sentence depending on the mark and how it’s used.\n\nOther special characters like @ and & are derived from ligatures, or the combination of two or more letters. The ampersand (&), for example, comes from a ligature that joined the letters in et, the Latin word for and.\n\nHow to Type Special Characters\n\nHow you type special characters depends on which on you’re trying to use. There are hundreds of symbols, with some appearing on your keyboard, and others you can only access by using an alt code.\n\nA typical U.S. QWERTY keyboard features 32 special characters with designated keys. To type them, you can hold the shift key and press the relevant special symbol key simultaneously.\n\nHowever, if you want to access one of the many special characters that do not appear on your keyboard, you’ll type it in a different way. Instead, you’ll press the num lock to activate the symbols function on your keyboard. Then you’ll hold down the alt key while typing the specific alt code sequence for the character you want.\n\nThe special characters list below is in order of appearance from left to right on a standard QWERTY keyboard:\n\nSpecial Characters in Passwords\n\nSpecial characters are often required when creating a strong password. This is because they add complexity to the password and reduce the chances that the user’s account will be hacked.\n\nMany hackers use lists of common or easily guessed phrases and combinations of characters (such as “password” and “1234”) to gain access to a user’s account, so special characters make the password less predictable. However, special characters that are used in predictable ways (like replacing “a” with “@” or “s” with “$”) have lost their effectiveness when it comes to password strength.\n\nSpecial Character Software\n\nMany operating systems have programs or shortcuts that allow users to type symbols and special characters that aren’t found on a standard QWERTY keyboard. However, these programs may not be compatible with all applications. They also may not have all the special characters or symbols you need, or the keystrokes may be too complex to recall easily.\n\nIn these instances, you may benefit from a special character software or character map application.
