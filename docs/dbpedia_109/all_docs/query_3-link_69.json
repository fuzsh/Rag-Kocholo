        "text": "Google Chat lets you add formatting to messages, including the following:\n\nBasic text formatting, such as bold, italic, and strikethrough, in text messages and card messages.\n\nLinked text.\n\n@mention one or all users in a Chat space.\n\nAdd built-in and custom icons in card messages only.\n\nFormat a text message\n\nChat lets you add basic formatting to a text message, including bold, italic, and strikethrough, by using a small subset of Markdown syntax. You format text differently in text messages than in card messages because text messages are formatted with the same syntax that Chat users use. To format text that appears in a card, see Format a card message.\n\nTo format text messages, use the following syntax:\n\nFormat Symbol Example syntax Text displayed in Google Chat Bold * *hello* hello Italic _ (underscore) _hello_ hello Strikethrough ~ ~hello~ hello Monospace ` (backquote) `hello` hello Monospace block ` ` ` (three backquotes) ```\n\nHello\n\nWorld\n\n``` Hello\n\nWorld Bulleted list * or - (hyphen) followed by a space\n\n* This is the first item in the list\n\n* This is the second item in the list\n\nThis is the first item in the list\n\nThis is the second item in the list\n\nFor example, consider the following JSON:\n\n{ \"text\": \"Your pizza delivery *has arrived*!\\nThank you for using _Cymbal Pizza!_\" }\n\nThis formatted text message displays the following in a Chat space:\n\nView text formatting sent in a message\n\nWhen a user sends a message, the plain-text body of the message is in the text field. Some formatting that is applied to the text message using Markdown syntax, is in the text field. Additional formatting is in the output-only formattedText field, including the following:\n\nAdditional Markdown syntax for text\n\nUser mentions\n\nCustom hyperlinks\n\nCustom emoji\n\nFor example, consider the following text sent by a user:\n\nIf the message was formatted by using the Format menu in the Chat UI, the text field contains the text only, while the formattedText field contains the markups, the text, and the hyperlink. The following example shows the draft of a text message with a word hyperlinked, items in a list, and one word bolded:\n\nThe message is received in the following format:\n\n{ \"text\": \"I can meet there at:\\nNoon\\n3 pm\\n5 pm\\nWhat time works for you?\", \"formattedText\": \"I can meet <http://example.com|there> at:\\n* Noon\\n* 3 pm\\n* 5 pm\\nWhat time works for *you*?\", }\n\nIf you include a plain link URL in your message text, such as http://www.example.com/, Google Chat uses this as the link text and automatically hyperlinks that text to the specified URL.\n\nTo provide alternate link text for your link, use the following syntax:\n\nExample syntax Text displayed in Google Chat <https://example.com|Example website>\n\nThe pipe and link text are optional, so that <https://www.example.com/> and https://www.example.com/ are equivalent.\n\nMention users in a text message\n\nChat apps can send text messages that @mention one or all users in a Chat space. Chat apps can't mention users in a space that is in import mode or any users that haven't joined the space.\n\n@mention specific users\n\nTo @mention a specific user, add <users/{user}> to the text message where {user} is the ID of the user. For example, consider the following text message where 123456789012345678901 represents the ID for the user Mahan S.:\n\n{ \"text\": \"A customer has reported an issue. Assigning ticket #942 to <users/123456789012345678901>.\" }\n\nThe text message displays as the following:\n\nYou can specify the users/{user} value in the following ways:\n\nIf your Google Chat app is responding to a message sent by the user, you can use the message.sender.name field of the MESSAGE interaction event.\n\nIf your Google Chat app is creating an asynchronous text message, you can specify the value for users/{user} in the following ways:\n\nUse the name field of the Google Chat User resource, such as users/123456789012345678901.\n\nUse the user's email address as an alias for the {user} value. For example, if the email address is mahan@example.com, you can specify the user as users/mahan@example.com. To use an email alias, your Google Chat app must authenticate as a user.\n\nIf you use the People API, you can also use the people.get method to identify the user ID.\n\n@mention all users\n\nTo create a text message that @mentions everyone in a space, replace {user} with all. The following JSON example mentions all users in a message:\n\n{ \"text\": \"Important message for <users/all>: Code freeze starts at midnight tonight!\" }\n\nFormat a card message\n\nInside cards, most text fields support basic text formatting by using a small subset of HTML tags. You format text differently in card messages than in text messages because text messages are formatted with the same syntax that Chat users use. To format text that appears in a text message, see Format a text message.\n\nUse the Card Builder to design and preview JSON card messages for Chat apps:\n\nOpen the Card Builder\n\nThe supported tags and their purpose are shown in the following table:\n\nFormat Example Rendered result Bold \"This is <b>bold</b>.\" This is bold. Italics \"This is <i>italics</i>.\" This is italics. Underline \"This is <u>underline</u>.\" This is underline. Strikethrough \"This is <s>strikethrough</s>.\" This is strikethrough. Font color \"This is <font color=\\\"#FF0000\\\">red font</font>.\" This is red font. Hyperlink \"This is a <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com\\\">hyperlink</a>.\" This is a hyperlink. Time \"This is a time format: <time>2023-02-16 15:00</time>.\" This is a time format: 2023-02-16 15:00. Newline \"This is the first line. <br> This is a new line.\" This is the first line.\n\nThis is a new line.\n\nAdd a built-in icon to a card\n\nThe DecoratedText and ButtonList widgets support the icon element used to specify one of the built-in icons available in Chat.\n\nThe following table lists the built-in icons that are available for card messages:\n\nflight AIRPLANE bookmark BOOKMARK directions_bus BUS directions_car CAR schedule CLOCK confirmation_number CONFIRMATION_NUMBER_ICON subject DESCRIPTION attach_money DOLLAR mail EMAIL event_seat EVENT_SEAT flight_land FLIGHT_ARRIVAL flight_takeoff FLIGHT_DEPARTURE hotel HOTEL grade HOTEL_ROOM_TYPE insert_invitation INVITE location_on MAP_PIN card_membership MEMBERSHIP people MULTIPLE_PEOPLE person PERSON local_phone PHONE restaurant RESTAURANT_ICON shopping_cart SHOPPING_CART grade STAR store STORE local_play TICKET train TRAIN videocam VIDEO_CAMERA play_circle_filled VIDEO_PLAY\n\nThe following is an example of a card with an email icon:\n\nAdd a Google Material Design icon to a card\n\nThe DecoratedText and ButtonList widgets let you use the Google Material icons so that you can select from over 2500+ icon options and customize the weight, fill, and grade of the icons.\n\nThe following is an example of card with a Google Material icon:\n\nAdd a custom icon to a card\n\nThe DecoratedText and ButtonList widgets let you use the built-in icons, or define your own custom icons. To add a custom icon to a card, include the iconUrl field and specify the icon's corresponding URL.\n\nThe following is an example of a custom icon:"
