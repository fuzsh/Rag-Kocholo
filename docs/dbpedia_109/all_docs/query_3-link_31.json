        "text": "I need to create a summary table at the end of a log with some values that are obtained inside a class. The table needs to be printed in fixed-width format. I have the code to do this already, but I need to limit Strings, doubles and ints to a fixed-width size that is hard-coded in the code.\n\nSo, suppose I want to print a fixed-width table with\n\nint,string,double,string int,string,double,string int,string,double,string int,string,double,string and the fixed widths are: 4, 5, 6, 6.\n\nIf a value exceeds this width, the last characters need to be cut off. So for example:\n\n124891, difference, 22.348, montreal\n\nthe strings that need to be printed ought to be:\n\n1248 diffe 22.348 montre\n\nI am thinking I need to do something in the constructor that forces a string not to exceed a certain number of characters. I will probably cast the doubles and ints to a string, so I can enforce the maximum width requirements.\n\nI don't know which method does this or if a string can be instantiated to behave taht way. Using the formatter only helps with the fixed-with formatting for printing the string, but it does not actually chop characters that exceed the maximum length."
