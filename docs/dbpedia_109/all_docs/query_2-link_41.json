        "text": "Thanks for using our YouTube Title Length Checker!\n\nJust start typing in the above text-box or copy-and-paste your text above to see the character count in real-time!\n\nThe five metrics you will be shown are the YouTube title limit, YouTube title truncation limit, YouTube description limit, Youtube bio limit and YouTube comment limit.\n\nPlease note that conveniently placed under the textbox are a green \"copy\" button and a red \"clear\" button. When clicked, the green \"copy\" button will copy all your text so that you can easily then go paste it into your YouTube channel. Alternatively, if you want to delete text from the textbox, simply click the red \"clear\" button to clear everything and start over.\n\nWorried your YouTube title is too many characters?\n\nEnter your text into the text box above to find out for sure whether your title is under the 100 character limit. If not, it will tell you exactly how many characters over the limit it is.\n\nHowever, just because your title is under 100 characters does not mean it is the optimal length. Anything over 70 characters will be cut off or truncated with three dots at the end (ex. \"This is my YouTube title for ...\").\n\nOur YouTube character counter checks to make sure your YouTube title is under the 70 character truncation limit. Again, the YouTube title character limit is 100 characters but only the first 70 characters show in the title. The last 30 characters are truncated. You have to hover your mouse on the title or click on it to be able to see the whole 100 characters in the title.\n\nYouTube video description character limit\n\nThe YouTube description limit is 5000 characters. The description is an important part of the YouTube video because it is where the main points of the video are summarized. It is also a good place to put timestamps, links to social media, recommended resources, affiliate links, etc. Again, you have 5000 characters for the YouTube description.\n\nHow to Write a Better YouTube Video Description\n\nUploading your video is just the beginning of the process. People have to be able to see your video and be intrigued enough to click on it! Weâll go over some tips and tricks on how to write a better YouTube description and title.\n\nUsing Keywords\n\nYouTube has hundreds of millions of videos on the platform, with many new videos being uploaded daily. In order to create a title and description that will intrigue your audience, and have come up easier in search results, you have to utilize keywords.\n\nKeywords are main words or phrases that describe a topic. Some of these words will be very specific to the topic, while others will just be a general word or phrase about the category as a whole.\n\nKeyword Examples\n\nFor example, if you are making recipe videos, a general keyword phrase would be \"easy recipes\", while a more specific keyword phrase would be \"ten minute soups\". When someone searches YouTube for \"soups\", \"easy soups\", or \"soup recipes\", your video will come up somewhere along the lines because your title contains these words.\n\nYour keywords should go in the title of your video, and the most important words should be seen first. Although you want to include as many keywords in the title, a title that is too long may deter viewers and cause them to overlook the subject of the video.\n\nKeep your title short and sweet, while utilizing the most important words for the subject of your video.\n\nWriting your description\n\nA video description allows you to go into a bit more detail about the video and about your channel as a whole. Best practices are to include the most interesting information first. This prompts your viewer to continue reading any other information that you may want to relay to them.\n\nIf there is a well known person or guest speaker, be sure to include their name here. Giving a brief description about your channel as a whole can help you to gain more subscribers as well. You can include any sources for your information if necessary, or any other message to your audience.\n\nUse the description as a promotional opportunity\n\nMany people use their video description space as an opportunity to create an audience or sale on another platform.\n\nFor example, you can put the link to an online shop, public page, or other YouTube channel here to help to create more sales or a larger following. If your viewers enjoy your video and the content that you are bringing to them on a regular basis, they are likely to follow the link to your store or website.\n\nA video description can be a very good promotional opportunity for you once you start to gain more viewers and subscribers.\n\nUtilize Tag Words\n\nThe tag word option is another main tool for Search Engine Optimization, or SEO. With each tag word or phrase that you include, you give your video a higher chance of being found in YouTube search or Recommended Videos.\n\nYour tag word area is a space that you can type many more keywords. You may include other general and specific keywords that are not included in the video's title.\n\nIf your brand or subject being discussed has a difficult or easily confused name, you can also include misspellings or variations of this name. When typing keywords and phrases, be creative, and think about things that people would commonly type in.\n\nYou can also do a bit of research to see what topics are commonly being searched at the time of your upload. A good YouTube video description is one of the key steps in getting your video seen, and getting the results that you are after for your channel.\n\nOverall, taking the time to create a better YouTube video description will work to benefit your channel in the long run.\n\nYouTube bio character limit\n\nThe YouTube bio is a place located on the about page of a YouTube channel where you are allowed a short description of what to tell people what your channel is about. The YouTube bio length is 1000 characters long. Also located on the about page is an option to post your email address for business inquiries. Below this the country you are located in is shown. And on the bottom of the about page are any social media or website links you have.\n\nYouTube comment character limit\n\nIf you want to write a YouTube comment, you will be limited to 10,000 characters which should be plenty to get your point across. At 10,000 characters, this is even longer than the description and bio combined and longer than any of the other YouTube characters limits. This includes replies to other comments in addition to just a comment on its own.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using out YouTube title length checker and YouTube counter tool!"
