        "text": "Destination URL URLs must have the http:// or https:// prefix. Use up to 2,000 characters. Some special characters, for example: < > # % { } [ ] can cause errors when they're included in the query string at the end of the destination URL. If special characters are accepted, they might not be supported by all browsers.\n\nIf you link to a third-party video such as YouTube or Vimeo, the video won’t be embedded in your ad. To include a video in your ad, use the video ad format.\n\nIf your URL generates an error, copy everything after the question mark in the URL and paste it into a URL encoder. Then, copy your results and replace the original query string in the URL to resolve the issue.\n\nIf you add URL parameters for third-party tracking, don’t use quotation mark characters within the parameter settings, as these parameters can prevent you from reaching the destination URL.* Description Use 100 characters to avoid truncation (300 character maximum). The character limit might vary for ads that appear on third-party apps and sites displayed through the LinkedIn Audience Network (LAN).\n\nThe description is displayed on LinkedIn mobile and desktop when your image is less than 200 pixels wide or if your ad is displayed beyond the feed through the LinkedIn Audience Network."
