        "text": "Log in to your Pinterest business account from your desktop.\n\nClick the hamburger icon at the top-left of the page.\n\nUnder Business, click Catalogs and product groups.\n\nClick Add data source.\n\nClick the Provide URL link tab.\n\nFill in the details for your data source:\n\nBelow Name, provide a name for your data source.\n\nBelow Feed URL, enter your data source URL.\n\nBelow File format, select your file’s format type.\n\nBelow Country/region, select the place where your items are sold.\n\nBelow Language, select the language of the content in your data source.\n\nBelow Feed login details, enter the Username and Password if your data source requires credentials. This is optional because not all feeds require these.\n\nBelow Default currency, select the currency of your products.\n\nBelow Default availability, select the default availability setting for your products.\n\nBelow Data source ingestion frequency, select how often you want it ingested.\n\nBelow Repeat ingestion, select how often you want your data source ingested. The default option is every 24 hours.\n\nBelow Start time and Timezone, select the time you’d like your feed ingested. This is optional.\n\nClick Test your data source. This is optional but we recommend you test your data source so you know it’s functioning correctly.\n\nPaste the piece of data source you want to test, including the header, into the box.\n\nClick Validate data source.\n\nIf there are errors, they’ll appear below the box. Follow the instructions below What to do to fix them.\n\nIf there are no errors, click the chevron-left icon next to Test your data source to return to your data source details.\n\nClick Create Pins.\n\nIf you get an error message after you click Create Pins, check the requirements before trying again.\n\nYou’ll receive an email from Pinterest about the status of your data source.\n\nTips for hosted data sources\n\nTo make sure everything goes smoothly, remember the following:\n\nURLs for hosted data sources must begin with http://, https://, ftp://, or sftp://. Include the full filepath and no credentials in the URL. We accept compressed files (.zip, .giz, .gz, .bz2 and others), but we currently do not support encrypted, password-protected compressed files, Google Drive files, or Dropbox files.\n\nWe ingest your data source at least once every 24 hours and at most every 12 hours, depending on your choice of frequency. Make your updated full data source available daily to keep your product details up-to-date. Scheduled data source updates, and on demand ingestion are available.\n\nHost your own data source on an FTP/SFTP server or with an HTTP/HTTPS direct-download link. This needs to be accessible by a user-agent, and cannot require IP or SSH key whitelisting. If you're using a direct download link, there cannot be any extra navigation required for Pinterest to access the file. We do not provide data source hosting.\n\nWe can process up to 20 million products per feed. If your data source (feed) has more than 20 million products, we'll process the first 20 million rows. To process more than 20 million rows for your catalog, contact your account manager.\n\nWhen changing the image for a product, update the image URL to a different one. If you do not update the image URL, the image change will not be recognized.\n\nLog in to your Pinterest business account from your desktop.\n\nClick the hamburger icon at the top-left of the page.\n\nUnder Business, click Catalogs and product groups.\n\nClick Add data source.\n\nClick the Upload manually tab.\n\nFill in the details for your data source:\n\nBelow Name, provide a name for your data source.\n\nBelow Country/region, select the place where your items are sold. You will not be able to update this later.\n\nBelow Language, select the language of the content in your data source.\n\nBelow Default currency, select the currency of your products.\n\nClick Choose a file to select your data source from your desktop, or drag and drop your data source into the box.\n\nClick Test your data source. This is optional but we recommend you test your data source so you know it’s functioning correctly.\n\nPaste the piece of data source you want to test, including the header, into the box.\n\nClick Validate data source.\n\nIf there are errors, they’ll appear below the box. Follow the instructions below What to do to fix them.\n\nIf there are no errors, click the chevron-left icon next to Test your data source to return to your data source details.\n\nClick Upload data source.\n\nTips for manually uploaded data sources\n\nTo make sure everything goes smoothly, remember the following:\n\nUpdate your data source every seven days or else your products will not be organically distributed across Pinterest. If your data source has not been updated for 90 days, your products will not be distributed across ads on Pinterest either.\n\nUpdate the original data source, then upload it to Pinterest again instead of creating a brand new data source every week.\n\nDo not include item IDs from other data sources you’ve already uploaded, as these will appear as an error when you’re reviewing your catalog’s issues.\n\nWhen changing the image for a product, update the image URL to a different one. If you do not update the image URL, the image change will not be recognized.\n\nMake sure your file size is no more than 50MB. If it's over 50MB, we recommend that you host your data source to upload your products."
