        "text": "I had similar task — the dialog that showed specific keyboard shortcuts for map editing software. To solve such a case I've used visual keyboard button representations with labels on it — it took some space (and increased a visual noise a bit), but was ultimately obvious to most users:\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\nRC — Create new rectangle with it's centre in mouse position\n\nRTL — Create new rectangle with it's top-left corner in mouse position\n\nRSpace — Display list of possible options for new rectangle\n\nCtrl← — Move to nearest left object\n\netc.\n\nIf you don't have any technical reason not to, then I'd suggest actually using terms that users understand rather than just trying to get your fields to have nice alignment / visuals.\n\n{SPACE-BAR} or even {SPACE} are pretty unambiguous and you want to ensure people actually understand what you're offering them, rather than just aiming for aesthetics.\n\nPut it this way; you work in UX yet you - a professional - can't think of a term to use for the spacebar. How are 'normal' people supposed to feel if even you don't know of an alternative?\n\nSo go with {SPACE-BAR} as that's the name of the key, it's what people think of. For example, there is probably no confusion in the sentence {Press the Space-bar to continue} because it's an understood name for that button. Hell, that's more useful than giving them the Unicode code!\n\nIn addition to OPEN BOX U+2423 ␣, which you have tried, there’s U+2420 SYMBOL FOR SPACE ␠ and U+2422 BLANK SYMBOL ␢. That’s pretty much all that Unicode has in this department.\n\nBLANK SYMBOL does not look blank at all. SYMBOL FOR SPACE exists in a few fonts only, with great variation in shape. In some fonts, it contains “S” and “P” in very small size—almost illegible in normal copy text sizes. But in the Symbola font it looks nice (SP in a box with dotted border). But I’m afraid you would need a monospace font (and might even be fixed to a specific font).\n\nSpaces in Unicode\n\nUnicode defines several space characters with specific semantics and rendering characteristics, as shown in the table below. Depending on the browser and fonts used to view this table, not all spaces may display properly...\"\n\nie: U+0020 32 Yes No Space Basic Latin ] [\n\nU+200B 8203 Yes No Zero Width Space General Punctuation ]​[\n\nUnicode also provides some visible characters to stand in for space when necessary:\n\nSpace illustrating characters (visible) in Unicode\n\nU+00B7 183 Middle dot ·\n\nU+237D 9085 Shouldered open box ⍽\n\nU+2420 9248 Symbol for space ␠\n\nU+2422 9250 Blank symbol ␢\n\nU+2423 9251 Open box ␣\n\nThe best character to use is the last character (Open Box) as used in Set Theory / Theory of Computation. When space codes require explicit indication:\n\nfor example when describing a turing machine overwriting a '1' with blank.\n\nFor the first computer I ever had, the manual used a downward triangle where necessary to emphasise the presence of a space. U+25BD (▽) fits the bill, but you might consider that a \"rare symbol\".\n\nI'm not claiming this is a universally-recognised symbol for a space character or anything. But provided that you're willing to define it in the introduction it would do the job. For that matter, so would anything that is obviously not an ASCII character.\n\nI encountered a similar problem when making preliminary analysis on some IMing typing data. Since I needed to be able to display the character many times in a visually distinct fashion, I ended up going the unicode route, and dug up a couple of characters that I liked on this wonderful site.\n\n◯ large circle\n\n○ white circle\n\n￮ halfwidth white circle\n\n⚪ medium white circle\n\n⚬ medium small white circle\n\n◌ dotted circle\n\nI ended up choosing ◌, but something else may be better for you depending on what font you're using and personal preference. ▽, ␣, and ░ are all good options that were already suggested.\n\nAs mentioned just the name space is usually clear enough.\n\nAlternatively, if you are not restricted to just one char, combine 3 box unicode characters to look like a larger open box\n\n└─┘\n\nWhich is U+2514, U+2500 and U+2518 combined.\n\nOr\n\n▕▁▁▁▏\n\nWhich is U+2595, U+2581, U+2581 and U+258F combined."
