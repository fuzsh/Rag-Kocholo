        "text": "Often, when we register for an account on a website, we are asked to create an alphanumeric password. But what is alphanumeric, and what are alphanumeric characters? In this lesson, will will give the definition of alphanumeric, and describe why alphanumeric characters are used.\n\nThe term alphanumeric simply refers to the 26-letter alphabet of Latin characters and the numerals 0-9. The combination of \"alphabet\" and \"numerals\" is where the term \"alphanumeric\" comes from. Sometimes, the definition of alphanumeric will include some special characters such as punctuation marks and common symbols, including the at sign \"@,\" the ampersand \"&\" and the pound sign (also known as the hashtag) \"#\". The inclusion of these extra characters in the definition of alphanumeric is somewhat disputed.\n\nOften websites will ask for alphanumeric passwords for greater security.\n\nWhenever we are asked to create an alphanumeric password, this means the site wants us to create a password consisting of a combination of letters and numbers, which usually results in stronger passwords. Filenames on computer systems are also alphanumeric in nature. These are two common places where alphanumeric characters are used, but perhaps the most useful application of alphanumeric characters is in programming languages. Computers often use numerical languages like binary, which consists only of zeros and ones, or ASCII (which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which uses strings of numerals to generate letters and other characters. Today, Unicode is also used to generate many characters that are impossible to create in ASCII.\n\nList of Alphanumeric Characters\n\nLet's take a look at a list of all alphanumeric characters, including those that are disputed. Then, we will look at a few alphanumeric examples.\n\nWe hope this alpha character list is useful for you!\n\nAlphanumeric characters National Characters Special Characters All Latin letters from A - Z The at sign (@) Exclamation point (!) All numerals from 0 - 9 The dollar sign ($) The ampersand (&) The \"pound\" sign (#) The asterisk (*) The \"pound\" sign (#) The blank space ( ) The comma, semicolon, and period ( , ; . ) The plus, minus, and equals signs ( +, -, = ) Parenthesis, braces, and brackets ( () {} [] ) Single quote ( ' ) Forward slash ( / )\n\nAccording to IBM, this is the list of alphanumeric characters for use in computer programming languages.\n\nAs mentioned, the most common use of alphanumeric characters by most of us is in our passwords. A \"strong\" password is defined to be a string of alphanumeric characters, containing upper and lower case letters, numbers, and sometimes special characters, such as \"Purple02758&!*\" or \"Mu5H.r00Ms571*&@!\" However, complicated combinations of letters and numbers like those in these examples aren't always inherently secure; though it may make a password difficult for a person to guess, a piece of computer software sees one alphanumeric character as being the same as any other - so spelling \"mushroom\" with a 5 instead of an \"S\" and zeros instead of the \"o\"s won't fool a hacker's password breaker for very long. The best way to stay one step ahead of hackers isn't to make our passwords more difficult to spell and remember - it's to make them longer. So, a string such as \"Horse Carriage Battery Water Solemn 72123!\" can be formulated to be easier for us to remember, while its length makes it very difficult for software to crack.\n\nFilenames on our computers also use alphanumeric characters. In the earlier days of the personal computer using text-based operating systems like DOS, filenames were limited to 8 alphanumeric characters in length, with a few restrictions (since the forward slash (/) usually describes a file path, slashes are not allowed in filenames). However, since Windows 95, the 8-character limit on filenames has been lifted, and now filenames can contain alphanumeric strings of great length; however, the restrictions on some characters such as forward slashes still remains.\n\nComputers communicate within themselves, and to each other, using machine languages, which are predominantly numbers. For this reason, programmers need to be familiar with the numerical representations of the alphanumeric characters. There are several different languages we can use to represent alphanumeric characters using numbers. The most basic of these would be the language binary, which uses only zeros and ones. The letter \"A\" in binary, for example, is 01000001.\n\nProgrammers use machine languages such as ASCII or Unicode to reference alphanumeric characters.\n\nAnother way that programmers use numerals to represent alphanumeric characters is ASCII, which we mentioned previously. Each alphanumeric character, including many rarely used characters, diacritic marks and accents, and even rudimentary borders and frames for use in creating ASCII text boxes, is assigned to a number from 1-255. The word \"hello\" (in lowercase) in ASCII is 104 101 108 108 111. If you're really excited about saying hello, you can say it in all caps like this: 72 69 76 76 79. In order to type ASCII characters directly, you can hold Alt while typing the character's numeric code. For example, the ASCII code for the letter \"R\" (uppercase) is Alt+82.\n\nYet another method of generating alphanumeric characters is with Unicode. Unicode contains all of the ASCII characters, and also many expanded characters which are not available elsewhere, including mathematical symbols, foreign alphabetical letters, and more. For example, the character of a five-pointed star is denoted in Unicode as \"2605\". Look up a Unicode table and take a look at all the characters that are possible with it - including all the alphanumeric characters, of course. Unicode references are four-digit numbers in hexadecimal. Hexadecimal is a base-16 counting system, so its digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. There are over 144,000 Unicode characters possible.\n\nBoth Unicode and ASCII characters may be accessed directly while using Windows by utilizing the Windows character map application. The character map lists every possible ASCII and Unicode character for every font on the Windows system, allowing for easy copy-and-paste access when a special character is needed in a document.\n\nThe character map also provides the numeric codes for every ASCII and Unicode character. Other methods of looking up these numerical codes include finding an ASCII or Unicode table on the internet, or, within Microsoft applications, one can use the \"Insert Symbol\" function.\n\nFinally, one less-than-scrupulous use of alphanumeric characters is alphanumeric shellcodes, which have been used by hackers to sneak malicious programs onto computers without humans noticing. They do this by hiding working machine codes within longer sections of alphanumeric characters. This method of hiding working code can be effective at getting past filters. It's even possible to create an alphanumeric shellcode that appears to be normal English text that is readable - meaning that these malicious pieces of software could even bypass a manual screening. These shellcodes require a high level of expertise to create, so they aren't too common, but the technique is well known and has been studied by computer scientists over the last few decades.\n\nNumeric Code\n\nDo you want to learn a secret language? If you do, see if you can decipher this string of numbers. (Look for the answer in the lesson summary.)\n\n83 84 85 68 89 46 67 79 77\n\nOkay, so it isn't really a secret language. It is the numeric code that computer programmers (and you) can use to create alphanumeric characters in programming. Let's investigate shall we?\n\nAlphanumeric Defined\n\nAlphanumeric, also known as alphameric, simply refers to the type of Latin and Arabic characters representing the numbers 0 - 9, the letters A - Z (both uppercase and lowercase), and some common symbols such as @ # * and &.\n\nSites requesting that you create an alphanumeric password are asking us to use a combination of numbers and letters, which creates stronger passwords. We also use alphanumeric keys to create file names, although there are some symbols that are not accepted as part of a file name, such as a slash (/).\n\nThat doesn't seem very secret does it? The 'secret' language part comes into play when we start talking about alphanumeric characters in terms of actual computer programming.\n\nAlphanumeric Characters\n\nSince computers (or central processing units, to be specific) use machine language in the form of numbers to communicate, computer programmers need to write their instructions using numbers rather than alphabet characters. To do this, programmers use numeric representations of what humans see as alphabet characters. You've probably seen or heard of binary code which uses only 0s and 1s to represent an alphanumeric character. Computer programmers can use a series of 0s and 1s to represent any character they wish. For example, in binary, the letter 'A' would be written as 01000001.\n\nAnother way computer programmers represent alphanumeric characters is to use ASCII. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.\n\nUsing the ASCII table, a computer programmer can represent the word 'red' using the numbers 82 69 68. This is true unless they wanted it in lower case letters, in that case it would be 114 101 100.\n\nNow, you are probably thinking to yourself, 'I can key those numbers from my keyboard or number pad, and all I get are numbers!' You would be correct. In order to use those numbers as ASCII code, you need to be using a text-only program such as Notepad (or save a Word document as text only by choosing the plain text option).\n\nNot only do you need to use a text-only file, but you also have to let your application know you want it to convert the code into alphanumeric characters by preceding the ASCII numbers with the 'Alt' key and using a numeric keypad such as the one found to the right of most keyboards. (If you are using a Mac, you will use the 'Option' key.)\n\nHow does this work? If you wanted to represent the letter 'R' (upper case), you would hold the 'Alt' key and then type the number 82 from the keypad. For 'r '(lower case), you would hold the 'Alt' key and then type the number 114 on the keypad. This can be done with every alphanumeric character you want to create. Go ahead and try it! Open a blank file in notepad and press the series of keys described to try to produce 'R' and 'r.'"
