        "text": "With the Open Ended question type, participants can type in free-text answers. This question type is good to use when you don't want to use pre-determined answers and want voters to write longer answers (up to 200 characters at a time).\n\nSince participants can input anything, you can use this question to collect emails or other information to identify voters. It is also great for letting the audience send in their own questions to the speaker.\n\nPro tip: Let participants have a bit more time to enter their statements.\n\nHow to create an Open Ended question\n\nChange result layout\n\nYou can change the results layout under the Design tab. The options are:\n\nSpeech bubbles\n\nFlowing grid\n\nThe Speech bubbles layout will display multiple responses on the slide. If you get more responses than fit the slide, you can scroll down the slide (while presenting in full screen) view to see more responses.\n\nThe Flowing grid layout works just like the Speech bubbles layout, but the slide will automatically scroll down as you get more responses.\n\nYou can see a preview of the layouts when you create your question – just hover over the different options to see how they will look. You can also change the layout of the responses while presenting by opening the Presentation menu (hover over the bottom left corner of the screen) and selecting the Show layout button from the left-side toolbar:\n\n​\n\nAdd a profanity filter\n\nTo avoid inappropriate words, you can use the profanity filter to remove them from your audience's input. You can activate the profanity filter from the Language preferences menu (located in the Settings menu):\n\n​\n\nLet participants add multiple responses\n\nEach Open ended response allows for up to 200 characters, but if your participants want to add more input they can submit several responses. The option to submit several responses is turned on by default. If you want to turn this option off, you can select the Interactivity tab and toggle “Multiple responses per person”.\n\nVoting on the responses to your Open Ended question\n\nYou can also use Open Ended slides to hold brainstorming sessions with your audience. Participants can submit their answers normally, then they can vote on each other's submissions.\n\nTo activate this feature, simply check “Vote on Responses” within the Interactivity tab (and change the number of votes, if you wish):\n\n​\n\n​\n\nYou can choose how many votes each user can submit and whether or not those votes need to be on different options:\n\nOnce participants have submitted their responses, you can start the voting by pressing Enter or by clicking this button at the bottom of the slide:\n\nNote that if you have enabled voting on responses on an Open Ended slide, you will not be able to set the presentation to Survey mode. Learn more about presentation pacing here.\n\nIf you get more than 11 responses, you can use AI to group them so that it's easier to get an overview. Learn how to use AI to group responses on your Open Ended question here.\n\nNote that voting is also possible after having grouped the responses.\n\nRemoving unwanted entries\n\nIn case your audience enters undesired words that haven't been captured by our profanity filter, or you simply want to remove certain responses or tidy up the results before exporting to PDF, you can remove input from Word Clouds and Open Ended questions. This can be done either in the Mentimote or directly on your presentation screen. Learn more here."
