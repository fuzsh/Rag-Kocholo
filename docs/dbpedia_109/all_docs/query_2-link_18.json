Facsimile of the 1742 manual accompanied by the 20 page introduction. 2 volumes. Printed in an edition limited to 600 copies. Loosely inserted in this copy is the 12 page publisher's catalogue describing this book and others they published. One joint split about one inch from opening of slipcase. Minor wear to slipcase. Else a pristine copy of this scarce facsimile. Reproduced from the copy in the Printing Library of the St. Bride Institute. Thirty-three plates depict samples of the types cut by Fournier c. 1742, which then appeared in his Manuel Typographique. Introduction by Mosley, renowned typography professor and then librarian at the St. Bride Printing Library. Printed in collotype by Louis van Leer & Co. of Amsterdam on rag cream paper. A consummate artist and craftsman, Fournier (1712 - 1768) was one of the 18th century's finest engravers and typefounders, and his type, with its light, clean look on the printed page and great economy in text, greatly influenced Giambattista Bodoni (1740 - 1813), who later in the century popularized the more severe \"modern\" look. His typeface designs continue to be of monumental importance for printers and educators to this day. cloth, paper wrappers, both volumes enclosed in a slipcase - MODELES DES CARACTERES DE L'IMPRIMERIE ET DES AUTRES CHOSES NECESSAIRES AUDIT ART.
