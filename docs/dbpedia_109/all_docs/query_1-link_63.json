        "text": "You almost certainly have set the wrong character set in your PuTTY settings.\n\nVerify the character set on the remote system by running the command:\n\nlocale\n\nThis should return something like:\n\nLANG=de_DE.UTF-8 LC_CTYPE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_NUMERIC=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_TIME=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_COLLATE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_MONETARY=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_MESSAGES=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_PAPER=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_NAME=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_ADDRESS=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_TELEPHONE=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_MEASUREMENT=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_IDENTIFICATION=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" LC_ALL=\n\nSo check your PuTTY settings under Translation and ensure that you have UTF-8 set as the character set.\n\nYou may need to tweak the line drawing setting as well, but it is probably not likely.\n\nThe two basic factors are Window/Translation UTF-8 in putty and locale settings in Linux, as instructed here and many other places.\n\nIn addition, it may help in putty to set Connection/Data/Terminal-type string to putty, and/or in Linux to export NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1. These two are also mentioned multiple places.\n\nBut: you may still get blocks for certain characters because the default fonts like Courier and Lucida Console don't have all Unicode chars. Download and install http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download, and set putty to use it.\n\nThis last trick was necessary for me to get noping (recommended!) to show all graphic characters.\n\nI was looking for many solutions for this when using Docker machine (both locale and on machines set up by system administrator). In my Putty everything was fine (I had UTF-8), I was using also other SSH client and had exact same problem.\n\nRunning:\n\nmc -ac\n\nwas solving the problem (but not completely) and I was looking for complete solution.\n\nAfter reading many suggestions, I finally found the one that solved my issue.\n\nIn terminal when you run:\n\nlocale\n\nverify what locale you have set. I had by default C locale.\n\nTo verify all locale installed run locale -a\n\nI have for example:\n\nC C.UTF-8 POSIX\n\nby default.\n\nThe solution is exporting LANG variable with C.UTF-8 locale like so:\n\nexport LANG=\"C.UTF-8\"\n\nYou can obviously add it into .bashrc to have it automatically set in your profile.\n\nAnother reason somehow related to pam that may affect hosts with powerbroker/pbis/likewise authentication.\n\ngrep /etc/pam.d for the \"lsass\" occurance:\n\ngrep -r lsass /etc/pam.d\n\nif you see in the output something like:\n\n/etc/pam.d/common-session:session sufficient pam_lsass.so\n\nthen it's probably the root cause of the problem. The quick fix is to replace \"sufficient\" with \"optional\" next to pam_lsass module so it looks like:\n\n/etc/pam.d/common-session:session optional pam_lsass.so\n\n/etc/pam.d/common-session (or other file with similar entry - there might be few of them) is probably included by /etc/pam.d/sshd before pam_env is loaded so if the processing of pam modules is finished before it comes to pam_env, the /etc/default/locale is not loaded in the user environment and you have garbled characters."
