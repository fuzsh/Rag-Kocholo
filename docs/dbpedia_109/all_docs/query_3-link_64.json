        "text": "How do you write a character description in a screenplay? It’s a simple question, with a seemingly simple answer, right? Well, not really. Because it turns out that there’s no one correct way to write a character description in your script. But there are some general rules that most professional writers follow. Namely, less is more.\n\nKeep your character descriptions short, sweet, and to the point. Script readers would rather see the character’s actions and reactions throughout the screenplay define them. But if you need to find creative ways for your characters to make their entrance, you have some options. Here are 25 ways you can create well-written and creative character descriptions in your next screenplay.\n\nHow to write great character descriptions\n\nStart with the basics: Name and age formatting\n\nAlways format a CHARACTER’S NAME IN ALL CAPS. When a character first appears within the script, putting their name in CAPS allows the reader to pay special attention to that entrance. It stands out on the page. Next, put their age-range in parenthesis (30-45 years old). This lets the reader visualize the character and it helps the producer and the casting department know what age-range of actors to cast.\n\nChoose physical descriptions that foreshadow their character type\n\nYou are not the wardrobe department supervisor, so you don’t need to worry about going into detail about every piece of clothing the character is wearing. But you can find a fragment or sentence that describes a visual character type. Is your character wearing a hat? Are they in a slim-fitting suit? Are they in a bathrobe with a White Russian in hand? Simple visual details like an outfit help readers visualize the character.\n\nUse a single sentence that defines character traits\n\nThe most creative screenwriters can craft a sentence that instantly defines what this character is about. At least, that’s the goal when the reader is first introduced to them. Readers should instantly get an impression of your characters from this single sentence description:\n\nYou don’t want to mess with this guy\n\nHe has secrets that no one will ever know\n\nShe’s stronger and more determined than anyone in the room\n\n25 iconic character descriptions in film\n\nRules are meant to be broken, and guidelines are just that — guidelines. So beyond these general directives character descriptions are a land of gray area. And within that gray area are some iconic cinematic characters that were described within their respective screenplays in various ways, formats, and styles. Here are twenty-five iconic character descriptions as they were first introduced. Take what you love from them and leave the rest behind as you create your own character description style.\n\nNote: Some of these screenplay character descriptions may not reflect the final visual character depictions on screen.\n\nAlonzo Harris in Training Day\n\nDownload the Training Day script for free here (PDF).\n\nAnnie Wilkes in Misery\n\nDownload the free Misery script here (PDF).\n\nApollo Creed in Rocky\n\nDownload Rocky script for free here (PDF).\n\nAxel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop\n\nDownload Beverly Hills Cop script for free here (PDF).\n\nClarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs\n\nDownload Silence of the Lambs script for free here (PDF).\n\nEllen Ripley in Alien\n\nDownload Alien script for free here (PDF).\n\nHannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs\n\nHans Gruber in Die Hard\n\nDownload Die Hard script for free here (PDF).\n\nIndiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nDownload Raiders of the Lost Ark script for free here (PDF).\n\nJack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n\nDownload Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl script for free here (PDF).\n\nJohn Coffey in The Green Mile\n\nLuke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo in Star Wars\n\nDownload Star Wars script for free here (PDF).\n\nMichael Corleone in The Godfather\n\nDownload The Godfather script for free here (PDF).\n\nMr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid\n\nNorman Bates in Psycho\n\nRick Blaine in Casablanca\n\nDownload Casablanca script for free here (PDF).\n\nRocky Balboa in Rocky\n\nSarah Connor in The Terminator\n\nDownload The Terminator script for free here (PDF).\n\nThe Terminator in The Terminator\n\nTravis Bickle in Taxi Driver\n\nThis last example from a 1967 Oscar-winning film reflects how the times have changed — and continue to change — for the better.\n\nVirgil Tibbs in In the Heat of the Night\n\nLearn more about Screenwriting Basics: Everything You Need to Know About CAPS!\n\nKen Miyamoto has worked in the film industry for nearly two decades, most notably as a studio liaison for Sony Studios and then as a script reader and story analyst for Sony Pictures."
