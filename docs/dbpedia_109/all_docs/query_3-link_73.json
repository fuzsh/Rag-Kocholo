        "text": "Looking for an unambiguous calendar-and-clock format that is internationally understood? It’s time for ISO 8601.\n\nThis ISO standard helps remove doubts that can result from the various day–date conventions, cultures and time zones that impact a global operation. It gives a way of presenting dates and times that is clearly defined and understandable to both people and machines.\n\nWhat can ISO 8601 do for me?\n\nWhen dates are represented with numbers they can be interpreted in different ways. For example, 01/05/22 could mean January 5, 2022, or May 1, 2022. On an individual level this uncertainty can be very frustrating, in a business context it can be very expensive. Organizing meetings and deliveries, writing contracts and buying airplane tickets can be very difficult when the date is unclear.\n\nISO 8601 tackles this uncertainty by setting out an internationally agreed way to represent dates:\n\nYYYY-MM-DD\n\nTherefore, the order of the elements used to express date and time in ISO 8601 is as follows: year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.\n\nFor example, September 27, 2022 at 6 p.m. is represented as 2022-09-27 18:00:00.000.\n\nISO 8601 can be used by anyone who wants to use a standardized way of presenting:\n\nDate\n\nTime of day\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC)\n\nLocal time with offset to UTC\n\nDate and time\n\nTime intervals\n\nRecurring time intervals"
