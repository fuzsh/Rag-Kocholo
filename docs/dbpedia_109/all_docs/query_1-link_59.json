        "text": "A picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nIt's true! An image can help you visually describe things to a reader or audience to help them understand things in your world on a deeper level. Images can also help break up large chunks of text, making it easier to read. There are many different ways you can use images in your world. This article will give you an overview of how to add them and point out all the important features related to them. To use an image on World Anvil, first upload it. Then you can use the image in all the ways that World Anvil offers. When uploading an image, it is recommended to use the WEBP image format. Supported image formats are JPG, PNG, WEBP and GIF.\n\nUploading an image\n\nImages can be uploaded in one of two ways. The first is from the Images interface, where you manage and organize all the images of a world. This upload can only upload a single image at once. To mass upload multiple images use the blue mass image upload feature. You can upload the images either by dragging them into the drop zone of either upload feature or click on the dropzone to open up a file dialog to select your images on your device. You cannot upload images directly from an URL.\n\nUsing images on World Anvil\n\nThese are the various ways images can be utilized on World Anvil.\n\nCharacter portrait and organization crest\n\nThe character article template has a special field for a character portrait. This portrait is used in family trees, bloodlines, historical events the character is associated with, and campaign NPCs/PCs. The image itself will be added to the top of the article's sidebar, above any other content you can add. To add an image as a portrait or flag, you must search for the image. You can search for an image by name or by tags. When the image appears, click on it to save it. The screenshot to the right shows the process in action. The same applies to organization emblems, but they are used in diplomacy webs instead of family trees.\n\nWorld background\n\nThis feature is available to Master, Grandmaster and Sage guild members.\n\nThe world background image is a setting of the world and can be change here: Page Background. To change the background only on specific pages it is necessary to use CSS.\n\nPage covers for articles, categories and events\n\nAn image can be added as a cover image for one or more of these. Each of these interfaces is either a drop-down list of all images or expects you to enter the name of the file. The recommended resolution for all cover images is 1920x500. Each theme has a default cover image that will be displayed if you do not specify one.\n\nWorld\n\nHomepage Cover\n\nGlobal Cover\n\nCategory\n\nBOOK-STYLE COVER: A category displayed as a book will use this image. Recommended dimension is 300x400.\n\nPAGE COVER: This image is only used on the category page.\n\nDEFAULT ARTICLE CATEGORY COVER: This image is used in all articles which are directly under this category. It is not inherited to subcategories.\n\nArticle\n\nARTICLE COVER IMAGE (HEADER): The image is used at the top of the article and in the article blocks.\n\nHistorical Event\n\nHISTORY COVER IMAGE (HEADER) : The image is used at the top of the historical event.\n\nImage BBCode\n\nImages can be added anywhere with BBCode support. The basic BBCode to add an image is [img:id]. There are three different options that can be applied. See below for all the options.\n\n[img:(number)|alignment (left,right,center)|width in pixels|nolink]\n\nLearn how to add the BBCode to your articles with the video below or check the BBCode examples under it:\n\nExamples\n\nCode\n\n[img:82765] Output\n\nThe image added without any options. Its size depends on the size of the uploaded image and the space available on the page where it will be displayed.\n\nCode\n\n[img:82765|nolink] Output\n\nThe nolink option removes the link from the image. This is useful if you want to add the image as a purely decorative element, or if you do not want users to navigate away from the page they are on.\n\nCode\n\n[img:82765|left|100] Output\n\nThis image is aligned to the left side of the page on which it appears. Text above or below the image may appear to the right of the image. The width of the image is set to 100 pixels.\n\nCode\n\n[img:82765|right|100] Output\n\nThis image is aligned to the right side of the page on which it appears. Text above or below the image may appear to the left of the image. The width of the image is set to 100 pixels.\n\nCode\n\n[img:82765|center|100] Output\n\nThis option aligns the image to the center of the page on which it is displayed. The width of the image is set to 100 pixels. No text can appear on the side of the image.\n\nCode\n\n[url:https://www.worldanvil.com/world/image/list][img:82765|nolink][/url] Output\n\nAn image with nolink allows you to give it a custom link with the url BBCode. Use this only if you need more than one link to the same image. Otherwise, use the LINK URL field in the advanced editing section to replace the URL.\n\nEmbedding an External Image\n\nOn World Anvil it is generally recommended to upload an image to the image manager and then use the image as follows. If this is not possible or desired for one reason or another, there is a way to embed an image directly without uploading it first. Just add the direct link to the image in the image BBCode instead of the id number. The same options are available. The reason this is not recommended is that if you do not have permission to use an image, and the copyright holder files a DMCA claim against your use of the image on World Anvil, the team may have to remove the entire article in which that image is embedded, not just the image itself!\n\n[img:https://www.worldanvil.com/uploads/images/a1def8d2e452019fb5c08473547efa7a.webp|left|50]\n\nImage block BBCode\n\nThe image on the right is added as an image block. This format creates a box around the image and adds the description and name from the image metadata. To insert an image block, add the BBCode [imgblock:222269] to the location. You can also specify the background color if the image is transparent: [imgblock:123|color] will display an image using the color you specified as the background. You can use any HTML Color for this parameter. You can find common names here. The image block does not currently have any other options. The block is moved to the right side with the use of the container BBCode. To change the layout of the block more extensively CSS has to be used.\n\nDimitris Announcement Chibi (small)\n\nby 10TenArt\n\nChibi Dimitris has something to tell you!\n\nImage metadata\n\nImage metadata is used to describe the image and give it some context. You can change most of this metadata to provide context for the image within your world. The metadata of an image includes the following fields:\n\nName: The name of the file on WorldAnvil and the title of the image. Be sure to give each image a good name, as this field will be used as the image title in the carousel and when the mouse is over the image embedded in an article. The image manager and galleries use this field to sort images in lexicographic order.\n\nPrivacy State ( / ): The lock can be used to set the privacy status of images. A blue open lock means the item is public, and a red closed lock means the item is private. You can click the icon to change the status. In the advanced edit form, the status is changed using a drop-down menu.\n\nFavorite ( / ): Favorite an image to pin it to the top of any list in the images manager. You can view all your favorited images with the filter in the left sidebar. This has no effect anywhere else in World Anvil.\n\nDescription: A long-form description of the image. This is used in the Image Block BBCode and displayed on the image page that can be opened by clicking on an embedded image.\n\nTags: The tags help you and others find the image. The global search in the world will find these tags. Separate by comma and start with #.\n\nAlt Text. This text is added to the alt property of the image whenever it is embedded. The alt field is used by accessibility tools to discribe images to folks who cannot see the image and is used as a placeholder should the image not be loaded correctly. Adding a good alt text is important for accessibility and SEO. Take some time to craft good alt text. The full references and recommondations can be found here. For easier to digest recommendations with examples check out the sources below:\n\nHow to Write Alt Text and Image Descriptions for the visually impaired by Perkins School for the Blind.\n\nCooper Hewitt Guidelines for Image Description by Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.\n\nArtist Name: The name of the artist who made the artwork. Use this field to credit the artist of the work. Add your own name if you made it. When the image is embedded in an article it will show up directly under the image. If the image is used as a cover image or a portrait / flag the credit will appear at the bottom of the article.\n\nArtist URL: Add an URL to the artists website or portfolio. Is only active if the Artist Name is filled in. Turns the name into a link, making it easy for readers to find the artist.\n\nArt Title: The title of the art given by the artist or assigned by you.This also shows up under the image when embedded into the article.\n\nArt URL: A link to the art where it can be found if applicable. Is only active if the Art Title is filled in. Turns the title into a link, making it easy for readers to find the original source of the work.\n\nColosseo by FeaturedPics\n\nWorld: Each image belongs to a world. It is possible to move an image to a different world with the dropdown menu. Images can only be searched by title in the world it is associated with. However, the image id is globally unique and can be used anywhere on World Anvil. It is currently not possible to move an image to a world you are not the owner of. Even if you are the co-owner or and editor on that world.\n\nGalleries: An image can belong to one or more galleries. Galleries can be used to organize your images and for Article Galleries and Carousels\n\nReplace File: It is possible to replace the image file. All links will continue to work and simply display the new image.\n\nLink URL: This will replace the default link of the image when it is clicked. It needs to be an absolute link. While this field is empty the image links to the default image display page.\n\nSubscriber Groups: Add subscriber groups to the image. Only users with this subscriber group can see the image and access the image page.\n\nSome of these fields can only be accessed in the advanced edit form of the image. Check out the info about the images manager to learn more.\n\nGalleries & Carousel\n\nImage Gallery\n\nTechnology / Science |\n\nGalleries are used to organize images and showcase a large quantity of images within a world. Includes an option to display a carousel.\n\nImage size and storage\n\nThe image size and storage are limited to a specific amount on every account. The limit on storage depends on the subscription tier of the account, while the image size depends on the type of image as well.\n\nMaximum storage\n\nTier Storage Free account\n\n100 MB\n\nMaster\n\n2 GB\n\nGrandmaster\n\n5 GB\n\nSage\n\n10 GB\n\nMaximum image size\n\nLocation Free user Guild member Profile images\n\n1 MB\n\n1 MB\n\nWorld Images\n\n1 MB\n\n10 MB\n\nMap Images\n\n3.5 MB\n\n25 MB\n\nRecommended image sizes\n\nThe following table explains the recommended sizes and aspect ratios for images you can upload to the various World Anvil resources (regular article images are not included as they are flexible). The aspect ratio describes the width of the image in relation to its height - 4:1 means that for every 4 pixels in width, there's 1 pixel in height. The system doesn't prevent you from uploading larger or smaller images. Instead, the frame of the image will be adjusted to fit the image, or the image will be adjusted to fit the frame, depending on the resource or location. In any case, staying close to the recommended size is the safest option.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nHow many images can I use in an article?\n\nAs many as you like! But be careful not to add LOADS as it can make your article look cluttered or load slowly!\n\nWhat's my upload limit overall?\n\nCheck the tables above for the image upload size limit and overall storage limit on World Anvil.\n\nCan I put the image BBCode anywhere on the site?\n\nAbsolutely! You can even put it in map pins, timeline excerpts and your world vignette!\n\nHow do I move an image to another world?\n\nGo to the Images manager and click on the image you want to move. Then, in the right sidebar, find the World field it and use its drop-down to move the image.\n\nCan my co-owners & editors use the images on my account?\n\nYes. However, they cannot use the search fields to find them. They need to directly find the ID in the images manager. Or you give them the ID. Writers and advanced writers cannot see the images of the world, so they need to be given the ID to add any images.\n\nWhy do I have to upload images to use them?\n\nThe reason we do not recommend direct linking to images and have the upload system is due to copyright. If an artist, photographer or creator discovers that you have used one of their images unlawfully or without permission - they may contact the team to take down the image. Thanks to the upload system, the team can target the problematic image and remove it without having to delete the entirety of every article it was used on.\n\nHow do I credit an artist?\n\nThe best way to credit the artist for an artwork that you use on your world as an image is to use the associated metadata fields on the image. This will make sure that the credits appear anywhere you use the image. Otherwise make sure to either credit your art wherever you use it or have a global copyright notice somewhere on every page of your world where images may appear.\n\nWhat happens if the team receives a DCMA takedown request for an image I uploaded?\n\nThe team will review the request and give you 24h to either take down the image yourself or prove that you do have permission to use the image. After the 24h are up the team will delete the image from your image library."
