Problem is, the password has a special character (@) in it that is causing the set command to fail.\n\nI have tried both escaping the character (\\@) and percent-encoding it with the hex value (%40), to no avail.\n\nFor example, with the username Foo and password B@r, I have tried the following commands:\n\nset http_proxy=http://foo:B\\@[email protected]:80 set http_proxy=http://foo:B%[email protected]:80\n\nOther than changing the password how can I have the proxy use the password?"
