        "text": "Character Analysis:\n\nIn this exercise you will look at the characters of your favorite story (novel, movie, TV show, or game!) in greater depth.\n\nProtagonist and Antagonist:\n\nBeginning:\n\nWhich character is the protagonist? Which is the antagonist? For example, if you chose Star Wars, your protagonist would be Luke Skywalker, and your antagonist Darth Vader. If you would like to look at the other characters as well, try to identify stock characters (Jabba the Hutt) along with other protagonists. Supporting main characters are known as deuteragonists and tritagonists (they are often supporting protagonists, but sometimes can be both one of these and antagonists!). In Star Wars, Princess Leia is the deuteragonist, and Han Solo is the tritagonist.\n\nThe End:\n\nNext, decide whether your protagonist and antagonist are flat or round characters, and static or dynamic. To continue with Star Wars as an example, Luke is dynamic and round (capable of being both selfish and selfless), and Vader is, in the first film, flat and static, but by the end of the third film, round and dynamic.\n\nIf you are not certain whether a character is round or flat, consider whether there are any similarities between the protagonist and antagonist. (The best antagonists are often somewhat similar to protagonists.) Again, in Star Wars Luke and Vader are both determined to learn the ways of the Force.\n\nTo help determine if a character is static or dynamic, write out a list of traits the character displays in their first scene, and the traits they display in their final scene. In his first scene, Luke is complaining, naive, and curious about the galaxy. In his final scene, Luke is brave, is no longer naive yet is still idealistic, and has found his place in the galaxy.\n\nThe Journey:\n\nNow you know your beginning and your destination. To examine how dynamic character changes from the beginning to end, go through and identify moments that show them changing (hint: usually this happens through a challenge or choice the character faces). Again, for example, Luke loses his naivete when he discovers his father's identity, but affirms his belief in the goodness of people by choosing to reconcile with his father.\n\nDefinition of Character in Literature\n\nAll stories must have certain characteristics or elements. Without these elements, any piece of literature would cease to make sense or serve a purpose. For example, stories must have a plot, or events that take place. Another essential story element is the character. Character can be defined as any person, animal, or figure represented in a literary work. There are many types of characters that exist in literature, each with its own development and function.\n\nCharacter Development & Character Types\n\nCharacter development refers to how developed and complex a character is. Some characters start out as highly developed. For example, if we know something about how a character walks and talks, what she thinks, who she associates with, and what kind of secrets she has, she is naturally more complex and developed.\n\nOther characters develop over the course of a story, starting out one way and ending up different, becoming changed by what happens to them. Or you might only see one side of the character for a while but at some point, another side is revealed, proving the character to be more complex.\n\nThe general purpose of characters is to extend the plot. Many stories employ multiple types of characters. Every story must have main characters. These are the characters that will have the greatest effect on the plot or are the most affected by what happens in the story. There are many ways to categorize main characters: protagonist or antagonist, dynamic or static character, and round or flat characters. A character can also often fit into more than one category or move through categories.\n\nProtagonist vs. Antagonist Characters\n\nNearly every story has at least one protagonist. A protagonist is a main character who generates the action of a story and engages the reader's interest and empathy. The protagonist is often the hero or heroine. For example, in the popular Divergent trilogy, the protagonist is Tris. The story is told from her point of view, and she is central to all the action in the plot. The protagonist is usually a well-developed character; in this way, she is more relatable.\n\nThe opposite of the protagonist is the antagonist. An antagonist is a character who opposes the protagonist. In that same book series, Tris is opposed both by Eric, a sadistic trainer, and Jeanine Matthews, a cold-hearted, prejudiced scientist. Together, the protagonist or protagonists and antagonist or antagonists move the plot along, create the action, and draw the reader's interest.\n\nJeanine Matthews in Divergent\n\nDynamic vs. Static Characters\n\nThe concept of dynamic and static characters is closely tied to character development. A dynamic character is one who goes through some sort of change; they show character development. A protagonist is usually a dynamic character. In the Divergent series, Tris is a dynamic character because she changes from a shy, weak girl into a strong, confident woman. Tobias, who later becomes Tris' boyfriend, is also a dynamic character. He changes from a hard, cold, and distant person to someone who has weaknesses, shows great love, and ends up fighting for the greater good alongside Tris.\n\nStatic characters, on the other hand, are those who do not change throughout the course of the story. They serve to show contrast to dynamic ones, refusing to grow and remaining in one place or mentality. In Divergent, the two antagonists, Eric and Jeannine, remain mean and sadistic throughout the series.\n\nRound vs. Flat Characters\n\nThe concept of round and flat characters is also closely tied to character development. Round characters are fully-developed figures in the story. They are more realistic and complex and show a true depth of personality. They require more attention by the reader; they can make surprise decisions or puzzling ones. Many factors can affect round characters, and they react to those factors realistically. In Divergent, Tobias proves himself to be a round character. As his past abuse by his father and his ostracism and loneliness from being divergent are revealed, we begin to see a much deeper side to him."
