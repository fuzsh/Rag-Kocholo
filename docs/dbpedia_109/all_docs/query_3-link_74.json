        "text": "We reached out to a couple of email experts to get their take on email widths and here’s what we heard.\n\nEmail banner size specifications\n\nElliot Ross from Action Rocket writes, “We’ve been experimenting with wider emails. Our weekly email tops out at 960px wide, and goes from 3 cols to 2 to 1 depending on subscribers screen sizes.”\n\nWe checked out Action Rocket’s email on our Apple Thunderbolt monitor. Sure enough, it looked sharp as a tack and that yellow background color in the main section stretched full width.\n\nThen we adjusted our screen size and responsiveness kicked in adjusting seamlessly.\n\nIt’s important to note, however, that at widths wider than 640px that Gmail doesn’t show any background color that would appear in the margins at most reasonable browser sizes (you can see them if you stretch your browser to wider than 1200px).\n\nPlus, email clients don’t use the full width of your screen to display an email message. Some show ads or have navigation or a menu so there are limitations to the real estate on a screen.\n\nSo, if you want your email to render well in every email client, it seems we can push the envelope on our email widths a bit further to at least 640 pixels. And if you want to go even further, you can use background colors to stretch full-width, like the yellow band in the Action Rocket email – just know that some clients may not show it.\n\nStig Morten Myre, our own email developer at Campaign Monitor, advises that the age-old 600-pixel recommendation is still a useful guideline, although not a hard and fast rule.\n\n“If your email is mobile-friendly, that generally means it doesnʼt just have a single width for everyone. So the number weʼre talking about here is really the maximum width it will be displayed at.\n\nTo decide on that number, there are a few things you can look at. Which email clients do your subscribers open their emails in? Does your email adapt to the width of those email clients, or could it end up with horizontal scrolling if the email is too wide?\n\nAlso, consider the line length of your text. A common recommendation is to stay within a range of 45-75 characters per line. So if your font size is the same on mobile as in the full desktop version, you can aim for the minimum width to fit approximately 45 characters per line, and 75 or so characters per line at the maximum width. Again, these are only guidelines, but it can be a useful angle to approach your email design from.”\n\nWhen designing our free email templates, Stig and team took this into account, making the layouts display at a 600-pixel width on desktop and 320 pixels on mobile, to ensure emails will look awesome in every client and on every device."
