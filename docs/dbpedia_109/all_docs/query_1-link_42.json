        "text": "Overview\n\nTo configure a host in Zabbix frontend, do the following:\n\nGo to: Data collection â Hosts or Monitoring â Hosts\n\nClick on Create host to the right (or on the host name to edit an existing host)\n\nEnter parameters of the host in the form\n\nYou can also use the Clone button in the configuration form of an existing host to create a new host. This host will have all of the properties of the existing host, including linked templates, entities (items, triggers, etc.) from those templates, as well as the entities directly attached to the existing host.\n\nNote that when a host is cloned, it will retain all template entities as they are originally on the template. Any changes to those entities made on the existing host level (such as changed item interval, modified regular expression or added prototypes to the low-level discovery rule) will not be cloned to the new host; instead they will be as on the template.\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe Host tab contains general host attributes:\n\nAll mandatory input fields are marked with a red asterisk.\n\nThe IPMI tab contains IPMI management attributes.\n\nThe Tags tab allows you to define host-level tags. All problems of this host will be tagged with the values entered here.\n\nUser macros, {INVENTORY.*} macros, {HOST.HOST}, {HOST.NAME}, {HOST.CONN}, {HOST.DNS}, {HOST.IP}, {HOST.PORT} and {HOST.ID} macros are supported in tags.\n\nThe Macros tab allows you to define host-level user macros as a name-value pairs. Note that macro values can be kept as plain text, secret text or Vault secret. Adding a description is also supported.\n\nYou may also view here template-level and global user macros if you select the Inherited and host macros option. That is where all defined user macros for the host are displayed with the value they resolve to as well as their origin.\n\nFor convenience, links to respective templates and global macro configuration are provided. It is also possible to edit a template/global macro on the host level, effectively creating a copy of the macro on the host.\n\nThe Inventory tab allows you to manually enter inventory information for the host. You can also select to enable Automatic inventory population, or disable inventory population for this host.\n\nIf inventory is enabled (manual or automatic), a green dot is displayed with the tab name.\n\nEncryption\n\nThe Encryption tab allows you to require encrypted connections with the host.\n\nValue mapping\n\nThe Value mapping tab allows to configure human-friendly representation of item data in value mappings.\n\nCreating a host group\n\nOnly Super Admin users can create host groups.\n\nTo create a host group in Zabbix frontend, do the following:\n\nGo to: Data collection â Host groups\n\nClick on Create host group in the upper right corner of the screen\n\nEnter the group name in the form\n\nTo create a nested host group, use the '/' forward slash separator, for example Europe/Latvia/Riga/Zabbix servers. You can create this group even if none of the three parent host groups (Europe/Latvia/Riga/) exist. In this case creating these parent host groups is up to the user; they will not be created automatically.\n\nLeading and trailing slashes, several slashes in a row are not allowed. Escaping of '/' is not supported.\n\nOnce the group is created, you can click on the group name in the list to edit group name, clone the group or set additional option:\n\nApply permissions and tag filters to all subgroups - mark this checkbox and click on Update to apply the same level of permissions/tag filters to all nested host groups. For user groups that may have had differing permissions assigned to nested host groups, the permission level of the parent host group will be enforced on the nested groups. This is a one-time option that is not saved in the database.\n\nPermissions to nested host groups"
