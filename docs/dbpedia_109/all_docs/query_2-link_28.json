Shorter URL’s are more effective and keeping the size within a limited number of characters is a safe method for SEO friendly URL’s. This tool is also handy for directory submissions as it helps control the size of your description. We use this tool whenever we submit clients to directories.\n\nThe recommended URL size is between 3 and 40 characters in length. The shorter the better. Some Search Engines do not like long URLs and the old Mac OS 9 systems only allowed 31 characters, hence many of our older clients used these shorter URLs successfully. Use either no spaces “yoururltitle” or hyphens “your-url-title” when naming URLs.\n\nFor HTML Titles to display in the search engines, the Max you can go is 70 characters or 60 in mobile.\n\nFor Meta Description Tags you should use 125-160 characters max.\n\nEnter your text, URL, meta tags below, then click \"Count\":"
