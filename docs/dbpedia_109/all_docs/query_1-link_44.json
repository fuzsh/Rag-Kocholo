Because lone surrogates in UTF-16 do not encode any valid Unicode character, they cause encodeURI() to throw a URIError.\n\nencodeURI() escapes all characters except:\n\nAâZ aâz 0â9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( ) ; / ? : @ & = + $ , #\n\nThe characters on the second line are characters that may be part of the URI syntax, and are only escaped by encodeURIComponent(). Both encodeURI() and encodeURIComponent() do not encode the characters -.!~*'(), known as \"unreserved marks\", which do not have a reserved purpose but are allowed in a URI \"as is\". (See RFC2396)\n\nThe encodeURI() function does not encode characters that have special meaning (reserved characters) for a URI. The following example shows all the parts that a URI can possibly contain. Note how certain characters are used to signify special meaning:"
