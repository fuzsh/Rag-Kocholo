This has the same value as Y, except that if the ISO week number (W) belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead. Examples: 1999 or 2003 X An expanded full numeric representation of a year, at least 4 digits, with - for years BCE, and + for years CE. Examples: -0055, +0787, +1999, +10191 x An expanded full numeric representation if required, or a standard full numeral representation if possible (like Y). At least four digits. Years BCE are prefixed with a -. Years beyond (and including) 10000 are prefixed by a +. Examples: -0055, 0787, 1999, +10191 Y A full numeric representation of a year, at least 4 digits, with - for years BCE. Examples: -0055, 0787, 1999, 2003, 10191 y A two digit representation of a year Examples: 99 or 03 Time --- --- a Lowercase Ante meridiem and Post meridiem am or pm A Uppercase Ante meridiem and Post meridiem AM or PM B Swatch Internet time 000 through 999 g 12-hour format of an hour without leading zeros 1 through 12 G 24-hour format of an hour without leading zeros 0 through 23 h 12-hour format of an hour with leading zeros 01 through 12 H 24-hour format of an hour with leading zeros 00 through 23 i Minutes with leading zeros 00 to 59 s Seconds with leading zeros 00 through 59 u Microseconds. Note that date() will always generate 000000 since it takes an int parameter, whereas DateTime::format() does support microseconds if DateTime was created with microseconds. Example: 654321 v Milliseconds. Same note applies as for u. Example: 654 Timezone --- --- e Timezone identifier Examples: UTC, GMT, Atlantic/Azores I (capital i) Whether or not the date is in daylight saving time 1 if Daylight Saving Time, 0 otherwise. O Difference to Greenwich time (GMT) without colon between hours and minutes Example: +0200 P Difference to Greenwich time (GMT) with colon between hours and minutes Example: +02:00 p The same as P, but returns Z instead of +00:00 (available as of PHP 8.0.0) Examples: Z or +02:00 T Timezone abbreviation, if known; otherwise the GMT offset. Examples: EST, MDT, +05 Z Timezone offset in seconds. The offset for timezones west of UTC is always negative, and for those east of UTC is always positive. -43200 through 50400 Full Date/Time --- --- c ISO 8601 date 2004-02-12T15:19:21+00:00 r » RFC 2822/» RFC 5322 formatted date Example: Thu, 21 Dec 2000 16:01:07 +0200"
