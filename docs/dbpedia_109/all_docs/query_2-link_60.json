        "text": "A character refers to any person, historical or generated, that is represented personally in Crusader Kings III. Every single character is an individual, living entity that will act individually and has the potential to change history. Characters can be either noble or lowborn, and landed or unlanded.\n\nNoble characters are members of a dynasty.\n\nLowborn characters are not members of a dynasty. If they are landed with a playable government title they will become noble and found a dynasty.\n\nLanded characters own at least one holding.\n\nUnlanded characters do not own any holdings; a character who Leases holdings (e.g. a Realm Priest) is considered an unlanded character.\n\nAppearance[edit | edit source]\n\nCharacters are depicted using a 3D portrait system. Every character's physical appearance is internally determined by a DNA system, which defines how they look: facial features, skin pigmentation, height, and hair color are all stored as DNA. This DNA is dynamically generated for courtiers, and can be directly edited with the Ruler Designer. DNA is stored as dominant and recessive genes and passed on to a character's children, affecting their appearance.\n\nAs Crusader Kings III covers a large portion of Eurasia and North Africa in its setting, characters can be from a diverse number of ethnicities: West/Central European, Northern European, Slavic, Arctic, Mediterranean, West African, East African, Arabic, Asian, North Indian, or South Indian.\n\nTheir appearance is further determined by age, weight, and certain congenital traits. Characters will age as years pass by, eventually growing old and withering away. Their appearance can also be adversely affected by illness or injury; battle wounds may scar their face, while disease can leave a ghastly impact on their visage.\n\nBarbershop[edit | edit source]\n\nPlayers can adjust the appearance of their ruler or ruler's family members via the Barbershop window. This allows hair and clothing to be changed, overriding the character's default appearance.\n\nSexual Orientation[edit | edit source]\n\nMale icon Female icon Preference Can form lover relations and have attraction opinion with Heterosexual Characters of the opposite sex Homosexual Characters of the same sex Bisexual Everyone Asexual No one\n\nA character's sexual orientation determines with which gender they will gain attraction opinion and can form lover relations. It is decided when the character is around 10 years old and cannot be changed. AI characters will never try to form a relation with characters that do not match their sexual orientation. Both the initial distribution of sexual orientation and the chance for children to gain a certain sexual orientation is determined by the sexuality distribution game rule.\n\nIf the child is played by a player, there is a 20% chance that the player will get to pick the gender preference.\n\nOpinion[edit | edit source]\n\nEach character has an opinion of every other character. The opinion the player character holds influences the success rate of certain actions that target another character while the opinion of AI characters also determines their behavior towards other characters.\n\nWhen a character dies, their primary heir will temporarily inherit part of the opinion of vassals towards the late liege, shown as Opinion of Predecessor.\n\nPositive opinion towards predecessor: 25% of opinion is inherited.\n\nNegative opinion towards predecessor: 50% of opinion is inherited.\n\nAttraction[edit | edit source]\n\nAttraction is an opinion modifier that can only be held towards characters one's sexual preference allows. Male characters aged above 65 years and female character above 50 years are not affected by attraction.\n\nRelations[edit | edit source]\n\nWhen certain requirements are met, two characters can have one of three types of relations, with each type having three levels. Relations have a great impact on how two characters act towards each other.\n\nChildhood relations can only be held between two child characters and might evolve into their corresponding adulthood relations when the characters reach adulthood\n\nAdulthood relations can be gained and lost as a result of events\n\nLifelong relations can only be obtained towards characters with an existing adulthood relation and each character can have only one of each lifelong relation\n\nRelation Childhood Adulthood Lifelong Can be ended manually Friendship Friend\n\n+60 opinion\n\nFriend\n\n+60 opinion\n\n+10 stress when character dies\n\nBest Friend\n\n+120 opinion\n\n+10 stress when character dies\n\nLove Crush\n\n+60 opinion\n\nLover\n\n+60 opinion\n\n+25% fertility\n\n+10 stress when character dies\n\nSoulmate\n\n+120 opinion\n\n+25% fertility\n\n+10 stress when character dies\n\nConflict Bully-Victim\n\n-20 opinion\n\nRival\n\n-60 opinion\n\n-35 stress when character dies\n\nNemesis\n\n-120 opinion\n\n-35 stress when character dies\n\nEmploying friends or rivals on your council impacts performance of some tasks\n\nFamily lifestyle focuses around befriending and getting bonuses from friends\n\nRitualized Friendship and some other traditions interact with friends and rivals\n\nTyranny[edit | edit source]\n\nTyranny is negative opinion gained by rulers who take unjust actions. It is felt by vassals and courtiers towards a liege. The maximum tyranny a character can have is 1000. Tyranny is not gained if the liege has a valid reason.\n\nAction Tyranny Successfully imprisoning a character +20 tyranny Increasing feudal obligations +20 tyranny per obligation without concession or hooks Revoking title without title revocation reason +20 tyranny Retracting a vassal +5 tyranny Banishing a vassal +5 tyranny Executing a vassal +10 tyranny Events Varies\n\nTyranny can be lost through certain events and most importantly through\n\nMonthly Decay:\n\nBy default tyranny decays by -0.25 each month\n\nThe 'Soon Forgiven' Duty lifestyle Tree perk provides -0.15 monthly Tyranny\n\nThe 'Venial' Guile Dynasty perk provides -0.05 monthly Tyranny\n\nAll tyrannical actions, events and the monthly decay can be affected by the following modifiers:\n\nSource Tyranny Gain Natural Primitivism (Tenet) +100% Chivalry Tradition +50% Legalistic Tradition +25% Generic Artifact Modifier +10% to +40% General Modifiers Varies Zomorrodnegar (Historical Artifact) -15% Callous (Trait) -20% Diplomatic Court Grandeur Level 4 Perk -20% The Palace of Aachen (Special Building) -20% Pursuit of Power (Tenet) -20% Jewelled Danda (Historical Artifact) -20% Defender of the Faith Theology Lifestyle Perk -25% Easy Difficulty -25% Very Easy Difficulty -75% General Modifiers and Artifacts Varies\n\nSource Tyranny Loss Domestic Affairs (Chancellor Task) ~+1% to ~+50% Generic Artifact Modifier +2% to +16% General Modifiers Varies Hereditary Hierarchy (Cultural Tradition) -50%\n\nWith the Torturer lifestyle perk Malice Implicit, characters gain +0.5 dread per tyranny.\n\nLegitimacy[edit | edit source]\n\nLegitimacy is a measure of a ruler character's right to rule. Legitimacy can be gained by acquiring titles, releasing valuable prisoners, taking certain decisions, creating legends, holding court, attending activities and winning wars, especially against rulers of higher title rank. These gains can be further modified, positively by having the Living Legend or Venerated Ancestor traits, or negatively if the character is a Bastard or a Legitimized Bastard.\n\nLegitimacy can be lost by losing titles, accepting faction demands, taking tyrannical actions, discovered hostile schemes, exposed secrets, excommunication, marrying Lowborn characters, plagues starting in the Domain, disinheriting dynasty members, and losing wars, especially civil wars - losses are also magnified for characters with a Disputed Heritage. When a ruler dies their heirs will inherit part of the Legitimacy depending on how close a relative they were to the previous ruler.\n\nEvery ruler starts with a certain amount of Legitimacy. This primarily scales with Dynasty Level of Splendor, as well as Court Grandeur if the ruler has a Royal Court. It is also increased by a a high Diplomacy skill and having the Just, Diplomat, Born in the Purple and Sayyid traits and reduced by having the Inbred trait or by being a gender that doesn't match the faith's View on Gender doctrine.\n\nLegitimacy is calculated on a scale ranging from 0 to 2800 and goes through 6 levels. How much Legitimacy is required for each level, and how much can be accumulated before excess is wasted, depends on the primary title rank and culture era. Each era will further increase the required Legitimacy for each level by half of the Legitimacy required for level 1.\n\nTribal era values are presented in the table:\n\nPrimary Title Rank\n\nLevel\n\nCounty Duchy Kingdom Empire Illegitimate 0 0 0 0 Aspiring 60 90 120 150 Recognized 140 210 280 350 Rightful 240 360 480 600 True 400 600 800 1000 Ordained 600 900 1200 1500 cap 700 1000 1400 1700\n\nA ruler will be expected to have a Legitimacy level at least equal to their title rank.\n\nBeing above expectations provides the following benefits.\n\nReduced short reign duration\n\nReduced cost for Claim casus belli\n\nIncreased marriage acceptance\n\nIncreased popular opinion\n\nIncreased alliance acceptance\n\nIncreased vassalization acceptance\n\nReduced claimant faction acceptance\n\nReduced cost for swinging scales of power\n\nReduced De Jure counties required to create titles\n\nIncreased Monthly Renown\n\nBeing at and especially below expectations provides the following penalties.\n\nIncreased short reign duration\n\nIncreased cost for Claim casus belli\n\nReduced marriage acceptance\n\nReduced vassalization acceptance\n\nReduced popular opinion\n\nReduced alliance acceptance\n\nIncreased claimant faction acceptance\n\nIncreased cost for swinging scales of power\n\nReduced Monthly Renown\n\nWhat are the exact bonuses and penalties scale with the primary title rank. A king one level above or below expectations will be affected more than a count, one level above or below expectations.\n\nDiplomatic range[edit | edit source]\n\nThe diplomatic range is the distance within which two characters can interact with each other. Neighboring realms are always within diplomatic range of each other, as well as realms separated by no more than three sea zones.\n\nThe first Dynasty Legacy from the Adventure Legacy Tree from Northern Lords DLC increases Diplomatic Range by 30%.\n\nThe Rock of Gibraltar increases Diplomatic Range by 20%.\n\nDiplomatic range map mode is only available in debug mode.\n\nNicknames[edit | edit source]\n\nNicknames are epithets granted to characters and are displayed either before or after a character's name. They are mainly gained through decisions and events.\n\nAI Personality[edit | edit source]\n\nAI characters will act based on the following attributes:\n\nBoldness: Characters with high Boldness are less affected by Dread and more likely to declare war on rulers of similar or higher strength, accept and propose Duels and take risks. Characters with low Boldness are more affected by Dread and more likely to declare war on weaker rulers, accept faction ultimatums and more reluctant to become an Agent in schemes, try to imprison Strong Vassals and take risks.\n\nCompassion: Characters with high Compassion are more likely to release prisoners (especially children), use the Promote Cultural Acceptance steward task, let people marry for love and make friends and more reluctant to harm others, use the Murder scheme, execute prisoners or torture prisoners. Characters with low Compassion are more likely to harm others, use Hostile schemes, become an Agent in schemes, execute prisoners or torture prisoners.\n\nGreed: Characters with high Greed will more often choose short-term gains, go on Raids, use the Collect Taxes steward task and betray other characters for and Titles and are more reluctant to pay ransom, send gifts, accept title revocations and end wars in White Peace. Characters with low Greed will more often spend Gold, pay ransom, send gifts, accept title revocations and host activities and are more reluctant to betray other characters for and Titles.\n\nHonor: Characters with high Honor are more likely to follow Laws and honor Alliances and more reluctant to blackmail characters with Secrets. Characters with low Honor are more likely to start hostile Schemes, blackmail characters with Secrets, use the Find Secrets spymaster task and betray their friends and spouses.\n\nRationality: Characters with high Rationality are more likely to use the Disrupt Schemes spymaster task, peace out of wars when they last more than 6 months and start Murder schemes against a liege with Tyranny and try to fix debts and are more reluctant to gain Tyranny. Characters with low Rationality are more likely to gain Tyranny, get into inopportune wars and continue wars for more than 6 months.\n\nSociability: determines how often the character will consider a character interaction.\n\nVengefulness: Characters will high Vengefulness will more often seek to harm Rivals and cheating Spouses, join as Agents in schemes targeting characters who slighted them and request Excommunication to punish criminals and will less often forgive slights and transgressions. Characters with low Vengefulness will more often forgive slights and transgressions, refuse to punish prisoners and pardon criminals and do not start hostile schemes targeting Rivals and cheating Spouses any more than other characters.\n\nZeal: Characters with high Zeal are more likely to join defensively against Holy Wars, pledge or donate to Great Holy Wars, convert counties or vassals, go on pilgrimages and take actions that grant Piety and more reluctant to convert to other faiths. Characters with low Zeal are more likely to ignore Faith in politics and use it as a tool and more reluctant to take actions that grant Piety or accept requests from rulers with Theocracy government.\n\nEach AI character will have its personality described with an adjective and a noun based on the highest amount of the value of two attributes. Children who do not have any traits yet will instead be described as Balanced.\n\nAttribute Very Negative (-76 to -100) Negative (-1 to -75) Positive (+1 to +75) Very Positive (+76 to +100) Adjective Noun Adjective Noun Adjective Noun Adjective Noun Boldness Spineless Craven Cowardly Coward Bold Gambler Fearless Adventurer Compassion Evil Villain Callous Brute Compassionate Altruist Gracious Empath Greed Content Lackey Content Follower Covetous Grasper Rapacious Ravener Honor Treacherous Blackguard Dishonorable Knave Honorable Gentleman / Gentlewoman Righteous Paragon Rationality Insane Maniac Irrational Fool Rational Thinker Analytic Planner Vengefulness Magnanimous Absolver Forgiving Conciliator Resentful Quarreler Vindictive Antagonist Zeal Godless Atheist Cynical Unbeliever Religious Believer Zealous Zealot\n\nLegends[edit | edit source]\n\nLegends represent important deeds that a character achieved in life. The story of the legend will be written in various events as the legend is being completed. Creating a legend costs 200 Gold if Count or Duke, 300 if King and 400 if Emperor, and it also has a monthly maintenance cost until it is completed. Legitimizing legends also cost 75 Prestige. A legend needs at least 5 years before it can be completed or abandoned. Each legend can only be created once.\n\nLegends are created from Legend Seeds. The primary way of obtaining Legend Seeds is by employing a Court Chronicler with high Aptitude. They can also be obtained by doing certain deeds or being part of a certain dynasty.\n\nWhen created, a legend can about either the ruler creating it or to one of its close or extended family members, living or dead, as long as they are at least 16 years old. If the protagonist is another character the ruler will gain +20 Legitimacy if the protagonist does not have a trait considered a virtue, and +50 if it does. Creating a legend also unlocks the Commission Legend Artifact decision.\n\nEach legend while being created will have an Owner and may have Promoters as well. Both will gain bonuses depending on the legend type and unlock the Spread Legend intent for certain activities.\n\nOwner is the ruler who starts the legend and gains the most bonuses. If the character dies any member of the same dynasty can take ownership of the legend from the Chronicle screen.\n\nPromoters are rulers that promote the legend, gaining fewer bonuses but only paying half of the maintenance cost of owning it. Promoting a legend requires one of the following:\n\nKnow the language of the legend's creator\n\nNeighbor with the legend's creator\n\nLover or Soulmate with the legend's creator\n\nFriend or Best Friend with the legend's creator\n\nLegends come in three types and three levels of quality, which together determine what benefits they give. When a legend is created it will start at Famed quality. Once it has spread to 100 Baronies it can be upgraded to Illustrious quality and once it has spread to 300 Baronies it can be upgraded to Mythical quality.\n\nQuality Benefits Heroic Holy Legitimizing\n\nFamed Owner\n\n+10% Prestige\n\n+100 Legitimacy\n\n50% chance unlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\n+10% Piety\n\n+100 Legitimacy\n\n50% chance unlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\n+0.1 Monthly Renown\n\n+5% Renown\n\n+200 Legitimacy\n\nGet an Unpressed Claim on every title de jure of the primary title\n\n50% chance unlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\nPromoter\n\n+2% Prestige\n\n+1 Martial\n\n+2% Piety\n\n+1 Learning\n\n+0.01 Monthly Renown\n\n+1 Stewardship\n\nCounty\n\n+5 Popular Opinion\n\n+5% Stationed Men-at-Arms Damage\n\n+5 Popular Opinion\n\n+0.1 Monthly Control\n\n+5 Popular Opinion\n\n+1% Development Growth\n\nIllustrious Owner\n\n+15% Prestige\n\n+1 Diplomacy per Level of Fame\n\n+200 Legitimacy\n\n50% chance unlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\nUnlocks the Launch a Legendary Adventure decision\n\n+15% Piety\n\n+1 Diplomacy per Level of Devotion\n\n+200 Legitimacy\n\n50% chance unlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\nUnlocks the Evangelize to the Realm decision\n\n+0.25 Monthly Renown\n\n+10% Renown\n\n+400 Legitimacy\n\nGet an Unpressed Claim on every title de jure of the primary title's kingdom\n\n50% chance unlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\nUnlocks the Expand the Kingdom decision\n\nPromoter\n\n+6% Prestige\n\n+2 Martial\n\n+4% Piety\n\n+2 Learning\n\n+0.04 Monthly Renown\n\n+2 Stewardship\n\nCounty\n\n+10 Popular Opinion\n\n+10% Stationed Men-at-Arms Damage\n\n+10 Popular Opinion\n\n+0.15 Monthly Control\n\n+10 Popular Opinion\n\n+2% Development Growth\n\nMythical Owner\n\n+25% Prestige\n\n+2 Diplomacy per Level of Fame\n\n+300 Legitimacy\n\nUnlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\nUnlocks the Launch a Legendary Adventure decision\n\nUnlocks the Demand Local Submission decision\n\n+25% Piety\n\n+2 Diplomacy per Level of Devotion\n\n+300 Legitimacy\n\nUnlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\nUnlocks the Evangelize to the Realm decision\n\nUnlocks the Reassert Holy Mission or Evangelize Pacifism decision\n\n+0.5 Monthly Renown\n\n+20% Renown\n\n+600 Legitimacy\n\nGet an Unpressed Claim on every title de jure of the primary title's empire\n\nUnlocks the Clear Grounds for a Legendary Building decision\n\nUnlocks the Consolidate the Kingdom decision\n\nPromoter\n\n+10% Prestige\n\n+4 Martial\n\n+10% Piety\n\n+4 Learning\n\n+0.1 Monthly Renown\n\n+4 Stewardship\n\nCounty\n\n+20 Popular Opinion\n\n+20% Stationed Men-at-Arms Damage\n\n+20 Popular Opinion\n\n+0.25 Monthly Control\n\n+20 Popular Opinion\n\n+6% Development Growth\n\nSources\n\nHaving a skilled Chancellor\n\nHaving the Crusader trait\n\nHaving the Mujahid trait\n\nHaving the Warrior of the Faith trait\n\nDefeating a commander with the Greatest of Khans trait\n\nKilling the animal of a Legendary Hunt\n\nHaving an Accolade and a Feast\n\nForming a new empire\n\nWinning a great holy war\n\nWinning a defense battle against a higher title rank ruler\n\nRaiding a barony that has a special building\n\nWinning a duel against an Emperor or Head of Faith\n\nWinning 3 Grand Tournaments\n\nHaving a skilled Chancellor\n\nHaving the Crusader trait\n\nHaving the Mujahid trait\n\nHaving the Warrior of the Faith trait\n\nHaving the Theologian trait\n\nHaving the Sayyid trait\n\nCompleting a Pilgrimage while the Pilgrim trait has enough experience\n\nHolding a holy site title\n\nReforming or creating a faith\n\nReaching the Religious Icon level of devotion\n\nConstructing a temple holding\n\nHaving a skilled Chancellor\n\nHeroic Bloodline dynasty legacy\n\nRoyal Court events\n\nGrand Wedding events\n\nCompleting a legend ends the Owner and Promoter bonuses but allows a new legend to be started.
