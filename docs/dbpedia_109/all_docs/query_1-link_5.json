ASCII used 7 bits for the character, and could only represent 128 different characters (English letters).\n\nFor a closer look, study our Complete ASCII Reference.\n\nWindows-1252 was first character set in Windows. It was a copy of ASCII, but used 8-bits to represent 256 different characters (international letters). Windows-1252 is supported by all browsers.\n\nFor a closer look, study our Complete Windows-1252 Reference.\n\nHTML 4: ISO-8859-1\n\nThe default character from HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01, was ISO-8859-1.\n\nISO-8859-1 is an extension to ASCII, with added international characters.\n\nExample\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1\">\n\nIn HTML 4, a character set different from ISO-8859-1 can be specified in the <meta> tag:\n\nExample\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=ISO-8859-8\">\n\nAll HTML 4 processors also support UTF-8:\n\nExample\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\">\n\nWhen a browser detects ISO-8859-1 it normally defaults to Windows-1252, because Windows-1252 has 32 more international characters.\n\nFor a closer look, please study: The Complete ISO-8859-1 Reference\n\nIn HTML5: Unicode UTF-8\n\nThe HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set.\n\nExample\n\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n\nA character-set different from UTF-8 can be specified in the <meta> tag:\n\nExample\n\n<meta charset=\"ISO-8859-1\">\n\nThe Unicode Consortium developed the UTF-8 and UTF-16 standards, because the ISO-8859 character-sets are limited, and not compatible a multilingual environment.\n\nThe Unicode Standard covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.\n\nAll HTML5 and XML processors support UTF-8, UTF-16, Windows-1252, and ISO-8859.\n\nFor a closer look, please study: The Complete Unicode Reference."
