        "text": "These are the official names for character sets that may be used in the Internet and may be referred to in Internet documentation. These names are expressed in ANSI_X3.4-1968 which is commonly called US-ASCII or simply ASCII. The character set most commonly use in the Internet and used especially in protocol standards is US-ASCII, this is strongly encouraged. The use of the name US-ASCII is also encouraged. The character set names may be up to 40 characters taken from the printable characters of US-ASCII. However, no distinction is made between use of upper and lower case letters. The MIBenum value is a unique value for use in MIBs to identify coded character sets. The value space for MIBenum values has been divided into three regions. The first region (3-999) consists of coded character sets that have been standardized by some standard setting organization. This region is intended for standards that do not have subset implementations. The second region (1000-1999) is for the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 coded character sets together with a specification of a (set of) sub-repertoires that may occur. The third region (>1999) is intended for vendor specific coded character sets. Assigned MIB enum Numbers ------------------------- 0-2 Reserved 3-999 Set By Standards Organizations 1000-1999 Unicode / 10646 2000-2999 Vendor The aliases that start with \"cs\" have been added for use with the IANA-CHARSET-MIB as originally defined in [RFC3808], and as currently maintained by IANA at [IANA registry ianacharset-mib]. Note that the ianacharset-mib needs to be kept in sync with this registry. These aliases that start with \"cs\" contain the standard numbers along with suggestive names in order to facilitate applications that want to display the names in user interfaces. The \"cs\" stands for character set and is provided for applications that need a lower case first letter but want to use mixed case thereafter that cannot contain any special characters, such as underbar (\"_\") and dash (\"-\"). If the character set is from an ISO standard, its cs alias is the ISO standard number or name. If the character set is not from an ISO standard, but is registered with ISO (IPSJ/ITSCJ is the current ISO Registration Authority), the ISO Registry number is specified as ISOnnn followed by letters suggestive of the name or standards number of the code set. When a national or international standard is revised, the year of revision is added to the cs alias of the new character set entry in the IANA Registry in order to distinguish the revised character set from the original character set."
