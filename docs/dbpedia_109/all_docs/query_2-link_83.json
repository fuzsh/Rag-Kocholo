        "text": "“The sharing of Nonconsensual Intimate Images can have devastating effects on victims and survivors. When images are shared online without consent, many victims feel ashamed, fear, guilt, and the actions of sharing nonconsensual intimate images can lead to real-world implications and dangers. The National Center for Victims of Crime is proud to support The Revenge Porn Helpline for providing a service that gives survivors choice and control back over their lives. We encourage all technology companies to support this effort and take the appropriate steps to ensure that their platforms take survivors’ privacy and safety into consideration when intimate images are attempting to be shared”\n\n\"We welcome the initiative made by StopNCII.org. In our helpline we talk with many people who have become victims of non-consensual intimate image sharing (NCII) or have been threatened with it. This new process will provide reassurance for many victims as well as potential victims, and dramatically reduce the amount of harmful content on Facebook and Instagram. We hope that this will inspire other social media companies to take similar action and that together we can make the online environment resilient to abuse.\"\n\nWe applaud StopNCII.org’s approach to actively equip potential victims of NCII with the tools to fight back by proactively fighting forward to overcome the powerlessness and hopelessness often associated with the trauma of tech facilitated intimate partner violence. For many victims at risk of exposure, having the choice to prevent or limit the virality of leaked sensitive images is a key step towards reducing harm, and a privilege that cannot be underestimated. By enabling the user to hash their own images, StopNCII.org addresses an important concern about trust & confidentiality.\n\n\"Victims of image-based abuse are diverse in their backgrounds, experiences and needs. Despite these differences, on the whole, victims have three key justice needs. First, they want greater recognition of the wrongfulness of the perpetrator’s actions and the harms they experience. Second, they want an array of options to choose between to help them get justice, support and resources. And third, perhaps most importantly, victims of image-based abuse want to reclaim control of their lives. Indeed, for many, a key priority is having their content removed or taken down quickly. The StopNCII.org scheme ticks all of those boxes. It is a victim-centric approach that seeks to not only communicate the wrongs and harms of image-based abuse to the broader community, but it also puts the power back into the hands of the victim. This also sends an important message to other technology companies that they too can better respond to image-based abuse. In my view, this updated scheme is a reflection of the creativity and possibilities of technological solutions that can help, alongside many other interventions, to fight against the scourge of online abuse and harassment.\"\n\n“One of the most devastating aspects of NCII for victim-survivors is the constancy of the threat that your intimate images will be shared without your consent or knowledge, and the trauma of wondering if today will be the day that happens. This initiative from the Revenge Porn Helpline directly responds to these harms and provides a mechanism to prevent NCII. As someone who has researched the harms of NCII for many years, I am so thrilled to see this innovative use of technology to disrupt and prevent NCII and I sincerely hope that all social media platforms, search engines, and websites get on board to support StopNCII.org and work together towards the eradication of NCII.”"
