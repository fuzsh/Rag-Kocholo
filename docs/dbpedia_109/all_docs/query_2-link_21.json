        "text": "Advanced Skill to Create Multiple Consistent Characters!\n\nChristie C.\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nBootcamp\n\n·\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 15, 2024\n\n--\n\nMidjourney has just released a new feature — a highly anticipated new capability called “Character References”. It allows you to specify a reference images that define the character you want to maintain across images.\n\n“Character Reference” works well with replicating one single character, what about Multiple Characters? 🎎\n\nIn this guide, I will share my 3 Advanced Skills to Master Character Consistency including generating multiple consistent characters like this image below.\n\nToday’s content will be broken down into three sections starting with a brief description of the new feature\n\nPart One: What is “Character Reference”\n\nPart Two: How to use “Character Reference”\n\nPart Three: 3 Advanced Tips to Use “Character Reference”\n\nPart One: What is “Character Reference” 🎨\n\n“Character Reference” allows us to create a character based on the image(s) of an existing character provided via URLs.\n\nIt aims to make the character match a reference image, allowing us to create a consistent character across images and in different styles.\n\nHighlight Features\n\n⚒️ Functionality: This feature is similar to regular image prompts except it ‘focuses’ on the character traits\n\n👉🏻 Use: Type --cref URL after your prompt with a URL to an image of a character\n\n📝 Format: /imagine text prompt --cref URL\n\n🖼️ Compatibility: Works for both Midjournvey V6 and Niji 6\n\nModify with --cw\n\nYou can use --cw to modify reference 'strength' from 0–100\n\n--cw 100 (default) uses the face, hair, and clothes\n\n--cw 0 focus on face\n\n📚 Quick Guide with 3 Tips\n\nLearn more about the basics including working on Midjourney website and using multiple references:\n\nMidjourney V6 NEW “Character Reference” is Here 🔥 Maintain Consistent Character\n\nA Quide to Maintain a Consistent Character for Storytelling, Styling and More!\n\nbootcamp.uxdesign.cc\n\nPart Two: How to use “Character Reference”\n\nStep 1: Choose Your Reference Image\n\nUse an image you generated with Midjourney or pick one online.\n\nStep 2: Upload an Image or Copy a URL\n\nUpload the images with the “+” side. Copy the image URL.\n\nStep 3: Type Your Prompt\n\nType/imagineas you usually do. Then, input your prompt to describe the image you want to generate and add--cref URL\n\n🔥Part Three: 3 Advanced Tips to Master Character Consistency\n\nYou can make more customization with parameters and prompt weight. In this section, I will go over a few tricks that you can use to adjust the style of your resulting image:\n\nTip 1: Transform Style with --cw\n\nTip 2: Create Multiple Consistent Characters with “Pan”\n\nTip 3: Create Multiple Consistent Characters in A Different Style\n\n⭐️ Advanced Tip One: Transform Style with --cw\n\nWith --cw, you can transform fictional characters into photographs, and vice-versa. You can use --cw to modify reference 'strength' from 100 to 0.\n\nFirst, let’s see how the weights affect the outcome.\n\n👉🏻 Here’s what --cw does:\n\n--cw 100 is default and uses the face, hair, and clothes\n\n--cw 99 to --cw 1 will begin to pick up less of the whole character\n\nAt Strength 0 --cw 0 will pick up ONLY the face\n\n👯‍♀️ Transform Style with --cw 0\n\nWith --cw 0, the system will focus on the face which is good for changing outfits/hair etc.\n\nThis works roughly like a “Face-Swap”. It is good for transforming a complete art style\n\nJust add the style to the prompt\n\n1. Cyberpunk style--cref URL --cw 0\n\n2. Digital patining of the girl drinking coffee--cref URL --cw 0\n\n3. A girl reading in the library --cref URL --cw 0\n\n4. A girl standing beside the neon light --cref URL --cw 0\n\n📌 With --cw 0, the system will prioritize the face, making it easier for you to adjust the hair, outfit, and overall art style.\n\n⭐️ Advanced Tip Two: Create Multiple Consistent Characters with “Pan”\n\nThe best way to put multiple “cref-based” characters in an image is to use “PAN” — a feature that expands the image canvas in a chosen direction\n\nLet’s start\n\nStep 1: Turn on High Variation Mode\n\nFirst, use /settings to turn “Remix mode” on, and select “High Variation Mode”.\n\n📌 This allows you to change your prompt when panning.\n\nStep 2: Select the image that will have a second character with it.\n\nFind the image and upscale the selected image with the “U” buttons\n\nStep 3: Use “Pan”\n\nUse “Pan” and select the direction ➡️⬅️⬆️⬇️ where the new character should go.\n\nStep 4: Add the second character by changing the prompt\n\nDescribe the scene and details of how you want the second character to appear in the image with a prompt and its --cref URL\n\nThe Result\n\nThis will stitch a new strip of canvas with the new character.\n\nRepeat the same steps with the same --cref URL\n\nYou can keep creating different scenes and add a second character with the same --cref URL of the guy\n\n📌 Tip:\n\nSometimes the image can look a bit awkward, try:\n\n- Add more details if you are looking for more precise generation.\n\n- Make adjustment with Vary”Region”\n\nHenrique Centieiro & Bee Lee has also published an article sharing another technique using “Vary Region”. Bee is an amazing writer for Midjourney. Feel free to check it out:\n\n👱🏻‍♂️👩🏻 Create Consistent *Multiple* Characters on MidJourney — Use This Simple Hack! ✨\n\nUnveiling the Powerful Hack I Discovered While Experimenting with MidJourney’s New “Character Reference” Feature\n\nhenriquecentieiro.medium.com\n\n⭐️ Advanced Tip Three: Create Multiple Consistent Characters in A Different Style\n\nHere is an even more advanced step to bring your creation to the next level!\n\nWe can change the overall styles of both characters while maintaining consistency like the image below.\n\nLet’s create a new style for each of the characters\n\nStep 1: Change the Style with --cw 0 ( refer back to Tip 1)\n\nRemember what we did with --cw 0. We can change the style for each of the characters and keep the face using --cw 0\n\nPrompt: In cyberpunk style --cref URL --cw 0\n\nStep 2: Save the New URL\n\nSave the URL for the male character which will be used with --cref\n\nStep 3: Pan the image of the lady\n\nUpscale the image of one of the characters. Repeat the steps of panning the image and enter a prompt with the new --cref URL.\n\nThis will stitch a new strip of canvas with the new character on it in a completely different style!\n\nAdd in more setting and dynamics with “Zoom” and “Vary Region”\n\nMore to Note for “Character Reference”\n\n✅ This feature works best when using characters made from Midjourney images. It’s not designed for real people/photos (and will likely distort them as regular image prompts do)\n\n✅ Cref works similarly to regular image prompts except it ‘focuses’ on the visual traits of the character\n\n✅ Character attributes work well with BIG attributes like curly hair, pink sunglasses\n\n❌ It won’t copy tiny details like exact dimples, freckles / or t-shirt logos.\n\nHey, Friends 👋 I am Christie — An AI Art Educator & Creator 😊 Also a coffee lover ❤️☕️\n\nIf you’re craving more Insider Tips, Prompts and Tricks for creating and generating income with AI art, join me on this journey.\n\n🎨 Hit that “Follow” button to stay in the loop for more AI wisdom\n\n💌 Stay tuned for more tutorials & Midjourney updates!\n\nLet’s explore the limitless possibilities of AI together! 🚀"
