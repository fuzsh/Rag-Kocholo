        "text": "Regarding the “summary” line (the 50 in your formula), the Linux kernel documentation has this to say:\n\nFor these reasons, the \"summary\" must be no more than 70-75 characters, and it must describe both what the patch changes, as well as why the patch might be necessary. It is challenging to be both succinct and descriptive, but that is what a well-written summary should do.\n\nThat said, it seems like kernel maintainers do indeed try to keep things around 50. Here’s a histogram of the lengths of the summary lines in the git log for the kernel:\n\n(view full-sized)\n\nThere is a smattering of commits that have summary lines that are longer (some much longer) than this plot can hold without making the interesting part look like one single line. (There’s probably some fancy statistical technique for incorporating that data here but oh well… :-)\n\nIf you want to see the raw lengths:\n\ncd /path/to/repo git shortlog | grep -e '^ ' | sed 's/[[:space:]]\\+\\(.*\\)$/\\1/' | awk '{print length($0)}'\n\nor a text-based histogram:\n\ncd /path/to/repo git shortlog | grep -e '^ ' | sed 's/[[:space:]]\\+\\(.*\\)$/\\1/' | awk '{lens[length($0)]++;} END {for (len in lens) print len, lens[len] }' | sort -n\n\nSeparation of presentation and data drives my commit messages here.\n\nYour commit message should not be hard-wrapped at any character count and instead line breaks should be used to separate thoughts, paragraphs, etc. as part of the data, not the presentation. In this case, the \"data\" is the message you are trying to get across and the \"presentation\" is how the user sees that.\n\nI use a single summary line at the top and I try to keep it short but I don't limit myself to an arbitrary number. It would be far better if Git actually provided a way to store summary messages as a separate entity from the message but since it doesn't I have to hack one in and I use the first line break as the delimiter (luckily, many tools support this means of breaking apart the data).\n\nFor the message itself newlines indicate something meaningful in the data. A single newline indicates a start/break in a list and a double newline indicates a new thought/idea.\n\nThis is a summary line, try to keep it short and end with a line break. This is a thought, perhaps an explanation of what I have done in human readable format. It may be complex and long consisting of several sentences that describe my work in essay format. It is not up to me to decide now (at author time) how the user is going to consume this data. Two line breaks separate these two thoughts. The user may be reading this on a phone or a wide screen monitor. Have you ever tried to read 72 character wrapped text on a device that only displays 60 characters across? It is a truly painful experience. Also, the opening sentence of this paragraph (assuming essay style format) should be an intro into the paragraph so if a tool chooses it may want to not auto-wrap and let you just see the start of each paragraph. Again, it is up to the presentation tool not me (a random author at some point in history) to try to force my particular formatting down everyone else's throat. Just as an example, here is a list of points: * Point 1. * Point 2. * Point 3.\n\nHere's what it looks like in a viewer that soft wraps the text.\n\nThis is a summary line, try to keep it short and end with a line break.\n\nThis is a thought, perhaps an explanation of what I have done in human readable format.

However, unless I have the chance to set the style, I usually follow what's been done for consistency.\n\nTaking a look at the Linux Kernel Commits, the project that started git if you like, http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=bca476139d2ded86be146dae09b06e22548b67f3, they don't follow the 50/72 rule. The first line is 54 characters.\n\nI would say consistency matters. Set up proper means of identifying users who've made commits (user.name, user.email - especially on internal networks. User@OFFICE-1-PC-10293982811111 isn't a useful contact address). Depending on the project, make the appropriate detail available in the commit. It's hard to say what that should be; it might be tasks completed in a development process, then details of what's changed.\n\nI don't believe users should use git one way because certain interfaces to git treat the commits in certain ways.\n\nI should also note there are other ways to find commits. For a start, git diff will tell you what's changed. You can also do things like git log --pretty=format:'%T %cN %ce' to format the options of git log."
