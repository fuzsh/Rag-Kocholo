If none is specified the default HttpClient header is used Request Compression Selects the request compression type Response Compression Indicates if compressed responses from hosts are accepted Disable Response Decompression Disables decompression of compressed responses Close connections after request Disables HTTP Keep-Alives by requesting to close the HTTP connection after each request. This will have a negative impact on performance but may give more realistic values during load testing Chunking Threshold Using content-chunking for requests larger than thresholds, blank to disable Authenticate Preemptively Send Authentication headers with each request without first receiving an authentication challenge. This is a potential security hazard but will improve performance since only one request will be required for authenticated endpoints instead of two Expect-Continue Adds Expect-Continue header to outgoing request.For further info on this feature check rfc 2616 Preencoded Endpoints Do not URL-encode endpoints, set this if your endpoint URLs are already URL-encoded (containing for example %20 or %3A) Bind Address The local address to bind to when sending requests, can be overridden on a request level (with the corresponding request property) and on a system level by setting the soapui.bind.address system variable. Include request in time taken Includes the time it took to write the request in time-taken Include response in time taken Includes the time it took to read the response body in time-taken Socket Timeout The socket timeout for HTTP requests in milliseconds Max Response Size The maximum number of bytes to read from a response (0 = unlimited) Max Connections Per Host The maximum number of simultaneous connections to a specific host. Increase this value if you are running LoadTests with more than 500 threads on a particular host. Max Total Connections The total maximum number of connections. Increase this value if you are running LoadTests with more than 2000 threads. Leave MockEngine Will leave the MockEngine running even when all MockServices have stopped resulting in much faster startup-times for new MockServices and 404 errors when trying to call a stopped MockService (instead of connection failure) Enable Mock HTTP Log Logs wire content of all mock requests. Selecting this option will degrade Mock Engine performance marginally and may require restart to enable or disable. Option Description Proxy setting How the proxy is determined. Automatic tries to automatically determine proxy by looking at Java settings, environment variables, browser settings and operating system settings. None turns off the proxy. Manual uses the host, port and excludes entered below. Host The HTTP Proxy host to use (only applicable for manual proxy). Port The HTTP Proxy port to use (only applicable for manual proxy). Excludes A comma-separated list of hosts to exclude, for example \"127.0.0.1:8080,myserver.com\" will not use a proxy for 127.0.0.1 on port 8080 and myserver.com on any port (only applicable for manual proxy). Username The username sent for proxy authentications Password The password sent for proxy authentications Option Description Cache WSDLs Turns on and off caching of WSDL's (Read Reference Caching Definitions Sample Values Generates example values in requests when creating from schema Type Comment Generates comments with type information in new requests Include Optional Always includes optional elements in generated requests Pretty Print Pretty prints response messages in response editor Attachment Parts Generates part-elements in request messages for mime-attachments in RPC messages (required by some ws-stacks) No Content-Type Validation Does not validate the content-type of a mime-attachment against the type(s) specified in the SOAP-Binding Schema Directory Specifies a directory containing schema (.xsd) files that should be automatically added when parsing or validating wsdl or requests. Changing the contents of this directory requires a restart. Name with Binding Tells SoapUI to name imported interfaces with the name of their corresponding soap/http binding, and not with their portType (Read Reference Interfaces). This ensures that WSDL containing bindings for both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 will get unique names during import. This setting defaults to true. Excluded Types A list of XML-Schema types and global elements in the form of name@namespace which will be used when generating sample requests and responses and input forms in the ReadyAPI Form editor. By default the XML-Schema root element is added since it is quite common in .NET services and generates a sample xml fragment of about 300 kb!. Strict Schema Types Check this to not allow schema type redefinitions in included/imported xsd:s for a specific WSDL (default behavior in versions prior to 1.7.5) Compression Limit The minimum message size to compress in the SoapUI project file for preserving space. Compression is performed with gzip and the result is base64 encoded into the project file. For large requests, this can save up to 90% file-space, but be aware that the requests are no longer readable or diffable. Pretty Print Project Files Pretty prints project files when they are saved, which makes it easier to work with a source-control system (diffing, etc...). Be aware that when selecting this option the size of the project files will increase substantially and also cached WSDLs and XSDs will be pretty-printed."
