        "text": "The Neuquén Basin, located at the foothills of the Central Andes of Argentina, with superb and extended exposures is a natural laboratory. It is important not only for its continuous sedimentary record and superb palaeontological biota but also for its significant economic hydrocarbon resources. This synthesis is intended to provide an update only on the Cretaceous timespan in the basin development. It is characterized by a succession of sedimentary rocks that were deposited in different environments over time, interspersed with volcanic rocks associated with an active volcanic arc. High-precision geochronology dating on the tuffs establishes robust chronological ages to constrain the different stages. As this brief review only shows a fragment of the information presently available, an effort has been made to compile a comprehensive and up-to-date bibliography to compensate for the brevity of the text.\n\nDespite the paleontological relevance and paleobiological interest of trigoniid bivalves, our knowledge of their ontogeny—an aspect of crucial evolutionary importance—remains limited. Here, we assess the intra- and interspecific ontogenetic variations exhibited by the genus Steinmanella Crickmay (Myophorellidae: Steinmanellinae) during the early Valanginian–late Hauterivian of Argentina and explore some of their implications. The (ontogenetic) allometric trajectories of seven species recognized for this interval were estimated from longitudinal data using 3D geometric morphometrics, segmented regressions, and model selection tools, and then compared using trajectory analysis and allometric spaces. Our results show that within-species shell shape variation describes biphasic ontogenetic trajectories, decoupled from ontogenetic changes shown by sculpture, with a gradual decay in magnitude as ontogeny progresses. The modes of change characterizing each phase (crescentic growth and anteroposterior elongation, respectively) are conserved across species, thus representing a feature of Steinmanella ontogeny; its evolutionary origin is inferred to be a consequence of the rate modification and allometric repatterning of the ancestral ontogeny. Among species, trajectories are more variable during early ontogenetic stages, becoming increasingly conservative at later stages. Trajectories’ general orientation allows recognition of two stratigraphically consecutive groups of species, hinting at a potentially higher genus-level diversity in the studied interval. In terms of functional morphology, juveniles had a morphology more suited for active burrowing than adults, whose features are associated with a sedentary lifestyle. The characteristic disparity of trigoniids could be related to the existence of an ontogenetic period of greater shell malleability betrayed by the presence of crescentic shape change.\n\nThe last review of Asteriacites (Knaust and Neumann 2016) dismissed sculpture as an ichnotaxobase for this ichnogenus and used simple morphometric parameters to differentiate the ichnospecies, reducing them to three: A. lumbricalis, A. stelliformis, and A. quinquefolius. In this work, ichnotaxonomic tools are discussed through the analysis of trace fossils assigned to this ichnogenus from the Mulichinco Formation (Valanginian) of the Neuquén Basin, northern Patagonia. New Asteriacites-bearing levels from different localities are described, and specimens that were previously assigned to A. lumbricalis are reassigned to A. stelliformis. Taking into account this material and previous works where Asteriacites were analysed, we observed that some problems arise in the ichnospecific assignment when applying the methodology of Knaust and Neumann (2016). Therefore, in this work, three simple criteria were incorporated to facilitate the ichnospecific assignment through this morphometric approach. It is also noted that the specimens with epirelief preservation are challenging to identify because the delineation of the edge of the trace, necessary for the morphometric analysis, depends on the used methodology. Additionally, examples of previous works are analysed, allowing discussion of proposed ichnospecific ichnotaxobases and the relevance of sculpture. RESUMEN Análisis de Asteriacites von Schlotheim 1820 de la Formación Mulichinco (Cretácico Inferior, Cuenca Neuquina) y las implican-cias icnotaxonómicas. La última revisión de Asteriacites (Knaust y Neumann, 2016) descartó a la ornamentación como icnotaxobase para este icnogénero y diferenció las icnoespecies en base a parámetros morfométricos simples, reduciendo las válidas a tres: A. lumbricalis, A. stelliformis y A. quinquefolius. En este trabajo se discuten las herramientas icnotaxonómicas a través del análisis de trazas fósiles pertenecientes al icnogénero provenientes de la Formación Mulichinco (Valanginiano) de la Cuenca Neuquina, en Patagonia septentrional. Se des-criben nuevos niveles de Asteriacites de distintas localidades y Asteriacites previamente asignadas a A. lumbricalis son reasignadas a A. stelliformis. Teniendo en cuenta trabajos previos donde se analizan especímenes del icnogénero, surgieron algunos problemas al momento de asignar icnoespecificamente al aplicar la metodología de Knaust y Neumann (2016). Por lo tanto, se han incorporado tres criterios simples para facilitar la asignación icnoespecífica a través de un enfoque morfométrico. También se observa la dificultad de la asignación icnotaxonómica en los ejemplares preservados en epirrelieve negativo debido a que la delimitación del borde de la traza fósil, necesaria para el análisis morfométrico, dependerá de la metodología utilizada. A su vez, se analizaron ejemplares de trabajos previos, permitiendo discutir las icnotaxobases icnoespecíficas propuestas y la relevancia de la ornamentación.\n\nOysters are very abundant in marine Jurassic-Cretaceous deposits across the world, which has led to multiple taxonomic studies since the nineteenth century. In contrast, South American Jurassic eCretaceous oysters have been largely neglected in the literature. Here, focus is on Berriasian-Valanginian oysters from previously undocumented benthic faunas of southern Mendoza (Neuqu en Basin, Argentina). Four species belonging to three genera of the Family Gryphaeidae, Subfamily Exogirinae are described, including their shell microstructure characterization, and their taxonomic status is discussed. Of the studied genera, Aetostreon and Ceratostreon have been widely recorded in the Neuquen Basin previously, whereas the genus Nanogyra is recorded for the first time in Argentina. Aetostreon is represented by A. subsinuatum and A. latissimum, and Ceratostreon and Nanogyra by C. hilli and N. (N.) brevisulcata n. sp. The oldest worldwide records of A. subsinuatum (Berriasian) and C. hilli (Valanginian) are documented here. The paleobiogeographic distribution of these species suggests a Tethyan distribution for A. subsinuatum and A. latissimum and a Trans-Temperate-Pacific distribution for C. hilli, while N. (N.) brevisulcata is endemic to the basin. The three genera appear as isolated records and different types of oyster mass occurrences (OMOs), classified according to its lateral extension, geometry, maximum thickness, and stratigraphic relevance. The different hierarchy of the OMOs could possibly represent different scales of palaeoenvironmental and/or stratigraphic changes, from basin-wide to local level, and could provide tools to identify variations in palaeoenvironmental parameters such as sedi-mentation rate, siliciclastic and nutrient input and salinity variations.\n\nSclerobiont communities have proven their environmental and taphonomic value in extant and past settings; studies are beginning to quantify and evaluate their changes across time. Through the Valanginian of the Neuquén Basin, Argentina, trigonioids of the genus Steinmanella present an almost continuous record. Materials were collected from shales and shell beds across second‐order systems tracts (LST, TST and HST). Their sclerobiont communities were characterized and compared across systems tracts and facies. In addition, a link between them and coeval oyster mass occurrences (OMOs) was investigated, since studies on other local sclerobiont communities have consistently shown pronounced oyster dominance. Eleven sclerobiont taxa were found on Steinmanella (bryozoans, bivalves, foraminifers and polychaetes), of which oysters are usually strongly dominant but for the TST, in which their dominance is diminished. The sclerobiont community has a simple structure and interspecific relationships and competition for space seem to have had little importance. Few differences in richness, taxonomy and other parameters were found between facies. Across systems tracts, features of the sclerobiont communities are differentiated mostly from swings in relative abundance of taxa. The lowered oyster dominance in the TST may reflect a source–sink dynamics between OMOs (sources) and Steinmanella as sinks in shallower, soft substrate settings. Likely the sea‐level rise temporally drowned the oyster carbonate factory, resulting in decreased larvae emigration to the sinks and lowered oyster dominance during the TST.\n\nIntegrated analysis of the transition between Vaca Muerta and Quintuco Formations and it´s paleoenvironmental implication in the Puerta Curaco section, Neuquén Basin The Vaca Muerta-Quintuco system in the Puerta Curaco section (northern Neuquén Basin), consists of a 716 m thick shallowing-upward cycle deposited from early Tithonian to early Valanginian. The Vaca Muerta Formation represents a world-class unconventional play since 2010, nevertheless, there is not agreement on the stratigraphic position of the top of Vaca Muerta Formation yet. This contribution provides a stratigraphic analysis of the vertical transition (35 m) between the Vaca Muerta and the Quintuco Formations, including sedimentological, geochemical and mineralogical analysis. The transition interval is characterized by: 1) an increase of calcareous shales compared to the underlying unit 2) a broad and smooth peak of Gamma-Ray associated to high values of K and Th 3) an increase in clay minerals (illite, chlorite and mixed-layered illite/smectite) when compared to the underlying unit 4) relative low values of Mo and U, suggesting a decrease in the organic content and 5) complete dolomitization of the limestones beds. These observations indicate an important change in the paleoenvironmental conditions, suggesting an increase in detrital sedimentation and the emplacement of a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system. These changes are associated to a pronounced sea-level fall, based on the configuration of regional seismic data. The high-resolution insights derived from this study in Puerta Curaco section may be used to gain further knowledge in the subsurface sections where the lack of core in the key stratigraphic sections hampers such inferences.\n\nThe trigoniid group \"Pseudo-Quadratae\" was introduced for Cretaceous descendents of Myophorellidae with a convergent resemblance to Tethyan Quadratotrigoniinae (= Quadratae). Subsequently it was made the basis of the subfamily Steinmanellinae, which herein is elevated to family rank. The earliest record of the group is from the Early-Middle Kimmeridgian of the Tethyan Realm (American Province), from where it spread into the Boreal and Gondwanic realms. Steinmanellids rose to dominance in the cool temperate waters of the Andean Province, and the latter represents their centre of diversification. They are absent from the predominantly cold circum-polar waters of Southern and Eastern Gondwana, i.e. the Antarctic and Maorian provinces, as well as from the Australasian Province. The evolution of the group is tracked and two lineages identified, comprising 47 nominal species assigned to 14 genera, 9 of which are new: Stoyanowella, Philippiella, Garatella, Weaverella, Neuquenella, Pseudoyaadia, Popenoella, Louella, and Tashiroella. One lineage (Yaadiinae nov.) migrated northwards from its Tethyan origin into the Cordilleran Province of the Boreal Realm and thence, in the Late Cretaceous, to the Oriental Province, surviving in both biochores into the Maastrichtian. The second lineage, the subfamily Steinmanellinae, appeared in the Early-Middle Kimmeridgian of the American Province, but its centre of diversification was in the Andean Province where it appeared in the Early Tithonian and survived until the Late Hauterivian. From there it migrated eastwards into the Ethiopian Province, reaching as far as India, where it is recorded only from the Late Valanginian and Barremian. © 2017 E.

A modern systematic review of the late early Tithonian - early middle Tithonian ammonoids of the Vaca Muerta Formation was conducted, focusing on perisphinctids (Superfamily Perisphinctoidea) the main components of the ammonoid assemblages. This revision was based on new fields collections and the assessing of reference type material. As a result, nine species included in four genera are identified, described and grouped into one family (Ataxioceratidae) and two subfamilies (Lithacoceratinae and Virgatosphinctinae). Subfamily Lithacoceratinae is represented by the monospecific genus Indansites (gen. nov.) and the species I. malarguensis Spath, 1925. Subfamily Virgatosphinctinae includes the genus Virgatosphinctes Uhlig, 1910b with V. andesensis (Douvillé, 1910a) and V. (?) densistriatus (Steuer, 1897); the genus Pseudinvoluticeras Spath, 1925 with P. douvillei Spath, 1925 and Pseudinvoluticeras primordialis n. sp.; and the genus Choicensisphinctes Leanza, H. 1980 with Ch. choicensis (Burckhardt, 1903), Ch. erinoides (Burckhardt, 1903), Ch. n. sp. aff. Ch. erinoides and Ch. aconcaguensis n. sp. The new name Virgatosphinctes andesensis Assemblage Zone is here proposed to replace the former Virgatosphinctes mendozanus Assemblage Zone of the Andean Tithonian. Also, a tentative biostratigraphic subdivision of this biozone into two consecutive Interval Subzones, Pseudinvoluticeras primordialis to the base and Indansites malarguensis to the top, is proposed. Both Interval Subzones can be partially correlated with Darwini and Semiforme Zones of the European standard, indicating a late early Tithonian - early middle Tithonian age for the V. andesensis Assemblage Zone. In addition, synchronicity of the Tithonian transgression in the Neuquén Basin is sustained through the existence of a taxonomically homogeneous ammonoid assemblage in the lower portion of all the Vaca Muerta Formation sections studied."
