You can drag it to the desktop if you want to keep it open as you work.\n\nWhen you find the character, click it to insert it into the text.\n\nIf the full Character Viewer is open on the desktop, you may need to double-click the character. The Character Viewer always opens in the state it was in when it was last closed. If it’s expanded and you want it to be in pop-up view the next time you open it, click the button in the top-right corner to close the expanded view.\n\nSelect the text you want to change . To change all of the text in a text box, select the text box.\n\nNote: To change individual glyphs, you must select the specific characters to be changed."
