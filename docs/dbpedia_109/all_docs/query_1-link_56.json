        "text": "What is the difference between a number, numeral, digit, and character? Let’s find out.\n\nNumber\n\nA number is an idea of quantity. It is the abstract form of a quantity.\n\nFor instance, suppose you think of the quantity of novels you’ve read. In such a case, your thought (of the quantity of novels) is a number.\n\nThere are different ways to translate a number (your thought of quantity) into its physical form.\n\nFor instance, you can relate the quantity of novels with your fingers, pieces of bones, tapping the table, symbols, numerals, and so on.\n\nNumeral\n\nA numeral is the written form of a number.\n\nIn other words, suppose you express a number as a writable character. In that case, the character you used to represent the number is the numeral.\n\nFor instance, the following are numerals used to express the number seven:\n\n7 (Hindu-Arabic numeral)\n\nVII (Roman numeral)\n\n111 (Binary numeral)\n\nDigit\n\nA digit is each individual character of a numeral—for instance, 794 consists of the digits 7, 9, and 4.\n\nCharacter\n\nA character is a writable (or printable) mark.\n\nSome examples of characters are as follows:\n\nAlphabetical letters (For instance, a, g, and z)\n\nDigits (For example, 0, 5, and 9)\n\nPunctuations (For instance, semicolon (;), question mark (?), and colon (:))\n\nIn the image above, digits 7, 9, and 4 are digital characters."
