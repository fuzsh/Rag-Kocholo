        "text": "Overview\n\nMy research focuses on critical theory, continental philosophy, theoretical psychoanalysis and film, as reflected in my recent publications, including the following volumes: Unworkable: Delusions of an Imploding Civilization (SUNY Press, 2022); Crisi di valore: Lacan, Marx e il crepuscolo della societa' del lavoro (Mimesis, 2018); Critical Theory and the Crisis of Contemporary Capitalism (Bloomsbury, 2015; co-authored with Heiko Feldner), States of Crisis and Post-Capitalist Scenarios (Ashgate, 2014; co-edited with Heiko Feldner and Slavoj Žižek), Critical Theory and Film: Rethinking Ideology through Film Noir (Continuum, 2012), On Žižek's Dialectics: Surplus, Subtraction, Sublimation (Continuum, 2010).\n\nMy current research focuses on the ideology of 'emergency capitalism' in connection with the analysis of global challenges currently faced by the capitalist mode of production. Alongside ideology critique and political economy, I am interested in psychoanalytic theory (Freud and Lacan), Hegelian dialectics, and film. I am co-director of the 'Žižek Centre for Ideology Critique' and warmly welcome enquiries and proposals for postgraduate research on any of the above themes and disciplines."
