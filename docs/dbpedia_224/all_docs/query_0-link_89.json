But back in the 60s they could land Jane Fonda to elevate their go-go porn sketch comedy movies and walk around with their heads held high, smiling the way the British do when they think about eating dry beans on wet cabbage. Every scene in this movie is a surreal puzzle that reveals itself to varying speeds and the solution is always for Barbarella to fuck somebody or something. Secretly or not, this is what we miss about the 60s. Every once in awhile weâ€™ll poke our head out toâ€¦\n\nðŸŽ¶ sheâ€™s got a Barbarella silver swimsuit and when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams ðŸŽ¶\n\nproof that sometimes a movie can succeed purely on the power of vibes and Jane Fonda\n\n100\n\nOh, the kitsch! Barbarella is a dream-movie for me - the kind you imagine in your slumber and in your greatest fantasies but never expect to be made, much less come to fruition with such knowing heart, astonishment, and grace. Its regressive/progressive subtext indicates a fascinating tension between the vitality and agency of the female body and the society in which it was produced, depicting Barbarella as a free spirit - kind, gentle, sexy, capable - still constrained and owned by the state. It's a distressing time-capsule all wrapped up in one of the cheapest, most wacko space environments ever committed to film; an odyssey constructed out of tactile fads and psychedelic phenomena. Love and energy burst through every frame from the excitement of simply being - no film has been happier to be itself.\n\ni knew going in that duran duran have a banger called \"electric barbarella\" but i did NOT know that their band name is a reference to the bad scientist man in this movie, durand durand (half of the d's are not pronounced very clearly by anyone), and then when i read their wikipedia page i also learned that the two founders of the band worked at a nightclub called barbarella's. all this lore for WHY\n\nanyway this movie has 8 writers"
