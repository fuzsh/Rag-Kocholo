Noted director Sam Peckinpah has a small, rare acting role. The film was shot in locations in Spain and Italy by cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno. Pino Donaggio composed the musical score. The English title refers to a sign seen at the beginning of the movie on U.S. Route 90 in Beaumont, Texas. Monte Hellman, utilized the scenic location of the highway to enhance the authenticity of its setting. Its inclusion adds an interesting detail to the narrative and showcases the attention to detail in the production. The film had a very sparse theatrical release in the United States, and did not play in some cities until as late as 1984.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nGunslinger Clayton Drumm is in jail, about to be hanged, when railroad company men offer him a chance to live if he will agree to murder Matthew Sebanek, a miner who has steadfastly refused to sell his land to the railroad.
