Castellari's last crime film of the 1970s.[2] The film was shot in Rome, Genoa, Cartagena, Amsterdam and New York.[1]\n\nThe score of the film was provided by the Italian progressive rock group Goblin who had just written their score for Dario Argento's film Suspiria.[1][3][4] The score is composed of funk, psychedelia, and rock music.[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nFabio Testi as Fabio\n\nDavid Hemmings as Mike Hamilton\n\nSherry Buchanan as Vera\n\nWolfango Soldati as Gilo\n\nMassimo Vanni as Massimo\n\nAngelo Ragusa as Dealer\n\nRomano Puppo as Gianni's Assassin\n\nSergio Ruggeri as Sergio\n\nJoshua Sinclair as Gianni, the boss\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Heroin Busters was released in Italy on August 13, 1977.[1] It was distributed by Titanus and grossed 1,308,550,110 Italian lira.[1] Roberto Curti, author of Italian Crime Filmography, 1968-1980 described the box office gross as performing \"moderately well\", but not as well as expected.[3]\n\nIt was released on DVD by Blue Underground on April 25, 2006.[1][5]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nAmong modern reviews, AllMovie gave the film three stars out of five, referring to it as \"a stylish and fast-paced entry into the Italian crime genre that hits all the right marks for genre fans.\" as well as noting \"The one real defect of La Via Della Droga is that it lacks a human story element to get the viewer emotionally involved but Castellari makes up for that oversight by keeping the story taut and fast-paced.\"[2] Roberto Curti, author of Italian Crime Filmography, 1968-1980, compared the film Casterllari's The Big Racket, stating that unlike that film \"the result is a cold, technically impeccable yet overindulgent formalist exercise in style\" that contained a \"comic book-style script, populated by dull characters\"[3]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Italian films of 1977\n\nList of crime films of the 1970s\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nCurti, Roberto (2013).
