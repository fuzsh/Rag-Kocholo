Film critic Morando Morandini started his review writing \"\"It's a fascist film. It's a vile film. It's an idiot film\" and subsequently criticized the violent and \"reactionary\" morality of the film.[4]\n\nIn his book Italian Crime Filmography, Roberto Curti referred to the film as Castellari's best work and praised the action scenes in the film stating that they \"outdo anything that had been done in Italy until then\" and that \"Castellari pulls out all the stops.\" Castellari stated that when the film was shown at retrospectives, someone always asks him how he shot the scene where Fabio Testi is trapped in a car while vehicle is tumbling down a ditch. Castellari also considers the ending of the film as the best one he has ever shot. AllMovie noted that the films \"clever script\" that builds \"up in tension and brutality until it reaches its explosive finale.\"[6] The review praised the acting of Fabio Testi, Vincent Gardenia and Renzo Palmer and praised the direction of Castellari stating that he \"directs the film with his trademark kinetic sense of style, keeping up a sharp pace that blends action with quieter, more atmospheric, moments and deploying bursts of slow motion at just the right time during action scenes\" [6]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Italian films of 1976\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
