        "text": "The Mauser C96 (commonly called the \"Broomhandle\" or \"Broomhandle Mauser\" due to its distinctive grip), was a German semi-automatic pistol, developed in 1893-1895, and manufactured from 1896 to circa 1937. The C96 Mauser was one of the first semi-automatic pistols to see widespread use and was copied in Spain and China. In China, C96 and variants have the nickname \"box cannon,\" with various explanations for this being either the weapon's weight (2 pounds heavier than the 9mm or 7.63mm variants), its boxy appearance, and / or its ability to be stowed inside its own stock.\n\nOne particular point of interest with the C96 is that the weapon is entirely held together through the fit of the parts: there are no pins and only one screw in the entire gun, the one that holds the grip panels on. One unfortunate aspect of this construction is that the barrel and the rest of the upper are a single forging: many vintage 7.63x25mm Mausers have \"shot out\" barrels that cannot easily be replaced, and so have been re-bored for 9mm rounds. It should also be noted that with the stock attached, it is more or less necessary to use an irregular hold (thumb of the strong hand not wrapped around the grip) to avoid the hammer slamming into the user's thumb.\n\nLike many early smokeless powder firearms produced before the first World War, in something of a display of wishful thinking most C96 models feature a tangent rear sight that is adjustable for ranges up to 1000 meters. Some of the later models had a sight adjustable to a less extreme but still unrealistic 500 meters. C96 pistols with fixed rear sights are very rare.\n\nThe Mauser C96 and variants can be seen in the following films, television series, video games, and anime used by the following actors:\n\nMauser C96\n\nThroughout the four decades of C96's production, dozens or hundreds of variants were made. Mauser's production of the C96 can be divided into the \"Early Production Period\" (1896 - 1905), when Mauser have not yet established a single production model for the C96 and made regular improvements on the C96's design, resulting in many different variants, and the \"Stable Production Period\" (1905 - 1937), when the C96's design was finalized, with further variants deriving from that. The vast majority of the C96s are made in the Stable Production period.\n\nMauser did not assign specific model names for most C96 variants, and most C96 variant names are instead nicknames developed by collectors.\n\nNotable models from the Early Production period:\n\n\"Cone Hammer\": These are the earliest production versions of the C96. They feature a distinctive snail-like cone hammer. The Cone Hammers had what's called the \"Early style\" safety, a holeless short-travel safety (with a difference between the two positions of only 0.18in) where down is the safe position.\n\n\"Large Ring Hammer\": Another early production period with a distinctive large ring hammer. It also had the \"Early style\" safety.\n\n\"Flatside\": Also known as \"Slabside\" or \"C99 Regia Marina\", it was a variant of the Large Ring Hammer model with a completely flat frame side that lacks any milling. The first batch of the Flatside was a contract sale of 5000 guns to the Royal Navy of Italy in 1899; it was the first semiautomatic pistol to be ever issued to an Italian armed force (even before the Glisenti 1910). It is chambered in 7.63x25mm.\n\nDuring the Early Production Period, Mauser also experimented with 20-round fixed magazines; because of the inconvenience of reloading, this variant did not become popular. Mauser also experimented with compact models with short barrels, 6-round magazines, and short grips (called \"Pre-War Bolo\" or \"Officer's Model\"); their design was later recycled for the \"Post-War Bolo\" production model after World War I.\n\nNotable models produced by Mauser during the Stable Production period include:\n\n\"Pre-War Commercial\": This is the first stable Mauser C96 design, and the design on which all later C96 models are derived from. It features a full-sized long grip, a fixed ten-round magazine, a 5.5-inch [140mm] barrel, adjustable tangent iron sights calibrated to 1000 meters, 7.63x25mm Mauser (aka .30 Mauser) chambering, the \"Small Ring Hammer\", and the \"Late style, first type\" safety. The safety lever was designed for the 1902 American trials, with longer travel and up as the safe position; it can be recognised by having a hole through the knob at the end of the lever.\n\n\"Persian Contract\": A variant of the \"Pre-War Commercial\" model, it was largely identical to the \"Pre-War Commercial\" aside from some Persian markings.\n\n\"M1912 Export Model\": A rare variant designed for the South American market, chambered in 9x25mm Mauser Export.\n\n\"Wartime Commercial\": A slightly modified version of the \"Pre-War Commercial\" that superseded it in production at around 1912; it is identical to \"Pre-War Commercial\" aside from its \"New Safety\" (a.k.a. \"Late style, second type\" safety), which lacks a hole.\n\n\"Red 9\" (a.k.a. \"1916 Prussian Contract\"): A 9x19mm version of the \"Wartime Commercial\" (with some other adjustments) produced during World War I. It has its own section on this page.\n\n\"Post-War Bolo\": This was the first major production variant of the C96 after World War I. It is a short-barreled derivative of the \"Wartime Commercial\" model with a distinctive short \"Bolo\" grip. These C96s were produced with the short barrel because the Treaty of Versailles prohibited German pistols from having 100mm or longer barrels and 9mm or larger calibers. Bolos were experimented with during the Early Production Period, but the \"Post-War Bolo\" sees the Bolos becoming the main production variant of the C96. It has its own section on this page.\n\nModel 1930 (a.k.a. \"M30\"): This is a simplified model of the Prewar Commercial that had a 5.2-inch [132mm] (1930) or 5.5-inch [140mm] (later) long barrel, a solid one-piece grip frame and large wooden grips, and a lack of decorative milling on the frame and hammer. The M30 had another new safety, the \"Universal Safety\", which featured a hole again. They are primarily identified by the \"step\" in their barrel contour. It superseded the Post-War Bolo as the new standard production variant of the C96.\n\nA very small number of the M1930 Model C96s were made with M712-styled detachable magazines (though they are not select-fire); these are nicknamed the \"M711\" by military surplus dealers to distinguish it from M712. It should also be noted that semi-auto-only M712-like C96s could also be genuine M712 Schnellfeuers with their select-fire components removed for import into the American market in the 1980s.\n\n\"Schnellfeuer\": A machine pistol version of the M1930. It has its own section on this page.\n\nSpecifications\n\n(1896-1937)\n\nType: Pistol, Pistol-Carbine\n\nCaliber: 7.63x25mm Mauser, 9x19mm, 9x25mm Mauser Export (1912)\n\nCapacity: 10-round fixed box magazine was standard. 6-round fixed box magazine (1896-1899) or 20-round fixed box magazine (1896) were used on experimental models\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Automatic (most variants)\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Finances of the Grand Duke (Die Finanzen des Großherzogs) Walter Rilla Luis Hernandez 1924 The Death Ray (Luch smerti) Vsevolod Pudovkin Father Revo 1925 Aleksandra Khokhlova Female shooter Fascist agents Cross and Mauser (Krest i mauzer) Naum Rogozhin Vicar Shur 1925 Bennie the Howl (Benya Krik) Tsysin's aide 1926 Miss Mend Vladimir Fogel Fogel 1926 American police, Soviet Militsiya, Chiche's henchmen Young Eagles (Noored kotkad) Estonian military leader Seen only in holster 1927 October: Ten Days That Shook the World (Oktyabr) Red sailors 1927 Spies Haghi's Henchmen 1928 Oktyabryukhov and Dekabryukhov A Red sailor 1928 The Blue Express Ivan Savelyev An Overseer 1929 British diplomat Fragment of an Empire (Oblomok imperii) Sergey Gerasimov A Menshevik 1929 A White Army officer The Last Attraction (Posledniy attraktsion) Ivan Bykov Kurapov 1929 Leonid Yurenev Vanechka Red sailors, White officers Mutiny (Myatezh) Nikolay Pavlov Kolyshev 1929 My Motherland (Moya Rodina) Yun Fa-shu Manchurian officer 1933 Oleg Zhakov Capt.

They were all prewar or wartime Mauser C96s modified to meet the restrictions set in the Treaty of Versailles, which prohibited pistols from having barrels longer than 100 millimeters and 9mm calibers. They had cut-down 3.9-inch [99mm] barrels and reworked and simplified fixed sights. Pistols chambered in non-standard chamberings like 9x19mm Parabellum were converted to chamber standard 7.63x25mm Mauser rounds. Converted models were stamped \"1920\" to show they were compliant; this practice continued on government-issue weapons even after the ban was no longer in effect.\n\nAs all the \"Rework\" guns are made from preexisting Mauser C96s, they may display a wide variety of features. The key identifying features are their shortened barrels, fixed rear sight, and soldered on front sight without a barrel band on the muzzle (like on the \"Bolo\" guns).\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Knight Without Armour A Bolshevik 1937 Massacre in Rome Executioner 1973 20th of December (20-e dekabrya) Viktor Terekhov A Chekist 1982\n\nMauser C96 \"Bolo\"\n\nThe M1921 \"Bolo\" model had small grips, a 10-round magazine, and a short 3.9-inch [99mm] barrel. It was first produced as a variant model for domestic sales from 1920 to 1921, going into full production from 1921 to 1930. The name \"Bolo\" is short for Bolshevik. Reportedly the Russian Communists or Bolsheviks favored the Broomhandle and in particular the Model 1921. The model was also popular with Poles, Lithuanians, German Freikorps, and White Russians. Among collectors the Bolo model is one of the most popular.\n\nOf note is that \"Bolo\" is sometimes used to describe compact Mauser C96 pistols made in the early production period. For the purposes of IMFDB, unless otherwise stated, \"Bolo\" C96s are the \"Post-War Bolo\" model.\n\nSpecifications\n\nType: Pistol\n\nCaliber: 7.63x25mm Mauser, 9x25mm Mauser Export (rare)\n\nCapacity: 6 (early), 10 (normal production) or 20 (very early) round fixed box magazine\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date The Sea Outpost (Morskoy post) Pyotr Arzhanov Japanese officer 1938 Valery Chkalov Vladimir Belokurov Valery Chkalov 1941 The Gambler (Bob le flambeur) A gangster 1956 And Quiet Flows the Don (Tikhiy Don) White Army officer Nickel plated 1957 The Golden Eshelon (Zolotoy eshelon) A Red partisan 1959 Officers (Ofitsery) Vasili Lanovoy Ivan Varravva 1971 Bumbarash Yuri Smirnov Gavrila 1971 Yekaterina Vasilyeva Sofya Tulchinskaya Leonid Bakshtayev Chubatov A German officer The Black Captain (Chyornyy kapitan) Aleksandr Goloborodko Fyodor Galatenko 1973 Irina Borisova Galya Islenyeva The Last Deed of Kamo (Posledniy podvig Kamo) Voskanyan's second-in-command In holster 1974 The Lost Expedition (Propavshaya ekspeditsiya) Vakhtang Kikabidze Arsen Kabakhidze Standard \"Bolo\" and what appears to be a short-barreled version of pre-war C96 1975 Tachanka from the South (Tachanka s yuga) Viktor Stepanenko Siry 1977 Georgi Dvornikov Pirozhenko R.V.S.

It used ten- or twenty-round detachable magazines and a select-fire mechanism designed by Joseph Nickl (1930-1932), later improved by Karl Westinger (1932-1936), the latter the most commonly seen. With a rate of fire of 900-1,000 rpm, the ten-round magazine lasts around two-thirds of a second: recoil and muzzle climb is ferocious. Despite this, the model was highly successful: production began in 1932 and ended in 1936 after a run of around 98,000 guns.\n\nThe Schnellfeuer is popularly known as the \"M712\", its Wehrmacht designation during World War 2, and some collectors also refer to it as the \"M1932.\" Semi-auto only variants were imported into the US following the introduction of the National Firearms Act, since the $200 \"machine gun\" transfer tax was originally significantly higher than the cost of the Schnellfeuer itself.\n\nAn interesting variant of the M712 is the PASAM (Pistolas Automaticas e Semi-Automaticas Mauser, \"Mauser Automatic and Semi-Automatic Pistols\"), a series of 7.63x25mm Mauser M712s purchased in the 30s by Brazilian police forces. The name is usually used to refer to two distinctive modifications from the 70s, attempting to make the 900rpm machine pistol a little more controllable. 295 PASAMs are just regular M712s, but 101 \"Modification One\" guns were modified with an extension welded to the magazine housing which mounted a metal foregrip, and 89 \"Modification Two\" guns received a more comprehensive upgrade with a foregrip with wooden grip panels and a lengthened rear grip with a 12.6 in (32 cm) fixed tubular stock permanently attached to it. Oddly, Brazil only ever purchased 10-round magazines for these weapons.\n\nSpecifications\n\nType: Machine Pistol\n\nCaliber: 7.63x25mm Mauser\n\nCapacity: 10 or 20-round detachable box magazine\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Deadlock Anthony Dawson Anthony Sunshine With sniper scope and holster-stock 1970 Mario Adorf Charles Dump Marquard Bohm Kid Sitting Target Oliver Reed Harry Lomart 1972 Ian McShane Birdy Williams Robert Beatty The gun dealer A Police Commissioner Accuses (Un comisar acuza) Gheorghe Dinica Paraipan 1974 Mircea Pascu Tanasescu Iron Guard legionnaires Brannigan Daniel Pilon Gorman . 1975 Across the Gobi and the Khingan (Govi Khyangand tulaldsan ni) uncredited Demchig . 1981 The Red Spectacles .

It was rejected on cost grounds with prototype serial numbers not exceeding double digits, and most of the prototypes were destroyed due to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, with just four examples surviving to the present day.\n\nThe \"Trench Carbine\" itself is clearly nothing more than a modern contrived nickname; the original examples have no special markings other than the manufacturer and the year of produce (1917).\n\nSpecifications\n\nType: Pistol-Carbine\n\nCaliber: 9x19mm\n\nCapacity: 10, 20, 40-round detachable box magazine\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Automatic\n\nVideo Games\n\nGame Title Appears as Mods Notation Release Date Battlefield 1 2016 Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades Incorrectly chambered in 7.63x25mm Mauser and has long barrel 2016\n\nAstra 900\n\nThe Astra 900 was a Spanish copy of the C96 produced by Unceta & Cia. The Astra 900 can be distinguished from the Mauser pistols by the appearances of their frames; the right side of an Astra 900 is flat and blank save for a series of pins that are found on none of the Mauser models, while the left side of an Astra 900 features a noticable side plate with Astra markings, which is removable during disassembly.\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date Mandate Mikhail Vasilyev Dubok 1964 The Chief of Chukotka (Nachalnik Chukotki) Mikhail Kononov Alexei 1966 Aleksei Gribov Khramov\n\nTelevision\n\nShow Title Actor Character Note / Episode Air Date The Strogovs (Strogovy) Aleksey Plavinskiy Artyom Strogov 1976 Aleksandr Susnin Sanya Makar the Pathfinder (Makar-sledopyt) Oleg Borisov Staff Capt.

Introduced in 1928, it was one of the first factory select-fire versions of C96; the very first C96 machine pistols were made by Beistegui Hermanos in 1927/1928. Interestingly, the Mauser factory experimented with a their own selective-fire C96 pistol (very similar to the Astra 901) back in 1926, but this not entered to serial production. The Astra 901 did not last long in production, due having a very low capacity (10-round fixed magazine) for a full-auto pistol. The Astra 902 was an updated model of the Astra 901, featuring a 20-round fixed magazine and 180mm-long barrel.\n\nThe Astra 903 was an update to the Astra 902, featuring detachable box magazines instead of fixed magazines. It is effectively Unceta's equivalent of the M1932 Schnellfeuer, though unlike Beistegui's later versions the 903 was not compatible with Schnellfeuer magazines. The Astra Model F was a further improved version of the Astra 903 with an adjustable fire rate control mechanism that can lower the fire rate down to 250 RPM, and is chambered in 9mm Largo.\n\nSpecifications\n\nType: Machine Pistol\n\nCaliber: 7.63x25mm Mauser, 9x23mm Largo (Astra Model F)\n\nCapacity: 10-round fixed box magazine (Astra 901), 20-round fixed box magazine (Astra 902), 10, 20-round detachable box magazine (Astra 903, Astra Model F)\n\nFire Modes: Semi-Auto/Full-Auto; a small number of Astra 902s were made in semi-auto only\n\nFilm\n\nTitle Actor Character Note Date That Man in Istanbul (Estanbul 65) Taiwanese agents Astra 902 1965 The Spy Who Loved Me Richard Kiel Jaws Astra 902 1977\n\nShansi Type 17\n\nThe Type 17 was a .45 ACP version produced in Shanxi, China under the orders of ruling warlord Yan Xishan in order to maintain ammunition compatibility with the Thompson M1921 clones his Taiyuan Arsenal already produced.
