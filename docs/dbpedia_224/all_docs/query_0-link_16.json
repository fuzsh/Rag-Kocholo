Matthew's refusal is a major obstacle to the railroad's plans for expansion. Although he naturally accepts the assignment, Clayton has become weary of killing and wants to try to build a new life for himself. The would-be killer and his potential victim meet and quickly become close friends. The railroad doesn't fail to notice that Clayton has not lived up to his part of the bargain and now wants everybody who gets in their way, dead, including Clayton.\n\nCredits\n\nCast (English): Fabio Testi (Clayton Drumm), Jenny Agutter (Catherine Sebanek), Warren Oates (Matthew Sebanek), Isabel Mestres (Barbara Sebanek), Gianrico Tondinelli (Johnny Sebanek), Franco Interlenghi (Hank Sebanek), Carlos Bravo (Duke), Paco Benlloch (Virgil Sebanek), Sydney Lassick [as Sidney Lassick] (circus attendee), Richard C.
