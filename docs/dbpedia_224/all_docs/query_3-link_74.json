The screenplay by Ugo Pirro and Vittorio Bonicelli adapts Italian Jewish author Giorgio Bassani's 1962 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, about the lives of an upper-class Jewish family in Ferrara during the Fascist era. The film stars Lino Capolicchio, Dominique Sanda, Helmut Berger, Romolo Valli, and Fabio Testi in his breakthrough role.\n\nAn Italian production with West German financing,[2] The Garden of the Finzi-Continis was entered into the 21st Berlin International Film Festival and won the Golden Bear. The film won the 1972 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and earned a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nIn 1938 in Ferrara, the Finzi Contini are a rich Jewish family living in a mansion set in a park. When Jews are banned from the city's tennis club, the family allow the friends of their two children, Micòl and the sickly Alberto, to use their private tennis court. Among them are Giorgio, son of a Jewish businessman, and Giampiero, a communist and a gentile. Giorgio has been in love with Micòl since early adolescence, but she is ambivalent.\n\nAs war approaches, Giorgio's brother moves to Switzerland to pursue his studies while Giorgio, close to graduation, decides to stay in Ferrara and, when Jews are banned from the university library, the Finzi-Contini allow him to use their private library. Micòl leaves to stay in Venice and on her return to Ferrara she definitively rejects Giorgio.\n\nIn 1940, when Italy enters the war, Giampiero is conscripted while Giorgio as a Jew is exempt. On his last night in Ferrara, Giampiero meets up with Giorgio and, when they part at midnight, Giorgio has an urge to see Micòl one more time. Climbing the wall of the Finzi Contini family park, he notices a light in the garden hut and, looking in, sees a naked Micòl beside Giampiero.\n\nIn 1943, amid rumours of further measures against the Jews, Giorgio goes underground and the police arrest the whole Finzi Contini family, holding them with the other Jews of the city in a school. Micòl finds herself herded with her frail grandmother into the same classroom she attended as a child. There she sees Giorgio's father, who informs her that Giorgio has escaped. The two embrace, their future as unclear as the fog hanging over the city. Giampiero has died in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis marked the debut or near-debut for some of its stars, notably the actors who played the two adult Finzi-Contini children, Micòl and Alberto. For Dominique Sanda (Micòl), it was her first Italian feature film (followed by such films as The Conformist and 1900). For Helmut Berger (Alberto), it was his third feature film.\n\nThe director seriously considered entrusting the lead role to singer Patty Pravo, who had to refuse due to too many work commitments.\n\nIn Bassani's novel, the narrator is assumed to be the author himself. In the film, De Sica tells the story entirely through dialogue, with the narrator being the protagonist, Giorgio. The film ends with the Finzi-Contini family's deportation, whereas in the novel, Giorgio, who fled abroad in time to avoid this, recalls the story of his youth and his first impossible love, after 14 years.\n\nInitially Giorgio Bassani cooperated in the drafting of the dialogues and the screenplay of the film but after some disagreements and misunderstandings, the writer and the director entered into open conflict (also due to the fact that in the film the relationship between Micòl and Malnate is made explicit, which is not present in the novel). Bassani asked that his name be removed from the credits of the film. His name was duly removed as one of its script-writers and the opening credits just state that it was ‘freely derived from the novel by Giorgio Bassani'.\n\nVilla Ada near Rome was used for the garden, while the Finzi Contini villa is the Litta Bolognini villa in Vedano al Lambro, a municipality in the Brianza area, adjacent to the Monza Park. The entrance to the garden in the film is really in Ferrara, in Corso Ercole I d'Este [it], near where Bassani had imagined it. The other exteriors were shot in Ferrara; noteworthy are the Estense castle and the city walls, the Palazzo dei Diamanti, the Cathedral of San Giorgio and also some famous streets.\n\nIt received positive acclaim from international critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 16 reviews, with an average score of 7.9/10.[3]\n\nIn 1972, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.[4] It won the Golden Bear at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival in 1971.[5] It was De Sica's penultimate film.\n\nThe restored digital version, curated by the Istituto Luce Cinecittà and performed at the \"Studio Cine\" in Rome and \"The rediscovered image\" in Bologna, was presented in the spring of 2015.\n\nList of Holocaust films\n\nList of submissions to the 44th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nList of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nTibbetts, John C., and James M.
