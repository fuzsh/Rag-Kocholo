        "text": "1975 French film\n\nThat Most Important Thing: LoveDirected byAndrzej ŻuławskiWritten by\n\nChristopher Frank\n\nAndrzej Żuławski\n\nStarringMusic byGeorges DelerueDistributed by\n\nS. N. Prodis (France)\n\nSeaberg Film Distr. (US) dubbed\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n105 mins (cut version)\n\n113 mins (director's cut, NTSC)\n\n108 mins (director's cut, PAL)\n\nCountryFranceLanguageFrench\n\nThat Most Important Thing: Love (original French title: L'important c'est d'aimer) is a French film directed by Polish filmmaker Andrzej Żuławski. It tells the story of a passionate love relationship between Nadine Chevalier, a B-List actress (Romy Schneider), and Servais Mont, a photographer (Fabio Testi), in the violent and unforgiving French show business.\n\nIn 1975, Żuławski coadapted and directed this movie, based on the novel by Christopher Frank La Nuit américaine [fr] (unrelated to the 1973 François Truffaut film of that name). The success in France was such – it was featuring the very popular actress Romy Schneider and French singer Jacques Dutronc – that it allowed Żuławski to come back to Poland. The film had a total of 1,544,986 admissions in France.[1]\n\nRomy Schneider received the inaugural César Award for Best Actress for this role and Pedro Almodóvar dedicated his film All About My Mother partially to her in this role.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nServais Mont, a photographer, meets Nadine Chevalier who earns her money starring in cheap soft-core movies. Trying to help her, he borrows the money from loan sharks to finance the theatrical production of Richard III and gives Nadine a part. Nadine is torn between Servais, with whom she is falling in love, and her husband Jacques, to whom she has moral obligations.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRomy Schneider as Nadine Chevalier\n\nFabio Testi as Servais Mont\n\nJacques Dutronc as Jacques Chevalier\n\nClaude Dauphin as Mazelli\n\nRoger Blin as Servais's father\n\nGabrielle Doulcet [fr] as Madame Mazelli\n\nMichel Robin as Raymond Lapade\n\nGuy Mairesse as Laurent Messala\n\nJacques Boudet as Robert Beninge\n\nKatia Tchenko as Myriam, the whore\n\nNicoletta Machiavelli as Luce, Lapade's wife\n\nKlaus Kinski as Karl-Heinz Zimmer\n\nPaul Bisciglia as Assistant director\n\nU.S. release\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was originally released in the U.S. in the 1970s in a dubbed version titled That Most Important Thing: Love. The digitally restored French-language version made its cinematic debut in the U.S. in July 2017.[3]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 12 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.5/10.[4]\n\nReviewing the full French version in Film Comment, Ela Bittencourt called it one of Żuławski's best films and a \"passionate portrait of the dignity—and the indignities—of an actor's work.\" She also praised the director's \"fluid, roving camera... so attentive to every pang, twinge, or slightest hint of agony that it seems to expose the characters’ every nerve.\"[3] In a 4/4 star review from Chicago Reader, Ben Sachs said that \"shining through L'Important C'Est D'Aimer is a genuine sense that love enables us to transcend the most degrading experiences.\"[5] The New York Times wrote: \"the searing, sometimes confounding film [...] showcases the heartbreaking talents of Schneider.\"[6] Gene Moskowitz said in Variety: \"Accepted in its own terms of an almost symbolical tale of human survival and love, it is an unusual pic served by first rate acting.\"[7]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
