        "text": "2005 Announcements (back to top)\n\nJanuary 1, 2005: I've begun a massive restructuring of this site, starting by breaking down this formerly huge homepage into several major subpages: Publications Page, Book About Page, Courses Page, Scholars and Activists Page, Links Page.\n\nThe Publications Page is the backbone of the materials on this site. It links to full text versions of several of Herbert's best-known writings (One Dimensional Man, Repressive Tolerance), and provides links and information about many others.\n\nIt will take a while before I find the time to bring the formatting and links up to date. Please excuse the \"under construction\" look to some of the pages, and the broken links.\n\nJan. 2005: Upcoming events and conferences: Panel \"Marcuse and Education\" at the AERA conference in April (Douglas Kellner, \"Marcuse's Challenge to Education,\" Friday, Apr 15 - 2:15pm - 3:45pm, abstracts); also a conference in May 2005 in Brazil.\n\nJanuary 25, 2005: On November 3-6, 2005 there will be a conference entitled \"Reading Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization after 50 Years.\" It will be held at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia PA. If you are interested in participating, contact Dr. Arnold Farr\n\n<[email protected]>. [see March 1, 2005 update]\n\n1/25/05: recent article about Herbert's June 1969 lecture tour in Italy added to News page: Diego Giachetti, \"Giugno 1969: I 'Caldi' Giorni Italiani di Herbert Marcuse,\" Il Protagora, n. 4, luglio-dicembre 2004\n\nJan. 31, 2005\n\nCollected Papers,\n\nvol. 3:\n\nThe New Left and the 1960s,\n\npubl.

June 2004\n\n€ 24,00\n\nzu Klampen publisher\n\namazon.de\n\nSchriften page\n\n: Russell Jacoby's Nation review of vol. 3 of Herbert's papers, with brief responses by Douglas Kellner and Peter Marcuse, added.\n\nFeb. 18-20, 2005: massive updates to the Publications and Books About pages; as well as Wikipedia entry\n\nMarch 1, 2005: 50th Anniversary Eros and Civilization conference, Nov. 3-6, 2005 in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Philosophy Department at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia invites paper submissions to a conference devoted to the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization. Papers are welcome on a wide range of topics: explication of Marcuse's project in Eros and Civilization; its place in his social philosophy; the influence of Marcuse's work in the past fifty years; its place in a critical theory of society; the importance of Eros and Civilization for fields such as psychology, aesthetics, and political philosophy; and prospects for a renewal of Marcuse's approach to social philosophy.\n\nSee the conference website with call for papers, registration form, and contact information.\n\nFor more information on Eros & Civ, including a list of reviews, see the Publications page.\n\nMarch 8, 2005: The pages that were not available since March 3 are back on-line. The counters are still not working. Sparklit was doing technical work from 3/4-3/10/05\n\nApril 15, 2005: you can use google to search this site:\n\nWWW www.marcuse.org\n\nApril 23, 2005: upcoming conference, May 18-20, 2005: \"Dimensão Estética: Homenagem aos 50 anos de Eros et Civilização,\" Belo Horizonte, Brazil. conference website. The title in English: \"The Aesthetic Dimension: Homage to 50 years of Eros and Civilization\"\n\nMay 11, 2005: new Herbert and Surrealism Page (scans of 1989 article by Franklin Rosemont and Herbert's letters to the surrealists, 1971-73)\n\nMay 18, 2005: Scans of Das Ende der Utopie (1967) added to Publications Page.\n\nMay 20, 2005: Two new books by Christian Fuchs added to Books About Page: a short introductory reading guide to his intellectual background and works, and, a continuation of the introduction, a discussion of the implications of Herbert's ideas.\n\nMay 23, 2005: major site reorganization after move to a new server; use of background color on pages. Note: server now defaults to index.html, not .htm.\n\nMay 27, 2005: Formatting and links on many pages updated. Full texts of The End of Utopia (also scans of German original with discussion), 1947-48 Marcuse-Heidegger correspondence (English and German) added. Numerous new entries on News and Conferences, and Scholars and Activists pages.\n\nMay 30, 2005: site search (using google) now added to header box, above. Numerous new entries on Publications, Books About pages, including texts of reviews of Herbert's works and by Herbert from the 1940s and 1950s. I'm sure there are still bugs in the images, but I'll work on them as time permits. I'd appreciate notification if you encounter a missing page.\n\nJune 15, 2005: The site search function will return some broken links and miss some pages until google crawls this site again. I am now finished with my major reorganization and updates. Since the site search is powered by google, it will not register that many pages have moved until it reindexes this site (should be done every 4-6 weeks). I've left redirect pages in some of the more important locations. Sorry about any inconvenience you may encounter.\n\nJuly 7, 2005: google has re-crawled this site, so the search function is reliable again. After his note in the guestbook, I've added Alan J. Dobson's 1989 dissertation to the Books About page, as well as some 1968 articles. Theresa MacKey's excellent biographical article has been archived, and many citations of interesting articles added to the Publications page. Finally, I put many images on the Sophie Marcuse page.\n\nJune 9, 2005: I've added scans of many (!) reviews Herbert wrote in the 1940s and 1950s, and reviews of his 1932 Hegel, 1941 Reason & Revolution, 1958 Soviet Marxism books, to the Publications Page, also a 1969 interview about Adorno after Adorno's sudden death, and started a Sound and Video page to collect links to multimedia sources.\n\nJune 12, 2005: In addition to a new page about the film Herbert's Hippopotamus (with a time-coded description of the film), I've cleaned up the site. That means that until google crawls it again, some of the duplicate results from the \"site search\" feature (showing the same file in multiple locations) won't be available. But that shouldn't pose much of a problem.\n\nAs an addendum to the June 9 announcements, I've added the full texts of a number of articles to the Books About Page. See esp. 1952, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1999. And there are new entries (from York University) on the Courses Page.\n\nJune 14, 2005: I'm still trying to keep abreast of new material, which has been added to the Heidegger page, as well as Scholars and Activists and News & Events (links to full texts of Italian articles from 1998 to 2003).\n\nI've also started a section for Raffaele Laudani's Italian edition of Herbert's collected/unpublished papers.\n\nJuly 19, 2005: Today is Herbert's 107th birthday. For this occasion Doug Ireland wrote an excellent blog entry, with reminiscences by his \"former Village Voice colleague Jeff Weinstein, who these days is both culture columnist and Fine Arts Editor for the Philadelphia Inquirer,\" and Ariel Dorfman, \"the prolific Chilean playwright-political essayist-poet-scenarist-novelist,\" now at North Carolina. (Added to News and Events Page, with links from Scholar-Activists.)\n\nJuly 20: updated with reminiscence by Norman Birnbaum, and republished (without images) on Z-Net [7/2018: link updated to web archive version].\n\nJuly 19, 2005: Newly found: journalist and critic Danny Postel's August 2000 interview with Lowell Bergman, The 60 Minutes producer who was played by Al Pacino in the 1999 movie The Insider (entry added on Scholar-Activists, and link on the Sound & Video Page).\n\nJuly 24, 2005: Doug Ireland's blog entry has been drawing visitors to this site (see the stats, below). On July 22, Ireland's page was selected as dissidentvoice.org's site of the day with the following text: \"Marcuse's work, though unknown to most younger activists and university students today, inspired countless activists and thinkers from the '50s to the '70s to construct a new radical politics that rejected both capitalism and authoritarian communism. His writings and seminal ideas may indeed be more relevant today than ever before, and people concerned about the future in these agonizing times would do well to revisit Marcuse's work. Journalist Doug Ireland remembers this important figure, and provides many valuable links to web sites featuring Marcuse's writings as well as critical essays and audio/video clips about him.\"\n\nBased on my correspondence with Doug, I've added several more entries on the Scholars & Activists Page: Ron Aronson, Norman Birnbaum, Norman Geras, and Ireland himself.\n\nAug. 2, 2005 : Oct. 4, 2005 presentation in Berlin by Dr. Wolfgang Lenk: \"Klassiker der Kritik I: Herbert Marcuse - Der eindimensionale Mensch (1964),\" added to the News & Events page. Sponsored by Anders arbeiten. For more information follow the link above or contact: [email protected].\n\nBlurb: 'Marcuses Buch stammt unverkennbar aus dem sog. \"goldenen Zeitalter\" des Kapitalismus - es diagnostiziert den \"Sieg über das unglückliche Bewußtsein\" durch die Kräfte der Massenkultur, die Vergöttlichung von Arbeitsethos und neuester Technologie. Und es war von größter Bedeutung für die Revolte von 1968. Heute, in Zeiten des marktliberalen Umbaus, sind wir erneut mit umfassenden Transformationen von Kultur, Technologie und Menschenbild konfrontiert. Ist Marcuses eindimensionaler Mensch ein Vorläufer des \"flexiblen Menschen\" (Richard Sennett), also eines vollständig der Vermarktlichung unterworfenen Lebensmodells? Was macht seine Analyse heute wieder lesenswert? Was unterscheidet die Bedingungen für Protest damals und heute?'\n\nAug. 3, 2005: additions and corrections to J.J. Shapiro and Shierry Weber Nicholsen entries on Scholars & Activists Page. Both attended the May 2005 Brazilian Eros & Civ. conference.\n\nAug. 29, 2005: May 2005 Eros & Civilization conference program (Belo Horizonte, Brazil) now available; also Raffaele Laudani's new book, an Aug. 6 review of vol. 1 of the Italian edition of Herbert's papers, 'Beyond One Dimensional Man,' edited by Raffaele Laudani (see Publications page).\n\nAug. 31, 2005: I'm working through a backlog of things people have sent me for the website. I've added a 2002 article by Elena Tebano on the origin of Herbert's \"Proust Notes,\" and a hitherto unpublished 2002 essay by Amy Serrano drawing on Herbert's ideas to examine female artist-activists. For the latter I've created a new \"Unpublished and Student Papers Page\" -- students out there, submissions are welcome. Also full text of chap. 2 of Raffaele Laudani's 2002 dissertation; F.O. Wolf's July 2003 Berlin presentation.\n\nOct. 14, 2005: With only hours to spare, there's a talk this evening, 8pm, in Starnberg:\n\nas part of the \"Literarischer Herbst\": KD Wolff spricht über Herbert Marcuse: \"Vernunft als erotische Energie\" (der Titel stammt nicht von ihm), in the Villa Böhler, (jetzt Montessori-Schule), EUR 10.- Eintritt, veranstaltet vom Kulturbureau Borst. (I've also added an entry on Wolff on the Scholars & Activists Page)\n\nNov. 2, 2005: Eros and Civilization conference in Philadelphia starts tomorrow.\n\n(Publications page updated and counter added.)\n\n2006 Announcements (back to top)\n\nJan. 2, 2006: new addition to Books About page: Allgemeiner Studierendenausschuss der Freien Universität Berlin (ed.), Zur Aktualität der Philosophie Herbert Marcuses: Dokumentation einer Veranstaltung an der Freien Universität Berlin am 17. Juli 2003 (Berlin: Asta, 2005)(Hochschulpolitische Reihe, vol. 12), 175 pages.\n\ncontributions by: Detlev Claussen, Angela Davis, Thomas Flierl, Gunter Gebauer, Hartmut Häussermann, Axel Honneth, Peter-Erwin Jansen, Eberhard Lämmert, Wolfgange Lefévre, Harold Marcuse, Peter Marcuse, Frieder Otto Wolf (all in German, except Harold's and Angela Davis's contributions are in both German and English). scan of table of contents; Asta der FU Hochschulpolitsche Reihe page\n\nJan. 15, 2006: 1998 French article added to News/Events page: Gilles Châtelet, \"L'Homme pour qui la résignation était ringarde: Relire Marcuse pour ne pas vivre comme des porcs,\" in: Le Monde diplomatique, August 1998, pp. 22-23. The title translates as: 'The Man for whom resignation was old-fashioned: Rereading Marcuse in order not to live like pigs.' Link thanks to Doug Ireland, who found it while doing a column on Gilles Deleuze (Châtelet connected the two for an interview in 1995). The title refers also to Châtelet's 1998 book, whose title translates as: \"To Live and Think Like Pigs: envy and boredom in market-economy democracies.\"\n\nFeb. 6, 2006: YEESSS!!! We are proud to announce that former UCLA campus Republicans chair Andrew Jones's \"Dirty Thirty\" list of radical professors features two scholars with links of some sort or other to Herbert. This week Doug Kellner even made it to \"Radical of the Week\" (he's no. 3 on the list). Russell Jacoby squeaked in at no. 28, and I spot Jackie Leavitt's picture in the header collage. Jones' site is at uclaprofs.com. For more information see the California Federation of Teachers summary and links page.\n\nFeb. 28, 2006: Added: 1978 interview about the Aesthetic Dimension, and Ralph Dumain to the Scholars & Activists Page (with links to several of the Marcuse-texts on his site).\n\nMarch 5, 2006: Not only did several of Herbert's students make Andrew Jones' top \"dirty thirty\" list of UCLA professors (see Feb. 6 announcement), but Herbert himself features in Jones' intellectual mentor David Horowitz's \"101 most dangerous academics in America\". I'd love to include here the relevant excerpt from Horowitz' new book The Professors ($28/18 at amazon), but I'd hate to buy another cranky, whiney conservative author's book. Anyone care to send me a scan or excerpt for my Haters Page? [note 6/28/06: I should be able to add text in late July; added 8/6/06]\n\nReady for Halloween scariness? Here's some publisher's hype from the dust jacket (courtesy of amazon):\n\n\"David Horowitz reveals a shocking and perverse culture of academics who are poisoning the minds of today's college students. ... Today’s radical academics are, ... far from being harmless, ... spew violent anti-Americanism, preach anti-Semitism, and cheer on the killing of American soldiers and civilians—all the while collecting tax dollars and tuition fees to indoctrinate our children. ... The Professors is truly frightening—and an intellectual call to arms from a courageous author who knows the radicals all too well.\"\n\n6/28/06: an April 5, 2006 entry in the guestbook suggests adding a link to this 4/4/06 Guardian article by Gary Younge: \"Silence in class: University professors denounced for anti-Americanism; schoolteachers suspended for their politics; students encouraged to report on their tutors. Are US campuses in the grip of a witch-hunt of progressives, or is academic life just too liberal?\"\n\nJune 28, 2006: David Satz, a musician and recording engineer who at the time recorded an October 1970 radio broadcast of a lecture by Herbert with an hourlong Q&A afterward, donated two sound files for inclusion on this site.\n\n44min/21Mbyte mp3 of the lecture; 60min/28M mp3 of the Q&A.\n\nNote: I have broadband, and these are 4 1/2 and 6 min. downloads for me.\n\nI don't know the title yet (may be able to add the introduction soon), but the topic seems to be something like: 'to what extent is The Revolution possible today'?\n\nArchived on the Sound and Video page.\n\nThis is a superb lecture with fascinating and evocative Q&A. Many thanks, David\n\nAug. 7, 2006: I just added a longer excerpt from David Horowitz's 2006 book The Professors to the Haters page.\n\nSept. 15, 2006: Added to Books About page: 1971 interview by Sam Keen and John Raser, \"A Conversation with Herbert Marcuse: Revolutionary Eroticism, the Tactics of Terror, the Young, Psychotherapy, the Environment, Technology, Reich,\" in: Psychology Today 4:2(Feb. 1971), 35-40, 60-66. This is a superb piece in which Herbert gives frank answers to excellent questions. (On Aug. 17, 2006 an Australian graduate student wrote the following in the site guestbook: \"Do you have any info about the late Professor John Raser, a former student of Herbert Marcuse and his advocate in Perth, Western Australia?\")\n\nDec. 11, 2006: Thanks to Uli Schöberl (Bauhaus University, Weimar), who notes in the guestbook that you can watch the full video Herbert's Hippopotamus on google video.\n\nDec. 11, 2006: The International Herbert Marcuse Society will hold its second annual conference at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia PA on November 8th-11th, 2007. The topic is \"Critique and Liberation in the Work of Herbert Marcuse.\" If you wish to present a paper, please send an abstract to Arnold Farr <[email protected]> by March 15, 2007. I've also added Prof. Farr to the Scholars page.\n\nDec. 11, 2006: I have removed the bulk of One-Dimensional Man from this website (leaving only the introduction, chap. 1, and the conclusion) because Beacon Press requested it, attributing a recent decline in sales to the existence of this internet version. If any visitors have thoughts about how the existence of this web version might affect their decision to purchase (or not to purchase) the book itself, please share them in the Guestbook, below.\n\nI see two conflicting factors: On the one hand, its existence on this site makes the work available to many people around the world who would never be able to purchase the book, while generally increasing the book's visibility, thereby not decreasing, but probably promoting sales.\n\nOn the other hand, if college courses are requiring the book, students might be tempted to read it on-line instead of purchasing it. However, there is a thriving used market (over 90 copies on amazon.com, and over 200 on abebooks.com), indicating that there is a large buffer before readers have to purchase a new copy.\n\nDec. 14, 2006: two new publications added to the Books About page: a collection of key Frankfurt School texts edited by Axel Honneth, and an essay by Peter-Erwin Jansen, \"'Die Begierde nach Gesellschaft:' Herbert Marcuses Blick für die Unzulänglichkeiten staatlicher Utopien.\" Stasi file: Jansen's article includes a description of the file maintained about him by the East German Stasi spy agency (pdf p. 9, essay p. 35).\n\nDec. 21, 2006: Scanned 1968 sermon added to Books About page: John Ruskin Clark, What's Wrong with Marcuse's One Dimensional Man (San Diego, First Unitarian Church of San Diego, 1968). Transcript of a sermon delivered to the First Unitarian Church of San Diego Oct. 13, 1968; concerning Herbert Marcuse's famous philosophical tract; seven pages.\n\nDec. 21: 19 page pdf (473K) contains front matter and Jansen's 15 page essay (courtesy of Offizin Publishers--thank you!)\n\n[I also typed in some excerpts from A.Soellner's Zur Archäologie d. Dem. (1982)]\n\n2010 Announcements (back to top)\n\nFeb. 7, 2010: In 2008 Osha Neumann, Herbert's stepson, published a memoir, Up Against the Wall Motherf**ker: a Memoir of the 60s with Notes for Next Time. The subtitle was intended to be \"A Memoir of the 60s with Notes on Reason, Obsession, and the Dream of Revolution,\" which more accurately describes the book. At least half the book is taken up with reflections on reason and the irrational as it plays out in politics and as he experienced it in his personal life, which was of course heavily influenced by Herbert. (Herbert married Osha's mother, Inge Neumann, the wife of his recently deceased best friend Franz Neumann, in 1955.) (Publisher's webpage with preview; amazon)\n\nFeb. 14, 2010: Last October vol. 6 of Herbert's unpublished papers was published in Germany: Oekologie und Gesellschaftskritik. It contains 11 works from 2 different periods: In 1932-34 Herbert's confrontation with Heidegger's & Jaspers' philosophy, and some 1965-75 writing about theories of society. The papers were edited by Peter-Erwin Jansen and introduced by Iring Fetscher.\n\nreview in Frankfurter Rundschau, Feb. 5, 2010: \"Herbert Marcuses sechster Band: Der Mensch als Selbstzweck.\"\n\nApr. 30, 2010: The Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie is now available for free online. Here is a link to the ADB Herbert Marcuse article (in German) by Hauke Brunkhorst, published in vol. 16(1990). I didn't know that Herbert was a visiting professor in Frankfurt in 1964 (between Brandeis and UC San Diego)--is that true?\n\nMay 5 & 15, 2010: Added to Sound&Video page: Peter Davis of villonfilms.com put together a DVD of Herbert's lecture and the subsequent discussion at the 28 July 1967 \"Dialectics of Liberation\" conference in London for the 2009 Marcuse Association conference. I've made a rough 5:40 youtube clip (filmed off of my TV) of the beginning of his talk \"Liberation from the Affluent Society.\" I ripped a slightly longer clip as well (5/15: 8 min. clip). Contact Peter Davis to order a copy.\n\nMay 23, 2010: Added to the Books About and Herbert-Rudi Dutschke pages:\n\n2009: Giovanni Pasquali and Dzintars Kalnins: \"Masturbation* or Practical Consciousness–Raising? Rudi Dutschke's Way to Democracy.\" 31 page paper written for a course on Modern Social Theory taught by Prof. Martin Nonhoff at the University of Bremen in Germany in Fall 2009.\n\nThe author writes the following in an email: \"It is mainly based on Marcuse's thought and Dutschke's interpretation with regard to the concept of democracy and the meaning that it assumed among the student movements in the 60's and 70's.\"\n\nMay 27, 2010: Finally added to Books About Page: Joan Norquist's 64-page 2000 bibliography (as searchable pdf). It lists 17 books in English by Herbert (with the reviews of those books), 22 books in German, 113 articles by him; 67 books about him, ca. 50 dissertations & theses, and 101 articles about him.\n\nAug. 18, 2010: Added to Unpublished Papers page: \"Reflections on Herbert Marcuse’s Technology Critique through the Analysis of Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times\" (18 pages), by Prof. Aydan Turanli, Istanbul Technical University (Prof. Turanli's web page).\n\nAug. 18, 2010: Added to Sound & Video page: links to interviews with Herbert that were uploaded to youtube in the past year, one in German (1976) and one in English (1977/78)--see the April and Dec. 2009 entries in the YouTube section there.\n\nThe exchange with Bryan Magee about whether or not politicians are dominated by private economic interests (p. 49 of the print version) is amusing from a 2010 perspective.\n\nSept. 21, 2010: made a new page in biography section (only link to it is from here), with 3 photos from Herbert's 10th grade high school gradebook at the Kaiserin Augusta Gymnasium in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Many thanks to Dutch collector W.O. who sent these in June 2008. His grades, by the way, were fairly mediocre--mostly 3s, 4 in math & science (but a 2 in comportment).\n\nSept. 21, 2010: Two New York Times articles added to the publications page:\n\n1969, May 4: \"Student Protest Is Nonviolent Next to the Society Itself,\" New York Times, p. 137. (jpg scan)\n\nHerbert argues that police intervention in civil disobdience actions on college campuses are justified only when their education mission is threatened.\n\n1971, May 13: \"Reflections on Calley,\" New York Times, p. 45. (jpg scan, pdf)\n\nHas a massive sense of guilt turned into its opposite, a strident identification with the crime and criminal, seeing it as justified? Herbert looks at the public support for Calley.\n\nSept. 22, 2010: three letters placed in the biography section (no page or other links yet).\n\n1946, October: Herbert Marcuse to Max Horkheimer. Translated into German and commented by Tim B. Müller.\n\n1953, April: Herbert Marcuse to Max Horkheimer, April 15, 1953, Max Horkheimer Archiv, Frankfurt am Main. Marcuse reported to Horkheimer that Karl Löwith – who had defended his Habilitationsschrift under Heidegger’s direction in 1928 -- knew about Heidegger’s comment. Marcuse adds “Nur aus psychopathischen Gründen würde mich interessieren, was H[eidegger] gesagt hat.”\n\n1969, January: Herbert Marcuse to Robert E. Goldburg, January 24, 1969, Herbert Marcuse Archive, Frankfurt, 371.04.\n\nComing soon: “Marcuse on The University Music New Culture Ecology Personal & Social Liberation Workers The Mideast,” Street Journal, (April 1970).\n\nOct. 17, 2010: One of Herbert's last talks, published posthumously in 1992, added to Publications page \"Ecology and the Critique of Modern Society,\" with commentaries by Andrew Feenberg, Joel Kovel, Douglas Kellner and C. Fred Alford (37-48), published in: Capitalism, Nature, Socialism 3:3(1992), 29-48 [UC Santa Cruz].\n\nNov. 6, 2010: Arnold Farr's 2009 book added to Book About page:\n\nArnold L. Farr, Critical Theory and Democratic Vision: Herbert Marcuse and Recent Liberation Philosophies (New York: Lexington Books, 2009). (google books version; $60 at amazon)\n\nNov. 7, 2010: British philosopher Nina Power has published One Dimensional Woman, (Zero Books, 2009), 74 pages. ($10 at amazon, with table of contents and intro with discussion of Herbert's ODM)\n\nreview in the Malaysia Star by Subashini Navaratnam\n\nDec. 2-12, 2010: New additions:\n\nDavid Ingram and Susan Sontag added to Scholars and Activists page.\n\nJeffrey Herf, \"The Critical Spirit of Herbert Marcuse,\" in: New German Critique No. 18 (Autumn, 1979), pp. 24-27. [pdf] on Books About page.\n\nRobespierre de Oliveira, \"A dialética da libertação: contracultura e sociedade unidimensional,\" in: CULT (Nov. 17, 2010). Also on Books About page & Scholar Activists page.\n\n1969 \"Student Protest is Non-violent Next to Society Itself,\" New York Times Magazine (4 May 1969): 137. (text on Nov. 18, 2010 blog by \"Savonarola\"). On Publications page.\n\nDec. 22, 2010: The new google tool that uses its scans of 500 years of books to graph the frequency of use of certain words shows a graph for marcuse, 1950-2008 that reveals a peak in 1972, a mild blossoming in the mid-1990s, and a steady climb since 2000 towards an even higher peak.\n\nNote 1/12/2011: That graph was for lower-case marcuse. I'm now inserting images of the results for Marcuse and Herbert Marcuse, which are orders of magnitude larger (and more consistent without the fall-off from 1974 to 1980). The top image below is for English books, the bottom for German. Clicking takes you to the google nGrams viewer.\n\nSee also this 12/16/10 NYT article about the database: \"In 500 Billion Words, New Window on Culture\"\n\nDec. 23, 2010: Vol. 5 of Herbert's Collected Papers: Douglas Kellner and Clayton Pierce (eds.), Philosophy, Psychoanalysis and Emancipation (Routledge, 2011) is now available. (amazon page). It includes 24 short, previously unpublished pieces by Herbert. (Routledge page)\n\nDetails on this site: Papers page; also entered on Publications page.\n\nIn October Tim B. Müller's Krieger und Gelehrte: Herbert Marcuse und die Denksysteme im Kalten Krieg (Hamburger Edition, 2010), 736 Seiten was published. (EUR 35/25 at amazon.de)\n\n2011 Announcements (back to top)\n\nJan. 1, 2011: A reminiscence by Elisha Porat about Herbert's 3rd wife Ricky's time at Kibbutz Ein Hahoresh in 1959-60/61 added to Erica Sherover-Marcuse page.\n\nAdded to the Unpublished papers page, 2008 thesis by Debora Neri, \"La società unidimensionale e il suo superamento: Un confronto tra la posizione di Herbert Marcuse e quella di Jack Kerouac\" (Università degli studi G. D'annunzio, 2007-08) (English abstract)\n\nAdded to Nachgelassene Schriften page: Spanish review of all 6 volumes (pdf), edited by P.E. Jansen.\n\nPeter Davis, who documented the 1967 London Dialectics of Liberation conference on film, has created a Dialectics of Liberation website. Added to our Dialectics of Liberation book page.\n\n1/12/11, 2/14/11: on Oct. 27-29, 2011 the Fourth Biennal Conference of the International Herbert Marcuse Society will be held in Philadelphia. The theme is Critical Refusals. For more information, go to the conference page at the Int'l H.M. Society website. See also this 9 page pdf \"10 things to know about the 2011 Conference\" (updated 4/16/11).\n\nNOTE: Abstracts of papers are due by Apr. 23; send to [email protected].\n\nJan. 13, 2011: I've added pdfs of Herbert's 1965 Nachwort and translated Epilog to Marx's 1852 text The 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon to the Publications page.\n\nJan. 14, 2011: I've added quite a few items to the booksabout page, esp. for 2004-2010, based on a title search in google books. Also a description of Brazilian Marcuse Studies based on an email from Robespierre de Oliveira (take a look at the Marcuse puppet one of his students made).\n\nFeb. 7, 2011: Added to the Unpublished papers page:\n\nAlan Dobson (2008) , '\"Be realistic, demand the impossible:\" Alan Dobson examines the ideas of a thinker whose ideas were a major influence upon the student radicals of 1968.' (7 page pdf)\n\nFeb. 9, 2011: After adding below (12/23/10 announcement) Tim B. Müller's new book Krieger und Gelehrte: Herbert Marcuse und die Denksysteme im Kalten Krieg [Warriors and Scholars: HM and the Schools of Thought in the Cold War] (2010), a new review, by Detlef Claussen, has been published in the TAZ:\n\n\"Herbert Marcuse als CIA-Agent,\" (Feb. 8, 2011). Claussen likes Müller's reading of Herbert's 1950s books (Reason & Rev; Eros & Civ; Soviet Marxism), but says he misinterprets the CIA connection in order to sensationalize it.\n\nAlso new on the Books About page: Peter-Erwin Jansen's essay in the the Frankfurt Jewish Museum's 2009 exhibition catalog about the Frankfurt School: \"Etablierung im Exil: Herbert Marcuse und Leo Löwenthal in Amerika\" (14 page pdf).\n\nJuly 25, 2011: Not quite a week after the 113th anniversary of Herbert's birth, I have a few new and long overdue items to add:\n\nDavid Kettler and George Katsiaficas added to the Scholars Page; Michael Schwandt (2009) to the Books About page.\n\nIn January I uploaded pdfs of Herbert's 1965 Nachwort and translated Epilog to Marx's 1852 text The 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, which was being translated for a Brazilian edition of Marx's text. That edition, with Herbert's epilog in Portuguese, has now been published by Boitempo Editorial.\n\nVolume 4 of Herbert's works in Italian has been published (Publications page): Raffaele Laudani (ed.), Teoria critica del desiderio (Manifestolibri, 2011), 285 pp. [Writings on art, 1957-1978]\n\nI came across an article on Slate.com with interview quotations from Andrew Breitbart (the conservative windbag whose doctored videos of a setup against Acorn and a speech by Agriculture Secretary nominee Shirley Sherrod [July 2011 AP story] destroyed the reputations of both), who made headlines again by--correctly--exposing the sexual twitter shenanigans of NY representative Anthony Wiener, bringing him down as well. That article, \"What Is Andrew Breitbart Thinking?,\" contains the following quotation:\n\nBreitbart traces everything he despises about cultural liberalism to his college days. \"When I told my parents I was an American studies major, they were like, 'That's fantastic! Did you read Mark Twain?' 'No, I didn't.' 'What did you read?' 'Marcuse, Adorno, Horkheimer, Michel Foucault.' 'They don't sound American!' 'They're not.' \" Luckily, recalls Breitbart, \"I was too drunk to be completely indoctrinated by it.\"\n\nAfter doing a little research, I found that Breitbart goes into much greater detail about Herbert in his modestly titled 2011 book, Excuse me while I save the world. I've added him to my \"Haters page\" on this site, with excerpts from the relevant pages that are available online (pages in google books). (I also updated and reformatted the Haters page, adding very early material from 1968 by Don Feder at the bottom as well.)\n\nFinally, I came across this unpublished undergraduate honors thesis from Stanford University:\n\nIsraelachvili, David B., Radical Psychoanalysis, Critical Theory, and the Search for a Sane Society: The Fromm-Marcuse Debate Reconsidered (2009). (Unpublished Papers page).\n\nJuly 29, 2011: More items added--2 of Herbert's early publications in Die Gesellschaft (on the Publications page), and a 1976 textbook chapter about Herbert (on the Books About page):\n\n\"Zur Wahrheitsproblematik der soziologischen Methode: Karl Mannheim, Die Ideologie und Utopie,\" in: Die Gesellschaft 2(1929), 356-369. (searchable pdf)\n\n\"Das Problem der geschichtlichen Wirklichkeit: Wilhelm Dilthey,\" in: Die Gesellschaft 8(1931), 350-367.

(searchable 26 page pdf)\n\nLast and least, a 2010 anecedote from a former UCSD student added to the Guestbook and Stories page.\n\nAug. 6, 2011: links to online versions of Herbert's 1974 Stanford lecture \"Marxism & Feminism\" added to the Publications page.\n\nSept. 17, 2011:1962-65 exchange of letters with Paul Tillich about Kennedy and US politics added to Publications and Books About pages (published 2007). Also this 1970 photo with Leo Löwenthal:\n\nNov. 4, 2011: Several new items, a couple from the just completed 4th Conference of the International Herbert Marcuse Society:\n\nCharles Reitz and Stephen Spartan's paper, \"Critical Work and Radical Pedagogy: Recalling Herbert Marcuse\" (46 page pdf). It is also available in hard copy (as a booklet) for $15 at www.createspace.com. This is a discussion document that can also be seen as supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement through critical analysis and by invoking some of Herbert Marcuse's most radical statements and ideas.\n\nCharles Howard did a write-up on Angela Davis at the conference and at the 10/28 \"Occupy\" march in Philadelphia (with 14 min. YouTube clip of Angela speaking, starts 4:00), 11/1/11 on Huffington Post: \"Angela Davis: Power to the Imagination.\"\n\nPeter Marcuse published a new blog entry on 11/3: \"Occupy Wall Street’s Common Message to its Diverse Potential Supporters\"\n\nNicolás Varela contributes pdfs of several Spanish translations and secondary works (first two added to Publications page):\n\na Spanish translation of Herbert's 1969 Essay on Liberation: \"Un ensayo sobre la liberación\" (94 page pdf, cropped so that it prints nicely with 2 pages per sheet)\n\nLa sociedad industrial y el Marxismo (1969) (101 page pdf, also cropped for 2 pages/sheet printing)\n\nA 48-page Chilean book comprised of\n\nCarlos Maldonado, Marcuse y el poder joven [and the power of youth] , and\n\nSergio Vuskovic, Lenin o Marcuse?\n\nNicholas's own new book on Nietzsche came out in 2010: Nietzsche contra la democracia: el pensamiento politico de Friedrich Nietzsche (1862-1872). (amazon page)\n\nNov. 27, 2011: Some more new items:\n\nPeter-Erwin Jansen and Charles Reitz contribute some photos from the Philadelphia conference:\n\n353. Peter Marcuse (left), Peter-Erwin Jansen (back), Douglas Kellner, discuss topic at session\n\n357. Angela Davis entering hall at University of Pennsylvania to speak.\n\n371.

Arnold Farr, University of Kentucky, founder International Herbert Marcuse Society, introduces Angela Davis; wider angle\n\n547. Andrew Feenberg and Angela Davis at march\n\n572. Conference dinner\n\nWilliam Leiss has a recent autobiographical interview published in CTheory magazine.\n\nDec. 12, 2011:\n\n\"Occupy This: Is It Comeback Time for Herbert Marcuse?\"--nice write-up about the Philly conference in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Dec. 11, 2011, by Carlin Romano, professor of philosophy and humanities at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania.\n\n2012 Announcements (back to top)\n\nFeb. 16, 2012:\n\nOn Feb. 12 in London the 1967 Dialectics of Liberation conference was reenacted with the original organizers and actors playing the roles of leading speakers, including Herbert. See their website with poster.\n\nDangerousMinds.net blog post about the reenactment, Feb. 20. (nicely done)\n\nNote: There is also a 30 min. documentary video about the conference, \"Anatomy of Violence,\" produced and directed by Peter Davis. It includes footage of Herbert: Villon Films \"Anatomy of Violence\" page ($30).\n\nFeb. 24, 2012: A sampling of some recent citations in the news (the first not-so-recent):\n\nGalleycat publishing blog, July 25, 2011, \"Norway Killer Targeted Writers & Lit Professors in Manifesto\" about Anders Behring Breivik, who murdered 8+69 people on July 22. Brevik's compendium of texts, titled 2083 – A European Declaration of Independence, cites Herbert in several places--search this 1518 page pdf to find them. It is pretty much standard Haters' fare: advocating political correctness, women's liberation, multiculturalism. For excerpts, see the Haters' page on this site.\n\n\"A blood-spattered trip through today's lamentable lingo\" Alexander Cockburn's Feb. 10 column in The Week uses Herbert as a lead-in: \"Back in the 1960s, Herbert Marcuse pointed out in one of his books that the Pentagon had given up on verbs. The dialect known as Pentagonese consisted of clotted groups of nouns, marching along in groups of three or four. Verbs, which connected nouns in purposive thrust, were regarded as unreliable and probably subversive. They talked too much, gave too much away.\"\n\nCounterpunch, Feb. 10-12, 2012 \"The Sixties: From Attica to the Fugs Younger Than That Now\" by Ron Jacobs cites Eros & Civ: \"One could argue that, unlike the sexism of today’s media, which bases itself on the complete commodification of the body while also putting a price tag on the emotion of love, it can be argued that the sexism of the Beats and hippies was a genuine attempt to create a world of Eros referred to in Herbert Marcuse’s classic text Eros and Civilization which visualized a society 'based on a fundamentally different experience of being, a fundamentally different relation between man and nature, and fundamentally different existential relations.'\"\n\nAmerican Catholic, Feb. 19, 2012 A.D.[sic!] \"In the Birth Control Controversy, the Mocking of Conservative Religious Women by Militant Secularists Will Soon Backfire\" by Dave Hartline. This is one for the Haters' page: \"Families that adhere to the clinically proven facts of Natural Family Planning are treated as if they are some sort of religious nuts. Militant secularists in the corridors of power (Legislative and Fourth Estate) have even thrown out their favorite term “sexually repressed.” Now this term is so widely repeated in our popular culture, perhaps we should examine where it came from. Herbert Marcuse (1898-1979) of the infamous Marxist “Frankfurt School” came up with the term. Marcuse left pre-World War II Germany and taught at Columbia. Marcuse believed in free love and surmised that the more narcissistic society was with regard to sexual relations, the better the world would become. Before his death, he claimed his prized student was 1960s militant radical Angela Davis. Marcuse was way out in left field in his day and yet the militant secularists in our pop culture have made him seem as mainstream as Dr. Phil. When societies turn away from religion they embrace the crazies like Marcuse; sadly something has to fill the vacuum and it is usually the ideas which come from the half baked among us that do so.\"\n\nApril 6, 2013: another delayed addition to the Books About page:\n\n2011: Charles Reitz and Stephen Spartan, \"Critical Work and Radical Pedagogy: Recalling Herbert Marcuse,\" 44pages; paper presented at the 2011 Critical Refusals conference of the International Herbert Marcuse Society. (pdf for on-screen; formatted for printing)\n\nReitz wrote in Oct. 2011: \"This is a discussion document that can also be seen as supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement through critical analysis and by invoking some of Herbert Marcuse's most radical statements and ideas.\"\n\nApr. 23, 2013: A new art book with quotations from Herbert's works was published in January:\n\nHerbert Marcuse. Versprechen, dass es anders sein kann. Promise that it can be different; paintings: Antje Wichtrey, afterword by Peter-Erwin Jansen. Bilingual reprint of the one-of-a-kind art book by Antje Wichtrey about Hebert Marcuse. Edition Boot, Granada·Frankfurt, 2013, € 25 / $ 30.\n\nThe book can be purchased by contacting Peter-Erwin Jansen via email: petererwinjansen(a)aol.com.\n\nYou can see four of the 15 double page spreads at Anthe Wichtrey's website.\n\nThe quotation text in the sample image above reads:\n\n\"Rationality is indeed an essential aspect of art: making present (re-present) of that which is depressed, hidden, distorted - not as end in itself but as elements in the creation of the aesthetic universe: the universe of form. For it still holds true: form is the triumph over the destructive disorder and order, the banning of fear.\"\n\nJuly 5, 2013: In the month of the 115th anniversary of Herbert's birth there's a lot going on!\n\nHis family and numerous scholars are exploring institutions in the US where an archive and study center for secondary materials about Herbert and Critical Theory might be established. In addition to the conference in November in Lexington (see below), after a chance discovery of the manuscript to One-Dimensional Man in a box of donated manuscripts at Brandeis, Brandeis is thinking of organizing a conference about Herbert. And one may be in the works at Cornell as well. Stay tuned.\n\nUCSD's library has many materials relating to Herbert in its special collections, for instance:\n\n\"University of California, San Diego, Office of the Chancellor (McGill, 1968-1970), files concerning Herbert Marcuse, Archives 941 Rec, Mandeville Department of Special Collections.\" (referenced in note 5 of Winter 1991 edition of the San Diego History Quarterly).\n\nJuly 29, 2013: new publication on Books About page: Raffaele Laudani (ed.), Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort Franz Neumann, Herbert Marcuse & Otto Kirchheimer, foreword by Raymond Geuss (Princeton University Press, 2013), 704 pages. (PUP website with TOC & pdf of introduction; $40 at amazon.com)\n\nPublisher's blurb: \" During the Second World War, three prominent members of the Frankfurt School--Franz Neumann, Herbert Marcuse, and Otto Kirchheimer--worked as intelligence analysts for the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime forerunner of the CIA. This book brings together their most important intelligence reports on Nazi Germany, most of them published here for the first time.\"\n\nKevin B. Anderson added to the Scholars' page.\n\nJuly 18, 2013: Interested in what Herbert was doing before he went to Freiburg to study with Heidegger? Here a 74-page pdf scan of his 1925 Schiller-Bibliographie: unter Benutzung der Trömelschen Schiller-Bibliothek (1865) (Berlin: Martin Fraenkel, 1925), 137 pages. (added to publications page) [link fixed 8/19/13]\n\nCited in Douglas Kellner, Herbert Marcuse and the Crisis of Marxism (1984), p. 385n54: \"Marcuse expressed his evaluation of the Schiller bibliography to me in an interview on 26 March 1978.\"\n\nAug. 11, 2012: From Martin Schulz, Stuttgart, via this page's guestbook, a 2:57 min. YouTube clip showing the arrival of Herbert's ashes at the Berlin cemetery in July 2003 (uploaded Dec. 2011; 64 views on 8/17/2012). The Cadillac hearse, by the way, was used for Marlene Dietrich and Benno Ohnesorg, and this was its last trip before being put in a museum.\n\nAugust 17, 2012: Robespierre de Oliveira is planning a Marcuse conference in Brazil in 2015. He has put a couple of his relevant publications on the web:\n\n\"A teoria crítica como teoria da mudança social: o marxismo de Marcuse\" ('Critical Theory as Theory of Social Change: The Marxism of Marcuse'), in: Marxism and Human Sciences (2011), pp. 59-70 (need to scroll down).\n\n\"Crítica Cultural e Sociedade Unidimensional\" ('Culture Critique and One-dimensional Society'), in: Arte e Filosofia 11(2011?), 158-169.

Cultural critique concerns the critique of culture as much as of society, in the same way Marx showed the relation between material production and spiritual reproduction of society. In this way, Benjamin developed his criticism of cinema, Adorno coined an expression “culture industry,” and Marcuse “repressive de-sublimation”. Benjamin noted the effects on experience by new technologies of cultural reproduction. Adorno pointed out the regression of hearing in the phenomenon of music distribution, which could be extended to the regression of the senses. Marcuse also developed the “loss” with the concept of “repressive de-sublimation” pointing to the one-dimensional society. The changes in contemporary society show the limits of Frankfurt School cultural criticism, but at the same time show its relevance\n\nAug. 25, 2012: In December 1971 Herbert requested a conversation with Israeli Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan. In the Spring 2012 issue of Telos Zvi Tauber published an article about the meeting and a translation of the minutes of the meeting. These have been added to the Interviews section of the Sound and Video page (although they are print renditions), as well as to the 2012 section of the Books About page.\n\nAugust 31, 2013: I'm posting a number of new items that I've become aware of:\n\nThe Nov. 7-9 Int'l Herbert Marcuse Society Conference is approaching, and the poster has been released. Here is a 6x9\" pdf for printing if you want to post this.\n\nRichard V. Kahn, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement (New York: Peter Lang, 2010) has extensive discussions of Herbert's work over 36 mentions in the book (according to a google books search). Here's a sample:\n\np. 22: \"Recently, Latin American theorists of ecopedagogy have begun to connect their work to the critical theory of Herbert Marcuse (Magelhaes, 2004; Delgado, 2005) ... . As recent critical readers on Marcuse assert (Kellner, Lewis, Pierce & Cho, 2008; Abromeit & Cobb, 2004), ecological politics were an important aspect of Marcuse's revolutionary critique, and he should be considered a central theorist of the relationship between advanced capitalist society and the manifestation of ecological crisis.\" ($25/35 & searchable on amazon)\n\nAn essay by a German historian now at UC San Diego, offering a 'contemporary reading' of one of Herbert's most famous--and most vilified by the right--essays, Repressive Tolerance:\n\nFrank Biess, \"Gewalt der Toleranz, Toleranz der Gewalt: Herbert Marcuse: Repressive Toleranz (1965),\" in: Gewalt und Gesellschaft: Klassiker modernen Denkens neu gelesen: Bernd Weisbrod zum 65. Gebutstag (Wallstein, 2011), 285-293. (5 page pdf).\n\nThe title translates as 'The Violence of Tolerance, the Tolerance of Violence.\"\n\nCharles Reitz (ed.), Crisis and Commonwealth: Marcuse, Marx, McLaren (Lexington Books, 2013), 332 pages. ($95 at amazon; flyer for 20% discount)\n\nThis book \"advances Marcuse scholarship by presenting four hitherto untranslated and unpublished manuscripts by Herbert Marcuse from the Frankfurt University Archive on themes of economic value theory, socialism, and humanism. Contributors to this edited collection, notably Peter Marcuse, Henry Giroux, Peter McLaren, Zvi Tauber, Arnold L. Farr and editor, Charles Reitz, are deeply engaged with the foundational theories of Marcuse and Marx with regard to a future of freedom, equality, and justice. Douglas Dowd furnishes the critical historical context with regard to U.S. foreign and domestic policy, particularly its features of economic imperialism and militarism. Reitz draws these elements together to show that the writings by Herbert Marcuse and these formidable authors can ably assist a global movement toward intercultural commonwealth. \"\n\nA forthcoming collection of seminal Frankfurt School writings will include 4 essays by Herbert:\n\nRuth Groff (ed.), Subject and Object Frankfurt School Writings on Epistemology, Ontology and Method (Bloomsbury, March 2014)(publisher's book page), namely:\n\n* Epistomology: “A Note on Dialectic” (8pp.)[1930 essay or 1941 in Reason & Revolution]\n\n* Ontology: “The Concept of Essence” (45pp.) [1936 essay, translated in Negations, 1968]\n\n* Method: “Critical Theory and Philosophy” (25pp.)[1937 essay, translated in Negations, 1968]\n\n* “Karl Popper and the Problem of Historical Laws” (17pp.) [1959 essay, republished 1972]\n\nNovember 7-9, 2013: FIFTH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE of the International Herbert Marcuse Society at the University of Kentucky, Lexington.

Farr, Department of Philosophy, [email protected], and see the International Herbert Marcuse Society website.\n\nThe Call for Papers (3 page pdf) was released in April--abstracts are due July 1, 2013.\n\nThe conference theme is: \"Emancipation, New Sensibility, and the Challenge of a New Era: Theory, Practice, and Pedagogy.\"\n\nSept. 23, 2013: \"But what are we to make of a society in which liberation is defined as scarfing down a ham sandwich?\" In a July 2013 blog post about a New York Times article about employees actually taking lunch breaks, Corey Robin writes: \"Back in the 1960s, Herbert Marcuse coined a phrase in One-Dimensional Man for capitalism’s ability to use (and tame) an emancipated sexuality for the sake of advancing capitalism itself: repressive desublimation. The basic argument was that the fantasy and idea of liberation could be mobilized to reproduce the very system that produced a need for liberation.\"\n\nOct. 13, 2013: The program for the upcoming Int'l HM Society conference (Nov. 7-9 in Louisville) is now available. In the final panel, an archivist from Brandeis university will report on the discovery of the manuscript of One-Dimensional Man.\n\nTwo articles have recently been published about it:\n\nChronicle of Higher Education, 10/4/13: \"A Philosopher's Change of Heart. A newly discovered early draft of Herbert Marcuse's best-known book may change how scholars view his work.\" (4 page draft pdf; scan of article; Chronicle site [behind paywall]; )\n\nBrandeis Now, 10/13/13: \"Discovered manuscript shows Marcuse’s evolution. Draft of the former politics professor's 'One-Dimensional Man' at Brandeis archives\"\n\nOct. 25, 2012: Trying to catch up on adding a few new things:\n\nJoanne Arnott's March 2012 blog entry about Erika Sherover (also redesign of my page about Ricky with a navbar at top and 5 sections)\n\nDec. 4 , 2012: Herbert and Heidegger\n\nI came across this reference on the German Heidegger Wikipedia page:\n\nFrithjof Rodi (Hrsg.): Martin Heidegger, Wilhelm Diltheys Forschungsarbeit und der gegenwärtige Kampf um eine historische Weltanschauung. 10 Vorträge, gehalten in Kassel vom 16. bis 21. April 1925. Maschinenschriftliche Abschrift von Herbert Marcuse nach einer Nachschrift von Walter Bröcker. In: Dilthey-Jahrbuch für Philosophie und Geschichte der Geisteswissenschaften Band 8 / 1992-93, S. 143 bis177.\n\nThus at a later time Herbert transcribed lectures Heidegger gave about Dilthey in 1925.\n\nThe Heidegger texts are available on google books (minus 8 pages or so). The Nachwort notes that Walter Bröcker (another Heidegger student) made the original stenographic notes and then transcribed them longhand, from which Herbert created the 31 page typescript, which is preserved with Herbert's papers in Frankfurt. It cites the following:\n\nThomas Regehly, \"Übersicht über die 'Heideggeriana' im Herbert-Marcuse-Archive der Stadt- und Universitätsbibliothek in Frankfurt am Main,\" in: Heidegger Studies 7(1991), 179-209. (also added to my Herbert-Heidegger page, at the bottom)\n\nMahon O’Brien, \"Re-assessing the ‘Affair’: The Heidegger Controversy Revisited ,\" in: The Social Science Journal 47 (2010), 1–20 (author's copy).\n\nDec. 29, 2012 additions to Booksabout and Courses pages, plus some random things:\n\nBob Samuels' Dec. 12, 2012 blog: \"The One-Dimensional University: The Destructive Marriage of Technology and Administration.\" Bob is a writing instructor at UCLA, union organizer, and tireless advocate for implementing and improving universal undergraduate instruction.\n\nLuis Diego Fernandez's Sept. 8, 2012 article in N: Revista di Cultura: ' El rescate de un hedonismo libertario: La reedición de tres obras clave de Herbert Marcuse expone el pensamiento de uno de los portavoces del “freudomarxismo”.'\n\n[The rescue of a libertarian hedonism: The reissue of three books on Herbert Marcuse's thought exposes a spokesman of \"Freudian Marxism\"]\n\nThe \"Philosophy Documentation Center\" at pdcnet.org has 936 documents in a search on \"marcuse\"--mostly reviews of his works, and reviews of works about his works.\n\nFor example, this 1970 summary of Negations in The Review of Metaphysics."
