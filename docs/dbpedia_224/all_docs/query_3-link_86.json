        "text": "This blog entry was originally posted last year on June 1, 2023 to celebrate Classical Hollywood era icon Marilyn Monroeâ€™s then 97th birthday â€“ or what would have been her then 97th birthday. Almost everything written here for her 98th birthday remains the same.\n\nA polite reminder before reading this blog entry of mine ðŸ™‚ I will not tolerate any insults or negativity towards my subject of this post. This blog entry is strictly for dyed-in-the-wool Marilyn Monroe fans like myself or fans in general. So once again, please be kind ðŸ™‚\n\nThis Happy Birthday blog entry is dedicated to Classical Hollywood era icon Marilyn Monroe, who would have been 98 years-old today on June 1. In other words, I would like to wish a very Happy Birthday to Marilyn Monroe. Considering that her tragic life has been dwelled upon endlessly, misunderstood by men and women alike (well-intentioned or otherwise), not to mention exploited, I am dedicating this entry solely to Marilyn Monroeâ€™s achievements onscreen. For myself, Marilyn Monroe is truly the embodiment of a goddess. In other words, Monroe is an iconic sex symbol, who succeeds brilliantly at both comedy and drama. When it came to the former, Marilyn Monroe took the stereotypical dumb blonde (a term I hate) persona of her characters and deconstructed it. For example, click here to see what I mean. To put it in other words, it is us viewers, who come off as the bumbling idiots for thinking that she was one ðŸ™‚ I could link to many others, but for me, no other comedy of Monroeâ€™s demonstrates her deconstruction of the aforementioned trope given to her more perfectly than in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. As for the latter, Monroe displayed her dramatic chops masterfully in quite a few films. Once again, I could ramble on and on, but If I had to single out my number one favorite in terms of drama, it would be her performance as Cherie in Bus Stop. Check out Monroeâ€™s bus conversation scene by clicking here and her rendition of That Old Black Magic by clicking here. Speaking of which, my number one favorite Monroe rendition also happens to be her most iconic â€“ Diamonds Are a Girlâ€™s Best Friend. The number features Monroe wearing a shocking pink dress (designed by William Travilla) singing about her love of diamonds surrounded by adoring men dressed in suits and bow ties (and much more). Click here to watch the link â€“ the number begins at the 0:50 mark. Cover versions post-1953 range from Lena Horne to Megan Thee Stallion (read here). In addition, entertainers ranging from singer Madonna to actress Margot Robbie (read here) have not only paid homage to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes aforementioned musical number, but also wore pink dresses similar to the one Monroe was dressed in while performing it.\n\nBefore I share with you dear readers all of my favorite Marilyn Monroe films, I would like to show you all some links below.\n\nHere is a link to an appreciation of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes by one of my many favorite female writers, which in this case is the Chicago-based film aficionado Caroline Siede\n\nHere is a youtube video link to another iconic number from the film entitled Two Little Girls from Little Rock\n\nMy UK readers may have seen the above musical number parodied by British comediennes Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders on the long running sketch comedy series French and Saunders â€“ click here\n\nHere is a youtube video link to legendary French actress Catherine Deneuve and her late older sister Francoise Dorleac performing the song Chanson dâ€™un jour dâ€™ete (Summer Day Song) in Jacques Demyâ€™s 1967 musical masterpiece The Young Girls of Rochefort. In the film, the two actresses play twins. The musical number and the dresses worn by the two leading ladies are subtly similar (If not completely) to how Two Little Girls from Little Rock was performed.

Click here to watch\n\nAmerican comedienne Rachel Bloom loosely parodied the visual style of Diamonds Are a Girlâ€™s Best Friend (only replace anything colored red and pink with blue) in an episode of the satirical 2010â€™s CW television program Crazy Ex-Girlfriend â€“ click here and here to see it\n\nHere is a youtube video link to American broadcast journalist Edward R.

Which ones did you all find the most fascinating?\n\nBesides Some Like It Hot, what are your other favorite Marilyn Monroe films?\n\nA polite reminder before reading this blog entry of mine ðŸ™‚ I will not tolerate any insults or negativity towards my subject of this post. This blog entry is strictly for dyed-in-the-wool Sheryl Lee fans like myself or fans in general. So once again, please be kind ðŸ™‚\n\nOne more thing: I will not tolerate any negativity towards Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me or Twin Peaks in general. Any negative comments will be deleted, so I am politely asking you all to be kind to the subject of my post ðŸ™‚\n\nMost of my dear readers are probably aware of this by now, but I am a massive fan of not only legendary director David Lynch and Twin Peaks (read here, here and here), but also of the immensely beautiful and talented actress Sheryl Lee, who portrayed the doomed Laura Palmer on the aforementioned series. So what better way to honor than to wish Sheryl Lee a very happy 57th birthday. If Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me had been widely acclaimed during itâ€™s initial 1992 theatrical release, it is undeniable that she would have gone on to have a prestigious career. Thankfully, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me has since been re-assessed as one of director Lynchâ€™s greatest films. Lee deserved so much more after that, but then again, she was probably just too good for the mainstream. Even in brief appearances, Lee stands out. Based on all of the video links I am about to give, the words gorgeous, intelligent, kind-hearted, nice (and once again) talented are the ones that best describe Lee on a whole.\n\nSince I would have to dedicate an entire different blog entry regarding every other four-star film she was in, I have decided to focus solely on her work in Twin Peaks. The one thing I can guarantee my dear readers here is that I gave everything Twin Peaks related * * * * (out of * * * *) stars. I would love to take this time to direct my dear readers to a bunch of links below regarding Lee and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me:\n\nHere is a youtube video link to a 2021 Q&A with actors Sheryl Lee and Dana Ashbrook at Chicagoâ€™s Music Box Theatre: during a special screening of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\n\nClick here to view Part 1\n\nClick here to view Part 2\n\nClick here to view Part 3\n\nClick here to view Part 4\n\nClick here to view Part 5\n\nClick here to view a 2013 HollywoodChicago.com interview with actresses Sheryl Lee and Sherilyn Fenn\n\nClick here to view some past coverage of the Wizard World Chicago 2012 (now called Fan Expo Chicago) convention that featured actresses Sheryl Lee and Sherilyn Fenn as two of the guests.\n\nClick here to view a preview of this 2019 Milwaukee Film Festival Q&A with actors Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise during a special screening of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.
