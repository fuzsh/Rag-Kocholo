        "text": "Italian progressive rock band\n\nGoblin (also Back to the Goblin, New Goblin, Goblin Rebirth, the Goblin Keys, the Goblins and Claudio Simonetti's Goblin) is an Italian progressive rock band known for their film scores. They frequently collaborate with Dario Argento, most notably creating the scores for Profondo Rosso in 1975 and Suspiria in 1977. Because their collaborator Dario Argento specializes in creating horror, suspense and slasher/giallo genre movies, scores made by Goblin in these movies often had eerie and ominous tones. CD re-releases of their scores have performed well, especially in Germany and Japan. Goblin returned with a series of live concerts in Europe in 2009 and in North America in 2013.\n\nInitially recording as Cherry Five (they had done some live shows as Oliver), their early work spawned one eponymous progressive rock record, and they were then called in to compose the score for Profondo Rosso. The band changed their name to Goblin, rewriting most of the score, originally written by Giorgio Gaslini including the famous main theme. The 1975 soundtrack album was a huge hit.[where?] After a reshuffle in their line-up, they put out an instrumental progressive rock album Roller, before working with Argento again for 1977's Suspiria. Other film scores and a concept album (Il Fantastico Viaggio Del Bagarozzo Mark) followed, then the score for the European version of George A. Romero's 1978 Dawn of the Dead. In both this and Suspiria's opening title sequences, they are credited as \"The Goblins with Dario Argento\". Tracks 1, 2 and 7 from the European version are also in the American version of the film.\n\nDespite their success, membership continued to be a revolving door. The remaining members continued to work on further scores, and there was a partial reunification of three of the four band members for Argento's Tenebrae (1982), credited to the three band members, but not as Goblin. The last collaboration with Argento took place in 2001, with the film Sleepless.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOliver, 1972–1975\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 1972 and 1973, Claudio Simonetti (keyboards) and Massimo Morante (guitars), aided by Fabio Pignatelli (bass guitar) and Walter Martino (drums), recorded some demo tapes using the name Oliver.\n\nOn a trip to London, while looking for contacts, the band bumped into Eddy Offord, then producer of Yes. After listening to a demo tape, the tycoon producer expressed interest and asked them to move to England. By then, Fabio Pignatelli had become a steady member, and the band found a regular drummer, Carlo Bordini, and an English lead vocalist (Clive Haynes). After many months of rehearsing, they returned to London while Offord was on tour with Yes in the US; after many performances and various attempts at striking deals with record houses, they were forced to go back to Italy, due to lack of funds.\n\nCherry Five\n\n[edit]\n\nBack home, they signed with Cinevox, and Clive Haynes was replaced by Tony Tartarini who had previously recorded with L'Uovo Di Colombo under the name Toni Gionta. The band's name was changed to Cherry Five by the label, and according to Claudio Simonetti for no apparent reason, as the members themselves had intended to continue as \"Oliver.\" Whatever debate about the band's name there may have existed, their first LP was titled Cherry Five. Cinevox Records was active mainly in soundtrack publishing. Due to the band's peculiar sound, the band was frequently called to perform and arrange famous musicians' compositions. This helped them better understand the world of soundtracks and the particular techniques required. Their final act as Cherry Five was to drop new drummer Carlo Bordini and bring back Walter Martino on drums.\n\nSuccess and film scores, 1975–1978\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the beginning of 1975, the band began a cooperation with Giorgio Gaslini on the Profondo rosso film project. The band replaced Martino (who went on to join the band Libra) with Agostino Marangolo (of the band Flea on the Honey/Flea/Etna) during this period. Martino recorded on all but two cuts of Profondo rosso.\n\nBy chance, after three or four days of recording, Gaslini left the film after a conflict with Dario Argento, so Argento decided to try the band's hand at composing, giving them one night to write a score, and one day to record it. To distinguish this new release from their first LP which was just about to be marketed, the band changed their name again, this time to Goblin. Their success exceeded all expectations: more than one million copies sold, enjoying 52 weeks on the Italian hit charts and ranking first in both the singles and LP categories. It launched a highly successful period for the band, which came to an end in 1978 when the band split after the recording of Dario Argento's cut of George Romero's Zombi (also known as Dawn of the Dead). (On the score for the European version of the soundtrack, they were credited as \"The Goblins.\")\n\nIn 1976, they collaborated with Willy Brezza to compose the score to Perché si uccidono (the film was released in the US as \"Percy is Killed\", but this was a mis-translation and there is no character even called Percy in the film). For the only time, Goblin used the name Il Reale Impero Britannico due to the controversial subject matter of the movie (drug abuse and addiction). Willy Brezza wrote the original score, and the remaining tracks were written by the band together with Fabio Frizzi. The following year they scored the Italian crime film The Heroin Busters (La via della droga), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, and starring Fabio Testi and David Hemmings.\n\nFragmentation, 1978–1982\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 1978 and 1979, the band's core musicians recruited many new members consecutively.[why?] Fabio Pignatelli, Agostino Marangolo, his brother Antonio Marangolo (a saxophonist who contributed to several albums) and nephew Carlo Pennisi (a session man who often played in place of Massimo Morante when he was absent) all worked together from 1980 to 1982 in the band, Flea on the Honey, which managed to record several LPs. Pignatelli took part in all the recordings, with Agostino Marangolo ranking lead for number of performances. The remaining members continued to work on further scores, and there was a partial reunification for Argento's Tenebrae (1982) (although each member of the band was credited separately, not as Goblin). Over time, it was three of the \"founding fathers\" (Pignatelli, Simonetti and Morante), plus Marongolo, who became synonymous with the name Goblin.\n\nReunion for Sleepless score, 2000\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter 22 years of hiatus, in 2000, the group reformed to score the Dario Argento thriller Non ho sonno (Sleepless). The score was a great success and showed the group could still make great music, much to their fans' delight. The group were scheduled to perform in Tarrytown, New York for the infamous Cult-Con, but failed to appear. Simonetti did however appear at the show and informed fans that old wounds resurfaced during their brief reunion. With his horror theme tribute band, Daemonia (formed by Titta Tani, Bruno Previtali, Federico Amorosi, and Simonetti himself), he performed a nine-song set from the films of Dario Argento, and Goblin later officially disbanded.\n\nBack To The Goblin, 2005–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nBackToTheGoblin2005\n\n[edit]\n\nNevertheless, in 2005, with the release of Giovanni Aloisio's official Goblin biography and the opening of their official website, Morante and Pignatelli reformed the group once again and with Marangolo and Guarini recorded the album BackToTheGoblin2005 under the independent label BackToTheFudda. The album was available only through the official site[1] and was not distributed in regular stores. It is also available on iTunes.\n\n2009 reunion tour\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2009, Goblin, now Back To The Goblin, made their first live concert appearance in 32 years. Keyboardist Aidan Zammit has joined the band for their live performances. Excluding Simonetti, this is basically the \"classic\" line-up, with Maurizio Guarini contributing keyboard work to most of their original albums, playing on Roller, Chi?, Suspiria, Buio Omega, Patrick, Contamination, St. Helens, Notturno, Volo, BackToTheGoblin and more. The five members (Morante, Guarini, Pignatelli, Marangolo, and Aidan Zammit) performed a few concerts around Europe in 2009:\n\nDonaufestival in Krems, Austria on 23 April 2009\n\nLa villette sonique in Paris - 29 May\n\nDancity Festival at the Auditorium San Domenico - Foligno - 25 June\n\nSupersonic Festival in Birmingham, UK - 26 July\n\nScala, London - 27 July\n\nIn December 2009, Back to the Goblin once again announced their dissolution due to internal conflict. The remaining scheduled concerts into 2010 were then canceled.\n\nNew Goblin/Goblin Rebirth and the Goblin Keys, 2010–present\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Goblin were scheduled to perform at Unsound Festival Kraków on 23 October 2010, consisting of Claudio Simonetti in the line-up, as well as Morante, Guarini, Bruno Previtali and Titta Tani.[2] Essentially, it was three members of the classic lineup and two members of Simonetti's other band, Daemonia (Previtali and Tani being the bassist and drummer, respectively, of that band).\n\nYet another incarnation of the band, formed in December 2010 and called Goblin Rebirth, includes former Goblin members Fabio Pignatelli and Agostino Marangolo plus Giacomo Anselmi on guitars, Aidan Zammit and Danilo Cherni on keyboards.\n\nIn 2011, the monumental 450-page book, Goblin sette note in rosso (Goblin seven notes in red) was released, written by Fabio Capuzzo. It traces the full history of Goblin from 1973 to 2011 with a detailed analysis of all the albums and movies with music performed by Goblin (including all the works as session musicians). It also details full biographies, exclusive interviews and contains discographies and filmographies of the Italian composers who created scores for police, giallo and horror movies, and information about all the Italian rock bands with a role in movie soundtracks.\n\nIn 2011/2012, New Goblin (Morante, Guarini, Simonetti, Previtali and Tani) had activity around the world, including Japan (twice), Australia (twice) and New Zealand.\n\nIn April 2012, Claudio Simonetti and now-Greater Toronto based Maurizio Guarini performed with drummer Bob Scott and guitarist Chris Gartner,[3] in Shock Stock 2012 on 14 April 2012 as The Goblin Keys.[4] On 24 June 2013, the New Goblin line-up announced their first-ever North American tour and under their original banner, Goblin, played 17 dates in October 2013, with Secret Chiefs 3 as the opening act.[5]\n\nTour and Simonetti's Goblin, 2013–present\n\n[edit]\n\nSimonetti has since formed another incarnation of the band called Claudio Simonetti's Goblin, which features him and the other members of his horror film theme cover group Daemonia.[6] In February 2014 they began touring and playing complete scores live during screenings of the films Deep Red, Suspiria and Dawn of the Dead. In April 2014, the band was slated to tour, performing the score to Dawn of the Dead live throughout North America, but in July the tour was canceled. In June 2014 Claudio Simonetti's Goblin released an album titled The Murder Collection, consisting of new versions of some of Goblin and Simonetti's most well-known compositions.\n\n4/5 of original Goblin members reunion, live and studio activity, 2013–present\n\n[edit]\n\nGoblin returned for a second US tour leg in December 2013 with Simonetti, Bruno Previtali and Titta Tani being replaced by original members Fabio Pignatelli and Agostino Marangolo and additional keyboard player Aidan Zammit. The reunited band played 13 dates mostly in Midwest US.\n\nIn April and May 2014, Goblin returned in US for the third time. Aidan Zammit was replaced by Steve Moore of the band Zombi and Goblin played nine dates throughout the southern United States.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 2014, Massimo Morante, Maurizio Guarini, Fabio Pignatelli and Agostino Marangolo announced that, as Goblin, they released an album of new material titled Four of a Kind and started a crowdfunding campaign through the website pledgemusic.com to help complete it.[citation needed]\n\nIn June 2015, Goblin Rebirth released their self-titled debut album and did various live appearances.[citation needed]\n\nAlso in 2015, Cherry Five reformed with original members Carlo Bordini and Tony Tartarini along with new members Ludovico Piccinini (guitars), Gianluca De Rossi (keyboards) and Pino Sallusti (bass) and released an album titled Il Pozzo dei Giganti.[7] On 3 April 2017. bassist Pino Sallusti died.[citation needed]\n\nIn early 2017, Goblin (Morante, Guarini, Pignatelli, Marangolo with Aidan Zammit) resumed live performance with three concerts in Europe: Sweden, Norway and Greece.[citation needed]\n\nFrom 26 October 2017 through 12 November, Goblin toured North America on their 'Sound of Fear' tour with 13 dates in US and 2 in Canada.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 2017, the US publishing house Ajna published Fabio Capuzzo’s Goblin Seven Notes in Red, the full revised and updated English version of the Italian book Goblin sette note in rosso.[8]\n\nIn May 2018, Goblin appeared on the debut full-length Princess album with a new song called \"God Save the Goblin\" (Pignatelli/Wolf/Guarini/Morante/Marangolo) plus a couple of featuring (one by Fabio Pignatelli and another by Tony Tartarini).[citation needed]\n\nGoblin appeared at the Psycho Las Vegas on 19 August 2018.[citation needed]\n\nA Goblin album, Fearless, was released at the end of 2018.[citation needed]\n\nClaudio Simonetti's Goblin actively toured Europe and North America from 2019 - 2022 with a break for COVID[9]\n\nMassimo Morante died in June 2022, at the age of 69.[10][11]\n\nGoblin are set to appear at the Haugaland Prog & Rock festival 24 on 2 November 2024. No confirmation regarding who is in the current lineup.\n\nStyle and influences\n\n[edit]\n\nAllMusic's review of Goblin's soundtrack for Deep Red describes the score as \"an ambitious affair that blends jazz, prog rock, and heavy metal into an effective and totally distinctive style\"[12] and the track \"Deep Shadows\" as \"a frenetic slice of King Crimson-style jazz-rock\".[12]\n\nInfluences cited by Goblin include Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, Gentle Giant and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.[citation needed] The band Zombi was influenced by Goblin.[13] The band Opeth included an instrumental titled \"Goblin\" on their eleventh album, Pale Communion, in tribute to the band.[citation needed]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nGoblin\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Directed by Singles / on compilations Latest CD / digital release 1975 Profondo Rosso film soundtrack Dario Argento Cinevox / MDF 070: Profondo Rosso (3:45) / Death Dies (3:37) Cinevox / CD OST-PK 019 / 2015 Gamma TV series soundtrack (With Enrico Simonetti) Cinevox / MDF 084: Gamma (2:20) / Drug's Theme (3:43) Bella Casa / CASA10CD / 2007 Cherry Five (As Cherry Five) The Swan Is A Murderer (Pt. 1) (4:26) Cinevox / CD OST 703 / 2010 1976 Percy is Killed (As Il Reale Impero Britannico) (With Willy Brezza) Mauro Macario Edda (3:03) Cinevox / CD OST-PK031 / 2017 Roller Cinevox / MDF 097: Roller (4:38) / Snip-Snap (3:37) Cinevox / CD OST 715/s / 2012 Chi? television theme Cinevox / SC 1090: Chi?
