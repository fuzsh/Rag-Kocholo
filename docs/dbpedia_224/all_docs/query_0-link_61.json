It stars Oliver Reed and Fabio Testi. The film's theme, \"Un Amico\", was scored by Ennio Morricone and was also featured in Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAn Italian prison official's wife is kidnapped, and the kidnappers demand that a notorious prisoner be released in order for the man to get his wife back. He gets the man released - but then kidnaps him himself, in order to ensure that the man's colleagues do not kill his wife. Enraged, the gang sets out to free their compatriot and kill the man who took him.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nOliver Reed as Vito Cipriani\n\nFabio Testi as Milo Ruiz\n\nAgostina Belli as Anna Cipriani\n\nPaola Pitagora as Carlotta\n\nDaniel Beretta as Al Niko\n\nFrédéric de Pasquale as Michel Granier\n\nMarc Mazza as Bald Police Inspector\n\nReinhard Kolldehoff as French Lawyer\n\nBernard Giraudeau as Sicilian Kidnapper\n\nPeter Berling as Grappa\n\nAlexander Stephan (as Gunnar Warner) as Jean-Daniel Auger\n\nCalisto Calisti as Maresciallo Fantuzzi\n\nSteffen Zacharias as Joe Le Corse\n\nMichel Bardinet as French Policeman\n\nSalvatore Borghese as Suicidal Prisoner\n\nGiovanni Pallavicino as Sicilian Kidnapper\n\nMarco Mariani as Carlo DeGregori\n\nJean Degrave as Harmakolas\n\nFranco Moraldi as French Police Chief\n\nOttavio Fanfani as Shopkeeper\n\nGianni Bortolotto as Doctor\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nPaola Pitagora recalls how Oliver Reed always turned up drunk on set (something confirmed by director Sollima) and as a result there were often difficulties during filming - including an incident in which Reed 'under the influence' crashed a VW bus into a post and Paola Pitagora, who hit her face inside the vehicle, had to wear big sunshades for the rest of the filming to cover up her bruised eyes.[2]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nRevolver was released in Italy on September 27, 1973 where it was distributed theatrically by Panta. The film grossed 477,374,000 Italian lire in Italy.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]"
