        "text": "Women's active participation in various fields of society will generate new ideas and values, give positive impacts on men's activities, and lead to energizing society as a whole. Promoting the formation of a gender-equal society represents \"structural reform in our daily life,\" which we all must fully endeavor to achieve.\n\nThe Japanese government has been encouraging women's active participation in society by launching a strategy for no children waiting lists for day-care centers and support measures for the balancing of work and child raising. Today, women are playing highly important roles in various fields such as construction engineers and pilots as well as in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Iraq. Moreover, certain highly motivated women have joined the Koizumi administration as cabinet ministers, while others have become business managers winning high praise from the international community.\n\nTo further encourage this trend, it is necessary to appropriately strike a balance between various government measures for addressing the falling birthrate, aging society, and policies for the upbringing of youth as well as to gain public understanding from men and women across various generations. With this in mind, the Japanese government will continuously work in collaboration with local governments and voluntary bodies to support the challenging spirit of women."
