        "text": "The new prime minister promises change, upheaval and reform for Japan.\n\nTOKYO - It might not be Camelot. But the breeze blowing through politics here this week is every bit as refreshing to the average Japanese as John F. Kennedy's leap to the Oval Office in 1961 was to many Americans.\n\nThe administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, a ruling Liberal Democratic Party member who swept into power Thursday promising reform, faces lots of problems and little time. With elections for the upper house of Parliament just 12 weeks away, there's not much opportunity to show results. That makes symbolism very important.\n\nYet even symbolism can do a lot for a nation beaten down by a decade of bad news, corruption and economic pain.\n\nFor the first time in years, Japanese feel some hope there's a way out of the darkness that has so corroded self-confidence in this once-proud nation. And even if it's just a couple of weeks before the dark shadows return, it sure feels better than the endless bouts of depression.\n\nThe palace revolt that saw dark horse candidate Koizumi muscle his way into leadership on the wings of grass-roots discontent has deepened the public appetite for details great and small. From tabloids to respected newspapers, the media are obsessing over Japan's quirky new leader, his likes and dislikes, his physique, weight and blood type, and the jousting between the new crowd and the LDP's old regime. Suddenly, many Japanese feel they have a stake in national politics.\n\nIt's very early. But a picture is emerging of what's hot and what's not in the gilded era of \"Koizumi-ism.\" The watchwords are change, upheaval, reform. Even if he can't deliver, say many, let's see where this goes.\n\nKoizumi's Cabinet is young and vibrant, with a record five females and several outsiders, in contrast to the stodgy profile of past LDP administrations. On average, its members are 4.6 years younger than the first Cabinet of just-departed Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori. This is still Japan, however: The average age of Cabinet members is 61.5 years.\n\nHair defines the man\n\nKoizumi's defining characteristic, the counterpart to President Nixon's nose or Mikhail S. Gorbachev's birthmark, is his shaggy mop of permed hair. Like its owner, the mane shows every sign of having a mind of its own. Koizumi's victory over party insider Ryutaro Hashimoto, known for his 1950s slicked-back hair, represents the tress-related triumph of freedom over constraint.\n\nThis week has given Koizumi's barber of 34 years more than his 15 minutes of fame. Teruo Nakagomi of Nakagomi Cuts says the secret to the low-maintenance do of his famous customer is Buru Kon - blue conditioner - that Koizumi slathers on daily between quarterly chemical hair-curling sessions.\n\nFellow barber and wife Tomoko Nakagomi, who has been doing Koizumi's perm all these years, says phone calls are pouring in as word spreads of the magic blue goo - actually Alberto VO5 Consort gel made under Japanese license.\n\nMeddlesome intermediaries are out, straightforward communication is in. Koizumi, who is fluent in English, has called for direct election of the prime minister, eschews off-the-record whispering to reporters and advocates clear lines of government responsibility.\n\nAnd a shocking development: Koizumi decided on many of his Cabinet ministers himself, then called his choices directly to ask if they would accept. For as long as anyone can remember, Japan's top leaders have been told by powerful underlings whom to name.\n\nTwo prestigious Japanese universities have been in a sumo match over whose graduates have greater clout. Keio graduate Koizumi has given a high-profile fillip to his university in the Japanese equivalent of the Harvard vs. Yale rivalry. On Thursday, Koizumi named four Keio alumnae to his inner circle and only three Waseda grads.\n\nNew respect for things weird\n\nOver the years, Koizumi has been called eccentric, quixotic, a weirdo and a heretic as he proselytized for reform to anyone who would listen. Most didn't. This week that all changed, and with it has come some respect for all things a bit weird and for individuality over conformity.\n\nKoizumi, 59, has a life outside politics, and loves heavy metal music, pro wrestling and kick boxing. He is divorced and a single parent who raised two sons. He has been known to wear bright colors and beige sweaters as opposed to the consistent dull suits worn by most party stalwarts.\n\nPoliticians tend to avoid being alone it's more difficult to feel important without an audience of constituents and hangers-on. But solitude takes on a new shine this week, as Japanese learn that Koizumi has traveled for years by himself on ordinary trains. He knows how to buy tickets himself, goes CD shopping solo and seems to understand how real people live.\n\nClear, direct dialogue\n\nKoizumi has vowed with his first nationwide policy speech, scheduled for May 7, to set out clear and direct goals, even as he warned in advance that he's not going to please everyone. He named as his foreign minister firebrand politician Makiko Tanaka, referred to as \"The Bulldozer\" by critics for her blunt approach. \"She speaks so clearly,\" an anonymous Foreign Ministry bureaucrat complained to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. \"We're in for a tough time.\""
