The cabinet was formed after the coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Komeito was re-elected with a slightly reduced majority at the November 2003 general elections. The LDP lost 10 of its pre-election seats to become a minority in the National Diet, but immediately regained a majority by absorbing its coalition partner, the New Conservative Party.[1][2] Koizumi had reshuffled the cabinet less than two months before the election, and so made no changes when he was re-elected by the Diet on November 19.[3]\n\nKoizumi had promised that if re-elected he would send the Self-Defence Forces to Iraq to assist with reconstruction before the end of the year, a pledge which proved unpopular during the election.[4] One month into his second term, the cabinet approved the dispatch, and the SDF joined UN peacekeeping forces in Iraq in 2004, though this action continued to damage Koizumi's standing, with polls showing the public opposed.[5][6] The Koizumi cabinet's policies of structural economic reforms continued during its second term, some of which proved controversial. In the spring of 2004 the government introduced reforms designed to cut pension costs by reducing state benefits and increasing user costs.[7] This policy was not only unpopular, but cost Koizumi a minister when Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda resigned after it was revealed he had failed to make his payments.[8]\n\nThe political fallout from Iraq and the pension reforms led to poor results for the LDP in the July 2004 upper house elections. While the coalition retained its majority, and the LDP remained the largest party, the opposition DPJ narrowly won the largest number of the contested seats. This was considered a setback, and reflective of the Prime Minister's decline in popularity, but Koizumi refused to resign.[9] Two months after the election, Koizumi conducted the first reshuffle of his second cabinet in an attempt to improve his popularity, he changed several key ministers, but kept his key economic team in place.[10][11]\n\nThe centrepiece of Koizumi's economic programme, which he referred to as the \"inner citadel of reform\", was his plan to privatize the postal service, then the world's largest bank with 2 trillion dollars' worth of assets.[12][13] This plan was deeply unpopular with many LDP members, for whom the postal service formed a large part of their base, and it was not until Koizumi's second term that his government was able to finalize the bills and introduced them into the Diet (although the LDP itself did not endorse them).[14] Although the LDP-Komeito coalition enjoyed a lower house majority of nearly 80, when the vote finally occurred a large party rebellion saw the postal bills pass by only 5 votes in July 2005.[15] When the plan was subsequently rejected by the House of Councillors, Koizumi immediately dissolved the Diet and called a snap election for September 2005, refused to endorse the postal rebels, and pledged to resign unless his government was returned with a majority to implement the reform.[16][17] In the election, the LDP won a landslide victory, and Koizumi was re-elected to form his third cabinet in September 2005.[18]\n\n19 November 2003 House of Representatives\n\nAbsolute majority (241/480) required Choice First Vote Votes YJunichiro Koizumi\n\n281 / 480\n\nNaoto Kan\n\n186 / 480\n\nShii Kazuo\n\n9 / 480\n\nAbstentions (Including blank ballots)\n\n3 / 480\n\nSource Diet Minutes - 158th Session\n\nLiberal Democratic\n\nNew Komeito\n\nIndependent\n\nR = Member of the House of Representatives\n\nC = Member of the House of Councillors\n\nSecond Koizumi Cabinet from November 19, 2003 to September 27, 2004 Portfolio Minister Term of office Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi R April 26, 2001 - September 26, 2006 Minister for Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications Tarō Asō R September 22, 2003 - October 31, 2005 Minister of Justice Daizō Nozawa C September 22, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Minister of Foreign Affairs Yoriko Kawaguchi - February 1, 2002 - September 27, 2004 Minister of Finance Sadakazu Tanigaki R September 22, 2003 - September 26, 2006 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Takeo Kawamura R September 22, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare Chikara Sakaguchi R January 6, 2001 - September 27, 2004 Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Yoshiyuki Kamei R April 1, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Shōichi Nakagawa R September 22, 2003 - October 31, 2005 Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Nobuteru Ishihara R September 22, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Minister of the Environment Yuriko Koike R September 22, 2003 - September 26, 2006 Chief Cabinet Secretary\n\nMinister for Gender Equality Yasuo Fukuda R October 27, 2000 - May 7, 2004 Hiroyuki Hosoda R May 7, 2004 - October 31, 2005 Director of the National Public Safety Commission Kiyoko Ono C September 22, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Director of the Japan Defense Agency Shigeru Ishiba R September 30, 2002 - September 27, 2004 Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs\n\nMinister of State (Science and Technology Policy)\n\nMinister of State for Personal Information Protection Toshimitsu Motegi R September 22, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Minister of State for Economic and Fiscal Policy\n\nMinister of State for Financial Services Heizō Takenaka - April 26, 2001 - October 31, 2005 Minister of State for Regulatory Reform\n\nMinister of State for Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan\n\nMinister of State for Administrative Reform\n\nMinister of State for Special Zones for Structural Reform\n\nMinister of State for Regional Revitalization Kazuyoshi Kaneko R September 22, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Minister for Disaster Management\n\nMinister of State for National Emergency Legislation Kiichi Inoue R September 22, 2003 - September 27, 2004 Deputy Secretaries Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Political Affairs - House of Representatives) Hiroyuki Hosoda R September 22, 2003 - May 7, 2004 Seiken Sugiura R May 7, 2004 - October 31, 2005 Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Political Affairs - House of Councillors) Masaaki Yamazaki C September 22, 2003 - October 31, 2005 Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Bureaucrat) Masahiro Futahashi - September 22, 2003 - September 26, 2006\n\nNovember 21 - The New Conservative Party formally dissolved.
