In one recent favorability survey of current and former leaders, Kishida not only ranked below Yasuo Fukuda, the most forgettable of the many LDP heads of the 2000s, but also Yoshihiko Noda, the last head of the doomed administration of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan — whose signature policy achievement was pushing through a widely hated consumption tax hike."
