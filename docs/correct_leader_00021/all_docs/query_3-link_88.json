        "text": "Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had only one request when American actor Richard Gere visited his office on Tuesday: \"Shall we dance?\"\n\nGere, who is in Japan to promote his latest movie, a Hollywood remake of the Japanese box-office hit \"Shall We Dance,\" accepted Koizumi's invitation, but insisted that he would lead.\n\n\"I'll be the man,\" Gere said before the two twirled for a few seconds in Koizumi's office.\n\nKoizumi, who has been called \"the Japanese Richard Gere\" because of his resemblance to the American heartthrob, discussed his love of movies in a brief meeting with the actor. They also talked about their mutual affection for Kyoto, the former capital of Japan and an ancient city filled with centuries-old Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines.\n\nGere, 55, told reporters afterward that the prime minister was \"charming\" and \"spontaneous.\"\n\n\"It's a great honor for me to have the moments I've had with the prime minister. He's very generous,\" Gere said.\n\nKoizumi, 63, lavished Gere with praise for being \"interesting.\"\n\n\"He is a great person. Such a great movie star,\" Koizumi told the media at his daily news conference. \"Wonderful person.\"\n\nIt's not the first time the media-savvy Koizumi has put on a performance with a Hollywood star. He and Tom Cruise sang a duet of Elvis Presley's \"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You,\" when Cruise visited Japan to promote his movie \"The Last Samurai.\""
