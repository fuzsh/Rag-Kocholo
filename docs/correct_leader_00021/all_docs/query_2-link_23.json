        "text": "Junichiro Koizumi (Japanese: 小泉 純一郎, Koizumi Jun'ichirō) (born 8 January 1942) is a Japanese politician who was Prime Minister of Japan and President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 2001 to 2006. He retired from politics in 2009, and he remains the sixth-longest serving Prime Minister in Japanese history.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nI would like to refer to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and its means of delivery. This problem is a serious threat not only to Asia and Europe but to the entire world. When we look at recent nuclear developments in Iran and North Korea, it is obvious that the international nonproliferation regime faces a serious challenge. The international community should make a united and determined response to this issue.\n\n\"Remarks by Prime Minister Koizumi at Session 1 - The Sixth Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM6)\" (10 September 2006)\n\nWhat I had on my mind all the time was that diplomacy is to fulfill Japan's responsibility on the international stage and to bring benefits to the Japanese people. Our economy, agriculture, fisheries, security, medicine, infectious diseases and what not, international challenges are directly connected to domestic challenges. There are various differences of views within Japan on various matters, but bearing those differences in mind there are various issues on which Japan needs to cooperate on the international stage where Japan can make contributions. I really felt that overseas issues are directly connected to domestic challenges, and I have stated my views on the international stage while listening to the views of others.\n\n\"Press Conference by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi Following the G8 Summit (17 July 2006)\n\nToday, I would like to share with you a vision of a new United Nations. We need a caring United Nations that reaches out to those who struggle with extreme poverty and lends a hand to those who strive to help themselves. We need a strong United Nations that lays a path toward peacebuilding and takes an active role in the fight against terrorism. We need an effective United Nations that reflects our aspirations and the standards of today's world, not those of sixty years ago.\n\n\"Address by H.E. Mr. Junichiro Koizumi Prime Minister of Japan at the High - Level Plenary Meeting of the Sixtieth Session of The General Assembly of The United Nations\" (15 September 2005)\n\nPeace does not prevail automatically when a conflict ends. The new, strong United Nations, with the proposed Peacebuilding Commission in place, must show initiative in ensuring a smooth transition from ceasefire to nation-building, and to reconciliation, justice and reconstruction. Japan is ready to play its part in this challenging but vital undertaking.\n\n\"Address by H.E. Mr. Junichiro Koizumi Prime Minister of Japan at the High - Level Plenary Meeting of the Sixtieth Session of The General Assembly of The United Nations\" (15 September 2005)\n\nReform is always a challenge, as it requires us to confront the status quo. But that is no justification for inaction.\n\n\"Address by H.E. Mr. Junichiro Koizumi Prime Minister of Japan at the High - Level Plenary Meeting of the Sixtieth Session of The General Assembly of The United Nations\" (15 September 2005)\n\nOn the 60th anniversary of the end of the war, I reaffirm my determination that Japan must never again take the path to war, reflecting that the peace and prosperity we enjoy today are founded on the ultimate sacrifices of those who lost their lives for the war against their will.\n\n\"Statement by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi\" (15 August 2005)\n\nIn the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Sincerely facing these facts of history, I once again express my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology, and also express the feelings of mourning for all victims, both at home and abroad, in the war. I am determined not to allow the lessons of that horrible war to erode, and to contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world without ever again waging a war.\n\n\"Statement by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi\" (15 August 2005)\n\nThe international community is now faced with more complex and difficult challenges than ever imagined before: progress of the developing counties, alleviation of poverty, conservation of the global environment, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the prevention and eradication of terrorism. In order to contribute to world peace, Japan will proactively fulfill its role as a responsible member of the international community, upholding its pledge not to engage in war and based on its experience as the only nation to have suffered from the atomic bombings and the path it has followed over the 60 years after war.\n\n\"Statement by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi\" (15 August 2005)\n\nWe generated these environmental pollutions, and in order to overcome pollution, we had to take in a lot of cost. Because we pursued economic development and economic growth, we polluted our environment. We do not want developed as well as developing countries to repeat the same mistake. That is why we pursue both environmental protection and economic growth. In doing this, the key lies in science and technology. In the past, we mass produced, mass consumed and mass disposed, and we took that for granted. However, we no longer live in that sort of age. We have to reduce waste as much as possible. We now also have to reuse waste as much as possible as resources, and all things need to be recycled from now on. A zero waste, zero emission society is necessity.\n\n\"Press Conference by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi Following the G8 Summit\" (8 July 2005)\n\nJapan has developed as a pacifist nation. With the determination of the past 60 years since the end of the World War II (WWII), we shall become an economic power but never a military power. We have acted on that, and with that, we have contributed to peace-building and the prevention of conflicts around the world. That peaceful and stable development in the world leads to Japan's own peace and development. In other words, assisting the recipient country leads to Japan's stability and prosperity. With Japanese assistance, the recipient country will be able to grow through a stable political situation and Japan will benefit from that. It is with that stance that we shall continue to provide assistance.\n\n\"Press Conference by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on the occasion of the Asian-African Summit 2005 and the Commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of the Asian-African Conference 1955\" (23 April 2005)\n\nIndeed in China, as seen from those anti-Japan demonstrations, there is strong anti-Japanese sentiment. Also, from seeing such demonstrations, some Japanese regard China with anti-China sentiment or shall I say a sort of feeling of repellence against China. But overall, I believe without expressing in words both in Japan and China, I believe the majority of people understand that promoting friendly ties between our two countries is of the greatest benefit to both countries, especially those in the responsible positions in the Government. I believe we should have this common understanding that we should strictly refrain from agitating any such hostile sentiment. I believe that because of the recent developments, there is this stronger understanding on this among those in responsible positions in respective countries. Without being affected by such anti-Chinese or Japanese sentiments, we were able to share the recognition in the talks that the friendly ties between the two countries are of importance. I believe both of us should take to heart very firmly this awareness and strive to further promote the friendly ties between our two countries.\n\n\"Press Conference by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on the occasion of the Asian-African Summit 2005 and the Commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of the Asian-African Conference 1955\" (23 April 2005)\n\nWhen I assumed the office of the Prime Minister of Japan last year, many people thought that it would be difficult to implement the various reforms that I proposed. In fact, however, we have advanced reform in many sectors. The time has come to bid farewell to the systems and practices with which we have become familiar and to flexibly accept the needs and requirements of this new age we live in.\n\n\"Policy Speech by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to the 154th Session of the Diet\" (24 February 2002)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:"
