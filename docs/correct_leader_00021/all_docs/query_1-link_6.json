        "text": "Frequent National Elections\n\nIn Japan, national elections frequently take place. If we take into account Parliamentary (Diet) elections, there were 7 elections between 2005 and 2015, which means there was an election once every 1.5 years. Lower House elections are held so frequently (once every 2.5 years over the past 10 years) that it is not uncommon for Members of the Lower House to leave office without completing a full four year term. In addition, every three years, an election is held for half of the Upper House. This election has significant impact as it serves as a mid-term evaluation of the administration. Add to this local elections held nation-wide every four years and elections to determine the heads of the majority and minority political parties, the number of elections further increases.\n\nAs a result, the government, the ruling party, and each political party must pay critical attention to elections, which leads to a certain level of instability in politics and, what some consider, an easy avenue for the influential voices of older persons to affect policy.\n\nCabinet-led Policy Making\n\nJapanese government and policy making was once known as “bureaucrat-led.” Each ministry along with LDP-backed special-interest legislators* dominated policy discussions and policy making processes. This all changed with the 2001 election of Junichiro Koizumi as Prime Minister. Prime Minister Koizumi firmly opposed such special interest legislators and unfair ministry intrusion leading to a transformation of this long standing trend. By occasionally disregarding the ideas of the LDP and Ministry officials, he was able to take the lead in the appointment of Cabinet Ministers and on critical policy decisions. The bureaucratic influence began to fade and a new era, which continues today, of Cabinet-led policy making was born. While critical policy is decided at the Cabinet level, as opposed to at the MHLW, the influence of special-interest legislators is still strong.\n\n*This term refers to Diet members who have strong ties to a specific ministry or with specialized knowledge in one policy area. For example, Diet members who are especially familiar with the work of the MHLW would be known as MHLW legislators. Many times, these legislators, whose influence remains strong, lead the health and welfare committee within the LDP or have experience as the Health Minister or Vice-Health Minister."
