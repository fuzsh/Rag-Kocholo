        "text": "New reform-minded prime minister under pressure to produce\n\nRESOURCE\n\nTOKYO, Japan -- With his long silvery locks, affinity for rock music and charisma, Junichiro Koizumi has been hailed as the \"Mick Jagger of Japanese politics.\"\n\nSupport from rank-and-file Japanese propelled Koizumi onto center stage in Tokyo, where he will become the nation's 11th prime minister in 13 years on Thursday.\n\nKoizumi's win did not come easily. He came from behind to defeat a pack of politicians in the leading Liberal Democratic Party known for its conservatism and backroom wheeling and dealing -- a political style Koizumi has vowed to destroy.\n\n\"No one expected that I would be chosen as president of this party, so this is kind of a revolution in the LDP,\" he said on Tuesday, shortly after the party's local chapters and the Japanese parliament followed up a dominating showing in public voting last weekend.\n\nBut as hard-fought as his victory was, experts predict his tenure in office will be even more difficult. Many business leaders, journalists and political pundits have applauded Koizumi's vitality and promise of reform. But they say he may be doomed by a lack of detail and public impatience with Japan's political and economic landscape.\n\n\"He is at heart a radical reformer,\" said Garry Evans, Japan equity strategist with HSBC. \"The question is whether he sticks to his principles and whether he's able to push through what he wants to push through.\"\n\nJapan hopes new leader can deliver\n\nKoizumi, the nation's former health and welfare minister, garnered \"a whopping 87 percent\" in local primaries this weekend, according to the Japan Times. Japanese voters do not actually vote for prime minister, but they do vote for someone to head the LDP -- the leading member of Japan's ruling three-party coalition government.\n\nThe primaries yield representatives, similar to \"electors\" in the U.S. system, who elect an LDP president along with party members in parliament. Koizumi defeated former premier Ryutaro Hashimoto -- the favorite of the LDP old guard -- 293-155 in Tuesday's party election.\n\nIn a mere formality on Thursday, the Japanese parliament will name Koizumi the nation's 86th prime minister, the government's most powerful position.\n\nKoizumi, who succeeds the embattled and unpopular Yoshiro Mori, will be in office at least until September, when new elections will be held. And he faces added pressure to produce results before July's parliamentary election, when a poor showing could loosen the LDP's grip on power.\n\nWhile Koizumi's \"Change the LDP, Change Japan\" platform signaled his desire for reform, the incoming prime minister has offered few details as to what he plans to do. Experts predict his \"honeymoon\" period may not last long if the economy remains flat, as it has for nearly a decade.\n\n\"His economic policy has been vague, contradictory and frequently changing, but the market's taking the view that anything is better than what we've had so far,\" said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Barings. \"But so far it's impossible to say what all this means because we don't know exactly what he's going to do.\"\n\n'I am different'\n\nFor now, Koizumi, 59, appears to have captured the hearts of many people with his straight talk and common touch. A divorced father, he represents a less tradition-bound Japan, something his unwavering push for reform in his political career has confirmed. He's been outspoken on many fronts, including visits to a Tokyo shrine honoring Japan's war dead opposed by China and South Korea.\n\n\"My political life will end if I fail to form a Cabinet that reflects the voice of the people,\" the Japan Times reported Koizumi telling a crowd last weekend. \"The real fight will not end until the voice of the people destroys forces that are resisting reforms.\"\n\nYet popular support may not translate to political support, especially given the entrenched political establishment and its traditionally secretive deal-making style. On Tuesday, Koizumi let down his guard in expressing his intention to work with all parties.\n\n\"Politics is about compromise, people say,\" he said. \"Sometimes I'll have to compromise. Sometimes I'll have to push my views.\"\n\nExperts say real reform will lead to bankruptcies and higher unemployment. Pushing reforms too quickly could hurtle Japan into recession.\n\nBut this week, Koizumi has repeated his calls for reform -- the reason, he says, the Japanese people supported him in the first place.\n\n\"I am different from other candidates and that has been supported by all the members, many of the members of the LDP,\" he said. \"That is why I've been chosen as the party president. We have to change the old-fashioned structure.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nJapan's PM frontrunner declares 'revolution'\n\nApril 24, 2001\n\nKoizumi bounds to front in Japan PM race\n\nApril 23, 2001\n\nReformer takes early lead in Japan party poll\n\nApril 21, 2001\n\nClose contest expected for Japan PM\n\nApril 19, 2001\n\nFavorite tops poll in Japan PM race\n\nApril 15, 2001\n\nMori steps down, but who will step up?\n\nApril 6, 2001\n\nUnpopular Japanese prime minister agrees to elections, soldiers on\n\nMarch 13, 2001\n\nRELATED SITES:"
