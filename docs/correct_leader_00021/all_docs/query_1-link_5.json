        "text": "==========================================================\n\nThe Koizumi Cabinet E-mail Magazine Special Edition\n\n==========================================================\n\n[Lion Heart -- Message from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi]\n\n(* The title of this column \"Lion Heart\" is a reference to the Prime Minister's lion-like hairstyle and his unbending determination to advance structural reform.)\n\nProfile\n\nMaking Japan into a nice place to live and a great place to visit!\n\n- February 19, 2004 -\n\n(Provisional Translation)\n\nJunichiro Koizumi here.\n\nYesterday, I invited the ambassadors of the United States and European and Asian countries to the Prime Minister's Official Residence and asked them what we can do to make more foreigners want to come and visit Japan.\n\nCompared to the more than 16 million Japanese who venture abroad each year, only about five million foreigners visit our country.\n\nI want more foreigners to visit Japan each year. I think that we must turn our country into a place that people want to visit. That is why last January I set the goal of \"doubling the number of foreigners visiting Japan by 2010.\" Since then, we have been working to \"make Japan into a nice place to live and a great place to visit.\"\n\nMany of you will recall the \"Charisma Ambassadors of Tourism\" project that pursues the goal of \"one region, one tourism,\" which was introduced previously in this e-mail magazine. For my part, I have appeared in television commercials broadcast overseas to tell the world about how wonderful Japan is as a tourism destination.\n\nMany of the ambassadors encouraged me to continue our efforts. Indeed they said that, \"everywhere in Japan, there is abundance in exciting tourism resources, ranging from its culture, nature and its people.\"\n\nStill, it was pointed out that there remains great room for improvement. Specifically, some criticized that \"although the Japanese railway system is astonishing with its speed and accuracy, it is hard for foreigners to utilize the system\" and \"there are not enough pamphlets and information available in foreign languages.\"\n\nFurther areas that need to be improved include expanding cellular phone service so that travelers can use the cellular phones that they bring with them while they are in Japan, and ensuring that ATM cards issued by foreign banks can be used to withdraw cash at ATM banks in Japan.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that foreigners come to Japan expecting everything to be just as it is in their home countries. I have heard that there are many foreign tourists that want to visit hot springs at a Japanese inn and experience sleeping in a futon.\n\nRevival of regions and promotion of tourism are related to one another and it is important to pursue them together. Next year, the \"Exposition of Global Harmony\" will be held in Aichi Prefecture. This is but one significant event that can be used to propel our policy of furthering the development of our nation by promoting tourism.\n\nLast week, a consultation was held between the Governments of Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) in Pyongyang. Although there was no significant progress on abduction issues and others, there is no change in the position of Japan to comprehensively solve the issues of abduction, nuclear weapons and missiles to realize the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea.\n\nWe share the basic view of placing importance on the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration. As such, I will strive to realize the normalization of our relations at the earliest date possible.\n\nAt the Six-Party Talks which are soon to be convened, I intend to make strenuous efforts to solve the issues that remain.\n\n==========================================================\n\nThe Role of the United Nations and Japan\n\n- February 26, 2004 -\n\n(Provisional Translation)\n\nJunichiro Koizumi here.\n\nOn February 23, I had talks with Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary- General of the United Nations (UN), at the Prime Minister's Official Residence.\n\nMr. Annan was born in Ghana, Africa and ever since his youth has been deeply involved in UN efforts to address refugee issues and peace-keeping activities. He assumed the position of Secretary- General seven years ago and was awarded the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize as a representative of the UN.\n\nIn addition to threats of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the world faces diverse challenges such as poverty and infectious diseases. The role of the UN is increasingly expanding for uniting the powers of the international community to embrace these challenges.\n\nWith regard to the reconstruction of Iraq, the Security Council of the UN has, under unanimous decision, requested the countries around the world to actively cooperate and provide assistance. I believe that I was able to have a thorough and meaningful talk with Secretary-General Annan at a time when the Iraq situation is reaching a critical stage.\n\nSecretary-General Annan made the following remarks in his historic address to the Diet:\n\n\"In short, there will be formidable challenges ahead - but they will not be insurmountable if Iraq is supported by a united international community. Japan is among those countries that have taken the lead in embracing this challenge. You have responded to the appeals of the UN Security Council, and shown commendable solidarity with Iraq's plight. ... You have pledged to contribute generously to reconstruction. And after a difficult debate, you have dispatched the Self-Defense Forces to Samawah to help with reconstruction and humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nBeyond examining what can be done to facilitate the reconstruction of Iraq, Secretary-General Annan and I discussed a wide range of issues including North Korea, international cooperation for world peace such as the fight against terrorism and reform of the UN.\n\nInternational coordination is important. Instead of asking what it is that the UN can do for us, we should ask what it is that Japan can do at the UN. I believe that Japan must clearly define the role that it is to play in the international community and together with the UN must fulfill its responsibility in the world.\n\nIn closing his speech, Secretary-General Annan stated, \"The Japanese imprint on the United Nations has been strong and distinctive for nearly 50 years, ever since the day, in 1956, when Japan's flag was raised and your country's foreign minister expressed your deeply held belief that 'no nation is responsible to itself alone.' With that spirit intact, I am certain that we shall achieve great things together in the years ahead.\"\n\nI want the younger generation in Japan to strongly respond to this kind of call.\n\nCurrently, six-party talks are taking place in Beijing.\n\nJapan considers the abduction issue to be as pressing as the nuclear issue. I am strenuously calling upon North Korea to act with sincerity in line with the Japan-Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Pyongyang Declaration.\n\n==========================================================\n\n[What's up around the Prime Minister]\n\n- Prime Minister Meets with Secretary-General of the United Nations\n\n(Feb. 23, 2004)\n\nhttps://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumiphoto/2004/02/23un_e.html\n\nPrime Minister Koizumi held talks with Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\n- Meeting with Ambassadors on Tourism Policy (Feb. 18, 2004)\n\nhttps://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumiphoto/2004/02/18kankou_e.html\n\nPrime Minister Koizumi invited ambassadors and other officials of 12 countries and regions and held a meeting on tourism policy.\n\n- The Tenth Meeting of the Office for Promotion of Justice System Reform (Feb. 13, 2004)\n\nhttps://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumiphoto/2004/02/13sihou_e.html\n\nThere was a final discussion on bills related to justice system reform scheduled to be submitted to the current session of the Diet.\n\n==========================================================\n\n[The Koizumi Cabinet E-mail Magazine]\n\n- Click here to make comments on national administration of Japan.\n\nhttps://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/forms/comment.html\n\n- Subscription and cancellation of this e-mail magazine\n\nhttps://japan.kantei.go.jp/m-magazine/"
