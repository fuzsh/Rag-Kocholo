Several ministers from the previous Mori Administration remained in office to ensure the continuity and stability of government.[2] Unusually for an LDP leader, Koizumi chose his cabinet himself and personally asked ministers to join the government, unlike previous practice where party factional leaders often chose government posts.[3]\n\nKoizumi took office at a time of prolonged economic difficulties for Japan after the first \"Lost Decade\", including a banking sector affected by \"bad loans\". His policies promised bold structural reforms to economic, administrative and social policy using the slogans \"reform with no sacred areas\" and \"without structural reforms there can be no economic recovery\", explaining that he expected the country to endure short-term hardship, including higher unemployment, to make longer-term economic gains.[4][5][6][7] Despite these promises of initial economic difficulties, the Koizumi cabinet enjoyed record popularity during its first year (reaching 90 percent in some polls), and the LDP gained several seats in the June 2001 upper house elections.[8][9]\n\nKoizumi's popularity declined significantly in early 2002 after he sacked Tanaka for disloyalty and for feuding with bureaucrats, and a series of scandals relating to the agriculture and foreign ministries came to light.[10][11] In response, Koizumi ordered a quickening of the pace in terms of structural reform plans and made a highly publicised visit to North Korea in the autumn to discuss abducted Japanese citizens, which led to a recovery in his poll ratings.[12][13][14][15] The first cabinet reshuffle then took place in September 2002 and did not bring about any major personnel changes, but did remove Financial Services Minister Hakuo Yanagisawa, who Koizumi felt was too timid on economic reform.[16]\n\nThe second cabinet reshuffle took place in September 2003, following Koizumi's re-election as LDP leader by a large margin, and involved substantial changes including the promotion of the reformist Sadakazu Tanigaki to Finance Minister. Despite this, the key figures of Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda and Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizō Takenaka were kept in post.[17][18] Koizumi then dissolved the Diet and called general elections in November 2003, which returned his coalition to office and led to the formation of the Second Koizumi Cabinet.[19][20] The first Koizumi cabinet was the last to include the New Conservative Party as a coalition partner, which had declined in strength since its founding in April 2000 and finally merged with the LDP at Koizumi's suggestion after the 2003 election.[21]\n\n26 April 2001 House of Representatives\n\nAbsolute majority (241/480) required Choice First Vote Votes YJunichiro Koizumi\n\n287 / 480\n\nYukio Hatoyama\n\n127 / 480\n\nOzawa Ichiro\n\n22 / 480\n\nShii Kazuo\n\n20 / 480\n\nTakako Doi\n\n19 / 480\n\nAbstentions (Including blank ballots)\n\n5 / 480\n\nSource Diet Minutes - 151st Session\n\nLiberal Democratic\n\nNew Komeito\n\nNew Conservative\n\nIndependent\n\nR = Member of the House of Representatives\n\nC = Member of the House of Councillors\n\nFirst Koizumi Cabinet from April 26, 2001 to September 30, 2002 Portfolio Minister Term of office Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi R April 26, 2001 - September 26, 2006 Minister for Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications Toranosuke Katayama C January 6, 2001 - September 22, 2003 Minister of Justice Mayumi Moriyama R April 26, 2001 - September 22, 2003 Minister of Foreign Affairs Makiko Tanaka R April 26, 2001 - January 30, 2002 Junichiro Koizumi R January 30, 2002 - February 1, 2002 Yoriko Kawaguchi - February 1, 2002 - September 27, 2004 Minister of Finance Masajuro Shiokawa R April 26, 2001 - September 22, 2003 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Atsuko Toyama - April 26, 2001 - September 22, 2003 Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare Chikara Sakaguchi R January 6, 2001 - September 27, 2004 Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tsutomu Takebe R April 26, 2001 - September 30, 2002 Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Takeo Hiranuma R January 6, 2001 - September 22, 2003 Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Chikage Ogi C January 6, 2001 - September 22, 2003 Minister of the Environment Yoriko Kawaguchi - January 6, 2001 - February 8, 2002 Hiroshi Ōki R February 8, 2002 - September 30, 2002 Chief Cabinet Secretary\n\nMinister for Gender Equality Yasuo Fukuda R October 27, 2000 - May 7, 2004 Director of the National Public Safety Commission\n\nMinister for Disaster Management Jin Murai R April 26, 2001 - September 30, 2002 Director of the Japan Defense Agency Gen Nakatani R April 26, 2001 - September 30, 2002 Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs\n\nMinister of State (Science and Technology Policy) Kōji Omi R April 26, 2001 - September 30, 2002 Minister of State for Financial Services Hakuo Yanagisawa R January 6, 2001 - September 30, 2002 Minister of State for Economic and Fiscal Policy Heizō Takenaka - April 26, 2001 - October 31, 2005 Minister of State for Regulatory Reform Nobuteru Ishihara R April 26, 2001 - September 22, 2003 Deputy Secretaries Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Political Affairs - House of Representatives) Shinzo Abe R July 4, 2000 - September 22, 2003 Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Political Affairs - House of Councillors) Kosei Ueno C July 4, 2000 - September 22, 2003 Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Bureaucrat) Teijiro Furukawa - February 24, 1995 - September 22, 2003\n\nJanuary 30, 2002 - Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka was dismissed following a series of leaks and public feuds with Foreign Ministry bureaucrats.
