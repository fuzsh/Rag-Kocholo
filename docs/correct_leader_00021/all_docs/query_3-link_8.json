        "text": "(born 1942). Although a member of the traditional Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP), Koizumi Junichiro was elected prime minister of Japan in 2001 by being unconventional. With the economy in crisis and the public disgusted by political corruption, the candidate offered hope that vast changes in structure and operation could put the country on the right track. He served as prime minister until 2006, when term limits prevented him from being reelected.\n\nKoizumi was born on January 8, 1942, in Yokosuka, Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. Both his grandfather and his father served in the House of Representatives, which is the lower house of Japan’s Diet, or parliament. Koizumi graduated from Keio University in Tokyo in 1967 with a degree in economics. He then did postgraduate work in England at the London School of Economics. Upon the death of his father, Koizumi returned to Japan to run for his father’s seat in the Diet but lost.\n\nIn 1970 Koizumi began working as a junior secretary to Fukuda Takeo, who later became prime minister. Two years later Koizumi won his first of many elections to the House of Representatives. He became state secretary for finance in 1979. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he held a variety of government positions, including minister of health and welfare and minister of posts and telecommunications.\n\nKoizumi ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of the LDP in 1995 and 1998. In 2001, however, he again ran for the post and finally won, and he was soon confirmed as prime minister. He proceeded to shake things up by naming a record five women to the 17-member cabinet. Popular figure Tanaka Makiko became the first woman to hold the position of foreign minister. Koizumi’s attempts to reform the ailing economy—including reducing government spending—met opposition in the Diet. Koizumi also wished to privatize Japan’s postal savings system, a postal operation that also offers savings accounts like a bank. He viewed this system as inefficient and as a longtime source of political corruption.\n\nIn 2002 Koizumi’s popular image as a reformer suffered when he dismissed Tanaka, who had criticized his policies. Nevertheless, his personal popularity remained high. In the national election the next year, Koizumi was confirmed for another term as prime minister. In 2005 the upper house defeated his postal-privatization plan, prompting Koizumi to call for new elections in the lower house. He also purged the LDP of those opposed to his plan. Koizumi left office after his term was completed in September 2006 and was succeeded by Abe Shinzo."
