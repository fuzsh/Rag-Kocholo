Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had only one request when American actor Richard Gere visited his office on Tuesday: "Shall we dance?"

Gere, who is in Japan to promote his latest movie, a Hollywood remake of the Japanese box-office hit "Shall We Dance," accepted Koizumi's invitation, but insisted that he would lead.

"I'll be the man," Gere said before the two twirled for a few seconds in Koizumi's office.

Koizumi, who has been called "the Japanese Richard Gere" because of his resemblance to the American heartthrob, discussed his love of movies in a brief meeting with the actor. They also talked about their mutual affection for Kyoto, the former capital of Japan and an ancient city filled with centuries-old Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines.

Gere, 55, told reporters afterward that the prime minister was "charming" and "spontaneous."

"It's a great honor for me to have the moments I've had with the prime minister. He's very generous," Gere said.

Koizumi, 63, lavished Gere with praise for being "interesting."

"He is a great person. Such a great movie star," Koizumi told the media at his daily news conference. "Wonderful person."

It's not the first time the media-savvy Koizumi has put on a performance with a Hollywood star. He and Tom Cruise sang a duet of Elvis Presley's "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You," when Cruise visited Japan to promote his movie "The Last Samurai."
