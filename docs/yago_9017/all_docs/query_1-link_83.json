        "text": "15, 93 mins\n\nTHERE is an accepted cinematic vernacular into which film-makers tend to dip when trying to convey the effects of drug use in a movie. Extreme close-ups of rapidly dilating pupils are popular, as is tipsily skewed camera work and kaleidoscope filters. One technique, I can safely say, that has not been used before is a faintly menacing 6ft badger wearing a pink dress and a grubby apron.\n\nThe cocaine badger is a recurring character in It’s All Gone Pete Tong, sticking its powder-crusted snout into DJ Frankie Wilde’s business and his drug stash and ensuring that, in times of stress, Frankie always knows where to turn first. Yes, the monkey on our hero’s back is a badger in drag.\n\nTalking animal hallucinations"
