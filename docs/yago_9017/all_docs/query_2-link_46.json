        "text": "Elan Mastai\n\n“All Our Wrong Todays” is my first novel, but I’ve been working as a screenwriter for nearly two decades. In 2021, I was nominated for an Emmy Award for my work on the hit TV series “This Is Us”—I spent three seasons writing the show and co-executive produced the sixth and final season. My most recent movie is called “What If” (known as “The F Word” in some countries) a comedy starring Daniel Radcliffe, Zoe Kazan, Adam Driver, Mackenzie Davis, Megan Park, and Rafe Spall, directed by Michael Dowse. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and I was fortunate to win the Canadian Academy Award and the Writers Guild of Canada Award for my screenplay. I’m currently writing an animated movie for Disney Animation."
