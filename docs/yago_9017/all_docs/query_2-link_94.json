        "text": "UPDATE: It is now being reported that the film will be keeping its original title in Canada, where it premiered last year, as the Canadian distributor is not affected by the MPAA restrictions in the US.\n\nWe posted months ago about the first look at Daniel Radcliffe’s romantic comedy The F Word, but a release date for the film has just been announced!\n\nThe film, which has also been renamed What If, will hit US theaters in New York and Los Angeles on August 1, 2014, and will go into wider release on August 8 and 15.\n\nFrom Variety:\n\nDirected by Michael Dowse (“Goon”), “The F Word” stars Daniel Radcliffe as a medical school dropout and romantic who meets an animator, played by Zoe Kazan. The relationship clicks, despite the fact that she is already living with her boyfriend (Rafe Spall).”\n\nAdam Driver, Mackenzie Davis, Megan Park and Oona Chaplin also star. Producers are David Gross, Jesse Shapira, Jeff Arkuss, Macdara Kelleher and Andre Rouleau.”\n\nWhat If received positive reviews when shown at the Toronto Film Festival last year. Are you excited to see it? What’s your favorite of Dan’s post-Potter projects?"
