        "text": "In the 2004 cult classic It’s All Gone Pete Tong, Ibiza DJ Frankie Wilde must reassess his life after losing his hearing. Last year, the film’s namesake Pete Tong described the movie as “a fly on the wall look of what it’s like to be a superstar DJ.”\n\nNow, Off-Broadway audiences are going to get this same fly on the wall view via a new stage production based off the film. Called Make Some Noise: The Legend of Frankie Wilde, the show will be staged as a 360-degree experience incorporating tech and 3D sound design to put audiences on Wilde’s sensory and sonic journey. Producers promise that audiences will experience what music looks and feels like.\n\nOf course, there will also be bangers. Co-produced by scene icon Paul Oakenfold, Make Some Noise: The Legend of Frankie Wilde will feature dance music from throughout the genre’s history.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe show will have an industry showcase on April 6 at New York’s Daryl Roth Theatre and will officially launch during Off-Broadway’s next production season.\n\nGen Cleary, who’s worked with dance stars including Kaskade, Steve Aoki, Tiesto, Sharam, Calvin Harris, David Guetta, Martin Garrix and LMFAO, will serve as creative producer. The script is by Todd Almond, currently on Broadway with Girl from the North Country, which adopts the music of Bob Dylan."
