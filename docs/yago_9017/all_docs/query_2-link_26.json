        "text": "MONTREAL — Quebec directors were red hot at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). So hot that when I tried to book an interview with Michael Dowse through official channels, I kept getting the runaround: maybe they could squeeze me in for five or 10 minutes here or there, I was told, or maybe not.\n\nBut once I got beyond the industry smokescreens, Dowse exhibited classic laid-back, Montreal spirit. Reached mid-festival, via Facebook, the director agreed to meet me for a Sunday afternoon pint of Guinness, following a daytime screening, press conference and interviews for his new film The F Word.\n\nIt’s a romantic comedy starring a certain Daniel Radcliffe — hence all the fuss. Screaming Harry Potter fans had swarmed the première the night before, making it a feat just to get inside the theatre.\n\nFor Radcliffe, the film is part of a multi-pronged initiative to establish a career beyond the decade-spanning sorcerer series. For Dowse, whose CV boasts a list of left-field comedies including FUBAR (2002), It’s All Gone Pete Tong (2004) and Goon (2011), it’s a cautious step into the mainstream.\n\n“It’s a very conscious change of pace for me,” he said. “I wanted to flex a different muscle, show my range as a director. … It wasn’t about wanting to make something that breaks out in a bigger way. I just really liked the script. (Romantic comedy) is a really maligned genre that makes for a lot of soft, pastel-y movies or twee, independent, earnest films.\n\n“What I love about the script is that it uses comedy to make the romance, which is like reality — when you flirt and use comedy to win over the other person. Comedy becomes another element of this film, a symbol of their affection, as it goes on. I wanted to do something completely different, but do the genre well.”\n\nThe movie’s cheeky title is a nod to Dowse’s irreverent approach to humour, but even that was apparently too much for American distributor CBS Films, which changed the title to What If for release in the U.S. and U.K.\n\nThe movie is coming out as Et si jamais in French in Quebec, and in Mexico as Solo amigos, which is Dowse’s personal favourite.\n\nThe F word in question has not four letters, but seven: “friends.” Radcliffe plays Wallace, a med school dropout who hits it off with cheeky graphic designer Chantry (Zoe Kazan) at a party. When it turns out Chantry has a boyfriend, Wallace accepts her offer of friendship, but sparks continue to fly.\n\nBased on T.J. Dawe and Michael Rinaldi’s play Cigars and Toothpaste, the script by Elan Mastai features no shortage of witty repartee. Set in Toronto (with prominent shots of the CN Tower in the background), featuring several songs by Montreal’s Patrick Watson and a score by A.C. Newman (of the New Pornographers), it’s a defiantly Canadian take on Hollywood formula.\n\n“It looks like a (Hollywood) studio film, but it’s made like an independent film,” Dowse said. “It’s a testament to (federal funding agency) Telefilm and the opportunities we have as directors in this country. There’s a sweet spot of around $10-million budgets, where you can have the time and money to make a good film with strong production values and attract a good cast.”\n\nRadcliffe’s participation was, of course, central to the success of the project, from financing to media attention and box office potential.\n\n“I’m very lucky to have a guy of that calibre in my film,” Dowse said. “You get a taste and you don’t want to make a movie without big stars, because they sell your film for you — and you want people to see your film.”\n\nBeyond marquee appeal, Radcliffe brings real acting chops and genuine charm to the role. At once nerdy and charismatic, he’s a perfect leading man for an ironic rom-com that delivers its emerging love story with a nudge and a wink.\n\n“You just root for him,” Dowse said. “He has great relatability. You understand him, and feel like you could be friends with him. You like him. He’s funny and has an easy charm that’s not forced. That’s him; he gets to play a version of himself, which is nice to see because he’s a really great guy.”\n\nDowse also couldn’t say enough about Kazan (who wrote and starred in the 2012 romantic comedy Ruby Sparks, alongside boyfriend Paul Dano).\n\n“There’s a light in her,” he said. “She’s a very generous actor to work with. She’s also probably the most adept actor I’ve seen with improvisation in terms of keeping it on story and tying a tangent back. She’s funny and gorgeous; there’s such a unique beauty to her. Her eyes are so emotive.”\n\nThe admiration is mutual. Sitting down with The Gazette at TIFF, Kazan expressed a great fondness for Dowse.\n\n“He’s like a big football coach,” she said. “He reminded me of working with Richard Linklater (on the 2008 drama Me and Orson Welles). He was the Little League coach and we were his favourite team! There was a real sense of being part of the group, and we’re all gonna make this together!\n\n“It’s funny, because he’s like 1,000 times my size — standing next to him is like standing next to a mountain — but he would cry in scenes that were emotional; and making him laugh on set was my goal, always.”\n\nThe Gazette caught up with Dowse again Wednesday afternoon, just two days before promo for the film kicked into high gear. After launching What If in the U.S. with a mere 20 prints last weekend, CBS is turbo-boosting that up to 800 this weekend.\n\n“We can make it or break it in the States on Friday (Aug. 15),” Dowse said. “They’re happy with the response and how it’s doing. The CinemaScore (market research) is good, which means it’s got really good word of mouth. They were going to do a more elongated platform, but they got aggressive about 10 days ago and said, ‘No, let’s put all the money we had for three weeks into one week and go hard on Friday,’ which is what you want.”\n\nDowse is keeping his expectations in check. He’s been here before. His 2007-shot Hollywood studio film Take Me Home Tonight was shelved by Universal Pictures, finally being released wide in 2011 to disappointing results.\n\n“God, who knows what’s going to happen,” he said. “It’s such a weird business. You spend all this time (making a movie) and Friday by 9 you’re like ‘yea’ or ‘nay.’ But the fact that we’re at the plate and playing in this league is amazing.”\n\nWhatever the result, Dowse won’t be resting on his laurels. He’s got several projects on the go. First up is The Volcano, a remake of the madcap 2013 French comedy Eyjafjallajökull, which starred Dany Boon. It’s another collaboration with producer André Rouleau (who worked on Goon and The F Word), telling the story of a divorced couple who get stranded because of the Icelandic volcano that erupted in 2010 and must make their way to Corfu, Greece, for their daughter’s wedding.\n\n“It’s like Planes, Trains and Automobiles meets War of the Roses,” Dowse said.\n\nHe’s also finishing writing a serialized, half-hour web series for Amazon Studios.\n\n“I can’t tell you what it’s about,” he said. “(The comedy) is pretty dirty. Amazon’s amazing. They totally want edgy stuff, to push you to make something different and break barriers.”\n\nAnd things are looking good for Dowse’s dream of making an American action comedy, which has been written, cast and should begin shooting sometime in the new year.\n\n“It’s (another) maligned genre,” he said. “Those are the movies I grew up watching — 48 Hours and Midnight Run. They’re fantastic movies; you just have to have both good action and good comedy.”\n\nLuckily, Dowse already has half that formula down pat.\n\nThe F Word opens in Montreal on Friday, Aug. 22.\n\ntdunlevy@montrealgazette.comTwitter: TChaDunlevy"
