        "text": "It’s All Gone Pete Tong (2004)\n\nDirector: Michael Dowse\n\nActors: Paul Kaye, Kate Magowan, Beatriz Batarda\n\nSynopsis: Laddish Ibiza “Super DJ”, Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye), finds his life of unadulterated hedonism on the ‘White Isle’ rudely interrupted when he begins to suffer from increasing deafness. With that humility though, Wilde learns to hone what little sonic skills he has, and finds love with a Spanish deaf instructor, Penelope (Beatriz Batarda).\n\nReview: Although the culture of dance music and Ibiza in general have been woefully underserved by the cinematic medium so far (hence one of the reasons why I conceived of my own Eivissa project), I’m still curious enough about any picture, even loosely associated with the isle, to pay it a visit."
