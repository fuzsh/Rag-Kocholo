        "text": "Title: What If\n\nAge: 15\n\nReleased: 2nd May 2014\n\nDirector: Michael Dowse\n\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\n\nRating: **** (4/5 stars)\n\nAbout: A medical-school dropout called Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) tries to hide his attraction to his new friend called Chantry (Zoe Kazan), a bubbly artist who already has a boyfriend.\n\nReview: This is such a cute film.\n\nI mean it’s the typical love story – nothing new there. You can clearly tell from the very start that the two of them should be together but of course, for the next hour and a bit, things get in the way.\n\nBut I feel that this is such a successful film because right from the start you are rooting for the two of them to end up together.\n\nAnd it’s not just about the two of them, there are other relationships in the film that are just brilliant. For starters, Wallace and his newphew Felix. Wallace is portrayed as Felix’s fatherly figure and he’s great at it. There’s a really funny scene where he’s watching over him because Felix’s mum has gone out and you can just really see how close they are in that short scene.\n\nSome of the dialogue is very witty indeed. The would-be lovers turn out to share a fascination with Elvis Presley’s dietary habits and to have the same facility for puns and morbid jokes. There’s clearly a great attraction between the two of them because they have such a similar sense of humour. Why could neither of them notice this?\n\nI mean obviously there would be no story if the two of them were like well lets get together but there wasn’t really any moment until about half way through the film before either of them started to really do something about their feelings for each other.\n\nAnd then there’s the whole part where Chantry goes to Dublin because she thinks she wants to be with her boyfriend Ben (after having an arguement with Wallace) and then Wallace decides to follow her. BUT the two never meet instead Wallace is just one step behind her and he is so determined to be with her (not even really caring about Ben punching him in the face). It’s just so sweet and you really have to watch this film because its such a roller coaster ride of emotions.\n\nIt really is worth a watch for anyone in the mood for a lovey-dovey/funny film."
