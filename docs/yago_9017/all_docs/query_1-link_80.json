This frantic mocku-comedy set in the superstar DJ world is breathtakingly charmless and humourless, and the whole subject is surely years past its sell-by date.\n\nPaul Kaye gives a frazzled, one-note performance as fictional Ibiza legend Frankie Wilde, who's drowning in women and booze and cocaine, but in denial about his terrible problem: he is going deaf.\n\nGuest appearances by real-life DJs should tip you off that any satire involved is of an essentially celebratory and sycophantic sort; the comedy is leaden, the drama is flat and the attitude to deaf people is Neanderthal.\n\nProducer Allan Niblo gave us the club movie Human Traffic, which was a likeable film with a big heart. This just leaves a nasty taste in the mouth."
