        "text": "While I'm familiar enough with dance/electronic/techno music to know the difference between The Chemical Brothers, Moby, Propellerheads, DJ Rap, Paul Oakenfold, BT and others artists; and I occasionally read magazines such as Remix, Mixmag and Electronic Musician; I was unaware of the legend of Frankie Wilde, the 'Deaf DJ.'\n\nA celebrated mixmaster who received copious encomiums from techno legends like Carl Cox, Lol Hammond, Paul Van Dyk and Sarah Main, Wilde ruled the dance floors on the Spanish vacation isle of Ibiza with his superb ability to control the crowd over the span of his sets. With records topping the charts, money flowing in and Tony Montana-sized piles of cocaine filling cottage cheese containers; life was a non-stop party for Wilde.\n\nThen he started going deaf.\n\nWhile that's a sad state for anyone, it's especially bad for musicians - for obvious reasons. His turntable-throwing public meltdown was only a sample of the private hell he lived in; he was so blown away, he hallucinated that he was tormented by a man-sized badger that looked like roadkill wearing angel wings ordering him to do cocaine. Things were pretty bleak, but he eventually overcame his demons, met a woman who could relate to his condition and devised an ingenious way to make a comeback as a DJ and record producer.\n\nFor such a sweeping riches-to-rags-and-back-again story, well-documented on video and in numerous magazine clippings, it sounds like the stuff of legend and it was weird that he flew under my radar, but there was one substantial mitigating factor for my ignorance of his unique circumstancesâ€¦\n\nFrankie Wilde doesn't exist.\n\nIt's All Gone Pete Tong is a deadpan mockumentary that so skillfully weaves its tale that I didn't even know that there was no such bloke until I started into this disc's extras. The use of real DJs and club owners providing straight-faced testimonials as to Wilde's prowess, along with actors portraying fictitious characters, avoids the eye-winking and rib-nudging that would've blown the illusion. (The mockumentaries of Christopher Guest suffer from their obvious unreality.) Fake web sites were even set up, Blair Witch style, to promulgate his legend, even confusing some dance fans.\n\nPaul Kaye's portrayal of Frankie is solid in conveying his brazen behavior in the early going, his fear and denial as it all comes tumbling down and his rehumanization during his comeback. Frankie's a pretty brash punter and he could've come off as unworthy of sympathy in lesser hands, but Kaye makes it work to great effect. He also has a striking resemblance to Ralph Fiennes as well - someone should cast them as brothers.\n\nAlso quite good is Beatriz Batarda, who plays Penelope, the woman who helps him learn sign language and bridge the silence between him and the world. (I was genuinely surprised to learn that she wasn't actually deaf in real life.) Great comic moments comes from Mike Wilmot has his manic manager, who always has a Bluetooth cell phone earpiece attached to his head, and from his run-ins with the Cocaine Badger.\n\nWhile the film manages to get across the surface sensations of the players and their playground, it falls short when it comes to getting inside the heads of the characters. We never really get to know them as complete people and while that may be due to their hedonistic shallowness, it's still an obstacle to fully engaging with the characters. There are plenty of surreal giddiness and off-the-wall incidents, but fewer moments revealing the souls in play.\n\nDriven by Paul Kaye's frenzied performance, It's All Gone Pete Tong - the title is Cockney rhyming slang for \"it's all gone wrong\" and connects the fake Frankie to the real superstar DJ Pete Tong, who has a cameo as himself - is more interesting for its flawless spoofery than its story per se, but if you enjoyed 24 Hour Party People, this will be up your alley\n\nScore: 6 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nThe beauty of this sub-drenched Ibiza scenery is wonderfully put across in this 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer. Originally shot in 24p hi-def video, the colors are brilliant, rich and saturated and detail is outstanding. Black levels and shadow detail is top notch.\n\nThe strobe-lit club scenes which can tax compression algorhythms, resulting in blocky artifacts, are handled with aplomb but a few darker scenes with reddish tints get a bit noisy. There is a very fine grain consistent across the length of the film, but it lends a film-like look to the transfer.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nFor a movie about music and silence, the sound design is critical and the English Dolby 5.1 Surround (subtitles only in English) is an interesting technical feat. As Wilde starts experiencing tinnitus, the faint high-pitched ringing is accurately rendered and as his hearing starts to fade, the attenuation of these losses is well-rendered.\n\nIn scenes showing him beat-mixing records, one turntable is panned to one channel and the other deck is panned to the opposite side allowing us to hear what he's up to and as his hearing disappears, how badly he's doing.\n\nThere could've been more bass in the clubs scenes and the overall audio level was a bit low, but otherwise not substantial flaws were noted.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nThe disc comes in the standard keep case with an ad insert for other Sony DVDs.\n\nThere is no commentary track so the main feature is the 41-minute-long The Making of It's All Gone Pete Tong. Through interviews with the cast and producers, we're given a general overview of the conception and making of the film, including training Kaye in looking like he can man the wheels of steel and shooting in real Ibiza hotspots on business nights with the general public dancing the night away.\n\nSome scenes that didn't make the final cut - including an alternate opening that should've been put somewhere - are discussed, but the most interesting part of the whole feature was about the difficulties of getting the extras to even show up for the shoots. Also of note was the producers desire to find an English director who was fluent in the Ibiza scene, only to end up with a Canadian director who wasn't a particular fan of dance music.\n\nIn the section called Featurettes is a collection of unexplained deleted scenes or some such divided under the headings of The Rise of Frankie Wilde, The Fall of Frankie Wilde and The Redemption of Frankie Wilde.\n\nThe first area has an outtake from the Pete Tong interview scene, more testimonials from DJs and club folk and a fake deodorant commercial. The second part has a sequence with Frankie trying to film a liquor ad (that was, frankly, done much better when I saw it in Lost In Translation) and a bizarre and crushingly unfunny piece entitled Rabbi that has Kaye made up as a Hasidic rabbi rambling on about who knows what. The last section has a stupid chat show bit and another unfunny mess involving Frankie's foray into the gourmet hummus business. As short as they are - less than 20 minutes total - it's a struggle to watch these \"featurettes\" just once.\n\nWhile the making-of feature is OK, albeit slight, a commentary track with the lead actors and director would have been nice, but as the saying goes, \"you can't always get what you want.\"\n\nScore: 3 out of 10\n\nThe Bottom Line: While it's not a great movie and it doesn't provide much insight into the Ibiza scene, fans of 24 Hour Party People would probably enjoy this fictional pseudo-documentary for its similar energy."
