But when this superstar DJ loses his hearing, he loses it all; his job, his wife, his friends and his life. After a self-destructive descent into madness and paranoia, Frankie not only finds true love but also returns to the scene, bigger, better and louder than ever before.\n\nWINNER: 11 Awards including Best Canadian Feature Film at Toronto Film Festival\n\nUK, Canada | English | 2004 | 90 min | HD"
