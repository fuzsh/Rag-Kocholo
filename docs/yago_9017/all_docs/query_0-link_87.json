But the outdoor hockey rinks are open now, and that is sweet.\n\nSteve Das\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 21, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,203\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nLocation\n\nLos Angeles\n\n...There's a ton of work slated to go that we're co-producing and/or line producing in the next year, aside from our own projects...\n\nCurious about what percentage of films shown in Canada box office are U.S. Studio films vs. Canadian films ?\n\nStephen Matthews\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 12, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n518\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nLocation\n\nWhistler - Canada\n\nCurious about what percentage of films shown in Canada box office are U.S. Studio films vs. Canadian films ?\n\nVery rough guess is at least 85% US, but depends on the theater you go to, small underground ones play more independent, large chains show what I would assume are playing at most US chain theaters. Most of our best talent/ successful directors gets poached by you guys anyway *cough* James Cameron *cough*.\n\nJeremy Torrie\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 30, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,441\n\nReaction score\n\n4\n\nPoints\n\n38\n\nLocation\n\nWinnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nUnless we're talking Quebec and their French Box Office -Telefilm aims for 5%, but it's actually about 3%...so pretty easy to do the math.\n\nStephen Matthews\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 12, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n518\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nLocation\n\nWhistler - Canada\n\nfigured it was rather low, was trying to be generous.\n\nJeremy Torrie\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 30, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,441\n\nReaction score\n\n4\n\nPoints\n\n38\n\nLocation\n\nWinnipeg, MB, Canada\n\nActually Goon which is shooting in Winnipeg now with Jay Baruchel, Sean William Scott and Liev Schrieber is an $11 Million budget -and shooting Red MX.\n\nDirected by Mike Dowse so it qualifies as Canadian Content as Jay co-wrote the script.\n\nNot sure what Telefilm put in as far as equity, but Alliance is distributing.\n\nZakaree Sandberg\n\nWell-known member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 28, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n4,260\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nAge\n\n41\n\nLocation\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nDo you need a red DP for any of said films?

But you can't argue with the overall thrust that Red is taking over film in a very big way.\n\nAugust von Stolberg\n\nActive member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 28, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n30\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n0\n\nLocation\n\nLondon, UK\n\nseriously good article.
