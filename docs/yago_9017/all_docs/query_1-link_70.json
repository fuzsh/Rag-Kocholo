        "text": "Challenge\n\nDevelop a PR plan that is true to the brand’s heritage and music minded audience.\n\nIdea\n\nProduct Placement in a Blockbuster Film\n\n‘It’s all gone Pete Tong’ is a feature film about a superstar DJ who loses his hearing and almost everything else. But, despite being deaf, he creates an amazing come back album to international and critical acclaim. We worked together with TDK and their PR agency to make this film a perfect example of product placement.\n\nTDK CD’s were used to record the mixes and the brand appeared naturally in a number of key scenes as well as across a huge outdoor poster specially created for the film. ‘Back in the day’ every bedroom DJ recorded their master mixes on TDK cassette tapes, later CDs then MP3s so it was only natural to have TDK as the record label in this cult club classic.\n\nvN Services\n\nStrategy / Art & Copywriting / Product Placement."
