Tong has also worked as a record producer and is regarded as the \"global ambassador for electronic music.\"[3]\n\nQuick Facts MBE, Background information ...\n\nClose\n\nThe phrase \"It's all gone Pete Tong\", where the name is used as rhyming slang for \"it's all gone wrong\", was reputedly coined by Paul Oakenfold in late 1987 in an article about acid house called \"Bermondsey Goes Balearic\" for Terry Farley and Pete Heller's Boys Own fanzine.[4][5][6] It's All Gone Pete Tong is also the title of a 2004 film which portrays a fictional DJ's experiences as he realizes he is becoming deaf.[7] Tong appears briefly in the film. It is also the name Tong has adopted for his club night at the nightclub Pacha in Ibiza and his nightly radio programme in the United States on iHeartRadio's \"Evolution\" EDM format platform.[8][9]"
