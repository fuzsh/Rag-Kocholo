        "text": "Okay, gang. A few weeks ago our first class at Famous Directors School taught you how to become the well-paid director of endless Adam Sandler movies. (To recap: Just say yes to everything he does).\n\nNow it's time for your graduate course: How to make a basic studio romantic comedy.\n\nStep One: Pick a title that refers to an old pop song or current catchphrase. It is not important that it has anything to do with the movie.\n\nStep Two: Write your script. In Act One, have the hero tell the heroine a lie to get her to like him. In Act Two, have her find out about the lie and leave him. In Act Three, have him humiliate himself in an attempt to win her back. It works. Crowds will cheer.\n\nStep Three: If aiming at an older (16-24) audience, ensure an R rating by giving the hero a gross and grossly overweight friend and including nudity, drug use and at least one spilled bodily fluid. If aiming at a younger audience, ensure a PG-13 rating by mostly implying the above.\n\nGot it? Great. And if you forget it, don’t worry. You can always just watch “Take Me Home Tonight” and take notes.\n\nMovie Review\n\nTake Me Home Tonight (R) Relativity (97 min.) Directed by Michael Dowse. With Topher Grace, Anna Faris. Now playing in New Jersey.\n\nRating note: The film contains nudity, sexual situations, drug use, strong language and violence.\n\nStephen Whitty's Review: TWO STARS\n\nThat's not to say that the 1980s-set Topher Grace comedy is completely awful (even though it reportedly sat on a studio shelf for years). In fact, it has a few laughs — and might even have more than that if seen in one of those theaters where the ushers bring you beers.\n\nBut seen on nothing stronger than an Icee, it’s formulaic at best — and even that formula isn’t always thought through.\n\nA story about a slacker twentysomething who lies to impress his high-school crush, it has no real reason for the Reagan-era setting (and, in fact, the Aimless Young Hero fits a lot more easily into the do-your-own-thing ’60s or the nobody’s-hiring decade of today). And his subterfuge is dragged out long after it’s remotely necessary.\n\nA formula can still work — the “little white lie” setup has served writers from Shakespeare to Wilde — but there has to be something more. And it’s not here.\n\nThat said, Grace — who has his own pleasantly square persona — gives the film a center as the sympathetic hero. Having scene stealers like the always sharp Anna Faris as his sister and Dan Fogler as his out-of-control buddy helps a bit, too.\n\nAnd the big-hair, skinny-tie details are a small in-joke — as if the star of “That ’70s Show” had finally moved on to “That ’80s Movie.”\n\nBut director Michael Dowse never gives us a sense of place, and his unartfully framed shots leave lots of purposeless air. And by the last half hour, the film starts to lose sight of its own characters, making Grace “redeem” himself through a pointless, stupid dare.\n\nLike a dutiful math student, this latest romantic comedy tries to follow the standard formula and faithfully shows all its work. But in the end, it’s a cheat, only copying from other papers — and getting it wrong."
