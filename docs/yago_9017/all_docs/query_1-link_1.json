        "text": "Okay, a couple of things. First, I'm a big Paul Kaye fan, so I'm biased, and it all started with Dennis Pennis. For those of you who don't know Dennis, he's the original Ali G and IMHO much funnier. Search for \"jeff meets dennis pennis\" and you'll get a taste of Paul/Dennis and his ambush of Jeff Goldblum, who, I have to admit, rolls with the punches.\n\nAs a Paul Kaye fan, I was disappointed with Blackball. This movie (Pete Tong) was the first big Paul Kaye movie I really was looking forward to, until I read that the director was the same person who directed (and wrote) Fubar, which I cringed through and had to leave the room. (I would have turned it off, but the others were having a blast. Why? I don't know).\n\nSo, hearing that Paul was paired up with a director whose work I wasn't entirely enthralled with wasn't confidence building. I heard it won a couple of awards (Best Actor! Go Paul!) at the Aspen Film Festival in February and my confidence increased.\n\nA sneak screening changed my initial impressions completely. The first half hour is really tough and I had to fight my urge to give up on the film even though Paul does an amazing job. See, I told you I was biased, but I'm not the only one. Ask those Aspen people. However, the last two thirds of the movie completely changes from a dark comedy into a light-hearted and empowering film. The music and the colors are fabulous and shows Paul's (as deejay frank wild) breadth. The film is really a \"simple\" redemption film, of a man who finds out what's important in his life and proves it for himself.\n\nThere's a love interest as well, and this works as a date movie. All the reviews and descriptions as a \"dance\" movie (I don't even know what that's supposed to mean) isn't entirely correct. While there is dance and rave in the film, it's really a backdrop for this simple story of a complex man who has to make some tough choices in life (and deal with a disability that is his worst nightmare).\n\nPaul did an extraordinary job and I have to admit that the director really surprised me with this film, as it was nothing like his previous work. It's a difficult ride, but one worth taking. There's no \"big surprise\" ala 6th Sense nor is the beginning entirely too painful, but it's not all fun and games, either. Watch it and enjoy it and it'll be worth it. All least do it for Paul!"
