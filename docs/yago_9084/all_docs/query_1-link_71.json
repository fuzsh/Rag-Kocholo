        "text": "Mary Lee Johnson, 87, of Gettysburg and formerly of Beech Creek, passed away Friday, December 11, 2020 at WellSpan Hospital, York.\n\nBorn May 6, 1933 in Lock Haven, she was a daughter of the late Thomas Paul and Hilma Wood.\n\nMary was a graduate of Lock Haven High School.\n\nOn February 20, 1955 in Monument, she married her love, M. Paul Johnson, with whom she shared 50 years of marriage before his passing in 2005.\n\nMary served as the Office Manager at Pickelner Fuel Oil, Lock Haven, for more than 30 years.\n\nShe was a member of the Blanchard Church of Christ.\n\nMary was an avid college basketball fan, cheering for Duke and Coach K as well as a fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nMost cherished was the time she spent with family and friends.\n\nSurviving are two children, Thomas P. (Karen) Johnson of Mill Hall and Carmen N. (John) Heiser of Gettysburg; three sisters: Joan Hodge of Danbury, CT, Marsha Croll of Mill Hall and Susan Wood of Sturbridge, MA; two grandchildren, Christianne (Mike) Johnson Schwenk of East Quoque, NY and Patrick (Chiara) Johnson of Wexford; and her great granddaughter, Maison Schwenk, who she adored.\n\nAlong with her husband, she was preceded in death by a son, Joel S. Johnson in 2010.\n\nDue to concerns for family and friends regarding the pandemic, a Memorial Service will be scheduled at a later date. Interment will take place at Cedar Hill Cemetery, Mill Hall.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Blanchard Church of Christ through the funeral home.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of the Donald G. Walker Funeral Home, Inc., 231 High St., Flemington, Pa 17745."
