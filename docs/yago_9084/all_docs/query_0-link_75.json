        "text": "THE creator of the World Wide Web is unveiling a plan to \"fix\" the internet.\n\nBrit genius Sir Tim Berners Lee, 64, will today warn of a \"digital dystopia\" as he launches a global scheme to tackle misuse of the web, such as online harassment and fake news.\n\nSir Tim's World Wide Web Foundation put together the Contract for the Web, calling on governments, companies and the public to ensure the web is a safe, free and open platform for all.\n\nLaunching in Berlin on Monday, it aims to halt ever-increasing online threats, such as election interference, invasion of privacy and the spread of disinformation.\n\nThe commitment has been backed by hundreds of organisations, including Google and Facebook, which sets out nine key principles.\n\n\"The power of the web to transform people's lives, enrich society and reduce inequality is one of the defining opportunities of our time,\" Sir Tim explained.\n\n\"But if we don't act now, and act together, to prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering that potential.\n\n\"The Contract for the Web gives us a roadmap to build a better web. But it will not happen unless we all commit to the challenge.\n\n\"Governments need to strengthen laws and regulations for the digital age. Companies must do more to ensure pursuit of profit is not at the expense of human rights and democracy.\n\n\"And citizens must hold those in power accountable, demand their digital rights be respected and help foster healthy conversation online. It's up to all of us to fight for the web we want.\"\n\nThe plan tells governments to ensure everyone can connect to the internet, that access is not deliberately denied and to respect and protect people's fundamental online privacy and data rights.\n\nCompanies are told they should make the internet affordable and accessible to everyone, respect and protect people's privacy and personal data, as well as develop technologies that support the best in humanity and challenge the worst.\n\nMeanwhile, citizens are urged to be creators and collaborators on the web, build strong communities that respect civil discourse and human dignity, and fight for the web.\n\nSpeaking to the Press Association, World Wide Web Foundation president and chief executive Adrian Lovett said one of the biggest concerns is that just under half the world has no access to the web at all.\n\n\"For those who do have the web, it has become much more complicated in the last few years, and I think the key issues there include the problem of disinformation, the challenge of data breaches and lack of security over our data and control over our data, and also governments in parts of the world increasingly closing down or censoring the web or parts of the internet around periods of unrest or elections and so on,\" he said.\n\n\"We will have a process going forward after the launch of the Contract to ensure that we track progress of all of those who have signed on, and others too who haven't, and report that progress, make sure it's public, make sure that we're able to see who is going in the right direction and who is not.\"\n\nIn March, Sir Tim called on people to think about the sort of web they want, as he marked the 30th anniversary of his invention.\n\nEarlier this year, Berners-Lee called on society to help stamp out state-sponsored hacking, crime and clickbait.\n\nElon Musk's just launched a rogue fleet of internet satellites so big it's blocking the view of stars, according to astronomers.\n\nDesigns for the 'first space hotel' have been revealed and it's as weird and futuristic as you would expect.\n\nDo you think the internet needs saving?
