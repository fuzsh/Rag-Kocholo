        "text": "Hi, I’m Jennifer. I’m the author of the new book, Think Like a Breadwinner: A Wealth-Building Manifesto for Women Who Want to Earn More (and Worry Less), which was inspired by my own wake-up call and journey to financial freedom and by my desire to help empower other women financially and professionally to create the lives they want. The book is packed with tools, stories and insights to help expand the way you think about your financial capabilities and the possibilities for your life, and to recognize and overcome the internal and external barriers that can get in the way of that. It’s specifically designed to help move us beyond just covering the bills and saving a little for retirement to truly taking care of ourselves and our future—and having fun fulfilling our desires.\n\n​"
