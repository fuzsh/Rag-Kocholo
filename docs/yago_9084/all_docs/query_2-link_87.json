HE.\"— Presentation transcript:\n\n1 BERNERS LEE IS A BRITISH COMPUTER SCIENTIST WHO INVENTED THE WORLD WIDE WEB. TIMOTHY JOHN BERNERS LEE WAS BORN ON 8 JUNE 1955 AND GREW UP IN LONDON. HE STUDIED PHYSICS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY AND BECAME A SOFTWARE ENGINEER. IN 1980, WHILE WORKING AT CERN, THE EUROPEAN PARTICLE PHYSICS LABORATORY IN GENEVA, HE FIRST DESCRIBED THE CONCEPT OF A GLOBAL SYSTEM, BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF 'HYPERTEXT', THAT WOULD ALLOW RESEARCHERS ANYWHERE TO SHARE INFORMATION. HE ALSO BUILT A PROTOTYPE CALLED 'ENQUIRE'. IN 1984, BERNERS LEE'S RETURNED TO CERN, WHICH WAS ALSO HOME TO A MAJOR EUROPEAN INTERNET NODE. IN 1989, BERNERS LEE PUBLISHED A PAPER CALLED 'INFORMATION MANAGEMENT: A PROPOSAL' IN WHICH HE MARRIED UP HYPERTEXT WITH THE INTERNET, TO CREATE A SYSTEM FOR SHARING AND DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION NOT JUST WITHIN A COMPANY, BUT GLOBALLY. HE NAMED IT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. HE ALSO CREATED THE FIRST WEB BROWSER AND EDITOR. THE WORLD'S FIRST WEBSITE, HTTP://INFO.CERN.CH, WAS LAUNCHED ON 6 AUGUST 1991. IT EXPLAINED THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONCEPT AND GAVE USERS AN INTRODUCTION TO GETTING STARTED WITH THEIR OWN WEBSITES. IN 1994, BERNERS LEE FOUNDED THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM AT THE LABORATORY OF COMPUTER SCIENCE (LCS) AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN BOSTON. HE HAS SERVED AS DIRECTOR OF THE CONSORTIUM SINCE THEN. HE ALSO WORKS AS A SENIOR RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT LCS WHICH HAS NOW BECOME THE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LABORATORY.\n\n2 1.Time Berners-Lee made the first communication between an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) client and server through the internet in November 1989. He invented the World Wide Web. 2.He received a knighthood in 2004 from Queen Elizabeth II. 3.He is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) a group set up to oversee the development of the World Wide Web. 4.He was honoured during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. 5.He was born on 8th June 1955 in London. 6.In 2001, Tim Berners-Lee became a Fellow of the Royal Society. 7.He was a very keen trains potter when he was a child and he enjoyed playing with model railways. 8.He has admitted that the pair of slashes (//) in web addresses ended up being unnecessary. He said he could have designed URLs without them, but didn’t realise at the time. 9.He was one of Time Magazine’s ‘100 Most Important People of the 20th Century’. 10.He is sometimes referred to as TimBL.\n\n3 Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the software program known as the World Wide Web in 1989, is ascientist in the true sense of the word—idealistic, interested in the pure pursuit of knowledge, and uncomfortable in the media spotlight. Yet his invention, which provides an easy way to access the Internet, has made a huge impact on modern business and communications. Some experts claim that the World Wide Web has revolutionized the ability of computer users around the world to connect to each other. Simply put, the Web provides a way to retrieve and access documents on the Internet, the bare-bones network devised by the Pentagon that links computers around the world. On the original Internet, there were no easy ways to retrieve data. But Berners-Lee developed software that contained processes for encoding documents (HTML, hypertext markup language), linking them (HTTP, hypertext transfer protocol), and addressing them (URL, universal resource locator). Documents could then be linked worldwide. He posted this software, free of charge to anyone who wanted it, on the Internet. The Web has become a way for many businesses to sell themselves or their products and has made money for some computer scientists. Berners-Lee, however, refused to cash in on his invention. He remained a conscientious scientist, and an advocate for using the Web as a way to link the world for the benefit of all. To that end, he heads the World Wide Web Consortium, a group of 120 companies that set standards and guide the growth of the Web. Developed Affinity for Computers Berners-Lee developed a hunger for knowledge and a fascination with computers early in his life. His English parents helped design the first computer that was commercially available worldwide, the Ferranti Mark I. As a boy, he spent his time making toy computers out of boxes. He remembers conversations at the dinner table as centering around mathematics; it was more likely to be about the square root of four than the neighbors down the block.\n\n4 Campaigned for Better Web The growing lack of intimacy and the increasing number of companies who charge for access to their Web sites, are two developments that disappointed Berners- Lee. \"The Web was supposed to be a creative tool, an expressive tool,\" he said. Berners-Lee remains an avid campaigner for keeping the Web open, for making sure no one company dominates it. \"He has a real commitment to keep the Web open as a public good, in economic terms,\" the director of the MIT computer science lab, Michael Dertouzos, explained in a 1995 New York Times article. Berners-Lee considered trying to commercialize the Web as he was designing it and was approached by several software companies who wanted to buy it. But in the end, he remained an idealist and refused all offers, instead making the Web available to all. One of his biggest fears about the Internet is that various competing browsers or competing programming languages could all set up their own turf, so that users would need several types of browsers or languages to access the entire Web. \"The navigation of the Web has to be open,\" he insists. \"If the day comes when you need six browsers on your machine, the World Wide Web will no longer be the World Wide Web.\" Received Awards for Web Work Berners-Lee has his own Web site (www.W3.org/People/Berners-Lee). He is continually bombarded by requests from the press for interviews and gets many questions from inveterate Web users. Berners-Lee has received numerous awards for his work on the Web, including the Kilby Foundation's \"Young Innovator of the Year Award\" in 1995. He has honorary degrees from the Parsons School of Design and Southhampton University and is a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. Yet in public he remains a diffident man, who reveals very little personal information in interviews. He is married to Nancy Carlson, an American. They met in Europe while both were taking an acting class; she was then working for the World Health Organization. They have two children, one born in 1991, the other in 1994. Despite his diffidence with the press, he is a warm, artistic man who can be the life of a party, his friends say.\n\n5 INFORMATION ABOUT WWW Learn some great Internet facts and interesting information about the World Wide Web. What’s the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web? Find out this and many more fun technology fact for kids Although the World Wide Web is often referred to as the Internet, the two are not the same thing. The Internet is a huge network of networks that links computers together all over the world using a range of wires and wireless technologies. The World Wide Web is the collection of linked pages that are accessed using the Internet and a web browser. English physicist Sir Tim Berners-Lee is regarded as having invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Since then he has continued the development of web standards and other web related projects. Website addresses such as http://www.sciencekids.co.nz are known by the term Uniform Resource Locater (URL). The domain name system of the Internet includes top level domains such as.com,.info,.net,.org,.edu,.mil and.gov as well as country specific domains and more.\n\n6 As well as the World Wide Web, the Internet is used for such application as email, file sharing, online chat, phone and video calls, online gaming and more. Thanks to the increasing accessibility of the Internet, the popularity of the web has exploded over the last 10 years. The web is now used for a number of different purposes including online shopping, social networking, games, news, travel information, business, advertising and much more. social networking websites such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter have become popular over the last few years. People now spend a large amount of their time online keeping in touch with each other through these applications and services. Security and privacy concerns have always been a problem on the Internet with many people often unaware of the potential risks they take when inputting confidential data, passwords and personal information into various websites. Viruses and spam emails are other sources over security concerns which frequently cause disruptions and headaches for users of the web. one of the best and most common ways of finding information on the web is through the use of search engines such as Google and Bing. Google is currently the most popular search engine, receiving hundreds of millions of search queries every day. Information about www"
