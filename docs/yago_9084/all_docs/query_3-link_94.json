Bo served in the Navy during the Vietnam War before returning home to North Carolina. Six months after meeting the love of his life, Janice, on a blind date in Greensboro, North Carolina, Bo married Janice on December 31, 1970. After marriage, Bo and Janice moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where they reared three boys and a beautiful girl. The family moved to Sumter in 1989. Before retirement, Bo spent his professional career in sales.\n\nBo loved history, politics, classic cars, South Carolina Gamecock football, Willie Nelson, fishing, and his newspapers.\n\nSurviving, in addition to Janice, are four children, Kenneth Lee Williams, III, of Asheville, NC; Andrew “Drew” R.

Bo is also survived by his sister Penny Williams and her husband Mike of Cary, NC; his sister Candy Roper and her husband Asa of Greensboro, NC; his brother Tim Williams and his wife Beth of Charlotte, NC; and former daughter-in-law and family friend Meredith Kennedy of Columbia, SC.\n\nAn interment with military honors will be held at the Ft. Jackson National Cemetery at 2:00 pm on Friday, February 4, 2022. Vaccinated family and friends will be received following the interment at Jonathan and Stephanie’s home in Columbia.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to the Alston Wilkes Society, which rebuilds the lives of homeless veterans and others at risk in our community, at 3519 Medical Drive, Columbia, South Carolina 29203.\n\nYou may go to www.bullockfuneralhome.com and sign the family’s guest book.\n\nThe family has chosen Bullock Funeral Home for the arrangements."
