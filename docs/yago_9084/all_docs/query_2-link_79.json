        "text": "Tim Berners-Lee\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England. His parents were Mary Lee Wood and Conway Berners-Lee who were both Mathematicians and Computer Programmers. He was raised as only child and went to Emmanuel School in Wadsworth, England. He was a student at Oxford University where he studied physics and got his Bachelors of Science in Physics. While there he made computers out of spare parts. He was banned from the schools computers because he was caught hacking. After he graduated he got a job as a software engineer at CERN,a European organization for Nuclear Research and large particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. There many scientists engaging in tests at â€ªCERN and returning to their labs around the globe, these scientists were eager to share and exchange results and information but it was very difficult to send masses of information. Tim realized this problem and saw the potential to create something. Tim berners-lee, understood the untouched potential of all of computers connected together through the power of the Internet.\n\nTim Berners-Lee had a chance to make millions even billions with the invention of internet, but he realized the importance of it being free without making it free it would have failed because people would be afraid to test this new project and would have no free advertisement. He also realized the importance of free sharing throughout the World Wide Web.\n\nOnce the amount of users on the Web hit a specific goal, its functionality, and therefore its group appeal, began to go through the roof. Scientists and other researchers recognized that it was easier to post data once, on their website or web page, rather than to continually respond and answer email questi...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...gious engineers, scientists and technologists from the United Kingdom. He has received many international awards for his inventions. In the year of 2004 he was entitled by Queen Elizabeth the Second, and in the year of 2007 he was awarded the Order of Merit. He is also honored in 100 greatest minds in this century.\n\nThis invention helps shape the world many ways. This is may be the best and fastest way of transporting information. This can help many people such as students who have to do research reports or have a curiosity about a certain subject. Tim Berners-Lee is innovator and has helped the world change mainly in the best way possible without his creation we wouldn't have catch as many criminals or terrorists.\n\nIn Conclusion Tim Berners-Lee is quite possible the best innovators in the the world. This invention helps the entire world to share ideas or opinions."
