        "text": "Welcome to The Art of The Impossible, a weekly newsletter where I unearth five pieces of content which I hope will both inspire and embolden you.\n\nAnd as we work our way through January of a new year, I hope you feel inspired to pursue your goals with vigour.\n\nNow back to the newsletter…\n\nPODCAST\n\nTo mark episode 100 of the Danielle Newnham Podcast, I have a very special guest coming on the show next week - Mr Stephen Wolfram - if you have any questions you would like me to ask him, please leave them in the comments!\n\nAlso in podcasts… below is a link to Bill Gates in conversation with Sam Altman of OpenAI. In this conversation, they cover why today’s AI models are the dumbest they will ever be, how societies adapt to technological change, and even where humanity will find purpose once we’ve perfected artificial intelligence.\n\nFull 33 mins episode here.\n\nQUOTE\n\nINTERVIEW\n\nMost of you probably know who Tim Berners-Lee is but do you know about his mother, Mary?\n\nMary Lee Berners-Lee was a computer scientist, born 12 March 1924 and died 29 November 2017. She studied mathematics at the University of Birmingham before become a leading mathematician and computer programmer, working in a team led by John Bennett that developed programs for Manchester University’s series of Ferranti Mark 1 computers.\n\nShe later married fellow mathematician and computer scientist, Conway Berners-Lee and had four children, three of which followed them into “computing” - their eldest son, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, invented the World Wide Web.\n\nAfter a period devoted to bringing up her children, she became a schoolteacher of mathematics and then a programmer using Basic, FORTRAN, and other programming languages before retiring in 1987.\n\nIn this interview from 2001, Berners-Lee talks about her childhood in Birmingham, getting an education during WWII, her astrophysics fellowship in Australia, and her time working at Ferranti.\n\nRead the full interview with Mary here.\n\nBerners-Lee: I was the person who was selected to go and see the management and make the case—and we won that.\n\nAbbate: So what was the outcome?\n\nBerners-Lee: We got equal pay! All the women got raises, to be equal with the men.\n\nBOOK\n\nThe MANIAC by Benjamín Labatut\n\nJohn von Neumann was a titan of science. A Hungarian who revolutionized every field he touched, his mathematical powers were so exceptional that Hans Bethe - a Nobel Prize-winning physicist - thought he might represent the next step in human evolution.\n\nAfter seeking the foundations of mathematics during his youth in Germany, von Neumann emigrated to the United States, where he became entangled in the power games of the Cold War; he designed the world's first programmable computer, invented game theory, pioneered AI and digital life, and helped to create the atomic bomb. He was the darling of the military industrial complex, but when illness unmoored his mind, his work pushed further into areas beyond human comprehension and control.\n\nThe MANIAC places von Neumann at the center of a literary triptych about the dark foundations of our modern world and the nascent era of AI. It begins with Paul Ehrenfest, an Austrian physicist and close friend of Einstein, who fell into despair when he saw science and technology become tyrannical forces; it ends a hundred years later, in the showdown between the South Korean Go Master, Lee Sedol, and the AI program AlphaGo.\n\nBuy the book here.\n\nWATCH\n\nHow to tell stories that give you meaning: Jane Goodall, Terry Crews & Dan McAdams\n\nI enjoyed this compilation of interview clips with actor Terry Crews, renowned conservationist Jane Goodall and psychologist Dan McAdams where they discuss the significance of the stories we tell ourselves, as well as the importance of vision and purpose.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThank you for reading the newsletter and for listening to the podcast, and if you enjoy them, please do share with your network - my goal is to have these stories reach as many as possible so that others can be inspired too. And if you have two minutes, please do leave a review for the podcast - it would mean the world to me and helps others to find it too.\n\nUntil next time…\n\nDanielle"
