        "text": "Mary Cable, age 94, of Stover passed away Sunday, November 13, 2022 at Centerpoint Medical Center in Independence, Missouri.\n\nMary Lee Cable was born on the 1st day of January, 1928 in rural Morgan County, Missouri to Charles Estel Simmons and Dollie Rose Gerlt.\n\nMary grew up on the family farm and spoke often of the work she did to help her father, including plowing the fields, driving the truck to the lumber mill, making fence posts and selling them for 5 cents each, and other various jobs that showed her strength and grit. She would often say that she was able to do more physical labor than some of the boys around her even though she was just a tiny thing.\n\nShe later moved to Sedalia with her sister Cleo to work in a restaurant, and then to Kansas City.\n\nShe returned to Versailles, where she married William Henry Cable on the 6th of May, 1949. They returned to Kansas City and started a family. Mary worked for Dodd’s Bakery and found her passion in making cakes. She attended the Wilton School of Cake Decorating and was taught by Mr. Wilton himself. She quickly gained favor in the business and was asked to make cakes for prominent figures in the community. Even President Truman requested that his birthday cakes be made by her.\n\nMary and Henry later moved to Buckner, Missouri, where she opened her own cake shop. People came from near and far to get their cakes made by the famous Mrs. Cable. She continued to raise her children and then care for her grandchildren in this home. When she wasn’t in the cake shop, she was tending to her garden, cooking, canning, quilting, sewing, cross stitching, selling Avon, and bowling on a league in Blue Springs. After retirement, they built a home in Stover, Missouri and returned to the community they grew up in. There, Mary continued to make cakes for friends and family, as well as tending to their garden, helping those around her, and spending quality time with her family and friends, including four children, seven grandchildren, twenty-two great-grandchildren, and 7 great-great grandchildren.\n\nMary was preceded in death by her parents Charles Estel Simmons and Dollie Rose Gerlt, her brothers Maxie Elroy and William Jacob, her sister Stella Cleo Adams, her son William Everette Cable, her husband William Henry Cable, and a son-in-law, Gary Smith.\n\nThose who remain to carry on her legacy include three daughters and sons-in-law, Vickie and Wayne Dowell of Greenwood, Missouri; Patty Smith of Odessa, Missouri; Jackie and Donnie Cochran of Chandler, Arizona; seven grandchildren, Chris Smith, Cassy Wendel, Kim Wood, Tracey Duplantis, Sarah Adler, James Cable, and Michelle Dowell; twenty two great grandchildren, Tieler Smith; Payton Smith; Hayden Smith; Katie Smith; Cole Smith; Dempsey Wood; Brenden Wood; Samantha Wood; Nathan Wood; Lindsey Jones; Tatum Wendel; Ty Wendel; Cade Cable; Alea Cable; Brooke Adler; Jason Adler; Alexis Adler; Emma Duplantis; Maggie Duplantis; Phoebe Duplantis; Kendra Robison; and Kyler Corley.\n\nVisitation will be 12:30 p.m. Saturday, November 19th, followed by a 1:00 p.m. service at Scrivner-Page-Dady Funeral Home in Stover, Missouri. Burial will follow at the Stover Cemetery."
