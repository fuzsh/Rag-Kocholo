        "text": "The Internet has many fathers: Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who came up with a system to let different computer networks interconnect and communicate; Ray Tomlinson, the creator of e-mail and the ‘@’ symbol; Ted Nelson, who coined the term hypertext; and scores of others. But the web itself? Well, that has one father only, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He is worshipped as a rarity of his breed – a computer scientist driven by moral and political idealism, uninterested in the vast material reward that his invention could have brought him.\n\nHe might have been another entrepreneur like Bill Gates (on whom he will not be drawn). Instead he chose not to patent his creation, determined that it would be free for all.\n\nPerhaps this modesty – he once described himself as ‘over-honoured’ – stems from his remarkably sensible childhood. He was one of four children born to Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods, who were both computer mathematicians in the team that built the Manchester Mark I, the first ever electronic stored-program computer. He was raised in a family atmosphere of contented geekiness, in the leafy suburbs of East Sheen, southwest London.\n\nHis parents’ enthusiasm obviously rubbed off. The young Berners-Lee occupied himself by building computers out of cardboard. It was, by all accounts, a comfortable and happy upbringing, leading smoothly to an Oxford degree and life on the research circuit. He is married with two children and comes across as being thoroughly grounded, without pretension. He is a prominent member of the Unitarian movement, a dissenting church that grew out of the Reformation and denies the divinity of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn 1980, Berners-Lee proposed a project to CERN, based on the novel idea of hypertext, to help researchers to share information. He built a prototype system named ENQUIRE. Four years later he became a fellow at CERN and by 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe. Berners-Lee then had the inspiration to take the hypertext idea developed in ESQUIRE and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas, and so created the World Wide Web. He wrote his initial proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, with the help of Robert Cailliau, produced a practical working version on the NeXTSTEP platform, with the first web browser, and the first Web server, called httpd (HyperText Transfer Protocol daemon).\n\nTim’s browser was highly advanced, and included an editor. It envisaged a web that included what we now think of as Wikis and Blogs, so he really should be credited as the inventor of these too. Even now, browsers have not entirely caught up with this ambitious prototype.\n\nThe first Web site, developed by Berners-Lee, was constructed in August 1991 to provide an explanation about the World Wide Web, Web Servers and browsers. It gave instructions on how to set up a Web server.\n\nTim then went on to found the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT in 1994. Tim made his idea available freely, with no patent or royalties. In the same spirit, the World Wide Web Consortium decided that their standards must be put in the public domain, so that they could be easily adopted by anyone.\n\nTim continues to working to refine the World Wide Web still further. He has reluctantly accepted a role as arbiter and seer, despite being far more relaxed and excited when talking about the technology than when he is being fêted as ‘the father of the web’.\n\nIn 2007 Berners-Lee was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most important people of the past century and, amongst his other posts, is the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Senior Researcher at MITs Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL), where he leads the Decentralised Information Group (DIG), and is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southampton’s Electronics and Computer Science Centre."
