How-to found a growing market in the Victorian era, and the publishers promoted their book as an answer to “everything”.\n\nWhether You Wish to Model a Flower in Wax;\n\nto Study the Rules of Etiquette;\n\nto Serve a Relish for Breakfast or Supper;\n\nto Plan a Dinner for a Large Party or a Small One;\n\nto Cure a Headache;\n\nto Make a Will;\n\nto Get Married;\n\nto Bury a Relative;\n\nWhatever You May Wish to Do, Make, or to Enjoy,\n\nProvided Your Desire has Relation to the Necessities of Domestic Life,\n\nI Hope You will not Fail to \"Enquire Within.\"\n\n(From the introduction to the first edition)\n\nOf course, no book could live up to such extravagant promises, Enquire Within on Everything, in its own way, sparked the creation of the world wide web, where you could really “enquire within” for everything.\n\nIn the years after its publication, Enquire Within became a staple of the English household, something that continued well into the 20th century.\n\nMary Lee and Conway Berners-Lee were computer scientists, even before computer science existed as a profession. The two met while working for the electrical engineering and equipment firm, Ferranti, and in 1954, they were married. Their eldest son, Timothy John, was born in 1955, on this day.\n\nThe young Tim Berners-Lee was fascinated by practical science. “When you were in elementary school, you could make things with magnets and wire and nails. And as you come to high school, suddenly transistors were available, and they’d become cheap enough for a kid to buy, and then, when you find that transistors aren’t that complicated and you realize you know how to build a computer, the microprocessor comes out,” he told the Washington Post in a 2019 interview.\n\nOne of the books at the Berbers Lee household was an old copy of Enquire Within on Everything. The book fascinated the boy, and later he would say “With its title of suggestive magic, the book served as a portal to a world of information, everything from how to remove clothing stains to tips on investing money.”\n\nAfter graduating from Oxford in 1976, Berners-Lee worked as a “jobbing programmer”, joining CERN – the acronym for European Organization for Nuclear Research (How it got that acronym is a story by itself, one that uncertainly involves Werner Heisenberg) – in 1980. Here he wrote a program to document links between people, computers, and projects at CERN. This was the program that would, over the course of the next 11 years, change and grow to become the World Wide Web.\n\nThe name of the program?\n\nENQUIRE"
