        "text": "Mary Lee Simmons, age\n\nMary Lee Simmons, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and friend, passed away peacefully surrounded by her family on June 22, 2023 in Branson, MO. Born on October 8, 1944 in Chelsea Naval Hospital in Boston, MA, to the late Roy M. Howlett and Mary E. (O'Brien) Howlett, Mary Lee was a thoughtful, creative, and selfless individual who touched the lives of many throughout her 78 years.\n\nGrowing up as the daughter of a Navy man, Mary Lee attended several different elementary schools as her family moved frequently. She graduated from high school in East Prairie, MO, before pursuing her passion for art at the University of Missouri in Columbia, where she studied for two years. In the mid 1960’s she worked in the secretarial pool at McDonnell Douglas during the excitement of the Gemini space program. In the late 1960’s she worked in downtown St. Louis and had a window view of the Gateway Arch construction.\n\nOn August 18, 1968, Mary Lee married the love of her life, Bob R. Simmons at her aunt’s house in East Prairie, MO. She and Bob moved to Branson in 1971 from California following Bob’s discharge from the Army. Mary Lee was devoted to caring for and guiding her family. Her legacy lives on through the many artistic talents passed down to her children and grandchildren, shared family recipes, and her witty sense of humor.\n\nMary Lee’s love for art extended beyond her studies, as she was an avid photographer and artist throughout her life. She also enjoyed beaches and exploring the great outdoors as a nature walker, capturing the essence of life in her creative pursuits.\n\nIn addition to her artistic talents, Mary Lee was known for her selflessness and dedication to helping others. She attended First Baptist Church in Branson, where she worked with special needs students from Tan-Tone. Later, she attended Branson Bible Church continuing her commitment to her faith and community.\n\nMary Lee is survived by Bob, her loving husband of nearly 55 years; her children, Robin K. Simmons-Cerilli and husband Joseph of Orlando, FL, David R. Simmons and wife Roxane of Orlando, and Joel R. Simmons of Ozark, MO. She was a proud grandmother to Ysabel Maseda, Autumn Simmons, and Luke Simmons, who will cherish her memory.\n\nMary Lee was preceded in death by her parents, Roy M. Howlett and Mary (O'Brien) Howlett, and her sister, Janice Townsend.\n\nVisitation for Mary Lee will be Wednesday evening, June 28 from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. at Snapp-Bearden Funeral Home & Crematory.
