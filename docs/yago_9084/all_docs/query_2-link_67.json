        "text": "Who is Tim Berners-Lee?\n\nTim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who has to his credit one of the most revolutionary inventions of the twentieth century, the World Wide Web (www). Timothy Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955, in London, England, to Mary Lee Woods and Conway.\n\nBerners-Lee. He has three siblings. His love for computers came from his computing family. For his education, he attended London’s Emanuel School till 1973. After he graduated, he joined the queen’s college at the University of Oxford. In 1976, he received a degree in physics.\n\nFirst Job of his Career\n\nLee got his first job as an engineer at a tale-communications company in Plessey. During the 1970s, he worked with various companies. In 1980, he was hired by CERN as an independent software engineer. He came up with a programmed which used hypertext, a language that allows embedding link in text. His programme was called ‘Enquire’. The same programme was also used to build the World Wide Wed.\n\nMajor Creation of Lee, HTML, HTTPS, URLs0\n\nIn 1981, he worked at John Pole’s Image Computer System Limited He worked there for three years and gained lots of technical knowledge. A few years later, he went back to CERN. He noticed that hundred employees worked at the organization and it was getting difficult for them to manage and share information with each other.\n\nHe thought of making an easier and more efficient method for data sharing. He presented his plans to CERN. He explained how he planned on distributing information all over the internet. Around 1989, he was entirely focused on building the web. He created three new systems to make the new web work.\n\nT hey were HTML, HTTP and URL. The first one was Hypertext markup Language (HTML), a computer language for Web-pages. The second was the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used for recovering documents. And the last one was the Universal Resource Locators (URLs0, which are the web addresses.\n\nFirst Website by Lee & Became Inventor of WWW’s\n\nIn 1990, which CERN, Lee launched the world’s first website. The first website was simply called info.cern.ch. It was put online in 1991. The information easily and also gathers it all in one location.\n\nTo improve his web, he founded the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) he decided to keep the technologies royalty-free and open to the public. This meant that anyone could use them and the benefits. It changed people’s lives. Lee’s WWW’s impact was the same as that of the invention of the television or the radio, if not more.\n\nAs a Founder of 3com and Career Achievements, data.gov.uk.\n\nIn 1999, Lee became the first holder of the 3Com Founders Chair. Lee even protected the freedom of the web. He made it possible to open the information-sharing platform for everyone. He gave every person the right to use the web and advocated for net neutrality. He did not want the government to get involved or put any restrictions on the usage on the WWW.\n\nNot only is Lee a great innovators, but he is also a great teacher and another. In 2004, he worked as a professor in the computer science department at the University of Southampton. In 2006, he became the co-director of the Web Science Trust. The trust was started to study the World Wide Web and propose solutions for its usage and design.\n\nIn 2009, he worked solutions as a director of the World Wide Web Foundation. Lee worked with the UK government on a project, which made UK data more accessible to the public. Its website was called He continued to work with the government and because a member of the Public Sector Transparency Board.\n\nWizard of the Century, Accomplishment, People of Century Magazine\n\nLee also wrote about the importance of the internet. In 1999, he published his first book called Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web. It narrates his journey of crating the web and the planning that went into it. In 2006, he released A Framework for Web Science, his second book, co-authored by other computer scientists and researchers.\n\nLee is receipts of many awards and hours. In 1995, he received The Software System Award. In 1999, he was named as one of the ‘100 most important People of the 20 the century’ by Time magazine. In the year 2004, he was appointed Honorary Knight Commoner of the Order of the British Empire and was awarded the Order of merit for his ‘service to the global development of the internet."
