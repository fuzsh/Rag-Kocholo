        "text": "Every now and then, dreamers find themselves in the right point in time and space to spark a revolution. Whether it’s the invention of a technology, the start of a company, or a gaze to the stars, these moments change the future and define their creators’ legacies.\n\nBut as the computer industry ages, so too do its founders. In the past 12 months, we have bid farewell to designers of algorithms, teachers of students, and connectors of countries. We will always remember the 13 luminaries featured here who shaped our technology and our culture.\n\nNancy Grace Roman: Mother of the Hubble telescope\n\nWell before and after she formed an astronomy club at the age of 11, Nancy Grace Roman looked to the stars. After she earned her Ph.D. in astronomy in 1949, she joined the Naval Research Laboratory. There, she observed that a star had changed its emission spectrum, a discovery that earned her recognition and ultimately led to her joining NASA in 1959, just a year after the organization’s founding. She became NASA’s first chief of astronomy and solar physics — and one of NASA’s first female executives — in 1961; a year later, she led NASA’s first successful astronomical mission, the Orbiting Solar Observatory-1.\n\nCorbató died at 93 of complications from diabetes.\n\nPatrick Henry Winston: Intelligent speaker\n\nPatrick Henry Winston saw artificial intelligence as having the potential to be our greatest teacher — but to do that, AI had to understand our stories.\n\nWinston pursued this mission at MIT, where he earned his bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees, culminating in a thesis under the famed Marvin Minsky. Winston spent the rest of his life on his alma mater’s faculty, succeeding Minsky as director of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which eventually became CSAIL: the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. At CSAIL, Winston led Genesis, an initiative to develop an AI that could understand and interpret short stories.\n\nHe also empowered the MIT community to share their own stories with his annual lecture, “How to Speak,” brimming with strategies for oral presentations, conversations, and interviews. “He long held that great ideas weren’t enough — you had to know how to convey them,” wrote MIT colleague Randall Davis.\n\nAs much as Winston loved AI, he loved people more. Just five months before he passed at the age of 76, his very last lecture concluded: “What is the greatest computing innovation of all time? It’s us.”\n\nDanny Cohen: Pilot programmer\n\nFirst, he gave computers wings; then, he gave them a voice. These are just two of Danny Cohen’s many contributions as an early internet pioneer.\n\nIn 1967, while a doctoral student at Harvard, this Israeli-born computer scientist and pilot developed the first 3D flight simulator as a training tool, replacing the cameras and 2D models that commercial pilots historically used. The Cohen–Sutherland algorithm he co-authored was one of the first methods for rendering a moving perspective while navigating a 3D space.\n\nCohen was then recruited by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to devise a method for transmitting speech over the ARPAnet. The result was the world’s first voice-over-internet conference call in 1978. Other prototypes he developed included a digital library, an e-commerce system, and a high-speed local-area networking system for computer clusters, a technology that would evolve into cloud computing.\n\nFor all these accomplishments, Cohen was among the first class inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame — and in 2013, an all-star cast of internet luminaries celebrated his achievements.\n\nCohen was 81.\n\nSally Floyd: Routing the way\n\nAfter working as a computer systems engineer for San Francisco’s BART public transit system, Sally Floyd enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. Upon earning a Ph.D. in computer science in 1989, she joined the Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nIt was at that time, when internet protocols were inefficient and not widely understood, that Floyd co-developed Random Early Decision (RED), an algorithm that prevents internet congestion by keeping packets of data from overloading buffers or being discarded. RED is used in almost all network routers today and is the basis for the field of Active Queue Management.\n\nAmong other honors, Floyd’s work earned her the Association for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM) award. “Dr. Floyd has combined the community spirit and dedication that was present in the early Internet with the intellectual rigor that characterizes today’s research community,” said the award’s 2007 press release. At the time, Floyd was computer science’s eighth most cited researcher; today, her 1993 RED paper has been cited over 9,100 times.\n\nFloyd later worked at the International Computer Science Institute’s Center for Internet Research from 1999 until 2007, when she retired after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She died from metastatic gallbladder cancer at the age of 69.\n\nTarek Kamel: Connecting nations\n\nWhen the Arab Spring arrived in Egypt in January 2011, Tarek Kamel was the country’s minister of communications and information technology. He was also the one who armed the protesters with social media: almost twenty years earlier, Kamel had established Egypt’s first internet connection.\n\nAfter earning his Ph.D. in Germany in 1992, Kamel returned to his native Egypt, where he spent seven years as a manager of the Communications and Networking Department at the Cabinet Information and Decision Support Centre. During this time, he founded the Internet Society of Egypt, putting the country online. Kamel joined the Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology upon its formation in 1999.\n\nAfter departing the Egyptian government in 2011, Kamel joined the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as senior vice president of global government and IGO engagement.\n\n“Tarek had the unique ability to bring people together and forget our differences,” wrote Göran Marby, president and CEO of ICANN, in a blog post dedicated to Kamel’s memory. Vinton Cerf, co-developer of TCP/IP, chimed in: “Our Internet community has lost a kindred spirit so devoted to the idea of a global Internet to hold and use in common.”\n\nKamel was 57.\n\nMark Hurd: Human calculator\n\nMark Hurd’s corporate rise had a humble beginning: he started in 1980 as a junior sales representative at NCR Corp., which made computers, ATMs and point-of-sale systems. Hurd rose through the ranks, leading the company’s Teradata data-warehousing division before being named NCR president, COO, and finally CEO in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, he was recruited from NCR to become Hewlett-Packard’s president and CEO. Over the next five years, Hurd oversaw the layoff of 15,000 employees at the then-struggling company, as well as its 2008 acquisition of Ross Perot’s Electronic Data Systems (EDS). These and other strategic moves led the company to over five consecutive years of profit increases.\n\nIn 2010, Hurd joined Oracle as co-president, then served as co-CEO from 2014 until shortly before his passing. Hurd significantly grew not only Oracle’s cloud business, but also its employee base: hiring increased by 25% and included 1,300 students and recent graduates annually.\n\nSometimes called a “human calculator,” Hurd was known in the industry for his impressive memory and quick grasp of complicated information. “All of us will miss Mark’s keen mind and rare ability to analyze, simplify and solve problems quickly,” wrote Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison. “I will miss his kindness and sense of humor.”\n\nHurd was 62.\n\ncountries. We will always remember the 13 luminaries featured here who shaped our technology and our culture.\n\nSee also: Tech luminaries we lost in 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014"
