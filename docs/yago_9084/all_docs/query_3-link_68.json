        "text": "Mary Lee “Molly” Ash, 93, a longtime and well-loved Norwich resident, died peacefully at the UHS Chenango Memorial Hospital Senior Living Facility, on Thursday, May 13, 2021.\n\nMolly was born on November 16, 1927, in Syracuse, NY, to Frances (Holway) and Thomas Gibbons. She graduated from Most Holy Rosary in Syracuse before attending Syracuse University. She graduated with her bachelor’s degree in 1949. Molly married George Hotchkin in 1950. George died in 1971. In 1974, Molly married Earl Ash, who died in 1995.\n\nMolly lived on Fair Street in Norwich for 66 years. She was employed by the Norwich School District in the 1960s and then by Guernsey Memorial Library for 27 years until her retirement in 2015. Molly was a member of the Norwich Garden Club and a former board member of the Chenango Valley Home, where she became a resident in 2015. She was an avid reader, enjoyed having lunch with her friends, and solving crossword puzzles. Molly was a communicant of St. Paul’s Church in Norwich.\n\nMolly is survived by three sons, Gary “Hutch” (Barbara) Hotchkin, of Norwich, Michael (Barbara) Hotchkin, of Bainbridge Island, WA, and Eric (Catherine) Ash of Grosse Point Woods, MI; grandchildren, Keenan, Allyson, Cara, and George Hotchkin and Henry and Claire Ash; and great-grandchildren, Cillian, John Paul, and Fionn Hotchkin and Reyna Gough. In addition to her husbands, she was predeceased by her parents and by her brothers, John, Thomas, and Michael Gibbons.\n\nA private Mass of Christian Burial for Molly will be celebrated at the Church of St. Paul, where Rev. Ralph A. Bove, pastor, will officiate. Burial will take place at Mt. Hope Cemetery.
