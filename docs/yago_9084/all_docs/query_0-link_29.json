On his tombstone in Glen Elbe Cemetery, lot 4, concession 8, Yonge township, Leeds County, his dates are given as 1780-1843; and therefore on chronological grounds he must surely be the Henry Taplin b. 27 May 1780 at Newbury, Orange Co., Vermont, d. 6 Sept. 1843, son of Maj. John Taplin and Catherine Lovewell. Since he was in Canada before his wife was born in the U.S., their marriage must have occurred in Canada unless he made a return trip to the U.S.\n\nm. certainly by 1823, and by 1818 if they indeed were the parents of Lucinda (no. 23) above, 47 Melinda Huntley, b. 1801 in the U.S., d. 13 April 1874, aged 73 years, and buried in Glen Elbe Cemetery, lot 4, concession 8, Yonge township, Leeds County GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDPARENTS 70 ...

(not verified). If the dates of his birth and his parents' marriage have been recorded correctly as to the year (and in fact unless both are recorded incorrectly so as to make them appear closer together than they really were), he was clearly illegitimate. Accordingly, some accounts of this family have suppressed or falsified the date of his parents' marriage.\n\nHe m.

The rather evasive discussion of his marriage date in Hamilton Child, Gazetteer Of Washington County, Vermont, 1783-1899 [Syracuse, N.Y., 1889], was doubtless occasioned by its inconvenient proximity to the birth of his son (no. 92) above.\n\nm. 21 March 1748/9 at Southborough, Middlesex Co., Mass.

He appears as number 31 (Ludvig Ferdinand Alfred Tegner) in http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~skachr/tegner/isaach/pafg03.htm, but Gertrude is not mentioned there.\n\n16 -- Note by John Blythe Dobson:\n\nThere is a memorial to \"Charles Lee M.A. vicar d. 1911 & wife Sarah d. 1903\" in the parish church of Bilston, although we do not know whether they are actually buried there [\"Church Memorials, Bagnall-Bishop's Wood,\" The Staffordshire Encyclopedia, http://www.the-staffordshire-encyclopaedia.co.uk/view.php?id=50]. The name of \"Rev. Charles Lee, M.A., Vicar of Bilston,\" appears in a list of the Committees of Management for the Great Britain Mutual Life Assurance Society & Fire Insurance Co., of London and Birmingham, on one of the pages of advertising at the back of E. Edwards, Personal Recollections of Birmingham and Birmingham Men (Birmingham, 1877) [see http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18821/18821-h/18821-h.htm].\n\n21 -- Note by John Blythe Dobson:\n\nNancy (Cummings) Grey, d. 1888, and as wife or widow of John Grey, was buried in in South Gower Cemetery, South Gower, Grenville County [Ontario Genealogical Society Cemetery Index]. A corresponding death registration has not been found.\n\nNancy (Cummings) Gray is named as the mother of the bride in the following marriage record:\n\nLeeds & Grenville Marriage Registrations, no. ______ (indexed at Ancestry.com, but no image available) Groom: Robert Cook Birth Place: Ontario Age: 26 Father's Name: Joseph Cook Mother's Name: Elizabeth Cook Estimated birth year: abt 1845 Bride: Maria Gray Age: 25 Birth Place: On Father's Name: John Gray Mother's Name: Nancy Gray Marriage Date: 22 Mar 1871 Marriage Place: Leeds and Grenville\n\nThus, she may be identified as the Nancy Gray found in the household of her married daughter, Mary (Gray) Cook, in 1881 (see above).\n\n23 -- Note by John Blythe Dobson:\n\nIt seems almost certain that Lucinda Taplin (no. 23) was a daughter of Henry Taplin, of Augusta Tp., and his wife Melinda Huntley, for several reasons: (a) they seem to have been the only couple in the area old enough to have been her parents; (b) a witness at Lucinda's wedding was Melinda Taplin (possibly her mother, or else a sister with the same name as the mother); (c) Lucinda named a son Henry. If this connection can be established, there would be additional American ancestry, as shown above.\n\nBesides her presumed mother Melinda (Huntley) Taplin, there was a Melinda Taplin of the right age to her sister, thus probably accounting for the Melinda Taplin who appeared as a witness at her wedding. This Melinda Taplin has not yet been found in documentary sources, but is mentioned, probably during her lifetime, as the wife of Coleman Lewis, of Addison, Elizabethtown Tp., Leeds Co., in T.W.H. Leavitt, History of Leeds and Grenville, Ontario [Brockville, Ontario, 1879], p. 146 (facsimile edition available online at http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=876).\n\n46 -- Note by John Blythe Dobson:\n\nI have found definite proof of the identification of Henry Taplin of Augusta Township, U.C., with the man from Newbury, Orange Co., Vermont. A biographical sketch of a grandson, Mortimer Mason Taplin, in the National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, 16:420-21, reads, in part:\n\n\"Taplin, Mortimer Mason, physician and surgeon, was born at Addison, Ontario, Can., June 25, 1868, son of Rufus and Lucy (Stowell) Taplin. His first American ancestor was Mansfield Taplin, a native of England, who settled in Charlestown, Mass., and died there in 1734, and the line of descent is through his son, Col. John Taplin, who married Hepsibah Brigham; their son John, who married Catherine Lovewell; their son Henry, who was a native of Montpelier, Vt., [who] married Melinda Huntly, and their son Rufus, the father of Dr. Taplin.\"\n\nRufus and Lucy (Stowell) Taplin are buried with his parents in Glen Elbe Cemetery, lot 4, concession 8, Yonge township, Leeds County, confirming the stated relationship.\n\nMortimer Mason Taplin was himself the father of George Vorce Taplin (1910-1979), a pioneer in the field of Nuclear Medicine. A sketch of the latter published in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 16 (1975): 504-7 ( http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/16/6/504.pdf), is vague as to its subject's parentage connection and appears to muddle the family history, but the connection is established in a well-informed posting to RootsWeb's Taplin Family Genealogy Forum at http://genforum.genealogy.com/taplin/messages/119.html. An obituary of George V. Taplin appears in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 21 (1980): 174-5 ( http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/21/2/174.pdf), but it has no genealogical content.\n\n47 -- Note by John Blythe Dobson:\n\nA promising candidate for her father appears in Ivy Huntley Horn, \"John Huntley of Lyme, Connecticutt [sic] and his descendants\" (typescript, Herndon, Virginia, 1985), pp. 41-42, available in facsimile at Ancestry.com, which rarely cites its sources explicitly yet seems to be based (for the American portions at least) on sound research and authentic tradition, and adds substantially to the Huntley genealogy serialized in NEHGR in the late 1940s (see below for full citation). Zadock Smith Huntley, who lived at various times in at least two of the townships now comprised in Leeds County, was certainly of the right age to have been Melinda's father. A search of all surviving early census records and asssessment rolls (for links to images and transcriptions see http://www.rootsweb.com/~onleedsg/genealog.htm and http://www.geneofun.on.ca/db.php?database=ogwcensus&template=ogwcensus-coLEE.html&search=YRCODE&find=LEEpre1851), while it has found only two references to Zadock himself, has at least revealed no other Huntley family in Elizabethtown, and only one other prospect in an adjacent township (an Ezra Huntley is found in the 1819 census of Yonge Township, with a household consisting of 2 males and 1 female). (Database searches for Huntleys in this area are to some extent hampered by the unfortunate coincidence that Huntley is a local placename.) Thus, a circumstantial case can be made that she was likely the daughter of:\n\nno. 94. Zadock Smith Huntley (Horn persistently calls him \"Zodock\" although subsequent authors have disregarded this ideosyncrasy), b. 8 Feb. 1761 at Lyme, Conn. (confirmed by Barbour Collection), d. 8 Aug. 1846 in Clayton Tp., Jefferson Co., N.Y. (date confirmed by Revolutionary War pension record, at Ancestry.com). He was of Lyme in his youth, and participated in the defeat of Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781. He afterwards lived at various locations in New York, being enumerated with a woman, presumably a first wife, at Balls Town, Saratoga or Albany Co., at the taking of the 1790 census. Horn notes that he must have been married prior to his 1798 marriage to Elizabeth Balis, for when he was enumerated at Palatine, Montgomery Co., New York, in the 1800 census, he already had five daughters and one son. He has not been found in the U.S. 1810 census. According to Horne he was subsequently of Elizabethtown Tp. and of Lansdowne Tp. (both now in Leeds County), Upper Canada, but no dates are mentioned. Two daughters, Martha and Anna, are named in an online Huntley genealogy at http://www.irodgers.net/fam.his.HUNTLEY.htm, but no source is cited. Also, several web sources, including http://home.insightbb.com/~herbpaul/herb/Kyes0001.htm, distinctly state that Wait Huntley, wife of John Kyes, was a daughter of Zadock Huntley and Elizabeth Balis, and this seems to be borne out by the fact that they had a son with the exceedingly rare name of Zadock. We are also inclined to believe these statements because a group of marriages for four Huntley women, including three with these names, not only form a coherent sequence chronologically and geographically, but have overlaps in the names of the witnesses:\n\n1819. May 25th. Augustus Plumb, of Yonge, and Ann Huntly, of Elizabethtown, banns, witnesses Harvey Plumb, Jeremiah Mallory. 1820. Feb. 15th. Festus Plumb and Martha Huntly, both of Yonge, banns, witnesses Augustus Plumb, Henry Guild. 1830. May 19th. John Kyes [not a spelling error] and Weight [Wait] Huntley, both of Lansdowne, banns, witnesses Augustus Plumb, Abner Landon. 1832. Jan. 11th. Allan Brown, of Leeds, and Betsy Ann Huntley, of Lansdowne, banns, witnesses Jacob Smith, Joseph S. Landon.\n\nSee \"A Record of Marriages solemnized by William Smart, Minister of the Presbyterian Congregation, Brockville, Elizabethtown, Upper Canada,\" Ontario Historical Society Papers and Records 5 (1904): 187-236 (transcribed at http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/wsmart.htm).\n\nFurther confirmation that these persons were all of one family comes from the 1839 census of Leeds & Lansdowne townships, Front portion, in which the following entries occur together in a continuous block:\n\nheads men women m.ch. f.ch. total ---------------------------------------------- Landon, Abner 1 2 3 2 8 Plumb, Festus 1 2 2 3 8 Plumb, Augustus 1 -- -- -- 1 Huntley, Zeodac* 1 1 -- -- 2 Keyes, John 1 1 3 1 6 Keyes, Henry 1 1 4 -- 6 Shipman, David 1 1 1 3 6 Keyes, Ephriam 2 1 2 2 7 Landon, Jesse 1 2 2 1 6 -----\n\n* corrected from \"Leodac\" in the transcription published at http://ontariocensus.rootsweb.com/transcripts/8250-1.html\n\nZadock Huntley is not listed in the 1840 census, but appears as \"Jedoch Huntley\" in that of 1841, his household again containing only one man and one woman. He is not listed in the 1845 census, and possibly had already retured by then to the U.S., where he is said to have died.\n\nMartha Huntley, like her possible sister Melinda, was evidently born in the U.S., for \"Festus and Martha (Huntley) Plumb, natives of the United States, who moved to Canada in early life\" are mentioned in a biographical sketch of a son, Festus N. Plumb, in History of the St. Croix Valley [Wisconsin] (1909), transcribed at http://stcroixbios.tripod.com/bios/id17.html. Many undocumented web sources assert that she was born 18 Jan. 1798 in New York State, which if true would make her a daughter of her father's first marriage.\n\nZadock Smith Huntley m. [2] 8 Oct. 1798 at Stephenstown, N.Y.,\n\nno. 95. Elizabeth Balis, of Clayton, who survived him.\n\nIf this connection could be proved, there would then be further readily-traceable ancestry, starting with:\n\nno. 188. Jonathan Huntley, b. 9 March 1727/8, probably at Lyme. For further ancestry see Alice P. Huntley, \"John Huntley and some of his descendants,\" pt. __, NEHGR 101 (1947): 141-52, at p. 146. He married 22 August 1754 at Lyme,\n\nno. 189. Sarah Stephens Smith, b. 19 Sept. 1733 at Lyme.\n\n184 -- Note by John Blythe Dobson:\n\nAlthough various web sources state that John Taplin was \"baptized\" 27 Oct. 1727 at Charlestown, it seems likely this should refer to a record of *birth*.\n\n368 -- Note by John Blythe Dobson:\n\nDespite mention of him in various web sources, I was bothered by his absence from the lengthy account of the Taplin family in Hamilton Child, Gazetteer Of Washington County, Vermont, 1783-1899 [Syracuse, 1889], 353-75 ( http://www.rootsweb.com/~vermont/WashCoTownMontpelier4.html). However, his name is supported by the account in NCAB cited above, and as his son John named a son Mansfield, and the name is not found among the ancestry of John's wife, there seems to be no real reason to doubt it. Various web sources assert that Mansfield Taplin and wife Mary Johnson had the following children baptized at Charlestown, Mass.:\n\nAnnie Taplin, b. 7 Feb. 1725. John Taplin, \"baptized\" (i.e. born?) 27 Oct. 1727.\n\nHowever, I do not have access to a copy of the Charlestown VR to verify this.\n\nEVIDENCES\n\nprovided by John Blythe Dobson\n\nManitoba Birth Registrations, no. 1895-12117840\n\n[from online database at http://web2.gov.mb.ca/cca/vital/Query.php; original record not checked]\n\nChild: Helen Lane Camp....

It is quite fitting that, when a post office was set up here, his name was given to the settlement. The name covers a wide area, between Lord's Mills on the west, Maynard to the south, and Glenmore on the north. The Nation River bisects it, providing energy for early mills, but today it is a sluggish stream, draining or flooding the farms, and providing good hunting for muskrats.\"\n\nFrom p. 227: \"Canada Post records state that the Charleville post office was established April 1, 1853, with postmaster Charles Lane.

Col. John TAPLIN, resided in Marlboro until about 1764, when he removed to Newbury, Vt., and was one of the first settlers of that town. \"He was one of the most noted men of his times, had been a colonel in the British American army under Gen. AMHERST, and actively engaged with ROGERS, PUTNAM, STARK, and other distinguished American officers in reducing the fortresses of the French on Lake Champlain, and fighting their red allies then prowling through the entire wilderness territory of Vermont.\" Col. John TAPLIN was the chief judge of the first court ever held within the territory now called Orange county. His court was held in the New York county of Gloucester, and he received his commission from King George III., from the governor of New York, March 17, 1770, and again April 10, 1772. His first term of court was held at Kingsland, as appears upon the original records of the courts held in Kingsland, which are preserved in the county clerk's office at Chelsea. Kingsland, now Washington, was made the county seat, although there was not a house nor an inhabitant within its limits. A village, or, as our western people would say in these days, a city, was plotted upon paper, near its center, but it has never yet been built.\n\nJudge TAPLIN probably held his last court in Kingsland on Tuesday, May 25, 1773, when he adjourned to meet in Newbury. The last record of any court at either Kingsland or Newbury, held by judge TAPLIN, commonly called Col. TAPLIN, was in Newbury, February 25, 1774. Judge TAPLIN was not a lawyer. He probably resided at Newbury while he was judge, but later he removed to Corinth, of which town he was an original proprietor. His sympathies were undoubtedly with the colonies in their efforts to throw off the British yoke, for July 15, 1775, he wrote a letter from Newbury to Peter V. B. LIVINGSTON, Esq., president of the Provincial Congress at the city of New York, in which he uses these words: \"The country seems to be very well united, and firm to one another, and also in the cause of liberty; and I make no doubt but they will cheerfully join in whatever measures and directions the honorable Congress may point out from time to time.\" But D. P. THOMPSON, in his history of Montpelier, says that \"on the opening of the Revolution, Colonel TAPLIN, declining to take sides against the king who had distinguished him, retired during the war into Canada, leaving his son, John TAPLIN, Jr., on the paternal property in Corinth, Vermont.\" Col. TAPLIN married Hepsiba BRIGHAM, presumably in the year 1746, as we are informed by Mrs. H. N. TAPLIN, widow of his grandson now aged eighty-two years, residing in Montpelier, that his wife (Hepsiba BRIGHAM) was but fifteen years old when her first son was born, or when she was married. As she was born in 1731, and fifteen when she was married, that event must have occurred in 1746. She died December 27, 1815. Col. John TAPLIN died November 9, 1803. We are unable to gain any information of his birth or age. Their children were John, Jr., born July 14, 1848 [sic? -- recte 1748], Johnson, Brigham, Elisha, Mansfield, William, Nathan, Gouldsburn, Polly, and Hepsa.\n\nJohn TAPLIN, Jr., was the first high sheriff under his father in Gloucester county, Vt., removed to Corinth with his father, and from there came to Berlin in 1787, and settled near the mouth of Dog river. He was the first representative of Berlin, and the first justice of the peace. When twenty years old he married Catherine LOVEWELL, of Newbury, who was born July 10, 1748, and died July 16, 1794. She was the mother of twelve children, viz.: Caty (Catherine), born December 30, 1770 ; Augustus, born June 30, 1773; Susan, born April 28, 1775; John, born July 31, 1777; Henry, born May 27, 1780; Robert, born April 24, 1782; Ira, born June 14, 1784; Hannah, born May 21, 1786; Walter, born May 14, 1788; Chittenden, born June 14, 1789; Thomas Chittenden, born April 30, 1792; and William, born June 16, 1794. He married his second wife, Lydia GOVE, says THOMPSON, some time in the year 1795, who bore him nine children more, namely, Ebenezer, born March 2, 1796; Hazen, born April 5, 1797; Edward Langdon, born May 5, 1798; Harriet, born September 2, 1799; Horatio Nelson, born April 15, 1801; Sidney Smith, born February 5, 1803; Guy Carlton, born April 29, 1804; John Adams, born October 4, 1805; and Susan, born May 30, 1807. Only the last named of this large family is now living. H.N. TAPLIN, son of H.N., and George E. TAPLIN are the only male descendants of this branch of the TAPLIN family now residing in Montpelier.\n\nSee http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/BRIGHAM/2004-12/1103861563 for pertinent extracts from a Brigham genealogy.\n\nHistory of Corinth, Vermont, 1764-1964, compiled and edited by Town of Corinth History Committee [West Topsham, Vermont, 1964]\n\nextracts published at http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/VTORANGE/2004-12/1104009211\n\np. 463.\n\nCOL.
