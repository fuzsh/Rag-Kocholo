        "text": "When travelling through Germany you’ll likely visit Berlin at some point, if you do consider making an overnight trip to Dresden which is the capital of the state of Saxony and known for the Bruhl’s Terrace and its Old Town. Dresden was the home of many Saxon Kings in the past, with many beautiful and historical buildings displaying it’s rich cultural heritage. However, during World War II up to 75% of the historical center was damaged or ruined due to the Allied forces bombing killing more than 30,000 people. Much of the historical center is now restored to its former glory with the reconstructed Frauenkirche, in the town’s center, the most famous landmark.\n\nDresden is also a convenient stop if travelling between Berlin and Prague with a relatively short train ride to Dresden from Berlin of only two hours. If you are travelling by ‘railpass’, a good idea is to depart Prague or Berlin early, spend the day exploring Dresden, and continue on in the same day to your destination. There are lockers at the train station where you can store your luggage for a few Euros during the day.\n\nThe picturesque Elbe Valley and the Elbe River that run through Dresden used to be on the UNESCO World Heritage List, until the government decided to build a four-lane highway through it. UNESCO then removed this title from it meaning it's one of only two places every to be 'dethroned' from the Heritage list which makes an interesting factoid! Finally, we would visit the VW ‘Transparent factory’ where they hand make (there are only three robots in the whole factory) the top of the range Phaeton. The factory is constructed primarily of glass, hence transparency. There are tours in English that only cost €5!"
