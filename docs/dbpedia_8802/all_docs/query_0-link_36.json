        "text": "Dresden is the capital of Saxony – one of the German states, which is mostly identical to the former kingdom of Saxony and therefore a city with a long and rich history spanning more than 800 years. Located at the banks of river Elbe Dresden is famous for its art galleries with world-class paintings, the Semper Opera house and multiple famous buildings like the rebuilt Frauenkirche (Church of our Lady) which is one of the symbols of German reunification in 1989/90.\n\nHowever, Dresden is not only a city of art, music and architecture, but also a city of science. It is home to the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, which has been a member of the Helmholtz Association since 2011 and conducts research in the fields of energy, health and matter, and to the Technical University (TU Dresden), which is currently one of Germany’s 11 universities of excellence. In addition to the university, Dresden is home to numerous non-university research institutes belonging to the Max Planck, Leibniz or Fraunhofer Societies. Moreover, Dresden is an inspiring place for numerous small start-up companies as well as larger technology companies, making Dresden an optimal location for a GLS event.\n\nGLS-16 is hosted by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and the Technische Universität Dresden. It follows up the earlier GLS conferences in Columbus (1992), Cambridge (1995), Kanazawa (1997), Deft (1999), Melbourne (2001), Vancouver (2003), Strasbourg (2005), New Delhi (2007), Montreal (2009), Braga (2011), Seoul (2013), New York (2015), Brussels (2017), Guilin (2019), and Ottawa (2022)."
