        "text": "The earliest traces of settlement in today's city date back to 7,500 BC. Throughout the centuries, the city belonged to Saxony and Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe city was called the treasure house or the Florence of the North because of the beautiful city centre built in the Baroque and Rococo style. Unfortunately, significant part of it was destroyed in the bombing of the city. After the war, during restorations, the rebuilt Frauenkirche (The Church of Our Lady) became an international symbol of reconciliation. Most of the city has returned to its pre-war splendor.\n\nSince the reunification of Germany in 1990, Dresden has become a centre of culture, education, politics and economics.\n\nIt is very easy to get to Dresden by car as the city is located along the E40 highway. However, itâs better to use alternative means of transport during rush hour in the city centre.\n\nIn Dresden, there is an integrated system of trams, buses and trains. Night connections are available but might be not very frequent.\n\nThe fastest type of transport for short and medium distances is bicycles. City has designated bicycle lanes and some are separated from motorised traffic. There even are bicycle taxis that mainly move around the centre of the old town.\n\nFrauenkirche was originally built as a Roman Catholic, but became a Protestant church during the reformation. The temple is considered to be a perfect example of Protestant architecture and has one of the largest domes in Europe. It is also worth paying attention to the Baroque buildings surrounding the Neumarkt square.\n\nThe New Synagogue was built on the site of the former Semper Synagogue, which was destroyed in 1938 during the Crystal Night. The walls surrounding the New Synagogue are the remains of the original synagogue.\n\nDiscover Zwinger Palace, one of the best-known baroque palaces in Germany. In the palace you can admire the second largest porcelain collections in the world, a collections of scientific instruments, and numerous clocks. There is also a zoological museum, an exhibition about animals in art and the Art Gallery.\n\nThe Great Garden is a beautiful place to spend some time outdoors. Here you can enjoy picturesque alleys, Baroque sculptures and botanical garden. The park also has a small palace, one of the earliest examples of Baroque architecture in Germany. It is also worth going over the banks of the Elbe where residents of the city often organise barbecues or play sports.\n\nDiscover Schwebebahn, the oldest suspended railway in the world. The line is 274 metres long and there is a viewpoint at the upper station.\n\nKunsthofpassage is the hidden treasure of the city, a passage in the centre of Neustadt, where there are small shops, cafes and bars."
