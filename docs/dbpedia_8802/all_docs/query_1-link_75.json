        "text": "The Kingdom of Saxony is a gargantuan, efficient nation, ruled by King Heinrich Siegfried Kilian Alexander with an even hand, and remarkable for its compulsory military service. The hard-working population of 23.831 billion Saxons are free to succeed or fail in life on their own merits; the successful tend to enjoy an opulent (but moralistic) lifestyle, while the failures can be seen crowding out most jails.\n\nThe medium-sized, pro-business government juggles the competing demands of Spirituality, Defense, and Industry. It meets to discuss matters of state in the capital city of Dresden. Citizens pay a flat income tax of 20.3%.\n\nThe very strong Saxon economy, worth a remarkable 1,263 trillion thalers a year, is led by the Uranium Mining industry, with major contributions from Book Publishing, Pizza Delivery, and Beef-Based Agriculture. Average income is 53,008 thalers, but there is a significant disparity between incomes, with the richest 10% of citizens earning 161,930 per year while the poor average 13,449, a ratio of 12.0 to 1.\n\nSaxony has designated Dresden as its capital city, King Heinrich Siegfried Kilian Alexander has just been declared ruler of Saxony in an international press conference, Roman Catholicism has been named as Saxony's national religion, and abortion is only legal in unusual circumstances. Crime is a problem, with the police force struggling against a lack of funding and a high mortality rate. Saxony's national animal is the lion and its national religion is Roman Catholicism."
