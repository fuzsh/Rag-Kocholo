        "text": "(This is a stub to revised and edited by Kristaux)\n\nThe Kingdom of Saxony is a nation that is in Northern-Germany and North-Holland. It was established by KristauxSoftQT on July 3rd 2021.\n\nGeography\n\nThe capital town is landlocked in the region of Lower-Saxony, where it consists of a forested meadow with little elevation. The next largest town, Waddenzee, is in North Holland and the West-Frisian islands and holds territory in the Wadden Sea and parts of the Netherlands. It also has some land in Switzerland in the town of Sion, and has several protectorates in South Africa and Antarctica. For more information on this, visit the Saxonic Empire page.\n\nPolitical System\n\nThe Capital is Nuremberg, but the nation is de-centralised, and Waddenzee is more like a vassal and has political autonomous function, but remains a town within the nation. Saxony is a Kingdom, and is currently part of the German Confederacy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Union of Waddenzee and Nuremberg\n\nOn the 24th of August, 2021, the Duke of Waddenzee agreed to join the nation if the King converted to Shrekism, which he did. The construction for a temple in Nuremberg was promised.\n\nThe Protectorates\n\nThroughout the start of September, 2021, Saxony gained several protectorate-vassals. One in South Africa and two in Antarctica- the rump of these states being the South-Pole.\n\nTowns\n\n."
