        "text": "Why do I need to fast before a test?\n\nIf you are having a medical test, your doctor may ask you to fast. For some tests, fasting beforehand gives a more accurate result. For other tests, you need to fast for safety reasons. Ask your doctor how to prepare for your test.\n\nWhat can I eat and drink while I'm fasting?\n\nYou can’t eat or drink anything. You can't drink fruit juice, cordial, soft drink, coffee, tea or milk, and you can't eat or suck on lollies or chewing gum. Ask your doctor if you can drink water before your test.\n\nWhich tests do I need to fast for?\n\nBlood tests\n\nYou will usually have a fasting blood test in the morning after you have fasted for 10 to 12 hours (no less than 8 hours and no more than 16 hours).\n\nTests under anaesthetic\n\nIf you are having sedation or a general anaesthetic for a test, you will need to fast beforehand. This lowers your risk of serious complications. Your anaesthetist will tell you when to stop eating and drinking.\n\nAdults can usually have small amounts of clear fluids up to 2 hours before. Your anaesthetist will tell you when to stop eating and drinking.\n\nClear fluids include water, fruit juice without pulp, clear cordial and black tea and coffee. You can’t have jelly or milk.\n\nThere are different recommendations for babies and children. Ask your anaesthetist what and when your child can drink.\n\nColonoscopy\n\nFasting before a colonoscopy is important because:\n\nyou will be sedated\n\nfasting helps clear out your bowel so your doctor can examine you properly\n\nOn the day before a colonoscopy, you will need to drink at least 3 litres of clear fluids. You won’t be allowed to eat food. Before the procedure, you will take a medicine to empty your bowel. You will need to fast for at least 2 hours before the procedure.\n\nIf you have diabetes, you may need to be monitored in hospital for this process. Ask your doctor what to drink and if you should take your medicines.\n\nGastroscopy\n\nYou must not eat or drink (including water) for 6 hours before a gastroscopy. This gives your doctor a clear view to examine your stomach and intestine and lowers your risk of complications from sedation. Your doctor will tell you what time to start fasting.\n\nCan I take my medicines when I'm fasting?\n\nKeep taking your medicines as usual before a test, unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. Some medicines need to be stopped, so check with your doctor if you usually take medicines. Be sure to tell your doctor everything you are taking, including over-the-counter and complementary medicines.\n\nCan I fast if I have diabetes?\n\nFasting with diabetes can cause complications. If you have diabetes and you need to fast for a test, talk to your doctor beforehand. Ask ahead for written instructions about what to do if you have a hypoglycaemic episode (a ‘hypo’) while you're fasting.\n\nSome recommendations are:\n\nCheck your blood sugar every hour, or more often if your level is too high or too low.\n\nYou may need to reduce your insulin dose or skip oral medicines.\n\nDrink water when you are allowed to.\n\nYou may need to drink clear fluids containing sugar if your blood sugar is low.\n\nLook out for signs of a 'hypo' and seek medical help immediately if your blood sugar doesn’t improve.\n\nAvoid driving. Contact your doctor if you have any concerns or if you have to break your fast."
