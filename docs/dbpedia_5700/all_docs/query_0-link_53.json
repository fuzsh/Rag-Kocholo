        "text": "WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - Louisiana state officials want a lawsuit challenging the state’s new Ten Commandments in classrooms law thrown out.\n\n“The lawsuit is premature,” said Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.\n\nSeveral civil rights groups filed the lawsuit after the law was signed by Governor Jeff Landry (R) in June. It requires posters of the Ten Commandments to be hung in every Louisiana public school classroom.\n\nBut Murrill said that because the law does not go into effect until January 1st, the plaintiffs cannot prove injury.\n\n“They certainly can’t allege that they have seen any display of the Ten Commandments that violates their constitutional rights. No defendant has actually posted the Ten Commandments on a classroom wall, because this lawsuit is all based on hypothetical facts. The court can’t decide the case yet,” she said.\n\nOne of the parties who filed the lawsuit is the Louisiana American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing nine families in the case. The group’s executive director Alana Odoms said her organization is asking the court to bring a preliminary injunction to prevent the law from taking effect.\n\n“Families must send their kids to school. So therefore kids become what’s called a captive audience. And they’re very, they’re vulnerable population. And so we can’t require children to be in school and then also subject them to religious indoctrination,” said Odoms.\n\nShe also said some families do not think the school is the right place to favor one religion over another.\n\n“What this says to families is that we have a Christian ideology in the state of Louisiana,” said Odoms.\n\nGovernor Landry also spoke out this week and said the majority gets to rule in a Democracy and told children or families that do not want to look at the Ten Commandments to look away.\n\n“What I would say to those parents is that if, if, if those pollsters in school and they find them so vulgar to tell a child not to look at it,” he said.\n\nIn response to the request for dismissal, the Louisiana ACLU issued a statement on Thursday that said, “We are committed to ensuring that the state does not force its religious beliefs on Louisiana families. This law is a blatant attempt to circumvent parents’ right to determine their children’s upbringing—whether it be religious or nonreligious. This right is protected by the First Amendment, and we will stand firm in this fight.”"
