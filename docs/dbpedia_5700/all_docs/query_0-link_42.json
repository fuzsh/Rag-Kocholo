        "text": "Transcript\n\n[An archival newspaper article is shown on screen with the title “They Don’t Want the Chinese.”]\n\nBetween 1923 and 1947, Canada locked its doors to most Chinese immigrants with the bitter embrace of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\n[An archival picture of an immigration document depicting a Chinese child named Mary Quan.]\n\nChinese people living in Canada, even those born here, were required by law to register with the government. They had to carry Chinese Immigration Certificates.\n\n[An archival picture of a newspaper shown on screen with the title “Chinese Must be Registered”.]\n\nIt was an era marked by discrimination, shattered dreams, and the stifling of hope—a tragic chapter in Canadian history.\n\n[Text slide on screen. Archival image of men in a street.]\n\nExclusion of Chinese Immigrants (1923-1947)\n\nNational Historic Event\n\n[Text slide on screen. Same image: an archival image of men in a street, but the text overtop changes.]\n\nCommemorative plaque unveiling\n\nSenate of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario June 23, 2023\n\n[Text slide on screen. Same image: an archival image of men in a street, but the text overtop changes.]\n\nPresented by\n\nThe Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada and Parks Canada\n\n[Transitions to Lloyd Wong, Professor of Sociology, University of Calgary, standing next to commemorative plaque, speaking to the camera.]\n\n(LLOYD WONG, Professor of Sociology, University of Calgary)\n\nAs a third generation Canadian, the exclusionary period was very much part of my family history.\n\n[Transitions to a number of black and white archival photos, fading in and out, of Lloyd Wong’s family.]\n\nOn my father’s side, my grandparents came to Calgary in Canada in the early 1900s and they started a small retail business and started a family.\n\n[Archival black and white photo relating to Lloyd Wong’s father’s family is shown on screen, which fades back to Lloyd speaking in front of the camera.]\n\nMy father was born in 1918, and five years later, as a five-year-old, the Exclusion Act was implemented, and my grandparents had to register him as a Chinese person living in Canada.\n\n[Archival black and white photo of Lloyd Wong’s mother and her friends and siblings in 1931, which fades back to Lloyd speaking in front of the camera.]\n\nMy mother was born in 1923, the same year as the introduction of the Exclusion Act. And about three or four years later, my mother left with my grandmother and other siblings to go back to China. For my grandmother it was going back, but for my mother it was going to China as an immigrant from Canada.\n\n[An archival newspaper article is shown on screen with the title “Canada to Repeal Chinese Exclusion”.]\n\nThe resilience of the Chinese Canadian community ultimately prevailed, leading to the repeal of this unjust law in 1947.\n\n[Archival black and white photos fading in and out of Lloyd Wong’s mother’s family and her siblings.]\n\n(LLOYD WONG)\n\nWhen they left, they had no idea when they were going to come back, and so eventually almost 2 decades later, with the repeal of the Exclusion Act, they came in 1949.\n\n[Fades to side-by-side archival photographs of Lloyd Wong’s mother and father, first as a young couple with family, then older in age with family, which fades back to Lloyd Wong speaking in front of the camera.]\n\nRoughly 1950, my mother and father met, and so here I am talking to you seven decades later. That’s the personal meaning that this Exclusion Act has for me.\n\n[Text slide on screen.]\n\nOn June 23, 2023, a commemorative plaque was unveiled in the Senate of Canada as part of an event to mark the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\n[Transitions to Teresa Woo-Paw, Founding Board Chair of the Action! Chinese Canadians Together Foundation, standing next to commemorative plaque, speaking to the camera. Fades to several archival photos of Chinese-Canadians.]\n\n(TERESA WOO-PAW, Founding Board Chair, Action! Chinese Canadians Together Foundation)\n\nFor the Chinese community, it is an opportunity for us to learn, to reflect, about the experience of our ancestors, and to understand the impact of the Act on the social integration and development of the community.\n\n[Transitions into an archival photo of Chinese-Canadians, which fades into several photographs of the plaque being unveiled in the Senate Chamber.]\n\nToday, it’s about the Government of Canada acknowledging these challenging, darker side of our Canadian history. Acknowledging not only the Act happened, but also the social consequences of the Act.\n\n[Transitions back to Teresa Woo-Paw speaking to the camera. This fades into a photo of a group of people beside the unveiled commemorative plaque including Lloyd Wong, Teresa Woo-Paw, then a photo of ballet dancers in the Senate Hall, then a photo of performers dressed up in costumes in the Senate Chamber.]\n\nWe have people from across the country gathering in the Senate Chamber to remember and recognize those who have contributed to the building of Canada, yet never recognized, and now we have an active commemoration and through artistic expressions today that we get to tell their stories.\n\n[Transitions back to Lloyd Wong speaking to the camera.]\n\nI don’t want Canadians to forget about this time period, and I want newer Canadians and those who don’t know about it to be educated about it. So that to me is the most important thing.\n\n[Text slide on screen.]\n\nSince its creation in 1919, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada (HSMBC) has played a leading role in identifying the important stories that have shaped our country.\n\n[Text slide on screen.]\n\nParks Canada supports the HSMBC in the commemoration of persons, places and events of national historic significance.\n\nLearn more about the history of Canada: parks.canada.ca/culture\n\n[Text slide on screen.]\n\nStill photos courtesy of:\n\nNational Film Board of Canada Library and Archives Canada\n\nVancouver Public Library Lloyd Wong\n\nVision by David\n\n[Music continues]\n\nHSMBC wordmark\n\nCanada wordmark"
