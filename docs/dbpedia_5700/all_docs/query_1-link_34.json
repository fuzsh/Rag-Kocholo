        "text": "I have had this app for the past 4 and I am obsessed with it like I was when I first got it. Over the course of time Iâve had to get new phones and thankfully! All my photos were saved in the app, that it never crossed my mind I would need to save them separately, until nowâ¦ â¹ï¸. In the past, Iâve backed-up the app and I had no issues with losing photos but this time around I did a final backup and set up my new iPhone. I had to redownload the app (which I canât remember if it was always like that or if the set up process for a new phone is different now??), which is fine I assumed all data would be saved but unfortunately when I opened the app all my photos were gone ðð¥º. I was able to recover some that were sent to friends but overall majority of my photos have been lost, I didnât have the huji photos automatically save onto my iPhone, since it would take up more space and I liked how I could keep it separate. A suggestion, if you could create some kind of way to make an account that would safely store/archive any photos taken, that way when transitioning or repairing a broke phone itâs not a total loss. I will automatically be saving hujifilm photos to my actual photo album. RIP to my past captured memories ð¥º. Still love the app and canât wait to capture new memories.\n\nIâve been using this app for 5 years. I run all of the pictures from my camera roll through this app before sharing with family and friends. The fact that this date stamps the pictures makes it easier to be in the moment, snap a photo here and there, and then dump lots of pictures at once to socials where my family can see what Iâve been up to without being confused about when I took trips or did stuff. I recommend it to everyone I know, I have put so many friends and family on this app, and I constantly get compliments on the way the filter makes each of the pictures have a little something extra special.\n\nMy ONLY qualm is that I donât have the option to date stamp pictures without also having the huji filter on them as well. As much as I love it, it became prevalent when I got back from Alaska with photos of the northern lights but after running them through the Huji filter you can barely see the colors dancing in the sky. I want the date stamp on those original photos without the huji filter on it affecting the lighting\n\nInstead of searching for a replacement app i figured I could ask the developers to adjust the capabilities for users ð I donât want to use a new application, I want to keep using yours. Please consider making the huji filter over photos an on/off option so i can date stamp pictures without the filter when needed!! Thank you in advance â¥ï¸\n\ni LOVEEE huji Iâve first downloaded it last summer and iâve been using it nonstop ever since I probably have over 3000 pictures by now, which leads me to a point Iâm worried about, i have experienced before the sudden loss of all data on my phone it basically fell into water and it didnât work again, luckily i had backed it up into my computer a few months back before the accident but still i lost a pretty big amount of pictures from my camera roll, now that was before I downloaded huji, but now that i did I canât help but feel scared that this might happen again and all 3000+ pictures on huji will be long gone, what i mean is i really hope the app developers can make an update where you can save the pictures into the app with some kind of account(usernames and stuff) so that even if you delete the app or somehow lose all the data they can still be safe and there , and i know i can save everything into my camera roll but for me thatâs not convenient because there is A LOTT pictures in there so i really canât, but i really hope they can make an option like that so the pictures will always be saved sort of my the memories section of snap chat"
