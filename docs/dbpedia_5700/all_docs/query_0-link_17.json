Being antiracist results from a conscious decision to make frequent, consistent, equitable choices daily. These choices require ongoing self-awareness and self-reflection as we move through life. In the absence of making antiracist choices, we (un)consciously uphold aspects of white supremacy, white-dominant culture, and unequal institutions and society. Being racist or antiracist is not about who you are; it is about what you do.",

        "text": "Let's Talk\n\nThe Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University contends that racist policies fuel racist beliefs and behaviors and keep us divided in society.\n\nBy yourself, divide two pieces of paper into 4 sections. Write the following categories, one in each section, on the page: Education, Healthcare Treatment, Neighborhoods/Housing, Criminal Justice. Do this for both pages.\n\nOn the first sheet, jot down 2-3 racial groups of people you think get the best service/experience/outcomes in America for each category. You can repeat groups.\n\nOn the second sheet, jot down 2-3 racial groups of people you think get the worst service/experience/outcomes in America for each category. You can repeat groups.\n\nNow, with a partner discuss what policies, old and newer, you believe might account for these groups’ experiences.\n\nWith your partner, return to each racial group you’ve listed, one at a time. Search the internet, look up the racial group, one of the four categories, and the word “policy” (limit your search to U.S. policies and seek out fact-based sources). Browse through the results for things that strike you.\n\nDiscuss with your partner:\n\nWas it easy or difficult to find useful information on policies in these categories having to do with race? Why do you think that was?\n\nFor those racial groups that you thought had the best service/experience/outcomes, were you able to identify specific policies that helped them? Why yes? Or why not?\n\nHow do you think policies can be hidden or difficult to see in operation?\n\nWhat did you discover that was new to you?\n\nWere you wrong about anything you thought? How did you find out?\n\nWas there anything uncomfortable about this exercise? Why yes? Or why not?\n\nHow can our learning about policies, racial groups, and outcomes help support anti-racism efforts?\n\nLet's Act\n\nWatch these two videos on Implicit Bias:\n\nHow can you hang out authentically with folks of some common interest, across racial lines?\n\nEDUCATORS: Consider your current classroom or academic space. What one small shift can you do to strive to be more antiracist?\n\nVisit the “Antiracism and America” web series developed by American University’s Antiracist Research and Policy Center and The Guardian news outlet.\n\nPick a story to read. As you reflect on the story, think about what you learned that was new, how the story made you feel, how race shaped the experience of the storyteller and your response. You may choose to process this mentally, with a friend or in writing."
