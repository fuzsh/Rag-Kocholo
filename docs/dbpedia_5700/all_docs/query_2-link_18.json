        "text": "What are movie genres?\n\nThe big genre list: an overview of movie genres and subgenres\n\nMovie genres have evolved alongside the movie industry itself. In the early days of Hollywood filmmaking, the limited number of movie genres had distinct and clear definitions. It was easy to categorize releases based on their subject and style into specific movie genres.\n\nToday, movie genres are more numerous and less rigid, with the emergence of hybrid and crossover movies. Filmmakers experiment with genre theory and play with audience expectations to tell stories in innovative ways.\n\nUnderstanding movie genres is crucial in discussing movie theory and aids in comparing genre elements and the work of filmmakers during critical analysis of movies. We'll provide you with an introduction to movie genres and explain their significance before delving into a comprehensive list of movie genres, including important subgenres.\n\nWhat are movie genres?\n\nFilm genres categorize a film based on content and style. They address what story is being told and how it's being told, impacting several elements:\n\nSetting: Where does the story take place?\n\nCharacters: Who is the main character or ensemble of main characters, and which antagonists do they face?\n\nPlot: What is happening in the story? Do the heroes go on a quest, or does the main character solve a crime, riddle, or mystery?\n\nTheme: What is the underlying universal theme of the story, for example, forgiveness, love, death, or friendship?\n\nMood and tone: Is it dark or light-hearted, gloomy, mysterious, or inspiring?\n\nNarration: Are there typical narrative techniques, such as voice-over narration, on-screen titles, excessive flashbacks, or a non-linear storyline?\n\nMovies often blend genres, creating mixed or hybrid styles. The primary genre indicates the movie's main classification, while subgenres provide more specific distinctions or combine elements of different genres, like an action-thriller.\n\nFor example, a science-fiction thriller with horror elements in the style of a heist movie suggests a Sci-Fi setting, thriller-like suspense, horror-like shock, and a plot involving a specialized team executing a task. Such classifications help in understanding the movie's narrative style and thematic focus.\n\nWhy categorize movies into genres?\n\nWhile a personal approach to sorting movies might be as simple as those seen and those yet to see, or liked versus disliked, this binary method overlooks many defining aspects of movies. Categorizing movies into genres provides a basic characterization and helps group similar movies together. This organization into basic film genres aids in navigating the vast landscape of cinema, offering a starting point for exploring different styles, themes, and storytelling techniques.\n\nMovie genres aid viewers in discovering new films, particularly through browsing on streaming platforms. Critics utilize genres to compare movies and assess artistic elements like cinematography within genre contexts. Additionally, genres and subgenres enable broader discussions about the history and theory of moviemaking, enriching our understanding and appreciation of films.\n\nBasic movie genres\n\nFrom Hollywood's inception and the dawn of cinema, certain foundational genres have shaped the film industry. These film genres, originally rooted in live-action filmmaking, set the stage for storytelling through motion pictures. With the advent of advanced special effects and animation technology, new genres like animation emerged, expanding the cinematic landscape.\n\nAction\n\nComedy\n\nDocumentary\n\nDrama\n\nFantasy\n\nHorror\n\nMusical\n\nMystery\n\nRomance\n\nScience Fiction\n\nThriller\n\nWestern\n\nThe big genre list: an overview of movie genres and subgenres\n\nWe've organized our movie genre list into a tree structure with major movie genres as branches, from which the subgenres branch off further. We'll walk you through each genre, highlighting their key features, must-watch titles, and standout filmmakers.\n\nAction\n\nThe action genre is all about excitement: think edge-of-your-seat chases, explosive stunts, and nail-biting danger. It's a realm where movies are defined by their high-energy scenes, often branching into subgenres like martial arts or military adventures.\n\nKnown for their big budgets, action films are where you'll find jaw-dropping explosions and intricate stunts. Directors like James Cameron, known for hits like \"Terminator,\" along with John Woo, Michael Mann, Kathryn Bigelow, and Michael Bay, have mastered this thrilling genre.\n\nIn action cinema, there's always more to explore with its various subgenres and hybrids, each offering a unique flavor of adrenaline-pumping excitement. The action genre continues to evolve, consistently captivating audiences with its dynamic blend of spectacle and storytelling.\n\nThe action genre comprises several subgenres and hybrid genres:\n\nAdventure: Indiana Jones franchise, Jurassic Park franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, The Lost City of Z, Hard Boiled\n\nDisaster: Moonfall, The Day After Tomorrow, Dante’s Peak, Deep Impact, Armageddon\n\nMartial Arts: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Triple Threat, 47 Ronin, Romeo Must Die, Jackie Chan movies\n\nMilitary Action: American Sniper, 12 Strong, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi\n\nSpy and Espionage: James Bond franchise\n\nSuperhero: Marvel universe, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Spiderman franchises\n\nVideo game movies: Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Doom, Resident Evil\n\nAction comedy (including Buddy movie): Jungle Cruise, The Lost City, Bad Boys\n\nAction crime: The Gentlemen, No Sudden Move, Den of Thieves\n\nAction drama: Training Day, Collateral, The American\n\nAction-horror: Peninsula, The Predator, Till Death, Underwater, Jaws\n\nAction thriller: The Accountant, Drive, Jack Reacher\n\nAnimation\n\nAnimation is a diverse movie genre, where the magic lies in bringing inanimate objects to life through various techniques, each forming a unique subgenre.\n\nCGI (Computer-Generated Imagery): Dominating modern animation, CGI creates vibrant worlds through advanced computer rendering. These films, often significant in production time and cost, include classics like the Toy Story franchise, The Lego Movie, Wall-E, Ratatouille, Shrek, Frozen, Coco, and Luca.\n\nClaymation and Stop Motion: This technique breathes life into objects through frame-by-frame adjustment in still photography. Claymation, a subset, uses clay-crafted characters and settings. Notable films include Chicken Run, Early Man, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, Isle of Dogs, and The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nCutout Animation: Once relying on physical cutouts, this style now often blends with CGI. Its distinct look is showcased in films like South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut and The Beatles - Yellow Submarine.\n\nTraditional Drawn Animation: This classic style features hand-drawn frames and painted backgrounds, exemplified by early Disney films like Fantasia and Beauty and the Beast, as well as Studio Ghibli's My Neighbor Totoro and Persepolis.\n\nLive-Action Hybrid: These films mix real actors with animated elements, creating a unique crossover. Examples include Waltz with Bashir, Space Jam, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, The Mask, Casper, Looney Tunes: Back in Action, the 1978 animated The Lord of the Rings, Waking Life, and A Scanner Darkly.\n\nPuppet Animation: Utilizing various puppetry forms, from marionettes to shadow puppets, this subgenre includes films like Eraserhead, Labyrinth, Street of Crocodiles, The Muppet Christmas Carol, and Team America: World Police.\n\nComedy\n\nThe comedy genre, with its wide range of humor, from simple dad jokes to sophisticated satire and dark wit, is one of the most versatile film genres. The comedy genre is a playground for creativity, offering filmmakers the flexibility to blend humor with other themes and styles.\n\nBlack or Dark Comedy: This subgenre tackles taboo topics like death or tragedy with humor. Examples of dark comedy movies include Dr. Strangelove, In Bruges, Parasite, and Fargo.\n\nBuddy Comedy: Here, the comedy arises from the dynamics between two or more characters, whether they share a deep friendship or a love-hate relationship. It can blend with action or the Hangout genre, as seen in Dumb and Dumber and The Hangover.\n\nHangout Movies: These films focus on a group of characters whose interactions bring the laughs. They become almost like friends to the audience Examples include The Big Lebowski, Clerks, and The Breakfast Club.\n\nParody and Spoof: Parodies mock specific films, like Spaceballs does with Star Wars, while spoofs target entire movie genres, such as The Naked Gun with police movies and Scary Movie with the horror genre.\n\nPrank Movies: These involve putting people in unexpected, often outrageous situations, typically without their knowledge. Borat and the Jackass series are key examples of prank comedy movies.\n\nSatire: Satire humorously criticizes broader concepts or institutions, often through exaggeration. Examples include Natural Born Killers and Monty Python's Life of Brian, with mockumentaries like This is Spinal Tap using a documentary format for humor.\n\nSlapstick Comedy: Originating in vaudeville, slapstick comedy relies on physical humor and gags, demonstrated by classics like Charlie Chaplin and The Three Stooges, and modern films like Ace Ventura and Home Alone.\n\nScrewball Comedy: Evolving from slapstick, this romantic comedy subgenre often features a strong, quirky female lead challenging a male protagonist. Classic examples include It Happened One Night and The Philadelphia Story, with modern takes evident in films like She's Funny That Way.\n\nCrime\n\nThe crime movie genre delves into the world of criminal activities, legal battles, and moral complexities. It explores themes from the classic good vs. evil to the gray areas of morality, often making heroes out of underdogs or even the 'bad guys' in gangster films.\n\nCop Movies: These focus on police protagonists, sometimes paired with partners, blending with buddy films. They can be action-packed or comedic, like Beverly Hills Cop and Lethal Weapon.\n\nCrime Drama: This subgenre centers on legal proceedings and courtroom battles, often with a mix of detective work. Key examples include A Few Good Men and Erin Brockovich, where the climax often hinges on a pivotal court decision.\n\nCrime Thriller: Combining crime with the intensity of a thriller, this subgenre can have psychological twists or action-packed revenge plots, as seen in John Wick and The Equalizer.\n\nDetective and Whodunnit: Centered around an investigation, these films often feature an unlikely hero uncovering mysteries. Classics like L.A. Confidential and The Silence of the Lambs fall into this category, offering either a hidden perpetrator or a crime followed by an investigation.\n\nGangster Films: Focusing on organized crime, these movies showcase the life of gangs or the efforts to bring them down. Examples include GoodFellas and The Departed.\n\nHardboiled: A specific type of detective film, often set in the film noir era, featuring a cynical detective. Films like The Maltese Falcon and Chinatown exemplify this style.\n\nHeist and Caper: These films revolve around elaborate plans like heists or prison breaks, blending humor and seriousness. They feature masterminds and complex plots, as seen in Ocean's Eleven and The Sting.\n\nDocumentary\n\nDocumentaries are the non-fiction storytellers of cinema, educating and informing through real-life events and facts. As a movie genre, they come in various styles and subgenres, each offering a unique perspective on the world.\n\nExpository Documentary: These straightforward documentaries present information directly, often narrated, combining historical footage with modern interviews and expert insights. Notable examples include The Blue Planet, March of the Penguins, and An Inconvenient Truth.\n\nObservational Documentary: Focusing on close, unobtrusive observation, these films offer a firsthand look at their subjects with minimal commentary. Examples are Hoop Dreams and The Monastery: Mr. Vig and the Nun.\n\nPoetic Documentary: More abstract, these films are like visual essays, expressing feelings and ideas through creative compositions. Films like Koyaanisqatsi and Voyage of Time fit this style.\n\nParticipatory Documentary: The filmmaker plays a role in the narrative, either through commentary or direct involvement.
