        "text": "This Style Guide provides principles that can help ensure that written material considers the difficulties experienced by some dyslexic people and allows for the use of text to speech to facilitate ease of reading. Adopting these principles for dyslexic readers has the advantage of making all written communication easier on the eye for everyone.\n\nWhen making changes consider all the ways that you use written communications, such as emails, presentations, web pages and printed materials.\n\nConsider these principles in combination with other accessibility guidance such as the Web Accessibility Content Guidelines (WCAG).\n\nReadable fonts\n\nUse sans serif fonts, such as Arial and Comic Sans, as letters can appear less crowded. Alternatives include Verdana, Tahoma, Century Gothic, Trebuchet, Calibri, Open Sans.\n\nFont size should be 12-14 point or equivalent (e.g. 1-1.2em / 16-19 px). Some dyslexic readers may request a larger font.\n\nLarger inter-letter / character spacing (sometimes called tracking) improves readability, ideally around 35% of the average letter width. If letter spacing is excessive it can reduce readability.\n\nInter-word spacing should be at least 3.5 times the inter-letter spacing.\n\nSome dyslexic people find that larger line spacing improves readability. It should be proportional to inter-word spacing; 1.5/150% is preferable.\n\nAvoid underlining and italics as this can make the text appear to run together and cause crowding. Use bold for emphasis.\n\nAvoid using all capital letters and uppercase letters for continuous text. Lower case letters are easier to read.\n\nHeadings and structure\n\nUse headings and styles to create consistent structure to help people navigate through your content. In Word, you’ll find these tools in the ‘Home’ tab:\n\nFor headings, use a font size that is at least 20% larger than the normal text. If further emphasis is required, then use bold.\n\nUse formatting tools for text alignment, justification, indents, lists, line and paragraph spacing to support assistive technology users. In Word, you’ll find these tools in the ‘Layout’ tab:\n\nAdd extra space around headings and between paragraphs.\n\nEnsure hyperlinks look different from headings and normal text.\n\nColour\n\nUse single colour backgrounds. Avoid background patterns or pictures and distracting surrounds.\n\nUse sufficient contrast levels between background and text.\n\nUse dark coloured text on a light (not white) background.\n\nAvoid green and red/pink, as these colours are difficult for those who have colour vision deficiencies (colour blindness).\n\nConsider alternatives to white backgrounds for paper, computer and visual aids such as whiteboards. White can appear too dazzling. Use cream or a soft pastel colour. Some dyslexic people will have their own colour preference.\n\nWhen printing, use matt paper rather than gloss. Paper should be thick enough to prevent the other side showing through.\n\nLayout\n\nLeft align text, without justification. This makes it easier to find the start and finish of each line and ensures even spacing between words.\n\nAvoid multiple columns (as used in newspapers).\n\nWrite short simple sentences: 60 to 70 characters is optimal.\n\nUse white space to remove clutter near text and group related content.\n\nBreak up the text with regular section headings in long documents and include a table of contents.\n\nWriting Style\n\nUse active rather than passive voice.\n\nBe concise; avoid using long, dense paragraphs.\n\nWrite in simple clear language using every day words.\n\nUse images to support text. Flow charts are ideal for explaining procedures. Pictograms and graphics can help to locate and support information in the text.\n\nConsider using bullet points and numbering rather than continuous prose.\n\nGive instructions clearly.\n\nAvoid double negatives.\n\nAvoid abbreviations where possible; always provide the expanded form when first used.\n\nProvide a glossary of abbreviations and jargon.\n\nThe Dyslexia Style Guide 2023 is available as:"
