But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.”\n\n​- Lilla Watson\n\nWatson, an Aboriginal, women’s activist, rejects people coming to \"help\" as she fights against oppression within her community. Why do you think she does so? Considering your own life and social identities, can you draw comparisons to her struggles?\n\n“I learned a lot about systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men. I was once talking about gender and a man said to me, ’Why does it have to be you as a woman? Why not you as a human being?’ This type of question is a way of silencing a person's specific experiences. Of course, I am a human being, but there are particular things that happen to me in the world because I am a woman.” - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie​\n\nWhy do you think Ngozi Adichie insisted on being able to talk directly about her specific identity as a woman?\n\nWhat identities are important to you that others don’t always acknowledge?\n\nLet's Talk\n\nIt can be hard to talk about oppression no matter what side you find yourself on. However, these conversations are needed to develop a deeper understanding of the issues and prevent further harm. An effective way to enter into these kinds of conversations is by thinking through your own social identity.\n\nDo this “Social Identity Timeline Activity” with one or more people.\n\nFind relevant handouts here. Source: Resource adapted for use by the Program on Intergroup Relations, University of Michigan; Resource hosted by LSA Inclusive Teaching Initiative, University of Michigan.\n\nShare about the process of your identity formation with your partners using the discussion questions.\n\nWATCH: How the U.S. Suppressed Native American Identity\n\nREFLECT: In the video linked above, Dennis Banks shares how he and thousands of other Native American children were forced into boarding schools by the U.S. government (with the support of the dominant society).\n\nHow do you think individuals, institutions, and the dominant American society justified this cruel and inhumane treatment?\n\nWhat kept those who had power and voice (government officials, school teachers, civic leaders, regular citizens, etc.) from acknowledging the humanity of these children and preventing this atrocity?\n\nBanks connects historical oppression to current oppression faced by Native peoples. How can we join together as allies against this oppression?"
