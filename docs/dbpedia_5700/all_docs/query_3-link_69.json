        "text": "Solar Eclipses Eye Safety: Protect Your Eyes from the Sun!\n\nNever look directly at the sun during a solar eclipse (except during the very brief time the sun is in total eclipse; and even then, with caution). Looking directly at the sun can cause permanent damage to your eyes. After viewing a solar eclipse, seek treatment from an eye care professional if you or your child have any changes in vision that continue to get worse.\n\nWhat You Need to Know to Protect Your Eyes During the Upcoming Solar Eclipse\n\nSolar Eclipse Glasses\n\nUse expert-approved solar eclipse glasses to view a solar eclipse safely and without damaging your eyes.\n\nMake sure they meet safety requirements and are manufactured with the ISO 12312-2 standard. Look for ISO standard labeling when looking for solar eclipse glasses and purchase them from a trusted source.\n\nWear your solar eclipse glasses at all times when watching an annular or partial solar eclipse.\n\nWear your solar eclipse glasses at all times during a total solar eclipse, except during the very brief time the sun is in total eclipse; and even then, with caution.\n\nNote, solar eclipse glasses can be damaged. If the lenses of your solar eclipse glasses appear torn or scratched, they are not safe to use.\n\nTips for Solar Eclipse Glasses\n\nPinhole projection\n\nThis is the safest and most inexpensive way to watch a solar eclipse. This helps you avoid looking directly at the eclipse by using a projected image. Here are simple instructions for this do-it-yourself project:\n\nMake a pinhole (a thumbtack should make the right sized hole) in a cardboard paper that blocks light except sunlight shining through the pinhole.\n\nFacing away from the sun, hold the piece of paper so that the light from the sun can shine through the pinhole without obstruction.\n\nAllow the sunlight shining through the pinhole to project onto a second piece of white paper that will serve as your projection screen (as shown in the image). The piece of cardboard with the pinhole should be about three feet above the piece of paper used as a screen.\n\nIf you don’t want to punch a hole in something, a stainless steel colander or steamer (as long as it has a lot of little round holes in it) will work and make a lovely multiple pinhole projector effect on a white surface.\n\nKeep in mind NOT to look through the pinhole at the sun.\n\nOther Options\n\nWelder’s glass: Number 14 welder’s glass provides effective protection and can be found at a local welder’s supply store. This glass will reduce the harmful rays that are emitted during the eclipse. Do not use if there are any scratches or damage to the glass.\n\nMylar filters: Aluminized mylar plastic sheets are available as eclipse vision glasses or can be cut and made into a viewing box. Do not use if there are any scratches or damage to the sheet.\n\nOther ways: Other ways to safely watch a solar eclipse include on television or at the planetarium.\n\nSign up for news and alerts from Prevent Blindness!\n\nName(Required)\n\nFirst Last\n\nAddress(Required)\n\nState\n\nEmail(Required)\n\nEnter Email Confirm Email\n\nThe Eclipse + Your Eyes Program is Made Possible by the Generous Support of:\n\nSilver Sponsor\n\nSilver Sponsor\n\nBronze Sponsor\n\nBronze Sponsor\n\nBronze Sponsor\n\nFounded in 1908, Prevent Blindness touches the lives of millions of people each year through public and professional education, advocacy, certified vision screening and training, community and patient service programs and research.\n\nGive the Gift of Sight!"
