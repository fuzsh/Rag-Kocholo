        "text": "Child abuse is deadly.\n\nIn 2022, an estimated 1,990 children died from abuse and neglect in the United States, a number consistently on the rise over the previous five years.i Boys have a higher child fatality rate at 3.26 per 100,000 compared to girls at 2.25. African-American child fatalities (6.37 per 100,000) is over three times greater than that of white children (1.99), and nearly four times greater than Hispanic children (1.68).\n\nChild abuse is costly to society.\n\nNearly half of all U.S. children experience at least one type of childhood trauma.iii That exacts a toll on children, their caregivers, and their community, and our country as a whole also pays a price. Quite literally: In addition to the physical, emotional, and social costs of child abuse, it also carries economic costs.iv\n\nMost child victims are abused by a parent.\n\nIn 2022, a reported 434,000 perpetrators abused or neglected a child. In substantiated child abuse cases, 76% of children were victimized by a parent or legal guardian.\n\nChild-on-child abuse is common. At CACs in 2022, 16% of people alleged to have abused a child were themselves children (in cases where we knew the age of the alleged abuser).ii\n\nNationally, neglect is the most common form of abuse. Three-fourths (74%) of victims are neglected, 17% are physically abused, 11% are sexually abused, and 0.2% are sex trafficked.\n\nYet CACs serve far more sexual abuse cases, indicating a deeper problem. CACs investigated 236,601 cases involving sexual abuse allegations in 2023, around 55% of all cases our members carried through.ii While not all these cases resulted in a disclosure, charges, or a conviction, it’s an indication that the problem of sexual abuse may be much larger than federal statistics show. In the graph below, the data includes children who’ve reported multiple types of abuse.\n\nKids in care require extra attention from institutions and community members. Kids at camps, in youth sports, in religious settings, and other places away from home and school require parents to be vigilant. Perpetrators seek roles where they will have access to kids, and CACs help these institutions create policies to protect kids and root out those seeking to harm them.\n\nSexual grooming is the behavior that a perpetrator engages in by selecting a vulnerable victim, gaining access and isolating that child, and then gaining trust of that child, their family, institutions, and communities. It’s not just the child victim or potential victim that’s being groomed; it’s also the adults surrounding the child. It is also described as a tactical relationship-building style, building a relationship of trust for the purpose of coercion.\n\nResearch has identified certain “red flag” child sexual grooming behaviors to help parents and community members distinguish between concerning, but potentially normal behaviors, up through moderate risk and high-risk red flag behaviors.\n\nChildren that experience high-risk behaviors are nearly 7 times more likely to be sexually abused than an average child.\n\nIf children are experiencing these behaviors from a family or community member, it doesn’t always mean they are being abused, but it definitely means adults in their lives need to start asking questions.\n\nDownload level of concern guide\n\nKids can and do get better after abuse.\n\nChildren thrive and are able to reduce their trauma symptoms to a healthy range through the services available at a CAC, like evidence-based therapy, plus strong parental, family, and community supports CACs help bolster.\n\nCACs heal more than 200,000 kids each year. Our members offer 226,036 kids science-backed counseling and therapy services to help them recover from trauma and avoid the lifelong impacts of trauma.ii Plus, we offer connections to therapy for caregivers and other family members to support their child in recovery.\n\nHow many clinicians we train to cover the gap.\n\nEvidence-based treatments (EBTs) have been designed and tested for treatment of child trauma-related symptoms. It’s through the use of those proven techniques that CAC’s are making a difference in kids’ lives—and helping their caregivers, too."
