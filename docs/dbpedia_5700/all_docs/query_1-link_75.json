        "text": "Beyond The Statement\n\nSince 2020’s racial justice uprisings, corporations have continued to present messages of solidarity with our movement — yet many of these same companies have policies and practices that harm Black people and undermine a commitment to justice. Valuing Black lives is not a trend to exploit. It requires real action, a commitment to dismantling corporate cultures and profit structures that put profit above Black lives. Empty statements are not the change Black people need. That’s why we launched #BeyondTheStatement. It’s our campaign to hold companies accountable for the ways they perpetuate white supremacy, and press them to make a firm commitment to creating structural change — including by investing in Black leadership and paying their workers a living wage.\n\nbeyondthestatement.com\n\nWinning Justice\n\nNo one holds more power in our justice system than prosecutors. They decide who to prosecute, what the charges will be, and routinely make decisions that destroy Black people’s lives.\n\nWe are ushering in a new era of prosecutor accountability by mobilizing Black communities across the country. Already, we’ve pushed prosecutors and candidates in a dozen cities make pledges to put an end to mass incarceration.\n\nWe continue to build momentum to end the most unjust, destructive and racist practices underpinning our criminal justice system from money bail to over-sentencing, over-policing, and sending our children to adult prisons.\n\nwinningjustice.org\n\nNot To Be Trusted\n\nReliability in the news is more important than ever. Who can we trust? Not surprisingly, when it comes to information about Black people, most news outlets that influence the thinking of decision makers and the public are not to be trusted. They inaccurately represent Black people as drivers of crime, mischaracterize and demonize Black protestors, under-play Black contributions to society, single out and attack Black mothers, and the list goes on.\n\nThese inaccuracies and mis-representations are dangerous. They increase demand for disproven public policies that harm us. They also create warped perceptions of Black people that lead to real-world harms: when applying for jobs, seeking health care, interacting with police and prosecutors, trying to pass better laws, or just being a kid in a classroom. Through our News Accuracy Ratings & Report Card, we are exposing this deeply unfair pattern of inaccuracy, and creating a roadmap for improving standards and practices in the news.\n\nOrganizeFor\n\nJustice for Black communities has never been automatic: we speak up to demand it, and organize to attain it. It often starts with a small group of people who see injustice locally—police violence, racist media, discrimination by a business, de-funding of our schools—and feel they can no longer remain silent. And in every era, Black people have pioneered new ways to build the power we need to get the justice we deserve. Today, more people than ever are ready to step up, but they don’t always have the tools and experience to leverage technology effectively and win.\n\nOrganizeFor is a petition platform and training resource launched by Color Of Change to help people in our communities effectively challenge the injustices affecting the people they care about—family, neighbors, friends and allies. We have also launched the Movement-Building Partnership Program to provide expert training, and a dedicated channel on our platform, for staff at ally organizations.\n\norganizefor.org"
