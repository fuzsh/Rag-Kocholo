        "text": "Black and white thinking is a thought pattern that makes people think in absolutes. For instance, you may think you are either always right or the worldâs biggest failure. Psychologists consider this thought pattern to be a cognitive distortion because it keeps you from seeing life the way it really is: complex, uncertain, and constantly changing.\n\nBlack and white thinking doesnât allow you to find the middle ground, which can be hard to sustain in life at those extremes. Becoming less rigid in our thinking lets us stop using âall or nothingâ statements to depress ourselves without examining whether or not theyâre true. Using this 'cognitive' technique helps you to spot what you are doing and challenge your false impressions.\n\nWhat Causes Black and White Thinking?\n\nWhile itâs normal to experience black and white thinking sometimes in life, it could be a sign of something more serious if it becomes persistent. All or nothing thinking is commonly associated with these conditions:\n\nNarcissism. Narcissism is an exaggerated, excessive interest in oneself. Black and white thinking can be a symptom of this personality disorder. People who have it will often find it challenging to get help because they quickly dismiss doctors and therapists.\n\nAnxiety and depression. When people have anxiety and depression, itâs common for them to think in absolutes. More extreme emotions can cause black and white thinking to become worse.\n\nBorderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that causes people to experience intense feelings of anger, anxiety, and depression. They often will have symptoms of poor impulse control and frequently display black and white thinking.\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder. Itâs common for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder to think in absolutes because it gives them a sense of control and comfort. This can lead to a lot of rigidity which makes it hard to change.\n\nLearning. Many courses have simple measurements of performance: pass or fail. This can lead students to believe they are either good or bad at school, with no room for a middle ground. Adopting a growth mindset can help students recognize the value in step-by-step progress as you get closer to the goal of mastering the subject.\n\nCareer. Sometimes black and white thinking can cause you to become too rigid. This type of thinking can be a problem in work environments where there is a lot of collaboration and sharing of different ideas.\n\nDiet. If you think about what you eat in extremes, it could greatly restrict your diet and make it hard to try new things. This type of thinking may also cause you to see your physical appearance and body as only good or bad, which can be damaging to your mental health.\n\nReframe your thinking. If you catch yourself jumping to extremes, try challenging yourself. Think about why you might be thinking the way you are and whether there is another viewpoint you may not have considered.\n\nWatch your words. Black and white thinking words like \"always' and \"never\" are signals to pay attention to. If you hear yourself saying things like that, remind yourself to replace it with different words like \"maybe\" and \"sometimes\".\n\nAcceptance. If there is one constant in life, it's change. Try to be comfortable not knowing everything. It's OK to ask for more time to think about something or say, \"I don't know\".\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy. Many psychologists recommend something called cognitive behavior therapy, which can help you overcome unhelpful thinking patterns.\n\nCognitive Behavior Therapy works by helping you:\n\nLearn to recognize distortions in your thinking that create problems and counter your habits.\n\nGain a better understanding of the behavior and motivation of others.\n\nUse problem-solving skills to manage difficult situations.\n\nGet a greater sense of confidence in your own abilities.\n\nMove from extreme thinking to a more flexible and adaptable mindset. â\n\nWith the right strategies and professional help, you can learn how to replace extreme thinking with healthier, more helpful approaches.Â"
