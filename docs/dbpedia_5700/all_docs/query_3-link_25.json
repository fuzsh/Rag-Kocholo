        "text": "Your child or young person’s self-esteem will naturally go through ups and downs at different points. Going through big changes like starting a new school or moving to a new area can affect a child’s confidence. But with support, they can usually get through this and feel okay again.\n\nSometimes, however, a child or young person can experience low self-esteem over a longer period of time. This can make it harder for them to look after their mental health. It may leave them struggling with things like low mood or anxiety.\n\nThis can happen when a young person hears negative messages about themselves from other people. These could come from a parent, relative, peer, teacher, sibling or through social media. These messages can have a big impact because a young person develops their opinion of themselves through the way they are treated in their relationships. This is especially true while they’re still growing up.\n\nThe types of messages that damage self-esteem include:\n\nbeing called labels or names like ‘naughty’, ‘stupid’, ‘ugly’, ‘bad’ or ‘weird’\n\nbeing criticised when you make mistakes\n\nbeing put under too much pressure to succeed or do everything well, or only being noticed when you achieve something\n\nseeing lots of images about what a ‘beautiful’ or ‘attractive’ person looks like, when this person looks different to you\n\nbeing told off when you struggle with schoolwork\n\nAs a parent or carer, starting a conversation with your child or young person can sometimes feel like the hardest bit. But it can also be a bit of a turning point. Talking things through can help them to feel less alone. And once you know what’s going on, you’re in a better position to help. So even though it can feel difficult, it is important to try gently checking in with your child or young person when you see that they’re struggling.\n\nAlongside talking and providing emotional support, there are things you can do to help your child or young person improve their self-esteem.\n\nAs you think about strategies you might want to try, always remind yourself you’re doing your best. It’s natural to feel a bit overwhelmed sometimes, or to feel guilty as parents or carers about what we’re not doing. Remember that modelling good self-esteem is really important. That means not expecting yourself to be perfect or giving yourself a hard time either.\n\nHave a look through these suggestions and pick one or two things you think might help. Trust yourself to know what suits your child or young person best in terms of their individual needs and where they’re at.\n\nChildren and young people learn about how to be in the world from the people around them. So it’s really important that we model good self-esteem as parents and carers. For example, you can show your child that it’s okay to try new things by doing it yourself. Or, when things are hard, you can show them you have a kind, accepting attitude towards yourself.\n\nThis may feel difficult if things are tough or overwhelming at the moment. It's harder to do these things when our batteries are running low. Remember to keep finding ways to re-charge and take care of yourself, as well as your child. Make time, however small, for the things that work for you. Remember that it’s okay to ask for help when you need it and to share your worries with someone you trust.\n\nIf self-esteem is an issue you find particularly difficult, it might be helpful to reflect on your own experience. What messages have you been given by others, and how has this affected your attitude towards yourself?"
