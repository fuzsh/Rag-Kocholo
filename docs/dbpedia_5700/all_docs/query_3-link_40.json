        "text": "Childhood cancer is rare. Most children with one or more of these symptoms don't have leukaemia. But it's important to get your GP to check any of the symptoms out.\n\nMany symptoms of ALL are vague and non specific. They are similar to the symptoms of many more minor childhood illness.\n\nAt the beginning these symptoms might come and go. Your child might be exhausted one day, but brighter the next.\n\nMost of these symptoms are due to the leukaemia cells having spread inside the bone marrow . And there not being as many normal blood cells as usual.\n\nMost common symptoms\n\nThe most common symptoms of childhood ALL are:\n\nbreathlessness, looking pale or feeling very tired due to low red blood cells\n\nbruising or bleeding easily or for no reason, from low platelets\n\nhaving a high temperature (fever) and picking up infections easily and often\n\nNot every child with ALL has all 3 of these symptoms before they are diagnosed.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPale skin\n\nYour child might look paler or more 'washed out' than normal.\n\nFeeling tired (fatigue)\n\nYour child might be very tired, even if they are getting a good night’s sleep.\n\nUnexplained bruising or bleeding\n\nYour child might have:\n\nnosebleeds\n\nbleeding gums\n\nsmall dark red spots on their skin\n\nblood in their urine or poo\n\nGirls that have started their periods might find that they are very heavy. You might find your child is bruising more easily than normal.\n\nAbnormal bruising and bleeding happen because there aren’t enough platelets.\n\nFrequent infections\n\nYour child might pick up infections such as coughs and colds easily. Or you might find that the infections last a long time and are difficult to shake off.\n\nThis is because they don’t have enough healthy white blood cells to fight bacteria or viruses.\n\nA high temperature (fever)\n\nYour child might have a high temperature or feel feverish with no obvious cause.\n\nSwollen lymph glands\n\nThis diagram shows the lymphatic system . There are lymph nodes throughout the body.\n\nALL can cause your child’s lymph nodes to feel swollen when you touch them. The ones near the surface of the skin are the ones that people notice most. They include the nodes in the:\n\nneck\n\narmpit\n\ngroin\n\nIrritability\n\nYour child might seem particularly fractious or irritable and you might be finding it difficult to get them to settle.\n\nBone pain\n\nYour child might have bony pain. Children might limp or refuse to walk as they would normally. This pain is most common in the long bones in the body, like the arms or legs. But it can also affect the back and joints.\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nYour child might go off their food. They might be eating smaller amounts or not wanting to eat even their favourite foods. This is very common in childhood. Remember, this does not necessarily mean your child has leukaemia.\n\nFeeling full in the tummy (abdomen)\n\nYour child might have a feeling of fullness or discomfort in their tummy (abdomen). Your child’s tummy might look bigger than normal, or you might notice they suddenly jump a nappy or trouser size.\n\nThis can happen if their liver or spleen are swollen.\n\nSwollen testicles\n\nBoys might have testicular swelling. This is because the leukaemia cells can collect there. This is usually painless.\n\nSymptoms if the leukaemia has spread to the fluid around the brain or spinal cord (CNS)\n\nThe brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the name of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Some children at diagnosis have leukaemia cells that have spread to the CSF. Symptoms of this spread might mean your child:\n\nhas headaches\n\nis having more difficulty with school work\n\nis feeling generally weak\n\nhas had unexplained vomiting\n\nhas blurred vision\n\nhas fits (seizures)\n\nSymptoms of T cell ALL\n\nA type of leukaemia called T cell ALL can cause swollen lymph glands in the centre of the chest. It might make the thymus gland in the upper chest swell. The swollen glands or thymus gland may press on the windpipe, causing breathlessness and coughing. They can also press on the veins carrying blood from the head.\n\nThis causes pressure in the blood vessels and makes the face, neck and arms swell and go red. This is called superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO).\n\nWhen to see your GP\n\nTake your child to see their GP if you notice a change that isn't normal for them or if you have any of the possible signs and symptoms of leukaemia.\n\nThere are guidelines for GP’s to follow so they know when to refer a child to a specialist. The guidelines are clear that parent or carer concern about any changes should be taken into account."
