        "text": "Photosensitive epilepsy is when seizures are triggered by flashing lights or contrasting light and dark patterns. Photosensitive epilepsy is not common but it may be diagnosed when you have an EEG test. Flashing or patterned effects can make people with or without epilepsy feel disorientated, uncomfortable or unwell. This does not necessarily mean they have photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nHow common is photosensitive epilepsy?\n\nAround 1 in 100 people has epilepsy and of these people, up to 5% have photosensitive epilepsy. This is when seizures are triggered by certain rates of flashing lights or contrasting light and dark patterns. Photosensitive epilepsy is more common in children and young people (up to 5 times more than in later life) and is less commonly diagnosed after the age of 20.\n\nWhat is photosensitive epilepsy?\n\nThis is when you have a seizure straightaway, caused by being exposed to flashing lights or patterns. An electroencephalogram EEG can help with diagnosis, and may include testing for photosensitive epilepsy. This usually involves looking at a light which will flash at different speeds but other triggers can be tested for in specialist centres. If this causes any changes in brain activity, the physiologist will stop the flashing light before a seizure develops.\n\nWhat rate of flashing light can trigger seizures?\n\nBetween 3-30 Hertz (flashes per second) are the common rates to trigger seizures but this varies from person to person. While some people are sensitive at frequencies up to 60 Hertz, sensitivity under 3 Hertz is not common.\n\nWhat patterns can trigger seizures?\n\nSome people are sensitive to geometric patterns with contrasts of light and dark such as stripes or bars. Patterns are more likely to be a trigger if they are changing direction or flashing, rather than if they are still or moving slowly in one direction.\n\nFlashing, flickering or patterned effects can make people with or without epilepsy feel disorientated, uncomfortable or unwell. This does not necessarily mean they have photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nHow is photosensitive epilepsy treated?\n\nThe most common way to treat photosensitive epilepsy is with anti-seizure medication (ASM) This is to lower the risk of having a seizure.\n\nPossible triggers if you have photosensitive epilepsy\n\nFlashing or flickering lights or images between 3 and 60 hertz (flashes per second).\n\nA contrasting dark and light geometric pattern, such as black and white stripes or checks.\n\nFactors that may increase the photosensitive risk\n\nTiredness, stress or excitement. For example, playing a video game for a long time without breaks.\n\nThe effect taking up all your field of vision. For example, being very close to a screen.\n\nA light and dark pattern moving quickly, or changing direction, creating a disorientating effect.\n\nSeeing the effect against a dark background, such as watching a screen in a darkened room.\n\nIf suddenly exposed to a trigger"
