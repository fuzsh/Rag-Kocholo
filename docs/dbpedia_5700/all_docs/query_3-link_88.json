        "text": "Managing side effects\n\nChemotherapy affects all cells that grow and divide quickly in the body. This includes cancer cells and normal cells, such as the new blood cells in the bone marrow or the cells in the mouth, stomach, skin, hair and reproductive organs.\n\nWhen chemotherapy damages normal cells, this causes side effects. Whether or not you experience side effects, and how severe they are, depends on the type and dose of drugs you are given and your reaction from one treatment cycle to the next.\n\nPossible side effects from chemotherapy are explored below, and include:\n\nfatigue\n\nappetite changes, nausea or vomiting\n\nconstipation or diarrhoea\n\nhair loss\n\nmouth sores\n\nthinking and memory changes\n\nchanges to the blood, including anaemia, infections, and bleeding problems\n\nnumbness in your hands or feet\n\nchanges in hearing\n\nchanges in sexuality and fertility.\n\nMost side effects are short-term and can be managed. They tend to gradually improve once treatment stops and the normal, healthy cells recover.\n\nSometimes, chemotherapy causes long-term side effects that don't go away. These may include damage to your heart, lungs, nerve endings, kidneys, or reproductive organs.\n\nPreparing for side effects\n\nSome people have no side effects, others experience a range. If you have side effects, they will usually start during the first few weeks of treatment and may become more intense with each treatment cycle.\n\nBefore treatment begins, your doctor or nurse will discuss the side effects to watch out for or report, how to help prevent or manage them, and who to contact after hours if you need help.\n\nIf side effects change your appearance and self-esteem, consider registering for a free Look Good Feel Better workshop. For more details and to book, call 1800 650 960 or visit lgfb.org.au.\n\nYou may also find it helpful to speak with a psychologist or counsellor, who can provide emotional support.\n\nRecording side effects\n\nIt can be useful to keep a record of your chemotherapy treatment in one place. This will help you recall details about when you experienced side effects, how long they lasted, and what helped to make them better.\n\nSome people use a notebook or a diary, while others prefer to use a smartphone or tablet.\n\nShare the information you record with your doctors and nurses. They will be able to suggest ways to manage the side effects or, if appropriate, they may adjust your treatment.\n\nTrying complementary therapies\n\nComplementary therapies are sometimes used with conventional medical treatments. They may offer physical, emotional and spiritual support, help manage side effects, and improve quality of life.\n\nIt is important to talk to your doctors about any complementary therapies you are using or thinking about trying, as some could interfere with your treatment or make side effects worse.\n\nComplementary therapies are different to alternative therapies, which are used instead of conventional medical treatments. These are unlikely to be scientifically tested and may prevent successful treatment of the cancer.\n\nCancer Council does not recommend the use of alternative therapies.\n\nFind out more about complementary therapies.\n\nFeeling tired and lacking energy\n\nFeeling tired and lacking energy (fatigue) is the most common side effect of chemotherapy. Fatigue can include feeling exhausted, drowsy, confused or impatient. Fatigue can appear suddenly, and rest may not relieve it\n\nYou may have a heavy feeling in your limbs, get worn out quickly, or find it difficult to do daily activities. You might still feel tired for weeks or months after a treatment cycle ends.\n\nWhile fatigue is a common side effect of chemotherapy, it can also be a symptom of depression. For more information on depression, visit Beyond Blue and talk to your cancer care team.\n\n\"I had no idea that I would still be feeling tired five months after finishing treatment. I didn't know how to make it better and I was scared that's how it would be: that I wouldn't go back to normal, that I would never go back to having energy again.\" - Judy\n\nTips for managing fatigue\n\nAppetite changes, nausea or vomiting\n\nIt is common for your appetite to change when you are going through chemotherapy. The drugs may also temporarily change how food tastes. Sometimes you may not feel hungry or you may prefer different types of food.\n\nChemotherapy can make you feel sick (nauseated) or cause you to vomit. Not everyone feels sick during or after chemotherapy, but if nausea affects you, it will usually start a few hours after treatment.\n\nNausea may last for many hours and be accompanied by vomiting or retching. Sometimes nausea lasts for days after treatment.\n\nOften the best way to manage nausea is to prevent it from starting. Anti-nausea (antiemetic) medicine helps most people, but finding the right one can take time.\n\nIf nausea or vomiting continue after using the prescribed medicine, let your nurse or doctor know so that another medicine can be tried. Steroids may also be used to manage nausea.\n\nBeing unable to keep liquids down because of vomiting can cause you to become dehydrated. Signs of dehydration include a dry mouth and skin, dark urine, dizziness and confusion.\n\nIt is not safe to be left alone if you are vomiting a lot, as the confusion may make it difficult to realise you have become seriously dehydrated.\n\n\"Once I started chemotherapy, I went off my food. My mouth felt very dry, which made food taste unappetising. Adding extra sauce helped.\" - Helen\n\nTips for coping with nausea and changed appetite\n\nConstipation or diarrhoea\n\nSome chemotherapy drugs, pain medicines and anti-nausea drugs can cause constipation or diarrhoea. Tell your doctor or nurse if your bowel habits have changed.\n\nTips for managing bowel changes\n\nHair loss\n\nMany people having chemotherapy worry about hair loss (alopecia). Whether or not you lose your hair will depend on the drugs you are prescribed.\n\nSome people lose all their hair quickly and others lose it after several treatments, while others may lose only a little hair or none at all.\n\nAlthough losing head hair is most common, you may find your eyebrows and eyelashes fall out, and you may lose hair from your underarms, legs, chest and pubic region.\n\nWhen hair loss does occur, it usually starts 2–3 weeks after the first treatment. Your scalp may feel hot, itchy, tender or tingly. Some people find that the skin on their head is extra sensitive, and they may develop pimples on their scalp.\n\nAfter chemotherapy ends, it takes 4–12 months to grow back a full head of hair. When your hair first grows back, it may be a different colour or curly (even if you have always had straight hair). In time, your hair usually returns to its original condition.\n\nCoping with hair loss\n\nMany people find losing their hair difficult. Your hair may help form part of your sense of self – its loss can affect your self-confidence and make you feel sad or vulnerable. For many people, it's a public sign of the cancer diagnosis.\n\nTalking to your treatment team may help.\n\nScalp cooling\n\nSome people may be able to reduce or prevent hair loss by using a \"cold cap\". This works by temporarily reducing the blood flow and the amount of chemotherapy drug that reaches the scalp.\n\nA cap is worn on the head and attached via a hose to a cooling unit, which fills the cap with cold liquid. It is worn while the chemotherapy is delivered. The cold cap can only be used with certain drugs and types of cancer, and doesn't always prevent hair loss.\n\nCheck with your doctor or nurse whether a cold cap would be an option for you and whether it is available at your treatment centre.\n\nTips for managing hair loss\n\nMouth sores\n\nSome chemotherapy drugs can cause mouth sores, such as ulcers, or infections. This is more likely if you have had or are having radiation therapy to the head, neck or chest, or if you have dental or gum problems.\n\nIf you notice any sores, ulcers or thickened saliva, or if you find it difficult to swallow, tell your doctor.\n\nTips for mouth care\n\nSkin and nail changes\n\nSome chemotherapy drugs may cause your skin to peel, darken or become dry and itchy. During treatment and for several months afterwards, your skin is likely to be more sensitive to the sun.\n\nSome people find their nails also change and become darker than usual, or develop ridges or white lines across them. Your nails may also become brittle and dry. These changes usually grow out.\n\nTips for looking after your skin and nails\n\nThinking and memory changes\n\nSome people say they have difficulty concentrating, focusing and remembering things after they have had chemotherapy. This is called cancer-related cognitive impairment or, sometimes, \"chemo brain\" or \"cancer fog\".\n\nThinking and memory changes may be caused by treatment or medicines, fatigue and sleep problems, or emotional concerns, such as stress or depression.\n\nThese problems usually improve with time, although some people experience issues for years. Tell your doctor about any thinking and memory changes you are having, and if this issue is affecting your day-to-day life or your return to work.\n\nTips for managing cognitive changes\n\nHow chemotherapy affects the blood\n\nBlood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is the spongy part in the centre of the bones. The bone marrow makes three main types of blood cells, which have specific functions:\n\nred blood cells – carry oxygen around the body\n\nwhite blood cells – fight infection\n\nplatelets – help blood to clot and prevent bruising.\n\nBecause the new blood cells are rapidly dividing, they can be damaged by chemotherapy, and the number of blood cells (your blood count) will be reduced. Low numbers of blood cells may cause anaemia, infections or bleeding problems.\n\nYou will have blood tests at the beginning of treatment and before each chemotherapy cycle to check that your blood count has returned to normal before you have chemotherapy.\n\nAnaemia\n\nIf your red blood cell count drops, a reduced amount of oxygen circulates through your body. This can cause anaemia, which can make you feel tired, lethargic, dizzy or breathless.\n\nThe tips for coping with fatigue may be helpful. To minimise dizziness, take your time when you get up from sitting or lying down.\n\nYour treatment team will monitor your red blood cell levels. Let them know if you experience any symptoms of anaemia while having chemotherapy. If the levels of red blood cells drop too low, you may need a blood transfusion to build them up again.\n\nInfections\n\nIf white blood cell numbers drop during chemotherapy, it can lower your immunity. This makes you more likely to get infections and less able to fight any infections that do occur. Your doctor may recommend antibiotics as a precaution against infection.\n\nMany types of white blood cells make up the total white cell count. A type of white blood cell known as a neutrophil protects you against infection by destroying harmful bacteria and yeasts that enter the body.\n\nDuring chemotherapy, some people get low levels of neutrophils. This is known as neutropenia.\n\nIf you have neutropenia, you may be given an injection of growth factor drugs called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) after chemotherapy to encourage the bone marrow to make more white blood cells.\n\nYour doctor or nurse will speak to you about possible side effects. Some people may experience bone pain or tenderness at the injection site, or show signs of an allergic reaction.\n\nDuring chemotherapy treatment, even a minor infection could become serious quickly. See below for when you need to contact your doctor urgently.\n\n\"After chemotherapy I became very susceptible to infections. A small scrape can quickly become serious. But when I feel like an infection is coming on, I've learnt to see my doctor straightaway.\" - Brigita\n\nTaking care with infections during chemotherapy\n\nBleeding problems\n\nPlatelets are the blood cells that help the blood to clot. A low level of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can cause problems with bleeding. You may bleed for longer than normal after minor cuts or scrapes, have nosebleeds or bleeding gums, or bruise easily.\n\nYour treatment team will monitor your platelet levels. If chemotherapy causes thrombocytopenia, you may need a platelet transfusion. Ask your oncologist to explain the risks and benefits of platelet transfusion.\n\nContact your treatment team or call 000 if you have any persistent bleeding, such as a nosebleed that doesn't stop within 30 minutes.\n\nTips for when you have a low platelet count\n\nNerve and muscle effects\n\nSome drugs can cause tingling (\"pins and needles\"), numbness or pain in your fingers and/or toes, and muscle weakness in your legs.\n\nThis is called peripheral neuropathy. It is caused by damage to the nerves that send signals between the central nervous system and the arms and legs.\n\nFor many people, peripheral neuropathy is a short-term issue, but for others, it can last a long time or even be permanent. If you experience numbness and tingling, tell your doctor or nurse before your next treatment.\n\nTips for managing numb hands or feet\n\nChanges in hearing\n\nSome chemotherapy drugs can affect your hearing. Your doctor may recommend that you have a hearing test before you start treatment, and this may be repeated before each cycle of chemo.\n\nYou may be at risk of losing the ability to hear high-pitched sounds. Sometimes, chemotherapy also causes a continuous ringing noise in the ears known as tinnitus.\n\nWhile these changes are usually temporary, let your doctor know if you notice any change in your hearing.\n\nSex and fertility\n\nChemotherapy can have an impact on your desire (libido) or ability to have sex. It may also affect sexual organs and functioning in men and women. This can affect your ability to have children (fertility).\n\nChanges in sexuality\n\nA range of issues can cause people to lose interest in sex while they're having treatment. Aside from feeling tired and unwell, you may feel less confident about who you are and what you can do.\n\nThere may also be a physical reason for not being able or interested in having sex, e.g. vaginal dryness or erection difficulties. Changes in appearance can also affect feelings of self-esteem and, in turn, sexuality.\n\nIf you have a partner, it may be helpful for them to understand the reasons why your libido has changed and to know that people can have a fulfilling sex life after cancer, but it often takes time.\n\nSome partners may also feel concerned about having sex – they might fear injuring the person with cancer or feel uncomfortable with the changes in their partner.\n\nIf you have sex after receiving chemotherapy, follow the contraception recommendations outlined below.\n\nSexual intercourse may not always be possible, but closeness and sharing can still be a part of your relationship. Talk about how you're feeling with your partner and take time to adapt to any changes.\n\nTry to see yourself as a whole person (body, mind and personality) instead of focusing only on what has changed. You may find talking to a psychologist or counsellor helpful.\n\nSee Sexuality, Intimacy and Cancer, and listen to The Thing About Cancer podcast episode on sex and cancer.\n\nUsing contraception\n\nYour doctor may talk to you about using contraception during and after chemotherapy. Although chemotherapy often affects fertility, this doesn't mean it rules out pregnancy.\n\nSome women can still become pregnant while having chemotherapy, and a man having chemotherapy could still make his partner pregnant.\n\nChemotherapy drugs can harm an unborn baby, so women should plan to avoid becoming pregnant during chemotherapy treatment, and men should not father a child. If you or your partner become pregnant, talk to your specialist immediately.\n\nThe type of birth control you choose will depend on what you and your partner are comfortable using.\n\nSome people use barrier contraception such as a condom or female condom, which provides protection against any chemotherapy drugs that may be present in their body fluids.\n\nChanges in fertility\n\nIf you want to have children in the future, talk to your doctor about how chemotherapy might affect you and what options are available. Women may be able to store eggs (ova) or embryos, and men may be able to store sperm for use at a later date.\n\nThis needs to be done before chemotherapy starts and requires careful consideration.\n\nSee Fertility and Cancer.\n\nEffects of chemotherapy on women\n\nEffects of chemotherapy on men"
