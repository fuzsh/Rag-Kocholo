        "text": "Despite mandates by the federal government to ensure inclusion of women and minorities in all federally funded research,1 African Americans continue to participate less frequently than Whites. Lower participation rates among African Americans have been reported across various study types (e.g., controlled clinical treatment trials,2,3 intervention trials,4,5 as well as studies on various disease conditions, including AIDS,6–8 Alzheimer’s disease,9 prostate cancer and other malignancies,10–14 stroke,15 and cardiovascular disease16).\n\nSeveral factors that affect the participation of African Americans in studies have been identified17,18 including elements of study design,19–21 logistical problems, low levels of health literacy, sociocultural factors, and specific attitudes that hinder research participation.17 Mistrust of academic and research institutions and investigators is the most significant attitudinal barrier to research participation reported by African Americans.8,17,22–29 Its etiology stems from historic events, but is also exacerbated by more current actions,30–34 including socioeconomic and healthcare system inequities.35, 36\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the Tuskegee syphilis study is widely recognized as a reason for mistrust because of the extent and duration of deception and mistreatment and the study’s impact on human subject review and approval.37–39 However, the history of medical and research abuse of African Americans goes well beyond Tuskegee. Harriet Washington eloquently describes the history of medical experimentation and abuse,40 demonstrating that mistrust of medical research and the health care infrastructure is extensive and persistent among African Americans and illustrating that more than four centuries of a biomedical enterprise designed to exploit African Americans is a principal contributor to current mistrust. As recently as the 1990s, unethical medical research involving African Americans has been conducted by highly esteemed academic institutions. For example, researchers at a prestigious U.S. university recruited African American boys into a study that hypothesized a genetic etiology of aggressive behavior. Through the use of monetary incentives, they were able to convince parents to enroll their sons in a study that included withdrawal from all medications (including asthma medications), ingesting a mono-amine (low protein) diet, an overnight stay (without parents), withholding of water, hourly blood draws, and the administration of fenfluramine, a drug known to increase serotonin levels and suspected to be associated with aggressive behaviors. In addition to these methods, several other significant human subject violations were cited, including restricting the recruitment to Black children.40 It is fair to ask whether mistreatment of African Americans that has occurred more recently than the Tuskegee syphilis study is exacerbating mistrust today.\n\nAttitudinal studies suggest that mistrust of clinical investigators is strongly influenced by sustained racial disparities in health, limited access to health care, and negative encounters with health care providers.41–43 Beliefs about physician mistrust among African American patients are reinforced through differential treatment in comparison with Whites. Moreover, previous research indicates that a lack of cultural diversity and competence among physicians is a major contributor to African American mistrust of physicians.36,44,45 Ethnic minority patients receive less information, empathy, and attention from their physicians regarding their medical care than their White counterparts.46 Lack of information results in limited awareness, knowledge or understanding of the availability or value of medical research.34 Further, studies have illustrated that African American patients are less likely to receive medical services than White patients with similar complaints and symptoms.36\n\nAttitudes of mistrust reflect perceptions about interpersonal and technical incompetence, physician focus on profit, and expectations of experimentation.44 Several investigators have found that African Americans are more likely than age-, education-, and gender-matched Whites to believe that research findings will be used to reinforce negative stereotypes about their ethnic group47 or will expose them to unnecessary risks.25,48 Two separate studies examining barriers to African American participation in genetics research found that African American participants worried about the use of DNA data collected in biomedical research in later criminal investigations to implicate innocent people.49,50 Moreover, the literature demonstrates that African Americans report concern that the findings associated with their participation will not benefit the African American community.24 Finally, several studies suggest that investigators themselves often limit minority participation because they are less likely to ask minority patients to consider enrolling in clinical trials.6,11,15,46 Despite these concerns, other research has shown that African Americans recognize the value and importance of clinical research and the possibility of new and better treatments for themselves and the African American community emerging from it.17\n\nThis exploratory, qualitative study was undertaken to attempt to understand the barriers to research participation particular to African American adults who reside in a mid-size urban area. This study was designed to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors associated with participation/lack of participation in research studies, including more invasive biomarker and clinical treatment trials sponsored by Washington University, and Siteman Cancer Center. Both had been successful in recruitment of African Americans for surveys and screening studies, but had experienced less success in recruitment for invasive studies or clinical trials. The goal was to identify barriers to research participation, including more complex studies, and then use the findings to develop interventions to improve participation in both cancer and Alzheimer’s-related trials.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study used qualitative methods to explore barriers to participation in research among African American adults who reside in a mid-size urban city. Mistrust was the primary concern voiced by study participants. Literature that describes and explores the role of mistrust among African Americans dates back to the early 1970s, just after the Tuskegee syphilis study became public and uses both quantitative17,24,25,29,42,48 and qualitative17,22,26,27 approaches to describe mistrust and understand its relationship to research participation. Our data support existing literature and deepen the understanding of how multifaceted this mistrust is, how it influences many parts of people’s lives, and how it creates a significant emotional burden. Indeed, our data remind us that ongoing experiences with the health care system perpetuate feelings of mistrust. This continues to reduce our ability to recruit African Americans into research studies and limiting the generalizability of current research findings.\n\nOf particular interest is that the data indicate that barriers are common across multiple subgroups including those who had and had not previously participated in research studies, suggesting that merely participating in research is not enough to lessen mistrust. We intentionally created groups that consisted of individuals who had participated in research (from one of our centers), as there is some work that suggests that prior research participation increases the likelihood of participation.51, 52 Additionally, researchers in the study centers had developed multiple strategies to improve low participation among minorities The primary strategies in both cancer and Alzheimer’s disease were to develop long-term partnerships and improve access to quality care. The specific activities included (1) creating community advisory boards (2) delivering culturally targeted education programs (3) partnering with community-based organizations serving the African American community and (4) improving access to clinical care and support services. These findings suggest that previous participation in low risk research, such as survey or focus group studies, will not in and of itself increase participation in more invasive and higher risk studies.\n\nParticipants emphasized that historical events such as the Tuskegee syphilis study remain in the minds of many African Americans and often attributed mistrust to this history. History was discussed in every group and across socioeconomic statuses. Many described their beliefs that the federal government, responsible for the Tuskegee study, both injected syphilis into and withheld treatment from study participants beliefs learned from parents and grandparents. Even the more educated participants relate to this history and, although they recognize that Tuskegee participants were not injected, expressed continuing mistrust related to these past events. In fact, the emotional side of mistrust was particularly evident in groups constituted of higher-educated participants. This may reflect the fact that better-educated individuals have greater access to information, in general, and can therefore learn about specific events in more detail. This finding is illuminating because the research is mixed regarding the impact of education on mistrust60–62, and we could identify no other studies that clearly demonstrate that mistrust is similar across socioeconomic groups.\n\nAlthough historical events such as Tuskegee foster mistrust, participants stressed that disrespect and discrimination towards African Americans continues to occur. Recent literature supports the view that current occasions of perceived or real racism or discrimination exacerbate mistrust.63 The Institute of Medicine report on disparities of treatment by race suggests that much disparate care is due to discrimination, both conscious and unconscious.36 VanRyn and colleagues describe the complex process of decision making that medical providers go through and suggest that perhaps false beliefs about individuals may result in disparate treatment.64 Some studies, however, argue that participation in research increases discrimination by allowing investigators to highlight problems in the community (i.e., to emphasize negative traits of Black individuals and their communities). In fact, Nicholson and colleagues found that African Americans respond negatively to cancer disparity information and positively to messages of hope.65\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing instance of mistrust that participants described is the belief that information about research studies and their participation is withheld by researchers, which may be one factor that perpetuates feelings of mistrust. In particular, focus group participants indicated they are provided limited or inadequate information about their participation in research. Indeed, this may be one of the most enduring negative fallouts from the Tuskegee syphilis study and other unethical studies. However, these beliefs cannot just be attributed to historic events. For example, a recent study reported that over 50% of physicians prescribe placebos without thoroughly informing patients, suggesting that these beliefs may have merit.66 As researchers continue to behave in a way that exacerbates mistrust, so will the fear about research among the African American community continue. In turn, there will continue to be low participation rates, resulting in studies that can only be generalized to the White majority. The resulting inability truly to understand the biological and social determinants of disease etiology and progression among minority populations will only deepen the existing disparities in health.\n\nThis study has limitations. Qualitative data are descriptive and are not meant to generalize to any broader population. Our goal in this study was to gain in-depth understanding about research participation from individuals who could speak from life experiences about the issue, therefore creating productive conversation.53 Our data suggest the importance of working with and in the community as a way to understand perceptions specific to a particular community.\n\nAs is appropriate with focus group methodology, we developed and used a purposive sampling strategy.53 We segmented groups by previous research participation, gender, and socioeconomic status. Our findings did not identify differences by segments, suggesting that previous research experience and/or higher socioeconomic status were not enough to change deep-seated beliefs. We were able to recruit a large number of groups, which allowed us to reach saturation (or, repetition) of themes.55\n\nAlthough researchers are adept at providing incentives and recruiting from community venues to enhance African Americans participation in studies, it is important to understand that these efforts are not enough to facilitate recruitment into many more involved clinical studies or trials. It is imperative that we understand and act specifically upon mistrust that this and other studies have reported. Several reports outline ways in which researchers and health care providers can gain the trust of community members.4,18,24,67–69 For example, community-based participatory research (CBPR) models claim to improve community-research relationships70–72 although they are still not widely used.73 CBPR is a collaborative approach to research that equitably involves all partners in the research process, recognizing the unique strengths that each brings.72 It stipulates that long term relationships develop and that knowledge is gained by both parties, which is used to improve health.70, 74 Cook recently conducted a review of CBPR projects that addressed health disparities.75 In two-thirds of the studies, CBPR led to community actions to improve health. Studies that used qualitative methods were more acceptable to the community. In fact, community partners felt that the randomized controlled trials were too complex and were concerned that they withheld valuable interventions from the control group.\n\nPrinciples of CBPR have been used by investigators to increase African American participation. One tool that has been used successfully is a community advisor board (CAB), which provides a window into the context in which many participants live, helps define the consent process, and creates relationships.74 Several large research centers (Harvard, University of Pittsburg, Mayo Clinic) have created Community Research Advisory Boards (CRABs) to provide review and advice to investigators initiating more invasive studies and clinical trials. These boards review the project design and procedures to identify and address modifiable community-specific barriers to participation. Additionally, community boards and other groups promote regular, honest, and thorough dissemination of information about the research process. Studies also suggest that short and long-term outcomes must be communicated back to the community in order to gain and maintain trust.25,76 Participants in our study confirmed this desire. Finally, it is strongly recommended that potential participants be given adequate time to make decisions about research participation.25\n\nOther ways to increase African American participants in research should also be considered. For example, in both this project and much of our other work, community members express the desire for researchers to have a presence in the community. Participants indicate that small group information sessions, co-led by researchers and community members, would be welcome. In some of our other work, we employ community members to help us carry out the research. Finally, as recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Dept. of Health and Human Services, we must be diligent about encouraging African American (and other minority) students to continue their education to become scientists, thus increasing the proportion of underrepresented minorities in research positions.36,77\n\nIn the early 1970s, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute established a program designed to increase minority participation. The most important strategy suggested by the report was soliciting contributions from community opinion leaders.78 Why are researchers not implementing some of these strategies? Perhaps they have difficulty seeing the applicability of CBPR principles to clinical trials, as it has traditionally been used in public health and prevention studies. It is reasonable, however, to believe that researchers who conduct clinical trials can incorporate some of the CBPR assumptions and principles into their work. For example, researchers can attempt to understand the community and its “local theories,” or beliefs about determinants and solutions to problems.79 Communication of study findings has also been shown to positively influence attitudes about participation and willingness to consider participation in future trials, even when the results are negative or inconclusive.80 Participants in our study emphasized that when study findings are communicated back to the community, they should be presented in an understandable way, and also from a sense of interest and concern about the community. Teal and colleagues describe a framework for culturally competent communication, which includes communication repertoire, situational awareness, adaptability, and knowledge about core cultural issues.81 Researchers should indicate how studies can potentially benefit the African American community. To close the loop, investigators can work to ensure that minority communities reap benefits from new research findings.\n\nInvestigators will continue to be limited in their ability to recruit study participants until they (the investigators) understand the depth of mistrust among many African Americans and its impact on access to health care, medical treatment, and research participation. Perhaps researchers are not as culturally competent as is necessary and continue to make decisions unconsciously based on race.36 Our study suggests that the racism that was a community norm during the time Tuskegee syphilis study82 persists, a position validated by the report issued by the Institute of Medicine.36 This study reminds us that mistrust among African Americans, regardless of prior participation or socioeconomic status, continues and illuminates its multifaceted nature. Because of the recent and continued acknowledgement of health disparities that exist in African Americans, it is incumbent upon us to continue to explore and report the continuation of mistrust among African Americans related to research participation and to develop new and use existing strategies to enhance the trustworthiness of researchers and health care institutions. This study is a reminder about the significance of mistrust on research participation. It helps assure that investigators consider all of the issues related to mistrust as they embark upon studies, including informing community members about the potential impact of study findings on health disparities as part of outreach and recruitment. Unless researchers and practitioners acknowledge their roles in the development and continuation of disparities and create mechanisms to reduce mistrust, health disparities and limited research participation will continue."
