        "text": "Importantly, producers, directors, writers, along with sometimes hundreds of craftspeople, artists, and technicians all work in unison to present one picture. Mise en sc√®ne includes, quite simply, everything that goes into the production.\n\nEverything in the frame. All that a viewer sees, hears, and feels. The total design of a film.\n\nConsider Tim Burton's insanely creative and evocative production design. Each frame is bursting with style and personality, including his set, costume, and make-up designs.\n\nTim Burton Production Design ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nKeeping track of it all can be daunting, but if you‚Äôre a filmmaker you can make it easy to divvy up and break down every element of your story, from props and wardrobe to talent and locations.\n\nHow is this done? By breaking down your script. Determining your budget. Tagging your elements.\n\nDesigning your production is a tall task. That‚Äôs why using an intuitive script breakdown and production management software makes it easier to manage. You‚Äôll want to focus on details and logistics, but not lose sight of the art.\n\nThe big picture. That‚Äôs where a good breakdown comes in.\n\nThe mise en sc√®ne elements in this guide, combined with script breakdown tools, will empower you to better manage your filmmaking workflow. You‚Äôll be able to track and control your project‚Äôs mise en sc√®ne throughout the process.\n\nFILM TECHNIQUES\n\n1. How location affects your scene\n\nHere‚Äôs a veteran filmmaker tip: If you have a two-person dialogue scene and think any location will do the trick, think again. The difference between a conversation in McDonald's as opposed to a church can be extreme. Location says a lot about characters, intentions, obstacles, and themes.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the difference if a conversation takes place in a synagogue or mosque? At Disneyland? What about in a schoolroom, a confessional ‚Ä¶ or how about in the trunk of a car?\n\nMise en sc√®ne in film ‚Ä¢ Out of Sight\n\nWhen choosing a location, the budget often plays a role. Take a deeper dive into film budgeting during your script breakdown phase.\n\nThis will give you real-world parameters you can apply to every subsequent element of your mise en sc√®ne.\n\nStart hammering out locations with your script breakdown.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE elements\n\n2. Pick the right color\n\nFilmmakers who think of color as something secondary, the exclusive domain of the production designer or post supervisor, do so at their own peril.\n\nColor in film is a massive element of mise en scene that permeates every other visual element. The use of color is malleable and subjective.\n\nIts role in creating mood or effect ‚Äî indeed, its function in art of any kind ‚Äî cannot be overestimated. Here's a look at Kubrick's use of color in mise en scene ‚Äî notice how immediate and powerful his color choices are.\n\nKubrick's Color Palette ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nFor instance, in the film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Coen brothers set the story during a ‚Äúdust bowl-era‚Äù south.\n\nElements of film - cinematographer Roger Deakins and Cinesite work on color\n\nAnyone who‚Äôs ever been to the south in the middle of summer knows that it is lush and green. Not especially dusty.\n\nColor is a primary tool for filmmakers. You must appreciate its power. Especially in the post-technicolor film world, color not be considered an afterthought. It is a vital means of artistic expression.\n\nWhat are the major elements of cinematic design? Color always comes at the top of the list. Need convincing? Consider Akira Kurosawa's color palette. For a complete guide to using color in film, download our E-book that covers color palettes and color schemes in cinema that have been used to great effect.\n\nFree downloadable bonus\n\nFREE Download\n\nHow to Use Color in Film\n\nHue, saturation, brightness ‚Äî the three elements of color that make all the difference. In this book, we'll explain the aesthetic qualities and psychology effects of using color in your images. Topics include color schemes like analogous and triadic colors and how color palettes can tell stories of their own.\n\nThe more you know about color, the stronger your script breakdown will be and your mise en scene will follow suit.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE examples\n\n3. Your set establishes your world\n\nMise en sc√®ne translation? It effectively means ‚Äústaging.‚Äù\n\nSince the earliest days of motion pictures, setting the stage has been crucial for creating worlds.\n\nSomething that can be as simple as a bench, like in Forrest Gump, or as grandiose as the fantasy settings of the Harry Potter film series, can do so much to establish the world and anchor the characters.\n\nThere is a reason most art departments are such a large part of any film budget.\n\nWhy? Half the battle of creating the world of the film can be won by giving attention to the set.\n\nCheck out the storyboard view of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, in StudioBinder's Shot List feature.\n\nIf Harry Potter‚Äôs school of wizarding had been set in an American public school, it would be a very different film.\n\nMean girls wondering what‚Äôs up with the new wizard kid\n\nKey mise en sc√®ne examples relating to set include the Harry Potter films and Titanic. In both cases, the set actively informs time, place, and story.\n\nTracking and managing set requirements early in your production process is integral to controlling your film‚Äôs mise en sc√®ne.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE analysis\n\n4. Props importance\n\nThe use of props as a component of mise en sc√®ne is often lumped in with set or wardrobe. This makes sense on a certain level, but props deserve separate consideration.\n\nWhether a tiny item of large importance ‚Äî think the Heart of the Ocean diamond in Titanic ‚Äî or action-driving glittery articles like Dorothy‚Äôs ruby slippers in The Wizard of Oz, a prop (derived from the term ‚Äútheatrical property‚Äù) may even be the focus of the entire film.\n\nMise en scene stealer? The blue diamond in Titanic\n\nImagine if Dorothy is being chased through Oz ‚Ä¶ for a pair of Jordans or penny loafers instead of her magical kicks. Different movie altogether, all because of props.\n\nThe objects in your frame are interacting with every other element of your mise en scene all the time. Whether the filmmaker recognizes this or not, the audience sure does.\n\nEven if a character is not directly lifting, donning, tripping over, or smashing a prop ‚Äî if it‚Äôs in frame, it‚Äôs part of your story.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at an example: Creed.\n\nWe‚Äôll spend some time in Adrian‚Äôs restaurant with Rocky and Adonis. We‚Äôll identify and tag all the elements for each department for your script breakdown.\n\nMise en scene elements in Creed ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nProps have power. They‚Äôre vital elements of film. Any mise en scene definition must include them. Any script breakdown must tag them.\n\nwear MISE EN SC√àNE on your sleeve\n\n5. Costumes make the difference\n\nThe costume, or wardrobe, is another key part of the filmmaking arsenal when composing mise en sc√®ne.\n\nWhat characters wear says much about the world they inhabit, who they are within the world, how they feel, and how they carry themselves.\n\nKeeping track of wardrobe can be a tricky task from the outset. Breakdown your script with robust software that makes your film‚Äôs costumes easier to track. You can use StudioBinder's script breakdown feature to do it.\n\nScript Breakdown Software ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nWith the intuitive drag and drop menu, highlight the particular wardrobe piece, you need, and simply tag it as \"costumes.\"\n\nFurthermore, costumes bring together every other part of the mise en sc√®ne. The costume grounds the character in the world created.\n\nLook at any film and you‚Äôll see proof that costumes are one of the most important elements of mise en scene. Costume gives the audience unmissable information about each character.\n\nIn Gone with the Wind, wardrobe contributes to our understanding of the story‚Äôs time period, social structure, action, and scene composition. It also defines (or belies) characters in straightforward, instantly felt ways.\n\nThe clothes in The Breakfast Club serve as key elements of film. Wardrobe in the story conveys a variety of universal high school archetypes while also managing to provide each character with his or her own unique personality.\n\nCostumes tell us a lot about both the big picture and the particulars.\n\nwhy is MISE EN SC√àNE important?\n\n6. Hair and Makeup\n\nCostumes extend and bind all the elements of mise en sc√®ne. This is also true of hair and makeup, with intimate connection to talent.\n\nAlice In Wonderland, Marie Antoinette, and The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy showcase hair and makeup‚Äôs significance in creating character.\n\nBy magnifying and externalizing character traits, hair and makeup contributes to the elements of film in even the most complex worlds.\n\nAlright, mise en scene, I‚Äôm ready for my close up.\n\nHair and makeup can revitalize familiar characters, dispel preconceived notions about them, and make them relevant right now. Such is the case with the Joker in The Dark Knight Trilogy.\n\nWhen it was announced that the character of the Joker would be rebooted in the new Batman series, many scoffed at the idea of recreating a character that Jack Nicholson had made so iconic for Tim Burton.\n\nA similar adjustment was made for Todd Phillips' Joker as well. Here's a breakdown of how that character was realized in each iteration.\n\nHow Costume Changes Character ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nWith a radically different approach to the character‚Äôs hair and makeup, the new iteration of the Joker dispelled memories of the original and helped win Heath Ledger an Oscar.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE spotlight\n\n7. Lighting sets the tone\n\nFilm techniques seen and unseen contribute to your mise en sc√®ne. Lighting techniques exemplify this ‚Äúseen and unseen‚Äù quality. Just ask a cinematographer.\n\nLighting is one of the key elements of film. It‚Äôs the pi√®ce de r√©sistance in completing your mise en sc√®ne. Here's one of today's premiere DPs, Roger Deakins, discussing his relationship and approach to lighting.\n\nLighting is one of the essential mise en scene elements ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nLighting, like all the elements of mise en sc√®ne explored on this list, is best considered early in Pre-Production, during the script breakdown phase.\n\nWe find a striking example of lighting the Film Noir genre. The Film Noir style characteristically has strong contrast in color or shade with a prevalence of chiaroscuro lighting. This isn‚Äôt only because a lot of classic Film Noir movies are shot in black and white: it‚Äôs also achieved through lighting.\n\nA good use of these film lighting techniques in a film outside the Film Noir genre is found in Schindler‚Äôs List.\n\nA solid mise en scene list must include Schindler‚Äôs List.\n\nThe contrast of stark blacks to ethereal whites, the moody lighting, the highlights seen and unseen all combine. They inform us of the theme of this period piece and the characters‚Äô places in the world.\n\nBut a film does not have to use drastic lighting to set mood, tone, or theme.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE\n\n8. The medium ‚Äî film vs. video\n\nYou‚Äôre making a film, right? Film is the material that records moving images. It‚Äôs also the movie you make with those moving images.\n\nDifferent kinds of film and processing techniques lead to different kinds of mise en scene. And between film, chemicals, digital, software, apps, and other tools, the possibilities are vast.\n\nFILM DEFINITION\n\nWHAT IS FILM?\n\nFilm is a thin plastic strip coated with light-sensitive cellulose for exposure in a camera, used to produce moving pictures.\n\nThe size and uses of film vary. A film strip can be as small as 8mm and as large as 70mm. Film can be processed with chemicals such as tungsten to achieve a variety of effects.\n\nThis simple definition spawned an entire universe of artistic expression.\n\nThe variety of film that has been generated by Kodak or Fuji, to name only a couple, is truly astounding. It is hard to believe that there was once only one kind of black and white film.\n\nThat‚Äôs right, once upon a time filmmakers had a small selection of black and white film available. Today, the choices are abundant, beginning with size: 8mm, 16mm, Super 16mm, 35mm, 65mm and so on.\n\nThen there is black and white or color, as well as stock and speed. Choosing a film stock is important for creating the look of your scene. One more obvious thing about film. It no longer has to be film. It can, and more than likely will be, digital.\n\nMise en scene in video: the film Timecode was shot on four camcorders\n\nFilm or digital is now the ultimate question when it comes to making a choice for your project‚Äôs mise en scene. Check out test footage for the best 4K video cameras. Talk to other filmmakers. Do your research.\n\nWhich leads us to the next section.\n\nelements of film\n\n9. Picking the camera\n\nYour camera does more than simply record your mise en sc√®ne. It actively shapes it. If the mise en scene translation comes out to ‚Äústaging‚Äù or ‚Äúputting on stage,‚Äù then what kind of camera you use makes a difference.\n\nYour choice of camera is an essential element of mise en sc√®ne. It can paint as distinct and unique a picture as any other element.\n\nAt the heart of filmmaking is manipulating and capturing light to produce a picture. What you use to capture that light, simple or advanced, has an effect.\n\nFor instance, filmmaker John Cassavetes hated the artifice that was so common in the early years of filmmaking. He leaned towards improvisation in performance and Cin√©ma V√©rit√© as a rule for mise en sc√®ne.\n\nCINEMA VERITE DEFINITION\n\nWHAT IS CINEMA VERITE?\n\nCin√©ma v√©rit√© is a genre and style of filmmaking characterized by realism in all aspects of mise en sc√®ne. Using simple equipment and often improvised story and structure, the style lends itself to independent filmmaking. It has given rise to subsequent film movements such as Dogme 95.\n\nCassavetes grabbed the nearest Bolex 16mm camera he could find and hit the streets to make his masterpiece. Paul Thomas Anderson did almost the polar opposite in his film The Master.\n\nHe used a 65mm camera that insured that the subjects in his frame would be seen in a much higher resolution, as part of a literally wider world.\n\nBut one need not use a 65mm camera to achieve these effects.\n\nPanavision 65mm - it‚Äôs as if 4k and 16mm had a mise en scene love child\n\nThe scope of the film and whether or not it is digital plays a large role here. There are now digital versions of 16mm, Super 16mm, and so on.\n\nEvery cinematographer can consider a wide array of camera choices to benefit your particular story.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE in motion\n\n10. Camera placement\n\nWhere you choose to put your camera is just as important as what kind of camera you use. No viewer will be thinking of where you put camera if you place it correctly. Here we cannot overstate the importance of a shot list.\n\nCamera Angles Explained ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nWhether at a high angle above the subject or a hundred feet away, where the camera is and what it captures should be determined before you arrive on set.\n\nMake a shot list. Start tagging your elements. Stay organized. Be prepared.\n\nYou‚Äôll make a better film.\n\nspeed of MISE EN SC√àNE\n\n11. Speeding up or slowing down film\n\nAs a filmmaker, you can shape and bend your created world like a wizard. Time can stand still, it can move at a fraction of normal speed or be sped up into a blur. This all comes down to frame rate. Here's our guide to frame rate and the options filmmakers have to manipulate their mise en scene.\n\nUltimate Guide to Frame Rate ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nYou can also change the tempo of your world and your characters with fast or slow motion. You, as a filmmaker, are a master of time and space, all contributing to mise en scene.\n\nMany filmmakers have used the speed of the scene to accentuate every element of mise en sc√®ne. Whether fast motion or slow motion, you can become a master of time and space by controlling your elements of film.\n\nThe Matrix - to learn mise en scene techniques, take the red pill\n\nChariots of Fire, Raging Bull, Any Given Sunday and pretty much every other sports movie ever offered from Hollywood would not be complete without a slow-motion finish for the victor.\n\nThe speed of the scene is an easily accomplished film technique that is a cornerstone of filmmaking.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE on the scene\n\n12. Comprehending composition\n\nComposition is an element of mise en sc√®ne that has infinite possibilities. There are rules of composition many image-makers use when framing their subjects. These can be obeyed or broken depending on your intent for the shot but how you frame your shot is massively important in bring all of these mise en scene elements together.\n\nUltimately, characters and action should suggest the layout of the image, the placement of elements within it. Good composition guides a viewer‚Äôs eye and leads a viewer‚Äôs focus within the frame.\n\nThe Rule of Thirds is one way filmmakers can imbue their frame and scene with the focus they desire.\n\nMise en scene elements ‚Ä¢ The Rule of Thirds\n\nUnless it reads a certain way in the script, where everything is placed does allow for creative liberties. But be careful that something you place flippantly will not lend itself to an unintended, confusing, or ulterior meaning.\n\nYou‚Äôll really want your composition and placement to be intentional.\n\nfilm techniques on display\n\n13. Form and Frame\n\nBring it all together.\n\nIf you‚Äôve done everything else right, you won‚Äôt want to leave these ‚Äúunseeable‚Äù aspects of mise en sc√®ne to chance. Every beautiful picture deserves a spectacular form and a well-thought-out frame.\n\nThe form is the twin of composition. It‚Äôs not the who, what, where, or when.\n\nForm is the how. How is your mise en scene communicated?\n\nAnimation? Puppets? Stop motion? Live action? A combination? How are the elements woven together in a symbiotic relationship?\n\nWes Anderson is a fan stop motion, miniatures, and live action. These forms set the tone for the entire mise en sc√®ne in films like Isle of Dogs.\n\nForm and frame: elements of film in Isle of Dogs.\n\nNow for frame. Your picture‚Äôs almost done. How do you want to frame it? An example of how framing makes the scene in The Shawshank Redemption.\n\nFraming and mise en scene elements in The Shawshank Redemption\n\nTo say that the framing in the scene of the discovery of the escape is masterful is no hyperbole. Here, the warden is literally framed by the tunnel that will be his undoing.\n\nFraming takes composition to the next level. When you frame your film, you‚Äôre doing so with the understanding that your created world functions within the real world. Where will you set the parameters for your viewers?\n\nCamera Framing ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nYou‚Äôre deciding where the form of your story ends and the real world begins. You‚Äôre putting a border around your film ‚Äî or artistically suggesting that the border doesn‚Äôt exist at all.\n\nFrame is as crucial as any of the other mise en scene elements on our list.\n\nfocus on MISE EN SC√àNE\n\n14. Depth of Field\n\nDepth of field is one of the subtler elements of film, but a measurable one. How you use it contributes meaningfully to your work‚Äôs mise en sc√®ne. We've seen other mise en scene elements designed to draw the audience's attention. And using the camera is yet another tool to achieve the same effect, oftentimes in combination with other elements such as color or lighting.\n\nWith a light touch, a filmmaker can play with peripheral elements while keeping the primary focus in the viewer‚Äôs sights. Here's our ultimate guide to camera focus and how filmmakers can use techniques like deep depth of field, shallow depth of field, and the rack focus.\n\nMise en scene elements & camera focus ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nAsk yourself, what draws attention first, then second, and even third? What‚Äôs the order of importance to what‚Äôs being shown, and why?\n\nOne of the most effective film techniques to master focus: depth of field.\n\nlisten to your MISE EN SC√àNE\n\n15. Sound design\n\nSound design is one of the elements of film that often gets neglected by fledgling filmmakers.\n\nRest assured, effective use of audio is the single easiest way to heighten a lackluster scene ‚Äî or ruin a great one.\n\nWhether you are using diegetic or non-diegetic sound, music, and sound effects, it is critical that you think of what is heard as essential to your mise en scene elements.\n\nIn this video, we examine how Quentin Tarantino uses sound to modulate the tone of his violence. When he wants a scene to be disturbing or when he wants it to be fun, sound design plays a major role.\n\nTarantino's Sounds of Violence ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nSound is so high on the list of film techniques that it has not one, but two Academy Award categories. Here are our favorite Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing winners.\n\nThink hard about how you use sound, and don‚Äôt let it fall by the wayside in your creative project. No mise en scene definition would be complete without sound.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE rhythm\n\n16. Music\n\nThe importance of music in film cannot be overstated when it comes to completing your mise en sc√®ne.\n\nAsk anyone what comes to mind when they think of movie music, and odds are you‚Äôll hear mention of Star Wars and Indiana Jones, maybe Jaws and the James Bond theme.\n\nAnd what about films like American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and Pulp Fiction? Their well-curated popular songs infuse and reflect every single one of the other mise en scene elements.\n\nNot to mention films with music, and musicians, at their core: Straight Outta Compton, Amadeus, Bohemian Rhapsody, What‚Äôs Love Got to Do with It.\n\nThe list goes on. And then there‚Äôs musicals! What do these films and their music have in common?\n\nMusic mise en scene examples ‚Ä¢ The Empire Strikes Back\n\nThe music becomes a character in the film itself. The leitmotif and the character are synonymous.\n\nThe rhythm, tempo, and texture of mise en scene is tied to the music.\n\nWhen we think of ‚ÄúThe Raiders March‚Äù (‚ÄúIndiana Jones Theme‚Äù) we can‚Äôt help but envision Harrison Ford in character as Indiana Jones, wearing his hat and running from a boulder, or wielding his whip and leaping off a cliff.\n\nMusic, or the lack thereof, can be effective in painting a full picture. Music also is a way for the filmmaker to communicate to the audience. The filmmaker can inform and enrich the what, when, why, and how of a story‚Äôs moment-by-moment emotional resonance.\n\nessential film techniques\n\n17. Know the talent\n\nYour actors are one of the most essential mise en sc√®ne elements.\n\nMany directors feel that if you cast correctly, that is to say appropriately for the characters, story, and overall vision, then half the battle is already won.\n\nActors‚Äô strengths and weaknesses can be exploited when they are the central focus of a scene.\n\nSome actors are chosen for the melodramatic or overacting quality of their performance. Think Jim Carrey in 80 percent of the roles he‚Äôs played.\n\nJim Carrey literally chews the mise en scene.\n\nJim Carrey would be out of place in a Merchant Ivory film. The term ‚Äúchew the scenery‚Äù can be used as a positive or a negative, depending on the scene and the intention.\n\nThe look and ability of your actors articulates your film‚Äôs mise en scene definition. For directors, working with cast on performance is quite possibly the most dominant way to shape mise en scene.\n\nblock by block\n\n18. Blocking actors\n\nJust as camera placement and movement are essential, so are placement and movement of talent.\n\nBlocking takes all the mise en scene elements directly to the cast.\n\nAttack the block - blocking mise en scene examples\n\nWhere an actor is arranged, and if, when, and how an actor moves in the scene, all highlight the reason for the scene itself.\n\nBlocking organizes the action, the business of the moment. It flavors what‚Äôs going on, both on the surface and underneath.\n\nDoes an actor take a step, scratch an itch, put on a hat, do a jumping jack, bite into a sandwich? Does an actor do this before, after, or in the middle of speaking? Why? It can all have a major effect on the dynamics of the scene.\n\nBlocking and Staging ‚Ä¢ Subscribe on YouTube\n\nConsider what your actors do and how the action reads to your audience. Put yourself in the theater ‚Äî how would you interpret it?\n\nThe term ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my motivation?‚Äù was coined by an actor given blocking direction that had nothing to do with the scene they were in.\n\nBe prepared to explain and justify your blocking choices to collaborators, especially to your on-screen talent.\n\nYour mise en scene depends on it.\n\nelements of film in motion\n\n19. Action in the background\n\nThe main action in any given moment is what your mise en scene all comes down to. What‚Äôs the conflict, the desire, the intention? How does it unfold? Where do your characters start in a scene, and where do they end?\n\nNot just physically, but emotionally. How do they change?\n\nBackground action, seemingly throwaway action, and any action that is secondary to that in primary focus can be memorable and valuable as part of your mise en sc√®ne.\n\nIn Midsommar, director Ari Aster uses the wide open spaces of his daylight rural setting to create an extra layer of foreshadowing and suspense.\n\nMise en scene in action ‚Ä¢ Midsommar's background\n\nThis is a specific use of action in the background to complete the story. Remember that lack of action is still a form of action.\n\nEven if characters do nothing, inaction becomes their action. Mise en scene depends on what‚Äôs being done.\n\nMISE EN SC√àNE in film\n\n20. Post-Production\n\nThe final step to completing your mise en sc√®ne is often the final step in locking your film.\n\nPost-production and/or, more specifically, CGI or Computer Generated Imagery, can be the icing on the cake for your completed film.\n\nYou want to minimize surprises in executing your mise en sc√®ne by starting with a solid script breakdown during pre-production.\n\nThe script breakdown phase is also where you‚Äôll want to determine what you‚Äôll aim to accomplish during the post-production step. Unforeseen fixes and tweaks will very likely arise, and post is an ideal place to address these ‚Äî but you‚Äôll want to keep ‚Äúmajor repairs‚Äù to a minimum.\n\nThe rapid growth of CGI can create mega-worlds of wizards and superheroes. This translates to the ability of filmmakers to add many critical mise en sc√®ne elements with computers.\n\nup Next\n\nWes Anderson‚Äôs Mise en Sc√®ne\n\nMise en sc√®ne elements can be as simple as an actor in front of a camera.
