        "meta_description": "Numbers have become increasingly important in routine clinical practice; when we will diagnose diseases; with choice of the kind or dose or duration of treatments; to localize incisions during surgery; to choose the size or power of implants; or to schedule follow-up visits, etc. Various biometry evaluations are done in clinics on a daily basis which are reported in numbers. Sometimes the only thing an ophthalmologist is looking for is just a number (e.g. normal corneal power, minimal acceptable residual stromal bed, minimum length of temporal artery biopsy, appropriate follow-up time for various diseases, anatomical reference values, etc). Despite the widespread use and continuous improvements of search engines, finding the normal range of values or their clinical significance is still difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, gathering all the reference values in the ophthalmology field is highly appreciated of clinicians. The current page is aimed to gather all actual reference values and their clinical significance in various conditions in ophthalmology. The numbers are retrieved mainly from the latest version of The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Basic and Clinical Science Course™ book series. The continuous contributions of all members are mandatory to keep the page up to date.",

        "text": "The significance of numbers in routine clinical practice has grown exponentially. They guide disease diagnoses, treatment choices (in terms of kind, dosage, and duration), aid in surgical precision, determine implant specifications, and even influence follow-up schedules. Daily clinic procedures involve various biometric assessments, generating essential numerical data. In the realm of ophthalmology, sometimes, the sole focus for specialists is a single numeric value, such as normal corneal power, acceptable residual stromal bed levels, or specific anatomical reference values. Despite the advancement of search engines, procuring normal value ranges and their clinical implications remains a cumbersome task. Therefore, there's a strong appreciation among clinicians for a centralized repository of reference values in ophthalmology. This initiative aims to collect and present the latest reference values and their clinical relevance across various ophthalmic conditions. The primary source for these numbers is The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Basic and Clinical Science Course™ book series. Continuous contributions from all members are vital to maintain the page's accuracy and relevance.\n\nEye in Numbers\n\nAdult eye volume:\n\n~6.5-7.0 milliliter.\n\nAxial length (AL):\n\nNormal length in adults:\n\n23-25 mm\n\nHigh myopia (> − 6 D):\n\n> 26 mm\n\nPathologic myopia (> − 8 D):\n\n32.5 mm\n\nMicrophthalmia:\n\n< 21 mm in adults\n\n< 19 mm at 1 year of age\n\nNanophthalmos:\n\n< 18 mm in a highly hyperopic eye\n\nClinical pearls:The standard Morcher CTR comes in three sizes based on uncompressed diameter and used according to axial length(AL):\n\n12.3 mm (compresses to 10 mm, Morcher 14) : AL < 24 mm)\n\n13 mm (compresses to 11 mm, Morcher 14C): 24 mm < AL< 28 mm\n\n14.5 mm (compresses to 12 mm, Morcher 14A): AL > 28 mm\n\nClinical pearls: Implant size can be calculated based on a simple algorithm:\n\naxial length-2 mm = implant diameter\n\nsubtract 1 mm from implant diameter for evisceration and for hyperopia\n\nTransverse diameter (i.e. at its widest point) of the globe:\n\napproximately 24 mm\n\nCornea:\n\nCorneal diameter:\n\nIn adults (reaches adult size by age 2 years):\n\nHorizontal:\n\n12-12.5 mm\n\nClinical pearls: To calculate ACIOL size: horizontal white to white distance + 1 mm.\n\nVertical:\n\n11 mm\n\nAt birth:\n\n9.5-10.5 mm\n\nClinical pearls: Congenital glaucoma:\n\n>12 mm horizontally in the newborn\n\n> 11.5 mm at birth\n\n> 12.5 mm in 1-year-old children\n\n> 13 mm in other children\n\nClinical pearls: Buphthalmos (“bull’s-eye”)\n\nHorizontal corneal diameter > 13 mm\n\nClinical pearls: Megalocornea:\n\n>13 mm\n\nClinical pearls:Microcornea:\n\n<10 mm\n\nConsistency:\n\n70% of its dry weight: type I collagen\n\nPower:\n\nAverage 43 diopter (D) (air-tear interface)\n\nAnterior: 48 (49) D\n\nPost: -5.8 (6) D\n\nPosterior corneal surface contributes approximately 0.4 D of against-the-rule astigmatism.\n\nClinical pearls: Values in various conditions:\n\nCorneal plana:\n\n< 43 D\n\nKeratoconus:\n\nCentral K > 47.2\n\nI-S difference: >1.4 D in 3 mm\n\nAsymmetric K > 0.92 D\n\nRisk for buttonhole with LASIK:\n\n> 48 D\n\nRisk for free flap with LASIK:\n\n< 40 D\n\nHow to predict final K after LASIK:\n\nEvery 1 diopter myopic correction:\n\nFlattening of 0.80 D for every diopter of myopia treated\n\nAvoid final K after LASIK: < 35 or 36 D (e.g. 8-9 D < diopter correction with preoperative K: 43 D)\n\nEvery 1 diopter hyperopic correction:\n\nSteepening of 1.00 D for every diopter of hyperopia correction.\n\nAvoid final K after LASIK: 50 D< (e.g. 7 D < correction with preoperative K: 43 D)\n\nIntacs in advanced cases of keratoconus:\n\nK> 60.00 D has a lower likelihood of functional improvement of vision;
