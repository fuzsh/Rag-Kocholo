        "text": "The White savior complex, also known as White saviorism, is an ideology that a White person acts upon from a position of superiority to rescue a BIPOC—Black, Indigenous, or person of color—community or person.\n\nYou might ask yourself how you can help after seeing people—especially people of color—in need during or after an environmental or natural disaster, a pandemic, or any other humanitarian crisis. Maybe you wonder how you can help after seeing the day-to-day inequities that BIPOC people face.\n\nIs what you are doing to help to make you feel good about yourself more so than actually working against the systemic problems that affect BIPOC people? The White savior complex may be at play.\n\nHelping out your fellow humans is a noble idea, but the White savior complex can stand in the way of addressing the real work that needs to be done. Here's what you need to know about White saviorism and how to avoid it.\n\nHow To Identify White Savior Complex\n\nWhether or not they are aware of it, people with a White savior complex have an underlying belief that they know best or that they have skills that BIPOC people do not have, Savala Nolan, JD, executive director of the Thelton E. Henderson Center for Social Justice at UC Berkeley School of Law, told Health.\n\nPeople with a White savior complex think \"[t]hey are somehow in the position that should enable them to have more power in solving the problem than the people who are impacted,\" said Nolan.\n\nThe White savior complex can play out in pop culture and real life. For example, in movies, you may see a White person coming to town to help \"save\" a BIPOC community—whether athletes, students, or wrongly accused prisoners.\n\nIn real life, the White savior complex often occurs when White people see the day-to-day inequities that BIPOC communities face during or after a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHistory of White Saviorism\n\nWhite saviorism is a centuries-old concept that dates back to when many White Westerners believed they inherently had the knowledge, ingenuity, and skills to solve other people's problems worldwide. Then, White saviorism mainly affected people in the developing world, particularly African people.\n\n\"I think it's been a fundamental underpinning of Western imperialism, and it's been evident in the global empire-building enterprise,\" Danielle Smith, PhD, an advisory board member of the Maxwell African Scholars Union at Syracuse University, told Health.\n\nWhite saviorism still exists around the world and within the United States. White saviorism tends to focus on providing immediate solutions, especially during humanitarian crises, to people at an individual level, said Smith.\n\nThose immediate solutions are essential because they meet urgent needs in times of crisis. Still, White saviorism does not look beyond those immediate needs. As a result, White saviorism does not address the long-term needs of the affected communities.\n\n\"I think that these solutions don't pay much attention to how complicated the interactions are between social and economic and political factors,\" noted Smith. \"Part of what that means is that White savior mentality encourages individual dependency rather than long-term community building or long-term community self-sufficiency.\"\n\nWhy It Is Harmful\n\nA person with a White savior complex may not mean any harm. Still, someone who wants to help can do more harm than good by only putting a Band-Aid on the problem. That Band-Aid will eventually come off, revealing the deeper existing barriers.\n\n\"[White saviorism is] essentially a form of blindness,\" said Smith. \"It's not going to allow you to perceive what is in front of you accurately. If you can't see it accurately, then you can't be of really profound use in solving the problem.\"\n\nWhite saviorism \"perpetuates White supremacy as the system by which we organize our society,\" added Nolan.\n\nWhite Saviorism and Health Outcomes\n\nWhether conscious or unconscious, White saviorism leads to health inequities—thus, poor health outcomes—for BIPOC people.\n\n\"Physicians typically tend to see the patient as an individual person presenting a specific illness or symptom, and they don't see the larger issues like living in poverty and living in places with high crime rates,\" added Smith.\n\nHealth inequities, including a lack of access to healthcare, may affect:\n\nAccess to health screenings\n\nThe number of people who develop illnesses\n\nThe number of people who have complications or die from preventable causes\n\nThe severity of illnesses\n\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected BIPOC people in the United States. The response was to come up with solutions to meet the needs of individual sick people.\n\nSomeone with a White savior complex might believe they've already provided a solution, then shift their focus to the next disaster. As a result, the structural barriers that put BIPOC people at a disadvantage regarding health access and outcomes are still unmet, said Smith. Long-term change cannot happen without addressing those barriers.\n\n\"These social factors impact people's health and well-being, and if healthcare providers want to treat people holistically for them to be healthy over a long period of time, you cannot only treat the symptom that they are presenting,\" explained Smith. \"That is what the White savior mentality does. It focuses on the individual and their specific symptoms [...], rather than focus on the larger systemic structural issues that cause these illnesses.\"\n\nPreventing White Savior Complex\n\nWhite people who want to help BIPOC communities first need to take a backseat, said Smith: \"Follow the lead of the people of color in the space that [you] are entering. [You] need to be willing to not be at the center of the work of the solution and to follow the advice, expertise, and request of the people who are closest to the pain and the problem.\"\n\nIt's also essential for White people's work to address structural societal issues. Instead of narrowing the focus to an individual level, think broadly and consider what systems are in place that might influence the health and well-being of BIPOC people.\n\nDo not hesitate to call out other people or organizations engaging in White saviorism, then pull them back in.\n\n\"If you have an understanding of what White saviorism is, then you are in a position to see it and to think about it,\" said Nolan. \"Hopefully, if you're working to avoid it, you're also in a position to articulate what the harm of it is, how it can be avoided, and how much more impactful whatever the work the [person or] organization is trying to do will be if [White saviorism was not at play].\"\n\nA Quick Review\n\nPeople with a White savior complex act from a position of superiority in an attempt to help BIPOC communities. In actuality, White saviorism generally ends up doing more harm than good. White saviorism fails to address systemic issues that BIPOC people face."
