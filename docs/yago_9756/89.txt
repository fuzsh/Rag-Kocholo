Directed by Alan Rudolph

(USA, 1984, 35mm)

Introduced by Roberto Tejada, University of Houston

The characters in Alan Rudolph’s multilayered romantic comedy interact within a film noir of deception, love, and sex among the night people of Los Angeles. Keith Carradine stars as a mental patient with a mysterious past who finds himself in a love triangle with a bar owner (Lesley Ann Warren) and a late-night-radio sex-advice host (Geneviève Bujold). Choose Me is a symphony of coincidence, spontaneity, and unpredictability set to the jazz sounds of Teddy Pendergrass.
