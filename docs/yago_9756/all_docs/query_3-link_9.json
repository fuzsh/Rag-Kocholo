        "text": "Alan Rudolph - Screenplays\n\nFilm director and screenwriter Alan Rudolph is regarded by many as one of the most influential pioneers of American independent cinema. His films, for which he also wrote the scripts, are known for their original, entertaining, and character-driven plots. Among Rudolph's works is Trouble in Mind (1985), a film set in a dystopian town called Rain City - a stand-in for Seattle - where the lives of eccentric gangsters and thugs intersect. The film is considered a neo-noir masterpiece. Rudolph, says SIFF Cinema, finds poetry on every dark, waterlogged corner. Other films and screenplays by Rudolph include Mortal Thoughts, The Secret Lives of Dentists, The Moderns, and Breakfast of Champions.
