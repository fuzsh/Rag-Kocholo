Interview with author.\n\n2. “True Love” was penned by local cabaret artists Phil Shallat and John Engerman, and should not be confused with Cole Porter’s tune of the same name.\n\nChapter 3\n\n1. The term is Geoff King’s, to designate the connections and arrangements (funding, distribution, etc.) between Hollywood studios and alternative “independent” filmmaking.\n\n2. For an overview of the independent industry and marketing of the 1980s, see Justin Wyatt, “Independents, Packaging, and Inflationary Pressure in the 1980s,” in A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980–1989, by Stephen Prince (New York: Scribner’s, 2000), 142–59. It’s worth noting that, although studios made more money in the 1980s than ever before, movie viewership was falling and production costs were rising. Responding to these crises, Hollywood turned increasingly to blockbusters and franchise films, a trend that has endured—indeed, flourished—well into the twenty-first century.\n\n3.

Deidre Pribram, Cinema and Culture: Independent Film the United States, 1980–2001 (New York: Peter Lang, 2002).\n\n5. David Rensin, “The Man Who Would Be Different,” American Film 11, no. 5 (March 1986): 50–54.\n\n6. Beyond definitional matters, the result of the many mergers, buyouts, and formation of new companies in the late twentieth century is that the rights of many independent films have passed hands between one company and the next, leaving directors without access to their own work for media transfers, streaming and screening venues, or revisions and adaptations. Even a titan such as John Sayles, for instance, is unable at this writing to secure rights to his film about the massacre of striking coal workers, Matewan, for plans of turning the tale into a musical.\n\nPage 138 →7. Geoff King, Indiewood, USA: Where Hollywood Meets Independent Cinema (London: I.B. Tauris, 2009), 1.\n\n8. Quoted in Pribram, Cinema and Culture, 12.\n\n9. Quoted in Michael Z. Newman, “Indie Culture: In Pursuit of the Authentic Autonomous Alternative,” Cinema Journal 48, no. 3 (Spring 2009): 17.\n\n10.

Factory, 2010).\n\n12. “Making Trouble in Mind.”\n\n13. “Making Trouble in Mind.”\n\n14. “Making Trouble in Mind.” It needs to be stressed, however, that the film includes conspicuous shots of both the Space Needle and the monorail.\n\n15. Interview with author.\n\n16. “Making Trouble in Mind.”\n\n17. “Making Trouble in Mind.”\n\n18. “Making Trouble in Mind.”\n\n19. The term also fails to consider—as all claims do that would split mainstream and independent or art cinema into distinctly separate categories—the extent to which personal vision or a particular style, imprint, or “touch” (think Lubitsch) can operate in Hollywood and dominant modes of production more generally. It is as much of a fiction to think all indies are “personal,” individual endeavors and all mainstream “impersonal” ones as it is to consider the modes of production mutually exclusive.\n\n20. Quoted in Pribram, Cinema and Culture, 12.\n\nChapter 4\n\n1. Michael Wood, America in the Movies (New York: Columbia University Press, 1975), 26.\n\n2. For some, Casablanca is less a film noir than a film made in the style of film noir.\n\n3. Quoted in Rensin, “Man Who Would Be Different,” 54.\n\n4. “Interview with Alan Rudolph” (Sunbreak).\n\n5. Neil McGlone (NeilMcGFilm), “Alan Rudolph Interviews in Vérité and Arrow Video’s Blu Ray of The Long Goodbye (1973),” There’s No Place Like Home, posted December 11, 2013, accessed April 19, 2022, https://neilmcglone.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/alan-rudolph-interviews-in-verite-and-arrow-videos-blu-ray-of-the-long-goodbye-1973/\n\nPage 139 →6.

Smith, “Alan Rudolph,” 59.\n\nChapter 5\n\n1. Solmon, “Roundtable Manners,” 40.\n\n2. In John Sayles’s Brother from Another Planet, Morton played said alien Brother. In Wanda’s Café, Solo also drops into the role of wizened elder, a widely read man, who reads his work as if he were at the side of Ferlinghetti, Corso, and Ginsberg in the 1950s. Morton, in fact, provided his own writing for the character.\n\n3. Quoted in Solmon, “Roundtable Manners,” 40.\n\n4.

Markus Nornes, email, January 2022.\n\n10. My thanks to Feiyang Zhang for these observations. Interestingly, the Ida Lupino character in The Bigamist (1953), another film noir with a love triangle, works in a Chinese restaurant. My thanks to Matthew Solomon for drawing this connection.\n\n11. My thanks to Ungsan Kim for his translations.\n\n12. The song had also appeared in Choose Me, at which point Rudolph was inspired to use it in the next film he wrote.\n\nPage 140 →13. As if to keep us from being lulled into any musical or romantic dreamworld, the latter precedes her performance of “Trouble” with a raunchy number, “True Love,” at the restaurant.\n\n14. Alan Rudolph, interview with Krin Gabbard, April 2018.\n\n15. Interview with author.\n\n16. “Conversation with Mark Isham,” Trouble in Mind (Special Edition) DVD.\n\n17.

Alberta Hunter actually wrote a piece for the film; Welcome to L.A. similarly features a song written for the film with the same name.\n\n25. Sometimes I feel like dyin’//\n\nI’m gonna lay my head\n\nOn the lonesome railroad line\n\nLet the 2:19 train\n\nEase my trouble in mind.\n\n26. Interview with author.\n\n27.

Kristofferson’s own performance of the song is brighter, with less smoky vocals whose register is scarcely lower than Faithfull’s. The piece is performed more quickly, and its central instrument is a strummed guitar, supported by harmonica, drums, and bass guitar. Overall, it creates an impression that is less melancholy than a weary voice imparting wisdom (“Gotta make your own rules, child / Gotta break your own chains”).\n\nChapter 6\n\n1. Schiff, “Rudolf.”\n\n2. Rensin, “Man Who Would Be Different,” 52.\n\nPage 141 →3. My thanks to one of the anonymous reader’s reports for this insight.\n\n4. “Making Trouble in Mind.”\n\n5. Choose Me, AR, Folder: “Choose Me.”\n\n6. “Making Trouble in Mind.”\n\n7. Rabin, “Trouble in Mind.”\n\n8. The height of entrepreneurial cynicism is that more loan shops, liquor stores, and gun stores exist than grocery stores and pharmacies in many impoverished areas of the United States—often with majority people of color.\n\n9. Interview with author.\n\n10. Martin Scorsese, AR, Box 1, Folder: Correspondence. Among the few materials in the archives signaling the politics of the era is a petition generated by Martin Scorsese and signed by Rudolph, along with many other filmmakers, that was sent to President Reagan saying they did not want their films shown in apartheid South Africa.\n\n11.

A French film movement of the 1930s that is characterized by romantic but gritty stories of regular people often down on their luck or drawn to desperate measures, with a visual style full of fog and gauze.\n\n15.
