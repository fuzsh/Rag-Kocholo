This is when the title appears in lower-case pink-and-blue neon letters (the credits continue throughout).\n\nAnd so it goes on down the block, couples coupling and uncoupling, engaging in fleeting erotic pas de deux. Little transient seductions and rebuffs occur here and there around the margins. At the corner, Eve (Leslie Ann Warren, looking ravishing in a dress about the same color as the Chevy) enters from the right, and does a quick twirl with a female friend before striding out into the street. A man approaches and they synchronize briefly, while occasional passing headlights illuminate them. He pulls back, she saunters forward, tossing back her hair to breathe in the heady aroma of the night.\n\nA couple steps and then, as if she'd just knocked back a deliciously potent cocktail, she suddenly lets loose with an ecstatic, sinuous movement of arms and hips. It lasts about five steps, as if the music were actually blowing through her, and she never breaks stride, just comes out of the movement and, head down, rummages in her purse for a (post-orgasmic?) cigarette. She approaches the woman left by the Chevy for a light, continues walking, takes a drag and exhales again into the evening air. She reaches the doorway of the club, and just as a woman (the same one she danced with at the corner) opens the door for her, headlights sweep over the entire facade of the building. It's breathtaking.\n\nBy the end of this shot, you are lightheaded, deliriously alive to the erotic potential of the night -- and the movie -- ahead. And \"Choose Me\" does not disappoint. -- JE"
