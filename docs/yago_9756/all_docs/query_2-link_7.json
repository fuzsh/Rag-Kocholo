KemperEdited byBud MolinMusic byJack ElliottDistributed byWarner Bros.\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n98 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$2.1 million[1]Box office$51 million[2]\n\nOh, God! is a 1977 American comedy film starring George Burns and John Denver. Based on the 1971 novel of the same name by Avery Corman, the film was directed by Carl Reiner from a screenplay by Larry Gelbart. The story centers on supermarket manager Jerry Landers (Denver), who is chosen by God (Burns) to spread His message despite skepticism of the media, religious authorities, and his own wife (Teri Garr).\n\nThe movie's success spawned its titular film series, which included two sequels: Oh, God! Book II (1980) and Oh, God! You Devil (1984). Both featured Burns reprising his role, but no other characters from the original story.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nGod appears as a kindly old man to Jerry Landers, an assistant supermarket manager. After a few failed attempts in trying to set up an \"interview\", God tells Jerry that he has been selected to be His messenger to the modern world, much like a contemporary Moses. Timidly at first, Landers tells his wife, children and a religion editor of the Los Angeles Times of his encounters with God and soon becomes a national icon of comedic fodder.\n\nJerry soon appears on television with Dinah Shore and describes the look God takes when he encounters him. The next day, after Jerry is stranded from a car breakdown, God appears as a taxi driver to take Jerry home, where they are met by a bunch of chanting \"religious nuts\". Before he disappears, God consoles Jerry that he has the \"strength that comes from knowing\".\n\nSkeptical at first, Landers finds his life turned upside down as a group of theologians attempt to discredit him. They challenge him to answer a series of questions in Aramaic while locked in a hotel room alone, to prove God is contacting him directly. After an agonizing wait and much to Jerry's relief, God, working as room service, delivers food to Jerry and answers the questions.\n\nAfter being sued for slander by a charismatic preacher whom God directed Jerry to call a \"phony\", Jerry decides to prove his story in a court of law. Jerry argues that if God's existence is a reasonable possibility, then He can materialize and sit in the witness chair if He so chooses. At first, God fails to appear and the judge threatens to charge Jerry with contempt for \"what you apparently thought was a clever stunt\". Jerry argues that when everyone waited a moment to see what would happen when he raised the mere possibility of God appearing in the courtroom, it proved He at least deserved the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSuddenly, without opening the doors, God appears and asks to be sworn in, concluding the procedure with \"So help me, Me. If it pleases the court, and even if it doesn't please the court, I'm God, your honor\". God provides some miracles, first in the form of a few rather impressive card tricks for the judge. Then, to help the onlookers believe, he leaves the stand, walks a few steps and, with everyone watching, disappears before their eyes. His disembodied voice then issues a parting shot: \"It can work. If you find it hard to believe in Me, maybe it will help to know that I believe in you\". After a moment, the judge calls a recess and asks both parties to join him in chambers. God's voice does not appear on the court tape recording, nor on the court stenographer's tape. The judge has no choice but to dismiss the case.\n\nSometime later, after hearing a public phone ring, Jerry meets God again. God states that He's going on a trip to spend some time with animals. Jerry expresses worry that they failed, but God compares him to Johnny Appleseed, saying he was given the best seeds and they will take root. Jerry says he lost his job and everybody thinks he's a nut, but God assures him there are other supermarkets and that he's in \"good company\". Earlier, God had told Jerry: \"Lose a job; save a world\". God prepares to leave and says He will not be coming back. Jerry then asks what to do if he needs to talk with Him. God says, \"I'll tell you what, you talk. I'll listen\". He disappears. Jerry smiles as God departs.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Burns as God\n\nJohn Denver as Jerry Landers\n\nTeri Garr as Bobbie Landers\n\nDonald Pleasence as Doctor Harmon\n\nRalph Bellamy as Sam Raven\n\nWilliam Daniels as George Summers\n\nBarnard Hughes as Judge Baker\n\nPaul Sorvino as Reverend Willie Williams\n\nBarry Sullivan as Bishop Reardon\n\nDinah Shore as Herself\n\nCarl Reiner as Dinah's Guest\n\nJeff Corey as Rabbi Silverstone\n\nGeorge Furth as Briggs\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers as Mr McCarthy, District Produce Manager\n\nTitos Vandis as Greek Bishop\n\nMoosie Drier as Adam Landers\n\nRachel Longaker as Becky Landers\n\nJerry Dunphy as Newscaster\n\nMario Machado as TV Reporter\n\nConnie Sawyer as Mrs Green\n\nJane Lambert as Mrs Levin\n\nKres Mersky as Check-out Girl\n\nByron Paul as TV Engineer\n\nHector Morales as Waiter\n\nWonderful Smith as Court Clerk\n\nMurphy Dunne as Stenographer\n\nBoyd Bodwell as Religious Fanatic\n\nZane Buzby as Girl\n\nDennis Kort as Norman\n\nBob McClurg as Mechanic\n\nCeleste Cartier as Second Check-out Girl\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nGelbart originally wanted Woody Allen to play Jerry Landers and Mel Brooks to play God but Allen declined because he was already making his own film dealing with God, Stardust Memories.[3]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was released on October 7, 1977 in 198 theaters and earned $1.9 million on its opening weekend.[2] It ultimately grossed $51,061,196 domestically,[2] making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1977.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOh, God! was a critical and commercial success. It was regarded in many reviews as one of the best films of 1977,[4][5][6] including Gene Siskel, who placed it on his top 10 list for the year. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of possible 4, praising the casting of Burns and Denver and noting that Oh God! struck the right tone by avoiding both pious religious platitudes and \"cheap shots\" about faith.[7]\n\nThe film holds a 72% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes from 29 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Oh, God!'s Biblical playfulness makes for more cute farce than divine comedy, but George Burns' sly performance as the Almighty gives this high concept gravitas\".[8]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nLarry Gelbart's screenplay received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a Saturn Award nod for Best Writing.[9] The screenplay also won the Writers Guild award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.[9]\n\nOh, God! was also awarded two Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Film and Best Actor for George Burns.[9] It received an additional nomination for Carl Reiner's direction.\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nOh, God! has become a cornerstone of the On Cinema parody film review series, appearing as a recurring joke for several years. Its filming locations are featured repeatedly in the \"On Cinema On Location\" segments, as well as a segment in the \"On Cinema Live\" touring show, where Gregg Turkington presented \"a slideshow detailing the career trajectories of actors who starred in Oh, God!\".[10] In 2004, Warner Bros. and Jerry Weintraub were reported to have closed a deal to cast Ellen DeGeneres in their remake of the film. DeGeneres was set to portray the title character.[11][12]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
