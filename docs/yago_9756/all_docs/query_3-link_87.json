        "text": "HBO announced that Euphoria will begin production on Season 3 in January 2025 – more than two years after the conclusion of Season 2.\n\nDeadline first reported in March that filming plans for the series had been pushed back, with creator Sam Levinson still working on scripts. At the time of the announcement in March, cast members were being allowed to take other jobs; and with HBO cognizant of this move, they will plan to work around certain actors’ schedules. Filming will now start at the top of next year with all of the principle cast returning, and viewers should expect a time jump to take place between Season 2 and 3. Series creator Levinson will return as writer, director and executive producer.\n\nFrancesca Orsi, EVP of HBO programming and head of HBO drama series and films, said, “I am thrilled that we are ready to begin production on Euphoria in January. We could not be happier with our creative partnership with Sam and this incredible cast. We look forward to bringing this new season of Euphoria to life for the fans.”\n\nEurophia has launched many of the primary cast members careers, including Zendaya, Sydney Sweeney, Jacob Elordi and recurring player Colman Domingo. Eric Dane, Maude Apatow, Storm Reid, Alexa Demie, Hunter Schafer, Nika King, Dominic Fike also star in the series.\n\nEuphoria originally premiered on HBO in 2019, and the second season launched in January 2022 (with two one-hour specials airing in December 2020 and January 2021.) Production on Season 3 was delayed due to the writers and actors strikes in 2023, as well as other projects from the principle cast members.\n\nEditorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com"
