        "text": "Looking for connection in a lonely night that could only exist in movies. Still perfect after all those years. Every detail, every scent of artifice just add up to more intrigue an the cast remains first rate. Between this and Trouble in Mind, Rudolph pretty much tried to reedem mainstream 80's American cinema by himself in less than 4 hours and mostly succeed.\n\nIs to screwball comedy what One from the Heart is to the musical, with hints of DePalma (or is that just a Bujold-inspired echo of Obsession?) and Hal Hartley (feel like you could find all of Trust and Simple Men in that single take of Carradine and Warren in the car, traveling back and forth, one deliriously romantic close-up to another). Pink and blue neon, psychic movie posters and Teddy Pendergrass. John Larroquette plays a bartender named Billy Ace. He rides a motorcycle. He doesn't need a helmet.\n\nCHARACTER SELECT\n\nPicky, yet lascivious, you tend to your patrons. The nightflies that float in on mauve midnights under passionate neon. Tempestuous disdain in placid desire—just another evenin’ in the city of angels walking the street: you inside, them out. For you, forbidden fruit tastes no different from any other. It’s all the same so long as the juices flow. Big ripe passionfruit or little rotten apple. Take another bite. Maybe one day you will find one that was grown with you in mind.\n\nCrazy man. Who the hell are you anyway? Spy? Motorhead? Yale professor? Or flunkie from the school of sloped floors with a tiny drain in the center? A…\n\nthe most underrated american film of all time? undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic achievements of not just the 1980s but of all time, this film is truly something special. it's the kind of film that comes along once in a lifetime to take your breath away, a pure beautiful masterpiece. will go long on this sometime soon but for now i just want to say that keith carradine is one of the greatest performers in history because he conveys so much palpable emotional and detailed character work through a shrug or his posture, even when his face isn't in the frame, he's committing himself wholly to this character of his, like he's truly becoming him, which makes the romantic gestures even more special, you really believe that he means them."
