Oh my God. Putting the show together is crazy.\n\n\"It’s so high pressure and I get very, very stressed.\"\n\nDuring a show, Adele also shared some hangover tips with her fans.\n\nThe London-born star told The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column: \"Hydrate while you dehydrate is what I like to say because I can really drink.\n\n\"I’m British. The key to being able to drink all day and all night is to have a glass of alcohol, you have a glass of water, you have a glass of alcohol, you have a glass of water.\n\n\"So you’re hydrating while you ­dehydrate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a source recently revealed that Adele plans to \"focus on her family\" in 2025.\n\nThe Grammy-winning star - who has Angelo, 11, with her ex-husband Simon Konecki - intends to put her music career on ice at the end of the year.\n\nThe insider said: \"She has had a busy few years since releasing her album '30' in 2021, and it has surpassed her expectations.\n\n\"Adele has had incredible opportunities and it’s been a dream come true. No other artist has ever done anything like this residency and she feels like it is a real moment of crowning glory.\"\n\nAdele still has a few shows to perform in Las Vegas, too, but she plans to step away from the spotlight next year.\n\nThe source added: \"It’s time to focus on her family and enjoying her life away from the spotlight again.\""
