The comeback show will be happening on 9/20 at the Showbox in Seattle. The group is also set to appear at the When We Were Young Festival. A festival in Vegas that is dedicated to emo nostalgia. During their show, it is expected that they will play their album The New Romance in full. An album that is more dedicated to the mid-’00s MySpace emo era and less to the frantic and angular stuff that they are known for."
