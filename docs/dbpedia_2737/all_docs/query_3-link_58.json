        "text": "*NOTE This is not an influence on the Grunge movement just a connection to the musical influence the beats had\n\nIn reading The Dharma Bums this week I recognized a song title of a popular Smiths song, “Pretty Girls Make Graves” in one of the Ray Smith’s narrations. In researching I found that Morrissey and Marr of The Smiths has in fact named (and written?) the song after the scene from the Dharma Bums where Ray is drinking in Japhy’s shack with his friends and a girl who he had lusted for. While researching common interpretations of the song I found that most centered on a inability to preform sexually as opposed to the situation in the Dharma Bums where the narrator, Ray Smith, hesitated to join an orgy because of his religious convictions. However it is more plausible to me that the song was a translation of the scene into music with a clever erectile dysfunction innuendo .\n\n“Pretty girls make graves” in the context of the book means that pretty girls lead to sex which leads to babies, which leads to adult life which in turn, leads to death. However, if you accept the interpretation that it is a song about sexual inadequacy, the meaning of “pretty girls make graves” changes tone to suicidal and dark. This sorrowful protagonist with no ability to get it up will be so emotionally scarred by this embarrassment that eventually it will lead to his own death. More likely the narrator is in the same position as Ray. However the last line of the song suggesting he lost his faith due to the sexual liaison suggests a deeper meaning than erectile dysfunction.\n\nThis song is so reminiscent of the writing of Kerouac. First of all the name of the band who wrote the song is The Smiths (the protagonist of The Dharma Bums is Ray Smith) which is most likely a coincidence but could also indicate that these musicians related so must to this book that they named their band after it. Additionally misogyny is almost a staple in Kerouac’s writing —Kerouac is rumored to have said the only women he ever loved was his mother— and coincidentally it is also present within the lyrics. Essentially the song says that because the girl left him for another for not having sex he lost his faith in all women and faith at all."
