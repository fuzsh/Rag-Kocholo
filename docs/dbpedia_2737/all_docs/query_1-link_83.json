        "text": "Geezer Butler talked openly about dealing with past bouts with depression in a new interview.\n\nSpeaking with TalkShopLive, Butler describes his experience with depression as “going to this awful black hole.” He also shared that writing the lyrics to Black Sabbath’s “Paranoid” was his way of venting what he was going through. (“All day long I think of things/But nothing seems to satisfy/Thing I’ll lose my mind/If I don’t find something to pacify.”)\n\nButler notes, “I mean, I wasn’t depressed all the time, but when I used to get the bouts of depression, you just couldn’t explain it to anyone, and you were terrified that you go to a mental health person, maybe, and they put you in hospital for years, in a mental institution. So you’d never go to doctors or anything like that.”\n\nFortunately, seeking medical treatment for depression doesn’t have the same stigma it had decades ago. As a result, Butler said he got the help he needed in 1999 with a diagnosis and a prescription for Prozac. After taking the prescription for six weeks, he said, “This big cloud seemed to lift off me.”\n\nA Brief History of Ozzy and Geezer’s Recent Feud & Reconciliation\n\nAnother positive thing for Butler is that his weird feud with Ozzy Osbourne appears to be in the rearview, but things between the Black Sabbath bandmates seemed awfully strange for a while.\n\nBack in June 2023, Butler released his memoir Into the Void. In the book’s epilogue, the bassist shared he and Osbourne don’t speak due to a falling out between their wives. He wrote, “Me and Ozzy are fine; it’s just that we’re both ruled by our wives. He’s got a big heart and was always there for me in times of trouble.” Apparently, a falling out between Sharon Osbourne and Butler’s wife, Gloria, has led to some tension between the Black Sabbath bandmates.\n\nDespite Butler saying he and The Prince of Darkness were “fine,” Osbourne clearly wasn’t “fine” at all about their situation.\n\nIn a November 2023 interview with Rolling Stone UK, Ozzy shared Geezer hadn’t called him at all during his many health struggles of the past five years. He added that Tony Iommi has been very supportive during his health issues. Ozzy also said that Sabbath drummer Bill Ward has been in contact, despite ongoing tension with him.\n\n“We all grew up together, and he can’t pick up the f—ing phone like a man and see how I’m doing,” said Osbourne. He added that the falling out between their wives was between the wives, not them.\n\n“Are you really going to hide behind your wife’s skirt because of that?” noted Ozzy.\n\nAfter Osbourne’s comments to Rolling Stone UK received a lot of attention, Butler took to Instagram to respond.\n\nHe wrote, “Rumour has it Ozzy is upset, saying he never received my get well messages. I made two different attempts at getting in touch during his illnesses. My first email (8 Feb, 2019) went through his office because I didn’t have Ozzy’s new number to text him. Sharon responded, but I didn’t hear back from Ozzy.”\n\nButler added, “Eleven months later (21 Jan, 2020), I emailed Sharon to check on Oz. That email went unanswered.”\n\nHe concluded, “I don’t want to engage in a tit for tat. Having made two attempts to wish Ozzy well, without a reply, I figured it best to privately keep him in my thoughts.”\n\nThe comment section of the post was filled with supportive messages. Glenn Hughes wrote, “Class, lad.” Meanwhile, Alex Skolnick wrote, “My (very) brief time in their camp was mid-90s, with you on bass, an experience I’ll always cherish. Sorry to hear the dysfunction (which you understandably stepped away from a few months later) hasn’t gone away. Well expressed, Geez.”\n\nThe Black Sabbath bassist said in an interview in May that there’s been a lot of “miscommunication” and, perhaps, some misunderstandings, too. Butler said he heard about how Osbourne told Rolling Stone that he didn’t reach out while he was dealing was his various health issues. It turns out Butler was, in fact, sending messages to Osbourne, but those messages weren’t making their way to the Prince of Darkness.\n\nButler explains, “So I went through the accountant, and he got in touch with Ozzy and said, ‘He’s just been sending you stuff. He wants to talk to you.’ And we’ve been fine since that.”\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
