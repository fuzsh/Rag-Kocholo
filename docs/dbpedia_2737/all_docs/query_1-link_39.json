        "text": "Looking over the lineup of records released by Matador Records under the “Revisionist History” banner of LP releases, one thing unifies the entire collection: they’re all absolutely killer. The form that these editions of the exalted label varies — sometimes there’s new packaging, sometimes it’s on a fancy-colored LP, sometimes it comes with a goofy picture disc shaped like a speech bubble — but each album contains something that makes it worth shining a spotlight on, whether it’s a long out-of-print gem or a career-defining masterwork. In the case of Seattle darlings Pretty Girls Make Graves and their sophomore album The New Romance, those two categories converge: not only was this the kind of record that bands work their entire lives to make, but it has been out of print since its initial release in 2003. Admittedly, it hasn’t been entirely inaccessible (the median price on Discogs for an original pressing won’t break the bank), but with the band reunited for the first time since 2007 and slated to perform The New Romance in full together at this year’s When You Were Young festival, why not take a look back at this record?\n\nPretty Girls Make Graves existed in a strange little moment in Seattle rock music. The specter of grunge still loomed large, but “rock music” had begun to splinter into bands like perennial softies Death Cab for Cutie and goofy math-rockers Minus the Bear, eventually breaking apart enough for acts like Sunn O))) and Say Hi to Your Mom to coexist within the same area. Pretty Girls Make Graves’ debut album Good Health is a solid album full of hook-y, good-but-not-great indie rock jams that feel like PGMG’s goal was to deconstruct indie rock and rebuild it just a bit different, purely to explore the sonic profile of the form and how best to work with it. Guitars and incredible drumming take preference over clear, audible lyrics, and we wouldn’t have Good Health any other way. Just a year later, The New Romance took it a step further by making something… well, something bigger, something brighter.\n\nWhich is why it should come as no surprise when The New Romance arrived and kicked off with the now-classic “Something Bigger, Something Brighter.” The drums of Nick Dewitt enter first, and then a dramatic guitar riff and some dashes of implacable noise, then the voice of former Death Wish Kids’ member Andrea Zollo joins the mix, a gentle counterpoint to the dramatic instrumentals that slowly get just a bit more complex by the moment. Then, 90 seconds in, something happens: “Something Bigger, Something Brighter” snarls to life, completely changing tracks. The bass winds itself around scuzzy sounding keyboards, Dewitt’s drum skills barreling onwards in a way that feels like there’s an edge to it. The PGMG of Good Health were a tight, more standard indie rock band, but the band of The New Romance were more dynamic, able to nail the mood of the dancy, almost dramatic “Chemical, Chemical” or the immaculate, theatrical vibes of “Holy Names” without seeming like they’re trying too hard.\n\nThe shift in the song isn’t seismic enough that it seems like a different song or anything, but it sets us up for what to expect from The New Romance, which never shies away from shifting gears and switching up the mood partway through. For one album, and just one album, Pretty Girls Make Graves were surgical enough to pull that off pretty effortlessly. Sometimes it’s like a switch being flipped, others it’s like using a dimmer — “Blue Lights” doesn’t even get so much as the tinking of a muted cymbal for a beat until a full minute in, and from there the rest of the band pushes forward, pulls back, and then surges forward again, but just for long enough to really sink its teeth into you, keeping you going. Zollo’s lyrics are the kind of early-aughts fluff that was a little too en vogue (see: basically any Interpol song), but hearing her belt out lyrics like “This tooth is ROTTEN, yank it OUT! Your words are CANCER in my mouth!” or “Baby you don’t have to be/ A picture in a magazine/ And sometimes you’re too blind to see/ Anything objectively” (or, honestly, the entirety of career-best banger “This Is Our Emergency”) makes it hard to give a shit that she wasn’t as direct or vulnerable with her songwriting as other up-and-comers of the era like Sufjan Stevens, The Wrens or The Shins. She wasn’t even bad, and in the moment, a straightforward verse like “So whisper and tell me where I went wrong/ Tell me why everything around you lost its shine/ Why nothing glows/ Tell me why you’re waiting, or what you’re waiting for/ Never seen when opportunity is at your door/ Let’s get out of this mess/ No one will even know we left/ No use in dwelling on the thing you’ll soon forget” can really hit like a tank.\n\nIn their original review of The New Romance, Pitchfork’s Nicholas B. Sylvester remarked on how supremely talented musicians often let their own abilities become their worst enemy — and how Pretty Girls Make Graves were proof of the fact that it needn’t be like that. Aside from the fact that a billion bands buck that trend by being remarkable songwriters and virtuosic instrumentalists, the long lens of history allows us to see that this wasn’t even true of the band forever; this was the apex of their career, with the band making one more record (2006’s flavorless Élan Vital) before disbanding, sending the Pretty Girls to the Grave they made. The New Romance is completely worth a loving reissue by Matador Records because of its quality, but also because it’s such a fantastic portrait of a band finding a harmonious balance between creativity and talent. Every song on The New Romance still feels vital, even if the band didn’t always feel like it."
