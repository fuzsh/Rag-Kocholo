        "text": "I am reluctant to pronounce your name,\n\nStuck here in these waters I still fight your wave\n\nI have been buried by your selfish game,\n\nI won′t forget the way you pinned me down\n\nWith or without you\n\nI am still right here,\n\nUnder your wave\n\nWithout you I am nothing,\n\nI'm all pouring rain I set my mind at ease\n\nA pretty girl will always leave a grave,\n\nSo now tell me what′s a boy supposed to do\n\nWith or without you\n\nI am still right here,\n\nUnder your wave\n\nWithout you I am nothing,\n\nI'm all pouring rain I set my mind at ease\n\nWhen all is said and all is done,\n\nYou cant go back again\n\nAnd every time you try to leave,\n\nYou end up here again\n\nWith or without you\n\nI am still right here,\n\nUnder your wave\n\nWithout you I am nothing,\n\nI'm all pouring rain I set my mind at ease\n\nWith or without you\n\nI am still right here,\n\nUnder your wave\n\nWithout you I am nothing,\n\nI′m all pouring rain I set my mind at ease.\n\nWriter(s): Arve Isdal, Thomas Tofthagen, Torkjell Rod, Kjetil Greve<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
