        "text": "It feels like just a couple of weeks ago that I was writing about the return of beloved local band Pretty Girls Make Graves and wishing they would announce a local reunion show.\n\nI’m not saying I manifested that into reality, but earlier today AEG announced a Sept. 20 Pretty Girls Make Graves show at the Showbox.\n\nThe band, which broke up in 2007, hasn’t played a show in 17 years. The Showbox gig is a warmup for their set at the When We Were Young Festival in Las Vegas where they will perform their record “The New Romance” in full.\n\nTickets for the Showbox concert cost $35 and go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. The local presale begins Feb. 14 at 10 a.m. To access the presale use the code PGMG. Tickets can be purchased through AXS."
