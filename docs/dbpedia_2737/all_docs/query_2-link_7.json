        "text": "Pretty Girls Make Graves\n\nPretty Girls Make Graves is an indie rock band, formed in Seattle in 2001, named after The Smiths song of the same name (which came from a Jack Kerouac quote). Andrea Zollo and Derek Fudesco had played together previously in the Hookers, as well as the Death Wish Kids and Area 51 along with Dann Gallucci, with whom Derek had formed Murder City Devils. Not long before the Murder City Devils disbanded, Derek and Andrea formed Pretty Girls Make Graves along with Jay, Nick and Nathan. They played the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2004."
