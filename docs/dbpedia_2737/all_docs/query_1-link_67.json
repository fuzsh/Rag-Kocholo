        "text": "The first Smiths selection from my oldest daughter, Sophia, is ‘Pretty Girls Make Graves’ from the band’s 1984 self-titled debut album.\n\nThis song finds the narrator unable to reciprocate the sexual advances of an aggressive woman because he’s either gay, asexual, impotent, or simply afraid. Morrissey has always been cagey about his sexuality, but many of his lyrics suggest he is gay. Just as many suggest he isn’t interested in men or women. This song supports both readings.\n\nThe title of this song comes from Jack Kerouac’s 1958 novel The Dharma Bums, and is spoken by a character who has opted for celibacy because sex leads to birth, which leads to suffering and death. Well, that’s one way to look at it.\n\nSophia considers The Smiths’ debut her favorite of their four studio albums. I would slot it into second or third place, depending on my mood."
