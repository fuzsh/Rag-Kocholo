"Pretty Girls Make Graves" is the fourth track off of The Smiths. The track was penned by Morrissey and composed by Johnny Marr.[1]

The title is taken from Jack Kerouac’s novel The Dharma Bums. It is a mantra used by the main character, Ray Smith, to preserve his celibacy.[2]

Interestingly enough, there was also a band that took their name after this song. They formed and ended in the 2000s, similar to how the Smiths were only around for the 1980s.[3]
