        "text": "Franchot Tone to me, was always a profoundly underrated but immensely gifted actor of the silver screen who was unable to garner the cinematic recognition that he truly deserved; he remains to this day one of my personal favorites. I’ve often enjoyed viewing Tone in many of his films, from romantic dramas and comedies to stellar classic film noir and wartime dramas; in every sense of the word, he was genuinely awe-inspiring! I did a mini marathon of his films awhile back and I wanted to share with you my insight in regards to those films in particular…..they are:\n\nFast and Furious (1939)\n\nMidnight Mary (1933)\n\nThe Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949)\n\nJigsaw (1949)\n\nToday We Live (1933)\n\nThree Comrades (1938)\n\nPhantom Lady (1944)\n\n7) Fast and Furious (1939)\n\nThis mystery/comedy classic directed by Busby Berkeley starred Franchot Tone and Ann Sothern as a crime-solving married couple who are also rare book dealers; at first I was unsure of the basis for the story to the film. It seemed more complex to me that Sothern’s character has the compelling need to feel jealous whenever her husband is around a beautiful woman…I’m pretty sure he couldn’t help himself, especially considering that Tone on & off screen was a gem to view…there was something rather unique about him! In the end, it made for a delightfully funny yet intriguing film; its not one of my favorite films of his, but I’ve deeply enjoyed seeing the chemistry between Sothern and Tone.\n\n6) Jigsaw (1949):\n\nA great film noir directed by Fletcher Markle, it stars Jean Wallace, Marc Lawrence (a deeply underrated talent of classic film noir), Robert Gist, Myron McCormick and Richard Avedon’s wife at the time actress Doe Avedon.The film also featured notable cameo appearances by the director himself, newspaper columnist Leonard Lyons, Marlene Dietrich, John Garfield, Henry Fonda, Burgess Meredith, Everett Sloane & Marsha Hunt. According to the New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther (1905-1981) who panned the film, it would seem that Jigsaw wasn’t really worth seeing, that it was sluggishly directed by Markle with the few notable stars (John Garfield is seen as a loafer, Henry Fonda as a waiter in a club, Burgess Meredith as a bartender, Marcia Hunt as a secretary and such) from his point of view, not helping the tomfooling and faintly prankish look being depicted in the film. Despite the criticism though, Jigsaw remains a film worth taking a second look and its a film noir in which I’m very honored to be a fan of! 5) Midnight Mary (1933):\n\nA stellar gem of a film that became a Pre-Code classic, this romantic drama also had touches of the infamous yet beloved gangster genre complete with mystery & intrigue. It stars Loretta Young as Mary Martin aka Midnight Mary, Una Merkel, Frank Conroy, Andy Devine & in a compelling harrowing performance as Mary’s devilishly handsome on/off again love interest Leo Darcy, actor Ricardo Cortez….who brilliantly emulates the intriguing yet malevolent persona that his character Darcy embodies, as a cold-hearted gangster who only appreciates the finer things in life. Franchot Tone gives an equally amazing performance as Tom Mannering, Jr., who becomes deeply attracted to Mary even though he is unaware of her past and Darcy’s involvement with her. All of the performances in the film are worth appreciating, especially Devine’s portrayal of Mannering’s loyal friend Sam Travers.\n\n4) The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949):\n\nAs I move into the Top 3 films of Franchot Tone’s via my mini film marathon, I can’t help but add in that it was such a difficult decision picking one in which I’ve really enjoyed viewing Tone in. This next film is a mystery classic directed by and starring Burgess Meredith along with Charles Laughton, Robert Hutton, Jean Wallace, Belita & of course Wilfrid Hyde White; it was also shot in color, which added a bit of depth and wonder to the cinematography during filming in France as well as the US. I saw The Man on the Eiffel Tower for the first time via a B-movie mystery DVD set I purchased online and I’ve enjoyed it ever since.Tone’s portrayal of Johann Radek is sinister but a sheer delight, which makes viewing this film an absolute joy!\n\n3) Today We Live (1933)\n\nFrom the brilliant director who brought such incomparable classics as Scarface, Red River, The Thing From Another World, Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday, The Big Sleep & Gentlemen Prefers Blondes into the hearts of classic film lovers everywhere comes a film that encompasses the cinematic brilliance and awe-inspiring wonder which made Howard Hawks one of classic Hollywood’s most revered directors on the silver screen…Today We Live. Starring Joan Crawford, Gary Cooper & Robert Young, this compelling romantic drama was based on the story Tournabout by the critically acclaimed writer William Faulkner. A simply amazing cast with a brilliant storyline from beginning to end, from Tone & Young’s struggle to fight for what’s right to Cooper’s passionate yearning for Crawford’s love…always a pleasure worth viewing!\n\n2) Three Comrades (1938):\n\nClosing in at number 2 is another brilliant gem from the treasure trove of films, one in which has made me fully appreciate why I’m such a huge fan of romantic classics. Three Comrades has become a venerated treasure for me and has given me an even greater appreciation for its leading lady Margaret Sullavan (another deeply underrated talent worth remembering); all 4 stars (Robert Taylor, Sullavan, Tone and Robert Young) delivered something truly extraordinary with their performances. I loved the tragic yet profound & unconditional love that blossomed immensely between Taylor and Sullavan, then there’s the onscreen commadarie shared between Taylor, Young & Tone (as if they’re telling the audience that no matter what happens, friends look out for one another through thick and thin). Masterfully directed by Frank Borzage with a superb cast that included Guy Kibbie, Lionel Atwill, Henry Hull, Charley Grapewin & Monty Woolley, its stark moving portrayal of a friendship that, through the trials and tribulations war may have impacted in its course, can still remain steadfast, resillent and stronger than ever before. A gem worth seeing in the treasure trove of classic films!\n\n1) Phantom Lady (1944):\n\nAs I’ve stated before, this was incredibly difficult for me regarding rounding out the Top 3 films of Franchot Tone’s that are my faves (especially considering that I didn’t factor in other classics like Dangerous & Advise and Consent with Lew Ayres…but was unable to because I didn’t view it nor was it added on my roster). However my next film paved a new way to an even vast appreciation & greater respect for this multi-faceted artist of the silver screen…Tone in a stellar film noir! For me, I was a bigger fan of film noir than any other genre…even disasters! I felt that I could connect with the characters onscreen, no matter how good, bad or indifferent they may be. The reason why I picked Phantom Lady as my choice of film was for a variety of reasons: First, this was the first Hollywood noir for the German-born American film director Robert Siodmak, who delivered other masterful works of film noir like The Killers and Criss Cross. Second, a very good friend of mine (Bradley Young) highly recommended me to view it of which I’ve become so grateful to him for; third, film noir icon Elisha Cook, Jr. (another underrated but exceptionally talented individual with whom I’ve come to fully appreciate also) stars in this thrilling film noir classic along with Ella Raines, Alan Curtis, Thomas Gomez, Doris Lloyd, Regis Toomey, Virginia Brissac & Milburn Stone. Finally, although he appears about midway through the film, Tone’s indelible portrayal of Jack Marlow is one of my all time favorites and for me he’s so convincing when it comes to portraying the villian. There’s a suave yet wicked attraction about him, and yet Tone is immensely versatile in his film roles…that uncanny quality about him can also be seen with his other films and not just noir. Crowther may not see Phantom Lady as highly as I do, but then again everyone has different tastes; I’d love to own Phantom Lady on DVD and make it a noteworthy addition into my cinematic collection. Currently it is on the Dark Crimes Film Noir Thrillers Vol.1 from Turner Classic Movies, but it would be wonderul to have the film released separately as a DVD or Blu-Ray format with bonus features and additional content. One day it will happen but until that time comes, I’ll always be a lifelong fan of both Phantom Lady and Franchot Tone. Thank you so very much for viewing my Marathon tribute post to the films of actor Franchot Tone & everything that he has selflessly stood for as a wondrous, gifted, impassioned and superlative individual of Hollywood’s Golden Age."
