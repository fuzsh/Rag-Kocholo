        "text": "The Franchot Tone papers span the years 1912-1972 (bulk 1948-1964) and encompass 14.5 linear feet. The collection consists of production files, television files, stage files, correspondence, subject files, financial papers, and oversize material. The production files include extensive material on THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER (1950), THE WHITE TOWER (1950) and UNCLE VANYA (1958). Also of note are original contracts for THE WISER SEX (1932) and ADVISE AND CONSENT (1962) signed by both Otto Preminger and Franchot Tone. There is also substantial material on an unrealized production called ISADORA which includes a treatment by Shirley Jackson.\n\nThe television files include a revised teleplay of “The Shape of the River” by Horton Foote for PLAYHOUSE 90 (1956-1960) as well as contracts for several television shows including BEN CASEY (1961-1966), CLIMAX! (1954-1958), PLAYHOUSE 90 (1956-1960) and STUDIO ONE (1948-1958).\n\nThe stage files include a heavily annotated script for the play “The Big Night” (1933) written by Dawn Powell and a cast including Stella Adler and Clifford Odets.\n\nThe correspondence files include a large amount of letters from Jeanie Sims, a script editor for Jack Clayton, who discusses her work, her life in London, and her love for Tone. Also of interest is the small amount of international fan mail and a fan letter from an African-American woman who had triplets and named them after Franchot Tone, Clark Gable, and the title of the stars’ respective film MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY (1935). There is also correspondence from Tone’s second wife, Jean Wallace and his sons, Pascal Franchot Tone and Thomas Jefferson Tone.\n\nOf note in the subject files are appointment books, correspondence and other material on Tone’s early days in the Group Theatre, medical records, real estate papers, and a rider for a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract.\n\nThe financial papers include matters covering taxes, the family trust, legal matters, insurance, financial statements, and bills and receipts.\n\nThe oversize material includes a floor plan for the stage production “Jason.”\n\nFranchot Tone (1905-1968) was born Stanislaus Pascal Franchot Tone in Niagara Falls, New York. His father was president of the Carborundum Company, a chemical company. Tone attended the Hill School followed by Cornell University where he became interested in theater. After graduating in 1927, he moved to New York and appeared in several plays before eventually landing the lead role of “Curly” in the 1931 production of “Green Grow the Lilacs” which would later form the basis for the musical “Oklahoma!” Around the same time, he joined the Group Theatre which was founded by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. His credits for the Group Theatre included “The House of Connelly,” “1931,” and “Success Story.”\n\nTone signed a contract with Paramount Pictures in 1931 and made his film debut in THE WISER SEX (1932) and soon thereafter signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His most notable role was in the MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY (1935) in which he co-starred with Clark Gable and earned an Oscar nomination for best actor. Tone married Joan Crawford in 1935 and they appeared in several films together, including DANCING LADY (1933), LOVE ON THE RUN (1936), and THE BRIDE WORE RED (1937) before they divorced in 1939. In 1941, he married starlet Jean Wallace.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Tone often played second leads in romantic comedies, but he gradually transitioned to more serious stage and television work as well as working behind the camera. In 1948, he co-produced THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER (1950) which was filmed on location in Paris. In 1951, Tone was embroiled in a scandal when actor Tom Neal and Tone got into a fistfight over starlet Barbara Payton whom Tone subsequently married and divorced within months. During the 1950s, his starred in several anthology series such as STUDIO ONE (1948-1958) and PLAYHOUSE 90 (1956-1960) and brought stage and television together when, as producer, he filmed a stage production of UNCLE VANYA (1958) starring himself and his fourth wife, Dolores Dorn. During the 1960s, he played the president in the Otto Preminger political thriller ADVISE & CONSENT and a doctor on the medical television drama BEN CASEY (1961-1966)."
