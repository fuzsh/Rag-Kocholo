        "text": "People say old movies aren't entertaining or relatable, but I'm totally envious of Bette Davis sitting in a Depression-era bar tossing back 10¢ shots of straight gin.\n\nBette Davis was a great actress and has flashes of greatness in Dangerous - one moment, where she is playing cards late at night with her beau, hair a mess and chewing with her mouth open, presents an angle that few leading ladies of the time would dare to take on, and she completely delivers without becoming silly. However, this film is not great or even good; it's a relatively tacky and silly melodrama with unimpressive screen chemistry and a series of grand gestures that come up short (at one point, Davis tries…\n\n“I want you.
