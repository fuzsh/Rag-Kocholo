        "text": "Tom said on 2/Apr/16\n\nFranchot Tone was 510\".\n\nSam said on 21/Nov/14\n\nHere's a photo with MacMurray and Milland from that and he does look around 5'10.5\" roughly I think.\n\nClick Here\n\nArch Stanton said on 18/Nov/14\n\nA 5'10.75 listing might be OK, but seeing him with Milland and McMurray in Thousands Cheer I think Rob's more accurate with 179. Milland really had an easy three inches on him. With Gable, that's how the difference generally looked in the film Click Here Anything in 5'10.5-5'11 range is arguable. It depends on how much of a strong 6' you view Gable, for me I think 6'0.25 more likely barefoot than 6'0.75.\n\nSam said on 18/Nov/14\n\nAccording to online, Barbara Payton went back to Neal for 4 years after 7 weeks of marriage to Tone...Neal was a shady thug and seemed it even on-screen. Tone was a likeable guy on-screen but seemed quite unlucky in love in real life.\n\nGonzalo said on 18/Nov/14\n\nTone looked around 1`80.\n\nHe was great in Three comrades, a very beautiful and unknown film.\n\nPoor Tone, was badly injured in a fight for a woman (Barbara Payton) with actor Tom Neal. I think he was even in coma. Fortunately he survived and married the girl...though it didnÂ´t last\n\nArch Stanton said on 16/Nov/14\n\nHe actually looked 5'9 range next to Erich von Stroheim in Five Graves to Cairo who was 5'6\" max, although his posture wasn't great and Erich might have had lifts to make him look a bit more imposing.\n\nArch Stanton said on 15/Nov/14\n\nLooks spot on in Star Spangled Rhythm (a great film), three inches shorter than 6'1.5\" Ray Milland.\n\nSam said on 14/Nov/14\n\nThanks for adding, Rob, another one off of Arch's old suggestions. However, at times I think he'd be a proper 5'11\".\n\nw/ 5'11\" listed Robert Taylor, Tone seems to edge him out:\n\nClick Here\n\nw/ his wife for a time 5'4\" listed (and presumably always heeled) Joan Crawford:\n\nClick Here\n\nhus height is variable next to Clark Gable with one or the other having terrain advantage:\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nArch Stanton said on 14/Nov/14\n\nIt occurred to me he looks a bit like Zach Morris from Saved by the Bell!"
