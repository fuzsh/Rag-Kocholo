Sylvan Simon, and starring Franchot Tone as Stuart Bailey.[1][2][3] The character of Stuart Bailey was later portrayed by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. in the television series 77 Sunset Strip.[4]\n\nA wealthy politician, Ralph Johnson, hires detective Stuart Bailey to investigate his missing wife's background. Bailey discovers that the wife had been a dancer under her maiden name of Jane Breeger and had left her Oregon home town with Buster Buffin, a nightclub entertainer, who says Jane changed her name to Janie Joy and enrolled at UCLA. Buffin is killed before Bailey can question him further.\n\nNorma Shannon shows up, looking for her sister Jane, but when Bailey shows her a photograph of the missing woman, Norma says it's not her. Bailey learns that the wife had used stolen papers from a girlfriend to enter college after she stole $40,000 from the club where she worked, owned by a man named Keller.\n\nThe detective eventually learns that Johnson had discovered her past and, in order to avoid a scandal, had hired Bailey as part of an elaborate scheme to kill his wife and frame the detective.\n\nFranchot Tone as Stuart Bailey\n\nJanet Blair as Norma Shannon\n\nJanis Carter as Mrs. Caprillo aka Jane Breeger aka Janie Joy\n\nAdele Jergens as Boots Nestor\n\nGlenda Farrell as Hazel Bixby\n\nSteven Geray as Keller\n\nTom Powers as Ralph Johnson\n\nLynn Merrick as Mrs. Johnson\n\nJohn Ireland as Reno\n\nSid Tomack as Buster Buffin (uncredited)\n\nDonald Curtis as Martin\n\nEduardo Ciannelli as John Vega Caprillo\n\nRobert Barrat as Lt.

Huggins later created numerous landmark television series such as Maverick starring James Garner, The Fugitive starring David Janssen, The Rockford Files starring Garner, and 77 Sunset Strip starring Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. as Stuart Bailey. I Love Trouble was Huggins' first brush with making narrative film.\n\nIn Huggins' Archive of American Television interview, he notes that I Love Trouble was somehow lost and had not been seen anywhere for decades and never run on television, but the film has since been found and screened in venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It was shown on the Turner Classic Movies show 'Noir Alley' with Eddie Muller on September 24, 2022.\n\nList of American films of 1948\n\nPublic domain film\n\nList of films in the public domain in the United States"
