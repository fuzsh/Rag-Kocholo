        "text": "Movies are usually flocked by audiences because of the “love team” acting in it (admit it, guys!). Yes, people see films because of their stories, but actors and actresses who portray lovers are very important in the success— or failure— of a picture.\n\nJoan Crawford, as one of Hollywood’s long-standing stars, definitely had her share of various leading men. From the studios’ top actors to not-so-famous ones, Joan has hugged, kissed, made love with (at least on-screen), and teamed up with them all.\n\nTake a short trip down memory lane and discover some of Joan’s most memorable (and notable) leading men:\n\n(Harry Langdon)\n\n(Norman Kerry)\n\n(Lon Chaney)\n\n(William Haines)\n\n(John Gilbert)\n\n(Ramon Novarro)\n\n(Johnny Mack Brown)\n\n(Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.)\n\n(Robert Montgomery)\n\n(Of course, the Gable)\n\n(Nils Asther)\n\n(William Powell)\n\n(Franchot Tone)\n\n(Spencer Tracy)\n\n(James Stewart)\n\n(Melvyn Douglas)\n\n(John Wayne)\n\n(Fred MacMurray)\n\n(Zachary Scott)\n\n(John Garfield)\n\n(Van Heflin)\n\n(Henry Fonda)\n\n(Dana Andrews)\n\n(Jack Palance)\n\n(Sterling Hayden)\n\n(Jeff Chandler)\n\n(John Ireland)\n\n(Cliff Robertson)\n\n(Rossano Brazzi)\n\nThat’s not all! Haha. There are still a few who I left out… I’ll try to put them here if I have more time.\n\nHappy blogging (and fangirling!)\n\n(Photos from Joan Crawford Best)\n\n“Love is a fire. But whether it is going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell.”\n\nJoan Crawford\n\nJoan’s love life is a very fascinating subject to look upon. As a young flapper in the 20s, like most women, she had flings and short-lived romances with boys her age (or sometimes, even a bit younger than her). As a champion Charleston dancer, she frequented places where she could dance— and socialize with dappers.\n\nThis post is about Joan’s husbands, just a quick tour in each marriage. I won’t bore you all with the details, because you can always read more on the Internet.\n\nIn 1929, at age 23, she married for the first time. With who? A young actor named Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.— who happened to be part of Hollywood’s elite family.\n\nThey were married for four years, a length that will, weirdly, continue until Joan’s last marriage. They were both young and happy, and although Doug was younger than Joan (he was 19) and his stepmother, esteemed actress Mary Pickford, didn’t approve of Joan, they still lived an amazing married life… that is, until their divorce in 1933.\n\nHusband number two is stage and screen actor Franchot Tone. He came from a prominent family, and was well-educated and highly respected. They were married in 1935 and divorced in 1939 (told you, four years).\n\nJoan and Franchot fairly contributed to each other’s growth, both personally and professionally. In Franchot’s part, he introduced Joan to the ropes of radio and encouraged her to spread her wings a bit. Joan also learned a lot about Franchot’s well-mannered upbringing. In return, she let him in on her movie projects, letting him co-star with her in films like The Gorgeous Hussy (1936), Love on the Run (1936) and The Bride Wore Red (1937).\n\nIn the 1940s, Joan seemed to have matured already… but still in search for her one true love. Then she met B actor Phillip Terry.\n\nAfter only six weeks of dating, they were married in 1942. Joan felt that her newly-adopted children, Christina and Christopher, needed a loving father, and she mistook the comfort she felt for love. She later said, “I realized I had never loved him. I think I’ve owed him an apology from the first.” They divorced after— you guessed it— four years, in 1946.\n\nJoan did find her one true love… but it would be four years later. In 1950, she met Pepsi-Cola main man, Alfred Steele, and the two were married in 1955.\n\nSpeaking of her union with Al, Joan said it was her happiest marriage. “He was so right for me in every way,” she said. Theirs was a mature, happy, and fruitful love story— it was when she married Al that Joan decided to turn a new leaf and became hands-on in the Pepsi-Cola business, temporarily leaving her acting career behind. Unfortunately, their happiness was cut short when, in 1959, Al died of a heart attack. Oddly, their marriage lasted the usual Joan course of four years.\n\nTold you, Joan’s love life was a colorful one.;)\n\nHappy blogging (and fangirling!)\n\n(All photos from Joan Crawford Best)\n\nBette Davis and Joan Crawford’s much-publicized feud is one of Hollywood’s most famous scandals ever.\n\nThey were two legendary queens with almost the same qualities (they’re both Aries; strong and independent, but weak and in desperate need of love) and personal battles (both have daughters whom they had problems with, and were married more than twice). Their feud became bigger than them— sprawling a number of controversies and exchange of insults over the years.\n\nThis so-called “queen rivalry” became worse when they were teamed up in the 1962 classic Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? People were shocked and glad at the same time; seeing the queens portray their disdain at each other on the big screen sure was a delight to audiences.\n\nBut, as much as people love a juicy gossip, I can’t bring myself to believe that Joan and Bette really hated each other. I think this whole feud was just a lie— a story cooked up by reporters to milk some cash.\n\nI’m not saying that they didn’t hate each other at all, though. Sure, they weren’t the best of chums, but they were casual to each other. They respected each other’s craft and talents. But going back… they weren’t really good friends, not as good as Joan and Barbara Stanwyck, or Bette and Olivia de Havilland.\n\nWhat was the reason behind their feud? It isn’t even clear up to now. Some sources claim that Franchot Tone (Joan’s second husband and Bette’s co-star in Dangerous (1935)) was the root cause of their hatred to each other, because at the time, Bette was in love with Franchot, who was pursuing Joan then (and will soon marry).\n\nHowever, some say that the reason why they hate each other is because of Joan’s upstaging in a party for newcomers in the mid-30s. Other sources state that it was because of their clashing personalities (just because they’re so alike).\n\nNobody really knows how their “feud” began. But one thing’s for certain: it’s one of those Hollywood things that people will never, ever forget.\n\nI just wish, at some point, they became close friends… don’t we (OH fans) all? ❤\n\nHappy blogging (and fangirling!)\n\n(Photos from Joan Crawford Best, Cake Chooser, Jake Weird and Daily Mail)"
