        "text": "For fans of silent films, evil ventriloquists and crazy clowns: Though he’s usually thought of as a horror movie star, Lon Chaney was one of the great actors of the silent era. Raised by deaf parents, he perfected pantomime techniques that still have yet to be equaled.\n\nThere’s not a lot of Chaney on DVD, but Warner Archives (wbshop.com) has released six of Chaney’s less horrific films as part of its DVD-on-demand program. ($19.95 each). Of special note are two versions of “The Unholy Three,” a thriller where Chaney plays nefarious ventriloquist Dr. Echo, who leads a gang of criminals that also includes a cigar-smoking little person who pretends to be a baby. One version, directed by the legendary Tod Browning, is silent; the other, released weeks before Chaney’s death in 1930, is his only sound film.\n\nEven better is Chaney’s 1924 film “He Who Gets Slapped,” in which he plays a lab assistant who loses his girl, loses his mind and becomes a masochistic circus clown. Co-starring John Gilbert and Norma Shearer and sporting some surreal imagery (with plenty of creepy clowns), it’s also the first movie to feature that legendary MGM lion.\n\nFor fans of weird old movies — really weird old movies: Speaking of Warner Archives, that’s also where you can get your hands on “Madame Satan,” a truly odd 1930 musical directed by Cecil B. De Mille. Zip through the opening hour or so, which features some by-the-numbers romantic intrigue involving a rich guy, his wife, his friend and his girlfriend. Instead, skip right to the scene where everyone boards a private dirigible (!) moored in Central Park (!) for a crazy costume party (!). Just when you’re adjusting to the girlfriend auction, the “Salute to Electricity” and the spurned wife’s revealing “Madame Satan” outfit, lightning strikes and everyone has to parachute back down into Manhattan. Trust me — old movies are stranger than you can imagine. (It’s $24.95)\n\nFor fans of TV stars whose shows have gone away: It’s always satisfying to see TV actors you like find another worthwhile project.\n\nThat’s one reason “Men of a Certain Age” is entertaining. After years of “Everybody Loves Raymond,” “Quantum Leap” and “Homicide: Life on the Streets,” Ray Romano, Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher have become familiar faces, and it’s nice to see them return to the airwaves in “Men” — a little heavier and a little grayer, maybe, but still worth watching. Here they play a trio of lifelong friends dealing with (what else?) getting older and moving on. The second season starts Monday, but the first is on DVD ($39.98). Buy it for the aging fella on your Christmas list.\n\nFor fans of Charles Laughton, the actor: “Mutiny on the Bounty,” the 1935 movie that stars legendary actor Laughton as cruel Captain Bligh, is now available on Blu-ray. It’s a great old movie, with convincing settings, a smart script and a powerful adversary in the form of Clark Gable’s mutinous Fletcher Christian. (Both of them, along with co-star Franchot Tone, were nominated for Oscars, and the movie won Best Picture.) The disc ($34.99) contains some fun extras, including a vintage 1935 short subject, and the booklike packaging makes it perfect for stuffing a stocking.\n\nFor fans of Charles Laughton, the director: Laughton only directed a single movie, but it’s a doozy. Released in 1955, “Night of the Hunter” is — no kidding — one of the great American films, combining elements of horror, comedy, film noir and folklore to create something unique.\n\nRobert Mitchum plays a murderous preacher, “LOVE” and “HATE” tattooed across the knuckles of his hands, chasing two kids across the Depression-era landscape. Full of breathtaking imagery and magical moments, it’s like nothing you’ve ever seen. The new Criterion edition ($39.95 DVD, $49.95 Blu-ray) includes a remastered print, a documentary, footage of the filmmaking and more."
