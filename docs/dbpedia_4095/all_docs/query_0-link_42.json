        "text": "Franchot Tone:\n\nI have always adored Bette Davis. So it was pretty much impossible for me to ignore the mountain of bad press surrounding the ancient Hollywood feud between Bette and Joan Crawford. Much to my fiendishly delighted surprise, I was ecstatic to learn that the onset of bad blood between these two grande dames of the silver screen could be traced back to the love of one man and to a rebuffed lesbian overture.\n\nHere are highlights from the rumors as they have been recounted over the years. Please read it all with a grain of salt and a lot of humor.\n\nThere have been varied reports that Joan Crawford was an aggressive bi-sexual who, upon their meeting in 1935, was absolutely fixated on wooing and winning Bette Davis. When Bette rejected Joan's advances, Joan promptly married the man Davis was in love with at the time, Franchot Tone. This shrewd move of revenge sparked a feud that lasted for more than five decades.\n\n\"She took him from me,\" Davis bitterly spewed in 1987, remembering the first love of her life, the suave and debonaire, upper crust New York born, Cornell University educated Tone. \"She did it coldly, deliberately and with complete ruthlessness. I have never forgiven her for that and never will.\" When she uttered these words, Crawford had been dead for ten years, and Davis, gaunt and wizened from a stroke and a mastectomy, was almost 80. Yet, her rank animosity and hatred remained as intense as ever.\n\nThis amazing saga of love and possession began when Bette Davis was 27, and had been cast by her studio at Warner Brothers in the role that was to win her the first of her two Best Actress Oscars. In the melodrama “Dangerous,” Davis plays Joyce Heath, opposite a tall, dark and attractive 30-year-old actor named Franchot Tone. Davis had been married for three years at that time to her high school sweetheart, the musician Harmon Oscar (\"Ham\") Nelson.\n\nNelson was not very successful in his career, and spent long periods away from home touring in an orchestra. The marriage between the two lacked passion and was already on the verge of failure. Within a few days of commencing work on “Dangerous,” everyone on the set realized how magnetically Davis was attracted to Franchot Tone. Years later Davis would state, \"I fell in love with Franchot, professionally and privately. Everything about him reflected his elegance, from his name to his manners.\"\n\nThere was only one problem. Joan Crawford, MGM's reigning sex symbol, recently divorced from Hollywood's dashing crown prince, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., had gotten her claws into Tone before Bette had a chance. Davis, trained for the theatre, saw herself as an actress. She considered Crawford \"a glamour puss,\" whose success depended entirely on her looks.\n\nBette also looked down on Joan disparagingly believing that the bombshell used sex to advance her acting career. \"She slept with every star at MGM,” Davis alleged later,\" of both sexes.\" There was some truth in this as more than a few of Crawford's leading men had succumbed to her sexual magnetism.\n\nTruth be known, the vixen Joan also counted several female stars, including Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Barbara Stanwyck and later purportedly Marilyn Monroe, among her lovers.\n\nIt was rumored that Crawford would have liked to add Davis to her list of female conquests. \"Franchot isn't interested in Bette,\" she insisted at one point, \"but I wouldn't mind giving her a poke if I was in the right mood. Wouldn't that be funny?\"\n\nWhen Crawford first entertained Franchot at her Hollywood home, he found her in the solarium, tanned from head to foot and naked. According to friends and neighbors, Tone did not emerge from the solarium until nightfall.\n\n\"He was madly in love with her,\" Davis admitted. \"They met each day for lunch... he would return to the set, his face covered with lipstick. He made sure we all knew it was Crawford's lipstick.” Apparently, he was honored that this great star was in love with him. “I was jealous, of course,\" Bette disclosed.\n\nDuring the filming of “Dangerous,” Crawford announced her engagement to Tone. To Davis's dismay and fury, they married in New Jersey soon after the film wrapped. The hostility between the two women surfaced at the Oscars, where Davis was nominated as Best Actress. Doubting she would win, Bette wore a simple navy blue dress to the ceremony.\n\nAs Bette's name was announced as the winner for Best Actress, Franchot Tone - ever the gentleman and no doubt genuinely delighted for his female costar - leapt to his feet and embraced her while his newlywed wife remained seated, keeping her back to Davis. Follwing an awkward moment of silence, Franchot finally said, \"Darling!\" imploring Joan to politeness. Turning her head, the immaculately groomed and spectacularly gowned Crawford looked Davis up and down and then observed acidly, \"Bette Dear! What a lovely frock.\"\n\nBoth women would marry four times each. By the time Davis won her second Best Actress Oscar for “Jezebel” in 1938, Bette had secured her divorce from Ham Nelson. And Joan had promptly discarded hapless Franchot, in similar fashion to the quick shift she'd made of her first marriage to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in 1933, all this setting the table for Joan to land dreamy looking hubby #3 Phillip Terry by 1943.\n\nFor Davis, this second Oscar win would cinch her status as the top box office star at Warner Bros, not to mention that the incomparable Miss Davis was much more suitably attired for her \"Jezebel\" win. Second time's the charm, as they always say. (Who are \"they\" anyway?) Unfortunately, second husbands were not thusly charmed for either of these grande dames of Hollywood.\n\nStill the mid-1940s were to bring a downswing in Davis's popularity, threatening her position as queen of the Warner Bros studio. As Bette's star began to dim, Crawford moved from MGM to Warner, where she demanded the dressing room right next door to that Davis had occupied for all her years as the reigning queen.\n\nWith \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945), her first major film role for Warners, Crawford ecstatically upstaged Davis by winning the Best Actress Oscar, whereupon the studio renegotiated her contract signing her for seven additional years at $200,000 a film.\n\nOf interesting note, Joan Crawford was not present at the Academy Awards ceremony to accept her Oscar for Best Actress that year. Jittery nerves (or a thimble-full too much vodka) got the better of Joan prompting her to feign illness and stay home in bed on Oscar night. Meanwhile she stealthfully monitored the show on the radio. Obviously, the announcement of her victory over her contenders Ingrid Bergman, Greer Garson, Jennifer Jones, and Gene Tierney provided the prescribed anecdote for Joan's ailments. Fully recovered, she ushered the press into the sanctity of her bedroom. There she triumphantly accepted her Oscar wearing lavish lace & silken lingerie boudoir attire that put Bette Davis' first Oscar win frock to shame all over again.\n\nDavis was aghast. Having watched helplessly as Crawford stole the love of her life, she now looked on as her rival took her Hollywood crown. Crawford allegedly made a series of lesbian overtures to Davis while at Warners, all of which were rebuffed by Bette with hilarity. Hearing that Crawford had told gossip columnist Louella Parsons that she and Bette might even do a picture together, Davis snarled in retort, \"When Hell freezes over.\"\n\nTo another studio observer, Davis vowed, \"I wouldn't piss down Joan Crawford’s throat if her guts were on fire!\" Yet by the early 1960s, with both stars now in their 50s, it seemed these two star-crossed actresses were seen increasingly as box office poison. It was Crawford who came to her rival's rescue by finding the novel that teamed them both in the most sensational comeback in cinema history, “What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?” (1962).\n\nIn this cult horror classic, Davis was cast as Baby Jane Hudson, a demented alcoholic former child star, who supposedly crippled her sister Blanche in a car accident. Crawford plays the anemically wheelchair-ridden sister, Blanche Hudson, an aging Hollywood movie queen. Jack Warner, the former studio boss of both Davis and Crawford, refused to finance the film, commenting, \"I wouldn't give you one dime for those two washed-up old bitches.\"\n\nAs Davis later recounted on the talk show circuit, studio after studio rejected their Baby Jane movie project, telling producer-director Robert Aldrich, \"If you get rid of those two old broads and sign some real box office names, we'll give you the money.\" But Aldrich went ahead on a modest budget with a tight six-week shooting schedule which eventually led to box-office gold.\n\nOn set, observers noticed Davis constantly needling Crawford, running her pen through the script. \"Whose dialogue are you cutting, Bette?\" Crawford would ask. \"Yours!\" would snap Davis.\n\nWhen Crawford, the recent widow of Pepsi-Cola president Alfred Steele, provided the set with a Pepsi cooler, it was widely known that Joan's bottle of Pepsi, always at her elbow, was half-full of vodka. \"That bitch is loaded half the time!\" Bette raged. \"How dare she pull this crap on a picture with me? I'll kill her!\"\n\nWhen filming the kicking scene, Davis's shoe touched Crawford's scalp and Bette innocently claimed it was an accident. Crawford, however, soon evened the score. In a later scene where Baby Jane has to drag her crippled sister from the bed, Crawford concealed a weightlifter's belt lined with heavy lead under her dress.\n\nBette Davis, struggling to lift her and her hidden excess weights, yelled out in pain: \"My back! Oh, God! My back!\" Joan Crawford calmly got to her feet and strolled off to her dressing room, smiling.\n\nWhen the film was released, both stars shared in the profits in lieu of upfront salary, and they each made a fortune. Davis was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, but Crawford was not. Following the nominations, Davis claimed that Crawford campaigned to prevent her from winning the Academy Award.\n\nAnd as fate would have it at the Oscars ceremony that year, Anne Bancroft bested Davis and won the Best Actress award for her role as Annie Sullivan in \"The Miracle Worker.\" When Bancroft's name was announced as Best Actress, Bette bitterly recalled \"I will never forget the look she [Joan] gave me. It was triumphant. It clearly said, 'You didn't win, and I am elated!'\" Ironically, Crawford strolled past Davis in the wings onto the stage in order to accept the Oscar on behalf of the absent Bancroft.\n\nTo say that Bette was livid is to underestimate the full venom behind her fury. Two years later, when Robert Aldrich tried to team Davis and Crawford in another film, “Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte, (1964) the hatred between the two strong willed women defeated him.\n\nSupposedly, Davis assembled the cast and crew, minus Crawford, for photos in which they all drank Coca-Cola, Pepsi's rival product and a clear slap in the face to Crawford dead Pepsi president husband.\n\nCrawford, perhaps this time truly overwhelmed by Davis's hostility, recalcitrantly claimed to have pneumonia and withdrew from the film.\n\nJoan was replaced by Olivia de Havilland who was old & dear friends with Bette Davis.\n\nIn 1968, the feud re-surfaced when Davis learned that Tone, the love of her life and a chronic chain-smoker, was dying from lung cancer. Crawford took her ex-husband into her nine-room New York flat and nursed him until his death, even supervising the scattering of his ashes. \"Even when the poor bastard was dying, that bitch wouldn't let him go,\" seethed Davis. \"She had to monopolize him even in death.\"\n\nOn March 1, 1977, the American Film Institute honored Davis with its Lifetime Achievement Award. Crawford neither attended nor watched the ceremony on television. Just a few short months thereafter, on May 10th, the legendary Joan Crawford died at her New York apartment. She was 73. Her death certificate officially lists \"acute coronary occlusion\" as the immediate cause of death. The real cause is said to have been liver cancer, although Joan had quit drinking two years earlier.\n\nNo tribute and no word of regret came from Davis, and she went to none of the memorial services for Crawford. In private, however, during a subsequent television screening of one of Crawford's old films, Davis reportedly stared blankly at her rival's striking features before observing, \"That dame had a face.\"\n\nAt the following year's Academy Awards, during which Davis was a presenter, the wide eyes of Joan Crawford, the ultimate movie star, filled the screen to uproarious audience applause. Looking directly into the monitor, Davis paused and said in her distinctive quipped New England dialect, \"Poor Joan, gone but not forgotten. Bless you!\"\n\nIn her Will, Joan Crawford disinherited her adopted daughter Christina and her adopted son Christopher. A year later, Christina responded with the book “Mommie Dearest,” painting her movie star mother as a drunken, abusive, sadistic, beastly woman. \"I don't blame the daughter, don't blame her at all,\" commented Davis. \"One area of life Joan should never have gone into was children. I've never behaved like that... Well, I doubt that my children will write a book.\"\n\nJust like Crawford before her, Davis disinherited her daughter. The similarities between the two stars may have been too great for Davis to confront. To the end of her days, the mere mention of Crawford triggered a bitter tirade from Davis.\n\nIn 1987, during the filming of one of her final movies “The Whales Of August,” Davis once again started abusing her dead rival to the cast and crew. Director Lindsay Anderson slammed his hand on the table and told her that Joan had been a personal friend of his and he wasn't going to listen to any more beratement from Davis. Banging her fist down even harder and raising her voice, Bette delivered the final comment on her adversary. \"Just because a person's dead,\" she said, \"doesn't mean they've changed.\"\n\nAnd then of course, there's the Hollywood urban legend that Bette Davis once said on the Dick Cavett show, “They say you should always speak good of the dead. . . . Joan’s dead. That’s good.” Bette Davis herself died on October 6, 1989, at the age of 81."
