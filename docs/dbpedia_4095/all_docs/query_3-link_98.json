        "text": "Mormon Story\n\nZeb sides with the Sioux after the Russian incident triggers a war - and the clash leads to a great leader's sacrifice. Luke's feelings for Hillary Gant intensify, but when her father learns of Luke's past, he asks Luke to leave. Laura accepts a marriage proposal, while Luke finds himself forced to join a thieving band of ex-Confederates.\n\nThe Living Legend, Pt. 1\n\nHumanity is threatened with annihilation when Adama engages in a fierce conflict with the hot-blooded commander of another battlestar, who's obsessed with leading both ships in a suicidal attack on the Cylons. In \"The Living Legendâ - Part I, a dangerous deep space probe leads Apollo and Starbuck to an incredible encounter with the battlestar, Pegasus, her 220-spaceship fleet, and Commander Cain, the greatest military commander in the history of the Colonial government. Excitement runs high as the two intergalactic fleets merge in celebration. When Cylon forces discover the two fleets, Commander Cain wants to meet them in battle rather than try to outrun them, which leads to a power struggle between Adama and Cain.\n\nThe Living Legend, Pt. 2\n\nSurrounded by Cylon warships, Commander Adama reluctantly joins forces with the glory-hungry Commander (played by guest star Lloyd Bridges) of the battlestar Pegasus in a desperate surprise attack on their Cylon enemies. In \"The Living Legend\" - Part II, Adama must combine his military expertise with the daredevil heroics of battlestar Commander Cain in a death struggle with the maniacal Alliance armies. While a specialized team of paratroopers secures the fuel depot at Cylon headquarters on the planet Gomoray, the star ship Pegasus streaks off into certain destruction. Luring the batwinged robot battalions away from the Galactica and her vigil over the fleetâs defenseless tankers, the Pegasus and her hot-blooded Commander head right into an explosive laser confrontation with Cylon base ships."
