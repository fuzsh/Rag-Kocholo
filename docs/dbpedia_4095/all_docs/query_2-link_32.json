The mystery deepens when Bailey shows Norma Jane's photograph and she informs him that the woman pictured is not her sister. Although Bailey is suspicious of Norma's motives, he finds himself falling in love with her. Bailey becomes more confused when Martin, a chauffeur employed by the prominent John Vega Caprillo and his glamorous wife, offers him a bribe to drop the investigation. When Bailey questions the Caprillos about the bribe, however, they disclaim any knowledge of the offer. Soon after, Bailey receives a mysterious phone call notifying him that Mrs. Johnston has been murdered and that her body can be found under a pier on the beach. Bailey hurries to the pier, and later, when the police find Bailey's monogrammed pen near the corpse, they arrest the detective for murder. On the way to police headquarters, Bailey escapes with the help of his secretary, Hazel Bixby. Upon returning to his house, Bailey finds Mrs. Caprillo waiting to talk to him. Their conversation is interrupted by the appearance of Keller, who identifies Mrs. Caprillo as the real Jane Breeger. Keller then reveals that he had been searching for his missing wife Ellen, who after absconding with $40,000 of his money, assumed the name of Jane Breeger and even used Jane's high school diploma to gain admittance to UCLA before her marriage to Johnston. Piecing together the clues he has gathered, Bailey proves that the murderer is Johnston, who hired Bailey to establish his wife's sordid past, hoping to frighten her into leaving him. When that strategy failed, Johnston murdered her to protect his career. With the case solved, Bailey asks Norma to marry him.\n\nLess"
