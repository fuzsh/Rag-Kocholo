        "text": "COMMUNIQUES to the effect that \"Uncle Vanya,\" which opened at the Baronet last night, is the first of Chekhov's plays ever to be filmed here, should be of interest only to the archivists. Researchers may even scotch this theory. The simple fact is that in putting a superb set of performances on permanent record, Pranchot Tone and his fellow players and associates have contributed a solid and genuine legacy to the arts and devotees of theatre everywhere.Since they obviously are dedicated people, they unfortunately photographed, almost literally and with practically the identical cast, the drama they staged early in 1956 at the Fourth Street Playhouse. And, sadly enough, a viewer must repeat in this case that the film and drama media are not the same. What is moving and explosive behind the footlights is not necessarily action-laden on the screen.This is a major fault of this film edition of \"Uncle Vanya.\" What Chekhov has to say is as penetrating and indelible today as it was six decades ago. But his dissections of a society given to much insight often emerges as placid, discursive debate, which, in itself, is fine but hardly constitutes an expert use of film.Writing before the turn of this hectic century, Chekhov, a medical man who had no help from Freud, was able to pinpoint masterfully many of his fellow man's imperfections. It is no secret at this late date that the world-weary and frustrated middle-class Russians who are cast together in a country house are plagued by ennui, illusions and misconceptions. Although they are well-meaning, gentle folk, they are scientifically flayed by the good doctor so that even a layman can see the causes of their tempers and their ills and relate to them.Out of this seeming ennui, however, Chekhov and, more to the point, the cast, have derived a spiritual turbulence that satisfies the intellect. Mr. Tone, as the middle-aged country doctor torn by the discovery of his love for the beauteous young wife of the garrulous and pompous aged professor and his hate of the wastefulness of his compatriots, contributes a thoughtful, sensitive and wholly striking portrayal. Although he knows it is the fate of intelligent men to be called \"odd,\" he is lucid and straight about his approach to truth. It is a subdued but shining performance that registers just as clearly as Chekhov's words.George Voskovec's Uncle Vanya is a cameo of restrained comedy and poignant frustration. As the manager of the estate, who knows his love for the wife of the professor is futile, he is, nevertheless, a man moved enough to cry out in rewarding passion against a wasted life. Although Dolores Dorn-Heft (Mrs. Tone in private life), is blonde, lissome and worthy of all this attention, she is no mere posturing pea-hen. She makes real her confession that her marriage to her aged spouse was well-meant at first but is now a boring mockery. Miss Dorn-Heft is guilty of some lapses but her delivery is, in most cases, genuine and forceful.Clarence Derwent is excellent as the fatuous, verbose and whining professor whose world is encompassed only by his needs. Peggy McCay, as his spinster daughter, who loves the doctor from afar, distills the essential sadness of Chekhov's biting commentaries. And, Gerald Hiken, as the impecunious, comic but terrified hanger-on; Mary Perry, as the pious, steadfast aged nurse, and Shirley Gale in the brief role of the mother, give substance to parts that are subordinate but important to Chekhov's comedy and drama.These, as has been noted, are professional performances that are a credit to the playwright. But in their devotion to the master's blueprint they seem to have forgotten that the movie medium demands movement. In this largely static interpretation they have done wonders for the intellect but little that is visually striking.\n\nThe CastUNCLE VANYA; adaptation of the Chekhov play translated by Stark Young; directed by John Goetz and Franchot Tone; produced by Mr. Tone and Marion Parsonnet; presented by The \"Uncle Vanya\" Company, Inc.
