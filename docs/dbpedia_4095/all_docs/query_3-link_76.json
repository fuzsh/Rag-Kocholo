        "text": "Joan made over 83 films from 1925 to 1970, which are listed below chronologically, along with US premiere date, studio, role played, general notes, and DVD/VHS availability. (Film release dates are from the AFI or IMDb; DVD/VHS info from Amazon.com.)\n\nClick on a title to go to this site's page for that film, which will have more complete information, including reviews, full cast listing, and photos of movie posters, lobby cards, sheet music and DVD/VHS covers, etc. (From the individual film page you can also link to this site's encyclopedia entry and page for photos from each film.)\n\nAQuick Guide to My Reviews/Reader Reviewsfollows the main chart.\n\nA general Film Triviasection follows theQuick Guide, with sections on Most Frequent Co-stars, Most Frequent Directors, andThe Shopgirl Myth.\n\nSee alsothe separate page for Joan's MGM and Warners box-office receipts, as well as for info on Joan's box-office rankings for various years from 1928 through 1952.\n\nJoan's Most Frequent Co-Stars\n\nClark Gable.8 films (Dance, Fools, Dance, 1931; Laughing Sinners, '31; Possessed, '31;Dancing Lady, '33; Chained, '34; Forsaking All Others, '34;Love on the Run, '36;Strange Cargo, '40)\n\nFranchot Tone. 7 films (Today We Live, 1933; Dancing Lady, '33; Sadie McKee, '34; No More Ladies, '35; The Gorgeous Hussy, '36;Love on the Run, '36; The Bride Wore Red, '37)\n\nRobert Montgomery.6 films (Untamed, 1929; Our Blushing Brides, '30; Letty Lynton, '32;Forsaking All Others, '34;No More Ladies, '35;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney, '37)\n\nWilliam Haines. 5 films (Sally, Irene and Mary, '25; Spring Fever, '27; West Point, '27; The Duke Steps Out, '29; Hollywood Revue of 1929)\n\nWhile the above leading men might come to mind first when thinking of Joan's co-stars, in fact, a couple of ladies actually appeared with her more frequently:\n\nGwen Lee.This early MGM player appeared with Joan in 9 films: Pretty Ladies, 1925;Lady of the Night, 1925; Twelve Miles Out, 1927; Untamed, 1929; The Duke Steps Out, 1929; Hollywood Revue of 1929; Our Blushing Brides, 1930;Paid, 1930; Mannequin, 1938.\n\nBess Flowers. This perennial bit player appeared with Joan in 12 films: Untamed,Possessed ('31), Gorgeous Hussy, Shining Hour, HollywoodCanteen,Mildred Pierce, Humoresque,It's a Great Feeling, Damned Don't Cry, Sudden Fear, Torch Song, and Autumn Leaves.\n\nThe Shopgirl Myth\n\nJoan's roles of the 1930s are frequently referred to in film literature as being of the \"shopgirl makes good\" variety. In fact, of her 25 films made during the '30s, only twice---in 1930's Our BlushingBridesand 1939's The Women---does she actually play a shopgirl. (And in the latter, she hardly \"makes good\" at the end.) By far the most frequently recurring character-type for Joan in the '30s is that of a rich girl---one already born to money, not working her way up to it or marrying into it.\n\nShe plays a society girl in 8 films of the 1930s: Montana Moon ('30), This Modern Age ('31), Letty Lynton('32), Today We Live('33), Forsaking All Others ('34), No More Ladies ('35), I Live My Life('35), andLove on the Run ('36). (Two other films that might fit into a \"privileged\" subcategory: In 1931'sDance, Fools, Dance, she starts out a socialite, but winds up a reporter after the market crash. In '36's The Gorgeous Hussy, she's an innkeeper's daughter, but one who mingles societally and intellectually with the prominent politicians of the day, including President Jackson.)\n\nJoan does start poor but meet or marry rich in 4 films of the '30s: Possessed ('31, factory girl and rich politician), Sadie McKee('34, maid turned night-club entertainer and rich, drunken sugar daddy followed by a younger rich nice guy), Mannequin ('38, factory worker/chorus girl/model and rich industrialist), and The Shining Hour ('38, night-club dancer and rich country gentleman).\n\nBut just as frequently, she plays an entertainer of some sort who might meet \"nice,\" but not necessarily \"rich\":Laughing Sinners('31, cabaret singer and Salvation Army officer), Dancing Lady ('33, showgirl and rough-edged show producer), The Bride Wore Red('37, cabaret singer and gentle postman), Ice Follies of 1939 (ice-skater/actress and struggling skater hubby).\n\nIn 3 films, she plays a criminal: Paid('30, ex-con, then blackmailer),Rain ('32, prostitute), The Last of Mrs. Cheyney ('37, jewel thief).\n\nAnd in the two films of the 25 that are not quite categorizable: In '32'sGrand Hotel, Joan's a stenographer of questionable reputation who winds up with a dying pensioner; in '34'sChained, she's at first \"kept\" by a rich older man, but winds up with true love, rancher Gable."
