        "text": "Actor Born Feb. 27, 1905 in Niagara Falls, NY\n\nFranchot Tone played a leading role in 100 films and four marriages.\n\nBest known as a Hollywood star, he nevertheless preferred the stage to the screen and New York to Southern California.\n\nIn September 1951, he fought a bloody fistfight with tough-guy actor Tom Neal over actress Barbara Payton. He lost the fight (a broken nose, severe facial injuries), won the girl, then, after a seven-week marriage, rued his victory and divorced her.\n\nTone suffered a loss of image and considerable blood.\n\nFor Neal and Payton the scandal meant the loss of their Hollywood careers.\n\nAfter Cornell University, Tone went into acting with a traveling stock company and in 1928, found quick success as a Broadway leading man.\n\nThen sound films came in and Hollywood, seeking actors with good voices and proper diction, lured Tone and others to the movies.\n\nAmong his many films were \"They Gave Him a Gun,\" \"Three Comrades,\" the first version of \"Mutiny on the Bounty,\" \"The Lives of a Bengal Lancer,\" \"Five Graves to Cairo\" and later in the 1950s and '60s \"Every Girl Should Be Married,\" \"Uncle Vanya\" and \"Advise and Consent.\"\n\nHe often took stage roles between movie assignments. His \"Uncle Vanya\" was cited as a Chekhov classic and was later filmed.\n\nIn 1965, when his film career was fading, he became Dr. Freedland on the \"Ben Casey\" television series.\n\n\"I like my profession,\" he said. \"Since there is not enough work elsewhere, I can work at it here. It's better to know you have a challenge than to sit and wait.\""
