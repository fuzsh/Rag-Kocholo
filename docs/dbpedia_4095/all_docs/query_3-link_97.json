Never quite a top star (it was competitive at MGM), but never far away. \"His screen character was basically the barfly, the lounge lizard....but there are few actors today as sympathetic or who can play comedy with such ease \" D Shipman THE GREAT MOVIE STARS vol 1\n\nHis first film was THE WISER SEX, as one of Claudette Colbert;s admirers, and he supported many bigger female stars in in a good run in the 30s and 40s (even marrying some).\n\nDANCING LADY, the first of several with Crawford - the fact he hardly ever got her onscreen was a factor in the real life marriage failure\n\nNote her billing and his......\n\nRip Roaring Boys Own adventure.\n\nStill below the title.... but the film was good\n\nas was MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY\n\nA big one with Bette DANGEROUS\n\nBut his billing remained inconsistent\n\n\" a pulsating drama of love among the forceps - caught between a ruptured appendix and a drinking problem\"\n\nA final one with Joanie\n\nCast better than movie - MAN PROOOF from 1938 with Walter Pidgeon, Rosalind Russell & Myrna Loy\n\nA critical and commercial hit from Remarque novel\n\nA change of pace\n\nHe was considered nice enough to star opposite Deanna Durbin in a couple NICE GIRL and HIS BUTLERS SISTER\n\nBilly Wilders WW2 suspenser must be his keeper- with Anne Baxter &Erich Von Stroheim. He got the part because Cary Grant didn't want a desert shoot (arizona) in the summer!\n\nAnother good thriller\n\nFlop Maugham adaptation with Veronica Lake an unlikely\n\nNazi spy\n\nby 1949 he was back where he started as the \"other man\"\n\nRoundabout this time he was hospitalised by Tom Neal in a beating over starlet Barbara Payton\n\nHe moved into TV and stage work in the 50s but did film UNCLE VANYA a passion project for him\n\nhe got a couple of good featured roles in the 60s\n\nADVISE & CONSENT and IN HARMS WAY for Preminger\n\nWhat are your favourite Tone movies and performances?\n\nPost by timshelboy on\n\nI haven’t seen that many of Tone’s films, though I’m a big fan of Seven Graves to Cairo (the most underrated Wilder?—well, at least tied with One, Two, Three).\n\nSomeone at a mystery forum, incidentally, noted that he would have been great ’40s casting for the character Ellery Queen—much better casting, certainly, than Ralph Bellamy or Eddie Quillan, both of whom did play the part.\n\nHe did play a tec in FAST AND FURIOUS the third in a series that never caught on as different actors played the leads (Melvyn Douglas & Florence Rice, then Bob Montgomery & Ros Russell)\n\nFEDORA gets my underrated Wilder prize\n\nPost by london777 on\n\nBoooooooo!\n\nI take it you are not a fan.....\n\nI assumed your thread was a riposte to something I posted a few hours ago in the 'Hats' thread:\n\nDec 21, 2022 23:10:11 GMT -4 london777 said:\n\nPhantom Lady (1944) dir: Robert Siodmak ... Franchot Tone is a dead weight as usual. Was he ever any good?\n\nOn the other hand, it could have been just a coincidence and I am not that important in your life.\n\nYour thread has given me a greater appreciation of Tom Neal though.\n\nPost by timshelboy on\n\nI take it you are not a fan.....\n\nI assumed your thread was a riposte to something I posted a few hours ago in the 'Hats' thread:\n\nDec 21, 2022 23:10:11 GMT -4 london777 said:\n\nPhantom Lady (1944) dir: Robert Siodmak ...

Was he ever any good?\n\nOn the other hand, it could have been just a coincidence and I am not that important in your life.\n\nOh you are important in my life - but it WAS a coincidence - I didn't see the brickbat you gave him on that thread.......also coincidentally I just posted in that thread myself... luckily not a picture Franchot Tone.....as one door opens another closes etc\n\nPost by spiderwort on\n\nGreat post, tim. Thanks. Just wanted to add that Tone was a member of The Group Threatre, founded in 1931 by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Enormous talents were part of that group, and it was the precurser to the Actors Studio, founded in 1947 by Elia Kazan (also a member of The Group), Cheryl Crawford and Robert Lewis.\n\nBut of all the wonderful actors who were his acting companions at The Group, Franchot Tone was the first Stanislavsky trained (aka \"method\") actor to become a Hollywood star. I think that's a really big deal, which most people don't know.\n\nThe Group Theatre\n\nPost by paulslaugh on\n\nGreat post, tim. Thanks.

I don’t think he gets the credit he deserves under other actors in his range like Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda.\n\nPost by timshelboy on\n\nAnother great reminder of stars of the past!\n\nPhantom Lady 1944 and Mutiny on the Bounty 1935 is probably my favorites of the ones I've seen, and that ain't many, I've noticed now.\n\nHere Comes the Groom 1951, both Bing and Franchot had become too old for this kind of roles.\n\nWell long in the tooth or not the film was a big box office hit - and I think Alexis Smith had so much fun making it she called it her favourite role.... It was Tone's last in his star run"
