Owing to his upper-class poise and polish, Tone was pigeonholed as a tuxedoed, cafe society sophisticate in a host of mostly MGM comedies and dramas. By 1937 the tall, handsome and sensitive actor was one of Hollywood's most prominent leading men, receiving recognition for his roles in \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1935), \"The Lives of a Bengal Lancer\" (1935) and \"Three Comrades\" (1938). Too often, though, he found himself stifled in standardized romantic leads, playing consort to dynamic star actresses, especially his then-wife Joan Crawford.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% Five Graves to Cairo\n\n100% Three Comrades\n\n100% The Lives of a Bengal Lancer\n\n96% Mutiny on the Bounty\n\n90% Phantom Lady\n\n90% Bombshell\n\n86% Dangerous\n\n80% Nice Girl?\n\nPhotos\n\nBECAUSE OF HIM, Franchot Tone, 1946 BECAUSE OF HIM, Franchot Tone, 1946 BETWEEN TWO WOMEN, Franchot Tone, Virginia Bruce, 1937 THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER, Charles Laughton, Franchot Tone, 1950 THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER, Franchot Tone, 1950 THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER, Charles Laughton, Franchot Tone, 1950 THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER, Burgess Meredith, Franchot Tone, 1950 ONE NEW YORK NIGHT, from left: Franchot Tone, Ina Merkel, 1935 RECKLESS, from left, Jean Harlow, Franchot Tone, 1935 SHE KNEW ALL THE ANSWERS, Joan Bennett, Eve Arden, Franchot Tone, 1941 THE STRANGER'S RETURN, from left: Lionel Barrymore, Franchot Tone, 1933 TRAIL OF THE VIGILANTES, from left, Broderick Crawford, Peggy Moran, Franchot Tone, 1940 WITHOUT HONOR, Laraine Day, Franchot Tone, 1950 THE WIFE TAKES A FLYER, (aka A YANK IN DUTCH), Franchot Tone, Joan Bennett, 1942 THE WORLD MOVES ON, Franchot Tone, 1934, ©Fox Film Coporation, TM & Copyright, THE WORLD MOVES ON, Franchot Tone, 1934, ©Fox Film Coporation, TM & Copyright, FAST AND FURIOUS, Ann Sothern, Franchot Tone, 1939 HONEYMOON, from left: Lina Romay, Franchot Tone, 1947 HERE COMES THE GROOM, Bing Crosby, Jane Wyman, Alexis Smith, Franchot Tone, James Barton, Ana Maria Albrghetti, 1951 HONEYMOON, from left: Lina Romay, Franchot Tone, 1947\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\nCredit No Score Yet No Score Yet Shadow Over Elveron Barney Conners (Character) - 1968 No Score Yet 57% Nobody Runs Forever Ambassador Townsend (Character) - 1968 No Score Yet 0% See How They Run Baron Frood (Character) - 1965 No Score Yet No Score Yet La Bonne Soupe Montasi, Jr. (Character) - 1964 77% 88% Advise and Consent The President (Character) - 1962 No Score Yet No Score Yet Witchcraft: The Doll in Brambles Your Host (Character) - 1961 No Score Yet No Score Yet Uncle Vanya Dr. Mikhail Lvovich Astroff (Character),\n\nDirector,\n\nProducer - 1958 60% 70% Here Comes the Groom Wilbur Stanley (Character) - 1951 No Score Yet No Score Yet Without Honor Dennis Williams (Character) - 1949 No Score Yet 36% The Man on the Eiffel Tower Johann Radek (Character),\n\nProducer - 1949 No Score Yet 31% Jigsaw Howard Malloy (Character) - 1949 No Score Yet 61% Every Girl Should Be Married Roger Sanford (Character) - 1948 No Score Yet No Score Yet I Love Trouble Stuart Bailey (Character) - 1947 No Score Yet No Score Yet Honeymoon David Flanner (Character) - 1947 No Score Yet 29% Her Husband's Affairs William Weldon (Character) - 1947 No Score Yet No Score Yet Lost Honeymoon Johnny Gray (Character) - 1947 No Score Yet 47% Because of Him Paul Taylor (Character) - 1946 No Score Yet No Score Yet That Night With You Paul Renaud (Character) - 1945 No Score Yet 36% Dark Waters Dr. George Grover (Character) - 1944 90% 70% Phantom Lady Jack Marlow (Character) - 1944 No Score Yet No Score Yet The Hour Before the Dawn Jim Hetherton (Character) - 1944 100% 79% Five Graves to Cairo Cpl.
