        "text": "Interment:\n\nFranchot Tone\n\nThe ashes of famed Hollywood actor Franchot Tone will be laid to rest on Sunday, July 24 at the cemetery in Point Comfort Quebec. One of Hollywood's greatest actors, Franchot Tone starred in dozens of movies, Broadway plays and television productions from the 1930s until his death in 1968. Among his most famous roles was that of Midshipman Byam, alongside Charles Laughton and Clark Gable, in the original production of Mutiny on the Bounty, a role for which he was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nFranchot spent his childhood summers and every summer throughout his Hollywood career at his beloved cottage on 31-Mile Lake in the Upper Gatineau, where his great-grandchildren are today the sixth generation of Tones to enjoy the special beauty of the region.\n\nOn Sunday, July 24, his son Pat and his family will inter the ashes of both Franchot and his son Jeff, who died in 2005, at the family plot in the Point Comfort Cemetery. Both will rest on the land they loved."
