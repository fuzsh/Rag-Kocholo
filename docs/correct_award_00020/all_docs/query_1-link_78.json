        "text": "X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a technique for elemental analysis, involving x-ray photons. The various elements you can analyze using XRF include metals, minerals, and plastics.\n\nIn XRF, you direct x-ray beams at materials, and the radiation they give off is known as fluorescence.\n\nXRF has a long history and has been an established method for commercial elemental analysis since the 1950s.\n\nThe Discovery of X-rays and Uses of X-ray Scattering\n\nThe German professor of physics Wilhelm Conrad Röentgen discovered x-rays in 1895 and won the Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1901.\n\nIn 1906, the British physicist, Charles Glover Barkla used x-ray scattering to determine the number of electrons in a carbon atom, first demonstrating the wave nature of x-rays. Later, he made the connection between the atomic weight of a sample and the x-rays radiating from it.\n\nHe received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1917 for his work on x-ray scattering.\n\nIn 1913, the physicist Henry Moseley further explored the potential of x-rays by using them to help number the elements.\n\nHe demonstrated that when a chemical element emits certain characteristic x-rays, the frequencies of these x-rays are proportional to the square of a number close to the element’s atomic number.\n\nThis became Moseley’s Law. The relationship between frequency and the atomic number is the basis of modern x-ray spectrometry.\n\nThe technique’s potential led to further scientific developments in x-rays in the first few decades of the Twentieth Century. Half of the Nobel Prizes in Physics between 1914 and 1924 were awarded to work related to x-rays.\n\nIn the 1920s, scientists experimented with primary x-rays instead of electrons to excite samples, and in 1928, pioneered XRF as a means of performing the quantitative analysis of materials.\n\nHowever, it was not until the 1940s that detector technology developed to an extent that turned XRF into a more practical technique for elemental analysis.\n\nBy the 1950s, there were the first commercially-produced x-ray spectrometers using crystals to separate x-ray energies as their wavelengths with simple x-ray detectors.\n\n1970 saw the development of a more sophisticated, lithium-drifted silicon detector, which forms the basis for detecting energies of x-rays directly as Energy Dispersive XRF technology still in use today.\n\nHow Does XRF Work?\n\nXRF is a spectroscopic form of analysis:\n\nThe electromagnetic spectrum consists of different wavelengths of visible light, radio waves, and x-rays\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is energy that takes these various forms when atoms absorb energy that changes how their electrons behave\n\nSpectroscopy measures the interaction between materials (or matter), and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nBecause all materials are made of atoms, they should give off electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, XRF is a way of analyzing what is in different materials.\n\nIt provides both quantitative and qualitative elemental analysis, and it will work with solids, liquids, and powders.\n\nIt is a non-destructive technique, leaving the samples it analyses unaffected.\n\nYou apply XRF using a spectrometer. The spectrometer beams an x-ray onto the sample material, interacting with the atoms in its makeup. This causes the fluorescence process.\n\nThe instrument detects the unique fluorescent x-rays as energies that the electrons in the sample material emit.\n\nThe process is quite rapid, with higher percentage readings taking only seconds, while the calculations of parts per million takes several minutes.\n\nWhat are the Uses of XRF?\n\nXRF can detect concentrations from 100% down to below parts per million, and as an analytical technique, it covers a wide range of elements.\n\nTherefore, it has applications across a diverse selection of disciplines and industries, including:\n\nContinuous process industries\n\nMining and industrial minerals\n\nForensic science\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nMedicine\n\nFood and drink\n\nOil and fuels\n\nConservation and cultural heritage\n\nEnvironmental\n\nRecycling\n\nXRF tests the safety of various polymers used in manufacturing and industrial applications.\n\nIn the metal industry, XRF analyses the chemical composition of alloys, to ensure they have the right properties for their various applications.\n\nIt helps ensure the correct, safe formulations of pharmaceuticals.\n\nEvery fuel or oil you use in your car is quality tested using XRF\n\nIt is a valuable and practical teaching tool and has widespread use as a technique for the scientific examination of works of art.\n\nXRF is used in geology, field analysis, and soil surveys.\n\nModern XRF Equipment\n\nBringing the history of XRF up to date, there is a wide range of benchtop and handheld XRF spectrometers, designed to make this elemental analysis method easy to apply across a diverse range of industries and sectors.\n\nThere are also various application packages available that aid the preparation of XRF samples and provide extensive calibration reference standards."
