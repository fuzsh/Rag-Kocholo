Charles Glover Barkla (1877-1944) was a British physicist. From 1905 to 1909 he was a lecturer in physics and advanced electricity at the University of Liverpool, and in 1909, succeeded H. A. Wilson as Wheatstone Professor of Physics at the University of London. In 1913, Barkla accepted the Chair in Natural Philosophy at University of Edinburgh where he held the position until his death. He made significant progress in developing and refining the laws of X-ray scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, the principles governing the transmission of X-rays through matter, and especially the principles of the excitation of secondary X-rays. For his discovery of the characteristic X-rays of elements, Barkla was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1917. - A collection of 13 offprints and journal issues by Charles G.
