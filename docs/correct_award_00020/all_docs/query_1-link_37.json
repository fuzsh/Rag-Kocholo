        "text": "Ignacio Cirac\n\nProfessor Juan Ignacio Cirac is a pioneer in the field of quantum computation and its application in the field of information. With his colleague Peter Zoller, he made the first proposals to build quantum computers, quantum simulators, and quantum repeaters using atoms, ions, photons and other physical systems. He has also introduced basic concepts and techniques in quantum information theory and, in particular, in entanglement theory. With Frank Verstraete and other collaborators, he introduced the tensor networks states called PEPS, developed their theory, and related the entanglement of a many-body quantum system with the possibility of describing it efficiently.\n\nProfessor Ciracâs work has obtained many prestigious awards, including the Felix Kuschenitz Prize of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Quantum Electronics from the European Science Foundation, the Prince of Asturias Prize for Scientific and Technical Research, the National \"Blas Cabrera\" Prize for Physical, Material and Earth Sciences, the Frontiers of Knowledge and Culture Award for basic science given by the BBVA Foundation, the Franklin Medal, the Niels Bohr Medal, the Wolf Foundation Prize in Physics, the Hamburger prize for Theoretical Physics, the Max Planck Medal of the DPG and, more recently, the John Bell Medal of the University of Toronto and the Quantum Computing Prize of the Micius Foundation in China. He holds honorary degrees from the universities of Castilla-La Mancha, PolitÃ©cnica de Barcelona, Zaragoza, Valencia, PolitÃ©cnica de Valencia, Europea de Madrid, and Buenos Aires. He is a member of the German (Leopoldina), the Bavarian, and the Spanish Academy of Sciences, and corresponding member of the Austrian, Zaragoza, and Barcelona Academies, as well as fellow of the American Physical Society.\n\nBorn in Manresa, Spain, Professor Cirac graduated in Theoretical Physics from the Complutense University, Madrid in 1988, and gained his PhD in 1991. After positions a University of Castilla-La Mancha and University of Innsbruck, with long visits to University of Colorado and Harvard University, he became a member of the Max Planck Society and was appointed director at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics (Garching, Germany) in 2001. In 2002 he also became Honorary Professor at the Technical University of Munich, and since 2019 he is co-director of the Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology."
