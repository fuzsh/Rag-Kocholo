The lectures in the five Nobel Prize domains : Phys- ics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace will appear separately, according to the subject. The scientific lectures will each cover three volumes and those in literature and peace one volume each. Short bio- graphical notes and the presentation speeches will also be included. The Nobel Foundation has since 1901 each year published LesPrix Nobel which contains all Nobel Lectures of that year, always in the language in which tlicy were given, as well as short biographies of the laureates. In addi- tion an account is given of the prize-award ceremonies in Stockholm and in Oslo, including presentation addresses and after-dinner speeches, etc., thus covering the whole field of Nobel Prize events of one particular year. In the Elsevier series the Nobel Lectures, presentation addresses, and bio- graphies will now be more readily accessible to those who wish to follow the development in only certain of .the Nobel subjects, as reflected in the prize awards during the years passed. For practical reasons English has been chosen as common language for this series. It is the hope of the Nobel Foundation that the volumes to be published by Elsevier Publishing Company will supplement Les Prix Nobel and that together they will serve to spread knowledge of those landmarks on the road of human progress that have been honoured by Nobel Prizes. Arne Tiselitis — President, Nobel Foundation Publisher’s Note During the realization of this work we have been confronted by many pro- blems. In solving the great majority of them we have relied heavily upon assistance, both invited and spontaneously offered, from many quarters. To some problems there was no solution to be found; in particular, it proved impossible to obtain, for some of the lectures, the original photographs or blocks used for the illustrations. As an inevitable consequence of this it was found necessary to reproduce these illustrations from a printed original ; tliis naturally renders them less perfect than we would have wished. We thank those who were able to lend us original material. The translations of those lectures which were delivered in a language other than English were prepared by the Babylon Translation Service, London. We are indebted to Mr. D. F. Styles, Mr. M. Fedorski (both of Manchester), and Dr. G. Lapage of Cambridge, for research on, and preparation of, most of the biographies. Completion of these, and the addition of much detail, was achieved with the cooperation of descendants and other relatives of deceased laureates, and further individuals whose help was requested. To all of them we would like to offer our sincerest thanks in appreciation of their efforts.

T. Odhner, President of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences received from Alfred Nobel the privilege of awarding two of the great Prizes which he founded m his will - the Prizes in those branches of Science which lay nearest his heart - those in Physics and Chemistry. Now that the Royal Academy of Sciences has received from its Committees their expert opinion on the suggestions sent in, as well as their own suggestions, it has made its decision, and as current President I am here to make it known. The Academy awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics to Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen, Professor in the University of Munich, for the discovery with which his name is linked for all time: the discovery of the so-called Rontgen rays or, as he himself called them. X-rays. These are, as we know, a new form of energy and have received the name «rays» on account of their property of propagating themselves in straight lines as light does. The actual constitution of this radiation of energy is still unknown. Several of its char- acteristic properties have, however, been discovered first by Rontgen him- self and then by other physicists who have directed their researches into this field. And there is no doubt that much success will be gamed in physical science when this strange energy form is sufficiently investigated and its wide field thoroughly explored. Let us remind ourselves of but one of the properties which have been found in Rontgen rays; that which is the basis of the extensive use of X-rays in medical practice. Many bodies, just as they allow light to pass through them in varying degrees, behave likewise with X-rays, but with the difference that some which are totally impenetrable to light can easily be penetrated by X-rays, while other bodies stop them completely. Thus, for example, metals are impenetrable to them; wood, leather, cardboard and other materials arc penetrable and this is also the case with the muscular tissues of animal organisms. Now, when a foreign body impenetrable to X-rays, c.g. a bullet or a needle, has entered these tissues its location can be determined by illuminating the appropriate part of the body 4 PHYSICS 1901 With X-rays and taking a shadowgraph of it on a photographic plate, where- upon the impenetrable body is immediately detected The importance of this for practical surgery, and how many operations have been made possible and facditated by it is well known to all If we add that m many cases severe skm diseases, e g lupus, have been successfully treated with Rontgen rays, we can say at once that Rontgen’s discovery has already brought so much benefit to raankmd that to reward it with the Nobel Prize fulfils the inten- tion of the testator to a very high degree No Lecture luas delivered by Professor W. Rontgen. Biography WiUielm Conrad Rontgen was born, on March 27, 1845, at Lentiep in the Lower Rhine Province of Germany, as the only child of a merchant in, and manufacturer of, cloth His mother was Charlotte Constanze Frowein of Amsterdam a member of an old Lennep family which had settled m Am- sterdam When he was three years old, his family moved to Apeldoorn m The Netherlands, where he went to the Institute of Martmus Herman van Doom, a boarding school He did not show any special aptitude, but showed a love of nature and was fond of roaming m the open country and forests He was especially apt at making mechanical contrivances, a characteristic which re- mained with him also in later life In 1862 he entered a technical school at Utrecht, where he was however unfairly expelled, accused of having prod- uced a caricature of one of the teachers, which was m fact done by someone else He then entered the University of Utrecht in 1 865 to study physics Not havmg attained the credentials required for a regular student, and hearing that he could enter the Polytechnic at Zurich by passmg its examination, he passed this and began studies there as a student of mechanical engineering He attended the lectures given by Clausius and also worked in the laboratory of Kundt Both Kundt and Clausius exerted great influence on his develop- ment In 1869 he graduated Ph D attheUmversityofZunch.wasappointcd assistant to Kundt and went with him to Wurzburg m the same year, and three years later to Strasbourg In 1874 he qualified as Lecturer at Strasbourg University and m 1875 he was appointed Professor in the Academy of Agriculture at Hohcnheim m Wurtemberg In 1876 he returned to Strasbourg as Professor of Physics, but three years later he accepted the invitation to the Chair of Physics in the University of Giessen After having declined uivitations to similar positions m the Universities of Jena (1886) and Utrecht (1888), be accepted it from the University of Wurz- burg (1888), where he succeeded Kohlrausch und found among his coUca- BIOGRAPHY 7 gues Hclnilioltz and Lorenz. In 1899 he declined an offer to the Chair of Physics in the University of Leipzig, but in 1900 he accepted it in the Univer- sity of Munich, by special request of the Bavarian government, as successor of E.Lommel. Here he remained for the rest of liis life, although he was of- fered, but declined, the Presidency of thePhysikalisch-Xechnische Reichsan- stalt at Berlin and the Chair of Physics of the Berlin Academy. Rontgen’s first work was published in 1870, dealing with the specific heats of gases, followed a few years later by a paper on the thermal conductivity of crystals. Among other problems he studied were the electrical and other characteristics of quartz ; the influence of pressure on the refractive indices of various fluids; the modification of the planes of polarised light by electro- magnetic influences; the variations in the functions of the temperature and the compressibility of water and other fluids ; the phenomena accompanying the spreading of oil drops on water. Rontgen’s name, however, is chiefly associated with his discovery of the rays that he called X-rays. In 1895 he was studying the phenomena accom- panying the passage of an electric current through a gas of extremely low pressure. Previous work in this field had already been carried out by J. Plucker (1801-1868), J. W. Hittorf (1824-1914), C. F. Varley (1828-1883 ), E. Goldstein (1850-1931), Sir William Crookes (1832-1919), H. Hertz (1857-1894) and Ph. von Lenard (1862-1947), and by the work of these scientists the properties of cathode rays - the name given by Goldstein to the electric current established in highly rarefied gases by the very high tension electricity generated by Ruhmkorff’s induction coil -had become well known. Rontgen’s work on cathode rays led him, however, to the discovery of a new and different kind of rays. On the evening of November 8, 1895, he found that, if the discharge tube is enclosed in a sealed, thick black carton to exclude all light, and if he work- ed in a dark room, a paper plate covered on one side with barium platino- cyanide placed in the path of the rays became fluorescent even when it was as far as two metres from the discharge tube. During subsequent experiments he found that objects of different thicknesses interposed in the path of the rays showed variable transparency to them when recorded on a photographic plate. When he immobihsed for some moments the hand of his wife in the path of the rays over a photographic plate, he observed after development of the plate an image of his wife s hand which showed the shadows thrown by the bones of her hand and that of a ring she was wearing, surrounded by the penumbra of the flesh, which was more permeable to the rays and there- 8 ipoi W C RONTGEN fore threw a fainter shadow This was the first «rontgenogram» ever taken In further experiments, Rontgen showed that the new rays are produced by the impact of cathode rays on a matcnal object Because their nature was then unknown, he gave them the name X-rays Later, Max von Laue and his pupils showed that they are of the same electromagnetic nature as light, but differ from it only m the higher frequency of their vibration Numerous honours were showered upon him In several atics, streets were named after him, and a complete list of Prizes, Medals, honorary doctorates, honorary and corresponding memberships of learned societies in Germany as well as abroad, and other honours would fill a whole page of this book In spite of all this, Rontgen retained the characteristic of a strikingly modest and reticent man Throughout his life he retained his love of nature and out- door occupations Many vacations were spent at his summer home at Weil- heim, at the foot of the Bavanan Alps, where he entertamed his friends and went on many expeditions into the mountams He was a great mountaineer and more than once got into dangerous situations Amiable and courteous by nature, he was always understandmg the views and difficulties of others He was always shy of having an assistant, and preferred to work alone Much of the apparatus he used was built by himself with great ingenuity and experi- mental skill Rontgen married Anna Bertha Ludwig of Zurich, whom he had met in the cafe run by her father She was a niece of the poet Otto Ludwig They married m 1872 m Apeldoom, The Netherlands They had no children, but in 1887 adopted Josephine Bertha Ludwig, then aged 6, daughter of Mrs Rontgen’s only brother Four years after his wife, Rontgen died at Munich on February 10, 1913, from carcinoma of the intestine Physics 1902 HENDRIK ANTOON LORENTZ PIETER ZEEMAN recognition of the extraordinary service they rendered hy their researches into the influence of magnetism upon radiation phenomena)} Physics 1902 Presentation Speech by Professor Hj. Theel, President of the Royal Swedish Acad- emy of Sciences Your Majesty, Your Royal Hignesses, Ladies and Gentlemen. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award this year’s Nobel Prize for Physics to Professor Dr. Hendrik Antoon Lorentz of Leiden and Professor Dr. Pieter Zeeman of Amsterdam for their pioneering work on the connection between optical and electromagnetic phenomena. Since the law of the conservation of energy was recognized as the first basic principle of modern physics, no realm of that science during the re- markable developments which have been based on this foundation has prov- ed more fruitful than that which has had as its object the investigation of the connection between the phenomena of light and electricity. Faraday, the great founder of the modern science of electricity, suspected this connection and devoted a great part of liis experimental research to this very question. However, Maxwell was the first to take up Faraday’s ideas again and develop them into a complete mathematical theory. According to this theory electrodynamic effects are transmitted through space at a finite speed and cause electrical currents, so-called displacement currents, even in non-conductors. Hence, every electrical current of periodically changing direction gives rise to an electrical wave motion, and light consists of just such a wave motion with an extremely short period. This so-called electromagnetic theory of light of Maxwell’s at first arous- ed comparatively little interest. Twenty years after its first appearance how- ever it led to a scientific discovery which demonstrated its great significance in no uncertain manner. The German physicist Fleinrich Hertz then succeed- ed in demonstrating that the electrical vibrations - which are generated under certain conditions when an electrically charged body is discharged - are propagated through the surrounding space in the form of a wave mo- tion, and that the wave motion spreads at the speed of light and also pos- sesses its properties. This gave a firm experimental basis for the electro- magnetic theory of light. In certain respects however Maxwell’s theory of light was inadequate, in that it left individual phenomena unexplained. The greatest credit for the 12 PHYSICS 1902 further development of the electromagnetic theory of light is due to Profes- sor Lorentz, whose theoretical work on this subject has borne the richest fruit. While Maxwell’s theory is free from any assumptions of an atomistic nature, Lorentz starts from the hypothesis that m matter extremely small particles, called electrons, are the earners of certain specific charges These electrons move freely in so-called conductors and thus produce an electrical current, whereas m non-conductors their movement is apparent through electrical resistance. Startmg from this simple hypothesis, Lorentz has been able not only to explain everything that the older theory explained but, m addition, to overcome some of its greatest shortcomings. Alongside the theoretical development of the electromagnetic theory of light, experimental work also contmued without interruption, and attempts were made to demonstrate in every detail the analogy between electrical wave motion and hght. However, it was not sufficient to show a complete analogy between these phenomena, saeniists wished far more to show that they were identical in nature, and to this end they attempted to demonstrate that magnetic forces act upon hght in the same way as upon electric currents It IS this that Faraday was trying to prove, and the relevant experiments ear- ned out by him led to the discovery of the rotation of the polarization plane of hght by the effect of magnetic forces His attempt to demonstrate the influence of magnetism on the radiation from a source of hght - the last experiment tnth which Faraday was occupied - was, however, unsuccessful. Professor Zeeman has recently succeeded m solving just this problem, which has up till now been the object of fruitless exertions on the part of many perspicacious research workers Guided by the electromagnetic theo- ry of hght, Zeeman took up Faraday’s last experiment, and, after many imsuccessful attempts, finally succeeded m demonstrating that the radiation from a source of hght changes its nature under the influence of magnetic forces m such a way that the different spectral lines of which it consisted were resolved into several components. The consequences of this discovery give a magnificent example of the importance of theory to experimental rcseaich. Not only was Professor Lorentz, ivith the aid of his electron theo- ry, able to explain satisfactorily the phenomena discovered by Professor Zeeman, but certain details which had hitherto escaped Professor Zeeman’s attention could also be foreseen, and were afterwards confirmed by him He showed, in fact, that the spectral lines which were spht under the influence of magnetism consisted of polarized light, or m other words that the hght vibrations arc orientated m one particular way under the influence of the PRESENTATION 13 magnetic force, and in a way wliich varies according to the direction of the beam of light in relation to this force. For the physicist this discovery - the Zeeman effect - represents one of the most important experimental advances that recent decades have to show. For, through the demonstration that hght is affected by magnetism in ac- cordance with the same laws as vibrating electrically charged particles, clear- ly not only has the strongest support been given to the electromagnetic theo- ry of hght, but the consequences of Zeeman’s discovery promise to yield the most interesting contributions to our knowledge of the constitution of spectra and of the molecular structure of matter. For these reasons the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences has come to the conclusion that the discovery outlined here is of such great importance for the understanding of the connection between the forces of Nature and for the development of physical science that its recognition by the award of the Nobel Prize for Physics is justified. The Academy also bore in mind the great part which Professor Lorentz has played in the following up of this discovery through his masterly theory of electrons, which is moreover of the greatest signifi- cance as a guiding principle in various other realms. Since the discovery in physics which the Royal Academy of Sciences wishes to recognize on this occasion represents the result of the most per- spicacious research, both theoretical and experimental, the Academy con- siders that a division of the Nobel Prize for Physics between the two out- standing research workers. Professor Lorentz and Professor Zeeman, for their work on the comiection between light and magnetism, is not only justified, but just. Hendrik A.Lorentz The theory of electrons and the propagation of hght Nobel Lecture, December ii, IQ02 When Professor Zeeman and I received the news of the great honour of the high distinction awarded to us, we immediately began to consider how we could best divide our roles with respect to our addresses Professor Zeeman was first to have described the phenomenon discovered by him, given the explanation of it, and given an outline of his later experimental work My task should have been to consider rather more deeply our present-day know- ledge of electricity, m particular the so-called electron theory. I am more sorry than I can say that Professor Zeeman has been prevented by illness from undertaking the journey to Stockholm, and that therefore you will now only be able to hear the second half of our programme I hope you will excuse me if under these circumstances I say only a little about the mam theme, Zeeman’s fine discovery. A short description of it, however, might well precede my further thoughts. As IS well known to you, Faraday even m his day discovered that magnet- ic forces can have an effect on the propagation of light He showed m fact that m suitable conditions the vibrations of a beam of polarized light can be made to rotate by such forces Many years later Kerr found that such a beam of hght also undergoes smniac changes when it is simply reflected from the pohshed pole of a magnet. However, it remained for Zeeman’s talent to show that a magnetic field affects not only the propagation and reflection of hght but also the processes in which the beam of hght ongmates, that is to say that the rays emitted by a light source assume different properties if this source is placed in the gap between a magnetic north and south pole The difference is sho\\vn in the spectral resolution of the hght, when one is work- ing with the type of light source whose spectrum consists of smgle bright lines - that IS, with a coloured flame, an electrical spark, or a Geissler tube To have a specific case before your eyes, imagine that my hands are the two poles, only much closer together than I am holdmg them now, and that the hght source is benveen these poles, that is to say in the space immediately m front ofme. Now if the spectrum of the light which shines on a point directly opposite me is investigated, there can be observed, instead of a smgle spectral 15 ELECTRON THEORY AND LIGHT PROPAGATION line such as can be seen under normal circumstances, a three-fold line, or triplet, whose components admittedly are separated from each other by a very small distance. Since each position in the spectrum corresponds to a specific frequency of light, we can also say that instead of light of one fre- quency the source is, under the influence of the magnetic field, emitting light of three different frequencies. If the spectrum consists of more than one line, then you can imagine that each line is resolved into a triplet. I must, however, add that the situation is not always as simple as this, and many spectral lines resolve into more than three components. Before turning to the theory, I should like to remark that thanks to the speedy publication of research and the consequent lively exchange of views between scientists much progress must be considered as the result of a great deal of joint effort. Since it is expected of me, I am going to talk principally of my own ideas and the way in which I have come to them. I do beg of you, however, not to lose sight of the fact that many other physicists, not all of whom I can name in this short space of time, have arrived at the same or very similar conclusions. The theory of which I am going to give an account represents the physi- cal world as consisting of three separate things, composed of three types of building material; first ordinary tangible or ponderable matter, second elec- trons, and third ether. I shall have very little to say about ponderable matter, but so much the more about ether and electrons. I hope it will not be too much for your patience. As far as the ether - that bearer of light which fills the whole universe - is concerned, after Faraday’s discovery which I have already mentioned and also independently of it, many attempts were made to exploit the ether in the theory of electricity also. Edlund went so far as to identify the electric fluid with the ether, ascribing to a positively charged body an excess of ether and to a negatively charged one a deficiency of ether. He considered this medium as a liquid, subject to the Archimedean principle, and in this way succeeded in imputing all electrostatic effects to the mutual repulsion of particles of ether. There was also a place in his theory for the electrodynamic attraction and repulsion beUveen two metaUic wires with electrical current flowing in them. Indeed, he formed a most remarkable conception of these effects. He ex- plained them by the condition that the mutual repulsion of two particles of ether needs a certain time to be propagated from the one to the other; it was in fact an axiom \\vith him that everything which occurs in Nature takes a 1902 H A LORENTZ l6 certain length of time, how ever short this may be This idea, which has been fully developed in our present-day views, is found also in the work of other older ph) sicists I need only mention Gauss, of whom we know that he did not follow this up only because he lacked a clear picture of the propagation Such a picture, he wrote to Wilhelm Weber, would be the virtual keystone of a theory of electrodynamics The way pioneered by Edlund, in which the distinction between ether and electricity was completely swept aside, was incapable of leading to a satisfactory synthesis of optical and electrical phenomena Lorenz at Copen- hagen came nearer the goal You know, however, that the true founders of our present views on this subject were Clerk Maxwell and Hertz In that Maxwell developed further and constructed a basis for the ideas put forward by Faraday, he was the creator of the electromagnetic theory of light, which IS undoubtedly well known to you m its broad outline He taught us that light vibrations are changes of state of the same nature as electric currents We can also say that electrical forces which change direction extremely npidly - many billions of times a second - aie present m every beam of light If) ou imagine a tiny panicle m the path of a sunbeam, something like the familiar dust motes m the air, only considerably smaller, and ifyou also imagine that this particle is electrically charged, then you must also suppose that It IS set into a rapid quivering movement by the light vibrations Immediately after Maxwell I named Hertz, that great German physicist, who, if he had not been snatched from us too soon, would certainly have been among the very first of those whom your Academy would have con- sidered in fulfilling your aimua! task Who does not know the brilliant ex- periments by which he confirmed the conclusions that Maxwell had drawn from his equations^ Whoever has once seen these and learnt to understand and admire them can no longer be m any doubt that the features of the electromagnetic waves to be observed m them differ from light beams only m their greater wavelength The result of these and other investigations into the waves propagated in the ether culminate m the realization that there exists m Nature a whole range of electromagnetic waves, which, however different tlicir wave- lengths may be, arc basically all of the same nature Beginning with Hertz’s ora) s of electrical forces, wc next come to the shortest waves caused b) elec- tromagnetic apparatus and then after jumping a gap to the dark thermal ra) s Wc traverse the spectrum far into the ultraviolet range, come across an- other gap, and may then put X-rays as extremely sliort violent clcctromag- 17 electron theory and light propagation netic disturbances of the ether, at the end of the range. At the begmrung of the range, even before the Hertzian waves, belong the waves used hi wireless telegraphy, whose propagation was established last summer from the south- west tip of England to as far as the Gulf of Finland. Although it was prmcipally Hertz’s experiments that turned the basic idea of Maxwell’s theory into the common property of all scientists, it had been possible to start earlier with some optunism on the task of applying this theo- ry to special problems in optics. We will begin with the simple phenome- non of the refraction of light. It has been known since the time of Huygens that this is comiected with the unequal rate of propagation of the beams of light in different substances. How does it come about, however, that the speed of light in solid, liquid, and gaseous substances differs from its speed in the ether of empty space, so that it has its own value for each of these pon- derable substances; and how can it he explained that these values, and hence also the refractive index, vary from one colour to another? In dealing with these questions it appeared once more, as hi many other cases, that much can be retained even from a theory which has had to be abandoned. In the older theory of undulation, which considered the ether as an elastic medium, there was already talk of tiny particles contained in pon- derable substances which could be set in motion by hght vibrations. The explanation of the chemical and heating action of light was sought in this transmission of motion, and a theory of colour dispersion had been based on the hypothesis that transparent substances, such as glass and water, also contained particles which were set into co-vibration under the influence of a beam of light. A successor to Maxwell now has merely to translate this con- ception of co-vibrating particles into the language of the electromagnetic theory of light. Now what must these particles be like if they can be moved by the pul- sating electrical forces of a beam of light? The simplest and most obvious answer was: they must be electrically charged. Then they will behave in exactly the same way as the tiny charged dust motes that we spoke of before, except that the particles in glass and water must be represented, not as float- ing freely, but as being bound to certain equilibrium positions, about which they can vibrate. This idea of small charged particles was otherwise by no means new; as long as 25 years ago the phenomena of electrolysis were being explained by ascribmg positive charges to the metallic atoms in a solution of a salt, and negative charges to the other components of the salt molecule. This laid the l8 1902 H A LORENTZ foundation of modem electrochemistry, which was to develop so rapidly once Prof. Arrhenius had expressed the bold idea of progressive dissociation of the electrolyte with increasmg dilution. We will return to the propagation of light in ponderable matter. The co- vibratmg particles must, we concluded, be electrically charged ; so we can conveniently call them « electrons*, the name that was introduced later by Johnstone Stoney. The exact manner 111 which this co-vibration takes place, and what reaction it has on the processes in the ether, could be investigated with the aid of the well-known laws of electromagnetism. The result con- sisted of formulae for the veloaty of propagation and the refractive indices, m their dependence on the one hand on the vibration period -1 e on the colour of the light - and on the other hand on the nature and number of the electrons. You will forgive me if I do not quote the rather complicated equations, and only give some account of their significance. In the first place, as regards the dependence of the refractive index on vibration period - that is, colour dispersion m the prismatic spectrum and m rainbows we see a demonstra- tion of the fact that the electrons m glass and water possess a certain mass, consequently they do not follow the vibrations of light of different colours with the same readiness. Secondly, if attention is focussed on the influence of the greater or smaller number of particles in a cctcam space an equation can be found which puts us m a position to give the approximate change m the refractive index with mcreasing or decreasing density of the body - thus, for example, it is pos- sible to calculate the refractive mdex of water vapour from that of water. This equation agrees fairly well with the results of experiments When I drew up these formulae I did not know that Lorenz at Copen- hagen had already arrived at exactly the same result, even though he started from different viewpomis, mdependent of the electromagnetic theory of light The equation has therefore often been referred to as the formiila of Lorenz and Lorentz This formula is accompanied by another which makes it possible to de- duce the refractive index of a chemical compound from us composition, admittedly only in rough approximation as was possible earlier with the aid of certain empirical formulae. The fact that such a connection between the refraction of light and the chemical composition does exist at all is of great importance m the elec- tromagnetic theory of light. It shows us that the power of refraction is not 19 ELECTRON THEORY AND LIGHT PROPAGATION one of those properties of matter which are completely transformed by the action of chemical combination. The relative positions of, and type of bond between, the atoms are not of primary importance as concerns the speed of propagation in a compound. Only the number of atoms of carbon, hydro- gen, etc. is of importance; each atom plays its part in the refraction of light, unaffected by the behaviour of the others. In the face of these results we find it hard to imagine that the forces which bind an electron to its equilibrium position and on the intensity of which depends the velocity ofhght are gen- erated by a certain number of neighbouring atoms. We conclude rather that the electron, together with whatever it is bound to, has its place within a single atom; hence, electrons are smaller than atoms. Permit me now to draw your attention to the ether. Smee we learnt to consider this as the transmitter not only of optical but also of electromagnet- ic phenomena, the problem of its nature became more pressing than ever. Must we imagine the ether as an elastic medium of very low density, com- posed of atoms which are very small compared with ordinary ones? Is it perhaps an incompressible, frictionless fluid, which moves in accordance with the equations of hydrodynamics, and in which therefore there may be various turbulent motions? Or must we think of it as a kind of jelly, half liquid, half solid? Clearly, we should be nearer the answers to these questions if it were pos- sible to experiment on the ether in the same way as on liquid or gaseous matter. If we could enclose a certain quantity of this medium in a vessel and compress it by the action of a piston, or let it flow into another vessel, we should already have achieved a great deal. That would mean displacing the ether by means of a body set in motion. Unfortunately, all the experiments undertaken on these hnes have been unsuccessful; the ether always slips through our fingers. Imagine an ordinary barometer, which we tilt so that the mercury rises to the top, filling the tube completely. The ether which was originally above the mercury must be somewhere; it must have either passed through the glass or been absorbed into the metal, and that without any force that we can measure having acted upon it. Experiments of this type show that bodies of normal dimensions, as far as we can tell, are com- pletely permeable to the ether. Does this apply equally to much larger bodies, or could we hope to displace the ether by means of some sort of very-large, very-fast moving piston? Fortunately, Nature performs this ex- periment on a large scale. After all, in its annual journey round the sun the earth travels through space at a speed more than a thousand times greater 20 1902 H.A.LORENTZ than that of an express tram. We nught expect that m these circumstances there would be an end to the immobility of the ether, the earth would push It away in front of itself, and the cthet would flow to the rear of the planet, either along its surface or at a certam distance from it, so as to occupy the space which the earth has just vacated. Astronomical observation of the positions of the heavenly bodies gives a sharp means of determinmg whether tins IS m fact the case , movements of the ether would assuredly mfluence the course of the beams of light m some way. Once agam we get a negative answer to our question whether the ether moves. The direction m which we observe a star certamly differs from the true direction as a result of the movement of the earth - this is the so-called aberration of hght. However, by far the simplest explanation of this phe- nomenon IS to assume that the whole earth is completely permeable to the ether and can move through it without dragging it at all This hypothesis was first expressed by Fresnel and can hardly be contested at present. If we wish to give an account of the significance of this result, we have one more thmg to consider. Thanks to the mvcstigations of Van dcr Waals and other physicists, we know fairly accurately how great a part of the space occupied by a body is m fact filled by its molecules. In fairly dense substances this fraction is so large that we have difficulty m imagining the earth to be of such loose molecular structure that the ether can flow almost completely freely through the spaces between the molecules Rather are we constrained to take the view that each individual molecule is permeable The simplest thing IS to suggest further that the same is true of each atom, and this leads us to the idea that an atom is m the last resort some sort of local modification of the omnipresent ether, a modification which can shift from place to place without the medium itself altering us position Havmg reached this point, we can consider the ether as a substance of a completely distinctive nature, sU pondrrabic matter. With regard to its amer constitution, in the present state of our knowledge it is very difficult for us to give an adequate picture of it. I hardly need to mention that, quite apart from this question of constitu- tion, It will always be important to come to a closer understanding of the transmission of apparent distant actions through the ether by demon- strating how a liquid, for example, can produce similar effects Here I am thinking in particular of the cxpcnmenis of Prof. Bjerknes m Christiania* * Now Oslo. 21 ELECTRON THEORY AND LIGHT PROPAGATION on transmitted hydrodynamic forces and of his imitation of electrical phenomena with pulsating spheres. I come now to an important question which is very closely comiected with the immobility of the ether. You know that in the determination of the velocity of sound in the open air, the effect of the wind makes itself felt. If this is blowing towards the observer, the required quantity will increase with the wind speed, and with the wind in the opposite direction the figure will be reduced by the same amount. If, then, a moving transparent body, such as flowing water, carries along with it in its entirety the ether it con- tains, then optical phenomena should behave in much the same way as the acoustical phenomena in these experiments. Consider for example the case in which water is flowing along a tube and a beam of Hght is propagated tinthin this water in the direction of flow. If everytliing that is involved in the light vibrations is subject to the flowing movement, then the propaga- tion of light in the flowing water will in relation to the latter behave in exactly the same way as in still water. The velocity of propagation relative to the wall of the tube can be found by adding the velocity of propagation in the water to the rate of flow of the water, just as, if a ball is rolling along the deck of a ship in the direction m which it is travelling, the ball moves relative to an observer on the shore at the sum of two speeds - the speed of the ship and the speed at which the ball is rolling on it. According to this hypothesis the water would drag the light waves at the fuU rate of its own flow. We come to a quite different conclusion if we assume, as we now must, that the ether contained in the flowing water is itself stationary. As the hght is partly propagated through this ether, it is easy to see that the propagation of the light beams, for example to the right, must take place more slowly than it would if the ether itself were moving to the right. The waves are certainly carried along by the water, but only at a certain fraction of its rate of flow. Fresnel has already demonstrated the size of this fraction; it depends on the refractive index of the substance - the value for water, for example, being 0.44. By accepting this figure it is possible to explain various phenom- ena connected with aberration. Moreover, Fresnel deduced it from a the- oretical standpoint which, however ingenious it may be, we can now no longer accept as valid. In 1851 Fizeau settled the question by his famous experiment in which he compared the propagation of hght in water flowing in the direction of the beam of hght with its propagation in water flowing in the opposite direc- tion. The result of these experiments, afterwards repeated with the same 22 1902 H A LORENT2 result by Michelson and Morley, was m complete agreement with the values assumed by Fresnel for the drag cocfficient. There now arose the question of whether it is possible to deduce this value from the new theory of hght. To this end it was necessary first of all to devel- op a theory of electromagnetic phenomena in movmg substances, with the assumption that the ether does not partake of their motion To find a startmg-pomt for such a theory, I once agam had recourse to electrons I was of the opmion that these must be permeable to the ether and that each must be the centre of an electric and also, when m motion, of a magnetic field. For conditions in the ether I mtroduced the equations which have been generally accepted since the work of Hertz and Heaviside. Finally I added certain as- sumptions about the force actmg on an electron, as follows this force is always due to the ether m the imincdute vicinity of the electron and is therefore affected directly by the state of this ether and indirectly by the charge and velocity of the other electrons which have brought about this state. Furthermore, the force depends on the charge and speed of the particle which IS being acted upon; these values determine as it were the sensitivity of the electron to the action due to the ether In working out these ideas I used methods deriving from Maxwell and partly also rehed on the work of Hertz Thus I arrived at the drag coeffiaent accepted by Fresnel, and was able to ex- plain m a fairly simple way most of the optical phenomena m movmg bodies At the same time, a start was made on a general theory which ascribed all electromagnetic processes taking place in ponderable substances to electrons. In this theory an electrical charge is conceived as being a surplus of positive or negative electrons, but a current m a metallic wire is considered to be a genume progression of these particles, to which is ascribed a certain mobil- ityin conductors, whereas m non-conductors they are bound to certain equi- librium positions, about which, as has already been said, they can vibrate. In a certam sense this theory represents a return to the earlier idea that we were dealmg with two electrical substances, except that now, in accordance with Maxivell’s ideas, we have to do with actions which are transmitted through ether and are propagated from pomt to point at the velocity of hght. Since the nature and manner of this transmission can be followed up in all its de- tails, the demand that Gauss made for a theory of electrodynamics is fulfilled. I cannot spend any more time on these matters, but would hke to mention that Wiechcrt at Gottmgen and Lirmor at Cambridge have produced very similar results, and that Prof.Pomcarc has also contributed much to the development and evaluation of the theory. 23 ELECTRON THEORY AND LIGHT PROPAGATION I must also pass over many phenomena investigated in recent years, in which the concept of electrons has proved a useful guide, in order not to stray too far from the theory of the Zeeman effect. When Prof. Zeeman made his discovery, the electron theory was complete in its main features and in a position to interpret the new phenomenon. A man who has peopled the whole world with electrons and made them co- vibrate with light will not scruple to assume that it is also electrons which vibrate witliin the particles of an incandescent substance and bring about the emission of light. An oscdlating electron constitutes, as it were, a minute Hertzian vibrator; its effect on the surromrding ether is much the same as the effect we have when we take hold of the end of a stretched cord and set up the familiar motion waves in the rope by moving it to and fro. As for the force which causes a change in the vibrations in a magnetic field, this is basically the force, the manifestations of which were first observed by Oersted, when he discovered the effect of a current on a compass needle. I will leave the explanation of triplets to Prof. Zeeman. I will confine my- self to remarking that it is the negative electrons which oscillate, and that from the distance between the components into which the spectral line is resolved the ratio between the numerical value of the charge and the mass of these particles can be deduced. The results are in gratifying agreement with those which have been found in other contexts. The same or similar values for the ratio mentioned above have been found for the negative particles with which we are concerned in cathode rays. A noteworthy aspect is the enormous size of the charge of these particles compared with their mass. A numerical example will give you some idea of this. Imagine that we had two iron spheres, each with a radius of one metre, situated ten metres apart, and that we gave each of them a surplus of our negative electrons of such a size that the mass of this surplus was the mil- lionth part of a milligram. The spheres would then repel each other with a force equivalent to a weight of more than 80,000 kilograms and would therefore be able to reach a speed of many metres per second. I need hardly say that we are far from being able to make an experiment on this scale ; we are not in a position to bring such a large number of electrons of one certain kind together on one body. If it were possible, we could carry out many interesting experiments which we can now only imagine. For instance, we could demonstrate the Zeeman effect on a simple pendulum. This can easily be made to s\\ving in a circle, and if the bob is given an electrical charge the vertical component of the earth s magnetic field somewhat alters the period 24 J<f02 H A LORENTZ of rotation, which is increased m one direction and reduced m the other. With the charges which we have at our disposal this difference is completely imperceptible, and Prof Zeeman himself would be unable to observe the Zeeman effect on a pendulum Let us now turn from the relative sizes of charge and mass to their ab- solute values We can at least give an estimate of these If we combme the results to which Zeeman’s experiments lead with those which can be de- duced from the colour dispersion of gases, on the hypothesis that it is the same type of electrons which is under consideration in both cases, we come to the conclusion that the charge of an electron is of the same order of size as the charge of an electrolytic ion The mass, however, is much smaller - about one eight-hundredth part ofthatofa hydrogen atom J J Thomson at Cambridge has confirmed this result by a completely different method At present we are not concerned with the exact value, the principal thmg is that, as we have remarked before, the electron as very small compared with the atom The latter is a composite structure, which can contam many elec- trons, some mobile, some fixed, perhaps it bears electrical charges which are not concentrated at single pomts but distributed m some other way Of the other magneto-optical phenomena I will only describe one m any greater detail Soon after Zeeman had published his discovery the Russian physicists Egorov and Georgievsky found that a sodium flame situated be- tween the poles of an electromagnet emitted partially polarized light - 1 e , m Its beams vibrations in a certam direction were present with a greater intensity than vibrations m the direction perpendicular to this To describe this phenomena to you more exactly and at the same time to make clear how It IS to be explained, I ask you to imagine once more that my hands are opposmg magnetic poles and that the sodium flame is placed between them Now if you were exactly opposite me, you would observe that the vertical electrical vibrations have a greater mtensity than the horizontal ones This IS connected with the fact that the flame has a certam thickness and that the beams emitted by the back half are partly swallowed up agam as they pass through the front half In accordance with a familiar rule, this absorption effect IS strongest when all the incandescent particles in the flame are vibrat- ing svith the same period It diminishes, and the flame therefore becomes brighter, as soon as this uniformity of the period of vibration is disturbed m any way Now the magnetic field docs this, m that mstead of one common period of vibration it causes several to come into play However, the in- 25 ELECTRON THEORY AND LIGHT PROPAGATION crease in illuminating power brought about in this way is restricted to the vertical vibrations in the flame that we are imagining. The horizontal vibra- tions of the electrons, from right to left and back again, are - it follows from the principles of the theory - not at all influenced by the magnetic field. The conclusion therefore is that of the vibrations emitted only the vertical ones and not the horizontal ones are reinforced, which is the cause of the phenomenon we have observed. I may add that this phenomenon is one of those magneto-optical effects which are most easily observed. The explanation given can also be put to the proof by the use of two flames instead of one, and an investigation of the absorption to wliich the Ught of the rear one is subject in the front one which has been situated between the magnetic poles. Now that I have come to absorption, I must also consider the masterly and important theoretical considerations to which Prof. Voigt at Gottingen has been led by Zeeman’s discovery. His theory differs from mine in that he always has in mind, not the emission of Hght, but its absorption. He explains the so-called inverse Zeeman effect -that is, the phenomenon that, when a strong white hght is transmitted through the flame situated between the poles, instead of an absorption stripe we get a triplet of dark lines. On the basis of the parallelism between absorption and emission, it is possible to work back from this inverse phenomenon to the direct one. Voigt does not refer to vibrating electrons; he is content to add appro- priately chosen new terms to the equations which represent propagation in an absorbent medium. This method throws into rehef the connection be- tween the Zeeman effect and the rotation of the direction of vibration which was discovered by Faraday, and has other advantages, namely when vapours of rather high density, with correspondingly wider spectral lines, are con- cerned. Professor Zeeman wiU be able to give you an example of the effects of Voigt’s theory. However, any one who sets himself the task of drawing conclusions about the nature of the vibrations of electrons from these observations will, I think, prefer to choose the emission from very rarefied gases as an object of study. Here the radiation from the single molecules or atoms, undimmed by their effects on each other, is mirrored by the sharp hnes in the spectrum. I followed tliis course in my later research, but came across considerable dif- ficulties due to the fact that although the simple triplet frequently appears, in many cases there is resolution into more than three lines. This is a stumbling- block in the way of the theory. At all events it is easy to draw some general 26 1902 H A LORENTZ rules about the state of polarization of the light beams corresponding to the different components-i e the shape and direction of their vibrations, but unfortunately I have hardly got any further As long as we have to deal only with resolution into three components, it IS sufficient explanation to assume that each mcandescent atom contams a single electron which can vibrate round its equihbnum position in all direc- tions in the same way This simple theory however leaves us high and dry as soon as the spectral hnes spht mto more than three components m the mag- netic field It IS obvious then that we must imagme atoms of more compli- cated structure, which are provided with electrical charges, and the parts of which are capable of making small vibrations, rather hke the parts of an elastic resonant body When I mvestigated the theory of such movements, which can be done without much difficulty, it became evident that such an arbitrary system would m general show no Zeeman effect at all However, no mathematical theory is necessary to perceive this and to fmd the condition necessary to bimg about such an effect Imagine a light source which shows a Zeeman triplet under the influence of a magnetic field The three lines naturally cannot appear unless three types of vibration with slightly diffeient periods ate present in the particles of the light source These periods however can only be different if the directions of movement or the shapes of the path m the three cases are not the same We will say m short that we arc dealing with three different vibration patterns, each with its own frequency, in the light source Wc will now gradually reduce the mtensity of the magnetic field and filially let it disappear As long as even a weak field is present, the three Imes persist, only they draw nearer each other, the three vibration patterns thus always exist, but their frequenaes approach a common limitmg value, the frequency of the unresolved spectral Ime In this way we come to suppose that even when we observe the latter, the three patterns of movement still exist, though without distinguishmg themselves from each other by their frequency as is the case m a magnetic field It can be expressed thus the spectral Imc is already three-fold before the magnetic force comes into play, and this force has nothing else to do except as it were, to push apart the three lines which originally coincided The same applies to a four-, five- or six-fold Ime, and you may rest assured that a spectral hnc will never resolve into six components unless before the magnetic field is set up, each incandcst^t particle can vibrate m six different ways, that is with exactly the same frequency ELECTRON THEORY AND LIGHT PROPAGATION 27 Herein lies one necessary condition which is not quite so easy to fulfil. I could add a second condition for the appearance of clear-cut components of the spectral lines, but the one I have described should suffice to show that in the further development of the theory we cannot give free rein to our imagination. Instead, we are fairly limited in the choice of hypotheses. A suitable model of a vibrating atom would be an elastic spherical shell with a uniformly distributed electrical charge, whose surface is divided by nodal lines into a greater or lesser number of fields vibrating in different directions. However, I wiU not linger over the phenomena which appear in such mod- els, for I fear I might wander too far from reality along these paths. I have tried to delineate in broad outHne how much - or it would be better to say, how litde - the electron theory has achieved in the explanation of the new magneto-optical phenomena. If I were now to give an accomit of the experimental work, it would become clear that the experiments have made more considerable advances. The research workers have already made a start on comparing the different spectral lines of a chemical element with each other, with respect to their magnetic resolution, and on investigating the connection between this resolution and the regular relationships existing in spectra. In this country, where the father of my worthy colleague Angstrom, and Prof.Thalen have worked, and where Prof.Hasselberg continued his ob- servations and measurements with indefatigable ddigence, I hardly need to say how wonderful and rich a world these investigations into spectra have opened up to us. A world whose laws we are beginning to rmderstand. It has become apparent that many line spectra are constructed according to a def- inite type; the lines are arranged in certain series, and in such a way that each series consists of hnes which are distributed over the spectrum in accordance with a fairly simple law, and moreover there are relationships between the one series and the next. These relationships, in the clarification of which Prof. Rydberg and the German physicists Kayser and Runge have been particularly prominent, suggest a connection between the magnetic resolu- tion of lines belonging to the same series. Such a connection has now in fact been confirmed. Runge and Paschen have found, in their investigation of the Zeeman effect in mercury, that all the lines of one series are resolved in exactly the same way. I am convinced that the theory will only make significant progress when it also turns its attention not simply to one single spectral line but to all the lines of a chemical element. When once we succeed in building a theoretical 28 1902 H.A LORENT2 foundation for the structure of spectra, then and not before then will we be able to grasp successfully the more comphcatcd forms of the Zeeman effect. It would be better to say; m the future, research mto the regular relationships m the spectra and into the Zeeman effect must go hand in hand; thus they will be able to lead some day to a theory of light emission, the achievement of which is one of the greatest aims of present-day physics. The electron theory also presents an enormous field of study outside the realm of magneto-optical phenomena. For one thing, the free-movmg elec- trons, with which we ate concerned m cathode rays and in some types of Becquerel rays, give rise to many mteresting problems. I will smgle out only the important question of the so-called apparent mass of these particles. A definite magnetic field m the surrounding ether - and hence also a certam amount of energy m this medium - are inextncably connected with every movement of an electron , we can. therefore never set an electron m motion ivithout simultaneously imparting energy to the ether. To do this a great amount of work is necessary, and we must employ a greater force than if it were not necessary to set up this magnetic field Calculation shows that the force required is the same as would be needed if the mass were somewhat greater than it is in reahty. In other words, if we determine the mass m the usual way from the phenomena, we get the true mass mcreased by an amount ■which we can call the apparent, or electromagnetic, mass The two together form the effective mass which determines the phenomena Now the investigations published by Kaufmann and Abraham in the past year have shown that the apparent mass is by no means to be discounted It certainly forms a considerable part of the effective mass, and there is a pos- sibility that m the end we shall have to ascribe apparent mass only and never true mass at all to electrons. The peculiar thing about diis apparent mass is, moreover, that it is not constant, but depends on the ve/oaty , consequently the study of the motion of the electron differs in many ways from ordinary dynamics It IS hard to say if it will ever be possible to examine further with any suc- cess the question of the nature of an electron, which the research I have men- tioned has already touched on. Meanwhile, even without ascertaining this, we can contmue to test the basic assumptions of the theory in practice, and to draw from the properties of ponderable matter conclusions about the electrons it contains. The conductivity of electricity and heat by metals, thermoclectnaty, permanent and temporary magnets, heat radiation and absorption, the optical, electrical and magnetic properties of crystals - all ELECTRON THEORY AND LIGHT PROPAGATION 39 these aspects promise us a rich harvest. And even farther fields are opening up to our view. If it is true, as had been concluded from optical experiments, that the dimensions of a ponderable body imdergo a slight alteration as soon as it moves through the motionless ether, we must conclude that molecular forces are transmitted through the ether in a way similar to electrical effects, and that leads to the idea that these forces are basically of an electromagnetic nature and the material particles among which they exist are composed of electrons - or, at least, the electrical charges of these particles are not some- thing accidental but somethmg very significant, also where molecular forces are concerned. Thus we hope that the electron hypothesis, as it is being taken up in widely different sectors of physics, will lead to a general theory embracing many aspects of physics and also of chemistry. Perhaps it will be itself completely transformed on the long journey; however, there can hardly be any doubt that our hypotheses about the connection of widely differing phenomena with electromagnetism will prove correct, and that hence, in so far as it relates to the nature of ponderable matter, that general theory wih be an electrochemical one, as BerzeHus already dimly foresaw and as he tried to demonstrate with the resources at his disposal. This is admittedly a prospect of the distant future, and the individual sci- entist can scarcely hope to make any significant contribution to its achieve- ment. As far as I am concerned, I would count myself fortunate if it fell to me, encouraged and spurred on as I am by the high distinction awarded to me by your Academy, to play a modest part in the solution of the problems which next present themselves to us. I close with the warmest thanks for the attention with which you have hstened to me. Biography Hendrik Antoon Lorentz was bom at Ambcm, The Netherlands, on July i8, 1853, as the son of nursery-owmer Gerrit Frederik Lorentz and h:s wife nee Geertruida van Ginkel When he was four years old, his mother died, and m 1862 his father married Luberta Hupkes In those days the grade school did not only have school hours m the morning and in the afternoon, but also in the evening, when teaching was more free (m a sense resemblmg the Dalton method) In this way, when in 1866 the first highschool (H B S )at Arnhem was opened, Hendrik Lorentz, as a gifted pupil, was ready to be placed m the 3rd form After the jlh form and a year of study of the classics, he entered the University of Leyden in 1870, obtained his B Sc degree m mathematics and physics m 1871, and returned to Arnhem m 1872 to become a night- school teacher, at the same time prcparuig for his doctoral thesis on the re- flection and refraction ofhght In 1875, at the early age of 22, he obtained his doctor’s degree, and only three years later he was appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at Leyden, newly created for him In spite of many invi- tations to chairs abroad, he always remained faithful to his Alma Mater From 1912 onward, when he accepted a double function at Haarlem as Curator of Teyler’s Physical Cabinet and Secretary of the «HoUandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen B (Dutch Soacty of Sciences), he contmued at Leyden as Extraordmary Professor, delivering his famous Monday morning lectures for the rest of his life The far-seeing directors of Teyler’s Foundation thus enabled his unique mind to be freed from routine acadeimc obhgations, per- mitting him to spread his wings still further m the highest secluded realms of science, which are attainable by so few From the start of his sacntific work, Lorentz took it as his task to extend James Clerk Maxwell’s theory of electricity and ofhght Already in his doc- tor’s thesis, he treated the reflection and refraction phenomena of light from this standpoint which was then qmte new His fundamental work m the fields of optics and eicctriaty has revolutionized contemporary conceptions of the nature of matter In 1 878, he published an essay on the relation between the velocity of light BIOGRAPHY 31 in a medium and the density and composition thereof. The resulting formula, proposed almost simultaneously by the Danish physicist Lorenz, has become known as the Lorenz-Lorcntz formula. Lorentz also made fundamental contributions to the study of the pheno- mena of movmg bodies. In an extensive treatise on the aberration of hght and the problems arising in coimection with it, he followed A. J. Fresnel’s hy- pothesis of the existence of an immovable ether, which freely penetrates all bodies. This assumption formed the basis of a general theory of the electrical and optical phenomena of moving bodies. From Lorentz stems the conception of the electron; his view that his inin- ute, electrically charged particle plays a role during electromagnetic pheno- mena in ponderable matter made it possible to apply the molecular theory to the theory of electricity, and to explain the behaviour of light waves passing through moving, transparent bodies. The so-called Lorentz transformation (1904) was based on the fact that electromagnetic forces between charges are subject to slight alterations due to their motion, resulting in a minute contraction in the size of moving bo- dies. It not only adequately explains the apparent absence of the relative mo- tion of the Earth with respect to the ether, as indicated by the experiments of Michelson and Morley, but also paved the way for Einstein’s special theory of relativity. It may well be said that Lorentz was regarded by all theoretical physicists as the world’s leading spirit, who completed what was left unfinished by his predecessors and prepared the ground for the fruitful reception of the new ideas based on the quantum theory. In 1919, he was appointed Chairman of the Committee whose task it was to study the movements of sea water which could be expected during and after the reclamation of the Zuyderzee in The Netherlands, one of the great- est works of all times in hydraulic engineering. His theoretical calculations, the result of eight years of pioneering work, have been confirmed in actual practice in the most striking manner, and have ever since been of permanent value to the science of hydraulics. An overwhelming number of honours and distinctions from all over the world were bestowed on Lorentz. International gatherings were presided over byliim with exceptional skill, both on account of his amiable and ju- dicious personality and his masterly command of languages. Until his death he was Chairman of all Solvay Congresses, and in 1923 he was elected to the membership of the «Intemational Committee of Intellectual Coopera- 32 1902 H A LORENTZ tion » of the League of Nations Of this Committee, consisting of only seven of the world’s most eminent scholars, he became the President m 1925 Through his great prestige m governmental arcles in his own country, Lorentz was able to convince them of the importance of science for national production He thus imtiated the steps which finally led to the creation of the organisation now generally known under the mitials T N O (Dutch for AppUed Scientific Research) Lorentz was a man of immense personal charm The very picmre of unself- ishness, full of genume mierest in whoever had the privilege of crossmg his path, he endeared himself both to the leaders of his age and to the ordmary atizen In 1881 Lorentz married Aletta Catharma Kaiser, whose father, J W Kai- ser, Professor at the Academy of Fmc Arts, was the Director of the Museum which later became the well-known Rijksmuscum (National Gallery) of Amsterdam, and the designer of the first postage stamps of The Netherlands There were two daughters and one son from this marriage The eldest daughter Dr Gecrtruida Luberta Lorentz 1$ a physicist m her own right and married Professor W J de Haas, Director of the Cryogenic Laboratory (Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory) of the University of Leyden Lorentz died at Haarlem on February 4, 1928 Pieter Zeeman Light radiation in a magnetic field Nobel Lecture, May 2, 1^03 As Professor Lorentz told you last December, immediately after hearing of the great and very honourable distmetion awarded to us, we set to work to see how best to co-ordinate our two lectures. To my great regret I was un- able to be present here for Professor Lorentz’s lecture, but he was able to report to you on present electron theory from his viewpoint, only briefly touching on the experimental investigations which have occupied me in recent years. I hope that you will allow me therefore to emphasize these experimental investigations. Two fields of physics, light and magnetism, are combined in the subject of today’s lecture, whose history dates only from the days of Michael Faraday. The wonderful discovery of the connection between light and magnetism, which he made in 1845, was the reward for an investigation carried out with indefatigable patience and tenacity. Today we call this coimection the magnetic rotation of the polarization plane. Fara- day succeeded in showing that the plane in which light oscillations take place, IS rotated as soon as light passes through special magnetizable bodies along the lines of force. Faraday liimself called his discovery the magnetization of light and the illumination of magnetic hnes of force. His contempories did not understand this name, which perhaps corresponded more to what he was searching for than to what he found. Throughout his hfe his hopes, desires and yearnings led him to make repeated investigations into the con- nection between hght, magnetism, and electricity. The last experiment recorded in Faraday’s laboratory notebook and osten- sibly the last in his life, gives an indication of the extent to which his spirit was still occupied with the boundary region of possible phenomena. It was on March 12, 1862, in the laboratory of the Royal Institution that Faraday carried out this experiment. The notes in his notebook, although not quite clear, leave no doubt that he was attempting to demonstrate by means of a spectroscope that magnetism has a direct effect on a light source. te result was however absolutely negative, and Faraday writes in his note- 00 «not the slightest effect demonstrable either with polarized or unpolar- ized light ». 34 1902 P ZEEMAN Perhaps it was because of this observation that Maxwell, at a meeting of the British Association m Liverpool on September 15, 1870, said of the light-radiating particles m a flame « that no force m nature can alter even very shghtly either their mass or their period of oscillation*, a statement which, coming from the mouth of the founder of the electromagnetic light theory and spoken with such intensity, must really surprise present-day physicists It was not simply out of a spirit of contradiction that I exposed a light source to magnetic forces The idea came to me durmg an investigation of the effect discovered by Kerr on light reflected by magnetic mirrors When it IS a question of splitting up the light of a lummous gas into very fme detail, the simple glass prism of Newton and Frauenhofer is of no use, and the physicist has recourse to the excellent aid which we owe to Row- land the concave grating Most physics institutes possess this polished metal imrror with a very large number of grooves, say 50,000 over a width of 10 cm scratched on by means of a diamond A beam of compound light is no longer reflected by the lined surface m the ordinary way, instead each special kmd of light follows its oivn path Of course the light source must be very restricted for the large number of beams correspondmg to the various kinds of light to appear separately This is ensured by pkcmg the light source behind an opaque screen with a linear slit The spectral image produced can be observed, and from the location and intensity of the Imear-sht images we can determine how the different kinds of light in the hght bemg studied arc distributed on the basis of the period of oscillation and intensity A further mam advantage of Rowland’s gratmg is that It is now no longer scratched on plane surfaces, but on spherical concave surfaces with a radius of say 3 metres, so that real images are produced of lummous lines wthout the need for the msertion of lenses Moreover, pho- tography has made it possible to fix these images and now provides us with a permanent record of each observed spectrum, which can be measured out at any time When we study the well-known Bunsen sodium flame by means of Rowland’s grating, we see a spectrum consistmg mainly of two separate sharp yellow lines, which m our gratmg lie about i mm from each other Wc see that sodium radiation consists of two kmds of hght, the periods of oscillation of which differ only very shghtly (i in 1000) from each other Wc confined our attention exclusively to one of these two Imes I must ask you now to go with me mto the Physics Institute of Leiden University In August, 1896 , 1 exposed the sodium flame to large magnetic 35 LIGHT RADIATION IN MAGNETIC FIELD forces by placing it between the poles of a strong electromagnet. Again I studied the radiation of the flame by means of Rowland’s mirror, the ob- servations being made in the direction perpendicular to the lines of force. Each line, wliich in the absence of the effect of the magnetic forces was very sharply defined, was now broadened. This indicated that not only the orig- inal oscillations, but also others with greater and again others with smal- ler periods of oscillation were being radiated by the flame. The change was however very small. In an easily produced magnetic field it corresponded to a thirtieth of the distance between the two sodium lines, say two tenths of an Angstrom, a unit of measure whose name will always recall to phys- icists the meritorious work done by the father of my esteemed colleague. Had we really succeeded therefore in altering the period of vibration, which Maxwell, as I have just noted, held to be impossible? Or was there some disturbing circumstances from one or more factors which distorted the result? Several of such might be mentioned. We doubted the result. We studied the light source in the direction of the magnetic force, we perforated the poles of the magnet ; but even in the direc- tion of the magnetic lines of force we found that our result was confirmed. We also studied the reverse phenomenon, the absorption of light in sodium vapour, and this too satisfied our expectations. We then asked, do different substances behave in different ways? What happens when the magnetic force is raised to the maximum attainable values? How do different hues of the same substance behave? But before these questions could be answered, theory took over. I was in fact able to verify experimentally some conclusions which fol- lowed from the theory of optical and electrical phenomena of my esteemed teacher and friend Professor Lorentz. This theory assumes that all bodies contain small electrically charged mass particles, « electrons », and that all elec- trical and optical processes are based on the position and motion of these « electrons®. Light oscillations result from the vibration of the « electrons®. On the basis of Lorentz’s theory, if we limit ourselves to a single spectral line, it suffices to assume that each atom (or molecule) contains a single moving electron. Now if this electron is displaced from its equilibrium position, a force that is directly proportional to the displacement restores it like a pendulum to its position of rest. In this model the electrons are represented by the red balls and the direction of the magnetic force by the arrows. Now all oscillatory movements of such an electron can be conceived of as being spht up into 1902 P ZEEMAN 36 force, and two circular oscillations perpendicular to this direction rotating in opposite directions In the absence of a magnetic field the period of all these oscillations is the same But as soon as the electron is exposed to the effect of a magnetic field, its motion changes Accordmg to well-known electro- dynamic laws, an electron moving m a magnetic field is acted upon by a force which runs perpendicular to the direction of motion of the electron and to the direction of the magnetic field, and whose magnitude is easily determined Here the rectilmear oscillation is not changed by the magnetic field, the period remams the same , on the other hand the two circular oscil- lations arc subjected to new forces which, runnmg parallel with the radius, either increase or decrease the origmal central force In the first case the period of oscillation is reduced, m the second it is increased Now It IS easy to determme the light motion to which this type of motion of the electrons will lead Let us consider first what happens m a direction runnmg perpendicular to the lines of force To the three electron motions there correspond three elec- trical oscillations, or m terms of the electromagnetic light theory three light oscillations of different periods Thus the light source will emit /ftrec-colour light instead of the origmal OHC-colour light Therefore, mstead of the single non-polarized spectral line we shall see tliree separate lines when we place the light source m a magnetic field The different directions of oscillation of the electrons affect the polarization state of the emitted hght The light of the middle component oscillates m parallel with, and that of the outer com- ponents perpendicular to the lines of force I will presently show you as an illustration a Ime which actually displays this behaviour postulated by Prof Lorentz's theory But let us first consider the rays which run parallel with the lines offeree For this purpose I will rotate the model so that the arrow pomts in your direction The opposite circutar osci’Dations of the electrons excite two cir- cularly polarized rays rotating m opposite directions, one havmg a longer and the other a shorter period of oscillation than the original spectral Ime The original spectral Ime splits up under the action of the magnetic field mto two components which arc arcularly polarized m opposite directions The hght source eimts two colour light I would now like to project for you two enlargements of photographs taken with the aid of Rowland’s gratmg * The Imes are cadmium Imes In the first half of the picture you can see the unchanged Ime, and m the second * A number of lantern slides were projected in the course of the lecture 37 LIGHT RADIATION IN MAGNETIC FIELD rectilinear oscillations occurring in the direction of the magnetic lines of half the line changed by magnetic forces, the so-called triplet, which we see in the direction perpendicular to the lines of force. Secondly I will project for you a cadmium line observed in the direction of the lines of force. The first half of the picture shows the unchanged line, and the second half the double line or doublet produced by the magnetic forces. You see how beautifully the consequences following from Prof. Lorentz’s theory were confirmed by observation in these cases. I should point out, however, that at first some difficulty was experienced in observing the phe- nomena predicted by the theory, owing to the extreme smalhiess of the variations in the period of oscillation. I have just said that the change was extremely small; but it could be said that it was unexpectedly large. The magnetic cleavage of the spectral lines is dependent on the size of the charge of the electron, or, more accurately, on the ratio between the mass and the charge of the electron. Let us see what the observations teach us. When Prof. Lorentz pubhshed his theory in 1895, no data were available from which to estimate the ratio between the mass and the charge of the light-exciting particles, and in this theory the ratio was left undefined. We can now calculate this ratio from the magnitude of the magnetic splitting of the spectral lines: it is lo^ e.g.s. units per gram, a colossal number even for the physicist, since it is 1,000 times as great as the similar number which was known from electrolysis phenomena in the case of hydrogen atoms. This makes it most probable for the physicist that in the luminous particles only ca. i/i, 000th of the atom oscillates, and that the main mass of the atom remains virtually stationary. The oscillating electrons and the electrolysis ions were found to be not identical with each other; if they had been, the splitting of the spectral lines would have been only one thousandth of that observed, and then I should not have had the honour of addressing you in Stockholm today. A further question must also be answered here and now, namely, are the oscillating particles positively or negatively charged? We observed the doublet in the direction of the magnetic Hnes of force and studied the sign of the polarization. Then I suddenly resolved the prob- lem. the oscillating electrons are negatively charged. W^e now know that cathode rays, which can occur in tubes filled with highly rarefied gases, are negative particles with the same high charge/mass ratio. We can conclude that that which vibrates in the light source is the same as that which travels in cathode rays. 38 1902 P ZEEMAN Wc can hardly avoid recalling die two titles of Faraday’s basic work; «Magnetization.of ligKts,«Illumjtiatioii of lines of force»They appear to us to be almost prophesies, because we have now seen that light can m fact be magnetized, and according to Prof. Arrhenius’s theory we have in nature Itself, m the northern lights, an example of illumination of the magnetic Imes of force of the Earth by the electrons escapmg from the sun Nature gives us all, mcludmg Prof.Lorcntz, surprises. It was very quickly found that there are many exceptions to the rule of splittmg of the hncs only mto triplets. The French physicist Cornu was perhaps the first to observe that, contrary to the elementary theory, in some cases sphtting into four lines, a quadruplet, occurs. In other cases splitting into five, six or even nine lines can be observed. In the hne-nch spectrum of iron we find a whole selection of different forms. Very soon a number of physicists were working m the extended field, I need only name Becquerel, Cotton, Michelson, Preston, Righi, Runge, and Paschen. If I had more time at my disposal, I would gladly deal in greater detail with the work of the last-mentioned investigators. For the present, however, I must confine myself to projecting a cadmium line for you, which is split up mto four lines, and negatives of a mercury line which has split up mto nmc components, and for which I am grateful to Prof.Runge. But despite this very complicated sphttmg-up, even when larger aids ate used, the division mto three groups of oscillations, two perpendicular to and one parallel with the Imcs of force, assumed in Lorentz’s elementary theory, remains valid, as this photograph of the nonet shows It was natural that, soon after I had succeeded m sphttmg up Imcs, I should also study how the different lines behave m this respect I was soon able to show by mvestigatmg the zme Imcs that there are great differences m the split- tmg-up of different Imes of a substance. Particularly great differences were fovmd m Imes belongmg to different scries, the discovery of which we owe to t’nelucidmvestigations ofyourcountryman'Prof.Kydberg, and in partic- ular Professors Kajscr and Runge. I found very great differences m the Imes of the different senes, and it ap- peared that the sphttmg-up, contrary to the postulations of the elementary theory, expressed m the scale of osallation frequencies, is not the same for all lines m the same magnetic field. We can conclude from this on the basis of Lorentz’s theory that the chaige/mass ratio is not the same for all electrons. I would now like to talk about three separate phenomena, first a phenom- enon which I have not been able to observe, secondly phenomena which I have hardly been able to venf), and thirdly a surprising phenomenon 39 LIGHT RADIATION IN MAGNETIC FIELD All the results which have been discussed so far have related to hue spectra ; but in the case of many bodies we also know of the existence of band spectra. Here a difference is found: the band spectrum displayed by iodine vapour or bromine vapour as an absorption medium at low temperatures, remains un- changed in a magnetic field; I personally have been unable to bring about any change in the extremely accurate images which Prof.Hasselberg has given us of the absorption spectra of bromine and iodine vapour, even with the strongest magnetic fields. We are indebted to Prof. Voigt in Gottingen for a comprehensive theory of magneto-optical phenomena. The triplet you have seen today was ab- solutely symmetrical, as postulated in the elementary theory. Now on the basis of his theory Prof. Voigt was able to predict that as a result of the action of tueak magnetic forces asymmetry should occur. According to him, the two external components should have different light intensities and be at different distances from the centre line. In the case of iron, zinc, and cadmium lines I was able to observe both asymmetries; because of their extreme small- ness, however, I cannot demonstrate the phenomena in the projector. However, another phenomenon, which -vvill give you some idea of the scope of Voigt’s theory, is more striking. In this phenomenon Faraday’s magnetic rotation of the polarization plane and the magnetic splitting of the spectral lines, are intimately connected with each other. The rotation of the polarization plane is e^ttraordinardy small in all gases, thus also in sodium vapour. As Macaluso and Corbino found, it is only in the case of those colours which lie close to an absorption band of the vapour that the rotation is very great, of the order of i8o°, and the rotation takes place in the positive direction, the direction of the current exciting the magnet. What about the rotation inside the absorption band? Prof Voigt was able to predict that in the case of highly rarefied vapours the rotation must be negative in the zone between the two components of the doublet, i.e. opposite in direction to that outside the band, and also very great. I had the pleasure of confirming this theoretical finding in experiments on sodium vapour. Provided that the vapour is higlrly rarefied, the rotation in very strong fields between the lines of the doublet can rise to —400°. To give you some idea of the distribution of the rotations, I will show you two negatives connected with this investigation. The magnetic field is not set up. The two dark vertical lines are the absorption lines of sodium vapour, the well-known D-hnes. The reason why they are so broad is that the vapour 40 1902 F ZEEMAN was very dense The horizontal hands are interference bands which were produced by means of a special device They indicate the points where the direction of oscillation is the same The directions of osallation in each of the successive bands differ by i8o“ Now as soon as the magnetic field is set up we get the image now being projected On each side of each of the D Imes the bands bend tipwar^s the more so the smaller the distance^ heciuse the rotation m the vicinity of the bands grows very rapidly and reaches almost i8o° in the immediate neigh- bourhood of the bands Within the bands a blurred band only is visible The phenomenon becomes far clearer once the vapour is highly rarefied The bands boundmg the components nse as before At the same time, hov.- ever, the inner band becomes detached, it has fallen, the rotation is negative In our third image the rotationin the case of one of the D-hnes is about — 90“’, m the other everything is more blurred, the rotation is about — 180® Summarizing briefly the results of the tests described in the light of Lo- rentz’s theory, it can be stated that firm support has been found for the asser- tion that electricity occurs at thousands of points where we at most conjec tured that it was present Innumerable electrical particles oscillate m every flame and light source We can m fact assume that every heat source is filled with electrons whicli will contmue to oscillate ceaselessly and indefinitely All these electrons leave their impression on the emitted rays Wc can hope that experimental study of the radiation phenomena, which arc exposed to various influences, but in particular to the effect of magnetism, will provide us with useful data concemmg a new field, that of atomistic astronomy, as Lodge called it, populated with atoms and electrons instead of planets and worlds I count myself fortunate to be able to contribute to this work, and the great interest which the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences lias shown in my work and the recognition that it has paid to my past successes, convince me that I am not on the wrong track Biography Pieter Zeeman was born on May 25, 1865, at Zonneniaire, a small village in the isle of Schouwen, Zeeland, The Netherlands, as the son of the local cler- gymen Catharinus Forandinus Zeeman and his wife, nee Wilhelmina Worst. After having finished his secondary school education at Zierikzee, the main town of the island, he went to Delft for two years to receive tuition in the classical languages, an adequate knowledge of which was required at that time for entrance to the miiversity. Takmg up his abode at the house of Dr. J. W. Lely, conrector of the Gynmasium and brother of Dr. C. Lely ( Minister of Public Works and known for initiating and developing the work for re- clamation of the Zuyderzee), Zeeman came into an environment which was beneficial for the development of his scientific talents. It was here also that he came into contact with Kamerlingh Onnes (Nobel Prize in Physics for 1913 )> who was twelve years his senior. Zeeman’s \\vide reading, which included a proper mastery of works such as Maxwell’s Heat, and his passion for per- forming experiments amazed KamerHiigh Onnes in no small degree, and formed the basis for a fruitful friendship beween the two scientists. Zeeman entered Leyden University in 1885 became mainly a pupil of Kamerhngh Omies (mechanics) and Lorentz (experimental physics): the latter was later to share the Nobel Prize with him. An early reward came in 1890 when he was appointed assistant to Lorentz, enabhng liim to participate in an extensive research programme which mcluded the study of the Kerr effect -an important foundation for his future great work. He obtained his doctor’s degree in 1893, after which he left for F. Kohlrausch’s institute at Strasbourg, where for one semester he carried out work under E. Cohn. He returned to Leyden in 1894 and became «privaat-docent» (extra-mural lec- turer) from 1895 to 1897. In 1897, the year folio whig his great discovery of the magnetic splitting of spectral lines, he was called to a lectureship at the University of Amsterdam; hi 1900 came his appointment as Extraordinary Professor. In 1908 Van der Waals (Nobel Prize in Physics for 1910) reached the retiring age of 70 and Zeeman was chosen as his successor, at the same time functioning as Director of the Physics Laboratory. In 1923 a new laboratory, specially erected for 42 1902 P ZEEMAN him, was put at his disposal, a promment feature bemg a concrete block weighmg a quarter of a milhon kilograms, erected free from the floor, as a suitable platform for vibration-free experiments The institute is now known as the Zeeman Laboratory of Amsterdam University Many world-famous scientists have visited Zeeman there or worked ivith him for some time He remamed m this dual function for 35 years-on numerous occasions refusmg an mvitation to occup) a Chair abroad-until m 1935 he had to resign on account of his pensionable age An accomphshed teacher and of kmd disposi- tion he was much loved by his pupils One of these was C J Bakker, who was from 1955 until his untimely death m an aircraft accident m i960 the General Director of the Centre Europeen desRccherches Nucleaircs (CERN) at Geneva Another worker m his laboratory was S Goudsimt, whoini925 withG E Uhlenbeck originated the concept of electron spin Zeeman’s talent for natural sacnce first became apparent m 1883, when, while still attendmg the secondary school, he gave an apt description and drawing of an aurora boreahs-then clearly to be observed m his country- which was pubhshed in Nautre (The Editor praised the meticulous observa- tions of Kprofessor Zeeman m his observatory at Zonnemaire**) Zeeman’s mam theme of mvcstigation has always concerned optical phe- nomena His first treatise Mesures relatives dit phhiomhie de Ken, written m 1892, was rewarded with a Gold Medal from the Dutch Society of Sciences at Haarlem, his doaor’s thesis dealt with the same subject In Strasbourg he studied the propagation and absorption of electrical waves m fluids His prin- cipal work, however, was the study of the influence of magnetism on the nature of hght radiation, started by him m the summer of 1 896, which form- ed a logical contmuation of his investigation into the Kerr effect The discov- ery of the so-called Zeeman effect, for which he has been awarded the Nobel Prize, was communicated to the Royal Academy of Sciences m Amsterdam -through H Kamcrlingh Onnes {1896) and J D van der Waals (i897)-m the form of papers entitled Over den Invloed eeiier Magnetisatie op den Aard van hetdooreen StofmtgezcndenLuht [On the influence of a magnetization on the nature of hght emitted by a substance) and Over Doiiblelten en Tripletten in het Spectrim ten ecggehracht door Uitivendige Magnetische Krachten (On doublets and triplets in the spectrum caused by external magnetic forces) I, II and III (The English translations of these papers appeared m The Philosophical Maga~ ziiiL , of the first paper a French version appeared in Archil cs Ncerlaiidaises des Sciences E.\\acres et Natiirelles, and m a short form in German m Verhandinngen der PhysiLahschcn GcselUchaft zu Berlin ) BIOGRAPHY 43 The importance of the discovery can at once be judged by the fact that at one stroke the phenomenon not only confirmed Lorentz’ theoretical conclu- sions with regard to the state of polarization of the light emitted by flames, but also demonstrated the negative nature of the oscillating particles, as well as the unexpectedly liigh ratio of their charge and mass {ejni).
