        "text": "Lived 1877 – 1944.\n\nCharles Barkla won the 1917 Nobel Prize in Physics for showing that X-rays emitted by any substance are related solely to the chemical elements present in the substance. This means the emitted X-rays act as a form of fingerprinting to identify which elements are present in any material.\n\nPersonal and Career Details\n\nCharles Glover Barkla was born to middle class parents in Widnes, England, UK. His father was John Martin Barkla, a manager with the Atlas Chemical Company. His mother was Sarah Glover, the daughter of a watchmaker.\n\nBarkla was educated at a grammar school, Liverpool Institute High School, from which he won a scholarship to Liverpool University, about 10 miles from home. He studied Mathematics and Physics, graduating with a first class honors degree in Physics in 1898, followed by a Master’s degree in Physics in 1899.\n\nIn 1899, age 22, he began postgraduate work at the University of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory studying electromagnetic waves. His supervisor was J. J. Thomson, the discoverer of the electron. In 1902, Barkla began his Nobel Prize winning work at the Cavendish Laboratory. He completed it at Liverpool University, where he moved in 1903.\n\nBarkla was awarded a Bachelor of Arts research degree by Cambridge in 1903, and a DSc by Liverpool in 1904.\n\nIn 1909, with the widespread recognition of his X-ray work’s importance, Barkla was appointed Wheatstone Professor of Physics at the University of London. In 1913, age 36, he became Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He remained in this position until his death.\n\nBarkla was a committed Christian – a Methodist. He regarded his scientific work as part of his personal quest for God. He had an excellent bass singing voice and sang in the chapel choir at King’s College, Cambridge.\n\nBarkla married Mary Esther Cowell in 1907. They had a daughter and two sons.\n\nCharles Glover Barkla died, aged 67, at home in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK on October 23, 1944. His youngest son, Flight Lieutenant Michael Barkla had been killed the previous year in an accident in North Africa, where he was working as a surgeon during World War 2.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAuthor of this page: The Doc\n\nImages digitally enhanced and colorized by this website. © All rights reserved.\n\nCite this Page\n\nPlease use the following MLA compliant citation:\n\n\"Charles Barkla.\" Famous Scientists. famousscientists.org. 14 Mar. 2018.
