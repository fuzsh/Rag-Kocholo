        "text": "Charles Barkla was a British physicist who was awarded the 1917 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery that elements have a characteristic X-ray spectrum, which enables them to be identified. He also formulated laws governing the scattering of X-rays and their transmission through solids."
