Many astronomers believe supermassive black holes may lie at the center of these galaxies and power their explosive energy output.\n\nadaptive optics: A technique that compensates for atmospheric turbulence by quickly adjusting the light path in the optics. This removes seeing effects and enables the telescope to achieve much better resolution, closer to its theoretical resolving power.\n\nAerobee: A small rocket built by Aerojet General in the 1940s and 1950s. Aerobees were used for high atmospheric and cosmic radiation research and could carry payloads to approximately 230 km above Earth.\n\nafterglow: Outflows of gamma-ray bursts decrease in temperature over a matter of hours.

The three members of the Apollo 11 crew were Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.\n\nApollo Program: The Apollo program was NASAâs third human space flight program. Between the years of 1966 and 1972, the Apollo program launched 17 missions with the goal of putting a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. In 1969, the goal was realized with the Apollo 11 mission. Five more missions had successful lunar landings and returns. During the missions, lunar rocks and soil samples were collected and returned to Earth for study.\n\narcminute: An angular measurement equal to 1/60th of a degree.\n\narcsecond: An angular measurement equal to 1/60th of an arcminute.\n\nArgonne National Laboratory: Argonne National Laboratory is a United States Department of Energy (DOE) research laboratory in Argonne, IL. Argonne conducts basic research, technology development and prototype development and testing. The lab was started in 1942 when Enrico Fermiâs nuclear reaction experiments were moved out of Chicago due to the danger they posed to a major city. It was formally chartered as Argonne National Laboratory in 1946 and began developing nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes.\n\nArmstrong, Neil (1930-2012): An American astronaut who was the first person to walk on the Moon. He commanded two space flights; the first as the command pilot of Gemini 8, and the second as the mission commander of Apollo 11.

Most asteroids are made of rock, but some are composed of metal, mostly nickel and iron. They range in size from small boulders to objects that are hundreds of miles in diameter. A small portion of the asteroid population may be burned-out comets whose ices have evaporated away and been blown off into space. Almost all asteroids are part of the Main Asteroid Belt, with orbits in the vast region of space between Mars and Jupiter. Some asteroids pass very close to Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\nastigmatism: A defect in an lens that prevents light rays from focusing at one point resulting in a blurred image.\n\nastronomical unit: An Astronomical Unit is the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.

The AEC was subsequently abolished by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 and succeeded by the Energy Research and Development Administration (now part of the U.S. Department of Energy) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nAuger (Pierre) Cosmic Ray Observatory: The Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory is dedicated to studying ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the most energetic and rarest of particles in the Universe. When such a particle strikes the Earth's atmosphere, it creates a shower of lower energy secondary particles, and these are observed to reach the ground. In fact, about a hundred of these secondary particles pass through our bodies every second. But as the energy level increases, the number of particles becomes more and more rare. At 1019eV, only about two particles per square mile arrives at the upper atmosphere per year. Above 1020eV, only about two particles per square mile arrive each century. To find and measure these rare events, a high-energy cosmic ray study needs a truly giant detector, like the 35-mile by 35-mile detector in MalargÃ¼e, Argentina, where it occupies an area as large as the state of Rhode Island. Even with an array so large, Auger detects cosmic rays and gamma rays so energetic that they occur at the rate of only a few a year.\n\naurora: Auroras are colorful, shimmering lights that occur around the poles of planets and some moons, such as Earth, Saturn, Jupiter and Io, a moon of Jupiter. In the case of Earth, particles from solar flares penetrate the upper atmosphere around the magnetic poles. These particles react with and excite the oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere, causing colorful light displays. The plural of aurora is sometimes spelled aurorae.\n\nazimuth: The distance in degrees along the horizon, westward from the south point of the horizon, to the place where a vertical circle through the star or other object intersects the horizon.\n\nB\n\nBachall, John (1934- 2005): An American astrophysicst who helped develop the Hubble Space Telescope.

One of his most significant discoveries was the polarization of X-rays, which indicated that they were more similar to light on the optical spectrum than previously believed. He was a member of the Royal Society and received the Hughes Medal (awarded for original discoveries in the field of physics) in 1917.\n\nbaryonic matter: All material made of of protons, neutrons and electrons.\n\nBecklin, Eric: Eric Becklin is an American astrophysicist at the University of California at Los Angeles. He is the Chief Scientist for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Becklin is also recognized for his scientific research, including his discovery with Gerry Neugebauer of a bright infrared source within Orion, known as the Becklin-Neugebauer Object.\n\nBell Labs: Bell Labs is a research and development firm with facilities in eight countries. It is a subsidiary of French-owned Alcatel-Lucent. In the 1930s, one of Bell Labs engineers, Karl Jansky discovered the first radio signals from an astronomical source marking the beginning of the field of radio astronomy.\n\nBeppoSAX: Launched on April 30, 1996, BeppoSAX was a Italian-Dutch X-ray astronomy satellite named in honor of Italian physicist, Giuseppe \"Beppo\" Occhialini. SAX stands for Satellite per Astronomia a raggi X (Italian for Satellite for X-ray Astronomy). BeppoSAX helped determine the origin of gamma-ray bursts. It ceased operations on May 2, 2002 and reentered Earth's atmosphere on April 29, 2003.\n\nBessel, Friedrich (1784-1846): A German astronomer and mathematician who made many advances in the precise measurement of the stars over his lifetime. In 1838, he was the first to record a reliable measurement of the measurement of a star which allowed him to calculate the distance to the star.\n\nbeta radiation (Î²): Beta radiation occurs when an electron is emitted from a nucleus along with an antineutrino, a very small particle which carries away some of the energy of the emission.\n\nBig Bang: The expansion of the Universe from a very small volume filled with energy, electrons, and quarks through a cooling phase including nucleosynthesis and the eventual creation of galaxies. Today's galaxies still reflect the expansion set in place by the Big Bang. What happened before the Big Bang, namely the creation of a very massive, hot aggregate of subatomic particles, electrons, and photons, is unknown and is a question at the frontier of physics. In the beginning, in the quark phase, the excited material began to collide as the Universe continued to expand and cool, forming neutrons and protons (hydrogen). The collisions of the atomic particles would then form the more complex elements, helium and lithium. At three minutes old, the temperature of the Universe was 1 billion degrees. It took 400,000 years for the Universe to cool enough to sustain the creation of elements with larger nuclei.\n\nBikini Atoll: Bikini is a large coral atoll, a coral reef in a ring-shaped structure, in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. between 1946 and 1958, 23 test of nuclear devices were conducted by the United States.

Black holes that are remnants of supernovae have masses of a few solar masses. Clusters of massive stars may lead to multiple supernovae which leave behind multiple black holes that subsequently merge into single objects with masses of millions of solar masses. Black holes responsible for quasars have masses of billions of solar masses.\n\nBlackett, Patrick (1897- 1974): An English experimental physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1948.

Source\n\nCerenkov counter: Cerenkov counters detect the bluish light from gamma rays from astronomical objects when they hit the upper atmosphere of Earth. The gamma rays produce pairs of electrons and positrons (positively and negatively charged particles) that are moving very fast. These particles have velocities above the speed of light in the atmosphere (a speed known as the phase velocity which is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the index of refraction of air) creating a disturbance, the energy from which is emitted as blue light. The effect is analogous to a sonic boom of a supersonic aircraft or bullet. Also spelled Cherenkov.\n\nChandra X-Ray Observatory: Named for Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, The Chandra X-Ray Observatory was launched by NASA on July 23, 1999 on the space shuttle. It is specially designed to detect X-ray emission from very hot regions of the Universe such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and matter around black holes. Because X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, Chandra must orbit above it, up to an altitude of 139,000 km (86,500 mi) in space. Chandra carries four very sensitive mirrors nested inside each other. The energetic X-rays strike the insides of the hollow shells and are focussed onto electronic detectors at the end of the 9.2-m (30-ft.) optical bench. Depending on which detector is used, very detailed images or spectra of the cosmic source can be made and analyzed.\n\nChandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan (1937-1995): Indian astrophysicist reknowned for creating theoretical models of white dwarf stars, among other achievements. His equations explained the underlying physics behind the creation of white dwarfs, neutron stars and other compact objects.\n\nCherenkov Light: The blue light emitted when charged particles or gamma-rays interact with air molecules as they travel through the Earthâs atmosphere. It is named after Russian scientist Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov (1904-1990). Pavel shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics with colleagues for discovering and interpreting the âCherenkov Effect,â the observed light that results when high-energy particles pass through matter at a speed greater than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).\n\ncircumgalactic medium: The generally invisible environment around the visible part of a galaxy, consisting of gravitational and electromagnetic fields and flows of matter in and out of the galaxy.\n\nClark, George: An American astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology who worked with Bruno Rossi and Riccardo Giacconi in the 1960s to develop the first telescope that focused X-rays using grazing-incidence mirrors.\n\nClemson University: Clemson University was opened in 1893 as Clemson College, an all-male military school.

The output is activated only when signals are received within a time window accepted as at the same time and in parallel at both inputs. Coincidence circuits are widely used in particle physics experiments and in other areas of science and technology. Source\n\nColgate, Stirling: An American physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In the 1950s while at Livermore National Laboratory, Colgate oversaw the testing of the first thermonuclear bomb, called Bravo test.\n\ncollapsar: This core collapse occurs while the outer layers of the star explode in an especially energetic supernova dubbed a \"hypernova\" by astronomers. The term collapsar was coined in 1993 by Stan Woosley, an Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nColumbia University: Columbia University is a private Ivy League research university. It is located in New York City and was established in 1754.\n\ncollimated: Light in which the beams are parallel.\n\ncomet: Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust roughly the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of kilometers.\n\ncompact star: A massive star with a small radius. Also known as a compact object. White dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes are all compact objects.\n\nCompton, Arthur Holly (1892-1962): An American physicist who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1927 for work on scattering of high-energy photons by electrons, a process central to the gamma-ray detection techniques of all four instruments onboard the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory which was named for him.\n\nCompton Gamma-Ray Observatory: Named for Arthur Holly Compton, an astrophysicist from the University of Chicago, CGRO was the second of NASA's Great Observatories, launched in April 1991 on the space shuttle Atlantis. At 17 tons, it was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at the time of its launch. The instruments aboard CGRO covered an unprecedented six decades of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 30 keV to 30 GeV. In order of increasing spectral energy coverage, these instruments were the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), the Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment (OSSE), the Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL), and the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET). For each of the instruments, an improvement in sensitivity of better than a factor of ten was realized over previous missions. Within months of its launch, BATSE allowed astronomers to monitor the distribution of the gamma-ray bursts across the sky. It was soon clear that they are detected at a rate of about one per day, from all directions.Compton is responsible for the view that gamma-ray bursts are extragalactic. The mission ended in 2000.\n\nconstellation: A pattern of stars visible from Earth in the night sky. Most constellations are made up of stars that have no physical relation to one another. Remarkable astronomical phenomena such as supernova remants (Cassiopeia A), sources of extraordinary brightness (Scorpius X-1), and galaxies (Andromeda) are frequently named for the constellation of which they are a part.\n\nconvection: The movement of a gas or liquid in a current caused by the warmer matter rising and cooler matter moving in to replace it.\n\nCopernicus: The Copernicus satellite was launched into a nearly circular 7123 km radius orbit, inclined at 35 degrees, on 21 August 1972. The main experiment was an ultraviolet telescope. However, it also contained a cosmic X-ray experiment provided by University College London/MSSL. The main body of Copernicus measured 3 x 2 meters. The solar panels were fixed at an angle of 34 degrees to the observing axis, and were kept within 30 degrees of the Sun. This restriction resulted in certain parts of the sky being visible only at certain parts of the year. The astronomical instruments were co-aligned, with the UV telescope residing in the central cylinder of the satellite and the X-ray experiment in one of the bays surrounding it. While the UV telescope was observing, the X-ray detectors primarily took background measurements. Occasionally, the X-ray detector observed an X-ray source in the field of view of the UV target. It operated until February 1981.\n\ncore collapse supernova: Also known as a Type II supernova, a core collapse supernova is the death explosion of a massive star, resulting in a sharp increase in brightness followed by a gradual fading.

Astronomy became a hobby and he eventually went back to school for a PhD in Astronomy at the University of Virginia. After receiving his PhD, he was hired at Lick Observatory where he studied spiral nebulae and would eventually publish an article claiming that these nebulae were in fact other spiral galaxies. Another astronomer, Harlow Shapley, disagreed with Curtis's findings arguing that the nebulae were nearby gas clouds. In 1920 Curtis and Shapley debated the issue which has ramifications for the scale of the Universe, an event known as the Great Debate.\n\nCygnus X-1: Cygnus X-1 is a so-called stellar-mass black hole, a class of black holes that results from the collapse of a massive star. In the case of Cygnus X-1, material from a nearby, massive blue companion star is falling into the black hole.

See interstellar dust.\n\ndynamics: The study of the motion of bodies of various types, responding to various forces as they travel through space.\n\nE\n\nefficiency: The ratio of the amount of light reaching a detector in an instrument to the amount of light that would reach a detector if the instrument were perfect. The term is sometimes applied to individual components of instruments as well. Consider a telescope with two mirrors that produces a focused image of a star (the target) or other object in the focal plane of the mirror system. The light continues through an instrument, say, a spectrograph, which has many reflections and a prism, and lands on a detector which produces a signal, say, a count of the number of photons per second from the target. About 4% of the light may be lost at each reflection in the telescope, so that only 96% of the light from the target star is reflected from the first mirror. Likewise, from the second mirror. This simple telescope is said to be 0.96 x 0.96 = 0.92 efficient, or 92% efficient, because only 92% of the light from the star reaches the focal plane. The light next passes into an instrument: with more losses at mirrors in the instrument, and absorption of light in the prism, the light actually reaching the detector may only be 20% of the amount entering the instrument, or 0.2 x 0.92 =0.184 (18.4%) of what originally entered the telescope. There are usually other losses in the detector, say, 30%. The overall system of telescope, instrument and detector is 0.92 x 0.184 x 0.3 = 0.057 (5.7% efficiency).\n\nefficient: The ratio of the number of events (such as a gamma ray, X-ray, or optical photons) that are counted by the electroniocs of a detector as opposed to the number of events that strike it. Perfect efficiency is difficult to achieve for a number of reasons. For example, the detection of an optical photon by a CCD detector requires that it enters the layer of the detector where it will be converted into electrons. Some photons may be reflected from the surface of the detector and thus never enter the area where they may be detected. Or, some photons may pass through a detector; in this case, the detector is \"transparent\" (as in a window) to the photon.\n\nEinstein, Albert (1879-1955): German-American physicist who developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, which along with Quantum Mechanics, are the foundation of modern physics.\n\nEinstein Observatory: The second of NASA's three High Energy Astrophysical Observatories, HEAO-2, renamed Einstein after launch, was the first fully imaging X-ray telescope put into space.

A typical visible light photon has an energy of 2 eV.\n\nenergy: Ability to perform work; to advance against resistance; for instance lift a body against gravity, or drag it against friction.\n\nEnewetak Atoll: Enewetak (sometimes also spelled Eniwetok) is a large coral atoll, a coral reef in a ring-shaped structure, in the Pacific Ocean. During World War II, the United States captured the atoll from the Japanese in he Battle of Eniwetok in 1944. After the war, the United States used the atoll for testing nuclear bombs. There were 43 nuclear tests at Enewetak between 1948 and 1958.\n\nepoch: In astronomy, an epoch is a moment in time used as a reference point for some time-varying astronomical quantity, such as the celestial coordinates or elliptical orbital elements of a celestial body, because these are subject to perturbations and vary with time.\n\nerror box: Every object in the sky has a coordinate position analogous to longitude and latitude on the surface of the Earth. Just as every house on Earth has a longitude and latitude, every star in the sky has a right ascension (east-west) and declination (north-south). You can find the coordinates for your house using a GPS. Depending on how a source is discovered, the coordinates of a star may be more or less accurate, so it is important to state the range in right ascension and the range in declination in which there is a 90% chance of finding the source with another telescope. This range of uncertainty defines a box on the plane of the sky in which the source will certainly be found. It is called the error box. The smaller the error box, the more accurate the measurement of observation.\n\nescape velocity: The speed needed for an object to break away from the gravitational pull of a planet or moon.\n\nether: A hypothetical medium filling all of the otherwise empty space in the Universe which light waves were thought to propagate through.

He was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi is widely regarded as one of the leading scientists of the 20th century, and along with J. Robert Oppenheimer, is frequently referred to as \"the father of the atomic bomb.â The Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a class of particles called fermions, and the synthetic element fermium, are all named in recognition of the physicist.\n\nFermi Gamma-Ray Telescope: Launched June 11, 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly known as GLAST) has an imaging gamma-ray telescope vastly more capable than instruments flown previously, as well as a secondary instrument to augment the study of gamma-ray bursts: the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The telescope was named in honor of Enrico Fermi, like Compton, from the University of Chicago, who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1938 for his work on the artificial radioactivity produced by neutrons, and for nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons. In its first year of observations, Fermi captured more than 1,000 discrete sources of gamma rays, five times the number previously known.\n\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab): A US Department of Energy national laboratory located in Batavia, Illinois.

A factor of 2.5 in brightness is one magnitude. A factor of 100 in intensity is a range of 5 magnitudes. A factor of 10,000 is 10 magnitudes, a factor or 1,000,000 is 15 magnitudes. The intensity of light and therefore the magnitude depends on the intrinsic luminosity of the star as well as its distance. The magnitude scale is reversed from the way we speak of brightness, in the sense that fainter objects have larger numerical magnitudes and brighter objects have lower magnitudes. The brightest stars have magnitude zero. The faintest stars discernible to the human eye are about 6th magnitude. The brightest galaxies are 9th to 12th magnitude. The faintest galaxies recorded are about 30th magnitude. Astronomers define an absolute (in italics) magnitude which is the intrinsic luminosity of an object and does not depend on distance.\n\nfilter: Filters work by blocking a specific part of the color spectrum.\n\nFishman, Gerald (Jerry): An American high-energy astrophysicist who is a research scientist at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Fishman was the Principal Investigator for the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and is currently a co-investigator on the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.\n\nfission ratio: The fission ratio is the relative probability that an encounter with a neutron and a heavy atomic nucleus will be absorption of the neutron by the nucleus or the splitting of the heavy nucleus into two smaller nuclei, called fission. The former occurs when the energy of the neutron is low; the fission ratio is said to be high. The latter occurs when the energy of the neutron is relatively higher; the fission ratio is said to be low. When the ratio is large, the neutron will preferentially be captured and a new element with a heavier nucleus will be formed. If the nucleus is uranium-238 (U-238) and the neutron energy is low, the latter outcome produces plutonium 239 (P-239). When the fission ratio is small, the atom will split, releasing atomic energy.\n\nflorin: An Italian gold coin; approximately 20,000 modern US dollars.\n\nflux: The measure of the flow of some quantity per unit area per unit time.\n\nfocal plane: The plane in a telescope where light rays come into focus.\n\nFranck, James (1882-1964): James Franck was a German physicist.

He would eventually become the director of the Optical Institute at the Benediktbeuern monastery. He made the finest optical glass in the world at the time and invented precise methods for measuring the dispersion of light and the spectroscope, with which he would discover 574 dark lines in the spectrum of the Sun.\n\nfrequency: The number of back-and-forth cycles per second, in a wave or wave-like process. Expressed this way, the frequency is said to be given in units of hertz (hz), named after the scientist who first produced and observed radio waves in the lab. Alternating current in homes in the US goes through 60 cycles each second, hence its frequency is 60 hz; in Europe it is 50 cycles and 50 hz.\n\nFriedman, Herbert (1916-2000): Even though Friedmanâs special skill was the development X-ray sensitive Geiger counters, he also developed Geiger counters with high efficiency for gamma rays.

When the term is capitalized, it refers to properties of our Milky Way Galaxy.\n\ngalaxy: A component of our Universe made up of gas and a large number of stars (between one million and a million million stars) held together by gravity. When capitalized, Galaxy refers to our own Milky Way Galaxy.\n\ngalaxy cluster: Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe. They have three major components: hundreds of galaxies containing stars, gas and dust; vast clouds of hot (30 - 100 million degrees Celsius) gas that is invisible to optical telescopes; and dark matter, an unknown form of matter that is undetectable by its emitted electromagnetic radiation but whose presence can be inferred from its gravitational pull on the galaxies and hot gas. Although the galaxies and hot gas clouds are very massive, scientists have determined that about 10 times more mass is needed to hold the cluster together. It is thought that dark matter provides the additional gravity. Astronomers think that galaxy clusters form as clumps of dark matter and their associated galaxies are pulled together by gravity. These form small groups of galaxies that ultimately merge into large clusters.\n\nGalaxy Evolution Explorer: The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) is an orbiting space telescope observing galaxies in ultraviolet light across 10 billion years of cosmic history.\n\nGalilei, Galileo (1564-1642): Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher.

His interests include gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. He is Principal Investigator for the Swift gamma-ray burst MIDEX mission.\n\nGeiger counter: Geiger counters measure high-energy particles or radiation. They were used to measure latent radioactivity, such as the radioactivty that remains behind after the explosion of an atomic bomb. They were also flown on early rockets to measure celestial X-rays. An electric signal that corresponds to the light collected by the telescope is produced and measured. The Geiger counter usually contains a metal tube with a thin metal wire along its middle, the space in between sealed off and filled with a suitable gas, and with the wire at about +1000 volts relative to the tube. An ion or electron penetrating the tube (or an electron knocked out of the wall by X-rays or gamma rays) tears electrons off atoms in the gas. Because of the high positive voltage of the central wire, these electrons are then attracted to it. In doing so they gain energy, collide with atoms and release more electrons, until the process snowballs into an \"avalanche\" which produces an easily detectable pulse of current. With a suitable filling gas, the flow of electricity stops by itself, or else the electrical circuitry can help stop it. The instrument was called a \"counter\" because every particle passing it produced an identical pulse, allowing particles to be counted but with no information about their energy (except that they must have sufficient energy to penetrate the walls of the counter).\n\nGemini Program: The Gemini program consisted of a total of 19 launches, 2 initial uncrewed test missions, 7 target vehicles, and 10 crewed missions, each of which carried two astronauts to Earth orbit. Designed as a bridge between the Mercury and Apollo programs, the Gemini program primarily tested equipment and mission procedures and trained astronauts and ground crews for future Apollo missions. The general objectives of the program included: long duration flights; testing the ability to maneuver a spacecraft and to achieve rendezvous and docking of two vehicles in Earth orbit; training of both flight and ground crews; conducting experiments in space; extravehicular operations (standup sessions and spacewalks); active control of reentry to achieve a precise landing; and onboard orbital navigation. The Gemini missions lasted for periods ranging from 5 hours to 14 days.\n\nGeneral Theory of Relativity: The geometric theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein, incorporating and extending the Theory of Special Relativity to accelerated frames of reference, and introducing the principle that gravitational and inertial forces are equivalent. The theory has consequences for the bending of light by massive objects, the nature of black holes, and the fabric of space and time.\n\ngeophysics: The physics of the Earth.\n\nGeorgium Sidus: Latin for âGeorgeâs Starâ, it was the name that Sir William Herschel gave to the planet he discovered.

As of 2012, no gravitational waves have been observed.\n\ngravity: A mutual physical force attracting two bodies.\n\ngrazing-incidence: X-ray telescopes use paraboloidal mirrors, with very steep sides. If mirrors were used to try to reflect X-rays in the normal way used in the optical, the X-rays would be absorbed instantly. The X-rays have their paths diverted only slightly, by grazing incidence on the steep side of the mirror and are focused to a point. Such mirrors are often nested one inside the other, to gain collecting area.\n\ngrazing-incidence mirror: The type of mirror used in a grazing-incidence telescope, it allows incoming light to be reflected off the mirror surface at very shallow angles. There are several designs of grazing-incidence mirrors, including flat mirrors or combinations of parabolic and hyperbolic surfaces. To increase the collecting area a number of mirror elements are often nested inside one another.\n\nGreat Observatories Program: A series of four space-borne NASA observatories designed to conduct astronomical studies over four different wavelengths (visible, gamma rays, X-rays, and infrared). An important aspect of the Great Observatories Program was to overlap the operations phases of the missions to enable astronomers to make contemporaneous observations of an object at different spectral wavelengths. The four observatories are Hubble, Compton, Chandra, and Spitzer. Hubble, Compton, and Chandra operated simultaneously for one year; Spitzer was not launched until 2003, three years after Compton ceased to operate in 2000.\n\nguide stars: Stars that are used as reference points so that a telescope can accurately track an object that moves due to the rotation of the Earth.\n\nGunn, James: James Gunn is an Astronomy professor at Princeton University.

The plural of nucleus is nuclei.\n\nNuSTAR Explorer Mission (2012-): An Earth-orbiting satellite with two co-aligned, grazing incidence telescopes, each with a 10-m focal length and specially coated optics. Using newly developed detectors NuSTAR maps the high-energy X-ray sky, including sources such as collapsed stars, black holes, and young supernova remnants.\n\nO\n\nOâDell, C. Robert: C. Robert OâDell is an American astronomer who has worked at the University of Chicago, NASA, Rice University, and Vanderbilt University. He was the Chief Scientist of NASAâs Hubble Space Telescope Project. He studies the observational astrophysics of gaseous nebulae.\n\nOberlin College: Oberlin College is a private liberal arts college located in Oberlin, Ohio. It was founded in 1833.\n\nOberth, Herman (1894-1989): A German physicist and engineer whose early experiments with rockets included a young Wernher von Braun who would go on to become the first director of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\nOcchialini, Giuseppe (1907- 1993): An Italian physicist who was known for his work with elementary particles and contribution to the discovery of the pi-meson decay.\n\noccult: In astronomy, one looks a long a line of sight to what are often very tiny sources as measured in angle. The light may be blocked from reaching Earth by objects lying on the line of sight: such stars are said to be occulted. The light of one star could be blocked by another star of similar or greater size, in a distant binary system, or, may be blocked from entering an instrument at the focus of a telescope by a tiny grain of dust.\n\nOlbers, Heinrich Wilhelm (1758-1840): A German physician and astronomer who discovered several asteroids and a periodic comet.\n\nOlson, Roy: A scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory who discovered the first observed gamma-ray burst among the data from the Vela 4 satellites with his colleagues Ray Klebesadel and Ian Strong.\n\nOort, Jan (1900-1992): Jan Oort was a Dutch astronomer. He made many discoveries and contributions in the field of radio astronomy, including the suggestion that comets come from the same region of the Solar System, which is now known as the Oort Cloud.\n\nOppenheimer, J. Robert (1904-1967): J. Robert Oppenheimer was an Ame"
