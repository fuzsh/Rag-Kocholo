J. Thomson, and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1917. In 1903 he proved that molecular weight determines how a gas scatters radiation, in 1904 he proved that x-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, and in 1906 he used x-ray scattering to ascertain the number of electrons in a carbon atom. His work showed that there are two types of secondary radiations emitted by substances after exposure to x-rays (\"scattered\" and \"characteristic\" radiations), helped define the laws governing x-ray scattering and the excitation of secondary rays, and made possible the subsequent study of atomic structures. He also studied x-ray fluorescence, other short-wave emissions, and the velocity of electric waves. Devoutly religious, he considered his scientific endeavors \"part of the quest for God, the Creator\".\n\nFather: John Martin Barkla (chemicals executive)\n\nMother: Sarah Glover Barkla\n\nWife: Mary Esther Cowell Barkla (m. 1907, two sons, one daughter)\n\nSon: Michael Barkla (Flight Lieutenant, d. 1943 WWII)\n\nHigh School: Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, Liverpool, England (1894)\n\nUniversity: BS Physics, University of Liverpool (1898, first class)\n\nUniversity: MS Physics, University of Liverpool (1899)\n\nScholar: Trinity College, Cambridge University (1899-1900)\n\nLecturer: King's College, Cambridge University (1900-02)\n\nTeacher: University of Liverpool (1902-09)\n\nProfessor: Wheatstone Professor of Physics, University of London (1909-13)\n\nProfessor: Natural Philosophy, University of Edinburgh (1913-44)\n\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n\nRoyal Society 1912\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh 1914\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1917\n\nHughes Medal 1917\n\nEnglish Ancestry\n\nLunar Crater Barkla (10.7° S, 67.2° E, 42 km. diameter)\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nNotes on Practical Physics for Junior Students (1913, textbook; with George A.
