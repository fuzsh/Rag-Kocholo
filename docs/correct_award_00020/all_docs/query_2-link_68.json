        "text": "Congratulations to the Nobel Prize in Physics and Chemistry winners\n\nIOP Publishing (IOPP) would like to congratulate Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L'Huillier for winning the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics! The trio has been awarded the Prize for their work on creating extremely short pulses of light that can be harnessed to study processes occurring inside atoms and molecules.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the three laureates' experiments produced \"pulses of light so short that they are measured in attoseconds\". The winning research can be used to study how electrons, the building blocks of all matter and chemistry, behave.\n\nThe three Nobel Prize in Physics scientists have published many research papers with IOP Publishing\n\nPierre Agostini\n\nFerenc Krausz\n\nAnne L'Huillier\n\nBelow we have listed some of the most prominent papers on attosecond light pulses that the winners have published with us and work related to the subject:\n\nThe physics of attosecond light pulses\n\nMultiple-harmonic conversion of 1064 nm radiation in rare gases\n\nTheoretical aspects of intense field harmonic generation\n\nAttosecond spectroscopy for the investigation of ultrafast dynamics in atomic, molecular and solid-state physics\n\nIOPP would also like to congratulate Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov for winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023. The three laureates have been rewarded for their discovery and development of quantum dots, nanoparticles that are so small their size determines their properties.\n\nThe three Nobel Prize in Chemistry scientists have published the following research papers with IOP Publishing:\n\nOptical and electro-optical properties of II-VI quantum dots\n\nOptical Properties of Semiconductor Quantum Dots in Glass Matrix\n\nEnhancement of Exciton Exchange Interaction by Quantum Confinement in CdSe Nanocrystals\n\nLuminescence of Silicon Nanocrystals and Porous Silicon\n\nControlled placement of colloidal quantum dots in sub-15 nm clusters\n\nIncreasing the penetration depth of temporal focusing multiphoton microscopy for neurobiological applications"
