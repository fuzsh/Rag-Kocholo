        "text": "Production of x-ray at the early stage:\n\nX-ray is an electromagnetic wave. The wave length range is 0.01 to 10nm. German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen is credited for discover of x-rays in 1895. However, x-ray emitting from crookes tubes and experimental discharge tubes was invented around 1875 but it was first systematic studied by the physicist Röntgen. Dr. Röntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 “in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him”. Primarily x-ray was produced in crookes tube. But the tube is unreliable as the small quantity gas is absorbed by wall of the tube itself. X-ray production method was upgraded due to the invention of the thermionic diode by John Ambrose Fleming on 1904. Nobel Prize received by Charles Barkla in 1917 “For his discovery of the characteristic Röntgen radiation of the elements”, another important step in the development of X-ray spectroscopy. Method of the x-ray production crossed another step by invention of Coolidge x-ray tube during 1912 by Willam D. Coolidge for continuous x-ray emission and used for a long time.\n\nHowever, x-ray imagining is the phenomena of x-ray absorption by the material and widely known to us in the field of clinical medicine. Another contribution of x-ray in the development of material science is X-ray Absorption Fine Spectroscopy (XAFS). It is one of the wide spread application of the x-ray in the scientific purpose, awaited a decade after discovery of x-ray diffraction. XAFS is the modern development of X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). XAFS require a powerful stable x-ray source and the demand meets by the electron synchrotron with stable and brilliant storage rings (There is only one synchrotron in India at RRCAT, Indore). It also further improved the field of x-ray diffraction of the material due to high penetration depth and directionality. Synchrotron x-rays were first observed in 1947. It is note-worthy to mention that, the structure of DNA was discovered by J. Watson and F. Crick using the x-ray in 1953.\n\nStructural Biology – Virus: Potential Contribution of Synchrotron to overcome Pandemic:\n\nSingle biological molecules diffract X-rays, but only very weakly. Crystallization, as Bernal and Hodgkin employed for pepsin, is helpful because it results in the repetition of huge numbers of molecules in an ordered, 3D lattice, so that all their tiny signals reinforce one another and become detectable – by photographic plates in the early days and by active pixel detectors today. These signals are not images of the molecules, for there are no materials that can substantially refract, and thereby focus, scattered X-rays. Rather, the signals are merely the sum of the contributions of X-rays diffracted from different parts of the molecule. To pick apart these contributions, structural biologists rely on a mathematical tool – the Fourier transform. The calculated contributions are then equated with possible atomic structures by a lot of careful (and now largely computer-driven) interpretation. For structural biologists, x-ray crystallography is by far the most commonly used tool for unravelling protein structures. It also produces the highest resolution images of structures. The process typically is performed at cryogenic temperatures to limit ionizing- radiation damage to proteins. Small-angle X-Ray scattering has dedicated beamlines at each of the synchrotron light sources. The technique lacks the angular resolution of crystallography, but it can be used to examine macromolecules in solution, nearer a protein’s native state at room temperature. The scattering can explore how structures change over time as the virus matures. That evolutionary process could occur over hours or days, says Britt Hedman, SSRL science director.\n\nRole of high energetic x-ray beam\n\nHere the interactive signal is X-rays. Nowadays, synchrotron radiation sources are ideal for macromolecular crystallography because they produce high-intensity X-rays with a very narrow spread of wavelengths. This tremendous job is done by the synchrotron source within just a second where as traditional x-ray diffractor machine take time around a month. The four-year delay in obtaining the structure of HIV protease was primarily due not to the brilliance or quality of X-rays, but to the lack of sizeable crystals of the enzyme. Current synchrotrons and ever newer free-electron lasers – which extract diffraction data from molecular crystals in the few femtoseconds before they are annihilated – employ techniques such as serial crystallography to build up a complete diffraction dataset from numerous partial datasets of crystals that would otherwise be too small. More¬over, both the crystallization and data collection are now automated, so that structural biologists need not even visit a light source themselves: they simply post their proteins to a facility and download the dataset when it is ready.\n\nAs of early April, the life sciences beam lines were open for SARS-CoV-2 research at the UK’s Diamond Light Source. In the US, at least 23 groups were working at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory as of press time, according to Bob Fischetti, life sciences adviser at the APS. The National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory, SLAC’s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), and the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are operating with minimal staff, each keeping open several x-ray protein crystallography beamlines strictly for corona virus research. The BESSY II light source in Berlin closed briefly but resumed operations on 2 April for coronavirus research, which is also ongoing at the Shanghai synchrotron in China, where the first 3D structure of the main protease protein was resolved. Officials there did not respond to requests for comment. The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France has been closed for an upgrade, but it announced in early April that it would consider reopening beamlines on a case-by case basis for coronavirus research."
