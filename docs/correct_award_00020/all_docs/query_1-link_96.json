Born in Germany into a distinguished academic family of Jewish descent, he was forced to leave his homeland when he was suspended without pay from his post at Göttingen University by the Nazis. After short spells in Oxford and Bangalore he came to Edinburgh. In 1954, the year in which he retired to his native Germany, he won the Nobel Prize for Physics.\n\nNo public access.\n\nFind out more\n\nNobel Prize: Max Born\n\nUniversity of St Andrews: Max Born\n\nFor International Women’s Day on March 8, we are launching a new tour featuring locations in Edinburgh connected to amazing women in STEM.
