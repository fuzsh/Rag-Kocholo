IN THE WINTER of the year of his ﬁftieth birthday, and the year following his appointment to the leadership of the University of Würzburg, Rector Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen noticed a barium platinocyanide screen ﬂuorescing in his laboratory as he generated cathode rays in a Crookes tube some distance away. Leaving aside for a time his duties to the university and to his students, Rector Roentgen spent the next six weeks in his labora- tory, working alone, and sharing nothing with his colleagues. 10 SUMMER 1995 zycnzj.com/http://www.zycnzj.com/\n\n2. zycnzj.com/ www.zycnzj.com Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen (1845–1923).

When Heinrich Hertz found that he could pass the rays through metal foil, a fellow German scientist, Philip German Museum, Munich Lenard, began to study them more carefully.

Roentgen turned to a new interest in October of 1895: the study of cath- ode rays. In the course of repeating the experiments of Hertz and Lenard, he happened to notice a glowing ﬂu- orescent screen set off quite some distance from the Crookes’ tube he was operating.

(Courtesy of the AIP Niels Bohr Library Few physicists had taken Einstein seriously when he predicted the light quantum in 1905. Bohr had pooh-poohed the idea. But by 1921 evidence was mounting and so was Einstein’s fame. The de Broglie brothers, Maurice and Louis, were two others who had learned from the studies of X rays of the dual nature of radiation, and Louis was inspired to suggest that matter too might have vinced most physicists that they this dual nature.
