        "text": "nucleus The core of the atom is the nucleus, a dense body only one ten-thousandth the diameter of the atom itself. The simplest nucleus, that of hydrogen, comprises a single stable positively charged particle, the proton. Nuclei of other elements contain more protons, and additional particles called neutrons, of about the same mass as the proton but with no electrical charge. Each element has its own characteristic nucleus with a unique number of protons�the atomic number. The number of neutrons may vary. Atoms of a single element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Although some isotopes tend to be unstable and exhibit radioactivity, they all have identical chemical properties. electron The nucleus is surrounded by a number of moving electrons, each of which has a negative charge equal to the positive charge on a proton, but which weighs only times as much. In a neutral atom, the nucleus is surrounded by the same number of electrons as it contains protons. According to quantum theory, the position of an electron is uncertain; it may be found at any point. It is more likely, however, to be found in some places than others. The region of space in which an electron is most likely to be found is called an orbital. The chemical properties of an element are determined by the ease with which its atoms can gain or lose electrons from its outer orbitals. proton A proton is a positively charged subatomic particle, a constituent of the nucleus of all atoms. It belongs to the baryon subclass of the hadrons. A proton is extremely long-lived, with a life span of at least 1032 years. It carries a unit positive charge equal to the negative charge of an electron. Its mass is almost 1,836 times that of an electron, or 1.67 x 10�27 kg. Protons are composed of two up quarks and one down quark held together by gluons (see section of quarks below). The number of protons in the atom of an element is equal to the atomic number of that element. An isotope is one of two or more atoms that have the same atomic number (same number of protons), but which contain a different number of neutrons, thus differing in their atomic mass. They may be stable or radioactive (see radioisotope below), naturally occurring or synthesized. Hydrogen, for example, has the isotopes 2H (deuterium) and 3H (tritium). Elements at the lower end of the periodic table have atoms with roughly the same number of protons as neutrons. These elements are called stable isotopes. The stable isotopes of oxygen include 16O, 17O, and 18O. A radioisotope or radioactive isotope is a naturally occurring or synthetic radioactive form of an element. Elements with high atomic mass numbers have many more neutrons than protons and are therefore less stable. It is these isotopes that are more prone to radioactive decay. One example is 238U, uranium-238. Most natural isotopes of atomic weight below 208 are not radioactive. Those from 210 and up are all radioactive. Most radioisotopes are made by bombarding a stable element with neutrons in the core of a nuclear reactor (see fission below). The radiations given off by radioisotopes are easy to detect (hence their use as tracers), and in some instances can penetrate substantial thicknesses of materials, and can have profound effects (such as genetic mutation) on living matter. Early accelerators directed the particle beam onto a stationary target; large modern accelerators usually collide beams of particles that are traveling in opposite directions. This arrangement doubles the effective energy of the collision. The world's most powerful accelerator is the 2-km/1.25-mi diameter machine at Fermilab near Batavia, Illinois, United States. This machine, the Tevatron, accelerates protons and antiprotons and then collides them at energies up to a thousand billion electron volts (or 1 TeV, hence the name of the machine). The largest accelerator is the Large Electron Positron Collider at CERN near Geneva, which has a circumference of 27 km/16.8 mi around which electrons and positrons are accelerated before being allowed to collide. cyclotron In a cyclotron an electric field is used to bend the path of a particle into a circle so that it passes repeatedly through the same electric field. A cyclotron consists of an electromagnet with two hollow, metal semicircular structures, called dees, supported between the poles of an electromagnet. Particles such as protons are introduced at the center of the machine and travel outward in a spiral path, being accelerated by an oscillating electric field each time they pass through the gap between the dees. Cyclotrons can accelerate particles up to energies of 25 MeV (25 million electron volts). To produce higher energies, new techniques are needed. fission Fission is the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more major fragments. It is accompanied by the emission of two or three neutrons and the release of large amounts of nuclear energy. Fission occurs spontaneously in nuclei of uranium-235, the main fuel used in nuclear reactors. However, the process can also be induced by bombarding nuclei with neutrons because a nucleus that has absorbed a neutron becomes unstable and soon splits. The neutrons released spontaneously by the fission of uranium nuclei may therefore be used in turn to induce further fissions, setting up a chain reaction that must be controlled if it is not to result in a nuclear explosion. The minimum amount of fissile material that can undergo a continuous chain reaction is referred to as the critical mass. In nuclear fusion, the nuclei of light elements, such as hydrogen, combine to form the bigger nucleus of a heavier element, such as helium. The resultant loss in their combined mass is converted into energy. Stars and thermonuclear weapons are powered by nuclear fusion. Very high temperatures and pressures are thought to be required in order for fusion to take place. Under these conditions the atomic nuclei can approach each other at high speeds and overcome the mutual repulsion of their positive charges. At very close range another force, the strong nuclear force, comes into play, fusing the particles together to form a larger nucleus. As fusion is accompanied by the release of large amounts of energy, the process might one day be harnessed to form the basis of commercial energy production. So far no successful fusion reactor�one able to produce the required conditions and contain the reaction�has been built. An important step was taken in 1991, however, when, in an experiment that lasted 2 seconds, a 1.7 megawatt pulse of power was produced by the Joint European Torus (JET) at Culham, Oxfordshire, UK. This was the first time that a substantial amount of fusion power had been produced in a controlled experiment, as opposed to a bomb. In 1997 JET produced a record 21 megajoule of fusion power, and tested the first large-scale plant of the type needed to supply and process tritium in a future fusion power station. There are six types or \"flavors\" of quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom), each of which has three varieties or \"colors\": red, green, and blue (visual color is not meant, although the analogy is useful in many ways). To each quark there is an antiparticle, called an antiquark. Quarks combine in groups of three to produce heavy particles called baryons, and in groups of two to produce particles with masses between those of electrons and protons, called mesons. Baryons and mesons together are known as hadrons, and they and their composite particles are influenced by the strong nuclear force. Quarks have electric charges that are fractions of the electronic charge (+ or � of the electronic charge). meson A meson is a group of unstable subatomic particles made up of two indivisible elementary particles. It has a mass intermediate between that of the electron and that of the proton, is found in cosmic radiation, and is emitted by nuclei under bombardment by very high-energy particles. There are believed to be 15 ordinary types. The last of these to be found was identified by physicists at Fermilab, United States in 1998. Mesons have whole-number or zero spins. muon The muon is an elementary particle (found by the US physicist Carl Anderson in cosmic radiation in 1937) similar to the electron except for its mass which is 207 times greater than that of the electron. It has a half-life of 2 millionths of a second, decaying into electrons and neutrinos. The muon produces the muon neutrino when it decays. The muon was originally thought to be a meson and is thus sometimes called a mu meson, although current opinion is that it is a lepton. neutrino Neutrinos are any of three uncharged elementary particles (and their antiparticles) of the lepton class, having a mass too close to zero to be measured. The most familiar type, the antiparticle of the electron neutrino, is emitted in the beta decay of a nucleus. The other two are the muon and tau neutrinos. The existence of the tau neutrino has never been conclusively confirmed but it is believed to cause a less stable particle, tau, to be emitted from the nucleus of an atom when the atom is struck by a tau neutrino. The tau decays almost instantaneously. Researchers at Fermilab believe they found traces of the tau released during an experiment in 1997. photon The photon is the elementary particle or \"package\" (quantum) of energy in which light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation are emitted. The photon has both particle and wave properties; it has no charge, is considered massless but possesses momentum and energy. It is the carrier of the electromagnetic force. According to quantum theory the energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the radiation emitted. radioactive decay Radioactive decay occurs when the unstable nuclei of radioactive elements, such as radium and various isotopes of uranium and the transuranic elements, disintegrate to become more stable. This changes the element's atomic number, thus transmuting one element into another. The energy given out by disintegrating atoms is called atomic radiation and consists either of alpha, beta, or gamma rays. Alpha and beta decay are the most common forms. Certain lighter, artificially created, isotopes also undergo radioactive decay. Radioactive decay takes place at a constant rate expressed as a specific half-life, which is the time taken for half of any mass of that particular isotope to decay completely. of a radioactive isotope is measured, rather than the total decay time. It may vary from millionths of a second to billions of years. Radioactive substances decay exponentially; thus the time taken for the first 50% of the isotope to decay will be the same as the time taken by the next 25%, and by the 12.5% after that, and so on. For example, carbon-14 takes about 5,730 years for half the material to decay; another 5,730 for half of the remaining half to decay; then 5,730 years for half of that remaining half to decay, and so on. Plutonium-239, one of the most toxic of all radioactive substances, has a half-life of about 24,000 years. The final product in all modes of decay is a stable element. beta decay Beta decay is the disintegration of the nucleus of an atom to produce a beta particle, or high-speed electron, and an electron-antineutrino. During beta decay a neutron in the nucleus changes into a proton, thereby increasing the atomic number by one while the mass number stays the same. For example, the decay of the carbon 314 isotope results in the formation of an atom of nitrogen (mass 14, atomic number 7) and the emission of an electron. The mass lost in the change is converted into kinetic (movement) energy of the beta particle. Beta decay is caused by the weak nuclear force, one of the fundamental forces of nature operating inside the nucleus. alpha particle Alpha particles are positively charged, high-energy particles emitted from the nucleus of a radioactive atom. They consist of two neutrons and two protons and are thus identical to the nucleus of a helium atom and are one of the products of the spontaneous disintegration of radioactive elements such as radium and thorium. The process of emission, alpha decay, transforms one element into another, decreasing the atomic (or proton) number by two and the atomic mass (or nucleon number) by four. Because of their large mass, alpha particles have a short range of only a few centimeters in air, and can be stopped by a sheet of paper. They have a strongly ionizing effect on the molecules that they strike, and are therefore capable of damaging living cells. Alpha particles traveling in a vacuum are deflected slightly by magnetic and electric fields. beta particle The beta particle is an electron emitted at high velocity from a radioactive atom that is undergoing spontaneous disintegration. Beta particles do not exist in the nucleus but are created on disintegration�beta decay�when a neutron converts to a proton to emit an electron. Beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles, but less so than gamma radiation; they can travel several meters in air, but are stopped by 2�3 mm of aluminum. They are less strongly ionizing than alpha particles and, like cathode rays, are easily deflected by magnetic and electric fields. gamma radiation Gamma rays comprise very high-frequency electromagnetic radiation, similar in nature to X-rays but of shorter wavelength (wavelengths of less than 10�10) emitted by the nuclei of radioactive substances during decay or by the interactions of high-energy electrons with matter. Gamma rays are stopped only by direct collision with an atom and are therefore very penetrating; they can, however, be stopped by about 4 cm/1.5 in of lead or by a very thick concrete shield. Gamma emission usually occurs as part of alpha or beta emission. They are less ionizing in their effect than alpha and beta particles, but are dangerous nevertheless because they can penetrate deeply into body tissues such as bone marrow. They are not deflected by either magnetic or electric fields. Gamma radiation is used to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, sterilize medical devices, and change the molecular structure of plastics to modify their properties (for example, to improve their resistance to heat and abrasion). Cosmic gamma rays have been identified as coming from pulsars, radio galaxies, and quasars, although they cannot penetrate the earth's atmosphere. electric charge Electric charge is the property of some bodies that causes them to exert forces on each other and is caused by an excess or deficit of electrons in the charged substance and is therefore either positive or negative. Objects with a like charge always repel one another while objects with an unlike charge attract each other. In atoms, electrons possess a negative charge, and protons an equal positive charge. Atoms have no charge but can sometimes gain electrons to become negative ions or lose them to become positive ions. A coulomb (C), named for the French scientist Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736�1806), is the unit of charge, and is defined as the charge passing a point in a wire each second when the current is exactly 1 amp. static electricity Static electricity is an electric charge that is stationary, usually acquired by a body by means of electrostatic induction or friction. Rubbing different materials can produce static electricity or cause them to be electrically charged so that it they have an excess or deficit of electrons, as seen in the sparks produced on combing one's hair or removing a nylon shirt. This charge on the object exerts an electric field in the space around itself that can attract or repel other objects. In some processes static electricity is useful, as in paint spraying where the parts to be sprayed are charged with electricity of opposite polarity to that on the paint droplets, and in xerography. potential divider A potential divider is a resistor or a\n\nchain of resistors connected in series in an electrical\n\ncircuit. It is used to obtain a known fraction of the total\n\nvoltage across the whole resistor or chain. When a\n\nvariable resistor, or potentiometer, is used as a potential\n\ndivider, the output voltage can be varied continuously\n\nby sliding a contact along the resistor. Devices like\n\nthis are used in electronic equipment to to vary volume,\n\ntone, and brightness control. electric current An electric current is the movement of electrically charged particles through a conducting material. For charge to flow in a circuit there must be a potential difference (pd) applied across the circuit. Conventionally, current is regarded as a movement of positive electricity from points at high potential to points at a lower potential. Potential difference is often supplied in the form of a battery that has a positive terminal and a negative terminal. Under the influence of the potential difference, the electrons are repelled from the negative terminal side of the circuit and attracted to the positive terminal of the battery. A steady flow of electrons around the circuit is produced. Current flowing through a circuit can be measured using an ammeter and is measured in amperes (or amps). Direct current (D.C.) flows continuously in one direction; alternating current (A.C.) flows alternately in each direction. The flow of current is measured in amperes (symbol A). of energy to each coulomb of charge flowing through it. The energy carried by flowing charges can be used to do work, for example to light a bulb, to cause current to flow through a resistor, to emit radiation, or to produce heat. When the energy carried by a current is made to do work in this way, a potential difference can be measured across the circuit component concerned by a voltmeter or a cathode-ray oscilloscope. The potential difference is also measured in volts. Power, measured in watts, is the product of current and voltage. Although potential difference and current measure different things, they are related to one another. This relationship was discovered by the German physicist Georg Ohm, and is expressed by Ohm's law: the current through a wire is proportional to the potential difference across its ends. The potential difference divided by the current is a constant for a given piece of wire. This constant for a given material is called the resistance. When current flows in a component possessing resistance, electrical energy is converted into heat energy. Conduction in many liquids involves a flow not merely of electrons, but of atoms or groups of atoms as well. When a salt such as sodium chloride is dissolved in water, the chlorine atoms each gain an electron and become negatively charged, while the sodium atoms each lose one and become positively charged. These charged atoms, or ions, can move through the liquid and transport electricity. Current flows by the movement of charged ions through a solution or molten salt (the electrolyte), resulting in the migration of ions to the electrodes: positive ions (cations) to the negative electrode (cathode) and negative ions (anions) to the positive electrode (anode). This process is called electrolysis and represents bi-directional flow of charge as opposite charges move to oppositely charged electrodes. In metals, charges are only carried by free electrons and therefore move in only one direction. Gases are, under normal circumstances, almost completely nonconducting. They may be ionized by irradiation with X-rays or by radioactive radiations. They are more readily maintained in a conducting state at high temperatures, as in the electric arc, or at low pressures, as in electric discharge lamps. A conductor carrying current in a magnetic field experiences a force, and is impelled to move in a direction perpendicular to both the direction of the current and the direction of the magnetic field. The direction of motion may be predicted by Fleming's left-hand rule. The magnitude of the force experienced depends on the length of the conductor and on the strengths of the current and the magnetic field, and is greatest when the conductor is at right angles to the field. A conductor wound into a coil that can rotate between the poles of a magnet forms the basis of an electric motor. Conductivity of a semiconductor can be enhanced by doping the material with small numbers of impurity atoms which either release free electrons (making an n-type semiconductor with more electrons than holes) or capture them (a p-type semiconductor with more holes than electrons). When p-type and n-type materials are brought together to form a p�n junction, an electrical barrier is formed which conducts current more readily in one direction than the other. This is the basis of the semiconductor diode, used for rectification, and numerous other devices including transistors, rectifiers, and integrated circuits (silicon chips). The conductivity of semiconductors can also be improved by the addition of heat or light. Increase of temperature frees more electrons, so the conductivity of nonmetals increases with rising temperature. electromagnetism Magnetic fields are produced either by current-carrying conductors or by permanent magnets. In current-carrying wires, the magnetic field lines are concentric circles around the wire. Their direction depends on the direction of the current and their strength on the size of the current. If a conducting wire is moved within a magnetic field, the magnetic field acts on the free electrons within the conductor, displacing them and causing a current to flow. The force acting on the electrons and causing them to move is magnetism and magnetic fields Magnetism refers to phenomena associated with magnetic fields. A magnetic field is the region around a permanent magnet, or around a conductor carrying an electric current, in which a force acts on a moving charge or on a magnet placed in the field. Magnetic fields are produced by moving charged particles: in electromagnets, electrons flow through a coil of wire connected to a battery; in permanent magnets, spinning electrons within the atoms generate the field. The field can be represented by lines of force, which by convention link north and south poles and are parallel to the directions of a small compass needle placed on them. A magnetic field's magnitude and direction are given by the magnetic flux density, expressed in teslas. All substances are magnetic to a greater or lesser degree, and their magnetic properties, however feeble, may be observed when they are placed in an intense magnetic field. Materials that can be strongly magnetized, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel, are said to be ferromagnetic; this is due to the formation of areas called domains in which atoms, weakly magnetic because of their spinning electrons, align to form areas of strong magnetism. Magnetic materials lose their magnetism if heated to the Curie temperature. Furthermore, if the magnetizing force is increased, a stage is reached when the magnet becomes saturated, that is, its pole strength reaches a maximum value. Most substances are paramagnetic, being only weakly pulled toward a strong magnet. This is because their atoms have a low level of magnetism and do not form domains. Diamagnetic materials, notably bismuth, are weakly repelled by a magnet since electrons within their atoms act as electromagnets and oppose the applied magnetic force. Antiferromagnetic materials have a very low susceptibility that increases with temperature. The German physicist Wilhelm Weber suggested that every magnet was really composed of magnetic particles or magnetized domains that are now believed to be of molecular dimensions. The Scottish physicist J. Alfred Ewing (1855�1935) developed his theory and suggested that, since the act of magnetization did not change the chemical character nor the weight of the specimen, but simply endowed it with magnetic properties, magnetizable substances consisted of molecular magnets. According to this theory, an ordinary piece of iron is made up of molecular magnets arranged in haphazard fashion, so that they neutralize each other's effects on external bodies. This disorder disappears when the iron is placed in a magnetic field and the molecular magnets are set with their axes parallel to the field: free poles appear at the ends of the magnet, while the central portions exhibit only feeble magnetic powers because equal and opposite poles neutralize each other's effects. This theory accounts for the appearance of new poles wherever the magnet is broken, and the state of saturation is reached when all the molecular magnets have been arranged in order. Subsequent loss of magnetism is explained by the partial return to disordered array. magneton theory Early in the 20th century, Pierre Weiss suggested the existence of the magneton or elementary magnet, an analog of the electron, the elementary charge of electricity. An electric current flowing around a circular coil has a magnetic field similar to that of a magnet whose axis coincides with that of the coil: the electrical theory of matter attempts to ascribe the magnetic properties of bodies to the orbital motions of the electrons in the atom. The quantum theory of the atom developed by Niels Bohr supported the magneton theory, and subsequently direct experimental evidence of the existence of the magnetic moment associated with electron orbits was obtained by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach in 1921. Matter is anything that has mass. All matter is made up of atoms, which in turn are made up of elementary particles; it ordinarily exists in one of three physical states: solid, liquid, or gas. The state it exists in depends on its temperature and the pressure on it. Kinetic theory describes how the state of a material depends on the movement and arrangement of its atoms or molecules. In a solid, the atoms or molecules vibrate in a fixed position. In a liquid, they do not occupy fixed positions as in a solid, and yet neither do they have the freedom of random movement that occurs within a gas, so the atoms or molecules within a liquid will always follow the shape of their container. The transition between states takes place at definite temperatures, called melting point and boiling point. In chemical reactions matter is conserved, so no matter is lost or gained and the sum of the mass of the reactants will always equal the sum of the end products. Mass is the quantity of matter in a body as measured by its inertia (tendency to remain in a state of rest or uniform motion until an external force is applied). Mass determines the acceleration produced in a body by a given force acting on it, the acceleration being inversely proportional to the mass of the body. The mass also determines the force exerted on a body by gravity on earth, although this attraction varies slightly from place to place. In the SI system, the base unit of mass is the kilogram. At a given place, equal masses experience equal gravitational forces, which are known as the weights of the bodies. Masses may, therefore, be compared by comparing the weights of bodies at the same place. Gas is a form of matter, such as air, in which the molecules move randomly in otherwise empty space, filling any size or shape of container into which the gas is put. A sugar-lump sized cube of air at room temperature contains 30 trillion molecules moving at an average speed of 500 meters per second (1,800 kph/1,200 mph). Plasma is an ionized gas produced at extremely high temperatures, as in the sun and other stars, which contains positive and negative charges in equal numbers. It is a good electrical conductor. In thermonuclear reactions the plasma produced is confined through the use of magnetic fields. Mechanics is the branch of physics dealing with the motions of bodies and the forces causing these motions, and also with the forces acting on bodies in equilibrium. It is usually divided into dynamics, or kinetics, and statics. Dynamics is the mathematical and physical study of the behavior of bodies under the action of forces that produce changes of motion in them. Statics is concerned with the behavior of bodies at rest and forces or moving with constant velocity where the forces acting on the body cancel each other out; that is, the forces are in equilibrium. As well as dealing with the direct action of forces on bodies, mechanics studies the nature and action of forces when they act on bodies by the agency of machinery. This gives the origin of the word \"mechanics\": in its early stages it was the science of making machines. A machine in mechanics means any contrivance in which a force applied at one point is made to raise weight or overcome a resisting force acting at another point. All machines can be resolved into three primary machines: the lever, the inclined plane, and the wheel and axle. Isaac Newton's three laws of motion form the basis of Newtonian mechanics. (1) Unless acted upon by an external force, a body at rest stays at rest, and a moving body continues moving at the same speed in the same straight line. (2) An external force applied to a body gives it an acceleration proportional to the force (and in the direction of the force) and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. (3) When a body A exerts a force on a body B, B exerts an equal and opposite force on A; that is, to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Force is any influence that tends to change the state of rest or the uniform motion in a straight line of a body. The action of an unbalanced or resultant force results in the acceleration of a body in the direction of action of the force, or it may, if the body is unable to move freely, result in its deformation (see Hooke's law). Force is a vector quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction; its SI unit is the newton. resolution of forces In mechanics, the resolution of\n\nforces is the division of a single force into two parts\n\nthat act at right angles to each other. In the diagram,\n\nthe weight W of an object on a slope, tilted at an angle\n\nq, can be resolved into two parts or components: one\n\nacting at a right angle to the slope, equal to Wcosq, and\n\none acting parallel to and down the slope, equal to Wsinq. In order to understand movement and what causes it, we need to be able to describe it. Speed is a measure of how fast something is moving. Speed is measured by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken to travel that distance. Hence speed is distance moved in unit time. Speed is a scalar quantity in which the direction of travel is not important, only the rate of travel. Velocity is the speed of an object in a given direction. Velocity is therefore a vector quantity, in which both magnitude and direction of movement must be taken into account. The velocity at any instant of a particle traveling in a curved path is in the direction of the tangent to the path at the instant considered. The velocity v of an object traveling in a fixed direction may be calculated by dividing the distance s it has travelled by the time t taken to do so, and may be expressed as: v = s/t. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of a moving body with time. This is also a vector quantity. Acceleration is usually measured in meters per second per second (m s�2) or feet per second per second (ft s�2). Because velocity is a vector quantity (possessing both magnitude and direction), a body traveling at constant speed may be said to be accelerating if its direction of motion changes. According to Isaac Newton's law of gravitation, all objects fall to earth with the same acceleration, regardless of mass. According to Newton's second law of motion, a body will accelerate only if it is acted upon by an unbalanced, or resultant, force. Acceleration due to gravity is the acceleration of a body falling freely under the influence of the earth's gravitational field; it varies slightly at different latitudes and altitudes. The value adopted internationally for gravitational acceleration is 9.806 m s�2/32.174 ft s�2. The average acceleration a of an object traveling in a straight line over a period of time t may be calculated using the formula: momentum Momentum is a function both of the mass of a body and of its velocity and is the product of the mass of a body and its velocity. If the mass of a body is m kilograms and its velocity is v m s�1 then its momentum is given by: momentum = mv. Its unit is the kilogram meter-per-second (kg ms s�1) or the newton second. The momentum of a body does not change unless a resultant or unbalanced force acts on that body. The law of conservation of momentum is one of the fundamental concepts of classical physics. It states that the total momentum of all bodies in a closed system is constant and unaffected by processes occurring within the system. forces and motion Galileo discovered that a body moving on a perfectly smooth horizontal surface would neither speed up nor slow down. All moving bodies continue moving with the same velocity unless a force is applied to cause an acceleration. The reason we appear to have to push something to keep it moving with constant velocity is because of frictional forces acting on all moving objects on earth. Friction occurs when two solid surfaces rub on each other; for example, a car tire in contact with the ground. Friction opposes the relative motion of the two objects in contact and acts to slow the velocity of the moving object. A force is required to push the moving object and to cancel out the frictional force. If the forces combine to give a net force of zero, the object will not accelerate but will continue moving at constant velocity. A resultant force is a single force acting on a particle or body whose effect is equivalent to the combined effects of two or more separate forces. Quantum mechanics, or quantum theory, superseded Newtonian mechanics in the interpretation of physical phenomena on the atomic scale and is the theory that energy (the capacity for doing work) does not have a continuous range of values, but is, instead, absorbed or radiated discontinuously, in multiples of definite, indivisible units called quanta. Just as earlier theory showed how light, generally seen as a wave motion, could also in some ways be seen as composed of discrete particles (photons), quantum theory shows how atomic particles such as electrons may also be seen as having wavelike properties. Quantum theory is the basis of particle physics, modern theoretical chemistry, and the solid-state physics that describes the behavior of the silicon chips used in computers. Thermodynamics deals with the transformation of heat into and from other forms of energy. It is the basis of the study of the efficient working of engines, such as the steam and internal combustion engines. The three laws of thermodynamics are: (1) energy can be neither created nor destroyed, heat and mechanical work being mutually convertible; (2) it is impossible for an unaided self-acting machine to convey heat from one body to another at a higher temperature; and (3) it is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce any system to the absolute zero of temperature (0K/�273�C/�459�F) in a finite number of operations. Put into mathematical form, these laws have widespread applications in physics and chemistry. Conduction is flow of heat energy through a material without the movement of any part of the material itself (compare electrical conduction, described above)�for example, when the whole length of a metal rod is heated when one end is held in a fire. Heat energy is present in all materials in the form of the kinetic energy of their vibrating molecules, and may be conducted from one molecule to the next in the form of this mechanical vibration. In the case of metals, which are particularly good conductors of heat, the free electrons within the material carry heat around very quickly. Energy is the capacity for doing work. Energy can exist in many different forms. For example, potential energy (PE) is energy deriving from position; thus a stretched spring has elastic PE, and an object raised to a height above the earth's surface, or the water in an elevated reservoir, has gravitational PE. Moving bodies possess kinetic energy (KE). All atoms and molecules possess some amount of kinetic energy because they are all in some state of motion (see kinetic theory). Adding heat energy to a substance increases the mean kinetic energy and hence the mean speed of its constituent molecules�a change that is reflected as a rise in the temperature of that substance. Energy can be converted from one form to another, but the total quantity in a system stays the same (in accordance with the conservation of energy principle). Energy cannot be created or destroyed. For example, as an apple falls it loses gravitational PE but gains KE. Although energy is never lost, after a number of conversions it tends to finish up as the kinetic energy of random motion of molecules (of the air, for example) at relatively low temperatures. This is \"degraded\" energy that is difficult to convert back to other forms. All forms of energy tend to be transformed into heat and can not then readily be converted into other, useful forms of energy. A body with no energy can do no work. For example, a flat battery in a flashlight will not light the flashlight. If the battery is fully charged, it should contain enough chemical energy to do the work involved in illuminating the flashlight bulb. When one body A does work on another body B, A transfers energy to B. The energy transferred is equal to the work done by A on B. Energy is therefore measured in joules. The rate of doing work or consuming energy is called power and is measured in watts (joules per second). It is now recognized that mass can be converted into energy under certain conditions, according to Einstein's theory of relativity. This conversion of mass into energy is the basis of atomic power. Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905; see below) correlates any gain, E, in energy with a gain, m, in mass, by the equation E = mc2, in which c is the speed of light. The conversion of mass into energy in accordance with this equation applies universally, although it is only for nuclear reactions that the percentage change in mass is large enough to detect. amplitude The amplitude is the maximum displacement of an oscillation from the equilibrium position (the height of a crest or the depth of a trough). With a sound wave, for example, amplitude corresponds to the intensity (loudness) of the sound. If a mechanical system is made to vibrate by applying oscillations to it, the system vibrates. As the frequency of the oscillations is varied, the amplitude of the vibrations reaches a maximum at the natural frequency of the system. If a force with a frequency equal to the natural frequency is applied, the vibrations can become violent, a phenomenon known as resonance. wavelength Wavelength is the distance between successive crests of a wave. This is measured as the distance between successive crests (or successive troughs) of the wave. It is given the Greek symbol l. The frequency of a wave is the number of vibrations per second. The reciprocal of this is the wave period. This is the time taken for one complete cycle of the wave oscillation. The speed of the wave is measured by multiplying wave frequency by the wavelength. The wavelength of a light wave determines its color; red light has a wavelength of about 700 nanometers, for example. The complete range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum. refraction When a wave moves from one medium to another (for example a light wave moving from air to glass) it moves with a different speed in the second medium. This change in speed causes it to change direction. This property is called refraction. The amount of refraction depends on the densities of the media, the angle at which the wave strikes the surface of the second medium, and the amount of bending and change of velocity corresponding to the wave's frequency (dispersion). Refraction differs from reflection (see below), which involves no change in velocity. The refractive index of a material indicates by how much a wave is bent. It is found by dividing the velocity of When light passes from a denser medium to a less dense medium, such as from water to air, both refraction (see above) and reflection can occur. If the angle of incidence is small, the reflection will be relatively weak compared to the refraction. But as the angle of incidence increases the relative degree of reflection will increase. At some critical angle of incidence the angle of refraction is 90�. Since refraction cannot occur above 90�, the light is totally reflected at angles above this critical angle of incidence. This condition is known as total internal reflection. Total internal reflection is used in fiber optics to transmit data over long distances, without the need of amplification diffraction Diffraction is the spreading out of waves when they pass through a small gap or around a small object, resulting in some change in their direction. The degree of diffraction depends on the relationship between the wavelength and the size of the object or gap through which the wave travels. In order for this effect to be observed the size of the object or gap must be comparable to, or smaller than, the wavelength of the waves. Diffraction occurs with all forms of progressive waves�electromagnetic, sound, and water waves�and explains such phenomena as why long-wave radio waves can bend round hills better than short-wave radio waves. Large objects cast shadows because the difference between their size and the wave- The wavelength of light ranges from 4 x 10�7 to 7 x 10�7, a few orders of magnitude smaller than radio waves. The slight spreading of a light beam through a narrow slit causes the different wavelengths of light to interfere with each other to produce a pattern of light and dark bands. A diffraction grating is a plate of glass or metal ruled with close, equidistant parallel lines used for separating a wave train such as a beam of incident light into its component frequencies (white light results in a spectrum). The wavelength of sound is between 0.5 m/1.6 ft and 2.0 m/6.6 ft. When sound waves travel through doorways or between buildings they are diffracted significantly, so that the sound is heard round corners. The regular spacing of atoms in crystals are used to diffract X-rays, and in this way the structure of many substances has been elucidated, including that of proteins. sound wave Sound is the physiological sensation received by the ear, originating in a vibration that communicates itself as a pressure variation in the air and travels in every direction, spreading out as an expanding sphere. All sound waves in air travel with a speed dependent on the temperature; under ordinary conditions, this is about 330 m/1,070 ft per second. The pitch of the sound depends on the number of vibrations imposed on the air per second (frequency), but the speed is unaffected. The loudness of a sound is dependent primarily on the amplitude of the vibration of the air. Sound travels as a longitudinal wave, that is, its compressions and rarefactions are in the direction of propagation. Reflection of a sound wave is heard as an echo. Diffraction explains why sound can be heard round doorways. Sound travels faster in denser materials, such as solids and liquids. Gravity is the force of attraction that arises between objects by virtue of their masses. On earth, gravity is the force of attraction between any object in the earth's gravitational field and the earth itself. It is the force which keeps the planets in orbit around the sun. The gravitational force is the weakest of the four forces, but it acts over great distances. The particle that is postulated as the carrier of the gravitational force is the graviton. strong nuclear force The strong nuclear force was first described by the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa in 1935. It is the strongest of all the forces, acts only over very small distances (within the nucleus of the atom), and is responsible for binding together quarks to form hadrons, and for binding together protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus. The particle that is the carrier of the strong nuclear force is the gluon, of which there are eight kinds, each with zero mass and zero charge Unified field theory is a sought-for theory that would explain the four fundamental forces (strong nuclear, weak nuclear, electromagnetic, and gravity) in terms of a single unified force. By 1971 a theory developed by the U.S. physicists Steven Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, the Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam, and others, had demonstrated the link between the weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces. Called the electroweak force, experimental support came from observation at CERN in the 1980s. The next stage is to develop a theory (called the grand unified theory) that combines the strong nuclear force with the electroweak force. The final stage will be to incorporate gravity into the scheme. Superstring theory is a mathematical theory developed in the 1980s to explain the properties of elementary particles and the forces between them (in particular, gravity and the nuclear forces) in a way that combines relativity and quantum theory. In string theory, the fundamental objects in the universe are not pointlike particles but extremely small stringlike objects. These objects exist in a universe of ten dimensions, although, for reasons not yet understood, only three space dimensions and one dimension of time are discernible. There are many unresolved difficulties with superstring theory, but some physicists think it may be the ultimate \"theory of everything\" that explains all aspects of the universe within one framework. In his special theory of relativity, developed in 1905, starting with the premises that (1) the laws of nature are the same for all observers in unaccelerated motion, and (2) that the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source, Einstein arrived at some rather unexpected consequences. Intuitively familiar concepts, like mass, length, and time, had to be modified. For example, an object moving rapidly past an observer will appear to be both shorter and heavier than when it is at rest (that is, at rest relative to the observer), and a clock moving rapidly past the observer will appear to be running slower than when it is at rest. These changes are quite negligible at speeds less than about 1,500 km s�1, and only become appreciable at speeds approaching the speed of light. Einstein's general theory of relativity, developed in 1915, treats gravitation not as a force but as the curvature of space-time around a body. A planet's orbit around the sun (as observed in three-dimensional space) arises from its natural trajectory in modified space-time; there is no need to invoke, as Isaac Newton did, a force of gravity coming from the sun and acting on the planet. Einstein's general theory accounts for a peculiarity in the behavior of the motion of the perihelion of the orbit of the planet Mercury that cannot be explained in Newton's theory. Relativity also predicts that light rays should bend when they pass by a massive object, and that light should shift toward the red in the spectra of the sun or star in a gravitational field; both have been observed. Another prediction of relativity is gravitational waves, which should be produced when massive bodies are violently disturbed. These waves are so weak that they have not yet been detected with certainty, although observations of a pulsar (which emits energy at regular intervals) in orbit around another star have shown that the stars are spiraling together at the rate that would be expected if they were losing energy in the form of gravitational waves. General relativity is central to modern astrophysics and cosmology; it predicts, for example, the possibility of black holes. General relativity theory was inspired by the simple idea that it is impossible in a small region to distinguish between acceleration and gravitation effects (as in a lift one feels heavier when the lift accelerates upward), but the mathematical development of the idea is formidable. Such is not the case for the special theory, which a nonexpert can follow up to E = mc2 and beyond. �ngstr�m, Anders Jonas (1814�1874) Swedish astrophysicist who worked in spectroscopy and solar physics. In 1861 he identified the presence of hydrogen in the sun. His outstanding Recherches sur le spectre solaire (1868) presented an atlas of the solar spectrum with measurements of 1,000 spectral lines expressed in units of one-ten-millionth of a millimeter, the unit which later became the angstrom. He also investigated the conduction of heat and devised a method of determining thermal conductivity in 1863. His ''Optical investigations\" (1853) contains his principle of spectrum analysis, demonstrating that a hot gas emits light at the same frequency as it absorbs it when it is cooled. In 1867 he investigated the spectrum of the aurora borealis, the first person to do so. Bohr, Niels Henrik David (1885�1962) Danish physicist whose theoretical work in 1913 established the structure of the atom and the validity of quantum theory by showing that the nuclei of atoms are surrounded by shells of electrons, each assigned particular sets of quantum numbers according to their orbits. Bohr's atomic theory was validated in 1922 by the discovery of an element he had predicted, hafnium. He explained the structure and behavior of the nucleus, as well as the process of nuclear fission. He also proposed the doctrine of complementarity, the theory that a fundamental particle is neither a wave nor a particle, because these are complementary modes of description. In 1939 Bohr proposed his liquid-droplet model for the nucleus, in which nuclear particles are pulled together by short-range forces, similar to the way in which molecules in a drop of liquid are attracted to one another. The extra energy produced by the absorption of a neutron causes the nuclear particles to separate into two groups of approximately the same size, thus breaking the nucleus into two smaller nuclei�as happens in nuclear fission. The model was vindicated when Bohr correctly predicted the differing behavior of nuclei of uranium-235 and uranium-238 from the fact that the number of neutrons in each nucleus is odd and even respectively. Born, Max (1882�1970) German-born British physicist. In 1924 Born coined the term \"quantum mechanics\" and in 1925 he devised a system called matrix mechanics that accounted mathematically for the position and momentum of the electron in the atom. He received a Nobel prize in 1954 for fundamental work on quantum theory, especially his 1926 discovery that the wave function of an electron is linked to the probability that the electron is to be found at any point. He also devised a technique, called the Born approximation method, for computing the behavior of subatomic particles, which is of great use in high-energy physics. In 1953 Born was also able to determine the energies involved in lattice formation, from which the properties of crystals may be derived, and thus laid one of the foundations of solid-state physics. Broglie, Louis Victor Pierre Raymond de, 7th duc de Broglie (1892�1987) French theoretical physicist. He established that all subatomic particles can be described either by particle equations or by wave equations, thus laying the foundations of wave mechanics. De Broglie's discovery of wave�particle duality enabled physicists to view Einstein's conviction that matter and energy are interconvertible as being fundamental to the structure of matter. The study of matter waves led not only to a much deeper understanding of the nature of the atom but also to explanations of chemical bonds and the practical application of electron waves in electron microscopes. Carnot, (Nicolas Leonard) Sadi (1796�1832) French scientist and military engineer who founded the science of thermodynamics. His pioneering work was Reflexions sur la puissance motrice du feu/On the Motive Power of Fire, which considered the changes that would take place in an idealized, frictionless steam engine. Carnot's theorem showed that the amount of work that an engine can produce depends only on the temperature difference that occurs in the engine. In formulating his theorem, Carnot considered the case of an ideal heat engine following a reversible sequence known as the Carnot cycle. This cycle consists of the isothermal expansion and adiabatic expansion of a quantity of gas, producing work and consuming heat, followed by isothermal compression and adiabatic compression, consuming work and producing heat to restore the gas to its original state of pressure, volume, and temperature. Carnot's law states that no engine is more Einstein, Albert (1879�1955) German-born U.S. physicist whose theories of relativity revolutionized our understanding of matter, space, and time. Einstein suggested that packets of light energy are capable of behaving as particles called \"light quanta\" (later called photons). Einstein used this hypothesis to explain the photoelectric effect, proposing that light particles striking the surface of certain metals cause electrons to be emitted and deduced the photoelectric law, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921. Einstein went on to show in 1907 that mass is related to energy by the famous equation E = mc2, which indicates the enormous amount of energy that is stored as mass, some of which is released in radioactivity and nuclear reactions, for example in the sun. He also investigated Brownian motion, explaining the phenomenon as being due to the effect of large numbers of molecules (in this case, water molecules) bombarding the particles. Einstein's explanation of Brownian motion and its subsequent experimental confirmation was one of the most important pieces of evidence for the hypothesis that matter is composed of atoms. His special theory of relativity started with the premises that the laws of nature are the same for all observers in unaccelerated motion, and that the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source. In the general theory of relativity, the properties of space-time were to be conceived as modified locally by the presence of a body with mass; and light rays should bend when they pass by a massive object. His last conception of the basic laws governing the universe was outlined in his unified field theory, made public in 1953. Faraday, Michael (1791�1867) English chemist and physicist. In 1821 he began experimenting with electromagnetism and discovered the induction of electric currents and made the first dynamo, the first electric motor, and the first transformer. Faraday isolated benzene from gas oils and produced the basic laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday's laws of electrolysis established the link between electricity and chemical affinity, one of the most fundamental concepts in science. It was Faraday who coined the terms anode, cathode, cation, anion, electrode, and electrolyte. He demonstrated in 1837 that electrostatic force consists of a field of curved lines of force, and that different substances have specific inductive capacities�that is, they take up different amounts of electric charge when subjected to an electric field. He also pointed out that the energy of a magnet is in the field around it and not in the magnet itself, extending this basic conception of field theory to electrical and gravitational systems. Galileo, properly Galileo Galilei (1564�1642) Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist. Galileo discovered that freely falling bodies, heavy or light, have the same, constant acceleration and that this acceleration is due to gravity. He also determined that a body moving on a perfectly smooth horizontal surface would neither speed up nor slow down. He invented a thermometer, a hydrostatic balance, and a compass, and discovered that the path of a projectile is made up of two components: one component consists of uniform motion in a horizontal direction, and the other component is vertical motion under acceleration or deceleration due to gravity. Galileo used this explanation to refute objections to the sun-centered theory of Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Galileo's work founded the modern scientific method of deducing laws to explain the results of observation and experiment. Heaviside, Oliver (1850�1925) English physicist. In 1902 he predicted the existence of an ionized layer of air in the upper atmosphere, which was known as the Kennelly�Heaviside layer but is now called the E-layer of the ionosphere. Deflection from it makes possible the transmission of radio signals around the world, which would otherwise be lost in outer space. Heaviside's theoretical work had implications for radio transmission. His studies of electricity published in Electrical Papers (1892) had considerable impact on long-distance telephony, and he added the concepts of inductance, capacitance, and impedance to electrical science. Hertz, Heinrich Rudolf (1857�1894) German physicist who studied electromagnetic waves, showing their behavior resembles that of light and heat waves. He confirmed James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic waves. In 1888 he realized that electric waves could be produced and would travel through air, and he confirmed this experimentally. He went on to determine the velocity of these waves (later called radio waves) and, on showing that it was the same as that of light, devised experiments to show that the waves could be reflected, refracted, and diffracted. The unit of frequency, the hertz, is named for him. Michelson, Albert Abraham (1852�1931) German-born U.S. physicist. With his colleague Edward Morley (1838�1923), he performed in 1887 the Michelson-Morley experiment to detect the motion of the earth through the postulated ether (a medium believed to be necessary for the propagation of light). The negative result of the experiment demonstrated that the velocity of light is constant whatever the motion of the observer. The failure of the experiment indicated the nonexistence of the ether, and led Einstein to his theory of relativity. Michelson invented the Michelson interferometer to detect any difference in the velocity of light in two directions at right angles. Newton, Isaac (1642�1727) English physicist and mathematician who laid the foundations of physics as a modern discipline. During 1665�66, he discovered the binomial theorem, differential and integral calculus, and that white light is composed of many colors. He developed the three standard laws of motion (Newton's laws of motion) and the universal law of gravitation, set out in Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (1687, usually referred to as the Principia). Newton's greatest achievement was to demonstrate that scientific principles are of universal application. He clearly defined the nature of mass, weight, force, inertia, and acceleration. In 1679 he calculated the moon's motion on the basis of his theory of gravity and also found that his theory explained the laws of planetary motion that had been derived by the German astronomer Johannes Kepler on the basis of observations of the planets. Rutherford, Ernest, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson (1871�1937) New Zealand-born British physicist. His main research was in the field of radioactivity, and he discovered alpha, beta, and gamma rays. He was the first to recognize the nuclear nature of the atom in 1911. In 1919 he produced the first artificial transformation, changing one element to another by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles and getting hydrogen and oxygen. After further research he announced that the nucleus of any atom must be composed of hydrogen nuclei; at Rutherford's suggestion, the name \"proton\" was given to the hydrogen nucleus in 1920. He speculated that uncharged particles (neutrons) must also exist in the nucleus. In 1934, using heavy water, Rutherford and his co-workers bombarded deuterium with deuterons and produced tritium. This may be considered the first nuclear fusion reaction. Thomson, J(oseph) J(ohn) (1856�1940) English physicist. He discovered the electron in 1897. His work inaugurated the electrical theory of the atom, and his elucidation of positive rays and their application to an analysis of neon led to the discovery of isotopes. Using magnetic and electric fields to deflect positive rays, Thomson found in 1912 that ions of neon gas are deflected by different amounts, indicating that they consist of a mixture of ions with different charge-to-mass ratios. English chemist Frederick Soddy had earlier proposed the existence of isotopes and Thomson proved this idea correct when he identified, also in 1912, the isotope neon-22. Volta, Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio, Count (1745�1827) Italian physicist who invented the first electric cell (the voltaic pile, in 1800), the electrophorus (an early electrostatic generator, in 1775), and an electroscope. Volta also produced a list of metals in order of their electricity production based on the strength of the sensation they made on his tongue, thereby deriving the electromotive series. In about 1795, Volta recognized that the vapor pressure of a liquid is independent of the pressure of the atmosphere and depends only on temperature. The volt is named for him. observing the interference patterns produced. In mechanics, Young was the first to use the terms \"energy\" for the product of the mass of a body with the square of its velocity and \"labor expended\" for the product of the force exerted on a body \"with the distance through which it moved.\" He also stated that these two products are proportional to each other. He introduced an absolute measurement in elasticity, now known as Young's modulus. aerodynamics\n\nbranch of fluid physics that studies the forces exerted by air or other gases in motion. Examples include the airflow around bodies moving at speed through the atmosphere (such as land vehicles, bullets, rockets, and aircraft), the behavior of gas in engines and furnaces, air conditioning of buildings, the deposition of snow, the operation of aircushion vehicles (hovercraft), wind loads on buildings and bridges, bird and insect flight, musical wind instruments, and meteorology. For maximum efficiency, the aim is usually to design the shape of an object to produce a streamlined flow, with a minimum of turbulence in the moving air. alternating current (A.C.)\n\nelectric current that flows for an interval of time in one direction and then in the opposite direction, that is, a current that flows in alternately reversed directions through or around a circuit. Electric energy is usually generated as alternating current in a power station, and alternating currents may be used for both power and lighting. The advantage of alternating current over direct current (D.C.), as from a battery, is that its voltage can be raised or lowered economically by a transformer: high voltage for generation and transmission, and low voltage for safe utilization. domain\n\nsmall area in a magnetic material that behaves like a tiny magnet. The magnetism of the material is due to the movement of the electrons in the atoms of the domain. In an unmagnetized sample of material, the domains point in random directions, or form closed loops, so that there is no overall magnetization of the sample. In a magnetized sample, the domains are aligned so that their magnetic effects combine to produce a strong overall magnetism. echo\n\nrepetition of a sound wave, or of a radar or sonar signal, by reflection from a surface. By accurately measuring the time taken for an echo to return to the transmitter, and by knowing the speed of a radar signal (the speed of light) or a sonar signal (the speed of sound in water), it is possible to calculate the range of the object causing the echo (echolocation). element\n\nsubstance that cannot be split chemically into simpler substances. The atoms of a particular element all have the same number of protons in their nuclei (their atomic number). Elements are classified in the periodic table of the elements. Of the known elements, 92 are known to occur in nature (those with atomic numbers 1�92). Those elements with atomic numbers above 96 do not occur in nature and are synthesized only, produced in particle accelerators. Of the elements, 81 are stable; all the others, which include atomic numbers 43, 61, and from 84 up, are radioactive. entropy\n\nin thermodynamics, a parameter representing the state of disorder of a system at the atomic, ionic, or molecular level; the greater the disorder, the higher the entropy. Thus the fast-moving disordered molecules of water vapor have higher entropy than those of more ordered liquid water, which in turn have more entropy than the molecules in solid crystalline ice. In a closed system undergoing change, entropy is a measure of the amount of energy unavailable for useful work. At absolute zero (�273.15�C/�459.67�F/0 K), when all molecular motion ceases and order is assumed to be complete, entropy is zero. evaporation\n\nprocess in which a liquid turns to a vapor without its temperature reaching boiling point. A liquid left to stand in a saucer eventually evaporates because, at any time, a proportion of its molecules will be fast enough (have enough kinetic energy) to escape through the attractive intermolecular forces at the liquid surface into the atmosphere. The temperature of the liquid tends to fall because the evaporating molecules remove energy from the liquid. The rate of evaporation rises with increased temperature because as the mean kinetic energy of the liquid's molecules rises, so will the number possessing enough energy to escape. field\n\nregion of space in which an object exerts a force on another separate object because of certain properties they both possess. For example, there is a force of attraction between any two objects that have mass when one is in the gravitational field of the other. Other fields of force include electric fields (caused by electric charges) and magnetic fields (caused by circulating electric currents), either of which can involve attractive or repulsive forces. force\n\nany influence that tends to change the state of rest or the uniform motion in a straight line of a body. The action of an unbalanced or resultant force results in the acceleration of a body in the direction of action of the force, or it may, if the body is unable to move freely, result in its deformation (see Hooke's law). Force is a vector quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction; its SI unit is the newton. freezing\n\nchange from liquid to solid state, as when water becomes ice. For a given substance, freezing occurs at a definite temperature, known as the freezing point, that is invariable under similar conditions of pressure, and the temperature remains at this point until all the liquid is frozen. The amount of heat per unit mass that has to be removed to freeze a substance is a constant for any given substance, and is known as the latent heat of fusion. Geiger counter\n\nany of a number of devices used for detecting nuclear radiation and/or measuring its intensity by counting the number of ionizing particles produced. It detects the momentary current that passes between electrodes in a suitable gas when a nuclear particle or a radiation pulse causes the ionization of that gas. The electrodes are connected to electronic devices that enable the number of particles passing to be measured. The increased frequency of measured particles indicates the intensity of radiation. The device is named for the German physicist Hans Geiger. inductance\n\nphenomenon where a changing current in a circuit builds up a magnetic field which induces an electromotive force either in the same circuit and opposing the current (self-inductance) or in another circuit (mutual inductance). The SI unit of inductance is the henry (symbol H). A component designed to introduce inductance into a circuit is called an inductor (sometimes inductance) and is usually in the form of a coil of wire. The energy stored in the magnetic field of the coil is proportional to its inductance and the current flowing through it. kinetic theory\n\ntheory describing the physical properties of matter in terms of the behavior�principally movement�of its component atoms or molecules. The temperature of a substance is dependent on the velocity of movement of its constituent particles, increased temperature being accompanied by increased movement. A gas consists of rapidly moving atoms or molecules and, according to kinetic theory, it is their continual impact on the walls of the containing vessel that accounts for the pressure of the gas. The slowing of molecular motion as temperature falls, according to kinetic theory, accounts for the physical properties of liquids and solids, culminating in the concept of no molecular motion at absolute zero (0K/�273�C). By making various assumptions about the nature of gas molecules, it is possible to derive from the kinetic theory the various gas laws (such as Avogadro's hypothesis, Boyle's law, and Charles's law). perpetual motion\n\nidea that a machine can be designed and constructed in such a way that, once started, it will continue in motion indefinitely without requiring any further input of energy (motive power). Such a device would contradict at least one of the two laws of thermodynamics that state that (1) energy can neither be created nor destroyed (the law of conservation of energy) and (2) heat cannot by itself flow from a cooler to a hotter object. As a result, all practical (real) machines require a continuous supply of energy, and no heat engine is able to convert all the heat into useful work. potential difference (pd)\n\ndifference in the electrical potential (see potential, electric) of two points, being equal to the electrical energy converted by a unit electric charge moving from one point to the other. The SI unit of potential difference is the volt (V). The potential difference between two points in a circuit is commonly referred to as voltage. In equation terms, potential difference V may be defined by: V = W/Q, where W is the electrical energy converted in joules and Q is the charge in coulombs. pressure\n\nin a fluid, the force that would act normally (at right angles) per unit surface area of a body immersed in the fluid. The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), equal to a pressure of one newton per square meter. In the atmosphere, the pressure declines with height from about 100 kPa at sea level to zero where the atmosphere fades into space. Pressure is commonly measured with a barometer, manometer, or Bourdon gauge. Other common units of pressure are the bar and the torr. quantum theory\n\ntheory that energy does not have a continuous range of values, but is, instead, absorbed or radiated discontinuously, in multiples of definite, indivisible units called quanta. Just as earlier theory showed how light, generally seen as a wave motion, could also in some ways be seen as composed of discrete particles (photons), quantum theory shows how atomic particles such as electrons may also be seen as having wavelike properties. Quantum theory is the basis of particle physics, modern theoretical chemistry, and the solid-state physics that describes the behavior of the silicon chips used in computers. resistance\n\nthat property of a conductor that restricts the flow of electricity through it, associated with the conversion of electrical energy to heat; also the magnitude of this property. Resistance depends on many factors, such as the nature of the material, its temperature, dimensions, and thermal properties; degree of impurity; the nature and state of illumination of the surface; and the frequency and magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is the ohm. Resistance = voltage/current. Seebeck effect\n\ngeneration of a voltage in a circuit containing two different metals, or semiconductors, by keeping the junctions between them at different temperatures. Discovered by the German physicist Thomas Seebeck (1770�1831), it is also called the thermoelectric effect, and is the basis of the thermocouple. It is the opposite of the Peltier effect (in which current flow causes a temperature difference between the junctions of different metals). sievert\n\nSI unit (symbol Sv) of radiation dose equivalent. It replaces the rem (1 Sv =100 rem). Some types of radiation do more damage than others for the same absorbed dose�for example, an absorbed dose of alpha radiation causes 20 times as much biological damage as the same dose of beta radiation. The equivalent dose in sieverts is equal to the absorbed dose of radiation in grays multiplied by the relative biological effectiveness. Humans can absorb up to 0.25 Sv without immediate ill effects; 1 Sv may produce radiation sickness; and more than 8 Sv causes death. spectrum\n\n(plural spectra) arrangement of frequencies or wavelengths when electromagnetic radiations are separated into their constituent parts. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and most sources emit waves over a range of wavelengths that can be broken up or \"dispersed\"; white light can be separated into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. There are many types of spectra, both emission and absorption, for radiation and particles, used in spectroscopy. An incandescent body gives rise to a continuous spectrum where the dispersed radiation is distributed uninterruptedly over a range of wavelengths. An element gives a line spectrum�one or more bright discrete lines at characteristic wavelengths. Molecular gases give band spectra in which there are groups of close-packed lines. In an absorption spectrum dark lines or spaces replace the characteristic bright lines of the absorbing medium. The mass spectrum of an element is obtained from a mass spectrometer and shows the relative proportions of its constituent isotopes. speed of light\n\nspeed at which light and other electromagnetic waves travel through empty space. Its value is 299,792,458 m/186,281 mi per second. The speed of light is the highest speed possible, according to the theory of relativity, and its value is independent of the motion of its source and of the observer. It is impossible to accelerate any material body to this speed because it would require an infinite amount of energy. speed of sound\n\nspeed at which sound travels through a medium, such as air or water. In air at a temperature of 0�C/32�F, the speed of sound is 331 m/1,087 ft per second. At higher temperatures, the speed of sound is greater; at 18�C/64�F it is 342 m/1,123 ft per second. It is greater in liquids and solids; for example, in water it is around 1,440 m/4,724 ft per second, depending on the temperature. spin\n\nintrinsic angular momentum of a subatomic particle, nucleus, atom, or molecule, which continues to exist even when the particle comes to rest. A particle in a specific energy state has a particular spin, just as it has a particular electric charge and mass. According to quantum theory, this is restricted to discrete and indivisible values, specified by a spin quantum number. Because of its spin, a charged particle acts as a small magnet and is affected by magnetic fields. surface tension\n\nproperty that causes the surface of a liquid to behave as if it were covered with a weak elastic skin; this is why a needle can float on water. It is caused by the exposed surface's tendency to contract to the smallest possible area because of cohesive forces between molecules at the surface. Allied phenomena include the formation of droplets, the concave profile of a meniscus, and the capillary action by which water soaks into a sponge. temperature\n\ndegree or intensity of heat of an object and the condition that determines whether it will transfer heat to another object or receive heat from it, according to the laws of thermodynamics. The temperature of an object is a measure of the average kinetic energy possessed by the atoms or molecules of which it is composed. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (symbol K) used with the Kelvin scale. Other measures of temperature in common use are the Fahrenheit scale and the Celsius scale. generally materials with many free electrons (such as metals). Thermal conductivity is expressed in units of joules per second per meter per kelvin (J s�1 m�1 K�1). For a block of material of cross-sectional area a and length l, with temperatures T1 and T2 at its end faces, the thermal conductivity l equals Hl/at(T2�T1), where H is the amount of heat transferred in time t. uncertainty principle, or indeterminacy principle\n\nin quantum mechanics, the principle that it is impossible to know with unlimited accuracy the position and momentum of a particle. The principle arises because in order to locate a particle exactly, an observer must bounce light (in the form of a photon) off the particle, which must alter its position in an unpredictable way. It was established by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, and gave a theoretical limit to the precision with which a particle's momentum and position can be measured simultaneously: the more accurately the one is determined, the more uncertainty there is in the other."
