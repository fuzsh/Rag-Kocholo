The Nobel Prize in Physics for 1917 was announced on November 12th, 1918. Charles Glover Barkla's Nobel Banquet was held on June 1st, 1920, and he gave his Nobel Lecture on June 3rd, 1920. Barkla's Nobel Diploma reads:

"Kungliga svenska vetenskaps akademien har vid sitt sammanträde den 12 November 1918 i enlighet med föreskrifterna i det af Alfred Nobel den 27 November 1895 upprättade testamente beslutat att öfverlämna det pris som för 1917 bortgifves åt den som inom Fysikens område har gjort den viktigaste upptäckt eller uppfinning till Charles G. Barkla för hans upptäckt af den karakteristika röntgenstrålningen hos elementen. Stockholm den 2 Juni 1919."

"In accordance with the wishes of the will drawn up by Alfred Nobel on 27 November 1895, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided at its meeting held on 12 November 1918 to award the 1917 prize given to that person in the field of Physics who has made the most important discovery or invention to Charles G. Barkla for his discovery of the characteristic Röntgen radiation of the elements. Stockholm 2 June 1919."

Barkla's Nobel Diploma was created by Sofia Gisberg (1854-1926), who was a teacher of textile design at the Högre konstindustriella skolan (now Konstfack, the University College of Arts, Craft and Design) in Stockholm. In addition to creating the Physics and Chemistry Diplomas awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 1926, she designed the textiles hanging in Ösmo Church, Nynäshamn, and at Gustavsberg Church, Stockholm.
