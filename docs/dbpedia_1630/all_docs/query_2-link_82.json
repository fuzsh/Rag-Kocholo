        "text": "Specifications Lotus 18 F1 OW 1960 blueprint\n\nThe Lotus 18 F1 OW 1960 is a single seater racing car that is a part of the Lotus Formula One fleet. This sleek, lightweight vehicle features a classic shape that incorporates a wraparound windshield, exposed rear-mounted engine, and a sleeker design than its predecessors. The lightweight aluminum and fiberglass body has the easily recognizable Lotus badge on its side and is consistent with other Formula One cars of the same era. The Lotus 18 is powered by a 1.5-liter inline-four engine, built by Climax and Goodyear, which produces more than 200 horsepower. This engine is connected to a four-speed manual transmission, enabling drivers to quickly change speeds on the track. The car has a mid-engine design which puts the weight at about 900 kg, making it an ideal platform for driving at high speeds. The suspensions setup of the Lotus 18 is complex and sophisticated for the time. The car features independent double wishbones and torsion-bars at the performance, which helps to keep the car planted and enables drivers to take corners with precision. The car also features drum brakes at all four corners, providing powerful stopping power. The interior of the Lotus 18 is very sparse. The simplistic cockpit is designed to keep the driver focused on the track in front of them. The dash has few sporting instruments, and the steering wheel has just a few basic buttons needed for the racing functions. The Lotus 18 is a classic visual reminder of a different era of Formula One; a sleek, lightweight car designed with performance and speed in mind."
