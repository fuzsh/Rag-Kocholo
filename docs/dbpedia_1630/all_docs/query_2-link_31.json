        "meta_description": "1961 Lotus 18/21 was completed with proper Formula One specifications. This Lotus 18/21 was built by UDT-Laystall Racing team for use in the 1961 Formula One season. Upon its debut, Sir Stirling Moss piloted this car, Chassis 918, to victory at Brands Hatch in June of 1961. After being rebuilt following a crash at Spa Francorchamps, its second race resulted in another victory for Sir Stirling Moss at Karlskoga. After these two wins, UDT-Laystall traded the car to Rob Walker Racing for use in the 1962 Formula One season. Under Rob Walker Racingâ€™s ownership, Maurice Trintignant piloted the car to another victory in the Pau Grand Prix. Following this race, Graham Hill and Chassis 918 also found themselves on the podium. Rob Walker Racing then sold the car to a privateer who installed a Ford V8 to race in Formula Libre. The car was severely damaged in 1964 by a wreck. The car sat until 1993, when Alan Baillie rebuilt the car, finishing in 1995. The car then competed in vintage races at marques such as Monterey, Goodwood, Silverstone, Isle of Man, and many other tracks across the US and UK. S/N: 918 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is currently powered by a 1.5-liter Coventry Climax FPF inline-four-cylinder engine, which was rebuilt in the early 2000s and features a replacement engine block. Fitted on the 1.5-Liter engine are two Weber DCOE carburetors, a crossflow cylinder head with dual overhead camshafts, a dry-sump oiling system and Bosch ignition. The engine is mated to a Hewland HD5 five-speed manual transaxle. The suspension is a Lotus Type 21 specification, differing from the Type 18 suspension through transverse upper links instead of fixed-length half shafts for upper links. Girling disc brakes provide stopping power through the 15-inch, staggered, wobbly-web wheels and Dunlop tires. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2012, Jim Groom repaired the radiator and oil cooler. Around the same time, the car was refinished&nbsp;in the current green UDT-Laystall livery, and the transaxle was resealed. Between 2011 and 2012, the left rear upright was repaired, and the half-shaft U-joints and hub bearings were replaced. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last time this car was regularly used was approximately seven years ago. Sold with a Bill of Sale, no title, as this is a race-only vehicle. Selling at Public Auction on Saturday, May 18, 2024. Henderson Auctions Collector Motor Series will take place at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum in Birmingham, AL. www.hendersonmotorseries.com for details!",
