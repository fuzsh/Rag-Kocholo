        "text": "Description\n\n***This car is not currently located at Fantasy Junction, but can be viewed by appointment.***\n\n1960 Lotus 18 Formula Jr.\n\nArch number 987168\n\nBritish Racing Green with Red interior\n\nThe Lotus 18 was Lotus’ first mid-engine creation, and was extremely successful. Fitted with a Ford 105E series 1100cc engine, the 18 was campaigned in Formula Junior events in the United States were they proved to be the dominant machine throughout the period. Fitted with a Climax FPF engine, the 18 was successfully campaigned in Formula II, and was the first Lotus chassis to win a Formula One race, in 1960. In total, about 120 Lotus 18s were produced for use in the Formula Junior (US delivery), 29 built for use in Europe’s Formula II series, and two factory cars were used in Formula one races in 1960.\n\nThis particular car was purchased in 1995 by its current owner from Robin LeGrand, the son of Red LeGrand, who designed and built the LeGrand race cars. When Robin purchased the car, he had a falling out with the seller, who, out of spite, then destroyed the number on the dash plaque. The current owner sent the plate to the Department of Justice in an effort to forensically reconstruct the number, which could only be partially recovered. Nevertheless, the car’s arch number is undisturbed. The current owner completed a full restoration of the car which included the construction of a new frame, and the old frame was retained and goes with the car. The arch number was moved over to the new frame. The car has a Crowther motor with Richardson head, and is fitted with a five-speed Hewland transaxle. The original Renault transaxle has been retained and also goes with the car, along with the required bell housing adapter to install it.\n\nOther items of note on the car’s current specification include:\n\n1. Fuel cell fitted\n\n2. Acusump fitted\n\n3. 6 quart fully baffled oil pain fitted\n\n4. High output dry sump oil pump\n\n5. Halon fire system\n\n6. Electronic ignition\n\n7. Aforementioned fitment of the Hewland transaxle\n\n8. Richardson cylinder head on Crowther lower end, and polished ports\n\nThe car has an extensive spares package including Renault transaxle with bell housing adapter, 4 brake drums, clutch, flywheel, 2 pressure plates, 2 A arms, complete Lotus 18 frame with 4 coolant pipes, rod ends, cylinder head with valves and springs, and miscellaneous hardware and other parts.\n\nThe restoration was completed in the late 1990s and was completed to extraordinarily high standards. The car remains extremely fresh and was last raced in 2010, although the car had a light service in July of 2013. The compression was tested at that time and found to be consistent and high. Currently the car is geared for Sonoma Raceway and Laguna Seca.\n\nThe car is in excellent cosmetic condition, with very nice vintage racer cosmetics. The paint is in very nice condition, with nice glossy paint and a few small stress cracks only and a chip on the front Lotus badge. The chassis and suspension are nicely detailed and the interior was nicely restored with red seat, dash, and steering wheel rim. The correct Smiths gauges are in place. The engine compartment is extremely clean and well-detailed. It was obviously prepared with modern vintage racing in mind, with stainless steel lines, Aeroquip fittings, Accusump, and other modern safety features.\n\nThe car comes with a photo album depicting the car before, during, and after the restoration, as well as invoices from the restoration, set up sheets, lap timing sheets, and correspondence. The car also has a log book and its original Lotus dash plate.\n\nThis is an absolutely top quality Lotus 18, which would supply a very enjoyable and exciting way into the world of Vintage Racing. Furthermore, the car is an excellent value, being directly linked to and almost visually indistinguishable from the car in which Stirling Moss won the Monaco Grand Prix in 1960.\n\n***This car is not currently located at Fantasy Junction, but can be viewed by appointment.***"
