        "text": "Lotus car designs are identified by mark and type numbers. Team Lotus was responsible for Sports Racing and Formula cars and Lotus Cars was responsible for Production, GT and Touring cars. Team Lotus and Lotus Cars would take the next available number as and when each new project required identification. (Occasionally lines would cross and the same number was taken by both enterprises.)\n\nIn the 50s and 60s Team Lotus would campaign each of its designs as Works entries. (Most Works cars were subsequently sold on to private entrants and collectors. For some cars, title was retained by the team, because either the car was written-off or kept for the Works Collection.)\n\nHaving proven each design, Team Lotus would construct and sell non-Works cars to customers, as new.\n\nThe Team Lotus archive - which includes the build records for each Team Lotus design - has the register of all the Team Lotus cars constructed. For type numbers below with images, clicking on the image will lead to the register for that type.\n\nBack"
