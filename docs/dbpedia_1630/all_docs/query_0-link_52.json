        "text": "Formula 1 2010: Lotus-Cosworth\n\nTeam: Lotus Racing\n\nNationality: England\n\nCar Numbers: 18, 19\n\nChassis: T127\n\nEngine: Cosworth CA2010\n\nGearbox: Xtrac 1044\n\nElectronics: McLaren SECU\n\nDampers: Penske\n\nBrakes: AP Racing / Hitco\n\nWheels: –\n\nDrivers: Jarno Trulli, Heikki Kovalainen, Fairuz Fauzy\n\nLotus was a late addition to the 2010 Formula 1 field taking the place of the BMW Sauber team after it withdrew from the sport mid season. Sauber subsequently returned to the entry list having taken Toyota’s place. Originally the team was to be Litespeed GP, a spin off of Steve Kenchington’s Formula 3 team but after Malaysian business got involved the team became Lotus – its first car (or the 127th Lotus) the T127 was launched in London in mid February.\n\nThe car is not the most advanced on the grid, but does appear solid. Its is said to be capable of springing a few suprsises during the season and is “well under” the weight limit. Using the Xtrac 1044 gear box casing has limited the rear suspension geometry somewhat, but a revision may appear later in the season.\n\nTechnical Directors View\n\nFrom the moment I was asked in May by Litespeed to look at designing a car, we approached Cosworth and we had draft contracts in place. And, with those draft contracts in place, they supplied all the engine details. So from May we were designing a chassis to fit a Cosworth engine and Xtrac gearbox.\n\nThe fact that when we were making that choice, the only thing we were made aware of in the whole process of entry to F1 was that we had to have an engine – and we had to have a contract in place. And when I looked at the design resource that I had, what was being offered by Cosworth and Xtrac as well, with a gearbox that fitted directly to the engine, with a hydraulic pack and everything that all mated together and tested together, from an engineering perspective there was only one choice to make. There was only one way of being on the grid on time and that was going down that route. So, it was a choice I made and a very simple engineering design choice to make"
