        "text": "History:\n\nIt is probably fair to say that the Lotus 18 is one of the more important cars in Lotus history. The 18 achieved a number of significant firsts for Lotus. Below are some of them.\n\n1.The 18 is the first mid-engined Lotus.\n\n2. The 18 is the first Lotus to win in Formula 2. Innes Ireland won the Oulton Park Trophy Formula race April 2, 1960.\n\n3. The 18 is the first Lotus to win in Formula 1. Innes Ireland won the non-championship Glover Trophy race on April 8, 1960.\n\n4. The 18 brought Lotus its first Grand Prix victory, the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix. Stirling Moss drove Rob Walker’s Lotus 18 to victory. Moss won Monaco again in 1961 in the 18, besting the “Sharknose” Ferraris of Phil Hill and Richie Ginther\n\n5. According to Lotus Cars, Chapman said he regarded the Type 18 as “the first true Formula 1 car he had designed and built, his previous front-engined efforts being merely dabbling.”\n\n6. The Lotus 18, in Formula Junior spec., brought Lotus its first Formula Junior victories, and first championship with Jim Clark and Trevor Taylor dominating the 1960 season and sharing the championship.\n\n7.The Lotus 18 was Jim Clark’s first Formula One car.\n\nIn 1960, Lotus 18 F1 cars were powered by a 2.5 liter Coventry Climax FPF engines. In 1961 the new F1 engine rules limited engines to 1.5 liters. Some cars with 2.5 liter engines were converted to 1.5 liter engines. Some, like the Ferrari 156 F1 cars were designed and built around the 1.5 liter engine formula from the start. Some cars that formerly raced as F2 cars with 1.5 liter engines were now able to race in F1 as well. This Lotus began its racing career with the 1.5 liter Coventry Climax FPF engine, which it raced in both F2 and F1.\n\nThe F1 spec 18’s raced with the lightweight magnesium alloy Lotus sequential manual gearbox. These gearboxes were improved for the 18 by Mike Costin by incorporating a dedicated oil scavenge and pressure feed pump.\n\nThe Ex-Tony Marsh Lotus 18 offered here, chassis 909, was built by Lotus to its F1/F2 specification. Marsh took delivery of the car in mid-1960. The race results for the car are as follows:\n\nLotus Components – Type 18, No. 909, Competition History\n\nDATE DRIVER ENTRANT VENUE CATEGORY RESULT EVENT\n\n8-08-60 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Brands Hatch F2 1.5 6th Kentish 100\n\n18-09-60 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Zeltweg F2 1.5 5th Flugplatzr Zeltweg\n\n2-10-60 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Modena F2 1.5 7th Modena GP\n\n8-10-60 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Innesbruck F2 1.5 4th Prreis van Tirol\n\n16-10-60 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Brands Hatch F2 1.5 1st Lewis Evans Tr.\n\n26-12-60 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Brands Hatch F2 1.5 1st Silver City Trophy\n\n3.04.61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Goodwood F1 1.5 7th Glover Trophy\n\n9-04-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Heysel FI 1.5 3rd Agr.Brussels GP\n\n22-04-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Aintree FI 1.5 7th Aintree 200\n\n22-05-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Crystal PalaceFI 1.5 3rd London Trophy\n\n3-06-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Brands Hatch FI l.5 6th Silver City Trophy\n\n10-06-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Shelsley Hill Climb BTD\n\n18-06-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Spa Fl 1.5 DNQ Belgian GP\n\n18-06-61 Willy Mairesse Equip National Spa Fl 1.5 Rtd Belgian GP\n\n1-07-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Rest and beThankful Hill Climb BTD\n\n15-07-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Aintree FI 1.5 Rtd British GP\n\n27-07-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Bouley Bay Hill Climb 1st in class\n\n6-08-61 Tony Marsh Tony Marsh Nurburgring Fl 1.5 3 15th German GP\n\n11-06-62 Graham Eden/Gerry Ashmore Crystal Palace Fl 1.5 Rtd Crystal Palace Trophy\n\n1-09-62 Graham Eden/Gerry Ashmore Oulton Park FI 1.5 Rtd Gold Cup\n\nThe complete ownership history for chassis 909 is as follows:\n\nORIGINAL OWNER: TONY MARSH 1960-1962\n\nGERRY ASHMORE FOR GRAHAM EDEN 1962\n\nTOM NORTON 1963\n\nPETER BLANKSTONE 1963\n\nLAWRIE HICKMAN 1964-1977\n\nPHIL CADE 1978-1982\n\nJOEL FINN 1983-1988\n\nNICK MASON 1988-2008\n\nBRUCE REVENNAUGH 2008\n\nThe Lotus has a chassis tag on the dash with the number 909 on it. It appears to be a replacement tag. However, the car does have a number stamped on a metal tag that is brazed to the frame on the lower front bulkhead, below the dash and between the driver’s legs. This number, stamping, location, and method of attachment, are all correct for original frame numbers on the Lotus 18’s. The number itself has been scarred over years of use, but may say “R2,” or “H2,” or “F2,” or other. It is hard to discern at this time.\n\nMost recently the Lotus has been raced at premier historic racing events in the U.S., including multiple appearances at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races, and at the SVRA National Championship at Circuit of the Americas, in Texas.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Lotus is powered by its period correct 1.5 liter, Crosthwaite and Gardiner built, Coventry Climax FPF engine, The engine is mated to the also correct, C&G built, Lotus 5 speed sequential gearbox. The rest of the car is as restored by Cedric Selzer, Jim Clark’s Team Lotus mechanic during the early 1960’s. The Lotus has been maintained in excellent historic racing condition ever since. Spares include a beautiful new box of gears from C&G.\n\nThe Lotus comes with current FIA, HTP papers issued in 2013.\n\nWe can also assist with shipping.\n\nChassis Number: 909"
