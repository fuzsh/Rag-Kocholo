As headteacher, my role is to provide a secure and safe environment for our children that will allow them to grow and develop into confident young people, who achieve their full potential. Our school is a place where everyone feels welcomed, respected and valued as we follow in the footsteps of Jesus.\n\nI am passionate about providing an inclusive education, through a curriculum that is exciting and provides many opportunities and experiences for our pupils. St Mark’s is a place where children love to learn and success is celebrated.\n\nThe children, staff and Governors of St. Mark’s Catholic Primary School hope you enjoy visiting our website and getting to know us. If you are thinking of sending your child to St. Mark’s, please make an appointment to have a look around, you would be more than welcome.\n\nIf you would like paper copies of any of the policies / documents on our website or you require any further information, please contact the school office.\n\nMiss Bradshaw\n\nHeadteacher"
