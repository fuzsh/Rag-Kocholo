According to The Comprehensive Gazateer of England and Wales, 1894-5 \"...The ancient parish church belonged to Beauchief Abbey. There are chapels for Congregationalists, Wesleyans, Roman Catholics, Primitive and United Free Methodists...\" The Alfreton Parish Church is dedicated to St Martin. It has a perpendicular west tower (13th century), south arcade with octagonal piers (circa 1325) and north arcade (dating 1868). Most of the windows are of the perpendicular period. The church was given to Beauchief abbey by Robert Fitzralph, the founder, during the reign of Henry II.

Registrations of births, marriages & deaths for Alfreton after 1837 would be in the registration district of Belper. There is a cemetery in Alfreton. It is unknown whether there are any BRAILSFORDs buried there. A microfilm of original records for 1891-1997 is held at the DBY Record Office at Matlock.\n\nAshover, Derbyshire; All Saints Church\n\nAshover All Saints Church\n\nThe Ashover Parish Church is dedicated to All Saints. The DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1621-1623, 1653-1965 (no records for 1624-1652); Marriages 1653-1943; Marriage Banns 1653-1661 1823-1904; Burials 1653-1960. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Chesterfield.\n\nAult Hucknall, Nottinghamshire; St John The Baptist Church\n\nThe parish of Ault Hucknall covers a large area including hamlets of Stainsby with Tunstall, Rowthorne, Slingsby, Bramley Vale, hardstoft, Astwith, Timber Lane and Senor. In the 1800s Glapwell was added, and later the vilage of Doe Lea. The Church dedicated to St John the Baptist comprises a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, south porch and a tower between the nave and chancel.\n\nThe DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1662-1910; Marriages 1662-1915; Marriage Banns 1755-1772; Burials 1662-1922. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Mansfield.\n\nBirmingham, Warwickshire; St Mary's Church, Whittall St\n\nBurials at St Mary's Church Whittall St, Birmingham, date from 1779. Christenings date from 1774. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths for Ashover after 1837 are in the registration district of Birmingham until 1925, after which the registration district was split into Birmingham North and Birmingham South.\n\nBirmingham, Warwickshire; St Martin's Church\n\nChristenings, marriages and burials at St Martin's Church date from as early as 1554.\n\nBirmingham, Warwickshire; Warstone Lane Cemetery\n\nWarstone Lane Cemetery was opened in 1848 by the Birmingham Church of England Cemetery Company. It was later purchased by the Birmingham City Council. No new graves are available.\n\nBlackwell by Alfreton, Derbyshire; St Werburgh's Church\n\nBlackwell is 3ï¿½ miles NE from Alfreton. The church is dedicated to St Werburgh. From Kelly's Directory 1891\n\n\"...The church of St Werburg is a small edifice of stone, consisting or chancel, nave, aisles, south porch and a lofty embattled western tower containing 3 bells, dated respectively 1878, 1611 and 1587: the church, with the exception of part of the arcade on the north side, was rebuilt in 1827-8, and again rebuilt and enlarged, with the exception of the tower, in 1879, at a cost of ï¿½2,260, under the direction of Mr J H Mitchel1-Withers, architect, of Sheffield: the church affords 220 sittings: in the south-east corner of the churchyard is an old Runic stone, supposed to be part of an ancient cross, coeval with and closely resembling the cross at Taddington; it stands 5 feet out or the ground and measures 16 inches by 12 inches; the east and west sides are carved with interlacing knot work and the north and south with circular braids: in the churchyard is also a remarkable yew tree. The register dates from the year 1685...\"\n\nThe DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1685-1901; Marriages 1685-1907; Marriage Banns 1754-1770 1880-1899; Burials 1685-1913. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Bakewell.\n\nBlidworth, Nottinghamshire; St Mary's Church of the Purification\n\nBlidworth St Mary's Church of the Purification\n\nPart of the church fell down in 1736. According to parish records this was ï¿½due to a bad state of repair and unskilfull workmanship undermining one of the pillarsï¿½. From White's Directory 1853: The church is a neat structure, with a tower and three bells, and was partly rebuilt in the early part of the last century. It was also greatly enlarged and beautified in 1839, when the old chancel was taken down, and the tower raised about five feet, and in 1850 it was newly painted.\n\nFishpool is a hamlet which forms part of the village. Both Blidworth & Fishpool are named as the residences of various Brailsford families descending from James BRELSFORD & Esther ATHRON after their arrival ca 1809. The widowed James was the publican of the pub \"Bird in Hand\", from before 1851 until his death in 1858. Another (currently unrelated) Brailsford family arrived before 1939; Francis WALTER Brailsford & his wife Louisa Thompson. Walter was killed in a pit disaster in the town in 1939. Although it is unlikely that any Brailsfords will be found in records here prior to 1809, below are a number of possible records of relevance at the LDS: Births and baptisms, 1833-1836 Wesleyan Church (Blidworth, England)\n\nBishop's transcripts of Blidworth, 1635-1835. Church of England. Parish Church of Blidworth (Nottinghamshire)\n\nChurch records, 1933-1966 Wesleyan Methodist Chapel (Blidworth, England)\n\nMarriages at Blidworth, 1566-1837 Church of England. Parish Church of Blidworth (Nottinghamshire)\n\nParish registers, 1707-1825 Church of England. Parish Church of Blidworth (Nottinghamshire)\n\nSeventeenth century parish register transcripts belonging to the peculiar of Southwell Blagg, Thomas Mathews\n\nBolsterstone, Yorkshire; St Mary's Church\n\nBolsterstone St Mary's Church\n\nThe chapelry of Bolsterstone is within the township of Bradford, in the parish of Ecclesfield. The current St Mary's Church at Bolsterstone was built in 1879. According to A Topographical Dictionary of Yorkshire (1822) The chapel was founded as early as 1412 by Sir Robert Rockley, originally a private chantry, but later used as a place of public worship by the inhabitants of the manor. Records of Baptisms deposited at Sheffield Archives are 1736-1914, with some gaps. Burials deposited cover 1736-1856, again with some gaps. Marriages are recorded from 1868-1972.\n\nRegistrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Ecclesfield.\n\nBrailsford, Derbyshire; All Saints Church\n\nBrailsford All Saints Church\n\nBrailsford All Saints Church\n\nThe Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a half church in each of Brailsford and Ednaston which stands approximately halfway between the two locations. The original Saxon church was probably built jointly by the Saxon Lords of the two Manors, Earl Waltheof and Toki in the 11th century. Little now exists of the original Saxon structure, apart from some foundations and small sections of wall. Norman extensions included the tower, built about 1370-1490. Now consisting of a nave, chancel, south aisle and tower containing six bells, it is known as the All Saints Church in the Parish of Brailsford.\n\nSaxon Cross at the Brailsford All Saints Church\n\nIn the churchyard grows a yew tree certified to be over 1000 years of age. The base and lower part of the shaft of a Saxon Cross, also believed to date mid 11th century has been erected on a new base near its original location. The bottom part of the Saxon Cross shaft is cylindrical in shape, tapering towards the top and bottom. The lower half has no ornamental decoration. The upper section shows scrolls around a human figure; a warrior with drawn sword. This decoration is topped by two horizontal bands. The section above these bands is square in cross-section and decorated with plait and key-pattern carvings. The position of the remaining part of the cross is not known. It is thought that perhaps it lies buried in the church yard somewhere, as it was relatively recently in 1919 that the lower part of the shaft was discovered, buried near the original base.\n\nThe DRO has microfilm for:(no entries for bap/mar/bur in 1696-1705) Baptisms 1647-1695, 1706-1962; Marriages 1647-1695,1706-1965; Marriage Banns 1780-1781, 1823-1955; Burials 1647-1695, 1706-1981. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Ashbourne.\n\nBrodsworth, Yorkshire; St Michael's Church\n\nBrodsworth St Michael's Church\n\nThere was a Brailsford marriage and two christenings at this Church 1806-1807, but no known burials. The hamlet Pigburn is within the parish of Brodsworth & is mentioned as the birthplace of one of these children.\n\nSources include:\n\nBishop's transcripts for Brodsworth, 1600-1871 Church of England. Parish Church of Brodsworth (Yorkshire)\n\nMarriage records, 1813-1837 Church of England. Parish Church of Brodsworth (Yorkshire)\n\nThe parish register of Brodsworth, 1538-1813 Church of England.

Parish Church of Brodsworth (Yorkshire)\n\nParish registers, 1538-1902 Church of England. Parish Church of Brodsworth (Yorkshire)\n\nClay Cross, Derbyshire; St Bartholomews Church\n\nSt Bartholomew's Church was built in 1851 as a chapel of ease to North Wingfield. A separate parish was formed in 1852, including the hamlet and townships of Danesmoor, Stretton, Woodthorpe, and parts of Handley & Woolley Moor. Chapels were later built at Danesmoor (1883), Handley (1870) and Stretton (1899 now closed). The church had a 70ft high Broach spire added in 1857. In 1879 the churchyard of St Bartholomew's was closed for burials and the Clay Cross Cemetery on Bennett's Lane (now Cemetery Road) was officially consecrated on 14 June 1879. The DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1851-1939; Marriages 1852-1936; Burials 1851-1959. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Chesterfield.\n\nClay Cross, Derbyshire; Cemetery, Cemetery Rd\n\nThe Clay Cross Cemetery on Bennett's Lane (now Cemetery Road) was officially consecrated on 14 June 1879.\n\nCrich, Derbyshire; St Mary's Church\n\nThe Parish of Crich includes the hamlets of Fritchley, Bull Bridge, Wheatcroft and Watstandwell. It also included Tansley until 1840, Wessington until 1859 and Holloway until 1901.\n\nThe Church in Crich is dedicated to St Mary's. It has an open door policy, inviting visitors during most daylight hours to wander into the church, so with a little luck, is easy to visit at any time.\n\nEnter through the door (on the south) and walk straight ahead, turn right & progress to the far end, where you will be in the sanctuary.\n\nOn the left side (north) of the sanctuary there is an altar tomb of significant interest to BRAILSFORD researchers. It is the tomb of John CLAY (1560 - 1632), his two wives Mary CALTON ( - 1583) & Margaret DE FERRERS, and their five children.\n\nMary CALTON was the daughter of William CALTON Esq, \"Chief Cock Matcher and Servant of the Hawkes\" to Henry VIII. Mary had been previously married to CHARNELL of Swarkestone, LEIC. They had three daughters and two sons prior to her decease.\n\nMargaret DE FERRERS was previously married to German POLE (d 1588), and upon her decease she was entombed with her first husband, German POLE, also in the Crich Church. A plaque showing both German and Margaret dressed in Tudor gowns and ruffs which was originally a part of their tomb, is now fixed to the north wall of the sanctuary at the east end, on the wall directly beside the CLAY tomb.\n\n(right)\n\nTomb for CLAY family\n\nin St Mary's Church, Crich\n\nThere is an inscription on the slab at the top which is almost defaced. The name CLAY is legible in several places as well as a few words to each side of the slab. Most of the words in the center have been worn away. Fortunately, a historian Reynolds transcribed the inscription on the tomb some time ago as follows; the bold words are all that can be made out at the time of my visit in Jun 2005: Heare lieth John Claye, Gentleman and Mary whom he first did wive\n\nWith her he lived near eight years space, in which God gave them children five\n\nDaughter of William Caulton Esq. who was unto that King of fame\n\nHenre the eighth Chief Cock Matcher and servent of his Hawkes by name\n\nAnd as shee had a former match, Charnell of Swarkestone in Leicestershire\n\nSo shee deceast, this Claye did take the widow of German Pole Esquire\n\nDaughter of Edward who was son to Sir J. Ferrers of Tamworth Knight\n\nShee lies entombed in this Church with her by whom he first was plight\n\nAnd now this Claye is closed in Claye the fairest flesh doth fade like grass\n\nHee had one sister who unto Stuffyn of Shirebrook married was\n\nFor[t] death doth give an end to all and now this Claye shall rest therein\n\nAll claye to claye shall come at last by death the due reward of sinne\n\nThou death - his death, Thy deathe is hee whose soul doth rest with Christ for aye\n\nThe sting of deathe can no one flee the greatest Monarchs are but claye as well as the following arms...\n\nThere are three shields.\n\nThe middle one is Parti per pale Baron, and two femees per fesse.\n\n1st, Clay. Argent, a chevron engrailed, between three trefoils, Sable, impaling two coats per fesse, being his two wives;\n\n1st, in chief, Calton, Or, a saltier, engrailed, between four cross crosslets, Sable; 2nd, in base, Ferrers, vaire, Or and Gules.\n\nOn the right hand and left of this shield there are two single shields, one of Calton, and the other of Ferrers. The side and end presented to view have five kneeling figures, being children of the above Clay; over each is inscribed their names, 1st, Susannah; 2nd, Mary; 3rd, Penelope, nupta erat Thomas Brailsford, of Senor; and on the end William and Theophilus. Also of nearby interest is a Manor house next to the Northwest corner of the church built by John CLAY. The DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1601-1926; Marriages 1600-1940; Marriage Banns 1643, 1754-1807, 1823-1853, 1882-1903; Burials 1600-1991. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Belper.\n\nDarley, Derbyshire; St Helen's Church\n\nThe Parish of Darley is about 4 miles NW of Matlock on the A6. The parish originally included the townships of Wensley and Snitterton, which were both included within the new parish of South Darley in 1845. It also included the hamlet of Little Rowsley which was transferred to the new Rowsley Parish in 1860. At the time of the Domesday Servey of 1086, it was listed as having a church and a priest. St Helen's Church is located in Darley Dale and dates from the 12th century and was restored in 1877. Some sepulchral slabs in the church porch and others in the external walls are said to date from the 9th century. There is a large Yew tree in the churchyard believed to be about 2000 years old. The DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1569-1908; Marriages 1541-1934; Marriage Banns 1753-1791, 1823-1844, 1877-1900; Burials 1539-1943. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Bakewell.\n\nEast Barkwith, Lincolnshire; St Mary's Church\n\nThe Parish of East Barkwith is 14 miles northeast of Lincoln, and covers about 1,000 acres. The parish is well known for fertile soil, and \"a fine chalk marl\", used as manure.\n\nEast Barkwith village is situated on the road from Lincoln to Louth (now the A157). St Mary's Church is on Torrington Lane. It was built in the later style of English architecture, with an embattled tower and an ancient font dating from the fourteenth century. The chancel and part of the nave were partially rebuilt in 1846, and further restored in 1868-69. Thomas BRAILSFORD (1787-1866), his first wife Anne SHEPLEY (1788-1837) of Barkwith House Lincolnshire and three of their children who died in infancy, were interred in the Vault below the Alter at St Mary's Church. A stone tablet memorial exists inside the church. There is also a stained glass window given in memory of Thomas and Anne by their two youngest children William & Emma Dorothea in 1868. Parish Registers held at the Lincolnshire Archives cover Baptisms 1695-1943, Marriages 1695-1981, and Burials 1695-1983. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Horncastle.\n\nFinningley, Yorkshire; Holy Trinity & St Oswald's Church\n\nFrom \"White's Directory\", 1852: The church is a neat edifice, dedicated to St Oswald, and was repaired and ornamented with a handsome stained glass window about 20 years ago. The rectory, valued in the King's books at ï¿½13 4s 9d, now at ï¿½600, is in the incumbency of the Rev. Gervas Harvey Woodhouse M.A., who resides at the rectory house, most of which was rebuilt in 1844. John Harvey Esq. is the patron, and also owner of most of the township, and lord of the manor, which was formerly the property of the Frobisher family. A small Wesleyan chapel was erected in the village in 1838. Only the one known Brailsford family ever lived at Finningley. James & Hannah arrived ca 1777 as newly-weds and christened at least three children there before 1795. James and his two wives were buried there 1784-1835.\n\nHoly Trinity & St Oswald's Church\n\nThe Brailsford MI is just to the left of this entrance path.\n\nAerial photo\n\nRecords on IGI include:\n\nBishop's transcripts for Finningley, 1627-1852\n\nParish registers, 1720-1889 Also available from Doncaster and District Family History Society:\n\nSt. Oswalds' Church, Finningley (Doncaster), monumental inscriptions\n\nSt. Oswalds' Church, Finningley, Burial index, 1701-1901\n\nHeath, Derbyshire; Old Church\n\nDoes anyone know the name of this old church or have any photos? It is now in ruins, but was built in the 12th century. There were a number of BRAILSFORD burials here. Can you provide exact MI transcriptions?\n\nHeath, Derbyshire; All Saints Church\n\nThe parish of Heath includes Holmewood transferred from the parish of North Wingfield in 1954. This church was built in 1852. It contains some coffin slabs which were moved from the ruins of the old church, only 1/4 of a mile away.

Lord Derby also formed a private menagerie at Knowsley which was the largest zoo outside London Zoo, now known as Knowsley Safari Park.\n\nEdward LEAR visited Knowsley from 1832 to 1837 and drew many of the animals and birds in the menagerie for Lord Derby, leading to the identification of some previously undocumented species. It was during this time at Knowsley that LEAR wrote the Owl & the Pussycat to entertain the Earl's grandchildren. He almost certainly knew Richard and his family, due to Richard's position as Game Keeper & dog trainer.\n\nKnowsley St Mary's Church\n\nTaken from the new cemetery.\n\nMansfield, Nottinghamshire; Mansfield Churches\n\nThe original Parish Church in Mansfield was dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, but is now known as St Peters Church. It was built over 800 years ago. In 1304 it was partly burnt down and rebuilt soon afterward. In current day it comprises of a nave with clerestory, north and south aisles and north and south porches. The tower is topped by a small spire. Registers date from 1559, but according to The History of Mansfield by W Horner Groves, \"... the ornamental flourishes, together with the curious contractions, render it in some places most difficult to decipher. In other places, the writing is almost illegible by the action of a damp atmosphere; and again, in others the handwriting is very bad...\" Marriage registers 1559-1812 and 1813-1837 were transcribed by Phillimores. After 1858, few burials were recorded due to the opening of Mansfield Cemetery.\n\nIn 1800 the Memorial Inscriptions visible in the churchyard at that time were transcribed by W Harrod. There were no BRAILSFORDs recorded in this listing.\n\nSt John's Church was built in 1855/6. It is comprised of a nave, chancel and two side aisles, plus a tower and spire and was consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln on 29 July 1856. Registers date from 1857.\n\nIn 1870 a mission church was opened on Stockwell Gate. This area became St Mark's parish in 1889, and a new church was built to serve the parish in 1896. Registers date from 1897\n\nSt Lawrence's mission church in Quarry Lane was replaced in 1908 by a stone built church.\n\nSt Phillip's Roman Catholic Church is in Ratcliffe Gate. Registers date from 1877 for baptisms and 1879 for marriages & burials.\n\nThere were also a number of non-conformist Churches in Mansfield.\n\nMansfield, Nottinghamshire; Mansfield Cemetery\n\nThe Mansfield Cemetery is on Nottingham Rd about one mile from Mansfield. Originally 10 acres in 1857, it grew a further 10 acres in 1898. There are two mortuary chapels on the grounds.\n\nRecords for Mansfield Cemetery are held at the Crematorium Office. Staff have been extremely helpful in providing details of BRAILSFORD burials from a list of burials registered in Mansfield. As that list was taken from incomplete transcriptions of the index at the time, it is, however, an incomplete listing, and may be added to in the future.\n\nThe crematorium in Mansfield was opened in the 1960s.\n\nNorth Wingfield, Derbyshire; St Lawrence's Church\n\nViews of North Wingfield St Lawrence's Church\n\nSt Lawrence's Church is near the intersection of the A6175 and Church Lane in North Wingfield. It is very close to Clay Cross and would have been the local church for the BRAILSFORDs at Coney Green.\n\nMemorial inside St Lawrence's Church View larger image Photo courtesy of Joy Hungerford\n\nOf particular interest to Brailsford researchers is the unusual fact that John BRAILSFORD & his wife Mary of Coneygreen farm were interred inside the church. A prominent wall plaque (shown right) reads as follows: \"At the foot of this lyeth interr'd the body of Mary thw wife of John Brailsford late of Conygreen who departed this life Septembr 22d 1714. Anno Aetatis 72.\" \"At the foot of this lyeth Interr'd the body of John Brailsford late of Conygreen who departed this life July ye 27th 1714. Anno Aetatis 82.\"\n\nAccording to the Domesday Survey of 1086 North Wingfield had a church at that time, however, no sign of that building now exists. The archway in the north aisle of St Lawrence's Church dates from original construction in the 12th century. During the 14th century, it is believed the North Chapel was built, an archway between the chapel and the chancel was constructed, a stained glass east window was installed, and a new roof was built.\n\nBy 1401 the Church had become the Church of St Helen. In the 15th century the church was rebuilt, and the tower constructed. It was not until after 1644 that the Church became St Lawrence Church once again.\n\nIn 1705 St Lawrence's Church was endowed with a trust of approximately ï¿½46 a year by Thomas BRAILSFORD for the upkeep of the building. By 1823 the church was in a state of disrepair, and it became evident that the trust had been mismanaged and no money was available from it. Later that century, money was found for re-building much of the church.\n\nParish Registers were kept in North Wingfield from 1567, and covered the areas of North Wingfield, Clay Lane, Pilsley, Stretton, Tupton, & Woodthorp.\n\nThe DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1567-1914; Marriages 1567-1942; Marriage Banns 1823-1867, 1875-1900; Burials 1567-1959.

Inscription to Arthur E. and Charlotte Brailsford, n.d., on hymn board, Nave.\n\nThis board refers to Arthur Edwin Brailsford (1884-1967) and his wife Charlotte Wilson (1884-1963). They were both buried at Stonefall Cemetery, Harrogate, North Yorkshire. They were known to have lived in Belper until at least 1916.\n\nSkegby, Nottinghamshire; St Andrew's Church\n\nSkegby St Andrew's Church\n\nSt Andrew's Church in Skegby was originally built in the 12th century, as a chapel of ease to the parish of Mansfield. It was completely restored in 1870, and little evidence of the original Norman structure now remains.\n\nFrom The Story Of Skegby And Stanton Hill by W Clay-Dove\n\nOf the early church here nothing is now known, only a fragment of Norman masonry remaining at the base of the tower, the whole edifice undergoing a complete rebuilding during the reign of Henry III, the north aisle added and new windows inserted. Of this work only three bays of the nave arcade are left, the tower was inserted over a bay of the west arcade from which we may assume that up to then the church had been towerless.\n\nParish registers date from 1569. The Burial Register begins in 1813. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Mansfield.\n\nSouth Darley, Derbyshire; St Mary's Church\n\nSouth Darley was originally part of Darley Dale parish, about 4 miles NW of Matlock on the A6. It became a parish in its own right in 1840, with the building of the St Mary's church in the middle of the parish, servicing the villages or hamlets of Cross Green, Darley Bridge, Oker, Snitterton and Wensley. The church is in the Norman style with a nave, chancel and tower. The DRO has microfilm for: Baptisms 1845-1941; Marriages 1847-1969; Marriage Banns 1846-1924; Burials 1846-1959. Registrations of births, marriages & deaths after 1837 are in the registration district of Bakewell.\n\nStaveley, Derbyshire; St John The Baptist Church\n\nStaveley is 4 miles NE of Chesterfield. The parish includes hamlets of Netherthorpe, Inkersall, Mastin Moor, Norbriggs, Poolsbrook and Woodthorpe. Chapels of ease or mission churches opened at Woodthorpe (1632), Poolsbrook (1905), Mastin Moor (1914) and Inkersall (1958).\n\nAt the time of the Domesday Survey, Staveley had a church and a priest. Little of this original church now exists. The Parish Church of St John The Baptist in Staveley consists of nave, chancel, north and south aisles, south porch, and tower at the west end. It dates from the 13th century. Registers date from as early as 1558.\n\nExtract from History of Derbyshire by David Peter Davies\n\nParishes of Derbyshire in 1811\n\nSTAVELY\n\nA parish 'containing the chapelry of Barlow, and the hamlets of Netherthorp, Woodthorp, and three of the name of Hanly, containing altogether about 408 houses.

In 1492 the tower was built in the perpendicular style but the church was practically re-built in 1729 (with a north side aisle added). In 1878 an acre of land was donated to the churchyard by St Thomas's Hospital in London, and in 1887 the nave was rebuilt and the aisle enlarged. In 1910 fire destroyed the chancel, which was rebuilt with a south aisle and organ chamber. The registers date from 1627 and are deposited with the County Record Office.\n\nThere is also a Tibshelf Methodist Chapel and Methodist Church War Memorial.
