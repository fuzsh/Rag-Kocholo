He was endowed with excep¬ tional gifts as a business executive and administrator, and consequently his affairs took on a broad and varied scope not only in his immediate section, but in other states as well. He was not less diligent in the perform¬ ance of good citizenship. Mr. Suydam was born in Queens, Long Island, August to, 1865, and represented one of the old and honored family names, being a son of Isaac and Phoebe (Ryder) Suydam. The Ryder family came from Holland and comprises some of the original settlements in Western Long Island. The grandfather of Bernardus Suydam was Hendrick Suydam. Isaac Suydam moved to Queens, Long Island, in 1850, and was prominent as an elder in the Dutch Reformed Church. He developed a fine rural estate in Queens, Long Island. His wife, Phoebe Ryder, was a daughter of Lawrence Ryder, of the Flatlands district of Brooklyn. Bernardus Suydam was one of a family of ten chil¬ dren. He was educated in the public schools of Queens, and at the age of fifteen completed a course in Brown’s Business College of Brooklyn. For a year and a half he was employed in a forwarding house of New York City, also had some experience in the cigar business, and for about five or six years was associated with the kid glove industry, the great manufacturing concern of Jacob Adler & Company, of New York. Mr. Suydam was then attracted to some industrial development in Southwestern Louisiana, becoming inter¬ ested in the Lake Charles Rice Milling Company at Lake Charles, and gave practically all his time for three years to the development of this business and the promotion of the rice industry in general. He retained a financial interest in this portion of the South until the time of his death. After his return North, Mr. Suydam located in Elm~- hurst, and in 189S became manager of the real estate business of the Cord-Meyer Company in that village. He also became treasurer and manager of the Citizens Water Supply Company; a director of the Bank of Jamaica; and somewhat later he bought the small coal yard at Elmhurst. This coal business he developed into extensive proportions, enlarging it until, eventually, under the name of the Elmhurst Coal Company, it oper¬ ated four coal pockets, one in Elmhurst, one in Glen¬ dale, one in Metropolitan, and finally one at Forest Hills. Mr. Suydam was active in all these various enter¬ prises practically to the end of his life, which occurred December 12, 1919. He had always given generously of his time and means to community affairs. During the World War much of his time was taken up with his duties in connection with the sale of Liberty Bonds, and the raising of funds for the Red Cross. For ten years he was a member of the New York City Board of Education, was one of the directors of the Flushing Hospital; was a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and for a number of years was prominent in the New York National Guard, joining it in 1886 on reaching his majority. He became a corporal in 1889, a sergeant in 1S92, and in that year was elected secretary of the Veteran’s Association of the city guard, for many years he was deeply interested in the Twenty-third Reg¬ iment Armory at Brooklyn. As a boy he was reared in the Dutch Reformed Church of Queens and later became an active member and elder of the church of that de¬ nomination in Elmhurst. He was affiliated with Lex¬ ington Lodge, No. 310, Free and Accepted Masons, filling all the chairs, and also belonged to the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks; was a member of the Oakland Golf Club, of Bayside, and the Democratic Club of New York. Bernardus Suydam married, April 19, 1893, Elizabeth Grace Covert, their marriage being celebrated in St. George’s Episcopal Church in Brooklyn. Mr. Suydam is survived by Mrs. Suydam, whose home is on Whitney Avenue, in Elmhurst. He has one son, Bernardus Suy- darn, Jr., born July 10, 1900. JOHN TITUS VAN DE WATER— One of the most interesting figures in the Flushing of a day now gone by was John Titus Van De Water, who lived to the great age of ninety-four years, the spring of 1924 seeing his passing. A man of large benevolence of spirit and beautiful character, Mr. Van De Water devoted his entire lifetime to benevolent, kindly\" activities, his voca¬ tion along the lines of merchandising and real estate, while his public service linked his name with many branches of advance for many years. In no small degree Mr. Van TJe Water was a philosopher, for he accepted life as it was given him, while at the same time, out of the greatness of his soul and from the high level of his viewpoint, he reached out to the world and became the friend of all. Always a student of affairs and conditions and always logical in his conclu¬ sions, Mr. Van De Water was acknowledged as one of the worthy and beneficent spirits of his time, while these excellent and admirable qualities endured throughout the years and indeed until the end. It is of especial interest to note that the aged and still charming wife of this nonegenarian survives him at the age of ninety-two years in 1924. This interesting and universally honored couple have been regarded by their numberless friends in this section for many years as remarkable examples of beautiful and blest longevity. The Van De Water family is one of the oldest and most distinguished of Holland, and in every generation, on both sides the Atlantic, the name has stood for worthy- effort and lofty achievement. Mr. Van De Water was directly descended from Jacobus Van De Water, who was burgomaster of New Amsterdam in 1632. Jacobus Van De Water married Angeltie Jurians, and the line descends through Benjamin and Angeltie (Harmense) Van De Water; their son, Peter Van De Water and his wife Hannah (Schuyler) Van De Water; and their son, John Van De Water and his wife Phoebe (Titus) Van De Water, who were the parents of Silas Titus Van De Water, who married Martha Travis, and they were the parents of John Titus Van De Water, whose name en¬ titles this review. Jacobus Van De Water, the pioneer in America, was one of three brothers, who came to the United States in that early day, he settling in New York City, one going to New Jersey and the other L, I.— VII— 1 . 2 LONG ISLAND— BOROUGHS AND COUNTIES pressing on up the Hudson River and settling in other sections of that State. John Titus Van De Water was born at South Oyster Bay, August 13, 1829, and died at his home in Flushing, April 6, 1924. His education was received in his native community and in Flushing, where his father for some years owned a farm. The death of his father occurring when the young lad was about sixteen years of age, he was thrown upon his own resources and at once entered the business world. He secured a position as clerk in a store in Brooklyn, and from the first his success was definitely marked. He gave constructive thought and tireless energy to the responsibilities placed in his hands, and his faithfulness to duty gave him the immediate respect and confidence of those with whom he was iden¬ tified as an assistant, also with the purchasing public. Gifted with that spirit which is satisfied only in inde¬ pendent effort, Mr. Van De Water early established his own store in Flushing, going forward along the lines of general merchandising and winning a very considerable measure of success. During these years he gained not only valuable experience in business affairs, but an inti¬ mate appreciation of the interests and problems of others, which throughout his lifetime formed an import¬ ant factor in his success. As Mr. Van De Water changed the course of his ac¬ tivities and entered the real estate field, and this knowl¬ edge of men and personal interest in the people with whom he dealt gave him more than a superficial under¬ standing of the circumstances of his clients. This placed him in a position where he encouraged them to undertake only such a scale of living as they were able to maintain, and in this fact was perhaps the secret of his success. His customers were satisfied not only with their purchases, but with the fact that they were able to meet the terms of purchase and fulfill their obliga¬ tions at every point. Thus Mr. V an De Water’s suc¬ cess in the real estate field was not a spectacular achievement, fading away in mediocrity as is too often the case. It was rather a substantial superstructure on a solid foundation and bore a definite and permanent significance to the welfare and happiness of the people. In turn, also, his work reflected large prosperity upon the community and the general section in which he was active, and his entire career formed a record of com¬ mendable and admirable achievement. Retiring from business affairs at the age of seventy years, Mr. Van De Water devoted the later decades of his life to those interests for which a busy career leaves scant opportunity. Civic affairs were always of the deepest interest to him and he was for years a trustee of the Board of Education, serving on the committee of sites when the first Flushing high school was built. This was the first high school built on Long Island. He was a very active member of the old blushing Asso¬ ciation, and was a charter member of the United Char¬ ities. His worth and public spirit led to his being sought in many branches of community endeavor, and as a lifelong Republican he was a leader in party affairs and an influential figure in party councils. He never, however, accepted office, although always doing much to promote local progress and interest. He was long a member of Cornucopia Lodge, No. 563, Free and Accepted Masons, of Flushing; a member of the Flush¬ ing Historical Society, also St. George’s Brotherhood. Mr. Van De Water’s gracious and lovely wife shared all his charitable and benevolent interests, and the spirit oi this old-young couple was well expressed in an inter¬ view quoted by a local daily in noticing the death of this aged man : Mr. and Mrs. Van De Water were married nearly seventy-live years ago, on July 3, 1S50. When they were asked a year or so ago for the secret of their longevity they both declared it lay in following the simple life. “Our motto has always been,\" said Mr. Van De Water, “ ‘Do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.’ *' His wife added: \"We all understand our lives as we live them. We must ac¬ cept what comes. We cannot understand young peo¬ ple’s lives to-day. Many of their ways that are dif¬ ferent from ours have their advantages. The world is all tight if we can adapt ourselves to it.” In May, 1910, Mr. Van De Water read a paper before the Flushing Historical Society recalling his recollec¬ tions of early times in this community, when he first became a resident of Flushing, and this was published under the title of “Recollections of Flushing in the Forties.” Outlining in brief the general layout of the section, enumerating many of its business enterprises and roughly indicating the map at that time, Mr. Van De Water went on to say in part : We are now again at the corner of the Turnpike where the old Tavern still stands as an old landmark, about the same (with few exceptions) as I saw it first in the fall of 1840, — when in front of the Tavern, rep¬ resenting the campaign of Harrison and Tyler, was a barrel of hard cider with a diminutive log cabin on the top of the barrel. This campaign I remember well. This tavern was kept by Charles P. Lowerre. who was Town Clerk for many years and whose descend¬ ants still live in Flushing. At this tavern the voters of the whole Town of Flushing assembled for the spring and fall elections, days of great excitement. The mode of voting then was very different from what we are accustomed to now. It was not unusual to see a man attempting to vote and a politician grab his ticket and place another in his hand, — the kind that suited the politician. *«**••••**« In these early days the \"Flushing Journal'’ was first published by Charles R. Lincoln as owner and editor. The population then did not exceed two thousand. Comparatively few streets were laid out and the farms were not far from the centre of the village. 1 remem¬ ber as a boy going across the meadows with my father to see his old friends, Platt Stratton and Samuel Nichols, both of whom owned and lived on farms in what is now College Point. This section, when laid out. was called Flammersburg, then it was changed to Strattonport, then to College Point. I remember, in crossing the meadows, the tide-water was over the road and traveling was difficult. Our transportation facilities to and from the city were then very simple, — stage in winter and boat in summer, — and the fare was much less than it is now by rail. It is hard to realize the many changes that have taken place in our \"village” — they have come so grad¬ ually: but my memory goes back to when we had no banks, no railroads, no telegraph, no gas, no tele¬ phones, no trolleys, no macadamized street, no Oak¬ land water, — only pumps and cisterns, — no paid fire companies, no policemen, no, — not even an automo¬ bile! Yet, we were happy and knew our neighbors as we do not know them now, and loved the small con¬ servative Flushing which we felt was in very truth our own. At the age of ninety-three years Mr. Van De Water made certain additions to this record of early times, which were included in the above-mentioned publication and of these additions the following may perhaps be of interest : \\ ■ \\ LONG ISLAND— BOROUGHS AND COUNTIES 3 At the time of which I am ■writing' Sanford Avenue was not laid out. It was simply a country road lead¬ ing from the Jamaica Road in the village out to Fresh Meadow and Rocky Hill, divided now into San¬ ford Avenue, Parsons Avenue, Queens Avenue and Fresh Meadow Road. The Parsons Estate owned the land extending from the old High School ( P. S. 20) on this road out to what is now known as Murray Hill. On the part of this country road which is now known as Parsons was situated the farm of Benjamin Wil- lets. Surveyor of the Town of Flushing. I remember¬ ing his offering to sell this farm of forty-five acres to mv father for $4,500. A few years later he sold it at this price and moved to Sullivan County. He thought he had received a very good price for his farm, but not many years ago the same farm was sold for $05,000 and became Ingleside. $*«******** Beyond this and extending to the Rocky Hill Road was the large farm of William Titus. In naming these properties of nearly eighty years ago I am forcibly reminded of how comparatively few of the owners’ descendants now occupy the old landmarks, — and how few old landmarks there are left to occupy. Time has changed the old Flushing very much, but I wonder if we were not then as con¬ tented as we are now. ***♦**••**• We loved our village, our churches and our neigh¬ bors and found our lives cast in a very happy place,— a place and time I find it very pleasant to look back .upon. John Titus Van De Water married, July 3, 1850, in St. George’s Church of Flushing, Ellen Bernetta Fowler, daughter of John Burtis and Abbie (Doughty) Fowler, both these names also representing old Long Island families. Mrs. Van De Water was born February 26, 1833, and is thus, in 1924, in the ninety-second year of her age. She is still in excellent health and in full possession of her faculties. She has been a resident of Long Island since the age of three months, and the acquaintance of her honored husband dates back to the age of three years. Of the nine children of tiiis inter¬ esting couple three died in infancy, Charles Livingston died in February, 1919, and John Carpenter died Decem¬ ber 1, 1912. The surviving children are: Rev. Dr. George Roe, an Episcopal minister, who is prominent in New York City; Martha E., wife of Elijah P. Rapelye, a jeweler of New York City; Eilen Bernetta; and Clara Burtis, wife of Benjamin H. Thorp, of Flushing. JUDGE JOHN R. DAVIES— Forest Hills Gardens is the model home community on Long Island, originated and constructed by the Russell Sage Foundation, and its completeness and transit proximity to Manhattan have attracted a class of people of the highest type intellec¬ tually. Many of those attracted can spend only part of the year there, but they all come back, especially for its golf and tennis, and among these is Municipal Court Judge John R. Davies, of Manhattan, who enjoys his summers there. The judge is of that type that, no matter where he happens to stop, shows an interest in his surroundings, and then takes a hand in helping to improve them. During his twelve years’ summer resi¬ dence at Sea Bright, New Jersey, he led in the activ¬ ities there, and recently has been doing the same at Forest Hills Gardens. Although his life and work are in Manhattan, because of his work in administering the housing laws of the State, he has interestedly watched the houses grow in Queens, and when the Sage Foundation, in 1922, stepped out of the life and management of Forest Hills Gardens, he was one of the organizers and a director of the Gardens Corporation, which is the body that constitutes the unique self-governing community within the city of New York that owns and operates and maintains its streets, sewers, parks, etc., and is doing it satisfactorily and successfully. The judge is an expert administrator of public af¬ fairs, as since his admission to the bar in 1900, he, in 1903, was elected to the Board of Aldermen from Wash¬ ington Heights, and reelected in 1905; during 1906 and 1907, he served as chairman of the Finance Committee, and as one of the five Sinking Fund Commissioners of New York City, sitting frequently on the Board of Esti¬ mate, he took 2 deep interest in city planning and budget preparation, and caused to be instituted the segregated budget and the annual corporate stock budget, which in its first two years cut down the city expenses by over nineteen million dollars. His judicial career in the Municipal Court since 1908 has demonstrated how tact and courtesy, combined with legal ability, can effectively lessen the “law’s delays,” and his publicly known admin¬ istration of the housing laws since 1920 has saved many a home and thwarted many a would-be profiteer. Judge John R. Davies was born in New York City in 1879, attended the public schools, City College, Colum¬ bia University, and the New York Law School, where he received the degrees of LL. D. and LL. M. He is a member of the various Bar Associations, Republican Clubs, church and charitable organizations, and the 7th Regiment Veterans, and is president of St. David’s Society of New York. He gets his outdoor sport as a member of the Pomonok Country Club. Judge Davies married, in 1905, Ruby C. Hardy, a descendent of Lord Hardy, who was one of the Colonial governors of New York, and they have two children, a daughter, Ruth Elizabeth, who is attending Barnard Col¬ lege, and a son, Richard Arthur, a pupil at Kew Forest School. DR. FRANKLIN H. BOOTH— A medical prac¬ titioner who can boast of a good general education at one of the old universities and has obtained his profes¬ sional degree at one of the leading medical schools with properly equipped laboratories, a teaching staff of lead¬ ing surgeons and physicians, and every other conceiv¬ able help for the attainment of the highest possible standard of medical education, starts his career with a decided advantage as compared to the less fortunate of his professional brethren, who, no matter how effi¬ cient and experienced they become in later life as med¬ ical practitioners, can never make up for certain defi¬ ciencies and shortcomings of their early manhood and scholastic period. These valuable qualifications are possessed by Dr. Franklin H. Booth, of Broadway, Elmhurst, who is one of the busiest and most respected medical practitioners of that district. Dr. Booth is a native of Newtown, New York, where he was bom in November, 1876, a son of Franklin Booth, a physician of Newtown, now Elmhurst, Long Island, and Lucy F. (Newcomb) Booth, both deceased. Having received his education in private schools of New York, and Andover, Massachu¬ setts, he entered Yale University from where he grad¬ uated in 1898, with the degree Bachelor of Arts, and . . . 4 LONG ISLAND— BOROUGHS AND COUNTIES then entered the medical department of Columbia Uni¬ versity, New York, the famous College of Physicians and Surgeons, which he left in 1902 with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Dr. Booth’s father who had been a practicing physician at Elmhurst for a number of years, died in 1900 and was succeeded by Dr. Eranklin H. Booth, who took over his father’s office and genera! practice, which he has conducted up to the present time to the satisfaction of his large circle of patients. Dur¬ ing the World War he rendered valuable service to his country, having been examining physician on the local draft board, and served as major in the Fourteenth New York Guard. He is a member of the Queens County Medical Association and associate physician of Flushing Hospital, an alumnus of Yale University, also a member of the Yale Club of New York City. In pol¬ itics Dr. Booth is an Independent and in religion a member of the Dutch Reformed Church. In April, 1917, Dr. Booth married at Elmhurst, Sarah Garretson, a daughter of George and Cordelia (Hicks) Garretson. Dr. and Mrs. Booth are the parents of two daughters and one son: Frances Elizabeth, Lucy Pris¬ cilla, and Franklin Garretson. JAMES ALBERT DAYTON— Nearly a quarter of a century in association with many of the most import¬ ant legal interests in New York City, and of Long Island, has placed the name of James Albert Dayton, to the fore among attorneys in this part of the State, and in particular in the Queens County attorneyship group whereof he holds the office of chief assistant of the district attorney. His practice was established under the auspices of a careful training, and its development has been along those lines of energy and excellence that have invariably distinguished his legal dealings and made way for his present success and his high standing in his profession. Mr. Dayton has directed in a most capable way the offices he has held with the county bar and other institutions. He is a son of John Dayton, a builder and contractor, born in Brooklyn, June, 1853; and of Elizabeth Leeds, born in Gloucester, New Jersey. James Albert Dayton was born in Brooklyn, August 9, 187S, and his preliminary education was received in Public School No. 18, high school of Brooklyn, and in the Preparatory School. Fie made preparation for his life work at the law department of New York Univer¬ sity, and was graduated with the class of 1900, receiv¬ ing his degree of Bachelor of Laws; the next year, 1901, he was admitted to practice at the bar. Mr. Dayton began his law activities in New York City, as a member of the firm of Dayton and Bailey, with headquarters at No. 55 John Street. His abilities received the recog¬ nition due them, and during the years 1906, 1907, and 1908, after having removed to Bayside, he held the office of deputy assistant district attorney; and in 1914, 1915, and 1916, he was commissioner of public works. He is the present chief assistant to the District Attorney of Queens County. Mr. Dayton is also vice-president and treasurer of the Livingston Mines Company. He supports the principles of the Republican party by his. vote, but has not held political office. His fraternal affiliations are with Cornucopia Lodge, No. 563, Free and Accepted Masons; Queensbo rough Lodge, No. 878, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. He is a former president of the Queens County Bar Associa¬ tion; a member of the board of trustees of the Queens Borough Public Library Association; the Bayside Yacht Club; and the Belport Golf Club. He is a communi¬ cant of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Mr. Dayton married, at St. Paul, Minnesota, October 26, 1909, Majel Bishop Wade, who was born at St. Paul, October 23, 1886, a daughter of Judson Wade, who was born in New York State, and of Mary (Axtell) Wade, a native of Michigan, and they are the parents of: Cynthia Elizabeth, born at Bayside, February 8, 1911; and of Majel Bishop, born at Bayside, March 6, 1016. JOHN A. HODGE — To-day the district manager of the Illinois Glass Company, in charge of the sales in Greater New York City and State, and the surrounding States, John A. Hodge has had an interesting career, having worked up in this line of industry from the very bottom of the ladder, his first position in the business world having been with this concern in the factory, in the capacity of an apprentice in the grinding room. His progress, step by step, and his success, until he stands to-day in the position of executive of a great manufac¬ turing concern, are marked by industry, and a keen interest in his work, twin qualities that, wrelded together, create a key to open that magic door, over whose threshold he has passed. John A. Hodge was born July 20, 1S78, in Golconda, Illinois, son of Josiah P. and May (Clanahan) Hodge. His father was a native of Golconda, and was a son 01 Dr. John Hodge; he was an attorney, and practiced law- in Pope County, Madison County, and in Pana, Illinois, and became a judge in Pana, and served in this capacity for a number of years prior to his death, April 1, 1903. He was ait attendant of the Presbyterian Church. His wife, Mrs. Mary (Clanahan) Hodge, and the mother of John A. Hodge, is living (1924) in Cincinnati, Ohio. John A. Flodge attended the public schools of Gol¬ conda, and started to work in the factory- of the Illinois Glass Company, at an early age. Fie began in the grinding room, and for several years worked there and in the factory-, packing rooms, etc., learning thoroughly the production end of the bottle business. That was followed by his promotion to receiving clerk, anu after a few- months, he left to go into the army of the United States during the Spanish-American War. He enlisted as a volunteer and served in the Regular Army until he received his honorable discharge in 1899. Fie then went to Indianapolis for one year and worked for Daniel Stewart, wholesale druggist. He returned to the Illi¬ nois Glass Company, being given a clerkship in their branch office at St. Louis. He remained here for one year and w-as then sent on the road as a traveling sales¬ man, covering the States of Illinois, Iowa, South Dakota. Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Indiana. He trav¬ eled for two years, and was then sent by the firm to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he opened a branch office for the company-, remaining in Cincinnati from 1903 to 1910. At the end of this time, the firm sent him as their Southwestern representative to Dallas, Texas, and here he handled the sales for the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, remaining in this capacity from 19:0 to ' ■■ ■ . •**»*- • ***** CffelL.J ; . v«i>w L «»• ik-* ttfcdBtiu «teu.^i. iiiHWiiTiiliiirttiUt* Mxfc'ii LONG ISLAND— BOROUGHS AND COUNTIES 5 1915. On completing his organization here, he was sent to Philadelphia, and opened a branch office for the firm, handling the sales of Southeastern Pennsylvania, and the States of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, remain¬ ing in this connection until July I, 1920, when he went to New York, taking charge of the office here as district manager in charge of the sales in Greater New York, Eastern New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut. This position he holds at tire present time, and the firm has no more able man, nor one who is more thoroughly conversant with their aims and their needs. He has risen through his powers of initiative, his industry, his gift of organization, and his executive ability. He is active in the civic life of his community, rendering service whenever a movement for betterment of condi¬ tions tends towards the welfare of the people. John A. Hodge married, March 25, 1903, at Burling¬ ton, Iowa, Yashti Bell, daughter of Omar H. and Vashti (Willits) Bell, her father being county auditor of Des Moines County, Iowa. Mrs. Vashti (Willits) Bell passed away in Dallas, Texas, January 1, 1924. Mrs. Pledge descends from the famous Bells of Ohio and Virginia, the first ancestor coming from Scotland in 1737. Mr. and Mrs. Hodge have one daughter, Vashti Bell Hodge, born in Dallas, Texas, February 29, 1913. DAVID G. MORRISON— For many years estab¬ lished on' Long Island, as one of the most substantial business men in that part of the State, an expert in the stone-cutting and building province of activity with which he had been associated from boyhood, and a banker of more than local prominence and worth, David G. Morrison is accounted a man highly capable and proven in counsel and the direction of affairs.

D.— During the World War when America sent her finest boys to the battlefront in Europe to ward off the foul onslaught on human liberty and civilization, medical men lent their much-wanted services to the patriotic cause and in their double capacity as healers, sanitarians and hygienists, reduced the suffering, assisted in preserving the lives of all the noble men who rallied to the cause of country-, helped unfurl and proudly keep floating the star-spangled banner, on European battlefields, in European ports, and on the high seas. While most American surgeons and physicians were drafted into the American Expedition¬ ary Forces and the various field hospitals, the American Navy also had to have an additional number of medical men in excess of the number of regular navy doctors of peace times. One of the American medical men who served the cause of his country in the naval services is Dr. William J. Godfrey, of No. 4^9 Broadway-, Astoria, Long Island.

ROBERT PRICE BELL— Varied and interesting affairs have commanded the attention of Robert Price Bell, but throughout his entire career thus far he has allied his work with legal advance. Mr. Bell is a man of large ability, whose wide experience has extended his usefulness to a breadth seldom achieved in the ordinary course of professional practice, and the record of his life-work is of definite interest to the people of Long Island. He is a son of Dr. Wilson F. and Ade¬ line (Jacques) Bell, both now deceased, his father a prominent physician of his day and surgeon in the United States Navy during the Civil War. The Bell and Jacques families are very old ones in America, and Mr. Bel! is the sixth generation in direct descent to bear the name of Robert Price Bell. Robert Price Bell was born in Newark, New Jersey, January 1, 1867. His education was begun in the local public schools, and following the completion of a high school course at Newark he attended Newark Academy, in preparation for a course at Princeton University. He attended Princeton University, however, for only a short period, having an opportunity to read law under the late Vice Chancellor Howell, of Newark. His dis¬ tinguished preceptor is now long since deceased, but the inspiration gained from his teachings has been a force of marked importance in Mr. Bell’s success. Admitted to the bar February 24, 18 88, Mr. Bell established him¬ self in private practice, but seven years later accepted the position of private counsel to Jacques Le Baudy. This gave him the opportunity to travel extensively, and accompanying Mr. Le Baudy on his travels, Mr. Bell once made the grand tour around the world. In 18-98 Mr. Bell became identified with the “Waterbury Repub¬ lican,” of Waterbury, Connecticut, in which connection he was engaged for some years. He then established himself in the private practice of law in New York City, continuing until 1912, when he located permanently in Flushing. He has now been active in the community for twelve years, and his work is bearing direct sig¬ nificance to the welfare and progress of the people. Mr. Bell’s public services have been limited to those lines parallel with his professional work. Supporting the Republican party, he accepted the appointment in 1909 as deputy attorney-general for the State of New York, and later, in 1921, he was appointed assistant district attorney of Queens County, in which capacity he still serves. He was active as counsel for the county clerk during the period when Mrs. Clara Rogers held that position, and in all public service his work is eminently constructive. During the World War, Mr. Bell served as chief registrar for the local draft board and further bore a part in all home war endeavors. He is a well known member of the Republican Club, and influential in the councils of his party. Mr. Bell resides with his family at No. 592 South Seventeenth Street, Flushing, Long Island.

He is a member of the State and County Medical associ¬ ations ; Kings County Homoeopathic Medical Associa¬ tion; the Academy of Pathological Science of New York; and the Associate Physicians of Long Island. He is also a member of the Gamma Alpha and Alpha Sigma fraternities. Dr. De Nyse is active in the civic life of the community, and is doing much for the welfare and progress of the section. He has a wide acquaintance¬ ship, and is held in high esteem by his fellows. Dr. Percy Lott De Ny'se married, in May, 1907, at Brooklyn, New York, Olive Doremus, daughter of James A. and Charlotte (Mills) Doremus, her parents both deceased. Dr. and Mrs. De Nyse are the parents of one son, Donald Lott, born July' 6, 1910. HENRY C. BOHACK — A man with an idea and sufficient force and judgment to carry that idea into effect — that is Henry C. Bohack, and in the magnitude of his achievement the ability of the man is very definitely and comprehensively appraised. The eight and one-half acres in the borough of Queens, which are covered by- buildings of the finest modern construction, forms the center of wide activities which have been set in motion and stabilized by this master mind, and all for the dis¬ tribution among the people of daily needs in the way of food and household supplies. The alert, far-visioned personality of the man at the head of this great enterprise stands for the highest efficiency in this branch of distri¬ bution, and this vast extent of storage space and equip¬ ment is known to the trade as the great Bohack “Cup¬ boards.” Henry C. Bohack is a son of Christian and Dorothea (Postel) Bohack, his father a successful farmer of Germany. Henry C. Bohack was born in Germany-, June 15, 1865, and received a practical education in the public schools of his native land. Coming to America at the age of sev¬ enteen years, Mr. Bohack reached Brooklyn in 1882 and found his first occupation as a clerk in a small gro¬ cery store. Remaining for three years, he then bought a half interest in the business, but at the end of a some¬ what longer period bought out his partner’s share. He then established his first independent store May 25, 1889, locating at the corner of Broadway and Givinett streets, and continued active alone until 1903. Meanwhile, during this period of some fourteen years, Mr. Bohack went forward on a decidedly original plan. He would train a man to conduct a store, sell him a half interest in the business, then leave him to go ahead while Mr. Bohack himself started another enterprise. In the same way he would find a suitable associate, give him a sound foot¬ ing or basis upon which to go forward and leave him when he had gained his strength, so to speak, to conduct the business alone. In 1903 Mr. Bohack’s enterprises had reached so widely and become so important that he felt the need of other associates with executive responsibility. He, accordingly, incorporated but continued along the same general plan. In 1913 a reincorporation was ef¬ fected, and an even more definite policy of expansion was adopted. Throughout many of the rural and suburban communities of Long Island, Mr. Bohack established stores in the same manner until in February, 1923, this great group included three hundred and thirty stores, of which one hundred and ninety-five have meat departments in addition to the regular cash and carry grocery stock. During all this history of achievement along original and eminently practical lines the problem of supply was one of the greatest of which this important executive had to meet. It was characteristic of the man that he saw the problem and that in an original and thoroughly efficient way. Securing a most desirable location at the junction of Metropolitan and Flushing avenues, in Queens County, he began building. He was not satisfied with only half¬ way measures, but planned for the highest possible achievement. The result stands in twenty-five great buildings, equipped with every modern device for effi¬ ciently and rapidly handling and storing grocery and meat stocks. These buildings cover a floor area of 280,000 square feet, and with the necessary avenues of approach and division cover a ground area of eight and one-half acres. The plant includes an independent forty- three car railroad siding; water supply system, and has a street frontage of 1.094 feet. A pork department, equipped for cutting hogs, smoke houses, a bologna manufacturing plant, a refrigeration plant and an ice plant, and a three-story bakery building, the most modern in the country, with a daily capacity of 30,000 loaves, are additional features which enable the Bohack stores to offer an unexcelled service. From these great “Cup¬ boards” the daily supply of meats, groceries, fish, bolog¬ nas. vegetables, etc., gathered from the world’s choicest markets, and from every country on the face of the globe, is distributed to the retail stores, from which the people of the greater part of Long Island, as well as the metropolitan district, supply their daily needs. The plant shows not only in its inception and in its design the orig¬ inality and force of the man who planned it, bu"
