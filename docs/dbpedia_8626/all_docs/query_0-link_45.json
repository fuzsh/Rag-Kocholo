WAUGH and 80N, Lon 4. Goodee-stered, I IRELAND.OUR OWN DUBLIN, Nov. The Catholio University Loses no opportunity of putting forward its claims to Government recognition .\n\nIt was heard again yesterday raising its voice in the Cecilia-street School of Medicine on the occasion of the opening of the winter session. Dr. Quinian, who delivered the inaugural address in presence of the reotor and a number of profossors and doctors connected with the institution, made the education question his chief subject. He stated that the names of 110 qualified cal practitioners were contained in the class lista, Forty-one medical officers of the army and 13 of the navy educated in this School of Medicine had gained their posts by competition, and ten of the former pupils of the school were in the Peninsular and Oriental service; With respect to the rolation of the University to the State, the lecturer referred to Mr. Gladstone's letter of the 18th which it was stated that the Government were resol red, so far as in them lies, to continue the work of redressing real grievances, doolared that next to the sufferings endured by our peasantry from an unjust land system, the neceasity of procuring for Catholic youths a system of education conducted by Catholics one in which the practice and teaching of their religion shall form part-was an object of parsmount importance .\n\nBe regarded the University of Dublin and the Queen's Colleges as wholly unsuited for the education of Catholics, and adverting to Mr. Fawoott's resolution for opening the fellowships of Trinity College, and its acceptance by the heads of that institution, he entered into a calculation to show that it would be 40 years before they could have a Roman Catholic Senior Fellow, and the balk of them would have passed to their account before they could possibly attain equality in the whole body. He maintained that the aim and object of the educational policy pursued by the Legislature during the last 30 years had been the gradual destruction of Catholicity in Ireland by means of mixed education. He quoted a passage from the memoirs of Archbishop Whateley in reference. to the national system of education to sustain his gument .\n\nThe lecturer thought. that the Catholic people who in the days of their persecation had been true to the principle of education founded on religion were not likely to abandon it when in the enjoyment of religious equality and under Government pledged to rule this country in a spirit of Christianity and justice. They wanted no ascendency over their Protestant brethren, but would have equality in education as well as in every other political privilege. It is quite natural that Professor in the Catholic Unirersity\" should advocate as warmly the lecturer the denominational principle upon which it founded but his co-religionists are by no means unanimous in desiring to see an exclusive system established, and the University education placed under ecclesiastical control. The recently quoted pamphlet by Dr .\n\nMaguire, lately resident graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and now Professor of Latin in the Queen's College, Galway, is not the only expression of dissent on the part of educated Roman Catholics. It is understood that declaration on the subject is now in conrse of signature by the laity. The extent to which it may be signed in favour of the denominational principle, and the position of the persons who attach their names, will afford some authentic evidence of the state of feeling, but it will be subject to the consideration that great pressure will be applied in order to make an imposing demonstration. An account reached town yesterday evening of an atrocious outrage in the county of Cavan, committed, it is supposed, by the Orange party. As the Rev .\n\nJames Dunne, P.P., of Belturbet, was returning home from the tenant-right meeting in Cavan, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Smith, 0.0., and some tenant farmers, about 6 on Monday evening, they were fired at by a party of miscreants, who lay in ambush for them at a place called Drumalure, a 'stronghold of Orangeism. The two priests, who were seated on private car, escaped uninjured, although the horse was killed, but one of the farmers, a man named Edward Morton, of Belturbet, was shot dead, another was wounded in the forehead, and others received wounds more or less severe. No motive is alleged for the outrage, but a very bad spirit has prevailed in parts of this county for some time past .\n\nThe assassins immediately fled, but it is hoped that the police, who are exerting themselves to the utmost, will find some clue to their discovery. Morton was walking alongside the car when he was shot. A tenant-right meeting was held yesterday in Monaghan, It was attended by 6,000. or 8,000 men, chiefly farm labourers, Mr. Bonaparte Wall, J .\n\npresided, and Mr. G. Murphy mored, and the Rev. Mr. Conolly seconded, a resolution deolaring 66 that the tenantry of Ireland were entitled to fixity of tenure at a fair rent.\" The rev, gentleman denied that the tenant-right\" of Ulster would give peace to the country, and demanded that there should be an end put to the capricious and arbitary eviction of tenant who was able and willing to pay his just rent .\n\nHe referred, an example, to the eviction of Dean M'Mahon for the part which he took in the election before the last. He declared that they still had. confidence in Mr. Gladstone, and the meeting ratitied the statement by their cheers. They also obeyed his call for three cheers for the Queen .\n\nMr. M' Kenna, of Belfast, moved a resolution which stated that the so-called tenant-right of Ulster is myth and a delusion, It does not exist in this county, nor in any county that we know of.\" He observed that in the south there appeared to be feeling of distrust towards the north because the people did not think they had SO strong cohort of sympathizers. He complained that landlords, even such as Lord Lurgan and Lord Dufferin, who boasted that they recognized tenant-right, exercised the most arbitrary powers, The Rev. Tobias M'Elroy, C.0., seconded the resolution. He disputed the assertion that Ulster was prosperous, and went into calculations to show that the population of the county Monaghan had fallen off 100,000 since 1841 .\n\nHe read specimens of the notices to quit, and related instances of rents increased by the landlords, Mr. C. Kelly, J.P., moved a resolution expressing gratitude to Mr. Gladstone and the Legislature for putting down religious ascendency, but proclaiming that a proper settlement of the land question is necessary for the contentment of the Irish people.\" A petition to Parliament was adopted. It is stated that the meeting at Ennis on Sunday was attended by 20,000 persons .\n\nIt was admitted, however, to be inferior in numbers to the amnesty demonstration recently hold. Captain -Purcell O' Gorman occupied the The Rev. Mr. Quaid proposed the first resolution, which claimed for the tenants fixity of tenure at fair rents as the only satisfactory settlement of the question. He denounced the notice to quit as the infernal machine of Ireland .\n\nHe alluded to the decline of the population of the country, and charged the wicked, treacherous, and tyrannical English Government with having sent three millions of people across the seas or into paupers' graves. Mr. John seconded the resolution. Sir J. Gray addressed the meeting at some length, advocating fixity of tenure so that the stalwart Irishman and his family might be rooted in the soil as the oak in the forest, and he ridiculed the mockery of leases and compensation for improvements as wholly sufficient to satisfy them .\n\nThe meeting having given utterance to their feelings with respect to the political prisoners, he declared that he would do his utmost to procure their release. The Rev, Dr. Corbett moved resolution in favour of fixity of tenure and fair rents. He expected to 800 the infamous land code swept away. He expected it from the solfishness of the English people, who would have no objection to be saved the expense of maintaining an army of occupation .\n\nHe gave instances of the notice to quit, and said he could curse the laws that allowed such infernal wrongs to be done upon an honest and religious people.\" The Her. Mr. Quaid here took up the service, and exclaimed The curse of God upon them to which the multitude devoutly responded Amen.\" Other speakers followed, and resolation was passed to the effect that no Land Bill would be satisfactory in which equitable provision is not made for the labouring classes of the community.\" A meeting of tonant farmers was held at Magherafelt, county Londonderry, on Monday, at which resolations were adopted demanding security of tenure at fair rents, and declaring that the feeling of insecurity had prevailed in the county for many years. Judge Warren yesterday granted conditional order in the Probate Court Tor a new trial of the will case of Browne Kamonde,\" which was tried before Mr. Justice Lawson at the last of Carlow, and terminated in verdict establishing The ground on which new trial sought in that the Judge refused to entertain a chalenge to the array, instead of allowing it to be investigated .\n\nA meeting of Protestant tent operatires, convened by the J. Gregs, held last evening in the Round Room of the Rotunda, 44 to initiate new movement for the recovery of the Church property. The rev, gentleman and others denounced be Church Act. (BY TELEGRAPH.) The party fired on at Drumalure, numbering some hundred, left Beltarbet in the morning with green flags, and on their way utter ed party ories. The Protestant party were greatly irritated, and several clergymen went among them and tried to appease them, Information of an apprehended disturbance was sworn in the evening, and the military were despatched, but arrived too late .\n\nSome reports state that the processionista, on their return, made party demonstration, threw stones at the houses, and attacked the Orange party; others that the Orangemen fired without any provo- cation. SANITARY WORKS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -As Saliabary appears to furnish the best example of diminished mortality over the longest period of years since operations done under powers of the Pablio Health Act, it is of some importance that no public misapprehension exist a to the nature of the works there executed, Mr. Bailey Denton in his letter to The Times of last Thursday appears to have conceived serious error about them, Having first stated that the maximum decrease may be achieved where the system of separating the, sewage of dwellings from the water of the soil on which they stand has been adopted and the sewage and drainage can be discharged by separate channels,\" be refers to Salisbury the only case where this twofold action has been intentionally designed and perfected designed.\" Now, at Salisbury such a separate discharge of sewage and drainage, as is conveyed by Mr .\n\nDeaton's words, does not exist nor was intended to exist, for in truth the two are not kept distinct throughout, but are mixed togethor in the brick main sowers in their entire course through the city, sad pass away by one outfall into the river Avon below the city. With a view to correct present and to prevent future misunderstanding, it may not be supererogstory for me, the originator of sanitary reform in Salisbury, to give brief account of the works done, their intentions, kinds, and results 1. Intentions. -The evils existing at Salisbury were very wet subsoil, soaked almost to the surface by canals, not water-tight, shallow ruaning along most bad of water the tainted streets, with and 61th welli, yielding from those cesspools and canals, in which ran the contents of hundreds of closets, a moist and foul atmosphere caused thereby existed at all times. The intentions were to dry the subsoil by deep drainage and to carry off the sewage by proper sewers, The also to obtain a works plentiful done were supply a of combined good water .\n\nkinds of system for drainage, sewerage, and water supply. Two brick mains pass through the central streets of the city, and converge to one larger -all of these mains being several feet in diameter, their floors are formed of hollow stoneware pioces (invert blocks), laid nine or ten feet below the surface. These mains act both as drains and sewers, being receivers of the subsoil water, house and closet sewage, sad rainfall. Into these brick maine enter from the other streets glased earthen ware pipes of sises varying from 15im. to 9in, in diameter, these receiving from house-drains of smaller diameter both sew .\n\nage and rainfall from the premises, Along the trenches containing the glazed pipes were also placed small porous All of these pipes, glased and porous, terminate in the brick mains, in which, an before said, the entire contents -drainage, sewage, and rainfall-are mixed and discharged by one main outfall into the Avon. (There are two small pipe outlets from some premises not drainable into the mains.) By this mingling of sewage and subsoil water a constant current is formed in the brick mains in fact, an underground brook is produced by the quantity of subsoil water always running, even in the very dry seasons of late experienced. To this very circumstance of mixture of sewage with subsoil water I am inclined mainly to attribute the steadily successful working of our drainage system. Another work done was the obliteration of the street canals, with one exception. A plentiful supply of escollent water has been obtained from well sunk in the chalk rock -the quantity daily pumped and served with high pressure is upwards of 600,000 gallons, or an average of about 45 gallons for each person in the borough .\n\n3. Results. -The subsoil water having been lowered several feet, is now kept down to a level with the water in the brick mains, thus giving over the city generally an average depth of eight or nine feet of subsoil, perfectly dry, instead of the mere crust previously existing of only three or four feet, and near to the canals of even less than that thickness, for in these situations house foundations were always in water, and dirty water was often present under sitting-room floors. As proofs of complete dryness many cellars of good depth, made since drainage, have kept quite dry, made and old cellars, My before wet and in often the useless, Close, have affords been quite dry. own residence, remarkable instance .\n\nIn a cellar about 6ft. deep, where subsoil water rose every wet season to a height varying from several inches even to the floor for 15 years since is a brief description of works done at Salisbury. It drainage has continued perfectly dry. will be seen that the physical intentions have been fully fulfilled. It will be also seen that while theie works have been adapted to their purposes by some peculiarity of construction it bas not been of the kind indicated by Mr .\n\nRailey any separate discharge of sewage and drainage on the contrary, the fact of their mixture appears to be conducive to the steady working of the main drains. As shown in my previous letter, a persistent decrease of mortality has followed the works for long period of 15 decrease from the old average of 27 in 1,000 to 20 in 1,000 for 12 years, and for the last three years, down to lation of the works per to annum. this sequent am decrease cannot be de17 in 1,000 I quite aware that the remonstrated to the souses in like manner with the drying of subsoil; yet causations cannot be doubted, and the results of the works-in other words, good air, good water, and cleanliness must fairly claim a great share in the conversion of Salisbury from among the most unhealthy cites into, perhaps, the most healthy city in The reason why Salisbury furnishes maximum reduotion of mortality when compared with other places which have been well sewered, I believe, may be found in the change from excessive wetness of subsoil to perfect dryness, for as in other towns no such excess of moisture existed as that here caused by the street canals, so great change could not occur, and therefore a death decrease so large could not be expected. I have elsewhere shown how this fact may most probably explain the reduction in phthisis mortality actual lowness of death-rate compated with the Saliabary. other towns of the kingdom, their average being 24 in 1,000, may be well referred to the admirable site upon which the city is built, the natural advantages of which had been spoilt for centuries, One fact not generally known may be tioned about this site, -with only four exceptions, Salisbury is the highest of the whole number of 28 cathedral cities of England and Wales, its site being 150ft .\n\nabove sea level. In conclusion, may I be permitted one remark as to my own hopes from sanitary works expressed publicly about 17 years ago! In an address to the inhabitants,\" urging upon them the pressing need of drainage, occur these words In all human probability, instead of mortality of 27 in 1,000, you will have have one-third less.\" How nearly exact that prediction was, time, which serves to tell all things, bas amply verified for the long period of 15 years, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, The Close, Nov. 1. A. B .\n\nMIDDLETON. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -The fact stated by Mr. Bailey Denton in your impression of October 28, that there are hundreds, nay thousands, of towns and villages in a discontented and doubtful state, waiting for positive data to commence sanitary operations, will be a sufficient apology, I trust, for my offering through you to the public the following remarks on that gentleman's reference to my proposed mode of cleansing towns and villages by means of earth instead of by water. Let me first express my deep conviction that to any who will take a fair general view of the actual working of the ordinary water system it will appear that Mr .\n\nBailey Denton has understated rather than overstated the evil results which in not a few cases have attended the enormous outlay on the water sewerage of towns, and from some of which results even those instances of towns in which, cording to the death-rate, there has been success have yet not been altogether free, I will mention only one of those results. The heavy expenditure both on the first cost of the public works sad on keeping them in repair, and, again, 06 the working of the system, involves the necessity of large increase in the burden of rates, That burden presses very. heavily on the working classes. By this the overcrowding of dwellings is increased rather than prevented, and the evil consequences of this are not confined to foul and vitiated air. The turning of the sewage of town from the polluted river for irrigation purposes involves the necessity of large additional outlay and, even if the profits arising from such irrigation should possibly, through some favouring be sufficient to pay interest on the latter outlay, they yet would afford relief of the original burden .\n\nNow, the relief of such burden, or, rather, in the greater portion of the thousand towns and villages,\" the prevention of such burden, the earth system can effect. Cleansing esch house thoroughly, without offence either to its inmates or to those of the adjoining houses, without pollution of the neighbouring stream, and without raining foul and deleterious vapours from the sewage-sodden water meadows, the fret cost of the works for this system ought to pay at least 10 per and 00 no alight grounds, believe might pay 100 per cent; and thus, while effecting ur better provision for their health, would greatly relieve, instead of oppreming, the working Mr. Bailey like most others, styles this system the earth agatem and under the influence of the I suppose, he limits views of it and his state- of The by it is the most of is nos whole the system quite under carried out by myself, both of the kitchen of the bedrooms bare for from my house sad disposed more than they could villages this to those for the ading, sink disposed irrigation in slop at each end town, and land be made worth 206. per I would, however, avoid detail. The the face of an amount of prejudice and almost incredible, is so advancing in pablio opinion shat I would not be supposed to care personally to press it, Only let the of the thousand towns and villager waiting for suicient data on which to commence sanitary operations speedy and searching investigation of this matter .\n\nLet the investigation be commisted to men of known candour, intelligence, and ability, not to those whose whole lives and whose professions, perbaps, have been so pledged to the water system and mixed up with it that amply, it may be, through prejudice they, in looking st what they imagine the earth system to be, can only see and difficulties, and esanot principles and modes of action. One caution more, which, however, personal let the investigation be into the system itself, and not into very bad imitations of it. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, Fordington Vicarage, Nor. 2. HENRY MOULE .\n\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, -Mr. Bailey Denton, in his reply to 0.8.\" and myself, altogether avoids the issue raised, but salers to Dr. Buchanan's report to the Privy Council. I find nothing in Dr .\n\nBuchanan's report which supports the theory that an increase of death -rate is attributable, the in any instance, to the construction of sewerage works or percolation of sewage from the sewers into the subsoil. Dr. reporta (in 1866) apos 25 towns in which sewerage has been In 20 towns the death-rate has been reduced, in two instances much as 32 per cent. in four other towns the death-rate has remained stationary, and in one town, Chelmsford, there has been a alight increase in the death-rate. Of one of the four towns, Penrith, De .\n\nBuchanan, after noticing several defects, states that everything seems to have been done by halves, the public sewering probably being the best part of the works.\" of another town, Worthing, Dr. Buchanan speaks of the drawbacks to the of the present drainage tem\" due to certain defecta which are pointed out. Of the third town, Peasance, De. DO time has elapsed since the full operation of the watercloset system, there is no room for surprise that deaths and disease remain much what they formerly were.\" Of the fourth town, Ottery St. Mary, no information given .\n\nOf the one instance of increase in death-rate Dr. Buchanan reports The effect of the pipe sewer system in removing excreta and refuse from houses appears to be complete bat that when the outfall is under water certain cellars are flooded by backed -up sewage that by a mill below Chelmaford the subsoil water is kept artificially up, and in wet weather there are fogs from the meadows, while in winter town environed on more than one side by marshy On siternate days the water supply is derived from a surface well, of which Dr. Buchanan states the supply is plainly bad one.\" In short, there is to each sort of work some drawback from complete efficiency.\" It is clear, therefore, from the authority to which Mr. Denton refers that sewerage has almost invariably been tended with success, and that in those where the death-rate has not been reduced by a system of sewers it is attributable to other and well-defined causes. To prevent the spread of erroneous impressions the object of my letter .\n\nI will gladly assist Mr. Denton sad the committee of the British Association in arriving at facts. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, LEWIS ANGELL Town-hall, Stratford, Nov. 2.

She wanted some money to give the purses in order that they might be more attentive and she said she felt very languid, which she thought was owing to her being unable to take the ten- and butter, both of which were very bad, She asked witness to send her tea and sugar. The deceased sent to seven times, and those who went to the workhouse wore always denied admission to the patient, who, it was stated, wan going on very well. Saddeniy message sent saying the young woman dead, and witness desired to have explanation the rules which precluded her from seeing the patient until life had departed, The medical officer, Dr .\n\nHill, called, and he seknowledged that had been treated in accordasce with the rules in being denied socess to the patient, who had not been ill day or two before her death, which occurred on the 23d Mrs, Senson, the midwife of the workhouse, questioned about the bribes being given by these patients to the in order to buy attention, and she elared she always warned these girls not to the but they would.
