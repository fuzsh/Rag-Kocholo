        "text": "Religious Education at St Brigid’s Catholic Primary School follows the Archdiocese of Liverpool programme “Come and See”. Each class covers 3 topics each term which link to a whole school theme. The information and documents below provide more detailed information.\n\nCome & See Overview\n\nCome and See Big Questions\n\nCome and See Programme Delivery\n\nRE Planning Grid 23/24\n\nReligious Education is the core subject in our curriculum; it influences all that we teach and enables us to develop the child as a whole person.\n\nThrough religious education teaching and learning we aim to:\n\nProvide each child with the opportunity to develop their relationship with God.\n\nPromote knowledge and understanding of Catholic faith and life.\n\nDevelop awareness and understanding of the impact of faith upon our daily lives.\n\nFoster attitudes of respect towards all who live in our society.\n\nDevelop skills linked to the reflection upon and practice of religious belief.\n\nThe ‘Come and See’ curriculum offers the opportunity to search, to explore, to discover, and to respond. The ‘Come and See’ document supports the central belief of Christ being at the centre of all that we do.\n\nIn each of the terms it addresses 3 key questions to be explored through the teaching and learning in the different topics:\n\nWhere do I come from? (autumn)\n\nWho am I? (spring)\n\nWhy am I here? (summer)\n\nAcross the academic year, our children will study 9 themes/topics. The themes are explored over a 4 week period, with time dedicated to exploring the basis of the theme, revealing the meaning of scripture and the Church’s teaching and reflecting on the child’s learning and experiences. During the year we also explore other faiths; Judaism is included every year and the other religions covered over a 3 year cycle are Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism.\n\nThere are three different types of themes within the programme, which are covered once per term. They are:\n\nChurch themes\n\nSacramental themes\n\nChristian Living themes\n\nEach theme is explored through a different topic in each age group.\n\nAUTUMN\n\nThe three autumn time themes are developed in the light of an understanding of Creation:\n\nFamily Domestic Church focuses on life as gift, myself as a unique and loved creation, the love and care that can be expressed in family groups.\n\nBelonging Baptism/Confirmation focuses on the call to belong, the creative potential that belonging develops; and Baptism and Confirmation, sacraments of the gift of God’s life and friendship.\n\nLoving Advent/Christmas focuses on the capacity for entering into loving relationships and the perfect gift and revelation of God’s love, Jesus, born of Mary, born as one of us.\n\nSPRING\n\nThe three spring time themes are developed in the light of an understanding of Incarnation:\n\nCommunity Local Church focuses on the people of God gathered in Christ, united in the journey of faith, in care for one another, in sharing their story and in celebration.\n\nRelating Eucharist focuses on the invitation to know Jesus, to live in communion with him and with one another.\n\nGiving Lent/Easter focuses on Jesus’ loving self-giving on the cross, the Father’s love that raises him to new life and the challenge to Christians to follow Jesus’ example of self-giving.\n\nSUMMER\n\nThe three summer themes are developed in the light of an understanding of Redemption and the work of the Holy Spirit:\n\nServing Pentecost focuses on the on-going mission of Jesus Christ in the Church through the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nInter-relating Reconciliation focuses on the love, compassion and forgiveness of God the Father revealed in Jesus and poured out by the Spirit to bring forgiveness and reconciliation in the sacrament of Reconciliation."
