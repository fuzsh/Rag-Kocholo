        "meta_description": "St Mary's has always been a welcoming church and we constantly try to live out what it means to be an 'Open Door Church' - whether that's you coming in to join us or as we move out to share God's  Good News in our community. So whether you're old or young or some-where in-between, you are very welcome! We have a Tots' Chapel and always love to see new families. We have a weekly 10.45am All Age Service, lots of activities on Wednesdays, and hold various 'explorer courses' and family events from time to time. We also maintain a 9am BCP service on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month. And of course we're always here for christenings, weddings: jus ring Rev Hugh on 0151 546 4266 or email hugh1@btinternet.com\n\nWe also want you to know that the parish of Earlsfield St Mary with St George is committed to the safeguarding of children, young people and adults. We follow the House of Bishops guidance and policies and have our own Parish Safeguarding Officer(s), PSOs. The Diocese of Liverpool’s safeguarding pages contain vital links and information including contacts for the Diocesan Safeguarding Advisor (DSA) who advise our PSOs. If you are concerned that a child or adult has been harmed or may be at risk of harm please contact the DSA. If you have immediate concerns about the safety of someone, please contact the police and your local authority Children or Adults Services.",

You can download a PDF that includes your church name, address and church code. This PDF, which is an extract from the Church of England’s database of churches, can serve as a certificate for churches requiring proof of their charity status when registering for online and card-based giving. Click on the download button below and fill in the short form. You will then be emailed the certificate as a PDF."
