I always love weddings at Knowsley Hall but when you add in perfect weather, an amazing bride and groom, non-stop smiles and a trip to Knowsley Safari Park for photographs with giraffes and elephants, it went from good to incredible!\n\nSt Mary’s Church in Knowsley Village\n\nSteph and Josh got married at St Mary’s Church in Knowsley Village in a ceremony full of emotion and laughter. It is a beautiful church, extremely photogenic and I was very kindly allowed to take photographs throughout the ceremony.\n\nAfter Steph and Josh had signed the register and made their way down the aisle and outside in to the sunshine, all their guests came to congratulate them before showering them in confetti. After which we made our way back to Knowsley Hall before going on to the safari park to meet the animals!\n\nI loved this part of the day. I think it’s fair to say I probably won’t photograph another wedding where the bride and groom are posing with giraffes and elephants! It was so much fun.\n\nSteph and Josh are such a great couple and it was so nice to see them both enjoying their special day so much. The whole day was full of real moments and genuine emotion. It was such a pleasure to capture.\n\nBeautiful weather\n\nI have photographed a few weddings this year where the weather hasn’t been great but for Steph and Josh, the sun didn’t stop shining all day. We were also treated to a stunning sunset and beautiful warm light. This made it so nice for evening portraits and I love the photographs we took at this time. Weather in the UK can be good!\n\nTo Steph and Josh, thank you so much for asking me to be your wedding photographer. It was such a pleasure to be a part of your day. I wish you both a very long and happy marriage together.\n\nHere are some of my favourite photographs from your wedding day at Knowsley Hall:"
