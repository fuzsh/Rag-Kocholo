A rather dodgy photo through the fence of 44209, freshly outshopped in the current CFCL Australia colour scheme. As the unit is still on transfer bogies, I imagine a bit more work will be done prior to it re-entering service. The unit was last on hire to El Zorro when it suffered a seized traction motor, which required it to be moved to Goulburn for repairs.

Up until it was repainted, '09 carried the livery of the defunct "R&H Transport Company", as seen at Gelco in 2010

A side on shot of G515 seen crossing Cooks River between Tempe and Wolli Creek. Although CFCLA own three G Class (formerly owned by SCT, PN, Freight Australia and V/Line), only one is painted in their corporate livery.

G511 is on long term lease to SSR, and is painted in the SSR colour scheme of black and yellow, while G512 is on hire to Qube logistics (as is G515), although it still retains the SCT colour scheme and logos.

CM3309, leased from CFCL Australia (CFCLA) at the time, heads Bowmans Rail service #1501 for Cristal Mining through the dip near Lakeview, South Australia, heading to Kanadah (Broken Hill) for loading with mineral sands on 11 March 2020.

CM3309 is one of 21 somewhat unique model MP33C locos built by Motive Power in the US, with Cummins power plant, only found operating in Australia.

CFCLA is now known as Rail First Asset Management and Cristal Mining is now Tronox. Changes to mining and transport operations in early 2022 may see this service disappear?

G515 arrives at Stockinbingal with 8242N Goonumbla copper concentrate ore, bound (eventually) for Port Kembla Outer Harbour. The line to the left of the loco leads to Griffith via Temora.

The last time I photographed G515 was shortly after it was repainted into CFCLA livery, when it was captive to the (then newly launched) P&O Trans Australia Melbourne to Adelaide container service. Since then, the unit has had CFCLA logos applied, and the name "Rising Fast" applied beneath the cabs.

With the P&O service cut back from Adelaide to Horsham, and with new motive power arriving in the state for that service in the form of GML10, G515 and G512 were transferred to P&O's NSW operations. With G511, that means that all three CFCL Australia owned G Class are operating in NSW.

G515, RL304 and 869 slowly ease over the Cooks River with 1213N freight from Port Botany.

This train is operated by P&O Trans Australia, normally from Port Botany to Narromine via Orange and Dubbo (typically running as train 1811N). Today the train is only operating as far as Goulburn (typically to drop off/pick up locomotives or wagons at the workshops), using the "old" 1813 path (P&O used to run a second train to the west, although this contract has been taken up by IRA at the time of writing).

Due to trackwork on the main south line, all freight is being diverted via Wollongong. This meant that 1213N departed Port Botany passed Marrickville Junction, reversed the train on the triangle at Chullora to return to Marrickville Junction to access the down Illawarra Lines. At Wollongong, the train will climb the steep grades to Robertson and Moss Vale before continuing on to Goulburn. To access Narromine, this train will run south to Cootamundra West before heading north to Parkes via Stockinbingal. What a trip!

G515 is no stranger to Parkes, as I last shot it approaching Goobang Junction with a loaded ore train.

CF4405, CF4406 arrive into Sydney Terminal with a CFCL Australia special commissioning train from Broadmeadow to celebrate the launch of CFCLA's new addition to the fleet.

Shot at f2.8 to hopefully keep the shutter speed fast enough that I could use the tele lens without any lens-shake.

With word 1863 was running late, we headed for Murrobo for a shot. Though in a poorly loaded fashion, VL354, VL356 and VL355 drop down hill through the huge S curve at Murrobo bound for Dubbo.

Unfortunately, the rest of the photos were write offs due to it being 'containerless'

Thursday 2nd October 2014

Standing in perfect light on the hill at Jindalee we were all getting mildly excited that 1311 QUBE intermodal service was getting close. Of course the best laid plans etc. etc....

Rail First Asset Management loco CF4412/CF4404 turned up hauling a lot of fresh air. Train 1311 is mainly used to convey empty containers from Port Botany (Sydney) to Harefield, New South Wales. Obviously this particular day the wharfies were a bit short on empties.

...and an ad for an automobile?

S300 and S311 display rare good timing as they roll through a gloomy Mascot with T280 freight from Yennora to Port Botany. An arriving Qantas plane helps set the scene overhead.

S300 and S311 were on hire to P&O Trans Australia to supplement the companies own 44 Class. With both 4471 and 4477 out of service on this particular day, it was a stroke of good luck to see a pair of ex-VR streamliners taking over the running of T280 instead.

EDIT: Thanks to Dean for some information on the plane. The plane was called "Yananyi Dreaming", and was repainted out of that livery in September 2014.

P&OTA's 8114N freight from Warren to Port Botany (via Cootamundra West) has a shocking record for on-time running. Seen passing through Werai is G512, 8044 and 4814. The return working, 1813N is due to depart Port Botany around midday on a Saturday, although when the inbound train is running many hours late, this is quite often a pipe dream!

G512, despite the SCT livery, is now owned by CFCLA. It is the only G Class that CFCLA own that has not been repainted from the livery it was purchased in (G511 is in SSR colours, and G515 is in CFCLA livery with the name "Rising Fast" applied).

8044 is owned by Engenco (formerly Coote Industrial), while 4814 is owned by Junee Railway Workshops.

As of late 2011, P&OTA lost the contract for the Warren train, it is now operated by Independant Rail.

Back to back EL class locos EL60/EL51 head Bowmans Rail train #1421S through on the mainline at Bolivar, South Australia on the evening of 11 January 2023. A brief panic when the camera had a momentary malfunction meant I ended up cutting the back of the train off!

The GE-powered EL class were built for Australian National in 1990 and after the sale of AN in 1997, ownership eventually passed to Chicago Freight Car Limited Australia. CFCLA was sold and became Rail First Asset Management a couple of years ago, from whom Bowmans Rail lease the locos.

It is not often that a coal train running from Newcastle to Clarence Colliery is seen passing through Regents Park, but that is exactly what happened on the 10th of December, 2011.

Due to trackwork on the up and down mainlines at Lidcombe, CA01 Centennial Coal/SSR empty coal train was routed via Flemington Markets as normal, only to divert south to Chullora Junction, then west to Sefton Park and north through Regents Park and Lidcombe Loop, to as to access the down suburban line at Lidcombe. At the time, we thought it unusual that the empty coal train was allowed access to the main line while blocking the Bankstown-bound suburban on the opposite platform, although we later found out that there was a police operation at Yagoona, with moderate delays affecting Bankstown Line services anyway.

The motive power was provided by C508 (CFCLA), GM27 (SSR), FL220 (CFCLA) and C503 (CFCLA).

C504 leads 442s6 and C508 through Awaba with 4144 freight from Kooragang Island, bound for Port Botany. At the time, C504 was only recently refurbished in Adelaide. C508 is owned by CFCL Australia and was on lease to South Spur Rail Services at the time. It is currently on long term lease to Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

If some of these photos look familiar, they probably are - I'm organising my photos from 2008, and taking the opportunity to rework some of them and either upload for the first time, or replace older photos.

The two J Class at Goobang Junction have an interesting history.

Originally purchased by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) in 1966 from Clyde Engineering for shunting duties (the J Class are almost identical to the first series Y Class purchased by the VR three years earlier). They spent their lives in WA until 1995, when four members of the class (the class leader had been scrapped two years earlier) were sold to Great Northern and transferred to Melbourne.

During their time with Great Northern, the J Class were used on a variety of tasks, including shunting the National Rail Corporation freight terminal, running shunting turns and trip trains, and infrastructure work. When Great Northern folded in 2002, ownership of the class passed to CFCL Australia, who leased the locomotives to Southern Shorthaul Railroad. CFCLA sold the four members of the class in 2009 and 2010 (to SCT and Freightlink respectivly) for use as shunters in NSW and SA.

J103 and J102 can be seen here shunting the SCT freight depot at Goobang Junction, on the outskirts of Parkes. Sadly, the units did not get close enough to the accessible end of the shunting neck for a roster shot, and I was not to keen on tramping through long grass in late spring...

Introduced by Australian National in 1990, the class of fifteen GE-powered ELs were originally designed for use on high-speed services across the Nullarbor Plain linking the eastern states and Western Australia. Since 1999, they have formed part of the Rail First (previously CFCL Australia) lease fleet.

For a number of years, until 2020, several were used on the short rake Pelton coal runs in the Hunter Valley, something of an anachronism running amongst the parade of high horse power, high axle load trains used on most coal services.

EL55/EL52 pass through East Maitland with an empty train bound for Pelton on 5 July 2012.

Veteran ALCo (and the only operational mk1 44 Class in preservation), 4403 prepares to return to Goulburn with the carriages used on the "CF Class Commissioning Special". It seemed fitting that this loco was used given the new CF Class are numbered in the 4400 series. 4403 was used to take the train from Sydney to Broadmeadow, where the CF Class were attached for the run back to Sydney.

For more details see here

When P&O Trans Australia initially started, it was to provide their own "in house" rail service between the P&O/CRT (QRNational) joint terminal at Yennora and Botany. Until the formation of P&OTA, this service had been run by LVRF, Patrick PortLink and QRNational.

P&OTA started by purchasing two 44 Class locomotives from CFCL Australia (71 and 77)to operate the twice daily service from Yennora to Botany and return. Due to an initially high failure rate, P&OTA would spot hire a locomotive from SSR to cover for one unit being out of action for repairs. For a brief period, KL81 was used on this service to replace 4471.

Here 4477 and KL81 can be seen departing the terminal at Yennora to move up to the junction with the Old South Main.

S300 and B76 can be seen edging into the platform at Gosford, waiting for a passenger train on platform 3 to depart to Sydney. Both locomotives are owned by CFCL Australia, and at the time were on lease to Interail (QRNational) to operate 1451/4152 Sydney (Yennora) to Broadmeadow (and return) freight. These trains conveyed loading to/from Brisbane and Melbourne, whereas the Brisbane and Melbourne bound trains would pause to attach/detach Sydney loading. It was not uncommon for these trains to be used for loco balancing movements, should extra motive power be required for one of the north/south trains.

Following on from the previous upload, after the rapid demise of The Explorer tourist train in mid-1994, loco 961 retained its special livery, but was relegated to normal broad gauge freight duties around South Australia by then owner Australian National.

On 22 February 1995 961/852/874 rumble past the yards and facilities at Dry Creek South with a broad gauge transfer move of wagons destined for storage on the Eudunda branch.

The boxcars were made redundant by National Rail/Australian National, but thankfully were picked up by private operator SCT for their standard gauge Melbourne to Perth run inaugurated later that same year.

961 was converted to standard gauge later in the year and ownership transferred a couple of times post privatisation of Australian National. It is currently owned by CFCL Australia and stored out of use at Gouburn, NSW.

A fairly standard roster shot of B76 at Chullora.

If some of these photos look familiar, they probably are - I'm organising my photos from 2008, and taking the opportunity to rework some of them and either upload for the first time, or replace older photos.

This was taken on a fairly grey day, so I removed the existing shot from Flickr and tweaked the RAW file to brighten the shot a little and increase the contrast markedly.

KL81 (4910), KL82 (4917) and GM10 (the latter outshopped in Southern Shorthaul Railways colours) head east through Campsie early on a Monday morning. At the time, all three locos were owned by CFCL Australia and were on lease to Southern Shorthaul Railroad. Now, SSR owns all three locos, with the two KL's renumbered and repainted into SSR livery.

Really needed different coloured containers to lift this shot a bit. QUBE loaded containerised minerals train #8466 from Cobar to Carrington (Newcastle) is heading along the Goulburn River valley near Sandy Hollow, New South Wales - 27 April 2019.

The two CM class locos 3303/3314 were leased from CFCL Australia, who purchased a total of 16 of these Cummins powered units from Motive Power in the US between 2013-15.

With Southern Shorthaul Railroad driver Buck Rogers at the wheel C508/C507 climb the grade up Morrisons HIll at Jindalee, New South Wales, with loaded grain train #8948 bound for Port Kembla - 4 April 2017.

Buck retired in December after a long and illustrious career working for a number of rail operators in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.

C508 is a lease unit owned by CFCL Australia.

Despite embarking on a very short chase of 6CM5 (hauled by CLF4, S311, S303. GM27 and CLP12) from Coolamon to Junee sub-terminal, there was still the mandatory cross field shot to show off the variety of colour schemes on the motive power.

I maintain I was only here for the textures in the fields behind the train - the train is just foreground interest.

CLF4 has been hired from RailPower at Goulburn, whilst S303 was on hire from Seymour Rail Heritage Centre. S311 and GM27 are former CFCL Australia locos now owned by SSR and CLP12 is a former Aurizon loco that was purchased and returned to service.
