        "text": "We invite you to discover the story behind this extraordinary car. We asked ourselves why not create 1 of 1 collector’s cars based on the latest technological developments. Cars that can be enjoyed at any time, not just admired in the garage or during a weekend drive.\n\nThe One of One projects, like the Falcon, will be based on the Mercedes G model because we believe it is the most timeless car, offering incredible performance, classic beauty and exceptional comfort. Our job is to ennoble – to tell successive stories for selected collectors and enthusiasts from different regions of the world who are passionate about high craftsmanship, jewellery and motoring.\n\nIt is through projects like these that we can continue to evolve, exploring more stories and cultures and bringing them to the world of motoring.\n\nEach new project will be aimed at different recipient and will tell a different story. The symbolism will always be inspired by Mother Nature, because we believe she is the best designer.\n\nWe believe that these designs will create additional intimate value for their sole owner and become a treasured dream object to be passed down from generation to generation.\n\nWe believe this is the case with the G-Falcon – our first story in the One of One collection.\n\nWe wanted to touch up every detail on this large-scale project. When we started work on the roof, we thought it would take 12 months, but it took 42 months of daily 8-hour work to achieve a satisfactory effect. It took three and a half years to complete all the work, the vast majority of which was the relief process.\n\nThe most important element of the G-Falcon is undoubtedly the hand-crafted roof with falcon relief – intricately applied decorative patterns – highlighted by subtle touches of gold on the polished metal. This pattern was first sketched by hand by Konrad who is the most outstanding graphic designer in our team.\n\nWe later transferred the pattern to the metal roof overlay. This is a metal component that adheres to the factory roof with laser-like precision. It takes four months to create such a piece before it is ready for relief.\n\nTo make working on the roof easier, we created a special electrically controlled table that acts like a painting easel, allowing access to the roof at any plane.\n\nWorking on the roof can be likened to making large pieces of jewellery.\n\nThe relief and fabrication process took 5,800 hours or 36 months of manual work at 8 hours a day.\n\nFrom the world of the finest haberdashery and footwear comes the art of patinating – a tradition that goes back to the roots of the finest craftsmanship. It is the intricate, hand-finished details that give leather its unique, timeless charm and elegance.\n\nLeather patination is a process that has stood the test of time, combining ancient tradition with modern manufacturing. The long experience of craftsmen is transferred to the surface of the leather, creating majestic colour effects that captivate and delight.\n\nThe natural waxes used in the patination process not only add elegance, but also a subtle fragrance that penetrates the structures of the leather. It is the scent of refinement and craftsmanship that wafts around you – take a deep breath and you will smell tradition and sophistication. Leather patination is not just a process; it is a ceremony in which each touch, each successive brushstroke creates a masterpiece of extraordinary beauty and expressive character. The end result is entirely determined by the patinator – his or her skill and sense of taste. It is a very sophisticated field of leather processing, which makes the first visual contact awe-inspiring, while the next is the amazing natural scent from the natural waxes and dyes, but the most captivating is the ‘feel’ of the leather. It is dense and strong to the touch, but at the same time its surface has a distinct softness. At every stage of the Falcon’s refinement, we have tried to bring the utmost commitment and expertise to the process. Patination is the breath of history that is inscribed in the structures of the finest craftsmanship, stealing hearts and minds and leaving an indelible mark in the memory."
