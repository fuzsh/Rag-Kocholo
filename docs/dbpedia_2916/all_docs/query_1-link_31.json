The class can be grouped into 4 subgroups, locos in the initial subgroup derived from the BL class locomotives, with later subgroups having minor detail changes.\n\nMajor advances introduced with the class included cab air conditioning, \"Trimount\" type high adhesion bogies, and \"Super Series\" wheel creep control to enable heavier loads to be hauled. On delivery to V/Line the class enabled the retirement of many lower power locomotives, such as the B and S classes. They initially saw use on the mainlines, due to their heavier axle loading. Duties included intercapital freights, grain haulage, and Melbourne to Sydney passenger work.\n\nToday track upgrading and branch line closures has seen the class usable on the majority of the Victorian network. Recent years have seen the class fitted with on line refuelling, and working from Melbourne to Perth on the Specialised Container Transport (SCT) service. After the sale of V/Line Freight, the new private owner Freight Australia rebuilt a number of G class locomotives with higher power engines, cascading engines to the X class."
