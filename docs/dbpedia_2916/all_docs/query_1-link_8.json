        "text": "The Victorian Railway’s before the 1950s was heavily dependant on steam traction which hauled passenger and freight across Victoria, making Victoria seem smaller and closer together.\n\nCommonwealth Railways, NSW Government Railways and Victorian Railways started to take notice of iconic movement that was occurring in the United States of America, the rise of the E and F series streamliner locomotives with the modern EMD 567B engine which revolutionised passenger and freight transportation.\n\nCommonwealth Railways ordered the ML1 which are more commonly known as the GM Class locomotives, which were modified for Australian uses however the VR went for something unique.\n\nIntroducing: ML2 — Victorian Railways B Class Diesel-Electric Locomotives.\n\nThe Victorian Railways followed suit with the ML2 which are more commonly known as the B class. The B class differed from the GM as the Victorian Railways wanted a locomotive that was able to do the bi-directional operation and act as a ‘mixed locomotive’ which had to be capable of hauling passenger and freight trains.\n\nDue to the time, the Victorian Railways weren’t able to import locomotives from the United States of America due to Commonwealth Government restrictions.\n\nClyde Engineering was commissioned under the licence of General Motors, Electro-Motive Division to build this order of 26 ‘state of the art’ modern mainline diesel locomotives came in at the time of the purchase of the Victorian Railways J and R class steam locomotives.\n\nThe body shape of the B60 / A60 locomotive is known as a Streamliner because it has a smooth and aerodynamic shape. Many streamlined vehicles including aircraft, cars, railroad locomotives and ships were created during the emergence of the Streamlined Moderne style 9 in the 1930s. Streamliner locomotives were competing for patronage with planes and motor cars and were designed to give the public the impression that the new trains were modern and fast and would provide a luxurious and glamourous travelling experience. The streamlined effect was created by covering as many of the working parts as possible. The first Streamliners on Victorian Railways and in Australia were the four steam locomotives modified as directed by Harold Clapp in 1937 for the Spirit of Progress. All these were scrapped by 1954 but are remembered for their distinctive and elegant design.\n\nThe B classes were ordered in 1951 and Clyde Engineering delivered the first B class in 1952.\n\nOne of the unique differences between the F series and the streamliners built in Australia was the six-axle arrangement which resulted with a Co-Co (six-axle) bogie arrangement which allowed for a lighter axle loading due to the distribution. This was considered odd by the Americans as they used a Bo-Bo (four-axle) as their axle loading was significantly heavier. The locomotives suited the smaller loading gauge with required modifications to the F7 body (stretched and lowered body).\n\nAnother consideration before the introduction was the Victorian Railway’s livery. As it had to refect the modern change that the Victorian Railways were facing, with the ‘New Look’. The livery was derived directly off ‘ERIE’ Railroads black and gold with the wings. The Victorian Railway’s version adapted it's Blue and Gold’ scheme from the iconic streamlined S class Pacific steam locomotives and altered to suit the B class streamliner locomotives. It was also suggested during at the time, wings on locomotives were a trend.\n\nAuthors Note: it’s rounded streamlined cab highlighted the best of the Art Deco period and the trends at the time as the streamlined cab on both ends illustrates elegance, a sense of royalty and giving the impression of efficiency, dynamism, and speed. Further complimented with it’s Victorian Railway’s Blue and Gold livery that would be later the flagship shows off the Victorian Railway’s achievements and ability to adapt to new motive power.\n\nThe B classes were built by Clyde Engineering, Granville NSW, during 1952–1954.\n\nThe initial batch of 5x B locomotives that were delivered came in at the time (during 1952) where 64 out of the 70 Hudson R Classes were delivered to the Victorian Railways which both classes of locomotives were welcomed and proved themselves. The introduction both fleets saw the retirement of old and obsolete locomotives which had years of the first-class service to the State of Victoria.\n\nThe B classes were exclusively used mostly on broad gauge during the Victorian Railways days, seen on almost in every part of Victoria. From hauling grain from the western district, heavy and slow freights to mainline passenger services, these were one of the true workhorses of the Victorian Railways that led to the demise of steam. This saw the acceleration of most services within the timetable at the time.\n\nThe 26 mainliner (locomotives) now operate around 60% of the country passenger services and 30% of the goods services at an estimated annual saving in running cost of well over £1,000,000.\n\n1955 — New Look VR publication.\n\nWhen compared to steam power in 1954 when the final delivery was complete, the Victorian Railway’s reported that £80 per horsepower on a diesel-electric locomotive to a mainline steam loco which £60 per horsepower, the new diesel-electric would be able to rack up 130,000 miles compared to 35,000–60,000 miles per year for mainline steam locos.\n\nVR Chief Engineer Office found that the B class was able to successfully do the work of three steam locomotives.\n\nThe B class would have many achievements throughout its life, as in 1954, B60 would be one of the two locos used on the 1954 Royal Tour which hauled Queen Elizabeth around Victoria and soon after B62 was the first diesel-electric locomotive to achieve 1,000,000 miles\n\nAs B classes over the years had consecutive upgrades which included the 16–567B engine being upgraded to a 16–567BC (using the C type cylinder liners and cylinders being replaced to cater for this upgrade).\n\nThe introduction and the proven reliability of the B classes and the branch-line T classes lead to further dieselisation as in 1957, the Victorian Railways ordered a single cab version which was later known as the ‘S’ class diesel-electric locomotive.\n\nOver the years, they were working alongside the other VR diesel-electric locomotives that were allocated to the broad gauge fleet at the time.\n\nAs rising cost due to the maintenance and higher horsepower locos were on the verge.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Government-owned V/Line, the successor of Victorian Railways announced plans of all 26 B class locomotives would be going into the rebuilt ‘A’ Class locomotives. At the time, locos would be withdrawn once they were due for their major overhaul and would be sent to rebuilding at Clyde’s Rosewater facility. These were modernised versions of the B classes with a complete rebuild of the internals of the fitted out with 12–645E3C engines but this project was short-lived. This saw A60, 62, 66, 70, 71, 73, 77, 78, 79, 81, 85 converted to the rebuilt specs. Currently today, there are only five examples of the A-class locomotives.\n\nThe introduction of the A, N and G classes into V/Line fleet during the mid to late 1980s saw the withdrawals of the B classes in their masses from government service but most would later find life in privatisation whilst one (B74) was allocated to heritage operations at Seymour and remains currently the only operational B class in preservation at this moment.\n\nTo be continued: into the privatisation era"
