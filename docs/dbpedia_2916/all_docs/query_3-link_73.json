        "text": "New Mercedes models coming in 2024\n\nThis is the year we finally got to see the production version of the all-electric Mercedes G-Class, and there are plenty of other exciting models to come as well.\n\nNew Electric Mercedes G-Class G580\n\nIt’s been a few years since Mercedes first promised us an all-electric G Wagon, and it’s finally here. It retains all the retro boxy styling of the standard car, but there have been substantial changes under the skin.\n\nIntegrated into the ladder frame chassis is a 116kWh battery, giving the G580 EV up to 296 miles of range. The pack is also protected by a 4mm thick steel casing to keep it safe from jagged rocks when you’re tackling off-road trails.\n\nAlso unique to the electric G-Class is the G-turn feature, which can spin the car around on the spot to get you out of a bind in tight spaces. This only works off-road, but it’s still something a petrol-powered car can’t do.\n\nNew Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S E-Performance\n\nThe new Mercedes-AMG GT has been given a very long name, which means it’s also now sporting the E-Performance hybrid system for more power. This slinky coupe’s 4.0-litre V8 has been paired with an electric motor, so it now has 816hp and a whopping 1,420Nm of torque.\n\nThat’s over 230hp more than the standard AMG-GT 63 S, and 0-60mph is dealt with in 2.8 seconds, almost exactly the same as a Porsche 911 Turbo S.\n\nBeyond the added power, the E-Performance looks almost exactly the same as the 63 S. Just some red surrounds on the badges tell this car apart.\n\nNew Mercedes-AMG SL 63 S E-Performance\n\nFollowing the launch of the Mercedes SL, the brand’s performance arm has shoehorned the same plug-in hybrid system under the bonnet as you’ll find in the AMG GT 4-Door to create the AMG SL 63 S E-Performance.\n\nCheck out Mat’s review of the standard SL…\n\nThe result of this is 816hp and a huge 1,420Nm of torque, exactly the same as the AMG GT E-Performance. That’s 230hp more than the standard AMG SL 63 S, and it’s over 160hp more than you get in a Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet.\n\nThe result of this is 0-60 in less time than it takes some people to say the car’s full name, 2.9 seconds, and it’ll go on to a top speed of 197mph. All this performance is then wrapped up in the same stylish body as every other SL model.\n\nNew Mercedes models coming in 2025\n\nThere’s a focus on electric cars in 2025 for Mercedes, with a couple of new EVs rumoured to be coming next year.\n\nNew Mercedes Concept CLA\n\nThe new Mercedes Concept CLA was revealed late last year and, while it won’t go on sale in exactly this form, it will inspire a production car which should debut in 2025. The production version has been spotted testing by Carwow’s spy photographers, and it looks as though a lot of the styling cues will carry over.\n\nIt has a similar slinky silhouette to the current Mercedes CLA, however unlike that car this will be a pure EV. It’ll also be the first car to use a new collection of parts known as the MMA platform, which will give it up to 466 miles of range.\n\nLooking inside the Concept CLA and you’ll see plenty of clever new technology which will make its way into other new Mercedes models in the future. The massive display across the dashboard mimics the Superscreen system you get in the E-Class, and there are plenty of recycled materials.\n\nNew Mercedes EQC\n\nThe Mercedes EQC has been around for a few years now, and a replacement has been spotted during development testing by Carwow’s spy photographers. It appears to have a similar silhouette to the Mercedes EQE SUV, with a smooth, pebble-like appearance.\n\nThere are no details surrounding batteries or motors for now, however it’s not expected to use the same setup as the EQE. It’s more likely to share the same MMA selection of parts as the new Concept CLA, meaning a 400+ mile range is possible.\n\nIt may also share interior technology with that car when it debuts in 2025. It’s a bit early to put a price on this car just yet, but with the current model fetching almost £75,000 you can expect it to cost over £80,000.\n\nNew Mercedes-AMG EV\n\nAMG is working on a replacement for the GT 4-Door, and it’s going to be an EV. This new electric coupe has been spotted testing a few times now, and Mercedes has teased the design as well.\n\nIt looks like it’ll retain a similar profile to the current AMG GT 4-Door, but that’s about all you can see for now. Details about what’s powering this new car are also thin on the ground, however you can expect it to offer more power than the 843hp GT 63 S E-Performance 4-Door you can buy today."
