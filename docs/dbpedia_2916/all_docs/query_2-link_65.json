        "text": "Air Freight, also known as Air Cargo, Air Shipping or Air Transport is a logistics method that uses airplanes (passenger or cargo plane) as a means of goods transportation. Air cargo represents rough 35% of global trade by value, but less than 1% by volume.\n\nThe explosive growth of e-commerce has greatly increased the demand for air cargo. At CFC, we want to be your one-stop source for your supply chain solutions. We do this by working in virtually every aspect of the logistics management, including shipping via air for e-commerce businesses.\n\nHere this page will guide you to China air freight, including the advantages, cargo types, a sample airway bill, shipping process, china main airports list and more. Keep reading.\n\nAir Supply Chain Elements\n\nSeveral factors come together to shape the configuration of a supply chain:\n\nLogistics costs. Consider the full cost of getting the product to the end consumer, i.e. transportation, warehousing and transshipment. The concept of cost is relative as its significance relates to the value of the goods being carried. Cost considerations tend to focus more on low-value containerized cargo, such as commodities (e.g., paper), rather than high-value cargo (e.g., electronics).\n\nTransportation time. It is increasingly being considered as it strongly affects inventory holding costs and inventory cycle times in supply chain management. Therefore, for higher value or perishable shipments, the fastest and/or shortest route option will be preferred.\n\nReliability. For many supply chains, time may be a secondary factor as long as the goods arrive at the distribution center within the expected time frame. If shipments are regular and this reliability remains consistent, the supply chain can be organized accordingly by increasing in-transit inventory.\n\nSupply chain risks. Relates to generally imponderable factors involving the level of confidence that the shipment will reach its final destination within expected cost, time and reliability considerations. In some cases, the risk may also involve potential damage or theft of the goods. Low-risk routes are clearly better than high-risk routes.\n\nAir Freight Terminology\n\nAWB\n\nAir Waybill, is a non-negotiable transport document issued by the carrier (Master AWB) or the agent (House AWB), which indicating that the carrier has accepted the goods listed therein and obligates itself to carry the consignment to the airport of destination according to specified conditions.\n\nIATA\n\nInternational Air Transport Association, which supports airline activity and helps formulate industry policy and standards of the world’s airlines. As of 2023 it represents 317 airlines, including major carriers, from over 120 countries.\n\nETD: Estimated Time of Departure\n\nATD: Actual Time of Departure\n\nETA: Estimated Time of Arrival\n\nATA: Actual Time of Arrival\n\nETT\n\nEstimated Transit Time is for estimation purposes only and commonly can NOT be guaranteed although most shipments will depart and arrive as scheduled.\n\nDangerous Goods\n\nCommodities classified by IATA according to its nature and characteristic in terms of the effect of its danger to carrier’s flying safety.\n\nDimensional Weight\n\nAka Chargeable Weight or Billable Weight. Carrier charge for freight based on the dimensional weight or actual gross weight whichever is higher.\n\nMOQ\n\nThe MOQ is 45 kgs. The rate class is +45kg, +100kg, +300kg, +500kg, +1000kg. The courier cost less if < 100kg for most destination countries.\n\nAir Rate Class\n\nThe air rate for each range is different. The lower the billing weight, the higher the unit price, and the air freight rate for +45KG is the highest. Conversely, the heavier the goods, the lower the unit price.\n\nHere’s an example.\n\nWeight ClassWeight RangeAir Rate (Per KG)+45KG46-100KG$10+100KG101-300KG$8+300KG301-500KG$7+500KG501-1000KG$6+1000KGMore than 1000KG$4\n\nULD\n\nA Unit Load Device (ULD) is either an aircraft pallet and pallet net combination, or an aircraft container.\n\nAir containers come in various shapes and sizes to accommodate different types of cargo and aircraft. They’re designed to fit seamlessly into the cargo holds of airplanes, allowing for efficient loading, unloading, and transportation of goods.\n\nYou can simply take it as air container just like sea container. Not much attention needs to pay.\n\n* If the cargo exceeds below the weight and volume, the carrier can determine the allowable maximum limit and volume cargo base on the flight model, departure and destination airport handling equipment conditions.\n\nAir Freight Advantages\n\nAirmail was one of the earliest business-related applications of air transport, as it helped speed up monetary transactions and linked distant businesses together, facilitating the emergence of continental and intercontinental businesses.\n\nAir cargo provides the benefits of speed, reliability, security, and reduction of inventory cost.\n\nSpeed\n\nCertain products are extremely time sensitive. These could include a wide range of perishables, medical products, and seasonal products that must meet very specific delivery deadlines and whose production offers limited options other than by air.\n\nIn general, the transit time from China to worldwide is no longer than 10 working days. Only 3~5 days in most cases. This is a vast reduction compared to ocean freight.\n\nDirect, point-to-point air freight shipments typically will cost more than indirect routes. If the ship-time requirement is 2 days, you’ll likely be limited to 2–3 direct carriers. But if that ship-time requirement expands to 4–5 days, you might have 5–10 carriers in play using indirect routing.\n\nSecurity\n\nCertain products such as electronics, precision instruments, sophisticated industrial machinery and other high-value commodities, require more security from loss, damage or theft than lower-value goods. Aircraft generally offer not only the fastest but also the most secure way to move cargo from point to point.\n\nCapital Cost\n\nThe air cargo industry is being dramatically impacted by the rise of e-commerce. This evolving trend has put pressure on sales channels for faster delivery and optimum supply chain services.\n\nHigh-value commodities consume large amounts of capital and impose high interest costs. Besides, air cargo operations can offer a shipper the benefit of constant resupply, inventory levels can be reduced. A business can free up more capital, reduce inventory holding costs, and reduce obsolescence cost.\n\nAir Door-to-Door\n\nNormal air freight is just to-airport delivery. You or the freight agent needs to handle the customs clearance and inland transportation to your warehouse, while courier services such as DHL/FedEx/UPS can be the one stop to-door delivery provider.\n\nAir freight = airport-to-airport\n\nAir courier = door-to-door\n\nAir FreightAir Express/CourierService ScopeAirport to airportDoor to doorService ContentExcluding import operations at the destination airportIncluding customs clearance and delivery at the destination airport (excluding customs fees)Loadable WeightStarting from 45KG, some routes 100KGMinimum 0.5KGBillable Weight【Length (cm) × Width (cm) × Height (cm)】÷6000【Length (cm) × Width (cm) × Height (cm)】÷5000Shipping DocumentsWaybill, packing list, commercial invoice and maybe moreCommercial invoiceCustoms ProceduresThe consignor needs to declare customs and the consignee needs to clear customsUsually no separate customs procedure is required\n\nThe cost for express services is much higher than for other modes of transportation. This is because the express carrier typically owns and operates the entire transportation network from aircraft and delivery vehicles to hubs (both ground and air) and the downstream transportation network to deliver the cargo to its final destination.\n\nAir Cargo Types\n\nBy cargo properties, they can be divided into\n\nGeneral cargo\n\nSpecial cargo\n\n1. General cargo\n\nSuch as electronics, Jewelry, pharmaceuticals, wristwatches are high value. The electronics industry accounts for around 40% of the value of the entire international air cargo industry.\n\nThey need to be transported in a very good condition. The air shipping cost more than sea shipping, but means nothing compared to the value amount of products.\n\n2. Special cargo\n\nIncluding living animals, goods that are dangerous or need temperature control. For example, some chemicals are dangerous goods, and seafood that requires refrigeration and freezing during the whole-course cold chain transportation.\n\nPerishable or hazardous goods are subject to different regulations, compared to general cargo. They have to pass through various inspections and need to meet numerous requirements, and not every airline can accept these items.\n\nMake sure that you advise in detail about special goods you want to ship. Because leaving out any detail might lead to penalties/extra fees and denial of shipment.\n\nMost of the special cargo can be classified as general after tested by the authority. And there should be a report – Identification and Classification Report for Air Transport of Goods shown to the carrier before loading.\n\n2.1 Powder\n\n2.2 Chemical\n\n2.3 With oil or liquid\n\n2.4 With battery\n\n2.5 With magnet (needs magnet test)\n\n2.5.1 Audio accessory and equipment\n\n2.5.2 With motor inside\n\nOther restrictions will apply due to national laws and regulations of specific airlines.\n\nPlease note that most of the airlines are saying NO to the following names or descriptions of the commodity: Lithium Battery Toys, Scooter, Hoverboard, Power Supply, Power Bank, Air Bag, Electric Board, Electronic Board.\n\nAir Service Types\n\nWith CFC, you’re choosing not just a service provider, but a partner committed to ensuring your Chinese supply chain runs smoothly and efficiently. Let us handle the complexities, so you can focus on growing your business.\n\nEmbrace swift and seamless logistics with our varied air freight services.

Get your cargo to its destination in record time.1-2 daysStandardA balanced choice for routine cargo, offering an optimal blend of affordability and speed.3-5 daysEconomyMost cost-effective service, ideal for not so urgent shipments. Expect delivery within a reasonable timeframe without compromising on service quality.5-8 daysCharterA fully flexible and dedicated service, allowing you to charter entire flights for your cargo. Ideal for large volume shipments, special requirements, or when regular schedules don't fit your timeline.\n\nThe more flexible you can be with transit time requirements, the more you’ll save. Shifting from standard air to deferred air opens up huge cost-saving possibilities.\n\nLonger transit times also broaden the number of carriers and routing possibilities that can be considered. More competitors and more routing options typically yield a much better rate.\n\nDimensional Weight\n\nAir cargo rate is calculated by chargeable weight, measurement unit is kilogram. The measurement unit of valuable cargo is 0.1 kg. Chargeable weight is the heavier one between gross weight and dimensional weight.\n\nVolume UnitDimensional WeightBy air freightcm³Volume/6000By express couriercm³Volume/5000\n\n* If the weight is less than 21 kg, then the minimum chargeable unit is 0.5 kg; If more than 21 kg, then 1 kg.\n\n* To calculate air goods volume L x W x H in inches divided by 366 = weight in kilograms\n\nThe two options for air cargo transport are dedicated freighters and belly capacity in passenger aircraft.\n\nThe passenger aircraft has designed to transport both cargo and passengers. It has less cargo space with limited commodities.\n\nThe freight aircraft has designed exclusively for cargo with no passenger amenities. It has wide body, cargo doors, high wings and high tails.\n\nThe ideal specifications should be within these dimensions as below:\n\nFor wide-body aircraft,\n\nLength – 125in (315cm)\n\nWidth – 96in (240cm)\n\nHeight – 63in (160cm)\n\nFor narrow-body aircraft,\n\nLength – 48in (120cm)\n\nWidth – 40in (100cm)\n\nHeight – 31in (80cm)\n\nThe era of the wide-bodied jets started in 1970 when the first Boeing 747 entered service. This was the first time in history that the aviation industry chose size over speed to increase performance. The larger wide-body aircraft represented an increase the volumes carried by narrow body aircraft by a factor of almost 3.\n\nAir Waybill (AWB) Sample\n\nIf you have read our guide about Bill of Lading, you can also understand the AWB. AWB is almost the same structure as Ocean Bill of Lading (OBL).\n\nAn Air Waybill is a documentary proof of the contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier.\n\nIt also serves as:\n\na delivery receipt\n\na receipt of goods for shipment\n\na document required for Customs clearance\n\na form of invoice for the carriage of the goods\n\nan insurance certificate (if the insurance cover was arranged through the airline)\n\na dispatch note, bearing a list of all accompanying documents, and any special instructions given by the shipper\n\nDifference between AWB and OBL\n\nThe rule of AWB played in an international shipping is almost the same as OBL, but AWB doesn’t serve as a document of title. This is the most significant difference.\n\nThe words non-negotiable are printed at the top of the Air Waybill, and must not be changed or removed.\n\nThe AWB will be delivered with the air cargo. So as soon as the plane departs from the loading airport, the cargo rights will be transferred to the consignee. The consignee can only show their identification to claim the shipments. The AWB cannot be transferred. That’s why you have to pay freight costs before departure from China.\n\nSince the incorporation of the E-AWB (electronic air way bill) there is no longer a need to print, handle or archive the paper, largely simplifying the air cargo process.\n\n“Rate Charge”\n\nThere’s a column called “Rate Charge” in the middle of an AWB. This rate will be automatically generated by the airlines according to IATA, and can NOT be modified. The charge shown is higher than you really paid.\n\nThis is the all-in billable weight rate, calculated by:\n\nGCR (General Cargo Rate)\n\nSCR (Specific Commodity Rate)\n\nCCR (Commodity Classification Rate or Class Rate)\n\nBUC (Bulk Unitization Charge)\n\nAir cargo tracking\n\nEach AWB has its unique number. You can find this number on the head section. By submitting the number on the tracking page of the airline’s official website, all updated tracking information will be available.\n\nThe bill format is 2 airline code + 3 numbers as prefix + several numbers. Example, Air China Cargo, CA as the airline code, 999 as prefix.\n\nTracking & Tracing from Air China Cargo\n\nSome carriers will provide a free service called email alert. When the goods moved, the updated status will be sent to you shortly. Take advantage of that.\n\nTop 30 International Airports in China with Airport Code\n\nThe airport code, is designated with a code (three letters) by the IATA. Nearly every aspect of international flight operations, including airline name, currency, aircraft type, cargo standards, Hazmat regulations, and regional delineations, is standardized with an IATA code.\n\nAirport codes are identifiers that make international and domestic trade and transport work. These codes hold the key to efficiently navigating the complex web of global logistics. It is mandatory on many key freight documents, to specify the main transit’s airport of origin and airport of destination by their codes.\n\nIn fact, every airport, seaport, and inland transfer port has its unique code. These codes are nearly universally used by air cargo carriers and freight forwarders.\n\nAirport CodeAirport NameAirport CityPEKBeijing Capital International AirportBeijingPVGShanghai Pudong International AirportShanghaiCANGuangzhou Baiyun International AirportGuangzhou, GuangdongXMNXiamen Gaoqi International AirportXiamen, FujianHGHHangzhou Xiaoshan International AirportHangzhou, ZhejiangCKGChongqing Jiangbei International AirportChongqingCTUChengdu Shuangliu International AirportChengdu, SichuanKMGKunming Changshui International AirportKunming, YunnanCSXChangsha Huanghua International AirportChangsha, HunanXIYXi'an Xianyang International AirportXi'an, ShanxiNKGNanjing Lukou International AirportNanjing, JiangsuSZXShenzhen Bao'an International AirportShenzhenWUHWuhan Tianhe International AirportWuhan, HubeiSHEShenyang Taoxian International AirportShenyang, LiaoningTSNTianjin Binhai International AirportTianjinKWLGuilin Liangjiang International AirportGuilin, GuangxiNGBNingbo Lishe International AirportNingbo, ZhejiangHRBHarbin Taiping International AirportHarbin, HeilongjiangFOCFuzhou Changle International AirportFuzhou, FujianSHAShanghai Hongqiao International AirportShanghaiURCÜrümqi Diwopu International AirportÜrümqi, XinjiangDLCDalian Zhoushuizi International AirportDalian, LiaoningNNGNanning Wuxu International AirportNanning, GuangxiSYXSanya Phoenix International AirportSanya, HainanCGOZhengzhou Xinzheng International AirportZhengzhou, HunanHAKHaikou Meilan International AirportHaikou, HainanKWEGuiyang Longdongbao International AirportGuiyang, GuizhouTNAJinan Yaoqiang International AirportJinan, ShandongTYNTaiyuan Wusu International AirportTaiyuan, ShanxiHETHohhot Baita International AirportHohhot, Neimenggu\n\nChina has invested trillions of dollars to develop its transportation infrastructure. In fact, some of its busiest airports are practically brand new. Jiaodong International Airport (TAO) in Qingdao (between Beijing and Shanghai) and Chengdu Tianfu International Airport (TFU) in Western China both opened in 2021. Beijing Daxing Airport (PKX), launched in 2019.\n\nNot all airports in China have international flights. Often, it depends on the origin city. A freight agent as CFC that understands the China market can help determine airport options and which offer the best costs: airport-to-airport and airport-to-door.\n\nMain Airlines’ Shipping Routes\n\nAmong the world’s largest cargo airlines, two specialist airlines dominate the market: UPS and FedEx. Their fleet is entirely dedicated to cargo operations and provides cargo consolidation capabilities through dedicated hubs. Asian cargo airlines also play an important role (Air China), benefiting from the growth of high-tech exports from Asian economies to European and North American markets.\n\nAir freight activity is usually related to airports servicing important consumption markets, manufacturers of high-value goods, or distribution hubs. Global air freight activity is clustered around East Asia, North America, and Western Europe. Other clusters are around the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\n1.

Benefits may be lower inventory carrying costs and the opportunity to capture market share.A transit time of a month from point to point is quite normal for a sea freight shipment.CostAir cost higher mainly due to the capacity available on a plane, the higher fuel consumption and operational costs of a plane.A cargo ship can carry much more at once.Safety of CargoAirport regulations are controlled quite strictly and these regulations include the storage, handling and securing of your cargo.If the cargo inside the container is not packed properly, or LCL, there is a risk of cargo getting damaged.AccessibilityAshandled quicker, there may not be congestion at the airports as compared to the long queues at the sea ports. Even had, it could be solved in days.Periods of severe congestion in sea ports could happen, which brings with it its own problems of additional costs like demurrage and detention.\n\nA shipment may have various requirements regarding the mode of transport to be used, but essentially, it comes down to the nature of the freight, the time frame and how much budget.\n\nYou’d better seek a good balance between the service quality offered, cost component, the reliability of the service provider and time frame.\n\nAlso, it’s important to always keep an eye on both the air and ocean markets as both are extremely volatile. In many cases, depending on how market rates are moving and other market dynamics, one mode of transport can be chosen over the other.\n\nAir Shipping Process with CFC\n\nWe suggest you buy FOB, and let your supplier handle the inland trucking to the airport.
