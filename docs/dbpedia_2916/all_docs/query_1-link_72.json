        "text": "45 years after its debut, Mercedes-Benz is now presenting a heavily revised G-Class: The new model generation scores points with improved performance and added digitalization.\n\nThe exterior of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class has not changed significantly for around 45 years. The exterior design of the new models is also only subtly modified. Visible changes include a radiator grille with four instead of the previous three horizontal slats and front and rear bumpers. At the same time, the front bumpers have been given a new grille look. A new A-pillar trim and a spoiler lip on the roof trim are intended to contribute to improved aerodynamics and increased noise comfort. The new models come as standard with aerodynamically optimized, 45.7 cm (18\") light-alloy wheels in a 5-twin-spoke design and LED high-performance headlights.\n\nNew Six-Cylinder In-Line Petrol Engine in the G 500\n\nIn addition to the new performance off-roader from Mercedes-AMG, the Mercedes-Benz G 450 d and the Mercedes-Benz G 500 are also available. All engines are now fully electrified. As mild hybrids with 48 V technology, they are designed to offer increased performance with reduced fuel consumption. The first fully electric variant of the G-Class will complete the model portfolio at a later date.\n\nThe new Mercedes-Benz G 500 is powered by a 3.0-liter six-cylinder in-line engine with twin turbocharging by an exhaust gas turbocharger and an electric auxiliary compressor. The petrol engine produces 330 kW (449 hp) and provides a maximum torque of 560 Nm. The integrated starter generator (ISG) briefly delivers an additional 15 kW (20 hp) of power and 200 Nm of torque. It also feeds the 48 V on-board electrical system. The range of engines is completed by the six-cylinder diesel in the new Mercedes-Benz G 450 d. The unit delivers 270 kW (+15 kW) (367 hp + 20 hp). The torque is 750 (+200) Nm. Power transmission is provided by the 9G-Tronic torque converter automatic transmission, which is specially adapted to the requirements of the off-road vehicle.\n\nThe top model is the Mercedes-AMG G 63, which is powered by the tried-and-tested AMG 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine. It delivers 430 kW (585 hp) and provides a maximum torque of 850 Nm. A new feature is the combination with 48 V technology and an ISG. This electrification provides an additional 15 kW (20 hp) of boost power and 200 Nm of torque for a short time. The new Mercedes-AMG G 63 should need 4.4 seconds to accelerate from a standstill to 100 km/h. The dynamic propulsion extends to a governed top speed of 220 km/h. In conjunction with the optionally available AMG Performance Package, 240 km/h and acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.3 s are possible.\n\nNew Off-Road Cockpit\n\nThe interior is luxurious and functional. The new G-Class has also become more digital. The MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) infotainment system with a 31.2 cm (12.3\") driver and media display including touch control is on board for the first time in all model variants. Keyless-Go, temperature-controlled cup holders, the Burmester 3D surround sound system and the MBUX high-end rear-seat entertainment system are available as options for greater comfort.\n\nThe newly designed off-road control unit takes drivers directly to the new off-road cockpit. It provides an overview of the most important, relevant data for off-road driving in both the driver and media display. It also offers functions to support off-road driving. The \"Transparent hood\" function can be called up via the off-road menu in the central display. In conjunction with the 360° camera, it enables a virtual view under the front of the vehicle.\n\nOn-Road and Off-Road Driving Characteristics Further Developed\n\nThe off-road vehicle continues to rely on the ladder frame concept, three mechanical differential locks and the combination of independent wheel suspension with double wishbone front axle and rigid rear axle. The climbing ability remains up to 100 % on suitable surfaces, while the ground clearance between the axles is at least 241 mm. The maximum fording depth is 70 cm for water and mud passages, whereby the vehicle remains stable on slopes of 35 degrees. The slope angle is 31 degrees at the front and 30 degrees at the rear (without trailer coupling). The vehicle has a length of 4,825 mm (AMG: 4,873 mm), a width of 1,931 mm (without mirrors, AMG: 1,984 mm) and a height of 2,042 mm (with roof rack, AMG 1971 mm). The wheelbase is 2,890 mm. The roof load is 150 kg in each case. The towing capacity is 3,500 kg braked and 750 kg unbraked.\n\nThe new G-Class comes as standard with the suspension including adaptive adjustable damping, which was only available as an optional extra in the previous models. The familiar electromechanical rack-and-pinion steering is included as standard. An electric parking brake is fitted as standard.\n\nAdditional Driving Programs: \"Trail\", \"Rock\" and \"Sand\"\n\nWith Dynamic Select, the vehicle characteristics can also be adjusted in the new G-Class. The system changes the driving characteristics of the engine, transmission, chassis, ESP and steering on request. The on-road driving programs \"Comfort\", \"Sport\", \"Eco\" and \"Individual\" are available.\n\nThree further driving programs are available in the new G-Class for off-road driving. \"Trail\" offers optimized handling on light terrain with loose surfaces, such as dirt tracks or gravel. The \"Rock\" drive program is designed for driving on medium and difficult, uneven terrain with hard, rocky surfaces. The chassis set-up and steering settings are designed to be firm. As a third off-road option, \"Sand\" offers improved driving dynamics through agilizing control interventions. The ESP is specially tuned for sandy surfaces.\n\nThe G-Class also offers additional and enhanced safety and assistance systems. The range of customization options for the exterior and interior of the new G-Class has been extended once again. At market launch, the new G-Class is available at a price starting at 122,808 euros."
