        "text": "Whether scaling snow-capped mountains peaks or elevating client strategies, Cissy Lu, JAS China's Country Head of Sales, always sets her sights beyond the horizon.\n\nNavigating the complex landscape of global logistics, Cissy Lu has carved out a remarkable path to become the Chief Commercial Officer of JAS China. Her journey is a testament to the power of curiosity, adaptability, and passion for customer growth.\n\nFrom Humble Beginnings to Global Reach\n\nCissy's career began without a clear roadmap, driven only by a desire to work in sales. Her entry into the logistics world came through an organization specializing in courier services, where she first experienced the adventure of working for a company with global reach. \"Logistics and supply chain management was a new concept for China when I started my career,\" Lu recalls. \"I found the prospect exciting, especially working with an American company with a global footprint.\"\n\nHowever, Lu's appetite for learning and growth soon led her to seek deeper experiences in the industry. She accepted a new role where she honed her skills in account management and branch leadership. This move allowed her to dive deeper into creating tailored solutions for customers â a passion that would define her career.\n\nThe Power of Perspective: Big and Small\n\nLu's career path is marked by strategic moves between large corporations and smaller, specialized firms. Looking for a new challenge, she joined a company specializing in food, beverage, and spirits transportation. This shift allowed her to combine her commercial expertise with people management skills in a more focused environment.\n\n\"Working for smaller companies, you don't have the resources that the 'giants' do,\" Lu explains. \"You have to manage the customers yourself and strategize more.\" This experience proved invaluable when she joined JAS in April 2022, bringing her strategic thinking to a larger platform.\n\nLeadership in Action: Making the Impossible Possible\n\nLu's leadership philosophy is rooted in action and adaptability. \"Learning by doing\" is her approach, emphasizing that leadership styles evolve with experience. She advocates for situational leadership, stressing the importance of emotional intelligence and personal connections.\n\nHer mantra, \"Make the impossible possible and always have a contingency plan,\" came into play when she started at JAS during the Shanghai lockdown. Undeterred, Lu saw it as an opportunity to build rapport with her team, encouraging everyone to turn on their cameras during virtual meetings â a move that challenged cultural norms but fostered closer connections.\n\nChampioning Women in Logistics\n\nWhen asked about working in a male-dominated industry, Lu offers a balanced perspective. \"Men and women have a good balance and are complementary to each other,\" she states. \"It shouldn't be a 'one is better than another' situation.\" Her leadership at JAS China is a testament to this belief, with women comprising a significant portion of the operations staff.\n\nThe Horizon Strategy: Elevating Customer Devotion\n\nUnder Lu's guidance, the China office has implemented the \"Horizon Strategy,\" focusing on people, customer devotion, and tailor-made solutions. Her approach to upleveling customer service is both practical and inspiring. \"Every idea doesn't have to be a big idea,\" she tells her team, \"But it does have to show that you're willing to go the extra mile.\""
