        "text": "Shipping products seems simple, right? You simply package the product and send it to your customer. But did you know there are different types of shipment?\n\nDepending on the size of your shipment, it may be considered parcel, less-than-load (LTL) or a full truckload (FTL) shipment. Your shipment may be too small for certain carriers, or conversely, if you have a large shipment, you may have to rely on a carrier certified to ship large containers. There are also unique considerations depending on the mode of transport—whether you’re shipping via air, sea, road or rail.\n\nScores of exporters who use Shipping Solutions Export Documentation and Compliance Software have told us that the wide variety of terms that relate to the process of moving goods through a supply chain seem overwhelming. But understanding the different types of shipment and related terms is crucial to ensure your goods get shipped on time, within compliance and in good shape.\n\nThat's why we've provided this glossary of international shipping terms.\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W\n\nACE\n\nThe Automated Commercial Environment is the online web portal used to report data to the Automated Export System (AES) for exports leaving the United States, and also for customs filing for imports entering the United States.\n\nAdvance Payment\n\nSee Cash in Advance.\n\nAES\n\nThe Automated Export System is used by the U.S. government to collect data on exports. This data is called Electronic Export Information (EEI), and in many cases, exporters are legally required to file the EEI through AES for each shipment. The U.S. Census Bureau uses this data to calculate trade statistics such as gross domestic product (GDP), while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses it to make sure exporters are following U.S. export regulations. See also: Filing through AESDirect: 20 Terms Exporters Need to Know.\n\nAggregate Shipment\n\nMultiple shipments—from different sellers to a single consignee—that are consolidated by the carrier into a single shipment.\n\nAir Waybill (AWB)\n\nThe AWB is a document that controls the routing of an exporter’s cargo while it is in the hands of the air carrier or a consolidator. It is a contract for carriage; however, it cannot be negotiated.\n\nALADI\n\nThe Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) is an international association of Latin American countries. Its function in Latin America is comparable to the function of the former European Economic Community—which has now become embedded in the framework of the European Union—in Europe. The goal of ALADI is to harmonize trade across the member states. There are currently 13 member countries representing a population of more than 500 million people. ALADI has its own commodity classification system similar to the global Harmonized System (HS).\n\nAlongside\n\nRefers to the side of a ship. Goods delivered alongside are placed on the dock or barge within reach of the ship’s rigging so it can be easily loaded onto the ship.

A government agency may audit a company’s processes or records as part of an investigation related to a potential compliance violation. In some industries, companies must pass periodic government audits to maintain their authorizations. Companies may also conduct internal audits (self-audit), or hire a third party to audit their processes. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the export control arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, recommends that U.S. exporters periodically self-audit to ensure compliance procedures are working properly and are up-to-date with regulation changes. Auditability refers to the capacity of an auditor to audit an auditee. Sloppy record-keeping lowers auditability. An audit trail is a system (physical or electronic) that keeps track of business processes. See also: 4 Reasons to Audit Your Company’s Export Procedures.\n\nAudit Trail\n\nA system that stores and maintains records of business processes. With regards to exporting, companies are strongly encouraged to maintain an audit trail documenting their compliance screenings in order to demonstrate due diligence in case of an audit.

See also: The Chamber of Commerce and Export Documents: The Certificate of Origin.\n\nChamber Stamp\n\nCertain documents (such as certificates of origin) require a stamp from a U.S. chamber of commerce to be considered valid.
