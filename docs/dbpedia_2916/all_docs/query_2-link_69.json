        "text": "A\n\nAIR WAYBILL\n\nAn air waybill (AWB) or air consignment note is a receipt issued by an international airline for goods and an evidence of the contract of carriage, but it is not a document of title to the goods. Hence, the air waybill is non-negotiable.\n\nThe air waybill is the most important document issued by a carrier either directly or through its authorised agent. It is a non-negotiable transport document. It covers transport of cargo from airport to airport. By accepting a shipment an IATA cargo agent is acting on behalf of the carrier whose air waybill is issued.\n\nAir waybills have eleven digit numbers, which can be used to make bookings, check the status of delivery, and check the current position of the shipment.\n\nThe number consists of:\n\n1. The first three digits are the airline prefix. Each airline has been assigned a 3-digit number by IATA, so from the prefix we know which airline has issued the document.\n\n2. The next seven digits are the running number/s - one number for each consignment.\n\n3. The last digit is what is called the check digit. It is arrived at in the following manner:\n\nThe seven digit running numbers are divided by 7, by using a long division calculation. The remainder becomes the check digit. That is why no AWB number ends with a figure greater than 6. Air waybills are issued in 8 sets of different colours. The first three copies are classified as originals. The first original, Green in colour, is the Issuing Carrier's copy. The second, coloured Pink, is the Consignee's Copy. The third, coloured Blue, is the Shipper's copy. A fourth Brown copy acts as the Delivery Receipt, or proof of delivery. The other three copies are white.\n\nA.TR CERTIFICATE\n\nThe ATR.1 Certificate is a customs document used in trade between EU members and Turkey, to benefit from cheaper rates of duty. The legal basis for the use of the certificate is the EU-Turkey Customs Union. It is important to remember that not all products are included in the customs union. Products not included in the customs union are steel & coal and some agricultural products. Many of these are instead included in the EU-Turkey FTA.\n\nIt is also worthwhile to note that the ATR.1 certificate is not a certificate of origin, but rather a status certificate. It therefore certifies that the product has been put in free circulation either in the EU or in Turkey, which means that the product had gone through the importation procedure in either country.\n\nAD VALOREM\n\nLatin for “according to value.” An ad valorem duty is an import duty based on the value of an article as defined in customs law of a particular country, instead of weight or volume. A percentage of that value is charged, for example, 5% ad valorem. A freight rate set at a certain percentage of the value of an article is known as an ad valorem rate.\n\nADVISING BANK\n\nAn advising bank (also known as a notifying bank) advises an exporter that a letter of credit opened by an issuing bank for an importer is available. Advising Bank's responsibility is to authenticate the letter of credit issued by the issuer to avoid fraud. The advising bank is not necessarily responsible for the payment of the credit, which it advises the exporter of. The advising bank is usually located in the exporter’s country. It may be a branch office of the issuing bank or a bank appointed by the importer. The important point is the exporter has to be comfortable with the advising bank.\n\nThe issuing bank often sends the Letter of Credit through its branch office to avoid fraud. The branch office maintains specimen signature(s) on file where it may counter-check the signature(s) on the Letter of Credit. It has a coding system (a secret test key) to distinguish a genuine Letter of Credit from a fraudulent one.\n\nThe exporter can also request the importer to specify his/her bank as the advising bank in a Letter of Credit application. In many countries, this is beneficial to the exporter, who may avail the reduced bank charges and fees because of special relationships with the bank. Under normal circumstances, advising charges is standard and minimal. In addition, it is more convenient to deal with the exporters own bank over a bank with which the exporter does not maintain an account\n\nAHT (ANCHOR-HANDLING TUG)\n\nMoves anchors and tow drilling vessels, lighters and similar.\n\nAHTS (ANCHOR-HANDLING TUG/SUPPLY)\n\nCombined supply and anchor-handling ship. Seismic ship: Conducts seismic surveys to map geological structures beneath the seabed.\n\nAUTOMATED MANIFEST SYSTEM (AMS)\n\nAn electronic system allowing a manifest inventory to be transmitted to customs and excise.\n\nB\n\nBILL OF LADING\n\nA bill of lading, sometimes abbreviated as B/L or BoL is a document issued by a carrier which details a shipment of merchandise and gives title of that shipment to a specified party. Bills of lading are one of three important documents used in international trade to help guarantee that exporters receive payment and importers receive merchandise. A straight bill of lading is used when payment has been made in advance of shipment and requires a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the appropriate party. An order bill of lading is used when shipping merchandise prior to payment, requiring a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the importer, and at the endorsement of the exporter the carrier may transfer title to the importer. Endorsed order bills of lading can be traded as a security or serve as collateral against debt obligations.\n\nBIP (Border Inspection Post)\n\nControl post operated by the Port Health Authorities\n\nBUNKER ADJUSTMENT FACTOR (BAF)\n\nThe Bunker Adjustment Factor, or BAF, as it is more commonly known, is one of the charges levied on goods transported via Sea Freight. This particular charge represents the fluctuating costs to the shipping, as an example varying global oil prices. Also known as a Bunker Surcharge.\n\nBTI (Binding Tariff Information)\n\nFormal classification of an item / product to a specific Customs commodity code for your goods. Samples are sent to Customs for them to assess and advise the Commodity Code\n\nBACKFREIGHT\n\nThe owners of a ship are entitled to payment as freight for merchandise returned through the fault of either the consignees or the consignors. Such payment, which is over and above the normal freight, is called Backfreight.\n\nBACKLETTER\n\nWhere a seller/shipper issues a ‘letter of indemnity’ in favour of the carrier in exchange for a clean bill of lading.\n\nBILL OF SIGHT\n\nA written description of goods given by an importer to a customs officer in the event shipping documents have not arrived in time and the importer wishes to avoid delayed entry charges. When an importer enters goods on a bill of sight, he usually must make a cash deposit covering the estimated amount of duty. When the shipping documents are received and a correct entry is made, the exact amount of duty is levied.\n\nBLACK CARGO\n\nCargo banned by general cargo workers for some reason. This ban could be because the cargo is dangerous or hazardous to health.\n\nBONDED WAREHOUSE\n\nA warehouse authorised by customs and excise authorities for storage of goods on which payment of duties is deferred until the goods are removed.\n\nBREAK BULK\n\nThe process of assimilating many small shipments into one large shipment at a central point so that economies of scale may be achieved; to commence discharge of cargo.\n\nBREAKBULK CARGO\n\nCargo, which is shipped as a unit, for example, palletised cargo, boxed cargo, large machinery, and trucks.\n\nBULK CARGO\n\nLoose cargo that is loaded directly into a ship’s hold.\n\nBULK CARRIER\n\nThere are two types of bulk carriers, the dry-bulk carrier, and the liquid-bulk carrier, better known as a tanker. Bulk cargo is a shipment such as oil, grain, or one which is not packaged, bundled, bottled, or otherwise packed and is loaded without counting or marking.\n\nC\n\nCERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN\n\nA certificate of origin, often abbreviated as C/O, COO, is a document used in international trade. In a printed form or as an electronic document, it is completed by the exporter and certified by a recognised issuing body, attesting that the goods in a particular export shipment have been produced, manufactured or processed in a particular country.\n\nCHIEF (Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight)\n\nHM Revenue & Customs computer system.\n\nCUSTOMS CLEARANCE\n\nCustoms Clearance, Customs broking or customs brokerage is a profession that involves the \"clearing\" of goods through HM Revenue & Customs for importers and exporters. This involves the preparation of documents and/or electronic submissions, the calculation and payment of taxes, duties and excises. and facilitating communication between government authorities and importers and exporters. Custom brokers may be employed by or affiliated with freight forwarders, shipping lines, importers or exporters.\n\nCURRENCY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR (CAF)\n\nThe currency adjustment factor (CAF) is a fee placed on top of freighting charges. The charge was developed to account for constantly changing exchange rates between foreign currencies. Thus its goal is to offset any losses from constantly fluctuating exchange rates. The CAF increases as the US dollar decreases. It is applied as a percentage on top of the Base Exchange rate, which is calculated as the average exchange rate for the previous three months. Due to this added charge, shippers tend to enter into \"all inclusive\" contracts at one price, that accounts for all applicable charges, to limit the effect of the CAF.\n\nC.I.F.\n\nCost, Insurance and Freight: Export term in which the price quoted by the exporter includes the costs of ocean transportation to the port of destination and insurance coverage.\n\nCABOTAGE\n\nThe carriage of goods or passengers for remuneration taken on at one point and discharged at another point within the territory of the same country.\n\nOr, Where cargo is carried on what is essentially a domestic flight and therefore not subject to international agreements that fixes set rates. Cabotage rates are negotiable between shipper and airline and apply on flights within a country and to its overseas territories.\n\nCARGO INSURANCE\n\nInsurance to protect the financial interest of the cargo owner during transportation in case of a loss.\n\nCARGO PREFERENCE\n\nReserving a portion of a nation’s imports and exports to national-flag vessels.\n\nCARGO RECEIPT\n\nReceipt of cargo for shipment by a consolidator (used in ocean freight).\n\nCARGO RETENTION CLAUSES\n\nClauses introduced by charterer’s based on shortage of delivered cargo because of increased oil prices.\n\nCARNET\n\nA document allowing the importation of certain goods to countries without paying customs duty.\n\nThree types exist:\n\nATA Carnet - for temporary importation of goods and equipment\n\nCarnet de Passages - for motor vehicles\n\nTIR Carnet - to simplify administrative formalities of transit commercial goods carried by international road transport\n\nCARRIER\n\nAny person who, through a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or procure the performance of carriage by rail, road, sea, air, inland waterway, or by a combination of modes.\n\nOr, Owners or operators of vessels providing transportation to shippers. The term is also used to refer to the vessels.\n\nCARTEL\n\nAn association of several independent national or international business organisations that regulates competition by controlling the prices, the production, or the marketing of a product or industry\n\nCERTIFICATE OF INSPECTION\n\nA certificate usually required for industrial equipment and meat products.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF MANUFACTURE\n\nA document used under a letter of credit containing an affidavit that goods have been manufactured and are being held for the account and risk of the buyer. In war times when transportation facilities are disrupted, it is common for letters of credit to be paid against presentation of a certificate of manufacture. This is rare in ordinary times, except in the case of specially manufactured goods.\n\nCFR – Cost and Freight\n\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship in the country of Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer does require the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerised seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT\n\nCFS (Container Freight Station)\n\nThe term CFS at loading port means the location designated by carriers for the receiving of cargo to be packed into containers by the carrier. At discharge ports, the term CFS means the bonded location designated by carriers in the port area for unpacking and delivery of cargo.\n\nCFS CHARGE (Container Freight Charge)\n\nThe charge assessed for services performed at the loading or discharging port in the packing or unpacking of cargo into/from containers at CFS.\n\nCIA (Cash In Advance)\n\nA method of payment for goods whereby the buyer pays the seller before shipping the goods.\n\nCIF (Cost, Insurance & Freight)\n\nThis term is broadly similar to CFR term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the named port of destination. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract. CIF can be used by any transport by sea and air not limited to containerised or non-containerised cargo and includes all charges up to the port/terminal of entrance. CIP covers additional charges at the port/terminal of entrance\n\nCIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid to)\n\nThis term is broadly similar to CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract.\n\nCIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the equivalent term CIF can only be used for non-containerised seafreight\n\nCLASS RATES\n\nA class of goods or commodities is a large grouping of various items under one general heading, and all items in the group make up a class. The freight rates that apply to all items in the class are called class rates.\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nA customs term for the placement of an item under the correct number in the customs tariff for duty purposes.\n\nCOFC\n\n(container on flat car); a type of rail freight service involving the shipment of containers without chassis\n\nCOGSA\n\nCarriage of Goods by Sea\n\nCONGESTIONS\n\nPort/berth delays\n\nCONSIGNEE\n\nThe receiver of freight shipped by the shipper or, The individual or company to whom a seller or shipper sends merchandise and who, upon presentation of necessary documents, is recognised as the merchandise owner for the purpose of declaring and paying customs duties.\n\nThe person to whom cargo is consigned as stated on the bills of lading.\n\nCONSIGNMENT\n\nThe physical transfer of goods from a seller (consignor) with whom the title remains until the goods are sold, to another legal entity (consignee) that acts as a selling agent. Only if there is a subsequent sale does the seller receive any payment.\n\nCONSIGNOR\n\nThe person by whom freight is shipped or a term used to describe any person who consigns goods to himself or to another party in a bill of lading or equivalent document. A consignor might be the owner of the goods, or a freight forwarder who consigns goods on behalf of his principal.\n\nThe person named in the bill of lading as the one from whom the goods have been received for shipment.\n\nCONSOLIDATED SHIPMENT\n\nAn arrangement whereby various shippers pool their boxed goods on the same shipment, sharing the total weight charge for the shipment.\n\nCONSUL\n\nA government official residing in a foreign country charged with representing the interests of his or her country and its nationals.\n\nCONSULAR DOCUMENTS\n\nSpecial forms signed by the consul of a country to which cargo is destined.\n\nCONSULAR INVOICE\n\nA document required by some countries describing a shipment of goods and showing information such as the consignor, consignee, and value of the shipment. Certified by a consular official, the countries customs officials to verify the value, quantity, and nature of the shipment use a consular invoice.\n\nCONTRACT OF AFFREIGHTMENT (COA)\n\nA service contract under which a ship owner agrees to transport a specified quantity of fuel products or speciality products, at a specified rate per ton, between designated loading and discharge ports. This type contract differs from a spot or consecutive voyage charter in that no particular vessel is specified.\n\nCOUNTERTRADE\n\nA reciprocal trading arrangement in which the seller is required to accept goods or other instruments or trade in partial or whole payment for its products. Common transactions include barter, buyback, counterpurchase, offset requirements, swap, switch; or triangular trade, evidence, or clearing accounts.\n\nCOUNTERVAILING DUTIES\n\nSpecial duties imposed on imports to offset the benefits of subsidies to producers or exporters of the exporting country.\n\nCPT (Carriage Paid To)\n\nCPT replaces the venerable C&F (cost and freight) and CFR terms for all shipping modes outside of non-containerised seafreight.\n\nThe seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named place of destination. Risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to the first carrier at the place of shipment in the country of Export. The seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named place of destination (either final destination such as buyer's facilities or port of destination has to be agreed by seller and buyer, however, named place of destination is generally picked due to cost impacts). If the buyer does require the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered\n\nCROSS-TRADES\n\nForeign-to-foreign trade carried by ships from a nation other than the two trading nations.\n\nCWO (Cash With Order)\n\nA method of payment for goods where cash is paid at the time of order and the transaction becomes binding on both buyer and seller.\n\nD\n\nDEFERMENT ACCOUNT\n\nBank account held with HM Revenue & Customs to pay Duty or VAT.\n\nDAN - Deferment Account Number.\n\nDEMURRAGE\n\nA penalty for exceeding free time allowed for loading or unloading at a port or freight terminal.

Document which must accompany hazardous cargo during transit\n\nDAF (Delivered at Frontier)\n\nThis term can be used when the goods are transported by rail and road. The seller pays for transportation to the named place of delivery at the frontier. The buyer arranges for customs clearance and pays for transportation from the frontier to his factory. The passing of risk occurs at the frontier\n\nDANGEROUS CARGO\n\nAll substances of an inflammable nature which are liable to spontaneous combustion either in themselves or when stowed adjacent to other substances and, when mixed with air, are liable to generate explosive gases or produce suffocation or poisoning or tainting of foodstuffs.\n\nDANGEROUS GOODS\n\nArticles or substances capable of posing a significant risk to health, safety or property and that ordinarily require special attention when being transported.\n\nDDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid)\n\nThis term means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer to the named place of destination in the contract of sale. A transaction in international trade where the seller is responsible for making a safe delivery of goods to a named destination, paying all transportation expenses but not the duty. The seller bears the risks and costs associated with supplying the goods to the delivery location, where the buyer becomes responsible for paying the duty and other customs clearing expenses.\n\nDAP (Delivered at Place)\n\nInco Terms 2010 defines DAP as “Delivered at Place” that the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery.\n\nOnce goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is done by seller at his own cost, so as to reach the material up to final destination safely. All necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by seller at his own cost and risk to clear the goods for export.\n\nAfter arrival of goods at the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country needs to be completed by the buyer at his own cost and risk, including all customs duties and taxes.\n\nUnder DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by seller under DAP terms. If unloading can not be carried out by the seller, it might be better to ship under DAT (Delivered At Terminal) terms instead\n\nDAT (Delivered at Terminal)\n\nThis term means that the seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until destination port or terminal. The terminal can be a Port, Airport, or inland freight interchange. Import duty/taxes/customs costs are to be borne by Buyer\n\nDEQ (Delivered Ex Quay)\n\nThis is similar to DES, but the passing of risk does not occur until the goods have been unloaded at the port of discharge\n\nDES (Delivered Ex Ship)\n\nWhere goods are delivered ex ship, the passing of risk does not occur until the ship has arrived at the named port of destination and the goods made available for unloading to the buyer. The seller pays the same freight and insurance costs as he would under a CIF arrangement. Unlike CFR and CIF terms, the seller has agreed to bear not just cost, but also Risk and Title up to the arrival of the vessel at the named port. Costs for unloading the goods and any duties, taxes, etc. are for the Buyer. A commonly used term in shipping bulk commodities, such as coal, grain, dry chemicals; and where the seller either owns or has chartered, their own vessel.\n\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid)\n\nSeller is responsible for delivering the goods to the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the non-Incoterm \"Free In Store (FIS)\". This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on the buyer. With the delivery at the named place of destination all the risks and responsibilities are transferred to the buyer and it is considered that the seller has completed his obligations\n\nDEDICATED TRAIN\n\nOne that exclusively carries intermodal equipment (containers and trailers)\n\nDIM WEIGHT (Dimensionalised Weight)\n\nAn international airfreight formula determined by calculating length x width x height and dividing by 166.

This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used when making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included. EXW means that a buyer incurs the risks for bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the goods, he does so at buyer's risk and cost. If parties wish seller to be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.\n\nThe buyer arranges the pickup of the freight from the supplier's designated ship site, owns the in-transit freight, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation.\n\nThese documentary requirements may cause two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. Secondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an Ex Works shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof, or indeed to even export the goods. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA seller's premises, may be more suitable\n\nERTS (Enhanced Remote Transit Shed)\n\nAn approved warehouse by HM Revenue & Customs, where goods can be held as “Uncleared” i.e. Duty and VAT unpaid with Non EEC status. For example, groupage (LCL) containers may be moved to these locations for devanning and then each individual shipment may be cleared by the Importers customs clearance agent.\n\nEORI Number (formerly TURN number or VAT Number)\n\nAn EORI number is a number, unique throughout the European Community,\n\nassigned by a customs authority in a Member State to economic operators\n\n(businesses) or persons. By registering for customs purposes in one Member State,\n\nan Economic Operator (EO) is able to obtain an EORI number, which is valid\n\nthroughout the Community. The EO will then use this number in all communications\n\nwith any EC customs authorities where a customs identifier is required for example\n\ncustoms declarations.\n\nEUR.1 MOVEMENT CERTIFICATE\n\nA form used for international commodity traffic, recognised as a certificate of origin. Importantly, completion entitles commodities originating from the UK or European Union to benefit from lower or zero import duty.\n\nEXPORT LICENSE\n\nA document secured from a government authorising an exporter to export a specific quantity of a particular commodity to a certain country. An export license is often required if a government has placed embargoes or other restrictions upon exports.\n\nF\n\nFCL (Full Container Load)\n\nA full container load (FCL) is an ISO standard container that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, it means that the whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.\n\nFCA (Free Carrier)\n\nThe seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named place. This can be to a carrier nominated by the buyer, or to another party nominated by the buyer.\n\nIt should be noted that the chosen place of delivery has an impact on the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place. If delivery occurs at the seller's premises, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on to the buyer's carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both unloading the goods and loading them onto their own carrier\n\nFAS (Free Alongside Ship)\n\nThe seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term can be used only for sea or inland waterway transport\n\nFOB (Free On Board)\n\nUnder FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller must also arrange for export clearance. The buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination.\n\nFAK (Freight All Kinds)\n\nA carrier’s tariff description for products pooled and all shipped at one rate. FAK cargo is usually shipped in a container filled with different merchandise or commodities.\n\nFIO\n\nFree in and out.\n\nFIOST\n\nFree in and out, stowed and trimmed\n\nFLAT CAR\n\nA freight car having a floor without any housing or body above. Frequently used to carry car trailers (TOFC) or oversized/odd-shaped commodities\n\nFLAT RACK\n\nA container without sides or frame members at the front and back. It can be loaded from the sides and top.\n\nFMC\n\nFederal Maritime Commission.\n\nFORCE MAJEURE\n\nClause limiting responsibilities of charterers, shippers and receiver of cargo\n\nOr the title of a standard clause found in marine contracts exempting the parties for nonfulfillment of their obligations by reasons of occurrences beyond their control, such as earthquakes, floods, or war.\n\nFTZ (Foreign Trade Zone)\n\nA port designated by the government for duty-free entry of any non-prohibited goods. Merchandise may be stored, displayed, and used for manufacturing within the zone and re-exported without duties being paid.
