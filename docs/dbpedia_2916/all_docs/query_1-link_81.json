        "text": "The Mercedes-Benz G Wagen hasn’t changed all that much over the last 45 years. Sure, the truck is more luxurious and expensive than ever before, but it still embraces its off-roading mission with a familiar face. Mercedes has updated the G550 and G63 lineups for the 2025 model year, bringing new hybridized powertrains, slight styling adjustments, new active safety features and a suite of improved off-road technologies. Here’s everything you need to know about the new Gs.\n\nDespite calling them all-new, the 2025 Mercedes-Benz G550 and Mercedes-AMG G63 models are still based on the same updated platform that first arrived for the 2019 model year. At the center of the vehicle sits a ladder frame, which gets independent front suspension and a solid rear-axle. The previous model’s three mechanically locking differentials also return for 2025, which work with the truck’s all-time four-wheel drive system.\n\nThe first major change for 2025 comes under the hood, where the G550 model loses its twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine. The standard G Wagen will now come equipped with Mercedes’ turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six engine, which utilizes both a gas-driven turbocharger and an electric compressor. The setup provides 443 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque, and is further bolstered by a 48v mild hybrid system via an integrated starter generator. That system will add an additional 20 hp and 148 lb-ft at low engine speeds, ensuring smoothing and consistent power delivery.\n\nIt’s a shame to see the V-8 engine go, which provided only 416 hp, but a meaningful 450 lb-ft.\n\nYou will have to pony up for the AMG model to get the V-8 experience in 2025, as the G63 receives a mild hybrid variant of the 4.0-liter V-8. The twin-turbocharged V-8 is good for 577 hp and 627 lb-ft, which is identical to the current model. The AMG shares the integrated starter generator setup with the G550, which provides the same low-end boost. Mercedes says the G63 is capable of 0-60 mph in just 4.2 seconds, with a limited top speed of 137 mph. The G550 will do 130 mph before the limiter kicks in. The trucks are offered with a wide range of wheel options, which range from 18- to 22-inches depending on your model and package selections.\n\nAMG customers will also have the option to spec the Active Ride Control system for the first time as part of the AMG Off-Road Package Pro. This suspension package forgoes traditional anti-roll bars in favor of a hydraulic roll stabilization, and includes hydraulic dampers with individual controls for rebound and compression. The dampers at all four corners are also tied together via the hydraulic lines, allowing for precise control of every wheel. Not only does this system make the G63 more comfortable off-road, it also provides improved wheel articulation and traction. The AMG Off-Road Package Pro also brings unique drive modes to the G63, including AMG Traction PRO and AMG Active Balance Control. The former uses the brakes to shift torque around on varied surfaces for maximum tire traction, paired with adjustable degrees of differential locking. AMG Active Balance Control lets owners adjust the roll stiffness of the hydraulic suspension in all three of the SUV’s off-road driving modes, with Low, Mid and High settings. Both the G550 and the G63 come with adjustable adaptive dampers as standard equipment.\n\nOther off-road goodies coming to the G Wagen lineup in 2025 include Mercedes’ new Off-Road Cockpit feature. This new infotainment feature reorganizes all of your critical off-road vehicle information into one place. The system will highlight key metrics such as vehicle angle, a compass, altitude, steering angle, tire pressure, and temperature. The screen will also show your differential positions, and will allow easy access to a number of other off-roading features. This will include the transparent hood feature, which allows you to see under the vehicle by way of the 360 degree camera setup. If off-roading isn’t your thing, Mercedes will also offer the G Wagen with active safety features for the first time, including Active Steering Assist, Active Emergency Stop Assist, and a Route-Based Speed Adaptation system.\n\nOther tweaks for the 2025 model year include slight facia adjustments at the front and rear, including a new front grill with an additional louver. You’ll also notice a few aero adjustments, including near the A-pillars and the roof-mounted spoiler. Mercdedes says these will help to improve efficiency while cutting back on some wind noise on the road. Customers seeking a bespoke vehicle also will have more options via the Manufaktur program, including the addition of exclusive paint colors and extended leather options. A rear seat entertainment system is also on offer for 2025, which includes a pair of 11.6-inch touch displays. Up front there’s also a dash camera option, which can be used to record off-roading adventures or untimely accidents. The system even allows for playback right on the infotainment screen.\n\nMercedes has yet to share pricing information for either G Class model at this time, but don’t expect them to be anything less than pricey. Expect prices for the G550 to start around $145,000, whereas the AMG will ring closer to $185,000 to start. That’s a lot of cash, but there is undeniably a lot of capability baked into these iconic crawlers, mall or otherwise."
