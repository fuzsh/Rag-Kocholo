        "text": "Overview\n\nGive Mercedes-Benz credit for orchestrating the G-class SUV's transition from a one-time military transporter to a revered luxury icon. The 2025 G550 shares a silhouette and all-terrain competence with the spartan 1979 original, but its six-figure price tag, highly customizable nature, and a plethora of luxury gear push it close to the ultra-lux realm occupied by vehicles such as the Bentley Bentayga and the Mercedes-Maybach GLS600. The G's impressive off-road capability comes with a compromise to its on-road handling, however. The G550 isn't exactly crude when being used to commute or road-trip, but you can never quite forget its truckish nature. A turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six makes 443 horsepower and is mated to a nine-speed automatic and standard all-wheel drive. More serious off-roaders can add all sorts of journey-enhancing equipment; the G Professional model, for example, features meaty tires, an adaptive suspension system, and fancy-but-rugged trim and upholstery. Even so, many buyers will choose a G-class for its unique style and the status-heightening effect that such ownership brings. For an even more audacious G, check out the performance-focused Mercedes-AMG G63, which we review separately.\n\nWhat's New for 2025?\n\nThe G-class is getting more aerodynamic for 2025. No, it isn't morphing into a curvy crossover à la the EQS SUV, but subtle styling revisions are intended to help the G550 cut through the air a little easier. (They'll be shared with the new electric version of the G.) The grille, front bumper, and A-pillars have all been reshaped, and a little spoiler on the roof's leading edge helps direct air up and over the SUV. The biggest change is under the hood where the 2024 model's V-8 engine has been swapped out in favor of a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six with a 48-volt hybrid system. Horsepower is up—to 443 ponies—but torque is down slightly; acceleration performance should be similar though. Inside, the MBUX infotainment interface takes up residency on the G550's dashboard. The updated software provides more connectivity, including an optional rear-seat entertainment system with two 11.6-inch displays that can stream video or browse the web. Elsewhere, a new 360-degree camera system can show the driver what's underneath the G-class, more personalization options have been added to the Manufaktur program, and an adaptive cruise control system with a lane-centering feature is now available.\n\nPricing and Which One to Buy\n\nThe price of the 2025 Mercedes-Benz G-class is expected to start around $149,400 and go up to $175,000 depending on the trim and options.\n\nG 550\n\n$149,400\n\nG550\n\n$150,000 (est)\n\nG550 Exclusive\n\n$155,000 (est)\n\nG550 Manufaktur\n\n$160,000 (est)\n\nG550 Exclusive Plus\n\n$165,000 (est)\n\nG550 Manufaktur Plus\n\n$170,000 (est)\n\nG550 G Professional\n\n$175,000 (est)\n\nWith a starting price of around $150k, it's a good bet that most buyers won't be too concerned about ponying up for a few options. Still, the sheer number and cost of those extras is dizzying. Our feeling is that buyers are best served by enhancing a G550 with thoughtful choices like the Exclusive trim, which adds the nicer nappa leather upholstery and snazzier trim pieces. The Seat Comfort package includes massaging front seats with ventilated cushions, and we'd add the heated steering wheel, too. The only other option we recommend is the available adaptive dampers that allow the driver to dial in the ride quality.\n\nEngine, Transmission, and Performance\n\nAll G550s now come with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six with 443 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque. A 48-volt hybrid system helps out but doesn't provide any electric-only driving range. The powertrain sends its torque to the wheels via a nine-speed automatic transmission; all-wheel drive is standard, as are the famed triple differential locks (front, center, and rear) and low-range. In our initial test drive, the new inline-six engine performed admirably but lacked the distinctive sound of a V-8 that we had become accustomed to as part of the G-wagen experience. Still, the current generation boasts much-improved road manners compared with the outgoing generation, thanks to an independent front suspension and a lower center of gravity. Whereas the previous model leaned into corners with comical abandon, the newer model at least tries to pivot without scraping the door handles on the pavement. The new-generation G550's steering feels more precise, and the ride quality is composed on all but the choppiest surfaces. The most recent G we've tested is the G550 Professional, which comes with 18-inch wheels wrapped in all-terrain tires rather than the standard model's 19s and all-season rubber, and this package will return for the 2025 model.\n\n0–60-MPH Times\n\nWe haven't tested the 2025 G550 yet, and since it has a new engine this year our older performance testing doesn't apply. Mercedes estimates that the new model will hit 60 mph in 5.3 seconds. When we get a chance, we'll take the G550 to our test track and update this story with the results.\n\nTowing and Payload Capacity\n\nThe G550 has a maximum towing capacity of 7716 pounds, impressive considering the larger Mercedes-Benz GLS580 and a similarly equipped Cadillac Escalade are rated for a maximum of 7700 pounds.\n\nFuel Economy and Real-World MPG\n\nThe G550 has many charms, but fuel efficiency is not one of them. Even with its new six-cylinder powertrain, we aren't expecting a sharp increase in the SUV's EPA estimates. When we get a chance, we'll take the G500 on our 75-mph highway fuel economy route—part of our extensive testing regimen—and update this story with real-world results. For more information about the G-class's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.\n\nInterior, Comfort, and Cargo\n\nStanding in contrast to the G-Wagen's paramilitary transport-vehicle exterior is a fully outfitted luxury interior. Standard features include a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, heated front and rear seats with leather upholstery, a power-adjustable steering column, three-zone automatic climate control, a sunroof, and three 12v power outlets. With the check of a few option boxes, buyers can enjoy massaging front seats with ventilation, a heated steering wheel, and nappa leather upholstery. The G Manufaktur options offer the most opulent aesthetic including unique upholstery choices, but they cost a considerable amount of money. While there's no shortage of headroom in the front or rear seats, the G-class is still essentially a very luxurious and well-equipped box; the instrument panel and infotainment screen are positioned nearly vertically, the driving position is almost bus-like, and the large, flat glass areas occasionally shoot alarming reflections across the cabin. You'll never mistake the experience for the palatial vibe of other high-end SUVs such as the Bentley Bentayga or the Rolls-Royce Cullinan—but the G550 has every bit as much presence. It also has tons of cargo space. The version we tested held 16 carry-on suitcases behind its back row and another 17 bags with those seats folded (33 total).\n\nInfotainment and Connectivity\n\nA standard 12.3-inch infotainment display takes center stage on the G550's near-vertical dashboard, and on it is Mercedes's latest MBUX software. Navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and a Burmester stereo system are all standard. Those looking for further upgrades can add a rear-seat entertainment system that provides passengers a chance to stream video content, interact with the infotainment system, or browse the web.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Features\n\nThe G-class has a slew of standard driver-assistance technology such as blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, speed limit assist, lane-keeping assist, and self-parking assist. A more advanced adaptive cruise control system with a lane-centering feature is optional. For more information about the G550's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:\n\nStandard automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection\n\nStandard lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist\n\nAvailable adaptive cruise control with a lane-centering feature\n\nWarranty and Maintenance Coverage\n\nMercedes-Benz provides a competitive limited and powertrain warranty that aligns with other luxury automakers. However, the company doesn't offer any complimentary scheduled maintenance.\n\nLimited warranty covers four years or 50,000 miles\n\nPowertrain warranty covers four years or 50,000 miles\n\nNo complimentary scheduled maintenance"
