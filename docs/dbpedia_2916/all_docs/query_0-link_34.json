        "text": "It is the result of vertical forces acting on a ship because of local differences between weight and buoyancy. The total of these forces should be zero; otherwise a change of draft will occur. At sea the bending moment will change as a result of wave impact which then periodically changes the buoyancy distribution.\n\nNote: The maximum allowed bending moment of a vessel is restricted by the class bureau to certain limits, which are different under port and sea conditions.\n\nThe Bill of Health is the certificate issued by local medical authorities indicating the general health conditions in the port of departure or in the ports of call. The Bill of Health must have been communicated before departure by the Consul of the country of destination.\n\nWhen a vessel has 'free pratique' (i.e. a clean bill of health), this means that the vessel has a clean Bill of Health certifying that there is no question of contagious disease and that all quarantine regulations have been complied with, so that people may embark and disembark.\n\nConsumption Entry Form required by U.S. Customs for importing goods into the United States. The form contains information as to the origin of the cargo, a description of the merchandise and estimated duties applicable to the particular commodity. Estimated duties must be paid at the time the entry is filled.\n\nImmediate Delivery Entry is used to expedite clearance of cargo. It allows up to ten days for the payment of estimated duty and processing of the consumption entry. In addition, it permits the delivery of the cargo prior to payment of the estimated duty and then allows for the subsequent filing of the consumption entry and duty. Also known as an ID entry.\n\nImmediate Transportation Entry allows the cargo to be moved from the pier to an inland destination via a bonded carrier without the payment of duties or finalisation of the entry at the port of arrival. Known as an IT entry.\n\nTransportation and Exportation Entry allows goods coming from or going to a third country, such as Canada or Mexico, to enter the United States for the purpose of transshipment. Known as a T&E entry.\n\nVessel Repair Entry is the law known as the \"Foreign Vessel Repair Statute\". It provides that when any repairs in a foreign country are made on a vessel documented under the laws of the United States, an ad valorem duty of 50% is imposed on the cost of repair, including labour and labour costs, when the vessel arrives in the United States. All equipment, parts or materials purchased, and repairs made outside the United States must be declared on Customs Form 226 (CF-226) and filed at the port of first arrival within 5 working days.\n\nA term in international commercial law specifying at what point respective obligations, costs, and risk involved in the delivery of goods shift from the seller to the buyer under the Incoterms standard published by the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\nFree on board indicates whether the seller or the buyer is liable for goods that are damaged or destroyed during shipping. When used with an identified physical location, the designation determines which party has responsibility for the payment of the freight charges and at what point title for the shipment passes from the seller to the buyer.\n\nIn international shipping, for example, “FOB [name of originating port]” means that the seller (consignor) is responsible for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment and the cost of loading. The buyer (consignee) pays the costs of ocean freight, insurance, unloading, and transportation from the arrival port to the final destination. The seller passes the risk to the buyer when the goods are loaded at the originating port.\n\nGeneral Average is defined in the York-Antwerp rules as: There is a General Average act when, and only when, any extraordinary sacrifice expenditure is intentionally and reasonably made or incurred for the common safety for the purpose of preserving from peril the property involved in a common maritime adventure. When a cargo ship encounte a serious accident at sea, e.g. a grounding, the vessel owners may ha to incur additional costs to salvage the ship and its cargo, and may resort to declaring General Average.\n\nGeneral Average requires that all parties with an interest in saving ship, the cargo, etc. share proportionately the cost of saving the common adventure . This means that cargo owners would be responsible a proportion of the costs equal to the proportion of the value of the cargo to the common adventure. General Average is applied according to an internationally acknowledged set of rules, the York-Antwerp rules.\n\nThe Incoterms® rules are a globally-recognised set of standards, used worldwide in international and domestic contracts for the delivery of goods, brought together by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). They help traders avoid costly misunderstandings by clarifying the tasks, costs and risks involved in the delivery of goods from sellers to buyers. The Incoterms® rules are recognised by UNCITRAL as the global standard for the interpretation of the most common terms in foreign trade. Incoterms® 2020 have come into effect on 1 January 2020. All contracts made under Incoterms® 2000 and any other previous editions remain valid and parties to a contract for the sale of goods can agree to choose any version of the Incoterms® rules. However, it is recommended using the most current version of the rules, Incoterms® 2020. It is important to clearly specify the chosen version.\n\nFor more information, training and app, see: https://iccwbo.org/resources-for-business/incoterms-rules/\n\nA leading indicator of future growth and is measured via a very simple but highly relevant question: “Based on your experience with Maersk, how likely are you to recommend Maersk to a business associate or colleague?\n\nCustomers are invited to score us on the above-mentioned question on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. Those who give us a score 9-10 are considered to be our Promoters. They are loyal to Maersk and will keep buying from us and refer others to us, fueling growth. Passives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic Maersk-customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings. Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can hamper growth through negative word-of-mouth. Subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters gives the Net Promoter Score. The NPS can range from -100 (every customer is a Detractor) to +100 (every customer is a Promoter).\n\nEstablished in 1964 as a permanent intergovernmental body. It is the principal organ of the United Nations General Assembly dealing with trade, investment, and development issues.\n\nThe organisation's goals are to 'maximise the trade, investment and development opportunities of developing countries and assist them in their efforts to integrate into the world economy on an equitable basis.'\n\nThe creation of the conference was based on concerns of developing countries over the international market, multi-national corporations, and great disparity between developed nations and developing nations. In the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD was closely associated with the idea of a New International Economic Order (NIEO).\n\nCurrently, UNCTAD has 194 member States and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nToday, the weight of containers provided by the shippers is not always accurate, leading to accidents and posing a huge risk for the personnel, on the roads, inside the terminal, to cargo and equipment. Indeed, there were often discrepancies observed between the declared gross mass and the actual gross mass of a packed container.\n\nIn May 2014, the International Maritime Organization adopted an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regarding a mandatory container weight verification requirement on shippers. This convention applies to all containers shipments to which SOLAS amendments apply.\n\nFrom 1st July 2016, shippers will be required to provide the Verified Gross Mass (VGM) of each shipment to their ocean carrier. The responsibility is with the shipper to confirm the VGM before the carrier’s load list cut-off date.\n\nThe new SOLAS amendments introduce two main new requirements:\n\nThe shipper is responsible for providing the verified weight by stating it in the shipping document and submitting it to the master or his representative and to the terminal representative sufficiently in advance to be used in the preparation of the ship stowage plan;\n\nThe verified gross mass is a condition for loading a packed container onto a ship.\n\nIf not confirmed, the container will not be loaded on board (potential increased charges).\n\nPlease consult our FAQs to know more about VGM.\n\nMore information can be found as well at IMO (International Maritime Organization).\n\nA trucking tariff term referring to any period of time beyond the allocated Free Time that a driver has to wait while the customer loads or unloads a container. Until the Free Time period has expired a driver can wait without the customer incurring extra expenses. Waiting Time, however, is chargeable to the client.\n\nIn the event the necessary Waiting Time would be too costly, shippers may opt for a 'drag-and-drop' solution, whereas the trucker would drop the container and immediately leave. They will return to pick up the container once laden. This option is more costly than a straight load but may be a lot cheaper than paying for Waiting Time.\n\nInsurance issued by marine underwriters against war-like operations specifically described in the policy. In former times, war risk insurance was taken out only in times of war, but currently many exporters cover most of their shipments with war risk insurance as a protection against losses from derelict torpedoes and floating mines placed during former wars, and also as a safeguard against unforeseen warlike developments.\n\nIn the US, war risk insurance is written in a separate policy from the ordinary marine insurance; it is desirable to take out both policies with the same underwriter in order to avoid the ill effects of a possible dispute between underwriters as to the cause (marine peril or war peril) of a given loss.\n\nGross - The weight of the goods including packing, wrappers, or containers, internal and external. The total weight as shipped.\n\nNet - The weight of the goods themselves without the inclusion of any wrapper.\n\nTare - The weight of the packaging or container.\n\nWeight/Measurement Ton - In many cases, a rate is shown per weight/measurement ton, carrier's option. This means that the rate will be assessed on either a weight ton or measurement ton basis, whichever will yield the carrier the greater revenue. As example, the rate may be quoted on the basis of 2,240 pounds or 40 cubic feet or of one metric ton or one cubic metre.\n\nWeight Ton - There are three types of weight ton; the short ton, weighing 2,000 pounds; the long ton, weighing 2,240 pounds; and the metric ton weight 2,204.68 pounds. The last is frequently quoted for cargo being exported from Europe."
