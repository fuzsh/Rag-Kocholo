        "text": "Article content\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen is an absolute legend. One of the most capable road-worthy off-roaders anywhere on the planet, it finally got a proper redesign to bring it comprehensively into the modern era, even if it’s still shaped like a cargo container. Despite all the supplied photos depicting it in exotic locales plowing through sand and frolicking in water features, the reality is that the majority of owners will spend the majority of time in urban and suburban locales, from ritzy boutique shopping to a night on the town with valet parking.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nDon't navigate the car buying road alone!\n\nJoin our thriving community on social media and connect with other car searchers and enthusiasts.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe spent an absolutely filthy week in it, as snow and slush and salt were permanently caked on it, and there were no grand off-roading adventures for us, but this is what we learned about it in everyday driving.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\n5 Things I learned driving the G-Wagen for a week Back to video\n\nAll 10 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n1. It’s surprisingly normal to drive.\n\nMercedes did its homework when it finally redesigned the G-Wagen platform. The original had been in circulation with a variety of powertrain and engineering updates for almost 40 years, conceived as both a rugged off-roader for military and commercial applications and also as a niche recreational adventure vehicle that would be comfortable enough as a road vehicle as well. It really wasn’t, but Mercedes tried, and it still caught on as an anti-car, anti-sophisticated luxury status symbol.\n\nWith today’s technology, Mercedes has truly achieved those goals, and while we did not test the G 550’s epic off-roading chops (Lorraine Sommerfeld covered that in our First Drive) or military-grade reliability, we found its on-road manners to be incredibly friendly for something with that much capability. The independent suspension features a double-wishbone front axle in and a rigid rear axle. Despite high mounting points for the front suspension directly to the ladder frame as high as possible and a towering 270 millimetres of ground clearance, the lighter, stiffer structure and up to 100 mm of suspension travel with adaptive damping means it can be both comfortable and well-controlled. The frame beneath is a mix of high- and ultra-high-strength steel and aluminum, while the body primarily steel and the fenders, hood and doors are aluminum, the rigid platform allowing greater latitude for the adaptive suspension to accommodate bumps and rough pavement, while firming up and maintaining stability in cornering.\n\nLearn more about the cars\n\neditor's pick\n\n2024 Mercedes-Benz G-Class 2024 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2.75\n\nout of 5\n\nMSRP $183,500 to $460,500\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt’s not the kind of vehicle in which you go carving apexes, but with two turbos feeding the 4.0L V8, the G 550 puts out 416 hp and 450 lb.-ft. of torque and a burbling, intoxicating Mercedes exhaust note, so it still prompts urges of heavy throttle whenever a light turn green and the chassis holds on respectably even if you let up far too late going into turns. Colour me impressed.\n\n2. Mercedes knows how to do interiors\n\nTo be completely honest, I’ve been in a few Mercedes these past couple years that have made me doubt this. Entry-level Mercedes models and lower trims of mid-level models are redolent with plastics and “Artico” synthetic leather that makes me cringe, and even some of their iconic models are so dated that it started to seem par for the course. However, as a flagship model for Mercedes, the G-Class cuts no corners and makes no concessions to affordability. The leather is sumptuous, the seats exceptional, the plastics refined and a bit of metal weave trim make for a comfortable and attractive cabin. It only gets better at night, when the colourful lighting suffuses the cabin with a glow and the huge gauge cluster and infotainment screens are on even greater display.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe infotainment system is not the latest MBUX you’ll find in Mercedes’ smallest new entry, but it’s still visually pleasing and easy enough to master, with a wild array of functions that will keep you entertained and coddled. Oh, and when asked what his standout favourite feature of the G-Wagen was, Video Editor Clayton Seams was unequivocal: “Best. Stereo. Ever.” Indeed, the 15-speaker, 590-watt Burmester Surround Sound was fitting for a music industry exec or audiophile of any caliber.\n\nAll 5 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n3. But Mercedes will make you pay for it\n\nWhile the Burmester audio is thankfully standard equipment, as is a long list of luxury equipment, the G 550 starts at a heady $134,000, and adding just a handful of packages and options drove the price of this tester up to $157,740. The $4,900 Exclusive Interior Package adds sumptuous Nappa leather and microsuede headliner, and the upgraded seats with dynamic bolsters that push you back to centre when cornering are another $3,900. The Sport package body kit, adjustable damping and 360-degree parking camera (which is an absolute necessity) adding up to another $6,000+. Want fancy wheels? That’ll be another $6,150. The metal weave trim is a modest $650, but if you opt for carbon-fibre interior trim bits, it will cost you $5,500. On top of that, a whole world of personalization and conspicuous consumption is also available through Mercedes’ Designo customization division, not to mention aftermarket tuners that will be more than happy to play with the icon.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhile there is certainly plenty of engine underhood in the G 550, the 577-hp G 63 AMG is just another $10,000 from a fully loaded G 550, so if you’re already north of $150K, well, why the heck not?!\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nRange Rover won’t build the sexy SV Coupe after all\n\nJeep Trailhawks conquer Mars on Earth\n\n4. It’s not really very practical\n\nWhen you’re sitting way up high in the driver’s seat looking out through the vertical windscreen, towering over many cars in traffic, you might be fooled into thinking that the G-Wagen is a big truck. It’s not. Despite being longer than the other iconic boxy off-roader, the Wrangler Unlimited has almost double the trunk space (897.6 litres to the G’s 454), and the rear seats are about as tight as some subcompact crossovers, only this one is a lot harder to get into with its massive ground clearance. Thankfully there are sidesteps to help with ingress, but my kids still struggled.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhile its driving manners are refined, visibility is still challenging despite big square windows, with its thick pillars necessary for a tough body structure, and the rear-mounted spare obstructing a big chunk of the view out back. The saving grace is that 360-degree camera system, but in the yucky, slushy, salty winter weather we had during our week in the G 550, you need to make sure you wipe the lenses clear any time you drive more than a block, so it was rarely much help reaching most of our destinations.\n\nAll 7 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n5. Above all, you feel like a Boss\n\nNo matter all the technical stuff or practicality concerns, the G-Wagen is an image car. Whether you appreciate its military roots, tried-and-tested toughness, or its celebrity from Hollywood starlets and pro athletes making it the ride of the stars, there is something inexplicably badass about rolling around in the G. The old-fashioned V8 rumble turns heads and it gets long, lingering looks in parking lots and driving by bus stops, not to mention towering over many average cars and crossovers. If you don’t have the patience to drive a classic car that is truly from another era, the G-Wagen serves nicely as a modern car that seems like something from another era and ready for anything, from red carpet appearances to the zombie apocalypse. As cliché as it seems, it just feels cool.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Blind-Spot Monitor and follow our social channels on X, Tiktok and LinkedIn to stay up to date on the latest automotive news, reviews, car culture, and vehicle shopping advice.\n\nMore in Road Tests\n\nSUV Review: 2024 Chevrolet Trailblazer RS AWD | Reviews\n\n2024 Honda CR-V SUV Review: Which Model and Trim should you buy? | Reviews\n\nMillennial Mom's Review: Is the 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L a good three-row SUV? | Reviews\n\nSUV Review: 2024 Dodge Hornet R/T | Reviews\n\nLong-term test update: 2024 Lexus RZ 450e | Reviews\n\nSee more\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nJonathan Yarkony\n\nDriving's Managing Editor, Jonathan is a family man that loves to drive anything, anywhere (complaining about every other driver in the way along the way), and his hobbies include pointing out typos wherever he sees them and taking pictures of cheeseburgers.\n\nCurrently\n\nManaging Editor, Driving.ca\n\nEducation\n\nJonathan earned a BA degree from Union College in Schenectady, New York and an took post-grad Journalism courses at New School University in New York City.\n\nSummary\n\n· 15+ years of experience as editor and freelance writer in automotive magazines and websites\n\n· Expert level grammar and writing skills and analytics-driven approach to editorial content\n\n· Currently Managing Editor for Driving.ca; formerly editor or contributor at Auto Trader, Autos.ca, MSN.ca/autos, AutoGuide.com, CarBuzz, and more\n\nExperience\n\nJonathan Yarkony is a writer and editor with extensive experience working at automotive websites and print publications.
