System cannot overcome the laws of physics, nor is it a substitute for being attentive to driving, traffic and conditions. Please always wear your seat belt. Performance is limited by available traction, which snow, ice and other conditions can affect. Always drive carefully, consistent with conditions. Best performance in snow is obtained with winter tires.\n\n9\n\nSome systems are optional. Even the most advanced safety systems may not be sufficient to avoid an accident. It is the driver's responsibility at all times to be attentive to traffic and road conditions, and to provide the steering, braking and other driving inputs necessary to retain control of the vehicle. Drivers are cautioned not to wait for system alerts before braking or taking evasive action, as that may not afford sufficient time and distance. See Operator's Manual for system operating speeds and additional information and warnings.\n\n10\n\nTransparent hood display is composed from vehicle's exterior cameras, and is available only in specific drive modes at certain speeds. It is not a substitute for actively checking around the vehicle for any obstacles, people or animals in the vehicle's path or surroundings. Driver is responsible for safely operating vehicle in accordance with terrain, surface and driving conditions.
