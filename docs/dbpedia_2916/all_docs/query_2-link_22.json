        "text": "Railway jargon and the multitude of abbreviations used by government departments and the railway industry can be very confusing to the uninitiated. This page will attempt to unravel some of the mysteries. If you come across a word, phrase or abbreviation on this site, or on our local trains and stations, which you don’t understand please inform your webmaster who will be pleased to add it to this page. He might even be prevailed upon to reword an offending page to make it more intelligible!\n\nThis glossary does not include enthusiast slang which you can find elsewhere.\n\nWords and abbreviations in yellow are defined elsewhere in the glossary.\n\nGo to: A B C D E F G H I L M N O P R S T U V W X Y\n\nClick on the index letter to return to the top.\n\nA\n\nABCL\n\nAutomatic Barrier Crossing, Locally controlled.\n\nABDO\n\nAssisted Braking and Door Opening\n\nAC\n\nAlternating Current - for traction usually supplied at 25kV, 50Hz by OLE.\n\nACoRP\n\nAssociation of Community Rail Partnerships\n\nADD\n\nAutomatic Drop Down - a facility or activation thereof that drops the pantograph of an electric train if it detects a fault in the overhead line such as the contact wire not being there. Unintended ADD activations can occur if the contact wire rises too quickly after going under a bridge or other structure.\n\nAHB\n\nAutomatic Half-Barrier - type of level crossing with barriers across half the width of the roadway on each side which are activated automatically by the approaching train. The crossings at Furze Platt and Cookham are AHBs (see Gallery 1, picture 10).\n\nAirtrack\n\nNow abandoned scheme by BAA to link Heathrow Airport via South-Western metals to Reading and Waterloo.\n\nANPR\n\nAutomatic Number Plate Recognition\n\nAOCL\n\nAutomatic Open Crossing, Locally controlled - type of level crossing without barriers or gates and with traffic signals operated by the approaching train.

It automatically applies the brakes if the hooter warning is not acknowledged. The danger is that if a driver is used to running on single yellow or double yellow signals he could acknowledge the hooter by force of habit and carry on even if the signal is at danger. This is believed to have been the cause of the Ladbroke Grove mishap. The newer TPWS aims to overcome this drawback.\n\nB\n\nBAA\n\nBritish Airports Authority - former owner of the three London Airports.
