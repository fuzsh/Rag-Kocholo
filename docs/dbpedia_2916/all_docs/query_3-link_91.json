These vehicles are designed with both city driving and off-road adventures in mind, offering versatility that few competitors can match. However, if you’re considering buying one, you should know which Mercedes-Benz G-Class years to avoid.\n\nWe’re going to focus on providing you with comprehensive insights regarding the Mercedes-Benz G-Class years to avoid, to ensure that your investment in this iconic series reaps the best returns.\n\nMercedes-Benz G-Class Years To Avoid\n\nThe G-Class has a reputation for durability and luxury, but not all years are created equal. Some models have faced more than their fair share of problems, leading to a costly ownership experience. Here’s a look at the Mercedes-Benz G-Class years to avoid:\n\n2002 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2003 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2004 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2005 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2006 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2007 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2010 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2011 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2012 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\n2017 Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\nThe 2002-2007 models often suffered from electrical issues, including malfunctioning power windows and power seats. There were also complaints about problems with the air conditioning system.\n\nThe 2010-2012 models of the G-Class faced issues with the fuel system, which could lead to decreased performance. Additionally, some owners reported issues with the suspension system, which could affect the vehicle’s handling and comfort.\n\nThe 2017 model year was notably problematic due to its recurrent brake system issues. This was accompanied by complaints about the steering system as well.\n\nThese models can still be enjoyed, but prospective owners should be prepared for the potential of additional maintenance and repair costs. If possible, consider opting for a newer model year or one that has a well-documented service history.\n\nFEEL SECURE IN THE CAR YOU CHOOSE\n\nYou don’t want to buy a car - you want to get the best deal on the car you’re looking for. The CoPilot app will notify you if there’s a similar vehicle in your area at a better price, so you’re always certain you got the best deal available.\n\nWhat Was The Worst Year For The Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\nWhile the G-Class is generally known for its durability and comfort, Vehiclehelp.com reports that the 2017 model year stands out as particularly troublesome. It is often regarded as the worst year for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class due to a myriad of issues that plagued this particular model. Here’s a quick summary of the common problems:\n\nBrake System Issues: Owners of the 2017 G-Class have reported numerous problems with the vehicle’s braking system, which can be a significant safety concern. The issues range from premature brake wear to brake failure in certain instances.\n\nSteering Problems: Some owners also reported steering problems that could make the vehicle difficult to handle, particularly at higher speeds or on uneven terrain.\n\nThese issues, coupled with the high repair and maintenance costs that are typically associated with the G-Class, make the 2017 model a less-than-ideal choice for potential owners.\n\nBest Mercedes-Benz G-Class Years\n\nIn contrast to the troubled years, there are several years where the G-Class shines with its superior reliability and performance. The best model years are generally regarded as:\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2019\n\nThe 2013 and 2014 years marked an impressive stride in terms of build quality and reliability. Issues from earlier years were addressed, and owners generally report fewer problems with these models.\n\nThe 2019 G-Class is particularly noteworthy. Mercedes-Benz revamped the G-Class this year, giving it a more modern and luxurious interior without sacrificing its iconic, boxy exterior design. The 2019 model also exhibits improved performance and off-road capabilities, making it a standout choice for G-Class enthusiasts.\n\nHow Many Miles Does a Mercedes-Benz G-Class Last?\n\nThe longevity of a vehicle depends on numerous factors, including the model year, driving habits, and the maintenance it receives. As a luxury SUV, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class is no exception. That said, the G-Class is known for its durability, and many owners report high mileage with proper care.\n\nAccording to data from CopilotSearch, the G-Class is among the top vehicles that owners keep for 15 years or more, and can expect to get half a million miles on some of the best examples. This implies that with basic servicing and care, a G-Class can easily surpass the 200,000-mile mark.\n\nHowever, remember that higher mileage might come with increased maintenance and repair costs, particularly for a luxury vehicle like the G-Class.\n\nT HE MOST RELIABLE YEAR FOR THE MERCEDES-BENZ G-CLASS\n\nWe explore the reliability history of the G-Class to help you identify the most reliable Mercedes-Benz G-Class year for your needs.\n\nCommon Issues With the Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\nWhile the Mercedes-Benz G-Class is generally reliable, it’s not exempt from issues. According to RepairPal, common problems include electrical system faults, fuel system issues, and premature wear of suspension components. Some owners have also reported problems with the automatic transmission. Always get a pre-purchase inspection by a qualified mechanic who is familiar with the G-Class, as these high-end vehicles can be complex and expensive to repair.\n\nHow Reliable Is The Mercedes-Benz G-Class\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz G-Class, also known as the G-Wagen, has earned a reputation for its durability and off-road capabilities, adding to its overall reliability. However, like any vehicle, its reliability can fluctuate depending on the model year and how well it’s been maintained. Later models of the G-Class, post-2010, tend to be more reliable due to various refinements and improvements made over the years, as well as the 1996-2002 range, according to Copilotsearch.com.\n\nRegular maintenance is paramount to ensure the longevity of the G-Class, and this includes timely oil changes, brake checks, and adherence to the recommended service schedule. It’s also worth mentioning that the G-Class is a luxury vehicle, and as such, the cost of maintaining it can be higher than that of an average SUV.\n\nTHE BEST CARS FOR SNOW\n\nWinter driving impacts young and experienced drivers alike. We’ve compiled a list of the best cars for snow, so you can get from Point A to Point B as safely as possible.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz G-Class is a classic blend of luxury and ruggedness. It offers extraordinary off-road capability, high-end luxury, and a distinctive style that sets it apart from other vehicles on the road. As we’ve discussed, some model years are more reliable than others. In particular, G-Class models from 2013 and onwards tend to be the most reliable.\n\nEarlier models, particularly those from the mid-2000s, have reported more issues, so they might be best avoided. As with any used car purchase, prospective G-Class owners should consider a pre-purchase inspection to identify any potential issues.
