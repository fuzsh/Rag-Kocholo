        "text": "What is the difference in the nature of international ocean bills of lading, international rail freight air waybills, and international air waybills?\n\n1) Airway Bill and Railway Bill are air cargo transportation contracts between the shipper and the carrier, and are also the documents (receipts) for the transportation of goods.\n\n2) Both air waybills and rail waybills have the characteristics of “transportation contract” and “cargo receipt”. What is the \"transportation contract\"? That is, the contract of carriage of goods between the shipper and the carrier; what is the \"receipt of goods\"? That is, the carrier receives the shipper’s goods and receives the receipt (voucher) for transportation.\n\n3) The ocean bill of lading is the receipt of the goods issued by the carrier (ship company) after receiving the goods, and is also the proof of the contract of carriage signed by the carrier. The bill of lading also represents the ownership of the goods contained, which is a property right. Voucher. The receipt of the goods, the certificate of the contract of carriage and the certificate of ownership of the goods are the three major functions of the ocean bill of lading. The bill of lading is liquid and can be transferred when certain conditions are met.\n\n4) The air waybill is called airway bill (AWB), the rail waybill is called Railway Bill (RWB), and the ocean bill of lading is called Bill of Lading (B/L). Some people may also call an air waybill an air waybill and a rail waybill called a rail bill of lading. In fact, AWB and RWB should not be called bills of lading. Because strictly speaking, the bill of lading is unique to the sea, only the shipping can call the bill of lading. Because the bill of lading has a very important feature: the \"property certificate\" function. The “transportation contract” and the “cargo receipt” are all available for air waybills, rail waybills and ocean bills of lading, but the “property certificate” is unique to the Bill of Lading. Therefore, air and iron transport can only be called a waybill, can not be called a bill of lading, the ability of shipping can be called a bill of lading.\n\nIn short, whether there is a document of title and whether it can be transferred is the essential difference between the “bill of transport” (air transport & rail transport) and the “bill of lading” (marine transport). In other words, the nature of the “bill of lading” and “bill of lading” is different.\n\n5) Of course, the shipping documents are not only the bill of lading (B/L), but also a type of sea way bill (Seaway Bill, SWB). A sea waybill is a non-negotiable transport document that proves that the goods are taken over or loaded by the carrier (the function of the goods receipt) and the carrier guarantees that the goods are delivered to the consignee stated in the document, and is also a contract for maritime transport. prove.\n\nAlthough the sea waybill and the ocean bill of lading are only one word difference, there is a fundamental difference in the nature - both have the functions of \"cargo receipt\" and \"contract proof of transport\", but the sea waybill does not have \"property certificate\", can not transfer. It can be seen that the nature of the sea waybill is fundamentally different from the ocean bill of lading, but it is very similar to the air waybill and the railway waybill.\n\nIf you still have questions, pls feel free contact me:"
