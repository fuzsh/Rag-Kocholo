What Was The Worst Year For The Mercedes-Benz G-Class

While the G-Class is generally known for its durability and comfort, Vehiclehelp.com reports that the 2017 model year stands out as particularly troublesome. It is often regarded as the worst year for the Mercedes-Benz G-Class due to a myriad of issues that plagued this particular model. Here’s a quick summary of the common problems:

Brake System Issues: Owners of the 2017 G-Class have reported numerous problems with the vehicle’s braking system, which can be a significant safety concern. The issues range from premature brake wear to brake failure in certain instances.

Steering Problems: Some owners also reported steering problems that could make the vehicle difficult to handle, particularly at higher speeds or on uneven terrain.

These issues, coupled with the high repair and maintenance costs that are typically associated with the G-Class, make the 2017 model a less-than-ideal choice for potential owners.

Best Mercedes-Benz G-Class Years

In contrast to the troubled years, there are several years where the G-Class shines with its superior reliability and performance. The best model years are generally regarded as:

2013

2014

2019

The 2019 G-Class is particularly noteworthy. Mercedes-Benz revamped the G-Class this year, giving it a more modern and luxurious interior without sacrificing its iconic, boxy exterior design. The 2019 model also exhibits improved performance and off-road capabilities, making it a standout choice for G-Class enthusiasts.

How Many Miles Does a Mercedes-Benz G-Class Last?

The longevity of a vehicle depends on numerous factors, including the model year, driving habits, and the maintenance it receives. As a luxury SUV, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class is no exception. That said, the G-Class is known for its durability, and many owners report high mileage with proper care.

According to data from CopilotSearch, the G-Class is among the top vehicles that owners keep for 15 years or more, and can expect to get half a million miles on some of the best examples. This implies that with basic servicing and care, a G-Class can easily surpass the 200,000-mile mark.

However, remember that higher mileage might come with increased maintenance and repair costs, particularly for a luxury vehicle like the G-Class.

According to RepairPal, common problems include electrical system faults, fuel system issues, and premature wear of suspension components. Some owners have also reported problems with the automatic transmission.

How Reliable Is The Mercedes-Benz G-Class

The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, also known as the G-Wagen, has earned a reputation for its durability and off-road capabilities, adding to its overall reliability.
