        "text": "(2 of 3)\n\nAgain and again Madrid proletarians were driven in mad, screaming retreat, but again and again their shattered lines reformed to attempt fresh resistance with Spanish stubbornness, then suffer another rout. Meanwhile, smiling Generalissimo Franco was exhibiting his other distinctive characteristics: caution, thoroughness, quick decision, forehandedness. The steep-banked Manzanares River still lay between him and the capital and he knew its six bridges were heavily mined, but along with attending to military details he was also ready with his own White police force and his own skeleton force of civil servants ready to install them in the Government buildings which his artillery was \"dusting\" with light shells. Franco police were trimly attired and wore the hard, tricornered hats which to Spaniards are the normal symbol of law & order. The Generalissimo's program was Back to Normalcy for Spain.\n\nAs the main White bombardment opened at 8 a. m., shells dropped into the office of Brown Boveri Co., scaring the charwoman who was awaiting the arrival of the staff. Other shells plunked into the famed Oriental Café in the Puerta del Sol, heart of Madrid. The Ministry of Interior, police headquarters and the French Embassy were all barely missed by screaming shells, but a small one landed in the onetime Royal Palace of Alfonso XIII, now the Palace of the President. Don Manuel Azaña, who fled last month not to Valencia but to Barcelona (TIME, Oct. 26).\n\nAbout 3 p. m. came an infernal five minutes which seemed to Madrid citizens like hours. Out of low, heavy clouds which had concealed their approach, four big White planes thundered to bomb the slum district of Madrid while three small White pursuit ships strafed the streets with machine guns. Six defending pursuit planes were soon diving on the Whites and anti-aircraft guns spat up at them from Madrid, but all got safely away.\n\nThe Soviet Ambassador to Madrid, Comrade Rosenberg, had meanwhile departed with his staff to open up again as the Soviet Embassy in Valencia. This week courageous diplomatic underlings at the U. S. and British Embassies used their short-wave radios to get out of the besieged capital the only uncensored and even approximately trustworthy dispatches. Time and again they corrected rumors that Madrid had fallen, and although what they sent could not be printed, editors were kept posted by the State Department in Washington and the British Foreign Office. Madrid's defenders appeared to have more airplanes and more ammunition than anyone in the journalistic camp had expected. Cautious Generalissimo Franco, with the Red Militia finally driven back across the Manzanares River, which opposed the Whites like a gigantic trench, swung his Moors around to a point where the bank sloped more easily and the water was shallower, then resumed bombardment and bombing which observers estimated to have killed and wounded 200."
