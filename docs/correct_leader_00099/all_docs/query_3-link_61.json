        "text": "On the 16th of April, 2010, at the magnificent Teatro Arriaga in Bilbao, four hundred people took turns performing dramatic readings from the only novel written by the Basque-speaking French author, Jon Mirande1. Among the participants were the Mayor of Bilbao, Iñaki Azkuna, the General Secretary of the Nationalist Basque Party, Josune Ariztondo, a Socialist MP, Isabel Celaa, a specialist in Basque literature, Blanca Urgell, and the Bishop of Bilbao, Mario Iceta. Mirande had died in 1972, yet for decades the Spanish Basque Nationalists never celebrated his works, despite his unflagging passionate support for their cause. The reason for this reticence was because Mirande had been a fierce anti-Semite and outspoken admirer of the Third Reich. In one article, he had celebrated the 1328 Estella pogrom in Navarre as a manifestation of the proud Basque race confronting an outside threat. The National Basque Party’s sympathy for Israel, rooted in admiration for its national and linguistic achievements, helps explain why such a fervent Basque nationalist had been shrouded in silence in the Basque country up until 20102. The celebration that took place at the Arriaga Theater in Bilbao that year was a symptom of the amnesia, cynicism, and historical ignorance of the participants, local politicians, and local intellectual elite.\n\nRecently, Spanish audiences have discovered how certain famous high-ranking Nazis believed that the Basque case was evidence for their theories of race. The recent rediscovery of the movie Im Lande der Basken, made in 1944 by the German Director Herbert Brieger, made a significant impact in Spain. The movie offered a mythical portrayal of the Basque people, with shots filtered through the language of Nazi propaganda. This was not the only German motion picture from the period on this topic, but it is the only one to survive in movie archives. The same director, Brieger, made a movie entitled Biscaya südwärts (The South of Biscay) in 1944, which has since been lost. In the surviving movie, the voice-over poses the central question that so preoccupied these specialists on race: “Where did this people come from? Nobody knows. Maybe from those who built the Tower of Babel, from the Phoenicians, from Atlanteans, the Finns, or the Mongols. In any event, the most popular theory says they came from the Iberians”5.\n\nIt is not surprising that the Basque question and Nazi history intersect here. In July 1993, a book was published in Madrid with the punning title Auto de terminación6. While evoking self-determination, it means “report of the end”. It was written by an anthropologist, Juan Aranzadi, a philologist, Jon Juaristi, and a political journalist, Patxo Unzueta. All three had been E.T.A. militants in their youth, or had had ties to it up until Franco’s death. The book was published by Aguilar-El País, a publishing house that belonged to the PRISA news corporation, which also owned the newspaper El País, ensuring it made a splash with the Spanish public. The cover of the book asks three questions: “Is anti-Semitism the model for nationalist ideology?”; “Can autonomy meet the aspirations of Basque nationalism?”; “Can there be a negotiated end to E.T.A. violence”? The book contains several chapters demonstrating the presence of an anti-Semitic element in the centuries-long construction of Basque political identity. In a chapter entitled What the Empty Ghetto Tells Us, Jon Juaristi writes “[…] the Basque anti-Spanish sentiment is, has, and always be –for as long as it exists– a form of anti-Semitism7. This shuttling back-and-forth between the Basque question and the Jewish question takes up half of Auto de terminación. This was at a time when the number of assassinations carried out in the name of Basque liberation continued to horrify the Spanish population: 25 in 1990, 46 in 1991, 26 in 1992. At the time, the head of the Basque government, the Lehendakari José Antonio Ardanza, a member of the Basque Nationalist Party, was promoting a policy of dialogue between all organizations rejecting terrorism. As if to counterbalance this political strategy of conciliation, the leader of the very same Basque Nationalist Party, Xabier Arzalluz, defended a radical ideology based on an ethnic conception of political identity. As indicated in the editor’s introductory note, Auto de terminación was an immediate response to a turning point in the political debate:\n\nWhat was at stake here? Arana’s brand of Basque nationalism was based on his rejection of the migrant workers who had come to the Basque country to work in the steel mills and shipbuilding yards, and on an affirmation of the ethnic identity of the region's inhabitants. He designated the invaders as maketos, their society as maketería, and the political will behind their invasion of Basque society as maketismo. In order to draw a lasting distinction between the different populations, he deemed it essential to guarantee their rigorous segregation. This is why he accorded such importance to the issue of marriage, rejecting any marriage that would unite a pure Basque with anyone of maketa descent. He himself chose his wife only after checking the origins of her sixteen great-great-grandparents. In an 1895 article he wrote:\n\nToday, when so many Bizkaino families are mixed with maketos, or Spaniards, thanks to Bizkainos who have already lost awareness of their nationality, we shall establish (if we are free to do so) a distinction between natives and mestizos, with regard to rights and to the places where they are permitted to settle; but someone of pure maketa race will ever be maketo, even if he is a descendant of seven generations born in Bizkaya, and a speaker of Euzkera10.\n\nIn this passage, the expression in parenthesis “(if we are free to do so)” has a very specific meaning: if the Basque country were to regain its political sovereignty. His plan would have involved a statutory distinction (or separation) and the placing of limits on where certain populations could reside. But what is most striking is his definition of Basque. This has nothing to do with how many generations a family has resided in the Basque country, but depends solely on its natural maketa or Basque origins. This rejection of socio-historical, cultural, and even environmental factors in the definition of national identity was a trademark of Sabino Arana's thought. The 1895 article is not polemical or rhetorical overreach, but the very basis of his worldview, as can be seen in a passage from a different article published the same year:\n\nto be born in one place or another does not mean anything, as is clearly the case with regards to race. A child of Bizkainos born in Madagascar or Dahomey will be as racially Bizkaino as anyone born in Olakueta; in turn, a descendant of Spaniards born in Bizkaya will never be racially Bizkaino.\n\nHe made no secret of the fact that these views served a dual purpose. First, they reaffirmed the irreducible alterity of migrants of “Spanish” or “maketa” descent who had settled in the Basque country. Second, they reassured the Basque communities who had left for Mexico, Argentina, Cuba, and various other New World republics, including the United States –reassuring them, of course, so as to rally them to the Basque nationalist cause. This was of great importance, because the last decade of the nineteenth century saw the celebration of the Hispanic “race” spread ever more rapidly in Spain and a number of Latin American republics. The Día de la Raza, held on the October 6th holiday, celebrates what the founder of the Spanish Falanje Nacional-Sindicalista, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, would later call a “unity of destiny in the universal” (unidad de destino en lo universal). This concept was a way to exalt the unitary universalism of a Hispanic-ness that had managed to impose a single, intransigent, Catholic faith upon diverse populations, as evidenced by Leo XIII’s encyclical of July 16, 1892, Quarto Abuente Saeculo11. Defending the Spanish race would therefore have exerted a powerful attraction, including among Basques in Europe and the Americas. In this context, radical Basque nationalism felt a need to assert a racial incompatibility between the Basque subgroup and the Spanish whole. To use the language of today, this was an ideological and political contest within an ultra-reactionary current. Likewise, in the late nineteenth century, a racial definition of the Basque identity expanded while Spaniards attempted to define their own identity in a racial way. Two symetrical projects therefore12. This is why Sabino Arana, in an article published in 1899, advocated a strict separation within Basque society:\n\nIt is, therefore, clearly and plainly evident that the salvation of Basque society, its regeneration and its future hope, depend on the most absolute isolation, on the removal of every foreign element, on the rational and practical exclusion of everything that does not clearly bear the fixed and indelible imprint of pure Basque origins13.\n\nArana’s observations, whether he wished it or not, partake in a larger moment of introspection affecting Spain as a whole, centered on a feeling of collapse on losing its last remaining distant colonies (Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines) in 189814. His arguments employ two semantic registers: political apocalypse and racial difference. He seeks to portray himself as sounding an alarm before it is too late – which is to say before intermarriages between pure Basques and migrants from the rest of Spain irrevocably muddy the bloodlines. In these circumstances, it would have been surprising if he had not used racial terminology, which at the time had not fallen into the disgrace that would befall it after the tragedy of Nazism. In 1894 he wrote:\n\nYour race – unique because of its beautiful qualities, but even more so because it does not have any contact points or fraternity with either the Spanish race or the French race, which are its neighbors, or with any race whatsoever in the world – is the one upon which your Bizkaya Fatherland was founded. And you, without a shred of dignity or respect for your ancestors, have sullied your blood with Spanish or maketa blood, mixed and consorted with the vilest and most despicable race in Europe, and you seek for this debased race to replace your race in the very territory of your Fatherland15.\n\nThe key point here is the designation of the non-Basque Spanish population as the “vilest and most despicable race in Europe”. Here is where the Basque question and the Jewish question intersect in Arana’s political worldview. Because, according to a long tradition of intransigent Catholic thought to which he was firmly beholden, the traces of Jewish – as well as Muslim – villainy had never been washed away, thus abasing the Spaniards in comparison to the populations of the rest of Europe. Throughout the sixteenth century and beyond, polemicists (both Catholic and Protestant) who were hostile to Spain never tired of repeating the same argument: Spain and the Inquisition were barbaric because the regime was tyrannical and because its population was composed of mixed-bloods, half-Jews, half-Moors. What is more, the defense of Basque identity was founded on the conviction that the Bizkainos, to use the language of both Arana and earlier writers, never allowed the converted Jews or Muslims to intermix with them:\n\nWhile the Spanish race was never a race, but an amorphous product of the admixture of several and different peoples, there are Bizkaino laws of a foundational nature, inspired by the natural repulsion that Bizkaino families feel toward the idea of mixing with foreign families, since they had a relatively clear awareness of their primordial and unique race. […] Hence while the presence of the words “Moors” and “Jews” in Spanish legislation must always be understood as expressing religious affiliation, their presence in Bizkaino laws, on the contrary, is more likely to reflect an idea of race than the spirit of religion16.\n\nAlmost a century later, his distant and faithful successor, Xabier Arzalluz, in his February 1993 article cited above, sought to present Arana's rhetoric as simply typical of his time. On this point he is not wrong. The intermixing of these different registers was quite commonplace at the time: ethnic identities, racial profiles, linguistic differences, cultural heritages, and political traditions, were all too often grouped together in the nationalist logorrhea infecting late nineteenth-century Europe. Arzalluz takes the accusation that Basque nationalism was the cradle of a radical form of racism on turns it on its head. He argues that anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim segregationist sentiment in Biscay was simply an extension of the segregationist ideology present across all of Spain in the early modern period. But before we examine this argument, which is stronger than it might initially appear, I would like to pause a moment longer over the close relationship between the construction of the Basque question at the turn of the twentieth century, on the one hand, and the Jewish question, on the other.\n\nThese flights of fancy no doubt partake in the nationalist frenzy that gripped Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, taking openly racist form in the German völkisch movement and Arana’s Basquism for instance22. But in the case of the assertion of Basque singularism, the racial dimension to this political claim is rooted in a past far predating the formation of nation states in the nineteenth century23. The wet-nurse example helps us understand a mechanism that the sixteenth-century Spanish had incorporated into their social stratagems. It was presumed that the populations of the Basque country, Cantabria, and the Navarrese Pyrenees had not been “sullied” through mixing with Muslim invaders or Jewish communities24. They therefore benefited from a kind of general blood purity that – and this is the key point – did not have to be proven. This advantage led the Basques to assert the “universal nobility” of their entire population25. They were all purportedly noble because they were pure-blooded, whereas in the rest of Spain the blood purity of certain families allowed them to assert the nobility of their lineage in contrast to families suspected of shameful intermixing. Here is how, in 1607, Baltasar de Echave defined the extraordinary privilege of the “universal nobility” of the Basques:\n\nAlthough they have intermixed among themselves, some families transforming into different ones, it is of no great import, since, being of a single kin, and sharing relatives, it is the same people who succeed each other in the same solares and houses, even if it is through the purchase of said solares and houses; for as these provinces are close to each other and isolated from the rest, they have not allowed for any intermixing, in general or in particular, with any foreign people or nation, people of unclean blood or those who are not hidalgos […] from which it follows that they are all relatives with each other […] and all of these houses and solares do not just belong to known hijosdalgo of the blood, and of known household, but also and above all these Provinces are themselves a single known and recognized household of noble hidalgos; and this is so true that simply proving one’s descent from parents and grandparents native to the two Provinces of Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa from time immemorial is sufficient to file executoria […] and for them to be deemed hijosdalgo of the blood, of known household26.\n\nReasoning of this kind can be found in the manuscript records of the older jurisdictions. We can find it in the treatises written at the time, affirming the singular status of Basque and Cantabrian populations. From this rhetoric we can see how, from the perspective of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century political institutions, it was impossible to make a distinction between religious faith and racial purity, as two distinct spheres of human experience. A passage drawn from the Suma de la cosas cantábricas y guipuzcoanas by the historian Juan Martínez de Zaldivia (1560) offers an example of how intertwined they were:\n\nEven rustic fellows and shepherds take pride in the purity of their blood and their lineages, and they especially boast of having always been far removed from heresies, from Jews, Moors, and other infidels, and of never having intermixed, and of always having kept the Christian name pure. And if any Jew traveled to that land on business it was forbidden to them to linger in any given place for more than three days or for more than thirteen days within the region, from which followed that, when young men heard the very word “Jew”, they were no less frightened than on hearing of another species different from humans, and to this day they reserve the privilege of prohibiting any of the Jews newly converted to our sacred Catholic faith from inhabiting that land32.\n\nThe Enlightenment built on this ideological and legal impetus viewing Basque exceptionalism and its attendant privileges as issuing from the absence of pollution by Jews or Muslims. For the Jesuit Manuel de Larramendi, writing in the first half of the eighteenth century, Basque exceptionalism was to be demonstrated primarily by invoking the purity and intransigence of local Catholicism:\n\nThe Moors flooded Spain, but Mohammedism did not enter Guipuzcoa. Ever since Christ’s gospel has been preached there, Guipuzcoa has received and always preserved the apostolic Roman Catholic faith, without a single case of a Guipuzcoan apostate heretically becoming Jewish or Moorish 33.\n\nBut the Basque purity of Guipuzcoa is not solely a matter of loyalty to the faith, for it also involves a racial dimension:\n\nthey belong to the oldest nation in Spain […] a little nation that has not mixed, that has no race [raza] of Moors, Goths, Alans, Silings, Romans, Greeks, Jews, Carthaginians, Phoenicians, or other nations said to have come to Spain. It is a small, clean nation, free of any sullying of blood, lineage, or genealogy34.\n\nSpanish society, exhausted by three years of civil war, and having remained on the sidelines during World War II due to Franco’s policy of neutrality, did not share other European societies’ recognition that the Jews had suffered unparalleled extermination. The surest sign of this was the social acceptability of anti-Semitism, which continued unabated from the pre-war to the post-war period. Franco’s regime, in order to join the United Nations, gradually eliminated all overt anti-Semitism in official pronouncements. But to take just one example, this did not prevent Luis Marquina from directing the 1952 film Amaya o los Vascos47. The movie was inspired by a historical novel by the Navarrese writer Francisco Navarro Villoslada, Amaya o los Vascos en el siglo VIII, published in 187748. The author, both a Carlist and a Navarrese traditionalist, hails from the pre-history of modern Basque nationalism. His novel addresses themes that are fairly similar to the question studied here. He offers a portrayal of Navarre – and, by extension, Spain – during the eight-century Muslim invasion. The book distinguishes between four population groups: the Visigoths (i.e., the Spain that was unable to resist), the Basques (i.e., the peoples who escaped Moorish domination), the Muslim Moors who came from Africa, and the Jews, who had everything to gain from a Muslim victory and therefore betrayed their country. The scenes in the 1952 film depicting the Sanhedrin of Pamplona might easily be mistaken for scenes in movies by Nazi filmmakers, such as Veit Harlan's Juif Süss49. The final scene depicts the search for a traitorous Jew in the streets of Pamplona as a joyous festival for the Basque-Navarrese people. The release of this film did not prevent Spain from joining UNESCO, under pressure from President Eisenhower, that very same year50.\n\nThe fact that ideological holdovers from the 1930s survived into the Franco regime is not especially surprising. It is, however, far more surprising to realize that traditional anti-Semitism was expressed by the exiled Spanish intelligentsia. The most famous case is that of the medievalist Claudio Sánchez Albornoz, President of the Spanish government in exile from 1962 to 197151. In the great tome he published in Buenos Aires in 1957, Spain: A Historical Enigma, he was responding, as is well known, to Américo Castro's book, The Historical Reality of Spain, published three years earlier in Mexico. Castro saw Spain's uniqueness as issuing from the intersecting influences of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations co-existing and confronting each other on the Iberian Peninsula. He denied that anything like a Spanish identity existed prior to the 11th century. In rebuttal to this theory, Sánchez Albornoz, a specialist in the history of medieval Asturias, rooted Spanish identity in the ruling Gothic culture, marginalizing the Muslim and especially Jewish contributions to the formation of Spanish-ness. This debate caused a great deal of spilt ink, and is not crucial to us here, except to the extent that Albornoz's book sheds light on just how acceptable anti-Semitism was in Spanish society at the time. In the 1973 edition published in Spain by Edhasa, there are many passages similar to the following two. The first, which apparently confirms Franco’s speech above, asserts that Jews who converted in the fifteenth century did not really change their character after having changed their religion:\n\nMost conversos stayed loyal to their Jewish faith; they did not change their characteristic habits overnight, of course, they did not give up their love of lending, of finance and commerce, and since as new Christians they acquired the rights and privileges of old Christians without changing their way of life or their faith, the Spaniards realized in the fifteenth century that the hated Jews were now able to continue extorting them and exploiting them as before, and not just from outside their social leadership but now from within and without their ranks. Their false brothers in the faith were now able to govern over the Spaniards from the positions of power that they had secured in municipal governments and close to the King52.\n\nWithout this marginal position it would be harder to explain the deceit perpetrated by Enric Marco, the pretend former deportee, recounted by Javier Cercas in his book The Impostor56. I also remember the extraordinary impact when Holocaust, an American television series by Marvin Chomsky, was aired in June 1979. Coming after over thirty years of Spanish silence on the subject, it felt like a bolt from the blue. The day that the fifth episode aired, June 29, 1979, the Spanish neo-Nazi group CEDADE (Spanish Circle of the Friends of Europe) launched a campaign of posters denouncing the series57. They referred in a press release to “the myth of six million deaths”, and accused Spanish television of having scheduled the airing of Holocaust so as to prepare public opinion for Spain’s upcoming official recognition of the State of Israel. Faithful to the Francoist tradition, the Spanish neo-Nazis were vehemently opposed to the idea of establishing relations with Israel. The series had been purchased in 1978 and was originally scheduled for January 1979. Its broadcast was suspended sine die. An article in El País offers an account of the suspension, in terms reflecting the persistence of anti-Semitic language, even in the pages of this center-left pro-democracy newspaper:\n\nWe imagine that this decision was made due to the controversy that arose surrounding the made-for-TV movie QB VII, which was considered Zionist propaganda, and defended by the Jewish community. Holocaust, like QB VII, is an indisputable sign of the power of Jewish capital in the North American movie industry58.\n\nNowadays, and however regrettable this may be, it is impossible to wholly separate the Jewish question from that of Israel in public debate. This is as true in Spain as elsewhere. Hence two of the authors who edited and contributed to the volume Auto de Terminación in 1993, later had a falling out, not over the Basque question, but over their relationship to Judaism. Jon Juaristi, philologist, poet, and director of the National Library of Madrid, later converted to Judaism. As a public intellectual, he took up the defense of the (continued) existence of the state of Israel . And he did so in a country like Spain, where the majority of public opinion is either critical or hostile towards Israel, and where there is a great deal of sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Whatever personal motivation Jon Juaristi had for converting to Judaism (and I certainly do not claim to know all his motives), the adoption of Jewish identity by a son of the Basque bourgeoisie from Bilbao and a former E.T.A. militant should be understood in relationship to this legacy and this trajectory. To become Jewish, in these circumstances, comes down to turning one’s back on the deepest and most secret core of Basque exclusivism. This is an ironic thumbing of the nose at five centuries of phantasmagoria, five centuries of the assertion of a specifically Basque purity based on the absence of any Jewish element. For his part, Juan Aranzadi, professor of social anthropology, saw the Jewish question from two altogether different angles. Like Juaristi, and many others, he did not fail to emphasize the important role the fantasy of blood purity had played in the genesis of Basque identity. However, he also observed the Judaism question in asserting that, as of the sixteenth century, the ethnic and religious construction of Basque Catholics followed the model of the chosen people. He was well aware that the Basque Nationalist Party, post-World War II, overtly admired the accomplishments of Zionism (a sovereign state, a resurrected language). As such, he put forward the idea of a parallel history of Basque political hysteria and the irrationality of political Zionism, both of which he condemned with the same polemical vigor. In truth, this parallel has a very long history in intellectual debate in Iberian countries. We are well aware that the doctrinal intransigence of the Inquisition and the ideology of blood purity primarily and overwhelmingly targeted the descendents of Jewish and Muslim converts. But religious intransigence and a refusal to intermix were often interpreted as the transposition into Spanish Christian society of social mechanisms and norms from the Jewish world. This was even a commonplace in the most reactionary Spanish historiography of the Franco era that while appreciating that the Inquisition was a useful tool of political and spiritual cohesion, interpreted its brutality as a legacy of Judaism. In any event, Juan Aranzadi frequently denounced the policies of successive Israeli governments. He rejected Zionism as a political phenomenon based on an ethno-religious identity, just as despicable in his eyes as the racial nationalism of certain Basque political organizations, whether legal or terrorist.\n\nThus the ethnic essentialism of Basque nationalism, including its racist dimension, was no exception in late modern Spain. Its argumentative mode, much like its appeals to an intellectual and institutional history stretching back to the sixteenth century, are virtually indistinguishable from pronouncements in the rest of the country. The socio-political processes that formed the Kingdom of Spain at the end of the Middle Ages gave birth to a system of religious and racial societal regulation. Catholic intransigence, attachment to ideas of blood purity, obsession with remaining faithful to the lineage, the code of honor – these were all features that fed into the assertion of Basque universal nobility, as well as Spanish casticismo more generally. The idea of the Basque country as a refuge of Old Christian purity only made sense because the New Christians were victims of segregation throughout Spain61. These two phenomena had been, in truth, perfectly harmonized as of the sixteenth century. The tragedy of Basque nationalism was that, from that point on, it was unable to distinguish itself from Spanish nationalism in general. We see the same prejudices, the same values, with both founded in the same historical conception of blood purity, and the same Catholic intransigence. This was a sibling rivalry between twins, perhaps even Siamese ones, spawned of the same reactionary bed."
