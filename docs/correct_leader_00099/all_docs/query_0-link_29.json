        "text": "For the Spanish village called Azaña prior to 1936, see Numancia de la Sagra.\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternalsurname is Azaña and the second or maternal family name is Díaz.\n\nManuel Azaña Díaz (Spanish pronunciation: [maˈnwel aˈθaɲa]; 10 January 1880 – 3 November 1940) was a Spanish politician who served as Prime Minister of the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1933 and 1936), organizer of the Popular Front in 1935 and the last President of the Republic (1936–1939). He was the most prominent leader of the Republican cause during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939.\n\nQuick Facts President of Spain, Prime Minister ...\n\nClose\n\nA published author in the 1910s, he stood out in the pro-Allies camp during World War I.[1] He was sharply critical towards the Generation of '98, the reimagination of the Spanish Middle Ages, Imperial Spain and the 20th century yearnings for a praetorian refurbishment of the country. Azaña followed instead the examples of the French Enlightenment and the Third French Republic, and took a political quest for democracy in the 1920s while defending the notion of homeland as the \"democratic equality of all citizens towards the law\"[2] that made him embrace republicanism.\n\nAfter the Proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in April 1931, Azaña became Minister of War of the Provisional Government and enacted military reform, looking to develop a modern armed forces with fewer army officers. He later became Prime Minister in October 1931."
