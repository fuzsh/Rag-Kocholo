        "text": "A chubby, tousle-haired Andalusian lawyer who is often too busy to shave, Niceto Alcala Zamora y Torres, was elected first Constitutional President of Spain by the Cortes last week. Next day he was inaugurated.\n\nHe took no oath of office. “I solemnly promise” said President Alcala Zamora, “on my honor before the Constituent Cortes . . . faithfully to serve the Republic, respect and enforce the Constitution . . . and devote my activity as Chief of State to the service and justice of Spain.”\n\nWarned Julian Besteiro, President of the Cortes:\n\n“… I say to you, if you act according to your promise the nation will reward you. If not, it will demand an accounting.”\n\nVisitors, including a number of white-robed chiefs from Morocco, crowded the Cortes chamber. The diplomatic corps, headed by the purple-robed Papal Nuncio, was there in all its gold lace and feathers.\n\nSenores los Diputados were a little uncertain what they should wear on this memorable occasion; costumes varied from full evening dress, frock coats, dinner jackets to sack suits. Just before the Presidential Promise was administered occurred one of those little contretemps so distressing to orderly Nordic minds. The shrill voice of Senora Alcala Zamora rose in loud lament in the lobby: “But I tell you Niceto forgot and went off with my tickets in his pockets!” Generals rushed to the rescue. Breathing hard. Senora Alcala Zamora eventually found a seat in the press gallery.\n\nFor the first time since the Revolution Spanish troops paraded in dress uniform. Tousle-haired President Zamora rode down the Calle de Alcala through the city to the former Royal Palace, with a clattering escort of silver-cuirassed Presidential Guards. He was followed by blue-clad naval cadets, red-trousered regulars. Basque Miquelitos with pantaloons and scarlet berets, the khaki-clad Foreign Legion, Moorish cavalry in white bournouses, and the yellow-belted, shiny-hatted guardia civil. Even the sappers joined the parade, proudly carrying pontoons and bridge parts. The air force added a final touch. Squadrons of planes flew overhead scattering 400,000 copies of the new Constitution over the city.\n\nSpain’s Constitution is one of the longest ever adopted by a modern nation. It contains 19 chapters and over 125 articles. Serviceably bound in red, yellow & purple covers, the 400,000 volumes hurtled down last week somewhat dangerously, but there were no serious casualties. Into the Royal Palace, his official residence for the time being, went Senor Alcala Zamora, preceded by four mace-bearers. In Fontainebleau, ex-King Alfonso XIII spent the day playing golf, turned in a poor card.\n\nNo sooner was the inauguration over, the captains and the troops departed, than Premier Manuel Azana drove to the Palace and insisted on handing in his resignation. Worried President Alcala Zamora called a meeting of statesmen, asked Premier Azana to form another government, which he grudgingly agreed to do.\n\nGenerally overlooked in press reports of the inauguration was an important bit of news from Madrid:\n\nThe day that Senor Alcala Zamora was elected, a bill was introduced in the Cortes declaring International Telephone & Telegraph Co.’s Spanish telephone monopoly illegal, providing for confiscation “and a just indemnification” within six months. Over $30,000,000 of U. S. money is invested in Spanish telephones."
