Using diplomatic correspondence of the United States with ITT and the Spanish Republic of the 1930s, he demonstrates the vital nature of these strengths at a time when the tensions between “communism” and “fascism” were new and vigorous, and reaches a startling conclusion about the sameness under the skin of the two ideologies where the rights of foreign concessionaries are concerned.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nBusiness History Review , Volume 53 , Issue 4 , Winter 1979 , pp. 449 - 472\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.2307/3114734 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © The President and Fellows of Harvard College 1979\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

The legal status of the CTNE remained a sensitive issue. Although the firm was incorporated in Spain and had a number of Spanish stockholders, effective control was exercised by a pair of Americans, Lewis J. Proctor and Logan N. Rock. Wilkins, Maturing of Multinational Enterprise, 146–151, notes that this type of arrangement was not uncommon during the 1920s when such firms attempted to avoid provoking a nationalistic outcry in the host country.\n\n15\n\n15 Article 42 of the draft constitution permitted the confiscation of any public utility by the Spanish Government with proper indemnification, unless an absolute majority of the Cortes determined that no compensation was required.
