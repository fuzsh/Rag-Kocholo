In Spain, for the first time since the days of soviets in Germany and Hungary, the power of the worker and peasant masses proved great enough to overthrow the rotting structure of the old regime and even to challenge the as yet unstabilized power of democratic capitalism.\n\nFor the first time in many years, the slogan of proletarian revolution has appeared on the order of the day in a West European country. Whatever the outcome may be in Spain, at least this imperishable glory cannot be stolen from the Spanish proletariatthat it has dared to lift to the skies the same red banner that was borne to victory by the Russian Bolsheviks in November 1917!\n\nToday, the Spanish revolution is being stifled by the democratic reaction at home and abroad, clearing the way for Franco, Mussolini and Hitler. The underlying social aims of the fascist insurrectionthe preservation of capitalism and the strangulation of the labor movementare now being actively promoted by the imperialist diplomacy of the great democracies, England and France, and the counter-revolutionary terror of the democratic coalition of Stalinites, right-wing Prieto socialists and conservative Republican politicians. In the interests of this reactionary crusade, everything is being sacrificed, even the chances of victory at the front in the war against Franco.\n\nBut that is only one side of the picture. The other side shows us the great masses of the Spanish workers and peasants beginning to awaken to the extreme peril of their situation; it shows us an increasingly revolutionary, mood among the millions of members of the C.N.T. and the U.G.T., the two great labor federations; it shows us the significant advances being made, in the face of ruthless persecution, by the P.O.U.M., the heroic revolutionary Marxist party in Spain. It shows us the Spanish masses rising still unconquered under the blows of fascist and democratic reaction alike.\n\nThis is the story that Bertram D. Wolfe tells in such brilliant fashion in the pages that follow. These chapters were written intermittently over a period of seven months as articles for the Workers Age. Yet so keen is the insight exhibited in them and so realistic the approach, that the work is of far more than current interest; it is really a fundamental contribution to the understanding of the Spanish revolution and its many complex problems. It is living Marxism at its best.\n\nOf such a work, Bertram D. Wolfe is peculiarly fitted to be the author. His wide studies in economics, history and social theory, his two decades of direct experience in the revolutionary labor movement at home and abroad, are supplemented by an extensive knowledge of Spanish history and political development and a sympathetic appreciation of Spanish culture and tradition.\n\nThe last thesis of the martyred P.O.U.M. leader, Andres Nin, which forms a supplement to this work, needs no recommendation. It has already become a classic of revolutionary theory and policy.\n\nWILL HERBERG\n\nDecember 22, 1937.\n\nChapter I. The Revolution of 1931.\n\nAlmost anything may happen in Spain. With the great democracies, England, France, the United States, treacherously choking off her sources of supplies and intriguing for a truce, with the Soviet Union backing her materially but using the authority thus acquired in ways that hinder the waging of a successful revolutionary war, with Italy and Germany openly invading her soil and joining England and France in preventing foreign intervention, almost anything may happen in Spain.\n\nOut of the Spanish civil war may come a temporary victory of fascism and a military dictatorship, though two months in Spain have convinced me that the fascists can never permanently hold the land. There may come a truce in which foreign and domestic rifles rule with or without a torn and treason-soiled democratic flag flying from their bayonet points. But that cannot be permanent either, for it is impossible to keep a permanent army of occupation in Spain of sufficient size to maintain such a regime indefinitely. There may come a partition of Spain into German, Italian, French and English spheres of influence, to be followed inevitably by a fresh flare-up of revolutionary war of independence, unification and socialism. Or there may be a victory of the proletarian revolution in Spain insuring the triumphant waging of a revolutionary war against military dictatorship and foreign invasion and the retaking of the entire Iberian peninsula. In short, almost anything may happen in Spain—anything, that is, except the establishment of a bourgeois, democratic, parliamentary republic. That alone is excluded by the very nature of the social forces, internal and international, clashing in the Spanish civil war.\n\nPrerequisites for a Parliamentary Republic\n\nParliamentary republics cannot be pulled like rabbits out of a hat nor conjured onto the stage of history by the incantations of a Comintern thesis. They require a powerful progressive and revolutionary bourgeoisie, strong enough to dominate all other classes, Jacobin enough to exterminate feudalism by its roots, revolutionary enough to employ dictatorship and terror against reaction; they require a bourgeoisie confident of the grandeur of its own destiny, strong in prestige among other classes, unafraid of its proletariat so that it cannot think of surrendering to reaction. Nascent parliamentary republics require a proletariat so weak and immature that it does not even conceive of itself as a separate class nor dream of ruling in its own name, a proletariat whose revolutionary horizon does not extend beyond the vision of forcing the bourgeoisie to follow to the end its revolutionary role.\n\nSuch a situation has in general not existed in Europe since 1848. The great future of the bourgeoisie today lies wholly in the past. No abracadabra of People’s Front spells can possibly redissolve the proletariat into the vague conglomerate of the undifferentiated people, the third estate The bourgeoisie has long ago become more afraid of its mighty offspring than of its aging and tyrannical parent. On a world scale, it has long ago become a reactionary class, proceeding now with concealment, corruption and democracy, and now with naked force, to destroy the progressive institutions which in the days of its vigorous youth it conceived and created.\n\nToday, as backward Russia proved in 1905 and 1917, as advanced Germany proved in 1918, as Spain is proving to those who are not willfully blind or under instructions not to see, a new bourgeoisie can consolidate its rule only by vile partnership with feudal reaction or by naked fascist force, and only after it has crushed its proletariat in fire and blood. And today, as Lenin so conclusively demonstrated, only the proletariat in power and supported by the peasantry can root out feudalism in any land where it still exists, and only by transforming in its own image the bourgeois democratic revolution into the proletarian revolution\n\nNo spell nor incantation can make the mighty ghosts of the past tread again the boards of history. Paderewski and Pilsudski, Noske and Hindenburg, Azaña and Negrín, are no Robespierres and Marats. Invocations of 1776 and 1789 will not alter the social content of 1937. The social revolution of the twentieth century cannot draw its poetry from the past; it can draw that poetry only from the future. The hope of mankind in an hour of great desperation lies in the kindling of the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, not in the dimming of the stage lights and the trotting out of the phosphorescent bones of the moldering ghost of bourgeois revolution whose little hour upon the stage has passed forever.\n\nLaying the Specter of Revolution\n\nThe Spanish capitalist class is feeble, rachitic, cowardly and treacherous. It is the weakest social class in Spain. It has shown sporadic strength only against the proletariat, and then only when backed by a military apparatus it itself was powerless to create and impotent to destroy. For years it gave little shadow pushes against the tottering throne of Alfonso, but hastened to give substantial support whenever the throne’s teetering seemed too violent. At last the Republican Revolution of April 14, 1931 took it completely by surprise.\n\nThe fourteenth in the morning, wrote one of its leaders, when we saw that the people had taken the streets, there was no way out (no tuvimos mas remedio) but to go to the City Hall and Parliament Building and raise the Republican banner.\n\nSuch is the Spanish bourgeoisie’s 1789! Marx’s formula, Once in tragedy, the second time in farce, is too strong for such a situation: even farce requires an energy beyond their feeble powers.\n\nFaced with the flight of the monarch and the embarrassing parenthood of an unwished-for infant republic, the one desire of these twentieth century Jacobins was to stop the revolution before it had really gotten started. They protected the flight of the king. They protected the landowners against the peasants and themselves against the proletariat. They left the monarchist bureaucratic apparatus undisturbed: They stopped the fleeing feudal-monarchical generals whose hands were red with the blood of so many repressions, but not to put them on trial for their crimes. Instead, they restored them to their places as masters of the apparatus of force which is the real determinant of the class nature of political power. To the masses whose Gulliver-like stirrings in their sleep had snapped the packthreads of monarchy and terrified these pigmy politicians, they proclaimed, before the real revolution had even begun: The revolution is over: as you were!\n\nBuilding the New Order\n\nEven the symbols of monarchy remained intact. For months I continued to receive my mail from Spain bearing postage stamps still adorned with the ugly physiognomy of Alfonso XIII across which had been stamped the words República Española. After all, they had been printed and had to be used up: this petty bourgeois revolution was nothing if not economical. At last, the day came when the supply of Alphonsine faces was exhausted and my mail arrived bearing a new stamp. I scanned it anxiously with the aid of a magnifying glass. In discreet and tiny letters it bore the revolutionary motto: Fomentar el arbor (Plant a tree)!\n\nThe bourgeoisie was in a cold sweat at the specter of revolution. Its panic took a parliamentary and constitutional form. The initiative must at all costs be taken out of the street and the field and into the legislative hall. The masses must be lulled into slumber once more by the twilight twitterings of this strange birdcage of parliamentary people’s representatives. At the same time, Sanjurjo and Goded, Franco and Mola and Quiepo de Llano were dragged still trembling out of the limbo of history by the new Republican War Minister Manuel Azaña, and restored to their places of power. If oratory would not suffice to lull the masses back to sleep, then the guns would have their say. The oratory provided the trimmings, the guns provided the reality of the young parliamentary republic.\n\nTo make a written constitution, wrote Lassalle, is the easiest thing in the world; it can be done in three days. It is the last thing that should be done. If it is produced prematurely before the Revolution has changed the foundations of the old order, it is false.\n\nThe new republican constitution was produced in Spain immediately. It was patched up out of the dying Weimar Constitution and the Mexican Constitution that had never come to life. To these elements were added lyrical trimmings that only Spanish intellectuals turned statesmen were capable of providing.\n\nOne night, writes Maurín, Alcala Zamora believed he could leave the Chamber for a moment, leaving Socialists and Republicans to themselves. But just then, Araquistain, Socialist deputy, driven by the devil of mischief, got the idea of proposing an amendment to Article I of the Constitution, to make it read that ’Spain is a Workers’ Republic. The Chamber was almost deserted. The previous question was called and the motion got a majority.\n\nNext morning, when Alcala Zamora learned what had happened, he rebuked the bad boys of the preceding evening and, with general approval, sent Article I to the repair shop.\n\nIt came out reading:\n\nSpain is a Republic of the Workers of All Classes!\n\nBut before the constitution was completed and in operation, a clause was added providing for its own suspension. It was the only clause in the Constitution that was ever carried out in life. It was applied not against the monarchist generals, but with the aid of the monarchist generals against the proletariat and peasantry who had made the revolution. It is a measure of the republicanism of the Spanish bourgeoisie and their republican politicians, and of the depth of the bourgeois republican revolution.\n\nChapter II. How Azaña Prepared the Rebellion\n\nManuel Azaña is today the People’s Front President of Spain, During the first days of the Spanish Republic he was its War Minister: in fact he assumed that post on the very day of the Republic’s birth, April 14, 1931, His conduct in that key post teaches the Spanish masses what they can expect from the Republican leaders of the People’s Front.\n\nIn periods of sharp class struggle and social revolution, the armed forces become openly the key to political power. They are the ultimate basis on which rests the rule of any dominant class; hence every revolution in history has found its ultimate decision in the reorganizing of the armed forces: in the disarming of the reactionary class and the arming of the revolutionaries. Cromwell’s Ironsides, France’s National Guard, Ireland’s Republican Army, America’s Minute Men and Continental Army, Russia’s Red Guard and Red Army, are all evidences of this truism.\n\nBut the Spanish Republican bourgeoisie is far more afraid of the proletariat than it is of the landowners. More than it fears feudalism, clericalism and monarchism, it fears socialism; more than the armed reaction, the armed masses. It is a coward class afraid of its own destiny. Therefore it dared not overthrow Primo de Rivera, dared not overthrow Alfonso. When at last the masses took things into their own hands, drove out dictator and monarch, and handed the power to the trembling Republicans, the latter, with Azaña at their head, made no move to disarm the feudal-monarchist military apparatus. Rather did they seek to restore discipline, keep the military machine intact, render it more efficient.\n\nThe Spanish Army\n\nThe war machine that Azaña took over was one of the worst and most reactionary in Europe. It had three times as many officers as the mighty French military mechanism! They had been recruited by the monarchy from the sons of the feudal landowning families. They were monarchists to their manicured finger tips. They had secured advancement by court intrigue and military coups and replenished their purses by notorious graft and corruption. The army had been for decades a magnificent tax-eating machine, utterly incompetent for national defense or imperialist aggression, with a long and inglorious record of defeats in Cuba, the Philippines and Morocco. It was skilled only in military pronunciamientos (the very word has passed into international speech) and in fire at close range upon Spanish peasants and workers. In this it was supplemented by the hated Civil Guard with a record of half a century of petty and brutal tyranny, and the frontier and treasury guards known as the carabineros. Azaña increased the army from 105,000 men to 130,000, the Civil Guard and police force from 32,000 to 64,000; and the carabineros have recently been increased under Negrín (as head of the Treasury) from 4,000 to 40,000. To these, the Republic added an entirely new military formation, the Assault Guards, who were supposed to be pledged to loyalty to the Republic. Naturally, nothing was said about loyalty to the workers and peasants.\n\nAzaña’s Military Reforms\n\nThe republican War Minister did try to reduce the excessive number of officers. Naturally, he did not propose to use revolutionary means like the dismissal of monarchist generals and the appointment of republicans, nor the court-martial of those whose hands were stained with the blood of Spanish workers and peasants and republican revolutionaries. That would be too much like confiscation without compensation, and these bourgeois republicans had a deep-going sympathy with the protection of all vested interests against lawless expropriation. To induce a few generals to resign, Azaña offered them retirement with full pay, free passage on the railroads, preference in government and professional employment. Only a few officers took advantage of the offer, and they were the best of them, men who hated the corrupt atmosphere of army life or whose lives were made miserable by their reactionary fellow officers because they dared to sympathize with the Republic! But the hard-boiled reactionaries, the adepts of conspiracy and pronunciamiento, the realists who recognized that the army was the key to political power and to the maintenance of the privileges of their class, remained at their posts and began to plot for military dictatorship, monarchist restoration and counter-revolution.\n\nThe Case of General Mola\n\nGeneral Emilio Mola had been one of the most hated of the monarchist generals. When Primo de Rivera fell and the throne itself was shaking, military-dictator Berenguer had appointed him as Director of Public Safety in Madrid, rightly judging him to be a ruthless defender of the status quo against the aroused people. His bloody rule made him more hated even than Alfonso and when the King fled, the people went up and down the streets of Madrid shouting: Abajo Mola (Down with Mola)! He himself thought that his days were numbered. I left police headquarters, he writes in his memoirs, by a service stairway, alone, as a private citizen, and grabbing the first taxi that I found on the street, I went to hide myself in the house of a friend. But Azaña took him, trembling, out of his hiding place and restored the butcher of the Battle of San Carlos (where a few days earlier his troops had fired on and killed a number of demonstrating students) to his post as a general in the army. Recognizing this as carte blanche to continue his political activities, he immediately began to conspire with his fellow generals against the Republic. When Gil Robles became War Minister in 1934, General Mola was sent to Morocco where he completed his plans for the mutiny of the Foreign Legion. When Azaña became President in February 1936, he was removed from Morocco and sent to that center of feudal reaction, Navarre, where in the garrison fortress of Pamplona, he openly received emissaries from other parts of the army and completed his conspiracy.\n\nThe cases of General Franco, of General Sanjurjo, of General Goded, of General Queipo de Llano, are dishearteningly similar. The last named married the daughter of the first President of the Republic, Alcalá Zamora, and actually became Chief of the Presidential Military Staff! General Sanjurjo, Alfonso’s head of the hated Civil Guard, was continued in his post as protec­tor of the Republic until, on August 10, 1932, he led an uprising for the restoration of the monarchy. His uprising failed thanks to a prompt and united general strike of the anarchists, socialists and communists and unaffiliated workers of Seville, where the coup was attempted. Condemned to death, Sanjurjo was soon pardoned and released and died in a plane accident in July 1936 returning from Germany, after a conference with Hitler, to take charge of the military rebellion.\n\nThe Strange Case of Colonel Mangada\n\nIllustrated on page 29 [below] is the facsimile of an amazing document. It is entitled, Fascism in the Army or the Union of Spanish Military Men. Its author is Colonel Julio Mangada, retired; its date of issue March 28, 1936, that is, before the uprising of July of last year; and I purchased it at an ordinary bookstore in Madrid.\n\nThe pamphlet tells how Colonel Mangada was court-martialled, jailed, driven out of the army, for the sole crime of loyalty to the Republic. It reveals that the military conspiracy which brought about the rebellion of July 1936 had been going on since April 1931, throughout the existence of the Republic. It shows Mangada repeatedly warning his superiors, War Minister Azaña and the latter’s successors, Martinez Barrio and Hidalgo, of the plot against the Republic. It gives details of the conspiracy, names, dates, plans, documents, and extracts of his repeated reports to the government. It gives proof that Azaña’s assistant, the Sub-Secretary of War, was a monarchist conspirator, that officers who were friendly to the Republic were forced to resign or be court-matialled. Mangada himself was tried and imprisoned in 1931; released after the Sanjurjo revolt (which his warnings, had they been heeded, might have forestalled), then jailed again and finally forced to resign from the army. It proves that President Azaña knew exact details of the impending rebellion when on March 18, 1936, on a secret ultimatum from the fascist general staff, Azaña’s War Minister issued the following communication:\n\nIt has come to the knowledge of the Minister of War that certain rumors are insistently circulating concerning the state of mind of the officers and sub-officials of the army.\n\nThese rumors which can immediately be qualified as false and without foundation, tend without doubt to maintain public disquiet, sow animosities against the military men and undermine, if not destroy, discipline, the fundamental basis of the army.\n\nThe Minister of War has the honor of making public the fact that all the officers’ staff and petty officers of the Spanish Army, from the highest posts to the most modest, maintains itself within the limits of the most strict discipline, disposed at any moment to an exact fulfillment of its duties  and needless to say  obedience to the order of the legally constituted Government.\n\nWhat is true, and the Minister of War wants to certify to it, is that the Government of the Republic has learned, with sorrow and indignation, of the unjust attacks to which the officers of the Army have been subjected.\n\nThe Spanish military men, models of self-denial and loyalty, merit from all their fellow-citizens the respect, the affection and the gratitude which is due to those who have made, in the service and defense of the Fatherland and of the Republic, the sacrifice of their own lives, if national safety or national honor requires it.\n\nRemote from all political struggle, faithful servitors of the constituted power and guarantee of obedience to the popular will, all the component part of the armed forces of the nation ought to be considered by their fellow citizens as the strongest support of the Republican State, and only a criminal and tortuous desire to undermine it can explain the insults and the verbal and written attacks which have been directed against it.\n\nThe Government of the Republic applies and will apply the law against any one who persists in such an unpatriotic attitude. ...\n\nAt that moment, Azaña and his War Minister had in their possession an ultimatum from the fascist Union of Spanish Military Men demanding that they make such a statement, a copy of a subversive appeal of the same group to the Civil and Assault Guards to support the army in its coming uprising, and a statement Of the same Military Union proposing to crush the People’s Front government with bullets and to wipe out the following organizations and their principal leaders: The Republican Union, the Republican Left, the Catalan Esquerra, the Socialist Party and U.G.T., the Syndicalist Party, the Libertarian Socialist Federation, the P.O.U.M., the C.G.T.U., the C.N.T. and the F.A.L The following names were specifically mentioned: Martinez Barrio, Azaña, Companys, Largo Caballero, Andres Nin, Galan! The Communist Party (no doubt through an oversight, though one can imagine the vile factional misuse that would have been made if the name of the P.O.U.M. had been omitted!) is not included in the list, nor are any of its leaders.\n\nEngrave these names well in your memory, reads the fascist military manifesto. Neither under legal mask nor illegally, will the way be smoothed for what they intend. The bases of the People’s Front can only be imposed on Spain in the streets. With bullets! Before the army consents to the triumph of communism, it will crush the revolution forever. The revolutionary leaders will not again save themselves under the mantle of impunity with which they are covered by the fear of politicians and rulers. They will not escape from our hands without paying for their tremendous crimes!\n\nWhen the War Department endorsed the officers who had issued that circular, Colonel Mangada’s patience was exhausted, and on March 28, he issued to the people his report in the form of the pamphlet from which I have been quoting.\n\nChapter III. Storming the Heavens\n\nThe republican government received confidential notice on July 16, 1936 that the long projected military uprising was to be launched in Morocco the next morning. Its only response was \\the perpetration of a ghastly pun![1] On the seventeenth at dawn, in accordance with a prearranged schedule, the officers of the Foreign Legion declared themselves in rebellion and called upon the other garrisons to second their movement. One after another, the officers’ corps of other detachments followed suit. Yet, even now, the People’s Front government, which had so long known what was going on, made no move to stop the revolt!\n\nFor three days, the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth of July, it refused to dissolve the army, refused to free the soldiers from their duty of obeying their officers, refused to call upon them to arrest the revolting generals. The workers, without waiting for orders, declared a general strike, offered their services to crush the rebellion, and, as they had so often done before during the anxious months of governmental inaction, demanded arms. But the republican politicians, less afraid of a military dictatorship than of the masses in arms, refused to open the arsenals.\n\nThe government made frantic efforts to come to some sort of compromise with the rebellion, to recognize the power of the military dictatorship while retaining the externals of republican forms, in short, to surrender with dignity. To tempt the reaction to accept a compromise, they set up several transition governments in quick succession, each more to the right than its predecessor. Casares Quiroga yielded the prime ministership to Martinez Barrio; Martinez Barrio to José Giral.[2] Politicians who had openly opposed the People’s Front from the right were included in the successive cabinets and the representatives of the masses in the trade unions and working class parties were excluded. But the generals, flushed with the first taste of victory, were contemptuous of these maneuvers and refused to accept their surrender with dignity. They had no further use for these miserable puppets who had served their purpose as far as mouse-hearted inaction could serve. Did the rebellion not have the entire army behind it? What was the need of further pretense and compromise? They would accept nothing less than flight or resignation of the republican politicians and the establishment of an undisguised military dictatorship. All was over but the division of the spoils. Then the unexpected, the incredible happened!\n\nThe Proletarian Revolution Begins\n\nOn July 19, the workers of Barcelona, virtually unarmed, attacked the Barcelona barracks. They had a few pistols, concealed in their homes from the attempts of the republican officials to disarm them; a few sticks of dynamite taken from construction jobs; a few hunting rifles taken from sporting goods stores; some trucks and cars that they had commandeered on the streets. They had paving stones for barricades and the stout hearts of men accustomed to face the troops under monarchy and republic and they were determined not to permit the establishment of a fascist military dictatorship. Under the leadership of the C.N.T.,[3] the F.A.I.,[4] and the P.O.U.M.,[5] they advanced against the heavily armed garrison. As they advanced, they did what the government should have done, called upon the soldiers to come over to their side, to disobey and arrest their officers. They were greeted by rifle shots, cannon fire and a withering hail of machine gun bullets. Ascaso fell. Other heroes fell. But from behind men rushed forward to seize the rifles and pistols of the fallen. The advance continued. Soldiers within the barracks were shaken in their blind loyalty to their officers; the hail of bullets began going deliberately wide of the advancing target ; soldiers were disobeying their officers; some were raising white handkerchiefs, others were trying to arrest those who were giving the orders. In a great rush, the crowd surged forward and took the fortress! The government had refused to arm the workers: now they armed themselves from the arsenals of the Ataranzas Barracks.\n\nThis epic deed of the Barcelona workers saved Spain and changed the course of the history of our times. Immediately all cowardice, compromise and indecision were at an end: the military had found a force capable of opposing it. The next I day, July 20, stirred by the heroism of the Barcelona proletariat, the workers of Madrid attacked \\ the Montana Barracks on the edge of West Park. Backed this time by a section of the Assault Guards, they took the barracks by storm, and Madrid joined Barcelona. At the same time, proletarian revolution broke out all over Catalonia. Everywhere, C.N.T., F.A.I., U.G.T. and P.O.U.M. workers united to oppose the might of the proletariat to the might of the militarists. Within a week, all Catalonia, Valencia and Castille were in the hands of the workers and they were pressing forward towards the retaking of the rest of Spain. Everywhere, committees sprang up, somewhat analogous to the Soviets in Russia in 1917, spontaneous organs of struggle and administration such as the proletariat sets up after its large democratic fashion as great weapons of the masses whenever they go into motion on their own behalf. The government had refused to arm the proletariat; it armed itself. The government had failed to dissolve the army; the workers, aided by their brothers in the barracks, dissolved the army, arrested and executed its fascist officers, disarmed the forces of reaction. Militia committees armed the masses and began to drill them; factory committees took over the workshops and began to operate them; food committees attended to provisions and supplies; transport committees commandeered trucks and automobiles and trolleys and trains; peasant committees began seizing the great estates; committees took over the administration of towns and villages; patrol committees ferreted out fascists, examined suspicious travellers, suppressed conspiracies, executed revolutionary justice. Alongside the republican government that had failed the people in their hour of need, another government, a workers and peasants government, began to appear in embryonic form. To it the masses turned for guidance, for leadership, for orders. It was flesh of their flesh and bone of their bone: it enjoyed their confidence for it was the democratic and energetic expression of their own will.\n\nThe Dual Power\n\nBut at Madrid the other government remained still strangely inactive. It no longer refused arms to the workers, for they had taken them and armed themselves. It no longer tried to compromise with fascism, for the heroism of the Barcelona anarchosyndicalists and P.O.U.M.ists had made surrender and compromise impossible. Casares Quiroga, the Prime Minister who had sought to meet a military uprising by going to bed, disappeared. Manuel Azaña, the President and ex-War Minister who had kept these monarchist generals at their posts for five years until they had completed their plans for revolt, fled to a monastery. The deputies who had filled the Chamber with their lyrical bird cries became silent and for the most part went into hiding or sought safety in Paris. New and more left cabinets were formed but without the intervention of parliament. Having failed to give the masses leadership, they were now forced to appeal to representatives of the masses to enter the republican government, lest the masses consolidate a government of their own, a government of the committees, a government of the workers and peasants. The republican politicians, those who were not too cowardly to remain, offered to head the government, in order to head off the developing proletarian revolution.\n\nWhere the workers, for the moment, found their own head, they advanced with giant strides. Having reconquered Catalonia, they advanced far into rural Aragon. Having taken Madrid and Valencia, they reoccupied Castille and Valencia province. But the demoralized shadow government at Madrid continued to set the mark of vacillation, incompetence and the fear of the colossal forces it had to deal with, upon everything it did.\n\nIf we are to believe Leon Blum, and his public declaration on the question has never been denied, the Madrid government secretly assented to the shameful farce of non-intervention when he proposed it to them.\n\nIt possessed a 2,400,000,000 peseta gold reserve, one of the largest in the world outside of a handful of great powers; yet it made no serious attempt to purchase arms on a large scale for months, until 1 it was too late. Nor did it remove, even now, the old monarchist officers where the prompt action v of the working class had prevented them from declaring for the rebellion and had obliged them to assert that they had never wavered in their loyalty to the republic. In the months to come, all defeats were to be due to those two causes: lack of arms and treachery by unreliable officers!\n\nSpain was being led by two governments: one, the cabinet of bourgeois republican politicians that had proved and continued to prove its incompetence and unreliability, a government that derived its authority from inertia and habit and from the theoretical support of a parliament that had ceased to function and had disappeared; the other, a half-formed government of committees, leading the masses, yet only partially conscious of its authority and role. Upon the resolution of the issue of authority between these dual and distinct organs of power  cabinet nominally parliamentary or committees that were the germs of Soviets  depended the future of Spain.\n\nChapter IV. War and Revolution\n\nIN critical times the art of using language to conceal thought becomes to the ruling class and its political agents the most important of all the arts. Convention, habit and routine have lost their accustomed power: the masses shake off their age-old lethargy, lift their eyes in hope towards the citadels of power, seize barracks and overthrow bastilles almost literally with naked hands, question men and institutions that have no warrant but their age and oppressive weight, develop amazing initiative and begin to move on their own behalf. Then old political leaders hastily undergo a change of costume, ever easier than a change of heart, and appear bedecked in phrygian caps and red ribbons. Radical phraseology begins to sprout like a red rash all over the ancient and infirm body politic. The masses, so newly entered on the stage of politics, are confused; men and events are seen through rose-colored glasses till bitter experience teaches them to distinguish between the appearance and the reality, the phrase and the substance, the mask and the visage that hides behind it.\n\nDuring such periods of honeymoon confusion, everybody is a revolutionary and no one is so foolhardy as to come out openly against the revolution. The energy of the masqueraders is cautiously bent to the task of keeping it as much phrase and as little substance as possible, of slowing it up, preventing the application of its most urgently needed measures, and sabotaging it in its own name. For the sake of the revolution, the revolution itself must be postponed till better, i.e. less revolutionary, times.\n\nFirst Win the War ...\n\nOne of the most ingenious of these formulae is the slogan being advanced to sabotage the revolution in Spain: First win the war, then make the revolution. It is also one of the most dangerous, for all history teaches that truly democratic and popular wars can only be waged and won by revolutionary means. Indeed, Spain has already shown, as France in 1789, Russia in 1917, and Ethiopia by negative demonstration in 1935, that wars for freedom are lost if the revolution flags and can be won against the most fearful odds of internal opposition and foreign invasion of a coalesced reactionary world, if revolution frees the amazing energies latent in the masses of the population when they have taken their destinies in their own hands. Those energies far outweigh and demoralize the fighting force of superior armies sent against them (superior in arms and numbers and wealth and training, indeed in all save morale) for all armies are made up of workers and peasants and the revolution has an expansive power that is as incalculable as it is irresistible when it is freely developing according to its inner necessities and the laws of its own being.\n\nRosa Luxemburg has formulated the law of the relation between war and revolution in classic form in the following words:\n\nClass struggle and resistance to invasion are not opposed to each other, as the official legend would have us believe, but the former is the means and the expression of the latter. . . . The fearless prosecution of the class struggle has always proven the most effective weapon against foreign invasion. . . . The classic example of our own times is the Great French Revolution. In 1793, Paris, the heart of France, was surrounded by enemies. And yet Paris and France did not succumb to the European coalition. If, at that critical time, France was able to meet each new coalition of the enemy with a new and miraculous . . . burst of fighting spirit ... it was only because of the impetuous release of the inmost forces of society in class struggle. Today, in the perspective of a century, it is plain that only this intensification of the class struggle, that only the dictatorship of the French people and their fearless radicalism could raise means and forces from out of the very soil of France sufficient to defend and support a newborn society against a world of enemies, against the intrigues of a dynasty, against the treasonable machinations of the aristocrats, against the scheming of the clergy, against the treachery of the generals, against the hostility of sixty departments and provincial capitals, against the united armies and navies of monarchial Europe. The centuries have proven . . . that relentless class struggle is the power that awakens the spirit of self-sacrifice, the moral strength of the masses  that the class struggle is the best protection and the best defense against the foreign enemy.\n\nThe Transfer of Armed Power\n\nOn July 17, 1936 the bourgeois republic, the Azaña People’s Front government, proved incapable of proceeding against the armed rebellion just as it had been incapable of preventing it and incapable of disarming the feudal monarchy during five years of republican rule. The same social fact, that it feared the armed masses even more than the armed reaction, paralyzed it now as it had paralyzed it in the past. The war against fascism could not even begin until the masses began the revolution. On July 19, when the workers took matters into their own hands, disregarded the cowardly and treacherous government which was trying to negotiate surrender, violated the government’s decision not to arm them and established their own armed forces, they thereby began the war and the revolution in one. No amount of inconsistency in carrying through the revolution to all its conclusions and no amount of weakness in the conduct of certain phases of the war can obscure this fact. Indeed, the two go together in this also, for the conduct of the war has suffered in direct proportion with the weakness and inconsistencies of the proletariat in the carrying through of the revolution. But from this fact alone one thing at least is clear: if there had been no revolution, there would have been no war.\n\nIn the great cities, above all in Barcelona, the victorious workers, arms in hand and faced with the need of provisioning and equipping their armed forces, immediately proceeded to the seizure of the factories, the existent stocks of materials and foodstuffs, and the means of transportation. Thanks to that, they were able for a brief period to assume the offensive and advance far into Aragon and much of the rest of Spain. It is noteworthy that, once the workers lost the initiative to the government in place of constituting themselves as the government, loyalist Spain was never again, up to this writing, able to assume the offensive.\n\nThe President and Cabinet, powerless to prevent the seizure of the factories by the workers, did its best to limit and restrain. Its decrees are aimed at restricting seizures to factories whose owners have openly declared for the rebellion. But since the workers took the main industrial towns by storm within a few days of the outbreak of the rebellion (Barcelona in two days, Madrid in three, Valencia in less than a week), the majority of the owners of industry had neither time nor inclination to declare themselves fascists. Among these loyal factory owners, and the loyal landowners similarly circumstanced, and in the political organizations which they support and which defend them, is the real haven of the much talked of Fifth Column of sympathizers with and secret supporters of Franco, which the Communist Party pretends to see among the revolutionaries who saved Barcelona from fascism on July 19.\n\nThe Revolution on the Land\n\nThe next step of the masses under revolutionary leadership, still without the leadership and against the will of the republican ministers, was the wholesale seizure of the land, whereby the backbone of the economic power behind feudal-military reaction was broken, and the peasant was mobilized, by revolution, for the prosecution of the war. Later, the rehabilitated and reconstructed government, finally with a communist in the ungrateful role of official restrainer of land occupation and collectivization (Minister of Agriculture Uribe), sought to limit land seizure to the estates of openly fascist landowners. Whole villages and regions, as the recent trials of the communist Mayors of Villanueva de Alcardete and Villamayor have proved,[6] were put back under the leadership of the caciques, the old village tyrants in new republican and communist dress, and the center of gravity was shifted from the agricultural workers and poor peasants, mostly anarchists and socialists, to the middle peasants (Spanish equivalent of the Russian kulaks) and the old administrative bureaucracy.\n\nLandowners who were prevented by the rapid enveloping action of the masses from openly declaring their reactionary sympathies, are continued in their possessions and power or, where their estates are partially divided, are to be given compensation. Thus the economic power of rural reaction is to be partially changed in form but not destroyed, while the magnificent initiative of the landworkers and revolutionary peasants which mobilized the countryside for the war against fascism precisely where it is strongest, has been and is being discouraged and destroyed.\n\nChapter V. The Road to Victory\n\nFirst win the war; then make the revolution.\n\nThe falsity and danger of this slogan becomes obvious as soon as we put the question practically: What is needed for the winning of the war?\n\nTo win the war, it will be generally admitted, the following measures are necessary:\n\n1. The creation of a strong government.\n\n2. A powerful, unified and politically reliable army.\n\n3. A reliable safety corps for patrol behind the lines and the ferreting out of fascist nests and counter-revolutionary plots.\n\n4. A unified economy completely subordinated to the winning of the war.\n\n5. An effective appeal to the foreign troops invading the country and to the masses in the countries openly or covertly intriguing against Spain, an appeal which will mobilize them against the present policies of their governments and in favor of at least decent neutrality.\n\n6. A national and colonial policy proper to a free people: autonomy and the right of self-determination and free cooperation for all the national regions of the Spanish peninsula  above all freedom for the Moors.\n\nWe have purposely stated these needs in as neutral a form as possible. Except for points 5 and 6, they would be pretty universally accepted in governmental Spain. Yet every one of the above measures, upon closer analysis, reveals itself as requiring the extension of the revolution.\n\nA Strong Government\n\nWhat is a strong government, One enjoying the full confidence of the masses! One able to mobilize to the maximum that amazing energy, that rich enthusiasm, that proud self-confidence and capacity for initiative that is characteristic of the masses in revolutionary times. Once aroused, it has the irresistible power of an avalanche. But such a government is not something external to the masses; it is the organization of the masses themselves: it is the Paris Commune; it is the faubourgs and club and committees of 1793; it is the Soviets of 1905 and 1917; it is the network of committees that sprang up all over loyal Spain on July 19, 1936. Under the leadership of this embryonic workers and peasants government, the Spanish people armed themselves, recaptured Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, the whole of the provinces of Castille, Castillon, Catalonia, Aragon, Biscay, Asturias, Valencia, much of the rest of Spain. Though still virtually unarmed and entirely untrained, they actually assumed the offensive and defeated and rolled back the trained troops of the professional army in more than two-thirds of Spain! It is the only time, so far in the entire civil war, that the loyal side has been able to assume the offensive. Once the authority of the impotent, discredited, non-revolutionary Azaña government was restored and the overflowing tide of revolutionary enthusiasm channelized in the moldy ditches of bourgeois republicanism once more, neither arms nor training, nor the fashioning of a trained officers corps, has enabled the government side to assume the offensive again. The systematic sabotage of Catalonia by the Azaña government, precisely because it is the center of revolutionary energy as it is of large scale industry, has not a little to do with this. On the side of reaction is necessarily the superiority in training, equipment, professional officers, and support by foreign reaction. On the popular side, the only offset lies in numbers, in morale, in revolutionary enthusiasm, in the overwhelming tidal wave of the masses in motion that can dissolve opposing armies, create guerrilla support behind the enemy lines, stir up the masses to action in countries intriguing against them, make foreign powers afraid to intervene or paralyze their intervention because the contagion of the revolutionary morale demoralizes the armies of reaction.\n\nIt would have been only a short step from this network of committees and spontaneously created organs of the masses to the consolidation of delegates from factory, village, militia group, into a genuine workers and peasants government. Such governments represent the highest form of democracy the world has ever known (unless we except the primitive tribes) . They spring from the masses, are directly responsive to their wishes, subject to direct instruction and instantaneous recall, are really the masses themselves giving expression to their aroused and all-powerful will in organized form. Such a government would have destroyed the fifth column overnight by nationalizing the land, the banks and the factories, the economic basis of fascism and reaction. Only such a government could have created a reliable army, not only worker and peasant in its social composition (all armies are that), but worker and peasant in its officers corps and control  which is decisive in determining the class nature of the army. The Durrutis and Ascasos and Grossis who led the attacks upon the barracks on the first days of the revolution would have become the high command, and such professional military men as might have been used because of their technical knowledge would have been put under the strict control of worker-officers or commissars. The restoration of unreliable bourgeois officers to the supreme rank and the abolition of control by the workers organizations was to cost the government dear; the betrayal of Malaga, the breach in the impregnable iron ring around Bilbao, are only two of the most conspicuous examples of a whole series of betrayals that resulted from a failure to complete the revolutionary reorganization of the army.\n\nColonial Policy\n\nA workers and peasants government would have freed the Moors, and by radio and proclamation in the Moorish tongue would have mobilized all North Africa in a wave of enthusiastic solidarity and revolutionary fervor against Franco and his little handful of foreign legionaries. Defeated in the main centers of Spain, he would never have been able to bring the Moors over from Africa. His revolt would have collapsed before a single black-shirt or brown-shirt could have arrived, and swift revolutionary justice would have ended the Spanish military menace forever. How clear it becomes as soon as we analyse the terms war and revolution instead of treating them as metaphysical abstractions, that to make the revolution (even in this respect alone) would have meant to win the war, and that first win the war, then make the revolution, means to betray the revolution and to run the danger of losing the war. Indeed, if the Republic had made the agrarian revolution and freed the Moors, disarmed the fascist officers, reorganized the army basing it upon the armed masses, there would never have been any possibility of fascist revolt at all. But a bourgeois coalition government such as that of the People’s Front by its very nature is a government of the curbing of the revolutionary will of the masses and a government of slow, concealed and inglorious surrender to fascism and reaction. Today, after more than a year of civil war, the People’s Front government has still stubbornly refused to do elementary justice to the Moors and elementary benefit to its own cause by setting them free! By its nature it is a government bound hand and foot by the miserable ambitions of Spanish capitalism and imperialism and the voracious demands of British and French capital, though both former and latter have betrayed the cause of the Spanish people at every turn.\n\nA revolutionary government would have sent the unreliable Azañas about their business, stripped them of their power and prerogatives, including their power to sabotage the will of the masses, to intrigue with foreign powers, to negotiate possible compromises at the expense of the workers and peasants; in short, it would have stripped them instantly, as the Russian workers did Kerensky in 1917, of all their power to harm. But while militiamen brave death in the trenches at 10 pesetas a day, and workers behind the lines are paid less for their herculean efforts to organize a supply service for the war, Azaña still draws his 1,000,000 pesetas a year in wages and an additional equal sum for expenses, while a horde of budget-hungry officials and deputies continue to drain huge sums needed for the conduct of the war, and Negrín threatens to revive the Chamber of Deputies whose discreditable past should have been sufficient to bury it forever.\n\nA revolutionary government would have nationalized the banking system, thus stopping the flight of capital and devoting all economic resources as well as human to the winning of the war The present government, despite the pusillanimity of its petty-capitalist soul, is a veritable lion in the persecution of those who would take such revolutionary measures.\n\nA workers and peasants government would have devoted all the economic resources of the land to the winning of the war. It would have socialized and centralized under its control the whole of industry. Even bourgeois nations establish state capitalism and centralized economic control when they are engaged in life and death struggles  witness the state socialism of the world war. Louis Fischer, who cannot be suspected of partisanship in favor of a revolutionary policy in Spain since he has not even hesitated to invent facts and slanders against it, was forced to admit that the stores in Madrid still have heavy stocks of winter underwear, warm blankets, and flannel garments while four kilometers away the men who are defending the city sleep lightly clothed in frozen trenches (The Nation, December 12, 1936). Even a capitalist government with a bit of energy would have seized everything for the boys at the front and not let the militiamen in the snow-covered Guadarrama mountains spend the winter in the same overalls in which they had seized the strategic mountain range during the previous July.\n\nRevolutionary Government\n\nBut all these revolutionary policies and others which will suggest themselves to the reader if he peruses again the six-point program at the head of this article, require for their conception and execution a revolutionary government with revolutionary policies. As we have seen, it was but a little step from the network of committees, to a permanent government based upon those committees, a workers and peasants government. But this was not done because the syndicalist and anarchist organizations were prevented by their anarchist prejudices, the socialist and official communist parties by their reformist theories, from taking that next step. The syndicalist workers and peasants were hindered by anarchist training from even contemplating the problem of proletarian power. As usual, no politics in working class theory means bourgeois politics in practice. Only proletarian politics (in the revolutionary, not the reformist sense) can prevent the proletariat from being dragged in the political train of the bourgeoisie.\n\nOn the other hand, the socialist workers were hindered from understanding the needs of proletarian government by decades of social-democratic teachings in favor of bourgeois coalition government. The left wing of the Spanish Socialist Party was just beginning to approach a communist position on the question of class struggle and state power, when it was suddenly confused, demoralized and debauched by an aggressive attack on communist principles, made by the Communist Party itself, which had abandoned them in favor of class-collaboration under the hegemony of the petty bourgeoisie, and the disastrous theory of the People’s Front government. The Communist Party was the main driving force both in 1935 and in 1936 to rehabilitate the discredited Azaña.\n\nOnly the Workers Party of Marxist Unification (P.O.U.M.) remained true to communist principles and clearly placed the problem of proletarian power and program. It was not strong enough at this stage to swing it alone but by that single act it made itself the revolutionary leader of the Spanish working class, a position that it has brilliantly maintained despite slander, provocation and persecution by the Republican-Communist Party coalition and it has manifested the requisite revolutionary realism and flexibility to give concrete expression to the needs of the Spanish civil war and revolution at every turn in the complicated events. Slowly it wins ground for this program among the syndicalist, anarchist and socialist workers and the communist youth. We can fittingly close this article by reprinting the program which it offered in April 1937 during the Catalonian cabinet crisis of that month. That it should have had to advance such a program almost a year after the civil war and revolution began, indicates how the People’s Front government and its supporters, by sabotaging the revolution have hindered and imperilled the winning of the civil war.\n\nThe P.O U.M:s Program for the April Crisis\n\n1. Socialization of heavy industry and transport.\n\n2. Nationalization of banking.\n\n3. Municipalization of real estate.\n\n4. Building of an army controlled by the working class.\n\n5. Constitution of a single Interior Security Corps, based on the Guard Patrols and the Investigation Corps created by the revolution, and incorporating the old police organizations that have demonstrated their loyalty to the working class.\n\n6. Immediate offensive on the Aragon front.\n\n7. Reduction of high salaries.\n\n8. Monopoly of foreign trade.\n\n9. Creation of a powerful war industry, socialized and rigorously centralized.\n\n10. Nationalization of the land, insuring the product to those who work it and granting them the necessary credits. Collective cultivation of large estates and economic aid for those collective farms created during the course of the revolution which have demonstrated their vitality.\n\n11. Implacable fight against monopolists and profiteers by means of a rigorous direct control of the distribution and price of food-stuffs.\n\n12. Rapid and efficient organization of aerial and naval defense of all our territory.\n\n13. Convocation of a congress of delegates of workers’ and peasants’ unions and soldiers to lay the fundamental bases of the new regime and from which would arise a workers’ and peasants’ government  a government which would be the most democratic possible, which would express unequivocally the will of the great majority of the people, and which would have complete authority to ensure the new, revolutionary order.\n\nChapter VI. The Road to Counter-Revolution\n\nThe Name of a political party is no sure guide to its real program. How much have the Democratic and Republican parties of our country to do with democracy and republicanism respectively? What is there of radical or socialist in the Radical-Socialist party of France, or of socialist or labor in the German Nazi party, which calls itself the National Socialist German Labor Party? Not by their names but by their teachings, and above all by their deeds, must the political content of a party’s role be judged. Today in Spain, there is no more bitter opponent of communism than that party which bears the name: Communist Party of Spain. But it differs from the parties mentioned above in that its name once meant what it said. In that respect, it is more closely analogous to the old Social-Democratic Party of Germany or the Menshevik section of the old Russian Social-Democracy, whose names and past prestige were used to cloak the fact that they had become, in their respective lands, outstanding opponents of the things they had formerly espoused.\n\nWhy the C.P. Was Chosen\n\nOn the outbreak of military revolt in July 1936, the old Spanish ruling class was no longer able to rule in its own name. It was split by the revolt. The loyal section was reduced to a mere shell, a group of discredited politicians soiled by their own supineness and even guilty complicity in the preparation of that revolt. The armed masses had entered on the stage of history, not as passive spectators or scene-shifters, but as actors in their own behalf. All the signs, indications and necessities pointed to a workers and peasants government. The ruling class had lost belief in itself: the old politicians, the old shibboleths, had lost their power to sway or bewilder the masses; the old apparatus of force had gone over to fascism and the state had lost its power to suppress. Only a party of the working class could possibly confuse the masses; only shock troops recruited among the workers and acting ostensibly in their name could possibly suppress the masses  and confusion and suppression are the twin poles of capitalist, as of every minority-class rule. The only hope of the Spanish ruling class for continuing the rule of capitalism was to rule through some safe opposition party till the crisis should be past. If they could have used the syndicalists or the socialists (and they experimented with both, brought them into the government for a while, and still use their conservative wings), the Spanish bourgeoisie would have preferred them, for their popular following was enormous. But both these parties, despite lack of clarity and consequent unreliability from a proletarian standpoint, were too responsive to the pressure of the working class, too loyal and too democratically run to be dependable.\n\nWhen German capitalism was in a similar plight in 1918, it had called the Social-Democracy into the government. It was they who crushed the Spartacan revolt that the junkers themselves could never have crushed, put across a bourgeois republic when a soviet republic was on the order of the day, wrote the Weimar Constitution creating a democratic republic with profound social features (the very language is being repeated by the Spanish G.P. today!), murdered Liebknecht and Luxemburg as today the Spanish Communist Party has murdered Andres Nin. It was they who postponed revolutionary measures while the situation was revolutionary, continued the economic basis of capitalist power, retained the old bureaucratic military apparatus, alienated the backward masses which could only have been won by a revolutionary solution of their needs and jailed or slaughtered the vanguard that urged such measures; it was they who made possible, by these measures, the return of reaction and, under the aegis of a democratic republic with profound social features, made inevitable the rise of Hitler to power.\n\nThe Spanish C.P., which had so often and so lightly bandied about the words renegade and traitor and counter-revolutionist, voluntarily and aggressively assumed the renegade, the traitorous, the counter-revolutionary role! Not being the mighty mass force that the German Social-Democracy was in 1918, it cannot fill the role alone. Like Bottom the Weaver, it must play the lion of reaction on the government side, but it cannot fill the lion’s skin. Therefore, discredited republicans like Azaña and Companys, Basque Catholics like Irujo, and right-wing opponents of socialism and workers’ rule from the Socialist Party like Negrín and Prieto, help to fill out a paw or a bump, while the Communist Party of Spain roars through the head as gentle as any sucking dove in the name of the people of Spain. Bottom’s gentle roar was calculated, like theirs, not to frighten the honorable spectators he served; but the Communist Party is far from gentle in using claws and fangs to tear to pieces the P.O.U.M., to spring at Largo Caballero when they find he will not play their game, to jail thousands of members of the C.N.T. and U.G.T., and to drive both mighty organizations out of the government for the greater glory of the democratic republic. How ironical does the term People’s Front become after the two great trade union centers, between them comprising more than 4,000,000 workers and with their families and dependents more than two-thirds of all the people of Spain, have been driven out of the government of the People’s Front! What a commentary on C.P. maneuvers and the weakness of Largo Caballero who permitted Azaña, representing no one, to accept his resignation when he represented the majority of the Spanish people! Had he had the revolutionary clarity and consistency to demand a showdown as to who had the masses behind him, he or Azaña, there would be no Negrín government today, frantically seeking to resurrect a dead parliament and recall even Maura, the right-wing opponent of the People’s Front, and Valladares, the neutral in the civil war, so as to construct some show of legal warrant for their brazen coup d’etat engineered when Azaña bluffed Largo Caballero into resigning his post.\n\nThe Road to Degeneration\n\nHow, the reader will ask, did the party that once espoused communism and the rule of the working class and so bitterly opposed class collaboration, how did this party come to such a pass that it could assume this role? Its degeneration was gradual  a process, not a single act; and, on its road to counter-revolution, three mile-posts may be distinguished. The first is sectarianism which isolated it from the masses and, made it incapable of furthering the revolutionary cause. During this period, it expelled its best elements (more than half the party!) and became a fanatical opponent of working class unity. The second mile-post is opportunism, the adoption of class collaboration, the sabotaging and scuttling of the united workers front in favor of the bourgeois-led and bourgeois-programmed People’s Front. The third and last mile-post was opposition to the proletarian revolution in July 1936, the conspiracy to drive the U.G.T. and C.N.T. out of the government, the provocation of the May uprising in Barcelona, the frame-up and outlawry of the P.O.U.M. and the murder of Andres Nin. It had travelled a long way on the road to degeneration, and it had reached the end of the road. It is today the chief opponent of socialism, of worker and peasant government, of proletarian revolution, in Republican Spain.\n\nIt is worthwhile to examine its progress on this road a little more closely for it points the way the apostles of the People’s Front are treading in all lands.\n\nThe Withering Curse of Sectarianism\n\nThe overthrow of the monarchy in April 1931 came as a complete surprise to the Communist Party. It was occupied with the splitting of the trade unions, the denunciation of all other working class tendencies as agents of fascism or social-fascism and the expulsion of the majority of its members, including its founders and outstanding theoretical leaders, such as Joaquín Maurín, for opposing these suicidal tactics as injurious to communism and the working class. The sections of the working class which were closest to communism were denounced with especial bitterness as left social-fascists, the most dangerous fascists of all. So isolated was the party from the masses and so ignorant of their moods and the realities and possibilities of Spanish politics that it did not even participate in the elections of April 1931, the results of which caused Alfonso to flee.\n\nManuilsky, a Russian leader of the Communist International, declared the events in Spain of no special significance and assured the Spanish proletariat, anxious for guidance in the solution of its new problems, that the smallest strike in Germany is more important than everything that is happening in Spain. Walter Duranty, ever faithful chronicler of Stalinist views, sent a dispatch to the New York Times on April 18, 1931 (four days after the proclamation of the republic) which, in retrospect, assumes a more sinister significance than it seemed to have at the time:\n\nOne would naturally have expected Pravda, wrote Duranty, to salute the chance of a Spanish proletarian struggle for power with loud and glowing enthusiasm. . . . Instead of that Pravda’s first reaction was an editorial as stale as a damp squib.\n\nClearly, radical-sounding, ultra-leftist sectarianism is as much a desertion of the road to revolution by the left fork as opportunism is by the right.\n\nFighting the United Front From the Left\n\nThe great left swing had begun in the Spanish U.G.T. and Socialist Party but for over two years the C.P. bombarded it with spiteful spitballs labelled left social-fascism. When in 1933 the gigantic working class united front movement, known as the Alianza Obrera, got under way on the initiative of the P.O.U.M. in Barcelona and spread till it included the socialists, the U.G.T. and important sectors of the C.N.T. and F.A.I., the Communist Party turned its full battery of putty-blowers upon it. It was only at the eleventh hour, or rather a minute before midnight, that the Comintern, beginning its new turn towards the People’s Front line, ordered the C.P. of Spain to climb on to the band wagon of the Alianza Obrera as it began its general strike and armed revolt to prevent the peaceful entrance of the fascists into power.[7]\n\nFrom One Extreme to the Other\n\nBut the temporary support for the working class united front proved to be only a half way station in the 180° swing that the Comintern was then beginning to make from its old opposition to a workers front on the grounds that no other working class organization is good enough (all but the communists being social fascists ) to its new opposition to the workers front on the ground that all bourgeois-liberal organizations and a bourgeois program are good enough and therefore working class programs and the working class front must be scuttled in the name of a People’s Front.\n\nHence in 1935, when the heroic example of the Asturias revolt had stirred the working class and shaken the power of the Gil Robles-Lerroux government, when the masses had had their belly full of the democratic republic with its lamblike timidity in social reform and its lionlike courage in the defense of property and privilege and were in the mood for the creation of a workers and peasants government, and when the left wing of the Socialist Party had just won a majority for the two communist principles of workers front and workers government, the Communist Party of Spain, under orders from the Comintern, suddenly abandoned the communist position on these two questions in favor of People’s Front and the bourgeois republic!\n\nThe Rehabilitation of Azaña\n\nIt was the Communist Party which dragged Azaña from oblivion, where he deservedly rested because of his retention of the monarchist military apparatus and his guilt in breaking strikes and shedding peasant blood when he crushed with great ferocity the peasant movement of 1933 centering at Casas Viejas. It was the Communist Party that insisted that not a trade unionist like Largo Caballero but this discredited and blood-stained bourgeois republican politician should become the standard bearer and candidate for prime minister of the People’s Front. These moves alienated great sections of the peasantry and nearly cost the election. They completely demoralized the movement for workers front and workers government in the Socialist Party. Azaña drove a shrewd bargain for his class, his price for accepting the nomination being that there should be no talk of workers and peasants government nor arming of the workers and peasants and disarming of the reaction and that the People’s Front program should expressly reject the revolutionary expropriation of the large landowners, the nationalization of the state bank, socialization of industry and even a state unemployment system.\n\nThe demands of the People’s Front were made to center upon a mere amnesty law for political prisoners (which the aroused masses enforced by opening the prisons themselves), whereas even a bourgeois republican ’People’s Front government should have had as its minimum demand at least the disarming of the reaction, thereby rendering impossible the military revolt that everyone knew of and was talking about. But Azaña made it a condition of his deigning to accept the nomination as standard-bearer that this demand should not be made! And the Communist Party was willing to betray the republic to these Captains-Generals who later rose in the anticipated and long prepared revolt, merely for the sake of People’s Front collaboration with such agents of the big bourgeosie as Azaña whose influence over the petty bourgeoisie it should have been their major task to annihilate. The argument of the Comintern was that such class collaboration was necessary to win an alliance with the petty bourgeoisie. But actually this drove the petty bourgeoisie back into the arms of the big bourgeoisie. In place of the lower middle class following the proletariat, it followed the great bourgeoisie, while the proletariat followed it and on a program such as an Azaña could dictate.\n\nHind Sight\n\nOn September 8, 1936, José Díaz, leader of the Spanish C.P., was to admit in writing that the Azaña regime was very hesitating. . . . We knew that fascism could not triumph except through the military. The prime necessity was therefore to purge the army. . . . Unfortunately the latter (the People’s Front government) did not realize that it would have to make sweeping changes instead of limiting itself to a shifting of officers if a catastrophe was to be averted. . . . The putsch of July 18th surprised no one. Preparations had already been completed before the elections. . . .\n\nBut this amazing confession was made after the uprising, at the high tide of mass initiative and revolution, when Azaña had retreated to his monastery and the Largo Caballero government with U.G.T. and C.N.T. representation was in the offing. It did not prevent the José Díazes from provoking the crisis of May 1937 in which they persuaded none other than Azaña to return once more from retirement (a treachery thrice repeated is surely the limit of conscious treason!) and to demand the resignation of Largo Caballero, oust the representatives of the 4,000,000-headed organized labor movement of the U.G.T. and C.N.T. and set up, as the representatives of the people, the miserable minority government of right-wing socialists, bourgeois republicans, and Basque Catholics, plus the C.P., with the ill-omened Azaña as the real boss once more! It is this government which has outlawed the P.O.U.M., murdered Andres Nin and is attempting to outlaw the C.N.T., the F.A.I, and the Caballero majority of U.G.T.\n\nThe Comintern Decides the Line Long before the People’s Front dispensation (back in 1933 when the situation was far less revolutionary), the Comintern had declared:\n\nThe choice in Spain is between the dictatorship of the proletariat and fascist revolution. [8]\n\nBut now, in the face of the proletarian revolution already begun, it gives the Spanish Communist Party instructions to defend and consolidate the democratic parliamentary republic which guarantees (shades of Marx and Lenin!) all the rights and liberties of the Spanish people. It instructs the defending and consolidating of the republic of the People’s Front in which the material basis of fascism will be undermined and, though the material basis of fascism is the private ownership of industry and agriculture, the same resolution directs the Spanish C.P. to fight against the wholesale nationalization of industry and for nationalization only in the case of factories belonging to persons participating directly or indirectly in the rebellion. And it further endorses the guarding and protecting of the property rights and interests of the small and middle owners. . . . (All emphasis mine  B.D.W.) [9]\n\nIn the carrying out of this line, the Communist Party was more than zealous. In October 1936 it organized the middle peasants (kulaks) and rural bourgeoisie into a specially created Peasant Union to fight the twenty-year-old U.G.T. and C.N.T. agricultural workers unions  on the pretense that the latter were forcing the peasants into collectivization against their will. The kind of rural elements that rallied to this focal point for the defense of landed property may be judged by the typical case of Jativa where the former head of the local civil guard, who had arrested Julio Fuster Miralles, local leader of the U.G.T. agricultural union scores of times, became president of the C.P. peasants union! And hardened socialist opportunists like Margaret Nelkin, who in 1932 had told Ilya Ehrenburg: I find myself forced to use all possible means of restraining the peasants who want to revolt, hastened to join the Communist Party as more conservative than the Prieto-Negrín or Besteiro wings of the S.P.\n\nUnion Cards for the Bourgeoisie\n\nIn the countryside it organized the kulaks, the police agents, the caciques, the rural bourgeoisie. In the cities it became the organization of the professional bureaucrats, the small business men, speculators and owners of small and even large factories and agencies. In Madrid the former owner of the General Motors Agency expressed to me openly his expectation that Franco would win, his hatred of the anarchists, syndicalists and P.O.U.M., his plans to escape the country if necessary with his hoardings, his strategems to collect money undisturbed from his business as its wage-earning manager and responsible representative. Believing he was dealing with an ordinary American newspaperman, he offered to sell me rare masterpieces, including an El Greco, for smuggling out of the country. When I asked him how he got away with all this, he showed me his union membership card in the U.G.T.! When I asked prostitutes at the Hotel Florida how they could get food there when soldiers on leave from the front were turned away, they too displayed their membership cards in the U.G.T.\n\nIn Madrid that is an exception but in Catalonia there was virtually no U.G.T. when the civil war broke out. Here the C.N.T. had always had a virtual monopoly. But now the P.S.U.C. (Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, affiliated with the Communist. Party of Spain) has taken up the cause of the Catalonian bourgeoisie with a will. Its numbers swelled in no time from a few hundred to many tens of thousands. Its membership are not, as they undoubtedly are in Madrid, made up largely of front-fighters. As in Madrid, they have the bourgeois republican bureaucracy, but in Catalonia the front fighters are overwhelmingly syndicalist, anarchist and P.O.U.M.ist. In addition to the bureaucracy, they have recruited countless small and even middle business men, office workers, bank clerks and bank managers (the old managers and petty usurers fitted out with union cards) and they have gained complete control of the brand new Catalonian U.G.T. sectors which they have organized to fight Largo Caballero in the U.G.T. and to fight the C.N.T., the workers organization in Catalonia. It was this U.G.T. that was paraded in the columns of the Daily Worker as having repudiated Largo Caballero. It was these P.S.U.C. members who, while they furnished but few fighters for the front, supplied the shock troops of reaction in the rear that invaded the telephone exchange and syndicalist and anarchist headquarters in May 1937, provoking a spontaneous uprising even while Bilbao was in danger, because they were determined to disarm the Catalonian workers.\n\nA trade union page of their official organ would make a seasoned trade unionist’s hair stand on end. One finds notices of a meeting of the Employees of Bank, Bourse and Exchange, who of course adopt a resolution against the nationalization of banking; of the Government Officials and Employees of the Generalidad ; of the Egg Dealers Section with Egg Cards of the Union of Dealers in Meat, Game and Poultry. (I assure the reader that these are literal translations!) All of Barcelona’s petty, and not so petty, food speculators crowd into the U.G.T. the better to defend their vile profiteering in the necessities of life while Spain is burning. A typical entry from this source in the trade union columns of the Communist Press reads:\n\nThe Federation of Delicatessens, Foods and Allied Branches (U.G.T.) , composed of Retail Food Dealers of this City, . . . makes known its enthusiastic adherence to any campaign for the cheapening of food stuffs. ... It is ready to prove by producing the bills (familiar tradesman’s language!) that the price rise is not made in the food establishments but its origins must be sought in the centers of production and wholesale middlemen. This is their answer to a demonstration against war profiteering in the necessities of life, and it makes it clear why such situations can exist, as described by Louis Fischer, that the militiamen can shiver in winter in the trenches of the snow-capped Guadarrama range while the stores are full of warm woolen things. The employees of these same food speculators, organized in the Food Workers Union of the C.N.T., answered them with a publication of price lists as proofs that their unionized employers were in fact guilty of speculation.\n\nBut most amazing of all the affiliates of the U.G.T. of Catalonia is the celebrated G.E.P.C.I., the Federation of Owners of Small Commerce and Industry, with many separate employers unions affiliated to it! It is the most brilliant invention of the Communist Party in its guerrilla war against workers of Catalonia organized in the C.N.T. and against the P.O.U.M. and against all measures of socialization and revolution. It is in the Peasants Union, the P.S.U.C, the Catalonian U.G.T., and C.P. of Spain that the real reserves of the much-heralded fifth column can be found.\n\nNow, the reader can begin to understand why there is a joke current in Spain that if a man is too conservative to join the Republicans he joins the communists. H. H. Brailsford, who endorses the line of the Communist Party in Spain and opposes that of the P.O.U.M., wrote of the May days of 1937:\n\nThis was, like the Spartacist tragedy in Berlin, a struggle between reformism and the will to make a proletarian revolution. P.O.U.M. . . . represented the older and now heretical communist position.\n\nOf the Communist Party he wrote that it now constitutes the moderate center party in republican Spain. And, of its new composition, he offered the explanation and boast of one of its Catalonian leaders:\n\nMuch of the new membership, said the leader in question, has come from the ranks of the Equerra (left middle-class Republicans). The small middle class realizes that of the two parties ours is the stouter defender of small property.\n\nAnd so, he might have added, does the biggest bourgeoisie as well. From degeneration in analysis and tactics (ultra-leftist period) to degeneration in theory and principle (People’s Front period) to degeneration in historic role (counter-revolutionary driving force in Republican Spain) to degeneration in the composition of its membership  for in the long run a party attracts the support of those it serves  such has been the road of degeneration of the Communist Party of Spain. Today, nothing remains of its communism but the name and, upon that it daily brings disgrace that makes all true communists blush for shame. And, in pronouncing its traitor’s epitaph, we cannot hide from ourselves the fact that we are also pronouncing the epitaph of the Communist International whose leadership dictated this policy. It can no more survive the murder of Andres Nin and the attack on the Spanish revolution than the Second International did the murder of Liebknecht and Luxemburg and the struggle against proletarian revolution in Germany and Russia. In its ranks are still many thousands of good proletarian revolutionaries but, as a revolutionary international, it is committing suicide in Spain.\n\nChapter VII. Trotskyism and the Spanish Revolution\n\nNothing is more astonishing in the whole history of the Spanish civil war than the determination of the Stalinists to give Trotsky credit for the revolutionary sections of the U.G.T. and C.N.T., for the armed defense of workers rights by the Barcelona workers last May, and for the policies and existence of the P.O.U.M.! Certainly, it is not a falsehood calculated to injure or destroy Trotsky, but rather to rehabilitate him. And what is more, it is a credit he does not in the slightest deserve.\n\nAs once the First International was regarded as at the bottom of every strike occurring in the world, and even of the Chicago fire and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, so today Trotsky is given credit by the Stalin fiction-factory for every revolutionary movement in capitalist lands, and for leadership (ten years after his exile!) of every autonomous republic in the Soviet Union, control of every premier and party secretary, of every provincial soviet, of the general staff of the Red Army, the leadership of the G.P.U., twentyseven out of seventy members of the Central Committee, two members of the Polburo, ten heads of the planning commission, the entire leadership of the youth, and every piece of spoiled pork, every mismated pair of breed cattle, every grain weevil and every train wreck occurring over the socialist sixth of the earth! Truly Paul Bunyan and his big blue ox shrink into Lilliputian insignificance before this newest titanic anti-hero of Soviet fork lore; and, as for Baron Munchausen, let him look to his laurels! It is time he applied for admission to the Lenin School at Moscow for elementary instruction in art of which he once passed as a master.\n\nThe simple facts in the case are:\n\n1. The P.O.U.M. is not Trotskyist. Its membership and leadership come predominantly from the Communist Party, the Catalonian section of which was expelled in bloc during the ultra-left wave of 1929, for rejecting union-splitting, for advocating the tactics of the united front, for opposing the stupid theory that the rest of the working class was social fascist , for objecting to the mechanical transference of tactics to Spain which had no connection with Spanish realities. Its outstanding leader was Joaquín Maurín, repeatedly and bitterly attacked by Trotsky as centrist , opportunist , petty-bourgeois , main misleader of the Spanish proletariat , Menshevik traitor and similar choice epithets. (Stalin, it appears, has no monopoly on the vocabulary of factional abuse.) In his gentler moods, Trotsky pronounced Maurínism ... a mixture of petty bourgeois prejudices, ignorance, provincial science and petty politics , and concluded that ... the first step on the road to a revolutionary party in Spain must be to denounce the political vulgarity of Maurínism. In this, we must have no mercy . And, in justice to Trotsky’s handful  I am not using the word factionally as is so often the custom but literally and descriptively  in justice to Trotsky’s handful of followers in Spain be it said, this first step they have repeatedly taken and they are still marking time at the starting point indicated by their master on their road to a revolutionary party in Spain .\n\n2. Two of the leaders of the P.O.U.M., Andres Nin and Juan Andrade, were former followers of Trotsky. They broke with him almost five years ago when they rejected his instructions to enter the Second International. They fused with the Maurínists to form the P.O.U.M. as a united organization in September 1935. Since then, Trotsky has variously honored them as a mere tail of the ’left’ bourgeoisie , the traitors Nin and Andrade (this after the outbreak of the Spanish civil war!) and has declared that in Spain, genuine revolutionists will no doubt be found who will mercilessly expose the betrayal of Maurín, Nin, Andrade and Co., and lay the foundation for the Spanish Section of the Fourth International (January 22, 1936).\n\n3. The Trotskyites are not members of the P.O.U.M. The P.O.U.M. has a standing order for the expulsion of all Trotskyites. La Batalla has carried a number of articles polemizing against Trotskyism, not in the merciless , arrogant and insulting tone with which only Russians like Stalin and Trotsky can write of even their best political elements if they do not happen to serve their factional purposes in the party feud in the Soviet Union, but in a factual and theoretical form which both Trotskyites and Stalinites alike have long given up or forgotten.\n\n4. The Trotskyites in Spain (there were fourteen of them by actual count when I was there, and all but one or two were Belgian, French and Italian refugees, not Spaniards) have an organ of their own, appearing once every two months, called La Voz Leninista. Its main fire is directed against the P.O.U.M. Its issue of April 1937 declares: You cannot argue with honesty that the P.O.U.M. is a truly revolutionary party ... It substitutes Maurínism for Leninism, rhetoric for dialectics, public demonstrations for political agitation ( ! ! ! What do you make of that, reader?  B.D.W.). . . . Under cover of following ’the peculiarities of the Spanish revolution’, the leaders of the P.O.U.M. have done everything possible to strangle it. . . .\n\nDuring the May Days the Trotskyites were guilty of forging a leaflet in the name of the P.O.U.M.-C.N.T.-F.A.I. with only the obscure initials B.L. in small type to hint that it did not come from those organizations but, as a Hawkshaw or a Holmes might perhaps have been able to deduce, from the Bolshevik-Leninists, whose very name, much less initials, was unknown to the Spanish workers.\n\n5. The July 1937 English Edition of the Bulletin of the International Buro for the Fourth International, issued after the May events while the P.O.U.M. is underground and its best leaders assassinated or in jail for their revolutionary activities, declares that the P.O.U.M. leaders are Menshevik traitors who cover themselves with quasi-Bolshevik formulas. It urges a split in the P.O.U.M. and, noting growing friendly relations between the P.O.U.M. and the International Communist Opposition (the international grouping to which our American I.G.L.L. belongs), the Bulletin concludes: He who remains connected with the Brandlers . . . can only betray the proletariat on the very eve of the combat or during the combat. While the French Trotskyites were smashing the United Front for the Defense of the Spanish Revolution by their turning it into a divided front for attacks upon the P.O.U.M., the American Trotskyites were preparing an article (published in the Socialist Appeal) which declared: Are there still comrades abroad who believe the P.O.U.M. can be reformed, or that the demand for a new party would be premature?\n\nFactionalism in All Countries\n\nNowhere do these two Russian factions, Stalinism and Trotskyism, show their bankruptcy as constructive revolutionary forces more clearly than in Spain. Here is a living revolutionary struggle. Here is the P.O.U.M., the best revolutionary party that the Spanish working class has produced nay more, the best mass revolutionary party in the entire capitalist world. Stalinism, whose role in Spain has become directly counter-revolutionary, tries to crush it, demands its outlawry as the price of aid to republican-bourgeois Spain in tanks and planes and diplomacy. Surely one would think that Trotskyism would give the P.O.U.M. support  constructive and comradely criticism where necessary, and the most whole-hearted ungrudging solidarity and support. But no! Trotskyism, like Stalinism, believes that the fact that the Russians have made a victorious revolution gives them the monopoly of leadership of all movements throughout the world. In practice, neither can tolerate any movement anywhere in the world that does not recognize its leadership and factional aims in the controversy in the Russian party. The P.O.U.M. rejects the plan for the formation, at this time, of a Fourth International. Hence Trotsky makes open war upon it; calls for a split; substitutes destructive criticism and division for constructive criticism and support. In Spain, as elsewhere, the Trotskyites prove themselves to be in practice a disruptive and destructive force.\n\nBut a still more puzzling question remains unanswered: Why then does Stalinism seek to make Trotsky responsible for the P.O.U.M.? Why does it give the Trotskyites credit for a heroic revolutionary struggle, for a brilliant example of leadership under most difficult conditions, a leadership superior to that which the Communist Party of Germany gave the German workers when Hitler seized power, superior to that which Austrian socialists and communists gave the Austrian workers when Dollfuss seized power, the best leadership, with all its deficiencies, that any working class in open struggle has had since 1917? What can the motive of Stalin be in giving Trotsky a new lease on life, credit for a struggle which he has merely sabotaged and has not led?\n\nTrotsky has explained it in part with his theory of amalgams. Stalin finds it convenient to amalgamate all his opponents and critics in a single enemy mass  Bukharin and Trotsky and Tuchachevsky and Hitler and Franco and Japan. But amalgams do not explain the false prominence given to Trotsky in the amalgam. Trotsky seems to imagine that all the latest executions and frameups in the Soviet Union were made chiefly to frame him up. On the contrary, he has been made into a devil and given credit for leadership of the whole opposition to Stalin growing up in the Russian party and including every field of Soviet and party life, in order to frame up that new opposition. To do this, Stalin is ready to give Trotskyism something of a new and undeserved lease on life in the capitalist world. And he is willing to credit him with a leadership, ten years after his exile, of all the departments of soviet life, of army, navy, G.P.U., planning commission, provincial parties and autonomous republics and their governments. That is why Paul Bunyan has become a pigmy, Ananias a symbol of timorous veracity, and Baron Muenchausen’s adventures have come to sound as sober and truthful as the pages of Noah Webster or of the telephone book.\n\nChapter VIII. Anarchism, Socialism and the P.O.U.M.\n\nThe Spanish labor movement is about evenly divided between anarcho-syndicalism and socialist trade unionism. Spain is the only country in the world where syndicalism and anarchism are still mass forces. Anarchism has lingered longest in the countries of backward industry, weak bourgeoisie, numerous and radical peasantry, and strong survivals of feudalism and clericalism. It has survived longer and been more influential in Southern Europe than in Northern, in Latin countries than in Anglo-Saxon and Teutonic, in Catholic countries than in Protestant. In proportion as the bourgeoisie becomes powerful and modern industry and an industrial proletariat develop, anarcho-syndicalism tends to evolve and develop in the direction of Marxian socialism and socialist trade unionism. Therefore France is less anarchist than Italy; Italy less so than Spain.\n\nImportance of the Spanish Peasantry\n\nThe Spanish industrial working class is largely a peasantry in overalls. But yesterday, it left its native village where it had lived for centuries, to enter into the great centers of newly developed modern industry. It is a peasantry for which there is no counterpart in Europe. Nearly a third of the rural population consists of landworkers. An amazing proportion of these are organized or have passed through and remain sympathetic to labor organizations. Nearly another third of the rural population consists of share-croppers and yet another near-third consists of poor peasant families with insufficient landholdings for the maintenance of life at a human level. The layer of small and middle peasants owning sufficient land to maintain a regular livelihood is so thin as to be lost in the total rural mass; while the large landowners, mostly absentees, and few in total number, own more than a third of the surface of Spain and maintain much of it out of cultivation or cultivated on the exorbitant rent, feudal dues, or share-cropping basis. The peasantry and landworkers as a whole make up one of the most rebellious rural populations in Europe. They are accustomed to spontaneous local insurrections against local tyrants, and to prolonged periods of guerrilla warfare. The habit of seeing only the local tyrant, of the unplanned and spontaneous local uprising, of the taking of justice into their own hands, of direct action and guerrilla struggle, gives much of the ideology and outlook to the anarcho-syndicalist masses that have newly entered into industry.\n\nSpanish Anarchism\n\nThe theoretical arsenal of anarchism is derived from petty-bourgeois radicalism. It cherishes still the abstract shibboleths of the bourgeois Jacobin revolutionaries: liberty, equality, fraternity. There is no uniformity of ideology: liberty means first of all liberty for almost any apostol of anarchism to write almost anything he pleases in the great anarcho-syndicalist press. Gonzalo de Reparaz, venerable geographer and apologist for enlightened imperialism in North Africa, speaks in favor of his pet colonial scheme and the Federación Anarquista Ibérica publishes it as a pamphlet with a warm and glowing introduction concerning the great libertarian thinker who never compromised his ideas ! Anarchism is a species of courageous, unplanned, unscientific, and sporadic action on the part of men who are easily made drunk by glowing phrases, the political content of which they never trouble to analyze. Their idea of the revolution is a series of down withs and up withs  down with the state, the church, authority; up with liberty, free thought, brotherhood and libertarian communism. They are not troubled with problems of strategy and tactics, have no clear conception of the road to victory, and as the virtue corresponding to that defect, they have the stubborn courage to fight and fight and fight regardless of the odds, and never to know when they are defeated.\n\nTheir ideas on tactics are largely negative. The theory of no proletarian politics leads in practice to forcing the proletariat, when it wants to enter into politics, to support the left bourgeoisie, or remain passive, while the right bourgeoisie wins. Hence when they gave only a negative answer to the proletariat in 1931, the masses supported the republican bourgeoisie swelling a little clique of compromising and cowardly nonentities into a great force. The question then became: Who should take power, proletariat or bourgeoisie? The anarchist answer was: We do not believe in proletarian state power down with all states! The result in practice was the bourgeois republican state power. Again, in 1936, the anarchists having no proposal for proletarian politics, fell an easy victim of the bourgeois politics of the People’s Front and supported Azaña in the elections!\n\nWhen the civil war began, they were forced to take sides once more. Again it was for the U.G.T. and C.N.T. to decide to take power. The C.N.T. rejected the idea of the proletarian state, and was forced therefore to support once more and help resuscitate the bourgeois state. Being obliged to enter politics, they postponed the carrying out of their theories for the duration of the war (What kind of revolutionary theories are those which must be postponed during civil war?) and they sent four anarcho-syndicalists into the government as cabinet ministers. In the cabinet, these Ministers of Justice, Commerce, Industry, and Health (all of"
