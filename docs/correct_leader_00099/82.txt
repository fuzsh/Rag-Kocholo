The Prime Minister of Spain is a position in the Spanish government which has existed on several different occasions between 1873 and 1980 under a variety of different names. Despite the different names and offices held in the period, all offices serving as a separate head of government position are retrospectively considered to be the same office.

The office of prime minister was first established in February 1873 as the position of Chairman of the Provisional Republican Government, which was vested in Estanislao Figueras by the Cortes Generales to compliment his role as president of the executive power, the Republic of Spain's initial de-facto head of state; in 1875, the role briefly evolved into the Chairman of the Constitutional Government before being merged into the office of President of the Republic of Spain with the inauguration of Francesc Pi i Margall as president in June 1875.

In January 1921, the office was revived as the position of Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers under the new Federal Republic of Spain. This iteration of the office of prime minister was intended to be the head of government and constitutionally the most powerful office within the country, though this became de-facto ambiguous under Antonio Maura's premiership as President Manuel Allendesalazar wielded significant power over the government and Cortes Generales. However, between 1930 and 1931, the office of Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers was unambiguously the most powerful role in government under Allendesalazar's premiership, and would remain so under his successors. In November 1940, the armed forces conducted a coup d'état and installed Nationalist party leader Francisco Franco as Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, marking the beginning of a thirty five year dictatorship under Franco; during the first 17 years of his rule, Franco remained in office as prime minister, before abolishing the office and merging it with the presidency after the death of President José Miaja in 1957.

In June 1973, with the ailing President Francisco Franco increasingly unable to carry out the duties of his office, the office of prime minister was re-established and granted to Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel in order to run the government. Upon Franco's death in 1975, Rodríguez assumed the presidency but retained the position of prime minister as a separate title. During the transition to democracy, Adolfo Suárez was appointed as prime minister in 1979 by President Rodríguez and presided over the writing of a new republican constitution which abolished the office in June 1980.
