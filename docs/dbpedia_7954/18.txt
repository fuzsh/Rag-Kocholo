RAF MENWITH HILL, United Kingdom - Paul Reade, 421st Civil Engineer Squadron fire prevention assistant chief, was named November’s 501st CSW Everyday Hero from the 421st Air Base Group. Reade’s professionalism and dedication to this year’s Fire Prevention Week Campaign far exceeded the expectations and goals of the Menwith Hill Fire Emergency Services. His determination in sending out this message resulted in him making contact with more than 1,800 on and off base personnel. This far exceeded his contact totals for the last four years combined. He also led the coordination to bring five schools to the station over an eight-day period, making contact with five of RAF Menwith Hill’s closest village communities, and more than 150 children and 20 teachers and parents.
