Arranged and edited by John Davies and Paul Reade, all 28 pieces are in an approximate order of difficulty to provide a wide range of music for study and performance. With repertoire covering several centuries and including composers such as Brahms, Tchaikovsky and Schumann, this book aims to draw attention to technical aspects of playing such as tone quality, intonation dynamics and rhythm. Breath marks are included to encourage the rounding off of phrases and help students to establish a naturally expressive and stylistic mode of playing.",
