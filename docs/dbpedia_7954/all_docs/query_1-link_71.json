        "text": "A series of 13 films in which a walled garden is restored, and worked as it was 100 years ago.\n\nPresented by Peter Thoday with Head Gardener Harry Dodson 7: June\n\n'Flaming June' lives up to its name. Harry is kept busy manipulating the blinds and ventilators of the glasshouses, to protect the emerging tomatoes, cucumbers and melons. Peter shows how the development of the glasshouse allowed the Victorians to grow tropical fruits and flowers hitherto unknown in Britain.\n\nIn the garden the bees swarm, and Harry tackles slugs with soot, and wireworm with a carrot.\n\nThe briefness of the British summer.... renders the well-kept planthouse a place of most agreeable resort.\n\nSHIRLEY HIBBERD\n\nPhotography PAUL MORRIS Music by PAUL READE\n\nAssociate producer JENNIFER DAVIES Producer KEITH SHEATHER BBC Bristol\n\nBook: 'The Victorian Kitchen Garden ' (£10.95) and 1988 calendar (£4.95) available from retailers\n\n*CEEFAX SUBTITLES"
