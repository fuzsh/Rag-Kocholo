        "text": "Paul Reade was an English composer of last century.\n\nHe worked on the BBC TV in the '60s, becoming the pianist and songwriter for the children's Playschool for a few years. Children's music helped him to develop his facility to write fluently for a small number of instruments, which led in turn to some successful cartoon series, 'Crystal Tipps and Alistair' and 'Ludwig' amongst them.\n\nClassic series like A Tale of Two Cities and Jane Eyre revealed a composer of the high-rise level.\n\nThe Suite from the Victorian Kitchen Garden is a marvelous piece with five movements, each averaging to two minutes. The music movements create a different atmosphere for the nature, with Reade imitating the surrounding essence, from spring and summer, to a mist settling over the garden.
