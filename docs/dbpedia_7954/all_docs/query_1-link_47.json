        "text": "“Johnson soars with ease in the gorgeous Sarabande, delicately scored and rather haunting.” Gramophone\n\n\"Todd and Dankworth's jazzy and urbane works nicely complement Hawes's Finzi-like Concerto, all given committed performances by their dedicatee. Reade's Victorian Kitchen Garden Suite is a pleasant makeweight.\" BBC Music Magazine\n\n\"The British clarinettist, Emma Johnson, is a lively, delightful and eminent presence in the classical music scene. She has been a multiple prize-winner and in 1996 was awarded an MBE for her services to music. Not only has she made many recordings but also she has been the dedicatee of works by John Dankworth, Will Todd, Patrick Hawes, Michael Berkeley, Matthew Taylor and Robin Holloway. She also provides the very personal liner note here although the four composer profiles are by another hand (not identified). These four concertos or concerto-type works inhabit various related English styles but all of them are melodic. A predominance of contentment and poetry with the accent on the understated. Winning ways from Emma Johnson again.\"\n\nRob Barnett, MusicWeb-international.com"
