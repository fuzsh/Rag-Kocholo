She was one of the College's rare female students, because she was interested in the drama lessons it offered and its theatrical facilities. Afterwards, she applied four times to become a student of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, whose alumni included famed actors such Laurence Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft. Tate's application became accepted at her fourth attempt.\n\nIn the 1990s, Tate started her television career with small roles in the police procedural \"The Bill\" (1984-2010) and the fire-brigade themed drama \"London's Burning\" (1988-2002).

The show lasted for 1 series, consisting for 6 episodes.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, Tate performed at theatrical shows staged during the annual Edinburgh International Film Festival. The increased attention helped her gain a co-starring role in the sitcom \"Wild West\" (2002-2004).

It was a sketch comedy show, where Tate got to showcase some of the characters she had developed in her comedy routines. Among the most notable of them were the foul-mouthed grandmother Joannie \"Nan\" Taylor, and the argumentative teenager Lauren Cooper. The initial series lasted for 3 seasons. Tate has occasionally revived the characters in the number of television specials, broadcast from 2009 to 2015. The show allowed Tate to win 2 British Comedy Award, a Royal Television Society Award, and a National Television Award.\n\nTate's newfound popularity in the United Kingdom helped her receive more theatrical roles, and to make frequent guest appearances in other television shows. In 2006, Tate played the character Donna Noble in the \"Doctor Who\" Christmas special \"The Runaway Bride\". In the special, Donna is a secretary for a Torchwood Institute subsidiary company, who is about to get married to fiance.

In a number of published polls, Donna was praised by show fans as the second-best companion in the television show's history.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Tate appeared in the American sitcom \"The Office\" (2005-2013), playing the regular character Eleanour Donna \"Nellie\" Bertram. Nellie was depicted as a working-class British woman from the Borough of Basildon, Essex, who somehow got promoted to the position of President of Sabre's special projects. The character often commented at her impoverished background and lack of formal education, and it was implied that she was promoted due to favoritism.\n\nFreom 2013 to 2014, Tate appeared in the British sitcom \"Big School\" (2013-2014), playing the teacher Sarah Postern. The sitcom depicts comedic interactions between the teachers of Greybridge Secondary School, a typical British secondary school. Sarah is portrayed as an attractive French-language teacher, who is romantically pursued by the nerdy chemistry teacher Keith Church (played by David Walliams) and the stereotypical \"jerk jock\" sports teacher Trevor Gunn (played by Philip Glenister). The show lasted for 2 seasons, and a total of 12 episodes. While considered a ratings hit for the channel BBC One, it was criticized for its humor being overly traditional and inoffensive.\n\nIn 2017, Tate started doing voice work for the American animated television series \"DuckTales\" (2017-). She was cast in the role of Italian sorceress Magica De Spell, one of the main enemies of series protagonist Scrooge McDuck (played vy David Tennant). Tate served as the replacement for Magica's previous voice actress June Foray (1917-2017), who had died prior to the series' production.\n\nBy 2019, Tate was 51 years old, but she continued to remain popular in her native United Kingdom, and to make frequent appearances in American productions. She currently lives in the suburban town of Richmond, within Greater London. She lives with her 16-year-old daughter Erin, the result of a previous relationship. Tate has never married and remains a single mother.\n\nJulia Elizabeth Wells was born on October 1, 1935, in England. Her mother, Barbara Ward (Morris), and stepfather, both vaudeville performers, discovered her freakish but undeniably lovely four-octave singing voice and immediately got her a singing career. She performed in music halls throughout her childhood and teens, and at age 20, she launched her stage career in a London Palladium production of \"Cinderella\".\n\nAndrews came to Broadway in 1954 with \"The Boy Friend\", and became a bona fide star two years later in 1956, in the role of Eliza Doolittle in the unprecedented hit \"My Fair Lady\". Her star status continued in 1957, when she starred in the TV-production of Cinderella (1957) and through 1960, when she played \"Guenevere\" in \"Camelot\".\n\nIn 1963, Walt Disney asked Andrews if she would like to star in his upcoming production, a lavish musical fantasy that combined live-action and animation. She agreed on the condition if she didn't get the role of Doolittle in the pending film production of My Fair Lady (1964). After Audrey Hepburn was cast in My Fair Lady, Andrews made an auspicious film debut in Walt Disney's Mary Poppins (1964), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nAndrews continued to work on Broadway, until the release of Meine Lieder, meine Träume (1965), the highest-grossing movie of its day and one of the highest-grossing of all time. She soon found that audiences identified her only with singing, sugary-sweet nannies and governesses, and were reluctant to accept her in dramatic roles in Nur für Offiziere (1964) and Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Der zerrissene Vorhang (1966). In addition, the box-office showings of the musicals Julie subsequently made increasingly reflected the negative effects of the musical-film boom that she helped to create. Modern Millie - Reicher Mann gesucht (1967) was for a time the most successful film Universal had released, but it still couldn't compete with Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music for worldwide acclaim and recognition. Star! (1968) and Darling Lili (1970) also bombed at the box office.\n\nFortunately, Andrews did not let this keep her down. She worked in nightclubs and hosted a TV variety series in the 1970s. In 1979, Andrews returned to the big screen, appearing in films directed by her husband Blake Edwards, with roles that were entirely different from anything she had been seen in before. Andrews starred in 10 - Die Traumfrau (1979), S.O.B. - Hollywoods letzter Heuler (1981) and Victor/Victoria (1982), which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role.\n\nShe continued acting throughout the 1980s and 1990s in movies and TV, hosting several specials and starring in a short-lived sitcom. In 2001, she starred in Plötzlich Prinzessin! (2001), alongside then-newcomer Anne Hathaway. The family film was one of the most successful G-Rated films of that year, and Andrews reprised her role as Queen Clarisse Renaldi in Plötzlich Prinzessin 2 (2004). In recent years, Andrews appeared in Zahnfee auf Bewährung (2010), as well as a number of voice roles in Shrek 2 - Der tollkühne Held kehrt zurück (2004), Shrek der Dritte (2007), Verwünscht (2007), Für immer Shrek (2010), and Ich - Einfach unverbesserlich (2010).\n\nPaul William Walker IV was born in Glendale, California. He grew up together with his brothers, Caleb and Cody, and sisters, Ashlie and Amie. Their parents, Paul William Walker III, a sewer contractor, and Cheryl (Crabtree) Walker, a model, separated around September 2004. His grandfather, William Walker, was a Pearl Harbor survivor and a Navy middleweight boxing champion, while his maternal grandfather commanded a tank battalion in Italy under General Patton during World War II. Paul grew up active in sports like soccer and surfing. He had English and German ancestry.\n\nPaul was cast for the first season of the family sitcom, Throb (1986) and began modeling until he received a script for the 1994 movie, Tammy and the Teenage T-Rex (1994). He attended high school at Village Christian High School in Sun Valley, California, graduating in 1991. With encouragement from friends and an old casting agent who remembered him as a child, he decided to try his luck again with acting shortly after returning from College.\n\nHe starred in Road Trip ins Chaos (1998), a campy, silly but surprisingly fun film which failed to garner much attention. However, lack of attention would not be a problem for Paul Walker for long. With Pleasantville - Zu schön, um wahr zu sein (1998), he appeared in his first hit. As the town stud (a la 1950s) who more than meets his match in modern day Reese Witherspoon, he was one of the most memorable characters of the film. That same year, Paul and his then-girlfriend Rebecca had a baby girl named Meadow Walker (Meadow Rain Walker). Even though Paul publicly admitted that Meadow was not planned, he said that she is his number one priority. Paul and Rebecca separated and Meadow lives with her mother in Hawaii. She often visited with Paul as his homes in Santa Barbara and Huntington Beach, California.\n\nRoles in the teen hits Varsity Blues (1999), Eine wie keine (1999) and The Skulls - Alle Macht der Welt (2000) cemented Walker's continued rise to celebrity. He was chosen to be one of the young stars featured on the cover of Vanity Fair's annual Hollywood issue in April 2000. While the other stars on the cover, brooded and tried their best to look sexy and serious, Paul smiled brightly and showed why he is not part of the norm. This is one young actor who certainly stood apart from the rest of the crowd, not only with his talent but with his attitude. The Dallas Morning News commented in March of 2000 that, \"Paul is one of the rarest birds in Hollywood- a pretension free movie star.\" The latest blockbuster hit, The Fast and the Furious (2001), had raised his stardom to an even higher level.\n\nHis fighting scenes in movies lead to a passion for martial arts. He has studied various forms of Jujitsu, Taekwondo, Jeet Kune Do and Eskrima. Paul mentioned in a magazine interview that he had hoped enroll in the Keysi Fighting Method when it comes to the United States. Other than practicing martial arts, Paul enjoyed relaxing at home with his daughter, Meadow Rain, surfing near his Huntington Beach abode, walking his dogs and just driving.\n\nWhen Paul seriously did get a break from the entertainment business, he said he loved traveling. Paul had traveled to India, Fiji, Costa Rica, Sarawak, Brunei, Borneo and other parts of the Asian continent. Tragically, Paul Walker died in a car crash on Saturday November 30, 2013, after attending a charity event for \"Reach Out Worldwide\".\n\nSeveral of Paul's films were released after his death, include Hours - Wettlauf gegen die Zeit (2013), Brick Mansions (2014), and his final starring role in The Fast and the Furious series, Fast & Furious 7 (2015), part of which was completed after his death. The film's closing scenes paid tribute to Walker, whose character met with a happy ending, and rode off into the sunset. He appeared archival footage in Fast X (2023).\n\nSophia Jane Myles was born on March 18, 1980 in Hammersmith, London, England. She has a younger brother, Oliver.
