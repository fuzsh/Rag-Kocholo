By proceeding to access the information, users are deemed to have represented and warranted that the applicable laws and regulations of their relevant jurisdiction allow them to do so. No information contained on this website constitutes or would be deemed to constitute an invitation in any jurisdiction to invest or otherwise deal in Tetragon’s non-voting shares.\n\nRestrictions on Ownership by U.S. Persons\n\nTetragon’s shares have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933. Consequently, Tetragon shares may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, “U.S. persons” as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. No public offering of any Tetragon shares is being, or has been, made in the United States.\n\nIn addition, Tetragon has not been and will not be registered under the United States Investment Company Act of 1940. Direct or indirect beneficial ownership of securities issued by Tetragon to any U.S. person who is not a “qualified purchaser” as defined in the Investment Company Act and applicable rules thereunder is prohibited.
