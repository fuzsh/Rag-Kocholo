        "text": "British TV series or programme\n\nThe Victorian Kitchen GardenGenreGardeningBased onan idea by Jennifer DaviesDirected byKeith SheatherStarringComposerPaul ReadeCountry of originUnited KingdomOriginal languageEnglishNo. of episodes13ProductionProducerKeith SheatherProduction locationsLeverton, EnglandProduction companyBBCOriginal releaseNetworkBBC2Release1987 ( )RelatedThe Victorian Flower Garden, The Victorian Kitchen, Harry's Big Adventure, The Wartime Kitchen and Garden\n\nThe Victorian Kitchen Garden is a 13-part British television series produced in 1987 by Keith Sheather for BBC2, based on an idea by Jennifer Davies, who later became associate producer. It recreated a kitchen garden of the Victorian era at Leverton, Berkshire (near Chilton Foliat, Wiltshire). The presenter was the horticultural lecturer, Peter Thoday (1934-2023),[1] the master gardener was Harry Dodson, and the director was Keith Sheather.[2]\n\nThe theme music and soundtrack was composed by Paul Reade and performed principally by Emma Johnson playing the clarinet. It won the 1991 Ivor Novello award for best TV theme music.[3]\n\nContent\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series began in the largely derelict walled garden at Chilton Lodge, and followed Dodson and his assistant, Alison, as they recreated the working kitchen garden.\n\nThe work involved many repairs, from replanting the box (Buxus) edging and replacing the gravel walks, to reglazing the cold frames and repairing the Victorian wood-framed, brick-based glass-houses. The team were determined to use plants that the Victorian head gardener would have had available. The programme displayed the various tools and techniques of Victorian gardening. Dodson had used many of both and therefore could demonstrate how they were used.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nEpisode Title Airdate[4] 1 The Beginning 16 September 1987 2 January 23 September 1987 3 February 30 September 1987 4 March 7 October 1987 5 April 14 October 1987 6 May 21 October 1987 7 June 28 October 1987 8 July 4 November 1987 9 August 11 November 1987 10 September 18 November 1987 11 October 25 November 1987 12 November 2 December 1987 13 December 9 December 1987\n\nSequels and later availability\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series was successful and spawned three sequels:[5]\n\nThe Victorian Kitchen (with Ruth Mott), 1989\n\nThe Victorian Flower Garden, 1991\n\nThe Wartime Kitchen and Garden, 1993\n\nHarry's Big Adventure, 1994\n\nEach of the series (except for The Wartime Kitchen and Garden) is commercially available on DVD, distributed by Acorn Media UK. Accompanying books of all four series were written by the associate producer, Jennifer Davies, and published by BBC Books.\n\nThe Victorian Kitchen. London: B.B.C.
