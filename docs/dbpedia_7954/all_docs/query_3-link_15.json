        "text": "Composer Paul Reade died 25 years ago and this year marks his 80th birthday. He was well-known for his music for television such as Play School, Antiques Road Show and The Victorian Kitchen Garden series but less familiar are the wonderful works on this beautifully compiled album.\n\nThe evocative Flute Concerto and a new version of Victorian Kitchen Garden Suite arranged for flute are played by Philippa Davies with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Robin O‘Neill. Decca artist Pumeza Matshikiza is the soloist in the orchestral song cycle Chants du Roussillon and the Song of the Birds. Laurence Perkins is the bassoonist in the last piece Paul ever wrote, Catalonia, a one movement bassoon concerto. Also included is the Serenata for wind sextet played by London Winds. Except for the Chants du Roussillon, these are all world premiere recordings.\n\n★★★★★ “This celebration is long overdue…utterly gorgeous” – BBC Music Magazine"
