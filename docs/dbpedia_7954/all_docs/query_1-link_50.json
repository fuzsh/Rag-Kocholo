        "text": "Mozart Bassoon Concerto\n\nArguably the most popular solo work ever written for the bassoon, this delightful concerto was completed by the 18-year-old composer on 4th June 1774. To celebrate this 250th anniversary, Laurence Perkins will be giving special anniversary concert performances throughout 2024 and 2025, with a special offer to all U.K. amateur orchestras.\n\nCLICK HERE to go directly to the Mozart Bassoon Concerto webpage\n\n'A Paul Reade Celebration' album (Signum Classics) reaches No. 9 in the U.K. Specialist Classical Charts\n\nComposer Paul Reade died 25 years ago and 2023 marked his 80th birthday. Paul was well-known for his music for television such as Play School, Antiques Road Show and The Victorian Kitchen Garden series but less familiar are the wonderful works on this beautifully compiled album.\n\nLaurence Perkins is the soloist in 'Catalonia' - Paul's last work written in 1997, the year he died. It is inspired by and reminiscent of a wonderful music festival held in the Catalan region of southern France in the 1980s. Laurence also joined bassoonist Robin O'Neill and the members of London Winds to record 'Serenata' for wind sextet, another evocative work inspired by the same festival.\n\nWith fabulous music in stunning performances by flautist Philippa Davies, soprano Pumeza Matshikiza and the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Robin O'Neill, this is indeed a glorious celebration of music that deserves to be really well known!\n\nYou can order a CD copy or an MP3 download HERE - by purchasing the recording, you are helping to ensure that albums like this continue to be made. Many thanks!\n\nSample the recording on this short video...\n\nBased in Manchester, U.K., Laurence Perkins is one of Britain's leading bassoonists. As a soloist, principal orchestral player and as a tutor, he is a tireless champion of an instrument which to this day is less well-known and appreciated than it deserves to be. With an extensive catalogue of solo recordings, a vast number of solo recital and concerto performances, and numerous education projects (national and international) promoting the bassoon, Laurence is continuing this work with new recordings, imaginative concert programmes and innovative projects."
