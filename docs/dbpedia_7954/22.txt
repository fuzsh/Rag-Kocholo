The Reade surname is derived from the Old English word "read," meaning "red." It is most likely that the name was used as nickname for someone with red hair, before becoming their surname. 1 2

In other instances, the Reade surname no doubt came from some of the places so named in Britain, such as Read, Lancashire, Rede, Suffolk, and Reed in Hertfordshire. 3 4

Early Origins of the Reade family

The surname Reade was first found in Northumberland where they held a family seat from early times. One branch was found at Troughend-Ward. "The present house was built in the last century (c. 1700) by EIrington Reed, Esq., who also greatly improved the place by planting, and whose ancestors were settled in the township at a remote date. " 5

Another branch of the family was found at Weston in Suffolk. "Weston Hall, the ancient seat of the family of Rede, a handsome mansion in the Elizabethan style, was partly taken down within a few years, and the remainder converted into a farmhouse." 5

The first record of the family dates back to Saxon times when Leofwine se Reade was listed as an Old English Byname (1016-1020.) Years later, William Red was found in the Pipe Rolls for Gloucestershire in 1176 and William le Red was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Sussex in 1332. In Lancashire, the first record there was that of Hugo le Rede in the Curia Regis Rolls for 1220 and later in Sussex we found Hamo le Reed in the Subsidy Rolls for 1296. Later in Sussex, Thomas Read was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for 1327. In Hertfordshire, the Curia Regis Rolls include an entry for Ralph de Rede in 1203 and in Suffolk, John de Rede was listed in the Subsidy Rolls of 1327. 6

The Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 had two entries for the family: Godwin le Rede, Norfolk; and Roger le Rede, Herefordshire. 7 The source Testa de Nevill, sive Liber Feodorum, temp. Henry III-Edward I. included an entry for Robert le Rede, Surrey, Henry III-Edward I. 8

In Somerset, William Red and Robertte Rede were listed 1 Edward III (in the first year of the reign of King Edward III.) 9

The Reade Motto +

The motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Motto: Pax copia

Motto Translation: Peace, plenty.
