        "text": "Carley Elbert, the woman found dead on an Atlantic City jetty on Thursday had recently entered remission for a long-term illness.\n\nElbert, 32, from Sewell, NJ, and her friend Kamille Stewart, 29, of Pleasantville, both appear to have been shot in the head early Thursday, Aug 1, behind the Flagship Resort on N. Maine Avenue, according to police.\n\nStewart survived but remains in serious condition at AtlanticCare City division. Elbert, who was found wearing a bathing suit, was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nA Philadelphia man, Gregg Page, 34, has been charged with murder, attempted murder, and weapons offensives in the case.\n\nTwo other men, brothers Ryan Schenck, 30, and Ramir Schenck, 27, both from Philadelphia, were arrested for hindering the investigation\n\nDead Woman Had Overcome Life Support and Serious Illness\n\nElbert recently entered remission from mastocytosis, a rare condition that occurs when your body produces too many mast cells. Mast cells are part of your immune system that helps protect against allergens and germs.\n\nIn a Facebook post from 2017, Carley's mother gave an in-depth look at her daughter's severe condition.\n\nCarley Elbert Was An Entertainer\n\nIn a video on her Facebook page, Elbert described herself as an actor, rapper, and survivor of more than 200 near-death experiences.\n\n\"I try to keep things positive but I like to keep things real, too,\" she said.\n\nThe video referred to an upcoming live performance on Sept. 14.\n\n\"I'll let you know the details when it gets closer,\" Elbert said.\n\nAn online profile from her earlier career as an actor said she worked as an extra on television shows such as 'General Hospital' and 'The Elizabeth Smart Story.'\n\nElbert's mother, Nancy Elbert, was devastated by her daughter's tragic death.\n\n'I hope you rot in hell. I'll see this to the end for justice for my Carley,' Nancy, told 6ABC, sending a message to the suspects. 'She didn't deserve to go out like this.'"
