        "text": "Kate Phillips as Miss Scarlet and Stuart Martin as William Wellington (The Duke)\n\nIt’s almost time to travel back to Victorian England for Miss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4, jam-packed with more drama, puzzling crimes, and hilarious banter. From action-packed cases, to higher professional and emotional stakes than ever, here’s what we know so far about the new season. Read on to learn when Season 4 premieres, watch a trailer, find out where to watch new episodes, plus get some intriguing teasers from the cast and creator.\n\nWant to be the first to know about all things Miss Scarlet and The Duke? Subscribe our free MASTERPIECE email newsletter for updates on all our shows.\n\n1.\n\nMiss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4 Premiere Date\n\nSleuths and mystery fanatics, mark your calendars for the Miss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4 premiere on Sunday, January 7, 2024, at 8/7c only on MASTERPIECE on PBS (followed immediately by the Season 4 premiere of All Creatures Great and Small at 9/8c).\n\n2.\n\nWhat to Expect in Miss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4\n\nSome major moments shook things up in the Season 3 finale — most notably, when Eliza made the shocking decision to finally accept Nash’s job offer. But at the start of Season 4, we find that things are not going entirely smoothly over at Nash & Sons for Eliza. Meanwhile, outside of work, Eliza’s relationship with William is heading toward a looming decision that will shape both their lives.\n\n3.\n\nMiss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4 Teasers from the Creator and Cast\n\nWant some insider secrets on what to expect in Season 4? There’s no better source than the cast and creator themselves! Learn what squeal-worthy secrets they had to share about what is ahead.\n\nRachael New (Creator/Writer/Executive Producer): “Eliza’s got to decide: ‘Do I want to carry on in this kind of small business that I’m struggling with? Or do I want the weight and the clout of the most successful private detective agency in London behind me?’ That opens a box for her, like Pandora’s box.”\n\nWhen Arabella broke things off with the Duke at the end of Season 3 by pointing out his obvious feelings for Eliza, it was a “sharp kind of slap in the face” for the curmudgeonly Detective Inspector, said New. But the question remains: “Is [it] going to make him wake up and smell the coffee and realize that, you know, is it time to do something about [his feelings for Eliza]?”\n\nKate Phillips (Eliza) : According to the leading lady of the series, there will be “more about Eliza and William’s history [and] how they came to be.” Plus, “There’ll definitely be some more fun characters for you to meet that are really great and you’ll just love them. And more sparring and back and forth than ever!”\n\nAs for Eliza’s new job: “Nash & Sons allows her to meet lots of new people. She’s always looking to get one step ahead so the more people she meets, the more opportunities she has.”\n\nStuart Martin (The Duke): “There’s a lot of revelations, a lot of the emotional stories are really pushed and tested,” Martin teased. “We get to see Eliza and Duke really move forward in their relationship.”\n\nFelix Scott (Nash): “Eliza and Nash get into a lot of trouble. That’s their thing, that’s their M.O.,” said Scott. “There’s a lot more running around, there’s a lot of capering which is going around which is lots of fun.”\n\n[For more from the cast and creator on Season 4, read our full, exclusive interview published in February, 2023.]\n\n4.\n\nMiss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4 Episodes\n\nGet ready for six exciting new episodes in Season 4, with new episodes premiering every Sunday at 8/7c from January 7 to February 11, 2024.\n\nFor viewers who watch with PBS Passport, an added member benefit, all six episodes of Season 4 will be available to stream on January 7 at 8/7c. All three seasons of Miss Scarlet and The Duke are available now to watch on PBS Passport anytime. [PBS Passport viewing for this show available in the U.S. and Canada.]\n\nEpisode 1: Elysium\n\nEliza teams up with Duke to investigate a burglary in a high-end brothel whose clients include important members of the British government.\n\nEpisode 2: Six Feet Under\n\nWhen a close friend of Mr. Potts is murdered, Eliza finds herself investigating the dark and macabre world of Victorian undertakers.\n\nEpisode 3: Origins\n\nThe story of how it all began. It’s twelve years earlier and Duke and Eliza meet for the very first time.\n\nEpisode 4: The Diamond Feather\n\nThings are going well for Eliza until a familiar face shows up to question her role at Nash & Sons. Meanwhile, Duke receives an offer that brings their relationship to a crisis point.\n\nEpisode 5: The Calling\n\nEliza and Nash are still struggling to work together when an explosive case takes them into a cutthroat industry where people will kill to keep their secrets.\n\nEpisode 6: The Fugitive\n\nEliza is on the trail of a fugitive who is charged with murder. She must find him before the police do or risk losing everything.\n\n5.\n\nNew and Returning Cast of Miss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4\n\nKate Phillips (The Crown, Peaky Blinders) and Stuart Martin (Jamestown, Army of Thieves) are back as the dynamic, head-butting duo Eliza Scarlet and William “The Duke” Wellington, respectively. Also returning in Season 4 are Felix Scott (The Crown) as the devious Patrick Nash; Cathy Belton (Philomena) as the ever kind and supportive Ivy Woods; Evan McCabe (Doctor Who) as the Duke’s unofficial mentee Detective Oliver Fitzroy; Simon Ludders (Bridgerton) as the high-strung Mr. Potts (though much less high strung around his love, Ivy); and Tim Chipping (EastEnders) as the tough and occasionally shifty Detective Phelps.\n\nPlus, this season welcomes a couple of new faces to the scene: Paul Bazely (Black Mirror) — who also will appear in an episode of All Creatures Great and Small Season 4! — and Curtis Kantsa (The Sandman).\n\n6.\n\nFirst Look at Miss Scarlet and The Duke Season 4\n\nMASTERPIECE Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the latest news on your favorite dramas and mysteries, as well as exclusive content, video, sweepstakes and more.\n\nEnter Your Email Address\n\n*** START *** The plugin meta info in content-specialfeature.php:\n\n*** END **********************************************************************"
