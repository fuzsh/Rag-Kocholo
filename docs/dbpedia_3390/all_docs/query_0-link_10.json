Starting with this season, each episode would regularly feature cold opens with original footage instead of beginning with the opening title.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nTed and Robin are now a couple, and a heartbroken Marshall tries to move on without Lily. Barney and Ted try different ways to help him feel better, but only Robin can by taking him to a shooting range. Barney tries to encourage Marshall to date again, but continually sabotages any dates Marshall scores. Realizing art is not her true calling, Lily secretly returns to New York. Marshall initially rejects her offer to get back together, but when he eventually sees how far Lily will go to stop him dating someone else, they reunite. They begin to re-plan their wedding. Ted is shocked to discover his parents divorced without telling him and he vows to be more open with his children than his parents ever were with him. Ted and Robin fight when Robin accidentally mentions she finds Ted's work boring. Lily briefly lives with Barney who is surprised at how much he enjoys having a woman actually stick around for once. Robin struggles to say \"I love you\" to Ted. Barney loses a \"slap bet,\" which permits Marshall to slap him in the face five times at any point in the future, whenever Marshall chooses. Barney introduces his gay, black brother James (Wayne Brady) to Robin. James and Barney used to score men and women together, but Barney is shocked and disgusted when James reveals he is engaged. Barney refuses to attend the wedding until James announces he is adopting a child. Neither Barney nor James know who their biological fathers are but Barney believes that TV host Bob Barker is his, and takes a trip to California to compete on The Price is Right. Ted misses a flight to Chicago for a job interview which Future Ted believes changed the course of his life. Robin is offput when she realizes how much of Ted's apartment is made up of things he kept from his exes. Ted retaliates by asking her to give away her five dogs, as they are all from exes too. Ted initially clears his exes belongings and Robin gives away her dogs but the couple have a huge fight when Ted reveals he never actually got rid of his possessions. At the end of the fight, Ted and Robin decide to move in together. When Ted moves his things to her place, there is no room for him and Robin does not enjoy him living there. He moves back in with Lily and Marshall, who were already missing him anyway. Everyone discovers Robin was a teen pop star in Canada in the early 90s, with a hit single \"Let's Go To The Mall\". The music video is viewed by Barney hundreds of times. The lead-up to Lily and Marshall's wedding is a series of disasters so the couple skip the initial ceremony and get married outside with only Ted and Robin in attendance and Barney officiating (while crying).\n\nIn the season finale, at the wedding reception, Barney discovered Ted and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage. The season ends with Barney excited at the prospect of Ted and himself being single at the same time again.\n\nCast[]\n\nMain Cast\n\nIn order of character appearances\n\nJosh Radnor as Ted Mosby (22/22)\n\nJason Segel as Marshall Eriksen (22/22)\n\nAlyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin (22/22)\n\nNeil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson (22/22)\n\nCobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky (22/22)\n\nBob Saget as Future Ted (22/22) (Uncredited)\n\nRecurring Cast\n\nIn order of character appearances\n\nDavid Henrie as Luke Mosby (4/22)\n\nLyndsy Fonseca as Penny Mosby (4/22)\n\nJoe Nieves as Carl MacLaren (4/22)\n\nJoe Manganiello as Brad (3/22)\n\nCharlene Amoia as Wendy the Waitress (3/22)\n\nDavid Burtka as Scooter (1/22)\n\nWayne Brady as James Stinson (1/22)\n\nEmmitt Smith as Himself (1/22)\n\nBob Barker as Himself (1/22)\n\nLucy Hale as Katie Scherbatsky (1/22)\n\nMarshall Manesh as Ranjit (1/22)\n\nEpisode List: 2006-2007[]\n\nImage Title Writer(s) Director(s) Airdate # Where Were We?
