        "text": "The 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas stands as the richest prizefight in history by a hefty margin. A crowd of 16,219 (paid) produced a gate of $72,198,500.\n\nEighty years ago this week, on Aug. 4, 1944, a show at Madison Square Garden generated a larger gate, notwithstanding the fact that the main event was a non-title fight girded by a flimsy 5-fight undercard.\n\nYes, it takes some creative bookkeeping to say that this boxing card grossed more revenue on-site than Mayweather-Pacquiao, but before we finagle with the data, let’s meet the principals in the featured attraction, Bob Montgomery and Beau Jack.\n\nBob Montgomery\n\nOne of nine children born to a South Carolina sharecropper and a Cherokee mother, Bob Montgomery moved to Philadelphia in his mid-teens and was working in a laundry when he first ventured into a boxing gym. The “Bobcat” made his pro debut in Atlantic city at age 19 and was 26-1-2 when he secured his first good payday, locking horns with world lightweight champion Lew Jenkins in a non-title bout at Philadelphia’s American League baseball park.\n\nThat didn’t go well for Montgomery. He had Jenkins on the canvas in the third round, but Jenkins came on strong and won a unanimous decision.\n\nTwo fights later, Montgomery lost again, losing a narrow 10-round decision to Sammy Angott, his first of three losses to the future world lightweight champion. But Montgomery persevered and on May 21, 1943, he won the New York State version of the 135-pound title with a 15-round decision over Beau Jack at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThis would be the first of their four meetings, all of which were closely contested affairs at Madison Square Garden and all of which produced an upset. Jack turned the tables on Montgomery later that year, regaining the title, and the Philadelphia Bobcat took it back in March of 1944, rebounding from a devastating knockout (Al “Bummy” Davis flattened him in the first round) to edge Jack by a split decision.\n\nBeau Jack\n\nBeau Jack was born Sidney Walker in Waynesboro, Georgia, and raised on a farm on the outskirts of Augusta by his maternal grandmother who hoped that he would become a preacher. Lore has it that he first attracted notice fighting in battle royals at the Augusta National Golf Club and that the famous golfer Bobby Jones put the bite on the club’s wealthy white members to sponsor the lad who was packed off to Springfield, Massachusetts, to be tutored in the finer points of the sweet science. Beau never did learn the art of defense – he was a high-octane fighter who threw punches from all angles with no regard for what was coming back at him – and that made him America’s top box office attraction (cumulatively) during the World War II era.\n\nJack had his early pro fights in Augusta and nearby Aiken, South Carolina, and had 25 fights in Holyoke, Massachusetts, before making his New York debut in a 6-rounder at Brooklyn’s Ebbets Field on Aug. 5, 1941. Later that month, he made his first appearance at Madison Square Garden, the Mecca of Boxing, and within 15 months would be headlining shows at the fabled Big Apple sock palace.\n\nJack would eventually appear in 20 main events at Madison Square Garden, a record that will be hard to beat. Thirteen were compressed into a 33-month span preceding his fourth and final meeting with Bob Montgomery.\n\nMontgomery-Jack IV\n\nNon-title fights were common in this era. John Henry Lewis had a ridiculous 52 non-title fights during the three years (1935-38) when he was recognized as the world light heavyweight champion. In theory, no title was necessary to make Montgomery-Jack IV an alluring match-up. Styles make fights and their styles meshed well. And neither man had an advantage in terms of preparation. Both were mustered into the Army on the same day and both were furloughed on the same day to return to New York to finish their training and make the rounds with the boxing writers.\n\nNow let’s cut to the case. What made Montgomery-Jack so unique from the standpoint of gate receipts?\n\nTo procure a ticket to the event, one had to purchase a war bond. A pew in the first row cost $100,000. The second row sold for $50,000 and the third row for $25,000. But no one who purchased a pew in these rows was allowed to sit there. These choice seats, 164 in total, were reserved for wounded servicemen recently returned from battlefields in Europe and the Pacific. Their seats were donated to them by wealthy philanthropists who had to sit farther back if they had any interest in attending the show.\n\nBeyond these three rows, the arena was divided into three tiers corresponding to war bonds in $100, $50, and $25 denominations. According to post-fight reports, when the receipts were tabulated, fight-goers contributed $35,804,900 to Uncle Sam to help pay for the cost of the war. Montgomery and Jack fought for free as did the other boxers and their handlers. Promoter Mike Jacobs supposedly earned nothing and other expenses were born by the radio sponsor, the Gillette Safety Razor Co.\n\n—\n\nMontgomery-Jack IV was a good but not great fight. Beau Jack won a majority decision, knotting the series at 2-2 where it would remain. Altogether they fought 55 rounds and even after 55 rounds it was hard to separate them. A reporter summed the total of all the scorecards and the tally was 78 rounds for Jack, 77 for Montgomery, and 10 even.\n\nBob Montgomery post-fight\n\nMontgomery successfully defended his title twice before losing it to Ike Williams on a sixth-round stoppage before an announced crowd of 30,500 at Philadelphia’s Municipal (formerly Sesquicentennial) Stadium. His loss to Williams was his first of seven defeats to close out his career, reducing his final record to 75-19-3 (37 KOs). In retirement, he found work in a brewery when his savings ran out and dabbled in fight promotions. In 1995, with a big push from Philadelphia promoter J. Russell Peltz, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, joining his old rival Beau Jack in the Canastota shrine. The Bobcat died three years later at age 79 (some say 77) from complications of a stroke at a Coatsville, Pennsylvania VA hospital\n\nBeau Jack post-fight\n\nBeau Jack continued fighting until 1955, leaving the sport with a record of 91-24-5 (44 KOs). He was inducted into the IBHOF with the second class of 1991 and passed away nine years later at age 78 at a nursing home in Miami, succumbing to complications of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nAs a boy in Georgia, Jack worked as a shoeshine boy to help his grandmother make ends meet. After boxing, he returned to that occupation, operating a shoeshine stand at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach. In his spare time, he trained amateur boxers at the 5th Street Gym before that iconic establishment was shuttered in 1993. He had a wife and children in the area, but lived alone in a furnished room.\n\nJack, who purportedly never learned how to read, became Exhibit A whenever there was a movement to create a pension plan for boxers, but Beau wasn’t embarrassed by his circumstances. Photos of him in his boxing togs ornamented his shoeshine stand and he enjoyed talking with people who were familiar with his boxing exploits. Moreover, the Fontainebleau was brimming with big tippers and he undoubtedly made more money than any bootblack in the country. (But, yes, the image of a once-popular boxer, especially a black boxer, shining shoes is an image freighted with uncomfortable symbolism.)\n\nAbout That Gate:\n\nWorld War II war bonds were series e bonds that matured in 10 years. The announced gate for Montgomery-Jack IV ($35,804.900) was the face value of the bonds if all were turned in on the day of maturity. However, these particular bonds were sold at 75 percent of face value. That reduced the total amount collected to $26,898,675. Adjusted for inflation, that equals approximately $481 million in today’s dollars which leaves the Mayweather-Pacquiao gate in the dust.\n\nGranted, we are comparing apples and oranges. Those in attendance at the “War Bonds Fight” essentially gained admission by loaning money to the U.S. government, money that would eventually be returned to them or their heirs with interest. But it speaks well of boxing fans and the boxing community that they stepped up to the plate in our nation’s time of need.\n\nTo comment on this story in the Fight Forum CLICK HERE\n\nPost Views: 0\n\nTomoki Kameda, Japan’s “Little Mexican,” and the Glory Days of Japanese Boxing\n\nThis is a golden era for Japanese boxing. Japanese fighters own all the meaningful hardware at 118 and 122 pounds. That’s eight belts in all, four of which are the property of undisputed super bantamweight kingpin Naoya Inoue, the first Japanese boxer in history to sit atop the most prestigious of the pound-for-pound lists.\n\nJapan is also represented among the title-holders at 115 (Kosei Tanaka) and 112 (Seigo Yuri Akul) and has a potential featherweight title-holder in the mix in the form of Tomoki Kameda whose victory over Lerati Dlamini this past weekend was framed as an eliminator, making him next in line (in theory) to challenge the newly-crowned IBF featherweight champion Angelo Leo.\n\nKameda (pictured) has been around the block. Eleven years have passed since he won the WBO world bantamweight title in the Philippines with a unanimous decision over Namibia’s previously undefeated Paulus Ambunda and nine years have passed since he lost the strap in his third title defense, out-pointed by England’s Jamie McDonnell on a Matchroom card in Hidalgo, Texas.\n\nMcDonnell was the “A side” from the promoter’s want, but Kameda, who has had one of the most interesting careers of any active boxer, had the crowd in his corner. Hidalgo sits smack against the Mexican border. Virtually everyone there identifies as Latino or Hispanic.\n\nIn boxing, the term “Mexican style” is somewhat synonymous to “fan-friendly.” It suggests a high-pressure fighter whose best defense is a relentless offense. Tomoki Kameda took it a step further. At age 17, when he decided to turn pro, he took up residence in Mexico City. Fifteen of his first 23 pro fights were in Mexico, hence his nickname, “El Mexicanito,” a curious handle for a fighter from Osaka.\n\nKameda, who turned 33 last month, boasts a record of 42-4 (23 KOs). His losses were inflicted by McDonnell, twice, by Rey Vargas in a failed bid for Vargas’s super bantamweight title, and by the aforementioned Dlamini, a South African who upset Kameda in their first encounter. Both Kameda vs. Dlamini bouts, both staged in Japan, ended in split decisions, but there was no controversy when Kameda turned the tables in the rematch. The 116-111 tally submitted by visiting Nevada judge Robert Hoyle was considered the most accurate.\n\nIt’s a fair guess that a match between Kameda and Angelo Leo, should it transpire, would be held in Leo’s adopted hometown of Las Vegas. Kameda, for all his globetrotting, has fought in Las Vegas only once – back in 2014 on a Showtime card at the MGM Grand – but has spent many hours training there under the tutelage of Ismael Salas.\n\n—\n\nOver the next seven weeks, the Japanese boxing scene will be white-hot. The action begins on Tuesday of next week when Naoya Inoue defends his belts against TJ Doheny (26-4, 20 KOs). Hailing from Australia by way of Ireland, Doheny, a 37-year-old southpaw, has never been stopped.\n\nThere’s a first time for everything, as they say, and TJ Doheny’s first time will come on Sept. 3. (The bout will air on ESPN+, the capstone of a five-fight livestream that will commence in the wee hours of the morning in the U.S., specifically 2:30 am ET.)\n\nOn Sunday and Monday, Oct. 13 and 14, there will be back-to-back cards at Tokyo’s Ariake Arena.\n\nOn Oct. 13, Naoya’s younger brother Takuma Inoue (20-1, 5 KOs) defends his WBA 118-pound title against countryman Seiya Tsutsumi (11-0-2, KOs). Plus Kenshiro Teraji (23-1,14 KOs) moves up in weight to fight for the vacant WBA flyweight title with Nicaraguan veteran Cristofer Rosales (37-6, 22 KOs) in the opposite corner.\n\nOct. 14 marks the return of WBO bantamweight champion Junto Nakatani who is widely considered the best boxer from Japan not named Naoya Inoue. Nakatani (28-0, 21 KOs) is matched against mysterious Thai southpaw Tasana Salapat, aka Petch Sor Chitpattana, aka Petch CP Freshmart (76-1, 53 KOs). The supporting bouts include a match between WBO 118-pound title-holder Kosei Tanaka (20-1, 11 KOs) and South Africa’s obscure Phumelele Cafu (10-0-3, 8 KOs).\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, there’s a good chance that Nakatani, who is tall for his weight class, will move up a notch to challenge the baby-faced “Monster,” Naoya Inoue. Barring any slip-ups along the way, that would be the biggest domestic showdown in the annals of Japanese boxing and something more. It would arouse the interest of boxing fans around the world, indicative of the heightened status of boxing in the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nTo comment on this story in the Fight Forum CLICK HERE\n\nPost Views: 0\n\nNo riot this time.\n\nFloyd Mayweather brought his extravaganza to Mexico City and filled up the stands with two exhibitions and an abundance of Mexican-style fights on Saturday.\n\nBig banging Mexican fighter Alan Picasso (29-0-1, 16 KOs) slugged it out with Azat “Crazy A” Hovhannisyan (21-5, 17 KOs) and though he won by unanimous decision at Arena Ciudad de Mexico in front of more than 20,000 fans, he may not be ready for the A-team just yet.\n\nPicasso (pictured on the left) needed a few rounds to acclimate to the hard-charging Hovhannisyan who had last fought in February of last year in a breathtaking war with Luis Nery. Mexico City fans expected violence and got it.\n\nMaybe a little too much.\n\nFrom the opening round Hovhannisyan worked the body of Picasso and his high-waisted trunks. A few blows landed on the beltline and the Mexico City fighter immediately complained.\n\nThat’s good news for future Picasso foes.\n\nThough the referee allowed the body shots to remain part of the fight, he eventually deducted a point from the Armenian fighter and that’s when things began to slide downward for Crazy A.\n\nPicasso had the height, youth and supposedly power advantage but never came close to knocking down Hovhannisyan. He did use his youth to good advantage by out-working his foe toward the second half of the fight. And by using his reach from a distance at times.\n\nBut for 12 rounds both scrapped with few breaks in the fight.\n\nHovhannisyan taught Picasso some lessons with the right to the body followed by the right to the head. He scored with that combination repeatedly.\n\nPicasso showed off energy and more energy. The power shots did not seem to faze the Armenian fighter but after 12 rounds all three judges saw Picasso the winner 120-108, 118-110 twice.\n\nMayweather-Gotti\n\nIn the main event Mayweather and John Gotti III, grandson of New York mobster boss of the same name, clashed again in an exhibition. Unlike a year ago, their fight was not suspended by a referee. But there were shenanigans of a different sort.\n\nLast year, Mayweather and Gotti met in Miami and when their exhibition was stopped suddenly by referee Kenny Bayless, a riot erupted. This time, the first round lasted longer than the agreed upon two-minute frame and Gotti complained to the referee Hector Afu. The round stopped suddenly.\n\nIn the second round, Gotti complained twice about blows behind the head. They were actually blows to the back of the ear due to his keeping his head down, the referee Afu agreed they were illegal and stopped the fight. Mayweather motioned for him to leave the boxing ring and he left. Another referee, Alfredo Uruzquieta replaced him. The fight resumed.\n\nGotti showed decent boxing moves, strength and good speed but when you are boxing one of the best of all time its going to be like pulling a sled up a mountain. Mayweather did whatever he wanted.\n\nThe last two rounds saw Mayweather unleash pinpoint combinations on the bigger and stronger Gotti who tried his best to respond. Neither fighter was ever in danger of being hurt. Gotti landed some blows but never hurt Mayweather and vice versa.\n\nFans seemed puzzled by the end of the six-round fight despite knowing it was always an exhibition.\n\n“Thank you Mexico City,” said Mayweather.\n\nOther Bouts\n\nA battle between Mexican super bantamweights saw Guadalajara’s Cesar Vaca (17-1-1, 11 KOs) use clever movement and pinpoint punching to defeat hometown pugilist Luis Rodriguez (15-1, 14 KOs) by majority decision after 10 rounds.\n\nSouthpaw slugger Rodriguez never could figure out Vaca who was faster and more agile. The judges scored it 95-95, 98-92, 97-93 for Vaca. There were no knockdowns.\n\nVaca must have learned a thing or two from sparring with Japan’s “Monster” Naoya Inoue.\n\nHighly touted Las Vegas fighter Curmel Moton (5-0, 4 KOs) needed less than one-minute to unravel Mexico’s Victor Vazquez (5-3-1) with a three-punch knockout at 55 seconds of the first round of a lightweight fight. Moton is promoted by Mayweather Promotions.\n\nSuper middleweight prospect Aaron Silva (15-1, 12 KOs) fought last-minute replacement Alberto Artiga (6-14) and used less than four rounds to end the fight by technical knockout. Silva looked composed and patient in pressing the fight till the referee stopped the fight.\n\nIn a female light flyweight match between Mexican women, Cecilia Rodriguez (14-1-1) of Monterrey withstood the constant barrages by Mexico City’s Arlenn Sanchez (5-7-4) to win by unanimous decision after eight rounds.\n\nAn exhibition fight saw “Vicious” Victor Ortiz and Argentina’s Damian Coria spar eight rounds.\n\nTo comment on this story in the Fight Forum CLICK HERE\n\nPost Views: 0\n\nEven when Floyd “Money” Mayweather was a youngster his reputation as a superb boxer was known. Back in the 1990s he was gathering interest from promoters and fans like a bright light attracts moths.\n\nDecades have passed but interest remains in Mayweather.\n\nThe five-division world champion travels to Mexico City to fight John Gotti III on Saturday Aug. 24, at Arena Ciudad de Mexico. DAZN pay-per-view will stream the Mayweather Promotions event.\n\nIt’s an exhibition but there are several actual sanctioned pro fights including Alan Picasso (28-0-1, 16 KOs) versus Azat “Crazy A” Hovhannisyan (21-4, 17 KOs) in a regional WBC super bantamweight title clash.\n\n“I’m back in Mexico again,” said Mayweather who visited before in 2013 to promote his fight then against Saul “Canelo” Alvarez. “The pedigree of Mexico is truly unbelievable.”\n\nEvery time a fighter steps in the boxing ring there is a danger of getting permanently injured by a blow. At age 47 can Mayweather continue to evade that one fatal blow?\n\nMayweather is not the only boxer who continued to fight in exhibitions. The great heavyweight champion Jack Johnson similarly fought in exhibitions long after his pro career ended. Now Mayweather faces the bigger Gotti again.\n\n“Floyd honored his word and gave me the rematch. He didn’t have to,” said Gotti who fought Mayweather a year ago, but it was suddenly stopped. “We have to get in the trenches here and fight. There is no other way. If he has to get knocked out; if I have to get knocked out, so be it. It has to happen. Whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen.”\n\nEarly Mayweather\n\nAs a boxing journalist I always kept an ear open for top amateurs coming up. I remember hearing from amateur boxers like Carlos Navarro about Floyd Mayweather. And when Augie Sanchez defeated Mayweather in the amateurs it was a mind-blowing event in the amateur world.\n\nSanchez and Mayweather, both Las Vegans, fought many times in the amateurs, but never met as pros.\n\nThe first time I ever saw Mayweather perform as a pro was on the under card of Oscar De La Hoya when he moved up another weight division to face Mexico City’s Miguel Angel Gonzalez for the WBC super lightweight world title in Las Vegas on Jan. 18, 1997 at Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.\n\nI attended as a spectator for that event. I was in-between jobs and was not reporting on the fight. But I did want to see the impressive fight card. I sat with about a half dozen friends in the second row next to actor Mario Lopez.\n\nWe had just arrived when Mayweather dispatched his foe Jerry Cooper in the first round. I had wanted to see him perform and urged my friends to arrive early. We caught the stoppage. Back then Mayweather was a knockout puncher at the super featherweight level. Sharp and accurate.\n\nThink Shakur Stevenson but with a punch.\n\nMayweather was a sure thing. He proved it against the best like Genaro “Chicanito” Hernandez who he defeated for his first world title in 1998. Rudy Hernandez, brother and trainer of Genaro, stopped the fight in the eighth round. It was only the second loss of that fighter’s career and the last time he ever fought.\n\nOnce I visited a Mayweather training camp that took place in Big Bear, California. Back then it was a popular place to train. It was common to see fighters like Mike Tyson, Shane Mosley and others in the mountain environment.\n\nWhen Mayweather was in Big Bear he showed off incredible gymnastic feats on one of the exercise apparatus. It was like watching an Olympic gymnast. Aside from agility and reflexes he is naturally a very strong athlete.\n\nI followed his career closely after that Big Bear visit in the 90s. And when he was signed to fight the always dangerous Diego “Chico” Corrales who had won 29 out of 33 fights via knockout, I knew that Mayweather would take advantage of the openings. He convincingly defeated Corrales by stoppage after numerous knockdowns in January 2001.\n\nMayweather would go on to move up in weight divisions. I remember talking to him as he was leaving the boxing ring after defeating Jose Luis Castillo in their first encounter. Fans booed the decision and the Las Vegas fighter was angry that people thought otherwise.\n\nHe trounced Castillo in the lightweight title rematch.\n\nAnd when he fought the great Arturo Gatti in Atlantic City, many forget that Mayweather was the “B” side. I remember journalists laughing that I picked Mayweather to defeat Gatti. He knocked him down in the first round and ended the match in six.\n\nMayweather finally got his due when he met Zab “Super” Judah in April 2006 for the IBF welterweight world title in Las Vegas. Before that match people wondered if moving up in weight to face someone faster would be too much for his talent.\n\n“Timing beats speed,” Mayweather told me during a Beverly Hills press conference for that fight.\n\nMayweather defeated Judah and would then ease past fellow welterweight titlist Carlos Baldomir and then defeat Oscar De La Hoya by split decision. From that point on he was “the man.”\n\nMayweather retired in 2017 after defeating Conor McGregor in Las Vegas. He was later voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2021.\n\n“I ask parents to bring their children to come watch the greatest fighter that ever lived to perform here once and only once in Mexico City,” said promoter Richard Schaefer.\n\nBut all those wins came when he was in his peak. He’s almost 50 now. Despite this being an exhibition, any blow could be the one to end a career tragically like a trapeze artist without a net.\n\nIt’s dangerous.\n\nOther Bouts\n\nA tantalizing super bantamweight clash between Picasso and Hovhannisyan could be interesting. The Armenian fighter has never been in a boring fight and last year his contest against Luis Nery was one of the top fights in 2023. Expect another great fight.\n\nAlso on the undercard will be Curmel Moton who is promoted by Mayweather. He’s been the talk of Las Vegas with his speed and power. Moton (4-0, 3 KOs) meets Mexico’s Victor Vazquez (5-2-1) in a lightweight fight.\n\nAll total about a dozen bouts are scheduled including another exhibition fight between former world champion Victor “Vicious” Ortiz and Rodrigo Damian Coria.\n\nFights to Watch\n\nSat. DAZN ppv 4:30 p.m. David Picasso (28-0-1) vs Azat Hovhannisyan (21-4); Floyd Mayweather vs John Gotti III (exhibition).\n\nTo comment on this story in the Fight Forum CLiCK HERE\n\nPost Views: 0"
