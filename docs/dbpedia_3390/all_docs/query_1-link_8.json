        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. Seven months before Lily and Marshall got back together, the latter had told his family through the phone about the cancellation of their wedding after their breakup. Complete the lines in the phone conversation. \"What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that?! What do you call that?! I think that's a little strong! I... I can't believe you used a word like that! Geez, ____________!\"\n\nAnswer: Grandma\n\nDespite her presumed being elderly, Marshall's grandmother (unseen throughout the series) had to dispose a halfway delinquent behavior, at least through phone calls. This phenomenon recurred when Marshall lost his password to open an account to his bar exam results and received phone calls from his fellow examinees and his grandmother, who claimed that her nurses \"are stealing [her] medicine\" (although they were supposedly misplaced).\n\n\"It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?\"\n\n2. Robin said this in her program at Metro News One. \"Coming up at eleven, are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know could 'eat' you.\" The last sentence is a paronomasia or \"pun\" to what known idiom?\n\nAnswer: \"What you don't know could hurt you.\"\n\nThroughout the series, Robin has found disgust, saying the lines given by the teleprompter, in a certain news program. This was not the case in this episode.\n\n\"Mike, you can read, right?\" \"Yeah, I'm the best at reading.\"\n\n3. Barney spoke this line, meeting his gang mates while on a pedicure. \"If there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure, I don't think there would have been a feature about it in 'Details' magazine.\" Is there such thing as \"Details\" as a magazine?\n\nAnswer: Yes\n\n\"Details\" is a men's lifestyle magazine in the United States, the company of which was bought by Condé Nast in 1988. As the management of \"Details\" was transferred to a sister company under Condé Nast, it encountered revamps on its design and lay-out.\n\n\"Oh! Congratulations, Lily! Marshall, you're getting married?!\"\n\n4. Lily: \"I guess I'll have my pick of something old.\" Marshall: \"And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.\" What were Lily and Marshall talking about \"something old\" and \"something blue\"?\n\nAnswer: bridal articles for good luck\n\nThe expressions \"something old\", \"something new\", \"something borrowed\" and \"something blue\" to refer to the articles that a bride wears for good luck were derived from a traditional English rhyme. The same expressions were utilized as titles to four of the episodes in the series to recount the weddings of Lily and Marshall (Season 2), and Barney and Robin (Season 9).\n\n\"Ah, A.C. Always in decline, never hitting bottom... It's good to be back, old friend.\"\n\n5. Complete the following dialogue of Ted. \"So, this is it, right?! Last _______ minutes of your single life... I'm proud of you, buddy!\"\n\nAnswer: twenty\n\nLily allowed the boys 20 minutes to find the veil for her wedding with Marshall while she finds the bouquet. Barney took the task to find it, letting Marshall and Ted to gamble for a while. Ted, then, questioned Marshall whether he is nervous about his wedding to come after twenty minutes.\n\n\"Craps?\" \"Not that nervous...\" \"No, I mean, do you want to play craps?\" \"Oh, yeah... Definitely!\"\n\n6. How long did this conversation take before Barney, Marshall and Ted immediately proceed to a strip club, based, at least, on the overall dialogue for the episode? Barney: \"Alright, let's talk bachelor party! Are we thinking full-on strip club or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?\" Ted: \"What did you just say?\" Marshall: \"Barney, no...\" Barney: \"Marshall, I'm your best man.\" Marshall: \"You're not my best man.\" Ted: \"Right here...\" Barney: \"And, as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend!\" Marshall: \"You're not my best friend!\" Ted: \"Right here...\"\n\nAnswer: two minutes\n\nThe 20-minute countdown had already started as the boys are about to find the veil. As watched in TV, it took moments before Barney reunited with Marshall and Ted to say that he found a veil for the former's wedding with Lily. The lines of Marshall succeeding the given dialogue said like this--\"Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.\"\n\n\"18 minutes?\"\n\n7. How did Barney react when Marshall blurted out to Lily that he had spent eighteen minutes finding the veil with Barney and Ted and, not supposedly, had \"[gone] to a strip club\"?\n\nAnswer: \"Unbelievable!\"\n\nWhile Marshall knew the guys had minimal time--only 18 minutes--to stage a bachelor party before his wedding Lily, Ted thought twice. This scene cuts to the entrance hall to the chapel, into where the guys run to bring the veil to Lily. Marshall blew the cover, saying that they were in a strip club for these 18 minutes, much to Ted and Barney's surprise.\n\n\"We went to a strip club.\" \"Dude!\" \"Unbelievable!\"\n\n8. At each time the receptionist (Patricia Belcher) quoted the numbers \"35\" and \"27\", Barney secretly looks onto a card. What was Barney doing?\n\nAnswer: playing keno\n\nAs the receptionist announced that she could not allow Lily and Marshall for a wedding in Atlantic City as they lack a marriage license, Barney joined in to play keno, only failing to search for the numbers the receptionist exclaimed--\"35\" and \"27\".\n\n\"Bright side--the bachelor party continues!\" \"Yes! 'Continues'? You mean 'starts'. He means 'starts'. We went to a strip club.\"\n\n9. What words should fill in the spaces on the receptionist's line, suggesting about where Lily and Marshall should go to have a marriage license. \"You could go to the ___________. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be ___________, but you have to have a good reason.\"\n\nAnswer: courthouse, waived\n\nAs Lily and Marshall could not have their ad hoc wedding in the casino chapel without a marriage license, the receptionist advised them to go to a courthouse to apply for a license without suffering a 3-day grace period. She said that she heard about one couple who applied to get married very early, knowing that the groom is expected to go \"to Iraq tomorrow to defend [his] country\".\n\n\"The last one I heard was 'I'm going to Iraq to tomorrow defend my country' but, you know, give yours a whirl.\"\n\n10. Did Lily respond \"Really?\" to the registrar (Kate Micucci) as they were joked on an appearance in \"Candid Camera\"?\n\nAnswer: No\n\nThe registrar joked in the process, as Lily and Marshall inquired to apply for a marriage license without enduring the waiting period. She gives positive responses, at first, but shifts to saying that she would say so whenever such is possible but is impossible in reality. Robin reacted when the registrar said that they were filmed for the comedy program \"Candid Camera\".\n\n\"Why are you doing this to us?!\" \"'Cause you're on 'Candid Camera'!\" \"Really?\" \"Is what I would say--\" \"You know what? We get it.\"\n\n11. For what event did this dialogue transpire (characters not mentioned)? \"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds!\" \"Vultures!\"\n\nAnswer: their seats being taken by elderly people\n\nThis scene illustrated an illusion of the gang having gone to a very old age, waiting for a judge to attend to Lily and Marshall's marriage. In actuality, the gang had only gone to a vending machine to buy snacks and returned to see old people occupying the seats.\n\n\"You throwing a big free party with lots of booze and food, and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet...\"\n\n12. Name characters A, B and C, who said the following dialogue. A: \"Baby, any place we go, we're going to need a marriage license.\" B: \"Except international waters... So... so, let's a find a ship captain! A ship captain can marry us! There's boats [sic] all over this place!\" C: \"Oh, is that what those wooden thing are floating between the garbage?\"\n\nAnswer: Marshall (A), Lily (B), Ted (C)\n\nAfter failing to get a marriage license from a courthouse in Atlantic City, the gang went back to the casino, where Lily thought of having the marriage with Marshall via a ship captain's administration. A marriage outside New Jersey's mainland boundaries, according to her, would waive them from applying for one.\n\n\"Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?\" \"This is my machine!\"\n\n13. Complete these lines from the ship captain (Todd Stashwick). \"I sure can. There's [sic] two things I love. It's bringing people together in marriage and making __________ dollars.\"\n\nAnswer: 5,000\n\nThe first to be seen by the guys in the search for a ship captain to administer Lily and Marshall's wedding, he gave his interest to do so in exchange of 5,000 dollars. The costliness of the wedding is much to Marshall's surprise yet Lily is undaunted to pay it.\n\n\"I swear it. Nay, I 'oath' it!\"\n\n14. While Barney was playing Xing Haishi Bu Xing to win money to pay for the ship captain, Robin asked Ted whether he knows at that time if he's winning the game. What was Ted's response?\n\nAnswer: \"I don't even know if he's playing.\"\n\nXing Haishi Bu Xing, a complicated gambling game, turns out to be a Chinese version of Deal or No Deal, since an attractive lady is involved, presumed to carry the prize to win, an orange jellybean. Barney, with momentary help from Marshall (a master in parlor games), succeeded. The same game took a reprise in \"The Bro Mitzvah\" (S8E22), where Barney lost $80,000 after achieving a black jellybean.\n\n\"Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But, luckily, Barney did.\"\n\n15. Fill in the void within the ship captain's pronouncement of Lily and Marshall's impromptu marriage. \"We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will _____________, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...\"\n\nAnswer: become one\n\nThe above-water marriage would have become official but Lily and Marshall had to call it off, realizing about introducing themselves to each other's families despite the possibility of any disgust associated with Lily's San Francisco art workshop attendance that caused the breakup. However, the ship captain pronounced them as newlyweds; the marriage then ended after 12 seconds.\n\n\"Is Robin here?\" \"Man, I hope so.\"\n\nSource: Author lacourzan95\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor ladymacb29 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
