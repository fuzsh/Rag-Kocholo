It's \"A Very Brady Murder: A Murdery Parody.\"\n\nIn the name of Alice the housekeeper, what's going on here?\n\nResorts is hosting what it's calling an interactive event. Audience members will participate and help solve this Brady Bunch Crime.\n\nThe crime, we understand, does not involve the curse of the ancient tiki idol - which was in play when the Brady Bunch TV show went to Hawaii.\n\nMeet the cast\n\nPeople attending the performance are promised a good time:\n\n\"There will be several opportunities to take selfies with the characters (and a fun race to see who can get them all first), hidden clues, and even an opportunity to get your mug shot. Once the performance begins, you will become part of the action as you play detective and try to solve the mystery.\n\nListen closely, gather the clues, and try to deduce who the killer is and win the prize!\"\n\nWhile the cast is not named, we're assuming none of the cast from the original TV series (or the movie made years later) is involved.\n\nSo, load the kids into the station wagon and let us know how it goes!\n\nFor tickets and more information, click here.\n\n\"Here's a story, of a lovely lady....\""
