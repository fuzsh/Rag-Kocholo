        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. How many days did it take Marshall to get over his breakup with Lily?\n\nAnswer: 67\n\nAfter his breakup with Lily, Marshall moped around his apartment feeling horribly depressed for 67 days before finally getting up to make a batch of pancakes, which, according to Ted, were disgusting.\n\n2. In \"Swarley\", Robin subscribes Barney to the Spanish version of a magazine, using the name \"Swarlos\". Which magazine is it?\n\nAnswer: People\n\nThroughout the entire episode, the gang calls Barney by the name \"Swarley\" because Chloe, the girl from the coffee house whom Marshall dates, mistakenly wrote \"Swarley\" instead of \"Barney\" on his cup of coffee. Chloe also called Robin \"Roland\", but Barney didn't succeed in making this name catch on.\n\n3. For how much money did Ted sell the 1939 penny that he found in the subway?\n\nAnswer: $1.50\n\nWith the money he made, he bought Robin and himself two hot-dogs, which he claims to have paid only $1.49, leaving him with another penny (which means that he made 1,50$ by selling his old penny). He also said that he sold the penny for 150 times its original value. Unfortunately, the other penny he was left with after having bought the hot-dogs was only a 1986 penny.\n\n4. What kind of food did Lily and Robin spill in Marshall's Fiero?\n\nAnswer: Thai\n\nLily panics because she knows Marshall is very serious about two things: his rule of \"no food or drinks in the Fiero\" and \"the difference between affect and effect\". Because they don't want Marshall to find out that they had food in the car, Robin and her make up a cover story involving a homeless man breaking a window and throwing up in the car.\n\n5. By the end of the season, how many of the slaps that Marshall won in \"Slap Bet\" has he given Barney?\n\nAnswer: 2\n\nHe gave his first slap at the end of \"Slap bet\", while the gang are watching the \"Robin Sparkles\" video and he gives the other one in \"Stuff\", to give an end to Barney's terrible play, entitled \"Suck it Lily\".\n\n6. Where does Marshall first invite his friend Brad in \"World's Greatest Couple\"?\n\nAnswer: To an Alanis Morissette Concert\n\nMarshall first invites Brad to an Alanis Morissette concert because he had bought two tickets for him and Lily, but they were broken up. Seeing he has had a lot of fun with his new friend, he then invites him to brunch. It is Brad who invites Marshall to the musical and to the wedding.\n\n7. Which of these isn't done by Robin to keep from knowing the score of the Super Bowl game that aired the previous night in \"Monday Night Football\"?\n\nAnswer: She leaves the studio\n\nIn the end, she finds out who won because a fellow reporter says that a newborn panda at the Bronx Zoo was named in honor of the previous night's Superbowl winning team.\n\n8. How old was Barney when he lost his virginity?\n\nAnswer: 23\n\nThroughout the episode, Barney lies about how he lost his virginity by describing famous scenes from various movies. He finally tells everyone the truth at the very end of the episode, feeling slightly embarrassed.\n\n9. Which part of Marshall's body is Lily unable to resist?\n\nAnswer: His calves\n\nIn the episode \"Brunch\", Marshall tries to seduce Lily by showing her his calves, which he knows she can't resist. He does this to get back at her, because the previous night, she used her breasts to do the same thing.\n\n10. What is Ted's middle name?\n\nAnswer: Evelyn\n\nIn \"How Lily Stole Christmas\", Lily calls Ted's mother because he called her a \"grinch\", and she claims that if one of her kindergarten students had said such a word, this is what she would have done. Infuriated, Ted's mother calls him back, saying \"Ted Evelyn Mosby!\"\n\nSource: Author strilenca\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor Gamemaster1967 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
