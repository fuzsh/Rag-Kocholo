        "text": "Photo Gallery\n\nUniversity of Richmond- Former track & field and cross country coach Bill Jordan, who graduated from the University of Richmond in 1953, was honored by his former athletes on Nov. 4 with a plaque naming the Head Women's Coaches office after him. Current women's coach Lori Taylor's office in the Robins Center has a commemorative plaque on display honoring Jordan.\n\nThe reception was led by Gerri Leder (class of 1978) who was a member of the first women's varsity track & field team which was established by Jordan in 1976. He is credited with being a main force, along with Fred Hardy, behind the success of the track & field and cross country programs at the University from his time as an athlete (1948-1953) throughout his coaching career which spanned nearly 40 years.\n\n\"Bill Jordan is a remarkable man that took a group of young women and provided us with an opportunity to compete as a varsity sport,\" Leder said. \"We are grateful for his efforts.\"\n\nA near capacity crowd gathered in the Robins Center Hall of Fame Room to recognize his accomplishments and to hear stories from the past.\n\n\"Every once in a while during your lifetime you have a rare opportunity to meet a great person, someone who makes everyone's day brighter and better. Bill Jordan is such a man,\" current Richmond head men's coach Steve Taylor said. \"We appreciate his help and willingness to give back to the sport of track & field and the University of Richmond. Our entire University community cannot thank him enough.\"\n\nNot only did Bill Jordan help establish one of the premier track & field programs in the NCAA and the first varsity women's team during his tenure, he was also a top athlete while attending Richmond. He was part of the \"Lumpkin's Lopers\", a group of cross country members that hold the only undefeated cross country season in University history. In 1949, as an athlete Bill Jordan led coach William Lumkin's team consisting of Jimmy Sease (UR '50), Sam White (UR '51), Dick White (UR '53), Jack O'Brien (UR '53) and Bill Winn to an undefeated season.\n\nAs a coach he worked for 19 years directly with Hall of Fame coach Fred Hardy. Under their guidance the Richmond program grew to one of the premier programs in the NCAA. During their tenure 10 National Champions were crowned, 65 All-Americans were honored, and three Olympians were guided.\n\n\"The success of any program seldom hinges on one person,\" current women's head coach Lori Taylor's said. \"Typically it's the efforts of multiple people. The success and storied history here at Richmond is no different. I believe the vision, honesty, wisdom and unselfish decisions coach Jordan made are a true testament to his character. He is highly respected and we are honored to call him our friend.\n\nAlong with Gerri Leder's remarks Russell C. Smelley (UR '78) sent the following letter to be read:\n\nNovember 2, 2005\n\nIn Honor of Mr. E.W. Bill Jordan\n\nThere are singular people we encounter in our life's walk who have a dynamic effect upon our lives. Often we do not recognize the impact for quite some time because such people do what they do quietly, without fanfare, and without concern for recognition. Such a person has graced the University of Richmond for more than 50 years as a teacher, coach, concerned alumni, parent of an alumna, athlete, athletics supporter and humble observer. Bill Jordan has lived a singular life of service to family, students, and the University. A commitment to excellence and an ethic of hard work have been additional character traits which have set him apart.\n\nBill Jordan's qualities become more obvious with the time spent getting to know him. He is a gentleman, born of Virginia traditions, and steeped in commitment to doing things well. He is a quiet observer who notes details of what is happening around him. He is not driven by ego but more in doing what is right and doing what needs to be done. He is not concerned with receiving credit for his work. He is simply willing to help where he is needed. He is a man of true humility, with a delightful sense of humor and a clear sense of self. The quiet observer can speak most incisively when asked but declines to speak with rancor or unkindness.\n\nBill Jordan influenced my life by always encouraging me that I could do better. Maybe not in direct words, but in a story or an incisive observation. The story could take a long time to tell but the incisive observation could cut to the bone, even as it was accompanied by a hearty and supportive laugh. The ability to tell a long story is a trait that sets Coach Jordan apart from most others. To talk with him is to make a commitment of time. Over the years, I realize more than ever, that it is time well spent.\n\nThirty two years ago, the spring 1973, Bill Jordan was the first University person to spend any time walking and talking with me. It has been my pleasure to return to his office and his home to be taught, mentored and cajoled ever since. There is no person I hold in higher esteem for his character and life's example than Coach Jordan. Coach Hardy always said about himself that he was the world's greatest track coach and I give him his due. But, right behind him walked the world's greatest life coach, Bill Jordan, and I express my gratitude and thanks to him for setting me, and many others, on a road to a better way of living life.\n\nCoach Jordan, you have earned this humble recognition of a simple plaque on the wall. The meaning of the honor will never be easily recognized by the passing observer. Yet, your name should be tied to the cross country and Track & Field program for prosperity because time has proven the worth and wisdom of your contributions.\n\nGratefully submitted,\n\nRussell C. Smelley Class of 1978"
