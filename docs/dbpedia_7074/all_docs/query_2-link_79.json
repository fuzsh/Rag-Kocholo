        "text": "William E. “Bill” Richmond passed away at his home on Jan. 1, 2022, at the age of 88 after a short bout with cancer.\n\nHe was born July 21, 1933, at Crawfordsville, the son of Robert and Esther Richmond. He was a 1951 graduate of Crawfordsville High School and still enjoyed meeting monthly with his fellow classmates.\n\nBill served as part of the Army 5th Infantry Division (The Big Red) stationed in Germany during the Korean War from 1954-1956. After returning home he attended Purdue University earning his degree in agriculture in 1960. Shortly thereafter he returned to Purdue and earned his teaching degree. He also received his master’s degree in biology from Michigan State University.\n\nOn June 15, 1957, he married his wife of 64 years, Linda Updike. They had five children, Kathy Mola of Dayton, Ohio, Lisa (Bob) Kaeser of Lafayette, Leigh Ann (Pat) Vacendak of Crawfordsville, Kent (Kristie) Richmond of Crawfordsville and Monica (Greg) Winer of Elgin, Illinois. Bill and Linda have 11 grandchildren, four great grandchildren, two nephews and three nieces.\n\nBill taught biology at Crawfordsville High School for 38 years and was the first swim coach for CHS. He also managed the city pool for many years. After coaching he became an official for IHSAA swimming and diving.\n\nAfter his retirement he received his Master Gardener certification from Purdue and also became a beekeeper. He did not know an idle moment. He loved working with his bees, on his farm and with his chickens and horses. He was known for his large gardens and his very extensive Christmas light displays for which he won many awards.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and his sisters, Katherine and Mary.\n\nVisitation will be held 4-8 p.m. Monday, Jan. 17. Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. Tuesday, Jan. 18, with visitation one hour before service. Both will be held at Burkhart Funeral Home, 201 W. Wabash Ave., Crawfordsville. The family requests that masks be worn for both indoor events. Burial will be immediately following service at Oak Hill Cemetery.\n\nDonations may be made to St. Jude Children’s Hospital, http://giftfunds.stjude.org/Bill_Richmond or mail to: ALSAC/St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place Memphis, TN 38105 “In memory of Bill Richmond.”"
