David Richman Ferry News Article Samuel's Death Richman Land\n\nBack to Menu\n\nRICHMAN/RICHMOND FAMILY The Richman/Richmond family has been difficult to trace allowing that the early generations used very few middle names, and named their children after each other repeatedly. Also, the wives of many of the Richmond men had the same given name. To make the task even more difficult the boundaries of the counties were constantly being changed as new counties were formed, and the records are sparse. Add to this the apparent constant relocation of these pioneers for better farming land so that our progenitor, William Richmond, lived in at least seven counties in Virginia and what is now West Virginia, namely: Botetourt, Greenbrier, Monroe, Giles, Logan, Fayette, and Raleigh counties. Even the state was changed from Virginia to West Virginia, so that both states had to be searched for records.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nWILLIAM RICHMOND William Richmond was the first known Richmond to settle in the Greenbrier area. According to the statement made by him in his Revolutionary War pension application he was born in Pennsylvania in 1752. There being many Richmonds in Penn. I have thus far been unable to connect him to any of them.\n\nHe was granted 180 acres of land in Greenbrier Co. on 6 Sept., 1787, the land lying and being on the south side of Swoobe's Knobbs adjoining the land of William Craig and David Dick. This land was later in Monroe Co. He was granted 180 acres at Swoob's Knob in 1793; the land was surveyed in 1798, and 100 acres at Swoob's Knob in 1794. On 27 June, 1797 William Richmond and Mary --, his first wife, sold 180 acres adjoining William Craig and David Dick plus 100 acres adjoining William McKinster and John Burdette for $5.00.\n\nHe is listed in the Giles Co., VA census of 1810 & 1820 and in Logan Co. (W)VA in 1830 he was living with Shadrick Martin, a grandson, son of Lydia Richmond, his daughter, who married Gideon Martin. He is in Fayette Co. 1840 census, and died near Sandstone, about January, 1850 aged 98. On 13 Feb., 1850 his children sold land to Thomas Bragg in Fayette Co., and the deed mentions that William is deceased. His land pension pay of $40 was given to him Sept. 20, 1849. He went to Lewisburg and appeared before the clerk of the court along with Nancy & Polly Bragg who witnessed his future request to have an attorney collect his pay.\n\nSeveral areas of the Greenbrier, Fayette, Raleigh, Summers part of West Virginia have been named for members of the Richmond family. Richmond Falls, now known as New River Falls, was named for William Richmond. Sandstone was formerly called New Richmond, and there is a Richmond District where many Richmond families of the 1880 Census record lived.\n\nWilliam Richmond was married three times, all children apparently being born to the first wife, Mary. He married 18 Feb. 1809 Margaret Bragg, and third Rebecca Adkins.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nREVOLUNTIONARY WAR RECORD State of Virginia, Greenbrier County\n\nOn this 22nd day of Occtober 1832 personally appeared before the County Court of Greenbrier it being a court of record William Richmond Senr. a resident of Fayette County and state of Virginia Aged 80 years who being first duly sworn according to law doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the provisions made by the Act of Congress pased June 7th, 1832.

RICHMAN John A. Richman, the eldest son of William Richmond, was born in 1779 and married (1) 10 Nov. 1795 in Greenbrier County, Jane McCoy, daughter of James & Jane McCoy. They had no children. He married (2) 12 July 1803 in Greenbrier, Susan Kaylor (spelled Chaler in record), daughter of Mathias and Katherine Kaylor. John and Susan sold land in 1826 and moved to Illinois where they became the first white settlers in what is now known as Douglas County.\n\nThe trip was started from New River Falls, WV, bringing with him his oxen, household goods, and one covered wagon. They crossed the river and then went down the stream on ferry boats. The boats were pushed along with staves; holding back half the time, as the stream was so swift and so narrow in places that it was too dangerous to really travel. The trip was made all the way like that down the stream to New River, into the Kanawah Falls, and then on down to the Ohio River, and thence into the Wabash River and here they took to land with their family and stock, eventually settling at the head of the Vermilion river where they remained for about 2 years.\n\nMr. Richman, in company with Moses Bradshaw, came down toward what is now Camargo, on a hunting trip. He was a great hunter and lover of honey. The two explored the woods in the vicinity where they were gratified by finding a large number of \"bee trees\". In their ten days' trip they gathered two or three barrels of wild honey. Being so well pleased on this trip, he resolved to remove his family from Vermilion County which was within a few days travel. He settled 1/2 miles west of the village of Camargo on Monday, May 5th, 1828.\n\nSE 1/4 NE 1/4 Sec 33 Twp 16N R 9E\n\nAt that time there was not another family of whites living in that vicinity. Only Indians were his neighbors for 18 months although within that time Isaac Moses settled 1 mile east of Camargo. The Indians remained in the area about 3 years assisting the new settlers in plowing up a few acres of ground for corn.\n\nIn the latter part of July, he began the erection of a log cabin, however several of the children became ill and as a result he was not able to finish the project until the summer of 1829. Unfortunately, the cabin was torn down in 1885.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nRECOLLECTIONS OF JOHN RICHMAN *** The following is excerpted from the \"Transactions of the Illinois State Historical Society\" for 1907, as furnished by Mrs. Anna Rutherford, of Oakland, IL, from a manuscript of her father's, Dr. H. Rutherford, containing some recollections of John Richman. ***\n\nIn February of 1841 a settler on Brush Creek, 3 miles southeast of Oakland, had a sale. A man in one of the groups of people attending looked up the road and enquired, \"Who's that?\" No one knew the strange looking person approaching except Captain Bagley who replied,\"That's old John Richman\". Mr. Richman was at that time a man of some 60 plus years of age, 6 feet tall, strongly built and in vigorous health. He carried a long rifle, a deer gun, with a leather guard over the lock. His rig and costume were unique and picturesque even for that day. He wore a knitted woolen cap of white, red and green bands, with a white tassel on the top. His hunting shirt was of walnut jeans fringed along the seams and skirts, and around the neck and cape. His pants, of the same material, were held up by a draw string and secured at the ankles by deer leather leggins, bound by cross thongs fastened to his moccasins. He wore a leather belt in which was stuck a small tomahawk. To his shoulder strap was attached a pouch, a powder horn and a small butcher knife in a sheath. His moccasins had sole leather bottoms fastened by thongs. He was clean shaved, and his shirt and clothing bright and clean.\n\nAfter greeting, he stated that one of his pet deer had escaped about three weeks ago. He had expected it to return, but instead found it had gone down into the timber. He was sure it would come back in a month, but fearing somebody might shoot the animal, he had started out to find it and bring it back. He had stayed the previous night with his friend, Andrew Gwinn, and hearing of the sale, he had come by hoping someone might have seen the deer. It was described as a doe with a red flannel band on its neck and a small brass bell held by a leather strap. He added, \"If I could only hear one tinkle of that bell, I'd know it.\" No one had seen or heard of it, but all assured him that nobody would kill it, knowing from the band that it was a pet. Someone suggested that perhaps the deer had continued down the river and by now might be in Jasper County. Richman shook his head with a decisive \"No! She will not go more than two miles below here.\" He gave no reason for the opinion, but he no doubt knew what the others did not know, that the range limit for the deer was twenty miles from the place of birth. Someone inquired, \"How will you find that deer among the brush, the thickets and the long grass?\" Holding up a turkey call bone he said, \"Every day when I brought her feed, I called her up with that bone; if ever she hears it again she will know it and come to me. She will know me, too, and let me lead her home. If she is alive I will find her and find her down there\", pointing to the southwest. Shouldering his gun, he went on his way.\n\nIt subsequently transpired that he made his way to the neighborhood of St. Omar, two miles north of Ashmore. Here, he decided, was the deer's boundary limits. He stayed two days roaming over the barrens and river bluffs, sounding his call bone as he went, but no doe ever came to him. He became convinced that someone had killed it, and the wretch who had done it lived near by. In his anger he told several people what he thought and that if he ever found out who did it, he would put a bullet through him if it was seven years afterwards. He made and repeated his declaration in the house of David Golliday, Sr., unaware of the fact that at that time the band and bell of his doe was then hidden within a few feet of him. A few days previous one of the Golliday boys had brought in the dead body of the doe, with the red band and bell on it; knowing how mean and dirty the act was, the family kept it secret. The old man's threats terrified them so much that the bell was kept in hiding for several years, till it was known that the ferocious old hunter was dead.\n\nIn the summer of 1842 I (Dr. Rutherford) happened to pass by the house of Mr. Richman. His son David and his young wife were living there. The old man, being a widower, lived with them. I was called in to minister to a sick child. The house was a rudely constructed affair. It had a puncheon floor, an outside stick chimney, and the house corners were untrimmed. It stood by the calamus patch in the fair grounds. Mr. Richman, the elder, at that time, was particularly busy. As was his habit, he sat upon the floor with a deer skin under him, tanned with the hair on, and the neck, tail and legs clipped off. In his hand he held a piece of chair rung, to the end of which was attached a piece of sole leather, forming a convenient paddle. With this deadly weapon he slaughtered every fly he could reach adding at each successful blow a suitable curse adjective. A pair of short boards, leaning together at the top and smeared with honey, stood on a shelf as a fly trap. Every few minutes he would rise from the floor and bring the trap together with a bang, supplemented with a furious, \"There, damn ye!\" by way of comment. This is the opposite of romance, Fennimore Cooper never degraded his hunters and warriors to such small game; but all the same, such is life, such is reality. It was said of Mr. Richman that he would sit for hours at a time by his bee hives killing drones. In the course of his fly campaign he sat down and rose up many times; and what is singular, he did it with ease and grace, such as long practice alone can give. I had seen him once before sit for hours on that deer skin, and what is more, had seen him sleep on it too, his head and shoulders lightly leaning against a table.\n\nOne day in November, '44, Mr. Richman appeared at my home, telling me he had a job for me. Stripping up his sleeve, he exhibited a wen (a cyst) on his upper arm, as large as a turkey egg. He said he had tried two faith doctors on it, but did no good, adding, \"The sign wasn't right or sumthin'. Could I cut it out for him?\" To my inquiry as to when he wished it removed, he said in his decided way, \"It must be done today or tomorrow, because the sign today is in the legs, and tomorrow it'll be in the feet. After that it'll be in the head again, and you know it wouldn't do then at all; it'ud be dangerous.\" The wen therefore was removed at once. As the wound bled slightly he became uneasy, remarking that he had the power to \"stop blood\" on other people but could not on himself. He could \"learn a woman\", however, to do it, and if I would permit my wife to go into the back yard with him, he would learn her to stop the flow. Nodding assent, they retired, it would ruin the charm for me to see or hear the process, and he had her place her fingers over the wound, repeating after him a pow-wow formula commanding the flow to stop in the name of God and his holy angels. As there was no apparent result and he seemed anxious, I did what I should have done at first, put on another and tighter bandage. But Mr. Richman was satisfied, nevertheless, that the \"words\" had done the business.\n\nHe stayed with me two days and told me a hundred of his hunting, mining and ghost stories. Brim full of superstitions, he was what the scriptures call a \"natural man.\" Without moral or religious training, he did not know one letter from another, and to him the reading of a printed page was a mystery. His youth and manhood had been spent in the mountains of Virginia, living a wild and savage life. He told me he had never worn a shoe or a boot nor ever had an overcoat on his back. Roaming over the country in search of game, in those days when the prairie was a wilderness and the settler was found only at distant points of timber, it was his habit when night was coming down, to make his way to the nearest cabin in sight, sans ceremoni, withouth a knock, he lifted the latch, walked in and made himself at home. To the lonely settler he was always a welcome guest, a God-send in fact. In his dialectic vernacular he repeated to his eager listeners his old time adventures, a light sleeper, he literally \"sat by the fire and talked the night away.\"\n\nFrom the late Andrew Gwinn I learned that his father was a woodsman by profession, what the French term a courier de bois. John was the eldest son and had the good fortune to marry a woman of exceptional wisdom and patience. It was said of her that no other woman could control his passionate fits. They were energetic, industrious and prosperous. Deciding to live in the Wabash country, they spent a year in preparation. Two great poplar trees, made two large canoes. These dugouts were launched on New River, placed catamaran fashion, a deck was built over them, and pitching his tent on top, with his family inside, the craft floated down the river. Down the Kanawah, down the Ohio to the mouth of the Wabash. In the low water of summer he and his sons pushed that flotilla up stream, day after day, till they reached Eugene. They stayed here a couple of years, as I have understood, living in the tent, and in the spring of 1829, moved to the Ambraw. Mr. Richman has ever since carried the distinction of being the first settler in Douglas County.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nSAMUEL RICHMOND Samuel Richmond was the youngest son of William, born March 1, 1801 and died September 12, 1863, leaving a family of eight sons and five daughters. He was a Union man, and opposed to the severance of the Union and the secession of Southern States. With the Richmond characteristics, he left no doubt in the minds of the people as to his beliefs, but proclaimed them far and wide. Being over the age at which he could be required to serve in either of the armies, he remained at home, owning a large burrh hewed log grist-mill, located at the lower side of the falls, which was patronized for many miles around, as it ran all the year, and the people on both sides of the river were enabled to have their grinding done at this mill when the water had dried up during the summer and fall months, and the other mills were out of commission by reason of the low water and dry weather.\n\nThe feeling was intense, and a great deal of bitterness had been engendered between the partisans of the Southern and Northern cause preceding and during the four years of the Civil War. Samuel Richmond, on the day of his death, ferried Allen Vincent across New River, from the Raleigh side. His wife insisted on his not crossing, fearful that some harm would result, but he disregarded her warning, went down to the ferry, some half mile below the residence, got into his canoe, ferried Mr. Vincent across to the Summers County side, who landed, and as Mr. Richmond started to row back, he was shot at from ambush by two persons who were hid on the mountain side, the ball passing through Mr. Richmond's lungs. Being, however, a man of powerful determination and physique, he rowed his canoe back to the opposite side, where he was carried home and there he died. The death of Mr. Richmond has been supposed to have been caused by Henderson Garten and Jefferson Bennett, a warm secession advocate.\n\nAccording to the HISTORY OF SUMMERS COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA, there were but two voters in favor of secession, who voted for that ordinance on Lick Creek, when voted on by the State of Virginia, in what is now Green Sulpher District. They were \"Sprightly John\" Richmond and Jefferson Bennett. John Richmond with pride, said he was the first man in Virginia who favored \"succeedin' outen the Union\".\n\nSixty acres of land, including the old Samuel Richmond mansion house, which was a large, two-story, hewed log house, and the old grist-mill, was sold in 1871 by Allen Richmond, Alexander H. \"Tuck\" Richmond, and the widow of Samuel Richmond, to W.R. Taylor, a Philadelphia capitalist. He paid the sum of $15,000 in gold, but never utilized the water-power or the property in any way, and permitted the buildings to decay and fall into ruins.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nJOHN A. RICHMOND (son of Samuel) Samuel Richmond and his descendants were all Republicans in politics, people of strong personality, and frequently voted against their party candidates they deemed better qualified to administer the affairs of the county. This was especially true of John A. Richmond, son of Samuel.\n\nJohn A. Richmond lived all his life at the mouth of Lick Creek. He was a man of excellent natural sense and ability, and was a man of fine personal appearance. His opportunities for education were limited, but he was a successful business man throughout his career. He was one of the first postmasters appointed in that part of the country. He was appointed postmaster in April, 1856, by President Buchanan, the name of the post office at that time being Richmond Falls, afterwards changed to New Richmond in 1871. He retained the office of postmaster without change until his death in 1901. His widow succeeded him as postmistress.\n\nHis business included a general merchandise business, from 1870 until his death. He was a man of strong personality, very true to his friends, and for his enemies he had no use. He was noted for his frankness, and was without deceit. If he disliked a person, that person was sure to know it, and he desired no transactions with him. If he was friend, he was kind and considerate, although sometimes his manner was rough and uncouth to those he liked best. He adopted that method of showing his friendship.\n\nA famous fight occurred at New River on January 20, 1874 between John A. Richmond and Thomas Bragg a farmer residing on Hump Mountain. They apparently fell out over some trespassing hogs. They were two of the most powerful men, physically, in Summers County. After fighting for some time, Richmond got Bragg down and made him hollar \"enough.\" After the fight was over, as was the fashion in those days, they shook hands and made friends so ever afterwards.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nWILLIAM RICHMOND (son of Samuel) All of the Richmonds were noted for their powerful physical strength. William Richmond, another son of Samuel, was no exception. Evan Hinton, the \"Father of Summers County\", was also a man of great physical strength; Richmond being a large-boned, tall, sinewy man, while Hinton was short, active and muscular.\n\nBefore the war it was very fashionable for the young men of the country to have wrestling matches, which very frequently ended in fights, as a test of manhood. Some of the neighbors of these gentlemen desiring to see a contest of their strength, told Evan Hinton that \"Bill\" Richmond had stated that he \"could whip 'Jack' Hinton (Evan's father) and all of his boys,\" for the purpose of inciting a fight for the amusement of the neighborhood. Evan immediately wrote to Richmond what he had heard, telling him if it was true to meet him, with his friends, at the farm just opposite Tug Creek, across New River, on the Raleigh side, below Hinton, and he \"would show him whether he could whip 'Jack' Hinton and all of his boys.\" Richmond replied that he would be on hand.\n\nOn the day appointed Richmond was on the grounds bright and early with his friends, and Hinton was there with his friends. They had each other searched for dangerous weapons, and, none being found, they stripped for the fray. Richmond was more judicious than Hinton, having put on a rotten shirt, so that when Hinton grabed it his hold would break. It was about an equal show-down, sometimes one being down and the other on top, and so back and forth, until finally Richmond got Hinton down and got on top of him. Somehow Hinton got Richmond's finger in his mouth and biting it with all his power, the pain became so severe that Richmond could stand it no longer and cried \"Enough!\" The parties then separated and the fight ended.\n\nWhile Hinton was the victor, his punishment was possibly more severe than Richmond's as he became violently ill. After the fight was over the men shook hands, and there was no more of it from that day on, they being neighbors and friends until their deaths. This fight was celebrated throughout the country. Richmond was afterwards a Union soldier and Hinton a Confederate soldier. Richmond was known throughout the country as \"Devil Bill\" Richmond. He was afterwards a member of the Legislature from Raleigh County, Justice of the Peace, and high in the councils of the Republican party; while Evan Hinton became the sheriff.\n\nRichmond was arrested at one time by the Confederate bush-wackers or scouts, and was taken on horseback behind one of the soldiers. In traveling through the mountains after night astride the horse, holding on to the man in front who was holding the bridle, he took out his knife and cut the man's throat, slid off the horse and escaped. The man whose throat was cut did not, however, die from the wounds.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nJOHN \"UNCLE JACKIE\" RICHMAN John Richman, who for a number of years had the distinction of being the oldest resident of Douglas County, Illinois, lived near the place where his father, John A. Richman, had located a half century before. He was born in Greenbrier County, W.VA, and spent the first fifteen years of his life in Virginia, where at that time there were no public schools, and as a consequence he attended school but three months in his entire life, and never mastered his spelling book. When in his sixteenth year the family left Virginia, the father desiring to secure more land than he could obtain there, and came to Illinois. The live-stock could not be disposed of satisfactorily in the old home, so it was driven to the western destination, and Mr. Richman often stated that he spent his sixteenth birthday in Ohio, minding the cattle until the family came up.\n\nAt the age of twenty-three years John Richman had bought eighty acres of land south and west of Camargo, adjoining the town, and began farming on his own account. The following year he was married to Mary Clayton, a native of Crawford County, and she died on Christmas day, 1837, eighteen months after their marriage. On September 5, 1839, he was married to Nancy J. McDowell, also a native of Crawford County. He lived on the land he had bought until 1850, in September of which year he moved to the farm of 320 acres one and one-half miles northwest of Camargo, on which he spent the remainder of his life.\n\nMr. Richman was a Democrat of the old school, and voted first for General Jackson, in 1832. His life haa been spent in hard work, but up to the time of his death he was hale and hearty. His residence in the county had been for a longer period than that of any other person, and this entitled him to stand at the head of the pioneers of Douglas County. In the words of another old pioneer resident of the county, \"John Richman was an honest, hardworking man, who had few advantages in life, but was always true as steel.\"\n\nBack to Menu\n\nWILLIAM R. RICHMAN William R. Richman, formerly one of the most prominent and highly respected citizens of Camargo Township, Douglas County, Ill., was well known as one of the oldest residents of the county. We quote from an article which appeared in the \"Tuscola Review\" April 5, 1907: \"William R. Richman, one of Douglas County's earliest born, died on Tuesday night, April 3, 1907, at his home three miles west of Villa Grove, after an illness of only two days. His sudden death caused quite a surprise, as he was up and about only a few days before. Mr. Richman had the distinction of being one of the first children born in Douglas County and was a son of our first settler, Uncle Jackie Richman, who built the first log cabin in what is now Douglas County. He was born in 1842, fourteen years after the first house was built by his father on the banks of the Embarras River. Three years ago he sold his farm of 200 acres to the Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad and it is on this land that the new village of Villa Grove now stands. He owned, when he died, about 360 acres of fine land in this county, valued at about $60,000. During his life he was known to be an honorable, upright man, living in such a manner as to win the approval and respect of his neighbors and all who came in contact with him.\n\nThe farm owned by the late William R. Richman consisted of 318 acres of Section 8, Camargo Township, and since his death it has been divided among his heirs, although none of it has been sold outside the family. He was a member of the Christian Church, which he joined about one year prior to his death, and his widow adheres to the faith of the Methodist Episcopal denomination.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nDAVID RICHMAN The funeral services of David Richman, who passed away at his home, one and one-half miles sosthwest of Camargo, on Friday morning, January 14th, 1916, was held at the Christian church in Camargo, Sunday afternoon, January 16.\n\nDavid Richman was one of the family of study pioneers who first settled Douglas County and was the son of John Richman, better known to the elder generation as \"Uncle Jackie\", who came with his father and brothers, from Greenbrier county, Virginia, in the year 1829 and with the help of the Indians, built the first og house in Douglas county located on the present site of the Camargo fair grounds which only some few years ago was moved away.\n\nHe received his early education in the district and subscription schools by laboring at hard work during the summer months, to secure funds to pay his tuition. His religious affiliations were with the Methodist church of which he became a member in an old school house, located one mile west of Villa Grove, near the church, then called, the old brick church, and which was only within a short distance of his home at that time. In politics he was a strong Democrat.\n\nIn the year 1881 they with their family of eight children, moved from west of Villa Grove, to the farm where he passed away, east of the Patterson Springs and Chautauqua grounds in the log house built by Robert Patterson several years before and the house is supposed to be over forty-five years of age. Here at this home they have resided nearly 36 years. Although the log house is not as log houses were in the early days, as only a part of the residence is of primitive constructions, there having been additions made and the interior remodeled.\n\nOn May 15th, 1914, Mr. and Mrs. Richman celebrated their fifty-fifth wedding anniversary, together with their children and grandchildren and at the time of his death they had happily lived together for nearly 57 years.\n\nMr. Richman related many stories of hunting deer, wolves, and other wild games that once roamed these prairies. He has seen all the changes that have brought this country from a wilderness to the greatest farming paradise of the world.\n\nIn the year of 1859 on May 15th, he was united in marriage to Susan Fleming, daughter of John Fleming, of Bath county, KY. When married, Douglas county had just been formed and the county seat was then located temporarily at Camargo, the election that took it to Tuscola not yet having been held, consequently, they purchased the first marriage license in Douglas county issued at the court in Camargo. Squire W.T. Johnson, of Tuscola, was with Mr. Richman when he made the purchase of the license. They were married at the home of the late Alexander Bragg, west of Camargo, by Alfred Bauch, who was then justice of the peace.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nGoldenseal Magazine\n\nRESPECT THAT RIVER\n\nWilliam Richmond and the Richmond Ferry\n\nPhotographs and Text by Andy Yale In the summer of 1984, the huge steel bridge across the New River at Sandstone was complete, but the Interstate it had been built to service was stalled in the rough country near Dawson. Three shifts of men worked heavy equipment around the clock and the eerie glare of their vapor lights pushed back the night as they struggled to inch I-64 across the hills to the New River crossing. While they labored, the twin spans across the river remained untravelled, seeming in their temporary uselessness like monuments to some vanished empire, their white concrete pillars glowing in the gray river water.\n\nOn a Sunday evening that summer just about dusk, a man standing in the middle of the new bridge would be shrouded in quiet, with only the small words the river spoke to the wind to trouble him. Away to the west, the roadbed of the new Interstate stretched into the hills, the gray lines of gravel extending empty to the horizon. To the east, rows of heavy equipment sat silent, earthmovers and graders and huge Euclid dumps taking their rest after a six-day week. And in the quiet, the man could hear what those crossing the bridge at 65 miles per hour, bound for Beckley and Charleston and the smokey plains of Ohio will never get the chance to hear. In the peace of that summer evening, a faint \"hello\" echoed from up the river, and an answering shout, blurred by distance into a single, meaningless sound, floated back.\n\nIf he was born and bred in that vicinity, the listener would know the meaning of those shouts, and could travel in his imagination half a mile up the river, around the two big bends, to a point at the mouth of Laurel Creek, where a figure stood expectantly on the gravel shore. From the opposite bank, a boat put out, a heavy wooden rowboat, quartering upstream and then floating down with the current to run up the bank almost at the feet of a waiting traveller. The boatman steadies his craft, and when his passenger is safely seated, pulls away into the current with long, powerful strokes, bound for the Raleigh County side of the river in the last light of evening.\n\nThe man at the oars is a Richmond, born and raised at Richmonds Ferry and the sixth generation of his line to ferry the river. Stepping ashore on the far bank, he stands on land that has been in his family for almost 200 years. The history books differ as to just when the Englishman, William Richmond, first settled on the New River, some maintaining the late 1780's, others 1812. All accounts agree, however, that the Richmond Ferry has been operating continuously since the early 1800's. And the bottomland cleared by William Richmond is still inhabited by his descendants today.\n\nOld accounts picture the Richmonds as a family of great local importance. Judges, doctors, postmasters and merchants, all bore the Richmond name throughout the 1800's. The family was considered to be wealthy and was especially noted for fine horses and livestock. The Richmonds also had a reputation for great physical strength and were looked on as leaders in local society. The town of Sandstone was formerly called New Richmond and Sandstone Falls were known as Richmond Falls. But when the C&O was extended from Huntington to Cincinnati, it passed through another New Richmond, this one in Wyoming County. To avoid confusion, the name of Summers County hamlet was changed to Sandstone Depot.\n\nToday, Hobart and Jim Richmond live in the house their great-great-grandfather, William, built. They farm their 110 acres of bottom-land with a 1964 tractor and a spanking team of spotted Belgian horses. Everything on the place looks well cared for and neat .. the animals are fat, the crops healthy, and the 20 year old tractor looks like it just rolled of the showroom floor. On all sides, one sees the evidence of hard work .. the barn filled with hay, the carefully kept out buildings, the land responding with great abundance. A strong feeling of continuity and order, of commitments fulfilled and things done right, suffuses the entire farm with a aura of peace.\n\nA mile up the river road from their homeplace, perched on a bench above Sandstone Falls, lives William Richmond, Jim and Hobart's brother. Spectators at the Pioneer Days in Marlinton and parade goers throughout the state would recognize William .. but only in his dress. Disguised as \"Granny\" and with the help of his partner, Dall Gill, and his team of work oxen, he has won prizes at parades and fairs all over the area.\n\nExtremely mild mannered when he's in everyday clothes, William keeps to a rigorous schedule. Working six days a week in a deep mine near Beckley, William still manages to raise a garden, do his own canning and cooking, and \"batch along\" by himself. As if this weren't enough to fill the day, he also logs with his yoke of oxen, pulling timber off the hill for various projects he has going. During a rare break from this steady diet of hard work, William Richmond told me about boats, oxen and growing up at the last of the New River ferries.\n\nWilliam Richmond. I was born at Sandstone Falls. The home place is a two-story log house. There were 10 of us in the family. Old man didn't get married til he was 51, and had 10 of us then.\n\nMy great-great-grandfather build the house. I got my name, William, from him. The old deed is wrote out on sheepskin down there. It's that old. They owned 3,000 and some acres when they first settled here but they sold it off down to 110 acres.\n\nI ain't that old, but I can remember it all. I tell you, when we were growing up kids, you didn't have no new shoes, you fixed them at home. Got the old shoe last and nailed them and sewed them at home. And when you came home from school you took your good clothes off and put your work clothes on. Work shoes and stuff, a pair of old bib overalls. You tore a hole in them you patched it, you didn't get no new ones.\n\nIt was rough then. You raised your food, you canned it and all. Had to can it, had no other way of getting it. Pickled your corn in stone jars, canned pickles and stuff. Made seven or eight batches of apple butter a year. We used to make cane molasses, too. That was hard work .. grinding it up, you'd take a mule and run that cane mill all day long. Take them sorghum and boil them off .. take four of five panfuls and boil them off, next day make another run. Spend about eight or nine days at it before you'd get it all made up.\n\nThat's when we were kids and had to walk about a mile to school, wearing them old bibbed overalls. Didn't have no light bread for lunch then, biscuits was all they made. Didn't know what a store was, hardly. Anything you got out of a store, you took you eggs and traded for it, got a little bit of groceries and that was all you needed. Raise your own chickens, butcher about eight or nine hogs a year, salt them down. Butcher maybe two beeves. Flour and sugar and salt was all we bought .. the rest of the stuff we raised at home.\n\nI can remember when we didn't have no electricity, had to carry an oil lamp from one room to the other one down there. You dropped it, you broke it, you got the house on fire. Didn't have a bit of electricity 'til I was about 10 years old, just had to do the best you could.\n\nAnd by the time you worked from daylight to dark, you didn't have time to fool with nothing. We had an old tube radio, didn't work half the time. We had a Victrola, played them old records back years ago. You worked daylight to dark, or got your chores done that evening after you come in from school .. it was hard work and no pleasure back in those times.\n\nBack then, there used to be about 30-some houses around through this neighborhood. All out through here and up on the mountain. Eighty or 90 people would cross the river a month at the homeplace. We still run a ferry down there yet, 10 cents each way, that's what we still charge. We been running it for six generations now.\n\nWe used to have a big flatboat before the flood took it away. Hauled cars and wagons up on there. Hauled railroad ties across the river, my dad and them did. In 1940, I believe it was, the flood took it away. We'd take A-Model Ford cars up on there, horses with a load of ties. People would come off the mountain with ties and stuff, and instead of unloading them they used to pull wagon, horses and all up on the boat, pull it over to Standstone Depot, load it on freight cars, and haul it away. Charge 50 cents for that .. poling across there. The old man used to help them do it .. my dad did. Pole it across the river. They used to make tan bark, put it on wagons and take it across the river too.\n\nUsed to load cattle .. put the side boards up on the side of the boat. People years ago went from house to house to get cattle, didn't have no trucks running then. Brought them down here, put them in our barn til they were ready to load up that flatboat, put sides on it, run them on there. We used to swim many a horse across there. Lost one, one time, he drowned, as dead as *** age. They dragged him down *** in the holler up there and buried him, I remember that. When a *** would be swimming behind the *** there, a lot of times she'd just turn up on her side and quit swimming. *** loose that rope on her, and let her head go under, she'll come up *** and she'll start swimming. It's a *** pull them when they're turned up on their side. A horse, he ain't too *** he'll just hold his head up and he'll swim.\n\nWe were the only ones that had a boat. Everyone that lived on this mountain depended on us to cross the river. The old man used to be out in the field plowing and somebody would come along. He'd hook up the horse to the fence post there, and go on off. If they were across on the other side, they'd holler and he'd come across. There was always somebody there all the time. He had some brothers stay with him, and they did that ferrying a little. And they took a boy in and raised him .. Ralph Shuck .. and he ferried the river for years 'til he went to the army. I had an aunt there, she could pull a boat just like any man. People used to take their hands and stick them in the water, make it harder to pull. She would make them get their hands out of there, hard enough to pull the boat the way it is. We did that through the year round.\n\nLots of time, in the wintertime, the river would be froze over. You'd know the river was going to freeze up real hard that night and pull your boat up on the bank. That ice will crush and mash that tiny boat. And if it freezes real thick that night, you can walk way out there. Just drag your boat, put it up on the ice, and slide it out 'bout half across the river. It won't be froze out there. Get on the other side over there, put her up on the ice and go on again. Make sure you cross in the morning, because late in the day, the ice would start running, so thick you couldn't get through it. You get caught in that stuff, it would grind your boat, just eat it up. You have to cross early in the morning, before that ice from the Greenbrier comes in.\n\nThe old man never would let us out in the river to play with the boat. If nobody was going to cross the river, you don't get out and play in it. You need to respect that river. He wouldn't let you stand up in the boat or nothing like that. And if it was one passenger, you made him sit in the middle, didn't let him sit on the side of the boat, couldn't pull it if he sat on the side. We'd take as many as five people across at one time.\n\nWe make our boats ourselves, out of yellow poplar or pine or something like that. Usually get about eight or 10 years out of a boat if you take good care of it. Build one in about two days, cut the wood and everything. Make the ribs, make you a set of oars. Get a blacksmith to beat your oar locks out .. because them little ones that come out of the factory won't stand the pressure. Cut you an ash tree and start chopping on it, make you a set of oars. It takes a wooden boat. You can use it out there in that high water, where those aluminum boats rock too much.\n\nAfter the flatboat washed away, we kept a rowboat all the time, just carrying people across. Every now and then they'd take a motorcycle across in it .. it was a job, though, somebody had to hold that thing up. Cross the river, no matter how high, go way up the river there and come out where you want to. Had to use some common sense about it.\n\nMostly, when you took someone across, he wasn't gone very long. You just waited while he went down to the post office, got the mail and a little bit of groceries. They didn't get very many groceries, just got what they needed and came on back home. And they called Sandstone going to town. They very seldom ever went to Hinton. Jess Honake had that sawmill over at Sandtone, and when he put a bus on they started going to Hinton a little bit. Most of the groceries you got over at Sandstone and you got the mail there.\n\nAnd if you needed the doctor, had a baby or something, call Old Stokes who used to be up there at Hinton. Go over to Sandstone to the telephone over there. Cross the river and call the doctor, and he had a A-Model Ford, Stokes did. He'd come down yonder side, cross the river there. My old man used to have three or four riding horses, and we'd put him on a horse over here. He'd ride a horse to the top of the mountain, do his doctoring, deliver a baby or whatever it was, and come on back. Had to do it that way, didn't have no other transportation. That ferry was all there was.\n\nAs long as there's anyone that wants to cross, we'll still run it. There's two or three families on the mountain up there who come down across and get their mail over there yet. It still beats driving all the way to Hinton.\n\nWhen we was young kids, we used to fool with calves and stuff. My old man used to have a threshing machine, and he went from place to place to thrash wheat .. up through Abraham and so on. Only transportation they had to pull the thresher was with horses and cattle. They kept a yoke of cattle behind it all the time, to pull it with if they got in a real rough place. Took the horses out, put them on the other side of that mud hole, put the cattle in the mud. Mud would be two feet deep. Cattle would just get down and pull on through that mud. That's where I got the idea to keep oxen.\n\nAfter I got older, I got interested and I listened to the old man and he told me how to break cattle. And Dall Gill taught me a lot how to break them, too. I got one broke to ride .. took him out in the river, put a saddle on him, and broke him Indian-style. Put the other one in the river, but couldn't break him. You can break your lead steer, but you can't break your off steer hardly. Put them in the river. That way they can't hurt you so bad, can't buck so bad. I walked him from here on down to the homeplace and put him out in the river and broke him. I seen bubbles for a while. But I rode him back home, though .. I led him down and rode him back.\n\nThis team I have now, when I first got them, I put a yoke on them and kept it on. Left a yoke on them for a whole week. I put them out in the field, when I took the yoke off, and they stayed together, they slept together and everything. The thought they were born together. Right now if you find one, you find the other one. Won't be but six or eight feet apart. One goes to the barn, the other goes with him.\n\nI do my plowing with these cattle, haul my wood in too. Before I had my four-wheel drive, I had to haul my groceries in here, couldn't get a car up. I'd leave the car down at the bottom of the hill, come up and put a saddle on the steer, put sacks on and haul my groceries up here.\n\nI use them to log with, too, I'm going to start next week cutting logs for a log house. Take me about two weeks to cut and drag them out .. drag them about a quarter-mile, now. The steers are the only transportation I got to get them out of there. I bring out seven logs at a time, about 14 feet long and a foot through at the end. Just trail them up, one behind the other. And get your trail grabs in and come on off the mountain. Peel your two front logs, to make it easier sliding. I had a log up there two foot through on one end, 18 inches on the other, and 14 foot long. Hooked it to the steers and they couldn't shake it. Pulled it about six foot there, that was it. They'd give it all they got. I just rolled it over and peeled it a little bit, about eight inches on the bottom of it. Backed them up and hooked them to it, and come on out of there. If you peel a log, you can do wonders with it. You learn a lot in the woods.\n\nI plowed last year with that yoke of cattle, first time I plowed with them. Down there at the homeplace, made about 10 rows as pretty as you please. Then we hit a big rock, threw the clevis out in front. We tied a chain around the plow beam and went on through there, did about 20 more rows. Went onto another big rock, jerked the whole beam out if it. Hit that plow handle in my brother's ribs, bruised them up quite a bit. He said, \"Just take them and go on home with them. You tore up everything I've got.\" They wasn't a bit slow at the plow. When we hit that rock, that beam just went on out, and my brother went across the top of the plow.\n\nI started taking these steers to parades about four years ago. I carried Dall with me from the start. We been neighbors for a long time, shucked corn and broke a lot of horses together. Last year we went to Marlinton. We stayed in a barn up there, stayed with the cattle all night, and watched the horses pull down there. Then we got out cattle and hooked a plow behind, went down the main street and plowed it up. We won first place there. Went back this year, won first place again.\n\nDall looked like a mountain man, so he had to have a woman looked like a mountain woman. I just couldn't talk no one else into it, so I done it myself. So we go to parades and made everybody laugh. Yeah, they say, \"here comes that mountain woman, with that dress on, here comes Granny.\" We have a time with that dress, that's the best part about it. Me and Dall make a good combination. I like the old ways. Food tastes better cooked on a wood stove. And a Warm Morning stove, that's the only way to heat a house. A man gets used to this modern stuff, it's pretty good, lights and running water, like that. But this electric heat .. you turn it up, and you're still freezing to death. All you get from that is the bill.\n\nWhen I was growing up, all they had was horses and mules. Had one team of horses and a team of mules. Plowed corn all day with them .. that's what they done their farming with, horses and mules. Cut our corn shocks and shocked the corn, cradled oats with a cradle, baled them up and everything .. done it all the hard way. Yeah, but it was good time, though.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nNEWS ARTICLE From a Raleigh Co., WV paper.\n\nAbout the year 1785 an Englishman, William Richmond, who had come from the British Isles to Rockbridge county, Virginia, and thence to Pickaway Plains, Virginia (now if Monroe county), came down Greenbrier and New River to the mouth of Laurel Creek, at the present site of the community of Sandstone.\n\nAt that point New River is about 300 yards wide and too deep to wade .. but that pioneer settler who was to foster generations of Richmonds didn't let a river impede his pioneering spirit .. He had brought a bull along with him, so he drove the animal down to the edge of the wide stream, gave his tail a big twist, and the animal plunger into New River. William Richmond swung onto its tail and the two crossed the river just at the upper end of what is now called Jake's Island, which is one mile below Richmond Falls, named after that early Richmond district settler.\n\nSaturday the great grandson of William Richmond, Mr. Walter Richmond, who has reached the age of 64, rowed Attorney Floyd Sayre and ourselves across New River at that point.\n\nWe persuaded Mr. Richmond, who operates a fine river bottom farm with his brother, Webster Richmond, and his sister, Miss Cora Richmond, to tell us something about the early history of Richmond Falls.\n\nMiss Richmond brought out a handful of faded patents and deeds, some of them written on genuine sheepskin parchment. One of those old patents, written on sheepskin and signed by James Monroe, then governor of Virginia, granted to William Richmond that 10 acre strip of land lying in the middle of New River and bearing the name of Jake's Island. At the time the patent was granted, in 1800, that little island was a part of Montgomery County, Virginia.\n\nWalter and Webster Richmond have that island in corn this year and the crop looks good. The present owners who estimate the acreage of the island to be nearer 14 acres than the 10 called for in the patent, ford their crop across the body of water that lies between the island and the Raleigh County side.\n\nTheir great grandmother, Mrs. Susan Richmond and a great aunt, Mrs. Mary Richmond, lie buried on the lower end of the island.\n\nThe original patent to 337 acres of land at the great falls, one mile above Jake's Island, was first granted to John Stewart of Lewisburg, by James Woods, then governor of the commonwealth of Virginia. This was on December 8, 1796, and the patent, which the Richmonds still have in their possession, refers to the tract of land as being \"on the west side of Kenawa river.\" That was the name the Indians gave New river.\n\nA year later, on June 27, 1797, John and Agatha Stewart deeded that tract of land, then lying in Greenbrier county, Virginia, to William Richmond. From that time on the place came to be known as Richmond Falls.\n\nIn 1831 William Richmond sold Richmond Falls and 92 acres of land to his son, Samuel Richmond. At that time Richmond Falls was located in Logan county, Virginia.\n\nSamuel Richmond, three decades later, took up arms on the side of the Union in the Civil War. One day he was crossing the river on an old-time log canoe. As he neared the bank, someone hidden in the foliage on the other side of the river shot him in the back. He made it to the river bank, but dropped dead a few moments later.\n\nAt the death of Samuel Richmond, the Richmond Falls passed into the hands of his two sons, A.T.C. Richmond, father of the Richmond family who still reside one mile below the falls, and Henry Alexander (Tuck) Richmond.\n\nSamuel Richmond had operated a flour mill at the site of the falls for many years, and farmers along that rich Long Bottom section of Richmond district, and for miles around on both sides of the river, brought their grain there to have it ground into flour.\n\nToward the latter part of the century a man came there from the South and bought Richmond falls from A.T.C. and Henry Alexander Richmond for $15,000. He paid them off in gold and, so the story goes, emptied the little sacks of coins into their mother's lap.\n\nThe new owner of Richmond Falls operated the flour mill and bred thoroughbred horses and livestock for a time. He lived on another large farm on the opposite side of the river, below Sandstone. Later his barn burned and he left.\n\nLong before the coming of modern highways, Richmond Falls was an important link on the old mail route through to Lynchburg, Virginia. Those early mail carriers, who traveled horseback, crossed the river at the present site of Sandstone, travelled across Irish Mountain by way of Crow to Beckley. The route eastward went through Blue Sulphur Springs to Lewisburg and thence to Lynchburg, Virginia. It required nearly a week to make the trip.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nFROM RALEIGH COUNTY HISTORY by JAMES WOOD Samuel Richmond, a son of the settler William, was shot down in the middle of New River in 1863. Richmond, owner of 4762 acres of land in Richmond District in 1850, operated a ferry across New River at Richmond Falls (now Sandstone Falls). The County Court had authorized him to establish a ferry there on 27 January 1851 with a boat large enough to haul a loaded wagon, with one hand required to attend the ferry. Tolls were man and horse 18 cents, horse or footman 10 cents, a score of hogs or other stock 18 cents, wagon and two horses 27 cents, carriage and horse 25 cents.\n\nMarried to Sarah Caperton of the Monroe County Capertons, Samuel owned all the land at New Richmond on both sides of the river, including Richmond (Sandstond) Falls, Jake's Island at the falls, a grist mill, also at the falls, and the ferry.\n\nPro-Union, he was ambushed by Southern bushwhackers after ferrying an Allen Vincent across the river from west to east. He was returning to the Raleigh shore when he was shot on his ferry from the bank by Henderson \"Little Man\" Garten and Jefferson Bennett, who lived near Freezeland Mountain. Samuel managed to get home, but died.\n\nHis son, Henry Alexander \"Tuck\" Richmond, went after his father's killers, found Jefferson Bennett at his house, called him out to the porch, then shot him dead. Bennett's black dog was also on the porch, so Richmond shot him too.\n\nArthur Richmond was also a victim of Confederate bushwhackers. Born about 1811, the son of Jacob and Dempsey Richmond, he was a nephew of Samuel Richmond. His father was Samuel's brother. Owner of 1040 acres of land in what is now Bragg(town),Richmond District, the Arthur Richmond family was also strongly Union.\n\nCoveting a pair of horses that Arthur had hidden, Confederate bushwhackers seized him, but when he refused to tell them where the horses were hidden, they took him to the Abe Bragg grist mill on Pinch Creek, three to five miles from his home, where they again questioned him about the horses, promising to free him if he would tell.\n\nWhen he again refused, they tied and abused him. Then they took him down Pinch Creek, across Glade Creek, and up the road from Bragg to Crow. Halfway up the road, they tied him to a hickory tree and shot him after he once more refused to disclose where the horses had been secreted. According to family tradition, the musket ball that killed him was recovered and is still \"somewhere\" in the family.\n\nSeveral days later, three of his sons, Harmon, William and Nathan, and a nephew, William Plumley, found his body, \"gathered him up\" and took him back to his farm for burial.\n\nStories abound in Richmond District of people being harassed by Confederates, their silverware taken, livestock stolen, meat houses robbed and bee hives destroyed. Samuel Lewis Richmond, who lived near Pear, was so harassed he moved his family to Bolt, Marsh Fork District, and founded a Richmond settlement there.\n\nBack to Menu\n\nRICHMOND/FRAZIER LAND HINTON, SUMMERS CO., W.
