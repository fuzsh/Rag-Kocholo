        "text": "A trusted problem-solver, litigator for business, individual, and government clients\n\nOver the years, Billy Tunner has built a reputation with clients as the one who stays calm in the face of mounting pressure and adversarial forces. General counsel of large national companies, government attorneys, insurance companies, and professionals trust Billy for his counsel and success litigating in Virginia’s state and federal courts, and before state agencies.\n\n“I love what I do,” says Billy, respected by his peers as one of the Commonwealth’s top litigators. “I could not imagine doing anything else for a living. It is such an honor and a privilege to be selected by someone to be their lawyer, and it’s a solemn responsibility I take very seriously.”\n\nLead counsel in over 40 jury trials through verdict and countless bench trials and hearings, Billy is trusted by a diverse set of clients, including large and small companies, constitutional officers, state agencies, universities, and licensed professionals — plus everyday people with a legal problem who just need a loyal lawyer. “No matter the client, they all face challenges of trying to get a fair and just result in an antagonistic, adversarial legal system,” he says.\n\n“Every case has similarities in terms of procedure and process, but each one is unique,” Billy says. “I enjoy the problem-solving aspects and building a strategy that creates a path to success in a case.”\n\nIn 2020, Billy was elected President of the firm and began his term January 1, 2021.\n\nBilly sits on the Virginia House of Delegates House Ethics Advisory Panel; his appointment runs until 2024. In February 2014, Billy was appointed Special Counsel to the Opportunity Educational Institution by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Billy is AV-rated by Martindale-Hubbell, named in Virginia Business magazine as one of the Legal Elite in civil litigation and alternative dispute resolution, and is regularly named in Super Lawyers for his work in civil litigation in Virginia. He was selected as a Leader in the Law 2022 honoree by Virginia Lawyers Weekly and was recently inducted into the Federation of Defense and Corporate Counsel."
