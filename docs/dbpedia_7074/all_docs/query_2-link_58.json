His attitude toward me was demeaning and unacceptable.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 6/25/2024\n\nThanks for giving me an appointment quickly because my foot hurt and had a hard time walking. Dr Richmond gave me a shot in my heel and I can walk better.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 6/5/2024\n\nDr. Richmond and his staff have great people skills. They are very knowledgeable about my situation and have made my situation much, much better. I cannot say enough good things about the excellent care I've received every time I go there and in the surgery that Dr. Richmond performed on me. So once again, excellent people, excellent facility, and thank God for them. Thank you very much.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 6/5/2024\n\nI was very pleased with my doctor. He was very patient, very helpful, and I would go back to him and I would recommend him.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n3 out of 5 stars3 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 5/21/2024\n\nThe doctor was really great, shared great information. The office staff was less than courteous and there was more than an hour wait from my appointment time until seeing the doctor. That's unacceptable.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n3 out of 5 stars3 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 5/1/2024\n\nMy leg is killing me. I still got the pain. I've still got the metal. I haven't even been scheduled for the operation. Should somebody call me? I'm left in limbo.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 4/30/2024\n\nYes, the one about the question about washing the hands, the doctor was checking my feet. He just came into the room. I don't know, he probably washed his hands before he came, not in front of me. But so everything should be definitely yes. Thank you.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 2/27/2024\n\nI would just like to say that Blue Ridge is a fantastic place. Dr. Richmond is a great doctor with his assistant. And I would recommend y'all to anybody.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 2/13/2024\n\nI am very pleased with the overall care I receive from Prisma. I see three doctors at Prisma and I am very satisfied with the treatment they provide.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 2/6/2024\n\nDr. Richmond helped me with my plantar fasciitis on my foot and after two months he had it where it was not hurting hardly at all. I really do like him.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 1/10/2024\n\nIntake lady, imaging lady, and Dr Richmond were very friendly. The lady at check in acted like I was interrupting her when I walked in but was super friendly as I was exiting the building.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 1/9/2024\n\nI have known Dr. Richmond for many years. He has performed several surgeries on my right foot &amp; has always been professional &amp; I have been pleased with his work.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n2 out of 5 stars2 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 11/2/2023\n\nI needed more help than learning to tie my shoes another way. That will not help with all the numbness I have in my foot or the pain.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 10/26/2023\n\nThe nurse that does the splint, cast put on and removal is probably the kindest person I ever met in a doctor's office. Everyone from start to finish is amazing though. Always fast, but willing to answer any questions. Unlike any doctor's office I ever went to. And the surgeon, Dr richmond, is unbelievable! No nonsense and highly skilled. The whole visit is perfect from check in to check out.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n3 out of 5 stars3 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 10/26/2023\n\nDr. Richmond is one of the doctors who I value and trust the most and I'm a nurse. I don't trust every doctor but Dr. Richmond is wonderful. I'm sorry he's no longer doing knees, but I don't anticipate having to get surgery on my feet.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 10/19/2023\n\nI feel Dr. Richmond was extremely thorough, asked questions. Listened to me intently. The negative that I have really about the office is that if you're going to have to wait an hour and 20 minutes before your appointment, the appointments need to be scheduled further apart because it took me about almost 3 hours to do my appointment there, after waiting with, including about an hour and 20, an hour and a half wait time I had to see him. So, that's really the only downside I have, but I appreciated the thoroughness and sitting and talking with me about my condition,\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n4 out of 5 stars4 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 9/21/2023\n\nThe wait time in the waiting room was extremely long and no one came to tell me what was going on. Thank you."
