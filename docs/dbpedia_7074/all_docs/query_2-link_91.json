        "text": "November 29, 1934 – Westerose, Alberta\n\nOctober 10, 2019 – Calgary, Alberta\n\nDr. William Oliver Richmond, affectionately known as Bill, passed away peacefully in his sleep on October 10, 2019. He was predeceased by his parents Oliver and Mary Richmond, and by his sister Marion. He is survived by Patricia, his loving wife of 58 years, his devoted children Jeffrey (Alessandra) and Kristine, and his sister Jen. He will be fondly remembered by numerous nieces, nephews, cousins, friends, and colleagues.\n\nBill was born in Westerose, Alberta, on November 29, 1934. He quickly developed a deep appreciation of the natural world, learning to hunt and fish on his parents’ homestead at Buck Lake. Homeschooled until age 9, he also fell in love with books and all his life was a voracious reader of both fiction and nonfiction.\n\nHe began his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse at Balsam, where his mother was teacher and he, Bill, chopped firewood for the stove that heated the classroom. He continued his schooling in Faust, to which his family moved when his father took up mink farming. Every day before and after school Bill helped catch fish to feed the mink and did countless other chores. Time permitting, he played baseball, and was known as an exceptional infielder. Completing high school, he fished commercially with his father for a season before starting university.\n\nAt U of A he enjoyed chemistry, mathematics, and earth sciences, choosing to major in geology because he loved to work outdoors. During summer, he did paleontological field work in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation at Drumheller. There he discovered a complete dinosaur skeleton, which remains on exhibit at the Tyrell Museum.\n\nIn 1956, Bill joined Pan American Petroleum in Edmonton as an apprentice geologist. He finished his undergraduate work in 1957, earning not only an Honours BSc in Geology but also the Governor General’s Gold Medal for academic excellence, having achieved the highest grades in Alberta. This afforded him the rare opportunity to pursue a PhD without first earning an MSc. For a time he continued to work at Pan American, before taking a leave to further his education. He applied to and was awarded scholarships to attend several Ivy League universities in the U.S., including Harvard and M.I.T. He liked to say that he chose Stanford because of California’s warm climate.\n\nAt Stanford he completed the required courses, then took a break from school and returned to Edmonton to work. There he met his future wife Patricia, who was employed as a secretary. The couple married in 1961, lived for a year in Edmonton, and then moved to Palo Alto, where Bill completed his PhD in 1965. The pair then moved to Calgary, purchased a home, and raised their family. Visiting Stanford decades later, Bill was amused to learn that his 565-page doctoral thesis, Paleozoic Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation of the Slave Point Formation, Southern Northwest Territories and Northern Alberta, was the most consulted volume in the university’s geological library.\n\nBill had an exceedingly successful career, rising to Vice President, Exploration, and Vice President in Charge of Special Projects at Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. before retiring and doing independent consulting work. He called his decade’s consulting a renaissance of sorts as he was finally back doing the scientific work he most enjoyed. He was a member of the Society of Professional Engineers, Geologists and Geophysicists of Alberta; the Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists; the Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, and of Sigma Xi. Always an exceptional learner, Bill excelled at scholarship and research, but although by virtue of his PhD he had earned the right to be addressed as \"doctor,\" he was so humble and down-to-earth that for his entire professional life he insisted on simply being called \"Bill.\"\n\nFor all his career success, Bill was about far more than work. Among things too numerous to list, he helped coach his son’s Little League baseball teams, attended his daughter’s dance and piano recitals and his son’s judo tournaments, and generally spent a great deal of time with his wife and children, listening and understanding, advising and encouraging, talking and telling stories, and laughing. He very much loved his family, and it showed; in turn he was (and still is) deeply loved and appreciated by them.\n\nIn lieu of flowers the family asks that you honour Bill’s life with a donation to either the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society, or the Calgary Humane Society.\n\nFuneral Services will be held at McINNIS & HOLLOWAY (Fish Creek, 14441 Bannister Road SE, Calgary, AB) on Monday, October 21, 2019 at 2:00 p.m. Condolences may be forwarded through www.McInnisandHolloway.com\n\nA tree will be planted in living memory of William Richmond. McINNIS & HOLLOWAY FUNERAL HOMES, Fish Creek, 14441 BANNISTER ROAD SE, CALGARY, Ab, t2x 3j3, Telephone: 403- 256-9575."
