        "text": "Ray Richmond has worked as a journalist and author since 1978 and was a television critic, columnist and reporter for a number of publications, including The Hollywood Reporter, Daily Variety, the Los Angeles Daily News, The Orange County Register and (online) Deadline Hollywood. He has interviewed many of the most famous celebrities and icons in the world, including Elizabeth Taylor, Lucille Ball, Shirley MacLaine, George Burns, Chris Rock, Martin Scorsese, Ben Stiller, Amy Schumer, Steve Carell and Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nAs an author, Ray’s books include The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family (1997), This is Jeopardy!: Celebrating America’s Favorite Quiz Show (2004), TV Moms: An Illustrated Guide (2000) and My Greatest Day in Show Business (1999). He has also ghostwritten many books, including the final season hardcover tribute compilation for the Emmy Award-winning FX drama series Rescue Me.\n\nIn 2017, Ray fulfilled a lifelong dream by writing and producing a stage play. Entitled Transition, it told the story of the November 2016 meeting in the Oval Office between President Barack Obama and President-Elect Donald Trump some 36 hours after the election. In December 2017, the Huffington Post ranked it as one of the 10 best original plays of the year in Los Angeles.\n\nRay was born in Whittier, California and raised in Southern California, coming of age during a time of colorful change in the region. He was graduated from Hollywood High School in 1975 and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from California State University at Northridge in 1980. He is the father of three and grandfather of one and makes his home in Valley Glen, CA.\n\nIt was his being asked by many friends to help steer their personal stories that convinced Ray to pursue Family Sleuth Memoirs. As a professional journalist with great curiosity about the lives of others, it’s something of a perfect job. He modestly believes it will help lead to his changing the world as we know it."
