For renters, service needs to be in the renter's name and must list all roommates.Â For married couples, service can be listed in either name, however, both names will be on the account. If you are unable to come into the Customer Service office, a fax-able form is available.\n\nExisting Customer If you are transferring service to a new location, you must come into the Customer Service office to verify your Social Security number and sign for the service. Any past due balances or unpaid bills must be paid before new service is connected.\n\nNew Home Services/Services Off for Over Six Months Newly built homes or homes in which the sewer has been off for over six months, require an inspection by the City for all addresses within the city limits and an inspection by the County, if applicable, for county residents. TheÂ process begins with a temporary/hold date, signing for service, and then the service is put on hold pending the City's inspection.\n\nClosing Service You can call to disconnect their services. You must verify the last four digits of your Social Security number and provide a forwarding address and phone number for final billing.\n\nMailing Addresses\n\nCustomers with numerous addresses are kept separated. A bill for each property will be issued.\n\nPayment Options\n\nIn-person Payment Optionsâ\n\nMonday through Friday from 7:30-4:30 pm\n\nRichmond Sanitary District\n\n2380 Liberty Avenue\n\nâ\n\nRichmond Municipal Building drop box (in front of the police station)\n\n50 North 5th Streetâ\n\nRemitted by mail to\n\nRichmond Sanitary District\n\n2380 Liberty Avenue\n\nRichmond, INÂ 47374\n\nCredit/Debit Card Payments Â\n\nResidential and small commercial accounts have the opportunity to pay their sewer bill with a Visa or MasterCard credit card.

To set up, call (765) 983-7450.\n\nAutomatic Checking Withdrawal\n\nâThis service is available to customers who wish to have their bill automatically withdrawn from their checking account. To activate this service, you need to contact RSD at 765-983-7477 and request the Direct Payment application be sent to them. After the completion of the application and submission of a voided check is mailed to RSD, service will be activated.\n\nDisconnection of Service for Non-Payment\n\nA delinquency notice for non-payment is mailed to the customer when their debt is a minimum of 30 days (one monthly cycle) old. If the delinquency notice is not paid, water service is subject to being disconnected. Disconnections are done Monday through Thursday during normal working hours. RSD is legally bound to notify property owners of potential disconnection of water service.Â RSD will follow Wayne County GIS records for mailing address unless the owner contacts RSD with a correction. A monthly file will be on record showing all notices sent out to the tenant/owner. After disconnection, the customer must pay the entire amount of the delinquency plus a reconnect fee of $65.00, in order to restore service, unless a payment plan is established and maintained. RSD will keep on file a report of all disconnect charges billed to customer accounts.\n\nLate Fee A late fee of 10% of the outstanding fees will be applied 30 days after payment is due.\n\nLate Connect A customer signing for new service or disconnection of service must complete application before 3:00 pm for same-day service. Applications submitted after 3:00 pm will be processed on the next business day.\n\nReturned Checks If a customer's check has been returned for insufficient funds, a Returned Check Notice is sent and they are given 10 days to pick up their check.Â They must pay a returned check fee of $20.00 and the amount due with cash, money order, or cashier's check. There will be two (2) NSFs allowed on an account per year, after that time no checks will be accepted.\n\nâPayment Arrangement Payment arrangements are made available to customers who are behind on their bills. The entire bill is divided into one, two, or three payments, as specified by the customer. Their next bill will be for their current charges plus the amount specified in their arrangement, with the same due date as normal. If their payment agreement is broken down into three payments, their next bill will be for 1/3rd of the past due plus their current charges. The following two months they will be billed the same. Failure to make the agreed payments by the due date will result in a request for disconnection of water service and the full amount with penalties will be immediately due. Property owners must sign any payment plans requested by their current tenants.\n\nOnly the customers listed on the account are eligible to make payment arrangements or receive information concerning the account.\n\nIf a property is being sold on contract the legal owner is the original owner, until the completion of the contract sale.\n\nEstimated Billing RSD may estimate a customer bill for reasons including but not limited to the following: Â A customer request to estimate a bill, inclement weather, labor or union disputes, inaccessibility of a customer's meter, and other circumstances beyond the control of RSD, its agents, and employees."
