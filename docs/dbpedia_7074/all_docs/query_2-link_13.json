        "text": "Saturday, Feb 6, 2pm at the Stapleton Library, 132 Canal St, SINY 10304\n\nStaten Island OutLOUD kicks off our Black History Month events, featuring a new biography, Richmond Unchained, about the first Black sports superstar, the boxer Bill Richmond, born in slavery on Staten Island in 1763. He won his freedom as a boy, and moved to England to learn the cabinet-making trade. A favorite of some powerful British aristocrats, Richmond became one of the most celebrated bare-knuckle boxers of his time.\n\nThough Bill Richmond is generally unknown now, he was prominent in British society; indeed, he played an important role in the coronation celebrations of King George IV in 1821. Richmond Unchained, by Luke G. Williams, explores this remarkable man, a pugilist who knew William Hazlett, Lord Byron, Earl Percy, and the Prince Regent who later was crowned George IV.\n\nThis event is good for all ages, and is of special interest to sports fans, as well as to all who care about Black History Month."
