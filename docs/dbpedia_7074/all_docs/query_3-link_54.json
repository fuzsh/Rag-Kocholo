        "text": "Established in 1847, Hollywood Cemetery is a fully operational cemetery located in Richmond, Virginia. Located on the banks of the James River in the state capital of Virginia, the cemetery spans 135 acres of valleys, hills, and stately trees. Its natural and architecutral beauty sets it apart from the grid-like layout of modern cemeteries and its natural beauty has earned its recognition as a registered arboretum.\n\nHollywood Cemetery has been a fully operational cemetery since the 19th century. Numerous burial options are available, including lots, cremation niches, and a scattering garden, so you can take your place in history among presidents, generals, authors, and other famous notables."
