        "text": "Yes, by keeping a count of false alarms, businesses and residents are informed of deficiencies in their systems. A system that is not working properly can defeat the purpose of having a system. In addition, it diverts police officers' time from other duties and responsibilities.\n\nResidential Users\n\nNo charge shall be made for any false alarms during the first ninety days from installation or the first false alarm thereafter annually or for a false alarm to which there was no response by the Police or Fire Department. A charge of ten dollars ($10) shall be made for a third false alarm annually and a charge of twenty-five dollars ($25) shall be made for each additional false alarm.\n\nBusiness Users\n\nA charge of twenty-five dollars ($25) shall be made for each of the first three false alarms annually and a charge of fifty dollars ($50) shall be made for each false alarm thereafter annually.\n\nIf the fire hydrant is on the same side of the street as your home, you can apply for a permit to use the hydrant. You must first obtain a request form from the Division of Fire. The Fire Chief will assist you with the process of obtaining a permit from Cleveland Water.\n\nBelow is information from Cleveland Water outlining the process to use their water utility and infrastructure.\n\nTemporary / Hydrant Permit\n\nIn some instances, you may need a temporary source of water for a variety of uses. A non-permanent service connection requires a temporary/hydrant permit.\n\nThere are two types of permits available: metered and estimated. Metered permits are only issued for long-term usage (6 months or longer). All other permits are estimated by Cleveland Water. Please note: Customers in suburbs must also supply a copy of the approval letter from the fire chief of that suburb to use the hydrants.\n\nPotential acceptable uses for a temporary/hydrant permit include:\n\nConstruction\n\nDemolition/dust control\n\nLandscaping and community gardens\n\nFilling containers\n\nCleaning\n\nFlushing\n\nMixing cement\n\nFilling swimming pools or ponds\n\nFilling Swimming Pool Permit\n\nCleveland Water allows customers to fill a swimming pool by using a fire hydrant with the appropriate permit. The following procedure must be followed in order to obtain such a permit:\n\nObtain a letter of permission from your local fire department. If the permit is being requested in Cleveland, no fire department letter is required.\n\nBring the fire department letter to our Permits and Sales Department at 1201 Lakeside Avenue to apply for the permit. We will sign off and make a copy for our file. You are responsible for making sure your local fire department has a copy of the signed letter and permit from Cleveland Water.\n\nWe'll also need to know the number of gallons needed or the dimensions of the pool (i.e. length, width, and depth) so that we can determine the amount of water needed.\n\nWhen applying you will be given a price to pay for the permit before it is issued. You may also be responsible for obtaining your own fire hydrant hose, hydrant wrench, and independent gate valve to operate the hydrant.\n\nThere are no refunds on hydrant permits. This is stated on the permit form.\n\nNote: Some pool contractors will tell their customers they can contact Cleveland Water with their meter reading before they fill their pool from their homes so that they can receive a discount on the sewer bill. This is not true. There is no break on the sewer bill if the pool is filled from their home unless their respective sewer district allows the installation of a sewer exempt meter (deduct meter). In this case, no reads need to be called in ahead of time since all water will register on the sewer exempt meter.\n\nFor more information about temporary/hydrant permits, please call 216-664-2444 or email us at Permits and Sales. To obtain a permit, please visit us at: Permits and Sales\n\n1201 Lakeside Avenue, 2nd Floor\n\nCleveland, OH 44114\n\nThere are three special assessments that are most frequently found on your tax bill. One that is on most tax bills for Richmond Heights is a Sewer Maintenance Fee. This special assessment amount ranges from $50 to $200 per half and is put on by the County Sanitary Sewer Engineer. The phone number to contact him is 216-443-8201. Another special assessment is for the installation of the sewer line in your area. This assessment is put on by the City. The amount of this assessment varies by project. The time period of the assessment is for twenty years. You can contact the Director of Finance at City Hall 216-486-2474 for specific information about your sewer assessment. The third special assessment is for lawn maintenance performed by the City on abandoned and vacant properties. This assessment is certified by the City with the County in early September for all maintenance charges from September of the previous year through August of the current year. Most title companies will check for any future assessments to a property at the time of sale. If the title company does not check, then the assessment will follow the property, not the previous owner.\n\nThe Richmond Heights Community Center is only available to Richmond Heights residents. The deposit is $250 for the Senior Hall or the Kiwanis Hall and $400 for Both Halls. The deposit is refundable if everything is OK after the function. The rental fee for the Kiwanis Hall is $200, $350 for the Senior Hall and $500 for Both Halls. There is $100 fee for use of the kitchen. An auxiliary officer at $20 per hour needs to be present at all events extending past 5 pm. The renter gets ten hours of use at the lodge and that includes set-up and clean-up.\n\nThe deposit will hold the requested date and the balance is due 30 days before the event. If the deposit is made less than 30 days prior to the event, the deposit and rental fee must be made in cash."
