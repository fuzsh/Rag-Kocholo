        "text": "We know how scary and confusing it can be when you are injured in an auto accident through no fault of your own. We understand the stress that comes from dealing with insurance companies, medical bills, and lost income during your recovery. Our goal is to ease your stress and aggressively pursue the compensation you deserve.\n\nThe Richmond personal injury lawyers at Marks & Harrison thoroughly investigate car accident cases and consults with highly qualified experts in accident reconstruction. We can determine whether another driver’s speeding, distracted driving, drunk driving, fatigued driving, or other careless, reckless behavior caused your crash.\n\nWe can then seek fair compensation for your medical expenses, lost wages, pain, and suffering, and other damages by dealing directly with the insurance companies on your behalf. We can seek a financial recovery for you through the at-fault driver’s liability coverage and, if necessary, turn to your own uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM / UIM) coverage.\n\nOur Richmond car accident lawyers will strive to promptly resolve your case. We know the important role those funds can play in your ability to move forward after your accident. However, if the insurance companies refuse to make a full and fair settlement offer, we will be ready to fight for you in court.\n\nAs a preliminary step in your case, we can help you with getting your damaged vehicle repaired or replaced. We can also ensure that your medical care goes uninterrupted and meets your needs.\n\nWhen an insurance company representative contacts you, simply refer the insurer to your attorney at Marks & Harrison. We can take it from there. You focus on getting well.\n\nIn many ways, getting into an accident with a large commercial truck is different from other types of vehicle accidents. It is important to work with a lawyer who understands these important differences.\n\nAt Marks & Harrison, our personal injury attorneys in Richmond have many years of experience helping truck accident victims and their families. We know that, above all, these cases demand swift action in order to preserve and gather important evidence. We have written and lectured on the challenges of these cases.\n\nWe can get to work on your case immediately by investigating the accident scene, inspecting the tractor-trailer and other vehicles involved in the crash, and obtaining and reviewing records that can point to why the collision occurred and who should be held responsible for the harm you have suffered.\n\nThese records can include logbooks, inspection and maintenance records, and shipping records. Additionally, we can examine evidence that sheds light on the driver’s competency, physical and mental health, history of traffic offenses, violations of state and federal regulations, or, perhaps, drunk driving charges.\n\nIn a truck accident case, many parties may be held responsible, including the truck driver, trucking company, truck manufacturer, cargo shipper/loader, or a broker between a company and the truck driver. These parties may be based in Virginia or out-of-state. They may be foreign corporations.\n\nAt Marks & Harrison, our Virginia truck accident attorneys will work hard to hold all at-fault parties liable for your injuries and losses and pursue full compensation for you.\n\nDon’t wait to take action: Get in touch with us today to get started on your case.\n\nIf you have been hurt on the job, suffer from a work-related illness, or have lost a loved one due to an occupational injury or disease, you may be entitled to receive Virginia workers’ compensation benefits.\n\nThese benefits can cover all of your medical expenses and replace a portion of the wages you lose due to your disability. Unlike a personal injury claim, you do not need to establish that anyone was at fault in order to receive these benefits.\n\nWhile applying for and receiving workers’ compensation benefits should be a routine process, problems arise when employers and their workers’ compensation insurers refuse to pay claims. It is important to get help from an attorney who will protect your rights.\n\nAt Marks & Harrison, our Virginia workers’ compensation lawyers can help if your workers’ compensation claim has been denied or if your employer’s workers’ compensation carrier is dragging its feet when it comes to paying the benefits you need and deserve.\n\nWe work with clients across a broad range of industries, including construction, manufacturing, and health care.\n\nIn addition to pursuing workers’ compensation benefits for you, we can explore all other legal options that may be available in your case.\n\nFor instance, if your injury or illness was caused by a non-employer “third party” such as a negligent driver or the manufacturer of defective equipment, we can help you with filing a personal injury or product liability claim.\n\nThe options available to you in these types of claims can go well beyond what workers’ compensation benefits cover, allowing you to recover all of your lost wages as well as pain and suffering damages.\n\nDon’t wait to take action: Get in touch with our nearby personal injury lawyers in Richmond today to get started on your case."
