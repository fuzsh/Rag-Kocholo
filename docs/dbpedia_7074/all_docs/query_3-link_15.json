        "text": "The first American boxer to make a name for himself in England was a former slave, Bill Richmond, who was also known as “The Black Terror”.\n\nHe did this even though bare-knuckle boxing was illegal at the time.\n\nRichmond was born in Cockhold’s Town, now known as Port Richmond, on Staten Island, New York, on 5 August 1765. Some sources have his birth year as 1763.\n\nRichmond was helping his mother at a parsonage one day when Parson Carlton entertained guests, among them Lord Hugh Percy, a general in the British forces in New York during America’s War of Independence.\n\nThe general took a liking to the youngster when he heard how he had acquitted himself rather well in a tavern brawl with some Redcoats.\n\nPercy, who became the second Duke of Northumberland, returned to England, and took Richmond along as a servant.\n\nHowever, Lord Percy realised that the bright lad would waste his time working as a servant and sent him to a school in York, where Richmond spent five years.\n\nHe was later indentured to a local cabinetmaker and became a skilled craftsman. Being better educated than most Englishmen and always well groomed, Richmond had a good opinion of himself.\n\nThis, and the colour of his skin, rankled some of the locals and led to a fight with a 90kg blacksmith. The tall and athletic Richmond was 11 kg lighter but smart with his fist. The blacksmith was no match for him.\n\nOthers also insulted the young man and one, Frank Myers, was offended when he saw Richmond in the company of a white woman. Myers called him a black devil and other insulting names.\n\nThey agreed to settle their differences in a fight and Myers was well beaten.\n\nA similar incident led to a fight after a race meeting. This time, Richmond was up against “Docky” Moore, a soldier in the 19th regiment.\n\nA ring was formed, and the gentry watched from their carriages while others crowded around the fighters. Richmond won in 30 minutes.\n\nIn the mid-1790s, Richmond was employed as a personal valet to Lord Camelford, who was well known in sporting circles and a sharp dresser who frequented the horse tracks of York.\n\nLord Camelford took Richmond with him to races where he was often heckled and insulted because of the colour of his skin and his colourful clothes.\n\nIn January 1804, Richmond accompanied Lord Camelford to Wimbledon Common to watch the fight between Henry Pearce and Joe Bourke. Pearce won in 24 rounds in an hour and 15 minutes.\n\nThe fans were unhappy and wanted more action, so a hurried match was put on between George Maddox and one Seabrook, a dustman.\n\nThe nearly 50-year-old Maddox won after three rounds when Seabrook claimed his arm was broken and made off with his £4 purse.\n\nThe farce so incensed Richmond that when Maddox stepped out of the ring, he challenged him to a fight. The fans collected another few guineas and Bill fought for money for the first time in his life.\n\nEven though his opponent was a much older man, Richmond was beaten inside three rounds. His left eye was swollen shut and he could hardly see.\n\nWhen Lord Camelford died in March 1804 from wounds received in a duel, Richmond became a pupil at the Fives Court, where some of the best pugilists of the day trained between 1802 and 1826.\n\nThe Fives Court, in St Martins Lane, was later demolished to make way for the Trafalgar Square development.\n\nHis next fight was on 21 May 1805. Tom Crib had beaten Ikey Pig in less than a half hour at Blackheath and the spectators wanted more action.\n\nA Jewish man, known as “Fighting Youssop,” stepped up and said he was his people’s next champion. Bill needed little encouragement to take him on and soon the spectators collected 10 guineas for the men to fight.\n\nBill was too young and fast for his opponent and the fight was stopped at the end of the sixth round.\n\nNext up was against Jack Holmes, a coachman who only lasted 39 minutes.\n\nRichmond was then overmatched with the young Tom Cribb. They met on 8 October 1805 in Hailsham, Sussex. The fight resembled a chess match, with neither man prepared to take any risks.\n\nLittle has been documented about this fight, but Cribb was declared the winner after 90 minutes.\n\nRichmond, then 40, realised he was too old to make it in the prize ring, but felt he still had a score to settle with Maddox.\n\nIn 1809, he had a trial bout with Isaac Wood. He won it comfortably and then received backing from the sporting baronet, Sir Clement Brigg, who put up 100 pounds for the fight against the 54-year-old Maddox.\n\nThe fight attracted 3 000 fans to Popes Head Watchhouse on the coast between Margate and Ruculver. Maddox showed a lot of courage before he was forced to retire after 52 minutes.\n\nRichmond retired from prize fighting and began training younger fighters. He worked with noted fighters such as Bob Gregson, John Gully and even Tom Cribb.\n\nAround 1807, he became the landlord of the Horse and Dolphin next door to the Fives Court. In addition to being a successful gambler and running the pub, he continued to train and second fighters.\n\nRichmond’s most famous pupil was a black slave from America, Tom Molineaux.\n\nTom was uneducated, but he was a young man who weighed well over 91 kg, in contrast to Richmond, who, in his heyday, would have been a welterweight by today’s standards.\n\nMolineaux was involved in two epic fights with Cribb, the English champion. The first took place at Copthall Common, south of London, on 18 December, 1810. On a bitterly cold day, the 20 000 spectators were stunned when they saw an out-of-condition Cribb take a beating.\n\nCribb was saved when his second, Joe Ward, shouted foul after the champion had taken a heavy blow.\n\nWard made such a vociferous protest that the officials were obliged to check his claims that Molineax had concealed stones or bullets in his fists.\n\nThe argument bought Cribb some time to recover, and he slowly broke down the American, fouling along the way without warning from the referee. After nearly an hour, the cold and demoralised Molineaux quit.\n\nTheir second fight was witnessed by a crowd of 15 000 at Thistleton Gap, Rutland, on 28 September 1811. It was later alleged that Molineaux had eaten a whole chicken and an apple pie and had four pints of beer before the fight.\n\nCribb, trained by Captain Barclay, was in much better condition than in their first fight. A battered Molineaux was unable to “make scratch” after 20 minutes.\n\nRichmond, then 50, had kept himself in good trim and could not resist challenging the 24-year-old Jack Davis. After 13 rounds that lasted 20 minutes, Davis was savagely beaten and Richmond almost unmarked.\n\nA year later, Richmond beat the 26-year-old Tom Shelton before a crowd of about 10 000 at Mosley Hurst.\n\nHowever, Richmond realised his body could no longer withstand the demands, so he concentrated on training and teaching fighters at the Horse and Dolphin.\n\nAfter his success with Molineaux, many black fighters went to Bill for advice and training. He produced a string of good boxers, among them Harry Sutton, Sam Robinson, and Joe Stevenson.\n\nIn 1818, Richmond closed the Horse and Dolphin and moved his gymnasium to Whitcom Street, Haymarket. It was there that he taught Lord Byron, the poet, the finer points of boxing.\n\nLittle is known about Richmond’s personal life other than that he was married at one time and had a son who had a brief but unsuccessful prize-fighting career and eventually taught boxing fulltime.\n\nRichmond’s gym prospered and he became, in a sense, a pioneer for black fighters in England. He died at home, which is now on Titchbourne Street, Haymarket, on 29 December 1829."
