        "meta_description": "William (Bill, Pops) Richmond, 72, of Bradford, Rhode Island passed away August 28, 2012 at his home surrounded by his loving wife and family after a long battle with illness. He was the beloved husband of Mary Lou (Pucci) Richmond. He was born to the late Elmer and Lula Richmond in South Kingston Rhode Island.  Bill was a retired carpenter from Electric Boat in Groton, CT and all around handyman. He was an avid camper and spent many years with his wife traveling the states with their camping group the Swamp Yankees. He had many hobbies that varied from playing cards, yard sailing and clamming, to woodworking which led to many hours spent in his workshop crafting the next gift to share with his friends and family. Along with his generous heart and nature, Bill had a smile that infected all those around him which will be greatly missed.   He was predeceased by 18 brothers and sisters as well as his infant daughter, Elizabeth Richmond. He is survived by his wife Mary; children, William J. Richmond Jr. and wife Lauren, of Voluntown, CT, Melissa Edwards and husband Gene of Ashaway, RI and Jenny Richmond of Ottawa, IL along with his step children, Otis (Buddy) Burge and Brandon Burge. He also leaves behind six grandchildren, Zackary and Andrew Edwards, Kylie and Aislinn Richmond and Nathaniel and Samara Burge. He was the youngest of 22 children and is survived by Donald Richmond of Lincoln, ME, Ruth Bouchard of Charlestown, RI, and Ruby Burnham of Georgia as well as many, many many nieces and nephews and just as many friends.  Visiting hours will be held from 2-4pm on Friday, August 31 at Gaffney-Dolan Funeral Home, 59 Spruce St., Westerly, immediately followed by a funeral service at 4pm in the funeral home. Burial will be private.",
