        "text": "About the Author:\n\nLuke G. Williams has been a journalist and writer for 15 years. He co-wrote Masters of the Baize (Mainstream Publishing, 2005), which examined the careers of world snooker champions. On publication the book received highly favourable reviews, being named ‘Book of the Week’ by both The Sunday Times and The Independent newspapers. Masters of the Baize was re-printed, revised and updated in 2006. Luke has also worked as a full-time staff writer for uefa.com, sportal.com and euro2000.com, while his freelance work has been published in various outlets including The Guardian, Sunday Express, Snooker Scene and 007 Magazine. He has appeared on BBC Radio Five Live and BBC Radio London among many others. Luke maintains the boxing blog boxianajournal.blogspot.co.uk and has many contacts in the worlds of journalism, boxing and sports media.\n\nCover Quotes:\n\n‘Carefully examined by a writer with an obvious passion for his subject’ - Greg Jenner, historical consultant, CBBC’s Horrible Histories\n\n‘A fascinating and deeply researched account’ - David Snowdon, author Writing the Prizefight\n\nBook of the Week:\n\n• Books of the week - The National (UAE) 30th July 2015\n\nFeatures mentioning the Tribute being awarded to Bill Richmond:\n\nAuthor Luke G Williams said: “The Tom Cribb pub is a perfect location for a permanent memorial to Bill Richmond. Cribb was a champion boxer and contemporary of Richmond who was once landlord of these premises.\n\n“The two men were initially rivals but eventually became firm friends and spent many evenings conversing and socialising at the pub. In fact, Richmond spent the last evening of his life with Cribb in the pub.\n\n“I am delighted that Shepherd Neame brewery have agreed that Bill’s amazing journey from slavery to sporting superstardom should be recognised with a permanent memorial. For it to be officially unveiled by George Percy, a direct descendant of the man whose kindness transformed Bill’s life, is incredibly exciting.”\n\n• BoxingInsider.com - Bill Richmond, the first ever black boxer of significance, is to have his life and career honored in London next month. A plaque and portrait unveiling ceremony and “Richmond Unchained” book launch will occur on Wednesday, August 25th from 2pm-3pm at the Tom Cribb Pub at 36 Panton Street, London.\n\n• Saddoboxing.com - A portrait of Richmond and a plaque summarizing his amazing life and career will adorn the wall of the historic pub owned by Shepherd Neame brewery in recognition of Richmond’s position in history as the first black sportsman to achieve international fame and significance.\n\n• Eastsideboxing.com - Born into slavery in America, Richmond traveled to England in the 1770s thanks to the kindly intervention of Earl Hugh Percy, a British soldier renowned for his humanitarianism, who ensured that Richmond received an education and was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. It is therefore fitting that Hugh Percy’s direct descendant, Earl George Percy, has agreed to unveil this memorial to one of sporting history’s leading pioneers.\n\nAccording to Gordon: Of slaves and saints and boxers: A history lesson\n\nIt's time Richmond had another plaque hung in his memory; this one on the wall of the S.I. Sports Hall of Fame space at Mt. Loretto.\n\nEarl George Percy unveils tribute to black boxer\n\nEarl George said: “The relationship between my ancestor and Bill was remarkable.\"\n\n“They began life at opposite ends of the social spectrum and yet this relationship was created between them.\n\n“Bill went from life as a slave to become a sporting celebrity and an usher at the coronation of George IV.\n\n“It’s an amazing story and he really does deserve this recognition.”"
