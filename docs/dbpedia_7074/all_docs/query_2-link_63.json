        "text": "Bill Richmond, the first African-American fighter to gain prominence in British boxing, was born to slaves belonging to Dr. George C. Charlton, a minister. Not much is known about Richmondâs youth, but at the start of the Revolutionary War Dr. Charlton left New York for England, leaving his slaves behind. Richmond occupied his time sparring with British soldiers under the command of General Earl Percy, later the Duke of Northumberland, and because of his fistic prowess and his good character was made Percyâs valet and accompanied him to England in 1777. Percy paid for Richmond to to serve as an apprentice cabinetmaker, and Richmond learned the trade well, working as a journeyman in both York and London.\n\nRichmondâs first recorded fight was on August 25th, 1791. Richmond was part of a large crowd at the racetrack in York, when George Moore insulted him and challenged him to a fight. Onlookers formed a ring on the spot and offered a purse to the winner. Though Moore outweighed him by approximately 50lbs, Richmond easily dispensed with him.\n\nDespite his success, Richmond declined offers to become a prizefighter and continued as a cabinetmaker for the next seven years, fighting only in response to insults and personal affronts. After thrashing Frank âThe York Bullyâ Meyers in an impromptu match, reportedly over a woman, Richmond decided to turn to fighting on a full-time basis.\n\nHis early career saw a loss to George Maddox and wins over Youssop âThe Jewâ and Jack Holmes, also known as Tom Tough. But Richmond faced a sterner test of his abilities when he fought future champion and Hall of Famer Tom Cribb on October 8th, 1805. Giving away almost 30lbs, Richmond displayed a knack for avoiding Cribbâs heavy blows, and landed some of his own. He struggled gamely, but clearly took the worst of the fighting before succumbing in the 25th round of a 90 minute fight.\n\nThough he never again contended for the championship, Richmond continued to box for the next five years. He then opened a public house (pub) and taught boxing, holding lessons at the Royal Tennis Court in London. In his sixth decade, he fought twice more, scoring victories, and continued to fight exhibitions and impromptu battles for another six years. Richmond frequently served as a second and trainer, as he did for Tom Molineaux, another African-American, in his title fight also against Tom Cribb.\n\nBill Richmond was born in Cuckoldâs Town, Richmond (Staten Island), New York, 1763. He died on December 29th, 1829."
