        "text": "Bill Richmond, who collaborated with Jerry Lewis on the screenplays for “The Ladies Man,” “The Nutty Professor” and a half-dozen other Lewis films before establishing a successful television career writing for Carol Burnett and others, died on June 4 at his home in Calabasas, Calif. He was 94.\n\nHis death was confirmed this week by his wife, Saria Kraft.\n\nMr. Richmond was working as a jazz drummer with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra in 1959, backing Frank Sinatra in Las Vegas, when Mr. Lewis, attending one of the shows, came backstage and introduced himself.\n\n“We became almost instant friends,” Mr. Richmond told Written By magazine in 2011. “In the first place, I truly thought he was funny. Not in his act necessarily, but being around him — really funny in a way that I think is funny.”\n\nMr. Lewis hired his new friend to be the drummer for his stage band and then, sensing their comic rapport, asked him to collaborate on the screenplay for “The Ladies Man.” The film was a hit, and Mr. Richmond went on to share screenwriting credits with Mr. Lewis on “The Errand Boy” (1961), “The Nutty Professor” (1963), “The Patsy” (1964), “The Family Jewels” (1965) and “The Big Mouth” (1967).\n\nHis role, as he described it, was to set the stage for Mr. Lewis to ad-lib and indulge in physical comedy. “You’re creating for a guy who started out as a dumb act with this little record player playing in clubs — he couldn’t talk, couldn’t tell jokes, all he could do is be silly and pratfalls,” Mr. Richmond told Written By. “I realized I’m not going to write funny dialogue, but I’m going to try and put him in that situation.”\n\nMr. Richmond later made a smooth transition to television, first as a monologue writer for “Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In” and later, most notably, for “The Carol Burnett Show,” where he and his fellow writers won three Emmy Awards. “I had a sketch on every single show for the five years that I wrote for it,” he told the blog TV Store Online in 2015.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
