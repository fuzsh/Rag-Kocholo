        "text": "On the sweltering afternoon of 19th July 1821, a celebratory banquet was about to get under way in Westminster hall in honour of the new King, George IV, who had been crowned earlier in the day (as told by Luke G Willliams). In amongst the royal family and fabulously wealthy aristocrats were 18 men who had been invited to the occasion on the merit of their sporting prowess. These were pugilists, or prize-fighters, men who competed in a sport that nominally was the precursor to modern boxing but was more akin to modern UFC or MMA; there were no boxing gloves, and basically no rules.\n\nBanquet guests gasped excitedly as they observed the men, celebrities of their day and in peak physical condition, but there was one man who stood out among them all. Standing at 5’9 (comfortably above average height for a man at the time), he had not an ounce of fat on him and his presence demanded the attention of everyone in the room. Though his face showed signs of age, his torso was immaculately sculpted, and he was in considerably better shape even than the elite fighters who stood next to him. He also stood out because he was black. He was the only black face among a sea of white faces, and guests were fascinated.\n\nBorn into slavery\n\nBill Richmond's biographer, Luke G Williams, gives the most reliable account for his early life. He was born on 5th August 1763 on Staten Island, New York, to slave parents who worked in the household of Richard Charlton, a wealthy Reverend at St Andrew’s Episcopal church. Charlton resided in the town of Richmond on Staten Island and it is thought that this is where Bill took his surname from. He could have easily been condemned to a life of anonymous servitude, but events in the world around him produced a chance meeting with the man who would change his life.\n\nIn 1775 decades of tensions between colonists in America and the British government in London led to the American declaration of independence and the subsequent mobilisation of British troops in New York City, seen as a key port for the inevitable war. As a prominent loyalist Charlton invited the commander of British troops in New York, Hugh Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, to his residence on Staten Island the following year and it was here that Percy was introduced to Bill Richmond. The Duke was dazzled by the boy, who was only 13 but had such physical presence and exhibited such intelligence that Percy knew he had to take him under his wing. Eventually, Percy persuaded Charlton to sell the youngster to him.\n\nAt his headquarters in New York City Hugh Percy would often host important guests and one of his favourite forms of entertainment was prize fighting. Having spotted Richmond’s potential as a fighter, Percy organised fights for the boy and before long was picking out some of the toughest soldiers in the British army to test him. The teenage Richmond despatched them easily, and Percy was wildly impressed.\n\nThough a strong abolitionist himself, Percy did not want to antagonise the American loyalists he so desperately needed for the war effort by openly freeing his slave, so he did what he considered to be the next best thing. In 1777, he sent Richmond to England and paid for him to attend school in Northumbria where his ferocious intelligence earned top grades, before arranging a cabinetmaking apprenticeship for him in York when he left school. Cabinetmaking was a highly valued profession at the time, and local people were curious about why a black man had been afforded these opportunities by a high-ranking noble. Not everyone was pleased with his success, and some people were even less impressed when he married a local white woman, Mary Dunwick, with whom he would have several children.\n\nFrom amateur to professional\n\nRichmond continued his amateur fighting career in York but according to Pierce Egan, a local journalist in the 1790s, at least a few of his fights there came about because of racist insults that were hurled at him. Either way, he soon built a reputation as a formidable fighter, and it was a reputation that would open even more doors for him. Prize fighting was immensely popular in Britain at the time and transcended the strict social class system, with workmen and aristocrats alike keenly attending fights and following the newspaper reports which breathlessly gave details of important fights up and down the land.\n\nYet it was not until he was in his forties that Bill Richmond would start to fight professionally. William DeLong describes how, having moved to London with his young family in 1795, Richmond met Thomas Pitt, the Lord of Camelford and a former Navy officer. Pitt was an avid fan of prize fighting and hired Richmond nominally to help in his household, but Richmond – who always had a keen eye for social advancement – would spend most of his time coaching Pitt in the art of fighting. The two became friends and would attend fights together, sparring with each other while onlookers marvelled at the natural swagger of Pitt and the pure athleticism and guile of Richmond. By the early 19th century, Richmond was being paid to fight, and his professional career would end with a very respectable record of 17 wins out of 19 fights. Yet even the two losses were losses of the heroic variety, gaining Richmond even more respect. The first came in one of his first professional fights in 1804, where he squared off against George Maddox. Maddox was undefeated and would typically win victory against other opponents in a couple of rounds, but Richmond managed to take him on for nine rounds before finally succumbing to defeat. He would eventually beat Maddox in a rematch in 1809, after a colossal 52 rounds, winning 100 guineas for his troubles. He was 45 years old at the time.\n\nHis other loss had been in 1805 and would spark one of the most famous rivalries in early 19th century British sport. On a field in Sussex Bill Richmond faced the renowned Tom Cribb, 18 years his junior, and managed to battle him for 90 minutes before Cribb knocked him out. Cribb would go on to become the undisputed champion of British boxing between 1809 and 1822, and Richmond never forgot his loss to the young upstart.\n\nRetirement and death\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe Ministry of History is not an academic source.
