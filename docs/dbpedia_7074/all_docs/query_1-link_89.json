If you're having trouble paying the full amount, you should contact us at 804.367.8045 as soon as possible – there may be options.\n\nWhat if I can’t pay my bill?\n\nIf you can’t pay the full amount now, you have options.\n\nYou can set up a payment plan\n\nYou may qualify for an offer in compromise (a proposal to settle your tax bill for less than the full amount).\n\nTo discuss your options, contact us at 804.367.8045\n\nWhat if I didn’t pay my taxes by the filing deadline, but don’t have a bill from Virginia Tax yet?\n\nIf you didn’t pay your taxes owed by the filing deadline, but have not received a bill yet, you can pay your taxes on the following pages:\n\nFor individuals: Individual Tax Payments\n\nFor businesses: Business Tax Payments\n\nWhat if I think my bill is incorrect?\n\nYou have the right to challenge any bill or notice you disagree with.\n\nYou can request an informal review by calling Customer Service.
