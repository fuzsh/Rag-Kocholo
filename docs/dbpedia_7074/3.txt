Three-time Emmy winner and screenwriter Bill Richmond, who teamed with Carol Burnett and Jerry Lewis, died on June 4 at home in Calabasas. He was 94.

Richmond was nominated for five primetime Emmys for writing on “The Carol Burnett Show.” He shared three wins for outstanding writing in a comedy/variety or music series in 1974, 1975, and 1978. He also received a WGA award for the comedy/variety series in 1975.

Richmond was also the co-writer with Jerry Lewis for movie comedies “The Nutty Professor,” “The Ladies Man,” and “The Big Mouth” and four others. He also made several cameo appearances in Lewis’ films, such as portraying Stan Laurel in “The Bellboy” and the piano player in “The Patsy.”

Over his long career Richmond wrote episodes of “Blossom,” “All in the Family,” “Three’s Company,” “Welcome Back, Kotter” and many other shows. He was head writer on “The Tim Conway Show.”

A native of Kentucky, the writer was raised in Illinois. Following military service as a Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II, Richmond moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of being a jazz musician, where he became a studio session musician.

Richmond is survived by his wife, Saria Kraft, four children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Mobile Village Kitchen.
