        "text": "Bordering on Saarland is the Kusel District, sitting in the south-west of the state of Rhineland-Palatiante. Perched in the North Palatine Hills (Nordpfälzer Bergland) this region is heavily wooded in the highlands and is amazingly scenic as a result — summer or winter.\n\nKusel District Map\n\nNear Wolfstein is the famous Königsland (King Country), a large area of unbroken natural outdoors with hiking trails and some amazing wildlife — including the wild cat. Forested in beech and oak, this area offers not only the Kings Mountain (568m/1,864ft) to climb but also to enter — there are tunnels and mines here that are safe to explore!\n\nIt seems that wherever you visit in the Kusel District — there are castle ruins. Every hilltop or old town seems to have part of something for you to ramble through. Alternatively hop onto one of the railroad “trolleys” where you get to power yourself up and down the disused rail lines through the countryside to find more ruins!"
