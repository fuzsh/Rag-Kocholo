        "text": "Fritz Leiber was a heroic fantasy and science-fiction author.[1] He contributed extensively to the Sword and Sorcery genre (he coined the title of the genre in 1961),[2] as well as, in a lesser extent, to the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nHis most popular creations were Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, who have appeared in many fantasy magazines and have been collected into several volumes, including \"Swords Against Death\" and \"Swords in the Mist\". He also wrote other novels, including \"Gather, Darkness!\" and science-fiction fandom's Hugo Award-winning \"The Wanderer\".\n\nPossibly his most well-known supernatural story, \"Conjure Wife\" (Copyright 1953 by Twayne Publishers, Inc.) was adapted into the motion picture \"Burn, Witch, Burn\"[1] (1962), before being published by Marvel in two parts in Haunt of Horror #1 and 2 (June and August, 1973), illustrated by Walt Simonson.\n\nFafhrd and the Gray Mouser were introduced by DC Comics in Wonder Man #201 and 202 (August and October, 1972), then in Sword and Sorcery #1 to #5 (March to December, 1973), and later by Marvel Comics imprint Epic Comics, in four books named Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser (October, 1990 to January, 1991) \"based on the characters created by Fritz Leiber\"."
