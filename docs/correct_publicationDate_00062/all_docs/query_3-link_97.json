        "text": "As far as I can tell from his bibliography, Our Lady of Darkness was Fritz Leiber’s last complete novel. It was published in 1977, a relatively late work for an enormously prolific author who had been putting out novellas and short stories since the early 1940s. The back cover of my paperback edition (dated 1978) describes it as ‘Leiber’s first new SF novel in years’, which might have been true as a promotional blurb, but it’s a fairly generous interpretation of that genre. Anyone picking this up expecting conventional science fiction would be fairly disappointed.\n\nThe story follows Franz Westen, a writer living in San Francisco who earns a living writing cheap novelisations for a supernatural TV series. He is coming out of a period of depression and alcoholism following the death of his wife. He lives alone in his apartment block, though he has a handful of friends for company. And he has his books: instead of a partner, he shares one side of his bed with a heap of volumes that has, over time, come to vaguely resemble the figure of a woman. And then one day, looking out from his window over Corona Heights, he sees something strange in the distant parkland that catches his eye.\n\nThis novel is a paperchase of sorts. It is teeming with fictional references; it is perhaps one of the earliest books I’ve read which ties together a broad range of influences from horror and science fiction under a single theme, what is now sometimes called ‘weird fiction’. H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith are here, but there’s also cameo appearances from Jack London and Dashell Hammett. The title is taken from Thomas De Quincy; he’s in there too. Even M. R. James and Arthur Machen warrant mentions, the latter with reference to his membership of the notorious Order of the Golden Dawn.\n\nMysticism is woven throughout the story, often in a way which leaves threads hanging. The literary aspects interconnect with the strange book Westen has found in a charity shop — a text on something called ‘Megapolisomancy’ which purports to be a guide to the strange geometries and secret meanings buried in the layouts of great cities — and, accompanying it, a handwritten diary by someone who may or may not have been the author of the same thing. All of this is taken extremely seriously; there are passages here which seem to splice Frankfurt School theory with the esotericism of Edwardian modernism.\n\nIt should be noted that similarities between Franz Westen and Fritz Leiber are almost certainly intentional. Leiber’s own wife died, and he too suffered from a drinking problem — and in fact, readers have since shown that he lived in an apartment which is almost certainly identical to the one occupied by Westen. The most memorable feeling this book engenders is of wandering around San Francisco in a sort of haunted daze. The city is beautifully recalled in an amount of detail which often serves little inherent purpose relative to the plot. It’s like certain moments in Vertigo, or in Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Inherent Vice, where the camera seems to drift along according to a dreamy life of its own.\n\nWhen it comes, the apparition of the creature itself — the ‘paramental’ — is not entirely convincing, nor is it especially threatening. In part this is because we’re not given any real reason to feel it is dangerous. It never takes away from anything Franz holds dear. (Perhaps I had it also spoiled to some extent with the grotesque illustration on the front of my edition.) The writing is good in parts, but not great: it has a hurried, slapdash quality, one scene sometimes moving to the next a little too quickly. The ending is also a little ridiculous, with the author attempting to codify the logic of what happened in a smattering of brief disclaimers. The book is at its best when it allows itself to digress eccentrically over the odds and ends of Westen’s far-ranging literary knowledge."
