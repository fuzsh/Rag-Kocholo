        "text": "Any book that is less than wonderful would seem like a sad comedown after the small golden age of the Hugo awards between 1959 and 1964. Most books seem dull next to A Canticle for Leibowitz and Stranger in a Strange Land, after all. But Fritz Leiber's The Wanderer, the 1965 winner, doesn't just seem weak in comparison. This book is crap by any standard. It's worse even than The Big Time, the last Leiber book I had the misfortune to encounter – and that's saying something.\n\nBefore enumerating its many failings, I should at least note that the book has a reasonably interesting (if not particularly original) premise: a gold and maroon planet suddenly appears in the Earth's sky, breaks the moon into pieces, sucks it up and starts wreaking havoc with the tides, causing pandemonium.\n\nThe trouble starts with Leiber trying to describe far too many of the people affected, and their various attempts to work out what is happening and how to survive it. He introduces an overwhelming cast of characters with wacky names (Wolf Loner, Morton Opperly, Rama Joan, Tigerishka) and drags the reader around an exhausting number of locations in their pursuit. Even Alan Whicker would pall at the thought of traipsing from South America to south Wales to New York to London to California, into space, down to the bottom of the sea, up to the Catskill mountains and on to an alien planet in such a short amount of time. Especially since the people we meet in these places are so boring.\n\nAn interesting review on SF Site argues: \"He seems to be borrowing HP Lovecraft's concept of a hostile cosmos populated with godlike aliens who are utterly indifferent to the plight of humankind. Leiber supports the story's thematic pessimism about humanity's role in the universe by intentionally avoiding characterisation.\"\n\nI don't buy that line. True, it does turn out that the multicoloured planet is controlled by super-intelligent space wanderers who do indeed have a feline disregard for the humans they are tormenting. Leiber also has some half interesting things to say about the casual way Earth is all but wiped out. But it's optimistic to think that he deliberately fails to breathe life into his characters. If he wants us to care so little, why spend so long detailing their professions, proclivities and relationships? Why have them all constantly cracking wise-ass jokes like school weaklings bidding for popularity? Just as in The Big Time, he is unable to imbue his creations with emotional weight or depth, even when they're discussing love affairs, death and morality. It's also worth noting that his supposedly superior aliens have nothing to show that differentiates them in any way from the humans. They even share the same dismal sense of humour.\n\nEven if Leiber wrote as well as Shakespeare, following dozens of ciphers would be a hard slog. As it is, it's next to impossible. He suffers from logorrhoea – and the reader suffers because of it. Characters can't climb a slope, or even a steep slope. The poor sods have to struggle up a \"steep rock-studded brush-grown slope\". This chronic, over-enthused, straining hyper-use of adjectives - particularly pointlessly-hyphenated adjectives (not to mention excessive parentheses) – makes reading The Wanderer a real drag and the problem is compounded because, just as you think you are getting to the end of a sentence, another string of needless adjectives is thrown at you – and then an irritating subordinate clause that seems to serve no purpose other than to provide yet another flat joke – like this one. You get the impression.\n\nWorse yet, his scenario doesn't add up. Life continues without the moon and with an odd high-gravitational planet messing around in Earth's orbit, for a start. Bar a few attempts at looting, everyone seems too busy making bad jokes to even think about panicking. By the end, Leiber has introduced a second planet, papered over holes in his logic with nonsense about hyperdrives, and forced an alien cat without genitals to have sex with a human. This latter scene does at least have the virtue of being weird.\n\nLeiber also shows interesting prescience about the rest of the 1960s with descriptions of a few mad bus rides, lots of lame hep-talk and \"tea\" smoking. Such crumbs are scant compensation for 230 pages of pain. The most interesting question The Wanderer raises is: who on earth voted for it to win the Hugo?"
