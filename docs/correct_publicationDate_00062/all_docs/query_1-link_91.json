        "text": "Another retro-review, this time from January 24, 2011.\n\nThis turned out to be one of those books you remember more for the central concept than any kind of plot.\n\nReview: MetaGame, Sam Landstrom, 2010.\n\nSo is a book where “Life is the Game”, where our hero “must kill someone he’s grown to love” and is named D_Light worth reading? Is this just another improbable, game-obsessed society? A recap of Logan’s Run with this villainous computer possessing the boring, generic name Oversoul? Continue reading →\n\nInspired by The Books That Time Forgot, I’m reposting some earlier materials. Specifically, these are reviews I did for Amazon. Since Amazon occasionally screws up their formatting or just decides to lop the ends off with their cyber-cleaver, I’m going to start reposting them here with the original review date noted.\n\nFirst up is Ernest Cline’s masterpiece, his novel for the ages, Ready Player One.\n\nAs you can see, I was less than enamored with it.\n\nThe universe (and Steven Speilberg) disagreed with me. Continue reading →\n\nI’ve got plenty of reviews to write and a post-migraine brain only fit for web-surfing.\n\nSo …\n\nYou get a personal, elliptical bit of trivia about the Worldwide Church of God, Herbert W. Armstrong, and the uses two British writers of the fantastic made of them. I’ve mentioned the church in passing, and I assure you that a web or Wikipedia search for either the church or the man will give you some strange and scandalous reading.\n\nAnd one Sir Terry Pratchett (whom I’ve never read) shows up on page 23 of the March 2015 issue of The Journal: News of the Churches. Pratchett’s novel Feet of Clay transformed the church’s magazine, The Plain Truth, into a magazine called Unadorned Facts.\n\nBefore Pratchett, Michael Moorcock’s Jerry Cornelius novel A Cure for Cancer used a long excerpt from The Plain Truth, an article titled “Infection Exposed”, in his psychedelic collage. (Page 251 if you have the old Avon paperback omnibus The Cornelius Chronicles from 1977.) I’m not a big fan of the Cornelius books but that allusion endeared that one to me.\n\nReading I. F. Clarke’s Voices Prophesying War got me thinking. Does anyone write nuclear war stories now?\n\nThe bottom seemed to have fallen out of that particular literary market when the USSR’s flag was lowered for the last time on December 25, 1991. No more USSR, no more nuclear war seemed to be the popular thought.\n\nIt’s not that nukes went away. Continue reading →\n\nThere is a mountain of literature on what caused World War One and no general consensus.\n\nI. F. Clarke’s Voices Prophesying War looks at one element of pre-World War One European culture, the science fiction sub-genre of the future war story. Nowhere, does Clarke make any bald statement about where all those stories fit in the chain of causation, whether they were cause or effect. He doesn’t even argue that you can consider all these tales of invasion by airship, Channel Tunnel, or by the sea as helping in any way to lay the rails for the train crash of European civilization.\n\nHe implies, though, they reflected and shaped popular opinions in France, England, and Germany about the nature and outcome of a coming war. Continue reading →\n\nWith this hope, however, academies have been instituted, to guard the avenues of their languages, to retain fugitives, and repulse intruders; but their vigilance and activity have hitherto been vain; sounds are too volatile and subtile for legal restraints; to enchain syllables, and to lash the wind, are equally the undertakings of pride, unwilling to measure its desires by its strengths.\n\nSamuel Johnson\n\nWhen I hear the word “trope”, I reach for my revolver.\n\nAttention bloggers, podcasters, and reviewers:\n\nTropes are not themes. Tropes are not images. Tropes are not motifs.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nHoping that I’d learn something about the place of the future war story in the context of the First World War, I took I. F. Clarke’s book off the shelf.\n\nIt fulfilled my hope, and I’ll be discussing that subject at greater length in a future posting.\n\nReview: Voices Prophesying War, Future Wars 1763-3749, 2nd Edition, I. F. Clarke, 1966, 1992.\n\nFree from academic jargon, Clarke traces the development of the future war.\n\nThe main focus is on a period starting with 1871’s The Battle of Dorking by Sir George Tomkyns Chesney and going to 1978’s The Third World War: A Future History by General Sir John Hackett et. al. Continue reading →\n\nI attended Minicon 50 last weekend.\n\nOne of the guest of honors was Michael Whelan. I got the distinct impression, from him, that the economic future of the big art books devoted to one science fiction illustrator is not looking good.\n\nArt books are expensive to produce. They take a lot of time to assemble and proof. The availability of images, even legal ones, on the internet reduces the demand for those books.\n\nWhelan’s last book, Something in My Eye, was put out in 1996. I took the occasion to complete my Whelan collection and bought a copy last weekend.\n\nAt his slideshow, Whelan showed a lot of his work I had not seen before.\n\nFeast your eyes on his work."
