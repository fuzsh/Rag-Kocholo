A critic for Publishers Weekly claimed that, \"a literate and effective writer, Leiber is one of the two best fantasists to come out of the pulps—the other is Bradbury—but he remains under-appreciated.\" Norman L. Hills in the Dictionary of Literary Biography found that \"Leiber is one of the most highly skilled stylists in science fiction, with a fine ear for language and the ability to write parodies effectively.\" \"While other science fiction writers were producing adventures that spanned the galaxies,\" maintained Jeff Frane in his Fritz Leiber, \"Leiber dealt with people, not in the mass but as individuals. It is perhaps this, his concern with and empathy for people as thinking, feeling, unique entities … that has made Fritz Leiber one of the best-loved creators of speculative fiction.\"\n\nA Family in Theatre\n\nLeiber was born in Chicago, Illinois, on December 24, 1910. His father, Fritz Leiber, Sr., was a professional actor who appeared on the stage and in some forty films. His mother, Virginia Leiber, was a professional actress. When Leiber was a boy, he spent his winters with relatives while his parents toured the country with a theatrical company. Leiber noted the theatrical influence in his writing. Speaking to Darrell Schweitzer in Science Fiction Voices #1, he explained that \"I do at times tend to fall into a kind of Shakespearean poetry in my writing. And also I tend to cast stories in a dramatic form. I visualize scenes in my stories as if they were scenes in a play on the stage.\" An essayist for the St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers noted that Leiber \"was the son of an actor and had acting experience of his own, and many of his best stories give the impression that they are being intensely lived as well as deftly and fervently performed. He has the ability to inject a vivid realism into the most bizarre situations, whether they are developed with playful delight, gentle sentimentality or fierce intensity.\"\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Chicago in 1932, Leiber spent a year as a lay reader for two Episcopalian churches in New Jersey. At this time he also attended the General Theological Seminary in New York. He soon determined that a ministerial career was not for him and joined his father's theatrical company, touring the country for a year. Leiber also had small parts in the films Camille, produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1937, and Equinox. After marrying Jonquil Stephens, Leiber took an editorial job with Consolidated Book Publishers in Chicago, working on the Standard American Encyclopedia.\n\nLeiber began his literary career by supplying tales to such fantasy and horror magazines as Weird Tales and Unknown Worlds. In his earliest tales, he placed traditional gothic elements in contemporary settings. His story \"The Automatic Pistol,\" for instance, likens a gangster's weapon to a protective demon, while \"The Hound\" relates traffic sounds to the cries of werewolves. Still another tale, \"The Girl with the Hungry Eyes,\" features an advertising image feeding on consumerism and human insecurities. In \"Smoke Ghost,\" a man is haunted by a ghost born of the pollution and decay of the modern city.\n\nLeiber's knack for modernizing horror staples was described by Stefan Dziemianowicz, writing in the St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers, as the ability to \"make his horrors believable by making them seem natural outgrowths of their environment.\"\n\nStrange, sudden discoveries are another staple of Leiber's short fiction. In \"The Dream of Alfred Moreland,\" a man discovers that he is actually a figure in a cosmic chess match, while in \"Mr. Bauer and the Atoms\" a fellow learns that the atoms within his body hold the power of a nuclear weapon. In The Dealings of Daniel Kesserich, meanwhile, a man travels to comfort a recently widowed friend and discovers that all manner of seemingly unexplainable events have been caused by time travelers seeking to alter history.\n\nWitchcraft Goes to College\n\nIn his novel Conjure Wife, Leiber operates from the premise that all women practice sorcery to assist their husbands. When one husband, a sociology professor, realizes his wife's magic powers and forces her to abandon them, his personal life becomes overwhelmed with problems, and he is eventually compelled to integrate an acceptance of the supernatural with the rational. Brian M. Stableford, writing in Science Fiction Writers, believed that in Conjure Wife, Leiber \"brilliantly introduces witchcraft into a contemporary setting, not as a peripheral resurgence of something ancient but as an everyday domestic activity practiced widely and routinely by faculty wives struggling to procure the advancement of their husbands without their knowledge. The first half of the book, in which the elements of the plot are slowly but surely gathered together, is a masterpiece of suspense.\" According to Dziemianowicz, Leiber's Conjure Wife was \"a model that influenced the entire generation of dark fantasists who followed.\"\n\nAn essayist for the St. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers ranked Leiber's novel The Big Time as a \"major work in a series of time-travel stories.\" The story concerns a war fought by two groups of time-traveling warriors. Almost all of the action takes place in a recuperation center. \"By limiting almost all the action to one room and employing dramatic techniques of staging and dialogue,\" the essayist for the St. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers wrote, \"Leiber has almost created a science-fiction play, with first-person interior narration. Character differentiations are neatly provided by excellent parodies of the characters' differing diction and vocabulary (for example, Elizabethan and Greek dramatic styles).\"\n\nIntroduces Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser\n\nAlthough Leiber wrote a wide variety of science fiction, fantasy, and horror stories, he was best known for his sword and sorcery adventures featuring the two swashbuckling characters Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. These adventures, written over a period of some forty years, are noted for their witty and colorful language, fast-paced plots, tongue-in-cheek humor, and eroticism. Leiber, writing in the author's note to The Swords of Lankhmar, described the pair of adventurers as \"rogues through and through, though each has in him a lot of humanity and at least a diamond chip of the spirit of true adventure. They drink, they feast, they wench, they brawl, they steal, they gamble, and surely they hire out their swords to powers that are only a shade better, if that, than the villains.\"\n\nFafhrd, a tall, brawny warrior from the Cold Waste, and the Gray Mouser, a small, quick-moving thief, together seek adventure, romance, and treasure in the world of Nehwon, and invariably encounter crafty wizards, beautiful women, dark horrors, and plenty of sword-wielding adversaries. \"In story after story,\" Lin Carter said of the series in his Imaginary Worlds, \"[Leiber] has captained us on a voyage of exploration and discovery through the magical lands where his fascinating pair of delicious rogues dwell.\" \"These adventure fantasies,\" Diana Waggoner wrote in The Hills of Faraway, \"are distinguished by a sophisticated style and an excellent sense of humor.\" Norman L. Hills, writing in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, stated: \"In the series, the world of Nehwon and the city of Lankhmar are made real through richly detailed description and the almost baroque atmosphere of a decadent and strangely civilized barbarism. The stylistic influences of Clark Ashton Smith and E. R. Eddison are evident as is the rich description of Jacobean drama. The characterizations of the tall, northern barbarian and the small, city-bred thief are complex blends of love, pity, terror, and humor; in short, they are made to live as fascinating people.\"\n\nFafhrd and the Gray Mouser grew out of a correspondence between Leiber and his friend Harry Fisher during the 1930s. \"Harry and I began to create imaginary worlds,\" Leiber recalled in an inter view with Darrell Schweitzer for Science Fiction Voices #1, \"solely for the purpose of writing about them in our letters…. One of the imaginary worlds originally invented by Harry was the world of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.\" Leiber's son, Justin Leiber, wrote in Starship that the two characters were loosely based on his father (as Fafhrd) and Fisher (as the Gray Mouser). \"When I was a kid,\" Justin remembered, \"both my mother Jonquil and I called Fritz 'Faf' or 'Fafhrd' more than anything else.\" Leiber and Fisher also invented the pair's home base, the city of Lankhmar, a treacherous, labyrinthine metropolis of evil sorcerers, corrupt priests, and numerous back-alley thieves (organized into a thieves' guild, of course), widely noted for its easy accommodation of nefarious activity. Their world of Nehwon, vaguely reminiscent of both ancient Rome and medieval Europe, is thought by its inhabitants to be contained within a bubble of air floating in a cosmic sea. Perhaps it is, since Nehwon is a world in which magic works and magical events are commonplace.\n\nThe first \"Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser\" story, written in 1937, was read and commented on by the late horror story writer H. P. Lovecraft. Leiber had written to Lovecraft after reading and admiring some of his stories, and the two men began a regular correspondence. When Leiber mentioned that he also wrote, Lovecraft asked to see one of his stories. After reading it, Lovecraft circulated the story among several editors and introduced Leiber to such writers as Robert Bloch and August Derleth. In his interview with Schweitzer, Leiber admitted that Lovecraft \"had a big effect on my writing and continues to do so.\"\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Fritz Leiber\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Fritz Leiber, you may also want to check out the following books:\n\nDavid Gemmell, Morningstar, 1993.\n\nMichael Moorcock, Elric: Song of the Black Sword, 1995.\n\nNina Kiriki Hoffman, A Fistful of Sky, 2002.\n\nLovecraft's influence can particularly be seen in Leiber's novel Our Lady of Darkness, wherein the hero discovers that San Francisco is populated by demons who feed off the city's energy. Raymond L. Hough, writing in Library Journal, noted that in Our Lady of Darkness Leiber, like Lovecraft, uses \"increasingly fantastic events [to] slowly reveal a brooding, and unnatural horror.\" In other ways, Leiber modified the standard elements of a Lovecraftian horror story. He set the story in urban California, for example, rather than in Lovecraft's inevitable rural New England. A Lovecraft-style ancient curse is blended with the ideas of modern psychology. \"Lovecraft fans will recognize the debt,\" Hough observed, \"but they'll enjoy the differences too.\" Stableford, in an article for Supernatural Fiction Writers, noted the similarities between Leiber and his novel's protagonist: \"The hero of the novel, a pulp writer named Franz Westen, lives in an apartment building in San Francisco under circumstances very similar to those under which Leiber was living during 1976.\" Algis Budrys of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction called Our Lady of Darkness \"a major work of fantasy, skillfully created and unimaginably imagined…. There are things in this book that no one has ever thought of before.\"\n\nDescribing Leiber's place in contemporary science fiction, Budrys wrote: \"Leiber is one of the best science fiction writers in the world. [He is] one SF writer who has somehow made the Hugo and the Nebula [Awards] seem inadequate.\" Budrys believed that Leiber's place belonged in mainstream literature. \"Leiber is a giant,\" he maintained, \"[a] figure of stature in 20th century literature.\"\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nBOOKS\n\nByfield, Bruce, Witches of the Mind: A Critical Study of Fritz Leiber, Necronomicon Press (West Warwick, RI), 1991.\n\nCarter, Lin, Imaginary Worlds, Ballantine (New York, NY), 1973.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Volume 25, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1983.\n\nContemporary Novelists, 5th edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1991.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1981.\n\nFrane, Jeff, Fritz Leiber, Starmont House (Mercer Island, WA), 1980.\n\nLeiber, Fritz, The Swords of Lankhmar, Ace Books (New York, NY), 1968.\n\nLewis, Al, Fritz Leiber: A Bibliography, Mercury Press, 1969.\n\nMerril, Judith, Fritz Leiber, Mercury Press, 1969.\n\nMorgan, Chris, Fritz Leiber: A Bibliography, 1934-1979, Morgenstern, 1979.\n\nMoscowitz, Sam, Seekers of Tomorrow, World Publishing (New York, NY), 1966.\n\nPlatt, Charles, Dream Makers: Volume II, Berkley (New York, NY), 1983.\n\nReginald, Robert, Xenograffiti: Essays in Fantastic Literature, Borgo Press (San Bernardino, CA), 1996.\n\nSt. James Guide to Fantasy Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nSt. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1998.\n\nSt. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers, 4th edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nSchweitzer, Darrell, Science Fiction Voices #1, Borgo Press (San Bernardino, CA), 1979.\n\nScience Fiction Writers, Scribner (New York, NY), 1982.\n\nStaicar, Tom, Fritz Leiber, Frederick Ungar (New York, NY), 1983.\n\nStephensen-Payne, Phil, and Gordon Benson, Jr., Fritz Leiber: Sardonic Swordsman—A Working Bibliography, Galactic Central Publications (Leeds, England), 1990.\n\nSupernatural Fiction Writers, Volume 2, Scribner (New York, NY), 1985.\n\nSzumskyj, Ben and S.
