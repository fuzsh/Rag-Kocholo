        "text": "Who Goes There?\n\nToday I’ll be tackling an SF story by Lin Carter, which might be a bit unfair since Carter wasn’t much of an SF writer. He started out as a fan when he was a teenager, and in the ’50s would start writing genre fiction at the semi-pro level, although he never went on to become an acclaimed writer; on the contrary, Carter would become notorious as one of the worst fantasy writers of the ’60s and ’70s. But then writing wasn’t where his talent lay anyway. While he would be derided for his writing, Carter became arguably the most important fantasy editor of the ’70s, between his role as consulting editor for the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series and his editing of original and reprint anthologies. “Uncollected Works” was Carter’s first solo professional story, and honestly you could’ve convinced me it was written by someone else, since it’s ostensibly SF and doesn’t have the same overbearing style of his later work. It’s also quite different from later Carter fiction in that it’s not half bad! I had a fun time with it, even if it’s not to be taken too seriously. It would earn Carter his first (and only) Nebula nomination, which itself is not too big an achievement considering every other writer active in 1965 got a nomination that first year of the Nebulas.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the March 1965 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. “Uncollected Works” has only been collected (aha) twice, in World’s Best Science Fiction: 1966 (ed. Terry Carr and Donald A. Wollheim) and the Carter collection Beyond the Gates of Dream. I dare say it’s slightly underrated.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThis story is technically told in the first person, although at times it reads like second-person since the narrator, an elderly literary critic, is being interviewed by some journalist, and you the reader are in the journalist’s position. So the unnamed narrator is talking directly at us. As someone who used to write short fiction (and may well do so again), I’ve been sort of conditioned to think about how a story is written, down to questions the average reader wouldn’t be asking, such as, “Who is this first-person narrator talking to?” This is all told as a one-sided conversation, with the journalist’s side of the interview being masked by ellipses; we can only infer what we as the reader/journalist are saying. This is the sort of thing you have to consider when writing a short story, and as the narrator admits, writing fiction is not easy work at all. “Pounding a typewriter is hard work, young man, I assure you! Ditch-digging, by comparison, demands far less of one, or so I have been told.” Carter is being a little cheeky here, since obviously he wrote fiction (among other things) for a living and knew perfectly well how grueling it was, even if his narrator claims to not have that experience. There’s also some bitter irony in that Carter’s narrator is an old and respected critic, who is considered at least important enough to be interviewed (consider how many genre SF writers were either never interviewed or were only interviewed very late in their careers), while Carter would die in semi-obscurity and as something of an outcast.\n\nTo make a long story short, Carter would not have a very happy life; he died relatively young of cancer, and by that point the fandom around fantasy which he helped build in the US had left him behind. It’s a bittersweet life which produced a bittersweet short story here, although I wanna make it clear the narrator is by no means Carter’s avatar; for one thing the narrator was very much involved in Modernist literature, in the first decades of the 20th century, while I can’t say with certainty that Carter cared for the Modernists at all. The narrator laments Ezra Pound not winning the Nobel, which is a curious sentiment considering Pound was a fascist and his reputation as a poet was and remains divisive. (I mean hey, William Butler Yeats was at the very least a fascist sympathizer and he won the Nobel, so I suppose why not.) On top of past regrets he mentions, the narrator brings up some literary works that sounds made-up, and indeed they’re works that won’t be published yet—the “great” literature of the future the old man won’t live to read. At first we’re led to believe this is all just a figure of speech, but it turns out the narrator is being much more literal. Soon he mentions a story from his youth, while he was staying in Paris—an encounter with a strange older man he only calls “The Gentleman in Green.” They have lunch together and the Gentleman, who has clearly made a good living for himself, considers himself an inventor; he’s been able to live off the royalties of more than a few patents. There is one invention the Gentleman is especially proud of, though, and it came from a new field of mechanics: “Bibliochanics.” The invention itself is called Bibliac, a kind of super-computer, and there is only one of it in the world—the first and last of its kind.\n\nThe Gentleman had built Bibliac as a kind of mechanical computer, which can generate letters free of human input, but whose ramblings can be scanned and read with a separate monitor. Bibliac could be thought of as a precursor to the likes of ChatGPT and other chatbots—not true AIs but programs with a prompt-reaction system. Prompt goes in, shit comes out. There are jobs now where you, as someone who can actually write coherent sentences, “work” with chatbots so that they can “learn” to write like actual humans—only now with stolen material. (Do you feel like we’re living in the best of all possible worlds?) Bibliac is less an automatic typewriter and more like a million automatic typewriters feeding into one system, which, ya know, there’s that old saying about how if you had a million monkeys with typewriters you would, at some point, get Shakespeare. The overwhelming majority of the writing would be gibberish, but eventually you would get coherent English and maybe even Shakespeare’s sonnets. Carter seems to have taken this old saying (although maybe it wasn’t so old in 1965) and run with it, since Bibliac similarly prints out gibberish—or at least what looks like gibberish. It takes some time for the Gentleman (this would’ve all happened in the past, mind you) to figure out what Bibliac is actually doing. Upon consulting a linguist friend in academia the Gentleman makes a huge discovery—that the first coherent words generated by Bibliac are Sumerian, one of the oldest known human languages.\n\n“Of course,” says the Gentleman, “no one had ever bothered to work out the logical implications of the fifty-million-monkeys paradox. It would not begin with Montaigne, but with the very beginnings of written literature!” To be fair, neither does Carter totally. There are some logical problems here, which is why I call this story “ostensibly” SF, as it borders on fantasy. Really it’s too soft for most SF but still too rigorous and grounded in reality for fantasy, which you could say makes it perfect for F&SF. (Maybe also Fantastic, but F&SF would’ve paid more.) So, Bibliac progresses through literature, language by language (we’re talking written language), but how does it know to use which alphabet? There are almost as many different alphabets as there are languages. Is kanji included? How would the Gentleman be able to read 99% of this? He claims Bibliac even types out written works that are now lost media, such as the complete works of Sappho, but how would he know it’s Sappho? And would he even be able to read it? The Gentleman has devised a system to scan and sort coherent language from gibberish, but even with this filter it would surely be a nightmare and a half to read all this shit. Surely it’s not work for just one person, yet the Gentleman has been more or less working Bibliac by himself, in an experiment that has now lasted years. Holes like these are inevitable, since SF by its nature has to be founded on at least One Big Lie™, but you see how this can be distracting on reflection, and how “Uncollected Works” borders on fantasy.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nAs for the Gentleman in Green, he was never to be seen again after this chance meeting, having gotten run over and probably killed by a bicyclist right after leaving the narrator. The narrator isn’t sure if he survived, but he never got a name and it’s been decades since that meeting. And yet, so the narrator claims, even without the Gentleman’s input, Bibliac continues to run; by now it will have gone many years ahead into the future of written language, printing out works that have yet to be written by human hands. At the beginning the narrator lists a few future works of literature, but it turns out these were not mere hypotheticals, but real works that the Gentleman had told him about, and which will be written at some point in “our” lifetime, if not the narrator’s. It’s a bittersweet ending, perhaps more sincere than to be expected from so patently ridiculous a story. Of course we don’t even know if what the Gentleman said was true, or even if the narrator is being truthful, but, in that strange convention unique to genre fiction, we have to take these characters at their word. (It’s funny: in “realistic” fiction we’ve become accustomed to unreliable narrators and the possibility of characters keeping secrets, but in genre fiction we’re expected to take everything at face value.) Of course the narrator doesn’t want us to repeat what he’s told us, about Bibliac and its borderline magical power. “…But, if you will, remember those names. Paxton. Chiminez. De Montaubon. Jones, Von Bremen. Sir Edward Marlinson. Tierney.” Some of the great writers of the future. Maybe that’s what Carter really cared about, even for someone who mostly didn’t write science fiction: the future.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nMaybe I liked “Uncollected Works” as much as I did because I wasn’t expecting it. I was expecting garbage, truth be told, and instead got a story that’s pretty likable and welcoming, even interesting, if not totally logical. I’ve recently become sort of a fan of Carter’s work as an editor, and obviously as a fan writer myself I feel I should give him some credit, but it must be said that not all of his fiction is bad—maybe just most of it.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nKit Reed debuted in the late ’50s, actually part of the generation of women to come after that initial wave in F&SF‘s early years; had she been older or started earlier she would’ve fit right in with the first generation of F&SF‘s “housewives.” But Reed’s career would go beyond the ’50s—way beyond. She would keep writing until her death in 2017, and while she would write the occasional novel, she remains more recognized for her short fiction, and while she was not the prolific writer ever, she did consistently stick with the short story, even when market forces would’ve suggested shifting to novels. I’ve read several of Reed’s stories at this point and I would describe the ones I’ve read as “domestic satire,” including today’s story. Reed’s satires of the nuclear family and the emptiness of middle-class suburbia are more playful than vicious, in that I get the sense that while she had a cynical side she also didn’t resent her station in life. “Cynosure” is entertaining and to some extent an effective satire, but I think it could’ve been even better had it been a little less cartoonish and a little more merciless.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the June 1964 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It has since been reprinted in Marriage and the Family Through Science Fiction (ed. Val Clear, Martin H. Greenberg, Joseph D. Olander, and Patricia Warrick), The Penguin Book of Modern Fantasy by Women (ed. Richard Glyn Jones and A. Susan Williams), and Rediscovery: Science Fiction by Women (1964-1968) (editor not credited), along with the Reed collections The Killer Mice and Weird Women, Wired Women. So you have a few options!\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nNorma Thayer is a housewife, although she’s not exactly a wife anymore, her husband having filed for divorce and left her “when there wasn’t even an Other Woman to take the blame.” Now she lives with her ten-year-old daughter Polly Anne, plus a dog and a cat. This is a lot of responsibility for one woman, especially since Norma and her daughter have just moved into a new neighborhood, maybe in the hopes of turning a new leaf. Norma thinks of herself as a dutiful housewife, never mind being a divorcee; she does all the cooking and cleaning, and on top of that she does her best to keep up with the latest suburban fashion and household appliances. Unfortunately her next-door neighbor, Mrs. Brainerd, remains unimpressed. I was actually confused at first as to whether Mrs. Brainerd is supposed to be a human or an android, since futuristic technology is certainly on the table (as we’ll find out) and Mrs. Brainerd is described as “made of steel” in her introductory scene; but after delving more into the story this description is apparently to be taken metaphorically. Mrs. Brainerd is not actually an android, although she does turn out to have a knack for perfectionism that leads one to think of her as robotic. Despite being demanding and unlikable, Mrs. Brainerd stands as everything Norma aspires to be: she’s “small, slender, lipsticked, and perfumed,” and like Norma she tries to keep up with all the latest gizmos and gossip—except unlike Norma she does this perfectly. How is a single woman supposed to compete with this? How can she handle a kid, a dog, and a cat, and keep a house clean? Unless…\n\nIf you’ve read some Kit Reed before then you can guess where this is going. Actually the satirical use of future tech reminds me of Robert Sheckley, had he been a bit less of a misogynist. During one of her pets’ messy accidents (“You Know What”) Norma just so happens to find an advertisement in one of her magazines, which is weird because from what I can tell we’re not told what the name of the product is. Is it supposed to be Cynosure? (By the way, a “cynosure” is basically the center of attention. I’m not sure I’d ever heard of it before, and actually going into the story I assumed it’d be some kind of mythological reference. No dice.) The gizmo at the heart of the story has an unassuming, such that it doesn’t register as future tech—except for its function. “It was a box, small and corrugated, and inside, wrapped in excelsior, was a small, lavender enamel-covered machine. A nozzle and hose, also lavender, were attached.” I imagine it looking like a cross between a vacuum and a leaf blower. The idea is that the dingus lathers material in a liquid which renders the material frozen in place, until it’s unfrozen with a counteracting liquid that comes with the package. And yes, such a liquid would also work on living things. This is one of those inventions where I’m not sure how regulations gave it the green light, or how there wouldn’t be a massive recall once the exploits with such a machine would become obvious. Still, let’s not think too hard about that.\n\nI’ve read that even Reed’s SF can come off as almost like fantasy, and I can see why. The scientific—never mind practical—properties of the gizmo are a little dubious. It may as well be magic. Rather than hard-nosed SF “Cynosure” is much more like a tech fable, as well as a snapshot of life for middle-class whites in the mid-’60s, written before John F. Kennedy’s assassination but published after—only to collide with the Beatles arriving in the US. This is a side of American culture in the ’60s that history has all but forgotten about, if only because nobody remembers the conformists, and Norma is very much a conformist. The need for conformity in the suburbs was and continues to be a fruitful well for ambivalent and satirical storytelling, to the point where poking fun at suburban conformity has itself become a cliche. Of course we hate the suburbs—after all, a lot of us were raised there. I sure was. I recognize Norma in people I grew up with, or rather the parents of those people, the parents (the moms especially) who “kept up appearances,” even if they were getting divorced. It’s tempting, when reading Norma’s interactions with Mrs. Brainerd, to project some homoerotic jealousy onto the relationship; but this was probably not intended. Norma probably doesn’t even see Mrs. Brainerd as a potential friend, but as an ideal to strife for, Mrs. Brainerd posing as the perfect conformist. She doesn’t seem to have a life outside of her “job” as a housewife, her attitude being abrasive but in the service of conformity rather than individuality. Mrs. Brainerd is a robot—metaphorically if not literally. Which does make the ending satisfying!\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nMrs. Brainerd has been visibly disappointed in her visits, but Norma thinks that with the gizmo she can get everything just right for her neighbor. To her credit, she comes pretty close! She even freezes Polly Anne with the stuff so as to keep her in place during the visit—a tactical move that you have to admit is a bit drastic, but don’t worry, she’s not dead. But still Mrs. Brainerd remains unimpressed. Why? The cake the two women are having has got “that greasy feel.” Well tough shit, huh? Norma has one of those moments—perhaps a bit of a mental break—that would, in different circumstances, result a disgruntled office worker paying management an “unexpected visit.” Don’t worry, the gizmo doesn’t kill Mrs. Brainerd either, although I have to wonder what would happen when she’s eventually unfrozen—if she is unfrozen. Does Norma simply leave her like this? I have a few questions. The vengeance in sweet, though, as Norma and her family pile dirt on the frozen Mrs. Brainerd and the dog even “Did It” on her feet, her face contorted in terror and disgust all the while. There’s a snappiness and just enough of a viciousness in Reed’s style that it’s easy to get wrapped up in Norma’s revenge on her neighbor and possibly even see her as heroic, despite Norma being an anti-heroine at best. Humiliating her neighbor is undoubtedly sadistic to some extent, and yet it’s also framed as a liberating act. Had Norma killed Mrs. Brainerd outright it might’ve crossed the threshold in unintended villainy, but because of the reversable effects of the gizmo it’s easy to think of the ending as like something out of a children’s cartoon.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nPurely as a comedy it’s effective enough, but I wish it had been darker, more unsparing. It could be because I grew up in the kind of household described here (except my dad is still very much present in my life, if that means anything), but while the ending is satisfying in its way I was hoping (indeed expecting) Reed to go farther than she did. There’s frustration and vengeance, but ultimately it feels like it was all in good fun. Give Joanna Russ or James Tiptree, Jr. this premise and they could’ve given us some of the bleakest SF of the ’60s. Reed is perhaps an undervalued writer, and especially given her long and winding career it’s easy to think she would explore darker avenues elsewhere. Who’s to say she didn’t?\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nI think I mentioned earlier that I had never read a Miriam Allen deFord story before, which as it turns out is not true. I had read deFord’s savage little story “The Malley System” as part of Dangerous Visions, which is a perfectly dangerous little parable befitting that anthology, despite deFord being the oldest contributor by a good margin. DeFord was born in 1888, which would make her a few years older than the likes of H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith; and yet despite her age, as well as not writing fiction regularly until the ’50s, she was by no means a square. This could be because deFord is one of the few openly leftist writers active in the field at the time, with her writing for feminist and socialist outlets going back to the years immediately following World War I. She was also, incidentally, a researcher for Charles Fort, which gave her a connection to genre SF long before she actually started writing SF herself. DeFord’s work is certainly worthy of further study, not least because today’s story, while very short, is a haunting fable that, while ostensibly SF, functions more as ghostly allegory. “The Voyage of the ‘Deborah Pratt’” is not to be missed.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the April 1963 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It’s since been reprinted in the deFord collection Elsewhere, Elsewhen, Elsehow, as well as Terrors, Torments and Traumas (ed. Helen Hoke) and Rediscovery: Science Fiction by Women (1964-1968) (editor not credited).\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThe narrator is some four generations removed from the story he’s telling, and by his own admission it “may be partly myth.” There is some truth to it, of course: Jemmy Todd really was the narrator’s grandfather’s grandfather, and Quashee was a real person. Jemmy and Quashee were friends from childhood, but there was one problem: Quashee was a slave. Or rather, Quashee was brought in on a ship as a slave, although as the narrator tells it Jemmy family did buy his freedom at some point. Immediately we’re told that the story we’re about to hear may not be entirely true—not because the narrator is unreliable but because it’s simply part of the passage of time, that things that happened over a century ago will get mixed up as one generation recites to the next—assuming the thing is remembered at all. We’re being told this story in what would’ve presumably then been modern times, but the story itself would take place in the very early 19th century, when slavery was legal in several states in the US, though there was a growing abolitionist movement. The “Deborah Pratt” of the title is a brig that was stationed in New Bedford, the port town where we spend the opening stretch of Moby-Dick and where slavery was illegal at the time. The “Deborah Pratt” and its captain, Captain Pratt, Jemmy’s uncle, brought in slaves across the Atlantic illegally; the ship had to be quite clean of slaves when it returned to New Bedford. Jemmy was an orphan, and as Captain Pratt was the only man able to take the boy in, Jemmy spent time aboard this slave ship. But due to circumstances that could have been foreseen the illicit purpose of the “Deborah Pratt” was to end soon.\n\n(Just a note here, and I’m saying this as a compulsive writer and an amateur editor at heart; but should a ship’s name be italicized or in quotation marks? Usually I see it as the former, but if for example a ship’s name is part of a book title—itself italicized—then the ship’s name will be in quotation marks. But if not part of an italicized title then it seems the ship’s name should be without quotation marks. In the case of deFord’s story it seems she should’ve italicized “Deborah Pratt,” but for the sake of consistency I’m foregoing the italicizing in my review.)\n\nWhile Captain Pratt worked with his crew, Jemmy would hang around the slaves, especially Quashee, one of the children among them and about Jemmy’s age. The two boys, despite not having a language in common, get along well. “They would laugh together over nothing, draw pictures with sticks in the ground, talk to each other by signs and gestures. There was nobody else around of their own age or near it, so they gravitated together.” This is a small bright spot in what is otherwise a grueling existence, and deFord is merciless with what little wordage she affords herself, as while “The Voyage of the ‘Deborah Pratt’” is not a horror story per se it does gaze, unblinkingly, into what is by its nature an abyss. The slaves are chained together and stripped of their clothing. Those who die mid-voyage are tossed overboard, and even living slaves will be tossed over the side if the “Deborah Pratt” is threatened with being caught with its illegal cargo. For the crew the Africans on the ship don’t represent human life but a monetary investment. The most horrifying passages are not SFnal but historical. You may be wondering, then, how this story takes a turn for the SFnal, and since this story is so short I really have no choice but to tell you now: it’s a blinding disease, a virus which may or may not exist. Something strange and quite disconcerting starts happening with the slaves, in that the adults seem to be losing their eyesight at a rapid pace, their eyes showing “blood-shot whites and sores running with thick, sticky, yellow mucus.” The ship’s solitary doctor doesn’t like the look of this one bit.\n\nDeFord does something unusual with characterization, in that the narrator and (ostensible) protagonist are different people, yet they’re both passive in the story—the unnamed narrator because he’s simply retelling what he’s heard and Jemmy because he was a literal child at the time who didn’t quite know what was happening. The active characters then are Captain Pratt and the doctor, the latter spending much of his time very melancholy and very drunk. The doctor is a curious figure, as he’s clearly ambivalent with the business of slavery but nonetheless chooses to work aboard a slave ship; of course “officially” it’s not for slave-trading, but he’s perfectly aware of where the big money comes from. He even proves perceptive when it comes to the slaves’ mysterious and contagious blindness, saying they’re not really hurting from the failing eyesight but what he calls “nostalgia.” Which came first, the homesickness or the blindness? Did this virus come from Africa or is it not something that can be understood purely through science? The doctor informs the captain that he can’t find a cure for this virus, indeed that it seems to be incurable—and that it can spread easily. So we’re on a ship, in the middle of the ocean, with a virus that could render everyone onboard blind and helpless. The problem is that the slaves cost money, and even if they were to be thrown over now it would be quite costly. (I of course don’t have to mention that doing so would also be a crime against humanity, on top of the slave-trading.) The whites aboard are stuck with their infectious cargo, and things are only about to get worse.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nQuashee becomes both unchained and allowed to stray from his fellow Africans, which turns out to have spared him from the virus; but then it’s unclear if the virus only has an effect on adults. The adult slaves, which is to say every slave aboard the “Deborah Pratt” aside from Quashee, make the decision among themselves to commit suicide by throwing themselves over the edge as a group. Having lost their sight, both their vision and sight of their homeland, the slaves seem to have come to the conclusion that it’s better to die like this than be brought to the soil of slavers, where they might well be killed for their disability anyway. It’s a disturbing scene, not least because the slaves killing themselves does not stop the virus from spreading to the white crew, and by the time the ship is rescued by a British vessel on the high seas the whole crew (excepting Jemmy) has been rendered “totally and incurably blind.” The conclusion of the story is apparently factual, as the narrator was able to find contemporary newspaper articles on this event happening, although it’s left ambiguous if the crew was rendered blind because of some hitherto unknown virus or if it was perhaps something else. Still, the experience turns Jemmy into an abolitionist; he remains stationed in New Bedford with fellow abolitionists, and even helps in the Underground Railroad. The strange happenings aboard the “Deborah Pratt” had radicalized him. I wonder if something similar had happened with deFord to turn her to socialism as a young adult? Is there, in some metaphorical sense, a tinge of autobiography with this story?\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nYou could gripe about this story, that in-story it’s told by a white man, both from and for a white man’s perspective, and as written by a white women. The black slaves are not given words to speak, to express their anguish verbally, and even Quashee is not really a character. It’s a story about the inherent evil of black slavery, but it’s (probably) not written with the descendants of black slaves in mind. This is a criticism, however, that really can only be made from the standpoint of the present, now over sixty years removed from the story’s publication. As a story presumably written for white readers “The Voyage of the ‘Deborah Pratt’” is stunning in its economy, its ferociousness, and its unsparing use of SF-as-allegory to paint a venomous picture in fewer than ten pages. If the best of deFord is like this then rest assured I’ll be covering her again.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nIn the ’50s and early ’60s there was a group of writers, who really aside from their gender had little in common, whom James Blish called pejoratively the “housewives” of F&SF. Judith Merril, Margaret St. Clair, Kit Reed, Carol Emshwiller, Rosel George Brown, and not the least of these, Zenna Henderson. She did appear elsewhere, but nearly all of her fiction appeared in the pages of F&SF, and unlike some of her contemporaries she didn’t turn to writing novels once market forces demanded it. I’ve read a few Henderson stories before, but until now I’ve not given much thought as to what goes into her writing. You could say time has been somewhat uncharitable to Henderson’s work; aside from her work being out of print, her output went down after the early ’70s, possibly because the field had changed so radically that there was no place for someone of her disposition. It’s hard to say. ISFDB lists only two interviews with Henderson, both from the ’70s, and the interviewer is the same fucking guy (Paul Walker, but not that one) in both cases. “Subcommittee” is a somewhat feminist story that probably would not have been impressive ten years after publication. Here we have a first contact story that’s unquestionably Henderson, for both good and ill: it’s a subversion of militaristic alien encounter narratives of the era, even if it still comes off as implicitly conservative. You’ll see what I mean.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the July 1962 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It was reprinted in The 8th Annual of the Year’s Best S-F (ed. Judith Merril), Gentle Invaders (ed. Hans Stefan Santesson), Young Extraterrestrials (ed. Isaac Asimov, Martin H. Greenberg, and Charles G. Waugh), New Eves: Science Fiction About the Extraordinary Women of Today and Tomorrow (ed. Forrest J. Ackerman, Janrae Frank, and Jean Marie Stine), as well as the Henderson collections The Anything Box and Believing: The Other Stories of Zenna Henderson.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nA human (read: American) fleet has come into contact with a fleet of alien ships, or rather the alien ships have brought the party to the humans. The Linjeni are a somewhat humanoid race, albeit covered in fur, like a race of Sasquatches. Serena is a wife and mother, whose husband Thorn is one of the generals aboard the human fleet, and so far things are not looking too good. The problem is that nobody has any idea what the other side is trying to communicate, and while the civilians on both sides are kept safe on a nearby beach, the civilians of both sides are separated by a fence. Officially Serena is not allowed to communicate with the civilians on the other side, and vice versa. The Linjeni are here for a reason—maybe for innocuous reasons, maybe to pick a fight with the humans. Serena already has her work cut out for her, but she soon discovers her son Splinter (get it? Thorn? Splinter?) has dug a hole under the fence so he can hang out with Doovie, a child of the alien race, in secret. On the one hand it’s hard to blame Splinter for wanting such attention, since as Serena points out he’s the only human child in the human party; but still, making direct contact with the Linjeni could have very bad consequences; this being a Henderson story, however, we can guess in advance that the consequences can’t be too bad. Personally I’d be more concerned about contracting or spreading disease when interacting with an alien race, but who am I to judge?\n\nDespite being published in the ’60s “Subcommittee” very much feels like a leftover from the ’50s, and while I do love me some ’50s genre SF I can’t say I was taken with this one. Despite featuring a few main characters there’s only one character in the Shakespearean sense, in that she has some kind of inner life, which would be Serena. We actually get some insight into what Serena is thinking, although it isn’t much. Splinter is a gosh-wow caricature, a pretty common sort that would’ve been the standard for writing children characters in the field then, while the aliens lack individual personalities. Even “Mrs. Pink” (nicknamed for her pink fur), Serena’s counterpart, is a character who sort of exists simply for the sake of the plot. Now, as for the adult male characters, there are only two: Thorn, and another general of the fleet whose name is unimportant. The men, when we do see them, are irrational, panicky creatures whose whole thought processes are hijacked by fears of all-out war with the aliens. These too are caricatures, although I do think Henderson intended for us to take them as such anyway, as opposed to as real characters. The men have to be warmongers so that Serena can not only come out looking all the better but devise a solution, with a little help from her son of course. This is a problem story with two basic questions: “How can we start to understand the aliens’ language?” and “What do these aliens want?” These questions are naturally conjoined at the hip: once you answer the first you can then answer the second.\n\nOnce they brought up knitting I knew it was over. Serena becomes an accomplice to Splinter and starts making friends with Mrs. Pink and the other female aliens. At first they aren’t able to communicate with even the most basic words, but thankfully actions will usually do the trick where words fail, and so it doesn’t take long for the humans and aliens to find a common ground. This is all done, of course, in secret, behind Thorn’s back, since he wouldn’t understand things women do together when they’re bored, and anyway, an ill-timed revealing of the connection between the races could prove catastrophic. Still one thing is certain: the Linjeni are not the enemy. I’m about to go on a rant about this story’s politics, but before I do that I wanna give credit where credit is due, in that this is very much an anti-xenophobia narrative. Hostility towards the aliens is consistently framed as misguided at best. When I say Henderson’s brand of “feminism” is actually conservative I don’t mean this in how we modern Americans understand “conservatism,” which is xenophobic and anti-intellectual—a crippling fear of the abnormal. Henderson doesn’t fear the abnormal so much as she embraces the normal, to the point of trying to connect with marginalized groups on the basis of “normalcy.” She worked with interned Japanese-Americans during World War II, which probably contributed to her accepting view of minority groups—assuming we’re supposed to take the Linjeni as a stand-in for minority groups.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nIt turns out the Linjeni are a dying race, and the reason they’ve come to Earth is that our planet is incredibly rich in salt water (indeed it takes up the majority of the planet’s surface), and salt is something the Linjeni need to survive. Their own planet has run dry on the stuff, and the survivors have become a collective of vagabonds. “The Linjeni must have come seeking asylum—or demanding it. Neighbors who were afraid to ask—or hadn’t been given time to ask.” If the human fleet were to strike now they would be committing genocide, unbeknownst to the men aboard. The moral implications of the situation might’ve been more fleshed out in the hands of a different writer (but then, maybe not), but regardless we aren’t given much time to dwell on this before Serena and Splinter swoop in to save the day, managing to reason with the human fleet’s high command and prevent what would’ve been a very costly war. (I should mention at some point that this story moves fairly quickly, which I guess is a positive. It’s classified as a novelette, but if so it barely counts.) The nuclear family is such a sacred model (Henderson supposes) that it can serve as common ground for two sentient races who can barely understand each other through words. Of course it would be astronomically good luck (or bad) for humanity to make contact with a fellow intelligent race in the universe, but to have said race not only be somewhat humanoid but conventionally monogamous? That must be like hitting the jackpot ten times over. Imagine the odds. Of course I’m being a little unfair here, but our emotions are never fair and always in the direction of the wind, and reading the climax of this story I couldn’t help but feels like I’d been cheated in some way.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nIt’s… cute. So naturally I wasn’t a fan. Sorry. (I will admit I’m one of those few unhappy people who found This Is How You Lose the Time War to be too saccharine for my liking.) It’s easy to poke fun at, but then so is anything that is earnest, and I do think Henderson (between this and her other stories I’ve read) was being earnest if nothing else. It must’ve been really something, in the ’60s, to go from the invention of The Pill™ at the start of the decade to, by the end of it, seeing feminism not only advance rapidly but splinter into some very interesting and intellectually demanding schools of thought. Henderson’s “feminism,” if it can really be called that, is totally lacking in intersectionality, and its cloying admiration of the nuclear family model now reads as like nails on a chalkboard. And yet, I don’t think a male chauvinist, especially of the time, could’ve written “Subcommittee,” which in itself should be worth something.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nBrian W. Aldiss debuted in the mid-’50s, and within just a few years he emerged as one of the most eye-catching talents in genre SF, on both sides of the Atlantic. Being a British writer he naturally started with the UK magazines, but once he found a home in F&SF stateside it was clear he was a talent not to be fucked with. He would have one of the longest and most acclaimed (at least among fellow writers) careers of any genre SF writer, having started in the ’50s but seamlessly becoming a crucial figure in the New Wave a decade later. He wrote one of the first notable histories of the field, Billion Year Spree, then later massively revised it and co-wrote with David Wingrove to make Trillion Year Spree, the latter winning him (and Wingrove) a Hugo. Of course Aldiss had already won a Hugo, this one for fiction, under circumstances so unusual as to not be repeated. See, people usually count Hothouse as a novel, although it’s really a fix-up of related stories; and the “novel,” as a series of linked stories, won Aldiss the 1962 Hugo for Short Fiction. It remains the only example of a short fiction Hugo going to a group of stories. Admittedly had Hothouse (initially titled The Long Afternoon of Earth in the US) been counted as a novel then Aldiss would’ve stood no chance against the titan that was Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land. I’ve read “Hothouse” before, although I’m rereading it and reviewing it now because I remember basically nothing from that first encounter. I’ve not read the other stories yet, but rest assured I’ll be covering them on this site in due time.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the February 1961 issue of The Magazine and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. Obviously you can find “Hothouse” in its novel form, but as a standalone story it’s also been reprinted in Mutants: Eleven Stories of Science Fiction (ed. Robert Silverberg), The Great Science Fiction Series (ed. Martin H. Greenberg, Joseph Olander, and Frederik Pohl), The Great SF Stories #23 (ed. Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg), and a Silverberg anthology that’s gone by two titles, Robert Silverberg’s Worlds of Wonder and Science Fiction: 101. That last one comes with commentary on each story which at the very least may prove interesting to you, if not helpful as a would-be short fiction writer.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThe epigraph of this story is a couplet from the Andrew Marvell poem titled “To His Coy Mistress,” a borderline erotic love poem in which, seemingly, the narrator’s beloved is conflated with a tree—maybe not just a tree but the tree. All the trees of the world. It’s a proto-environmentalist poem that you’ve very likely seen quoted elsewhere if you’re a seasoned SF reader, since Ursula K. Le Guin quotes the same couplet for her short story “Vaster Than Empires and More Slow.” If I had a nickel for every time this poem has been quoted in 20th century science fiction I would have at least two nickels—which may not sound like a lot, but it’s weird that it happened at least twice! Of course in the case of the Aldiss story the tree of Marvell’s poem is indeed a single tree that has grown so as to become a vast forest by itself. “On this great continent where the humans lived, only one banyan tree grew now. It had become first King of the forest, then it had become the forest itself. It had conquered the deserts and the mountains and the swamps.” The single banyan tree has conquered the “day” half of the world, serving as the base for what has now become mostly varieties of plant life, from fungi to strange bulking plants called “traversers” that can easily be confused for enormous spiders. Earth and the moon have become locked in place in relation to each other, such that one half of the world is literally always day while the other is always without light, and the traversers have even somehow built a network of webs that acts as a path between Earth and the moon. The only non-plant life on land is a few species of insect, which nonetheless have grown truly massive, along with a small pocket of mankind.\n\nYou may notice that this premise sounds a bit outlandish even by Looney Tunes standards. The idea of Earth and its moon becoming locked in place, with there even being life on the latter, is patently scientifically implausible, which I suspect is why in Robert P. Mills’s introductory blurb for “Hothouse” he calls it “science fantasy.” It would be a fatal error to read Aldiss’s story as straight SF, as apparently James Blish did; but as I’ll get to in a moment, it’s not totally unfair to blame Blish for his dissatisfaction with “Hothouse”—not for the implausibility of the premise itself, but because Aldiss goes out of his way to try to make it sound plausible. The third-person narration often reads like a script for a nature documentary, albeit a bit more flowery (aha) than the usual. We meet a tribe of humans, comprised of adults and children (in the world of the story you basically stop being considered a child once you’re physically old enough to breed, which has its own implications…), and it only takes a couple pages for one of the children to get swallowed up by a massive plant akin to a Venus fly trap. “It is the way,” as the elders say. Life both is and is not cheap here; given the smallness of the tribe every life counts, but also there are more children than adults because not all the children are expected to make it to adulthood. Not so much safety in numbers as an insurance policy. There are more children than adults, but there are also more women than men. The adult women make the important decisions while the men are basically walking sperm banks; this could be construed as feminist if not for the fact that the humans are both deeply tied to tradition and have basically no rights to speak of. After all, civilization as we know it does not exist. It’s a tyrannical little tribe, functioning as it does for the “good” of the race, which after all could easily go extinct.\n\nHumans are so likely to be lost entirely to the vegetation or insects that rather than try to bury what can be retrieved the tribe does a burial rite for a fallen member’s “soul,” a doll “roughly carved of wood” that then stood in for the once-living person. After having done this for the child who’d been killed at the beginning of the story, the elders and the children of the tribe decide to part ways—the elders being old enough to “go up” and the children now being old enough to look after themselves. The life expectancy in this future world must be insanely short—like in the days of hunter-gatherer groups. It makes sense, now that the few humans left have become prey far more often than predator, and Aldiss is a mean-enough bastard that he’s not above killing off children or well-meaning characters. Even in this first story characters can die suddenly, so it’s best to not get too attached to anyone. Nevertheless, we do have characters with names, and possibly even personalities—although we don’t have much to go on there. We have a bit of an ensemble for this first story, but the closest we get to a protagonist would be Lily-yo, the matriarch of the tribe and the one who decides that maybe it would be for the best if she and a few fellow elders took a one-way ticket to the moon, along the traversers’ web, a journey which may or may not kill them. Only two males are left out of the children, Gren and Veggy, and as we can infer these humans really need their walking sperm banks. (I’ve read that Gren becomes an important character as the series goes on, but in this first story he’s little more than an accessory, and easy to forget about.) So of the adults going up we have Lily-yo, Haris, Flor, Jury, Daphe, and Hy. I may be forgetting someone, so sorry about that.\n\nWe have carnivorous plants, but we also have giant insects with the tigerflies, treebees, plantants, and termights. (Can you guess what the termights are supposed to be.) The insects feed off each other, the humans, and even the traversers. I know this is supposed to be unfathomably far in the future, but I have to wonder what could’ve happened to produce such a fucked up ecosystem as this; not only are basic physics out the window, but so is Darwinian evolution seemingly. And yet, a good chunk of the story’s word count is Aldiss explaining the dynamics of this ecosystem, as if it were not based on an already-implausible premise. Taken purely as science fiction it’s nonsensical, but it also fights against being taken as fantasy—at least fantasy as the genre was understood in 1961. The telling of the story is as if we’re being given a glimpse into the lives of future humans who actually bear little relation to us, and who have become almost like the animals you’d see in a nature documentary. When Lily-yo and company have gotten to the moon they find themselves mutates via solar radiation, and also find that Daphe and Hy did not survive the journey. It is the way. We’re given no insight into the thinking of these characters, such that they become purely kinetic beings, all living and dying on action, and so we’re not that emotionally invested when a few do inevitably kick the bucket. But there’s another side to this, in that Aldiss’s treatment of his characters is so heartless that it reinforces the cutthroat nature of this story’s world. It’s kill or be killed. When the surviving adults reach the moon they find they’ve become mutated, which would normally be a negative—only here it means they might’ve found an advantage over their nenemies. And maybe an ally.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThe traversers had constructed a passage to the moon, and brought life with them. “More thoroughly than another dominant species had once managed to do, the traversers colonised the moon.” I find it funny to think “Hothouse” takes place in the same universe as the real-world moon landing, although that wouldn’t happen for another eight years, not to mention the physics don’t line up at all. How would humanity have gotten to the moon with this story’s physics? With a really big slingshot? Anyway, the adults of the tribe find traversers, along with other plant life (yes, breathable air), on the moon, but they also find the flymen. It’s not obvious at first, but the flymen are in fact mutated humans, with angel-like wings that make them suited to the moon’s lighter gravity. Growing wings is one mutation made possible by solar radiation; there are mutations that are less useful. There are non-winged humans among the flymen called Captives who nonetheless serve an important function in this moon society, called “the True World.” But there’s still a problem: replenishing the human race. Age has something to do with it, but the likelier culprit for the lack of children on the moon is that the radiation tended to render the incoming humans impotent, “the rays that made their wings grow made their seed die,” so that the only practical solution is to retrieve more humans from Earth. The leader of the flymen, Band Appa Bondi, is one such human who had been spirited away to the moon as a child. Don’t get attached to him.\n\nAlso don’t get attached to Jury; she gets killed offscreen. It is the way. The climax of “Hothouse” sees Band Appa Bondi and the remainder of Lily-yo’s gang heading back to Earth to retrieve the children, only to be met with an army of tigerfly larvae—all of whom happen to be hungry, Band Appa Bondi gets killed unceremoniously in the battle and Our Heroes™ don’t even pay it a second thought. It’s hard to overstate how both outlandish and hardboiled this story is; it’s an odd but compelling combination. “Hothouse” very much ends on a sequel hook—not really a cliffhanger but as a sign of things to come. I remember Silverberg, in his Science Fiction: 101 anthology, had to evaluate “Hothouse” quite differently from the other stories included since it’s the only one that wasn’t written as a standalone; like sure, you could read it as a standalone, if you’re a little freak, but what’s the point in that. What’s the point of developing a fictional world as vividly (if outlandishly) as Aldiss does here and relegating that to a one-off story? What is this, Jack Vance? Aldiss is a good deal more cerebral than Vance. I like Aldiss, but I get the impression he knew he was the smartest person in the room nine times out of time, and I’m subconsciously envious of this as a certified dumbass. I sometimes get the impression Aldiss may be too smart for me. As such “Hothouse” may be the quintessential Aldiss story in that it leaves me evenly split between ambivalent and intrigued—both because I’m keenly aware he’s doing something unique, and he knows it too.\n\nIt is the way.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nI appreciate “Hothouse” a lot more on a reread, although I’m not sure I can say it’s “my thing.” It’s already a longish novelette, but it’s dense. It’s easy to see how a hardcore SF reader would be frustrated by it, but it’s also easy to see how in 1961 readers would’ve been impressed with it; it’s not quite New Wave, not least because it lacks any kind of psychological insight into its human characters, but it’s very much a stepping stone to the New Wave era. I also feel that despite sometimes being printed on its own that this is palpably the first entry in a series, as the ending shows, such that I feel like I won’t be honest with myself if I don’t cover “Nomansland” in a few months. Indeed “Nomansland” was already in the can when “Hothouse” was published, since Mills mentions having bought it in the introduction. This is not my favorite Aldiss, but it’s very much worth following.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nFritz Leiber has one of the most varied and compelling outputs of any SFF writer, and his influence on future generations is often easy to overlook by virtue of his versatility. There’s also the fact that while he would win two Hugos (actually three if we count the Retro Hugos) for Best Novel, he really was better at the short story, which is a form that usually doesn’t get you big sales and notoriety. Still, despite this as well as some personal-life issues (he had a recurring problem with alcoholism, which at a few points led him to give up writing for a time), Leiber was surely a legend. He’s an old favorite on this site. 1960 marked his 50th birthday, and by this point he had already won a Hugo for his short novel The Big Time, which in turn helped spawn an episodic series—not the first instance of a “time war” in SF, but certainly an early example with the Change War series. “The Oldest Soldier” is an entry in said series, although it can be understood perfectly as a standalone and indeed the term “Change War” isn’t even mentioned. More curiously this is an SF-horror hybrid, a fact I did not know beforehand, which thereby shows Leiber dabbling in the genre he was arguably best at: horror. Not gory horror or erotic horror, but a kind of bleak existential horror that could only come from someone who grew up in the city (in this case Chicago) and who seemed to fear it as much as he loved it.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the May 1960 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It was first reprinted in The Mind Spider and Other Stories, as one half of an Ace Double with The Big Time. For a more modern Leiber collection there’s Snakes & Spiders: The Definitive Change War Collection. For anthology appearances there’s Another World (ed. Gardner Dozois), Another Round at the Spaceport Bar (ed. Darrell Schweitzer and George H. Scithers), and Time Troopers (ed. Hank Davis and Christopher Ruocchio). It’s been reprinted more often than one would expect, given it’s good but definitely minor Leiber.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThe first stretch of the story might lead you to think what you’re reading will not even be SF. We’re in a bar (Sol’s) in Chicago, and it seems to be sometime in the 1950s—certainly after the Korean War. The protagonist/narrator is Fred, who might well be a stand-in for Leiber. The two have very similar backstories, with Fred explaining his upbringing in Chicago in the early 20th century and having pacifistic sentiments in his youths, although by the time of World War II that gave way to something more pragmatic. Fred and Leiber seem to be of the opinion that when fascism knocks that militarism may well be necessary, although Fred might’ve taken this to a more extreme degree than his creator did. He went from being a pacifist to becoming fixated on soldiering and military “honor,” which of course led to him reading a ton of military-related fiction, even early examples of military SF like “Heinlein’s space cadets and Bullard and other brave rangers of the spaceways.” Leiber does this thing where he acknowledges the existence of his own contemporaries in the worlds he creates (he does this most obnoxiously in The Wanderer), and he’s especially fond of name-dropping Robert Heinlein. It’s worth mentioning that Leiber and Heinlein were direct contemporaries (they even made their genre debuts the same year) and that they both very much admired each other, despite having very different politics. Leiber’s pandering to the genre SF readership can come off as self-serving at times, and I’d be lying if I didn’t also get that impression here; but at least it provides context for Fred’s behavior.\n\nFred decided to hang out with some war veterans who drink together at Sol’s, like it’s fucking Cheers. There’s even a guy named Woody! Woody, Mike, Pierre, “the Lieutenant,” and of course there’s Max, who is our second main character. Max is the titular oldest soldier—but it’s not because of his physical age. If you know about the Change War series in advance then you can infer right away that Max is a time soldier, someone who jumps back and forth in time, often to alter the past in subtle ways—which side he’s on is left unclear. Anyway, the Spiders and Snakes of the Change War are more or less interchangeable, both of them being morally rather ambivalent; that’s the point. Leiber doesn’t think very highly of war. Max is a curious character and how Fred writes about him shows a bit of a problem that can (and often does) arise from writing in the first person. See, at the beginning Fred calls Max a “screwball,” although he doesn’t really mean it as an insult. He even goes on a monologue about the appeal of screwballs, which I suspect is an opinion Leiber shares. The problem more is that he calls Max a guy “with a dream or gag,” which given that he’s writing with hindsight (he knows something about Max we don’t know yet) is an odd thing to say. Max is a bit weird, sure, but his claims about fighting with Martians in the distant future turn out to be probably true. Of course we as genre readers are basically preconditioned to take Max’s claims at face value, so to hear Fred contradict himself like this is jarring if one thinks about it. It’s a fallacy with first-person past-tense narration that’s so common that even old pros like Leiber fall for it. Anyway, it’s more a quip than anything.\n\nSo Fred and Max strike up an odd friendship wherein the former feeds into the latter’s tales of military exploits, the “time-and-space-soldier gag,” since at first Fred didn’t believe Max’s stories. Who would? But on walking to Max’s place one night Fred realizes… they’re being followed. Out of the corner of his eye he can see a black dog with flaming red eyes. The malicious dog is a motif that appears from time to time in Leiber’s horror fiction, and actually this isn’t even the first time on this site that I’ve reviewed such a story. In the case of “The Oldest Soldier” it’s much more unexpected, because, this being SF, we’re led to believe there wouldn’t be anything so mystical or Faustian as a black dog stalking Our Heroes™ on the street. They know they’re being followed, Max perhaps even more aware than Fred of this. Before we know it we’re halfway through the story, and it’s at this point that I have to confess something: this is a bit of a hard story to summarize. Not a great deal happens, but it’s hard to complain in the moment because, as tends to be the case, simply reading Leiber is a pleasure in itself. I have a few reasons for believing Fred is something of an author avatar, one of them being his way with language. Take this passage, for example, after Our Heroes™ have changed course and gone to Fred’s place, where Max is working on something that might get him out of this situation, Fred reflecting on his own unbelief in Max being a time-traveling soldier—an unbelief which in fact hid an intense belief in his friend’s stories:\n\nI realized fully then that my first skeptical thoughts had been the sheerest automatic escapism and that, just as I’d told Max, I believed with my whole mind in the black dog. I believed in the whole business insofar as I could imagine it. I believed that there are undreamed of powers warring in this universe. I believed that Max was a stranded time-traveller [sic] and that in my bedroom he was now frantically operating some unearthly device to signal for help from some unknown headquarters. I believed that the impossible and the deadly was loose in Chicago.\n\nFred’s language oscillates between a slangy, kind of Beatnik dialect, and a shocking capacity for poetic description that manages to avoid sounding overly flowery. Incidentally I refuse to believe Leiber wasn’t at least slightly influenced by the Beatnik movement in the late ’50s. Indeed the opening stretch of the story reads like it could be not SF but instead a literary type of story, about down-to-earth veterans taking comfort in each other’s company in the years following the Korean War. Max would not be the only eccentric veteran by any means. In this sense it’s a very of-its-time story, technically published in 1960 but culturally indicative of the ’50s, which after all did not actually end in any meaningful sense until maybe 1963. The world of “The Oldest Soldier” is decidedly pre-Vietnam, pre-hippies, pre-Beatles, but is also very much the same world in which Joseph Heller was writing Catch-22. You may notice this has a lot more to do with the atmosphere, heightened via Leiber’s prose, than with the actual plot, which on its own is rather simple, if also ambiguous since Fred is an outsider who’s only able to tell us what he’s able to understand. Which brings us to…\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nMax is able to escape whatever was following him, although Fred has no clue how this could’ve happened—at least at first. Max had given Fred a slip of paper that reveals writing on it only after the fact, through some method Fred can’t figure out (it may as well be magic to him), saying that thankfully Max did manage to vanish—into the past or the future is anyone’s guess. Something interesting about the climax is that while Max is working on his escape, Fred keeps watch and tries to ease his nerves by sitting at his typewriter, just outside Max’s room, and starts typing away—not anything coherent, but just phrases and passages that come to his mind, devoid of context. He’s not physically strong enough to fend off a black dog, but he can write. I have to think Leiber is trying to say something with this, that Fred is able to stall for Max and keep eye on him by doing the thing Leiber did for a living. If nothing else, you should write—even if it’s your suicide note. Someone said that, I forget who now. Fred being a writer is another thing that connects him to Leiber, and taking all this into account I have to think this might be—oddly enough—one of Leiber’s more autobiographical works. You get to know a good deal about Leiber if you read enough of his fiction: his penchant for drinking, his way with the ladies, his fondness for cats and chess, his aforementioned pandering to SF fandom which seems to come from a genuine place. You can find little cookie crumbs of Leiber’s inner life in his fiction—even in a story like this, which is little more than a mood piece, although average Leiber is pretty good by most writers’ standards. I enjoy average Leiber more than most authors.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nLike I said at the beginning, “The Oldest Soldier” is an unexpected hybrid, fusing the Change War continuity with a kind of urban terror Leiber had been cooking to perfection for about two decades at this point. We don’t talk about Leiber nearly enough, but we especially don’t talk enough about him as a horror writer. His skill for building a sense of dread is unparalleled when he’s on the ball. Actually I would say that between SF, fantasy, and horror, that he’s most consistent with that third genre. “The Oldest Soldier” is perhaps nominally SF (we don’t see any time machines or blasters), but the latter half is an effective urban thriller.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nDespite being in her fifties, Suzanne Palmer is part of the generation of SF writers to come about in the past decade and change, those whose work coincided with the expanding of the genre market online. (If you’re someone quite a bit older than me and anxious about starting a career in writing fiction, just know it’s not too late!) In Palmer’s case however she’s been a more frequent contributor to Asimov’s Science Fiction than any of the new outlets. She didn’t make her debut in Clarkesworld until 2017, with today’s story, but “The Secret Life of Bots” immediately struck a chord with readers as it would also win Palmer her first Hugo. It would even spawn a series of short stories starring the recommissioned robot Bot 9, all of which for some reason reference movies with their titles. This story is what you might call a comedic thriller crossed with a space opera; the stakes are high, but the lightness of character interactions keep it from becoming too serious. I don’t like it as much as readers clearly did at the time, but it’s an effective and undemanding read that’s sure to please the crowd.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the September 2017 issue of Clarkesworld, which you can read online. Despite being less than a decade old it’s been reprinted quite a few times (somehow I don’t have any of these reprints in my library), including The Best Science Fiction & Fantasy of the Year: Volume Twelve (ed. Jonathan Strahan), The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume 3 (ed. Neil Clarke), The Year’s Best Military & Adventure SF: Volume 4 (ed. David Afsharirad), and The New Voices of Science Fiction (ed. Hannu Rajaniemi and Jacob Weisman). The only major year’s-best anthology it did not make was the last entry in Gardner Dozois’s series.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nBot 9 wakes up, or rather is reactivated, after a long hiatus to find that business aboard the Ship (with a capital S) has gone really sideways in the interim.\n\nDust was omnipresent, and solid surfaces had a thin patina of anaerobic bacteria that had to have been undisturbed for years to spread as far as it had. Bulkheads were cracked, wall sections out of joint with one another, and corrosion had left holes nearly everywhere. Some appeared less natural than others.\n\nThere’s still a human crew, although not as many people as Bot 9 had expected, and of course there’s a whole army of bots of different classes who really do the work maintaining Ship: hullbots, silkbots, and so on. Ship, along with the bots it directs, is sentient, although it’s unclear just how sentient each of the bots is supposed to be. The bots are able to make complex decisions of their own accord, and even to go into “Improvisation,” but officially they’re to take orders from Ship, who then takes orders from the Captain. (The humans have names, but honestly it’s easy to forget they do and I’m not totally convinced Palmer should’ve bothered.) Ship is in quite the pickle, being on course to meet with a hostile alien ship, nicknamed Cannonball, which Ship is really in no condition to fight; and to make matters worse there’s some kind of alien creature aboard Ship that’s been wreaking havoc, called “the Incidental,” although Bot 9 posits a more accurate name would be “Snake-Earwig-Weasel.” Ship is quite literally falling apart and so are some of the bots, including a damaged hullbot named 4340 whom Bot 9 helps out and quickly befriends.\n\nShip and the bots often come off as more human than the actual humans, which might be the intention, although while reading this story my mind couldn’t help but trail off and ponder stupid questions, such as: “So if the bots are sentient, does this mean humanity has reintroduced non-prison slave labor in the future? Are the bots slaves?” The humans become a good deal less sympathetic if we’re to believe they knowingly invented sentient life, only to enslave it, though I might be too harsh on this. (Actually it’s impossible to be too harsh on the institution of slavery, but understand that this whole line of thought with the bots-as-slaves is meant to be taken semi-jokingly.) Ship and the bots tell us repeatedly they exist “to serve,” and obviously this blind servitude is set up to be subverted later in the story. Bot 9, being outdated and not even included in the newfangled “botnet” the other bots take part in (direct communication, like telepathy), starts out as an outsider; but it’s this status as outsider that may prove to be an asset, as Bot 9, for all its jank, has a surprising capacity for ingenuity. If we’re to take the bots as analogous to humans then Bot 9 reads as elderly/disabled, being released into a society of mostly abled-bodied members, who has to and ultimately does prove its worth despite the odds. This is potentially a can of worms, but on the bright side it’s refreshing to read SF where robots are explicitly not gendered, even if Ship is very much coded as feminine (motherly, patient, a foil to the bullish humans).\n\nThe mix of adventure and humor would very much appeal to readers, but another thing I couldn’t help but notice is that if you remove the occasional salty language you could have feasibly published this story in the ’40s. This is a Campbellian narrative to the extent that the humans, while at times irrational and helpless (not to mention slavers), are ultimately shown to have the best intentions, and ultimately the bots stay loyal to the interests of their human masters. After all, they’re all on Ship together; the humans’ problem will inevitably also be the bots’ problem. But also the bots, while charming and shown to be perfectly capable of making their own decisions, are less prone to rebellion or existential crises than Asimov’s own robots. Human and bot must collaborate in order to take care of the small problem of the Incidental and then the much larger problem of Cannonball. And of course the alien race is written as totally unknowable and hostile to human interests—capable of thinking as well as a man but certainly not like a man. This town ain’t big enough for the two of us. Diplomacy is impossible. The solution thus is that one side or the other must be annihilated. In a way the story’s view of contact between humanity and alien life is no more sophisticated (and no less hawkish) than Fredric Brown’s “Arena,” the only substantial difference being that Palmer’s story isn’t subliminally racist against the Japanese. I really like Brown’s story, for the record; you can find something problematic while also enjoying it. We’re all adults here.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThe big twist, admittedly, is a pretty effective one, helped by it also being perfectly logical. Ship is not equipped to take on an alien warship—at least not with the expectation of succumbing in the battle. A kamikaze attack might just work, though, if it holds off the aliens from invading Earth. During all this there’s been a McGuffin called a “Zero Kelvin Sock” which, if Ship can get close enough to Cannonball, basically acts as a fusion bomb which will destroy both ships. The humans have come to this decision and Ship is prohibited from objecting, but the bots have a different plan in mind which could save all of them while still making use of the device. Of course the plan ends up working, with Bot 9’s direction, which technically involves the bots committing mutiny (going against the Captain’s orders). The Captain wants Bot 9 destroyed for having led the mutiny, even though its plan saved the goddamn ship, but… the Captain doesn’t know what Bot 9 looks like, and there are some out-of-commission bots that could serve perfectly well as the “corpse.” You know how it is. Personally if someone wanted me executed for doing what is objectively the right thing then I would hold a mighty grudge against that person, but while the bots can think of themselves they seem to lack a sense of Old Testament-type justice. But, the point being we get our happy ending, which if you know about the sequels then you could’ve already guessed that in advance.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nIt’s cute, but ultimately frivolous. It’s very much the sort of crowd-pleasing story that would win a Hugo, but if I can put my cynicism aside for a second I have to admit I was entertained. Sometimes you need a short story that’s challenging and layered, and which can be picked apart, but other times you need a story that’s perfectly unchallenging.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nJoyce Carol Oates is the kind of author who quite possibly would never have appeared in the genre magazines if not for F&SF, what with its classy exterior and appeal with non-genre writers. Indeed Oates is one of the most celebrated living non-genre writers, having won the National Book Award for her novel them, as well as the O. Henry Award multiple times for her short fiction. More relevant to this blog is that a surprisingly large portion of her output is horror, especially at short length. She’s been nominated for the Bram Stoker Award multiple times and even won the Stoker for her non-supernatural horror novel Zombie. Even perhaps her most controversial novel, Blonde, whilst ostensibly historical fiction, could be classified as horror. She’s one of only two female contributors to the seminal horror anthology Dark Forces. “In Shock” is one of Oates’s horror short stories, and is arguably supernatural, although it doesn’t so much delve into the supernatural as strongly allude to it.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the June 2000 issue of F&SF, which is on the Archive. Despite getting a Stoker nomination, this story doesn’t seem to have been reprinted anywhere, at least if ISFDB is being accurate; with a mostly non-genre author like Oates it can be hard to tell.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nRachael is a divorcee in her mid-thirties who has lost a husband as well as a child. She got married to L_ (we’re only told the first letter of his name, as seems to be the case with all the men in Rachael’s life) and got pregnant when she was about 25, which in those days was not unusual. Unfortunately Rachael miscarried some months into her pregnancy and her relationship with L_ deteriorated—not that their relationship would’ve necessarily worked out had the child lived. Anyway, it’s been about a decade since then and she at least tries to think she’s moved on from all that. “She was a poet and a translator and she traveled a good deal and she’d ceased grieving for what was lost, and irretrievable, as she’d ceased being a woman, a wife, a mother-to-be.” Despite the third-person narration telling us Rachael had moved on, this is pretty obviously not true; if anything her past trauma seems to be the only thing she’s capable of thinking about, if dips into her stream of consciousness are anything to go by. Stream-of-consciousness narration is a pretty unusual technique in the realm of genre fiction, but it’s something Oates has a penchant for; more specifically it very much reads as Modernist in the Faulkner mode, in that we have italicized and unpunctuated bursts of thought that come and go without warning. The result is a bodyless and relatively sober narrator clashing with a delirious internal monologue. Get ready for a lot of sentence fragments.\n\nThis is essentially a story about a woman who’s become trapped in her own past. Rachael’s sense of identity has been stripped by her trauma to the point where she doesn’t even perceive herself as really a woman (a kind of insecurity that’s sadly a real-life phenomenon for women who have had miscarriages), such that her gender becomes almost arbitrary. The irony is that because she has lost so much faith in her value as a woman her gender has become a fixation; she doesn’t believe in her own womanhood, yet can’t stop thinking about it. This all comes to a head when she sees a preteen boy bicycling in the wake of a storm, the boy narrowly avoiding crashing because of tree debris, and she sees the boy about to bike over a pole wire that’s been knocked out, such that if the boy made contact with it he could be electrocuted and killed. Rachael stops this would-be accident, but in the process is electrocuted herself and knocked unconscious. She’s taken to the hospital where she’s told she’s lucky to be in alive, only coming out of it with some bruises and a case of shock. She’s told she had gone into shock, but the symptoms should wear off. Little does she know these symptoms are about to get much worse. The most disconcerting thing is that she asks hospital staff if there was a boy at the scene, only to be told there was no boy and no bike; yet she’s convinced she must’ve seen him. It was such a vivid sight, yet nobody who was around recalls there being a boy.\n\nThere are a few plausible options here, although Oates doesn’t give us an easy answer that would indicate any of them. It’s possible that Rachael had experienced a vivid visual hallucination and had imagined the boy; that the boy is a ghost, maybe even a manifestation of the Rachael’s unborn child (the boy is about as old as the child would’ve been); or that Rachael really did see a boy, save him, but then died in the process, in which case we have a nightmarish afterlife scenario. At the very least the boy is obviously meant to represent the child Rachael had lost symbolically. The accident is also undoubtedly a turning point in Rachael’s life, since she’s recovering from shock and the world around her seems to have gotten stranger since before the accident. Her trauma, which previously was kept internal, has been driven into the outside world, either literally or as a result of her mental illness. She meets up with some elderly neighbors of hers, the Chathams, asking if they’d seen the boy that day, and of course Mrs. Chatham says she didn’t. Mr. Chatham is an invalid, groaning loudly in another room, but Mrs. Chatham ignores this, as if her husband were not casually in pain. “How was it possible that Mrs. Chatham didn’t hear him?” Even by the standards of the elderly, Mrs. Chatham is an odd one, in that she’s oddly detached from everything. She might be a manifestation of what Rachael could become in a few decades: a jaded old lady.\n\n(Safe to say that despite having just turned 86 [happy birthday] Oates is very much not jaded. Have you seen her Twitter?)\n\n“In Shock” starts as realistic, if also Modernist and Faulkneresque as mentioned before, but after the accident it takes a sharp turn towards the mythological. On top of the mystery of the boy Rachael can’t stop thinking about Greek mythology, especially Hades and Cerberus, that three-headed hound who gatekept the underworld. This is what I mean by the story alluding to the supernatural without every unambiguously entering that territory, because of course we never see Hades or enter that gate which Cerberus is protecting; but what we do get is the next best thing. Modern industry, coal and electricity, become symbols of a kind of underworld in the wake of Rachael’s accident, such that she starts imagining herself as living in a kind of purgatory. She’s also into comparative literature and said to be very well-read (not that L_ gave her credit for it), so it makes sense that she would turn to literature as a way of coping with her trauma. There’s another character, Morris B_ (often called just B_), an older man and a professor of antiquity whom Rachael very much likes, possibly even loves. Despite having known each other for years they never entered a relationship, in what you might call a near miss. When they meet again following the accident Rachael is reluctant to tell B_ what had happened to her, and is also repulsed by what she now realizes is his aging body, his skin “appeared finely cracked like the glaze of ancient pottery, and a starburst of a lurid red birthmark was newly visible through his thinning hair.” She almost can’t stand the sight of him. What should be a nice reunion, to take her mind off what she’s just been through, has become rotten.\n\nA possible point of inspiration for this story, although it’s never brought up in the text and I can’t even guarantee Oates has seen it, is the cult horror movie Carnival of Souls. Indeed “In Shock” almost feels like a remake of that movie, although I can’t guarantee this is the case and in all likelihood there’s no correspondence between the two. For those of you who aren’t into micro-budget indie horror movies from the ’60s, Carnival of Souls is about a woman who goes joy-riding with her friends when their car falls off a bridge and she emerges as the sole survivor. She moves, takes up playing the organ for local churches, gets a new apartment, but finds that ghosts are now following her seemingly everywhere she goes. We get many stories about places that are haunted, but only rarely do we get people who are haunted. Rachael, like the doomed heroine of Carnival of Souls, is herself haunted—by symbols if not actual ghosts. She meets up with a friend, Thea, who of course is also an academic, along with Thea’s daughter Cecie, who is also Rachael’s goddaughter. The meeting goes horribly wrong when Rachael sees (or thinks she sees) horrific scars on Cecie’s neck and is understandably (at least from her perspective) panicked about this, only for Thea to deny the scars are even there and kick Rachael out of the house. The true horror of this scene lies not in the child’s possible injury but in Rachael experiencing that which every person living with mental illness must endure: not being believed. The supernatural is more symbolic than literal, a stand-in for some sort of mental distress, like the seemingly unkillable dog in Faulkner’s “The Hound” being a stand-in for the protagonist’s guilt.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThis is a hard story to spoil since it ends inconclusively; any of semblance of a plot sort of evaporates by the end of it. This is not exactly a negative criticism. I’m not sure how you’re supposed to end this kind of story without giving an answer that would inevitably undermine the mysteriousness of it. Why do you think David Lynch presented us a mystery in Mulholland Drive and then proceeded to never solve it? Joyce probably doesn’t intend for us to solve the mystery but rather to give us an experience—a glimpse into the mind of someone following a near-death experience. I know what that’s like. In March this year I had an accident wherein I seemed to have choked on peanut butter (of all things) and passed out in the kitchen. My throat had cleared but I lost consciousness and landed flat on my face. I must’ve been out for only a minute or less but I had these dreams that were horribly vivid, and which seemed to last much longer than the allotted time. I was driven to the ER and spent a few hours there, where doctors found that aside from the injury to my face (pretty nearly lost a tooth there) and very low blood pressure I was fine to go home. I was, of course, also delirious. I remember almost nothing from that night. I don’t even remember being driven to the ER. I feel like I’ve not been quite the same since then. But then who is, after something like that. It’s that transformative state, of being violently thrown out of normalcy, that the story captures.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nSorry if this seemed less like a review and more like an autobiographical tangent, but for what it’s worth I think Oates would approve of the digressions; after all, they do somewhat relate to the story. Sometimes the story is not really the point; sometimes what matters more is what you bring to the story. Again, apologies I missed this month’s editorial, but luckily I already know what I’ll be writing about next month so keep an eye out for that. As for the Oates, it’s an evocative short story that straddles the line between the psychological and the supernatural, understandably inspiring the Rob Alexander cover for that issue of F&SF. I do sometimes get the impression with Oates’s writing that it can be experimental for the sake of itself, but that’s not the case here.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nDespite having lived an incredibly long life (she was born in 1925 and died in 2019), Katherine MacLean wasn’t the most prolific of writers. She only wrote five novels, only two of which are solo efforts, and one of those is a fix-up. On the short fiction front she didn’t write a whole lot more, although she did have a streak in the ’50s; about half her short fiction was published that decade. MacLean was one of the few lady writers to appear regularly in Astounding (she even debuted there), but like a lot of other writers she hopped on the Galaxy bandwagon, appearing in that magazine’s first issue. “Pictures Don’t Lie” is a prototypical Galaxy-type story, and not unlike another early Galaxy story I reviewed recently, Philip K. Dick’s “The Defenders,” it’s founded on a Big Twist™. Unlike Dick’s story, however, MacLean’s remains effective even when taking the twist into account. Also like the Dick it was adapted for radio as an X Minus One episode, and has even been adapted elsewhere, including an EC Comics adaptation. It’s one of her most reprinted stories for a good reason.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the August 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction, which is on the Archive. It was reprinted in Invaders of Earth (ed. Groff Conklin), The Great SF Stories #13 (ed. Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg), The PRentice Hall Anthology of Science Fiction and Fantasy (ed. Garyn G. Roberts), as well as the MacLean collection The Diploids. It’s also fallen out of copyright and is on Project Gutenberg.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nJoseph R. Nathen is a radio decoder for the American military, which during the Cold War would mean having a job that could potentially involve the difference between a frozen conflict and a hot one. But Nathen has found something a lot more incredible than signals from the other side of the Iron Curtain: he’s found signals of non-human intelligent life. “Squawking,” as he calls it, which needs to be slowed down, but the squawking is certainly not human, yet at the same time can be understood. Radio gives way to TV and it didn’t take long for Nathen to get a TV signal of the alien ship. He wanted pictures. “Pictures are understandable in any language,” he says. Nathen ends up being right about this—but also tragically wrong. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. There are only three real characters in this story: Nathen, a journalist named Jacob Luke who’s mostly referred to as the Times man (which Times?), and Nathen’s correspondent on the alien ship, nicknamed Bud. There are a few other characters, mostly journalists who are only called by the outlets they work for (the Herald, the News, and so on), and the dialogue is almost entirely expositional; good thing Nathen is fluent in Expositionese. If this story has a flaw that would turn some readers off it’s that it seems in love with its own attempts at explaining its premise—so dense in exposition as to be hard to digest.\n\n(The X Minus One adaptation does a pretty good job of streamlining the narrative, by giving us a solid viewpoint character [with the Times man] but also massively dialing back the scientific explanation for how the humans and aliens are able to communicate.)\n\nNathen had used the TV line to send the aliens the Rite of Spring segment of Fantasia, which the aliens not only received in a couple weeks but apparently enjoyed. At first this sounds like a match made in heaven with regards to first contacts: the aliens are not only able to respond back but can communicate, and according to Nathen their planet is “Earth-like.” The aliens seem to be humanoid, and the Earth team is able to receive TV images of the aliens on the ship. The question then remains: What could go wrong? There are a few warning signs, but the humans are unable to make heads or tails of what these abnormalities could mean. For one, the aliens move at a deliriously fast speed. “Something about the way they move…” As Nathen explains, while the images themselves are clear, the speed at which these images are relayed is hard to gauge. “When I turn the tape faster, they’re all rushing, and you begin to wonder why their clothes don’t stream behind them, why the doors close so quickly and yet you can’t hear them slam, why things fall so fast. If I turn it slower, they all seem to be swimming.” Something isn’t right. But still, the aliens intend to land on Earth, right outside the military base where the story’s happening—and soon.\n\nThe twist of this story is telegraphed pretty hard, but only with hindsight. I had the good fortune of not knowing the twist beforehand, so I was left with the genuine question of what the catch is—because there has to be a catch with a story like this. MacLean is clever here in that she turns the screw at just the right pace so that if you’re fast enough you can anticipate the twist, but there’s a good chance you won’t; but then you might reread the story and give yourself a pat on the back for taking note of what now reads as obvious foreshadowing. The title is ironic. It borders on postmodern—not in literary technique, obviously, but in how it shows that objective reality, or rather our notion of it, can be untrustworthy. Our perception of reality is based on our senses. The humans and aliens have differently calibrated perceptions and as such they don’t perceive the same space in the same way. When the alien ship comes to Earth the humans don’t see any sign of it by the landing pad, and Bud says the ship can’t see the humans anywhere despite surely having landed on Earth. The atmosphere, Bud says, is too thick—much thicker and soupier than Nathen said. The humans posit that the aliens might’ve landed on Venus by accident (this was when Venus was thought of as a gaseous swamp and not a hellworld), but this can’t be the case. Something has gone wrong, but they don’t know what.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nThe aliens are on Earth alright, and they’re even somewhere near the landing zone—but the humans can’t see the aliens. Bud says that the ship has come under attack and that the humans have to find the ship fast if there’s hope of saving them. It’s there that Nathen and the Times man realize the missing piece of the puzzle—and at the same time realize it’s probably too late to save the ship. It’s one of those great “we’re fucked” moments in old-timey SF, a real sense of having passed the point of no return, like locking your doors after your house has already been robbed, or realizing that one girl you liked had a crush on you as well and you only realize this years after the fact. MacLean gives us a real zinger of a final line, which encapsulates the bizarre tragedy of the situation, for why the humans can’t see the ship—at least not with the naked eye: “We’ll need a magnifying glass for that.” The aliens move at such an odd speed and the atmosphere around them is so thick because they are, in fact, microscopic. The pictures didn’t lie, but they didn’t tell the whole story either. The humans thought they had made contact with likeminded aliens when in fact they were giants who had made contact with beings even smaller than ants, and neither side could figure this out until it was too late. This is how you do a twist ending.\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\n“Pictures Don’t Lie” is basically a tragedy, not caused by technology but aided by it. Even by the early ’50s there’ve been a ton of first contact narratives, such that it would take a bit of ingenuity to write a story of this type that’s truly memorable. MacLean was still very young, and early in her career at this point, but she did have that touch of ingenuity. More impressively t’s a story that raises questions about the utility of the brand-spanking-new technology called television, about how such technology might contribute to first contact with aliens—and how even with this new tech something could go wrong. It’s also a question of size and perspective. We always imagine aliens like how they appear in Star Trek, humanoids that happen to be the same size as humans. MacLean posits we might find life on another planet—or possibly in a grain of sand.\n\nSee you next time.\n\nWho Goes There?\n\nI don’t often get the chance to talk about authors not totally embedded in the realm of genre SF, which makes someone like Jonathan Lethem a bit of a treat. Lethem is nowadays known as a “literary” writer, with non-SF works like Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude gaining him a foothold in the literary crowd, if not exactly the mainstream. But unlike some other writers who started out writing genre who then tried distancing themselves from genre trappings, Lethem never forgot his roots. Indeed for someone who’s not primarily known as an SF writer, at least half of Lethem’s novels are SF, including his first four novels. He’s also unabashedly a Philip K. Dick fan, even going to far as to edit Dick’s Exegesis for book publication. Today’s story was published the same year as Lethem’s debut novel, Gun, with Occasional Music, and like that novel it wears its Dick influence on its sleeve—not in a bad way, of course.\n\nPlacing Coordinates\n\nFirst published in the Spring 1994 issue of Crank!, which is on the Archive. It’s been reprinted only once, in the anthology The Best of Crank! (ed. Bryan Cholfin). Much of Lethem’s short fiction has not been collected outside of anthologies, so this is not unusual.\n\nEnhancing Image\n\nThis is a cautionary tales of sorts, about a salesman and an artist. The salesman is Pete Flost, and he sells robotic puppets to schoolkids. After school the kids swarm out like bugs and Flost, along with the competition, stands by with his trunk of merchandise. The puppets sell for very cheap, since they’re aimed at children—but that’s not where the money comes from. “Clients paid Desani and Sons large figures to equip the puppets with advertising programs, aimed at the buyers’ parents.” Flost works for Desani and Sons, who in turn work for advertisers. When in doubt, turn to ads. Flost has a digital wristband telling him his bank information; so do the kids. (Where do they get their money from? I would assume allowance.) The kids, like their adult counterparts, are fickle; they’re quickly learning how to think in a capitalist environment. Much to Flost’s dismay the turnout for his merchandise is underwhelming, and to make matters worse he then has to pay a ticket for speeding. Tellingly we’re not even told Flost’s name for the first few pages; he’s just “the salesman,” and indeed he’ll mostly be called that throughout the story. He’s a salesman down on his luck, and as a cog in the machine he’s not much more than that.\n\nWe cut to the artist, Zigmund Figment, who’s kind of a fraud, or as we say in a post-Hans Zimmer post-James Patterson post-Drake world, someone who makes art… with some uncredited help. That’s not the point. The irony is that despite being a salesman who sells “banal commercial narrative dolls” for a living, Flost is not a cynic; he means well. Meanwhile Figment is ruthlessly cynical—opportunistic, sure, but he also has open contempt for his own customers. It’s during a heated discussion with one of these customers that a random idea pops into Figment’s head: that he could make a killing selling something as cheap as disposable as those dolls. “There could be something there.” The dolls, acting alive but being non-sentient, are characters with their own programmed narratives, set to deactivate permanently after a 24-hour cycle. But suppose the character of one of these dolls was based on a person? And that’s how Figment comes into contact with Desani and Sons, and more specifically how he teams up with Flost—to use the salesman’s likeness for a doll Figment has in mind. The puppet salesman will serve as the basis for a salesman puppet.\n\nOn the one hand, this is a very Philip K. Dick story; it’s the kind of story he might’ve written had he lived through the Reagan years. I don’t mean this as a bad thing, even if it does smack of derivativeness. Lethem would move away from this heightened satirical brand of SF as he got older, and it’s not hard to see why; but also in some ways (though it pains me to say this as a fellow Dickhead) Lethem is a better writer than Dick. His sentences are less stilted and he’s able to pack almost a novel’s worth of detail into just a few pages, such that you could probably write a whole short story about just the dolls, but here they’re merely an accessory to the larger narrative. Dick was arguably the greatest critic of American capitalism among genre SF writers in his time, and Lethem continues this ruthlessness by presenting a shadowy and greedy landscape that lacks any semblance of spirituality—a film noir world without a detective. Flost is by no means a hero, but then Figment isn’t what you’d call a villain either; he’s merely a business-minded fellow who wants to take advantage of the system he was born into. He’s disgusted with the system (and with himself, really) but feels he has no power to change it. When Flost asks him why he’d wanna make a salesman puppet, Figment replies, “I’m looking for a medium that metaphorizes the temporal, presold, infantilizing, reflexive qualities of contemporary artistic expression, my own especially.” He knows it’s all a game.\n\n“Mood Bender” is loose on plot but tight on character and substance; what it lacks in cohesion of events it makes up for in the density of its world and the sheer existential dread of its characters. Figment is a scumbag, casually rude to restaurant staff so he can get a discount, that sort of thing, but he’s also the man with the vision. That Figment is the assertive one of the two while Flost is weak-willed (a bit of a Willy Loman figure) speaks bleakly of both of them. Being an “artist” but not someone who wants to put in all the hours of work and solitude to make his art, Figment also hooks up with Ben Iffman, a friend of Flost’s and a designer for the puppets. “It wasn’t that Iffman’s designs necessarily sold more than anyone else’s, but handling them meant something to the salesman.” The problem is that this arrangement ends up working too well. Iffman catches on to Figment’s idea so fast he starts selling his puppets to the same clientele before Figment’s own plan can come to fruition. Without Iffman, and with his sales declining, Flost loses his job at Desani and Sons (although they don’t word it like that), and Figment for his troubles gets beat at his own game. As is typical of Lethem, the best laid plans of mice and men come to naught.\n\nThere Be Spoilers Here\n\nLethem asks a scary question: Are we somehow product? And if we’re product then does that mean we can be replaced? On his last day with Desani and Sons Flost is treated more like faulty machinery than a flesh-and-blood person who has to pay rent. Figment, who really always treated his art as both product and extensions of himself, gets what you might call his just desserts when people stop buying his shit. In the last stretch of the story, after both men have fallen from grace and been relegated to vagrancy, we see a robot priest—not sentient, but merely a machine that spouts pre-programmed platitudes. We have killed God—not with philosophy or even with machinery, but with dollars. The world in-story is in very bad shape. The only real refuge from this might be cold sleep, which curiously serves a similar function in Gun, with Occasional Music, as a kind of debtor’s prison. Run out of money and struggling to find a job? How about you slip into a coma. By the end of the story we’ve come back to the place we started at, with the schoolkids, only now Flost and Figment are drunkards poking fun at their own dashed hopes of success. Did I mention this is bleak?\n\nA Step Farther Out\n\nThis is a good enough story that Lethem could’ve sold it to a higher-paying market—but then how many outlets published post-cyberpunk material like this in 1994? Lethem appeared in Asimov’s several times, but not in this case. Omni was on its way out. Interzone is British. There weren’t many markets for short SF at the time, which might be one reason Lethem hasn’t written much short SF; and when it came to novels he would eventually get to writing non-SF work, although the noir aspect very much remained. “Mood Bender” is short but brutal; it’s at times funny, but it’s by no means light reading. If you’re reading this then you’ve probably already ready some Lethem, but if not then it’s a good place to start.\n\nSee you next time."
