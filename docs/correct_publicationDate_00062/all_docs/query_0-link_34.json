        "text": "dated scifi\n\nThe premise for this book struck me as potentially very interesting but I'm afraid for me it reads more as a very, very dated scifi story. It's almost like an alternate history scifi novel but stuck in a pre-moon-landing era where rocket ships are cones with three legs and people still weren't even sure what the moon would be like. The author seems to strive to base things in science but it winds up stuck in late 50's speculation.\n\nI'd recommend passing on this book and sticking with the more imaginative and less dated works by Heinlein or Niven.\n\nto bad\n\ndont bother boring over written in detail that don't make any differance to what little plot there is. the reading is realy bad and makes the whole thing hart to follow\n\nDated and dull\n\nWould you try another book from Fritz Leiber and/or Norman Deitz?\n\nThe narrator was fine, and I've enjoyed other works by Lieber, but I'll be cautious.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nThere's a scene in the middle that almost made me throw my ipod out the car window. It's more-or-less a military rape, given the power dynamic between the two characters involved, with bonus mutual asphyxiation, while the waters rise, leading to their inevitable death by drowning. Yes, it's as horrid as that sounds, if not worse.\n\nBefore that, there are obnoxious potheads who don't die nearly fast enough, and the token Vietnamese character, whose sole purpose in this book is to show that the events are affecting the whole world.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the alien catwoman..."
