        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nThe Fantasy Book is a very nice history of fantasy. It is gorgeously illustrated and entertainingly written. The author is a German citizen and he throws in some great information about European weird fiction writers that are probably unfamiliar to an American audience. The introduction starts by quoting H. P. Lovecraft’s classic essay, Supernatural Horror in Literature. “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear.” Rottensteiner quibbles with this a bit but goes on to give a nice talk about the attraction of horror fiction to audiences of the past and why horror fiction remains popular today.\n\nThe first chapter details the Gothic origins of the genre. The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole (1717-1797) is considered the first weird novel. It is “melodramatic, laboured and unbelievable, […] and yet it was to be the first of a whole group of novels, the Gothic school.” The Gothic novel was very popular and eventually became the subject of parody. Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey (1818) is one famous parody. Next up was the oriental fantasy. William Beckford (1760-1844), a very wealthy but jaded fellow wrote the popular novel, Vathek. It is about a very wealthy but jaded fellow who indulges his wickedness in adventure after adventure finally resulting in his heart being eternally circled by living fire.\n\nAnother oriental fantasy recommended by the author, is by a Polish Count named Jan Potocki (1761-1815), called The Saragossa Manuscript. This novel while seemingly about the supernatural concludes with non-supernatural explanations for the preceding events. Potocki killed himself with a silver bullet he had fashioned for the occasion. The Saragossa Manuscript was made into a film in 1965. The film captures the essence of the novel (stories embedded in stories) but changes the ending to a supernatural one. Rottensteiner goes on to discuss the gothic novels of Ann Radcliffe (1764-1823) and the popular novel The Monk by Gregory Matthew Lewis (1775-1817). The Monk had graphic sexual descriptions and later editions were censored.\n\nThe most famous gothic horror novel is discussed next. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1797-1851) remains popular today. One of the author’s favorite gothic novels is Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Robert Maturin (1780-1824). Melmoth has sold his soul to the devil for a prolonged life. He is looking for someone to take his place so he shows up in prisons, insane asylums, and battlefields looking to swap places with someone.\n\nAmerica enters the picture with the work of Charles Brockden Brown (1771-1810), a little known author who is considered the first American novelist. More successful was the work of Washington Irving (1783-1859). Praise is given to the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) whose novels The House of the Seven Gables and The Marble Faun contain a small supernatural element.\n\nThe second chapter deals with the author’s favorite writer, E. T. A. Hoffman (1776-1822). One of the few writers to have an opera written about him, Jacques Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffman. The Devil’s Elixirs is given as a superlative example of Hoffman’s work.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is discussed next. Poe, according to the author, was a “master diagnostician of abnormal mental states.” Poe’s short stories such as The Tell-Tale Heart certainly prove this point. Rottensteiner tells an interesting story about Poe’s literary executor, Rufus W. Griswold. Griswold wrote a biography of Poe that “distorted the facts of Poe’s life, depicting his subject as an ingrate, a wanton libertine, and a hopeless drunkard.” Some Poe admirers were pleased with this dark portrait, feeling it explained some of the power in Poe’s work.\n\nThe author also discusses Russian author, Nicolai Gogol. Gogol’s The Overcoat (1842) is considered a masterwork of weird fiction. The fantasy work of other Russian writers such as Pushkin, Lermontov, and Tolstoy are also mentioned.\n\nThe third chapter deals with vampires, werewolves, and ghosts. The Vampyre by William Polodori (1795-1821) is considered the first vampire novel. Polodori was Lord Byron’s personal physician and during Polodori’s lifetime it was often assumed that Byron was the real author of the novel. J. Sheridan LeFanu (1814-1873) gave the vampire story a lesbian undertone in the story, Carmilla. Of course, the most famous vampire is Dracula by Bram Stoker (1837-1912). The vampire remains popular today, most successfully in the novels by Anne Rice and Stephenie Meyer. Werewolf novels are few. There have been short stories about were-wolfs, were-bears, and even were-cats. The author’s pick of best were-wolf novel is a fairly modern one, Guy Endore’s The Werewolf of Paris (1933). A discussion on the Jewish roots of the Golem comes next. The golem is usually attributed to High Rabbi Loew of Prague (c.1512-1609). Many golem stories, poems, and films exist. Marvel Comics recently published a story where “The Thing” character in the Fantastic Four comic book is declared to be Jewish. A rabbi considers the Thing a sort of golem.\n\nThe fourth chapter is about British horror novelists. Primary among them is J. Sheridan LeFanu who was mentioned above. Le Fanu’s stories are considered classics in the genre. Stories like Green Tea, and Carmilla are reprinted continuously. Le Fanu is also credited with creating the first “psychic detective” with his stories featuring Dr. Hesselius. Other British horror writers include Wilkie Collins (1824-1889), Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873), Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894). Stevenson, of course, was an accomplished novelist in several genres. Treasure Island is the premiere pirate novel and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is the premiere novel of split personality. M. R. James (1862-1936) is the author’s pick for the English ghost story. Oliver Onions (1873-1961) is also mentioned as a contender. William Hope Hodgson is discussed and complimented for his “sea-stories” The Boats of the ‘Glen Carrig’ (1907) and The Ghost Pirates (1909). More writers are mentioned, specifically, Walter de la Mare, Arthur Machen, and Algernon Blackwood. Algernon Blackwood’s Dr John Silence stories are given praise over Le Fanu’s Dr. Hesselius, Hodgson’s Carnacki, and Seabury Quinn’s Jules de Grandin. Arthur Machen probably had the most influence on American horror writers of the pulp era. The Great God Pan influenced H. P. Lovecraft and Machen’s stories of “the little people” influenced Robert E. Howard.\n\nThe fifth chapter brings us back to the USA. After Edgar Allan Poe the most famous and respected horror writer was probably Ambrose Bierce (1842 – ?). His An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge is a classic. Other American horror writers of that period are Robert W. Chambers (1865-1933) remembered for his The King in Yellow stories, and F. Marion Crawford (1854-1909). Crawford was very popular at the turn of the century but is barely remembered today.\n\nSupplanting, perhaps even Poe, as the quintessential American horror writer is H. P. Lovecraft (1890-1937). Lovecraft slowly gained a huge following and respect in literary circles. During his lifetime he was a favorite among the readers and writers of Weird Tales. Weird Tales was the premiere horror pulp. Regularly contributing writers to Weird Tales were Henry S. Whitehead (1882-1932), Seabury Quinn, Clark Ashton Smith (1893-1961) and Robert E. Howard (1906-1936). Rottensteiner considers Smith to be a pseudo-orientalist. He uses the fact that Smith added new episodes to Beckford’s Vathek to support this claim.\n\nRottensteiner says this about Howard, “While Howard had an undeniable gift for vivid, if crude, description, most of his stories, especially those about Conan (who has long since become a cult figure), rely heavily upon coincidence, and soon degenerate into carnage, with supernatural creatures providing just another class of foe to be slain. Nevertheless, sometimes Howard did come up with some impressive fiends.”\n\nFor Rottensteiner, Weird Tales main claim for posterity is the fact that the bulk of Lovecraft’s work was published there. When Lovecraft died, his friends, fans, and correspondents mourned his death. There is no telling what would have happened with his literary legacy if not for the work of author August Derleth (1909-1971). August Derleth and Donald Wandrei formed Arkham House after Derleth’s attempts to get a Lovecraft book published by Scribner’s and Simon and Schuster failed. Arkham continued to publish numerous other horror titles reprinting some British authors as well as other Weird Tales authors like Clark Ashton Smith (1893-1961) and Robert E. Howard (1906-1936). Lovecraft’s main claim to fame is “The Cthulhu Mythos.” A series of stories based around the idea that fearsome gods called the “Great Old Ones” want to rule the earth once more. Modern writers like J. Ramsey Campbell, Brian Lumley, and Stephen King have all added on to the mythos.\n\nThe sixth chapter brings us away from horror and back to fantasy. Rottensteiner starts with William Morris (1834-1896) but backtracks to George MacDonald (1824-1905). Rottensteiner gives the nod to Morris as being “the originator of that form of the fantastic which is typically set in an imaginary, quasi-medieval world.” Mention is also made of Baron Dunsuny, Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett (1878-1957). Eric Rucker Eddison (1881-1945) is mentioned for his The Worm Ouroboros. Fletcher Pratt for his The Well of the Unicorn. All of the above mentioned authors were represented in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series as edited by fantasy author Lin Carter in the 1970’s. Rottensteiner quotes L. Sprague de Camp as the authority on Sword & Sorcery, “the name of a class of stories laid, not in the world as it was or will be, but as it ought to have been to make a good story.” Rottensteiner gives Robert E. Howard the nod as the true creator of sword & sorcery. Rottensteiner gives a somewhat back-handed compliment to Howard, “the Conan stories of Howard’s imitators lack the crude vigour of the original.” When this book was written, sword & sorcery ruled the paperback market. Michael Moorcock, Fritz Leiber, L. Sprague de Camp, and Jack Vance are all mentioned as writers of this type.\n\nRottensteiner is not much of a fan of this type of fiction. He says de Camp has “qualities of real wit” in his The Goblin Tower and The Clocks of Iraz but opines that “a type of fiction which aims at nothing more than entertainment usually fails even in that objective.” Rottensteiner goes on to discuss J. R. R. Tolkien (1892-1971). “One of the chief attractions of the trilogy is Tolkien’s ability to conjure up this fully realized other world […].” Rottensteiner bows out of making an assessment of Tolkien’s literary merits by stating that “trilogy’s success at a mass level has made a real assessment difficult.” This statement is even truer today. Tolkein is undoubtedly the most successful fantasist ever. Frodo rules.\n\nThe seventh chapter deals with fantasy and popular fiction. Henry Rider Haggard (1856-1925) is given his due for King Solomon’s Mines and She. Abraham Merrit (1884-1943) is mentioned as well. Talbot Mundy (1879-1940) is praised as a better writer than Haggard although he never achieved Haggard’s level of popularity. Fantasy thrillers get mentioned next. Arthur Sarsfield Ward (1883-1959) better known as Sax Rohmer gets mentioned for his Fu Manchu novels. Dennis Wheatley (1897-1977) is also praised.\n\nThe eighth chapter goes back to Lewis Carroll for a discussion of whimsical fantasy. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898) was the author of Alice in Wonderland. Dodgson was a completely different fellow when around little girls. He told his made-up stories to 10 year old Alice Liddell and her two sisters. He wrote the stories down and published them under the name Lewis Carroll in 1865. Other fantasy authors are mentioned: Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories, Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind in the Willows, A. A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh, Beatrix Potter’s The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and L. Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz. Ursula K. Le Guin is mentioned for her Earthsea trilogy. Fantasy and humor come next. Thomas Anstey Guthrie (1856-1934) wrote Vice Versa in which a father and schoolboy change identities. This was modernized and made into a movie with Judge Reinhold after the success of Tom Hank’s “Big.” Oscar Wilde is also mentioned for his humorous fantasies. James Branch Cabell (1879-1945) is singled out for Jurgen. G. K. Chesterton (1874-1936) for The Man Who Was Thursday. T. H. White’s (1906-1964) The Once and Future King is mentioned as well. The pulp magazine Unknown Worlds is singled out for its emphasis on humor. The stable of writers were L. Ron Hubbard (later the creator of his own religion, Scientology), Theodore Sturgeon, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague De Camp. Rottensteiner opines that while Unknown Worlds published some fine writing that after a while, “the jokes wear thin, the cliché’s of pulp literature are too often in evidence, and the logical paradoxes often seem simplistic compared with Carroll’s.”\n\nThe ninth chapter deals with fantasy literature that tries to be allegorical. C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) is mentioned for his Christian inspired novels as well as his Narnia series. Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis is trotted out as a classic. Mervyn Peake’s (1911-1968) Gormenghast trilogy is thoroughly reviewed.\n\nThe tenth chapter deals with non-English authors. Latin American magical realism is mentioned as are authors: Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, Jorge Luis Borges short stories, as well as numerous others. French author Balzac is mentioned as writing a sequel to Melmoth the Wanderer. Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893) is a master of the short story, some of which were fantasy. German, Austrian and other European authors are also mentioned.\n\nThe last chapter deals with modern fantasy (up to 1978). Anne Rice is singled out for her Interview with the Vampire (1976). Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont are singled out for praise. Science fiction authors Brian Aldiss and James Blish are mentioned for their crossover works. Robert Bloch is mentioned for Psycho and Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper but Rottensteiner prefers Ray Bradbury, Theodore Sturgeon, Fritz Leiber, and even Harlan Ellison (to a point.)\n\nAll in all this was a nice overview of horror and fantasy. The book is superbly illustrated and attractively laid out. It is a book to keep.\n\nRottensteiner is a pretty unimaginative voice though. He routinely praises the classics and denigrates work that falls into pop culture. His opinions seem safe and uninspired. His voice is a seemingly calculated one designed to appeal to already established literary thinking. One never gets the sense of a truly original thinker.\n\nby Gary Romeo\n\nOne of the most persistent opinions that gets stated as fact is that L. Sprague de Camp hurt Robert E. Howard’s literary reputation. There is never any explanation what this really means or any supporting facts. Just a blunt opinion presented as if it was a fact.\n\nThe first critical book review of REH published in the U. S. was titled, “Superman on a Psychotic Bender.” There will be more on this later. Suffice to say that outside of the pulp/fantasy/science fiction circle this was REH’s literary reputation.\n\nThis was about a decade before Sprague.\n\nDuring REH’s lifetime I think it is safe to say most pulp publishers and readers recognized his name and considered him a reliable provider of good stories. You can read letters in those magazines praising his stories along with the occasional criticism. The most famous probably being Robert Bloch’s letter in the November 1934 Weird Tales.\n\n“I am awfully tired of poor old Conan the Cluck, who for the past 15 issues has every month slain a new wizard, tackled a new monster, come to a violent and sudden end that was averted (incredibly enough!) in just the nick of time and won a new girlfriend […] whose penchants for nudism won her a place of honor […] on the cover.”\n\nBut praise outweighed the criticism. REH stories were still rejected from time to time but he had reliable markets. The depression made some of those markets, Weird Tales especially, unreliable slow paying venues.\n\nUpon his death he definitely received praise from peers, publishers, and the Fantasy/Science Fiction community. The August 1936 issue of The Phantagraph featured a REH poem and a remembrance (probably) by Donald Wollheim:\n\n“[…]Mr. Howard was likewise outside weird fiction. His prizefight stories were a standby of many sports magazines, while numerous vivid Orientales [sic] embodied very forcibly his peculiar skill in describing scenes of battle. During the past year he had begun to put his own native scenes in fiction – a sound tendency which would probably have led to his development as a serious regional author.”\n\nThe September 1936 issue of Fantasy Magazine had an article “In Memoriam Robert Ervin Howard” with remembrances by H. P. Lovecraft, Otis Adelbert Kline, E. Hoffman Price and Jack Byrne. Lovecraft says it best in the first paragraph:\n\n“The sudden and unexpected death on June 11 of Robert Ervin Howard, author of fantastic tales of incomparable vividness, forms weird fiction’s worst loss since the passing of Henry S. Whitehead four years ago.”\n\nSoon after REH’s passing came H. P. Lovecraft’s. August Derleth, the Apostle Paul of HPL, recognized the impermanence of pulp and began collecting the better Weird Tales writers in hardcover. Hosannas and sacraments are due this man. Some modern day HPL fans are as dismissive of Derleth’s graces as some modern day REH fans are of de Camp’s.\n\nSkull-face and Others was the first stateside REH hardback and published by Arkham House. August Derleth, in his introduction, alluded to the violence of REH’s stories jokingly saying Conan should be printed on blood red pages. Derleth also included introductory pieces by HPL and E. Hoffman Price. Some REH fans say Price poisoned the well here by giving his opinionated views on REH.\n\nIn any event the book was reviewed in the New York Times Book Review, September 29, 1945. If anyone is unfamiliar with this it is more a review of action heroes in general than the REH stories. H. R. Hays, the author of the review gives a backhanded compliment before going on his judgmental diatribe:\n\n“The stories are written on a competent pulp level (a higher level, by the way, than that of some of the best sellers) and are allied to the Superman genre which pours forth in countless comic books and radio serials.”\n\n“Thus the hero literature of the pulps and the comics is symptomatic of a profound contradiction. On the one hand it is testimony to insecurity and apprehension, and on the other it is a degraded echo of the epic. But the ancient hero story was a glorification of significant elements in the culture that produced it. Mr. Howard’s heroes project the immature fantasy of a split mind and logically pave the way to schizophrenia.”\n\nThe review is more or less the equivalent of the schoolteacher who tore up the comic book that you were reading during class and saying this stuff will rot your brain. Derleth anticipated negative reviews in his introduction, “[…] a reviewer recently brushed aside a book of supernatural tales as being, after all, “only pulp fiction.”\n\nSad to say this was probably the prevalent view throughout literary and everyday society until very recently. REH never really had a chance.\n\nThe book was positively reviewed in Fantasy Review, February 1947, by Arthur F. Hillman.\n\n“Out of the 14 [Conan] stories which appeared originally in Weird Tales, only five have selected for this anthology by the productive Mr. Derleth. But he […] seems to have prepared his defense in advance of this criticism. His argument is that too many of Conan’s exploits, taken together, would sicken the reader with the total butchery and carnage involved.”\n\nIt makes sense to me that people who just lived through WW2 were sensitive to violence used as entertainment. Criticism of pulp fiction, comic books, movies, and television was the oxygen being breathed.\n\nThe next hardcover book came from fellow REH fans as well. John D. Clark and P. Schuyler Miller were correspondents of REH. Clark remembered his love of Conan and Gnome Press’s Conan the Conqueror saw the light of day.\n\nSprague, of course, read this book, becoming a lifelong fan of REH, and as Michael Moorcock noted in Conan the Phenomenon, his primary popularizer for decades.\n\nFantasy and Science Fiction were not so clearly delineated in the 1950’s. But in that community science fiction was given a clear edge. Progress was in the air. Science was idolized. The Race to Space. During this time several literary studies promoting F/SF were done. Arguably the most influential were by Sam Moskowitz, Damon Knight, and William Atheling Jr. (James Blish). Moskowitz’s books were overviews of the genre and focused on popular writers. Knight and Blish emulated the mainstream in that they were highly critical of certain authors who didn’t meet their ideal of what science fiction should be.\n\nDamon Knight was a fairly influential reviewer and can honestly be said to have established and tarnished the literary reputations of some authors at the time. Here is his take on REH in In Search of Wonder:\n\n“The Coming of Conan, by Robert E. Howard, is of interest to Howard enthusiasts, who will treasure it no matter what anyone says, and to students who may find it, as I do, an intriguing companion piece to L. Sprague de Camp’s The Tritonian Ring. Howard’s tales lack the de Camp verisimilitude but they have something de Camp’s stories lack: a vividness, a color, a dream-dust sparkle, even when they are insulting to the rational mind.”\n\nThis isn’t too much different than Hays’s view. Just a bit more appreciative of Howard’s style.\n\nSam Moskowitz discusses H. P. Lovecraft as an SF writer in Explorers of the Infinite with a name check of REH as co-author of “The Challenge From Beyond.” Moskowitz’s Seekers of Tomorrow has a chapter on L. Sprague de Camp so there are also a few mentions of REH:\n\n“When he [de Camp] was told on November 30, 1951, in a telephone conversation with Donald A. Wollheim, that a box of Howard’s unpublished manuscripts were at the home of literary agent Oscar J. Friend, de Camp virtually took possession of them. He proceeded to revise and edit Howard’s unpublished work, readying it for the printed page. […] For his efforts he was elected on November 12, 1955, Royal Chronicler of the Hyborian Legion.”\n\nDe Camp detractors will seize upon that “possession of them” remark but will ignore that de Camp was lauded by the premiere REH fans at the time. The Hyborian Legion was, in short, something like REHupa (Robert E. Howard United Press Association), just with more professional writers. These were the most dedicated REH fans of their day.\n\nTheir publication was Amra.\n\nAmra started in 1956. And it was the first attempt at making REH a serious topic of discussion. Despite constant assertions that serious views of REH started later, Amra was the first. Amra started in 1956 and there were articles of depth.\n\nThe writers in Amra, fans of REH, guys like George Scithers, Fritz Leiber, Poul Anderson, Sprague de Camp, et. al. were promoting REH and singing his praises. Making direct contentions against the slams of the critics of the day. Classic articles of depth include Fritz Leiber on “Howard’s Style,” George Scithers’s “Balthus of Cross Plains,” Poul Anderson on “The Art of Robert Ervin Howard,” L. Sprague de Camp on “Howard and the Races,” and Glenn Lord’s “A Gent From Cross Plains.”\n\nThen came the Lancer Books Conan paperbacks and later the Marvel Comics. Those Frank Frazetta covers. A complete saga. Conan art by Barry Windsor Smith. Conan on film. Conan was being taken seriously as a commercial property if nothing else. Thanks to de Camp, Howard was being read.\n\nIn the millions.\n\nThe whole tenor of the 60’s was challenging the status quo. Rethinking how we treat minorities, when and how we should go to war, how women should be treated in the workplace, even what we eat, and what gender we have sex with. It all started changing then.\n\nThe mainstream media and literary circles resisted the full-scale acceptance of popular culture as art as long as they could. But come the late 1970s the popularity of Star Wars ended that. When a pop-culture sci-fi property is a billion-dollar industry, opinion changes. Pretty much anything that is popular (money making) is respectable. There are college papers about the Transformers these days.\n\nDuring de Camp’s tenure with REH, REH’s harshest critics focused on promoting violence as a solution and associating him with fascism. This was never a de Campian view.\n\nCritic Sam Lundwall wrote a popular book Science Fiction: What it’s All About? He quotes de Camp’s defense of Sword-and-Sorcery and his stress on the genre’s entertainment value. Lundwall states:\n\n“After having delivered this unabashed praise to escapism, de Camp goes on to note the renewed interest in Heroic Fantasy and in this respect he is undoubtedly right. Old classics are reissued by the score together with new stories of blood, thunder and well-sharpened swords. The spectrum goes from the gentle novels of James Branch Cabell to the sadistic tales of Robert E. Howard… however, looking at the state of the world — the real world — today, I can well believe there are some deeper reasons too. There was a similar interest in heroes and mighty deeds in Hitler’s Germany.”\n\nLundwall is clearly stating that his opinion is different, by a large degree, than de Camp’s. De Camp’s view is that it is all good escapism. Lundwall is making an argument that the violent nature is not just escapism. Lundwall is saying REH is dangerous fascist-inducing stuff. So saying that this critic is influenced by de Camp is clearly wrong.\n\nLater, Lundwall again quotes de Camp to disagree: “[Sword-and-Sorcery provides] the reader with a heroic model with whom he for a moment can identify himself.” Lundwall’s rebuttal: “As far as entertainment goes, I can’t see anything wrong with this. Though I still dislike the over-emphasis on violence.”\n\nFranz Rottensteiner is another case. His The Fantasy Book quotes another de Camp defense of Sword-and-Sorcery. Rottensteiner follows the de Camp quote with this dismissive statement:\n\n“Apologists of this kind of entertainment trace its development back through Eric Rucker Eddison and Lord Dunsany to William Morris […]. But in fact it is not even the debilitated offspring of these sagas, but rather a misbegotten child of our own technological civilization, offering a quick escape from an oppressive world.”\n\nRottensteiner, like Lundwall, is disagreeing with de Camp to a large degree. De Camp never talked about fascist underpinnings or escaping from an “oppressive world,” just a mundane one. These guys have their own axes to grind that are clearly different from de Camp’s views.\n\nStephen King is no de Campian-influenced fan of the genre either. King in Danse Macabre says: “This kind of fiction, commonly called ‘sword & sorcery’ by its fans, is not fantasy at its lowest, but it still has a tacky feel.”\n\nSo Howard’s critics were still at the Hays level. Little had changed from 1945. Clearly de Camp is not the problem with REH’s literary reputation.\n\nAmra, The Howard Collector, The Dark Man, and The Cimmerian along with fans writing on the internet have changed perceptions to some degree. Positive reviews of REH are easily found on the web and publishers are willing to print positive literary studies since there is a fan base to buy them.\n\nHoward is still not wholly accepted. There is still too much violence and oftentimes a little (at least perceived) sexism and racism, Howard is still having a rough row. But no one can seriously blame that on de Camp.\n\nThe success of the Lancers, the comic books, and the movies made REH and Conan part of popular culture. De Camp set all this in motion."
