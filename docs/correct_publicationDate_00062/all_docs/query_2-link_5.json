        "text": "Lesson Text\n\nTranslation\n\nOften the wanderer prays for favor, God's mercy, although sorrowful he long had to stir with his hands the frosty sea across the water-way, travel paths of exile: fate is utterly inexorable. Thus said the wanderer mindful of hardships, of cruel carnage, of the deaths of dear kinsmen:\n\n\"Often I must bewail my sorrows alone every morning: none is now alive to whom I dare plainly speak my mind. I in truth know that it is a noble custom in a warrior, that he bind his heart fast, reserve his inner thoughts, think as he will. The spirit-weary may not avoid destiny nor the troubled mind offer aid: therefore (those) eager for renown often bury sadness deep in their hearts. So often, miserable, deprived of home, far from kinsmen, I had to bind my spirit in shackles, since years ago (I) covered my lord in the darkness of the earth and I, wretched, went away sorrowful over the band of the waves, sadly sought a hall, a giver of riches, where far or near I might find him who knew my mind in the mead hall, or would comfort me, friendless, treat (me) with kindness. He knows who seeks how cruel is grief as a comrade to him who himself has a small number of dear friends: the path of exile preoccupies him, not twisted gold, a cold body, not the life of earth; he thinks of retainers and receipt of treasure, how in youth his lord entertained him at feast: joy utterly perished. ...\"\n\nGrammar\n\n36 The n-stem Weak Nouns\n\nOnly a handful of nouns behave like the masculine frēa 'lord' in the table below; none of the others appear in our lesson texts.\n\nn-stems Masc. Fem. Neut. Masc. Nom.Sg. nama 'name' sunne 'sun' ēage 'eye' frēa 'lord' Gen.Sg. naman sunnan ēagan frēan Dat.Sg. naman sunnan ēagan frēan Acc.Sg. naman sunnan ēage frēan Nom.Pl. naman sunnan ēagan frēan Gen.Pl. namena sunnena ēagena frēana Dat.Pl. namum sunnum ēagum frēaum Acc.Pl. naman sunnan ēagan frēan\n\nSpelling Notes\n\nThe forms of nam- are also spelled nom-. The dative plural frēaum is also spelled frēam. The genitive plural ending -ena may also be spelled -ana, -ona, or -una, or it may be reduced to -na or -a; the endings -an may be spelled -on.\n\n37 Feminine Abstract Nouns in -u, -o\n\nFew nouns belong to this class, and their forms are so variable that they may be classified as \"indeclinable\" in dictionaries. Frequently, a single form is used for all cases except the genitive/dative plurals, which end in -a and -um respectively; that other form, however, may end in -u in some sources, or -o in others; sometimes the nominative/accusative plural ends in -e or -a. The following table serves only as a partial sketch, as the term indeclinable cannot be ignored: forms are selected to illustrate variability rather than suggest a non-existent \"inflectional pattern,\" and spelling notes are accordingly irrelevant.\n\nFem. Abstracts 'pride' 'strength' Nom.Sg. wlencu strengð Gen.Sg. wlenco strenge Dat.Sg. wlence strengu Acc.Sg. wlenco strengðo Nom.Pl. wlenca strengðe Gen.Pl. wlencea strenga Dat.Pl. wlencum strengðum Acc.Pl. wlencu strengu\n\n38 The r-stem Nouns\n\nThese nouns indicate relationships (father, mother, brother, sister, daughter).\n\nr-stems Masc. Fem. Masc. Fem. Fem. Nom.Sg. fæder 'father' mōdor 'mother' brōðor 'brother' sweostor 'sister' dohtor 'daughter' Gen.Sg. fæder mōdor brōðor sweostor dohtor Dat.Sg. fæder mēder brēðer sweostor dohtor Acc.Sg. fæder mōdor brōðor sweostor dohtor Nom.Pl. fæderas mōdru brōðor sweostor dohtor Gen.Pl. fædera mōdra brōðra sweostra dohtra Dat.Pl. fæderum mōdrum brōðrum sweostrum dohtrum Acc.Pl. fæderas mōdru brōðor sweostor dohtor\n\nSpelling Notes\n\nThe genitive singular fæder may be spelled fæderes or fædres; the -e- in the plural forms of fæder is optional. All nominative singular forms ending in -or may be spelled with the ending -ur or -er instead. Umlaut may be applied to the genitive singular mōdor to yield mēder; the nominative/accusative plurals mōdru may be spelled mōdra. The nominative/accusative plurals brōðor may be spelled brōðru. The nominative/accusative plurals sweostor, dohtor may be spelled sweostru or sweostra, dohtru or dohtra. The genitive/dative singulars dohtor may be spelled dehter. Collective plurals of brōðor, sweostor have a prefix ge- (e.g. gebrōðor, gesweostor).\n\n39 The nd-stem Nouns\n\nThese masculine nouns are derived from present participle forms of verbs. In addition to forms shown below, our lesson texts include forms of wīgend 'warrior' and scieppend 'creator', which are declined like nergend and wealdend.\n\nnd-stems Masc. Masc. Masc. Nom.Sg. frēond 'friend' nergend 'savior' wealdend 'ruler' Gen.Sg. frēondes nergendes wealdendes Dat.Sg. frēonde nergende wealdende Acc.Sg. frēond nergend wealdend Nom.Pl. frēondas nergendas wealdendas Gen.Pl. frēonda nergendra wealdendra Dat.Pl. frēondum nergendum wealdendum Acc.Pl. frēondas nergendas wealdendas\n\nSpelling Notes\n\nThe dative singular frēonde may be spelled frīend; the nominative/accusative plurals frēondas may be spelled frīend or frēond. The nominative/accusative plurals nergendas, wealdendas may be spelled nergend or nergende, wealdend or wealdende. Forms of wealdend- may be spelled waldend-. (And forms of scieppend- may be spelled scyppend-.)\n\n40 The er-stem Nouns\n\nThe nouns in this declension are all neuter; however, by OE times most of the er-stems had migrated to other declensions, even if this required a change of gender. Few remained, and none of them appear in our lesson texts.\n\ner-stems Neut. Neut. Neut. Nom.Sg. ǣg 'egg' cealf 'calf' lomb 'lamb' Gen.Sg. ǣges cealfes lombes Dat.Sg. ǣge cealfe lombe Acc.Sg. ǣg cealf lomb Nom.Pl. ǣgru cealfru lombru Gen.Pl. ǣgra cealfra lombra Dat.Pl. ǣgrum cealfrum lombrum Acc.Pl. ǣgru cealfru lombru\n\nSpelling Notes\n\nThe forms of lomb- can also be spelled lamb-. The nominative/accusative plurals lombru may be spelled lomber or lomb; in accordance with the last the genitive plural may be spelled lomba, and the dative plural, lombum."
