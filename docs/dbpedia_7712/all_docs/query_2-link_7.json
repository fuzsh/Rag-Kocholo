        "text": "Crazy credits, spoilers, re-used animation and other trivia about Antz.\n\nCrazy Credits[]\n\nThe Z in Antz is slightly crooked, and its also the name of the title character.\n\nA child's hand holding a magnifying glass brings into focus the tiny names of the cast.\n\nSpoilers[]\n\nDuring the flooding scene, no ants were drowned, because the animators thought it was too cruel.\n\nZ gets saved twice from death by two ants, first Barbatus saves him from being eaten by a termite, second was Cutter, who saves him from drowning near the end, basically redeeming himself in doing so.\n\nThe setting of the movie is Central Park in the city of New York in the state of New York (the most filmed public park on record).\n\nOther trivia[]\n\nThe reason why the movie has a PG rating is because of casual swearing, an unusual thing to hear in an animated film. This is often omitted whenever the film is shown on TV.\n\nAnts and termites really do go to war with each other. But in reality, ants would emerge the victors, because they would easily outnumber a termite nest.\n\nSome of the characters are named after types of ants: Bala is the name that people in Costa Rica give to bullet ants (\"Paraponera clavata\" species), Barbatus is named after \"Pogonomyrmex barbatus\" (red harvester ant) species, Azteca is named after \"Azteca andreae\" species, Weaver is named after weaver or green ant (genus Oecophylla), and Cutter is named after leaf-cutter ants (genera Atta and Acromyrmex). Also, General Mandible is named after mandibles - ant jaws.\n\nIn the scene at the bar, Z says he doesn't drink from the anus of another creature. In the trailer, the word \"anus\" is replaced with \"caboose\".\n\nThis originally was also done by Steven Spielberg as the executive producer, but he was uncredited.\n\nThis is Jeffrey Katzenberg's first project that is not from Disney.\n\nIn July 2014, the film's distribution rights were purchased by DreamWorks Animation and transferred to 20th Century Fox.\n\nThis is the first DreamWorks Animation film to not feature any humans, followed by Shark Tale.\n\nThis is the first DreamWorks Animation film to be released in October.\n\nThis is the first DreamWorks Animation releases two films in the same year, while the other film is The Prince of Egypt.\n\nThis is the first DreamWorks Animation's non-sequel/prequel film.\n\n60,000 ants made up General Mandible's army.\n\nOne of the motivational signs in the ant colony, \"Free Time Is For Training\", is a real motivational sign at PDI DreamWorks.\n\nIn the original development, the ants had six limbs, some of them wore clothes, gloves, and lightbulbs appeared whenever they had an idea. None of these made it into the finished film. Also, General Mandible looked more visibly sinister in early drafts, but they toned it down for the final result.\n\nThis is the first feature film by DreamWorks Animation.\n\nThis is the first DreamWorks Animation's computer animated film, followed by Thomas The Great Discovery and Shrek.\n\nThis is the first computer animated film by Pacific Data Images, followed by Shrek.\n\nThis is the first DreamWorks Animation film that streamed on Netflix.\n\nWoody Allen recorded his part as \"Z\" in only five days.\n\nBala was a lot nastier in the early days of defining the character. Sharon Stone's reading helped to change that, by balancing sass with spoiled, without ever becoming too bratty.\n\nThis is the first DreamWorks Animation film to use profanity, followed by The Road to El Dorado and Shrek; as the word \"cripple\" is said once (referring to a handicapped person) and God's name is used in vain twice. This is another reason for the film's PG rating."
