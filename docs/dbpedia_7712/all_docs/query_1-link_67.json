        "text": "Ants also have two antennae they use to recognize their nest mates and detect enemies.\n\nWhen ants find food they emit pheromones that provide scent trails so their nest mates can find the food.\n\nAnts also have maxillary palps which detect scents.\n\nAnts use their powerful mandibles to grasp and carry, as well as for cutting and biting.\n\nThe ant's six legs are attached to the thorax.The abdomen contains the ant's vital organs and reproductive parts. This is also called the gaster. Ants in the formicinae subfamily have an acidopore to emit formic acid when threatened.\n\nAnts do not breathe like we do. They take in oxygen through tiny holes all over the body called spiracles. They emit carbon dioxide through these same holes. The heart is a long tube that pumps colorless blood from the head throughout the body and then back up to the head again. The nervous system of ants consists of a long nerve cord that also runs from head to rear with branches leading to the parts of the body, kind of like a human spinal cord.\n\nAn ant has a petiole connecting the thorax to the abdomen. The petiole can be one or two segments. This feature is used to identify ant subfamilies."
