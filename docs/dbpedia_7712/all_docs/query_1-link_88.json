        "text": "According to Pixar Animation’s Steve Jobs and John Lasseter (who’s now leaving Disney after allegations of misconduct), they pitched Disney the concept before Katzenberg left the company.\n\n“There’s no disputing the fact that the day Jeffrey left Disney, he knew we were making ‘A Bug’s Life’; he knew what the story was and everything else,” Jobs told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nOf course, Katzenberg has always denied this, as BB points out:\n\nthe Los Angeles Times reported that film producer Nina Jacobson, a former DreamWorks executive and later president of Disney subsidiary Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, said she was the one who pitched the ants idea to Katzenberg.\n\nBRADLEY, SAVE US.\n\nStill, DreamWorks’ buggy story has a fly in the ointment.\n\nTHANKS.\n\nAccording to a BusinessWeek story, Lasseter pitched “A Bug’s Life” to Disney on the very same day that the company announced Katzenberg’s departure. So, sure, it’s possible that Katzenberg hadn’t known about the idea when he was a Disney employee. But Lasseter allegedly told Katzenberg “all about ‘Bugs’” when the Pixar creator visited him at the DreamWorks offices in 1995 ― and that it was set to hit theaters in Thanksgiving of ’98.\n\nHere’s where it gets really interesting. That BusinessWeek story came out in 1998, and it’s got some wild claims. It basically confirms that Disney was considering a “bug” movie all the way since the late 80s, and the ants vs. grasshoppers structure of A Bug’s Life was pitched by Andrew Stanton (who would later direct Finding Nemo) and Joe Ranft (one of Pixar’s founding writers and co-directors who sadly passed away in 2005). The writeup also laughably points out that for a while, Katzenberg apparently loved Pixar, even though he had beef with Disney.\n\nSure, Jan.\n\nThat said, the appearance of friendliness on Katzenberg’s part has always been a decent explanation for why Lasseter let himself blab about A Bug’s Life to a competitor.\n\nFrom the BusinessWeek story:\n\nLasseter does say, however, that he smelled a rat when he began reading about Dreamworks’ Antz project in trade magazines. He claims he called Katzenberg and said: “Jeffrey, how could you?” He claims Katzenberg “hemmed and hawed,” and then admitted he was making Antz. “I couldn’t believe it,” says Lasseter. “He started talking about all this paranoid stuff about conspiracies — that Disney was out to get him…. He said he had to do something. That’s when I realized, it wasn’t about me. We [Pixar] were just cannon fodder in his fight with Disney.”\n\nNow, we’ve known about this betrayal for a long time. In some ways, it paved the way for some of the most contentious rivalries between animation studios in regards to the best ideas coming out first. So, what new information is BB here to illuminate?\n\nScheduling was always the crux of the problem between Disney and DreamWorks. “The Prince of Egypt” was reportedly originally supposed to be DreamWorks’ first big animated film, its crown jewel after Katzenberg’s exit from Disney. The movie was scheduled to come out during the holiday season of 1998 ― same as “A Bug’s Life.”\n\nWell, there can be miracles. When you believe.\n\nA bunch of rumors claim that Katzenberg was upset about Antz coming out a year after A Bug’s Life, and even more upset that Prince of Egypt would compete directly with the Pixar movie (I’d be worried, too, after the success of Toy Story).\n\nthe date for “A Bug’s Life” remained firm. The Disney-Pixar alliance wasn’t budging. So DreamWorks reportedly moved up the release date for “Antz,” ensuring that it would debut weeks before the “Bug’s Life” premiere of Nov. 25.\n\nI’ve always found this decision to just release an animated movie 12 months ahead of time…suspect. And BB apparently agrees. We might just have receipts!\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost this month, “Antz” writer Weitz cast doubt on these alleged machinations. According to him, the original ’99 release date was “fake.” His team was working at hyper-speed to get “Antz” out early the whole time.\n\nWait. What.\n\n“We didn’t know that there was that much of a race [to the box office] until late in the process,” he explained, “when it turned out there had even been a fake schedule, which had us completing after ‘Bug’s Life’ was going to be released. We’d been working on this accelerated pace without really knowing exactly why.”\n\nWait. What.\n\nSomeone in Hollywood lied?\n\nLooking back on the rivalry, Weitz said, “I think there was something inherently more crowd-pleasing about ‘Bug’s Life,’ which would’ve kind of blown us out of the water if we hadn’t gotten out there first. And as it happens, we were able to coexist, which is really nice.”\n\nThey weren’t going to release Antz in 1999 the whole time?!\n\nNext you’re going to tell me DreamWorks is making another Shrek movie.\n\nGod of Prince of Egypt help us.\n\nSorry you had to read this.
