        "text": "Antz is a 1998 computer-animated film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures, centering on a nonconformist worker ant who switches places with a soldier ant, in the process uncovering a plot to destroy the colony.\n\nDirected by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. Written by Paul Weitz, Chris Weitz and Todd Alcott.\n\nEvery ant has his day. (taglines)\n\nZ\n\n[edit]\n\n[first lines] All my life, I've lived and worked in the big city, which now that I think of it, is kind of a problem since I always feel uncomfortable around crowds. I mean it, I-I have this fear of enclosed spaces. I-I-I, everything makes me feel trapped all the time. You know, I always tell myself, there's gotta be something better out there, but maybe I think too much. I-I-I think everything must go back to the fact that I had a very anxious childhood. You know, my, my mother never had time for me. You know, when you're - when you're the middle child in a family of five million, you don't get any attention. I mean, how's it possible? And I've always had these, these abandonment issues, which plagued me. My father was basically a drone like I've said, and, you know, the guy flew away when I was just a larva. And my job, don't get me started on, 'cause it really annoys me. I was not cut out to be a worker, I'll tell you right now. I-I-I feel physically inadequate. I, I, my whole life I've never, I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own body weight, and, and when you get down to it, handling dirt is, you know, ew, is not my idea of a rewarding career. It's this whole gung-ho super-organism thing that, that, that I - you know, I can't get, I try but I can't get it. I mean, you know what is it, I'm supposed to do everything for the colony, and, and what about my needs? What about me? I mean, I gotta believe there's someplace out there that's better than this! Otherwise, I'll just curl up in a larval position and weep! The whole system makes me feel - insignificant!\n\nWill you please calm down? You won't let a little near-death experience ruin your mood, are you?\n\n[last lines] There you have it. Your average 'boy-meets-girl, boy-likes-girl, boy-changes-underlying-social-order' story. So, what else can I tell you? We rebuilt the colony - it's even better than before, you know, 'cause now it has a very large indoor swimming pool. Bala and I, incidentally, are thinking of starting a family. You know, just a few kids, maybe a million or two to begin with. And I'm, I'm workin' with a new therapist, you know, terrific, absolutely terrific. He's, he's been putting me in touch with my inner maggot, which is helping me a great deal. And, you know, I finally feel like I found my place, and you know what? It's right back where I started. But the difference is, this time I chose it.\n\nMandible\n\n[edit]\n\n[to the foreman of the Mega-Tunnel] You can't help it. It's your nature. But in spite of your limitations, you are going to finish this tunnel on schedule! Come hell or high water! For now on, anyone who falls behind will personally answer to Colonel Cutter! And let me assure you, that the Colonel is not understanding as I am. Dismissed!\n\nSacrifice. To some, it is just a word. To others it is a code. The life of one individual ant does not matter. What matters is the colony. And each soldier knows that he's willing to live for the colony...to fight for the colony... to die for the colony.\n\nI've heard a lot about this \"Z\". I even had the pleasure of meeting him once. But where is he now? Can anyone point him out? I mean, if this Z cares so much about us, then why isn't he here? I'll tell you why. Because Z doesn't give a damn about us! That's why he kidnapped our Princess! That's why he ran away! Z is no hero. We are the heroes! We are the ones ensuring the future of our great colony. And when we complete this magnificent structure, we will reap the benefits! More food, and less work for everyone. And as further reward for your heroic efforts, each and every one of you will get the day off. So you can be the guest of honor, at the Megatunnel dedication ceremony!\n\n[last words] YOU USELESS, UNGRATEFUL MAGGOT! I AM THE COLONY!\n\nAzteca\n\n[edit]\n\n[to Weaver] Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy, muscles! You're making the rest of us look bad.\n\nDon't tell that tight-ass anything, Weaver!\n\nOthers\n\n[edit]\n\nWeaver: [to Z] Are you nuts?! You want me to switch places with you? Do you know how much trouble you can get into for even talkin' about impersonatin' a soldier? You can get in trouble just for listening to someone talkin' about impersonatin' a soldier! [Everyone who was listening in pretends to fall back asleep]\n\nBarbatus: [his last words to Z] Don't make my mistake, kid. Don't follow orders your whole life. Think for yourself.\n\nBala: Labor? What do you know about labor? How would you feel if you were expected to give birth every ten seconds for the rest of your life?\n\nCutter: Time stands still for no ant.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nWeaver: Yeah, and ever since we were little, I've been listening to you complain. What are you bitching about? In case you haven't noticed, we ants are running the show! We're the lords of the earth!\n\nZ: Hey, don't talk to me about earth, okay? 'Cause I just spent all day hauling it around.\n\n[Bala sneaks into the bar with two handmaidens]\n\nBala: [excited] Wow...This is so...gritty!\n\nHandmaiden #1: Ten minutes and we're out of here, right? I mean, this place is off limits.\n\nBala: Just blame it on me. Say it was all my idea.\n\nHandmaiden #2: It is all your idea!\n\nBala: [removes her crown] Besides, no one's gonna recognize us. Come on, girls, what do you say? Let's take a walk on the wild side.\n\nBala: [to her handmaidens] Step back, ladies. I'm gonna ask one of these workers to dance with me.\n\nZ: [watching the other ants dance in unison] What a bunch of losers. Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system-\n\nBala: Hi. Wanna dance?\n\nZ: [upon turning to see her] Absolutely!\n\nBala: Follow me.\n\nZ: [as they step onto the dance floor] So, how come I haven't seen you around here before?\n\nBala: Oh, I don't get out much. I, uh...I work over at the palace.\n\nZ: The palace, huh? I bet those royals really live it up. [secretively] Of course, they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding.\n\nBala: What?\n\nZ: Please, Weaver, please. Switch jobs with me just, you know, for a day. Think of all the things I've done for you.\n\nWeaver: [pauses] Hm. I can't think of any.\n\nZ: Okay, so think of all the things that I'm gonna do for you!\n\nWeaver: [glances around, then leans in secretively] Would I meet some worker girls?\n\nZ: Are you kidding? They always go after the new guy! It's like a sport for them!\n\nZ: So these termites, they're, they're pushovers, right?\n\nBarbatus: Not really, kid. They're five times our size, and they shoot acid from their foreheads.\n\nZ: Huh?! [stops marching, gaping in disbelief]\n\nSoldier: [gives Z a shove from behind] Hey! Keep it movin', shorty!\n\n[Later, as the ant army is marching towards the termites' nest]\n\nZ: So, what exactly does our platoon do? Are we gonna be serving beverages, or processing paperwork?\n\nBarbatus: Our platoon has the best assignment of all. We're the first into battle.\n\n[They marched up the termites' nest]\n\nZ: [panicked] Hey, wait a minute, let's not get...we're being too hasty here! These guys sound like bruisers! Just how were you figuring on beating them?!\n\nBarbatus: Superior numbers, kid. Overwhelm their defenses, and kill their queen.\n\nZ: [stammering] I, um...Hey, fellas, that's...you're being a little extreme, I feel. Why don't...Why don't we just try and influence their political process with campaign contributions?\n\nBarbatus: [laughing] I like you, kid. You got a sense of humor!\n\nAnt Officer: Forward!\n\nBarbatus: Come on! Let's kick some termite butt! OVER THE TOP!!!\n\n[Z and Bala both sigh when they escape from the magnifying glass, and hide in the \"wilderness\"]\n\nZ: Oh, don't worry. I'm okay.\n\nBala: You?! You're okay?! Hey, who cares about you?! I almost died here!\n\nZ: Will you please calm down? You're not going to let a little near-death experience ruin your mood, are you?\n\nBala: Hey, this is not a mood. Okay? You're not listening to me. Where am I? [the praying mantis snores soundly, as the birds chirp in the background] Look, what's your name. Just climb up that tree, and find out where I am.\n\nZ: Look, th-the trick is not to panic. You know, h-h-he w-who panics is lost. Aw...What am I saying? I mean, we are lost. [climbs up a stem of a thistle plant, but it droops over downwards towards Bala] Whoa! Whoa! [Bala gasps; he grins and chuckles sarcastically at Bala, but the thistle part of the plant breaks off of the thistle plant, and falls to the ground, with Z holding on to it] Ow!\n\nBala: [to herself] I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.\n\nZ: Who's the bigger idiot? [gets up, as he plucks the thistle thorns off of his body] The idiot, or the idiot who gets kidnapped by the idiot?\n\nBala: What'd you do? Talk those termites to death? I can't believe you tried to pass yourself off as a soldier. Why are you stalking me? Don't you realize that I'm...out of your league?\n\nZ: You're the one who was cruising the worker bar looking for a little action! And you just happened to find it - the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker.\n\nBala: Please. I was slumming it. Don't you get it? I chose you because you were the most pathetic little bug in the joint.\n\nZ: You know, I was gonna let you become part of my most erotic fantasies. But now, you can just forget that! Write it off, you know? I-I guess what you prefer is Old Blood and Guts! This guy's idea of a romantic night out is two seats at a public execution! Boy. You really chose the right husband. [climbs up a spiked stem of a rose]\n\nBala: For your information, the General and I are deeply, deeply in...engaged! You come right back down here this instant! We are marching straight back to the colony, so that I can go straight back to the palace, and tell my mother...\n\nZ: [moves some of the rose's leaves out of his way with his hand, and sees the \"monolith\" (a drinking fountain) in the distance, the first of the series of landmarks on the way to Insectopia that Grebs told him about] The monolith!\n\nBala: ...and you can go back to your stupid little buggy bar!\n\nZ: Absolutely. Wonderful. [climbs back down the rose's spiked stem towards Bala, who is standing on the ground] That's an appealing offer. But, considering the options, you go back. Okay? 'Cause I'm going to Insectopia.\n\nBala: Oh, come on! Insectopia? You're crazier than I thought.\n\nZ: Yeah? Well, I happen to have it on a very reliable source. [clears his throat] Or...Or should I say, a drunk, raving source? But the point is, I'm convinced the place definitely exists! [heads on towards the monolith]\n\nBala: Stop! I order you to stop, worker!\n\nZ: Hey! I got a name, okay?! It's Z! And out here, you can't order me around! [continues walking on]\n\nBala: All right! Fine! No problem! Grr! [goes the opposite direction of Z, but suddenly, the ground underneath her starts to shake and rise, and she finds herself on the back of the praying mantis, who turns and gnashes its jaws at her. She gasps, and then runs after Z in terror] Worker! Worker, where are you?! Z?! Z, wait for me!\n\n[Cutter watches, as the Queen tells Mandible that she wants Bala back]\n\nQueen: No more excuses, General. I want my daughter back. Frankly, I'm beginning to doubt your ability to handle this.\n\nMandible: Believe me, your highness, we'll spare no effort to bring her back. Princess Bala is essential to all our plans for the future.\n\n[Z's independence has triggered a mass protest of workers]\n\nForeman: People, come on. I know some ants who aren't gonna make their quota-\n\nWorker: Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor!\n\n[Z has been trying to feast on a sandwich at a picnic, only to be blocked by the clingfilm it's wrapped in]\n\nBala: Well, what's the problem?\n\nZ: There's some kind of force-field! [above them, two wasps, Chip and Muffy, arrive] Uh, excuse me? Excuse me? How...How do you get in?\n\nChip: [flying down to them] Yes, yes, well, I'm afraid this is a private function.\n\nMuffy: Who are your friends, dear?\n\nChip: Crawling insects, poopsie.\n\nMuffy: Oh, the poor dears. [to Z and Bala, slowly] Uh, good...morning!\n\nChip: Darling, really? Greeting every insect that emerges out of the grass?\n\nBala: Pardon me? I guess you don't recognize me! [the wasps land in front of them] I've been travelling, and I'm all...schlumpy. I'm Princess Bala.\n\nChip: Oh! [to Muffy] It's even worse. They're Eurotrash!\n\nMuffy: Darling, they're poor, they're dirty, they're smelly. We have to help them. [leaning down, to Z and Bala] If you just wait right here, we'll get you a little something.\n\nChip: Ugh! Please, Muffy, not another crusade.\n\nMuffy: Chippy, we have a social obligation to the less fortunate. [Chip rolls his eyes] I know you laugh at my hobbies, but this is important to me!\n\n[Z and Bala flinch as she stamps in frustration]\n\nChip: Hm. You have such a big heart. That's why you're my little cuddly-widdles...!\n\nMuffy: Oh, my big strong pheromone factory...!\n\n[The wasps start kissing in an exaggerated manner]\n\nZ: Oh, brother. Suddenly I've lost my appetite.\n\n[Z and Bala sit with some other bugs around a campfire in Insectopia]\n\nLadybug: [tasting a brown lump] This stuff tastes like crap.\n\nFly: Really? Let me try some. [tastes it] Hey, it is crap! Not bad. [continues eating] Somebody needs to feed that fire.\n\nMosquito: Dude, I did it last time.\n\nFly: Well, I'm not gonna get it. It's not my job.\n\nLadybug: What about the new guy? He hasn't contributed yet.\n\n[They observe Z and Bala talking by themselves]\n\nZ: [about Barbatus] And...you know, he just died in my arms like that. I...You know, I don't think he ever once, in his life, made his own choice.\n\nBala: [moved and saddened] I never knew it was like that. I mean, up in the palace...Well, I guess we just let the General make all the decisions.\n\nZ: Let me ask you something - what made you come to the bar that night?\n\nBala : I guess I was looking for a little trouble.\n\nZ: Well, trouble's my middle name. Actually, my middle name is Marion, but, uh, I don't want you spreading that around.\n\nBala: [chuckles] You're pretty strange. You do know that, don't you?\n\nZ: Well, [clears throat] \"strange\" is...not exactly the word I would use, you know-\n\nBala: [smiling] I like it. You're not like anyone else.\n\nZ: [stammering] Actually, now that you mention it, I...there is a certain strangeness to me. I mean, it's a...you know, kind of a bizarre quality. Some have said \"freak\". But it's, uh, you know, complimentary.\n\n[Bala keeps smiling, leaning towards him, and they are about to kiss]\n\nFly: Hey, new guy! We need more wood.\n\n[Bala shrugs disappointedly]\n\nZ: I'll be right back. Just hold that thought - whatever...whatever it is you were thinking. [to the other bugs, as he leaves] Hey, you ever wonder why they call you guys \"pests\"?\n\nMosquito: What if, like, we're just these tiny things, and we're just, like, part of this whole other huge universe that's, like, so big we don't even know it exists?\n\nLadybug: [chuckles] Man, that is so deep.\n\n[The ants made a big hole above the ground avoiding drowning from the oncoming flood]\n\nMandible: What the hell is that?!\n\nCutter: I think that's the \"weak elements\", sir.\n\nZ: Gimme a hand!\n\nMandible: Z! You?! Let go! [grabs a spear] Don't you understand?! It's for the good of the colony!\n\nZ: What are you saying?! We are the colony!\n\n[Mandible is about to kill Z with the spear, but Cutter punches his face, knocking him down]\n\nMandible: [rubbing his face] Cutter, what are you doing?\n\nCutter: Something I should have done, a long time ago. This is for the good of the colony, sir. [grabs onto Z's hand to pull him up]\n\nMandible: [glares at Cutter in fury] YOU USELESS, UNGRATEFUL MAGGOT! I AM THE COLONY! [charges at him]\n\nZ: [gasps] Look out!\n\n[As Z pushes Cutter aside, Mandible tackles him and they fall down into the hole past the colony. Mandible hits a root, killing him, and Z lands into the water, uncounscious]\n\nBala: Z!\n\n[Cutter's eyes widen]\n\nCutter: [determined] Men, let's move it! Get these ants up here!\n\n[The soldiers start pulling the ants out. Cutter flies into the hole and dives in. Z continues to sink. Cutter rescues his friend]\n\nQueen Ant: Thank goodness we made it.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody Allen — Z Marion-4195\n\nDan Aykroyd — Chip the Wasp\n\nAnne Bancroft — The Ant Queen\n\nJane Curtin — Muffin \"Muffy\" the Wasp\n\nDanny Glover — Staff Sergeant Barbatus\n\nGene Hackman — General Mandible\n\nJennifer Lopez — Azteca\n\nJohn Mahoney — Grebs\n\nPaul Mazursky — The Psychiatrist\n\nGrant Shaud — The Foreman\n\nSylvester Stallone — Corporal Weaver\n\nSharon Stone — Princess Bala\n\nChristopher Walken — Colonel Cutter\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nEvery ant has his day.\n\nEvery ant runs the colony.\n\nSee the world from a whole new perspective.\n\nActual size of the next really big movie star.\n\nAntz iz coming 10-2-98.\n\n\"The hero.\" (Z tagline)\n\n\"The princess.\" (Bala tagline)\n\n\"Best friend.\" (Weaver tagline)\n\n\"The general.\" (Mandible tagline)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nAntz quotes at the Internet Movie Database"
