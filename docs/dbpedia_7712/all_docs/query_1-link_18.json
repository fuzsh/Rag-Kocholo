        "text": "As we all sit at home and wait for movie theaters to re-open, I've certainly been watching dozens of films to add to my own personal film resume. Why not share that journey with you guys? Until this COVID-19 crisis has (relatively) passed, I'll be writing these smaller, random blurbs to keep you updated on what I'm watching. My viewing choices are very random; I have people determine what I'm going to watch using a very intricate system, broken down into various categories. Today, I rewatch DreamWorks Animation's Antz. This is probably my THIRD or FOURTH time watching this movie. It's available on HULU.\n\nMovie Bio: Antz\n\nRelease Date: 10/2/98\n\nDirector: Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson\n\nStars: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Dan Aykroyd, Danny Glover, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin\n\nPlot: In an anthill with millions of inhabitants, Z 4195 (Allen) is a worker ant. Feeling insignificant in a conformity system, he accidentally meets beautiful Princess Bala (Stone), who has a similar problem on the other end of the social scale. In order to meet her again, Z switches sides with his soldier friend Weaver (Stallone) - only to become a hero in the course of events. By this he unwillingly crosses the sinister plans of ambitious General Mandible (Hackman), who wants to divide the ant society into a superior, strong race (soldiers) and an inferior, to-be-eliminated race (the workers). But Z and Bala, both unaware of the dangerous situation, try to leave the oppressive system by heading for Insectopia, a place where food paves the streets.\n\nPedigree: First movie in the history of DreamWorks Animation\n\nThis is a really weird movie, and a strangely notable one. It's the first DreamWorks Animation movie, a product of a massive feud between Pixar and DreamWorks, aggressively attacks the idea of communism, and stars Woody Allen, whose reputation has changed considerably over the last ten years. If you can get past all of the baggage, however, there remains a bizarre charm to Antz that drew attention to it in the first place.\n\nI'm conflicted...maybe it's the nostalgia talking. This was a movie that I watched a lot in segments as a child, but rarely all the way through. I remember it being on in the background of barbershops I frequented, but when you're 4 and afraid of scissors near your hair, you're not paying too much attention to the movie. My family was always more into A Bug's Life, which seems obvious after rewatching Antz, as this movie is very adult-oriented. There's some intense violence and a lot more salty language than I expected, not even talking about the aforementioned social commentary themes.\n\nObviously, Woody Allen being cast in anything now is questionable, but he was probably a perfect 1990's choice for Z, the neurotic and anxious worker ant who doesn't really fit in to either of those mold. The parallels between Allen's classics like Annie Hall and Manhattan are obvious and intended, the first few shots establishing this ant world as a bug's version of New York City. Z dreams of leaving the colony and finding the fabled Insectopia, which sounds like a mix of Valhalla and Las Vegas when described.\n\nThis started the DreamWorks tradition of stacking the cast with celebrity voices, as this was a pretty A-list group of actors for the 1990's. My favorites are Christopher Walken as the conflicted second-in-command to Gene Hackman's villainous General Mandible, and Danny Glover as one of the many mind-washed soldier ants sent into a brutal battle. That battle scene plays out like an animated D-Day, coincidentally coming in the same year as Saving Private Ryan.\n\nThe main crux of the plot is as generic and uninteresting as it gets, as Z's kidnapping of Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) doesn't ever shake the stench of Stockholm's Syndrome from it. The dialogue and allegorical material in the script is what keeps this movie in the positive, and it's legitimately pretty funny in a couple of scenes. Though they are two very different movies, Antz is about on the same level as A Bug's Life, entertaining and moderately clever but nothing historically watchable or compelling. I completely understand why people would be turned off to watching it now, but if you decide to revisit it, you'll be mildly amused by its unique wit."
