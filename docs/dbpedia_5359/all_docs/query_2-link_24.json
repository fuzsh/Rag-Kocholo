        "text": "Post by Doug on\n\nCharles Durning, 'king of character actors,' dies\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Charles Durning, the two-time Oscar nominee who was dubbed the king of the character actors for his skill in playing everything from a Nazi colonel to the pope, died Monday at his home in New York City. He was 89.\n\nDurning's longtime agent and friend Judith Moss told The Associated Press that he died Monday of natural causes in his home in the borough of Manhattan.\n\nAlthough he portrayed everyone from blustery public officials to comic foils to put-upon everymen, Durning may be best remembered by movie audiences for his Oscar-nominated, over-the-top role as a comically corrupt governor in 1982's \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\"\n\nMany critics marveled that such a heavyset man could be so nimble in the film's show-stopping song-and-dance number, not realizing Durning had been a dance instructor early in his career. Indeed, he had met his first wife, Carol, when both worked at a dance studio.\n\nThe year after \"Best Little Whorehouse,\" Durning received another Oscar nomination, for his portrayal of a bumbling Nazi officer in Mel Brooks' \"To Be or Not to Be.\" He was also nominated for a Golden Globe as the harried police lieutenant in 1975's \"Dog Day Afternoon.\"\n\nNone\n\nCharles Durning holds his life achievement award at the 14th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.

Scott, left, and Charles Durning in the National Actors Theater production of \"Inherit the Wind\" in 1996.\n\nNext Slide\n\nHe won a Golden Globe as best supporting TV actor in 1991 for his portrayal of John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald in the TV film \"The Kennedys of Massachusetts\" and a Tony in 1990 as Big Daddy in the Broadway revival of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\"\n\nDurning had begun his career on stage, getting his first big break when theatrical producer Joseph Papp hired him for the New York Shakespeare Festival.\n\nHe went on to work regularly, if fairly anonymously, through the 1960s until his breakout role as a small town mayor in the Pulitzer- and Tony Award-winning play \"That Championship Season\" in 1972.\n\nHe quickly made an impression on movie audiences the following year as the crooked cop stalking con men Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the Oscar-winning comedy \"The Sting.\"\n\nDozens of notable portrayals followed. He was the would-be suitor of Dustin Hoffman, posing as a female soap opera star in \"Tootsie;\" the infamous seller of frog legs in \"The Muppet Movie;\" and Chief Brandon in Warren Beatty's \"Dick Tracy.\" He played Santa Claus in four different movies made for television and was the pope in the TV film \"I Would be Called John: Pope John XXIII.\"\n\n\"I never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director,\" Durning told The Associated Press in 2008, when he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nOther films included \"The Front Page,\" ''The Hindenburg,\" ''Breakheart Pass,\" ''North Dallas Forty,\" ''Starting Over,\" ''Tough Guys,\" ''Home for the Holidays,\" ''Spy Hard\" and 'O Brother Where Art Thou?\"\n\nDurning also did well in television as a featured performer as well as a guest star. He appeared in the short-lived series \"The Cop and the Kid\" (1975), \"Eye to Eye\" (1985) and \"First Monday\" (2002) as well as the four-season \"Evening Shade\" in the 1990s.\n\n\"If I'm not in a part, I drive my wife crazy,\" he acknowledged during a 1997 interview. \"I'll go downstairs to get the mail, and when I come back I'll say, 'Any calls for me?'\"\n\nDurning's rugged early life provided ample material on which to base his later portrayals. He was born into an Irish family of 10 children in 1923, in Highland Falls, New York, a town near West Point. His father was unable to work, having lost a leg and been gassed during World War I, so his mother supported the family by washing the uniforms of West Point cadets.\n\nThe younger Durning himself would barely survive World War II.\n\nHe was among the first wave of U.S. soldiers to land at Normandy during the D-Day invasion and the only member of his Army unit to survive. He killed several Germans and was wounded in the leg. Later he was bayoneted by a young German soldier whom he killed with a rock. He was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and survived a massacre of prisoners.\n\nIn later years, he refused to discuss the military service for which he was awarded the Silver Star and three Purple Hearts.\n\n\"Too many bad memories,\" he told an interviewer in 1997. \"I don't want you to see me crying.\"\n\nTragedy also stalked other members of his family. Durning was 12 when his father died, and five of his sisters lost their lives to smallpox and scarlet fever.\n\nA high school counselor told him he had no talent for art, languages or math and should learn office skills. But after seeing \"King Kong\" and some of James Cagney's films, Durning knew what he wanted to do.\n\nLeaving home at 16, he worked in a munitions factory, on a slag heap and in a barbed-wire factory. When he finally found work as a burlesque theater usher in Buffalo, New York, he studied the comedians' routines, and when one of them showed up too drunk to go on one night, he took his place.\n\nHe would recall years later that he was hooked as soon as heard the audience laughing. He told the AP in 2008 that he had no plans to stop working.\n\n\"They're going to carry me out, if I go,\" he said.\n\nDurning and his first wife had three children before divorcing in 1972. In 1974, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary Ann Amelio.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Michele, Douglas and Jeannine. The family planned to have a private family service and burial at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nCopyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A sound guy I met invited me onto a movie set here in town. The film was \"Crisis at Central High\". a retelling of the Little Rock desegragation riots. Joanne Woodward was the star and she played a school teacher dealing with the frightend black students and the screaming and yelling white parents. Durning played the Principal. I got to watch them both go through several scenes together. I remember him being very good. I remember her being quiet. My sound friend went up to her during a break and told her that if she didn't speak up they were going to have to re-record her dialog in LA later. She said, \"They can afford it.\" Seems she thought she wasn't getting enough money for the picture and had figured out a way to get some extra pay by making them pony up for the dubbing rates. Durning, on the other hand, was all professional. Knew his lines spot on, played the part well, followed direction from both the Director and the crew. I was really impresssed by the guy. He was a friendly guy too. He would talk to anyone whereas Joanne would sit by herself and not speak to anyone.\n\nDespite the fact that I was a visitor on that set I actually managed to change a line of dialog. At one point a bunch of angry parents stormed the office demanding to take their kids home because of all the 'negros in the building'. One parent asked where her daughter was and the office worker said, \"Second floor, room 102.\" I told the person next to me that school in the States numbered their rooms by floor and all rooms on the second floor would start with a two so it should be \"Room 202\" or people are going to notice the mistake. They thought for a sec and called the script girl over who called the Director over and suddenly there was a script change to \"Room 202\". It is the little things."
