        "text": "Post by petrolino on\n\nCharles Durning (February 28, 1923 – December 24, 2012)\n\n\"Charles Durning, who overcame poverty, battlefield trauma and nagging self-doubt to become an acclaimed character actor, whether on stage as Big Daddy in “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” or in film as the lonely widower smitten with a cross-dressing Dustin Hoffman in “Tootsie,” died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89. His daughter Michele Durning confirmed the death. Charles Durning may not have been a household name, but with his pugnacious features and imposing bulk he was a familiar presence in American movies, television and theater, even if often overshadowed by the headliners.\"\n\n- Robert Berkvist, The New York Times\n\n\"You’ve heard and probably used the phrase “perfectly ordinary” in various contexts. Today consider it in a new one: as an excellent description of what Jack Klugman and Charles Durning did so very, very well. Both men died Monday, Mr. Klugman at 90 and Mr. Durning at 89. And Hollywood and the theater world lost two actors who remained remarkably employable for more than half a century because they were masters of the kind of effortless-looking acting that makes ordinary, often secondary characters believable. Some actors — Dustin Hoffman, say — build long careers on technique and immersion in a character. Others — Paul Newman and Robert Redford, for instance — are known for their marquee looks and savvy use of them. Both of those types end up at the top of the bill. Mr. Klugman and Mr. Durning had their star turns too, but their careers were fueled more by supporting roles and ensemble work, jobs that require a different skill set, a knack for being plain old joes. So while “Tootsie” was a vehicle for Mr. Hoffman and “The Sting” was a showcase for Mr. Newman and Mr. Redford, who was that, a little way down the credits list in both films? Mr. Durning. That’s not to say his or Mr. Klugman’s performances were ordinary. Mr. Durning earned an Oscar nomination (the first of two) for his flashy turn as the governor of Texas in the 1982 film “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” (though, again, he was a secondary character, supporting Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton). And Mr. Klugman won two Emmys for his work in the 1970s sitcom “The Odd Couple” — tellingly for playing a classic one-of-the-guys character, the slobby Oscar Madison, in a show that was essentially a two-man ensemble piece (Tony Randall being the other half of the “couple”).\"\n\n- Neil Genzlinger, 'Extraordinary Actors Ennobling The Ordinary'\n\n\"I was born a character actor. I was born looking older — and I've been aging since I was a teenager.\"\n\n- Charles Durning, USA Today\n\n\"The actor's actor.\"\n\n- Henry Winkler\n\nCarol Kane remembers Charles Durning\n\n\"I idolized my father, but for whatever reason, it was hard for us to talk. He was the chief of police in Riviera Beach, Florida, and I never knew him out of uniform. I was young when he left to fight in World War II. Years later, when I visited Germany, he gave me the name of a woman to look up. She was beautiful, and after I spent the afternoon with her, it was obvious that they had had more than just a friendship. It was very difficult for me to face that. He'd been right in the thick of it, when you don't know if you're going to see tomorrow, and he did what I would do: He lived every day like it was his last. I think he wanted me to find out that nobody's perfect. Once at 3 am, he got a call and brought me along. There was a big fight at this famous bar that was just a real bad place. The guy in the middle of it was huge, but when my dad slapped him, he went down. There was an audible gasp because you don't go down when you get slapped, especially if you're 6-foot-5 and over 200 pounds. On the way home, my dad took his glove off, and he had brass knuckles inside. He said, \"You should always have a slight edge when you get some a**hole.\"\n\n- Burt Reynolds, 'Mens Journal'\n\n\"Charles Durning was often called the ultimate character actor because of his ability to inhabit almost any role, from everyday working man to politician to priest. He appeared in almost 200 films, numerous television shows and dozens of plays, portraying anything from Shakespearean fools to crooked policemen to military veterans haunted by the past. He was nominated for two Academy Awards and nine Emmys and won a Tony for his performance as Big Daddy in a 1990 Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams’s Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. The short, thick-set Durning was virtually unknown until he was almost 50. He got his major break in Jonathan Miller’s 1972 Broadway play about the aging members of a high school basketball team, That Championship Season. A year later, he appeared as a corrupt police officer in The Sting. By then, he had accumulated a lifetime of real-world experience. He had held dozens of menial jobs and as an Army infantryman was one of the first to land on the Normandy beaches on D-Day in 1944. He fought in the Battle of Bulge and, in hand-to-hand combat, killed a German soldier with a rock. He was bayoneted eight times. He was one of 10 children, only five of whom lived to adulthood. His Irish immigrant father lost a leg in the First World War and died when his son was 12. His mother did laundry at the nearby West Point Military Academy. Durning left home at 16 and worked as an usher at a burlesque house in Buffalo, where he first took the stage after a comedian didn’t show up for work. He sang in a dance band and held other jobs before joining the Army. At Omaha Beach on D-Day, he said in one of his Memorial Day appearances in Washington, “I was the second man off my barge, and the first and third men got killed.” He was among more than 100 US soldiers captured near Malmedy in Belgium. German troops opened fire, killing more than 80. Durning managed to escape but returned to help identify the victims. He was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal and three Purple Hearts. He also helped liberate Buchenwald. It took years for him to recover. “It’s your mind that’s hard to heal,” he said. “There are many horrifying secrets in the depths of our souls that we don’t want anyone to know about.”\n\n- Matt Schudel, The Washington Post\n\n\"As he matured as an actor, Durning was able to call on his wartime experiences to inform his work. Here he talks about his acting in a 1970 production of Dennis J. Reardon's \"The Happiness Cage\": \"I had a scene with Marty Sheen where I was supposed to attack him. I hit him with a chair, and I hit him with a table, but I was completely under control. Because I'd had some war experiences, and sometimes you revert, Marty thought I was gone, he thought I was a little bonkers. He asked me under his breath during a couple of performances, 'Are you all right?' \"During one rehearsal, Joe had to move back about five rows from the first row, it was too brutal. He said to me, 'I would love to see you lose your temper one time,' and I said, 'No, you don't want to see that, Joe.'\" \"Charlie scared me in that play,\" was Papp's memory of the production. \"With all that jollity and joviality, there is tremendous rage in him. I'm sure he was an excellent soldier. I'm sure he didn't hesitate to kill anybody, because he had that in him.\" One quality of Durning's was unmistakable: his unswerving loyalty. He recalled once asking Papp, \"How do you know who your friends are?\" and the producer's answer fit Durning to a T: \"He said, 'When you're in deep trouble, and your back is to the wall, when you look to your left and your right, who do you want alongside of you?' And I said, 'Boy, it cuts it down considerably.' He said, 'Right away.'\"\n\n- Kenneth Turan, The Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Don't muck around with Charles. Charles is the most patient human being walking, the angel of the world. But do not step on the 10th toe. The nine don't hurt. The 10th, watch out because that is a man that has been tortured — he was in a war, it wasn't easy — so don't do that. Charlie can be violent.\"\n\n- Theoni Aldredge, Theater World\n\n'Dinner For Five' : Jon Favreau hosts Dom DeLuise, Charles Durning, Charles Nelson Reilly & Burt Reynolds\n\n\"In 1985 I began working with producer Joseph Papp on \"Free for All,\" an oral history of the celebrated New York Shakespeare Festival/Public Theater. I ended up interviewing more than 160 individuals, including actors known for their powerful personalities, like James Earl Jones, Tommy Lee Jones and George C. Scott. But no one I talked to made more of an impression than Charles Durning.\"\n\n- Kenneth Turan, The Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Charles Durning was a boxer, ice-cream seller and dance instructor before establishing himself as an actor. He cut his teeth in Shakespearean productions staged by Joe Papp and, in 1972, won a Drama Desk award for his performance in That Championship Season on Broadway. By then, he had played his first film roles. In Brian De Palma's Hi, Mom! (1970), he is the slobbish superintendent who shows off an unsanitary apartment to a prospective tenant (played by Durning's friend Robert De Niro, who recommended him for the part). He re-teamed with De Palma for Sisters (later Blood Sisters, 1973) and The Fury (1978); in the latter, he is the director of a research facility judging psychic ability, and supervises a female patient who unlocks his own troubling secrets.\"\n\n- Chris Weigand, The Guardian\n\n\"I saw Charlie Durning for the first time onstage in the Broadway production of That Championship Season at the Booth Theater on West 45th St. At the age of sixteen I was already certain I wanted to be an actor and that play, and all the performances, made a very strong impression on me. So much so that I stole the poster from the local train station in Larchmont, NY and kept it in my bedroom through the remainder of my high school years. Years later I did the first revival of That Championship Season in New York in the role of ‘Tom’ and kept a replica of the original poster in my dressing room. In 1988 I had the pleasure of doing a TV film entitled Unholy Matrimony, in which Charlie and I played con men busted by Patrick Duffy after murdering a young woman. Beside the need to pay my mortgage I took the part because Charlie had already been cast and I jumped at the chance to work with him. One look at his work onstage or in films like The Sting or Dog Day Afternoon and you got the immediate sense that he had great instincts, a pugnacious demeanor, and would be a blast to work with, which he was.\"\n\n- Michael O'Keefe, Best American Poetry\n\n“I’m one of the lucky writers who got to write for Charles Durning. It is not a small group. There are probably at least 300 of us if you include all of the plays and television episodes he has been in, including most recently Seth McFarland’s “Family Guy”and “Rescue me” where he played Dennis Leary’s father. I thought I knew Charles Durning from our chats on the set and when I would run into him later at the Pacific Dining Car in Santa Monica, where he loved to have big steak dinners with his good pal, Burt Reynolds. But I only knew the actor Charles Durning, which means I didn’t know the half of it. I only knew the last 40 years of his life, not the first 49, not his unimaginably difficult childhood, not his heroic war years. I didn’t know the half of Charles Durning’s life that would make a truly great movie.”\n\n- Lawrence O'Donnell, MSNBC\n\nIn Memory of Charles Durning ~ Gone but not forgotten"
