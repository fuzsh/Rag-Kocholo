        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Charles Durning grew up in poverty, lost five of his nine siblings to disease, barely lived through D-Day and was taken prisoner at the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nHis hard life and wartime trauma provided the basis for a prolific 50-year career as a consummate Oscar-nominated character actor, playing everyone from a Nazi colonel to the pope to Dustin Hoffman's would-be suitor in \"Tootsie.\"\n\nDurning, who died Monday at age 89 in New York, got his start as an usher at a burlesque theater in Buffalo, N.Y. When one of the comedians showed up too drunk to go on, Durning took his place. He would recall years later that he was hooked as soon as heard the audience laughing.\n\nHe told The Associated Press in 2008 that he had no plans to stop working. \"They're going to carry me out, if I go,\" he said.\n\nDurning's longtime agent and friend, Judith Moss, told The Associated Press that he died of natural causes in his home in the borough of Manhattan.\n\nAlthough he portrayed everyone from blustery public officials to comic foils to put-upon everymen, Durning may be best remembered by movie audiences for his Oscar-nominated, over-the-top role as a comically corrupt governor in 1982's \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\"\n\nMany critics marveled that such a heavyset man could be so nimble in the film's show-stopping song-and-dance number, not realizing Durning had been a dance instructor early in his career. Indeed, he had met his first wife, Carol, when both worked at a dance studio.\n\nThe year after \"Best Little Whorehouse,\" Durning received another Oscar nomination, for his portrayal of a bumbling Nazi officer in Mel Brooks' \"To Be or Not to Be.\" He was also nominated for a Golden Globe as the harried police lieutenant in 1975's \"Dog Day Afternoon.\"\n\nHe won a Golden Globe as best supporting TV actor in 1991 for his portrayal of John \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald in the TV film \"The Kennedys of Massachusetts\" and a Tony in 1990 as Big Daddy in the Broadway revival of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\""
