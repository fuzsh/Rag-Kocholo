He was 89. Durning's longtime agent and friend Judith Moss told The Associated Press that he died Monday of natural causes in his home in the borough of Manhattan. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20121225/us-obit-durning / Durning was Doc Hopper in TMM and Santa in Elmo Saves Christmas, covered recently on the site.

        "text": "I let out an audible \"Oh no!\" when I saw this on another site.\n\nI'd recently been rewatching MUPPET MOVIE and caught little touches and nuances I'd missed before (and the fact that Doc Hopper wears a little American flag pin on his jacket). He earned the \"king of character actors\" title, and I'd also read about his WWII service.\n\nPlus I love the little moment in MUPPETS GO HOLLYWOOD where Christopher Reeve tries to cut in while Miss Piggy is dancing with Durning and she turns him down (a nice nod to Durning's talents as a hoofer).\n\nYeah, he was one of those actors who I've never seen give a bad performance in anything, and that's a rarer accolade than some realize (you can't say that about DeNiro, and possibly not even about Pacino but I admit I don't watch him enough and definitely avoid anything sketchy looking that he's in). I thrilled when I caught O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU for the first time on a cable channel in a hotel room at a lit convention, and saw Durning in a meaty role as the pragmatic politician Meneleus \"Pappy\" O'Daniel (and I *still* need to see THE HUDSUCKER PROXY), and there's a reason that so many of his obits mentioned THE STING so prominently. His Wiki bio will most certainly be expanded and rewritten.\n\nAlso, he was Big Daddy on CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF on Broadway, and I can just imagine what that would have been like (and similarly, Matthew Harrison Brady, the Jennings Bryan figure, in INHERIT THE WIND)."
