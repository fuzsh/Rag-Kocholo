He was 89.\n\nDurning scored his first of two Oscar nominations for his role as a comically crooked governor in 1982′s The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. His second nod came the following year for his role as a bumbling Nazi officer in Mel Brooks’ To Be or Not to Be. His other notable film roles included Tootsie, The Muppet Movie and The Sting.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Michele, Douglas and Jeannine.\n\nRelated stories\n\nFirst Look Video: Famke Janssen Gets Spooky in Netflix's Horror-Filled Hemlock Grove\n\nJustified: Raylan and Boyd's Falling Out, Winona's Whereabouts and More Scoopy Bits\n\nFX's Americans Wants You to 'Root For the KGB'"
