        "text": "He earned two Academy Award nods, a Golden Globe and a Tony.\n\nArguably best known for his role as Jessica Lange’s father Les in Tootsie, the ex-pro boxer and Second World War veteran was twice nominated for Best Supporting Actor Oscars, once as a comically corrupt governor in 1982’s The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas and a year later for his portrayal of a bumbling Nazi officer in Mel Brooks’s To Be Or Not To Be.\n\nIn 1991 he won a Golden Globe for his role in the TV film The Kennedys Of Massachusetts and a Tony in 1990 as Big Daddy in the Broadway revival of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof.\n\nOne of 10 children Durning was born in New York and was forced to grow up quickly after losing his father when he was 12. Further tragedy unfolded when five of his sisters died from smallpox or scarlet fever. A firm believer in seizing life’s opportunities Durning, by now a theatre usher, dreamed of being on stage and when one night a comic failed to show up he willingly took his place.\n\nIn 1944 he joined the US army and was among the first soldiers to land on Omaha beach on D-Day.\n\nCaptured during the Battle Of The Bulge he was one of just three to escape when Germans opened fire on almost 90 PoWs.\n\nAnother time he was stabbed by an enemy soldier with a bayonet and survived only by killing him with a rock. Later he was awarded the Silver Star Medal and three Purple Hearts but refused to talk about his war-time heroics.\n\nAfter being demobbed he appeared in such films as Dog Day Afternoon, The Sting and The Muppet Movie, as well as One Fine Day and Dick Tracy.\n\nDurning is survived by his three children from his first marriage."
