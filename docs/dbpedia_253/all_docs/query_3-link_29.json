        "text": "Method of Exclusion\n\nRealtors\n\nMain Ethnic Group(s)\n\nUnknown\n\nGroup(s) Excluded\n\nBlack\n\nJewish\n\nComments\n\nEmail 1/2008\n\nWhen my parents bought a house there in the early 1990s, their property deed still included the original covenants against selling to blacks or Jews. During the two years my family lived there, there was one African American student in the elementary school; I remember no black students at all in the combined Junior High and High School, and certainly none in my classes. According to one website, African Americans make up 1.2% of the population (http://www.city-data.com/city/Ottawa-Hills-Ohio.html); I have no reason to doubt this figure.\n\nOttawa Hills was historically a segregated town, covenants were part of the original plan for the village; its own website points out that its developers, “were also involved with the creation of various restrictive covenants to assure proper quality development and construction of homes” http://www.ottawahills.org/History_Promise.htm. If these covenants were anything like those on my parents’ deed, they kept out blacks and Jews as well as improper construction. Because of the covenants, African Americans could not buy property, but many houses were built with maid’s quarters and I suspect that African Americans often lived there.\n\nAfrican Americans were not welcome in Ottawa Hills, day or night, right through the time I lived there.\n\nIn 1998, a black construction worker at the high school was arrested for refusing to give his name. The worker sued, and after a state court held that the arrest was unlawful, the village agreed to pay a large settlement. (http://www.racialprofilinganalysis.neu.edu/legislation/litigation.php?state=6)\n\nIn November, 2006, an African American woman who tore up a ticket after an Ottawa Hills traffic stop was pulled bodily from her car by the policeman. She is now suing for $9 million. (http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061123/NEWS03/611230473) The policeman resigned and the village apologized, but it’s hard for me to believe they have really changed.\n\n***\n\nTestimony of a former resident:\n\n“I moved to Ottawa Hills, an exclusive part of Toledo OH in the late 1960s. They had allowed the first Jewish family to enter just a couple of years earlier. Were segregated (not allowing in Afro Americans) until abt five years later.”\n\nTestimony of a local resident:\n\n“Near Toledo where I grew up a bedroom community for the well heeled, Ottawa Hills, excluded Jews I believe as late as the 1950’s. It was common knowledge. ”\n\nTestimony of a local resident:\n\n“As far as I know, the restrictions did apply to all homes. As I understand it, the village of Ottawa Hills was founded in the 1910s by real estate entrepreneurs who wanted a garden city environment for the rich and powerful (and white) of Toledo who wanted to move out of the city (Toledo was a booming place through WWII, with Willys Overland (Jeep), other auto related industries like Champion Spark Plugs, Toledo Scale, etc., etc.). It was planned to be white and wealthy, and the restrictive covenants are part of all the deeds of the original houses.”\n\nA local librarian comments:\n\n“Ottawa Hills has its own school system, village government, and plan commission. The average price today of a OH home is over $300,000–it has always been a high income neighborhood. OH has the highest taxes in NW Ohio. The school system is considered to be one of the best in Ohio. I know that it was not until after the late 60s that Jews began moving into OH to any extent. There have been a few Black families, but not many. In 1998 a Black construction worker was detained and arrested by the OH police. He was working at the high school, got off work and was waiting at an intersection for his brother to pick him up. The OH police decided he was acting suspicious so they arrested him. The case was eventually dismissed, but he sued OH and won.”"
