        "text": "Stuart McGill - Bio\n\nStuart McGill is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus (Spine Biomechanics) at the University of Waterloo. As a professor for 30 years, he explored low back mechanics of both intact humans (both normal and injured people) and harvested tissues (where specific injuries are created and analysed). He has been the author of many scientific journal papers that address the issues of lumbar function, low back injury mechanisms, investigation of tissue loading during rehabilitation programs, the formulation of work-related injury avoidance strategies and high performance training. He mentored over 40 graduate students. This work has received several international awards including the “Volvo Bioengineering Award for Low Back Pain Research” in 1986 and, most recently, the Order of Canada.\n\nAs a consultant, he has provided expertise on low back injury to various government agencies, many corporations and legal firms and professional/international athletes and teams world-wide. He is regularly referred special patient cases from the international medical community for opinion (Clinic now in Gravenhurst Ontario).\n\nAt the University of Waterloo he taught courses in occupational biomechanics (reducing the risk of occupationally related musculoskeletal disorders), general biomechanics, injury biomechanics, low back disorders, and graduate level courses in advanced biomechanics, and instrumentation and signal processing.\n\nHe was the President of the Canadian Society for Biomechanics for 1999-2000, was an elected member of the executive for the International Society for Biomechanics 1999-2001, and was Chair of the Department of Kinesiology 2003-2009. He sat on the editorial boards of the journals SPINE, Clinical Biomechanics, and Journal of Applied Biomechanics. He has authored four books: one for the lay public with back pain, Back Mechanic; and for clinical readers: “Low Back Disorders: Evidence Based Prevention and Rehabilitation”, “Ultimate Back Fitness and Performance” and co-authored another for strength athletes recovering from back injury “Gift of Injury”.\n\nHe is married, has two children, and lives in Gravenhurst, Ontario.\n\nFor further information please visit BackFitPro.com.\n\nPublications\n\nFor full list, see BackFitPro.com.\n\nSummary\n\nBooks: 4\n\nChapters in books: 32\n\nFull refereed journal papers: 245+\n\nRefereed conference papers: 140+\n\nKeynote addresses: 70+\n\nOther invited addresses: 400+\n\nSelf-initiated addresses: 150+\n\nBooks\n\nMcGill, S.M., and Carroll, B., Gift of Injury, Backfitpro Inc, (www.backfitpro.com), 2018.\n\nMcGill, S.M., (2015) Back Mechanic: The step-by-step McGill method to fix back pain.
