        "text": "Version française\n\nBy Sali Lafrenie\n\nWith the Olympic Games winding down and the Paralympic Games winding up in 2 weeks, it’s time for a paralympic preview. The 2024 Paralympics will also take place in Paris, from August 28th to September 8th, and will include 22 sports:\n\nPara archery\n\nPara athletics\n\nPara badminton\n\nBlind football\n\nBoccia (similar to bocce and pétanque)\n\nPara canoe\n\nPara cycling\n\nPara equestrian\n\nGoalball\n\nPara judo\n\nPara powerlifting\n\nPara rowing\n\nShooting Para Sport\n\nSitting volleyball\n\nPara swimming\n\nPara table tennis\n\nPara taekwondo\n\nPara triathlon\n\nWheelchair basketball\n\nWheelchair fencing\n\nWheelchair rugby (previously called murderball)\n\nWheelchair tennis\n\nWhile the Modern Olympic Games date back to 1896, the Paralympics have a different history. The Paralympic Games as we know them date back to 1984. But they had a different name from 1960 to 1980: the International Stoke Mandeville Games.\n\nThe International Stoke Mandeville Games\n\nAlthough the International Stoke Mandeville Games began in 1960, their origin dates to 1948 at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England. Like the Inter-Allied Games and the Invictus Games, the Stoke Mandeville Games were meant to be a rehabilitative experience for people with disabilities and for veterans. The Games eventually grew into a large-scale sports competition.\n\nInitially consisting of only wheelchair athletes, the Games grew over time to include athletes from other countries—making them international—as well as athletes with a range of disabilities, which lead to the inclusion of more sports.\n\nWhile the International Stoke Mandeville Games are considered the precursor to the Paralympics, there are and were many different types of sports competitions for athletes with disabilities such as the World Abilitysport Games, the Special Olympics, the Parapan American Games, and the Deaflympics (first held in Paris in 1924).\n\nBelow, we can see photographs of athletes competing at the 1972 International Stoke Mandeville Games in sports like archery, swimming, and wheelchair basketball.\n\nCanada and the Paralympic Games\n\nParticipating in the Games for over 50 years, Canadian Para athletes have a long and shiny history at the Paralympics. It’s safe to say that Canadian Para athletes tend to win a lot, given that they rank fourth in All-Time Paralympic Summer Games Medal Standings. Team Canada has dominating records in Para swimming, Para athletics, Para cycling, and wheelchair basketball. Notable athletes in these sports include Benoît Huot, Michelle Stilwell, Chantal Petitclerc, and Richard Peter.\n\nEach of these athletes have made their mark on parasport history in different ways. Huot did so at Rio 2016 when he earned his 20th Paralympic medal, officially tying the record for second all-time Paralympic swimming medals. Stilwell left her mark in two different sports, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair racing, winning at least one gold medal in both sports. Senator Chantal Petitclerc, perhaps one of the most recognizable names in Canadian parasport alongside Rick Hansen, represented Canada at 5 Paralympics and won 21 medals. Richard Peter, also a dual-sport athlete and five-time Paralympian, competed in wheelchair basketball and in Para badminton, winning multiple medals with the wheelchair basketball team throughout his career. Peter was also featured in the docuseries “Chiefs and Champions” highlighting Indigenous athletes representing Canada in sports.\n\nThe Canadian Paralympic Hall of Fame\n\nCanadians have made an impact on the Games inside and outside of the competition itself. Currently, the Canadian Paralympic Hall of Fame consists of 42 inductees in three categories: builders, coaches, and athletes.\n\nOne important builder is Dr. Robert W. Jackson, an orthopaedic surgeon who is credited with founding the Canadian Wheelchair Sports Association and as being a major advocate of parasports. While Dr. Jackson’s legacy lies in his contributions to the medical field as a pioneer of arthroscopic surgery, his legacy is also important to the world of sports. Outside of his work promoting parasports, Dr. Jackson also worked with professional athletes in two major leagues: the Canadian Football League (Toronto Argonauts) and the National Basketball Association (Dallas Mavericks). And in 1976, he was responsible for organizing the Paralympics in Toronto, also known as the Toronto Olympiad. All of this and more can be found in Dr. Jackson’s fonds here at LAC.\n\nAnother important Hall of Fame inductee is Eugene Reimer, a member of the first Canadian Paralympic team and a dominant wheelchair athlete. Throughout his athletic career, Reimer won 10 medals across 4 Paralympics and more than 50 medals at national and international competitions. He was also named Canadian male athlete of the year for these achievements. Reimer was an all-around athlete, a true competitor and multi-talented athlete who also played for the Vancouver Cable Cars wheelchair basketball team—the same team that Rick Hansen and Terry Fox played on in British Columbia. Check out this photo of Reimer competing in Para archery at the 1972 Games.\n\nAthletes and sports to watch\n\nTurning back to Paris 2024, let’s look at some of the athletes and sports coming up!\n\nGiven Canada’s success in Para swimming, it only makes sense to start there. This year, Canada is sending 22 Para swimmers to Paris. While there are some new faces, there are quite a few familiar ones including Aurélie Rivard, Nicholas Bennett, and Katarina Roxon, who will be competing in her fifth Paralympics.\n\nWhile there are a lot of crossover sports between the Olympic and the Paralympic Games, one of the best parts of the Paralympics are the sports that are unique to them, like goalball. If you’ve never watched the sport, then you’re in for an exciting time, and if you have watched goalball, then you know exactly what I mean. The women’s goalball team has seen a lot of success recently and historically, securing their spot in Paris by winning gold at the 2023 Parapan American Games.\n\nJust like the Olympics, the Paralympics are always evolving and changing. Sometimes that evolution looks like adding or removing sports, and other times it looks like providing more parity between athletes and prize money. In the last 16 years, the Paralympics have added five sports to their roster: Para rowing, Para triathlon, Para canoe, Para badminton, and Para taekwondo. It’s an exciting time to be a sports fan, and if you can’t get enough of the Paralympic Games and want to learn more, check out this list of 50 Things To Know About The Paralympic Games.

With the games underway, now is the perfect time to dive back into our Olympic coverage here at Library and Archives Canada. While Canada is often considered a powerhouse in winter sports, Canadian athletes have earned more medals at the Summer Games than at the Winter Games. To date, Canada has earned a total of 326 medals at the Summer Olympics, with the most success in athletics, aquatics (swimming, artistic swimming, and diving) and paddle sports (canoe/kayak and rowing).\n\nIn this instalment of our Olympics series, we’re revisiting these popular medal sports and a few others!\n\nThe Matchless Six: Amsterdam 1928\n\nRemembered for their outstanding performances at the 1928 Olympics, the “Matchless Six” were Canada’s first Olympic women’s team. But why were they the first? And what did they do?\n\nDespite the modern Olympic Games beginning in 1896, women were not allowed to compete in athletics until 1928. The team, consisting of Fanny Rosenfeld, Jean Thompson, Myrtle Cook, Florence Jane Bell, Ethel Smith, and Ethel Catherwood, made history by collectively winning four medals and competing in four events. Their dominance was particularly impressive given that women could only compete in five athletics events at the time.\n\nThe Matchless Six paved the way for future generations of Canadian women in athletics. They have since all been recognized individually in multiple halls of fame in Canada and in Parks Canada’s registry of National Historic Persons.\n\nA Family of Olympians: 1912, 1960–1968\n\nAfter qualifying for and competing in the 1912 Olympics, John “Army” Howard became the first Black Olympian to represent Canada (the first Black Canadian-born Olympian to medal was Raymond Lewis in 1932). Although his athletic career was put on hold while he served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War, he got the chance to compete one more time for Canada at the 1919 Inter-Allied Games where he won bronze in the 100-metre event. Photos of the 1919 Inter-Allied Games can also be found in our collection.\n\nHis legacy continued through his grandchildren, Valerie and Harry Jerome, both of whom competed at the Olympics during the 1960s. Making their Olympic debut together in Rome 1960, the brother-sister duo made an impact on and off the track. They both won numerous medals at the National Championships, the Pan American Games, and the Commonwealth Games. However, it was Harry who made multiple Olympic appearances, winning bronze in the 100-metre event. Their family left an enduring mark on Canadian athletics and provided early representation for Black athletes on Team Canada.\n\nMedal Droughts: 1912–1984 and 1936–2024?\n\nSometimes medal droughts happen, but the important part is when they end. Canada has experienced two notable medal droughts, particularly in swimming and basketball. For decades, Canadian swimmers were shut out from the top of the podium, leaving George Hodgson as our sole gold medal winner—he won two gold medals and set four world records in 1912. With the outbreak of the First World War, Hodgson put his athletic career on hold to serve as a flight sub-lieutenant with the Royal Naval Air Service. In 1984, the 72-year drought ended spectacularly with golden finishes by Alex Baumann, Anne Ottenbrite (the first Canadian woman to win gold in swimming), and Victor Davis.\n\nIn basketball, Canadian teams have been working hard to end an 88-year drought. However, with recent success at the FIBA World Cup and the Pan American Games, both the men’s and women’s teams are suiting up for the Olympics together for the first time in over two decades. With Canadian players at an all-time high in the NBA and growing buzz about a new WNBA franchise coming to Canada in 2026, will 2024 be the year that Canadian basketball ends its medal drought?\n\nPaddling to the Podium: 1992–1996 and 2004–2012\n\nTeam Canada has an extensive history of success in paddle sports, winning a total of 69 medals at the Summer Games in rowing (introduced at the Paris 1900 Games) and kayaking (introduced at the Paris 1924 Games). So, it should come as no surprise that rowing ranks as the third most successful event for Canadians at the Summer Olympics, with kayaking coming in fourth.\n\nThe most successful Canadian athletes in these sports have each earned four medals: Marnie McBean, Kathleen Heddle, and Adam van Koeverden. McBean and Heddle competed at Barcelona 1992 and Atlanta 1996, earning four medals in two games and the titles of triple gold medallists. Now a member of Parliament, kayaker van Koeverden earned four medals in three games and is often referred to as Canada’s most successful paddler.\n\nMcBean and Heddle’s golden achievements have earned them both induction into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame and Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame—a recognition van Koeverden should expect to receive as well.\n\nBack-to-Back Appearances: 2000–2004 and 2020–2024\n\nCompeting in the women’s water polo event at Paris 2024, Team Canada is making their fourth appearance at the Summer Games. Earning their Olympic berth in dramatic fashion earlier this year, the women’s water polo team is looking to make some waves. While we eagerly wait to see how the team will do, let’s look back at the team from Sydney 2000 and their notable co-captain, Waneek Horn-Miller.\n\nKnown for her athletic skills and motivational speaking, Waneek Horn-Miller is one of Canada’s most influential women in sport. She’s also the first Mohawk woman to compete for Team Canada at the Olympics. Co-leading the first women’s Olympic water polo team in 2000 to their best-ever finish, she also competed at the 1999 Pan American Games and at the 2001 FINA World Championships. While Horn-Miller no longer competes, she continues to share her love for sports and community through her work as a sports commentator, brand ambassador, and public speaker. In addition to sharing her experiences of the Oka Crisis, Waneek is the director of the Storyboot Project and served as assistant chef de mission at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto.\n\nWhile the hunt for the podium continues for popular sports like hockey, football, volleyball, and basketball, the games have yet to begin for newer sports like skateboarding, sport climbing, and breaking (making its debut). So, what’s in store for Team Canada? Which sports are you most excited to watch? And, who’s going to be the flagbearer for the closing ceremony?\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nI loved running because where I placed had nothing to do with my colour: Olympian Valerie Jerome | CBC Documentaries\n\nCanadian Olympic Association fonds, Library and Archives Canada (MIKAN 198422)\n\n2012-09-19 Olympians, Library and Archives Canada (MIKAN 5609841)\n\n2015-07-10 Toronto Pan American Games, Library and Archives Canada (MIKAN 5610897)\n\n“The Man of Bronze”: Olympic athlete Dr. Phil Edwards, by Dalton Campbell, Library and Archives Canada Blog\n\nGames of the XXI Olympiad, Montréal 1976, Library and Archives Canada Co-Lab challenge\n\nSali Lafrenie is a Portfolio Archivist in the Private Archives Branch at Library and Archives Canada.\n\nVersion française\n\nBy Sali Lafrenie\n\nPicture it. Paris, 1924.\n\nYou’re at the Summer Olympic Games. And there are roughly 3,000 other athletes there with you.\n\nWhat sport are you playing? Tennis? Maybe soccer? Basketball? Oh wait, is it aquatics? Athletics? No, boxing? Well, whatever it is, I bet you’re excited. You should be: Team Canada only sent 65 competitors, and this is the first time the Games are going to be broadcast live on the radio!\n\nConsidered to be the most successful of the Modern Games, the 1924 Summer Games in Paris looked very different from the Olympics that we know and love today. For starters, there were only 17 sports included in these Games. Five sports had been dropped from the previous iteration in 1920, with others included solely for demonstration or exhibition purposes.\n\nPlaying host for a third time, Paris 2024 will see Canada send 338 athletes to compete. The Games boast a whopping 32 sports, doubling the number of sports included at the 1924 Olympics.\n\nIn honour of the centenary, let’s dive into the 1924 Olympic Games!\n\n1924 Winter Olympics\n\nDid you know that when France bid to host the Summer Olympics in 1924, they accidentally started a new trend? That trend was the Winter Olympic Games.\n\nThe practice of hosting the Summer and Winter Games in the same year—sometimes in the same country—continued until 1992 when the International Olympic Committee decided to shift the Games to an alternating two-year schedule.\n\nBefore 1924, the Olympics only consisted of summer sports and did not have a winter sports equivalent. But there’s always a first. Hosted in Chamonix, France from January 25 to February 5, 1924, 260 athletes competed across 16 events. This means that 2024 is also the 100-year anniversary of the first Winter Olympic Games.\n\nWhile Canada only sent 12 athletes to these Games—collectively earning a singular medal—there’s more to the story than that. The Chamonix Olympics was just the beginning for these athletes and the Canadian Winter Olympic Team, which had a roster of 215 athletes in 2022.\n\nCharles “Charlie” Gorman, New Brunswicker and First World War Veteran, was one of these athletes. He made his Olympic debut in speed skating alongside the debut of the sport itself. Despite a disappointing finish in the 1924 Games, Gorman competed and won medals for Team Canada in numerous competitions, such as the American Championships, the Canadian Championships, and the World Championships.\n\nCecil Smith Hedstrom also made history at these Olympic Games when she became the first female Olympian to represent Canada. Competing in figure skating, Smith appeared in three Olympic Games and achieved many early feats to propel Canadian figure skating onto the world stage. For all these reasons and more, Smith was inducted into the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nEarning the only medal for Team Canada at the Chamonix Games, the Toronto Granites Hockey Club won Canada’s first Winter Olympic gold medal. With this win, the Granites extended Canada’s Olympic ice hockey medal streak, initiated in 1920 by the Winnipeg Falcons who won gold in Antwerp. While ice hockey made its debut in the Antwerp Games, that was the first and last time the sport was included in the Summer Olympics. This means that Canada is the only country to have won a gold medal in ice hockey at both the Summer and the Winter Olympic Games.\n\n1924 Summer Olympics\n\nWhile all Olympic Games are important, the 1924 Summer Games had a special glow to it: live radio transmissions, the introduction of the Athlete’s Village, and the debut of the Olympic motto, “Faster, Higher, Stronger.” The Modern Games ushered in a new era of international sports competitions that has only continued to expand in size and spectacle since 1924.\n\nOne of the greatest success stories of the 1924 Olympics comes from a group of athletes who technically were not a part of the Games: the Edmonton Grads. Although basketball was not officially included in the Olympics—men’s basketball would join in 1936 and women’s basketball would join in 1976—the Fédération sportive féminine internationale (FSFI) decided to hold their own matches alongside the Summer Games.\n\nAt home and abroad, the Grads were a difficult team to beat. They won approximately 95% of all the games they ever played and won the FSFI women’s basketball tournaments in 1924, 1928, and 1936.\n\nMaking his Olympic debut, Canadian hurdler Warren “Monty” Montabone soared onto the world stage in Paris 1924 and then again in Amsterdam 1928. In between Olympic appearances, Monty also set a Canadian record that stood for 58 years in the 110 m hurdles event. His athletic career can be traced beyond the Olympics all the way back to his time as a student athlete at Loyola and as an amateur athlete with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association.\n\nAnother athlete who made his Olympic debut in 1924 is Victor Pickard, the pole vaulter and javelin thrower. Pickard represented Canada at two Olympic Games (1924 and 1928) and won a gold medal in pole vaulting at the British Empire Games in 1930. During his athletic career, Pickard’s highest jump at the Olympics was 3.45 m, but his personal best was 4.15 m. Today, the Canadian pole vault record stands at 6.00 m and the world pole vault record stands at 6.24 m.\n\nWhile every Olympic Games is different, they always guarantee two things: excitement and excellence. Whether that’s through record-breaking performances, making a political statement or rallying around an athlete in need, the Olympics have got something for everyone. The Games have come to symbolize a lot more than just fair play, athleticism, and national identity. They’re a cultural moment. They bring people together in bars, in living rooms, and in schools. They’re history in the making and they’re just getting started.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nOlympic Men’s Hockey 1920‐1972, Canada Hockey Hall of Fame Website\n\nCarved in granite: 125 years of Granite Club history, by Rod Austin and Ted Barris (OCLC 42275303)\n\nThe Edmonton Grads, Heritage Minute\n\nFrom 1924 to 2024: Spotlight on the Paris Olympics, then and now\n\n1924: Paris, France, CBC Sports\n\nSali Lafrenie is a Portfolio Archivist in the Private Archives Branch at Library and Archives Canada.\n\nVersion française\n\nBy Brittany Long\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s were marked by global turbulence, with terrorist attacks, airplane hijackings, and kidnappings frequently dominating the headlines. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, preparing the security for the 1976 Olympic Games in Montréal posed a monumental challenge for Canadian security agencies. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Canadian Armed Forces, and local authorities had to coordinate their efforts to ensure the safety of athletes and spectators from around the world.\n\nNot only was Queen Elizabeth II set to visit and officially open the Games, but Montréal was set to host 6,084 Olympic athletes from 92 different countries. Given the scale of the event, no one wanted a repeat of the tragic events at the 1972 Munich Olympics, where 11 athletes were killed in a terrorist attack.\n\nWith the 1976 Summer Olympics taking place during the Cold War, it was crucial to assess possible threats, identify areas of vulnerability, and ensure the security of all venues. Security measures needed to be meticulously planned and kept confidential in the lead-up to and during the Games to protect Canadians, foreign visitors, and athletes. For instance, intensive security plans were required for something as simple as Queen Elizabeth II’s route from her lodging to the venue.\n\nPreparation began months before the event, during which the alert level was at its peak, particularly for departments such as External Affairs, the RCMP, and National Defence. All of the agencies and federal departments involved generated a large legacy of records, which were created in order to maintain the security surrounding the Olympic Games.\n\nEventually, some of these documents were transferred to Library and Archives Canada (LAC). For example, the Department of External Affairs fonds holds at minimum nine boxes worth of material related to the 1976 Games, while the RCMP fonds holds approximately 170 boxes. Additional records are scattered throughout various other fonds as well.\n\nSince the documents pertained to security matters, most were classified as confidential, secret, and at times top secret upon their creation and remained classified when transferred to LAC. Many of these documents are still classified almost 50 years after the closing ceremonies of the 1976 Olympics. This creates delays in granting access to these records. Even worse, there is no way to know exactly which records are classified. How is this possible?\n\nDecades ago, recordkeeping and transfer protocols differed significantly. File lists of documents transferred to LAC often lacked any indication of their security classification. As a result, to determine if the Montréal Olympic records remain classified, we first need to identify what we have in our collections about the Games. Once identified, we then need to review the documents to ascertain their classification status—a time-consuming process.\n\nOver the summer and early fall of 2023, we focused on nine boxes of material from the Montréal Olympic Games series in the Department of External Affairs fonds—a relatively small selection of records compared to other series in LAC’s collections. It took days to sift through and analyze the contents of these boxes to determine how much of it remained classified. This review determined that around a third of the files within this one series are still classified.\n\nAfter examining the contents of the boxes and information within the files, an analytical report was compiled. According to the fundamental principle of declassification, only the creator of the records can declassify them. Consequently, the results of our analysis were submitted to the relevant departments for their decision.\n\nThe classified records related to the security measures for the 1976 Montréal Olympic Games are not the only ones that remain classified decades after their creation. The declassification section of the Access to Information and Privacy Branch at LAC works closely with other departments to enhance access to historical records for all Canadians. This collaboration aims to unlock more of our collective past and ensure that valuable historical information is accessible to the public.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n“How security at the 1976 Montréal Summer Games set a precedent for future Olympics” by Dominique Clément\n\n“The Transformation of Security Planning for the Olympics: the 1976 Montreal Games” by Dominique Clément\n\nGames of the XXI Olympiad, Montréal 1976, Library and Archives Canada Co-Lab challenge\n\nBrittany Long is an archivist working on declassification in the Access to Information and Privacy Branch at Library and Archives Canada.\n\nVersion française\n\nBy Dalton Campbell\n\nIn 2008, broadcaster and author Silver Donald Cameron and videographer Chris Beckett started The Green Interview. They would go on to record a series of more than a hundred interviews and create six documentaries on sustainability, climate change and other environmental issues.\n\nSilver Donald Cameron died in June 2020, and the recordings and research files of The Green Interview were donated to Library and Archives Canada in 2023. The transcripts have been digitized and will be available to the public through the LAC catalogue.\n\nInterviewees included Jane Goodall, Chris Turner, Robert Bateman, David Suzuki, Margaret Atwood, Sarika Cullis-Suzuki, James Lovelock, and Indigenous leaders such as Edmund Metatawabin, Todd Labrador, Albert Marshall and John Borrows, among others.\n\nThe final interview was with Silver Donald Cameron. Although it is the last interview, it is an excellent introduction to the series: Cameron discusses their thinking behind the series, how they made the interviews and what they learned throughout the series itself.\n\nHe said that they wanted the interviews to show how one person with an idea can make a difference and the wide range of solutions to environmental problems. He also said that most interviewees welcomed the chance to sit for a long-form interview, because when someone has dedicated years to a project, they are happy to discuss it at length.\n\nCameron stated that one of the most important things he learned through doing The Green Interview was how people were using the legal system and the courts to solve environmental problems. In 2012, he spoke with David Boyd, “who literally wrote the book on environmental rights.” Cameron said that he realized that this was “the key. […] If we had the right as individual Canadians to go to court and challenge anybody who was infringing on our environmental rights […] [then someone] can say, ‘I can prove this is infringing on my right to healthy environment and therefore you’ve got to stop it.’”\n\nCiting Tony Oposa, Cameron said that with the courts, you tell a story using legal procedure and evidence. If you are unhappy with the decision, you can often appeal and tell the story again. In one sense, Donald Cameron says that even if you lose, you have won because you have been able to tell the story in a formal setting; the story is part of the public record and someone else can build on that.\n\nCameron said he realized that the law is “the tool that could apply to almost any environmental issue.” Many of the interviews discuss using the legal system to stop pollution in Aamjiwnaang First Nation (near Sarnia, Ontario) and in Buenos Aires, Argentina; to protect the Amazon; to enforce policies to fight climate change; to provide legal defence for environmentalists; to add environmental rights to the constitution; to explore the legal consequences of rising sea levels for island nations that may disappear; and so on. Cameron said that they used these interviews as inspiration and raw material for the book “Warrior Lawyers” and their documentary “Green Rights.”\n\nThe law and legal system are not the only themes explored in The Green Interview. In a brief blog post, it is not possible to discuss all of the themes: climate change and climate change denial; sustainable business; clearcutting of forests; scientists who study birds and migration patterns, fish populations and the health of oceans; Indigenous leaders who teach traditional knowledge; writers who stress hope and artists who try to capture the beauty of natural world; among many other subjects.\n\nIn the introduction to the final interview, Chris Beckett said that their interviewees made them “think about environmental solutions in new and innovative ways.” He also said, “Don and I both hoped that The Green Interview would still be a useful resource and educational tool long after we’re gone.” The recordings, transcripts and research files are now part of the LAC permanent collection. The recordings are being processed and will be made available to the public. In the meantime, the videos are available through The Green Interview website and YouTube channel.

That’s what I thought when I took on the challenge of trying out a recipe from this Canadian Army Recipe Book from 1961.\n\nAs I reviewed the recipes, many of which were familiar to me, I remarked three notable trends.\n\nOne: the quantities. Most of the recipes are written for 100 servings or more! As a home cook, I’m used to halving or doubling recipes, not trying to figure if I want to make a quarter or a fifth of the recipe at hand. Honestly, my usual deciding factor is the number of eggs; hard to split those in two! In tandem with the expected output of the recipe, the ingredients are all measured here in weight rather than in volume, to which I am much more accustomed. It’s clear that, in comparison with my colleague who looked at army recipes from 1943, this recipe book isn’t concerned at all with rationing!\n\nTwo: the organization. I have never encountered such a well laid-out, detailed and descriptive (yet not overly descriptive) cookbook. The first chapter is a general introduction that spells out method particulars (including what “folding” means — a note for Schitt’s Creek fans!), conversion charts and suggestions for choosing cuts of meat and how to prepare other ingredients for best results. As you can see in the particular recipe I tried, it also provides handy references to other recipes in the book so that duplication is minimal. I have, of course, seen this in other cookbooks, but what makes this one different is that everything is numbered for very easy reference.\n\nThree: the simplicity of it all. Maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised, but in this age of new and exciting recipes and an abundance of “how to build a mashed potato mountain complete with gravy lava and dinosaurs” videos online, I was pleasantly surprised to find a selection of recipes that really speak to the basics. There’s a clear link between effort for maximum output!\n\nChocolate Cake.\n\nBrown Bread.\n\nBaked Beans.\n\nDoughnuts.\n\nThe list goes on, and many recipes include variations that might have been appropriate for different seasons or holidays. There’s also a handy section that I copied out about “haversack lunches” because as a mom, you can never have too many ideas for what to put in a lunchbox. But I digress!\n\nChocolate cake!\n\nThe first step was to decide on an approximate quantity (output) and adjust the recipe accordingly. If you’ve got an eagle eye, you’ll see that I’ve made a math mistake in my conversions: the original quantities for sugar and flour differ, but I’ve converted and adjusted them to be equal measures.\n\nThat said, I didn’t notice this until after having mixed the ingredients and seen the cake pans into the oven — a small mistake that didn’t have an immediate impact on the final dish (or taste). A good reminder to measure twice and mix once!\n\nIngredient Original quantity (full) Adjusted quantity (quarter) Fat 3 pounds, 8 ounces ⅞ pounds (396 grams) Sugar 7 pounds 1 ¾ pounds (793 grams) Eggs 4 ⅔ cups (approximately 24) 6 eggs Vanilla 3 tbsp ¾ tbsp Flour, pastry, unsifted 6 pounds, 4 ounces 1 ¾ pounds (793 grams) Cocoa 1 pound ¼ pound (113 grams) Baking Powder 5 ounces 1 ¼ ounces Salt 1 ounce ¼ ounce Milk 2 ½ quarts 2 ½ cups\n\nNext, I assembled the ingredients. This wasn’t too daunting of a task, the ingredients for this cake being part and parcel of the basic pantry of many home cooks. A note for those who might be curious: I chose to use butter as my “fat” in the recipe. Alas, my experience with the butter wrapper was nothing compared to the day that inspired this blog post.\n\nI mixed ingredients as indicated in the method and then combined them gradually. Confession: I’m not always great at following recipe instructions. I tend to want to rush ahead, and sometimes I don’t take the care suggested in the early stages of many recipes. I also had a sous-chef with me who didn’t appreciate the pauses for photo taking and re-reading of the recipe! That said, with a lot of trial and error, I can now usually muddle through most basic recipes with a good balance of respect for the suggested method and the splash of personality I like to bring to my cooking.\n\nI divided the batter into three (yes, three!) different cake pans and set them to bake at 350 degrees for the suggested 30 to 45 minutes. The cakes smelled SO good! The round cake was ready after approximately 40 minutes and the square one closer to 45, whereas the bundt pan cake needed between 50 and 55 minutes to fully cook. Remember that every appliance is different and that the presence of three cakes rather than just one probably impacted the bake time.\n\nWe chose to ice one of the cakes with a basic homemade recipe of icing sugar, butter, a splash of milk, peppermint extract and food colouring.\n\nThe final consensus from those who taste tested the various cakes is that the recipe stands the test of time. As someone who doesn’t usually make cakes from scratch, this was a great reminder of how simple recipes can be so good and that the extra steps didn’t really take too much more time than I might normally need when whipping up something with a mix. Next time, I’d try a more classic icing flavour and colour – but green mint was fun too!\n\nIf you try this recipe, please share pictures of your results with us using the hashtag #CookingWithLAC and tagging our social media: Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), YouTube, Flickr and LinkedIn.\n\nRebecca Murray is a Literary Programs Advisor in the Outreach and Engagement Branch at Library and Archives Canada.\n\nVersion française\n\nBy Karyne Holmes\n\nThis article contains historical language and content that may be considered offensive, such as language used to refer to racial, ethnic and cultural groups.

This pivotal moment amplified a legacy that had been building for over two decades. Long before this significant achievement, she had already established herself as a prominent leader dedicated to creating supports and services for the well-being of the urban Indigenous community.\n\nOriginally from the Peepeekisis Nation in Saskatchewan, Marion Meadmore attended residential school for ten years before travelling to Winnipeg to pursue studies at the University of Manitoba. When she arrived in Winnipeg in the early 1950s, no organizations existed to support the specific needs of new residents of Indigenous heritage. Drawing from her personal experience, Marion became a passionate advocate for creating spaces where Indigenous people could connect and help one another in an urban environment.\n\nIn 1954, she connected with other First Nations and Métis Nation activists, including Mary Guilbault, to establish the Urban Indian Association. This organization aimed to identify and address the needs of urban Indigenous people. Marion and Mary collaborated to identify the specific challenges faced by the community. Their primary objectives included assisting people in obtaining housing, employment, and health care, as well as providing a social gathering space. They placed a particular focus on supporting young people who were moving to Winnipeg in high numbers after surviving residential school.\n\nTheir ambition was to establish a referral centre—a dedicated place to welcome and provide information and assistance to anyone in need. The efforts of the Urban Indian Association included meeting with several government agencies to obtain their support, and organizing fundraising events.\n\nIn June 1958, Mary and Marion participated in the Indian and Métis Conference, an annual meeting sponsored by the Winnipeg Welfare Planning Council. During this meeting, Mary made the pivotal motion to establish a referral centre for Indigenous people in Winnipeg. The recommendation was for a service “to guide and council in matters of employment, housing, education, and other community services.” That day, a resolution was adopted and a planning committee was immediately formed to develop the centre.\n\nThe Urban Indian Association achieved their goal soon after when their envisioned referral centre was established as the Indian and Métis Friendship Centre in 1959 at 376 Donald Street. At the time, it was estimated that 5,000 Indigenous people were living in Winnipeg. Mary and Marion, along with Dorothy Betz, were among those most instrumental in founding the new centre.\n\nDorothy Betz (née Nepinak), born at the Pine Creek First Nation in 1929, arrived in Winnipeg alone by train in 1948 in search of employment. Having spent 15 years in residential school and lost both her parents and grandparents during her childhood, Dorothy felt isolated in the unfamiliar city. Upon arrival, she walked along Main Street, where she had been advised she could “always find a relative.” She recognized and approached two cousins in a café, who provided her with her first place to stay in the new city. Her own experience of feeling overwhelmed fueled her devotion to helping others for many years to come. She recalled that before the Friendship Centre “we didn’t have a place of our own—all we had was Main Street, but we weren’t too ecstatic about it.”\n\nThe opening of the Indian and Métis Friendship Centre in Winnipeg marked the onset of the Friendship Centre Movement, the most significant off-reserve Indigenous service delivery infrastructure in Canada. Friendship centres are not-for-profit charity organizations that are mandated to serve the needs of urban Indigenous people by providing culturally appropriate resources and services. They have become renowned for their range of effective programs in areas of culture, family, recreation, language, housing, health, justice, education, employment, and more.\n\nSince the earliest years of Winnipeg’s Indian and Métis Friendship Centre, group programs have been at the core of the organization’s work. Initial popular programs included recreational activities like sewing groups, and the Education and Library Committee, which planned lectures on history and established a resource library on Indigenous experiences, knowledges, and cultures.\n\nThe Indian and Métis Friendship Centre continues its work today as the Winnipeg Indigenous Friendship Centre. There are now over 120 friendship centres nationwide. After the centre opened its doors, Marion, Mary, and Dorothy continued to be influential women of action in Winnipeg.\n\nMarion Meadmore co-founded the National Indian Council in 1961, the first national organization advocating the needs and rights of First Nations people, both with and without “Indian Status.” The National Indian Council is recognized as the predecessor to the Assembly of First Nations and the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples. Marion later returned to the University of Manitoba to earn her law degree, opened the first all-female law firm in Winnipeg, and co-founded the Indigenous Bar Association of Canada.\n\nMary Guilbault was a dedicated social worker for 26 years at the Manitoba Department of Health and Social Services. She played a significant role in establishing the Manitoba Métis Federation in 1967, where she served on the Board of Directors specializing in the Education Portfolio until 1974.\n\nDorothy Betz provided seven years of volunteer service to the Friendship Centre before managing the organization’s Court Program. She was appointed as the Canadian delegate to the Fifth United Nations Congress in Geneva, Switzerland, where she drew international attention to the discrimination and barriers faced by Indigenous people in the justice system.\n\nWhen Dorothy’s father passed away when she was just seven years old, his final message to her, spoken in Anishinabemowin, was a heartfelt wish: for her to grow up “to be kind and generous, always helpful to people, and forgiving.” Dorothy’s devotion to helping her urban Indigenous community in Winnipeg earned her an unparalleled reputation for optimism, kindness, and generosity. Fluent in Anishinabemowin, she applied her language skills to interpret and guide many in understanding their rights and the law, and was influential in developing the first Court Communicators Program with the Province of Manitoba.\n\nThese accomplishments are only a fraction of the extraordinary work they achieved. These three inspiring women, instrumental in the early years of the Friendship Centre Movement in Winnipeg, contributed countless hours as board members, volunteers, and advisors for several local and national organizations, all while raising their young families. Their stories of strength, action, and wisdom represent the many remarkable urban Indigenous women across Canada, past and present, who uplift their communities every day.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nChippeway, Louise, Brian Orvis, and Indian and Metis Friendship Centre (Winnipeg, Manitoba). 1983.

In less than a decade, the syllabary spread to the west and east, with thousands of nêhiyawak becoming literate in syllabics. nêhiyawak usually learned how to read and write syllabics without the aid of missionaries. They taught themselves by referring to the syllabics chart. This knowledge of how to write Cree was transmitted through traders, friends and family. Some scholars say that literacy rates among the nêhiyawak surpassed those of the French and English settlers. Clearly, syllabics worked well to capture the sounds of nêhiyawêwin.\n\nIt is clear that James Evans created the physical type font (stamps for printing) for syllabics, and he played a role in helping to popularize them by printing a Cree syllabary chart and hymns in the Cree syllabary. With the help of Evans’s translation team, a book entitled Cree Syllabic Hymn Book was printed in 1841.\n\nUnfortunately, neither Evans nor contemporary scholars gave proper credit to the Indigenous people who worked with him, an oversight rectified a century and a half later by Lorena Sekwan Fontaine:\n\n“Evans’ translating team was largely responsible for the success of this independent printing. Team members were primarily of Aboriginal ancestry and were either bilingual or multilingual. For example, Thomas Hassell (Chippewyan) had learned fluent Cree, French and English; Henry Bird Steinhauer (Ojibway) had attended a mission school in Upper Canada and knew Greek, Hebrew, English, in addition to Cree; and John Sinclair who, as the son of an HBC officer and a Cree mother, was fluent in Cree.” (1)\n\nTo see a fully digitized version of the 1841 Cree Syllabic Hymn Book by James Evans, visit the University of Alberta Libraries’ Peel’s Prairie Provinces collection.\n\nTo read more about these letters and the English translations, see “An 1889 Cree Syllabic Letter” by Merle Massie.\n\nOver time, syllabics continued to increase in popularity. They were used in government offices, street signs and personal correspondence. There was even a Cree syllabics typewriter, shown in the photograph at the beginning of this essay. The typewriter was developed by Olivetti in collaboration with representatives from various Cree organizations in Western Canada and Quebec. According to the 2016 Census, nêhiyawêwin is one of the most widely spoken Indigenous languages in Canada.\n\nCree syllabics had not only become popular with nêhiyânâhk (Cree country), but their use also spread to other languages such as Anishinaabemowin, Inuktitut and some of the Dene languages, by adapting the syllabary to those languages (see Inuktut Publications essay in Nations to Nations: Indigenous Voices at Library and Archives Canada).\n\nMethodist Reverend James Evans as inventor of the syllabary is questionable at best. Evidence points to the fact that he was unskilled in the nêhiyawêwin, yet we are expected to believe that he created a syllabary that worked so well with nêhiyawêwin. While the theory that Evans conceived the syllabary is widely supported in mainstream history, I was unable to find anything concrete that supported this idea. The only evidence I could confirm was that he created the physical stamps for printing in syllabics. Archdeacon Horsefield, who translated the 1841 Cree hymn book, commented on Evans’s Cree abilities as follows:\n\n“The vocabulary of the author is pretty extensive, but his syntax is poor: he uses plural nouns with singular verbs, and vice versa, is uncertain of word order and (not unnaturally) lost among some of the more complicated forms of the truly weird and wonderful Cree verb.” (2)\n\nA researcher named Louis (Buff) Parry read Evans’s diaries and letters but could not find any evidence of how or when Evans invented “his” syllabics (3). Indeed, Christian churches had much to gain by claiming the invention of the syllabary. They could spread the word of the Bible while declaring that they had brought a great gift to nêhiyawak.\n\nIn time, Church and Crown joined forces to implement the Indian residential school system. By 1894, children aged 6 to 16 were forced to attend these schools. Part of these colonizing efforts included rules that restricted the use of Indigenous languages. Many children of these residential school survivors were deprived of their language due to the physical and emotional abuses their parents endured in the colonial school system.\n\nnêhiyawak proved their resiliency by easily and quickly adapting to ways of writing, reading and teaching their language. We are capable and resourceful people who had ways of recording knowledge before contact. These ways may not have fit the Eurocentric models, but they existed. I have no doubt that we played a much larger role in the creation of Cree syllabics than is related in history books. It is my hope that we can continue on this path of language revitalization to undo the damage inflicted upon us by the residential school system, inaccurate historical records and colonization.\n\nReferences\n\nLorena Sekwan Fontaine, “Our Languages are Sacred: Finding Constitutional Space for Aboriginal Language Rights,” doctoral thesis, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, 2018, p. 62.\n\nJames Evans, Cree Syllabic Hymn Book, Norway House, N.W.T.: [Rossville Mission Press, 1841], p. 9.\n\nLesley Crossingham, “Cultural director says missionaries didn’t invent syllabics, Indians did,” Windspeaker, vol. 5, no. 42, 1987, p. 2.\n\nWindspeaker finding aid at Library and Archives Canada\n\nAdditional Resources Related to Cree Writing and Syllabics\n\nCBC interactive story: A question of legacy: Cree writing and the origin of the syllabics, Wes Fineday on CBC Radio’s “Trail’s End,” March 6, 1998 and, Winona Wheeler speaks on CBC Radio about the creation story of syllabics\n\nSyllabics and SRO (Standard Roman Orthography): Two sides of the same coin (and Plains Cree Syllabics chart, y-dialect), Cree Literacy Network\n\nSRO (Woods) Cree Syllabic Chart, th-dialect, Lac La Ronge Indian Band\n\nDownloads for a Cree syllabics keyboard, Language Geek\n\nSRO to syllabics converter for Cree (n-dialect, th-dialect and y-dialect), Eddie Santos\n\nitwêwina: Plains Cree Dictionary, Alberta Language Technology Lab, in collaboration with the First Nations University and Maskwacîs Education Schools Commission\n\nSamara mîkiwin Harp was an archivist with the Listen, Hear Our Voices initiative at Library and Archives Canada.

Please see our historical language advisory for more information.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada (LAC) recently acquired an unpublished autograph journal by John Norton (Teyoninhokarawen) (1770–1827), along with letters (John Norton Teyoninhokarawen fonds*). This acquisition was made possible by a contribution from the Library and Archives Canada Foundation. The journal’s existence was documented in correspondence from the early 19th century, but its location remained unknown until recently. These documents are an important link in the life and literary production of Norton, a fascinating character, as well as essential evidence for understanding the history of the Six Nations (Haudenosaunee), Canada and North America.\n\nBorn in Scotland, Norton had Indigenous ancestry: his father was Cherokee, brought to Great Britain by a British officer following the Anglo-Cherokee War, and his mother was Scottish. His family background shaped his astonishing journey. In addition, he was marked by military life from a very young age. His father, a soldier in the British army, took part in several campaigns in North America, during which his family followed him. In fact, Norton mentions in a letter that one of his earliest memories was the Battle of Bunker Hill (Boston, June 17, 1775) (item 6252667). Back in Scotland at an unknown date, he received an excellent education.\n\nNorton and his parents were in the city of Québec in 1785. Like his father, he joined the army, but he deserted in 1787 at Fort Niagara. He later travelled and may have lived with the Cayuga Nation. In 1791, he worked as a schoolteacher in the Mohawk community of Tyendinaga (Bay of Quinte, Ontario). He then took part in battles in the Ohio Valley with various allied Indigenous peoples against American forces. He was also involved in the fur trade for Detroit merchant John Askin before being hired as an interpreter by the Department of Indian Affairs. He then lived with the Six Nations (Haudenosaunee) at the Grand River (Ontario) and became close to Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea). The latter adopted him as a nephew in 1797, and in 1799 Norton became chief for diplomacy and war for the Six Nations. He was given the Mohawk name of Teyoninhokarawen.\n\nThe Norton journal acquired by LAC is 275 pages long (item 6251788). He wrote it at the Grand River between 1806 and 1808 in the form of letters to a friend. He recounts his journey to England and Scotland in 1804–1805. It was at Brant’s request that he made this trip to clarify issues relating to Six Nations land ownership at the Grand River, in connection with the Haldimand Proclamation (October 25, 1784). His diplomatic mission failed because his authority was challenged by some, including William Claus, superintendent of Indian Affairs. However, on a personal level, Norton was able to reconnect with his maternal family and became a very popular figure among the political, business, religious, intellectual and aristocratic elite. He participated in social events and attended scientific conferences and debates in the House of Commons. He made valuable friends, including the brewer Robert Barclay, the Reverend John Owen and the second Duke of Northumberland (Hugh Percy), also a friend of Brant. During this time, Norton translated the Gospel of John into Kanien’kehá (Mohawk language), published by the British and Foreign Bible Society as of 1804 (OCLC number 47861587). In London, in 1805, artist Mary Ann Knight painted his portrait, now in LAC’s collection (item 2836984).\n\nIn 1808, Norton sent his journal to Robert Barclay in England, who planned to publish it with the accompanying letters. This project, on which the Reverend Owen also worked, never materialized, and the documents remained in the Barclay family. In his journal, Norton describes his encounters and the places he visited. He expresses his thoughts on a variety of topics typical of his era and touching on colonial reality, such as the British army, American independence (and its consequences for Indigenous peoples on both sides of the border), freedom, slavery (he is an abolitionist), education, the status of women among Indigenous people, agriculture, trade (including the fur trade), business and land exploration. He plans several projects for the Haudenosaunee and is concerned about the education of young people. He questions the image of the Haudenosaunee portrayed by certain authors and insists on the refinement of their language. Christianity is also of great importance to Norton.\n\nNorton’s correspondence reveals some details about his biography and his family (items 6252667 and 6258811). In it, he recalls his return to the Grand River in 1806, divisions in his community and his desire to take part in campaigns with the British army (item 6251790). He speaks about different Indigenous peoples and their relationships with British colonial authorities (items 6251794 and 6252528, for example). He promotes the alliance between Indigenous peoples and Great Britain but is very critical of the Department of Indian Affairs. This alliance proved essential in the War of 1812, during which Norton distinguished himself by leading groups of Indigenous warriors. He refers to this conflict in his letters (item 6258793), as well as his visit to the Cherokee in 1809–1810 (item 6258679). The correspondence also includes a transcript of a letter from chiefs of the Six Nations to Francis Gore, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada (item 6252665). Finally, a letter from someone close to Barclay confirms that George Prevost, governor-in-chief of British North America, held Norton in high regard (item 6258814).\n\nIt should be noted that Norton wrote a second journal while in England in 1815–1816, which covers his visit to the Cherokee, the War of 1812 and the history of the Six Nations. Still preserved in the Archives of the Duke of Northumberland at Alnwick Castle in England, this journal was published in 1970 and 2011, and the War of 1812 section was also published in 2019 (see references below).\n\nA great traveller, polyglot, author, translator, letter writer, diplomat, politician, warrior, activist, trader, farmer, father, Scotsman, Cherokee, Haudenosaunee … so many epithets characterize John Norton, who already fascinated people during his lifetime. He is said to have been the inspiration for the main character in John Richardson’s 1832 novel Wacousta, a Canadian literary classic. Richardson had known Norton and was the grandson of John Askin, the fur trader for whom Norton had worked in his youth.\n\nWe hope that these newly acquired documents, which are important additions to our collection, will generate much interest and shed new light on Norton’s life and work, as well as on the history of the Haudenosaunee and Canada in the early 19th century.\n\nHappy exploring!\n\nTo learn more\n\nAlan James Finlayson, “Emerging from the Shadows: Recognizing John Norton,” Ontario History, vol. 110, No. 2, fall 2018.\n\nJohn Norton, A Mohawk Memoir from the War of 1812: John Norton—Teyoninhokarawen, Carl Benn, ed., Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 2019 (OCLC 1029641748).\n\nJohn Norton, The Journal of Major John Norton, 1816, Carl F.
