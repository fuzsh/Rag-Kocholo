        "text": "OTTAWA — Canada’s economy is at a critical point, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said last spring in the 2022 federal budget. The country came roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic, but inflation, a housing shortage and the “insidious” problem of low productivity growth were doing a number on our collective future. It was time to tackle them all.\n\nA few months later, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and its massive incentives for all manner of green industry had Canada in reaction mode again.\n\nAs 2023 arrives, the Liberals are behind on the ambitious economy-boosting schedule they set for themselves, the telecom industry that provides the connectivity much industry needs is in for a shakeup and the provinces are fighting with the feds over how to deliver cutting-edge health care. But measures to regulate Big Tech are moving through Parliament—with uncertain consequences—and at last the country has a new Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nBeyond ex-officio regulars like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne, here’s a look at some of the key ministers, public servants, regulators and others who will shape Canada’s innovation economy this year."
