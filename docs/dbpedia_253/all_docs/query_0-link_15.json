NEWSWEEK Bm MMvl, THE NEW YORK TIMES CHICAGO JACK NICHOLSON By Catherine Lawson For Jane Goodall there is still one unanswered question. After more than 40 years of keen observation and ground-breaking research on chimpanzees, she would still like to know, \"What do they think of this pale-faced ape?\" Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees, opening today at the IMAX theatre in the Canadian Museum of Civilization, cannot tell us the chimpanzees' opinion of their researcher. But after seeing Dr. Goodall and her chimpanzees up close and personal on the mammoth screen, filmgoers will conclude that she is a gentle, patient, intelligent and astonishingly determined woman .\n\nWild Chimpanzees goes over what for some will be old ground. It begins in i960 when the winsome young English woman, a graduate of secretarial school, arrives in Tanzania. She was sent there by anthropologist Louis Leakey, who was impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge of African wildlife. Goodall, who narrates the film, talks about the first few frustrating months when she barely caught a glimpse of her subjects. Then there is the dramatic moment, shown on archival footage, when a baby chimp approached her and touched her nose .\n\nThe baby was Fifi, and one of the delights of this film is seeing both Goodall and Fifi 42 years later. Goodall uses the same words to describe Fifi as she uses for herself, \"mother and grandmother.\" Goodall remembers her early naivete. Instead of numbering the individual chimps as she studied them, she gave them names. This, however, was fortuitous, because it meant that as her fame grew, they also became celebrities. The extreme detail of the IMAX format works well here .\n\nGoodall sees all the chimps as individuals and so do we. There is Fifi, the grizzled matriarch, the aggressive leader Frodo, Titan the troublemaker and sweet baby twins Golden and Glitter. There is also wonderful footage of the most important of Goodall's discoveries the chimpanzees using tools. We watch as a chimp strips the leaves from a twig and then skilfully pokes it into a termite hole and draws out a snack. Goodall's work now focuses more on protecting the chimps than studying them .\n\nThe Jane Goodall Institute has set up several sanctuaries. The film visits one in Uganda, filled with orphans whose mothers had been killed and eaten. The research at Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park continues, however. We meet Elizabeth Lonsdorf, a young U.S. student whose attitude to the chimpanzees is less adoring than Goodall's .\n\n\"He's a thug,\" she says of Titan, who pelts her and Goodall with rocks. Some of Lonsdorfs work has centred on family relationships. Previously, it had been hard to identify chimpanzee fathers, because females often mate with more than one male. Lonsdorfs careful DNA analysis of fecal samples has settled parentage questions. Not surprisingly, Titan was fathered by aggressive alpha-male Frodo .\n\nWild Chimpanzees is a fast-moving 45 minutes, but took three difficult years to shoot. The chimpanzees seldom co-operated. Nearly every time Frodo encountered the film crew he asserted his dominance by knocking someone over. As with all IMAX films, Wild Chimpanzees features shots from the vantage point of a small airplane. We make sharply banked turns over the thickly forested hills of Gombe and then plunge down to follow the sandy shore of Lake Tanganyika .\n\nMost people; especially children, find this great fun. Others (gulp) do not. Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees runs until Feb. 28 at the MAX Theatre at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau. For the English schedule, call 776-7010, and for the French, call 776-7006 .\n\nAlso showing is the IMAX film Space Station.
