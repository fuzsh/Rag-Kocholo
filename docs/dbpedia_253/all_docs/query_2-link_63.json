Rish also aims for her team to help make AI more autonomous, with human-level learning abilities, by developing new models and methods for more robust and ethical AI systems.\n\nRelated links\n\nAI: a long and winding road\n\nGovernment of Canada recruits world-renowned researcher to bridge the gap between AI and Neuroscience\n\nSubramaniam\n\nSriram Subramaniam\n\nThe University of British Columbia | CIHR\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Precision Cancer Drug Design\n\nWhile many drugs induce responses and prolong survival, most cancers adapt through clonal evolution to develop treatment-resistant, lethal disease. The discovery of drugs targeting newly identified cancer drivers remains a slow, challenging and costly process. The Canada Excellence Research Chair in Precision Cancer Drug Design will use state-of-the-art tools in genomics, cryo-electron microscopy and computer-aided drug discovery in a precision oncology framework to lead an internationally unique research program. The aim is to revolutionize the way we discover and develop effective anti-cancer treatments. The program will be interdisciplinary, capitalizing on transinstitutional collaborations, including engineering, chemistry and biology, with a variety of partnerships with the private sector. We seek to be the global leaders in the emerging era of integrating genome-derived target discoveries and their translation to patient-oriented research for cancer drug discovery in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n\nDahl-Jensen\n\nDorthe Dahl-Jensen\n\nUniversity of Manitoba | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Arctic Ice, Freshwater Marine Coupling and Climate Change\n\nThe observed changes in ice (that is, sea ice, glacial ice and permafrost) are increasing freshwater inputs into the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. These changes are present throughout the system, affecting all levels of ecosystem services, Inuit traditional use of marine areas and global pressure to increase development in the Arctic. Changes in the Arctic also affect processes at lower latitudes, including connections to extreme weather, floods, droughts and climate variability, like the polar vortex, sea level rise and global ocean circulation through export of fresh water to the deep-water convection areas of the North Atlantic. The University of Manitoba’s Canada Excellence Research Chair will generate transformative knowledge, allowing policy-makers, communities, industry and co-management groups to create informed sustainable development, adaptation and mitigation strategies needed to address both the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of the opening of Canada’s Arctic Ocean.\n\nMahal\n\nLara Mahal\n\nUniversity of Alberta | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Glycomics\n\nCarbohydrates (or glycans) on the surface of cells are critical players in human diseases, ranging from cancer to microbial infections. Exploiting the roles of glycans in human health provides new opportunities for drug development and personalized medicine. For 15 years, Lara K. Mahal has been at the forefront of creating and using systems-based approaches to decode the role of glycans in human health. Her laboratory invented a key technology—lectin microarrays—that has revolutionized the field of glycomics. Her laboratory also discovered that microRNAs are major regulators of glycan expression and may be the missing link between genomics and glycomics. Her research interests include: unraveling the role of glycans in cancer progression; understanding the role of glycans in microbial diseses and the immune response against bacterial and viral infections; and studying the role of miRNA in controlling the expression of glycans in cells.\n\nRelated links\n\nHome - Mahal Lab\n\nNew research on sugars reveals link with flu deaths - YouTube\n\nThe Impossible Made Possible | New Trail\n\nSugar molecules in lungs linked with risk of death from influenza | Folio\n\nEicker\n\nUrsula Eicker\n\nConcordia University | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Smart, Sustainable and Resilient Communities and Cities\n\nThe goal of the research agenda for next-generation communities and cities is to: develop sustainable urban transformation strategies that will support decision-making and faster implementation of sustainable urban energy and resource efficiency measures in the cities; and scientifically monitor and optimize performance of urban districts, entire cities and regions. The Canadian Excellence Research Chair is built on four interconnected vertical research axes: clean energy systems for an efficient built environment; integrated built environment design; smart technologies and optimized community operation; and collaborative community, knowledge mobilization and policies. These will be connected by a horizontal task of an urban platform development, merging software and services created. The Chair will link different academic disciplines from the building, transport, energy, biodiversity and socio-economic sectors, while bringing the right urban stakeholders together to discuss urban development. Based on a sound theoretical basis, the research will be translated into the design and implementation of hardware and information and communications technology solutions for a sustainable city infrastructure.\n\nRelated links\n\nTransforming cities and neighbourhoods toward a sustainable future\n\nMooser\n\nVincent Mooser\n\nMcGill University | CIHR\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Genomic Medicine: Genes to Drug Targets for Next-Generation Therapies\n\nLarge-scale sequencing of the human genome opens up unprecedented opportunities to identify and validate new drug targets and to accelerate and improve the probability of success for drug development. The Canada Excellence Research Chair in Genomic Medicine program intends to capture these opportunities by capitalizing on the cutting-edge resources at McGill University and affiliated hospital-based research institutes in terms of knowledge in genomic medicine, computational capabilities, sequencing infrastructures, access to patients and cohorts, and possible engagement with industry in this effort. The Chair will use the latest technologies in bioinformatics, high-throughput genome editing and genetically enriched clinical trials to prioritize disease-relevant genes, determine optimal indications and perform proof-of-concept studies on individuals who are genetically selected to respond optimally to a particular pharmacological intervention. This research will significantly benefit the Canadian population, propel McGill to the forefront of genomic medicine-based pharmaceutical sciences and accrue substantial funding from industry and other partners.\n\nTriandafyllidou\n\nAnna Triandafyllidou\n\nToronto Metropolitan University | SSHRC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Migration and Integration\n\nThe Canada Excellence Research Chair will explore the links between migration and post-migration processes, forced and voluntary mobility, internal and international migration, and the role of countries of origin and transit. This will produce innovative and usable knowledge. Anna Triandafyllidou and her team will focus on Canadian realities while developing comparative research with and among other countries in various global regions. Their work will engage with stakeholders at local, provincial, national and global levels (including the Global Compact for Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees), who will be involved as co-creators of the Chair’s research agenda. The research will develop along five research streams: migration trends; migrant agencies, stakeholders, networks and institutions; comparative analysis of migration and integration policies and their outcomes; addressing the role of cities in managing diversity; and thinking forward: migration challenges for Canada and the world in 2050. The Chair will be supported by an interdisciplinary data and methods lab.\n\nRojas\n\nOrlando Rojas\n\nThe University of British Columbia | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Forest Bioproducts\n\nThe Canada Excellence Research Chair in Forest Bioproducts will deliver next-generation materials from renewable, forest-based resources. These sustainable and cost-competitive, advanced materials are key for the success of the bioeconomy and the reinvention of the Canadian forest industry. Benefits to Canada include a cleaner environment and reduced dependency on non-renewable resources. Leveraging genetics, synthetic biology and polymer chemistry/physics, the Chair will produce materials, products and devices that will reduce Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonize our economy and improve our quality of life. These research discoveries will help control the interactions involving lignocellulosic structures at the micron- and nanoscales to achieve enhanced structural, optical and other properties. The effort will involve cellulose- and lignin-based particles, filaments, films and composites. Leading a multidisciplinary team and integrating strong local and global networks, the Chair will produce world-leading science, innovative products and processes, accelerating demand for forest bioproducts with high societal impact.\n\nMombaur\n\nKatja Mombaur\n\nUniversity of Waterloo | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Human-Centred Robotics and Machine Intelligence\n\nEvery year, our machines are becoming smarter and more adaptable. Realizing their full potential poses fundamental scientific challenges at the intersection of mechatronics, computer vision, computing, artificial intelligence and cognitive science. It also poses fundamental philosophical, ethical and legal questions. How can these machines operate safely and efficiently in the human world, with all its dynamism, uncertainty and complexity? How should they behave? The Canada Excellence Research Chair in Human-Centred Robotics and Machine Intelligence will launch an ambitious multidisciplinary research program, integrating theory, computation and experiment. International collaborations will bring together expertise in mathematics, engineering, health science, social science and philosophy to pioneer a new range of intelligent technologies that will forever change how we live, work and play for the better.\n\nMarquet\n\nPierre Marquet\n\nUniversité Laval | CIHR\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Neurophotonics\n\nAs the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Neurophotonics, Pierre Marquet will develop new, multimodal optical techniques at a very high resolution to explore structure and cellular dynamics at the nanoscale. The multimodal aspect makes it possible to measure a large number of cellular parameters at the same time. It will produce a very detailed vision of the cellular processes that lead to a true cellular profile, which could be used to identify new biomarkers and create new theoretical etiological models.\n\nThe new optical approaches would strengthen and complement the already highly effective arsenal of neuroimaging techniques, such as MRIs, which are starting to enable the detection of discrete anomalies in brain structure and function among at-risk children. The approaches will also help identify new cellular biomarkers and thereby contribute to characterizing developmental risk trajectories among children of patients being treated in these multigenerational cohorts.\n\nRelated links\n\nUniversité Laval: Psychiatry and Neurophotonics Research Laboratory\n\nNew Chair at Laval working to prevent psychiatric disorders\n\nChang\n\nZenghu Chang\n\nUniversity of Ottawa | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Attosecond X-ray Photonics\n\nAttosecond X-ray pulses are the shortest bursts of light that scientists can create and control. To give you an idea of how short they are, one attosecond is equivalent to one quintillionth of a second, which is like comparing one second to the entire age of the universe (14 billion years). Attosecond X-ray photonics is a field that observes the movements of electrons inside atoms and molecules in real time, similar to capturing slow-motion footage of athletes performing on ice. Dr. Zenghu Chang is leading a program at the University of Ottawa to develop the world's first compact attosecond source that produces X-rays with a broad range of wavelengths, allowing scientists to study every element on the periodic table using attosecond X-ray spectroscopy in university laboratories. Such a breakthrough will enable researchers to explore and control incredibly fast processes involved in solar cells and quantum materials, advancing our understanding of physical chemistry at its core.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nRelated links\n\nAttosecond science based on high harmonic generation from gases and solids (nature communications)\n\nIntense infrared lasers for strong-field science (Optica Publishing Group)\n\nFundamentals of Attosecond Optics, 1st Edition, by Zenghu Chang (Routledge, 2011)\n\nDas\n\nKalyan Das\n\nUniversity of Alberta | CIHR\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Antiviral Drug Design\n\nThe development of potent antiretroviral drugs represents a remarkable success in decades of global efforts to manage the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Unfortunately, antiviral drugs are not available for many other deadly viruses that could cause the next pandemic. Viruses evolve and adapt, which warrants sustainable activities in this area of research. The Canada Excellence Research Chair in Antiviral Drug Design, Dr. Kalyan Das, uses a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to facilitate the development of medical countermeasures against emerging pathogens. High-resolution structural snapshots of dynamic viral targets and their mutated variants will form the basis for the structure-based design of small molecule antivirals, as well as vaccines. The new research program will develop a comprehensive approach to identify novel target sites, understand mechanisms of action and drug resistance, and build platforms that cover a complete discovery and development pipeline for clinical candidates. Targeting the replication machinery of “prototypic viruses” that represent families of pathogens with high epidemic potential is a strong focus of the research agenda.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nde Leeuw\n\nEvelyne de Leeuw\n\nUniversité de Montréal | CIHR\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in One Urban Health\n\nThe Canada Excellence Research Chair in One Urban Health acknowledges that cities are unique ecosystems with opportunities and challenges for the well-being and health of humans. With more than 50% of the population worldwide living in cities, many disciplines are engaged in analyses and interventions to make cities better places. The goal of this CERC is to merge the World Health Organization Healthy Cities social movement with the One Health approach that examines human-animal-nature disease interactions. By combining the social science and One Health approaches, this research program proposes new, engaged and integrated ways to develop healthier cities for all.\n\nThis inclusive partnership based in Montréal will mobilize citizen science, social movements and old and new networks for cities, health and sustainability. The CERC in One Urban Health will reaffirm and strengthen the relationship between the human, animal and natural environment ecosystems, and how they achieve durable meaning.\n\nAward amount: $500,000 per year for eight years\n\nDuong\n\nTrung Q. Duong\n\nMemorial University | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Next Generation Communication Technologies\n\nWireless communication is shaping our planet in an unprecedented way. However, the next generation communication technology—the sixth generation (6G)—is facing major challenges. A primary concern is to support the massive number of wireless and mobile devices requiring ultrasecurity, ultrahigh accuracy, very high capacity, ultrareliability and very low latency functionalities, which continue to generate ever-growing traffic for ubiquitous communications.\n\nAs the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Next Generation Communication Technologies, Dr. Trung Duong will address these challenges by developing novel communication technologies employing new wireless optimization and design, AI-empowered physical communications and quantum machine learning to generate the “wireless without limit” connectivity that guarantees high quality-of-service targets for a massive number of connected devices. Duong’s cutting-edge research will strengthen Memorial University’s growing international reputation as an innovative leader in advanced communications technology. His CERC research program will build a world-leading research team to address the significant technological, social, environmental and economic challenges and further advance Canada’s leadership in 6G.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nGarcia-Luna-Aceves\n\nJ.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves\n\nUniversity of Toronto | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Intelligent Digital Infrastructures\n\nThe computer networks we enjoy today have been built based on the initial designs by giants in the field of computer networks dating back to the 1960s to 1980s. These architectures and protocols have proven to be remarkably useful; however, the communication, computing and storage resources available today are many orders of magnitude larger and far more affordable than researchers could have ever imagined 50 years ago. Furthermore, there has been limited progress in the development of digital infrastructures that are just and equitable, ensuring that they are available to all regardless of geographic and socio-economic context.\n\nThe Canada Excellence Research Chair in Intelligent Digital Infrastructures at the University of Toronto will focus on two equally important goals. First, it will reimagine how the internet could operate using more processing power, storage capacity and machine intelligence inside networks, rather than just using those resources at the server and client levels. Second, it will develop new network architectures, protocols and algorithms for just and equitable intelligent digital infrastructures that can serve all segments of society.\n\nAward amount: $500,000 per year for eight years\n\nRelated links\n\nJ.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves\n\nGrant\n\nDarren Grant\n\nSimon Fraser University | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Astroparticle Physics\n\nNeutrinos are one of nature’s most elusive fundamental particles. They are produced prolifically in the cores of stars and extreme astrophysical events, in interactions in the Earth’s atmosphere, and at nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. Neutrino telescopes have revealed insights about the behaviour of neutrinos and the inner workings of the brightest and most intense places in the universe.\n\nDr. Darren Grant’s research focuses on measurements advancing our knowledge of neutrinos and rare interactions, including searches for unknown dark matter. The Canada Excellence Research Chair in Astroparticle Physics supports three areas of innovation: analyzing data for existing neutrino telescopes; developing of next-generation detectors for large-scale neutrino observatories; and enhancing the reach of observations that involve multiple astrophysical messengers.\n\nThis CERC aims to enhance our understanding of the properties of neutrinos, and harness those properties to open new windows to study the most extreme processes in the universe. Grant’s CERC will provide the catalyst to establish an international centre in British Columbia, and have substantial impact on the international particle physics arena, cementing Canada’s leadership in the field of multimessenger neutrino astrophysics.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nHart\n\nSara Hart\n\nUniversity of Waterloo | SSHRC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Developmental Science\n\nAdults who struggle with reading and math face devastating impacts, including higher rates of incarceration and poverty, and shortened life expectancy. Therefore, helping all children succeed at school has far-reaching social, economic and health implications. Capitalizing on advancements in genomics, in combination with rich data resources on a developing individual, Dr. Sara Hart, the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Developmental Science, and her team will advance research in precision education, a contemporary approach to tailor education to the individual student. The precision education approach can be used as a framework for how we inform the everyday practice of education, as well as screen for and treat learning disabilities.\n\nIn addition to strengthening Canada’s research leadership in the field of precision education, Hart will continue leading data-sharing practices and developing data repository products to support researchers who work with diverse learners to reduce inequities.\n\nAward amount: $500,000 per year for eight years\n\nHessels\n\nJason Hessels\n\nMcGill University | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Transient Astrophysics\n\nTransient astrophysics provides a new dimension for understanding the grand story of how galaxies, stars, planets and, eventually, life are formed. Dr. Jason Hessels, Canada Excellence Research Chair in Transient Astrophysics, intends to uncover new astrophysical phenomena and objects that challenge existing theory, lead to new hypotheses, and provide novel scientific applications. A key focus is to decipher the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and use them to reveal the otherwise invisible gas between stars and galaxies. The CERC will also greatly expand the Canadian CHIME telescope, to create a network of radio antennas that spans the continent and discovers several precisely localized FRBs per day. Combined, the thousands of FRBs that will be discovered and localized will draw an unprecedented 3D map of the universe.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nHildebrandt\n\nNiko Hildebrandt\n\nMcMaster University | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Nano-Optical Biosensing and Molecular Diagnostics\n\nThrough a smart combination of nanotechnology, optical sensing and biomolecular analysis, Dr. Niko Hildebrandt and his multidisciplinary research team at McMaster University will advance next-generation biosensing technologies with applications in clinical research and diagnostics, as well as in environmental sensing and food safety.\n\nHildebrandt is an internationally renowned expert in multiplexed biosensing and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) technologies using luminescent molecules and nanomaterials. As the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Nano-Optical Biosensing and Molecular Diagnostics, Hildebrandt will build an ambitious research and technology centre to develop high-performance methods for biosensing and bioimaging—advancing health care, food safety and environmental security via improved clinical diagnostics, imaging and environmental analytics. By developing, understanding, characterizing and applying novel luminescence and energy transfer concepts, the CERC and his research team will advance and commercialize breakthrough biosensing technologies that will enhance the health and wellness of Canadians.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nHull-Meichle\n\nRebecca Hull-Meichle\n\nUniversity of Alberta | CIHR\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in the Islet Microenvironment\n\nPancreatic islet β-cells are the sole source of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Defects in β-cells underlie all forms of diabetes, which currently affects 3.5 million Canadians, with millions more at risk. Despite much progress being made in the 100 years since the discovery of insulin, current strategies to treat or replace β-cells remain inadequate. A major barrier to improving these treatments has been a lack of understanding of how islet cells are impacted by their microenvironment or “neighbourhood.” That is, even if β-cells can function perfectly in isolation, placing them into an adverse microenvironment threatens their function and survival. The goal of the Canada Excellence Research Chair in the Islet Microenvironment is to transform our understanding of the role of the microenvironment in helping islets thrive under healthy conditions, and of what goes wrong in diabetes. By understanding how the cells that make up the microenvironment are affected by diabetes and contribute to reduced β-cell function and survival, we will be able to develop better approaches to treat or prevent all types of diabetes.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nIgloliorte\n\nHeather Igloliorte\n\nUniversity of Victoria | SSHRC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Decolonial and Transformational Indigenous Art Practices\n\nThe historical narrative of Canada's colonial “truth” has long been told—and hidden—by museums, galleries, educational institutions and public spaces. As Canada Excellence Research Chair in Decolonial and Transformational Indigenous Art Practices, Dr. Heather Igloliorte will leverage the transformative power of art and innovative exhibition practices to advance reconciliation efforts, respond to colonial paradigms and generate new paths forward in Indigenous arts.\n\nBy integrating digital media, artistic processes and decolonial museum practices with creative technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, immersive video and Indigenous intergenerational customary practices like sewing, carving and beading, she will advance institutional, community-based and collaborative research towards decolonization across the country and internationally.\n\nBy providing hands-on training and mentorship to Indigenous and other equity-deserving postsecondary students—especially those from remote, northern, reserve and other underserved communities—the CERC will also support a new generation of researchers, educators, curators, artists and other change-makers.\n\nAward amount: $1 million per year for eight years\n\nJennewein\n\nThomas Jennewein\n\nSimon Fraser University | NSERC\n\nCanada Excellence Research Chair in Global Quantum Internet Systems\n\nDr. Thomas Jennewein’s Canada Excellence Research Chair in Global Quantum Internet Systems aims to develop and build systems, components and applications for the future generation of networking—the global quantum internet.
