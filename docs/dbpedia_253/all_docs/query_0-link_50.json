        "text": "Stephen’s Comments (group member since Jun 06, 2023)\n\nStephen’s comments from the The Evolution of Science Fiction group.\n\nShowing 1-20 of 138\n\nThe woman seems accept the inevitable from the start, while the main character goes to all these impossible lengths to try to fix the situation.\n\nThe “light cone” described in the penultimate section of the story and referenced in the title seems to be important, but I haven’t figured out exactly how. Is it just a way of expressing a fatalistic view of life?\n\nAug 04, 2024 09:48AM\n\nI see I actually have Kindle copies of both The Lost World and The Poison Belt in a collection of public domain works called Classics of Science Fiction: 24 Novels including The Time Machine, Frankenstein, A Princess of Mars, The Lost World, The War of the Worlds, Journey to ... of the Earth, The Metal Monster & More’\n\nAug 04, 2024 09:30AM\n\nI’ve read The Best of C.L. Moore, which includes a couple of Northwest Smiths as well as the first Jirel of Joiry (“The Black God’s Kiss”), and as I recall I liked them both well enough.\n\nI read The Lost World some time ago and I don’t think it did much for me, though I generally like Doyle. However The Poison Belt looks interesting and I could certainly go for the combined edition as Oleksandr suggests.\n\nAug 03, 2024 01:27PM\n\nIs fantasy/sword-and-sorcery acceptable?\n\nIf so I will nominate Jirel of Joiry by C.L. Moore, a collection of 6 stories originally published in the magazine Weird Tales in the 1930s. Moore was one of the great female sff writers and the stories feature a woman protagonist. I just bought a copy of the collection.\n\nAug 03, 2024 11:25AM\n\nI’ll probably start it in the coming week.\n\nUnfortunately I don’t have a subscription to the New Scientist, but I stumbled across this pointer to a potentially relevant article:\n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/...\n\nYes, there is also the character’s ruminations on the desirability of achieving loss of self-awareness and living unselfconsciously in the moment, as mystics and perhaps musicians are said to do. She may think that the relationship with the alien would be a route to such a state. In my previous comment I was thinking more of her decision as a way of reaching out for intimacy or connectedness with another being, but I agree that that is unlikely to be all of it.\n\nI read this story years ago, probably when it was a Hugo nominee. I had forgotten it and I enjoyed reading it again. It’s an interesting story. There are stories that use the idea of aliens taking control of humans as the premise for a thriller plot. This one explores a relationship like those ones, from a different angle.\n\nWhat seems to happen at the end is that in the cemetery the main character visits her dead child’s grave. We learn about her bereavement and loneliness and isolation. She becomes more aware of the strength and persistence of those feelings, and opts to try out a relationship with an alien, like the one between Lionel and Mr. Burbage she has observed. My apologies if that’s all obvious.\n\nSabri’s point about the use of primitive tools made me think of the episode in the story where Lionel attacks the cat. As a pet owner I tend to think my dog has some level of “consciousness.” I don’t know if we’re talking about the same thing. My thoughts on these philosophical issue are totally naive I’m sure.\n\nJul 06, 2024 02:42PM\n\nRJ - Slayer of Trolls wrote: \"I finished the overrated science-fiction thriller (now a streaming series!)\n\nDark Matter by Blake Crouch\n\nRating: 3 stars\n\nReview: htt...\"\n\nI’ve been wondering about Blake Crouch.\n\nJul 01, 2024 09:12AM\n\nThanks Rosemarie, Happy Canada Day to you! It’s a beautiful, quiet day in Ottawa. No clouds, 21 degrees C, a bit of light breeze. I’m sitting outside reading.\n\nOleksandr wrote: \"Recently finished a re-read. I like this novel, and unlike many other works it works even better as a re-read. My review https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\"\n\nInteresting review. I wasn’t sure what you meant by “personal development”. Did you mean that your own growth as a reader helped you understand the book better, or were you talking about Sam’s development over his many “lives” and reincarnations?\n\nThe review made me think about the latter aspect of the book. I guess an important part of the religion behind the reincarnation idea, even the technological version practised in the book, is that the individual may become better and better over their many lifetimes, approaching “enlightenment”. Of course for most it’s just a matter of getting a new, young body to continue living as they wish. Sam, however, does seem to develop and learn. Real people (assuming the reincarnation idea is wrong) only have the one lifetime. But in a fantastic story you can have a character slowly aging and maturing in different bodies as history goes on.\n\nMartin seems to be quite a Zelazny fan/advocate, from things I’ve seen online from time to time.\n\nHaving finished the book, I have to say I enjoyed it quite a bit. It is well constructed and the prose is varied and colourful.\n\nFor all the play with Indian religion there isn’t much profundity to be found. It’s a good guys versus bad guys story, with the good guys in favour of freer development of human colonist society and the bad guys using religion to keep the ordinary people down.\n\n4 stars from me.\n\nI read Creatures of Light and Darkness in 2021 and liked it. However it’s a much less conventional piece of story telling than this one.\n\nDune would have to be considered Orientalist as well I assume.\n\nAbout 40% of the way through I’m enjoying the book as a colourful action story. I think it’s very well done in its way.\n\nI had a copy that I read multiple times 40-50 years ago, so I’m in the position of recognizing many of the scenes as I read them, while reading in, I think, a more sophisticated way. I’d like to see that Adam Roberts introduction. The copy I’m reading is an ebook that doesn’t include it.\n\nI’m glad to see that for me the book seems to hold up pretty well.\n\nJun 02, 2024 10:01AM\n\nOleksandr wrote: \"Stephen wrote: \"I’ll nominate Rainbows End by Vernor Vinge (2006).\"\n\nI have to warn you, it is weaker than the two books you've mentioned..\"\n\nI do expect it to be somewhat weaker than those two, which are terrific, but hopefully still worth the read.\n\nJun 02, 2024 06:06AM\n\nI’ll nominate Rainbows End by Vernor Vinge (2006).\n\nI’ve read Vinge’s earlier A Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky, but not this one. I gather it is set in a near future California and involves the “technological singularity”. It won the Hugo and Locus awards. I have a copy and would like to read it.\n\nVery much agree with Oleksandr, about “growing up” with Heinlein’s books. My own appreciation of Heinlein is certainly connected to my experience of reading his stuff when I was young. For a while I thought he was great, then I rejected him altogether for decades. Recently I’ve been rereading and generally enjoying his pre-1960 work, but I have no interest in the later books. I agree that a lot of what he wrote is quite dated and I’m not surprised if it doesn’t appeal to 21st century readers.\n\nI lack the learning to be specific but I suspect the way Ransom experiences sunlight in space alludes somehow to premodern western Christian cosmological thinking. More generally I have a sense that one of the things Lewis does in Out of the Silent Planet is play with combining this older thought with modern astronomy. Lewis’s last published book was The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature, a learned discussion of the medieval world picture as expressed in various literary works over the centuries."
