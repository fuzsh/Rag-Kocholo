It will be 16 years before people completely recover. 17 But please know that we are all working hard 18 to get people back on their feet and on the path to 19 recovery. 20 Visiting your homes and businesses, and 21 hearing your stories, is why I, Senator O'Mara, 22 Assemblyman Barclay, and Assemblyman Oaks enlisted 23 the help of our colleagues to work with the Governor 24 to deliver 45 million in emergency assistance to 25 primary and seasonal property owners, businesses, 6 1 and local governments at the end of session. 2 Then, to help make sure those who were 3 affected were able to access those resources, 4 I co-sponsored, along with my colleague 5 Assemblyman Barclay, workshops in six communities, 6 where we were able to answer questions, and where 7 residents could learn about the assistance that was 8 available to them. 9 Which brings us here today. 10 I've been working closely with the Governor's 11 Office, as I shared concerns and stories about the 12 shoreline damage. 13 And as you have heard, as of last Friday, 14 everyone who has applied for help will receive 15 funding. 16 I just want to take a moment to thank 17 Governor Cuomo for listening to us, understanding 18 the situation, and working with us to make sure the 19 funding was available for all applications. 20 I know many in this room, as we watched what 21 was going on around the country and the other 22 devastating storms, we were really worried that 23 there wouldn't be any help, potentially, with the 24 FEMA application, and where that was going to leave 25 many of you. 7 1 So that was great news, to find out that the 2 Governor was willing to the work with the Senate and 3 the Assembly, to make sure that all the applications 4 that had been turned in will receive funding, and 5 that is something that's been important to all of 6 us. 7 All of us here were determined to hold this 8 hearing because many of you suffered from this 9 flooding. 10 We know that you're still trying to recover, 11 and that goes beyond money. 12 The peace of mind that comes with hearing 13 directly from all those involved is extremely 14 important, since the question everyone is waiting to 15 be answered, is whether this will happen again next 16 year. 17 There are a number of experts here today who, 18 hopefully, can shed light on this issue. 19 We also have families and business owners who 20 have been affected. 21 State agencies and the IJC have agreed to 22 testify, to help us better understand Plan 2014. 23 I personally want to thank them for coming 24 here this evening. 25 If we all understand the size of this 8 1 flooding issue and we work together, we will be 2 better prepared for the future, and better prepared 3 to take care of everyone who lives, works, and plays 4 on the lake and the river. 5 And tonight is an opportunity to hear 6 directly from those of you who have been affected, 7 whether you're a homeowner, a secondary resident, 8 has been affected, or you're a business owner. 9 So I want to thank you for coming out 10 tonight, and taking time out of your busy schedule 11 to be here. 12 And I also want to thank, once again, 13 Senator O'Mara for taking time out of his busy 14 schedule to come and hold this hearing in my 15 district. 16 Thank you, Senator. 17 SENATOR O'MARA: Well, thank you, Patty. 18 It's quite all right. 19 I got some fishing in while I was here this 20 weekend, so it's worth the trip. 21 Assemblyman Barclay. 22 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Thank you, Senator. 23 I will be very brief. 24 I want to thank Patty Ritchie for the great 25 job she's done in the Senate to help secure the 9 1 financial relief for those who are affected by this 2 high water levels. 3 And I also want to thank her for the great 4 job she's doing to try to get additional funding, so 5 we make sure everybody, as she mentioned, can get 6 some relief from the high waters. 7 I want to thank Tom, my friend 8 Tom O'Mara/Senator O'Mara, who served in the 9 Assembly for six years with Bob and myself. 10 And what Tom didn't tell you, although he's 11 Chair of the Environmental Committee in the Senate, 12 he also -- we think of him has a resident here of 13 Mexico, because his parents have a camp down on 14 Ramona Beach. 15 And, obviously, I want to thank my colleague 16 Bob Oaks, on my far right, from Wayne County. 17 He's intimately involved also with this 18 problem because, obviously, Wayne County is being 19 affected quite heavily like we are here. 20 So, thank you all for being here. 21 SENATOR O'MARA: Assemblyman Oaks. 22 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: Thank you, Senator. 23 And I would just like to add my greetings. 24 Thanks to my colleagues Senator O'Mara, 25 Senator Ritchie, and Assemblyman Barclay. 10 1 Just focusing on this issue, for me, my 2 district runs west, from the city of Oswego line 3 to the Monroe County line. So, through part of 4 Oswego County, Cayuga County, Wayne County. 5 And so the issue of, concerned about possible 6 flooding, came up in recent years, as considerations 7 were being given on what types of policies should 8 oversee the lake. 9 And then, clearly, this year we had the 10 problem that affected all of us on the south and 11 eastern shores and the St. Lawrence River area, that 12 the impact of the high water. 13 And, so, my major concern tonight, and 14 interest, is listening, and hearing responses to 15 questions about how we can move forward in a way 16 that prevents future lake problems, and also puts us 17 all on a path of protecting the property that people 18 own, the businesses that operate, along that shore. 19 So, I appreciate the opportunity, and the 20 Senate and Senator O'Mara for coming here, and 21 Senator Ritchie for providing that invitation, so 22 that we can cover that issue tonight. 23 Thank you. 24 SENATOR O'MARA: Thank you, Bob. 25 And just to let you all know, briefly, a 11 1 little bit of my background, as Will alluded to a 2 little bit: 3 My parents are both graduates of Mexico 4 Academy. 5 My mother grew up two blocks down the street, 6 across the street from here, so I've been coming 7 here my entire life. 8 My family has had a place on the beach, at 9 Ramona Beach, for the past 36 years that I've been 10 coming here. 11 So I've been an avid boater and fisherman in 12 the area, and take the concerns of Lake Ontario, its 13 beauty, its natural wonder that we have, and the 14 economic activity that is generated from that for so 15 many. 16 So we hope to learn tonight about how the 17 programs of relief are going. 18 And probably more importantly, for myself and 19 others here, what do we expect next year, and the 20 year after that, and the year after that? 21 Is this the new normal because of Plan 2014, 22 and where are we going? 23 So I thank you all for being here. 24 We're going to start out with 25 Mr. Stephen Durrett, the alternate co-chair of the 12 1 International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board. 2 STEPHEN DURRETT: Thank you all very much. 3 Good afternoon, members of the Senate 4 Standing Committee on the Environment Conservation, 5 and, ladies and gentlemen in the audience. 6 My name is Steve Durrett. 7 I am the alternate U.S. chair for the 8 International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board. 9 I am also a member of the senior executive 10 service, civilian, for the U.S. Army Corps of 11 Engineers, in the Cincinnati, Great Lakes, and 12 Ohio River division. 13 I am here today on behalf of Major General -- 14 Brigadier General, excuse me, Mark Toy, to represent 15 the International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River 16 Board, which I will refer to as \"the board.\" 17 General Toy regrets he could not make it. 18 He is in the process of getting his training, 19 and stuff. He will be deploying to Afghanistan here 20 next month. 21 The board was established by the 22 International Joint Commission and has ten members; 23 five from the United States and five from Canada. 24 Our primary duty is to ensure that outflows 25 from Lake Ontario meet the requirements of the 13 1 IJC orders of approval. 2 In my comments today, I would like to explain 3 the hydrologic conditions which led to the record 4 high water levels on Lake Ontario this year, and 5 explain the water-level regulation activities the 6 board carried out in accordance with the IJC 7 December 8, 2016, supplemental orders of approval, 8 referred to as \"Plan 2014.\" 9 I hope this forum provides the Committee and 10 the public with an understanding of three facts: 11 The extreme high water levels on Lake Ontario 12 this year were primarily driven by extreme weather 13 conditions. 14 The extreme weather conditions -- 15 [Indiscernible audience comments.] 16 SENATOR O'MARA: Can we please -- hold the 17 comments, please, during this hearing. 18 STEPHEN DURRETT: The extreme weather 19 conditions cannot be reliably forecast months, or 20 even weeks, in advance. 21 And the potential impacts to all interests in 22 the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River system must be 23 balanced when making water-management decisions. 24 The high water levels on Lake Ontario this 25 year primarily stem from two factors: Heavy 14 1 rainfalls across the entire Lake Ontario and 2 St. Lawrence River system that began in April and 3 continued through early August, and, a related 4 record-setting spring runoff event in the Ottawa 5 River Basin. 6 Two additional factors also play a role in 7 increased water levels: An unusual mild and wet 8 winter we had this last year, and, the above-average 9 inflows from the upper Great Lakes. 10 Water levels on Lake Ontario began in 11 January 2017, very similar to 2015 and '16, slightly 12 above long-term average, with Lake Erie water levels 13 above average. 14 Unlike the years of '15 and '16, 15 Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River system and the 16 Ottawa River Basin received widespread, 17 record-setting precipitation during the months of 18 April and May, leading to high water levels and 19 flood-related impacts simultaneously occurring on 20 Lake Ontario and downstream in the Montreal region. 21 During April, the total amount of water 22 entering Lake Ontario, known as the \"net total 23 supply,\" was the second highest recorded since 1900. 24 Net total supply includes precipitation, 25 runoff from tributaries, evaporation from the lake 15 1 itself, and inflow from Lake Erie. 2 The Ottawa River Basin also experienced heavy 3 rainfall in April, leading to record-setting flows 4 and one of the highest recorded since 1960. 5 To balance flooding impacts between 6 Lake Ontario and Montreal region, Plan 2014 includes 7 the F limit, which was based upon previous board 8 decisions making strategies -- board-making 9 strategies. 10 During high-water events in the 1990s, under 11 the previous regulation plan, 1958D, the F limit 12 determines the maximum outflow from Lake Ontario to 13 limit flooding on Lake St. Louis near Montreal. 14 In consideration of Lake Ontario's levels, it 15 is a multi-tiered rule that attempts to balance 16 upstream and downstream flooding damages by keeping 17 the level of St. Louis -- Lake St. Louis below the 18 given stage for a corresponding Lake Ontario level. 19 Outflows were set in accordance with the 20 F limit for the entire month of April. 21 By April 28th, Lake Ontario water levels had 22 reached Plan 2014 Criteria H14 high threshold. 23 The Criteria H14 authorizes the board to make 24 major deviations from the regulation plan to provide 25 all possible relief to riparian owners both upstream 16 1 and downstream. 2 After an extensive review of the high water 3 levels occurring throughout the system, along with a 4 number of potential outflow strategies, the board 5 decide to continue following the F limit, 6 recognizing that any greater increases in outflow 7 would further increase flooding in the lower 8 St. Lawrence River system, while only providing a 9 minimal decrease to the Lake Ontario water levels. 10 Moving into May, extreme precipitation 11 continued across the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River 12 Basin, and, on Lake Erie itself, resulting in the 13 highest net total supply to Lake Ontario in May 14 since 1900. 15 When combined with April, the total -- the 16 net total supply was the highest two months ever 17 recorded on Lake Ontario. 18 At the same time, more record-breaking rain 19 on the Ottawa River Basin caused its outflows to 20 peak at historic record rates, and induced more 21 significant flooding in the Montreal area and 22 further downstream. 23 In accordance with the F limit, outflow from 24 Lake Ontario was significantly reduced during the 25 first week of May during the peak of Ottawa River 17 1 outflow. 2 As Ottawa River flows subsided, Lake Ontario 3 outflows was quickly increased, from 6200 cubic 4 meters per second during the first week of May, to 5 10,200 cubic meters per second by the last week of 6 May. 7 This flow rate exceeds the flow specified by 8 Plan 2014, and was equivalent to the highest weekly 9 average outflow released in 1993 and 1998. 10 This was also considered to be the maximum 11 outflow that could be released while maintaining 12 safe velocities for navigation in the international 13 section of the St. Lawrence River when Lake Ontario 14 levels are high. 15 Despite these record high releases, water 16 supplies into Lake Ontario remained above average, 17 and Lake Ontario continued to rise, peaking at a 18 record high level of 75.88 meters by the end of May. 19 At this time, the board concluded that any 20 further increase in outflows would have further 21 adverse impacts to water levels downstream, while 22 only providing minimal lowering of the water levels 23 on Lake Ontario. 24 June and July brought more rain, which 25 contributed to the second highest net total supplies 18 1 on record since 1990 for each of these two months. 2 By June -- by mid-June, water levels 3 downstream in Montreal began to decline, and 4 the board increased the Lake Ontario outflow to a 5 new record maximum weekly average outflow of 6 10,400 cubic meters per second. 7 This required the St. Lawrence Seaway to put 8 in mitigation measures in place to ensure safe 9 navigations could continue under the increased and 10 current velocities that were caused by the increased 11 outflow. 12 As wet weather continued, the board 13 maintained this high record flow of 10,400 cubic 14 meters per second into early August, nearly six 15 weeks, or eight weeks, of high record flows we were 16 discharging through Moses-Saunders Dam. 17 By the middle of August, hydraulic conditions 18 improved, and since then, the Lake Ontario levels 19 have been on a steady decline. 20 In fact, Lake Ontario fell 13.8 inches during 21 the month of August, which is the largest drop ever 22 recorded during any month since records were 23 maintained in 1918. 24 It continued to fall in September, and 25 dropped an additional 11 inches, which is the 19 1 largest decline on record for the month of 2 September. 3 Water levels are expected to continue to 4 decline over the next several weeks, and with hope 5 of average weather conditions, Lake Ontario water 6 levels is expected to continue to decline and 7 approach average water levels by the end of the 8 calendar year. 9 That concludes my accounts of the hydraulic 10 condition and the board's role in level regulation. 11 In summary: 12 The magnitude of the record precipitation 13 events that occurred this spring and summer were 14 caused -- were the cause of high water. 15 The coincidental high water levels and 16 persistent rainfall, both upstream and downstream in 17 the Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River system, 18 presented a challenge in providing relief to 19 riparian property and business owners system-wide. 20 With the water levels of Lake Ontario 21 starting in 2017, similar to '15 and '16, and no 22 forecast that indicated the record-breaking weather 23 arrived in the spring and summer, this year events 24 demonstrates the uncertainty associated with 25 long-term forecasts and the inability to schedule 20 1 proactive water releases in anticipation of extreme 2 weather. 3 I hope the Committee and the public have 4 gained an understanding of the need to balance the 5 impacts to all interests within the system, and the 6 complexity of managing water levels during extreme 7 weather conditions. 8 Despite record outflows being released from 9 Lake Ontario, they played a minor role in affecting 10 water levels when compared to the effect of the 11 weather conditions. 12 Due to the large size of Lake Ontario, when 13 compared to the capacity of the St. Lawrence River, 14 relatively large changes in Lake Ontario outflow 15 have a small effect in changing the levels of 16 Lake Ontario, but may severely affect interests on 17 Lake St. Lawrence and downstream in the lower 18 St. Lawrence River near Montreal. 19 Before closing, I would like to mention that 20 the board, in conjunction with the Great Lakes and 21 St. Lawrence River Adaptive Management Committee, 22 will be producing a post high-water assessment. 23 This assessment would document the hydraulic 24 conditions, the actions taken by the board, compiled 25 information on known impact, and identify any other 21 1 strategies that could have occurred under the 2 current regulation plan. 3 We hope to have this report available next 4 year after data collection efforts are completed. 5 Thank you for this opportunity, and I now ask 6 the Senate Committee if they have any questions? 7 SENATOR O'MARA: Thank you, and thank you for 8 being here this evening with us as well. 9 Patty? 10 SENATOR RITCHIE: (No audio.) 11 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: I have a few, I think, 12 relatively simple questions. 13 Thank you for your testimony. 14 First, can we get a copy -- do we have a copy 15 of that testimony? 16 STEPHEN DURRETT: Yes, you do. 17 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Oh, it is? 18 Thank you. 19 How is the board appointed? 20 STEPHEN DURRETT: The board is appointed by 21 the IJC. 22 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: And you, essentially, 23 if I understand the board, your job is, basically, 24 the mechanics of keeping the water level; correct? 25 STEPHEN DURRETT: Our job is the execution of 22 1 Plan 2014, yes. 2 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: Which is, essentially, 3 keeping the lake levels. 4 Do you feel -- and this is more of an 5 opinion, but do you feel, because of Plan 2014, your 6 hands are now tied? 7 Where, my understanding, in the past, the 8 board had some leeway in regulating the lake. 9 They thought, maybe it was going to be a 10 heavy rainfall in the spring, they might level more 11 water out than they would, you know, in a normal 12 year. 13 Have you felt, under the Plan 2014, that the 14 board's, you know, hands are tied because of the 15 plan? 16 STEPHEN DURRETT: I do not believe so. 17 I think this is a record -- my opinion is, 18 this is all based upon a record event. 19 It's not a record event in one area. It was 20 a base -- really, it was a region-wide event that 21 occurred over Lake Ontario and the lower 22 St. Lawrence River. 23 Whatever plan we would have in place, we 24 would have had the same conditions. 25 I believe we had the same conditions we had 23 1 this year, no matter what plan was in place. 2 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: In the spring -- 3 [Indiscernible audience comments.] 4 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: -- if I understand the 5 Plan 2014 correctly, you couldn't release water 6 until you hit the 248 level? Is that correct? 7 STEPHEN DURRETT: No. We couldn't release 8 till we hit the H14 criteria, which varies, from 9 week to week, across the given year. 10 That's when we have deviation authorities to 11 change. 12 But then it's a matter of balancing the 13 interests upstream and downstream of Lake Ontario. 14 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: And how -- just, how do 15 you get on the board? 16 It's, the IJC, what, do you put a resume in? 17 Or, how do people get on this control board? 18 I know it's appointed by the IJC, but -- 19 STEPHEN DURRETT: That would have to be a 20 question for the IJC. 21 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Thank you. 22 SENATOR O'MARA: Senator Ritchie. 23 SENATOR RITCHIE: Just a couple questions. 24 I guess I am a little confused on, and I need 25 some clarification on, the deviation authority. 24 1 You're saying that, with what's in place now, 2 you're not able to make changes, and there's a 3 certain deviation authority. 4 Has that changed in the last year under 5 Plan 2014? 6 STEPHEN DURRETT: No, any major deviations, 7 even under the 1958 plan, we would have to ask for 8 deviation and do a payback. 9 So there was rules in place even under the 10 1958D plan as well. 11 The 214 -- Plan 2014 tried to establish, 12 based upon historical guidelines that we had had in 13 1990s, in '93 and '98 events, how we regulated 14 Lake Ontario, that was incorporated into the 2'14 15 plan. 16 SENATOR RITCHIE: So there is no -- there's 17 no change between what has been historically done 18 and what was done under Plan 2014? 19 STEPHEN DURRETT: That would be hard to say, 20 since it's hard to compare historical events, unless 21 the floods, the rainstorms, and the events were 22 exactly the same. 23 And they are not exactly -- no two rain 24 events or flood events are exactly the same. 25 So it would be impossible to say there's no 25 1 difference between the two plans. 2 SENATOR RITCHIE: And in order to get 3 authority to start a deviation plan earlier, where 4 would that come from? 5 STEPHEN DURRETT: We would have to -- the 6 board would have to request authority from the IJC. 7 SENATOR RITCHIE: And is that something that, 8 potentially, you're going to look at doing in case 9 this is an unprecedented wet spring next year? 10 Is there anything that you're going to put in 11 place that would, potentially, allow you to act 12 sooner, or to ask for that authority to deviate from 13 the plan? 14 STEPHEN DURRETT: Some of that data will come 15 out in the post-flood assessment, to look at ways, 16 is there anything we could have done differently 17 last year, that we could apply to the change or make 18 modifications to the plan? 19 So, hopefully, some of those things may be -- 20 may come out in the post-flood assessment that we'll 21 be looking at, that our adaptive management 22 committee is looking into. 23 SENATOR RITCHIE: And I know it was taken 24 under consideration, the flooding in Montreal. 25 And just for my own knowledge, what was done 26 1 to control the outflow from the Ottawa River, which 2 was then restricting what could be let out of the 3 Robert Moses Dam? 4 STEPHEN DURRETT: The Ottawa River 5 restrictions, I'm not familiar with because that's 6 in Canada. 7 I know, by talking to my Canadian 8 counterparts, many of their dams along the 9 Ottawa River were overflowing as they were, so they 10 were already past the ability to do any kind of 11 control whatsoever. 12 They had reached capacity, and it was just 13 the natural flow of river at that point. 14 There was no control mechanism available to 15 them. 16 SENATOR RITCHIE: So is there a way to ask 17 that that be looked at? 18 Because, if, in fact, there wasn't the issue 19 with the flooding in Montreal, and the outflow from 20 the Ottawa River could have been slowed down, then, 21 it looks like we would have been able to have a 22 greater release, which would have kept the damage 23 down on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. 24 So, I understand it's a bi-national 25 organization, but, how does that work, that the 27 1 Canadian board is asked to look at those issues 2 also? 3 STEPHEN DURRETT: Well, they're part of the 4 post-flood assessment. 5 So, the Canadian and the U.S. government will 6 both be looking at the post-flood assessment. 7 What could be done on the U.S. side, what 8 could be done on the Canadian side, that will all be 9 part of the post-flood assessment. 10 SENATOR RITCHIE: (Technical difficulties/no 11 audio.) 12 (Inaudible) what consideration was given to 13 the shipping? 14 I know a lot of people were hearing on the 15 news that, potentially, the water release was slowed 16 down because of shipping. 17 And what kind of consideration is given to 18 shipping, versus personal property, businesses, that 19 are affected by the high water? 20 [Member of the audience says \"They're 21 not.\"] 22 STEPHEN DURRETT: Consideration is given to 23 all interests (inaudible) upstream and downstream on 24 Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence Seaway. 25 So, there's no plan or a formula that says 28 1 one interest gets more -- more -- more benefit than 2 another. 3 We try to look at all things: trying to 4 balance the environment, trying to balance the 5 riparian owners, trying to balance the navigation 6 interests. 7 The navigation industry put in some extreme 8 measures because of the discharges we were 9 discharging out of Moses-Saunders, at 10,200. 10 They had to put some measures in place to 11 help some of their boats. 12 They limited the power on boats, so some 13 boats could not travel through the St. Lawrence 14 Seaway. They were not powered appropriately. 15 They also put some tugs to assist at some 16 very key points along the seaway, to make sure that 17 it was safe passage. 18 We did not want an environmental spill, and a 19 ship hitting a rock. 20 So all those things were put in place, not by 21 us, but by the Seaway itself. 22 So other interests were considered, and it's 23 a matter of balancing what is -- what's -- how much 24 water is too much water upstream, or how much water 25 is too much water downstream? 29 1 Discharging more than 10,400 will run the 2 St. Lawrence River out of its banks. 3 SENATOR RITCHIE: I guess I would just have 4 one comment for you to take -- one comment for you 5 to take back. 6 That if there is a mechanism in place that 7 ties your hands under this deviation authority, that 8 when it looks like there's a situation, going 9 forward, that you need to adjust for, if there's a 10 certain time frame for that to happen, or a level, 11 that maybe somebody who's making the decisions take 12 a look at that again, to untie the hands of the 13 people who have to make adjustments. 14 STEPHEN DURRETT: And we're hoping to get 15 that out of this post-flood assessment. 16 Is there anything we could have done 17 differently? we will document that in the post-flood 18 assessment. 19 SENATOR RITCHIE: Thank you. 20 SENATOR O'MARA: Assemblyman Oaks. 21 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: Yes, just to follow up on 22 that, so, at this point, there's nothing that's 23 happened -- you're going to do the assessment. 24 So there's nothing that's happened this year 25 that is changing your few tractions at this moment? 30 1 There could be something, depending on what 2 you find through your assessment? 3 SENATOR O'MARA: That is correct. 4 There is nothing that we think we could have 5 done differently this year, but the assessment may 6 tell us something different. 7 We, literally, had a region-wide, a regional 8 flood event, that spanned, not only one area, but 9 the entire region of Lake Ontario and the 10 St. Lawrence Seaway. 11 We had a lot of water that fell over several 12 months a period of time that doesn't normally fall 13 at that time of year. 14 June and July were extremely wet months as 15 well. That's not normally wet. 16 So we -- it was -- literally, was a 17 basin-wide event. 18 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: In the acceptance of 19 Plan 2014, when discussions were about that, people 20 raised concerns as we went through that process, one 21 of the things that was adopted, was to accept, 22 generally, that the plan allowed for higher heights 23 in certain years, and, also, lower lows, than what 24 the earlier maintenance plans did. 25 At what point this year -- and if you said it 31 1 in your remarks, just to, you know, reiterate that, 2 at what point this year did we meet what was the 3 acceptable or encouraged higher height as a part of 4 Plan 2014? 5 STEPHEN DURRETT: I don't know if there was 6 actually -- I did not say in it my remarks, but 7 there was not a point in time, I think, where we 8 could actually say that you've met -- you know, you 9 hit a point and you say, Oh, we're there. We need 10 to do something differently. 11 The lake rose extremely fast in the 12 March-April time frame. And it -- by the time-- and 13 there was, literally, nothing we could do. 14 The lake jumped 80 centimeters in a matter of 15 a couple of months, and it was all because of, like 16 I said, the basin-wide flooding. 17 We knew there was going to be problems, but 18 there was nothing we could do because there was no 19 place to send the water. 20 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: But if we look at, 21 I guess, and my concern, and your description of 22 this event, we know it rained a lot this year, and 23 we know there were, you know, various 24 considerations, and I know there's different 25 perspectives of why we ended up with what we have. 32 1 I'm very concerned about what happens next 2 year and the year after, and beyond, is the sense 3 that we have accepted more of higher water, and 4 where, other years, lower water than what's been the 5 norm, the impacts on those years that we have the 6 higher waters, the defense, I remember saying, well, 7 the increase is only a few inches. It's about like 8 a tennis-ball size. 9 But in -- and a number of people's concern 10 raised at that point was, in my understanding, every 11 other high-water event, '73, '92, that the incident 12 of the high water came quite quickly, and then it 13 went down. 14 And a concern of many of us was, 3 inches 15 sustained for months is going to, ultimately, have a 16 devastating effect on shorelines because we're going 17 to get weather events in that time. 18 And so the encouraged or acceptable levels 19 also become a great deal more damaging than what 20 high-water incidents were before. 21 So do you think future high-water incidents, 22 because of the plan, look for more sustained water, 23 that we can -- if we continue with the plan as is, 24 we're going to, on those high-water years, 25 anticipate property damage, either approaching or at 33 1 levels that we've seen this year? 2 STEPHEN DURRETT: I can't predict the 3 weather. And that's part our problem with doing 4 water management, is predicting the weather. 5 [Audience member says \"Can't hear you.\"] 6 STEPHEN DURRETT: Sorry. 7 Part of our problem is predicting the 8 weather, and we're not able to predict the weather 9 very well. 10 There is no one forecasted -- no weather 11 forecast said we were going to have the amount of 12 precipitation in 2017 that we had, for the whole 13 basin. Not just falling on just the Ottawa River or 14 falling on Lake Ontario, but it fell up and down the 15 entire basin, from the lower St. Lawrence, all the 16 way up through the entire Lake Ontario region. 17 So if we know that, then you can plan better. 18 We don't know what the weather forecast is 19 going to be. 20 We have a lot of evaporation that occurs on 21 Lake Ontario in the summer. 22 If you don't have -- if you try to hold the 23 lake too low, and you have a lot of evaporation, 24 we're going to have a lot of dry docks instead of 25 wet docks, because we just don't know the weather. 34 1 The thing is, we -- and by March -- the 2 middle of March of this year, 2017, we were the same 3 as we were in 2016. There was no difference between 4 '16 and '17. The lake rose just look it did in '16. 5 But the events then started in the April time 6 frame, April and May, June and July, were all 7 extremely wet months for the normal time of year. 8 That's not predicted. 9 Now, the lake will have a little bit higher 10 highs and a little bit lower lows under lake -- 11 under Plan 2014, under normal river -- normal 12 conditions. 13 But that's a normal condition. That's not 14 extreme conditions. 15 That's the key point I'd like to make, is we 16 had extreme wet weather, not in an area, but across 17 the entire region. And it's the weather and the 18 rainfall precipitation is what was the contributing 19 factor for high lake levels on Lake Ontario. 20 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: So you really can't say, 21 under the acceptability level under Plan 2014, at 22 what point it's kind of okay, and what point it's, 23 you know, not okay? 24 I understand we're going to be susceptible in 25 the future to whatever the weather is, but there's 35 1 some anticipating that can be done. 2 And, again -- or, outflow, you know, in the 3 future, if it reaches to the higher level, some 4 would say that there's property damage going to be 5 caused even at that upper level. And, certainly, 6 with a storm or two, that people are going to suffer 7 continually, irrespective of extreme high water, 8 because we're accepting a level that's above what 9 had been the norm. 10 STEPHEN DURRETT: And that's the purpose 11 of -- built into Plan 24 (sic) is this H14 criteria. 12 There's an upper and a lower band on this H14 13 criteria which allows that, as what you referred to 14 as, \"a little higher high and little lower lows,\" 15 that we try to stay within. 16 The plan operates, as long as you stay within 17 that band, the plan runs as the plan is set up to 18 run. 19 Once we exceed those levels, whether you 20 exceed them on the upper end or during a drought 21 when you exceed them on the lower end, only does 22 then does the board really come into play about 23 asking and looking for deviations. 24 That's how Plan 2014 is established and we're 25 supposed to operate. 36 1 We will be looking at those levels: Are 2 those triggers too high or too low? 3 Well, too low, we won't be able to look at it 4 very well. 5 But the \"too highs\" we can look at as part of 6 our assessment. Are the triggers too high? 7 I can't tell you the answer to that question. 8 I would say, at this point in time, the 9 answer would be, I don't think the triggers are too 10 high. But, our assessment may tell us that, yeah, 11 maybe the triggers are too high. 12 [Indiscernible audience comments.] 13 STEPHEN DURRETT: But -- so that's part of 14 the post-flood assessment. We will look at those 15 triggers, that H14 trigger elevation. 16 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Well, isn't that the 17 biggest different -- sorry, Bob. 18 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: Go ahead. 19 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Isn't that the biggest 20 difference between the old plan and the current 21 plan, that your hands are tied, because you can't -- 22 isn't it 248, is that the number, before you go -- 23 when you can deviate? 24 STEPHEN DURRETT: There's no set number. It 25 varies from the time of year, depending -- 37 1 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Well, you just 2 mentioned the -- 3 [Indiscernible audience comments.] 4 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Excuse me. 5 Excuse me. 6 [Indiscernible audience comments.] 7 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: I know. 8 Hold on. 9 Excuse me. 10 -- I just want to -- you mentioned \"the 11 bands.\" 12 Could you just tell us what the \"bands\" are? 13 STEPHEN DURRETT: It depends on what month of 14 the year you want to go. 15 The H14 bands that I was referring to, 16 there's a high H14 limit and there's a low band. 17 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: What are the numbers, 18 though? 19 STEPHEN DURRETT: Well, it changes from year 20 to year. I mean, I can't tell a number. 21 Pick a month, and I'll be able to tell you a 22 number. 23 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: All right. 24 Take -- take April or May, the spring, when 25 the water is high. 38 1 STEPHEN DURRETT: It's somewhere around 2 75.5 meters, approximately. 3 [Indiscernible audience comments.] 4 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: And then -- 5 Excuse me, excuse me. 6 Sorry. I can't have everybody yelling 7 questions. I can't hear. 8 And then how was -- what was the band under 9 the prior plan? 10 STEPHEN DURRETT: I can't tell you that. 11 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Okay. 12 All right. 13 Okay. 14 [Indiscernible audience comments.] 15 SENATOR O'MARA: You don't know what the 16 criteria was under Plan 1958? 17 STEPHEN DURRETT: No, I do not. 18 SENATOR O'MARA: Was the International Board 19 involved in the formulating of Plan 2014? 20 STEPHEN DURRETT: I have only been on the 21 board for 2 1/2 years, so, the Plan 2'14 was done 22 prior to me arriving at the board. 23 The IJC would be a better person to ask the 24 question to. 25 SENATOR O'MARA: All right. 39 1 Now, on these so-called \"trigger points,\" at 2 the high or the low, what action can you at the 3 board take, anticipating that trigger point being 4 exceeded? 5 STEPHEN DURRETT: Prior to the trigger point 6 being exceeded, we could ask permission to do a 7 deviation from the IJC. 8 Once the trigger point is achieved, we can 9 make deviations, and then we notify the IJC. 10 So, lower than the trigger, we have to ask 11 permission. 12 Higher than the trigger, we can -- actually, 13 we just do notification. 14 SENATOR O'MARA: It's my understanding that, 15 for the past several years, Lake Erie's water level 16 has been high. 17 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: That's correct. 18 SENATOR O'MARA: Is that your understanding? 19 STEPHEN DURRETT: Yes. 20 SENATOR O'MARA: And the flow of water from 21 Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is not controlled; 22 correct? 23 STEPHEN DURRETT: It is somewhat controlled, 24 yes. 25 SENATOR O'MARA: How is it controlled? 40 1 STEPHEN DURRETT: We control -- it's 2 minimally controlled, I'll say. 3 But there's -- the control is mostly over the 4 distribution of water between the United States and 5 Canada more than it is the flow over the falls 6 itself. 7 SENATOR O'MARA: And how high has Lake Erie 8 been over the past four or five years? 9 STEPHEN DURRETT: I don't know that number 10 off the top of my head. 11 SENATOR O'MARA: No? 12 It's my understanding that, in February of 13 this year, Lake Ontario levels rose as a result of 14 the elevated Lake Erie levels in February, and no 15 action was taken by the board at that point to deal 16 with that increase. 17 STEPHEN DURRETT: Lake Erie's flows have been 18 high for the last several years. 19 Yes. 20 ARUN HEER: I just want to say -- I just want 21 to mention, Bill Werick from the IJC is going to be 22 speaking next. He'll be able to answer your 23 questions concerning the plan formulation a lot 24 better than a board member here. 25 So I just wanted to prep you up for some of 41 1 these questions you might have. You're going to get 2 a better answer from the next speaker. 3 SENATOR O'MARA: Okay. 4 What's your name, and who are you from? 5 ARUN HEER: My name is Arun Heer. I'm the 6 U.S. secretary for the board. 7 SENATOR O'MARA: Thank you. 8 ARUN HEER: You're welcome. 9 Thank you. 10 STEPHEN DURRETT: So, I'm sorry. 11 Can you repeat your question, or, do you want 12 to save it for Bill? 13 SENATOR O'MARA: There was no anticipatory 14 actions taken by the board because of excess water 15 coming from Lake Erie because of its elevated state 16 in the month of February this year? 17 STEPHEN DURRETT: That is correct, because 18 there was no real need to. It did follow in a very 19 similar path to what it did in 2016. 20 In February -- the 2016 levels and 2017 were 21 about the same in February. 22 SENATOR O'MARA: How much are the riparian 23 landowners' rights considered in your determinations 24 of what to do with the outflows of Lake Ontario? 25 STEPHEN DURRETT: They're considered with 42 1 every other interest. 2 SENATOR O'MARA: Is it weighted at any 3 extent? 4 STEPHEN DURRETT: No. 5 SENATOR O'MARA: And what are those factors, 6 other than riparian rights? 7 STEPHEN DURRETT: There's environmental 8 interests. There's riparian interests. There's 9 navigation interests. And there's -- I'm missing 10 one. 11 [Member of the audience says \"power.\"] 12 STEPHEN DURRETT: -- power. 13 Thank you. 14 SENATOR O'MARA: Power? 15 What are those environmental interests? 16 STEPHEN DURRETT: A lot of those have to do 17 with the sudden rise and lowering, of whether it be 18 upstream or downstream. 19 It's mainly about fish habitat. 20 When you get into a flood event, the 21 environmental interests are very minimal. 22 SENATOR RITCHIE: I just have one follow-up 23 question. 24 Earlier you stated that there was -- you 25 noticed -- or, the board noticed that there was a 43 1 high water level and there was nothing that could be 2 done. 3 Can you just clarify what you mean by 4 \"nothing could be done\"? 5 STEPHEN DURRETT: Well, balancing all the 6 interests associated with it, you try to discharge 7 water out of Lake Ontario, it's gonna go impact 8 someone else. 9 The water downstream was already at record 10 levels as well. 11 There was no place to put the water. 12 The water, do I send it downstream? do I hold 13 it where I'm at? 14 It's a balancing act, when you're in a flood 15 event, as to how you manage water and where you 16 store it. 17 Discharging, and increasing discharges, will 18 have a very minimal impact on the level of 19 Lake Ontario because the lake is so large. 20 Increasing by 1,000 cubic meters per second 21 is a very small amount of impact on Lake Ontario, 22 but it could be devastating to what's downstream 23 because of the St. Lawrence Channel is so narrow. 24 So, we already were in a flood event 25 downstream. Changing something by a millimeter on 44 1 Lake Ontario could be several inches in -- on the 2 St. Lawrence River downstream. 3 SENATOR RITCHIE: And the flood event 4 downstream, was that mostly caused by the 5 Ottawa River? 6 STEPHEN DURRETT: And other tributaries, yes. 7 But the Ottawa River had record flooding. 8 SENATOR RITCHIE: Okay. 9 Then I guess, one last question: Once again, 10 do you believe that, if you had the ability to 11 release water before the situation with the 12 Ottawa River was at that level, it would have helped 13 the situation, or you don't believe it would have 14 made any difference? 15 STEPHEN DURRETT: I don't believe it would 16 have made any difference because, before the 17 Ottawa River and the flooding event going on, 18 I wouldn't have been wanting to release water. 19 I would have stayed within the normal guides 20 that tells our historical data from 1900. We have 21 115, 118 years of data, and we were within the 22 normal range, up till March. And then, all of a 23 sudden, in April and May, it shot through the roof, 24 but it shot through the roof everywhere across the 25 entire basin; not just on Lake Ontario, but the 45 1 entire basin, including the St. Lawrence River 2 Basin. 3 There was no place for the water to go. 4 SENATOR RITCHIE: I know I have grave 5 concerns after Senator O'Mara brought up the 6 controls on Lake Erie, and the fact that there's 7 minimum controls. 8 But the people that I represent in the 9 middle, their property was affected because of the 10 controls that were used at Robert Moses to keep from 11 flooding Montreal any worse than it already was. 12 So, I guess that is a question, that I would 13 hope it would be addressed when you go back, is 14 that: If the water levels are controlled and the 15 outflow is controlled, at some portions along the 16 system, then maybe Lake Erie ought to be controlled 17 a little more than minimally. 18 STEPHEN DURRETT: Okay. 19 SENATOR RITCHIE: Thank you. 20 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Just quickly following 21 up again, when did the board -- do you have a date 22 when the board realized that you might have to 23 deviate from the Plan 2014? 24 STEPHEN DURRETT: I don't have a date off the 25 top of my head, but I could give you a range, that 46 1 we probably were thinking -- 2 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Even a month. 3 STEPHEN DURRETT: -- have to deviate in the 4 April time frame. 5 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: And then what was the 6 band that they were in when you understood that this 7 was a flood condition where have to deviate from the 8 plan? 9 STEPHEN DURRETT: We were still below the H14 10 criteria. But, we saw the rise, and we were 11 starting to meet weekly, or every other week, and 12 starting to talk about water levels and predictions, 13 weather forecasts, and what we were gonna do, and 14 what could we do? 15 So we were meeting about every -- I'll say, 16 on average, every two weeks, starting in, probably, 17 the April time frame, all the way through August. 18 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: I can't -- the H -- 19 what was the band you called it? What was it -- 20 STEPHEN DURRETT: H14. 21 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: H14. 22 What is that in meters or inches? 23 I prefer inches, but I'll take meters. 24 STEPHEN DURRETT: In the April time frame, it 25 would be somewhere around, and it's kind of hard to 47 1 read off this chart, but about 246.8. 2 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Okay. Thank you. 3 STEPHEN DURRETT: That would be feet. 4 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Feet. Right. 5 I meant feet. Sorry. 6 SENATOR O'MARA: Thank you very much. 7 STEPHEN DURRETT: Thank you for your time. 8 SENATOR O'MARA: Next up, from the 9 International Joint Commission, Bill Werick, 10 technical advisor. 11 BILL WERICK: My name is Bill Werick. I'm 12 here representing the International Joint 13 Commission. 14 They asked that I attend because of a broad 15 technical understanding of the regulation of 16 Lake Ontario levels, and water resources more 17 globally. 18 I was the lead U.S. planner during the 19 Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River study in the 2000 to 20 2006 range. And I'm now a member of the IJC's 21 Great Lakes Adaptive Management Committee. 22 [Slide show begins.] 23 BILL WERICK: In my testimony today I will 24 make two points. 25 The first, is that IJC's regulation of 48 1 Lake Ontario levels substantially reduces flood 2 levels for people along the shore, but it does not 3 prevent them. These high levels are bound to happen 4 again. 5 The second point, is that any significant 6 reduction in high-water damages will require a 7 difficult, perhaps unprecedented level, of 8 collaboration and innovation, with roles for the 9 IJC, the state, local, and federal governments, and 10 landowners. 11 There is a history to this, and it is really 12 informative. 13 The IJC held its first meetings on this issue 14 back in 1920. 15 I'm from Buffalo, and I remember the 16 opposition to the seaway. 17 There were attempts for 30 years to get the 18 seaway built, and they were rebuffed. 19 On June 30, 1952, the two countries applied 20 to the IJC for approval of a power project, 21 including a hydropower dam. 22 Now, we think of dams as raising water 23 levels, but the regulation plan included in the 24 application was designed so that the project would 25 not raise the natural levels of Lake Ontario. 49 1 1952, coincidentally, the lake reached record 2 high levels in 1952. 3 These are pictures from the Rochester 4 Democrat & Chronicle, on Edgemere Drive near Dewey. 5 And the governments asked the IJC to study 6 whether, having regard for all other interests, 7 measures could be taken to regulate the level of 8 Lake Ontario for the benefit of property owners on 9 the shores of Lake Ontario. 10 So this is the difference. 11 In other words, could the project not just 12 protect against higher-than-natural water levels, 13 but actually lower them? 14 So the IJC held hearings on this in '52, '53, 15 and '55. 16 Higher lake levels are generally better for 17 producing power, and for providing water during 18 droughts for navigation on the river. 19 Hydropower interests argued that reducing 20 high levels would increase construction costs and 21 reduce power production. 22 And, of course, this was the 1950s, so there 23 was no consideration of the environmental impacts of 24 damming the St. Lawrence River. 25 Despite the costs of lost hydropower, the IJC 50 1 issued an order in 1956, with the criteria that 2 provided flood relief for Lake Ontario coastal 3 property owners. 4 The order prescribed a range of mean monthly 5 elevations for Lake Ontario, from 243.3, to 6 247.3 feet, as nearly as may be. 7 So what does that \"as nearly may be\" part? 8 It reflects the fact that this regulation 9 plan was designed by the engineers of the day, with 10 water levels from -- water supplies from 1860 to 11 1954. 12 So water supplies, since regulation began, 13 have included much wetter periods -- 14 You see the supplies on the right there in 15 red. 16 -- than were done historically. 17 And the IJC said, if you run into this, if 18 you have these higher supplies, you have to deviate 19 to protect riparian owners above and below the dam. 20 Looking at the graph of Lake Ontario levels, 21 it's pretty obvious that, in most years, the dam and 22 regulation did compress Lake Ontario levels, but you 23 can see there's still levels with very high levels. 24 So, in 1972, the Rochester Democrat & 25 Chronicle reported that Lake Ontario was the only 51 1 lake spared flooding on the Great Lakes because of 2 that new dam. 3 But a year later, the paper reported that 4 Lake Ontario had risen to damaging heights, not as 5 bad as it would have been without the dam -- with 6 the -- without the dam, but still damaging. 7 I know many of you remember that. 8 Another story from 1973 quoted Rochester 9 realtors questioning how homes along the shore could 10 be bought or sold. 11 There had been $3 million damage in '52. 12 The corps was saying, in 1973, the damages in 13 Monroe County alone would be 7 to 10 million. 14 That same year, the paper investigated 15 charges that Lake Ontario was being kept needlessly 16 high. 17 They concluded property owners would have 18 been worse off without the dam. 19 They reported, the IJC proposal, that year, 20 in 1973, the future lakeshore development should be 21 subject to strict zoning and setback regulations. 22 In 1993, just as the IJC was commissioning 23 another big study for all the Great Lakes, 24 Lake Ontario flooded again. 25 In its 1993 report, the IJC again advised 52 1 that the project was not capable of full control of 2 the water levels. 3 Commissioners recommended land-use and 4 management measures as the principal response to the 5 adverse consequences of fluctuating water levels. 6 Allowing the structural shore protection 7 might be the only alternative for 8 intensely-developed shorelines. 9 The study reported that most private 10 protection structures failed after 10 years, and 11 encouraged the use of better structures, with 12 provisions for inspection and approval of those 13 plans. 14 During the LOSLR study in the early 2000s, 15 we considered -- we had much better analytic tools, 16 and we considered a much broader range of water 17 supplies than had occurred historically. 18 We formed four teams that competed to produce 19 the best regulation plan. 20 We did statistical studies that showed the 21 lake could go much higher than it even had in 22 history. 23 Now, the board concluded that changes to the 24 criteria in the existing plan were not possible 25 without harming some interests. 53 1 The Plan '58D, with deviations, came close to 2 minimizing damages from Lake Ontario for the 3 property owners. 4 Because it reduced the range of rain -- the 5 range and the variability of Lake Ontario levels, 6 though, it also reduced the diversity of plant types 7 along the shore and populations of animal species 8 who feed on and live in the environments affected by 9 the reduced water-level ranges. 10 The board said that '58DD had caused 11 dewatering drawdowns in the fall, through the early 12 spring, to the detriment of some habitat and 13 species. 14 It took another 10 years of debate before 15 Plan 2014 was ratified by the governments of Canada 16 and the United States. 17 And in 2017, the first year of its 18 implementation, unprecedented weather condition 19 caused Lake Ontario to rise even higher than it had 20 in 1952. 21 As this graph shows, IJC -- you can see on 22 the top there, IJC regulations still lowered levels 23 below what would be occurring naturally. 24 And you can see on the bottom, as Mr. Durrett 25 had talked about, it's because the dam allows much 54 1 bigger releases than would have occurred naturally. 2 So, what should we do to prepare for future 3 high-water conditions? 4 My remarks reflect finding some other 5 studies, as well as those done by the IJC, and my 6 own experience in flood-damage reduction here, and 7 all around the world. 8 I'm a member of the Great Lakes Adaptive 9 Management Committee, and we will review how 10 Plan 2014 performed this year, but we already know 11 that the regulation plan can only do so much. 12 So the question then is: What else can we do 13 if we want real changes? 14 First, even though this is a very emotional 15 issue, it's really important that people stay 16 committed. 17 We know from experience, it's ironic, but 18 it's time of crises that makes people do long-term 19 strategic planning. 20 We're all here together, this issue is on the 21 table, but, in my experience, that window will 22 close. 23 In a few months, this will become an issue 24 that has -- people remember, but they haven't acted 25 on. 55 1 So it's really important that we stay engaged 2 and that we act soon. 3 Second, it's really important that we 4 recognize how difficult this will be. 5 So I see this happen all over the world, and 6 the sad news is, is that, as you saw in this history 7 here, that floods happen, and people get upset, and 8 they look at what could be done, and the interest 9 dies, and floods happen, and the cycle repeats 10 itself. 11 Part of that is because there are no easy 12 answers. 13 The kind of solutions that we might imagine 14 are not solutions that everybody says, oh, that 15 would be great, everybody is in favor of that. 16 Consider shore-protection damages, for 17 example. 18 As the commission had said, no structure will 19 last forever, but structures that are designed with 20 heavier stone and are -- which are taller and 21 designed for a 6 1/2-foot range will be more robust. 22 But they're more expensive, quite a bit more 23 expensive. 24 People often talk about floodplain management 25 as a solution. 56 1 I'm not really sure, we haven't gotten all 2 the data yet, but I think that floodplain management 3 actually has helped on Lake Ontario. 4 When I look at the new homes that have been 5 built, I think they are up higher, and that has 6 reduced flood damages. 7 Of course, there are a lot of older homes, 8 there's homes with basements. 9 And even when your home isn't flooded, 10 outbuildings may be flooded. You may have water on 11 the street that makes it very difficult to live your 12 life. 13 And, finally, there's the erosion to property 14 which has no shore protection, and this can be 15 really difficult. 16 This is going to happen no matter the 17 regulation plan, although, the regulation plan can 18 change the rate at which it happens. 19 Now, some people who have no shore protection 20 can build it, but it's very expensive, and there's 21 environmental concerns about shore protection too. 22 People are worried about hardening the shore. 23 I've talked to landowners who have said, 24 well, you know, when I lose the bank, I just drag my 25 cottage back closer to the road. 57 1 But, of course, there are limits to that. 2 It's not a satisfying solution at all. 3 And then the big question: What role should 4 government play in helping private-property owners? 5 And this is an issue that's been debated, not 6 just here, but everywhere in the United States and 7 in every country around the world. 8 And the answer is different in different 9 places, at different times. And there's a trade-off 10 between providing relief after a disaster and 11 providing protection before the disaster. 12 The IJC is involved in some efforts that may 13 help. 14 We're doing a study of flooding in the 15 Lake Champlain Basin. This just started. 16 The interesting thing there, is there is no 17 dam, so we're not talking about a regulation plan. 18 We're only talking about land-management 19 measures and flood-response plans; so, plans that 20 better forecast floods, and help towns put out 21 sandbags or other flood-control measures. 22 And, we recognized the interest in this is 23 bigger than Lake Champlain, and we want to make sure 24 that we share those results with you. 25 The IJC is also working with NOAA and Cornell 58 1 on flood forecasting and high-water response plans. 2 In sum, my two points: 3 Water-level regulation has helped, but it can 4 only do so much; 5 And the only hope for doing better in the 6 future, this is very difficult, it almost never 7 works, but there is hope if we work together. 8 Thanks so much for organizing this meeting. 9 This is the first time we've really had a 10 hearing that have brought -- that's brought all the 11 players together. 12 This is the most important thing, that we 13 start talking, and I really appreciate you doing 14 this. 15 And, I may be able to answer some questions 16 on Plan 2014. 17 SENATOR O'MARA: Okay. 18 Well, we really appreciate you being here as 19 well, and thank you for your testimony. 20 Would you like to start? 21 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Sure. 22 Could you explain -- I just -- I don't know 23 what the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River Adaptive 24 Management Committee is. 25 What is that? 59 1 BILL WERICK: That is -- that's a -- it's an 2 idea that's been talked about for a long time, but 3 hardly anybody in the world does it. 4 And the idea is, is that after you make a 5 decision, you continue to monitor the evidence to 6 make sure that your decision was right. 7 So, in other words, you think, if I do this 8 Plan 2014, we'll strike this kind of a balance 9 between hydropower and navigation and 10 shore-protection damages and the environment. 11 And, typically speaking, when those studies 12 are done, nobody then monitors every one of those 13 things and says, hey, we were right about that, but 14 wrong about that, and now let's think about 15 adjusting. 16 So in this case, the IJC has actually started 17 monitoring programs, and our intent is to continue 18 to watch, and in 15 years, or less, we will report 19 on that and say, we could do better or we could do 20 worse. 21 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: So it's a committee 22 that's put together by the IJC to give them advice 23 on all the state -- you know, what's happening with 24 all the different stakeholders -- 25 BILL WERICK: Exactly. 60 1 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: -- along (inaudible) -- 2 BILL WERICK: The actual results of the plan, 3 and what could be done better. 4 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Okay. 5 Were you involved in the Plan 2014, the 6 implementation of Plan 2014? 7 BILL WERICK: I was involved as a planner, so 8 I would run evaluation models, and -- yes. 9 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Could you just go 10 through that process? 11 Because I think a lot of people are 12 discouraged, the way Plan 2014 came in, and I think 13 people are suspicious, because it was implemented 14 in, what, December of -- what was it, last year; 15 right? 16 BILL WERICK: Exactly. 17 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: And, you know, I've 18 heard a lot of complaints, that there wasn't 19 public -- appropriate public input on 2014. 20 You know, you went through a lot of different 21 iterations with different plans. Some faded off. 22 And then, all of a sudden, this one came out in, 23 seemed like, the dead of night. 24 BILL WERICK: Sure. 25 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: So, maybe, if you could 61 1 explain the process that it went through for us. 2 BILL WERICK: So this is a process that 3 probably, you could say, it started in the 4 late '80s, with the Great Lakes Levels Reference 5 Study. 6 The first -- during the study that 7 I participated in, and I know many of you did too, 8 from 2000 to 2006, we had teams competing to produce 9 better plans. 10 And that study board made recommendations to 11 the IJC for three different plans, and each one had 12 a different nature, they stressed different balance 13 of results. 14 And there was a plan called \"B+,\" which was 15 more natural levels, and that's the predecessor to 16 Plan 2014. 17 The next several years, people -- the IJC had 18 hearings on a plan that they called \"Plan 2007.\" 19 It was rejected by almost everybody. 20 They came back with other studies. 21 That B+ plan became Bv7, and there were many 22 public hearings on that, with the people opposed and 23 people supporting it, just as 2014 was. 24 And they held a series of public hearings all 25 along the south shore, before they wrote their 62 1 report to governments recommending Plan 2014. 2 So, full public involvement up to that point. 3 Now, once the IJC sends it to the 4 governments, then the state department and 5 department of foreign affairs each do consultations 6 within their countries. 7 And at that point, I don't -- I'm an outsider 8 to that process. 9 So, basically, at that point, each country is 10 looking at it in their own interests. And then they 11 have negotiations, and they come back together. 12 And, for me, that period of time was more 13 opaque. 14 But they, basically, accepted the 15 recommendations of the IJC, with some minor edits. 16 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Is the board fully -- 17 all the appointees still on the IJC? 18 Has Trump made his appointees? 19 BILL WERICK: There are no new appointees by 20 either the Prime Minister or the President. 21 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: No new. 22 Are there vacancies? 23 BILL WERICK: They're all people that were on 24 the commission from years ago. 25 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: There are no vacancies 63 1 currently? 2 BILL WERICK: There's one vacancy on the U.S. 3 side. 4 Is there a vacancy on the Canadian side? 5 No. 6 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: And then the Adaptive 7 Management Committee, how many members are on that 8 committee? 9 BILL WERICK: I think there are -- I would 10 say ten. 11 I can get you the list of people. 12 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Anyone from the 13 southern or eastern end of Lake Ontario? 14 BILL WERICK: I'd have to look. 15 Nobody comes to mind. 16 These are mostly agency people, so the Corps 17 of Engineers has representatives. 18 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: I mean, I think -- 19 again, my concern is, and I think a concern of a lot 20 of my constituents, is our voice isn't being heard 21 by the IJC. 22 I think we feel like, with the implementation 23 of the Plan 2014, that the southern and eastern end 24 of Lake Ontario are the losers in that process. 25 So it would be nice to know at least there's 64 1 a voice there, and someone hearing the concerns of, 2 particularly, the property owners along the lake. 3 BILL WERICK: Well, let's solve that problem, 4 because the committee certainly knows that it has to 5 have that connection. 6 And we're in the process now of trying to 7 establish those connections. 8 And what we're looking for, really, is 9 somebody from the community who speaks for the 10 community. 11 They can be skeptical. They can be against 12 Plan 2014. As long as they're willing to work with 13 us, and express the views of the community, we see 14 that as an essential thing. 15 So, that's something we'd like to fix. 16 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: All right. Let's do 17 that. 18 Thank you. 19 SENATOR O'MARA: Patty? 20 SENATOR RITCHIE: And can I just ask for you 21 to follow up on a previous speaker? 22 As far as the deviation authority, do you 23 believe that has changed with Plan 2014? 24 BILL WERICK: There are changes, and some of 25 them are kind of technical. But when you look at 65 1 the actual instruction to the board, it's almost 2 identical. 3 But the condition -- in other words, the old 4 Criterion K under the old plan said, when supplies 5 are greater than the supplies of the past, do 6 everything you can for riparians above and below the 7 dam. 8 The question was: When are supplies greater 9 than the past? 10 It was a very fuzzy notion. 11 Now we have the trigger levels, so that the 12 triggering mechanism is very precise and clear, and 13 the instruction is about the same. 14 It's when the water -- when the -- you exceed 15 the trigger levels, do everything possible for 16 riparians above and below the dam. 17 SENATOR RITCHIE: Do you believe the trigger 18 level is set too high, given what's happened this 19 past year? 20 BILL WERICK: No, and I'll say that for two 21 reasons. 22 The first is, is that, when you look back at 23 this with the benefit of hindsight, you say, boy, if 24 we had started releasing 10,000 cubic meters per 25 second way back when, this would have been better 66 1 off. 2 But the fact is, is that, as Mr. Durrett 3 said, our forecasts for one month out are really not 4 very skillful. 5 You can look back at the forecasts that 6 people made at that time, and they missed this 7 completely. 8 So, for instance, 2016 looked very much like 9 2017. And had you done that, you would have made 10 the lower levels of 2016. 11 Lake Ontario ended up below average, much 12 lower. 13 So you have to kind of play the odds. 14 The second thing is, is that Plan 2014 builds 15 in a lot of the decision-making that the board used 16 to do anyway, so that, as the water levels rose 17 higher, and as Mr. Durrett talked, they were 18 operating under this F limit. 19 They were releasing as much water as they 20 could, balancing the flooding that was occurring 21 downstream. 22 And, in fact, the best test of that is that, 23 when they finally got to the end of April and hit 24 the trigger, they continued to use that same F-limit 25 strategy for some time. 67 1 So you could argue that, from a mechanical 2 viewpoint, once they hit the trigger, they were 3 already doing everything they could to lower 4 Lake Ontario level. 5 SENATOR RITCHIE: And the previous speaker 6 spoke about meeting every two weeks, which that 7 probably does not sound great to people who were 8 dealing with the water levels on an -- any given 9 hour, how much it was fluctuating. 10 So is there -- will that be taken into 11 consideration, that maybe there should be more, 12 either on-the-ground people seeing what's actually 13 happening here, or meeting more regularly, so things 14 can be changed at a quicker pace? 15 BILL WERICK: I'll let -- Mr. Durrett, 16 correct me if I'm wrong -- but I know, from 17 monitoring the situation, that there is a -- what 18 they call \"the coordinating committee\" that advises 19 the board. These are technical guys. 20 And these guys are looking at electronic 21 readouts of all of these measurements, and they are 22 constantly talking to one another. 23 So this is not something that they check in 24 every two weeks. This is something that they watch 25 all day long. 68 1 SENATOR RITCHIE: And I know there was great 2 concern by the people that I represent, that 3 Montreal's interests were being represented at maybe 4 a higher level than our own, given the fact that the 5 Ottawa River was a pretty significant contributing 6 factor. 7 What will be done in working with the 8 Canadians to try to address the outflow from the 9 Ottawa River, if that's what significantly decreased 10 the ability of the Robert Moses Dam to release 11 water? 12 BILL WERICK: You know, we are in the process 13 now of outlining our report on this year. 14 And I would say, one of the things that we 15 can do with you, and with the representatives we 16 work with, is try to articulate those questions that 17 are on everybody's mind. 18 My gut feeling now, is that there isn't much 19 that could have been done about the Ottawa River 20 discharge. 21 But let's make that, and other questions, 22 part of that report, and we'll try to have a really 23 good answer for that. 24 Because, this is the hard part, it's really 25 important that we establish a factual basis for any 69 1 modifications we make in the future, whether it's to 2 the regulation plan or to other decisions that are 3 made. 4 So, we'll work with you to develop a list of 5 questions that that report should answer. 6 SENATOR RITCHIE: Because I personally am 7 concerned that the people that I represent are 8 getting the squeeze on both ends. 9 That, now it comes out that Lake Erie is 10 minimally controlled, and what was possibly been 11 able to happen to help in the middle, couldn't 12 happen because of the situation in Montreal. 13 So, if this is going to be a solution to the 14 problem as a whole, how do we make sure that the 15 Lake Erie part of the conversation and the 16 Ottawa River part of the conversation is held 17 accountable to the same level? 18 BILL WERICK: You know, we can -- we can 19 answer those questions. 20 I grew up on Lake Erie, and I can say with 21 even more confidence, that Lake Erie will not be 22 regulated. 23 I mean, they have looked at that in the past, 24 and the downsides to it are so great, that it almost 25 isn't even worth asking anymore. 70 1 So I -- that -- I can answer you now, that 2 Lake Erie is not going to be regulated, unless the 3 world changes a lot. 4 SENATOR RITCHIE: And if there are 5 recommendations put forward, how does the plan 6 actually get changed by, whose authority? 7 BILL WERICK: Yeah, that's a good question. 8 I mean, if you look at the names of these 9 plans, 1958, 2014, you realize these plans don't 10 change very often, and it's because they are so 11 important to so many people, and they require a 12 buy-off -- an international buy-off between the two 13 countries. 14 That said, because of the Great Lakes 15 Adaptive Management Committee, we want to be open to 16 great ideas, and there is a mechanism for us to 17 report back to the IJC. 18 I don't see us making any enormous 19 breakthroughs. But, if we can find ways to tweak 20 the plan to make it better, then we have complete 21 freedom to recommend those things to the IJC. 22 SENATOR RITCHIE: And my last question: Do 23 you believe the people who are dealing with the 24 damage this year, are they going to be dealing with 25 the same situation next year, or the year after? 71 1 BILL WERICK: Boy, I have no idea, and I'm 2 saying that not casually, because I've tried very 3 hard to make those projections. 4 If you look at 2015, 2016, and 2017, and you 5 look at Lake Ontario and Lake Erie levels, they're 6 all pretty similar, and yet each one of those years 7 turned out so differently. 8 It's -- I will say that, over the next 9 20 years -- as you saw, I showed you pictures of 10 floods in '43, '47, '52, '73, and '93. 11 Over the next 20 years this will probably 12 happen again. 13 Climate change, the very warm winters, this 14 may make it more likely. 15 But, next year, I have no idea. 16 SENATOR RITCHIE: Thank you. 17 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: Your giving the historical 18 perspective was helpful, I think, in seeing how 19 things have developed over those years, and your 20 contention that, without the dam, without the 21 seaway, this year probably would have been worse 22 than if there was nothing there. 23 I think I can, you know, understand. 24 However, under the new terms, and looking 25 forward, we're saying we're going to manage it less. 72 1 And so we have the opportunity -- we 2 controlled, and we tried to stay here, and 3 conditions have taken us outside of it in different 4 years. But now we're saying we're opening it up. 5 And so I guess one of my questions, in 6 looking at it: 7 '43, '47, '52, that's good history. 8 Do we have any sense -- and I didn't see -- 9 you know, we have the chart showing this. 10 Do we have any sense of days of flooding that 11 occurred those years, as well as '73 and '92, 12 compared to 2017, which that flooding sustained? 13 And, does the plan -- I guess as a follow-up, 14 does the plan encourage more days that we then have 15 to deal with higher waters and potential for 16 flooding? 17 BILL WERICK: Okay. 18 So, this is a good question to ask, and 19 answer more formally in the report, but let me make 20 some general comments off the top of my head. 21 The first is the obvious, that it's -- 22 I understand that it's cold comfort to say it would 23 have been worse with the dam, because this is the 24 worst flood that's ever happened in -- since the 25 Civil War on Lake Ontario. 73 1 And, you know, I've worked on flooding since 2 1969. And I know that if you go through a flood, 3 people just don't understand how terrible that is 4 until you've gone through it. 5 So I know it offers cold comfort. 6 The next thing I would say is that, 7 Plan 2014, as the IJC has reported, does produce 8 higher highs and lower lows. 9 That generally happens in the middle highs, 10 in the middle lows. That's where you'll see a 11 difference. 12 And there are impacts to things along the 13 shore that are in that elevation range. 14 So Mayor Turtenac (ph.) is in the audience 15 tonight, and we've talked about parts of Sodus that 16 are vulnerable in that medium-high range. 17 Shore-protection structures that are not 18 built as high are going to be more susceptible to 19 overtopping, and that's why the damage figures for 20 Plan 2014 are a little higher. 21 Now, as the floods get worse, the new plan 22 gets to be more like the old plan, for two reasons: 23 One is, is that it doesn't do us much good 24 for the environment to have floods, so there's no 25 impetus in the plan rules to say, oh, let's have a 74 1 flood, it will be good for the environment. 2 The plan does try to control flooding. 3 And -- so, especially, once you get to the 4 deviations, there's really no difference between the 5 plans, and this is where you get the tennis-ball 6 comparison. 7 In real life, most of the time, with moderate 8 floods, Plan 2014 will have slightly higher water 9 levels, and that's because it's keeping the levels 10 higher in the fall and the spring for the benefit of 11 wetlands and everything that lives on there. 12 As the water levels get higher, the two plans 13 will be more alike. 14 Every once in a while Plan 2014 is better for 15 shoreline residents than the old plan because it 16 also does lower lows. 17 So if you have a year where Plan 2014 draws 18 the lake down, and have a flood the next year, and 19 this is not the majority, maybe one in five, then 20 the new plan is actually better. 21 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: Your -- the plan does 22 call, my recollection is, that over a 20-year 23 period, when we've typically seen a flooding event 24 in a 20-year period that we might see because of 25 higher highs, that happened, maybe, three times 75 1 during that 20-year period, is that the estimate of 2 the plan, and similar on lower water as well? 3 Or is -- 4 BILL WERICK: The -- if you look at the 5 frequency of stages, Plan 2014 tends to have more 6 frequent middle-high levels, and then they start to 7 go back together on the higher levels. 8 And as far as the sequence, there are people 9 that argue that there are some sorts of cycles at 10 work here. 11 If you go out to North Dakota, you can see it 12 on a lake called Devil's Lake, that it almost 13 disappeared in the '40s, and then it came back, 14 and had enormous floods in the '90s and 2000s. 15 I think people who live along the lake would 16 remember this, the '60s as a low-water period. We 17 had lots of years where Lake Ontario was low. It 18 seemed to be a persistent multi-year thing. 19 And the '70s, '80s, and '90s were 20 considered wet. 21 And then the 2000s, and going into 2015, was 22 considered a low-water condition. 23 So we had, not on Lake Ontario which is 24 regulated, but up on Lake Superior, and 25 Lake Michigan and Huron, people were very upset 76 1 because the lake was so low. 2 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: On the business interests, 3 I guess just in this thinking, I mean, this was 4 because of the days of flooding and the damage done. 5 BILL WERICK: Yes. 6 ASSEMBLYMAN OAKS: For many, this was a lost 7 season of recreational boating, of marinas, of 8 businesses that serve people, et cetera. 9 Is that -- again, the concern would be, a lot 10 of our economy is driven by those. 11 With this plan, are we setting those 12 businesses up to have other lost summers, or is 13 there a way to minimize the days even in those 14 high-water times -- minimize the lost days, you 15 know, and trying to narrow those events? 16 BILL WERICK: So with the very high events, 17 I would say there won't be much difference. 18 I think this year was a particular year where 19 we said, we really can't see any difference between 20 2014 and the old plan, and in part, that is because 21 the fall levels were set by the old plan. 22 As you get into moderate flood years, there 23 will be marinas that start to suffer business losses 24 before other marinas do, and Plan 2014 will tend to 25 be a little worse for them. 77 1 SENATOR O'MARA: Again, thank you. 2 One thing that I'm having trouble 3 comprehending here, is where you say that a dam 4 along the St. Lawrence River actually helps lower 5 Lake Ontario levels. 6 BILL WERICK: Yeah. 7 SENATOR O'MARA: Can you expound on that a 8 little bit? 9 BILL WERICK: Sure. 10 I mean, it's -- you think of a dam as, like a 11 beaver, builds a dam and the level goes up. 12 So the difference is -- and I just worked on 13 the study on Rainy Lake in northern Minnesota, and 14 the dam cannot bring the lake down. 15 So if you look at an undammed situation, the 16 water that flows out of a lake will be a function of 17 how high the lake is. 18 You can't have a big discharge unless the 19 lake is really high. 20 But what was different about the St. Lawrence 21 project, and this is what the hydropower companies 22 complained about, is that they did excavations. 23 So now the board has the ability to create 24 much greater discharges than they would have without 25 the dam, because of that excavation, and because of 78 1 that they can actually lower water levels. 2 SENATOR O'MARA: Can you talk a little bit 3 about, you know, we're here as New York State 4 Legislators, representing the south shore and the 5 eastern shore and the river. 6 We haven't heard much, at least I haven't, 7 about damage around the rest of the lake, the north 8 shore, the west shore. 9 What were the impacts of those shorelines 10 throughout this year? 11 BILL WERICK: The Great Lakes Adaptive 12 Management Committee is trying to collect damages 13 for the north shore, south shore. 14 We're working with the New York Sea Grant and 15 Cornell to do that. 16 And then we're also trying to get the damages 17 downstream, and separate the St. Lawrence-related 18 damages from all the other flooding that Quebec had. 19 In general, I think that the north shore had 20 less damage. 21 SENATOR O'MARA: Was that expected in the 22 Plan 2014 considerations? 23 Because I kind of recall that being an 24 expectation. 25 BILL WERICK: I would expect it, yes. 79 1 I think, and this is something we were trying 2 to document, that Canada has taken more aggressive 3 measures to reduce its vulnerability to flooding. 4 Also, northwest and northeast winds are 5 really harmful to the south shore, whereas they 6 aren't to the north shore. 7 SENATOR O'MARA: You mentioned in your 8 presentation that Plan 1958DD came close to minimal 9 damage from the regulation. 10 BILL WERICK: Yes. 11 SENATOR O'MARA: So, 1958DD was particularly 12 designed to minimize shoreline damage? 13 BILL WERICK: Almost. 14 I mean, it does -- '58D also balanced all the 15 different interests. But, during that study, we -- 16 we -- basically, we created these things called 17 \"fence-post plans.\" 18 What if we disregarded everybody else, except 19 hydropower, how much good could we do for 20 hydropower? 21 What if we disregarded everybody else, except 22 riparians, how much good we could do? 23 And you could do a little bit better than 24 '58DD if you didn't care about anybody else in the 25 system, which, of course, I have to say is forbidden 80 1 by the treaty. 2 But we said '58DD is pretty close to as much 3 you can do with that dam and channel. 4 SENATOR O'MARA: So changing it to Plan 2014 5 by -- basically, raising it by about 2-1/2 inches? 6 BILL WERICK: The highest level by about 7 2-1/2 inches, yeah. 8 SENATOR O'MARA: The highest levels, yeah, 9 and the lowest levels. 10 It was known that there would be an increase 11 to property damage -- 12 BILL WERICK: Yes. 13 SENATOR O'MARA: -- as a result of that, when 14 you exceeded those highs? 15 BILL WERICK: We -- we -- our models expected 16 that. 17 Now, we're going back to check that too. 18 SENATOR O'MARA: Yeah. 19 Yet, in Plan 2014, in the IJC, and, frankly, 20 the countries of Canada and the United States, did 21 not provide any remuneration for the shoreline 22 property owners for that expected damage? 23 BILL WERICK: That's correct. 24 SENATOR O'MARA: Do you know why that was? 25 BILL WERICK: I would say -- I would say 81 1 that, as I showed in the historical slides, the IJC 2 had to approve the dam. 3 They were required by the treaty to protect 4 riparian interests. 5 So they had to assure that the water levels, 6 because of that dam, would be no higher than they 7 would be without the dam. 8 That's when the treaty would have required 9 mitigation. 10 In either case, Plan 2014 or '58DD, water 11 levels are substantially below natural levels, so 12 that's why it wouldn't be required. 13 Now, my argument is, set aside the treaty 14 requirements, look at the problem, that there are 15 damages, and ask with an open mind and heart, what 16 could be done? 17 Understanding, that there are many people who 18 believe that government shouldn't help private 19 property owners in these circumstances, but also 20 arguing that, in almost every case, and we've seen 21 so many of these stories on the news, government 22 does help to pay for damage after it has occurred. 23 It just doesn't like to pay for damage before 24 it occurs. 25 So this is why I'm calling for an open-minded 82 1 collaborative approach. 2 It's going to be very difficult. 3 There are not many communities who solved 4 this problem, but, it's worth a try. 5 And this interest is only going to be 6 sustained for a few more months. 7 SENATOR O'MARA: Now, the trigger points, the 8 highs and the lows under the new plan, those are 9 based off of the average high for that time of year, 10 and the average -- or, the -- I'm sorry -- the 11 average of the extreme high for that time of year 12 and the extreme low of that time of year? 13 BILL WERICK: The high levels represent, 14 I think, the 2 percent exceedance frequency. 15 So they're a fairly high level, and they were 16 based on experimentation that was done with 17 different levels, watching the trade-off between 18 economic and environmental benefits. 19 So they varied throughout the year, just like 20 Lake Ontario does. 21 SENATOR O'MARA: Yeah, but I guess what I'm 22 getting at is, averaging off of the extreme highs 23 and the extreme lows, why didn't the commission take 24 a median approach, as opposed to an average of the 25 extremes? 83 1 And do you know what the difference is over 2 the years between the median and the extreme highs 3 and lows in that average? 4 BILL WERICK: So let me say this: 5 That the H14 high triggers represent the 6 levels that would be reached about 2 percent of the 7 time, so they don't relate to the median. 8 These are all about the frequency of those 9 high levels. 10 And we actually simulated these things, and 11 we would try 1 percent, we would try 2 percent, we'd 12 try different levels, and we would watch all our 13 models to see what results came out. 14 And it is finally the governments that 15 decided on the \"295\" that became part of the new 16 orders. 17 SENATOR O'MARA: Just in my mind, it seems 18 like using a median, or what happens more often, 19 rather than using the extremes, we base these 20 numbers on the extreme. 21 So now we're basing it at 2-1/2 inches higher 22 than what our extremes are in history has been, 23 rather than what a normal year is. 24 BILL WERICK: It is based on higher levels. 25 The lower you make those trigger points, the 84 1 less damage you would have, and the more the plan 2 becomes like '58DD, bad for the environment, but 3 causing less damage. 4 That was the -- that's the balance that you 5 strike as you adjust those triggers. 6 SENATOR O'MARA: Well, if the dam was 7 designed not to change the water levels of 8 Lake Ontario, which you said it was -- 9 BILL WERICK: Yes, it was designed to reduce 10 the water levels. 11 SENATOR O'MARA: Yeah. 12 BILL WERICK: The high levels. 13 SENATOR O'MARA: -- so, I don't follow how we 14 then had to alter it later on, to have a more 15 environmentally-friendly ebb and flow of the level 16 of the lake. 17 BILL WERICK: This was a decision that the 18 two governments made, to recognize that the 19 environment is an interest that both countries have, 20 and is protected by the treaty. 21 The 1950s is -- I mean, I'll say, when 22 I started out with the Corps of Engineers in the 23 '60s as a summer school -- summer student at 24 Conesus, I worked in the Cuyahoga River, and I had 25 to wear -- in the summertime, I had to wear rubber 85 1 gear from head to foot, because we knew that you 2 couldn't let river water touch your skin. 3 So that was the climate under which '58DD was 4 designed. There was absolutely no interest in the 5 environment. 6 On the LOSLR study, we tried to do something 7 for the environment, while doing as little damage as 8 we could to the shoreline protection damages. 9 SENATOR O'MARA: What in Plan 2014 will allow 10 the international board to make anticipatory changes 11 before that trigger point is hit? 12 BILL WERICK: The board can't deviate until 13 it hits the trigger. 14 But as Mr. Durrett said, even before they 15 hit the trigger, they were operating under the 16 F limit. 17 So Plan 2014 really incorporates the 18 knowledge of board representatives, and guys like 19 David Fay (ph.) who's in the audience, because it's 20 the intent of Plan 2014 to avoid those floods. 21 And, those rules are based on tests with 22 50,000 years of different possible inflow, so 23 there's many different ways that Lake Ontario can 24 flood. 25 So even before you hit the trigger, Plan 2014 86 1 is trying to reduce those water levels. 2 When it comes to the trigger, then the board 3 is free to do much more, it can go off the plan. 4 Now, in this year, they still stayed on the 5 F limit because the plan was good. 6 SENATOR O'MARA: So the board then can 7 increase outflows from the river before the lake 8 level hits that trigger level? 9 BILL WERICK: Plan 2014 will increase 10 releases naturally, generically, as part of the 11 code. 12 SENATOR O'MARA: Okay. 13 You suggested in your remarks that the 14 outflow from Lake Champlain might be looked at, as 15 far as damming that lake. 16 You didn't mention anything in your remarks 17 about controlling the outflow from the Ottawa River 18 which was a factor in the flooding this year. 19 BILL WERICK: No. 20 SENATOR O'MARA: What -- what's the 21 distinction there? 22 BILL WERICK: First of all, we're not going 23 to look at damming Lake Champlain. 24 So the last dam study that I got involved in, 25 it lasted 30 years, and at the end of the 30-year 87 1 study the dam was rejected. 2 So we're not building many dams anymore. 3 So we're not gonna even think about building 4 a dam on Lake Champlain. 5 That's why the focus is all on the land-side 6 measures, and then, also, flood response plans. So 7 helping communities respond better to floods so that 8 they can minimize the damage. 9 On the Ottawa River, this is one of the 10 questions we'll answer better and more formally than 11 I can do right now. 12 My belief is, that the Ottawa River has some 13 regulation in the upper part of the basin, but it 14 has very little impact, and this year had almost no 15 impact. 16 So, we'll answer it more carefully, but 17 I would say there's very little hope that 18 controlling the Ottawa River can make things better. 19 SENATOR O'MARA: Okay. 20 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Just one quick 21 question. 22 I'm a little confused on your flooding 23 comment you made about flooding not being good for 24 the environment, so Plan 2014 does not, I guess -- 25 BILL WERICK: Yes. 88 1 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: -- regulates against, 2 I assume you're saying, extreme flooding. 3 But the whole idea is to have water flow into 4 the wetlands and have an ebb and flow. 5 But, I guess, if you're a property owner, and 6 that ebb and flow is ruining your property, you 7 would consider it a flood. 8 I mean, am I understanding your -- you're 9 talking about extreme flooding? Is that what -- 10 BILL WERICK: That's really the difference. 11 So, Plan 2014 -- so, typically, a dam 12 operator who's only worried about flooding, because 13 there's always uncertainty about what's gonna happen 14 in the spring, they will lower the dam levels, just 15 in case. 16 The thing is, is that if you do that, then 17 every year the wetlands are flooded less, and that 18 has an impact on wetlands. 19 So to produce a higher level of water on the 20 wetlands, and we're not talking a flooding level, 21 just a higher level, then you slightly increase the 22 risk that you will have floods later on. 23 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Why did the Plan 2014 24 take away the discretion of the control board? 25 I don't -- I mean, you can say this is our 89 1 policy. We want to have a more ebb and flow. You 2 guys gotta follow through with our policy. 3 But why tie their hands and have certain 4 higher, you know, catch levels? 5 BILL WERICK: I think it's a good thing, 6 although people will argue about it. 7 I think Frank Sciremammano would say that I'm 8 wrong. 9 Here's the difference, is that when the board 10 confronts a decision, and its hands aren't tied, 11 then it makes a reactionary decision, that has a 12 little amount of time to study what the 13 possibilities are. 14 Sometimes it does good, and sometimes it does 15 bad. 16 With more regulation, you have the benefit of 17 studying these things with many more tests. 18 So the rules of Plan 2014 have been tested to 19 a much greater degree than the board decisions could 20 have been in the old days. 21 And, in fact, when the IJC first had hearings 22 on Plan 2007, this was a discussion because 2007 was 23 not an environmental plan. It was at least as good 24 at '58DD for shoreline owners. And it was all 25 automated the same way, with very little deviation. 90 1 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: And then how are they 2 going to judge the success of Plan 2014 with the 3 environment? 4 Are you going to say we got more 5 Northern Pike, and that's a success? 6 And the costs of that, I guess, that's a hard 7 thing for us, at least get my arms around, is, 8 obviously, because, potential, it would be very 9 costly to the property owners along the lake, and 10 what the return benefit. 11 And it's great to have, I think we're all 12 environmentalists. We would love to have more fish 13 and wildlife, and everything, but, is it worth the 14 cost? 15 So what -- what's going into that plan? 16 BILL WERICK: It's always going to be 17 controversial because you can't monetize all 18 environmental benefits. 19 I mean, some you can. Some you just can't. 20 I mean, there will be some environmental 21 benefits that will probably translate to real 22 economic benefits. 23 But we will try to at least quantify. 24 So what we've been doing for 10 years, is 25 sending biologists out into the field to actually 91 1 measure how much of the wetlands are covered by 2 different types of plants. 3 So continuing to gather evidence to see 4 whether or not wetlands change as we expected them 5 to. 6 Both the Corps of Engineers and New York 7 State DEC have gone out, and they've measured the 8 top elevations of shore-protection structures along 9 the south shore, because we want to make sure that 10 our models actually predicted the failure of 11 shore-protection structures correctly. 12 And now with the damage reporting that we're 13 doing with Cornell and New York Sea Grant, we'll 14 actually try to see whether our damage estimates 15 were reasonable. 16 Beyond that, we're trying to encourage even 17 broader monitoring. The Northern Pike is one 18 example. 19 I think that there are efforts underway 20 by the State University of New York to count 21 Northern Pike. 22 And we'll try to compare those to what they 23 would be in other years, to see whether we're really 24 getting a benefit or not. 25 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Thank you. 92 1 BILL WERICK: We'll try to produce the 2 evidence. 3 ASSEMBLYMAN BARCLAY: Good. 4 SENATOR RITCHIE: Did you say earlier that 5 response was part of Plan 2014, a response to 6 flooding? 7 BILL WERICK: Yes. 8 SENATOR RITCHIE: I guess I would ask, did 9 anybody come to the local areas to prepare them for 10 what they might see, or what the extremes would be, 11 so they weren't taken by surprise? 12 Because I know most of the people here 13 thought there was, maybe, a two-week period they 14 were gonna have to live with the high water, and 15 possibly they could get through it. But it lasted 16 all summer until Labor Day. 17 So I'm just wondering, did anybody prepare 18 them for what the plan was going to mean to the 19 people who live here? 20 BILL WERICK: You know, we could always do 21 better. 22 And not knowing what the future would bring 23 limited the ability for us to forewarn people. 24 But I -- and I'm not on the board, but I did 25 watch modern tools, like Facebook. 93 1 There was a lot of advertising of this, and 2 so I think a lot of people in the audience were 3 watching Facebook and saw this as it rolled out. 4 Personally, I think that if we could make the 5 connections with the community to work with the 6 Great Lakes Adaptive Management Committee, that we 7 could establish better networks. 8 In our experience, communication works better 9 if you talk to community networks that already 10 exist. And we need to establish those. 11 So any help we can get with that, we would 12 appreciate. 13 SENATOR RITCHIE: Okay. 14 Thank you. 15 SENATOR O'MARA: What were the estimates of 16 damage that the IJC considered in coming up with 17 Plan 2014? 18 BILL WERICK: For Plan 2014, we had a model 19 that looked at damages to shore-protection 20 structures, to first-floor flooding in homes, and to 21 erosion of unprotected parcels that had buildings on 22 them. 23 And this had never been done before. 24 The difference in technology between 2000 and 25 1980 was, of course, enormous. 94 1 So we were able to make these whole-lake 2 estimates of how individual storm events would 3 damage shore-protection structures, and so we had 4 the dollar estimates. 5 SENATOR O'MARA: But what were the dollar 6 estimates? 7 BILL WERICK: They -- I don't have them in 8 mind, but I can get you a copy of the Plan 2014 9 report that has actual dollar damage limits. 10 What you would see there is that the vast 11 majority, something like 87 percent of the damage 12 that occurs, is to shore-protection structures. 13 And, of course, that's one of the things 14 we're trying to measure now, to see whether we can 15 do better at estimating those. 16 SENATOR O'MARA: Anyone else? 17 Thank you very much. 18 BILL WERICK: Thank you. 19 SENATOR O'MARA: We're going to take a brief 20 five-minute break. 21 We don't want to be any longer than that. 22 [A recess was taken.] 23 [The hearing recommences.] 24 SENATOR O'MARA: If we could -- take your 25 seats, please. 95 1 We're ready to go on with our next 2 witness from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 3 Lieutenant Colonel Adam Czekanski, commander of the 4 Buffalo District. 5 LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI: Senator O'Mara -- 6 SENATOR O'MARA: Are you being joined at this 7 point by Mr. Forgette, or is he coming after you? 8 LT. COL. ADAM CZEKANSKI: Yes, sir. 9 SENATOR O'MARA: And we also have 10 Craig Forgette, chief of planning management team 11 and continuing authorities program manager for the 12 Buffalo District of the Army Corps as well. 13 Thank you, gentlemen, for being here. 14 LT.
