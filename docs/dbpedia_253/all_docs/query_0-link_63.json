        "text": "Good Wednesday morning!\n\nOn Friday, The Jersey City Times reported that Steve Fulop aide Jonathan Gomez-Noriega, who sat on the city’s LGBTQ+ Task Force, donated $1,250 to his sister’s bigoted, trolling and literally book-burning campaign for the Republican secretary of state nomination in Missouri. I won’t name her here because I’m trying to give trolls as little attention as possible, but I’m not carelessly throwing around the word bigoted. You can look her up if you want.\n\nFollowing a statement from Gomez-Noriega that said: “I may not agree with everything my sister says, but I love her. It’s this kind of boldness — stepping up for my family and maintaining our relationship — that makes our country strong,” Fulop got mad. He had an argument with Gomez-Noriega, with whom he had a friendly relationship, in which he threatened to fire him, which Gomez-Noriega recorded and his sister posted on Twitter. By late Monday evening, Fulop announced that Gomez-Noriega — who he said was in Kansas City to campaign for his sister — was no longer working for the city. In other words, fired. The troll then threatened a lawsuit. (The troll lost the primary.)\n\nSo, can a mayor fire an aide for political speech? There isn’t an easy answer. If Gomez-Noriega were a career city worker with civil service protections, he almost certainly could not. But Gomez-Noriega is a mayoral aide — a political hire. “We’ve spoken to our lawyers here and we feel comfortable. He’s an at-will employee and he works on policies that are compromised because of his actions or unwillingness to take actions that don’t support that,” Fulop told me.\n\nI called some employment lawyers. Chris Eibeler, who you may know from representing former DOH official Chris Neuwirth in his seemingly interminable whistleblower lawsuit against the Murphy administration, pointed to the “Pickering Test.” Is Gomez-Noriega’s right to support his sister in conflict with workplace harmony and efficiency? As Eibeler put it, “If the harmony or the workplace function that would be impaired by it significantly outweighs the employee’s right to protected speech.”\n\nEmployment attorney Nancy Erika Smith, who you may remember from yesterday’s Playbook, thinks Fulop likely had a right to fire Gomez-Noriega. “If he was a teacher or a secretary or an accountant, it’d be very clear he could not be fired for that activity,” she said. “There are certain policy-making jobs that you are allowed to fire because of political differences. Like the governor can fire a ton of people in his inner-circle. The prior governor’s staff doesn’t stick around”\n\nThere’s no easy answer here. Let’s see if Gomez-Noriega actually sues.\n\nTIPS?

That’s 26 times more than the 1,588 people who sought permits in the two years before Bruen, in which the court’s conservative majority declared a constitutional right to take guns outside the home for self-defense. The surge was a fraction of what’s still to come, one gun rights advocate predicted. Scott Bach, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs, said some gun enthusiasts are waiting for legal fights over New Jersey’s gun restrictions to end … After the Bruen decision was released, New Jersey State Police Superintendent Col. Pat Callahan said he expected more than 200,000 people would apply for carry permits.”\n\n—“Op-Ed: The system that evaluates NJ public school operations needs an overhaul”\n\n—“Tax contributions by undocumented immigrants highlighted in new study”\n\n—“Blowing off tolls?

Kennedy, Jr. from the state’s November ballot be dismissed, rejecting arguments from a Democratic attorney that Kennedy violated the state’s Sore Loser Law. The recommendation from state Administrative Law Judge Ernest M. Bongiovanni, however, is not binding and Secretary of State Tahesha Way will have the final say whether Kennedy remains on the ballot. The legal challenge against Kennedy was brought by Democratic attorney Scott Salmon and claims that Kennedy violated the state’s Sore Loser Law, which prohibits candidates from running as an independent after seeking a major party’s nomination. Kennedy ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before declaring his independent election bid in October 2023.\n\nDON’T TRUST ANYONE OVER 27 — “Kim, NJ Democrats, mobilize in Green Knoll,” by InsiderNJ’s Fred Snowflack: “There’s something 1960s-like about young people spending the summer traveling the country. But this is 2024, not 1968, and the band of Gen Z activists who popped into this Somerset County town Monday evening had politics in mind. Officially, this excursion has the rather dramatic name of a ‘Tour to Save Democracy.’ More bluntly, it is a tour to drum up votes for Democrats nationwide and to ‘flip’ the House. The group is visiting GOP-held congressional districts that Democrats think they can win this fall. CD-7, which spans six counties in central and western Jersey, is one such district. … Sam Schwartz, the founder and executive director of the tour, said so many Republican positions are “unacceptable to my generation.” He ticked off GOP opposition to abortion rights, gun control and strong steps to combat climate change. For the record, demographers consider those born in 1997 and later as Generation Z. That makes the oldest member of that group 27.”\n\n—Why Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz\n\n—“NJ Dems: Harris VP choice checks the right boxes”\n\nLOCAL\n\nRENT CONTROLBOKEN — “Future of Hoboken’s rent control heading to ballot after council defeats proposal,” by Hudson County View’s Daniel Ulloa: “The future of Hoboken’s rent control is heading to the November 5th ballot after the city council unanimously defeated (9-0) a proposal before them [Monday]. While Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla publicly declared he would veto the ordinance if if passed. … it didn’t seem to condense the virtual session at all, which went just passed 11 p.m. ‘Yes, I’m the face of corporate landlords. … This really helps mom-and-pop landlords,’ Rose Marie Markle, one of the members of the committee of petitioners, said during public portion. ‘Yes, I’m the face of corporate landlords. … This really helps mom-and-pop landlords,’ Rose Marie Markle, one of the members of the committee of petitioners, said during public portion.”\n\nLEROY TRUTH BRINGS LEROY JENKINS — “YouTube journalist and internet allies double down on Stack attacks,” by The Jersey Journal’s Mark Koosau: “In the sweltering August heat, the front of City Hall was the stage, Mayor Brian Stack was the target and a YouTube journalist with a colorful stage name was the star. Leonard Filipowski, better known as Leroy Truth, brought roughly two dozen fellow internet activists to town to widen his campaign against Stack, the powerful Democratic leader who Filipowski has accused of corruption. His Tuesday press conference in front of City Hall, where web content creators from across the country filmed him with their phones, GoPros and camcorders, marked another chapter in the ongoing saga. Online activists ‘are now all focused on Stack,’ Filipowski said. ‘He has now awakened the entire nation of First Amendment activists to investigate (and) expose him.’”\n\nTHE COWARDLY LEÓN — “Hearings scheduled in Newark Teachers Union lawsuits over Global Studies report, other documents,” by Chalkbeat’s Jessie Gómez: “Nearly two years after allegations of racial harassment at the Newark School of Global Studies first surfaced, two lawsuits demanding the release of a report analyzing the cultural dynamics at the school are scheduled to be heard in court. … The case over the release of the Global Studies report is scheduled for Sept. 3. …The Newark Teachers Union sued the district in November 2023 for access to the scathing Global Studies report after Superintendent Roger León said the document would remain internal and after the union’s public records request for the report was denied. In April, the teachers union filed another lawsuit against the district after a second public records request seeking access to billing records, and the contract between the district and Creed Strategies was also denied. … In November 2022, Black students at Global Studies spoke at a board meeting about the racial harassment they endured at the high school. In response, the report analyzing the cultural, racial, and religious dynamics at the high school was commissioned by Newark’s school board in January 2023 but the district has not made it public.”\n\nIN THE REDSTONE — “Brownstone banquet hall $137K behind on Paterson property tax payments for parking lot,” by The Paterson Press’ Joe Malinconico: “The Brownstone’s owners are 15 months behind — or an estimated $136,969 in arrears — in payments to the city for a tax appeal settlement involving a small parking lot next to the banquet hall, municipal officials say. That information was brought to light by Councilman Luis Velez, who did some research about The Brownstone’s property taxes after he recently paid the banquet hall for an overdue bill from his August 2023 wedding reception. Albert Manzo, part of the family that owns The Brownstone, dismissed the revelations about the late tax appeal payments as ‘sour grapes’ from Velez. ‘It’s because he got a black eye when he didn’t pay his bill,’ Manzo said of the theft-of-services charges he filed in Municipal Court against Velez.”\n\n—“Paterson councilman embroiled in election fraud case to hold fundraiser at The Brownstone”\n\nGREAT GREAT GRANDCANDIDATES — “The young and the old in Monmouth County,” by New Jersey Globe’s Zach Blackburn: “Age is but a number in Monmouth County. The county is home to one of the youngest and oldest elected officials in the country: 18-year-old school board member Liam Starkey and 99-year-old Tinton Falls Mayor Vito Perillo. Perillo, who will celebrate his 100th birthday in September, is likely the oldest mayor in the country, and possibly the oldest mayor in American history. … Starkey, who recently graduated from Manasquan High School, won a seat on the Brielle Board of Education last November as a write-in candidate at age 17.”\n\nI’M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE HEADLINE BAIT — “‘Biggest I’ve ever seen': Manasquan Inlet shoal is growing, endangering boats and surfers,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Dan Radel: “The shoaling has returned to Manasquan Inlet, creating a potential navigational hazard and risk to people climbing down onto it, or surfing the waves caused by it. At Monday’s low tide several people were observed by the Asbury Park Press on the shoal fishing or walking their dog. Elected leaders and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers though are warning people to stay off. U.S. Rep. Chris Smith is calling on the Army Corps to take immediate action. ‘The build-up of sand on the Point Pleasant side of the inlet against the jetty has reached unprecedented proportions,’ said Smith. ‘This is not only a grounding hazard to vessels, but the waves created inside the inlet as a result of this shoaling are enough to capsize boats that regularly traverse the channel.’”\n\n—“Army Corps starts dredging Manasquan Inlet to wipe out dangerous shoal”\n\n—“[Jersey City] mayor blocks flag honoring dead police officers, lawsuit says”\n\n—“Boggiano will seek re-election in Jersey City on McGreevey slate”\n\n—“Guttenberg files lawsuit to potentially leave North Hudson Regional Fire & Rescue”\n\n—“Allentown tells Upper Freehold: Those proposed warehouses will flood our basements”\n\n—“These four candidates are running to fill late Clifton councilwoman’s seat in November”\n\n—“Paterson police officer charged with insurance fraud related to Range Rover purchase”\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\nFOOT LEE — “The GWB is open 24/7. Just not to walkers or cyclists. One rider pushes to change that,” by The Record’s Colleen Wilson: “Fort Lee resident Kacy Knight recently tried to take a late-night bike ride across the George Washington Bridge to clear his head — but was surprised to find a locked gate at the New Jersey entrance to the newly reconstructed shared-use path. He couldn’t believe the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey — which owns and operates the world’s busiest bridge — would close the only Manhattan-New Jersey crossing dedicated to cyclists and pedestrians, while the rest of the bridge remains open to vehicle traffic all day and night. It turns out the shared-use path has been closed every night from midnight to 6 a.m. for at least three decades. Knight decided to start a petition to advocate for 24/7 access to the path. … Seth Stein, a Port Authority spokesman, said the bistate agency is open to discussing changes to the hours of use, but not until after the south portion of the shared-use path is completed, which is estimated to be in 2026.”\n\nPAGANISM — “Blood feud: An outlaw biker gang is rapidly expanding. Violent clashes are breaking out across N.J.” by NJ Advance Media’s Alex Napoliello: “The burly man with a well-trimmed beard sat at the bar, nursing a beer. Another man approached, seemingly poised for a fight. And just after midnight on Feb. 2, Nottingham Tavern in Hamilton was about to become the scene of a brawl — and the latest chapter in a long-simmering blood feud between outlaw biker gangs. … The Pagans “are a clear and present danger to the citizenry of New Jersey,” Edwin Torres, a special agent with the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation and a veteran gang investigator, told NJ Advance Media. “They are one of the more highly organized, violent and underestimated criminal groups operating in the state.” The ongoing vendetta between the biker clubs, decades in the making, was just one in a recent string of violent altercations involving the Pagans in the Garden State, law enforcement officials say, incidents that increasingly involve innocent bystanders.”\n\n—“Flooding shutters roadways and highways as rains hammers North Jersey”\n\n—“‘Parental rights’ group grows as it opposes anti-discrimination changes”\n\nR.I.P. — “He prayed, he played: NJ drummer-turned-rabbi helped change tune of Jewish worship”\n\n—“Catholic Sexual Abuse in New Jersey: Part I”\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nMatt Friedman @mattfriedmannj"
