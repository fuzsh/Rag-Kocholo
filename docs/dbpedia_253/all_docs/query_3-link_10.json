        "text": "While low-income activists urge the city to take immediate action on Ottawa’s affordable housing crisis, policy experts and city councillors are looking to the federal government for some relief.\n\nPosted October 7, 2019\n\nReleased in 2017, the National Housing Strategy (NHS) was designed to increase the portion of the federal budget that would subsidize costs for low-income renters and reduce the burden on people currently spending more than 30 per cent of their income on housing.\n\nThe NHS had lofty aims. It would cut chronic homelessness by 50 per cent, remove 530,000 families from housing need, renovate and modernize 300,000 homes and build 125,000 new homes with a budget of $55 billion to be spent over a decade.\n\nBut the plan was not universally welcomed.\n\nB.C. economist Marc Lee wrote that “much of the commitment is in the form of loans not grants, is spread over 10-years and is back-end loaded (meaning that most of the money is spent at the end of the 10 years).”\n\nLee argues that “too much of the media attention has been on home ownership and not enough on providing dedicated, affordable, rental housing.”\n\nAccording to Counc. Catherine McKenney, the city needs that money now.\n\nA recent report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) showed that Ottawa is quickly becoming unaffordable for many people. By comparing wages and rental information from Statistics Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) for October 2018, the CCPA calculated how many hours people would have to work at minimum wage (and other wage levels) to be able to afford an apartment, what Policy Alternatives calls a ‘rental wage.’\n\nAccording to the CCPA, the Ottawa’s average rental rate is the fifth highest in the country, behind Vancouver, Toronto, Victoria and Calgary.\n\nOn average, a person in Ottawa earning Ontario’s $14 per hour minimum wage would have to work 75 hours a week to afford an average two-bedroom unit renting for $1,301 a month. Somebody working full-time, 40 hours per week, would have to earn $26 per hour. Someone working at minimum wage would need to work 61 hours for a one-bedroom unit."
