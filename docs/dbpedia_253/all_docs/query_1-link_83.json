        "text": "Prior to submission, please carefully read and follow the submission guidelines detailed below. Manuscripts that do not conform to the submission guidelines may be returned without review.\n\nSubmission\n\nTo submit to the editorial office of Jesse Owen, PhD, please submit manuscripts electronically through the Manuscript Submission portal Microsoft Word (.docx) or LaTex (.tex) as a zip file with an accompanied Portable Document Format (.pdf) of the manuscript file.\n\nStarting June 15, 2020, all new manuscripts submitted should be prepared according to the 7th edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. APA Style and Grammar Guidelines for the 7th edition are available.\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nJesse Owen, PhD, Editor\n\nDepartment of Counseling Psychology\n\nUniversity of Denver\n\n19999 E. Evans Ave.\n\nDenver, CO 80208\n\nGeneral correspondence may be directed to the editor's office.\n\nPsychotherapy publishes a wide variety of articles relevant to the field of psychotherapy. We strive to foster interactions among training, practice, theory, and research since all are essential to psychotherapy.\n\nWe welcome the widest scope of orientations to inform our readers. Authors are asked to submit theoretical contributions, research studies, novel ideas, the controversial, as well as examples of practice-relevant issues that would stimulate other theorists, researchers, and/or practitioners.\n\nManuscripts submitted to this Journal must have a very clear statement on the implications for psychotherapy, as well as use psychotherapy terminology. Thus, we are most interested in manuscripts that are specifically related to the therapeutic setting and treatment interventions in an applied manner. As such, papers would need to have very clear and accessible implications for therapists in applied clinical practice.\n\nDirectly related to the main aims of this Journal we also encourage submission of articles to a pair of ongoing special series. The first being Practice Review articles that summarize extant research in a clinically accessible manner. The second, parallel in purpose to the Practice Review articles, are Evidence-Based Case Studies that integrate verbatim clinical case material with standardized measures of process and outcome evaluated at different times across treatment.\n\nWhen clinical case material is reported, authors are required to state in writing (footnote or text in manuscript) which criteria they have used to comply with the ethics code (i.e. specific informed consent, de-identification or disguise), and if de-identification or disguise is used how and where it has been applied.\n\nMore information on both of these types of articles can be found on the Psychotherapy Author and Reviewer Resources web page . This web page also contains links to several different resources to help authors conduct their research, including free statistical programs, as well as a range of formatting aids to help authors present their findings.\n\nThe average total length of manuscripts accepted for publication in the journal is 25–35 pages, all inclusive. Authors of manuscripts with greater length will need to justify the additional space in the their cover letter to the editor.\n\nBrief Reports are published and should be no longer than 20 pages, including text, references, tables and figures, but not abstract or title page.\n\nManuscript preparation\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual).\n\nReview APA's Journal Manuscript Preparation Guidelines before submitting your article.\n\nIn order to permit anonymous review, all authors' names, their affiliations, and contact information should be removed from the manuscripts itself and included in the cover letter to the editor. This cover letter should also address any necessary APA publication policy or ethical principles that may exist (i.e. confidentiality of clinical case material, informed consent, overlapping use of prior published data set, etc).\n\nPlease ensure that the final version for production includes a byline and full author note for typesetting.\n\nDouble-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the Manual. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the APA Style website.\n\nAuthors of manuscripts should incorporate recommendations in the updated APA Style Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research before submitting.\n\nThese standards offer ways to improve transparency in reporting to ensure that readers have the information necessary to evaluate the quality of the research and to facilitate collaboration and replication. For further resources, including flowcharts, visit the JARS website.\n\nBelow are additional instructions regarding the preparation of display equations, computer code, and tables.\n\nDisplay equations\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor 3.0 (built into pre-2007 versions of Word) to construct your equations, rather than the equation support that is built into Word 2007 and Word 2010. Equations composed with the built-in Word 2007/Word 2010 equation support are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors.\n\nTo construct your equations with MathType or Equation Editor 3.0:\n\nGo to the Text section of the Insert tab and select Object.\n\nSelect MathType or Equation Editor 3.0 in the drop-down menu.\n\nIf you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.\n\nUse Equation Editor 3.0 or MathType only for equations or for formulas that cannot be produced as Word text using the Times or Symbol font.\n\nComputer code\n\nBecause altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.\n\nIn online supplemental material\n\nWe request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit Supplementing Your Article With Online Material.\n\nIn the text of the article\n\nIf you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.\n\nTables\n\nUse Word's Insert Table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.\n\nAuthor contributions statements using CRediT\n\nThe APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) stipulates that \"authorship encompasses…not only persons who do the writing but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study\" In the spirit of transparency and openness, Psychotherapy has adopted the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) to describe each author's individual contributions to the work. CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and detailed description of their diverse contributions to a manuscript.\n\nSubmitting authors will be asked to identify the contributions of all authors at initial submission according to this taxonomy. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the CRediT designations will be published as an Author Contributions Statement in the author note of the final article. All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission.\n\nCRediT includes 14 contributor roles, as described below:\n\nConceptualization : Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\nData curation : Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use.\n\nFormal analysis : Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.\n\nFunding acquisition : Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\nInvestigation : ​Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.\n\nMethodology : Development or design of methodology; creation of models.\n\nProject administration : Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.\n\nResources : Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.\n\nSoftware : Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\nSupervision : Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.\n\nValidation : Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\nVisualization : Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.\n\nWriting – original draft : ​Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).\n\nWriting – review & editing : Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision—including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\nAuthors can claim credit for more than one contributor role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author.\n\nAcademic writing and English language editing services\n\nAuthors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several vendors that offer discounts to APA authors.\n\nPlease note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.\n\nUse of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.\n\nSubmitting supplemental materials\n\nAPA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the APA PsycArticles® database. Please see Supplementing Your Article With Online Material for more details.\n\nAbstract and keywords\n\nAll manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.\n\nClinical impact statement\n\nPsychotherapy requires authors of all manuscripts to submit a short statement, written in conversational English, that summarizes the article's findings and why they are important to clinical practice.\n\nThis article feature allows authors great control over how their work will be interpreted and discovered by a number of audiences (e.g., practitioners, policy makers, news media).\n\nYour clinical impact statement should appear in your initial manuscript .doc file, below the abstract.\n\nPlease structure it as follows:\n\nQuestion: What is the applied clinical practice question this paper is hoping to address?\n\nFindings: How would clinicians meaningfully use the primary findings of this paper in their applied practice?\n\nMeaning: What are the key conclusions and implications for future clinical practice and research?\n\nNext Steps: Based on the primary findings and limitations of this paper, what are future directions to be explored in clinical practice and research?\n\nEach section should be no more than one short sentence in length.\n\nPlease refer to the Guidance for Translational Abstracts and Public Significance Statements page to help you write this text.\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the References section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal Article:\n\nHughes, G., Desantis, A., & Waszak, F.
