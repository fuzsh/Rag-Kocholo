In this workshop, participants will learn what a climate budget is, what it is not, and how all municipalities can use it as a governance system. Participants will learn how they can achieve municipal net-zero targets and how they can embed climate action work into their budget cycle(s).\n\nIn this workshop, participants will learn practical next steps to include climate budget(s) in their municipal planning cycle.\n\nThe financial case for building sustainable communities\n\n9:30 – 10:45 a.m.\n\nTo keep up with population growth and restore housing affordability, millions of homes must be constructed by 2030. Today’s development decisions will lock-in the GHG emission production, energy performance, servicing costs and resilience of our communities for decades to come. How can local governments balance these priorities when making land use decisions?\n\nIn this workshop, participants will hear from FCM, CMHC, and Sustainability Solutions Group (SSG) on recent research and modelling tools that address these new challenges. Approaches for assessing total lifecycle costs, development patterns, and municipal costs and revenues will be presented, along with a live demonstration of a new land use development modelling tool that will soon be available to municipal staff.\n\nBeing the face of your community's climate action plan: communication, decision-making and leadership\n\n9:30 – 10:45 a.m.\n\nBold climate action requires dedicated champions who can drive forward new ideas, mobilize partners, build relationships, and make tough decisions. These community leaders must learn to recognize how important their voices — and their words — are, especially when it comes to local climate action.\n\nIn this workshop, you will explore what it means to be the face of your community’s climate action plan. You will hear from current leaders who have positioned themselves as climate champions in their communities and discuss the opportunities and challenges that come with this role.

That means the procurement and delivery of construction services by municipalities provides a significant opportunity to combine social justice and environmental action in order address urgent issues facing communities.\n\nIn this sponsored workshop, participants will explore proven methods to prioritize and enhance the social and environmental outcomes of infrastructure investment. Expert panelists, including municipal construction decision makers, will discuss early contractor engagement, specifically Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), as an effective strategy for Canadian municipalities to implement social procurement, inclusive hiring, and sustainable building at zero premium cost. Participants will hear details around specific outcomes delivered on municipal projects from across the country and discuss procurement policy and project initiatives that helped enable these outcomes.\n\nOttawa's journey to net zero\n\n3:15 – 4:45 p.m.\n\nIn response to the declaration of a climate emergency, the City of Ottawa developed a Climate Change Master Plan. The plan aims to take unprecedented collective action to transition Ottawa into a clean, renewable, and resilient city by 2050. This includes achieving net zero emissions within City operations and the broader community.\n\nIn this workshop session, participants will learn about priority actions taken in the City of Ottawa as well as collaborations with community partners that form an inclusive journey to net zero. Participants can engage with local champions in a world café format and discuss ways to inspire and support action in their own community.\n\nEmerging models for municipal collaboration and knowledge sharing\n\n3:15 – 4:45 p.m.\n\nCaught in the challenges of delivering services to residents while dealing with an unprecedented COVID environment, municipal staff may feel a sense of uncertainty and isolation, especially in small and rural communities. The pandemic reshaped how communities share information, creating a reality of virtual platforms and remote engagement that reduces collaboration, communities of practice, and peer exchanges.\n\nThis workshop session explores approaches used by FCM that foster municipal networking and collaboration within sustainability and asset management units. Supporting collaboration and informational exchanges between municipal staff are key to cultivating community innovation and resilience. Come to this session to learn how effective knowledge sharing builds better communities.\n\nAdaptation Roundtables: help us build a national climate resilience program\n\n3:15 – 4:45 p.m.\n\nThe cost of climate change is felt first in local communities. The impacts felt directly by their residents. As we, at FCM, begin to build out our National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) program, we want to hear from you, Canadian sustainability leaders who have been directly impacted by climate events and/or who have already incorporated adaption strategies into their communities. We want to know what has been the most valuable advancement(s) that your municipality has incorporated to increase climate resilience, what resources were necessary to get there, and what challenges you have faced. Help us develop the most effective and substantial National Adaptation Strategy program that we can.\n\nThis session includes an interactive discussion where participants can exchange adaption-related information, ask important questions, discuss best practices and examine the resources needed to incorporate adaptation strategies — alongside mitigation action — into communities. After the session is complete, FCM moderators will review the discussion and incorporate relevant information to deepen the development of our NAS program and achieve our goal of helping Canadian municipalities build greater climate resilience.\n\nJoin this session to share your questions and challenges and leave with ideas and contacts to support your next steps.\n\nThursday, February 9\n\nFinancing innovations for your sustainability projects\n\n9 – 10:30 a.m.\n\nIn this interactive hybrid session, you have the chance to connect with several funding and financing partners, including representatives from the GMF Fund, government ambassadors, and private sector lenders, to get your funding questions answered.
