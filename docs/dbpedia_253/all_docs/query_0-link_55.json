        "text": "Basel jalab // program manager, furniture bank\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's degree in architecture and master's degree in real estate development, I was given the opportunity to participate in major projects in many places around the world. This lead me to working with people from different backgrounds. I always enjoyed the being close to people and had a passion for helping and working for the community. I often volunteered with non-profit organizations, and asked my employer to give me tasks to support people – these were the ways I fulfilled my desire to help others.\n\nAfter immigrating to Canada, my career objective was to direct all the knowledge and experience I have towards humanitarian services. Working with the Canadian Red Cross played a significant role in building my emergency management skills. When I heard about Matthew House Ottawa, I was so impressed with the work they are doing for the community. And now, I can proudly say I am a part of it.\n\nI feel that my career objectives and desire to support the community are well achieved by working at MHO. The volunteers and staff truly care about helping society and supporting those in significant need of our services. I am witnessing the positive impact we are doing for the community every day and looking forward to supporting more people in the future.\n\nIan Mclaren // CHAIR\n\nIan McLaren is a recently retired senior executive who spent over 35 years in the global hi-tech industry.
