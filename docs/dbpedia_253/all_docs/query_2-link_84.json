It divides Ottawa's tech history into 3 eras: 1) 1948-1994 focused on research and development funding from government agencies; 2) 1995-2001 considered a \"Golden Age\" of growth and commercialization; 3) 2002-present described as a \"Lost Decade\" with a recent resurgence from new founders. The presentation then discusses metrics like employment, companies, venture capital, and clusters to analyze how Ottawa compares to other tech hubs currently.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\nMy interest in tech sector history stems from understanding the so-called “front-end of innovation” and paying attention to the importance of “origin stories” and the people who are at the centre of these stories. I am not a professional historian Metaphor of the 1986 Newbridge photo: A snapshot in time: looking up to the future/looking down at the past; “entanglement” of personal stories “distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion” – Einstein “The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once”\n\nOutline – Part 1 flyover (past - reflection); Part 2 discussion (present - reckoning) Part 3 questions (future –reimagining) Follow along or dig deeper with notes on Medium.com – entrance to a “self-guided tour” over 100 embedded links into rabbit holes for the curious.\n\nCompressing a lot of history (akin to geological periods – Precambrian, Cambrian, ); no sharp edges starting and ending dates A flyover of 3 Eras but with a question mark at 2021 … will the pandemic represent a discontinuity and usher in a new era? *** Significant or defining events and spillover effects *** rather than recounting specific histories of companies\n\nSteve Blank presentation on the origins of Silicon Valley Riding the 70 years of the same background technology waves; S-curves (ferment, take-off, maturity and discontinuity) Reference to Carlota Perez research – theory that each wave has a period of installation and deployment Post-war years: Defence R&D (initially seeded by government) played a key role in both Silicon Valley and SV North\n\nNRC wartime scientific research - grew from 200 employees in Ottawa to over 2,000 NRC – the effect of the ionosphere on the transmission of radio waves and research on high resolution radar (Cavity Magnetron – Northern Electric manufactured some) RPL formed in 1944 at the request of the Royal Canadian Navy in addressing technological challenges associated with submarine warfare. RPL as predecessor of DRTE and CRC DRB formed in 1947, as a collection of several military research laboratories including RPL The 1st “hi-tech” company in Ottawa “Computing Devices of Canada” formed in 1948 manufacturing the Position and Homing Indicator (PHI) developed by the NRC … in a way Ottawa had almost a 10 year head-start than Silicon Valley (Fairchild Semiconductor, 1957).\n\nDefining event: Decision by Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company to concentrate its R&D activity in the nation’s capital Northern Electric was around since 1895 tracing its history to Alexander Graham Bell who invented the telephone in 1874 Voice communication was analog-electromechanical switching Research: electronic telephone switches « E-Thing »; and subsequent evolution to an all-digital switch (Meridian SL-1 PBX and later DMS 100 central office switches) Northern Telecom (1976)\n\n50th anniversary – BNR (Ottawa); The heyday of corporate R&D: BNR as the innovation engine like Xerox PARC, IBM Watson Labs and Bell Labs concurrently introduction of the Intel 4004 - first commercially available microprocessor Culture\n\n1981 Article in New York Times referring to Ottawa as “Silicon Valley North”\n\nSpillovers of R&D era: Attracting talent 1950’s and 60’s) to work on cutting edge technology; Network effects Visionary entrepreneurs (70s and 80s) and typically not VC-backed but angel + IRAP (government support) vs Silicon Valley venture capital played a key role (Davis & Rock, ARDC, Sutter Hill Ventures, KPCB, Sequoia, Venrock, etc)\n\n2nd Era Events and Spillovers Skystone acquisition in 1997 (Kodiak Ventures – Boston) Spillovers Massive influx of VC$ in Ottawa (from $125M in ‘98 to over $1B in 2000) A recognition that the development of technological advantage could be short-circuited by directly acquiring startup IP and talent (i.e Nortel) ushering in the age of the VC-backed startup in Ottawa (recall that VC was mostly absent from Ottawa until this event but angels did play a role)\n\n- Nortel’s “Right-Angle Turn” 1998; acquisition of Bay Networks and other startups; re-named as Nortel Networks in ‘98 - Failure to land $2B chip fabrication plant in Ottawa (1999) – Ottawa Economic Development Corporation\n\nJuxtaposition of images: downfall of Nortel (once the world's 16th most highly valued company) and emergence of Shopify Nortel implosion; 27,000 net jobs losses between peak and 2005 Short-lived VC explosion Significant M&A activity (branch plant R&D) Fresh Founders de-coupled from R&D and telecom roots – Web 2.0\n\nWeak signals of transition: in 2007 Friday OCRI event at the Westin vs Saturday BarCamp event at CU (3rd era could have been divided but the transition was subtle between Tech’s Lost Decade and Fresh Founders) https://web.archive.org/web/20080216210249/http://jadedpixel.com/\n\nPandemic as a discontinuity? – What about the new wealth? Example: Shopify’s newly-minted angel investors and diversifying entrepreneurs What about WFA/WFH and its impact on talent attraction and retention? Will R&D play a role in the future of tech innovation in Ottawa?\n\nMany measures – some traditional, some direct, some untraditional, some indirect (see background notes) - A reckoning of sorts/getting our bearings\n\nAddress the tech concentration indicator (as high as 11% or as low as 6%) as it is influenced by the choice of tech employment statistics (Stats Can 45K vs CBRE’s 76K) Where is the job growth coming from? Startups? What sectors? The irrational exuberance of the boom era TOP co-chair Bob Chiarelli suggested that Ottawa region's 800,000 population would double by 2021. The Ottawa Economic Development Corp predicted that there would be 200,000 hi-tech jobs by 2020.\n\nAddress the tech concentration indicator (as high as 11% or as low as 6%) as it is influenced by the choice of tech employment statistics (Stats Can 45K vs CBRE’s 76K) Address number of tech companies over past 15 years at 5-yr intervals\n\nunderstanding the demographics and dynamism of the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem proportion of new and young firms in the makeup of the EE over time (churn); share of employment in these firms - new and young firms (track where are they coming from? post-secondary institutions; former employees of parent companies? other regions? what sectors are these new and young firms active in? provides insight into emerging growth spaces -Note OCRI President Bill Collins stated that there were 1,100 tech companies in Ottawa in 2001 which also jives with OBJ directory of tech companies OBJ’s 2006 Ottawa Technology Guide indicates 1,000 tech companies not 1,800 promoted by OCRI\n\nOttawa has not fared much better in 2020 nor 2021 to date 2020 TOP VENTURE CAPITAL CITIES Toronto ($1.2 billion), Vancouver ($877 million), Montreal ($632 million) Kitchener ($435 million) Quebec City ($343 million), Calgary ($313 million), Edmonton ($239 million), Mississauga ($207 million), Burlington ($160 million), Burnaby ($129 million), Ottawa ($111 million) No Ottawa firms included in VC mega-deals in the last 18 months (deals over $100M) 2021 to date: Toronto has close to 20 “mega-deals”; Ottawa 1\n\n$2-3billion R&D in Ottawa (performed by Federal government ~$1B, industry ~$1B and post-secondary institutions ~$400M Major players in each sector: NRC, Shopify, University of Ottawa Limited spillovers from R&D to local innovation and economic development Fresh Founders de-coupled from R&D\n\nEconomic Development initiatives (Economic Generators, ICF Consulting’s Innovate Ottawa) – 2000-2015 clusters as a ED strategy New clusters added: Photonics, Digital Media, Defence and Cybersecurity, Cleantech, E-Business, Autonomous Vehicles, Failure of photonics cluster (most of the ingredients in place after the telecom crash – infrastructure (NRC); research (uOttawa); venture capital; and slew of startups led by tech industry veterans.\n\nWhat do you think has been the most enduring legacy of the tech community’s contributions to the development of Ottawa as we know it today? 1A – “legacy” has a connotation as something being confined to the past (and is somehow transmitted to the present and future); I cannot come up with an “overarching” legacy but rather many “micro-legacies” (reference Newbridge 55 photo slide 1); what matters instead is constant “legacy-making” (as a verb it straddles past, present and future) as represented by the Backbone Angels photo (slide 14). 2. How can the history community and Ottawans, in general, ensure the proper recognition and appreciation of the tech sector’s roots in the area? 2A – capture the origin stories before they are forgotten (artefacts overlaid with storytelling documenting 3. With respect to the first era of tech in Ottawa, R&D played a major role in its realization and success. In your opinion, does the future of Ottawa’s tech sector rely on or feature a return to research and development (R&D)? How crucial is R&D in not only establishing but maintaining the tech industry in Ottawa? 3A – crucial in the sense that it serves to be alert to breakthrough ideas from elsewhere – Xerox PARC (Alto GUI computer) visits by Apple engineers in 1979 4. Does Ottawa being the capital impact the development of the tech sector and would you consider it a limitation or advantage in that development? What is unique about the tech sector in a capital city? 4A – advantage but we have not fully understood its full potential beyond balancing the tech sector employment 5. In the last year, we realized the feasibility and possibilities of hybrid work environments, with a work from anywhere approach. What do you believe are the effects of this shift in work culture on the tech sector, particularly on location-based development? 5A- open question … role of superstar cities will remain dominant/also how will tap ingenuity if we can’t attract talent like before?"
