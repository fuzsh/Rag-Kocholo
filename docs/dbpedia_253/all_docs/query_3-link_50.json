Who could blame him?\n\nHis bed is in a fluorescent-lit room whose walls are curtains that are seldom closed. He is hooked up to monitors that beep while he is secured to the bed after an earlier escape attempt.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

His heart rate and oxygen saturation levels are hovering precariously low. And I am having a hard time peeling my eyes from the monitors that measure his vital signs.\n\nHe shouts his desire to “get out of here now!” He wants to find his car and drive home.\n\nAround us is a whirl of chaos and pungent odors. There are heroic attempts by overworked staff to make order of it.\n\nOne patient yells — or is it a moan? — for hours. An angry echo comes from somewhere else in the warren of cubbies where patients await whatever comes next.\n\nNurses, personal support workers, doctors, and orderlies hustle through the crowded hallways, making their way past patients on stretchers and some of the equipment needed to care for and clean up after the endless stream of sick and injured.\n\nUnderneath it all I hear a constant thrum, the soundtrack of a busy emergency department trying to keep up. It is an impossible task.\n\nDad’s bed has a straight view down the hallway. Focused, suddenly, he looks at the ceiling where the lights shine toward us and tiles draw a strip down the hall.\n\nA civil engineer who travelled the world building storage tanks and structures during his career, he is always looking at ceilings, interested in how buildings are put together. This time he sees something else.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Look at that!” he says in wonder. “Another one is landing.”\n\nThis is new. Dad has been increasingly forgetful and worried about his memory in recent years. But hallucinations? No. This is hospital-induced delirium.\n\nStill, his focus on the aircraft he apparently sees landing in the emergency department hallway is both a concern and a relief. At least it gives him something to do.\n\nSo we watch the imaginary plane together.\n\nOver the following year, I lived my father’s journey through a struggling health system, watching him become more broken along the way. My three sisters and I were officially designated as caregivers in the abrupt shift in all of our lives that happened once he was checked into the hospital.\n\nI am a health reporter. I write about health and medicine, in Ottawa, where I live, across the province, and beyond.\n\nI have written hundreds of stories about the health-care system. Recently I have been writing about the COVID-19 pandemic and its after-effects, especially the historic pressures on hospitals in Ontario and across Canada that are pushing the people who work in them, and the patients who rely on them, to the brink.\n\nI had seen, written about it, and read plenty of evidence about long waits, worsening health outcomes and diminishing faith in the system.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI thought I understood the health system. But I really didn’t until my father fell.\n\nMy dad\n\nMy father, Allan Payne, was born in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, to the daughter of a local pioneer family and a British ex-pat who worked at the local newspaper. Photos of him as a child and strapping young man reveal a distinct half smile that would show up in photos throughout his life. I inherited that smile.\n\nDad worked in the oil fields and in the Far North before starting a career as a civil engineer that would last more than 40 years and would take him to job sites across Canada, the U.S. and around the world. He was fearless about meeting new people, a gift that enabled him to learn Spanish during a posting in Venezuela just years before he retired. He practised on anyone who would listen, stumbling through mangled sentences in local markets and on his job site, sometimes leaving listeners in stitches and patting his back in encouragement.\n\nHis enthusiasms included cycling and hockey. He and my mother, a piano teacher, sang in the church choir for decades.\n\nHe could be grumpy, gruff and stubborn, especially as he got older and life became more difficult.\n\nBut he could also charm, which he put to use with health workers during his final months in care. He sometimes surprised them — and us — by slipping into Spanish, a language he hadn’t spoken since the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDad was also a man who believed anything could be fixed, from the duct tape he used on running shoes that had outlived their best-before date to the safety pins that kept his suspenders attached to his work jeans.\n\nHe could fix everyday problems with Gorilla Glue, staples, and even more structurally sound methods that included home renovations and landscaping.\n\nThat ethos also extended to his health, for better or worse.\n\n“All I need is more exercise and I will be fine,” was his motto. But this wasn’t going to be such an easy fix.\n\nDuring my 40-year career in journalism, one of the wisest people I have interviewed said something that stayed with me.\n\nThe man, a health official in West African Guinea, was talking specifically about Ebola, a deadly virus that killed more than 11,000 people during an unprecedented epidemic there between 2013 and 2016.\n\n“We knew what Ebola could do to the human body,” he said to me. “But we didn’t know until now what it could do to a society.”\n\nI thought about these words often during the months my father was in the hospital. They also carried meaning in a medium-sized hospital in Ontario’s Niagara Region. This hospital, just a few blocks from Niagara Falls, was struggling with overcrowding, lack of beds, staff shortages, long waits for treatments and diagnostics, and a shortage of patience on all sides.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI didn’t fully appreciate what the ongoing hospital crisis could do to society until Dad was wheeled into the Greater Niagara General Hospital.\n\nThat’s because I knew it could have been any hospital across the country.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe fall\n\nIt happened on May 20, 2022.\n\nIt was a day like many others. My father did some errands in the battered gold Taurus he had been driving for decades. Its dents told stories of failed attempts to back up the beast with a small trailer attached — the trailer he used to take debris to the local dump. It was a routine chore, for which he dressed in his customary yard work uniform of too-big jeans held up with suspenders, a well-loved fleece lined jean jacket and whichever baseball cap he pulled from among the dozens stuffed into closet shelves throughout the house.\n\nOn this particular day, he used the car to pick up a few groceries before making a stop at the bank. He took an old-fashioned comfort in frequent visits to bank on the main street of his town. It would be the last time he made that familiar stop.\n\nHe was standing in line. Then he wobbled. Next, he fell down, breaking his right upper arm. (Whether he should have been living alone and driving at age 90 was a matter of family discussion. But my dad was still living in the large house my family had owned for decades on the edge of a southern Ontario town. He was getting forgetful and slowing down but he was getting by.)\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nStaff from the bank, some of whom had known him for years, called an ambulance. It took him to the nearest hospital emergency department — 30 kilometres down the highway.\n\nThere used to be a hospital in his town, but its emergency department closed in 2009, despite pushback from outraged residents. That hospital morphed into an urgent care and rehabilitation centre. In 2023, the urgent care centre’s overnight hours were also cut.\n\nThe fall was probably the most predictable part of my father’s medical journey.\n\nFalls are all-too common among the elderly and often foretell a deterioration in health.\n\nIt is the cause of 85 per cent of all injury-related hospitalizations among seniors in Canada, according to Health Canada. And rates have been increasing. Twenty to 30 per cent of seniors experience at least one fall a year and many, like my father, land in hospital as a result.\n\nSpend a bit of time in an emergency department and it won’t take long to realize that many of those ambulances making their way to hospitals, lights flashing, are carrying an older person who has fallen.\n\nMy father’s injuries didn’t appear too severe at first: A broken upper arm that wouldn’t require surgery and no serious head injury. It seemed like he had been lucky.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut it wasn’t that simple.\n\nCrucially, it is what happens after the fall that is key to a patient’s outcome.\n\nThe fallout\n\nThe hospital he was taken to first opened in 1895 and was too small to meet growing demands. Population growth and an aging population meant the hospital, like many across the province, was chronically short of beds, which clogged the emergency department and left people waiting. Work began on a new hospital in 2023, almost a year later than originally planned, and is expected to open in 2028.\n\nIn fact, this century-old hospital was part of a regional health system that had been given a C grade in a Canadian hospital report card put together by CBC’s The Fifth Estate in 2013.\n\nOf note in that rating was that the hospital had “substantially more” adverse events tied to nursing care for medical problems than an average hospital of the same size, as well as more deaths after major surgery.\n\nAnd that was before the pandemic, which took a hammer to existing cracks in the province’s health-care system.\n\nWhen Dad was wheeled into the backlogged emergency room, he waited for hours on a stretcher for someone to see him.\n\nAt first, he believed he would be treated and sent on his way. And so did we, although we worried about his ability to take care of himself with a broken arm.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut that didn’t happen. To be fair, his case was more complex than a broken arm. The cause of the fall seemed to be an extremely low heart rate, which could be treated with a pacemaker, which meant more time in the hospital and created a cascade of negative impacts on his long-term health.\n\nAs someone who had been writing about the strains on the health system that worsened with COVID, living through Dad’s experience was a collision of my two worlds – work and family.\n\nWhat made it more difficult was that I was well aware of the chokepoints in the system and knew all too well how they could work to slow my dad’s recovery, and even worsen his health.\n\nMy dad’s experience was like checking off a bingo card of choke points and danger zones in the health system. Overcrowding? Check. Staff shortages? Check. Bed shortages? Check. Outbreaks? Check. Delays? Check.\n\nAnd so on. He experienced them all.\n\nOnly, the prize for shouting BINGO was spending more time in the hospital.\n\nIt seems fitting that, in recent months, a ribbon made of duct tape has become a symbol of a health system being held together, worn by health workers across the country. Every time I see one, I think of Dad.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, it still surprised me when his health only worsened in their care.\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe wait\n\nMy father waited for hours on a stretcher before being admitted. At first, he seemed to view it as an adventure. My sister, who had rushed to the hospital, watched from the other side of a glass barrier as my dad, who loved to talk, chatted with people passing by. He appeared to be alone, but when she asked to go stand with him, she was told “we are keeping an eye on him.”\n\nEventually, the wait on a stretcher left him stressed, confused and, crucially, unable to move for hours. Those hours would eventually extend to days and weeks.\n\nI would only fully understand later how dangerous that time in a bed or a stretcher can be for the elderly. Every day, every hour, starts a downward slide of mobility and overall physical and mental health, which often prolongs their hospital stay in a dangerous feedback loop. That is especially true for the elderly.\n\nFor every day an older person spends lying in bed, it takes two days to recover the strength and function that has been lost. It also takes just eight hours lying on a stretcher for a frail elderly patient’s skin to begin to break down, which could lead to debilitating pressure ulcers, or bed sores. Typical waits in many Ontario emergency departments are nearing the 20-hour mark, but can sometimes be higher.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nResearch has demonstrated that many seniors leave hospital in worse shape than when they entered. Long days spent mostly, or entirely, in bed are a key culprit.\n\nDalhousie University frailty researcher Dr. Olga Theou put it this way in an interview published by the Canadian Frailty Network:\n\n“Older people who are very frail are already so low on muscle mass that a long period of almost-complete inactivity can easily tip them over the edge into a really bad situation. So after a prolonged stay in hospital, the person might be over the pneumonia, but now they can’t walk.”\n\nThe minute my father entered the hospital, the clock began to tick.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdmission\n\n“When will he be admitted to hospital?” one of my sisters asked a nurse in the emergency department.\n\nWe had been picturing a room with a space for one or two of us to sit and for my dad to move around a bit, and to sleep, away from the chaos of emergency.\n\n“He is admitted,” said the nurse briskly. “This is his room.”\n\nHis “room” was a curtained cubicle in the bright and noisy emergency department where there always seemed to be a new crisis just down the hall. It was barely big enough to contain his bed and the beeping equipment he was attached to.\n\nThey would try to move him to an actual room when one was available, we were told. The nurse was apologetic, but weary. It would be days before he had a bed in a hospital wardroom with walls.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMy father began showing signs of delirium within hours of entering the hospital.\n\nIt is common in elderly hospitalized patients—marked by confusion, hallucinations, problems with awareness and mood change—and can complicate recovery and a patient’s ability to regain independence. It can be related to an injury and go away once it is resolved, or it can linger. It is also one more layer that limits a patient’s ability to get up and move and recover.\n\nNext, my father’s heart rate started dipping into the low 30s, dangerously low. He had a visit from a cardiologist, who recommended the installation of a pacemaker.\n\n“And you should be as good as new,” said the cardiologist, hopefully.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a COVID-19 outbreak on his ward, the first of many which would ultimately affect his recovery. He did not become infected, but it put further strain on an already short-staffed hospital unit and slowed everything down. And that meant more time in bed.\n\nStill, the pacemaker helped and after a few days in the hospital doctors determined that his arm could heal in a sling without the need for surgery or a cast. Things appeared to be looking up.\n\nThe plan was to get him into rehabilitation quickly. We were thrilled that the rehab hospital was located close to his home and that he would get moving again.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMy father played hockey into his 80s. He and my late mother were well known for riding their bikes around their town well into old age. My sisters and I kept a photo of Mom and Dad on our refrigerators to inspire us to follow their examples. The photo was taken on the opening day of a new bike trail linking their town to the next, through scenic woods and pretty vistas. Mom and Dad were pictured in full cycling gear hitting the new trail, among the first to use it.\n\nMy mother, who died in her mid-nineties, had been on a bike until she was 90. Into her eighties, she would often mark her birthday by swimming her age in the pool – one lap for every year.\n\nAge had taken a toll on my father. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery at age 83, he walked with a tilt and lived with a sore back. But at 90 he was mobile and still driving — until the day the fall landed him in the hospital.\n\nThen things changed quickly.\n\nThe negative impact of hospital stays on the elderly has been long understood. As far back as 1947, the enforced bed rest that came with hospital admission was described as “dangerous,” according to a 2021 article in the journal Age and Aging. Because it created risks of “functional decline and other poor outcomes for older adults,” many hospitals worked hard to keep patients moving, with walks in the hallway or to common rooms for other activities.\n\nAdvertisement 14\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe pandemic disrupted that. Social distancing, staffing shortages, equipment shortages, and ongoing outbreaks meant patients were spending more time in bed. They also had fewer visitors to help them get around and staff members were increasingly stretched.\n\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has upended recent progress towards creating a culture of mobility in hospitals and has led to low levels of patient activity not seen in decades,” the authors of the paper wrote.\n\nMy father could still walk when he entered the hospital. He broke his arm, not his hip. But he also was a fall risk, especially while awaiting a pacemaker, and was unable to use a walker at first because of his arm. That, and connections to monitors, rendered him bedbound at first, and a combination of staff shortages, outbreaks and fear of another fall kept him there longer than he should have been.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the rehabilitation hospital, he had lost much of his strength and mobility. Still, we had high hopes — its job was to get patients moving. It quickly became clear, however, that the pandemic had also taken its toll there.\n\nStaff shortages meant rehabilitation therapy often didn’t happen, which meant my father’s condition worsened with every day. He grew so weak that he often didn’t want to get up and do physio. Stressed staff members didn’t have time, or the energy, to coerce him, plus they were frequently short-staffed. Even when he did get physio, he could barely walk a few steps.\n\nAdvertisement 15\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThen there was another COVID-19 outbreak and this time Dad was not so lucky. After more than two years of avoiding it, my father contracted COVID-19 and remained on oxygen for weeks. That meant more time in bed.\n\nAnd the downward spiral continued.\n\nRehabilitation\n\nInstead of a route out of the hospital system and back to more independence, rehabilitation became a holding pen for my father. Despite political pressure to find beds for the so-called alternate level of care (ALC) patients like my dad — who were in hospital but needed another kind of care — things moved slowly in the summer and fall of 2022.\n\nGetting assessed in order to move into publicly funded or even private care was painfully slow because, like every other aspect of the health system, there were not enough staff available to meet demands. If someone was on vacation or sick, things ground to a halt.\n\nHome care faced an even bigger staffing crisis than health institutions, which limited people’s ability to return to their homes with support.\n\nMy father lived at the rehabilitation hospital for nearly four months during which his physical condition deteriorated and his spirits waned. Most worrisome were his steadily worsening pressure sores. Even sitting in a wheelchair for any length of time was becoming excruciating. He talked about escaping.\n\nAdvertisement 16\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThere were bright spots. Health workers, nurses and personal support workers were generally kind and caring, although they were spread far too thinly. And he bonded with the elderly men with whom he shared a room amid the indignities that went with being old and hospitalized. His neighbour, John, would sometimes answer Dad’s phone when he couldn’t get there quickly.\n\n“We help each other,” John explained to my sister on the other end of the line.\n\nAnother roommate told me “we are like family” and proceeded to scold me for disappearing on an errand without telling my father where I was going. My father, he said, had panicked.\n\nThey were reluctant companions, but they shared dreams — mostly of being anywhere else. While his roommates looked out the window or stared at their television screens, my father scanned the ceiling for ideas about how to escape, often coming up with fantasies involving tunnels, boats, passports and other means of passage.\n\nOne roommate described in vivid detail his former life in the mountains of the northwestern U.S., as if he was still there. For a few minutes their grey hospital room was transformed. You could almost see his view across the white and blue expanse of mountains as he spoke. A few days later, after briefly complaining of stomach pains, he unexpectedly died in his bed, leaving the remaining band of brothers shaken and in disbelief.\n\nAdvertisement 17\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnother roommate talked about the new long-term care home he was waiting to move to. It was new, spacious, close to family, and was known for its food. When the call finally came, it was for another home, less private, not as nice, not as close to family, not what or where he had hoped for. He spent the day in his bed crying softly to himself, with just a thin curtain to conceal his obvious grief — one more indignity in a long list that the institutionalized elderly live with.\n\nAround dinner time my father’s roommate pulled himself together, sat up in bed and announced shakily:\n\n“Well, it looks like I will be leaving. I know I don’t sound happy about it, but I really am.”\n\nHis eyes were red and it was clearly taking effort to paint a happy face on the situation, but he was trying. He and his comrades in arms had grown used to making the best of situations beyond their control.\n\n“We are going to miss you,” offered my dad.\n\nThe end\n\nThe longer my father stayed in the hospital system, the clearer it became that he would never regain independence. By December 2022, more than six months after his fall and broken arm, my father was virtually bed-bound, on increasing doses of pain medication and in palliative care. Once robust, he was becoming painfully thin.\n\nAdvertisement 18\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nEven surrounded by daughters who were almost always on the scene and advocating for him, he went downhill fast. We hit roadblocks every step of the way — waiting for physical and psychological assessments, waiting for medical opinions, waiting for officials to return from holidays to help us understand what could and should be done. It is difficult to imagine what it must be like for patients with no advocates, some of whom I met during my father’s time in the health-care system.\n\nMy dad survived his hospital experience but he emerged broken.\n\nHe spent the last seven months of his life in a municipally run long-term care facility close to his home. It was a place he used to make bitter jokes about ending his days in. It turned out to be a nice place, if not where he wanted to be. There were birds at a feeder outside his window and concerts down the hall if he could sit in his wheelchair long enough to make the trip. The personal support workers and nurses were genuinely caring and kind, and they promoted mobility fastidiously. But by the time he was in their care, it was too late to reverse course.\n\nHis experience was, sadly, not unique. Recent research from the Canadian Institute of Health Information found that hospital staffing challenges increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did harms to patients.\n\nAdvertisement 19\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThose harms include pressure ulcers, or bed sores, the kind my father had developed. Fewer staff meant less help getting patients up or repositioning them to reduce the risk.\n\nBy the end, my father suffered from stage 4 bedsores, the most severe. What begin as sore spots or skin-deep sores can eventually progress to deep wounds that may impact muscle, tendons, ligaments and even bone.\n\nThey are both preventable and very difficult to reverse once they reach that stage.\n\nOne of my sisters stayed in the room when his dressings were changed just to see what he was living with, something I couldn’t bring myself to do. Care workers first asked if she was squeamish. She isn’t, but will likely never forget the sight of sores that had eaten into his flesh.\n\nStaff at the long-term care home seemed genuinely shocked at his condition when he arrived.\n\nHis condition steadily worsened until he had difficulty swallowing even the pureed food they had been serving him, in unrecognizable pools presented cheerfully by staff. (“The food is not bad,” my dad said at one point before his condition deteriorated, “but they could work on presentation.”)\n\nIn his final days, he stopped eating and drank very little. One of my sisters had rented a small electric keyboard which she played. He sometimes sang along to hymns, thinking he was practising for choir.\n\nAdvertisement 20\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nShe was playing one morning when she looked over and saw he was struggling. She held his hand as he breathed his last breath.\n\nArticle content\n\nCould it have been different?\n\nIt should have been different, said Dr. Samir Sinha. He is director of health policy research at Canada’s National Institute on Ageing, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto, and a leading expert on health and aging.\n\n“What happened to your father wasn’t inevitable and was probably largely preventable.”\n\nIn fact, Sinai Health has demonstrated how simple steps – such as only using catheters and intravenous hydration on elderly patients when absolutely necessary in order to prioritize mobility – can make a massive difference in their overall well-being in hospital and beyond. Catheters and intravenous drugs can keep elderly patients bedbound.\n\nThe hospital’s ACE (acute care for elders) strategy recognizes that pressure sores, or bed sores, are a consequence of a system that does not promote early mobility in elderly patients. Among other things, it aims to get elderly patients out of bed for meals three times a day.\n\n“Bed sores aren’t just a horrible thing for a patient. They represent these festering wounds in our entire health-care system,” Sinha said.\n\nAdvertisement 21\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBy promoting early mobility through its ACE strategy, Sinai was able to reduce its use of urinary catheters by 50 per cent and incidences of pressure ulcers by 93 per cent and keep patients more mobile.\n\nIt is a strategy being promoted to leaders at other hospitals in the hope that it will be more widely adopted and accepted. Health systems from Newfoundland to Iceland are now basing policy on the strategy, Sinha said, as are other hospitals.\n\nHe admits it is an uphill battle to “re-engineer” a health system that was designed in the early 1960s when the average patient in Canada was around 27 years old. Today, the average hospital patient is closer to 72 years old.\n\n“We are fundamentally trying to manage the needs of an aging population with a system designed for 27-year-olds.”\n\nAmong changes needed to retrofit the health system, he said, is making sure doctors, nurses and all health workers get more specialized geriatric training. The new medical school scheduled to open at Toronto Metropolitan University in 2025 will include aging as one of five core pillars.\n\n“There is still a huge amount of work that needs to be done,” said Sinha. “But when it is, we can get impressive results.”\n\nDad’s hospitalization and deterioration were exhausting, frightening and sad for me and my sisters. Understanding that the worst of it could – and should – have been prevented is infuriating.\n\nAdvertisement 22\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAs a society we know how to properly care for the hospitalized elderly in a way that does not leave them in worse shape than when they were admitted. We know why it is so important to do so, and yet my dad, and thousands like him, many of whom are in hospital beds today, are collateral damage in a failing health system. And few people notice.\n\nArticle content\n\nA good life\n\nMy father had a good life and a full life. He threw himself into living for more than 90 years — on skis, on a bike, on the golf course, camping with his family, on work sites from the Arctic to the jungles of Indonesia. After a prolonged decline, he died peacefully, surrounded by music, family and love.\n\nAt his funeral, his boyhood friend of 86 years — now a 91-year-old retired Anglican priest built of the same stern stuff as my father — pushed aside his walker and headed to the front of the church on his own steam. He recounted their childhood in small-town Alberta and a shared goal of saving enough pocket money to buy a few golf clubs. They golfed together regularly for most of their lives and even sometimes fought over those golf games, he said with a chuckle.\n\nMy sisters and I, now no longer caregivers, rolled our eyes. We knew those golf fights were not simply heated arguments over whose ball should have been where, but had, on at least one occasion, been settled with fists.\n\nAdvertisement 23\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMy father left a mark on life. The minister who presided over his funeral, in a whimsical small-town twist, was taught Grade 3 by my mother and worked as a draftsman at the same company as my dad before switching careers. The minister once travelled for a brief work stint in Venezuela where my father had previously worked. When people in the Venezuela office learned where he was from they asked about my father. “Do you know Al Payne? He is a legend here.”\n\nThat is how I want to be remembered, as someone who left a mark on people, said the minister before concluding the ceremony.\n\nMy father was lucky and so were we. Still, he deserved a better ending.\n\nLongform journalism like The Fall takes investment to produce.
