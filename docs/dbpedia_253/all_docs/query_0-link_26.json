        "text": "Send tips | Subscribe here | Email Zi-Ann l Follow Politico Canada\n\nWelcome to the Ottawa Playbook, I’m your host ZI-ANN LUM with SUE ALLAN and ANDY BLATCHFORD. On Day 21, we share low lights from Day 20 and discuss the politics of inflation. NICK TAYLOR-VAISEY will be back next week. Like you, we can’t wait.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nTHINGS ARE FINE — There is no keeping track of the dumpster fires in Ottawa — a G-7 capital now in multiple states of emergency.\n\nThe head of Ottawa’s police board was ousted a day after the police chief resigned. “I have never seen so much vitriol at city council in the 12 years I’ve been covering it,” the CBC’s JOANNE CHIANELLO said of last night’s Zoom meeting that was as hard to watch as it was to look away.\n\n“We’ve got to pull ourselves together,” The Logic’s DAVID REEVELY, a close observer of governments of all levels, tweeted at the close of the night.\n\nSpeaker ANTHONY ROTA said the same when he flipped his QP list on Wednesday afternoon and urged MPs in the Commons to get a grip. “I have been receiving emails from people who are watching us at home and they are pretty ashamed of their Parliament because of all the shouting that goes on,” he said.\n\nOutside on Wellington and the other streets around Parliament, police were handing out flyers — one side English, the other French — warning the occupiers to leave.\n\nSince invoking the Emergencies Act on Monday, the government has hosted a string of briefings to underline the threat they say is at play.\n\n“It may sound far out there in left field, but looking back over the last number of weeks … there’s a real danger in trivializing and diminishing exactly what’s going on here,” Public Safety Minister MARCO MENDICINO said Wednesday.\n\nOttawa is on edge. Police say to expect a crackdown “in the coming hours and days.”\n\n“We’re not going anywhere, we’re holding the line” a protester told POLITICO’s ANDY BLATCHFORD. “The whole world’s watching right now.”\n\n— Related reading: From pollster FRANK GRAVES and MICHAEL VALPY: Who supports the ‘freedom’ protesters and why.\n\nIDENTITY POLITICS — Back to question period, which got testy and deeply personal on Wednesday. Conservatives are demanding an apology from the PM after he claimed Tory members, writ large, are sympathetic with “people who wave swastikas” — a reference to a Nazi flag being spotted earlier in the month among convoy protesters on the Hill. The attack was a deflection after Conservative MP MELISSA LANTSMAN grilled the PM for fanning the flames of an “unjustified national emergency.”\n\n— Playback: Trudeau responded saying “Conservative Party members can stand with people who wave swastikas; they can stand with people who wave the Confederate flag.”\n\nLantsman is a Jewish MP who represents Thornhill. Her colleagues heckled and immediately jumped online to demand Trudeau retract his comment. Sturgeon River-Parkland MP DANE LLOYD stood in the chamber to denounce the “shameful” comments and apologize.\n\n“I have never seen such shameful and dishonorable remarks coming from the Prime Minister. My great-grandfather flew over 30 missions over Nazi Germany,” Lloyd said. “My great-great-uncle’s body lies at the bottom of the English Channel. There are members of this Conservative caucus who are the descendants of victims of the Holocaust.”\n\nLloyd tried three times to get an apology. Trudeau did not budge.\n\nLantsman showed up on Fox News a few hours later.\n\nTODAY'S HIGHLIGHTS\n\nPrime Minister JUSTIN TRUDEAU will deliver an address in the House at 10 a.m. on the implementation of the Emergencies Act. He’ll also meet with the Incident Response Group.\n\nDeputy Minister CHRYSTIA FREELAND will hold a presser at 11 a.m. with Public Safety Minister Mendicino and Minister of Emergency Preparedness BILL BLAIR. She is also down to attend QP.\n\n11 a.m. Chief Electoral Officer STÉPHANE PERRAULT will be at the House Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.\n\n11 a.m. Immigration Minister SEAN FRASER is on at the House Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration with department officials to take questions on the recruitment and acceptance rates of foreign students.\n\n11 a.m. Fisheries Minister JOYCE MURRAY will be at the House Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans with department officials to discuss her mandate letter.\n\n3:30 p.m. Transport Minister OMAR ALGHABRA is at the House Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities to discuss his mandate letter.\n\n3:30 p.m. Labour Minister SEAMUS O’REGAN and Employment Minister CARLA QUALTROUGH will be at the House Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nHALLWAY CONVERSATION\n\nPRICE-TAG POLITICS — Canada’s annual inflation rate accelerated to 5.1 percent last month to hit its fastest pace in three decades. The country’s red-hot price growth has now been above the Bank of Canada’s control range of 1 to 3 percent for 10 consecutive months.\n\nAnd the Conservatives have been trying for about just as long to pin the blame on Trudeau for the surging prices. The Conservatives, led by their No. 1 agitator PIERRE POILIEVRE, have also challenged Trudeau to come up with solutions to help households deal with the sharp rise in the cost of living.\n\nTrudeau’s Liberals insist they are making life more affordable for Canadians with measures they say will lower housing costs and their centerpiece program to create a national, $10-per-day child care. Powerful price growth has hit many economies, including the U.S., since the start of the pandemic. For the most part, it’s thanks to a mix of supply-chain bottlenecks and pent-up demand. But the Conservatives have also tried to pin the blame on Trudeau’s Keynesian state spending during the pandemic.\n\nWith red-hot inflation projected to stick around for a while, we shouldn’t expect the politics around it to disappear either.\n\nWe asked experts: How much of a political threat is Canada’s stubbornly high inflation to Justin Trudeau?\n\nSHACHI KURL, president of the Angus Reid Institute:\n\nAs is often the case, the answer is, “it depends!” Unlike a lot of issues in this country, those pertaining to money stress and the family wallet cut across the political spectrum. Whether people are on the right or the left, there isn’t a significant difference in the number [of individuals] who express worry about job loss, keeping up with the cost of living, or debt levels.\n\nSo, there are a couple of determinants of how much Trudeau might “wear” this issue or be threatened by it politically. The first is whether people hold the PM responsible for the kind of fiscal policy that has us in this situation with record high inflation, or whether they chalk it up to “circumstances.” On that — you will find more political delineation.\n\nSecondly, among those who hold their government and political leaders responsible — how Trudeau responds will matter. Does he seem empathetic? Is he dialed into what Canadians are experiencing? How do they have to respond by changing their consumption and spending? Can he convince Canadians he has a plan to fix it?\n\nCHRISTOPHER RAGAN, associate professor and the founding director of McGill University’s Max Bell School of Public Policy:\n\nFor the last roughly 30 years, inflation has been 2 percent plus or minus a little bit, which is not zero, but it’s pretty darn close to zero. And I think for most people, it’s low enough to be basically ignored.… What the central bank was doing in terms of raising or lowering interest rates was an issue, but inflation itself wasn’t a main-street issue.\n\nNow, we’ve got inflation…. So, 5 percent doesn’t sound like a lot higher than 2 percent, right? Five percent is hardly the end of the world. But it’s happening at a time when all of these supply chain disruptions are happening and there’s pent-up demand and some prices are going up at 20 percent. And other prices are going up at 10 percent and so inflation has become a main-street issue… You can’t ignore it because you’re noticing it when you go into the grocery store.\n\nI don’t think that can help any politicians. Even if Trudeau doesn’t run monetary policy, and even if Trudeau and CHRYSTIA FREELAND fully respect the operational independence of the Bank of Canada, and so they hive it off to the bank, they’re still running the government. They are still the most public faces of the government.\n\nInflation hurts, so don’t be surprised if that becomes a negative issue for the government. Of course, what you’ve seen is the political opposition trying to make hay out of this — and the truth is, it’s pretty easy to make hay out of this because inflation hurts. … It will inevitably hurt the government, whether it will hurt them enough is another matter.\n\nASK US ANYTHING\n\nTELL US WHAT YOU KNOW — What are you hearing that you need Playbook to know? Send it all our way.\n\nPAPER TRAIL\n\n— National defence wants wooden church pews. Twenty six of them must be 163-inches long, according to the tender. And no messing around: “No construction grade plywood, mdf, nova ply or particle board will be accepted in the backs, seats or any other part of the pew construction.”\n\n— While some Canadian companies are already working with U.S. farms on new biogas projects, Environment and Climate Change Canada is looking for a contractor to study waste-to-energy approaches “in the Canadian context” that can be used by decision and policy makers.\n\nWhat you may have missed\n\nSALON SPOTLIGHT — PETER MANSBRIDGE had a few things to get off his chest in the latest podcast episode of The Bridge. Before making a judgment on convoy politics and leadership, Mansbridge said he looked around to see what people were saying and found himself disappointed. In most cases, he said, it’s the “same old partisan crap.”\n\n— Micro to macro: Mansbridge tapped former Conservative minister JAMES MOORE and Trudeau’s former principal secretary GERRY BUTTS as guests. Both agreed the convoy occupation and protests have elevated to a crisis level.\n\nMoore rattled off a list of other crises facing the country with child care, dental care, pipeline building and competitiveness off the top of his head.\n\n— Order and odious expectations: “The fact that there’s unanimity in the federal parliament, unanimity in the Ontario provincial parliament, and clear overwhelming majority of public opinion sentiment that this is unlawful, unreasonable behavior — and forces that are supposed to be enforcing order in society are not capable to do so,” Moore said. “The public demands civilized behavior from each other — and so I think this constitutes a crisis.”\n\nButts said it would be a mistake to ignore the bigger picture here. “It’s stunning to me that what we consider to be relatively solid institutions, and sources of authority that could be drawn upon in instances like this one have withered so quickly under what is effectively a pretty weak onslaught.”\n\nMEDIA ROOM\n\n— APTN’s KATHLEEN MARTENS considers a question many have been asking: Is there an inequality gap when it comes to protesting?\n\n— The Logic’s CLAIRE BROWNWELL considers the reach of new surveillance requirements for crowdfunding platforms and financial services enacted under the Emergencies Act.\n\n— Welcome to Paradise, ANNA MARIA TREMONTI’s new podcast, has launched.\n\n— Maclean’s JASON MARKUSOFF reports from Alberta: “While much of Canada interprets this as a hardened anti-vaccine/anti-mandate/anti-Trudeau minority holding hostage a key economic corridor until policies bend to their wishes, the narrative the blockaders’ believers have internalized is them as peaceful conscientious objectors who will be welcomed by most right-thinking Canadians as liberators and freedom fighters.”\n\n— THE BIG STORY from Wednesday is definitely worth a listen — featuring TIMOTHY CAULFIELD, Canada Research Chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta: “What does learning to live with Covid really look like?”\n\n— The latest edition of POLITICO’s National Security Daily explains why Feb. 20 worries Russia watchers.\n\nPROZONE\n\nFor subscribers, here’s our Pro Canada PM memo: Crunching the numbers on inflation.\n\nIn other headlines for Pros:\n\n— Spotify removes song by Jan. 6 participant threatening
