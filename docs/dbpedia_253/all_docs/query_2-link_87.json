        "text": "The Boston Bruins traded 2023 Vezina Trophy winning goaltender Linus Ullmark to the Ottawa Senators on Monday in exchange for the Senators' 2024 first-round draft pick, forward Mark Kastelic and goaltender Joonas Korpisalo.\n\nAs part of the transaction, the Senators will retain 25% of Korpisalo’s remaining salary.\n\nIt answers a looming question the Bruins had about who they would have starting between the pipes next season.\n\nThe plan was for Ullmark to be Bruins’ No. 1 netminder to open this past season. Instead, he alternated with 25-year-old Jeremy Swayman, who was 25-10-8 in 43 starts with a 2.53 goals-against average during the regular season. The plan was to do the same in the playoffs; but after Ullmark lost Game 2 of the first-round series against Toronto, Swayman started the rest of the way, going 6-6 with a 2.15 GAA.\n\nBoston was eliminated by the Florida Panthers in six games in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nThe 30-year-old Ullmark spent three seasons in Boston, signing prior to the 2021-22 season as former goaltender Tuukka Rask attempted to return from a hip injury. When Rask's comeback attempt ended after just four games that season, Ullmark stepped in to the primary role and excelled, posting a NHL-best 1.89 goals-against average to help the Bruins set an NHL single-season wins record.\n\nSwayman had a .933 save percentage and 2.15 goals-against average in the postseason. In his two postseason starts, Ullmark had a .886 save percentage and 3.90 GAA. Ullmark's numbers were down from .915 and 2.57 during his 39 regular-season starts.\n\nUllmark is set to make $5 million next year. Swayman is expected get a raise from the $3.475 million he was awarded in arbitration.\n\nBoston's cupboard won't be completely empty behind Swayman with Ullmark gone.\n\nKorpisalo, 30, appeared in 55 games with Ottawa during the 2023-24 season, recording a record of 21-26-4 with a 3.27 goals- against average and .890 save percentage.\n\nIn addition, the Bruins earlier Monday signed depth goalie Brandon Bussi to a two-way contract for next season worth $775,000"
