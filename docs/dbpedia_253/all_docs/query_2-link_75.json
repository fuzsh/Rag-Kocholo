It disproportionally affects Indigenous women, immigrants, and the LGBTQ+ population due to disparities in access. Canada is transitioning to HPV testing from traditional pap test for screening because it is more sensitive and amenable to self-collection. However, HPV testing has low specificity which will increase colposcopy referrals. A sensitive and specific test that can be used for both clinician and self-collected samples is needed.\n\nInnovation: Fluorescence Interference Contrast (FLIC) has been shown to amplify the fluorescent signal of a desired biomarker within a biological sample. The technology can increase the signal-to-noise ratio using purposefully designed, semiconductor-manufactured nanostructured surfaces. In addition to its higher sensitivity and specificity, its multiplex capability enables the detection of a panel of biomarkers, including protein and nucleic acid targets.\n\nObjective: We propose to develop a new cervical cancer screening test using FLIC. While FLIC substrates have been shown for uniplex detection of COVID-related biomarkers, our goal is to achieve multiplex detection of both protein (e.g., p16 and Ki67) and nucleic acid (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) cervical cancer biomarkers using different fluorophores. The fluorescence signal amplified by the FLIC nano architecture will be detected by a multi-colour fluorescence scanner. A microfluidic device with inlets, outlets and mixing chamber using capillary action will be designed to house the FLIC substrate. Validation will be performed on clinical samples of clinical paps and self-collected vaginal swabs with known disease states ranging from normal to cancer in order establish sensitivity and specificity.\n\nFeasibility/Interdisciplinary team: Preliminary experiments by the bioengineer on the team have demonstrated proof-of-principle for the proposed FLIC technology. A panel of established biomarkers in cervical cancer have been identified by the clinician-scientist on the team who also have access to a biobank of patient samples and is a clinical expert in cervical cancer. Early accurate detection with our proposed test can potentially forego the need for conventional resource-intensive pap, improve access with self-collection, reduce unnecessary colposcopy referrals, and identify early disease amenable to curative treatment.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nBriciu, Bianca\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nSaint Paul University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nEducation for Human Flourishing: Building Communities of Resilience, Well-Being and Connection for a Regenerative University\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$102,587\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nSéguin, Michaël\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nOgilvie, Jean; Bureau, Marquis; Ste-Marie, Lorraine\n\nResearch summary\n\nFor a long time, mental health problems were seen as the sole responsibility of individuals, but there is now a better understanding of their social roots as trauma responses to harmful environments. If the sources of the current mental health crisis are systemic, we need systemic solutions such as the potential of higher education to contribute to resilience and trauma integration. This project aims to develop and test a systems-based model for trauma integration that challenges the separation-based paradigm of higher education by developing a resilient, relational and inclusive worldview that fosters well-being. We will create two six-month-long learning communities, one for students and one for professors, meeting monthly to engage in a series of transformative practices such as mindfulness, generative dialogue, somatics, and psycho-spiritual awareness. We will employ the 40-item Well-Being Assessment created at Harvard University to measure participants’ levels of flourishing before and after the process, as well as focus groups to understand how the practices contributed to their resilience, well-being and connection, while transforming their vision of higher education. We draw on theories and participatory methodologies from four disciplines:\n\neducation (integral, transformative learning),\n\npsychology (depth psychology, positive psychology and trauma theories),\n\nspirituality (mindfulness and diverse spiritual practices) and\n\nsociology (theory of resonance).\n\nThe purpose is to synthesize elements of transformation in each of them to create a new and innovative approach that contributes to a regenerative university. This means to replace the normalization of trauma based structures with practices that foster well-being. While psychology and education have a long history of collaboration, the aspect of spirituality in relation to education and trauma healing has only recently started to receive attention. The sociology of resonance explores relational ways of being that can overcome the alienation and acceleration of modern life. It has not yet been explored in relation to the other three disciplines. This action research is high risk since it is novel, complex, inclusive of both students and professors, and it involves a considerable amount of time and work without a guarantee of the desired results. Its efficacy as a new approach for psycho-spiritual transformation and the positive systemic impact on the academia will be markers of high reward.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nOnguny, Philip\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nSaint Paul University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nA Kenyan Pilot Project to Develop an Interdisciplinary Ecosystem Approach to the \"Sex for Fish\" and Gender-Based Violence Among African Fishing Communities\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$225,660\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nArya, Neil\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nOdera, Caroline; Hyman, Ilene; Orawo, Patricia\n\nResearch summary\n\nThe roles/expectations of men and women in many African fishing communities are still defined by traditional gender roles: men do the fishing and women sell the catch to local markets. However, women in fish trade are increasingly trapped in a form of transactional sex where local fishermen seek sexual favours to grant sell of their catch – a practice called “sex for fish” or “jaboya” along Lake Victoria. With depleting fish stock and scarce socio-economic opportunities, women in fishing communities are increasingly vulnerable to these practices despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the region. Unsafe social norms also discourage men and women in these communities from seeking care, social services, and alternative livelihood opportunities.\n\nObjective: This project develops an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach to enhance knowledge and understanding of the core drivers of “sex for fish” and related gender-based violence (GBV) using evidence from Kenya. It will: study and document the core determinants of \"sex for fish\" and GVB to increase public awareness and advocacy actions; develop training materials to support preventative and response measures by community health workers; and explore sustainable entrepreneurship skills and alternative livelihoods for women at risk of sexual exploitation.\n\nNovelty/significance: Despite the awareness around “sex for fish” and GBV, there is limited research on how and why many fishing communities in Africa are increasingly predisposed to these practices. Existing studies emphasize the lack of entrepreneurship skills and livelihood opportunities for women at risk and survivors of GBV. While such perspectives have been useful in strengthening women’s financial independence, they have challenged male norms of authority in these communities, leading to more incidences of GBV against women. Also, the challenges and solutions to these practices stretch well beyond economic explanations. A complex interplay between social (e.g., structural stigma), economic (e.g., poverty), environmental (e.g., overfishing), and health (e.g., mental health) factors also inform these practices. This project takes an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach (high risk) and gender-based analysis to develop tools that will enhance knowledge, understanding, and response to \"sex for fish\" and GBV in fishing communities. Given the prevalence of these practices in other African countries, the project holds scalability potential (high reward).\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nFroehlich Chow, Amanda\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\n\nApplication Title:\n\nNîsowak ~ Walking Together: Co-Creating Indigenous-Rooted, Land-Based and Physical Literacy Enriched Early Learning Environments\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$199,937\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nHouser, Natalie\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nErlandson, Marta; Brussoni, Mariana; Humbert, Margaret; Kriellaars, Dean; Stevenson, Erica; Wahpepah, Kathleen\n\nResearch summary\n\nResearch Purpose: To promote wholistic wellness among Indigenous early years children and address the health disparities experienced by Indigenous children and youth, particularly in rural and remote areas of Saskatchewan. Using Indigenous research methods and a community-based participatory action research approach, we will co-create an Indigenous-rooted model for constructing physical literacy enriched land-based early learning environments. Our research objectives target multi-level ecological factors (individual, interpersonal, institutional, community and policy) within early learning settings, including educator knowledge and behaviors associated with promoting wellness; revitalized physical environments encouraging children to increase their outdoor/land-based play while exploring relationality with the land; and increased access to family supports to foster intergenerational bonds.\n\nResearch Approach: Grounded in the Indigenous philosophies of ceremonial research and ethical space and guided by etuaptmumk (Two-eyed Seeing), the initiative will braid Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing about wholistic wellness and land-based learning with Western knowledge of physical literacy to create decolonized and physical literacy enriched early learning environments. To assess program effectiveness and child/family/educator experiences, mixed methods (including Indigenous research methods) will guide data collection and analysis. Key to the project will be co-creating culturally-rooted data gathering tools to guide conversational story sharing methods, arts-based methods, and physical literacy enriched land-based environmental scans.\n\nNovelty & Impact: The co-creation of an Indigenous-rooted model assures relevancy to a range of Indigenous cultures and contexts. Although our integrated and community-led team has, over 5 years, created and assessed impacts of culturally-rooted physical literacy enriched early learning settings, our current data collection tools have failed to effectively assess changes in child wellness in a culturally meaningful and sustainable way. Thus, the proposed project outcomes will be tailored to each diverse First Nations and Métis community and early learning setting, ensuring inclusivity, sustainability, and effectiveness in supporting wholistic wellness. By promoting wholistic wellness, the project aims to reduce health disparities and preserve Indigenous sovereignty in early childhood development approaches.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nRouleau, Nicolas\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nWilfrid Laurier University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nBuilding modular circuits with bioengineered neural tissues to design brain-inspired artificial intelligences\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$233,750\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nO'Connor, Rodney; Levin, Michael; Roskies, Adina\n\nResearch summary\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform healthcare, transportation, media, manufacturing, and many other aspects of our daily lives. However, AI tools are notoriously inefficient, requiring large training datasets and gigawatts of power to solve real-world problems. Many of the same problems are regularly solved by humans with brains that require few examples, operate at body temperature, and use only 20 watts of power. Shaped by billions of years of selection pressures, brains use unknown algorithms to perform highly efficient computations that predict outcomes and make complex decisions in real-time. Identifying and exploiting these algorithms to improve AI is an explicit goal of the field of neuromorphic engineering, which promises to bridge the efficiency gap by integrating brain-based computation with AI, thus creating a superior “NeuroAI”. As we engineer hardware and software to solve problems like brains do, we will see marked improvements in the performance of autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostic tools. The ethical development of a NeuroAI to benefit society will require an interdisciplinary approach that combines neuroscience, computer science, cognitive science, robotics, and moral philosophy. While most efforts to derive breakthrough algorithms and network architectures from neural cells have relied on the activities of monolayer cultures, the increased complexity of 3D bioengineered neural tissues offers greater physiological relevance. The main objective of our proposed research is to derive computational strategies from the signaling dynamics of tissue-engineered neural building blocks in custom biological circuits that will inform the engineering of NeuroAI. Our approach, informed by ethical analyses of embodied mind, will involve the microfabrication of mesoscale neural building blocks composed of neurospheroids. Then, we will record their electrical activity from conformal multielectrode arrays to isolate algorithms and networking properties. Next, to simulate an embodied nervous system with sensory input, patterned electrical stimulation will be used to entrain recurrent activations. Electrical feedback from the neural building blocks will, in turn, modulate stimulation inputs to form a closed-loop system that learns and adapts. Task-specific goals will be created to evaluate the computational efficiency of the neural building block assemblies. The research program will address a growing need for efficient AI systems.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nWakeling, James\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nSimon Fraser University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nMuscle design for optimal movement\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$245,072\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nDe Groote, Friedl\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nNigam, Nilima\n\nResearch summary\n\nWhy are there different types of muscle fibre? Why are some fibres oblique to the line of action? How does the additional mass of fat that accumulates with obesity, and the additional stiffness that develops during ageing affect the way we move? Musculoskeletal (MSK) simulations that predict human movement based on mathematical models of the neuromusculoskeletal system can reveal causal relationships between musculoskeletal properties and locomotion mechanics and energetics. However, to date, such simulations have used simple muscle models that neglect fibre type composition, geometrical detail and fat. Our ambition is to incorporate more realistic muscle models into predictive simulations of whole-body movement to answer fundamental questions about how the structure and function of muscle shapes movement in humans, and across the animal kingdom.\n\nUntil recently it has not been possible to implement realistic muscle models in predictive simulations of movement due to the computational resources and mathematical approaches required to handle their increased complexity. Our research program requires the collective expertise of physiologists and engineers to integrate physiology into the simulations from the single-fibre level through to whole body energetics. Our team is led by pioneers in realistic muscle modelling (models of muscle shape, mass, fat, fibre-type and stiffness) and MSK simulations (rapid and efficient algorithms for predictive MSK simulations). We will challenge the current paradigm for MSK simulations of human and animal movement, incorporating advanced and realistic muscle models into novel MSK simulation frameworks for the first time, enabling these questions about muscle structure and function to be finally addressed.\n\nWe will widely disseminate our models and simulations to foster breakthroughs in many related research domains, such as rehabilitation medicine, sports sciences, and comparative biomechanics. Our previous model and simulation developments have been integrated into the open-source MSK simulation package (OpenSim) that has been downloaded 250,000 times by clinicians, sports scientists, physiologists and biomedical engineers. We plan to follow a similar approach here.\n\nMuscle makes up half of our body mass and is critical to mobility, health and pushing the boundaries of human performance. The questions that we will address will rigorously increase our understanding of muscle design and movement across the animal kingdom.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nShkurti, Florian\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nApplication Title:\n\nMonitoring Microplastics in Freshwater Across the Great Lakes via Autonomous Robot Boats\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$245,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nBarfoot, Timothy\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nWells, Mathew\n\nResearch summary\n\nCanada is endowed with nearly 20% of the world's fresh water supply, the third largest on the planet, according to Environment Canada. We have as many as 2 million lakes and hundreds of thousands of kilometres of rivers. This is a strategic advantage for a country that accounts for 0.4% of the world's total population. The waste caused by increased urbanisation, agricultural and industrial activity, microplastics, as well as climate change, imposes additional stresses on the hydrological cycle of this water supply. Water is clearly one of Canada’s largest and most precious resources, yet one that we often take for granted. We know alarmingly little about the health of these freshwater bodies, because we lack systematic, scalable, rapid, and automated ways to monitor and take observations of these environments. In this proposal, we will enable consistent, rapid, and scalable monitoring of water quality in the Great Lakes. We plan to do this by developing both robust robotics navigation technology and cutting-edge water sampling and imaging systems that will enable a team of autonomous robot boats carrying these sensors to make in-situ measurements and data analysis of water quality, and specifically microplastics concentration. Microplastics detection and characterization is currently done manually by biologists, who need to analyze their samples by large spectrometers that are located in labs. This is a very time-consuming process and a bottleneck for understanding the risks affecting freshwater environments, with poorly understood downstream effects on public health. We will develop a novel, portable underwater microplastics sensor, the first of its kind in the world, to enable real-time and in-situ characterization of microplastics in our waters. Our proposed robotic system that carries these sensors will help provide scientific and public health policy insights about water quality in real-time and in a way that easily scales as the number of robots increases. Our team brings together an interdisciplinary group of roboticists, biologists, chemists oceanographers, and researchers with background in public health, who push the boundary of what is possible today in water quality monitoring.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nBanerjee, Arinjay\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\n\nApplication Title:\n\nField-to-lab: Mechanistic interrogation of factors that drive virus spillover from bats\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$247,912\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nBecker, Daniel\n\nResearch summary\n\nEmerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a profound threat to human health, a fact underscored by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most EIDs originate in wildlife, and bat species are well-established as harboring many zoonotic viruses. Bats are confirmed reservoir hosts for Hendra and Nipah virus, lyssaviruses, Marburg virus, and SARS-like coronaviruses (CoVs). Yet with few exceptions (e.g., lyssaviruses), these otherwise virulent viruses do not cause observable disease in bats. Several identified tolerance mechanisms include constitutive expression of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and a dampened inflammatory response. However, such findings are limited to a small subset of bat diversity (1400+ species) and bat–virus relationships. The mechanisms by which bats tolerate virulent viruses remain poorly understood, in large part stemming from a lack of integrating field studies of the bat immune response to viruses with in vitro experimental tests.\n\nRelationships between bats and CoVs are of high interest for assessing zoonotic risk. CoVs are RNA viruses that contain at least seven human viruses: two and five in the genera Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV) and Betacoronavirus (β-CoV), respectively. Bat CoVs are highly diverse, and the origins of pathogenic α-CoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV NL63) and β-CoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) have been ascribed to bats. However, our understanding of bat–CoV interactions remains limited to rare experimental bat systems. To characterize bat–CoV interactions more broadly, coupled field and in vitro studies are critically needed. Our proposed field studies will identify naturally circulating viruses and the wild bat immune response, and experimental interrogation of the antiviral responses in cells and mini-organ (organoid) cultures derived from wild bats will holistically explain the innate immune responses that are observed in our wild-caught bats.\n\nOur goal is to establish an iterative pipeline for characterizing bat–virus relationships in the wild and then in in vitro systems for experimental assessment. Such work will be especially critical for identifying the impacts of intrinsic and extrinsic stressors on bat–virus interactions, as reproductive status, food scarcity, hibernation, and migration have all been speculated to be factors that can disrupt bat tolerance and facilitate shedding infectious virus. Data from our studies will inform policies to mitigate the threats from emerging zoonotic pathogens.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nArvisais, Olivier\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversité du Québec à Montréal\n\nApplication Title:\n\nAu-delà des bombes pour les élèves ukrainiens: stress, santé globale, vulnérabilités et protection, vers des actions humanitaires de précision soutenant l'apprentissage.\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$248,686\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nBrault Foisy, Lorie-Marlène\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nCharland, Patrick; Audet, Francois; Hwang, Heungsun; Marin, Marie-France; Turnbull, Jennifer\n\nResearch summary\n\nPlus de 400 millions d’enfants vivent actuellement dans des zones touchées par des conflits armés. Il existe un besoin urgent et croissant de recherche pour éclairer les efforts visant à comprendre, prévenir et atténuer les conséquences éventuelles de cette violence. La capacité d’apprendre est l’une des plus grandes ressources dont dispose l’être humain. En temps de guerre, cette ressource est considérablement menacée et les premières victimes sont les enfants.\n\nL’objectif du projet de recherche est de mieux comprendre l’impact de la guerre sur la capacité d’apprendre des enfants. Nos objectifs spécifiques sont :\n\nde mieux comprendre les interactions entre les caractéristiques psychobiosociales des enfants et leur capacité d’apprendre;\n\nd’établir des profils et d’identifier les variables clés pouvant soutenir des actions humanitaires de précision ayant pour but de favoriser l’apprentissage.\n\nNotre projet explorera quatre construits auprès d’enfants déplacés ukrainiens de 8 à 10 ans (N=240 ♂/♀) :\n\napprentissage;\n\nstress;\n\nvulnérabilités ⇌ protection et\n\nsanté globale.\n\nAfin de mesurer l’apprentissage, les habiletés des fonctions exécutives (inhibition, mémoire de travail, flexibilité) seront évaluées à l'aide de tâches. Nous recueillerons aussi les résultats scolaires des élèves et ils prendront part à un test standardisé en mathématiques, en sciences et en lecture. Pour évaluer le stress, nous utiliserons des mesures variées comme le cortisol, une échelle de stress perçu et la réponse physiologique en situation. Concernant les vulnérabilités et la protection, nous utiliserons différentes échelles mobilisant des concepts comme le bien-être, la résilience et le coping. Enfin, nous procéderons à une mesure rapide de la santé globale pédiatrique. Afin de mettre en lumière les relations entre les variables, nous effectuerons des analyses par modélisation assistée par intelligence artificielle (IA).\n\nCe projet inédit est au croisement entre les sciences de l’éducation, de la psychologie et de la pédiatrie et propose des méthodes d’analyse de pointe qui pourraient avoir des répercussions considérables. En effet, dans les contextes aux ressources extrêmement limitées et sous grande tension qui se multiplie, il est aujourd’hui devenu primordial de produire des données probantes permettant la mise en œuvre d’actions humanitaires de précisions pour les médecins, les psychologues et les enseignants soutenant la capacité d’apprendre des enfants.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nCampeau-Lecours, Alexandre\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversité Laval\n\nApplication Title:\n\nTowards a reduction in musculoskeletal disorders at work through the development of an ergonomic intelligent feedback system\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$248,500\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nMercier, Catherine; Bouyer, Laurent; Roy, Jean-Sebastien\n\nResearch summary\n\nWork-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMD) represent a major scourge for the health and safety of workers. The healthcare costs and productivity losses associated solely with injuries to the upper limbs and back are estimated at 3.6 billion dollars per year in Canada. These injuries have a significant social cost for workers, including difficulty in performing daily life activities, pain, loss of mobility, forced early retirement, and reduced quality of life. These issues are even more pressing in the current labor shortage context, which will continue to grow due to the aging population.\n\nPrimary prevention of musculoskeletal disorders thus needs to be improved in workplaces. Currently, prevention interventions are carried out on a case-by-case basis by safety professionals who provide advice on how to perform tasks safely. However, there are no tools to objectively measure the muscular demands. This prevents practitioners from conducting a quantitative assessment and measuring behavior retention over time. The lack of quantitative feedback for workers can lead to decreased retention and reducing the effectiveness of long-term interventions.\n\nThe goal is to prevent musculoskeletal injuries and facilitate the gradual return to work for manual workers who have been injured, using wearable technologies.\n\nThe objectives are:\n\nTo develop and validate intelligent algorithms that provide a quantitative measurement of upper extremity muscular demand in real time using wearables, thus eliminating the need for human analysis intervention.\n\nTo enhance these algorithms to automatically adjust to individual users' characteristics.\n\nTo implement these algorithms in a wearable device capable of providing real-time feedback.\n\nvalidate the device’s effectiveness.\n\nThe team will consist of users, researchers and HQP from various disciplines (engineering, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and neurophysiology) that will provide a fresh perspective not typically seen in traditional collaborations.\n\nWe are developing a completely new paradigm for real-time monitoring of muscle fatigue through algorithms. This initiative holds promise to significantly impact not just a single community, but multiple strata of society. This project stands to resolve a long-standing societal issue, fundamentally shifting the paradigm in WRMD prevention and rehabilitation. It opens a new area of discovery and changes the direction of thought across multiple disciplines.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nGadbois, Simon\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nDalhousie University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nWhat are Dogs Trained to Alert for PTSD Detecting in Trauma Cue Breath Samples? An Olfactory Learning and Psychophysics Study\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$248,587\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nBudge, Suzanne\n\nResearch summary\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric condition involving a persistent stress response to a trauma (i.e., a life-threatening event such as military combat, physical/sexual assault, disaster). About 61% of men and 51% of women in the general population experience trauma during their lifetime. A minority develop PTSD (7–8% of the general population) with many more experiencing subthreshold symptoms. Current first-line treatments (exposure therapy; pharmacotherapy) are effective yet suboptimal, leading to a quest for effective alternatives. PTSD service dogs are trained to provide personalized assistance, including an alerting function to warn patients of early signs of PTSD symptoms and a distracting function to prevent escalation. While canines’ superior olfaction capabilities are the claimed mechanism underlying their ability to perform such functions, there are few controlled experiments of dogs’ abilities in this regard. Those that do exist demonstrate dogs’ abilities to detect stress but in healthy human participants. We have recently conducted the first proof-of-concept study showing that some dogs can learn to detect and discriminate breath samples collected from humans with trauma histories when they are exposed to personalized trauma cues (vs. baseline). Moreover, one dog’s performance was correlated with the human participants’ fear responses, and the other dog’s performance was correlated with the human participants’ shame responses, to the trauma cue. We aim to replicate and extend our initial study by:\n\nquantifying the volatiles that dogs are detecting in the human breath samples (e.g., adrenaline- or cortisol-derived) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry;\n\ncollecting other aspects of the humans’ responses to the trauma cue exposure (e.g., state PTSD symptoms, state stress, heart rate, galvanic skin response) and examining relations to dog performance; and\n\nexamining canine detection performance following a longer training period. This study brings together a psychiatry research team, a canine olfactory learning and psychophysics team and an analytical biochemistry team.\n\nThe proposed research is both high risk (a highly novel field with only a single proof-of-concept study where there is thus potential for non-replication) and high reward (potential to lead to development of useful training protocols for PTSD service dogs; a future trial of trained PTSD service dogs as an adjunct to first-line PTSD treatment).\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nHosale, Mark-David\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nYork University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nSensingChange: Black carbon air pollution detection and critical artworks\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$248,428\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nGrau, Gerd\n\nResearch summary\n\nAirborne black carbon (BC) pollution is a worldwide contributor to rising global temperatures and an ongoing public health crisis. The World Health Organization estimates BC causes two million premature deaths annually. It is the invisible threat in both vehicle exhaust and wildfire smoke, yet public knowledge of its effects remains low. This is partially due to significant obstacles in obtaining scientifically accurate measurements of the BC particulate matter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5) which is most harmful to human health. High-fidelity sensors are either expensive and immobile, preventing the necessary density of localized readings, or cannot make direct measurements because they require slow and costly lab analysis. Another challenge is cultural: governments and activists confront an increasingly polarized and skeptical public, and many people do not grasp how directly they are impacted by BC air pollution because particulate < 2.5 µm is invisible. Our team integrates art, science, and engineering, proposing to co-create novel BC sensors and deploy them in city streets. This involves the development of a sensor capable of isolating BC particulate integrated into a smart electronic wearable, scaffolded by public art interventions designed to educate and empower citizen scientists to see BC pollution levels and act on their findings.\n\nOur project objectives are:\n\nDesign a sensor for isolating airborne BC particulate in real-time.\n\nIntegrate it into wearables logging real-time geolocated BC data.\n\nCreate a community driven database online to publish findings.\n\nFacilitate public art performances in which citizens wear the sensor embedded into eye catching wearables walking through their neighborhood, visibly revealing their lived experience with air pollution.\n\nFurther knowledge dissemination through workshops, publications and exhibitions.\n\nOur artwork will be collectively produced for the earnest purpose of solving a global issue, high risks in the arts due to the field’s continued Postmodernist emphasis on subjectivity, skepticism, and rejection of sincerity. In engineering it is high risk as this specific use of graphene for BC measurement remains unproven and is high risk in science because of the difficulties involved in public data collection. However, our bold project is high reward because if successful, it will result in simultaneous advancements in engineering, art and science and potentially dramatic public health benefits.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nDahmen, Joseph\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nThe University of British Columbia\n\nApplication Title:\n\nModular mycelium composting toilet\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$249,428\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nMoraes, Christopher; Hallam, Steven\n\nResearch summary\n\nObjectives of the Proposed Research Project\n\nThis innovative interdisciplinary project will apply advances in microbiology, mycology and design to create a modular composting toilet. The waterless toilet will utilize designer microbes and mycelium biocomposjtes to convert human waste to valuable soil products. It will offer an ecologically sound alternative for portable chemical toilets, providing a sustainable waste management solution in locations where access to infrastructure is difficult or costly. Combining biodegradable mycelium biocomposites, which are grown rather than manufactured, with engineered microbial communities, has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of time required to convert solid human waste to valuable soil products, contributing to a nutrient cycle that will safely enrich local ecosystems.\n\nNovelty of Research Approach\n\nThe proposed interdisciplinary project will engage in novel research in three different areas:\n\nIt is a novel application of mycelium biocomposites. These materials, which consist of fungal root structures grown on waste cellulose from the agricultural and forestry sectors, have attracted significant research interest in the past decade as sustainable alternatives to petroleum-derived rigid polystyrene foams. The project will contribute new insights on applications that capitalize on the thermal resistance and biodegradability of these materials.\n\nThe project will also contribute new insights in the field of microbiology, providing information on microbe-fungal interactions as well as mixed microbial communities involved in lignocellulosic and waste stream biomass decomposition.\n\nThe research will also contribute valuable research on the circular economy through agricultural waste upcycling and point-source treatment of human waste. It upcycles cellulosic byproducts of the forestry and agricultural sectors, adding value to products that might otherwise be considered waste.\n\nExpected Significance\n\nCentralized wastewater treatment plants are capital intensive and account for three percent of global energy demand. The proposed low-cost modular toilet will eliminate the need for energy and chemical inputs, while creating valuable soils that contribute to healthy ecosystems. The high-risk high reward interdisciplinary project has potential to positively impact remote communities across Canada, as well as 2.3 billion people who lack access to adequate sanitation globally.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nDiallo, Jean-Simon\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nOttawa Hospital Research Institute\n\nApplication Title:\n\nImproving and accelerating viral therapeutics biomanufacturing through lipidomics method\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$249,573\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nSmith, Jeffrey\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nFarid, Suzanne; Boddy, Christopher\n\nResearch summary\n\nFor Canadians to have first access to new vaccines and high-quality biotherapeutics, applied research in biomanufacturing for the development and adoption of innovative technologies is required. Viral medicines include all therapeutic products that involve a virus as a component. This includes vaccines and cell gene therapies for regenerative medicine or cancer treatment. Rapid scale-up manufacturing of novel vectors is challenging and costly; the proposed project is geared toward applying and identifying technologies that enable efficient manufacturing of viral vectors. Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are widely used in clinical applications that involve the delivery of cell function-altering genetic material. Large-scale LV production requires “producing cells” to manufacture harvestable quantities of viral products that may be used for downstream therapies. While lipids represent crucial structural components of viral envelopes, limited information is available on the composition and roles of lipids in viral products and how they may be affected by variations in biomanufacturing processes. Some evidence has emerged that the lipid composition of viral membranes directly correlates with the biological activity of viral vectors. The impact of lipids on production efficiency in producing cells and on the quantity and efficacy of viroceuticals have not been studied before; this represents an emerging research domain in need of further exploration and development. To accomplish this goal, we've assembled a multidisciplinary team comprising experts in virology, cell biology, biomanufacturing, analytical and medicinal chemistry, as well as lipid analysis. Our aim is to gain a deeper understanding of how cell metabolism influences the composition of lipid envelopes in LVs (Lentiviral Vectors), as well as their efficacy and quality. The proposed project explores a new frontier in LV bio-manufacturing, a venture with potentially profound consequences. This endeavour places its primary emphasis on the following key objectives:\n\ndevelopment of novel methodology to assess the lipidomic dynamics of LV and LV producing cells during biomanufacturing,\n\ninvestigation of crucial components and the biological impacts of modulating lipid composition on the quality of LV-based viroceuticals.,\n\nestablishment of efficient methods to improve biomanufacturing and the quality of LV-based therapeutics by manipulating lipid metabolism pathways as well as through lipid modulation.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nMorin, David\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversité de Sherbrooke\n\nApplication Title:\n\nDialogues extrêmes et résilience démocratique : Comprendre pour mieux agir\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$249,518\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nHassan, Ghayda\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nBenoit, Maryse; Arsenault, Stephanie; Claveau, François; Hirsch, Sivane; Madriaza, Pablo; Venkatesh, Vivek\n\nResearch summary\n\nLes dernières années offrent un aperçu de notre difficulté collective à maintenir un dialogue sur certains sujets sensibles et clivants. La pandémie, la crise climatique, la question LGBTQ+, l’immigration ou la religion sont des questions qui, alimentées par les réseaux socionumériques et des mouvements socio-politiques, nourrissent des points de vue extrêmes et donnent lieu à des polarisations croissantes, conduisant parfois à la violence. Les moments de crise sont propices à ce type de déchirement du tissu social. A terme, le risque majeur est l’érosion d’un pilier démocratique, à savoir notre acceptation du dissensus comme condition du pluralisme politique et la légitimation de formes d’action anti-démocratique. La plupart des initiatives pour prévenir ces polarisations agissent sur certains aspects de la problématique (sécurité, santé mentale, éducation, régulation du numérique, etc.) et en périphérie des mouvements radicaux. Très peu envisagent un dialogue direct avec et entre ces personnes aux discours extrémistes. D'où le caractère à haut risque et novateur de ce projet de « dialogues extrêmes » dont l'objectif est de replacer et évaluer la délibération, comprise comme un processus à la fois cognitif, comportemental et émotif, en tant qu’approche de prévention de la radicalisation et des polarisations. En mobilisant de façon unique différentes disciplines selon une démarche commune, une méthodologie rigoureuse et un cadre éthique établi, nous testerons plusieurs méthodes de dialogue ayant fait leurs preuves dans d’autres contextes (entretien motivationnel, dialogue transpartisan, approche de contre-discours basés sur le témoignage et l’empathie) au sein des écosystèmes extrémistes au Canada tant en ligne que hors ligne afin de voir les changements qui s’opèrent sur les personnes à court et moyen termes. Porté par une équipe interdisciplinaire d’experts reconnus (science politique, philosophie, psychologie, pédagogie sociale, médecine et communication notamment), ce projet permettra de:\n\nproduire de nouvelles connaissances et données probantes sur l'extrémisme et la délibération comme outil de prévention,\n\ndévelopper de nouvelles approches et méthodes de dialogue pour les milieux de pratique (politique, éducation, services sociaux, communautaire, médias).\n\nA terme, les retombées pourraient être significatives pour les groupes de la population affectées par ces polarisations et plus globalement renforcer la résilience démocratique au Canada.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nSiegel, Peter\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nMcGill University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nSingle Cell Metabolomics: Uncovering Metabolic Heterogeneity and Revealing Novel Aspects of Tissue Architecture\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$249,276\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nSt-Pierre, Julie\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nQuail, Daniela; Avizonis, Daina\n\nResearch summary\n\nMetabolism is integral to tissue organization by determining cellular identity and function via mediating intercellular communication through metabolite secretion and uptake. However, the metabolic phenotypes of individual cells and how they contribute to the complex networks within tissues are poorly understood. This presents a significant gap in our knowledge of how cell biology impacts on physiology. While single-cell “omics” technologies are revolutionizing our understanding of tissue organization in health and disease, they are largely restricted to the analysis of nucleic acids. Single-cell metabolomics is considerably more challenging, in part, because metabolite-derived signals from individual cells cannot be amplified. However, because neither DNA sequence nor RNA transcript levels correlate directly with metabolite levels, direct single-cell metabolite measurements are vital to defining cellular states and understanding disease mechanisms. Significant challenges in robotics, engineering, nano-analytical chemistry, Sorganic chemistry, and biology have hampered previous efforts to bring metabolomics into the single-cell era, making projects in this field inherently risky. This project will take a unique approach to overcome these obstacles and develop a workflow for the measurement of targeted metabolites at single-cell resolution in cancer, neuronal, and immune cells. Combining innovative technologies and expertise from analytical chemistry, the biomedical sciences, and nanotechnology, we propose to develop an integrated platform for single-cell isolation and processing, followed by targeted metabolite detection with attomolar sensitivity. These cutting-edge cell handling, nano-liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry technologies have yet to be combined and applied to highly accurate biological models. This approach promises to yield transformative insights into metabolic organization, phenotypic heterogeneity, and plasticity at the single-cell level, empowering interdisciplinary studies of cancer, neurosciences, and immunology that would not otherwise be possible. The resulting knowledge will have significant potential to positively impact on the health of the Canadian population given the alarming increase of 76% (1990 to 2019) in early onset cancers and ongoing epidemics of other chronic diseases that disrupt cellular and metabolic networks within tissues.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nGold, Ian\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nMcGill University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nDelusions as social phenomena: An empirical test of the theory\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$249,642\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nShah, Jai\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nHirose, Iwao; Chakravarty, Mallar\n\nResearch summary\n\nThere are people who believe that computer chips implanted in their bodies are being used to track them, or that Paul McCartney is madly in love with them; that they are the Queen of 182 countries, or that they are the chief disciple of the Buddha; that the person they see in the mirror is a stranger, or that they are dead. These are examples of delusions – the pathological beliefs that are characteristic of psychotic illness, notably schizophrenia and psychotic dementia, and that have historically been closely associated with the most severe forms of mental illness. As the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers put it: “Since time immemorial delusion has been taken as the basic characteristic of madness. To be mad was to be deluded.”\n\nUnfortunately, the cognitive processes that underpin delusions remain controversial, and the brain networks associated with delusions are unknown. The standard cognitive accounts of delusions appeal to disorders both of perceptual experience, and of thinking or reasoning. In recent years, however, a new approach to delusions has been gaining ground according to which delusions are a disorder of a form of cognition devoted to navigating social life. The most promising version of this hypothesis is that delusions are the disordered outputs of a cognitive system that evolved to detect in social threats. To date, this proposal has been based largely on theoretical considerations; no significant empirical tests of the theory have been attempted. However, empirical confirmation of the social threat model of delusion would take psychosis research in a distinctly new direction. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to investigate the social threat hypothesis of delusion.\n\nThe cognitive theory of delusion has been developed by psychologists and philosophers, and the social threat model is rooted in social cognition. Experts on the clinical facts of delusion are psychiatrists who treat patients with schizophrenia and neurologists who treat dementia patients. The optimal behavioural paradigms to explore social threat are those developed by behavioural economics. For this reason, this project requires an interdisciplinary team with all of these disciplines represented. Team members have all of the expertise required to carry out this project successfully and have proven track records in project leadership and publication.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nMcQuinn, Brian\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Regina\n\nApplication Title:\n\nGraphing Emerging Threats: Making Social Networks More Resilient to Malicious Attacks\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$249,374\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nZilles, Sandra\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nKhodamoradi, Kamyar; Buntain, Cody; Taylor, Matthew\n\nResearch summary\n\nMore than half of all Canadian adults rely on social media for their news. Anti-democratic and malicious actors take advantage of social media’s reach to accelerate political extremism, stoke racial hatred, and spread disinformation – undermining democracy and public health.\n\nCombating disinformation, violent extremism, and foreign influence operations is challenging because social media networks are complex and dynamic. The data is varied (e.g., text and images) and highly contextualized in its meaning. Malicious actors circumvent many existing content-based approaches designed to thwart harmful content – requiring novel alternatives.\n\nGraph theory is a computer science and mathematics sub-discipline. It studies networks as dynamic systems, and many of its more theoretical insights remain untapped for studying social media networks. For example, graph burning theory models how influence or contagion spreads through complex networks. Applying this purely theoretical research to social media holds the potential of discovering unforeseen applications in understanding how malicious actors spread harmful content across online ecosystems.\n\nThis project brings together, for the first time to our knowledge, graph theorists, conflict experts, and computer scientists to strengthen the resilience of information spaces to harmful content. The team will develop graph theory algorithms tailored to:\n\nStrengthen monitoring by calculating the number and position of listening nodes;\n\nIncrease the effectiveness of “counter-information” messages by modeling information flow through networks;\n\nMaximize efforts to disrupt malicious actors by creating tools to identify central nodes in evolving and responsive networks.\n\nThe team will use a mixture of theory and simulations to accomplish this. The research builds on our Centre’s unique datasets collected over the last three years – many of which are no longer available on social media platforms (e.g., Russian influence networks in Canada and the Taliban’s social media ecosystem in Afghanistan). We will develop the network monitoring and deployment algorithms by adapting existing graph theory to settings where we can analyze only partial information about an extensive (and changing) network with different types of information that could spread between nodes. This project holds the potential to provide cutting-edge theory and tools for monitoring and protecting Canada’s online ecosystems.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nBrown, Jeremy\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nDalhousie University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nMiniature High-Resolution Micro-Ultrasound for Precision Neuro and Spine Surgery\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$249,447\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nWeeks, Adrienne; Christie, Sean\n\nResearch summary\n\nMotivation – Brain surgery: One of the most common brain tumours, glioblastoma multiform, is universally fatal and has a 1-year survival rate of just 25%. Due to the lack of non-invasive therapy options, the standard approach to treatment is surgery followed by chemotherapy. Even with the high mortality rate, studies show that a high degree of resection accuracy is directly correlated to increased survival and quality of life.\n\nMotivation – Spine surgery: By far the most frequent procedure in neurosurgery is the decompression of spinal nerves that are being compressed by a pathological structure (eg. herniated disc, bone spurs, etc.). The number of surgical interventions for these is over 1.2 million annually in the US alone, however, the revision rate is high due to the lack of intra-surgical confirmation of decompression.\n\nUltrasound has become an indispensable tool for intra-surgical guidance. Neuro and spine surgeries, however, are rapidly moving to minimally invasive approaches where the entire operation is performed endoscopically through a small corridor. These approaches are preferred over open surgery due to improved patient outcomes and faster recovery. Consequently, conventional imaging technologies such as ultrasound can no longer be used in these confined surgical corridors. Our interdisciplinary team has recently developed a unique, high-resolution, 3.5 mm diameter ultrasound probe specifically for minimally invasive brain and spine surgeries. The small form factor enables this probe to be used in surgeries that are performed through small surgical access routes, which would prevent standard clinical ultrasound technology from being used. The high resolution allows for real-time visualization of tumor and nerve boundaries with extremely high accuracy. This novel imaging platform has recently been approved for preliminary patient imaging studies and has already produced promising, first-of-its kind data during brain tumour resection and spinal decompression surgeries. Initial image data collected suggests that the boundaries between tumors and healthy tissue can be visualized, as well as compressed nerves in and around the spinal cord. The proposed project will focus on refining the imaging technology and validating that our high-resolution imaging probe can quantifiably identify any remaining residual tumor during minimally invasive neurosurgery, as well as objectively confirm nerve decompression during minimally invasive spine surgery.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nPerez-Brumer, Amaya\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nApplication Title:\n\nEstamos Aquí (We are here): Creative-relational inquiry into spaces of belonging to support migrant sex workers thriving in Colombia and Peru\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$246,522\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nKonda, Kelika; Juando Prats, Clara; Montenegro Ramírez, Paola; Murray, Laura; Parker, Caroline; Silva-Santisteban, Alfonso\n\nResearch summary\n\nThis NFRF Exploration project, Estamos Aquì (We Are Here), is led by an early career scholar and catalyzes multisectoral and multidisciplinary collaborations to advance strength-based approaches and promote migrant sex workers thriving in Colombia and Peru. Latin America is currently facing its largest recorded mass migration due to the Venezuelan refugee crisis. Over 7.3 million Venezuelans, about 20% of the country's population, have been displaced since 2014 due to political turmoil and humanitarian crises. Over 80% of displaced Venezuelans currently reside in neighboring Latin American countries; Colombia hosts more than 2.5 million and Peru around 1.5 million Venezuelans. Further, South-South migration trajectories in the region are common, namely and gender and sexual minorities and cisgender women. Sex work is a key dimension to assess in migration research as known systemic inequities can lead to engagement in sex work and vulnerability to human-trafficking, particularly for women, girls and sexual and gender minorities. To move beyond a deficit-based model and support transformative action, it is crucial that migration research, especially for those at increased vulnerability, centre community-based experiences of strength and solidarity and culturally responsive solutions. The goal of Estamos Aquí, is to reframe South-South migration research among sex workers in Colombia and Peru from one of scarcity to one of belonging and vibrancy. Guided by Latin American Social Medicine and creative-relational inquiry this project reflects a partnership with community, journalists, key within-country social service providers (e.g. ProFamilia and United Nations International Office of Migration), and academic researchers. Our project employs three high-risk and high-reward strategies:\n\nArts and performance based-methods to collaboratively evidence how migrant sex workers enact agency and autonomy in migration trajectories;\n\nCreate and disseminate public knowledge campaigns (e.g. photo journalism, graffiti, digital stories) to address pervasive xenophobia; and\n\nCo-design culturally situated scalable strategies to support migrant sex worker thriving across health, media, and public policy.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nFord, Nancy\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nThe University of British Columbia\n\nApplication Title:\n\nEffects of e-cigarettes on respiratory and oral health\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nLaronde, Denise; Bertram, Allan\n\nResearch summary\n\nThe use of e-cigarettes has rapidly increased particularly among Canadian adolescents and young adults, with an estimated 20% of those aged 15-24 having tried e-cigarettes. Across North America, clinical cases of e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injuries (EVALI) have been reported, with serious health outcomes including hospitalization and death. Diagnosis for these patients included chest radiographs and CT (computed tomography) scans showing reduced lung function, airway obstruction, and gas trapping. EVALI has been linked to hazardous ingredients in e-cigarettes such as nicotine, vitamin E acetate, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).\n\nThe goal of this project is to investigate the impact of e-cigarette use on respiratory and oral health. We will characterize commercially available vaping fluids (with/without nicotine) to determine the chemical composition of the fluid and vapour, and identify what chemicals are deposited into lung and oral tissues. We will also investigate the properties of the aerosols generated under different vaping conditions. To assess health outcomes, we will expose mice to the two vaping fluids or air (control) and use micro-CT scans to non-invasively monitor changes in lung structure and function over a 6-month exposure period. From the images, we will identify regions of air trapping, airway blockages, and measure lung function. The mice will undergo head CT to investigate anatomical changes in bone in the nasal passages, bone loss as a marker of periodontal disease, and histological assessment of the soft tissue to identify precancerous lesions.\n\nThe novelty of this research is the unique combination of chemical and aerosol analysis of vaping fluids with the use of in vivo mouse models to non-invasively monitor over an extended timeframe the changes (if any) to the respiratory system and the oral cavity. Performing the chemical and aerosol studies of vaping fluids alongside the in vivo mouse exposure model will allow for enhanced understanding of the interaction between the chemical and biological systems. We believe these in vivo studies coupled with chemical analysis of vaping fluids are critical for evaluation of vaping products for safety. The impact of this research will be an increased understanding of the ingredients in commercially available e-cigarette fluids and their impact on respiratory and oral health, which would lead to improved product labeling and vital evidence-informed regulation by Health Canada.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nYunusova, Yana\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nApplication Title:\n\nDigital neurologic assessment: An AI solution for development of remote cranial nerve examination\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nSejdic, Ervin\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nBarnett-Tapia, Carolina; Abrahao, Agessandro; Jewett, Gordon; Khosravani, Houman; Ritsma, Benjamin\n\nResearch summary\n\nThere is a critical unmet need for innovative clinical tools to support detection and tracking of neurological diseases. As the prevalence of age-related diseases rises, their burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and society increases. This is exacerbated by the lack of neurologists and other clinicians who specialize in these complex conditions. In parallel, there has been recent universal recognition of the potential for digital technologies to support clinical decision-making by automating disease assessment and monitoring, while remaining highly accurate, objective, and reliable.\n\nThe key diagnostic assessment across all neurological diseases is the neurologic examination, which consists of motor and sensory evaluations of body structures and functions. While digitization of gait, balance, posture, hand and arm functions has progressed rapidly, assessment of small face/ mouth structures remains limited. Recent work has demonstrated the promise of video-based face tracking methods in the context of cranial nerve exam (CNE), but video-based technologies for tongue tracking remain limited. However, tongue evaluation is essential for differential diagnosis in stroke, tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases. The location of the tongue inside of the mouth and consequent lack of data have precluded the development of algorithms to detect neuromuscular changes to the tongue across diverse populations.\n\nThis innovative, interdisciplinary application aims to develop a tongue function assessment in the context of the CNE in patients with various neuromuscular diagnoses. First, we will develop novel machine learning methods for tongue tracking, using a unique data set collected as part of a large study on the development of a digital CNE. Second, these novel algorithms will be analytically validated in neurotypical adults via the gold standard electromagnetic articulography, and will comprise a diverse sample with respect to age, sex/gender, racial, and anatomic factors. Third, we will clinically validate our method in patients with neuromuscular disorders or stroke, via comparison to CNE by an expert neurologist. Finally, we will develop a digital tool based on these algorithms that will be widely disseminated for clinical and research purposes. The project will result in significant and exciting innovation in the development of a digital CNE that incorporates tongue tracking, which will support automatic and remote digital neurological assessment.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nGhebremusse, Sara\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nWestern University\n\nApplication Title:\n\n(re)Imagining an Indigenous-led Sustainable Mineral Resource Sector in Canada\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nKunz, Nadja\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nBeckie, Roger; Antweiler, Werner; Liao, Carol; Piercey, Stephen; Warnock, Jeffrey\n\nResearch summary\n\nDemand for minerals such as copper, nickel and lithium used for electrification and batteries will rapidly increase as Canada and the world transition to a net-zero carbon energy system. Yet, current supplies of these minerals are insufficient to meet the 2016 Paris Climate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Moreover, many current mineral extraction methods have serious negative environmental and social effects, particularly on Indigenous lands, leading to conflict over the unequal distribution of costs and benefits. Responsible sourcing and use of minerals is critical to build both a sustainable society and advance Indigenous mineral governance.\n\nObjectives: Working in collaboration with Indigenous leaders, our diverse team will lay the foundation for transforming Canada’s mineral resource sector. We will identify critical challenges and develop a framework for solutions needed to advance Indigenous governance of mineral resource development on their lands. Our objectives are to:\n\nexplore and create new regulatory and economic structures that support community-led mineral exploration projects by incorporating Indigenous knowledge and accounting for Canada’s commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;\n\ngenerate priorities for innovative technological approaches, from initial mineral exploration to mineral recycling, to prevent negative legacies of the expanding sector on Indigenous lands; and\n\ndevelop frameworks for building resilience in Indigenous communities to anticipated climate changes that could amplify the negative legacies of mineral resource extraction.\n\nResearch approach: Drawing on expertise and methodologies in earth sciences, engineering, law, economics, and public policy, we will collectively reimagine the technical, social, environmental, and human rights dimensions of mining in the context of resurgent Indigenous sovereignty. Interdisciplinary collaboration between these fields will enable us to promote innovation and societal change.\n\nNovelty and significance: Mining in Canada continues to be shaped by a colonial, capitalist model that has historically overlooked Indigenous rights and contributed to major environmental disasters. We will challenge this paradigm and set a new standard for Indigenous-led mineral resource stewardship, integrating diverse disciplinary approaches and perspectives to foster a reimagined future for a responsible mineral resource sector in Canada.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nHubbard, Basil\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nApplication Title:\n\nTowards non-DNA based life: design and evolution of cells subsisting on chemically-altered ribose sugars\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nJabbari, Hosna\n\nResearch summary\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe central dogma asserts that DNA is the only hereditary material. However, whether this is true, and whether non-DNA based life may have existed, or could be engineered, are enduring questions. Discoveries in the field of exobiology suggest that primordial biomolecules, including sugars and bases with unique isotopic signatures, are delivered to Earth on a regular basis via meteorites. Moreover, over the past few decades, chemists have synthesized myriad chemically-modified nucleic acids, also known as xenonucleic acids (XNAs), capable of storing, replicating, and evolving genetic information. These developments, coupled with advances in gene editing, now provide a ripe environment to interrogate the possibility of XNA-based life.\n\nMy lab engineered an E.coli strain that is auxotrophic for D-ribose (requires exogenous supplementation). Using this, we have evolved bacteria that subsist solely on heavy ribose sugar derivatives. This uniform replacement of ribose with isotopologues is unprecedented, and highlights the remarkable adaptability of life. In this proposal, we will employ the same top-down experimental framework to test if prokaryotes can be evolved to utilize ribose derivatives bearing a single atomic substitution.\n\nObjectives & Approach:\n\nIdentify types and positions of ribose modifications predicted to be minimally disruptive on\n\noverall nucleic acid structure (non-local), and\n\nnucleic-acid-protein interactions (local) using computational modelling techniques.\n\nSynthesize candidate xenoriboses using organic chemistry, leveraging team expertise.\n\nPerform adaptive laboratory evolution of ribose auxotroph bacteria towards survival on xenoriboses via serial dilution and chemostat methods, testing chemical and genetically-encoded mutagenesis methods. Characterize results using a variety of mass spectrometry methods (e.g. ToF, ICP, NanoSIMS), and RNA-seq.\n\nNovelty & Significance:\n\nThis work will contribute to answering one of the three cardinal problems of biology. It has implications for those studying the origin of life here on Earth, and for those looking for it elsewhere. Moreover, XNA-based organisms could be applied as genetic ‘firewalls’ to study pathogens in a lab without risk, and could drive unprecedented medical breakthroughs (e.g. microbiome engineering, synthesis of medically useful XNAs for RNA therapeutics and vaccines).\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nBrinkmann, Markus\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\n\nApplication Title:\n\nRevolutionizing the Tracking of Microplastics: Novel DNA-Labelled Plastics for Environmental and Toxicological Studies\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nRochman, Chelsea\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nOswald, Claire; McPhedran, Kerry\n\nResearch summary\n\nMicroplastics, particles smaller than 5 mm in size, are a global environmental concern due to their widespread presence and potential risks to ecosystems and human health. Current microplastic research is hindered by methodological limitations in tracking how microplastics travel through exposed systems. To address these gaps, our interdisciplinary project will merge molecular biology and toxicology with materials design to develop a novel method for DNA-labelling plastics, revolutionizing microplastic research in two key applications: tracking microplastic transport and fate in the physical environment (environmental science) and in biological pathways (toxicokinetics).\n\nOur project has three objectives:\n\nObjective 1 – DNA-Labelling of Microplastics: We will create a technique to embed DNA barcodes within biodegradable polymers, enabling unique tagging of microplastics with genetic information. This creates \"genetically barcoded\" microplastics that can be tagged with crucial encoded information (e.g., time and location of release), allowing precise tracking and identification and improving current limits of detection by orders of magnitude.\n\nObjective 2 – Environmental Fate and Transport Studies: In landscape-level studies, we will release genetically barcoded microplastics into urban water systems and their transport and fate (e.g., sedimentation) will be tracked over time using DNA sequencing technology. This will enhance our understanding of the temporal dynamics of microplastic interactions with the environment and will inform mitigation strategies.\n\nObjective 3 – Toxicokinetics in Fish: Genetically barcoded microplastics will be used to investigate the movement of microplastics through fish. Fish will be exposed to marked microplastics through their diet, and DNA markers in their tissues will precisely determine uptake, transport, and fate, informing potential effects on fish health. This research has direct implications for assessing the risks of microplastic contamination in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nAs a result of the inherently novel nature of creating and studying DNA-barcoded plastics, this project carries risks. However, the potential rewards are substantial, offering a transformative understanding of microplastic impacts on the environment, organisms, and human health. Success will position our team at the forefront of microplastic research, paving the way for innovative solutions to address this pressing environmental challenge.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nGosselin, Frédérick\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nÉcole Polytechnique de Montréal\n\nApplication Title:\n\nSoft coral flexibility: its impact on hydrodynamic loads, feeding and a way to measure flow velocity\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nViggiano, Bianca\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\netienne, stephane; Cameron, Christopher\n\nResearch summary\n\nSoft corals exhibit dynamic movements in response to ocean waves and eddies. Notably, they experience vortex-induced vibrations as they interact with vortices shed in their wake. Unraveling this complex fluid-structure interaction is essential for quantifying the hydrodynamic stresses they endure, as well as for understanding their filter feeding mechanics. In an era of increasing hurricane frequency and coral reef upheavals due to climate changes, soft corals exhibit relative success at adapting to changing environments. We seek to understand the role of their flexibility or “softness” in this success.\n\nThis interdisciplinary endeavour involves collaboration among mechanical engineers, biologists, and ecologists, with three objectives:\n\nCharacterize flexibility effects on hydrodynamic loading and feeding efficiency in soft corals;\n\nExplore the behaviour of polyps in whole-colony motions and fluid-structure interactions;\n\nDevelop an innovative image-based flow velocity measurement technique using coral motion.\n\nOur methodology combines numerical modeling, flume experiments, and in situ observations. We use finite-element coupled with wake-oscillator models to simulate whole coral colony dynamics. This approach allows us to rapidly identify the effects of geometry, allometry, and flexibility. In flume experiments, we measure the vibration dynamics of freshly collected coral samples, with specific attention to polyp distribution and its correlation with particle capture efficiency. Concurrently, we're pioneering an image-based velocimetry technique. Because a coral colony's frequency response is closely linked to local flow velocity, we build a dataset comprising underwater videos capturing soft corals in diverse flow conditions, alongside acoustic Doppler velocimetry for precise flow measurements. Machine learning algorithms establish a robust correlation between flow velocity and coral motion, offering a transformative tool for coral research.\n\nThis research will provide novel insights into the mechanical and hydrodynamic aspects of soft corals, shedding light on their ecological roles within reef ecosystems. Moreover, it will help us predict how changing climate conditions, currents, and storms impact soft corals. Additionally, our innovative flow velocity measurement method will increase accessibility to coral reef monitoring, facilitating data-intensive assessments of coral reefs worldwide.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nNolan, Brodie\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUnity Health Toronto\n\nApplication Title:\n\nUsing machine learning to augment trauma resuscitation\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nSholzberg, Michelle\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nMamdani, Muhammad; BECKETT, ANDREW\n\nResearch summary\n\nSevere traumatic injuries affect Canadians of all ages and backgrounds. Hemorrhagic shock remains a leading cause of preventable death for injured patients. Delays to timely resuscitative maneuvers, blood transfusions, and coagulopathy reversal cause increased mortality. Proper care is complex and time-pressured, requiring the trauma team to diagnose and treat injuries simultaneously. This makes trauma care prone to error.\n\nSome die because it takes too long to receive the right blood for transfusion, or because we don’t know which specialized blood products to provide to help stop bleeding. There are blood tests available to help decide how to best to transfuse individual patients, such as viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHA), but currently they are too difficult to interpret while resuscitating a person who is bleeding out. Ultimately, the cognitive challenges with interpreting VHA and all other relevant critical data in real-time in the trauma bay results is overwhelming. This causes information to be lost and life-saving treatments to be delayed. Machine learning (ML) offers an exciting possibility to analyze multiple sources of data, interpret it, and provide actionable recommendations to the trauma team in real-time.\n\nAim: To develop and validate an ML program that will analyze patient physiologic data (i.e. vital signs) and electronic medical record (EMR) data (i.e. laboratory values, triage notes) in real-time to provide actionable prompts to the trauma team.\n\nThis will be accomplished through the following 3 objectives:\n\nObjective 1: Create a heuristic ML model that interprets VHA values and proposes a personalized transfusion strategy.\n\nObjective 2: Add in real-time EMR analysis to the above model (i.e. critical lab values and documentation in EMR) to predict need for transfusion and medical therapies.\n\nObjective 3: Implement and prospectively validate the ML model in real-time in the trauma bay.\n\nThis innovation will leverage artificial intelligence to analyze a patient’s vital signs and blood tests to provide actional recommendations to the trauma team in real-time. It will offload the trauma team’s need to monitor and interpret complicated graphs, allowing for faster time to critical interventions. We expect this to reduce time to transfusion, improve best practices, and ultimately save lives.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nBaada, Jemima Nomunume\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nThe University of British Columbia\n\nApplication Title:\n\nUsing gender transformative agroecology for climate change adaptation among smallholders in Ghana and Rwanda\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nDusenge, Mirindi Eric\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nLuginaah, Isaac; kpienbaareh, Daniel; Nsabimana, Donat; Soliku, Ophelia\n\nResearch summary\n\nSmallholder farmers, many of whom are women, contribute about a third of global food supply. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), over sixty percent of the population are smallholder farmers. Climate change risks are highest in SSA, and smallholders are the most threatened because their farming is rainfed. Women in SSA are particularly affected due to sociocultural factors that affect their access to agricultural resources. In Rwanda and Ghana, climate change is causing hunger in farming households due to intense droughts and heatwaves, which are projected to rise in the next few decades. These climate threats are exacerbated by limited adaptive strategies. This proposed interdisciplinary comparative project aims to develop a sustainable gender transformative climate change adaptation framework for improving food security in climate-affected smallholder farming systems in Rwanda and Ghana. The specific objectives of the project are:\n\nTo assess gendered differences in farmers’ Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and integrate them into local farming methods through participatory training on agroecology and gender transformative/equitable strategies.\n\nTo evaluate the impacts of various agroecological practices on crop yield and health.\n\nTo examine the effects of diverse agroecological farming practices on the resilience of crops to dry spells and heatwaves.\n\nThis project will use theoretical concepts from feminist political ecology to achieve research goals. We will use participatory research that engages women and men farmers in knowledge co-production and mobilization. We will also use a gender transformative approach rooted in sustainable, climate-adaptive smallholder farming. Our interdisciplinary research team is well positioned to achieve the project's objectives within a two-year timeframe as it has expertise in gender/feminist-based analyses, social theory, and quantitative and qualitative methods. Our findings will be shared with academic, policy and practitioner communities through journal articles, conference papers, workshops and outreach programs in Rwanda and Ghana.\n\nOverall, this interdisciplinary project will introduce smallholder farmers from four sample districts in two SSA countries, Rwanda and Ghana, to farming practices that can help them adapt to a changing climate in gender equitable ways. The project findings will also provide insights on agroecological practices that enable crops to deal with heatwaves versus dry spells.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nSavoji, Houman\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversité de Montréal\n\nApplication Title:\n\nBiomimetic 3D (bio)printed pulmonary heart valves for pediatric patients\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nHooshiar, Amir; Andelfinger, Gregor; Kadem, Lyes\n\nResearch summary\n\nPROBLEM AND BACKGROUND:\n\nCongenital heart valve defects are detected in nearly 40,000 infants born in the United States and 1 in 80-100 Canadian newborns (according to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada) each year. The prevalence of pulmonic valvular stenosis and atresia account for 7-10% and 1% of all congenital heart diseases (CHD), respectively. The heart valve defect can range in severity, with about 25% of cases requiring immediate open-heart surgery to replace the valve or other heart defects. No surgical heart valve prosthesis meets infants' size, flow, and developmental needs. Options include mechanical, bioprosthetic, homograft, or autograft (Ross procedure) valves. However, the most commonly used valves, mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, are designed with adults in mind. Thus, surgeons must alter the structure of the valve in the operating room, effectively altering the hemodynamic profile and minimizing the flow potential. In addition, mechanical and bioprosthetic valves are stagnant, meaning that children often face patient-prosthesis mismatch and multiple operations as a result of their growth. In addition to lack of growth, mechanical valves require life-long anticoagulation medication, and bioprosthetic valves tend to undergo structural valve degeneration.\n\nHYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES:\n\nIn response to these challenges, we envision fabricating innovative pediatric pulmonary heart valves with remodeling capability. Such valves will combine state-of-the-art innovations in 3D (bio)printing, functional biomaterials, cardiology, and fluid dynamics. Our team hypothesizes that a 3D (bio)printed heart valve that can be remodeled with optimized biomechanical and hydrodynamic properties will represent a paradigm shift in innovative medical devices for pediatric patients with CHD. We propose three independent specific aims (SAs) to validate our hypothesis: SA1. In-depth in vitro assessment of biomechanical and hydrodynamic function of 3D (bio)printed heart valves; SA2. Maturation and characterization of living heart valves in a heart valve bioreactor; SA3. Combination of 3D (bio)printed heart valves with a minimally invasive transcatheter pulmonary implantation technique.\n\nIMPACT:\n\nThe outcomes of this project will have a significant clinical impact in advancing the traditional devices with above-mentioned challenges to fabricate off-the-shelf pediatric pulmonary heart valves that can facilitate translation from bench to bedside.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nAdamowicz, Sarah\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversity of Guelph\n\nApplication Title:\n\nKitikmeot Biting Insect Monitoring and Research Program\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nMcIlwraith, Thomas\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nBernhardt, Joanna\n\nResearch summary\n\nGlobal climate change is threatening the ability of natural systems to support and sustain human well-being. With warming, species are predicted to track their preferred climate by moving to higher latitudes, higher elevations, and deeper waters. Given the rapid pace of climate change in the Arctic, these ecosystems are predicted to be hotspots of biodiversity change.\n\nOne major challenge facing Arctic communities is lack of accessible, integrated data on the abundance and distribution of species that are important to wildlife and human health. The biting flies are of particular concern for monitoring due to their abundance, importance in ecosystems, and their roles as pests and disease vectors impacting humans and other animals. The potential impact of flies on caribou is concerning to community members of Kitikmeot, Nunavut, as caribou are important from cultural and food security perspectives. Swarms of black flies can negatively impact caribou, driving them to spend time in environments poorer in resources. Northward shifts in fly distributions may thus impact caribou birthing and hunting grounds, human health, and conservation plans.\n\nThere are critical needs for collaboration and to integrate knowledge about current and historical distributions of flies and other wildlife species. Respectful sharing and co-analysis of knowledge is essential for understanding temporal trends and inter-relationships of species and predicting the impacts of climate change on wildlife, ecosystem services, human health and nutrition, and cultural practices.\n\nThe objectives of this project are to co-design and co-implement a novel program for monitoring fly species composition and for alerting Arctic community groups when species are detected that are new to the region, potentially invasive, or of health concern to humans and wildlife. Our collaborative team will take an inter-disciplinary approach, integrating Inuit and Western Scientific Knowledges and applying community-engaged social science research methods, ecological statistical modeling, and bioinformatics. Respect, inclusivity, reciprocity, sustainability, and a focus on capacity building are among the values that guide this collaboration. We will co-create tools—including maps integrating multiple types of knowledge, predictive models, and a biodiversity dashboard—that will lead to new knowledge and contribute to community capacity for decision making, mitigation, and climate-change adaptation.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nWeiss, Lucien\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nÉcole Polytechnique de Montréal\n\nApplication Title:\n\nA multidimensional approach to study the biophysics of bioadhesin interaction with advanced nanomaterials\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nBrun, Yves\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nNanci, Antonio; Didar, Tohid\n\nResearch summary\n\nThis multidisciplinary project brings together advanced materials, microbiology, ecology, and optics to study bacterial colonization of antifouling surfaces. Our goal is to address the critical lack of robust measurements of the interactions between microbes and substrates at the nanoscale by building an assay for quantitative comparisons under well-defined conditions. We will design and test our approach using the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, a key culprit in aquatic biofouling.\n\nMicrobial biofouling has enormous ecological, environmental, economic, and health impacts for Canadians. Biofilms decrease the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapeutics, and biofouling of ship hulls is a major source of species contamination and decreased fuel efficiencies. Eradicating biofilms is difficult and expensive, and climate change is projected to accelerate biofilm formation further. Therefore, using antifouling materials to prevent biofilm formation as much as possible is the dominant strategy. Traditional antifouling coatings use slowly ablating materials and leaching biocides to prevent buildup; however, it has become clear that these approaches can cause significant damage to local ecosystems.\n\nSome bioinspired materials with nanoscale topologies have shown impressive antifouling properties and could be the solution. Still, we lack a standardization for making thorough head-to-head comparisons of bacterial colonization on such surfaces that are needed to build our understanding of bioadhesives and gain predictive power for designing new materials. Specifically, quantitative measurements are needed on the scale of cells and material features. To do so, we will deploy quantitative force spectroscopy methods, namely Atomic Force Microscopy and optical tweezers, to probe the variability of biological systems in a defined and multidimensional matrix of conditions (temperature, pH, organic load, etc.). We will use bacteria that evolved their adhesins to attach to different surfaces under different environmental conditions and establish a set of standardized conditions and quantitative metrics that we and others can deploy to test a variety of cell types, including pathogenic bacteria, nanomaterials, and conditions. These, in turn, will be used for the next phase of our research: rationally designing new materials that combat the dire problem of biofouling by merging the optimization process for obtaining desirable material properties with the characterization.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nAbdul Sater, Ali\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nYork University\n\nApplication Title:\n\nInvestigating the effects of emerging chemical mixtures associated with air pollution on immune-related diseases\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nSweeney, Gary\n\nResearch summary\n\nAir pollution represents one of the largest environmental risk factors to human health, with chronic exposure to high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) being associated with increased risk to immune-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and asthma. The incidence of these diseases in Canada is among the highest in the world, and Health Canada estimates that air pollution has severe health and economic consequences on Canada’s population and economy. This is despite Canada having some of the lowest levels of air pollution from traditional sources (e.g. PM2.5, VOC, NO, NO2) in the world. We hypothesize that mixtures of non-traditional pollutants, including from tire and brake-derived chemicals, pesticides, household, and cosmetic products, may be important contributors to the development of immune-mediated diseases. This proposal aims to identify if these emerging and non-traditional pollutants adversely affect asthma and RA and determine whether there are specific chemicals or their atmospheric breakdown products responsible for promoting them.\n\nDysregulated immune responses, which cause asthma and RA, are driven by a complex set of genetic and environmental factors, such as air pollutants. Our current understanding regarding the health effects of air pollutants stems from studies that investigate individual pollutants from traditional sources usually associated with combustion. However, humans are exposed to tens of thousands of airborne chemicals; yet, only a fraction of these chemicals has been identified. These non-traditional pollutants have unique atmospheric chemistries and their contribution to PM2.5 associated health effects remains unexplored. In collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada, the aforementioned chemicals will be used to generate PM2.5 under realistic ambient conditions using an oxidation flow reactor. We will then exploit our expertise in mouse models of asthma and RA to determine the effect of these pollutants on disease severity and progression. Specifically, we will use a Whole-Body Exposure Chamber to chronically expose mice to the generated particles. Disease progression and severity will be measured, and tissues will be harvested to assess inflammation and cellular infiltration.\n\nThis proposal may lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of how pollutants derived from atmospherically accurate mixtures of non-traditional pollutants promote the development of immune-mediated diseases.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nChaker-Margot, Malik\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversité de Montréal\n\nApplication Title:\n\nLong non-coding RNAs in growth factor signaling\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nSauvageau, Martin\n\nResearch summary\n\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of molecule that have emerged lately as important regulators of many cellular processes. Human cells express tens of thousands of lncRNAs and some have been shown to be essential in multiple pathways. While some mechanisms are better understood, many long non-coding RNAs seem to function via unknown processes to modulate the different pathways that they are embedded in. There is still a critical gap between the importance of this class of molecule for diverse cellular processes and the very limited structural and biochemical understanding available. Interestingly, a few lncRNAs have been shown to participate in non-genetic function by directly influencing cellular signaling near or at the plasma membrane, in a region of the cell thought to be governed exclusively by proteins, lipids and other small molecules. The participation of lncRNAs in cell signaling as a transducing factors or auxiliary regulatory molecule represents a significant paradigm shift on conceptualizing how signaling pathways are regulated. Investigations in this area are critical to better understand signaling pathways and to open new avenues to intervene pharmacologically to modulate signaling by targeting these lncRNAs.\n\nThe PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a growth factor signaling pathway which is central to regulating cellular growth proliferation and motility. Several lncRNAs have been proposed to regulate this signaling pathway either via altering the expression of its protein components, or by directly interacting with the molecular components, protein and lipids, which constitute the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Given the importance of this pathway in the functioning of healthy human cells, and its involvement in the development of cancer, there is a clear need to better understand how lncRNAs are able to modulate this essential cellular process. We aim to clarify the mechanisms by which lncRNAs are capable of influencing PI3K/Akt signaling through RNA-protein and RNA-lipid interactions combining screening approaches, such as OMAP and CLIP, with in vitro biochemistry. This approach will be conducted in several cancer cell models to obtain an overview of cancer-specific roles of certain lncRNAs. In the long term, we believe that from these insights will emerge:\n\na better understanding of the mechanisms of signaling in cancer\n\nnew targets for cancer therapies\n\nnew templates for RNA-based technologies to modulate cell behavior.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nChamsine, Chirine\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversité du Québec à Montréal\n\nApplication Title:\n\nMINOR-IA : Vers un système avancé d’évaluation de la santé mentale à travers les langues minoritaires\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Principal Investigator:\n\nGuidere, Mathieu\n\nResearch summary\n\nObjectifs du projet de recherche :\n\nAmbition stratégique : Le projet ambitionne de créer un outil d'évaluation numérique et assisté par l'IA, capable de repérer les difficultés de santé mentale directement dans la langue du locuteur minoritaire et sans passer par la traduction, l'interprétation ou la médiation.\n\nObjectifs clés:\n\nDéveloppement technologique : Élaborer un outil non invasif spécifiquement conçu pour les langues minoritaires, pour permettre une évaluation psychologique précise et accessible aux communautés minoritaires.\n\nSynergie interdisciplinaire : Faire converger les expertises de plusieurs domaines (médecine, informatique et linguistique), afin de créer une solution à l’intersection des sciences humaines et des sciences médicales.\n\nDémarche de recherche : En s’appuyant sur une convergence d’expertises, cette recherche adoptera une approche interdisciplinaire pour la conception d’un outil innovant par rapport aux pratiques existantes.\n\nPhases de recherche :\n\nCollecte de données : Acquisition de données orales dans les communautés minoritaires ciblées pour construire un corpus robuste pour l’apprentissage supervisé de l’IA.\n\nDéveloppement d’algorithmes : Création d’algorithmes innovants pour l’analyse des marqueurs cognitivo-discursifs de la santé mentale, capables de détecter les signes de détresse ou de troubles directement dans la langue minoritaire.\n\nIntégration et test : Assemblage des algorithmes au sein d’une plateforme intuitive destinée aux professionnel.les de la santé mentale, et vérification de l’efficacité de l’outil dans divers scénarios appliqués.\n\nNouveauté et importance attendue des travaux:\n\nLe projet se distingue par son positionnement à l’intersection des technologies langagières et des pratiques cliniques, offrant une solution de rupture par rapport aux pratiques existantes dans l’évaluation de la santé mentale des communautés linguistiques minoritaires.\n\nRupture méthodologique : L’initiative propose une rupture avec les méthodes conventionnelles en misant sur l’extraction de marqueurs psychologiques à partir de la parole ordinaire, plutôt que de se limiter aux tests standardisés et souvent contraints par les obstacles linguistiques.\n\nImpact potentiel : Ce projet pourrait révolutionner les méthodologies diagnostiques, affiner la détection précoce dans le contexte éducatif et améliorer significativement les processus d’évaluation dans le secteur des ressources humaines, entre autres applications diverses.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nBordeleau, François\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nUniversité Laval\n\nApplication Title:\n\nCreating a biomimetic 3D engineered model of the liver metastatic niche\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nTurcotte, Simon; Landreville, Solange\n\nResearch summary\n\nDespite all the advances in therapeutics, a significant number of cancers will still progress toward a metastatic disease. Once metastatic, cancer is incurable, and treatments are mostly palliative. The liver is one of the most common cancer metastasis sites, accounting for nearly 25% of all cases. In fact, several cancers exhibit liver-specific tropism, most notably uveal melanoma (UM) and colorectal cancer (CRC). A major issue though is the complete lack of reliable models that can either recreate a metastatic niche or distinguish between events in the primary tumor and metastatic site.\n\nTumor cells have several mechanisms that allow them to communicate with distant cells in the premetastatic niche. For instance, this communication allows tumor cells to reprogram hepatic stromal cells, such as hepatic stellate cells (HSteCs), which in turn impact the extracellular matrix composition, mechanical properties and architecture. The establishment of this premetastatic niche could depend on the origin of the primary tumor. Moreover, these modifications of the metastatic niche can facilitate the last steps of the metastatic cascade, namely the extravasation and metastatic colonization.\n\nAdvances in tissue engineering and biomaterial properties have allowed the development of tissue equivalent constructs for regenerative medicine applications. These approaches, when guided by knowledge derived by oncology and cell biology, can potentially be leveraged to create an engineered hepatic metastatic niche model. Using the self-assembly approach of tissue engineering and hepatic stellate cells, we will create a liver equivalent stroma. Our objectives are:\n\nDetermine the contribution of tumor cells from different origins on the formation of a premetastatic niche, and\n\nEstablish a vascularized metastatic niche to recreate the final steps of the metastatic cascade.\n\nOur research approach will combine expertise in tissue engineering, microfluidics, physics, oncology and molecular biology in order to address a critical need for a new generation of fully biomimetic metastatic models. Such models of the premetastatic niche will enable basic researchers to explore new molecular mechanisms involved in metastasis and identify potential therapeutic targets as well as for preclinical translational research in a way that was previously inconceivable.\n\nNominated Principal Investigator:\n\nKing, Irah\n\nNominated Principal Investigator Affiliation:\n\nThe Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre\n\nApplication Title:\n\nIntegrating parasitology and bioengineering to improve gut health\n\nAmount Awarded:\n\n$250,000\n\nCo-Applicant:\n\nMaurice, Corinne; Ahmadi, Ali\n\nResearch summary\n\nIntestinal helminths remain one of the most prevalent causes of infectious disease in the world.
