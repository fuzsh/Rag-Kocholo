        "text": "THE BUZZ: POWER PLAYS — Democrats are all-but guaranteed to keep their supermajority in Sacramento next year.\n\nThe question is exactly how big that supermajority will be.\n\nLeaders in the Assembly and Senate are prepared to go to battle this year to protect a handful of vulnerable Democrats and vacant seats that could flip to Republicans. The GOP, for its part, is fending off a few potential flips of its own while trying to chip away at Democrats’ overwhelming power in California.\n\nComplicating the equation for Democrats is that their leadership is brand new to the game of protecting incumbents. This year will be the first test for Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President pro Tem Mike McGuire. We’re also keeping an eye on what could be some interesting races to fill vacancies left by outgoing Democratic Assemblymember Brian Maienschein and Republican state Sen. Scott Wilk.\n\nExpect campaigning to pick up when session ends in August, but there’s already money pouring in for the top targets. The latest figures, reported this week, reflect cash raised as of June 30, and offer a better picture of the fights to come as we head into the thick of election year.\n\nVULNERABLE DEMOCRATS:\n\n— Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, Santa Clarita Democrat: This is the marquee race for Democrats this year. Schiavo won her seat in 2022 by just 522 votes after Democrats spent some serious cash to box out Republican incumbent Suzette Martinez Valladares. She’s high on the GOP’s target list this year, and is running against Patrick Gipson, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy who came within 521 votes of Schiavo in the March primary.\n\nSchiavo reports raising about $653,600 since the start of the year, bringing her total cash on hand to just over $1 million. Gipson has raised just over $166,800 in the same time period, and has $127,000 cash on hand.\n\n— Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria, Fresno Democrat: Soria for months has been far outraising her Republican opponent, former state tax auditor Joanna Garcia Rose, but that doesn’t put her in the clear. The GOP pick managed to win about 1,000 more votes than the incumbent in the March primary despite having only a fraction of her financial backing.\n\nThe latest fundraising figures show that pattern continuing, with Soria raising more than $944,000 in the first half of the year, with about $1.5 million in cash, compared to Garcia Rose’s modest haul of just $92,000 from the same period and $65,000 in cash.\n\n— State Sen. Josh Newman, Fullerton Democrat: After a bit of a candidate shuffle brought on by redistricting and the departure of state Sen. Dave Min, and a crowded primary race that saw a slew of outside spending, Newman is heading into a competitive general election matchup with former Republican state legislator Steven Choi, who lost his Assembly seat to Cottie Petrie-Norris in 2022.\n\nNewman has so far raised more than $1.3 million this year, ending June with about $448,000 in cash compared to Choi, who reported $55,769 on hand.\n\nVULNERABLE REPUBLICANS:\n\n— Assemblymember Laurie Davies, Oceanside Republican: Democrats have a slight edge in voter registration in this district thanks to a large swath of San Diego County residents that are trending blue, and it’s one of their top targets to flip this year. Former San Clemente Mayor Chris Duncan lost to Davies by about 5 points last cycle, and is looking for a rematch this year.\n\nDavies has raised over $362,000 since the start of the year, with many of her fellow Assembly Republicans maxing out to her campaign. She ended June with $714,608 in cash. Duncan is not far behind, due in no small part to the outpouring of support from the Assembly’s Democratic supermajority. He raised $821,453 in the first six months and ended with about $593,000 in cash.\n\n— Assemblymember Greg Wallis, Rancho Mirage Republican: Democrat Christy Holstege is back this year after losing to Wallis by a mere 85 votes in 2022.\n\nThe California Democratic Party has sent more than $272,000 to the Holstege campaign since December, state records show. As of June she had raised $733,571 since the start of the year and had $664,706 in cash. Wallis raised about $524,385 in the same time period thanks to help from fellow Republicans and about $6,000 from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, normally a Democratic mega donor who’s also a staunch charter schools advocate.\n\n— Assemblymember Josh Hoover, Folsom Republican: Democrats dropped some serious cash trying to protect Ken Cooley in 2022, only for Hoover to nab the seat by less than 1 percentage point. This cycle, the Republican is facing a challenge from Citrus Heights Councilmember Porsche Middleton.\n\nMiddleton raised $278,249 with $177,950 cash on hand. Hoover goes into the general election with a comparatively heftier warchest of $653,135 having raised more than $433,000.\n\n— State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, Yucaipa Republican: Ochoa Bogh is facing a challenge from Palm Springs City Councilmember Lisa Middleton this year in her competitive, Republican-leaning district.\n\nThe incumbent ended June with $803,381 in cash after raising about $483,000 in the first half of the year. Middleton has about $226,000 on hand heading into November.\n\nGOOD MORNING. Happy Friday.

Eleni Kounalakis is in charge until he returns this weekend.\n\nSILICON VALLEYLAND\n\nTRUST ISSUES — Feds have put one of California’s premier tech companies under scrutiny, POLITICO’s Josh Sisco scooped on Thursday.\n\nJustice Department lawyers are investigating Nvidia’s acquisition of the relatively obscure Israeli AI start-up Run:ai on antitrust grounds, according to five people with direct knowledge of the matter, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential investigation. The companies announced the deal in late April without disclosing a price, though TechCrunch reported $700 million.\n\nAs Josh explains, Run:ai enables so-called virtualization of graphics processing units, or GPUs, the reason behind Nvidia’s nearly $3 trillion market value. Run:ai’s technology essentially allows its customers to do more with fewer chips, a highly valuable service as demand for the chips far outpacing supply.\n\nNvidia’s profits have exploded over the last few years as its chips, traditionally used for computer graphics, have been adapted for the heavy computational workloads of AI. The company is estimated to have as much as 90 percent of the market for high-end AI chips, which are often difficult to obtain, and the DOJ had already been looking into Nvidia’s business practices, as POLITICO reported in June.\n\nBoth of the DOJ investigations into Nvidia are generally focused on the potential for the company to build a moat around its GPUs, the five people with knowledge of the matter said. Justice Department investigators have been asking questions about Nvidia’s sales practices including whether it conditions access to its chips on purchases of other products or commitments to not buy from competitors, some of the people said.\n\nCAMPAIGN YEAR\n\nANTONIO OUT — Antonio Villaraigosa, a 2026 candidate for governor, confirmed Thursday that he left his position as a partner at the political affairs firm Actum. An adviser for Villaraigosa told Playbook that the former Los Angeles mayor left the company before the July 23 launch of his gubernatorial run. Villaraigosa’s profile page had been wiped from Actum’s website in recent days.\n\nOther heavy hitters at Actum, which has offices in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Washington and London, include former President Donald Trump’s chief of staff and cabinet member Mick Mulvaney, former Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and former California Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez. Villaraigosa’s campaign also confirmed to Playbook that he will remain on the advisory board of crypto currency giant Coinbase. Villaraigosa announced that he’d raised more than $1.5 million in the first week of his campaign.\n\nCLIMATE AND ENERGY\n\nON FIRE — Gov. Gavin Newsom is making the best of his role as wildfire governor and showing off the billions he’s spent on Cal Fire. Both Republicans and Democrats have thoughts. Read more in yesterday’s California Climate.\n\nTop Talkers\n\nTHAT WASN’T THE PLAN — Trump’s campaign had a plan to hit Vice President Kamala Harris on her record as a “liberal prosecutor” and perceived weaknesses on immigration — that was, until Trump questioned Harris’ Black identity and made other controversial statements this week at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. His remarks overshadowed other lines of attack against Harris, leaving the Trump campaign grasping for a new narrative, POLITICO’s Natalie Allison and Alex Isenstadt report.\n\nKYRA WORTHY CASE — Investigators in court documents this week said San Francisco public safety nonprofit SF SAFE ignored red flags years before the arrest of former executive Kyra Worthy, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Worthy was taken into custody Tuesday and charged with 34 felonies related to wage theft, embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds related to alleged misspending of public funds.\n\nAROUND THE STATE\n\n— San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Thursday directed city employees to offer homeless people bus tickets out of town before offering them shelter or other housing options. (San Francisco Chronicle)\n\n— A California family that lost their home in the 2019 Paradise fire has lost a second home to the ongoing Park fire. (Los Angeles Times)\n\n— Sacramento city officials have been quietly preparing to increase homeless sweeps and citations for public camping with shorter notice times.
