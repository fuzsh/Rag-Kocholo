        "text": "Year Date Event Ref. 1701 4 August The Great Peace of Montreal, between New France and 39 First Nations, is finalized. [21] 1710 In the Siege of Port Royal, the capital of Acadia falls to the British, defeating the French garrison and their Wabanaki Confederacy Indigenous allies. This begins an expansion into present-day Nova Scotia by the British. [22] 1713 11 April The War of the Spanish Succession is ended by the Treaty of Utrecht. France cedes the territory of Acadia to Great Britain and renounces claims to some British territories in Canada, as well as its claim to a monopoly of trade with the Indigenous population, but retains control of Île Royale colony (present-day Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island). [23] 1717 The Indigenous settlement of Kanesatake is founded at the confluence of the St.Lawrence and Ottawa rivers. It is founded by the Sulpician Order under a royal charter as a home for Catholic converts of the Indigenous peoples of the region, including the Mohawk. The lands' ownership becomes disputed between the Order and the Indigenous residents over the original land grant and title. The settlement would later be the location of the Oka Crisis. The land remains disputed. [24] 1749 21 June Halifax is founded and settled by the British, marking the first time that public rather than private capital was used to settle a British colony in the Americas. The Indigenous Mi'kmaq consider Britain's unilateral action as a violation of treaties signed after Father Rale's War in 1726, starting Father Le Loutre's War. British colonists would drive French and Mi'kmaq inhabitants from peninsular Nova Scotia but are repelled from Acadian settlements further north (present-day New Brunswick). [25][26][20] 1755 11 August British Brigadier-General Charles Lawrence orders the Expulsion of the Acadians. Over the next decade an estimated 11,400 French Catholics are deported to the Thirteen Colonies and Europe. Many settle in Louisiana. [27] 1758 8 June – 26 July The French naval fortress at Louisbourg is sieged for a second time by the British, having been returned to the French after a previous occupation in 1745. After being used to stage attacks on French Canada the following year, British soldiers reduce the fortress to rubble to prevent its return to the French a second time. [28][29] 1759 13 September A three-month British siege of Quebec City culminates in the pivotal Battle of the Plains of Abraham just outside the city's walls. Both the British and French commanders are killed in the battle. Following a decisive British victory, the French evacuate the city. [30] 1760-1761 10 March 1760 – 12 October 1761 The Halifax Treaties are signed between the Wabanaki Confederacy and the British Crown to end warring between the Indigenous peoples of the Maritimes and the British. One by one, various First Nations signed treaties to pledge \"peace and friendship\" with the British. The issue of aboriginal title is not covered in the treaties. [31] 1763 10 February The Seven Years' War is ended by the Treaty of Paris. France cedes New France to Great Britain, its colony Canada becoming the British Province of Quebec, and its remaining maritime colonies annexed by Nova Scotia. [32] 7 October The Royal Proclamation of 1763 is issued by King George III, forbidding settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, which was delineated as an Indian Reserve. The document is the first to recognize aboriginal title, a right included in the Canadian Constitution. Its banning of settlements west of the 13 British Colonies would eventually become one of the factors inciting the American Revolution. [33] 1764 1 August The Treaty of Fort Niagara is agreed to by the British Crown and 24 First Nations. It is the first treaty after the 1763 Proclamation, recognizing aboriginal title, and Indigenous recognition of the Proclamation. A strip of land along the Niagara River is transferred to Britain by the Seneca to provide a portage around Niagara Falls. The treaty created a new Covenant Chain, or friendship treaty, between Britain and the First Nations of the western Great Lakes. It is recorded in wampum. To the Indigenous peoples, it is a symbol of friendship and the recognition of sovereignty to their First Nations. [34][35] 1769 14 July St. John's Island is partitioned from Nova Scotia, becoming a separate colony from the mainland. The colony is renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798. [36] 1774 Quebec Act of 1774 is passed by the Parliament of Great Britain outlining how the Province of Quebec would be governed as colony, in an attempt to address damage to the economy/society of Quebec. Old boundaries were restored, free practice of Catholicism was guaranteed, and property and civil laws were to be decided according to traditional Canadian laws (thus preserving the Seigneurial system of New France for land ownership), with other matters of law left to English Common Law. The province was left to be governed by a legislative council, with no provision for an elected assembly. [20] 1775 The Invasion of Quebec and the Battle of Quebec take place, during the American Revolutionary War against Great Britain. These became a failed attempt at seizing military control of the British Province of Quebec and convince the French-speaking Canadiens to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies. [20] 1782-1783 A preliminary peace treaty between Great Britain and the United States of America is signed. Citing one of the clauses, General George Washington insisted on the return of any present or former slaves. As part of documenting and evacuation of former slaves to British North America, the Book of Negroes was compiled in New York City. Enslaved Africans in America who escaped to the British during the American Revolutionary War became the first settlement of Black Nova Scotians and Black Canadians. [20] 1783 3 September The Treaty of Paris (1783) was signed by representatives of King George III of Great Britain and representatives of the United States of America on 3 September 1783, officially ending the American Revolutionary War. The treaty set the boundaries between the British Empire in North America and the United States of America. Details included fishing rights and restoration of property and prisoners of war. [37] 1784 22 May Over 3,000,000 acres (1,200,000 ha) of land is purchased by the British Crown from the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation in present-day Ontario for £1180.00 [38] 18 June New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island are partitioned from Nova Scotia, becoming separate colonies. Cape Breton re-joins Nova Scotia in 1820. [39] 25 October Under the terms of the Haldimand Proclamation, 550,000 acres (220,000 ha) of the lands purchased from the Mississaugas is granted to the Mohawks and the other Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The land is a tract extending 6 miles (9.7 km) on either side of the Grand River from source to mouth. However, it is later determined that the head of the Grand River was outside of the lands purchased from the Mississaugas. In 1792, Governor Simcoe unilaterally reduces the land grant to 270,000 acres (110,000 ha). Later land sales, government actions, and the creation of the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve would reduce the lands under Indigenous possession to a small fraction of the original grant. The land grant and its management is the basis of the Grand River land dispute between the Six Nations and Canada. 1791 The Constitutional Act of 1791 divides the Province of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada (modern-day Ontario and Quebec). [40] Year Date Event Ref. 1805 The treaty of the Toronto Purchase is made for the lands of present-day Toronto north to Lake Simcoe between the Crown and the Mississauga. It was found that the original 1787 agreement only provided a land deed and no description of the lands involved. The treaty would be disputed and settled in 2010. 1811 Settlement began of the Red River Colony, a 300,000 square kilometres (120,000 sq mi; five times that of Scotland) area, by Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk via a land grant from the Hudson's Bay Company, of which he was a part-owner. The territory later became part of Manitoba and the Missouri Territory. [20] 1813 21–22 June During the War of 1812, Laura Secord learns of an American plan to launch a surprise attack on British forces and walks 20 miles to warn the defenders. The British defeat the American invaders at the Battle of Beaver Dams on 24 June. [41] 1818 20 October The London Convention is signed, setting the boundary between the United States and British North America to the 49th parallel from the Northwest Angle in Minnesota west to the continental divide of the Rocky Mountains, and establishing joint control of the Oregon Country. [42] 1821 Merger of Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company ending the Pemmican War, a series of armed skirmishes between the rival fur trading companies. As part of the merger, the monopoly of HBC is extended north to the Arctic Ocean and west to the Pacific Ocean. [43]: 369–370 1829 6 June Shanawdithit, the last known full-blooded member of the Beothuk people native to Newfoundland, dies; she was about 29 years old. [44] 1837 Rebellions of 1837–1838 break out in both Upper and Lower Canada, inspired by republican ideals, against the dominated by a small group of businessmen represented by Château Clique and Family Compact [45][46][47] 1841 10 February Under the terms of the Act of Union 1840, the British colonies of Lower Canada and Upper Canada are merged into the single Province of Canada. [48] 1846 15 June The Oregon boundary dispute is settled with the signing of the Oregon Treaty, extending the boundary between British North America and the United States along the 49th parallel from the Rocky Mountains to the Juan de Fuca Strait, and defining the maritime boundary to the Pacific Ocean. [49] 1850 7 September 9 September The Robinson Treaties are signed between the Ojibwa and the British Crown, surrendering the northern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron for £2,160 and an annual payment of £600. [50][51] 1854 13 October The Surrender of the Saugeen Peninsula is signed between the Chippewa and the Crown, surrendering the lands of the Saugeen Peninsula (Bruce Peninsula) in Canada West in exchange for reserves and interest on the sale of the surrendered lands. 1862 18 March The first case of the 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic is reported in Victoria, British Columbia. It spreads widely amongst the Indigenous populations, killing an estimated 20,000 or 2/3 of the Indigenous population. [52] 1864 1 – 9 September The Charlottetown Conference, the first of several meetings to discuss a Maritime Union and Canadian Confederation, is held in Charlottetown. [53] 1867 1 July The British North America Act, 1867, divides the Province of Canada into Ontario and Quebec and joins them with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into the new confederated state of Canada. [54][55] 1869–1870 11 October – 12 May A group of Métis led by Louis Riel mount the Red River Rebellion against Canadian intrusion and in the Red River Colony. The Canadian government regains control after acceding to many of Riel's demands, but he flees into exile in the United States after the government refused to grant him amnesty. [56] 1870 15 July\n\nConcluding a series of agreements between Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Hudson's Bay Company, Canada acquires Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, forming the Northwest Territories. In the aftermath of the Red River Rebellion, Manitoba is subdivided from the new territory in the area around Winnipeg, becoming Canada's fifth province. Land rights are granted to the Métis.\n\n[57][58] 1871 20 July The colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island amalgamate and then enter Confederation as the Province of British Columbia, Canada's sixth province. Except for individual treaties for small portions of the territory, the agreement annexes a large area of land into Canada without treaties with the First Nations. [59] 3 August Treaty 1 is signed between the Chippewa and Swampy Cree First Nations and the Crown surrendering lands in Manitoba [60] 21 August Treaty 2 is signed between the Chippewa Cree First Nation and the Crown surrendering lands in Manitoba and Saskatchewan [60] 1873 23 May The North-West Mounted Police is established to enforce Canadian sovereignty of the Northwest Territories. [61] 1 July Prince Edward Island enters Confederation as the seventh province. [62] 3 October Treaty 3 is signed between the Ojibwe First Nations and the Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in Northwestern Ontario (present-day) and Manitoba [63] 1874 15 September Treaty 4 is signed between the Cree First Nations and the Crown of Canada, surrendering lands in present-day Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba. [64] 1875 20 September Treaty 5 is signed between the Saulteaux and Swampy Cree First Nations and the Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario. [65] 1876 12 April The Indian Act is passed. The Act updates previous legislation of the Province of Canada addressing the relationship between the Government of Canada and officially recognized First Nations. It establishes official definitions of \"Indian status\" and defines Indigenous government. [66] 23, 28 August 9 September Treaty 6 is signed between the Plain and Wood Cree First Nations and the Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in present-day Alberta and Saskatchewan. 1877 22 September Treaty 7 is signed by the Nakoda and Blackfoot First Nations and the Canadian Crown, surrendering lands in southern present-day Alberta. [68] 1880 1 September The British Arctic Territories are ceded to Canada, becoming part of the Northwest Territories. [69] 1885 26 March – 3 June Several hundred Catholic Francophone Métis led by Louis Riel and supported by Cree fighters mount the North-West Rebellion and establish the Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. Riel is captured at the Battle of Batoche (9–12 May), tried for treason, and hanged on 16 November 1885. Francophones bitterly denounce the sentence and Canada becomes deeply polarized along ethno-religious lines. [70][71] 7 November The transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), then the longest in the world, is completed. [72] 1889 The Peasant Farm Policy is brought into force. The Policy restricted Indigenous farmers agricultural practices. Indigenous farmers are allowed only to use hand tools, both in the seeding, harvesting and milling. Indigenous farmers were only allowed small plots and not sell produce in competition with settlers. It is discontinued in 1897. [73] 1896 16 August Gold is discovered in the Klondike region of the Yukon Territory, sparking the Klondike Gold Rush. Tens of thousands flood into the Klondike region during 1897 and 1898. 1899 8 July Treaty 8 is signed by the Cree, Beaver, Chipewyan First Nations and the Canadian Crown, surrendering 840,000 square kilometres (320,000 sq mi) of lands in present-day British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.
