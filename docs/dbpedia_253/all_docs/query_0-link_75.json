All our funeral directors are licensed, caring, and exceptional at what they do. Whatâ€™s different about our company is that we do not own our own chapel or visitation space. Reducing what we must physically maintain and minimizing overhead costs allows us to reduce the fees we charge to you and all the families we serve. Our company rents existing public locations across the province to host the services we provide. Our staff is trained to identify the needs of families and offer options that suit their needs. We work with them to provide what they and their loved one would have wanted, without sales pressure. Our flexibility allows us to provide a meaningful service at an affordable cost. Whether we meet in person, converse through email, or discuss over the phone, we work to provide constant and effective communication every step of the way\n\nOne of our Funeral Directors will send you a custom quotation that is guaranteed for at least 60 days. Fill out the form or talk to a director now at (877) 229-7077."
