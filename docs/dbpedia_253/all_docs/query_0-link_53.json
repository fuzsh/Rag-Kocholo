        "text": "I wrote to Stephan Blais today about the bill and was pleasantly surprised to hear he is one of the few who've vote NAY on Ford's plan. I wanted to share his reply so his Orleans constituents know he does support the workers and their strike.\n\n\"As you know, I am not a member of Mr. Ford’s government and it won’t surprise you to learn that I don’t agree with their approach to ongoing labour negotiations with CUPE.\n\nWhile nobody wants our children’s schools to close as a result of a work stoppage, the government has an obligation to negotiate fairly with education workers.\n\nProactively removing their rights, imposing a contract on them, and using the notwithstanding clause of the constitution to override their Charter Protections is unacceptable. By legislatively imposing a new contract on education workers, Doug Ford and Stephen Lecce are creating more chaos and confusion in schools, and increasing uncertainty for parents.\n\nThis is why I voted against the Bill at first reading.\n\nI was proud to stand with education workers as they marched in the freezing temperatures in February 2020 and I will always fight to ensure our kids have the best schools and school resources possible – and that includes the employees who make our schools the special places they are.\""
