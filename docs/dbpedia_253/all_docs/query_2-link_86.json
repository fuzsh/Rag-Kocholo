        "text": "Good Monday morning!\n\nThere’s only a bit more than a year left in Gov. Phil Murphy’s term, and he’s still alive — perhaps because NJ Transit is far from fixed.\n\nIt’s been another “Summer of Hell” for Garden State commuters relying on the aging rail infrastructure that plagues the Northeast Corridor. And this summer, much if not all of that blame has been placed on Amtrak, which owns said infrastructure..\n\nBut that doesn’t mean NJ Transit has no responsibility. A train at the tail end of evening rush hour Thursday lost power, leaving passengers without air conditioning on a hot day and, after the backup lights shut off, in the dark.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the power failure emanated from Amtrak hardware. But as far as I know, it’s not Amtrak’s responsibility to inform riders about what’s going on, and Bloomberg reported that “occasional announcements were mostly limited to assuring passengers they’d be moving ‘shortly.’” For more on that, read this Reddit post from a passenger.\n\nTIPS? FEEDBACK? Email me at [email protected].\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: Richard Lawton, Gary Chiusano, Amy Kuperinsky, Stephanie Doherty\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “While I support all of my family members, including my sister Valentina, in their personal endeavors, we often have different views. My life story and trajectory reflect my commitment to inclusivity, respect, and equality for all individuals. I do not share the views expressed in her statement.” — Jersey City mayoral aide Jonathan Gomez, a member of Jersey City’s LGBTQ+ task force’s Outreach and Public Relations Committee who has donated $1,250 to the hate-filled Missouri secretary of state campaign of his sister.\n\nWHERE’S MURPHY? — Italy\n\nWHAT TRENTON MADE\n\nMISSED CONDUCT — “Police misconduct database offers too limited a look at disciplinary histories, critics say,” by New Jersey Monitor’s Dana DiFilippo: “When state public safety officials ordered law enforcement agencies in 2020 to publicly identify officers guilty of serious misconduct, they wanted departments to disclose 20 years of data, aiming to build the community’s trust and alert officers that their actions were not above public scrutiny. … But after police unions fought the issue in court, the Attorney General’s Office quietly caved, retracting their requirement that a handful of state agencies retroactively report the names of officers who faced major discipline. The state police alone had nearly 500 cases of major discipline over the prior two decades, so the decision ensured that hundreds and potentially thousands of cases of past police misconduct would remain hidden — including those of officers still on the job today. Now, the public can get that information just back to 2021, with the latest data released this week.”\n\nTRENTON IS NOT ALLENTOWN — “Hudson Democrat eyes retirement after one term in Trenton,” by New Jersey Globe’s David Wildstein: “A freshman lawmaker from Hudson County is not expected to seek re-election to a second term next year, possibly opening the door for Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla to run for the State Assembly in the 32nd district. Assemblyman John Allen (D-Hoboken) has told political allies that he isn’t interested in returning to Trenton and will instead focus on his private sector responsibilities and possibly continue his public service in an appointed capacity. … Allen was Bhalla’s pick for the Assembly seat last year. He is Bhalla’s former chief of staff and assistant corporation counsel for the city of Hoboken. While Guy would not confirm Allen’s possible departure, he indicated that Bhalla has some fence-mending to do.”\n\n—“Parents won’t see a school supply discount this year as New Jersey repeals tax holiday”\n\n—“Stack won’t back Marenco for assembly”\n\nCARTOON BREAK — “Phil Murphy has some growing up to do,” by Drew Sheneman\n\nBIDEN TIME\n\nTHERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT A TRAIN THAT’S MADNESS — Biden’s love for Amtrak can’t save it from a cruel summer, by POLITICO’s Jordan Wolman: Commuters and other travelers along America’s busiest stretch of passenger railway have faced a nightmare summer of heat-related delays and cancellations that are complicating the transit legacy of a president nicknamed “Amtrak Joe.” Record heat has exposed long-standing physical problems along the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Virginia that highlight the need for planned improvements that would get a big boost from the bipartisan infrastructure law while leaving officials without immediate answers for outraged constituents. “It’s incredibly frustrating,” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a potential 2025 gubernatorial candidate and lead negotiator for the landmark infrastructure law. “People are going to lose faith in the transportation system. It just ups the urgency of investing and addressing these issues.” This summer’s struggles are threatening to derail Amtrak’s post-Covid rebound, which has seen Northeast Corridor ridership exceed pre-pandemic levels and spurred expansion plans aimed at doubling overall ridership by 2040. But they’ve also raised questions about the rail system operator’s ability to balance growth ambitions with the need to upgrade and maintain existing service at a time when climate goals depend on getting people out of polluting cars.\n\n—“In Boonton, Bashaw takes on ‘the impossible’”\n\n—“NJ’s CD-10 on autopilot”\n\nLOCAL\n\nHOT NORCROSS BUNS — “Think indicted Democratic boss George Norcross only influences Camden County? Think again,” by The Press of Atlantic City’s Michelle Brunetti Post: “Indicted Camden County Democratic political boss and insurance executive George E. Norcross III has kept a low public profile in the Atlantic City area, but that doesn’t mean his influence here isn’t deep and wide. … Norcross had a hand in crafting the state’s takeover of Atlantic City, determining how the closed Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Forked River would be cleaned up and helping Cape Regional Health System in Cape May Court House merge with Camden’s Cooper University Health Care. He also has been the subject of a fight this year among Atlantic County Republicans over his insurance firm. … winning bids to run the county’s joint insurance fund accounts … ‘My Republican friends blow George Norcross out of proportion … as if everybody takes marching orders from George Norcross,’ Atlantic County Democratic Chair Michael Suleiman said. … Two years ago, Norcross invested in the historic Formica Bros. Bakery in Atlantic City, known for making “Atlantic City bread,” and creating new ties here”\n\nEUROTRASHED — “Company owned by Jersey City construction official to pay $101K for workers’ rights violations,” by The Jersey Journal’s Ron Zeitlinger: “A Jersey City construction company co-owned by the chairman of the city’s Construction Board of Appeals has agreed to pay more than $101,000 to settle workers’ rights violations after the state shut down four of its work sites in Hudson County. Euro Concrete, co-owned by Kuldeep ‘Sunny’ Kumar, has also agreed to an enhanced compliance plan and one of its subcontractors, Yolo Construction of North Bergen, was issued a company-wide order to halt all work by the state Department of Labor (DOL). Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop has requested that Kumar step down from his chairman position, but Kumar has refused, city spokesman Stan Eason said. … The violations included improper classification of construction workers, failing to properly classify employees, overtime rate violations, improper earned sick leave records, improper notification/posting of earned sick leave, and unpaid wages/late payment.”\n\nRENT CONTROL — “Hoboken councilmembers face indecision, tenant pushback in leadup to final rent control vote,” by The Jersey Journal’s Teri West: “Hoboken is hurling toward a rare Monday night city council meeting, held over Zoom, to vote on what would be the most significant unraveling of rent control in years. Monday’s meeting is the climax of months of pressure from the city’s landlord-interest group, and the ordinance in question would let landlords increase rates for incoming tenants in rent-controlled units by up to 75% more than currently allowed. Heading into the weekend, councilmembers and tenant advocates alike found themselves flustered, frustrated and unsure about what is in store for the next week as they’ve been forced into overdrive despite the topic in question being one of the most delicate in the city.”\n\nHINES PURCHASE LEAVES RENTERS PLAYING CATSUP — “With real estate investment firms pouncing in Jersey City, experts fear the worst for rental prices,” by The Jersey Journal’s Joshua Rosario: “A global real estate giant has entered Jersey City’s sizzling real estate market with a staggering $221 million purchase of two luxury apartment buildings, sparking fears of an escalation of rents in a city that is already among the U.S.’s most expensive to reside. The acquisition by Hines, a leading global real estate firm with more than $93 billion in assets worldwide, of adjacent multifamily apartment towers in the Paulus Hook neighborhood is one of the largest purchases in Jersey City history … And that very well could send rising rents in the city — where nearly 80% of its residents don’t own their own home — even higher. The market has already seen rent increase by upwards of 20% since the COVID-19 pandemic, but that hasn’t diminished the demand for housing in Jersey City, most notably New Yorkers.”\n\nKEYSTONED COPS — Federal judge declines to weigh in on Jersey City’s cops and cannabis question — for now, by POLITICO’s Daniel Han: A federal judge is declining to weigh in on Jersey City’s request to be able to fire cops for off-duty cannabis usage, although the court may revisit the issue down the road. United States District Judge Julien Xavier Neals on Friday issued a ruling that stayed clear of the underlying legal questions of the lawsuit brought forth by Jersey City, namely whether the city could fire cops for off-duty cannabis usage. Instead, Neals ruled that the court would not weigh in on the issue until it is adjudicated in state-level legal proceedings. The outcome is the latest of several legal setbacks for Jersey City, which made headlines in 2023 for its efforts to bar its law enforcement officers from using cannabis off duty.\n\n—“Students need mental health support, a sense of belonging to stay in school, Newark teens say”\n\n—“Because Chewie was such a success, Clifton schools will get two more therapy dogs”\n\n—“\"The backbone to our building\": Principal transfer for Paterson’s School 15 is under fire”\n\n—“This job was the ‘honor of my lifetime,’ [Mercer] prosecutor says on his last day”\n\n—“Jersey Shore visitors warned to not touch, ingest anything on possibly contaminated beach”\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\nTERROIRISM — “Are wines from Jersey as good as those from France? This N.J. couple thinks so.,” by NJ Advance Media’s Matthew Enuco: “They may not be from the south of France, but wines that come from grapes grown in the south of New Jersey might be just as sweet – especially for one Garden State couple who is seeing its viniculture dreams come true. ‘It may seem strange to some, but New Jersey actually has an outstanding climate for growing wine,’ Mike Halpern told NJ Advance media in July. The Halperns chose their vineyards based on ‘terroir’ a famous French term for the climate and soil composition that provides local character to the vines that produce wine grapes. Halpern and his wife, Robin, a retired couple originally from Collingswood, became grape farmers when they purchased about 15 acres of land in Fairfield Township in Cumberland County in 1998.”\n\nIT’S A NOTE FROM CAPTAIN AHAB ENCOURAGING NJ TO BUILD WINDMILLS — “Jersey Shore message in a bottle could be the oldest in the world,” by NJ Advance Mediao’s Eric Conklin: “During a recent morning walk at Corson’s Inlet State Park in Ocean City, Amy Smyth Murphy made her way from the deep sand toward the ocean, finding a green-color corked bottle with paper inside. Excited, the Haddon Heights resident returned to the beach house to study the bottle, opening it to find pieces of paper, one of which appeared to be a business card possibly from 1876 and the other being a handwritten note. The bottle, Smyth Murphy believes, may have been tossed from a vessel 10 years before the current world record holder went to sea. … The discovery comes after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers performed a multimillion-dollar beach fill project in the area of Ocean City and Strathmere. … Steve Nagiewicz, who teaches maritime history and marine archeology at Stockton University, told NJ Advance Media the project may have broken the bottle free from the silt.”\n\nBYE — “Christopher Gregor sentencing: 25 years in son Corey Micciolo’s death,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Kathleen Hopkins: “Five days before he died as a result of child abuse, 6-year-old Corey Micciolo asked his grandmother, “Does God see what my daddy does to me,?’' Rebecca Micciolo told a judge Friday. “I told him God sees everything,’' Rebecca Micciolo, his maternal grandmother, said. Then, Corey asked her, “Why his Daddy isn’t going to hell, and I replied, ‘He will one day,’' Rebecca Micciolo said. That day has yet to come, but on Friday, Superior Court Judge Guy P. Ryan sentenced the boy’s father, Christopher Gregor, to 25 years in state prison - 20 years for aggravated manslaughter and five years for endangering the child’s welfare.”\n\n—“Get a grip: Arm wrestlers compete on Atlantic City Boardwalk”\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nMatt Friedman @mattfriedmannj"
