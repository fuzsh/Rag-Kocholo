        "text": "NEWS\n\n1. Disability advocates want more progress on report\n\n“Members of the Disability Rights Coalition say the government is moving too slowly to move people with disabilities out of institutions,” Jennifer Henderson writes this morning.\n\nBack in 2019, a Human Rights Commission Board of Inquiry ruled Joey Delaney, Beth MacLean, and Sheila Livingstone were denied income and housing supports that could have allowed them to live outside the Nova Scotia Hospital, where they had lived for decades.\n\nIn a groundbreaking October 2021 ruling, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal extended the 2019 decision to find that the province had systemically discriminated against up to 1,000 people with disabilities, and ordered the Human Rights Commission’s Board of Inquiry to decide their fate.\n\nThe Houston government appealed that ruling, but lost the appeal last year.\n\nPremier Tim Houston then apologized to people with disabilities and promised the province would do better.\n\nSo, how is that progress coming along? Not so well, as Henderson writes. Michael Prince, the Acting Dean of Human and Social Development at the University of Victoria, issued a progress report called “Getting On Track” that found significant shortcomings.\n\nThe Disability Rights Coalition (DRC) issued a news release asking Houston to take on the file. Here’s what advocate and coalition spokesperson Vicky Levack had to say:\n\nThe report confirms what the DRC has said, about the lack of progress. The premier has now got to show leadership…the province has all the foundational pieces in place, it has a technical report setting out the path forward, it has experts on standby, the premier just has to return to the values and urgency he so clearly expressed in his historic apology and get the Remedy on track before any more time is lost.\n\nClick or tap here to read “Province is moving too slowly to move people with disabilities out of institutions: advocates.”\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n2. Library workers vote to strike\n\n“Halifax Public Libraries employees could go on strike as early as August 26, according to members of NSUPE Local 14. The union represents some 350 of the library’s workers, including librarians, library assistants, and administrative, technical, and maintenance staff,” reports Philip Moscovitch.\n\nUnion president Christina Covert told the Examiner members voted 82% in favour of a strike. In an interview, she said results of the vote were communicated to members on Monday, July 26, and that turnout for the vote was very high, “which is a little atypical for our particular union.”\n\nThe union and the library participated in a conciliation session on July 29, and have another meeting scheduled for August 25. If they don’t come to an agreement at that session, library workers could walk out the next day.\n\nThere are five main issues on the table: wages, and issues related to job appointments, parental leave top-ups, benefits, and employees who are absent without approved leave. Both the union and the library confirmed that they have resolved the job appointment and benefits concerns, with the other three remaining outstanding.\n\nWages, Covert said are “at the top” of the list. She said clerks, the lowest-paid library staff, start at “$1.25 above minimum wage… and the majority of them are also part-time.”\n\nChad Murphy, another Local 14 VP, told Moscovitch that some library workers are unhoused and struggling with food insecurity.\n\nI really think many people do not understand what library workers offer to the community and how crucial their work is. Library staff really are second responders.\n\nClick or tap here to read “Halifax Public Libraries workers vote overwhelmingly to strike.”\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n3. Nova Scotia’s working families don’t care about MLS’s spaceport in Canso\n\nOn Friday, I attended a press conference during which the federal Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Sean Fraser made an announcement about the Technology Safeguards Agreement (TSA). That treaty between Canada and the U.S. allows for “U.S. space launch technology, expertise and data for space launches in Canada while ensuring the proper handling of sensitive U.S. technology.”\n\nAlso at the conference was Stephen Matier, president and CEO of Maritime Launch Services (MLS), the company that wants to build and operate a spaceport in Canso. He said the agreement was a big deal for his spaceport plans, which have not gone well so far. Plus, the company is out of money and the launchpad is just a small concrete pad at the end of one road.\n\nYou can read the entire story here.\n\nNow, I was a bit out of my element at this conference. Joan Baxter and Tim Bousquet have been covering MLS and its plans for a spaceport for years now. But we received the press release from Fraser’s office around 6:48pm on Thursday, just 12 minutes before the deadline to register to attend the conference. Baxter and Bousquet had other stories and events in the works, so I volunteered to go.\n\nThe conference was hosted on the patio at the Queen’s Marque offices of law firm Stewart McKelvey. It was very hot and sunny that afternoon, and the patio at least offered a nice view of the Halifax Harbour.\n\nBesides this story, the only other story I’ve written about the Canso spaceport was this one, a profile on Marie Lumsden, one of the residents of Canso who started the group Action Against the Canso Spaceport. I visited Lumsden in March 2023 to learn more about her advocacy work and concerns about what MLS’s plans have done to her beloved community.\n\nSome of what was said at that conference on Friday bothered me. Fortunately, I thought other reporters covering the event had a good dose of skepticism about the whole thing. They asked Fraser, who is the federal minister of housing after all, if he thought Nova Scotians and Canadians wanted him to be focused on the space economy rather than the housing and affordability crises that are leaving people struggling.\n\nFraser said the space economy contributes $2.8 billion to the country’s GDP and creates more than 11,600 jobs for working families. He also said “Canadians expect us to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,” saying it’s possible to respond to short-term challenges and long-term interests.\n\nSure, but I don’t think spending time and money on the space economy is what working families in Canada have in mind.\n\nSometimes I think elected officials don’t even know any working-class people and don’t listen to them if they do. If politicians say they come from working-class backgrounds, it seems they forget what that really means. Brian Mulroney, who came from a working-class background and who Fraser quoted at the press conference on Friday, seemed to forget.\n\nI mean, we here at the Examiner interview and meet working-class Nova Scotians all the time. Not once has a person said to me, “You know what could solve all of our issues? Putting a spaceport in Canso.”\n\nNow, I love learning about space, and I know a lot of people do. I am going to an astronomy event in Advocate Harbour next week and am really looking forward to it. I like learning that birds use the moon and stars to navigate. Whenever there is a strawberry moon, a harvest moon, or a gorgeous vibrant full moon, simply check out the photos on social media. People love learning about what’s in the universe. I know nothing about satellite technology but know the tech I use is supported by satellites. People aren’t against space exploration.\n\nBut the spaceport in Canso ain’t that. I mean, read again what Matier said on Friday about an upcoming suborbital launch he called Stories in Space planned for later this year:\n\nThere are bunches and bunches of kids around the country that have written stories that are going to go on these flash drives that will be launched and retrieved and returned to them.\n\nI could write all kinds of stories, put them on a flash drive, and attach it to any one of the many fireworks random people set off on random weeknights where I live in Fairview, but I would never call it space exploration.\n\nWorking families in Nova Scotia are worried about being able to afford rent and their mortgages. They are worried about the cost of groceries and feeding their families. They worry about their children’s futures and their aging parents. They worry about crumbling education and health care systems. On an average day, they don’t think about spaceports.\n\nDuring my time working in radio, where the owner called paying employees barely above minimum wage “competitive”, a colleague said to me that people want to make enough money to pay their bills, take care of their children, and take their families on a nice vacation once in a while. For many, that is becoming harder to do, and it’s really not much to ask for.\n\nIt’s working families in Canso who have been fighting against the spaceport since 2019. From what I can tell — and despite what Stephen Matier says — MLS doesn’t have as much “social licence” in the community as he thinks it does.\n\nMarie Lumsden is a working resident of Canso, who works as a caregiver for local families and grows flowers in her backyard that she sells in bouquets. She grew up in Canso and over the years has seen the ways in which governments have failed her community. She called MLS’s plans an “invasion.” Lumsden’s partner, Curtis Munroe, told me he wasn’t convinced MLS would get a rocket off the ground.\n\nWhen I interviewed Marie Lumsden in the winter of 2023, I asked her about other options that would create opportunities and bring people to Canso. She said she’d like more promotion of the natural environment to people who love bird watching, hiking, and so on. She also said she’d like to see a tour boat ferry connecting Canso to Isle Madame on Cape Breton, which is about nine miles away by boat. She said that could create a scenic loop visitors could take to drive through Cape Breton and Guysborough County. I like that idea, and suspect if someone asked, many residents of Canso have other great ideas, too.\n\nBut alas, even if someone did ask, elected officials would never grant Lumsden or those residents a platform on the patio of a downtown Halifax law firm overlooking the harbour on a gorgeous summer day.\n\n(Send this item as a separate article: right click and copy this link)\n\n4. Acadian research\n\n“With the Congrès mondial acadien (CMA–Acadian World Congress) kicking off in southwestern Nova Scotia next weekend, a university researcher is hoping that participating Acadians also consider taking a few minutes to help with her research,” reports Yvette d’Entremont.\n\nAs part of her study, Université Sainte-Anne psychology professor Kristel Mayrand is conducting an online survey seeking to measure the social and psychological effects of the CMA event on participants, as well as its impact on their sense of Acadian identity.\n\nPeople are asked to fill out a survey both before and after the CMA.\n\n“We know that the CMA instills a sense of (Acadian) pride in those who participate,” Mayrand said in an interview conducted in French. “But what we don’t know is whether that pride was already there beforehand. Does it fluctuate over time because of the CMA?”\n\nMayrand’s study is part of a larger project involving 16 co-researchers from Université Sainte-Anne, Université de Moncton, and Carleton University in Ottawa.\n\nClick or tap here to read “Researcher asks Acadians attending world congress in Nova Scotia to help with study.”\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n5. Bird Friendly Halifax\n\n“A nature conservationist and avid bird watcher said a motion approved by Halifax Regional Council’s environment committee to research bird-friendly building design standards is a ‘really big step forward’ in protecting birds in the city,” I reported this morning.\n\nJess Lewis, a conservation programs coordinator with Nature Nova Scotia and the chair of Bird Friendly Halifax, gave a presentation to council’s Environment and Sustainability Committee meeting on Thursday.\n\nBird Friendly City is a certification program offered by Nature Canada. Halifax became an official bird-friendly city in 2022 when council passed a motion to support the program and its requirements. Halifax is the only bird-friendly city in Atlantic Canada.\n\n“That’s a point of pride, but it’s also concerning because there should be other cities,” Lewis said.\n\nLewis spoke about some of the work the Bird Friendly Halifax coalition is doing, including promoting bird-friendly building design to reduce the number of bird strikes on windows in the city.\n\nCoun. Kathryn Morse introduced a motion to request a staff report to look into bird friendly building design, including a jurisdictional scan. Toronto became a bird-friendly city in 2006, and has adopted a number of initiatives since then to reduce window strikes and protect bird habitat.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, I asked Lewis what she thought a city without birds would be.\n\n“There is a community of birders who would be very disappointed. We’re hoping to kind of reverse the trend and hopefully we’ll have more birds in our city, not less,” she said.\n\nI agree.\n\nClick or tap here to read “Halifax council committee wants bird-friendly building design.”\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n6.

He and I spoke about crows before, including how smart the birds are.\n\nWell, a few weeks ago, Stephen Howie at NPR Network wrote this story about how crows are so smart, they are challenging what we know about evolution.\n\nHowie writes:\n\nA 2020 study demonstrated for the first time that carrion crows, the European relatives of American crows, have subjective experiences — “sensory consciousness” — a level of thinking previously thought to be limited to humans and other primates. New Caledonian crows are smart enough to create their own tools — in the wild and the lab — by shaping one end of a stick or wire into a hook to retrieve food beyond the reach of their beaks. In 2024, researchers in Germany taught crows to count out loud, using vocalizations to correspond with numerical values.\n\nDespite these discoveries, the question of how crows, which do not have a prefrontal cortex like humans and other mammals, are capable of high-level thinking, has largely remained a mystery.\n\n“That always was kind of the black box,” said John Marzluff, a professor of wildlife science at the University of Washington who has pioneered the study of crow intelligence. “When they do these really great things, is it just some more robotic response or is it really a reasoned response?”\n\nHowie’s story details the work of several different scientists who are studying crows. That work looks at brain scans of crows and what goes on in the birds’ brains when they are making and using tools. Also, another study is looking at how crows communicate in the wild.\n\nIn May, Matt Galloway with The Current interviewed Melissa Johnston, a post-doctoral researcher at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, who said crows can count.\n\nJohnston told Galloway that crows can not only count, but they can count out loud, similar to how a human toddler might count out toys. I wonder if they counted how many times they shit on Bousquet’s car?\n\nBirds are so fascinating.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\nGovernment\n\nCity\n\nToday\n\nSpecial Meeting – Board of Police Commissioners (Tuesday, 9am, online) — agenda\n\nHalifax Regional Council (Tuesday, 1pm, City Hall and online) — agenda\n\nTomorrow\n\nBoard of Police Commissioners (Wednesday, 1pm, HEMDCC Meeting Space and online) — agenda\n\nProvince\n\nHuman Resources (Tuesday, 1pm, One Government Place and online) — agency, board, and commission appointments\n\nOn campus\n\nDalhousie\n\nToday\n\nPhD Defence: Industrial Engineering (Tuesday, 9:30am, online) — Hai Dang Phi Van will defend “Aggregate Production Planning Integrating Clearing Function Using Nonlinear Function Optimization and Supervised Machine Learning”\n\nPhD Defence: Health (Tuesday, 1pm, Room 3107, Mona Campbell Building and online) — Emily Drake will defend “Exploring the Experience of Transitioning to Palliative Care of Young Adults Living With Metastatic/Advanced Cancer”\n\nTomorrow\n\nPhD Defence: Interdisciplinary PhD Program (Wednesday, 9:30am, online) — Laura Kiiroja will defend“Assistance dogs for PTSD: A study of canine detection accuracy, therapeutic potential, and ethical dimensions”\n\nDalhousie Food Services Job Fair ! *Updated (Wednesday, 10am, Lemarchant Place Atrium) — info here\n\nAlan Syliboy: The Journey So Far | A Retrospective (Wednesday, 11am, Dalhousie Art Gallery) — final week\n\nPhD Defence: Computer Science (Wednesday, 1:30pm, online) — Chinenye Ndulue will defend\n\n“P-Gamer: A Domain-Independent Platform for Tailoring Persuasive Games and Studying their Effectiveness”\n\nKing’s\n\nToday\n\nNo events\n\nTomorrow\n\n“The Things They Carried” – Unveiling the Place of Objects in the Global Circulation of Knowledge (Wednesday, 7pm, Maritime Museum of the Atlantic) — Circulating Knowledge 20 Years On – An International Conference will launch a new online exhibit exploring how scientific objects take on new identities as they move in and out of various social and cultural contexts; more info here and here\n\nIn the harbour\n\nHalifax\n\n05:30: Emerald Princess, cruise ship with up to 3,679 passengers, arrives at Anchorage ! from Boston, on a seven-day roundtrip cruise out of Boston\n\n05:30: Morning Linda, car carrier, arrives at Autoport from Southampton, England\n\n05:45: Celebrity Eclipse, cruise ship with up to 3,420 passengers, arrives at Pier 22 from New York, on a 12-day cruise from New York to Reykjavik\n\n08:00: MSC Sena, container ship, sails from Pier 41 for London, England\n\n09:15: Norwegian Star, cruise ship with up to 2,813 passengers, arrives at Pier 20 from St. John’s, on a 12-day cruise from Reykjavik to New York\n\n15:00: CMA CGM T.
