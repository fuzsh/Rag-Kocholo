        "text": "OTTAWA — The re-elected Liberals have made big promises to green Canada’s economy, regulate the digital realm and support domestic innovators. But in a minority parliament, they’ll need to get opposition parties on board—or at least keep them at bay—to advance their agenda. Meanwhile, the government will face scrutiny from regulators, who are also seeking more powers.\n\nBeyond Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne, who returned to the job post-election with big plans, here are the cabinet members, public servants, regulators and policymakers who will shape the country’s innovation economy this year."
