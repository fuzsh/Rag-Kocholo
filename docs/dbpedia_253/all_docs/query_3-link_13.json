        "text": "“We don't have the time to delay and casually put something out when day after day, we're hearing and experiencing more of these [climate] impacts,” he said, pointing to recent research linking nearly 40 per cent of North America’s wildfires between 1986 and 2021 to emissions from the fossil fuel and cement industries.\n\nGuilbeault insists the working group will not delay the emissions cap.\n\n“Our intentions are unwavering,” he said. “We will be putting out an oil and gas cap, and we will be doing it this year.” Whether it's draft legislation or draft regulation, “Canadians and Canadian industry will have a fairly good idea of what we're trying to do this year,” he said, even if the cap itself doesn’t go into effect until later.\n\nBut Guilbeault added that because the Constitution gives provincial governments jurisdiction over natural resources, the federal government is being careful to design the emissions cap regulations in a way that “is clearly aimed at emissions and not production.” Failing to do so could make it vulnerable to a court challenge from the provinces. In a 2021 ruling, the Supreme Court of Canada found Ottawa’s price on pollution was constitutional — a decision that solidified the federal government's jurisdiction over tackling emissions.\n\nThat case was brought to the Supreme Court through a series of legal challenges led by Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario.\n\nThe proposed emissions cap, which Guilbeault said was needed to reach 2030 and 2050 emission reduction targets, “will likely get challenged.”\n\n“We need to make sure we have all our ducks in a row to ensure we're on solid legal ground because it will get challenged,” he said.\n\nPressure mounting\n\nAt the premiers conference this week in Winnipeg, Smith wasn’t the only leader to put Ottawa’s environmental and clean energy policies in its crosshairs.\n\nSaskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said ratepayers in his province could be on the hook for $8 billion worth of stranded assets if his province has to meet federal clean electricity regulations that require a clean power grid by 2035. New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs, a former Irving Oil executive, took aim at clean fuel regulations, accusing the federal government of increasing the costs people pay at the pump, even though it was a provincial regulation that allowed a refinery like Irving Oil to pass costs directly onto consumers before incurring any costs itself.\n\nIn Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston has his hands out looking for more federal investment in the Atlantic Loop to help reach clean electricity goals, while Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called Guilbeault “a real piece of work” for criticizing the province’s climate plans. The two have also gotten into dustups over Ford’s plan to pave through the Greenbelt.\n\n“I must confess that I'm a bit disappointed by the position taken by the premiers that we should do less to fight climate change in a time where we're seeing floodings, record forest fires and heat waves,” Guilbeault said. “I'm forced to ask myself … what will it take for them to get on board with the fight against climate change?\n\n“I'm not saying they're all climate deniers,” he said. “But most of the time when we listen to some of them talk about these things it's to say there's too much being done to fight climate change, and I profoundly disagree with that.”\n\nUniversity of Victoria associate professor James Rowe says it shouldn’t come as a surprise that provinces with major fossil fuel interests — whether they are producers of oil and gas, home to major refineries or have companies like Enbridge with a virtual monopoly on the grid — are teaming up to fight climate policy.\n\nThere are “very powerful corporate interests in each of these jurisdictions where you're seeing stiff resistance,” he said.\n\nRowe added there’s a “petro nationalism that still predominates Canada,” where oil and gas companies have been able to make their interests appear to many to be the same as provincial interests. Those fossil fuel companies understand their self-interest involves extracting and selling fossil fuels and is thereby at risk due to clean energy policies, he said.\n\n“Totally dispiriting and planet-destroying, but utterly rational that they'd be fighting tooth and nail to defend their ability to maximize profit,” he said.\n\n“The fact (provinces) would be fighting, and [organizing] together to resist what's coming down from Ottawa … those dynamics make perfect sense to me,” he said. “It's unfortunate that significant resistance to climate action remains part of the conservative brand both in Canada and also down south, given all the cultural exchange that happens between conservative movements in North America.\n\n“So it's dispiriting but utterly predictable.”\n\n— With files from The Canadian Press"
