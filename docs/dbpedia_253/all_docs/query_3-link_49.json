        "text": "The Spaniel’s Tale bookstore is one such spot.\n\n“We want to make sure it’s a safe space where people can read the books that they want,” says Crocker. “People are just looking for access to information and we just want to make sure that we are providing a space where people can do that comfortably.”\n\nCrocker says the community’s reaction has been “overwhelmingly positive” and encouraging of acceptance and inclusion.\n\nAs a queer business owner, Crocker hopes younger members of the community can see themselves owning a business, regardless of race or sexuality.\n\n“We are really proud to serve this neighbourhood, and to be able to serve the community and to be a safe space where people can come to buy a book, or even just to come in and chat,” says Crocker.\n\nAlong with Crocker, Susie Pearson, owner of Hintonburg Kids, is happy to provide an inclusive space for 2SLGBTQIA+ families. Since the shop opened in 2002, Pearson says its retail habits have evolved with parenting trends. She says she is happy to cater her business practices and products to accommodate Ottawa’s queer community.\n\n“I opened the business to supply new parents with products I found helpful, now I stock products that keep kids engaged,” says Pearson.\n\nFour per cent of Canada’s population, age 15 and older, identifies as 2SLGBTQIA+, according to a 2018 Statistics Canada survey.\n\nHoping to promote diversity, and provide insight on the challenges faced by the queer community, Hintonburg Kids has a 2SLGBTQIA+ inclusive book selection.\n\n“It’s nice to see stores that cater to all members of the community,” says Pearson. “The quality of books is so much better than when my own children were young. It’s nice to stock books that reflect all types of families, and that educate people about gender and sexuality, and acceptance.”\n\nWhile Pearson hopes queer businesses will continue to provide opportunities for people to educate themselves, she is concerned that recent anti-2SLGBTQIA+ education protests will breed hostility and misconceptions.\n\n“There is a lot of misinformation spread by the anti-2SLGBTQIA+, so it’s more important than ever to ensure that our community has the resources to support its 2SLGBTQIA+ members, and that means helping ensure that everyone (children and adults) is well-educated, and that we strive to create a supportive, inclusive space,” says Pearson."
