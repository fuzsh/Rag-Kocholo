        "text": "From settlement to 1900\n\nThe first writers of English in Canada were visitors—explorers, travelers, and British officers and their wives—who recorded their impressions of British North America in charts, diaries, journals, and letters. These foundational documents of journeys and settlements presage the documentary tradition in Canadian literature in which geography, history, and arduous voyages of exploration and discovery represent the quest for a myth of origins and for a personal and national identity. As the critic Northrop Frye observed, Canadian literature is haunted by the overriding question “Where is here?”; thus, metaphoric mappings of peoples and places became central to the evolution of the Canadian literary imagination.\n\nThe earliest documents were unadorned narratives of travel and exploration. Written in plain language, these accounts document heroic journeys to the vast, unknown west and north and encounters with Inuit and other native peoples (called First Nations in Canada), often on behalf of the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North West Company, the great fur-trading companies. The explorer Samuel Hearne wrote A Journey from Prince of Wales’s Fort in Hudson’s Bay to the Northern Ocean (1795), and Sir Alexander Mackenzie, an explorer and fur trader, described his travels in Voyages from Montreal…Through the Continent of North America, to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans (1801). Simon Fraser recorded details of his 1808 trip west to Fraser Canyon (The Letters and Journals of Simon Fraser, 1806–1808, 1960). Captain John Franklin’s published account of a British naval expedition to the Arctic, Narrative of a Journey to the Shores of the Polar Sea (1823), and his mysterious disappearance during a subsequent journey reemerged in the 20th century in the writing of authors Margaret Atwood and Rudy Wiebe. A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt (1815) is a captivity narrative that describes Jewitt’s experience as a prisoner of the Nootka (Nuu-chah-nulth) chief Maquinna after Jewitt was shipwrecked off Canada’s west coast; on the whole, it presents a sympathetic ethnography of the Nuu-chah-nulth people. The Diary of Mrs. John Graves Simcoe (1911) records the everyday life in 1792–96 of the wife of the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada (now Ontario). In 1838 Anna Jameson published Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, an account of her travels in the New World.\n\nFrances Brooke, the wife of a visiting British military chaplain in the conquered French garrison of Quebec, wrote the first published novel with a Canadian setting. Her History of Emily Montague (1769) is an epistolary romance describing the sparkling winter scenery of Quebec and the life and manners of its residents.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines\n\nHalifax, in the colony of Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick’s Fredericton were the scenes of the earliest literary flowering in Canada. The first literary journal, the Nova-Scotia Magazine, was published in Halifax in 1789. The town’s literary activity was invigorated by an influx of loyalists during the American Revolution and by the energetic Joseph Howe, a journalist, a poet, and the first premier of Nova Scotia. Two of the most potent influences on literary development were in evidence by the end of the 18th century: literary magazines and presses and a strong sense of regionalism. By satirizing the dialect, habits, and foibles of Nova Scotians, or Bluenoses, Thomas McCulloch, in his serialized Letters of Mephibosheth Stepsure (1821–22), and Thomas Chandler Haliburton, in The Clockmaker (1835–36), featuring the brash Yankee peddler Sam Slick, adroitly brought their region to life and helped found the genre of folk humour.\n\nMost of the earliest poems were patriotic songs and hymns (The Loyal Verses of Joseph Stansbury and Doctor Jonathan Odell, 1860) or topographical narratives, reflecting the first visitors’ concern with discovering and naming the new land and its inhabitants. In The Rising Village (1825), native-born Oliver Goldsmith used heroic couplets to celebrate pioneer life and the growth of Nova Scotia, which, in his words, promised to be “the wonder of the Western Skies.” His optimistic tones were a direct response to the melancholy poem written by his Anglo-Irish granduncle, Oliver Goldsmith, whose The Deserted Village (1770) concludes with the forced emigration of dispossessed villagers.\n\nImmigrants, dreaming of a new Eden but encountering instead the realities of unpredictable native peoples, a fierce climate, unfamiliar wildlife, and physical and cultural deprivation, were the subject of prose sketches by the Strickland sisters, Susanna Strickland Moodie and Catherine Parr Strickland Traill. Moodie’s harsh, yet at times comical, Roughing It in the Bush (1852) was written to discourage prospective emigrants, but Traill’s Backwoods of Canada (1836) presents a more favourable picture of the New World.\n\nThe Dominion of Canada, created in 1867 by the confederation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Upper Canada, and Lower Canada (now Quebec), precipitated a flurry of patriotic and literary activity. The so-called Confederation poets turned to the landscape in their search for a truly native verse. Unlike their predecessors, they no longer merely described or moralized nature but attempted to capture what the Ottawa poet Archibald Lampman called the “answering harmony between the soul of the poet and the spirit and mystery of nature.” New Brunswick poet Charles G.D. Roberts inspired his cousin, the prolific and vagabond Bliss Carman, as well as Lampman and Duncan Campbell Scott, also an Ottawa poet, to begin writing verse. Lampman is known for his meditations on the landscape. Scott, who was a government administrator, has become better known for advocating the assimilation of First Nation peoples than for his poetry’s depiction of Canada’s northern wilderness. Perhaps the most original poet of this period was Isabella Valancy Crawford, whose colourful mythopoeic verse, with its images drawn from the lore of native peoples, pioneer life, mythology, and a symbolic animated nature, was published as Old Spookses’ Pass, Malcolm’s Katie, and Other Poems in 1884."
