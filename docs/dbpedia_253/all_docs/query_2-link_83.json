        "text": "Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the City's Wildlife Speaker Series. Thank you for welcoming us into your home tonight. My name is Amy MacPherson, and I work in the City's Natural Systems and Rural Affairs unit. Bon soir, tous le monde. Bienvenue. Notre présentation ce soir est en anglais. Si vous voulez, vous pouvez utiliser la fonction « Interprétation » dans le pannaux de contrôles, et choisissez « Français ». Merci à nos interprètes!\n\nThe instructions as you can see are here on the slide. The interpretation icon is down at the bottom of the screen, usually, in the Zoom window. Okay. Thank you, Stephane. Next slide, please. Tonight's presentation is being recorded and will be posted on YouTube. Please make sure that your video is turned off if you don't want to be seen.\n\nYour microphones will be kept on mute until the question period at the end of the presentation tonight. At that time, we invite you to raise your virtual hands using the reaction function at the bottom of the Zoom screen, which you can see some instructions on here. And we will take your questions in the order that they are received.\n\nOur staff will unmute your microphone when it is your turn to ask your question. Please remember to lower your virtual hand once you've had your turn, or if someone else asks the same question you were going to ask.\n\nNext slide, please, Stephane. We are streaming live from the City of Ottawa, which is built on the Unceded territory of the Anishinaabe Algonquin Nation. The peoples of the Anishinaabe Algonquin Nation have lived on this territory for millennia. Their culture and presence have nurtured and continue to nurture this land. La Ville d'Ottawa rend hommage aux peuples et au territoire de la Nation Anishinaabe Algonquine. La ville d'Ottawa rend hommage a toutes les Premieres Nations, les Inuit et les Metis et leurs precieuses contributions passees et presentes a cette terre.. We encourage all those listening, wherever you might be, to do the same. Miigwetch. Spring is one of my favorite seasons. When the wildflowers start coming up. As you can see, the trillium on the slide here, the birds start nesting and so many wild creatures are out and about. I especially enjoy walking in the woods before the mosquitoes and black flies start swarming.\n\nThere is another tiny bloodsucker to watch out for, though, and it's the subject of our presentation tonight. The tick. When I was growing up and starting my career as a field biologist in the Hamilton area, ticks weren't something I worried about. Then we started hearing about a different type of tick at Long Point and a few other southern Ontario sites.\n\nNow, blacklegged ticks and Lyme disease are always, at least in the back of my mind, whenever I'm heading out to spend time in nature. It's another thing to protect myself from, just like I always need to remember to wear my sunscreen and my hat. So tonight, we'll learn about how to protect ourselves from tick borne diseases with a presentation from Alison Samuel of Ottawa Public Health.\n\nWe'll also learn more about our local tick population and the ongoing research being conducted by Dr. Manisha Kulkarni and her colleagues at the University of Ottawa. I'd like to welcome them both to our virtual stage.\n\nWe'll ask Alison to start us off with the presentation by Ottawa Public Health. Okay, thank you so much Amy. And again, I'm happy to be here this evening. Just a word of caution to the audience, on occasion my camera has a little bit of a freakout. So if you do see that I need to close my camera. Just so you're aware.\n\nOkay. I will go ahead now and share screen so that I can start the presentation. Okay. So thanks again for being here this evening. My goal tonight is to share with you just some introductory information about Lyme disease and also to share with you Ottawa Public Health, our public health messaging for Lyme disease. So that is the main purpose of tonight.\n\nSurely this is not likely the first time that our audience is hearing about Lyme disease and its association with TICK or even the messaging. But this is meant to be a bit of a reinforcement and a share for those who may be just new to the discussion. Or there goes my camera. I'm going to go ahead and turn that off. At least you've got the presentation.\n\nSo, yes, I'll continue on again. So starting very basic and very simply, you see a picture here of an everything bagel. Surely you've all seen this at some point in our lives here in Canada. So the main purpose of sharing this picture with you is so that you get a representation of the size of of ticks. So be it the nymph or be it the adult.\n\nThis would be general sizing that you would see. So the poppy seeds, the black, tiny ones would be the nymphs and the sesame seeds would be the larger adults. As you know, or may not know. It's hard to gauge what the knowledge is, but the the the tick that is responsible all for transmission of Lyme disease is called Ixodes scapularis, in general terms or general common name.\n\nIt's called the black legged tick. Another common name for it also is the deer tick. And this is a representation of an adult female.\n\nSo these are the main vector here. Again, this is so these the disease is carried by bacterial infection transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. The tick first gets infected by biting on small animals such as mice, squirrel, birds that carry the bacteria, which is in fact called Borrelia burgdorferi. And this is primarily how the disease is transmitted.\n\nWhen that tick or the nymph, it then bites a person as an intermediate. Moving on. Again, this is very basic information and a quick scan, just so that you're able to see where we're at when it comes to Lyme disease. So, again, a little bit of background information that I can share with you. Going back one slide is that as birds and mammals travel, they tend to spread the infected tick populations to new areas.\n\nWe'll see in another slide how that has spread across Ontario. So Lyme disease, a bit of background history was originally discovered or identified in Lyme, Connecticut, which is where it gets its name back in the mid seventies, 1975. And over the years, it has spread north from there to, sorry into the northern U.S. and into Canada. So a little bit of a representation.\n\nPublic Health Ontario is one of the agencies that does the monitoring that we're, that there's a monitoring for how the disease is spread and how the tick is also spread. So here I hope it's not too small is a representation. And we know that historically that it started about here in Turkey Point and it spread east and of course north up to Thunder Bay.\n\nSo that's a quick representation. And this is a map of 2022. So hopefully Manisha will be able to share with us if there's any changes that is being seen to this map for 2023. Again, a little bit of representation. So look at that. It's on a fingertip. So we're looking at the larvae brand new and then we as it matures to the nymph with a blood meal and then it matures to the adult.\n\nSo this is an adult male and this is an adult female. So you can see the representative size of the tick.\n\nAgain, another photograph just to show you the representative size. So you see, again, just close to the fingernail how tiny that could be and not easy to spot when you've traveled through or gone out into the woods or into wooded areas to come back and to try to identify that, to take a bit of a heavy searching to be able to see it.\n\nI just wanted to go back if I can go back just a little bit to our little map, just to share a little bit. And I know Manisha will go into that a little bit more. So tick dragging is what is done by Ontario Health units and it's also by Ottawa, by the University of Ottawa, typically by the health units, mostly where they are.\n\nWhat's done is, you know, a tick drag involves literally dragging a three foot square cloth through grasses, and leafy wooded area to find ticks that would be attached to the cloth. And then that tick or those ticks are analyzed to be able to determine if it is, in fact, the tick that would carry Lyme disease. That is a little bit of background information on how that was done.\n\nSo how do you know that you have symptoms or you have an exposure to a tick? Typically, the the bull's eye is the most identifiable means of knowing that you have been exposed to a tick. And and you'll see that as the tick has consumed the blood meal, you'll see that the bullseye grows. It can grow as big as 30 centimeters across and would show up within three days to one month after exposure.\n\nThere are other ways as well. It's not always a bullseye. You might see a nonspecific, itchy, blotchy rash that would appear. You might also see a band across the leg or the arm as another way to indicate that you've had an exposure to a tick bite. Take on a little... Okay preventing Lyme disease. So getting just into what the messaging typically is across all provinces or all across the province of Ontario and across the health unit, the best prevention for Lyme disease is is to not be either not go into those habitat, which as Amy has already indicated, sometimes it's it's what you need to do, get out into nature and you might end up in the forest or the high grass. But we always suggest that you stick on a path where it's the brush has been cleared. That is one of the prevention methods. We also suggest the use of DEET as well. Sorry about my cursor. The use of DEET or icaridin as an insect repellent that you would be able to use, spraying this on your clothing, spraying it on your skin.\n\nAlso, when you are out, suggestion is to make sure that you wear long sleeves, long sleeved shirts, long sleeve pants, socks, your pants tucked into your socks. And again, you're spraying your clothing and you're also spraying any any bare skin as well as a prevention. Another thing to prevent Lyme disease is when you have come out of the brush or come out from your walk is to make sure that you check your clothing, check your skin check as well.\n\nIf you are out with your family pets to check as well to make sure that there are no no ticks on them. Again, the messaging also is that you may be out in the brush, you may be out in the community, but not all ticks are carrying Lyme disease. Not all ticks are carrying the bacteria that would cause you to get Lyme disease.\n\nSo but the best way to prevent is to make sure that you remove all ticks from your body and checking after you've been out in these areas. There is a correct way to remove a tick if you do find one on your body and this picture is quite clear, it's you would use a pointed tweezer, you'd use a pointed tweezer, you would grab the tick at the head and as close as possible to the skin, remove it in a steady motion.\n\nNo wriggling, no twisting or turning, pulling upwards in a direct and slow motion is the best way to remove a tick. And again, just a reminder. Check everyone. Check heads, armpits, scalp, back of the legs, groin area. I just want to remind everyone that the messaging from public health is available on the Ottawa Public Health website. You can see it here.\n\nOttawa Public Health. There is a specific Lyme disease page with lots of additional information as well as to how to prevent, how Lyme disease does come about. A little bit of history as well, and also how to protect yourself. Additional messaging that we'd like to share is, you know, look at yourself, check yourself in the mirror. That's another way to be able to see the ticks although they are that small.\n\nBut just looking at yourself in the mirror, you'll be able to see a little bit better than just scanning your body on your own. Better if actually someone does it for you. But if you're not able to get someone, that is another means that you can do that. Showering is another way to get tick removal as quickly as possible.\n\nAnother thing that we also speak to in terms of prevention is the clothes that you were wearing when you were out and about, not washing them first, but putting them into the dryer before they're actually washed so that at an elevated temperature so that they would for 30 minutes and that will help to kill and remove any ticks that would be on your clothing.\n\nAnother suggestion, if you happen to be living in a wooded area so you'll be able to do a create either by stone or by using wood chips, a 12 to 18 inch border around your home. And that will also help to prevention measures for ticks being directly exposed to your property.\n\nSo again, know there is nothing that can guarantee getting rid of ticks, but keeping your grass in your yard mowed short, using the woodchip gravel or river stone border, keeping tall grass areas separate from your lawn, removing brush, fallen leaves from your property, cleaning up areas around bird feeders so that you don't encourage or attractive small critters or mice to your property that could be carrying ticks and also of discouraging deer because we know that the ticks do feed on deer as well.\n\nSo removing or discouraging deer from your property as well as another way, other things, if you do keep a woodpile, it's an opportunity for you to keep your wood piled so it doesn't attract small rodents and small animals to hibernate there, which may be carrying ticks, and that isLy some of the information that we tend to share with respect to Lyme disease from public health messaging, from a public health messaging perspective.\n\nAgain, for more information, you can always go to Ottawa Public Health dot ca and I will be happy to take questions at the end after Manisha has presented. I will stop sharing from there. Thank you very much, Alison. And we do have a question that came in in the chat which I will present to you at the end of the presentation portion of the evening's event.\n\nAnd here we go. Over to you, Dr. Kulkarni. Great. Thank you very much and pleasure to be here tonight and to be following Alison's talk from public health. So there may be a little bit of repetition in terms of some of the content that I'll present today. But I really wanted to highlight some of the the research that we're doing here at the University of Ottawa.\n\nSo I'm an associate professor in the School of Epidemiology and Public Health. I am a medical entomologist and epidemiologist and do a number of different studies in the Ottawa area and eastern Ontario and across Canada on ticks and Lyme disease. So as Alison mentioned, there are many different tick species in the province, province of Ontario. Some of the two most common ones are Ixodes scapularis.\n\nThe blacklegged tick. But also the wood tick Dermacentor variabilis. And there are also many other species actually there are groundhog ticks, rabbit ticks. So quite a diversity of tick species. Although the blacklegged tick in the Ottawa area is the predominant tick species that we're seeing, and it is the vector for Lyme disease. So this is the tick that can transmit Borrelia burgdorferi mainly found in these deciduous or mixed forest habitats because of the presence of available and suitable hosts in these areas.\n\nSo white tailed deer and small mammals. Important to note in terms of how ticks can find their hosts. They don't fly or jump and they find their host by questing. And I'll show a picture of that in a bit later. So the similar picture here to what you saw of the different stages on the fingers of the the larva, nymph, male and female adult ticks.\n\nBut after they have been attached to their host for a while, they become engorged and they can expand quite grotesquely actually to become quite large. So Lyme disease, the transmission cycle involves this two year lifecycle of the tick. And as Alison mentioned, there are rodent and small mammal intermediate hosts. The highest risk for human infection with Lyme disease is actually in the late spring and summer months.\n\nSo if you see the life cycle here, the eggs will be laid shortly by any overwintering adults that were able to mate. They will hatch into larvae by usually by August, September, we're seeing the larvae come out. Now these are not infected, so they're not a risk to humans, but they will if they find a small animal host that's infected, pick up the infection.\n\nAnd when they molt into nymphs the next spring, they'll be able to transmit that infection to their next host. So this is when the nymphs become active in Ottawa, usually by mid-June. And they're active until late July. Of course, they can be active later in the season. If they haven't found a host, they can even be active earlier in the season if they haven't managed to find a host at all that year and have had to go into the next year.\n\nBut typically we're really mostly concerned about this late spring and summer period for Lyme disease transmission. The adults as well can transmit Lyme disease. They're most active in the early spring and in the fall. So people that are active in the woods at this time of year are also at risk, although it is much easier to see and remove an adult because of their larger size.\n\nSo it tends to be why the the nymphs are most responsible for infections. So here we see the blacklegged tick questing. So they raise their forelegs in the in the air, wave them around so they can sense heat, carbon dioxide coming from their host. As a host brushes by, typically something with fur, it would grab hold and then be able to crawl around and find a spot to take a blood meal.\n\nSo when we're doing our tick drags, the flannel sheet that we're dragging kind of simulates that that host passing by. The mice, chipmunks, small birds can also serve as the host for ticks and the reservoir for the bacterium. So it's important to note that these animals are particularly implicated in the transmission cycle. And then the white tailed deer are the essential hosts for adult ticks.\n\nSo we do need to have deer, a good deer population in an area to sustain a tick population. So that's another reason why these woodland habitats are really the areas where we are finding the most highest abundance of ticks. So a little bit about some of our research projects. I'll talk a bit about the trends in eastern Ontario just to follow on some of the the information that Alison provided and then talk about our research projects.\n\nSo some of the research that we're doing at the University of Ottawa is to identify risk factors for for Lyme disease and other tick borne diseases. And so we're doing things like studying tick ecology, we're studying pathogen dynamics with between the reservoirs and the ticks. And we're also looking at risk factors for human exposure. So as you heard, Lyme disease can have different stages of infection.\n\nThe first stage is typically an erythema migrans rash or a bull's eye rash, but it's actually not necessarily occurring in everybody who has been bitten by a tick that's infected with Borrelia burgdorferi does depend a little bit on the genetic diversity and strain of the bacterium in terms of its capacity for dissemination, and it depends on where the tick bite is as well.\n\nSo if it's in the on the scalp or the hairline, often it's not seen. So also important to keep an eye out for other symptoms like fever, headache, joint symptoms, especially in the summertime when these are less likely to be things like influenza. If it's not treated, it can go on to disseminate, causing multiple rashes, but also other symptoms related to neurological and cardiac and arthritis complications.\n\nSo very important to to detect and remove those ticks early. So why is Lyme disease emerging in Canada? Well, we do have with climate change warming temperatures that are permitting the expansion of the geographic range of tick vectors. So the maps you see on the right are the areas where blacklegged ticks are found in the United States, mostly along the East Coast and in the Midwest, there are different types of populations.\n\nBut with warming temperatures, more parts of Canada are conducive for tick population establishment. So the warmer winters are permitting survival of ticks over the winter. And the longer season of of warm weather is permitting ticks more time to be able to find a host and perpetuate their life cycle. We're also seeing northward transport of ticks by migratory birds.\n\nSo in the spring, as birds are coming up north from parts of the United States and even southern parts of Ontario now where ticks are established, they're being dropped off further and further north. And if they land in a place where there is suitable habitat and suitable hosts, they can start a new population. With climate change and other types of land use, land cover changes, we're also seeing expand an expanding ranges of host populations like white footed mice and white tailed deer.\n\nAnd this is also related to things like habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, which are aggravating and exacerbating some of the patterns that we're seeing. So this is the map that we saw before from Public Health Ontario. This is a map that they put out annually based on tick dragging that's done in the different areas. So these are areas that they estimate risk has occurred in eastern Ontario and in Ottawa particularly, we're doing more intensive work to try to get a bit more detail within this yellow region.\n\nSo looking at the trends in Lyme disease incidence and reported cases, this is a publication from 2018, so it shows the trend up to 2017. But you can see there is a, you know, almost a doubling of cases between 2015 and 2017. The areas in the map on the right, you can see the darker health units are those that have the highest Lyme disease incidence in the province and they tend to be in eastern Ontario.\n\nAnd this is because of the the really high amount of woodland habitat and the proximity to the United States with its tick populations. If we look a bit closer at data from Ontario and this goes up to 2021, so we can see it was up to almost 1000 reported cases in 2017, and that's gone up even further in 2021.\n\nSo we're seeing a I guess, a variation year to year, but a growing trend in terms of human Lyme disease cases. So it's becoming quite a concern and an important area of research. In Ottawa, these are some of the data from Ottawa Public Health that you can find on their website. Again, you can see we had a big year in 2017, some year to year fluctuations, but overall we've seen an increasing trend in Ottawa as well.\n\nSo looking at local tick research, so my lab, the INSIGHT lab at the University of Ottawa, conducts a number of different projects and I'm just going to go through a few of them that focus on ticks and Lyme disease. So one of our first initial projects was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada, looking at monitoring tick populations really to develop a baseline for where ticks could be found within the Ottawa region.\n\nSo we had about 30 sentinel sites that we conducted surveillance in the spring and fall of every year from 2017 to 2020. And we looked at where ticks were, how many were infected, what species we found. We did the drag sampling as was described. So using the one meter square flannel, our team, you may see some of them out.\n\nWe do a number of different sites for tick dragging every year, so you might see them out in their white Tyvek suits. If you do, say hi, they're just collecting ticks and we bring them back to our lab, do some species identification, and then we do some nucleic acid extraction and qPCR in order to detect genetic markers of different tickborne pathogens.\n\nSo we do a screening test that looks for Borrelia, all different Borrelia species, but also Anaplasma. If it is positive, then we do a confirmatory test to look at which species of Borrelia we're finding, whether it's Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease or Borrelia miyamotoi, which is more of a relapsing fever pathogen, not very prevalent in ticks in this region.\n\nAnd then if we have an Anaplasma positive, we confirm it as well. We have other tick borne pathogens we also test for including Babesia and Powassan virus, but I didn't show all of the diagrams here. So looking at some of the results now, it's a bit of a busy slide, but you can see again the map of Ottawa on the right hand side and the different sites where we had sampled over the three years with the circles.\n\nSo the size of the circle indicates the density of ticks that we've been finding. So number of ticks per person-hour of drag sampling. And the areas that had the highest densities of ticks really were in the western parts of Ottawa, particularly along the Ottawa River, but also along the Greenbelt zone. We found the lower tick tick densities and actually didn't detect ticks in the sites in the urban core.\n\nSo these tended to be smaller urban parks, but we did find some tick populations in the south, in the eastern parts of the city as well. In terms of the ticks that were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, these tend to be areas with longer established tick populations and larger tick populations. So again, this mirrored the trends in tick density, with higher tick densities, infection rates in the western part of the city with some emerging areas along the south and east as well.\n\nAnd this is the publication here, if you wanted to get a bit more detail. So what we did as well, as we classified these sites according to the degree of tick establishment, so the density of ticks over time, over consecutive years and we looked at which stages of ticks were being found. So if multiple tick stages were found every year, that's really a good indication that there are established tick populations versus just finding one or two adult ticks, which could be ticks that were transported by wildlife or by migratory birds, which are called adventitious ticks and can actually be found almost anywhere.\n\nSo we identified these \"high-stable\" locations we called them, the red dots where we were classifying that these tick populations were well established and consistent over time. Again, in these areas, mostly in the western parts of Ottawa, a couple of spots in the east, whereas the low non-zero sites were in the center and we had some emerging sites that we continue to monitor.\n\nSo the other thing that we do with the different surveillance data is use the data alongside satellite remote sensing data on climate and land cover in order to develop these spatial predictive models of where tick populations are likely to be found. So we do this. This is an ecological model of predicted habitat suitability across the southern part of Ontario for Ixodes scapularis, developed by one of my PhD students.\n\nAndrea Slatculescu and you can see again the high suitability of tick habitat in eastern Ontario with the wooded areas, but also some along Georgian Bay, the Algonquin Highlands region and along the Great Lakes regions as well. As well, we looked at the data in comparison to human Lyme disease incidence in the region to identify some risk factors.\n\nAnd we found that higher Lyme disease incidence was found in areas that were more rural, that had greater ticks in the environment, not surprisingly, had a lower population density and higher proportions of treed land and typically higher socioeconomic status based on different metrics that we were using. So I wanted to share some more results from the city of Ottawa, one of our projects called the UPTick Project, and I'll share some of our phase one results with you.\n\nSo this is a project that was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada's Infectious Disease and Climate Change Fund. And we just wrapped up phase one last month actually, called Best Practices for Urban Planning in the context of climate change in emerging tick borne diseases. So this is a study that we focused on four neighbourhoods in the western part of Ottawa.\n\nSo Kanata North, Kanata South, Stittsville and Carp Hill, Carp Village. In each neighbourhood, we divided the the neighbourhood into three different zones. So a woodland zone, an interface interface zone and a residential zone. So you can see typically woodland zone, you know, on the border, the margins of the neighbourhood where there are trails going into the woods, the interface zone where the residential properties are bordering on woodland habitat and residential pathways and trails where there tends not to be any dense forest.\n\nSo what we did is we sampled all of these areas for ticks, we sampled for mice, and we did use trail cameras to see what the occupancy and intensity of use by deer was in these different areas. So we did tick surveillance using drag sampling. We did this every month in 2020 and every two weeks in 2021, just to get a good idea of the tick populations, wildlife host sampling in the July period when ticks or sorry not ticks but mice are most active.\n\nWe collected ear punches and took those back to the lab to test them for the pathogens, and the deer surveillance using trail cameras. Again, similar methods took the samples back to the lab, extracted DNA and tested for different pathogens. So if we look at the density of ticks, we did find black legged ticks in all four study neighbourhoods.\n\nIn 2020. We had the greatest densities in in the Kanata region, similar in 2021. If we look at a graph, so this is showing the total number of Borrelia bergdorferi positive and red and negative ticks in these three different zones within the four neighbourhoods combined. So in the Woodland Zone we found the highest density of ticks overall and we found the highest proportion of them infected.\n\nSo about 30% of ticks in these woodland zones were infected. We did, however, find a significant number of ticks compared to the residential zone, significantly higher number of ticks in the interface zone with a fairly high about 20 to 23% infection rate of these ticks as well. Within the residential zones themselves, we found, I think two ticks. One was actually infected, so it could have been carried in from a small mammal or something.\n\nSo it means that the the risk in these areas is not negligible, but it's very, very very low, about 20 times lower than the interface and about 40 times lower than the woodland areas. We also did the same for mice. What was interesting is that the highest densities of mice were actually in the residential zones. It's actually tended not to be the white footed mice that are the main reservoirs for Lyme disease, but deer mice and but we also did find quite healthy mouse populations in the interface and woodland zones.\n\nBut really the infected mice were concentrated in these woodland and interface zones. So all in all, it tells us really that this enzootic transmission, so transmission of the pathogen between the mice and the ticks is happening in these interface and woodland zones. We did a pilot in 2022 in Blackburn Hamlet, and so this is a neighbourhood in the eastern part of Ottawa where we're looking to expand for our phase two of the project.\n\nAnd we also detected positive mice in this region. So we know that there's transmission ongoing in the environment. So the key takeaways for this project are really that well, first of all, we're doing more analysis to identify some of the specific factors linked with Lyme disease, environmental risk. And our results are showing that Lyme disease transmission between ticks and mice is mainly occurring in the woodland and interface zones within these neighbourhoods, and that trails and pathways in these zones can pose a risk of of Lyme disease exposure to people that are, you know, going for a walk, walking their dog.\n\nIf your property is in this interface zone and backs onto woodland, then it could be an area where infected ticks could be found. So really important to adopt preventive behaviours when entering into tick habitat in these regions, even when it's, you know, really close to your your your neighbourhood and your home, doesn't have to be far away.\n\nWe did cover some information on Lyme disease prevention. So I'll just go over this quickly. We are doing another project called the Greenbelt Tick Study. This is funded by the the NCC and we're actually trying different interventions to reduce the density of of ticks on residential trails in the in the Greenbelt zone. So some of the interventions that we're trying you can see here is the woodchip borders, as Alison described, and we've actually found very good effectiveness of using these woodchip borders. We're also trying the wood chips that are going to be treated with an icaricide so deltamethrin or a garlic spray to see if that increases the longevity and the effectiveness of the intervention as well. So just to reiterate, to prevent a tick bite, it's really important to try to wear long pants and clothing, if you can, to cover exposed skin, if possible, stay on the trails when hiking in the woods or walking in long grass, applying a an approved repellent containing DEET or icaridin also potentially you can wear now you can purchase permethrin treated clothing from different manufacturers in Canada.\n\n]So this is a really good product that you can use to repel and to kill ticks that are trying to crawl on your skin. The full body tick check on yourself and your pets when you get back from a hike in the woods and removing ticks as quickly as possible, and then again to reduce ticks around your home.\n\nKeeping the grass short. The reason for that, of course, ticks really they dry out really quickly. So they really need a moist habitat in order to avoid desiccating. So by keeping the grass short, they don't have anywhere to go. And they they will dry out much more quickly. Removing that brush and fallen leaves, cleaning up under your bird feeders, discouraging deer from entering your yard and using the the border.\n\nSo just to conclude that, you know, our research in Ottawa has identified tick populations. Sorry, my voice held out just to the last minute there. And we're using research to identify risk areas, to identify determinants, and really to try to inform targeted disease control and surveillance efforts. So I'd like to just thank everyone from my lab, my team members, as well as our collaborators including Ottawa Public Health, the NCC, Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you very much, Dr. Kulkarni. And thanks also to Alison. We do have about six questions that have come in during the presentation in the chat. So again, I'll ask people if they want to ask a question live to go ahead and raise their virtual hand. Look for that raise hand icon down at the bottom of your Zoom screen.\n\nBut in the meantime, we will get started with some of the questions from the chat. Question number one: are the bullseye and band lesions or the rashes itchy? I can answer that question so they can be itchy. They are definitely known to be itchy, but they can also not be known to be itchy, just it depends. So it varies case to case.\n\nOkay. Okay. We also have another question here is: can you get Lyme disease from touching the tick? And what about the tweezers that you use to remove the tick? So what sort of contamination risk is there from that? Manisha, do you want to take that one? So so for for transmission to occur, really the tick has to attach, the the bacteria's found in its gut and so it actually needs time for that bacterium to transmit up to its salivary glands and be injected into the skin.\n\nThat said, after you've removed a tick, it's really important to wash the area with soap and water and wash your hands really well. You can use rubbing alcohol on the tweezers, etc. to avoid contamination for sure. So is important to be careful during tick removal or handling ticks after you've taken them off. Okay. Thank you very much. I'm going to invite Iola to ask her question because I see she has her hand up and then we'll go back to questions from the chat.\n\nI have two questions. Can you. Can you hear me? Yes, we can Iola. I have two questions? First, I'd like a little bit more information about Powassan disease. But secondly, I work controlling invasive plants in one of the urban natural areas, and I'd like to know whether there has been any tick dragging with the sheet through that area.\n\nIt looked as though it might have been. Who do I contact to find that out? That you, Amy? Can I find out from you or you can ask? You can ask. You can look at our publications or you can ask and I'll let you know if it's one of our surveillance sites. In terms of Powassan, we haven't detected Powassan in any of the ticks in Ottawa right now.\n\nThere are two lineages of Powassan virus, the deer tick virus lineage transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, but the lineage one is actually transmitted by a different species, the groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei. And so it's a really a very low prevalence, but it is present and it's increasing in the United States in terms of its prevalence. So it is something that definitely need to be the lookout for here in Ontario as well.\n\nYeah, I'm not sure I have access to PLOS. PLOS one is open access. So you should be able to access it and see and see the map. And the table will list all of the different sites as well. Thank you. I will do that. Thank you. Iola. Okay. We'll go back to the chat and say, someone wants to know why is DEET recommended?\n\nIsn't it bad for our health and the environment? DEET is Health Canada approved. The testing has been done to confirm at least a 30% is acceptable for human exposure. So that testing has to at least confirm its use as long as it's being properly used by the directions and the manufacturer's instructions. And it is effective. And it is effective as a deterrent.\n\nSo yeah, yeah. Now obviously for for those of us who like to go out and look for other types of animals in the woods, if you like frogs or if your children like frogs and a lot of kids do, I will just say if you've got DEET on or really any other sorts of chemicals like, you know, even sunscreen may not be a good thing to be touching amphibians and other small creatures if you have those sorts of chemicals on your skin just because, you know, especially for frogs and other amphibians, they do have very permeable skin and they are sensitive to those sorts of products.\n\nSo if you've got all of your protective coatings on, then please don't touch the wildlife. So we'll go on. Someone was asking if we could see the bullseye photo of a tick bite again? I believe those are posted on the Ottawa Public Health Web page. Allison, is that correct? So, Alison, you're on mute now. Yes, they are. But I can show it again if you would like.\n\nOkay. We'll give you a moment to pull that up. In the meantime, you know, does the time of day affect the numbers of ticks out and about? That is a great question. And yes. Yes, it does. Not necessarily the time of day specifically, but the temperature and the humidity. So ticks tend to be more active in the cooler kind of early morning hours and late evening hours in the heat of the day.\n\nWell, in the summertime, when it is actually hot and sunny, they tend to go back down into the leaf litter litter to avoid drying out. So the times that you would be more likely to encounter ticks and the times that we actually go tick dragging are in the morning hours or in the late evening hours. That's when your best, best chances of catching ticks, if you want to do that or if you want to avoid them, then those would be the times to avoid.\n\nOkay, excellent. I do see we have another live question, so I'm just going to switch over and ask Lindsay to unmute and go ahead. Just the question I've had two tick bites in the Ottawa area and been diagnosed with early Lyme once, but luckily it was caught early and antibiotics helped. But from my experience both times I had symptoms after being bit for less than 12 hours and I know the common information being put out there is that you would have to have a tick attach for at least 24 hours in order to have any transmission of pathogens.\n\nI'm just curious if like that common sort of information has been changed and, you know, after any amount of time a tick's been attached, if it's possible or, you know, just curious about that information, because it seemed to be that it had to be attached for 24 hours. But from my experience and the stories of other people I've heard, it's been it can be transmitted in less than 24. Certainly the latest kind of systematic reviews that have looked at transmission and based largely on laboratory data, but also on epidemiological data have shown that really the probability of transmission below 24 hours is is much lower than after 24 hours and after 48 hours. So the probability of transmission increases with duration of attachment. Certainly as soon as a tick is attached, you can have, you know, an allergic reaction, a skin reaction that's not necessarily a bullseye rash. It does take time for the Lyme disease bacterium, for example, to to get up to the salivary glands and actually be injected into the skin.\n\nBut it's important to note there are other tick borne pathogens that can transmit almost immediately. They don't require that that additional time. So even, you know, it's very important to remove ticks early. So Anaplasmosis is a pathogen that's transmitted by the same ticks that's increasing in prevalence in the region. So and it can transmit quite quickly and Powassan virus as well can transmit quite quickly.\n\nSo it's really important to to get those ticks removed quite early. Thank you. Just another couple of related questions from the chat about Permethrin treated clothing. One person wants to know how effective is that? I know Dr. Kulkarni did mention it in their presentation. So someone want to know how effective is that clothing and someone else wants to know what the name of the clothing is.\n\nSo they're looking for brand names, I guess. Sure, I can comment on that. In terms of effectiveness, I mean, obviously it depends on how the user is wearing it and consistency of use, but very, very effective in terms of both repelling ticks, but also killing ticks on on contact, mosquitoes as well. So it's been used as an intervention by the Canadian military, for example, for for a number of years, but only just recently approved for commercial use and commercial retail in Canada.\n\nThe manufacturer that I'm aware of in Canada, it goes by the brand No Fly Zone. So Marks Work Warehouse. You can buy it there. I think I've seen it at other other kind of camping stores as well. So good to keep an eye out for. You can also get hats, jackets and things and that's useful for for repelling ticks and mosquitoes. And even comes in a few extra colors now.\n\nSo I picked up some stuff last year. It's been quite good. They do advise, though, that it does wear off after a while. You know, there's a limited number of washes you can do in terms of, you know, how many times you can run it through the laundry before you're going to wear out the permethrin. So great. I'm going to ask Jackie to unmute themselves and go ahead with your question.\n\nYeah, hi there. So I recently removed a tick from myself and did get the antibiotics to take care of that. But I was wondering in regards to Lyme disease, even with the treatment of the antibiotics, is it possible for the Lyme disease or other things concerning things to show up, even after the antibiotics have been taken? I'm not a clinician, so I can't comment on that.\n\nIn as a as an expert, certainly the normal dose that's given for early infection does tend to be quite effective. Also, obviously good to speak with your health care provider about that. If there are any other concerns. Doxycycline that's prescribed for Lyme disease is also usually what's prescribed for Anaplasmosis as a bacterial infection, so can also be useful for that.\n\nBut it's best to speak to health care providers about about your particular situation and dosage and duration of treatment. And if I could just add to that as well Manisha, it also depends on your own health. So if you are already immunocompromised or there's other things going on. So again, we're not clinicians, but it would be important to speak to your clinician with respect to dosage.\n\nOkay, excellent. Thank you very much. Okay. Quick question from the chat and then we'll go to Lorna after this. So how often do ticks need a blood meal? Oh, you're you're muted, Allison. Did you want to take that one? Oh, I was hoping that you would. Okay. So they, they just take a meal typically once every life stage.\n\nSo when they go from larvae to nymphs and then from nymph to adult, and then the adult takes a blood meal for its last feed before it finds a mate and starts anew a new batch of ticks. So just three times for the blacklegged ticks. Now there is some anecdotal evidence of ticks, you know, taking a partial blood meal and falling off and then finding a new host, but it's not widely observed.\n\nSo typically they do remain attached to one host and they're able to complete a blood meal, unless they're chipmunks tend to be a bit not as great hosts. They tend to groom a lot and take the ticks off, whereas the mice for some reason are not as good at grooming and that's why they tend to have more tick infestation rates.\n\nOkay, So good grooming is very important, obviously. All right. I'm going to ask Lorna to unmute and go ahead with your question. Hello. I was wondering if you're walking like on the NCC trail, how much of your body should you treat with the like DEET product, like from the knees down or the waist down, or do you have to spray your whole body? In terms of, you know, risk of brushing by a questing tick, you know, up to a meter is possible.\n\nBut typically within, you know, within one foot from the ground really depends on what type of vegetation there is. So good idea to spray all of your clothing, really, but particularly concentrating on the waist down. Thank you. Good. And let's just see here. Yeah. Is there still work underway on the Lyme disease vaccination? It's a question of great interest among some of my colleagues who work outdoors a lot.\n\nSo there there is. So I don't know, Alison, if you have news on this, but there's a new trial going on right now for a multi strain Lyme disease vaccine for people. So it would work both in Europe and in North America. So there's a lot of hope that that will be effective and safe and etc., and that will take a number of years for it to probably be approved and reach the stage where where we can access it widely.\n\nBut it definitely is an area of active research. Okay. Thank you. I'm going to ask Enid to unmute and ask your question. So what I'm wondering is it's is it possible, maybe not the black legged tick, but some tick? My dog got this skin bacterial skin infection and the vet doesn't know where it came from. And she roots in.\n\nRight. She likes to smell and root and with with the all the like the dead leaves and stuff down by the river. I'm just wondering if do you think that a bite from a tick could have caused or some interaction with a tick could have caused this sort of crusting and and skin infection, which is being treated by back by by an antibiotic?\n\nI'm just curious because nobody seems to know where this came from. And it's right in like right on her nose where she would be digging in? I don't I don't have the expertise to comment on the veterinary kind of issues, but all I can really say is potentially, you know, any kind of rooting around in leaf litter is where you might be able to encounter ticks.\n\nAnd, you know, ticks do have a, you know, ability to to find dogs and to to attach for quite a long time. So good idea to to always use tick preventative treatment on your pets as well as doing tick checks on them as well, but can't really comment on the specifics of of your of your pet. Okay, thank you. Allison\n\nAnything to add on that? I don't think Ottawa Public Health really covers veterinary medicine either. Oh, we we don't, I was just going to second what Manisha had said, it would be appropriate to connect with the vet to see what if they do test or what kind of results that they get from some testing, even just on the skin.\n\nYeah. Just to see what kind of bacteria it is. Yeah. I think that a good detection method to identify bacteria, they're okay. So here's a here's a question from the chat. Can one use a lit cigarette to remove a tick? And I know this is an old folk remedy type approach, but I don't think it's recommended for many reasons now.\n\nBut I'll let I'll let our experts weigh in. Yeah I'll I'll take that one. So it's actually can do more harm than good because any kind of shock to the tick whether it's squeezing it, covering it in Vaseline, burning it can actually cause it to regurgitate the contents of its gut into you even more quickly. So it may actually cause greater transmission.\n\nSo that's why it's really important to try to just pull right from the mouth parts and remove the whole tick without trying to crush it or twist it or otherwise kind of kill it. Yeah, because I know that dab of Vaseline or butter and things were other remedies that folks are used to recommend, if you just needed to, you know, remove a tick.\n\nBut in the case where the tick may be carrying, you know harmful. Yeah. Or you can also this is my handy there you go, Ottawa Public Health tick key. So these are quite good, good for really removing the the bigger adult ticks, the nymphs it's still really good if you have some fine-nosed tweezers to really get close to the skin and pull out those ticks.\n\nYep. Manisha you're so lucky, we don't have we don't have those anymore. So yeah, I think Ann gave this to me a number of years ago, so I'm glad I still have it. Sold out. I haven't lost that, that'll fetch you a pretty penny. We don't offer them anymore, so hang on to that one.\n\nFor sure. That's a valuable souvenir. All right, I'm going to ask Pam to unmute and ask a question. Hi. Those tick keys, you can actually get at Lee Valley. So if anybody's looking for them, they have them. I guess I was misinformed that I was thinking that it was only adults that would bite humans. So from what I'm hearing, the nymphs can also bite.\n\nHow big would they get when they're engorged? Because my neighbour had a couple of adults bite and they were like a small grape. They were huge on her dog, but a nymph, when it's engorged, how big would it get? So an engorged nymph, I would probably give it about five millimeters, less than a centimeter when it's engorged. But they don't stay on quite as long as an adult because they don't have as much room to engorge.\n\nBut they're still unfortunately, by the time you notice a nymph, it probably has been on for a couple of days because they are so small. So in addition to doing that tick check, it's really good to you know, actually, you can often feel it better than you can see it. So if you feel something that's attached to the skin, it's easier to to get to it quickly.\n\nOkay. I've had adults running like I'll feel them running on my arms or whatever, so they quickly get disposed of. But yeah, I wasn't aware of the nymphs. Thank you. And the nymphs are the greater risk, I would say to the adults for sure, because you don't, you don't really see them right away. So yeah, they're, they're a lot harder to notice.\n\nI've had recommended to me and I've actually tried it myself too, to use those sticky lint rollers when you come out of the bush and you, you know, you know, you might have been exposed to some some little ticks that the those little sticky lint rollers actually do a great job of, you know, pulling them off your clothes.\n\nYeah I should have mentioned that. So we our team wears full Tyvek suits with duct tape around our ankles. And then once we take off the suit, everybody uses a lint roller on their clothing underneath. And so there are multiple stages of just making sure that those ticks don't hitch a ride home with you. Yeah. Excellent. Okay. I'm going to ask Pam to unmute and ask their question and we'll go back to the chat for another couple.\n\nI already asked you thanks. Oh, there we go, we just need to lower that hand, then. Excellent. So we'll go to Caroline. Can you hear me? We can. Okay. My question is, how long can you detect if there was Lyme after there's been a tick in a dog? Is that can anybody answer that or how long it takes? In term in terms of the transmission of the pathogen itself, or in terms of detecting it with the test? Detecting, like if the dog has Lyme contracted Lyme.\n\nSo the early stages, because it's mostly relies on clinical symptoms for diagnosis, both in humans and in pets, the tests that we have available right now for diagnosis rely on serology so antibody detection so that usually it's a they work best after about a month post-infection. But there are like for humans looking at the rash and the other clinical symptoms are ways of doing an earlier diagnosis.\n\nOkay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Someone in the chat wanted to know what are the possible side effects of using DEET frequently? What are the positive side effects? Possible. Sorry, possible side effects. I would say I don't have the any health care data at this point, but from what I understand is as long as you're following the directions, there should be no side effects.\n\nOnly if you're following the instructions by the manufacturer you should be able to not have any adverse effect or adverse exposure. Now, I mean, I suppose it's possible some people might be sensitive to the the chemical might, might have some sensitivities that would result in some side effects of that nature. But yeah, generally, I mean, I used to use DEET on a daily basis through the field seasons when I was, you know, starting my career.\n\nYeah. Still here. Still. Yeah. And you can also use icaridin, sometimes called picaridin, which has a bit less. It doesn't kind of melt plastic like DEET does, I have found DEET sometimes can you know, melt textiles or plastics. And it can also leave your skin a bit dry. But icaridin doesn't have similar types of effects.\n\nSo you can also look to those products too. I mean, personally, I do try to put it on my clothing and, you know, use the long sleeves and long pants to reduce the amount of exposed skin so that I'm not putting it on myself. But that's also because I do actually like to pick up frogs and things when I go out.\n\nSo I try to keep my hands clean. Yeah, just personal note there. Lindsey, I'm going to ask you to unmute and ask your question and we'll go back to the chat. So just curious again too for most of us in Ottawa, this is and I think across the province, it's a newer annoyance and problem. Some people I know who've lived in the area for a while said over the last five years, is when they've really noticed this issue.\n\nSo for, you know, when I was a kid I was rolling in leaf piles, going out in the forest. I had shorts on, t shirts. We never did tick checks and it was never a concern. And so just thinking about raising kids now in Ottawa, working in the outdoors and spending time in the outdoors, it's obviously a bit of an inconvenience.\n\nAnd someone just pointed out to me recently that there's places like where it was found in the states that Lyme disease was first discovered, people have been living with this for years and years and years. So I'm just curious if any of our experts here happen to know, like what are the strategies that people have picked up too? Like, is it just all the things that we talked about today?\n\nOr are people using a lot of pesticide chemicals, spraying their yards or they've just learned to live with this problem? I mean, I can certainly speak to research that's been done both in the United States and in Europe, where they've had a tick populations and Lyme disease transmission for for a very long time. And the population does tend to adapt, as you said, to learn to live with them both through the use of personal protective measures\n\nSo really automatically doing the types of the tick checks, wearing the protective clothing, staying on the trails, in some other jurisdictions, not in Canada, there is you can or people do spray pesticides on their properties more readily. So there is that in some areas. I think in Canada, our regulations are a bit different in terms of environmental protection. And so there's not as much of a a a willingness to do that.\n\nSo emphasizing protective measures, using those landscape management techniques to reduce risk around your residential property are really the main strategies that people do tend to as they become aware of the issues, learn to learn to cope. I think it's really important to be able to know where areas are more kind of tick safe versus tick risky. So, you know, if you have a big maple tree in your yard and you're in a, you know, not in a big forested area, if you're in a you know in the city, you're very unlikely to have ticks in that leaf pile that your your child is jumping in compared to if you're in an area that has is bordering large\n\nTracts of woodland etc., where you have deer populations frequently visiting. So you can kind of assess your level of risk based on where you are as well. But I think it's really important not to avoid, you know, enjoying nature, but just being aware of the risks that are out there and making sure that you're doing it safely. Coincidentally, the next question in the chat is about property treatment, because we do have, you know, companies now offering to fog people's properties to control mosquitoes.\n\nAnd they're also claiming that this will help protect people from ticks. You know, so so the question is, do you do you think that these companies that treat your properties for mosquitoes and ticks, do you think it works? And yeah, I have some concerns over the potential environmental impacts of that. But yeah, you go ahead and address. So so our our Greenbelt tick study that we're doing with the NCC is aiming to determine exactly that, is so we're not spraying the pesticides.\n\nSo we're using a biological control which is a garlic spray derivative and then deltamethrin but we're treating woodchips. So it's very targeted. So looking to see how effective that is. Natural products, similar garlic spray, there's newtketone, there are a couple of other natural products that have been tested and developed and to reduce tick populations, it tends to be that they can be effective, but their efficacy diminishes very quickly, like within a couple of days of application, especially if it rains, then they get washed away quite quickly.\n\nSo they need to be reapplied quite frequently. So it is possible to use those in a targeted area and have lower risk to non-target organisms, things like deltamethrin spray, which I think some commercial operators will do and are authorized to do, have some very potentially harmful effects to non-target organisms, especially aquatic organisms. So there are some very strict regulations on where you can spray it.\n\nSo it's certainly it's not something that should be done widely in vast areas and certainly not in areas with other, you know, pollinator populations or or other types of insects that are important and beneficial. Yeah. And that that would be, you know, our concern from a natural systems standpoint is we if we get, you know, large numbers of people signing up for these services, first of all, we're not convinced of the the effectiveness against mosquitoes since mosquitoes will fly huge distances to, you know, to come and bite people.\n\nSpraying your property is probably not as effective. And Alison may have a few words to say here, too, but it's probably not as effective as just controlling, you know, the the sources of water around your property, making sure that, you know, the the disease carrying mosquitoes particularly don't get opportunities to breed nearby. The nuisance mosquitoes that come from our, you know, wetlands and natural areas and things, they they will travel.\n\nSo even if your if your lawn you know if your yard fogged, then a new batch of mosquitoes will fly in. They'll they'll migrate around looking for meals. And meanwhile, yeah, you may have impacted all of the pollinators and other beneficial insects that also would have used your yard. Yeah. And if I can just add, in terms of tick control and Lyme disease control, there are other types of interventions that target the the wildlife hosts as well.\n\nSo there are a number of different studies looking at rodent targeted interventions. So even like an oral vaccine, but also bait boxes that can treat rodents with an icaricide. So it's very targeted and it can kill the ticks on the mice. So a number of different ways that they could potentially reduce transmission without widespread application of of pesticides. Fascinating.\n\nAlison? I was just going to say 100%, prevention if you prevent the exposure or reduce the exposure, then you reduce the risk. So that that would be the overall message for this evening, whether we're talking about mosquitoes or we're talking about ticks. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We have we have a question from Katherine, aged six. She would like to know, how do you cure Lyme disease?\n\nThat's a big question. And Enidt, I'll just let you know you're next. I'll let the scientist take that one. Speaking as as an entomologist, not a clinician, but certainly you can speak to your doctor and your health care provider and it's typically treated with antibiotics and that's why it's important really to to catch it early so that you don't have to take as much antibiotics and you can have a quicker recovery.\n\nOkay, Enid, I'll ask you to unmute and go ahead with your question. Yeah, it's just a straight simple question. Over the last like three or four or five years, we have had a growing population of rabbits and I wondered if rabbits were carriers. You didn't mention rabbits. That's a good question. I don't think rabbits are great reservoirs for Borrelia and they're not great hosts for deer ticks.\n\nThey tend to go on the smaller mammals. There are rabbit ticks that are different types of ticks, but fortunately do not transmit Lyme disease. But so. So another animal could get bit by one of these ticks, but there wouldn't be any effect from it? So the Haemaphysalis ticks that we see that are the rabbit ticks, they don't they don't carry the Lyme disease pathogen and they don't actually tend to bite people very much either.\n\nBut yeah, not animals like dogs and things. I'm not sure about dogs, but certainly we we catch we get them in our drag sample, but we don't see them through other surveillance, passive surveillance where people are submitting ticks that have been biting them through platforms like E-tick, where you can submit a photo of a tick that you've found, so that those are the ticks that we the two species that I showed at the start, the Dermacentor ticks and Ixodes scapularis tend to be the ones that are most likely to bite people.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Someone's asking about they have wild birds that have built their nests on lamps at the front door, and they're asking, should we remove those nests? There's there's some legal aspects to that one, in terms of risk of tick exposure, ladies, what would you say? Not so much risk of tick exposure that the risk with birds is more the bird feeders and then that attracts the rodents into your yard because they're eating the the seeds.\n\nAnd then you can bring ticks into your yard by that means. So we do have I wouldn't say there's a big risk with nesting birds in your property. Yeah. There there are definitely birds whose nests are protected under federal law. The Migratory Birds Convention Act does regulate and prohibit disturbing or destroying nests of many of our species of birds.\n\nIt's pretty common for for some species to try to set up a nest in really awkward and inappropriate locations, like robins will do this quite a bit. One of the best interventions I've encountered, you know, I was told this by a local resident who had a repeated issue of a robin persistently trying to nest above the front door, and they put a golf ball into the nest and the robin abandoned the nest.\n\nAnd and, you know, my presumption is that they thought perhaps it was a cowbird egg, that their nest was being attacked by a cowbird who wanted them to raise its baby. So that, you know, perhaps perhaps that was why. But it seemed very effective. So the nest was still there above the door, but it had this, you know, fake egg in it, a golf ball egg.\n\nAnd the bird moved away. So that was that was an interesting technique. So if a tick is found, what is the next steps after removal? And the related question we had in the chat was, you know, once once you've removed a tick, like how do you dispose of it? So in terms of next steps, it's a good idea to keep the tick in a little pill vial or you can put it in a little little baggie.\n\nIf you are curious about what species it is, you can take a photo of the tick and you can submit that on the E tick platform and you'll get a response back to say, what species of the tick. So you'll know if there's a risk for different pathogens, for example. You can also take it to your health care provider, the actual tick, so that they may be able to identify it or in some health units, take it to the public health lab.\n\nSo good idea to hold on to it. There isn't, as far as I know, testing of ticks, routine testing of ticks that happens now. But it's a good indicator just by looking at what the species is. Okay. And if you don't remember all of that, it's all listed on the Ottawa Public Health website. There we go. Good resource. Yes. Okay, Ron, I'm going to ask you to unmute and ask your question. While Ron finds the unmute button.\n\nI just want to add once the tick has been identified, you can dispose of it either to make sure it's in a closed container and that it's discarded in the garbage. You can also flush it directly down the toilet as well as a way to discard the tick. Part of the recommendation as well as is to keep it 30 days if you are verifying for either symptoms or going to see a physician.\n\nSo again, this information is also on the website. So you don't have to remember all of that. Okay, go ahead, Ron. I can't quite hear you. Ron, you should be unmuted. I'm still not hearing anything, though, unfortunately. Maybe he can type in the chat and yeah, if Ron wants to type his question and send it to us, we'll we'll try to get to it.\n\nBut unfortunately we're not hearing anything. So Lindsey, I'm going to ask you to unmute and go ahead with your question. Hi. This is actually Christine watching here with Lindsey and I'm just curious about the status of potential Lyme vaccine in Canada coming to Canada. I, you know, jokingly asked my vet one time, you know what, I'd like you to have the vaccine as well.\n\nAnd he won't leave me alone in the room anymore. And I'm kidding. But I did ask one time. I'm like, why is there one for our dogs but not for humans? So I was just wondering what the potential of a vaccine for humans is. I wish you, Lindsey and I were chatting earlier, like there has been some research and I guess potential vaccine being prepared in Europe.\n\nYeah. So there's a there are trials for a new multi strain vaccine. I believe the company is Valnevia and so that a multi-site trial that's underway looking, I think it's a phase two trial and they're looking to do roll out phase three trials in the coming years. So it's on the horizon. And then I guess the only other problem for us would be that that only covers Lyme and not the other pathogens that we're finding within these city limits.\n\nCorrect. Okay. Thank you..Ron, did you want to try again? There still seems to be some kind of a problem. I see the you know, the box around your name lights up. So it does seem to be live, but we just can't hear what you're saying. It's unfortunate. Okay. Again, if you want to just type a question into the chat, we'll be happy to get to it.\n\nIola has texted to us that, you know, tucking your pants into your long socks is important and that was that was mentioned in the presentation. And she also says if you can get it, putting powdered sulfur into a sock and banging the sock against your pants to I guess dust your pants with sulfur.\n\nInteresting. Any any comment from our experts on that? Not one that I have come across. No, I haven't heard of that one either. I mean, knowing how sulfur can smell, that might repel a few things. I'm not sure about ticks, but yeah. Okay. We'll take another question from the chat and then I'll go to Glenda. So if a person has chronic Lyme disease and they mentioned for over ten years, can they get a bite which will cause more of the disease.\n\nSo could could they get worse? I guess is the question if they got bitten again. Not something I can comment on as an entomologist. So you'd have to contact a clinician for that one, I think or maybe Alison has some thoughts. Again, for myself, not one that I could comment on there are there are Lyme disease specialists that exist out there.\n\nSo they might have some comment or some input that they can provide on that, but I've not read any information about worsening based on additional or new bites. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to ask Glenda to go ahead and ask your question. You have to unmute and then. I was wondering if squirrels are good hosts for ticks. We have a lot of squirrels in our yard.\n\nThey're good hosts, but they're also good groomers like chipmunks. So they tend to remove the ticks quite readily. So they may carry them in and drop them off. Yeah, well, all right. Someone has a bit of an anecdote in the chat that several years ago she read in the news of a young woman who had Lyme disease symptoms.\n\nBut when tested twice in Ontario, she tested negative and when tested in the U.S. came up as positive for a strain that was not being tested for in Ontario, is that still a possibility or is Ontario now testing for all possible strains? You know, she notes that the young woman ended up with neurological problems as a result of the undiagnosed infection. And not something I can speak to from from my perspective. I can't speak to the strain detection, but I know that Ontario has recently made some amendments to their testing protocols for improvements of detection.\n\nI believe that was announced back in March, actually March just this year, that there is some changes to the detection testing, but it's specific to what strains they can detect that was not elaborated on. I think they also announced earlier this year that the prophylactic antibiotic treatments would now be available through pharmacies as one of the, you know, broadened responsibilities that they were assigning to to pharmacies.\n\nSo it may be possible that once you've got your, you know, concern of of whether you've been in or might have been infected addressed, if you've checked with your your physician, then it may be easier to get the the antibiotic treatment. Yes. That was also something new that was announced in March. Okay, great. Somebody in the chat is asking, can ticks attach to human hair?\n\nNow I'm going to assume that they mean can they bite the hair? I mean, certainly they could cling to hair and and they do. But yeah, I think they they're referring to more of can they bite the hair? No, they can certainly crawl into people's scalps to bite the scalp. But they're looking for a blood meal. Yeah. They're not going to get too much blood out of the hair itself, but definitely they're harder to detect if you're, you know, carrying a full head of hair around like they.\n\nCan be really hard to to detect on the scalp in those conditions. Well, I always kind of worry about that myself. Can you get infected from a nymph or just a bigger tick? Both nymphs and adults can infect you, you know, after they've had their infectious blood meal themselves, then, yeah. Okay. Someone want to know where can ticks be taken for testing?\n\nSo as far as I know, there's no routine testing of ticks through passive surveillance which used to occur, which is mostly to identify new risk areas. There may be some private labs that do tick testing, but again, it's not recommended as a means of of diagnosis because it's it doesn't necessarily identify whether the pathogen is transmitted or whether you may have been bitten by a different tick that you didn't detect.\n\nSo it's not necessarily something that's that's recommended as something for the public. Yeah. And again, I would recommend as you've already mentioned Manisha, the E Tick website will be able to help identify it visually, which is a well-established process for identifying the different types of ticks as opposed to actual testing. Okay. A couple of related questions to two related topics in the chat.\n\nI'll just present them both together, people are wondering what about diatomaceous earth or any leaf or plant substances that might repel or irritate ticks? You certainly mention you're testing a garlic spray, so that's one. Not, I haven't seen that in the literature that I've looked at, but it's quite possible that there may some effect, but not not to my knowledge. Not to mine either.\n\nYeah, I think, you know, diatomaceous earth is certainly used against creatures where that might suffer if they got cut up on the very sharp little minute sharp edges of the diatomaceous earth. So it's it's very effective against soft bodied pests and some others. But yeah, I think you mentioned that the ticks we're concerned about here are really sensitive to heat and drying out, desiccation.\n\nAnd so that's where, you know, keeping keeping the places where they can hide away from your living space helps.\n\nThank you, Ron, you've clarified, Ron was not trying to ask a question. So there we go. We didn't we didn't miss him. That's good. Getting through the chat here. Yes. The tick web site is found on the Ottawa Public Health website. There is a whole page on Lyme disease with some great information there. And if you get a tick bite from an infected tick, are you guaranteed to get sick or can your immune system deal with an infection without treatment?\n\nI don't think I'd recommend taking the chance, if you knew you'd been exposed. Yeah. So, I mean, again, the the probability of infection depends on the spirochete load in the tick itself and the probability of transmission so the many different factors that go that go into it. Even if a tick is infected, it may not transmit and, and vice versa.\n\nSo there it's a bit more complex it's there doesn't tend to be a lot of asymptomatic infections, for example, or or much evidence of, uh, being infected and being able to clear the infection after after being bitten by a tick. So very important to if you've been bitten by a tick, see a health care provider, watch out for symptoms . And ideally, you know, try to avoid getting bitten in the first place.\n\nPrevention, exactly. Like if you you know, if you do find one crawling on you, get it off. And again, if you have been bitten, best to err on the side of caution and see a clinician. Okay. Question following up on that, what we were just talking about, about the availability of the antibiotics. So is doxycycline available as prophylaxis when bitten? And is this available for adults and children without a prescription from the pharmacy?\n\nI'll have to defer to Alison on that, in terms of to the public health policy. Yes. However, that pharmacy access is still relatively new. I do believe you still need a script and you can actually fill it. The pharmacist, it would appear that the pharmacist can do both roles. If you feel like you've had an exposure, you are able to go see them directly.\n\nBesides the fact that they can actually fill a script. Okay. It may depend on the the pharmacy that you go to. All pharmacies have this or all pharmacies have to actually apply for this and determine they want to offer this service. So it's not automatically if it's a pharmacist or a pharmacy that they actually offer the additional services that they have permissions to offer.\n\nOkay. It's an opt in system for them. Yeah. So. Okay, one more question here. And it is it is slowing down. So I think we're going to be wrapping up soon. But given the rise of tick populations in Ottawa, and your study's findings, might it be an entomologist's recommendation or a suggestion to establish a local specialized tick borne illness clinic similar to Quebec's approach, who recently announced that they're going to establish seven Lyme focused clinics? As an entomologist.\n\nI'm I'm not one to make recommendations in terms of health care, but certainly I can comment on the rise of tick populations and number of risk areas in the Ottawa area, which is linked to to the rise of Lyme disease incidence in the population. Interesting to note that a large proportion of Ottawa residents diagnosed with Lyme or that are reported Lyme disease cases actually report exposures outside the city of Ottawa.\n\nSo it's also really important if you're going camping or have a cottage in other regions of especially in that eastern Ontario region, that where there are a lot of tick populations established to also take precaution when you're in those areas and not just in the city here. Yeah, Okay. And there was just one other point that I don't think got raised as a question, but I did want to remind people that as as Manisha said earlier, the the activity level among ticks depends greatly on temperature.\n\nAnd I'd just like our experts to confirm what I have heard, that you can get a tick, it's maybe rare, but you can get tick activity even in the wintertime if the temperature is above zero. And that's happening a lot more lately. Yeah, Yeah, I can confirm that. Absolutely. I mean, the ticks they you know, with there's a deep snow cover, they're quite happy under the leaf litter, kind of hibernating, waiting until they can emerge again.\n\nBut once the temperatures, it's usually around above four degrees, then they're active. So areas, you know, even in the middle of winter, sometimes we have a great sunny day. There's an area of ground that has no snow and the ticks can become active even in the winter. So through E tick, for example, we can see not necessarily in Ottawa, but in parts of southern Ontario.\n\nWe're getting tick submissions all the way through December and January now. Here in Ottawa, the last few years, we tend to have our last e tick submissions, which is a good indication of people being bitten, by mid-November and then starting up again in early April. So we haven't seen them through the winter in terms of people reporting them.\n\nYet but it is it is certainly possible and it's happening in other parts of the province. Yep. And it's something that my my vet's office mentioned to us this year when we went to pick up our supplies of tick and heartworm preventatives for the dog, was that they are now providing you know year round prescriptions for dogs in this area because of the fact that, you know, there hasn't been a month in the past year that where the temperatures didn't get above zero.\n\nSo they're they're now recommending that, you know, you treat your dog with preventatives year round. So. All right. Well, thank you very much, everyone. We've had an excellent session here tonight. I appreciate all of you who've stuck with us through the entire question and answer period. And I thank our presenters very much for their time and energy and you know, responsiveness to all of the questions asked tonight.\n\nWe really appreciate you coming out and joining us in our wildlife speaker series Tick Talk, which, you know, we couldn't we couldn't do on Tiktok because that's that's not allowed at the city anymore. We don't we don't get that on our devices. I never got into it to begin with. So it's probably for the best. But we were we were very pleased to be able to to present to you our own version of Tick Talk on this subject of great interest to many of our residents.\n\nAnd so big virtual hand to our presenters, Manisha and Alison, a big thank you very much to our interpreters and my able assistant, Stephane, for all of his hard work behind the scenes. And thank you for all of you coming out and spending your time with us this evening. It's been really interesting and good discussion. Thank you.\n\nSo, good evening everyone, and welcome to the City’s Wildlife Speaker Series. Thank you for welcoming us into your home tonight. My name is Amy MacPherson and I work in the City’s Natural Systems and Rural Affairs unit.\n\n[FRENCH]\n\nBonsoir, tout le monde. Bienvenue. Notre présentation ce soir est en anglais. Si vous voulez, vous pouvez utiliser la fonction Interprétation dans le panneau de contrôle, et choisissez « Français ». Merci à nos interprètes.\n\nTonight’s presentation is being recorded and will be posted on YouTube.\n\nPlease make sure that your video is turned off if you don’t want to be seen. Your microphones will be kept on mute until the question period at the end of the presentation. At that time, we invite you to raise your hands virtually using the Reaction function at the bottom of the Zoom screen. And we will take your questions in the order that they are received. Our staff will unmute your microphone when it’s your turn to ask your question.\n\nPlease remember to lower your hand once you’ve had your turn or if someone else asks the same question that you were going to ask. We are streaming live tonight from the city of Ottawa, which is built on the unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe Nation. The peoples of the Anishinabe Algonquin Nation have lived on this territory for millennia. Today, Ottawa is home to approximately 40,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people. Ottawa’s indigenous community is diverse, representing many nations, languages and customs. We would like to honour the land of the First Peoples as well as all First Nations, Inuit and Métis in Ottawa and their valuable past and present contributions to this land. We encourage all those listening, wherever you might be, to do the same. Meegwetch.\n\nSpending time outdoors in nature is good for our physical and mental health, and the Ottawa area has a rich diversity of green spaces and trails to explore. Outdoor recreation has been especially important during the pandemic, and many people have discovered the joys of hiking or biking our trails for the first time. This is a great thing, and we encourage people to keep spending time outdoors. We also want to make sure that all trail users know how to stay safe and enjoy their experience with minimal impact on the natural environment. Staying on the trails and leaving no trace helps to keep our natural areas and green spaces in good shape, not only for the next visitor, but for the generations to come. Our speaker tonight is Vickie Lanthier, a military veteran who has combined her interests in health, communication, and the outdoors into GirlGoneGood®. She has extensive experience with the trails and natural areas in and around Ottawa, and we look forward to sharing her advice with you this evening. Welcome, Vickie.\n\nThank you. I appreciate being here tonight with everyone. So, thank you, everyone, for having me in your homes. I appreciate again that it is sunny outside, so the opportunity to go out and play, maybe after this, is something we could take advantage of. I also like smaller groups because it means we could pay more attention to questions and answers at the end. So we go ahead to the next slide.\n\nSo what I’ll go over today is how to choose the right trail for you—after an introduction—responsible recreation, some hiker safety tips and insights, and local hiking resources for you. Next.\n\nAll right, so who am I? Very quickly. I’m an avid day hiker. I’m a frequent road tripper. I’m also a writer, I’m a veteran, IT consultant, and I have a Bachelor of Science in nursing, which is a really weird mix, admittedly. But it really is the backbone for GirlGoneGood—a quirky name, admittedly, but GirlGoneGood means doing good for myself, for others, and for nature. That’s where that name is based out of. Girlgonegood.com is a hiking resource website for southeastern Ontario. So on that website, you will find a plethora of hiking resources, tips, tricks, downloads, packing lists, trail reports, and trail recommendations in order to find the right trail for you.\n\nI also donate 100% of my net proceeds to mental health and conservation charities. Next slide. I feel like this hits us all in the last two years especially, where we have found ourselves and our balance by going back into nature. I have really appreciated in the last few years how we have moved from being stuck in the busyness of our lives and all come out into nature to ground ourselves and maybe balance things out a little bit. Next.\n\nOkay, so we’ll start with how to select the right trail. There are an abundance of trails within Ottawa itself and then Ottawa and region. So for me, what I talk about mostly are trails within two hours of Ottawa. We have the city of Ottawa itself, and then we have nine surrounding counties and regions that surround Ottawa within two hours. So that’s mostly the area that I’ll be talking about.\n\nHow to pick the right trail for you? I will never say in any of my resources if something is easy or beginner or family-friendly. I try to refrain from using those words. I find that they’re not only terribly subjective, but also not inclusive.\n\nSo when you’re taking a look at trail information, you want to take a look at level of effort, so how long the trail is and how much elevation gain there is. We start asking critical questions like: Is the path paved? Is it dirt? Is it boardwalk? Is it rugged? These are the kinds of questions that you want to take a look at in order to determine if it’s the right one for you.\n\nThe next is level of skill. We have to appreciate our own hiking abilities and this could be intimidating. It’s intimidating as a new hiker to get out there and know what’s what. If you are a new hiker or wanting to get into hiking, my recommendation is to join a hiking group for the first time or stick to in-town and in-city trails. And the third is to grab a hiking buddy. Those are my three safety tips if you’re trying to immerse yourself in the hiking community for the first time in trails. So, things to ask is: if there’s cell reception, is there trail signage, and how are my navigation skills? Because even within some pockets of the city of Ottawa and definitely outside, we think that this may be a popular trail and that we’re going to have the same beautiful signage that sometimes the NCC has because it’s only 30 minutes down the road.\n\nBut the reality is there might not be cell reception, you might not have signage, and you might require navigation skills in order to get through it. The third thing is the season. You’ll be surprised the differences between the seasons that we have to consider. I have a handout on my website on seasonal considerations, but there are important questions to ask, like road access during the winter. If you go out into the counties, there are plenty of trails that are… To access the trailhead, you have to drive on dirt or forest roads. That is not going to be plowed or accessible in the winter.\n\nThen you have to ask yourself, is it a shared trail? In Ottawa, we are wonderful at sharing our trails in the winter and redesignating them to snowshoe trail or cross-country skiing or skate skiing. Not all trails can be for us hikers. We have to share them in the winter. And we have to be cognizant of that change and not to be too disruptive about it, because the reality is there are so many trails to hike, you could easily find another one. And we can leave some for our beautiful skiers and snowshoers.\n\nHunting season is another question to ask in the fall. So, lo and behold, even within city limits, there are pockets where there is legalized hunting, or you can legally hunt. Sorry. So you have to be cognizant of hiking within forest trails in the fall. You have to adapt for that. You have to wear bright colours. You have to speak loudly. You have to abide by any trail closures if there are any. And then, of course, the last one to consider is in the spring and mud season. I like to say that there’s actually… We don’t start hiking in the spring. It’s actually flood, then mud, then bug, and then hiking season. That seems to be our flow in Ontario.\n\nSo to have some patience with that, because it can get quite disruptive to the trail itself and the surrounding flora. And the last is to consider the features. So what kinds of features do you want to see or what kinds of features do you need in order to pick the right trail for you? So that could go from boardwalks to ramps to towers to interpretive signage to waterfalls and vistas. So those are the four considerations that I would take into account when you’re trying to select the right trail for you. Next.\n\nSo this image is a little grayed out here, and that’s okay. But this image is of Deacon Escarpment up near Golden Lake. It is a private property open to the public for hiking and cabin rentals. It is a gorgeous property with over 20 km of trails. And I just wanted to share this because as you can see, I think it gives Gatineau Park a good run for its money on how beautiful it is. And that’s simply to share that we have more than what we think for beautiful areas and trails within our reach. Next.\n\nThe 10 Essentials. So there are two things that you’re going to hear every hiker harp on, and it’s going to be the 10 Essentials, and it’s going to be Leave No Trace. So I can’t do any talk justice if I don’t talk about it. And there’s a few added things that I like to add specifically for Ontario. So let’s go over the 10 Essentials. Yeah, we could stay on this slide. So the 10 Essentials themselves are navigation, which, in the city you’re okay with your cell phone for the most part. Outside of the city, you’re going to have to strongly consider either a spotter, an emergency spotter, or a GPS or map and compass.\n\nYou’re also going to have to consider bringing an extra battery for your cell phone as well if you’re doing a longer hike. Headlamps, oh my goodness! We all love sunrise and sunset hikes. This is also a prime opportunity for us to get in trouble while hiking because we are either hiking in the dark or hiking out in the dark. So you always have to bring a head lamp and spare batteries. And if you’re going in for a sunrise or sunset hike, my recommendation is that you go hike the trail in daylight first. And a quick note that red light does not pair well with blue markers. So if the trail has blue markers, make sure you have white light so that you can see that properly.\n\nThe next thing is sun protection, then first aid kit. Funny enough, if you have a dog, did you know there’s dog first aid kits and dog first aid courses as well? So that’s something to note if you’re a dog owner, especially if you’ve got one in the last two years like most of us did with all our beautiful pandemic puppies. Next is a knife or repair kit.\n\nThen fire, like waterproof matches, shelter like an emergency bivy or a tarp, extra food, extra water and extra clothes. And you’re going to think this is a lot. But in quite honesty, I could pack this into ten litres or less within my bag. So it’s not as much as you think, but it does come in handy. In the last 20 years, I think I’ve used everything on this list at least once for myself or others.\n\nNow the four things that I would add to this list for Ontario specifically (next slide) would be bear spray. We do have our beautiful black bears in this area. We do have sightings of different large animals and coyotes and everything else. So in Ontario, bear spray is a registered item. So you could go to SAIL or MEC or Bushtukah or any of the outdoor stores and sign for bear spray yourself using your driver’s license or another piece of ID. You have to know how to use it properly. I was fearful. I did have someone, bless their heart, ask me once if they sprayed it on themselves like bug spray. And that was an honest-to-goodness question. No, you do not.\n\nSo my first recommendation is bear spray. But you please go onto the provincial Ontario website and you can have the links on how to react properly to bears and how to use bear spray. The next thing is a bug shirt because, oh my heart, we have all the bugs here in Ontario! And please consider that all trails will have ticks. It’s just the way it is nowadays and we have to adapt for it. So that means wearing your socks over your pants even if it doesn’t look cool. Using DEET or permethrin clothing. And bug netting is a blessing in those months where we have the flies and mosquitoes and then maybe flies again in August.\n\nCell phone apps: here’s a neat thing about cell phone apps, especially for in the city. I don’t recommend it for the counties, but in the city where you’re going to use your cell phone, please consider downloading what3words. what3words is an application on your phone that you could use in an emergency that the OPP use to identify where you are within 10 metres. So kindly consider using that application.\n\nAnd poles. Poles are my friends. People think it looks nerdy. I’m a big fan of using hiking poles, especially during mud season, deep winter seasons and steep descents. It’ll save your knees and your balance and it will save you from getting into trouble while hiking. Next slide.\n\nSo this here is a picture from Manitou Mountain in Calabogie. Now we know Calabogie mostly because of Eagle’s Nest. Everybody goes out and they hike Eagle’s Nest, which is slowly getting overrun. On the other side of the mountain, however, there’s over 9 km of trails and I think five lookouts. This is one of the lookouts, I believe this is Manitou Mountain lookout, that you could explore. Now, you have to be careful on these trails because even though they’re well marked, it’s easy to get turned around. But that rugged trail on Manitou Mountain is as challenging... For those folks who love Gatineau Park, I would say that side of the mountain of Manitou Mountain is a good equivalent to both trails, if not more challenging, if that’s what you’re looking for. Okay? There’s also some other great areas in Calabogie like Wabun Lake lookout, which is an 18 km loop. There’s Jamieson, there’s Griffith Uplands, which is 10 km with elevation.\n\nThere’s Dacre Heights, which is an old ski lift that you can actually hike up in the winter and then ski down if you want to. It is private property that’s open to the public, so that’s a lot of fun. And a few other things. So don’t get stuck on the same trails. Feel free to explore a little as long as you keep the 10 Essentials in mind. Next slide.\n\nLeave No Trace! So I’m officially, as GirlGoneGood, partnered with Leave No Trace Canada. Very proud to have had that done in the last few months with them. Of course, we all want to follow the seven Leave No Trace principles, so I’m just going to go through them quickly because you could go to leavenotracecanada.ca and look it up yourself and they have wonderful explanations on it. I’m just going to give my little tip with each of them as we go along.\n\nSo the first one is plan ahead and prepare. I would say that plan ahead and prepare, in today’s day and age (especially good example is the storm we just had!) would include going directly to the trail manager’s website to see the status or any updates on that particular trail.\n\nNow what is a trail manager? Because that gets asked as well. It is either someone who maintains the trail or someone who owns the property. Usually they do both. So that could be a land trust, it could be the City of Ottawa, it could be the NCC or conservation authority. Or it could be like Dacre Heights where it’s private land open to the public. But make sure to look up that trail. Don’t just rely on AllTrails but go directly to the trail manager to get the right information.\n\nNext is travel and camp on hard surfaces. This point, especially for Ontario, the only point I have here is to really watch for spring roads, the dirt roads, especially in Renfrew County, Frontenac, any of those just outside Ottawa counties. If you have a forest road or dirt road going into the trailhead, those are sometimes too soft for vehicles in the early spring.\n\nDispose of waste properly. If anybody is on social media, on Facebook or Instagram, you can find me @girlgonegood. It’s at the end of this presentation and you go out on the trail and pick up trash! It’s called plogging. We’re making it trendy again. If you go out and pick up trash on the trail, please take a picture and tag me in it because I would love to see that. We have been growing in our outdoor community and making plogging trendy and picking up trash as we go. So my habit is to, if it’s an out and back trail, I will hike to the furthest point and then on my way back I always carry garbage bags or small bags with me and I pick up as I come back. That would be a wonderful thing and I would love to see it.\n\nNext is leave what you find. So everyone loves foraging and discovering different mushrooms and plant types. And I would say, how about we leave nature for nature? And there are several different ecological reasons why to leave nature as is. You could actually go ahead to the next slide. Sorry.\n\nBut if you are curious about that nature, why not download an app like iNaturalist and play a game of identification along the trail and take note of... Foraging could get you in a lot of trouble really quickly. It’s not permitted on the conservation areas and you have to learn how to ask the right questions. Like, do you know how to forage properly? Can I forage on this property? How much of this plant can I forage? There’s so many questions. You actually have to know how to do it properly before moving ahead with it.\n\nMinimize campfire impacts. This has been surprising this year! I have actually run into live fires while hiking on whether it’s Crown land or public land that also has camping sites. I’ve run into two live fires already this year, which is a little disheartening. And then what I’ve also found, unfortunately, is a lot of small fires that have not been dissipated properly. And I don’t know if that’s for the Instagram effect or if we’re just trying to, you know, go out and find our own peace in nature. However, please look on the Leave No Trace Canada website on how to actually minimize campfire impacts. And please consider not having a fire and abiding by the trail manager rules in the first place.\n\nThe last is: be considerate. Oh, sorry, I’m at respect wildlife. I’m skipping ahead. Respect wildlife. Of course, a good rule of thumb is to stay at a distance that you could cover the wildlife with your thumb. So keep the distance away. Have your hand in front of you with your thumb out front. And if you could cover the animal with the top of your thumb, then that is a safe distance or considered a safe, respectable distance to be away from that animal.\n\nAnd the last one is: be considerate of others. Now, this one here, I want to particularly point on sharing viewpoints. I know we all like to take pictures at the viewing points, but we need to share these points. These open areas are for all of us. Another one would be to consider not having music on the trails. This impacts the experience of others and wildlife. And third, that people, we just don’t think of, and that’s fair, is in the more rugged areas where there’s a lot of rock face and you end up on this beautiful vista with c"
