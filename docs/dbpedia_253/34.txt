As an eight-year-old growing up in Ottawa’s west end, Stephen Le knew he wanted to be a writer. What he didn’t know, though, was that researching his debut book would involve eating live worm larvae and centipedes.

The just-released 100 Million Years Of Food opens with vivid anecdotes of Le’s intrepid dining adventures in Vietnam, where his parents were from. Sensational as such stories are, they’re in the service of Le’s larger theme. The 42-year-old bio-anthropologist, who was recently a visiting professor at his alma mater, the University of Ottawa, contends that given human evolution and history, traditional, ancestral diets are better for our health.

The book, which entertainingly merges tales of Le’s extensive travels with assiduously documented research, has been praised by peers such as Jared Diamond, the author of Guns, Germs, and Steel, and food historian Mark Kurlansky — even as proponents of the Paleo diet and other eating regimens pooh-pooh it.

In the edited conversation below, Le, who is relocating to Sweden for the next year or so for his next academic posting, discusses his breakthrough book and its findings.

Q: You’ve written this book after studies in mathematics, international relations and finally biological anthropology. Why did you become an author?

A: When I was eight years old I wanted to become a writer. I had this strong passion for writing, but the conflict was that I was always interested in science as well. Those two themes kept up with me throughout my adult life.

Q: What was the genesis of your book?

A: There are two things. The passing away of my mother from breast cancer in 2010, that drove me to try to find out the dietary factors that I could control, and lessons that I could pass on to my family members.

The second thing was my best friend going on a Paleo diet. I wanted to know about the long-term health consequences of his choice.

Q: What kind of eater were you before you embarked on your research?

A: I was like my parents in that both my parents were trained as scientists. They were very good at following nutritional guidelines. We trimmed the fat from our chicken, the skin from our chicken, and we ate a lot of vegetables. When we went out to buffets, I would focus on the salad bar. In my teens and 20s I was already health-conscious by the definition of nutritional science.

One turning point that I had was when my mother was in her last months. She said to me at the kitchen table, “You know, despite all these years of eating carefully, look at what happened to me anyway.” Her point was all this careful heeding of nutritional advice had proved to be heedless in the end.

Q: How hard was it to do some of the extreme eating that was part of your research?

A: The larva was the hardest. Psychologically, it was the most difficult to do. The friend that also ate the larvae at the same dinner, she hyperventilated. Her hand trembled. I also had a lot of difficulty putting that insect into my mouth.

Q: How has your own eating since you wrote the book?

A: For one thing, I’m enjoying fat a lot more. I used to trim the fat from the chicken. I don’t do that any more. I enjoy a glass or two of wine a day and I don’t feel guilty about that.

I think I just approach food with less guilt over all. Anywhere in the world I go, I just enjoy the local cuisine and I don’t worry about the health effects.

Growing up in the Canada, I became paranoid about eating things that had too much salt and too much fat. I think that really took away the pleasure from eating food. Now the pleasure has come back to me after doing the research for this book.

Q: You mentioned your curiosity about the Paleo diet. What conclusions did you draw?

A: In the case of the Paleo diet, people will lose weight temporarily on it, and their mood increases. They feel better. But in terms of the long-term health consequences, it’s likely that they’ll end up shortening their life spans, because of the large amount of meat they end up eating.

Q: What other diets have you considered?

A: Raw vegan diets. Humans throughout our history, we’ve always cooked our foods. Eating raw foods is a very novel thing. People on these raw vegan diets, the women have higher rates of infertility because they can’t get enough calories from their food.

Also in human history, there’s never been a point when humans didn’t have some form of animal food in their diet. Vegan diets in general are also novel and probably not good for our health for that reason. Our bodies through evolution are well-designed to handle animal foods but not purely vegetarian diets.

Fruitarian diets are also very unusual from the point of view of history. In the book I mention one case of a patient who was admitted to a hospital in France. He had a heart attack and when they did an autopsy, they saw these crystals inside his lungs, which had come from eating apples.

Q: Surely the followers of various diets take issue with you.

A: (For the book) I talked extensively with Dr. Dean Ornish. He’s well known for being a proponent of low-fat and low salt diets. He argued that biology did not explain everything in human health, and he sent me a lot of studies to support his viewpoints on the beneficial effects of a low-fat diet. He doesn’t agree with me.

I also talked with a Paleo advocate, Mark Sisson. He gave me his viewpoints, and he didn’t like the take-home point that eating Paleo would shorten a person’s life span. But he didn’t come up with any sort of data to disagree with that either.

What I took from all these conversations is that in any particular diet, you can always find evidence to support your point of view. You can always find beneficial effects with any diet. But what these proponents end up doing, they ignore any evidence contrary to their view, or they diminish its importance.

What I tried to do in this book is take the broadest viewpoint, the most holistic viewpoint, to bring all these different kinds of arguments together to see why recommendations were so contradictory.

Stephen Le’s rules to eat and live by

Keep moving

“Walk like our ancestors did and amble for at least two hours a day,” Le writes. “Vigorous exercise makes people hungrier and often leads to physical injuries, while cutting back on calories takes superhuman control and is probably an unnatural thing for humans to do, as our hunter-gatherer relations had pretty healthy appetites.”

Drink alcohol moderately

“When intake is moderate — two drinks a day for men, one drink a day for women — the health benefits of alcohol for mitigating heart disease and mortality in general are stronger than any known benefit from any other food item, including vegetables, fruits and fish,” writes Le. However, the benefits of drinking alcohol apply mostly to people over 40 in developed countries, and alcohol can exacerbate health risks for younger people, including accidents, homicides and suicides.

Eat less meat and dairy when young

While meat and dairy promote faster growth, high levels of growth-related hormones such as IGF-1 increase the risks of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer later in life. But people older than 65 eating more meat is beneficial to mitigate health risks stemming from frailty.

Eat traditional cuisine

Le advocates traditional diets, which tend to be moderate in fat, cholesterol and salt and cites the Mediterranean diet as one example among many, including southern U.S., Mexican, Japanese and Australian Aboriginal. “The older the cuisine, the better,” he writes. “Five-hundred-year-old cuisines are a good starting point, because at that point industrially processed foods had not yet made significant inroads in peoples lives.” Studies show traditional diets do at least as well as nutritionist-approved low-fat, low-salt diets in maintaining health, writes Le.

Eat what your ancestors ate

For certain populations, human bodies adapted to specific diets, acquiring, for example, enzymes to process starches or process milk. “If your ancestors didn’t consume much starch or dairy, neither should you,” Le writes.

Eat sustainably

Eat more of the plants and animals that are adapted to local environments and decrease reliance on foreign, poorly adapted plants and animals, Le urges.

Cook at low heat

Traditional low-heat cooking methods such as boiling, steaming and stewing produce less AGEs (advanced glycation end products), a harmful compounds that can be a factor linked to degenerative diseases. High-temperature, dry methods including broiling, roasting deep-frying and grilling produce more AGEs, and processed foods are rife with AGEs.
