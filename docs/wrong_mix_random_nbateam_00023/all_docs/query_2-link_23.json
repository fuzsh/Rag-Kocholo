        "text": "Lou Reed passed away today in Long Island, New York. Though the cause of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer's death hasn't been officially announced, reports indicate that it's connected to a liver transplant he had earlier this year. Reed was 71.\n\nA talented singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer, Reed leaves behind a musical legacy matched by few and known by many. He co-founded the avant-garde rock group Velvet Underground in 1964; the band, managed and championed by Andy Warhol, went on to become one of the most influential in the history of music.\n\nRolling Stone ranked the band's self-titled 1967 debut No. 13 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all-time, proclaiming it \"the most proÂ­phetic rock album ever made.\" The LP's impact on the music world, however, dwarfed its commercial success.\n\n\"The first Velvet Underground record sold 30,000 copies in the first five years,\" legendary rock producer Brian Eno once said. \"I think everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band.\"\n\nLike the Velvet Underground's debut and subsequent releases, Reed's solo career earned critical acclaim that far outstrips its commercial success. Remarkably, neither the band nor Reed has had a record that's been certified gold or platinum by the RIAA.\n\nStill, Reed remained a industry force over the decades, making music nearly until the time of his death. Throughout his career, he worked with other celebrated artists from David Bowie to, recently, Metallica.\n\nHe did enjoy moderate financial success on the road, clocking 161 solo shows over the past 13 years, according to Pollstar. With an average gross of $260,000 per night, that translates to an average of about $1 million per year from touring alone, plus additional income from songwriting and record sales.\n\nThat's certainly enough to live very comfortably, but nowhere near the double-digit millions required to rank among the world's highest-paid musicians. It seems unlikely Reed's fortunes will change much in the afterlife: the threshold to make FORBES' top-earning dead celebrities list is $7 million.\n\nBut given Reed's anti-establishment proclivities--he once mused about how to save rock \"from unwanted capitalistic corporation music\"--it's safe to say that wherever he is, he'll be just fine with that."
