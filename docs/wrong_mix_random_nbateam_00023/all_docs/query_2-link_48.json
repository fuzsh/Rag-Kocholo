        "text": "American rock pioneer Lou Reed, whose band the Velvet Underground became one of the most influential in rock by fusing art and music in 1960s New York, has died aged 71.\n\nLoading...\n\nReed died in Long Island of complications following a liver transplant, which he had in May.\n\nA hard drinker and drug user for many years, Reed underwent the surgery at the Cleveland Mayo Clinic, his wife Laurie Anderson told The Times newspaper, after he cancelled five California concert dates scheduled in April.\n\n\"I am a triumph of modern medicine,\" Reed posted on his website on June 1, 2013, without directly acknowledging the transplant.\n\n\"I look forward to being on stage performing, and writing more songs to connect with your hearts and spirits and the universe well into the future.\"\n\nThe singer-songwriter, whose best-known hits included Perfect Day and Walk On The Wild Side, was considered one of the most influential people in rock music.\n\nMusic magazine Rolling Stone describes the Velvet Underground as the most influential American rock band of all time.\n\nThe band rose to prominence by fusing art and music in 1960s' New York through its collaboration with artist Andy Warhol.\n\nThe Velvet Underground never achieved much commercial success, but revolutionised rock in the 1960s and '70s with a mixture of thrashing guitar licks and smooth melodies sung by Reed or the sultry German model Nico, who briefly collaborated with the band at Warhol's insistence.\n\nThe band has long been recognised as a major musical influence on punk and art rock, as reflected in a quote often attributed to musician Brian Eno that, \"The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band.\"\n\nJohn Cale, who co-founded the Velvet Underground but had a sometimes fractious relationship with his former bandmate, released a statement on his Facebook page: \"The world has lost a fine songwriter and poet. I've lost my 'school-yard buddy',\" he said.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn in 1942, Lewis Allan \"Lou\" Reed would become one of New York's most famous artists - often photographed with sunglasses, a cigarette and a deadpan look.\n\nIn 2007 he told the ABC he would have toured Australia more \"if it didn't take 20 hours to get there\".\n\nA heroin user in his early days, Reed became a devout practitioner of tai chi later in life.\n\nMusic critic and author Jim DeRogatis says Reed elevated rock music to an art form.\n\n\"Having Andy Warhol endorse your first record and present it to the world as capital A art, I mean there's no band, and I would exclude even The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, that did more to underscore that this music is art,\" he said.\n\nMr DeRogatis, who edited a book on the Velvet Underground, says Reed made some of the best rock music albums of all time.\n\n\"The kind of things he could deal with over a simple three-chord melody are up there with [Bob] Dylan or anybody else,\" he said.\n\n\"Dylan we study as a poet but Reed made us feel it first and foremost in our pelvis; it's that visceral, intellectual combination that few other bands, few other artists or songwriters ever did as well.\"\n\nReed and Ms Anderson were the curators of the Vivid Festival in Sydney in 2010.\n\nThree years earlier, Reed participated in a project during the Sydney Festival, performing his 1973 album Berlin live on stage.\n\nFormer Sydney Festival director Fergus Linehan says it was an honour to know Reed.\n\n\"He was very New York, he was very direct, didn't suffer fools gladly,\" he said.\n\n\"People say to me 'did you work with Lou Reed?' and I say I worked for Lou Reed.\n\n\"Once you understood the chain of command, he was wonderful.\"\n\nStorify: Lou Reed tributes"
