        "text": "Lou Reed‘s cause of death has been confirmed as liver disease by his doctor.\n\nDr Charles Miller of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where the singer had liver transplant surgery this year and was being treated again until a few days ago, confirmed the cause of death to the New York Times.\n\nLou Read: A Life In Pictures\n\nThe passing of the former Velvet Underground frontman and later influential solo artist was announced on Sunday (October 27). He was aged 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time of his liver transplant operation in May, his wife Laurie Anderson suggested that he might not “ever totally recover”. Reed later posted a message to fans on Facebook, where he described himself as a “triumph of modern medicine” and announced that he is looking forward to playing live again. He also returned to the stage on June 20, but in July he was rushed to hospital with “severe dehydration”.\n\nDavid Bowie, Morrissey, The Strokes, Patti Smith, Sonic Youth are just some of the huge list of artists who have paid tribute to Lou Reed.\n\nRead NME’s obituary of Lou Reed, 1942 – 2013\n\nRecommended\n\nRead NME’s tribute to Lou Reed"
