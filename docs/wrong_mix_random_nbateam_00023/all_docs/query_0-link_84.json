These were good years for Tabitha and where she brought home Shawn, Brenda and Les.\n\nTabitha moved with her family to a farm in the community of Halls Mill. This is where Lori was brought home. When Lester had short-term, debilitating back problems, Tabitha took over the farm and livestock.

She played the piano at Crowell’s Chapel church in Halls Mill before she and Lester eventually changed their membership to the First Church of the Nazarene in Shelbyville.\n\nTabitha worked at Jostens for decades and made lifelong friends there.\n\n|\n\nTo know Tabitha was to love her. Tabitha was a wonderful mother and grandmother. She possessed an inner elegance and determination, and had a great sense of humor.
