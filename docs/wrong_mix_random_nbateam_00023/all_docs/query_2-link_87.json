        "meta_description": "Singer-songwriter Lou Reed died this sunday. Reed, who was in music for almost fifty years, underwent a liver transplant last May, and it looks like the transplant did not succeed. Reed became famous with the Velvet Underground in the Sixties, before going solo in 1970. That year Lou Reed scored his biggest hit-single, 'Walk on the Wild Side'. Later, Reed collaborated with, amongst others, Metallica, The Killers, Simple Minds, Tom Tom Club, John Cale, Bruce Hornsby and Gorrilaz. \r\n\r\nReed was a good friend of Andy Warhol and married singer Laurie Anderson ('Oh Superman') in 2008. \r\n\r\nR.I.P. Lou Reed (March 2nd, 1942 - October 27th 2013)",
