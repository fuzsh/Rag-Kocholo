        "text": "Photo by Kirstie Shanley\n\nIn a new Guardian profile, Lana Del Rey says that the late Lou Reed was supposed to appear on her Ultraviolence track \"Brooklyn Baby\". Unfortunately, he passed away right as they were set to meet. \"I took the red eye, touched down at 7am … and two minutes later he died,\" she says.\n\nElsewhere in the profile, she claims that she wants to die. When asked by writer Tim Jonze \"if she sees an early death as glamorous,\" she responds, \"I don't know. Ummm, yeah,\" before adding, \"I wish I was dead already.\" When Jonze tells her not to say that, that she doesn't really mean it, Del Rey responds, \"I do! I don't want to have to keep doing this. But I am.\"\n\nJonze asks \"Do what? Make music?\", and she responds, \"Everything. That's just how I feel. If it wasn't that way, then I wouldn't say it. I would be scared if I knew [death] was coming, but …\"\n\nAdditionally, she thinks that criticism aimed at her is \"personal\" (rather than straight-up sexism) because in comparison to artists like Miley Cyrus, Lily Allen and Lorde, she isn't a \"true provocateur.\" \"I don't think there's any shock value in my stuff – well, maybe the odd disconcerting lyric – but I think other people probably deserve the criticism, because they're eliciting it,\" she said.\n\nListen to \"Brooklyn Baby\":"
