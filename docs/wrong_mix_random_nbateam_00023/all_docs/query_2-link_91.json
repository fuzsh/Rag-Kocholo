        "text": "Reed, best recognized by mainstream audiences for his 1972 solo hit ‚ÄúWalk on the Wild Side\", died at the Long Island home he shared with his wife, Laurie Anderson, following complications from a liver transplant he underwent earlier this year, his agent, Andrew Wylie, said.\n\n‚ÄúI think Lou was as great an artist as it was possible to be,\" Wylie said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great loss.\"\n\nWhile the Velvet Underground never achieved great commercial success, the band revolutionized rock in the 1960s and 1970s with a mixture of thrashing guitar licks and smooth melodies sung by Reed or the sultry German model Nico, who briefly collaborated with the band at Warhol‚Äôs insistence.\n\nThe band has long been recognized as a major musical inspiration for punk art and rock, as reflected in a quote often attributed to musician Brian Eno: ‚ÄúThe first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band.\"\n\nNeil Portnow, president the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which bestows the Grammys, credited Reed with ‚Äúintroducing avant-garde rock to the mainstream.\"\n\n‚ÄúHis uniquely stripped-down style of guitar playing and poetic lyrics have had a massive influence across many rock genres, including punk and alternatives,\" Portnow said.\n\nJohn Cale, who co-founded the Velvet Underground but had a sometimes fractious relationship with his former bandmate, released a statement on his Facebook page: ‚ÄúThe world has lost a fine songwriter and poet ... I‚Äôve lost my ‚Äòschool-yard buddy‚Äô,\" he said.\n\nCale and Reed put aside their differences to release a tribute album to Warhol in 1990 called ‚ÄúSongs for Drella\", which lead to a handful of reunion performances by members of the Velvet Underground‚Äôs original line-up in the early 1990s.\n\nMusician Iggy Pop‚Äôs official Twitter account called news of Reed‚Äôs death ‚Äúdevastating\", while musician Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth tweeted: ‚ÄúSo sorry to hear of Lou Reed‚Äôs passing this is a huge shock!\"\n\nAn admitted hard drinker and drug user for many years, Reed underwent a liver transplant earlier this year in Cleveland, his wife revealed, after he had canceled a series of California concert dates in April.\n\n‚ÄúI am a triumph of modern medicine,\" Reed posted on his website on 1 June 2013, without directly acknowledging the transplant. ‚ÄúI look forward to being on stage performing, and writing more songs to connect with your hearts and spirits and the universe well into the future.\"\n\nLyrics that shocked\n\nReed has been widely credited with expanding the lexicon of rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll with provocative lyrics that chronicled androgyny, illicit sex, and drug abuse, notably in the song ‚ÄúHeroin\", in which he declares, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my wife, and it‚Äôs my life.\"\n\n‚ÄúWalk on the Wild Side\", a catchy tune off his second solo album, ‚ÄúTransformer\", co-produced by fellow avante-garde rocker David Bowie, became Reed‚Äôs only top-20 hit single, though it contained lyrical references to transexuality, drugs and male prostitution.\n\n‚ÄúSister Ray\"‚Äîa 17-minute blast of guitar distortions‚Äîlikewise combined stories of sailors, oral sex, murder, intravenous drug use and the mysterious title character.\n\n‚ÄúI never in a million years thought people would be outraged by what I was doing,\" Reed said in a 1989 interview with Rolling Stone magazine. ‚ÄúYou could go to your neighbourhood bookstore and get any of that.\"\n\nOne of his signature songs, first performed by the Velvet Underground and later a staple of his solo act, was simply titled ‚ÄúRock and Roll,\" a semi-autobiographical story of how music saved the life of a young fan listening on the radio.\n\nHis stage persona, often appearing in a dog collar and eye makeup, opened the door for Bowie and other artists to take sexually ambivalent styles into the mainstream.\n\nIt was personified in the landmark live album ‚ÄúRock N Roll Animal,\" released in 1974. That record closely followed the studio-record rock opera album ‚ÄúBerlin\", which he brought to life again with a 2006 concert that was made into a 2007 film directed by Julian Schnabel.\n\nLater in his career, Reed became something of an elder statesman of rock, a towering figure in a club with fellow legends such as Bob Dylan and Neil Young.\n\nReed always placed great importance on song-writing. One of his first jobs out of college was as a staff writer for Pickwick Records. He dedicated the 1966 Velvet Underground song ‚ÄúEuropean Son\" to the late poet, Delmore Schwartz, under whom he studied at Syracuse University.\n\nReed was married three times, the latest to recording and performance artist Laurie Anderson in 2008, and in recent years took an intense interest in photography, staging exhibitions of his work.\n\nMilestone Alert!
