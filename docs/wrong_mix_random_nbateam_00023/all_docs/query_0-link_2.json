        "text": "Mick Rock, globally known as The Man Who Shot The Seventies, was David Bowie’s official photographer and was considered the world’s number one rock ’n’ roll portrait photographer. Subject of the hit Netflix documentary, SHOT!, Rock’s outstanding portfolio includes Iggy Pop, Queen, The Sex Pistols, Blondie, Madonna, Roxy Music, Syd Barrett, The Kinks, Freddie Mercury, Motley Crüe, Andy Warhol, Ozzy Osbourne, Peter Gabriel and Thin Lizzy. More recently, Rock has captured the likes of The Killers, Ellie Goulding, The Black Keys, Kate Moss, Daft Punk, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg and Dave Grohl to firmly cement his place as not only a witness to some of the greatest periods of musical history, but undoubtedly an active participant in its rich history.\n\nHis fine art portrait photography is appreciated as some of the most collectible in the world, with his association with David Bowie providing some highlights in an already full showreel. Encapsulated in several books, the last one of which was GLAM!, Mick Rock also directed several of Bowie’s music videos. The Life on Mars, Space Oddity and Jean Genie music videos under his direction are now all part of the permanent collection of MOMA , New York, with his friend and fellow rock ‘n’ roller affectionately agreeing; “Mick sees me the way I see myself.”\n\nMick Rock sadly passed away at the end of 2021, a much missed friend."
