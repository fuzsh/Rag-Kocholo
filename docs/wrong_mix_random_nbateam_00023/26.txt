We're terribly sad to report the passing of a legend of rock n' roll: Lou Reed has died at the age of 71, according to reports on RollingStone.com.

According to the Associated Press, Reed's cause of death was due to a liver-related ailment. Reed underwent surgery for a liver transplant in May, 2013.

Lou Reed's career spanned nearly 50 years. He is best-known as the leader and co-founder of one of rock n' roll's most influential bands, The Velvet Underground. Of the band, critic Lester Bangs wrote, "Modern music begins with the Velvets and the implications and influence of what they did seem to go on forever."

Reed also had a very productive solo career since the 1970s, spawning such notable hits as "Walk on the Wild Side" and "Perfect Day."

Most recently, Lou Reed collaborated with Metallica, releasing Lulu in 2011. He remained active and interested in music, recently writing a nuanced review of Kanye West's album Yeezus.

Reed is survived by his wife, composer and artist Laurie Anderson.
