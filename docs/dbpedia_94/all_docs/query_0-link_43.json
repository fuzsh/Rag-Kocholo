The Italian documentary MONDO CANE inspired a long list of sequels, imitations, and rip-offs. MONDO movies, always big money makers in Asia, have become profitable again in America. THE FACES OF DEATH video series has caused a lot of controversy, and > many older MONDO style movies have been released on tape. Part I of our MONDO ' guide traces the convoluted history of documentaries (and phoney documentaries) for 80 (!) years, from the invention of motion pictures until 1968, and shows (as usual) that nothing is new. Charles Kilgore, editor of ECCO magazine has seen more MONDO movies than anybody I know and writes about a lot of them here. Should these exploitive movies be banned, censored, ignored, avoided, studied, laughed at? Read our MONDO series and decide for yourself! The David Carradine interview has been delayed until next issue (sorry about that), but we have an exclusive interview with one of the screen's best villains, SID HAIG. Haig was the mutant Ralph in the cult classic SPIDER BABY, was Dragos on the JASON OF STAR COMMAND Saturday morning TV series, was a regular in movies by director Jack Hill, and in movies starring Pam Grier. Sid talks about working in The Philippines, being a rock drummer, being mobbed by little kids at supermarket openings, and reveals why he's bald. Sid was interviewed by rock and roll and film publicist Gary Hertz. THE ELECTRIC EELS were a loud outrageous early seventies pre punk “art” band from Cleveland. I went to school with these guys, shared crummy apartments with them, put up with their shit for years, and vowed to keep writing about them until somebody put out an EELS album so other people could hear for themselves. In ‘78 I wrote about them in CLE magazine (where the first PSYCHOTRONIC movie reviews appeared in my column called To Avoid Fainting- Repeat...). In ‘86 I wrote about them in a special, long gone, limited edition one shot PSYCHOTRONIC magazine. An album is finally coming out, and this is my last EELS article. Promise! WINGS HAUSER is an actor/singer/scriptwriter known for playing sadistic, psychotic maniacs, especially in VICE SQUAD. Char Rao (who managed The Cramps, not a very managable group, back in their early NY days) met him while he was starring in a Chuck Vincent movie in the New York area with Linda Blair. Linda wouldn’t talk, but Wings sure did and he’s got a lot of movies about to be released. Like Sid Haig, Wings was once in bands, and worked in The Philippines too. Akira Fitton, a PSYCHOTRONIC contributor since 1980, writes about TANGERINE DREAM. I don’t consider the German group a rock band (these days their albums are in “new age” bins), but they write and perform excellent soundtracks and were pionieres in sythesizer music. I’d rather hear one of their creepy scores than another soundtrack of old top 40 hits. Since semi-famous actors, directors, and musicians often die and are ignored by daily newspapers, TV news. People magazine, and even Entertainment Tonight, we’re starting an obituary section so you can stop wandering why certain people aren’t doing anything anymore. This issue’s special, one time only, long section highlights descrying pbople PSYCHOTRONIC - 2 INCREDIBLE! who passed away in ‘89 and helped make the world more PSYCHOTRONIC. The PSYCHOTRONIC Letters and Book Review sections have grown, and we continue to present Dale Ashmun’s SPARE PARTS, and Art Black’s Record Reviews. The video review section(s) include quite a few promo oddities I received in the mail. Tapes I probably never would have rented, but you might want to know about, are reviewed alongside more commercial and easier to find titles. If you send videos, books, albums or whatever, we will at least mention them. I like breakfast cereal. I don’t eat the same sugar coated kid stuff I used to devour (Trix, Captain Crunch, Sugar Pops, even Lucky Charms...), but I’m not filing for all those new high fiber, “healthy” brands either. I like old standards like Rice Knspies, Cheerios, Wheaties, Kix, and especially Rice Chex. I was happy to find “save up to 50%” movie tickets on boxes of Chex cereals recently. Not a cheap toy or puzzle, or piece of candy or gum, but something worth $, that I would use. The problem is, the half price tickets are for Cineplex Odeon Theatres. This Toronto based company has 1800 screens in North America, which means that most of them, in the words of Jay Leno, are “cement bunkers at the end of a mall”. Cineplex Odeon was the first chain to charge $7 for tickets a few years ago. I don’t mind paying that much if the movie is good and the theatre is big (when in Manhattan try to see a movie at the 1200 seat Ziegfield on 54th St. or the 1500 seat Loews Astor in Times Sq.), but I try and avoid high priced theatres with small screens. At the bargain Chex price we decided it might be worth it, so headed for an Odeon. The theatre’s air conditioning didn’t work, but the movie, HEATHERS was good and we got in for $3 each. I ate more Rice Checks than usual, and saved the coupons. Meanwhile Cineplex Odeon raised their tickets to S7.50 (other theatres are sure to follow), and all the record breaking summer blockbuster movies were released. The small print on the coupons says “alows you to purchase movie tickets for only $3 versus the normal full admission price- up to $7” and “except for No Pass, No Coupon Engagements”. Cineplex Odeon has 39 (!) screens in Manhattan and non of them are excepting coupons for their new summer movies. The coupons run out in September. What a scam. What a rotten company. I might switch to Musilex. Many readers have written asking where to buy or rent the tapes reviewed in PSYCHOTRONIC. Good question. First of all, I don’t sell tapes. I don’t even collect them. If you live in or near Manhattan, try the following (downtown) stores. KIMS (see ad on back). RARE BIRD (482 Broome St., New York, NY 10013, theyll send a catalog for postage - (212) 3344-81 50). SCIENCE FICTION AND HORROR EMPORIUM (74 W. 3td St., 10012, 212-260-5825). These places have good sections of cult and horror arities. If you want to rent better known tapes, TOWER stores (all over) can be good, because they stock multiple copies of many newer horror tapes and have a lot of unusual documentaries. Some of the tapes reviewed in these pages were rented in unlikely small independent neighborhood stores. Many small mal order companies sell rare low price (mosUy black and white public domain) tapes that you will not find in most stores. Some advertise in PSYCHOTRONIC. Write for their catalogs. SINISTER (PO Box 777, Padfica, CA 94044- (41 5-359-39292) has the largest seleaion of (older) rare tapes. One mail order company that sells nearly anything that had a legitimate release (not PD titles) is MARSHALL (Box 328, Tmnton, Michigan, 48183, (313) 671-5483- they sell catalogs), and VIDEO MANIA (see ad) has a great x’.ection of legit obscurities. One title several people asked about is DEADBEAT AT DAWN (reviewed in ?V =1). You can write to Asmodeus Production, 785 Qinton Springs, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45229 for info.

PSYCHOTRONIC - 3 LETTE*® GHOULARDI/GHOUL - Your article on GHOULARDI in PSYCHOTRONIC VIDEO #2 was lerriffic.- Mark D. Neel (Columbus)-Afflri(: wrote a full page letterlarticle about GHOULARDI published in Filmfax HIS, including some rare original newspaper advertisements I wish I owned, and the cover of the Ernie AndersonJTim Conway LP, Bull. He also sent copies of photos he took of Anderson and Big Chuck at a restaurant in New London, Ohio way back when. - The Ghoul was proto punk, obnoxious, violent. He used to call rival Detroit horror host Sir Graves Ghastly, “Sir Graves Greasy”, and Arthur Treachers Fish And Chips, “Carp And Barf’. T.M.Caldwell (Wyandotte, Michigan) - Your article on GHOULARDI was by far the most accurate and complete ever written.- (New bright green GHOULARDI bumper stickers came with this letter). - John Hlucky (Cleveland) Ruth Athoe (Long Beach, CAyThe she: .n Hoboken senes pilot film DREAM STREET had it’s premiere on SBC a moniks ago, so watch for a repeat. THE UNDERTAKER. OPERATIO'S 7X)SE. and RAPID FIRE are all expected on video soon. Wa:cn for K C KIPPERS on Cinemax or call them and demand another she Joe never made it to start LONE STAR MANIAC, and Tom is Cdrremly too busy working on BRIDE OF THE REANIMATOR to restan j »v:>% and who could replace Spinell?-By the way the name of the M.\\S!.AC music composer is Jay Chattaway, who recently provided a great score for ^'dLam Lustigs new movie, RELENTLESS, starring Judd Nelson ' ir j serial killer. Gary Heidnik is the P hilly killer that Joe was wn:.^: a so^>pt ab^out. - Congratultions on your new PSYCHOTRONIC magazine! It was especially gratifying to read the extensive Joe Spmell article. It was a fitting tribute to the hard working acict. Keep ir the g»d work! Frances Raines (NYC)- Frances starred in a g^ea: S^radway play called “Grindhouse” a few years ago, and ra: reen .n movies like THE MUTILATOR and BREEDERS. - Ron Swede, THE GHOUL in Cleveland (see PV#2) isn’t on TV anymore, but he still makes personal appearances. He recently sued The Son Of Ghoul, who is on TV in nearby Canton, Ohio- and lost. So the GHOULARDI character, created by Ernie Anderson in ‘63, lives on, sort of, in Canton, birthplace of The Ojays, who had a hit with the appropriate song, “For The Love Of Money” (now being misussed for a TV car commerial). Information from an article sent in and written by John Petrovic. Several writers asked about the rumor that GHOULARDI was taken off the air because he blew up a live frog on TV. People seem convinced that he did. He didn’t. 6i& GHOULARDI ° COPYRIGHT STORER BROADCASTING CO 1963 ■TOE SPINELL - The late Joe Spinell’s tirade against Tom Sa-.mi shocked me. 1 can’t recall ever reading such pure venom in a lif^ime of cciieciiEg pro/fanzines. To surprise me like that is difficult. Truly a ^nld mm. Nai Booet had the potential to ^ a scream queen in the tradition of Barbara Steeie. One hundred FRIDAY THE 13th/NIGHMARE actresses couldn’t equij her appeal. Jim Singer (Jackson Hts, NVyThere’s plenty (^‘usually wed hJden, venom in the film world. Actors and behind the scenes pe<DpU gOf>ng on about how they love working with each other is often nothing bu: dpic midc publicity. James also sent a great Nai clipping from a 79 Sew York Dady Sews. DAVIE ALLEN AND THE .ARROWS - At last an article (interview no less!) on Davie .Allan .And The Arrows!!! I’ve been an Arrows fan since the 60s., still got nrost of the soundtracks. I can recall futiley searching hi and lo for THE GLORY STOMPERS album. Finally in desperation, 1 wrote to .A.l.P. ai>d got a handwritten note back, “GLORY STOMPERS LP is Sl.OO”! Didn’t ;Ou forget to mention that the original (gatefold) WILD IN THE STREETS soundtrack was followed by THE ARROWS PLAY SONGS FROM WILD IN THE STREET LP? - Randy Palmer (Arlington, Virginia)- Yes. I missed that other WILD... album. Never even saw a copy. Other Arrows related info (from Brent Barker Jr., Brian D. Horwitz, Chris Pfouis. and Allan himself) - WILD... is on HBO/Cannon video (and is a must see by the way). MARY JANE is also on tape. In WILD ANGELS, the music played during the church party is Wild Orgy, not Bongo Party. The ANGEL DUST album was reviewed favorably in Rolling Stone (6/1/89) *‘The most extraordinary sixties compilation since the Nuggets series...” It includes five original Arrows soundtrack cuts. I also didn’t realize how many movies Republican Mike Curb ha^ produced. They include the new UP YOUR ALLEY with Ruth Buzzi and Linda Blair, THE RANCH, directed by Stella Stevens, and BODY SLAM (87) with John Astin and The Angry Samoans! When Curb was at MGM he took time to write the liner notes to the ZABRISKE POINT soundtrack! - Casey Kasem not only starred in GLORY STOMPERS, he was also the voice of Robin in 60s Batman cartoons. THE MAGIC GARDEN OF STANLEY SWEETHEART’S soundtrack is one of the worst of all time, also (women’s music folk singer) Holly Near has nude scenes with Don Johnson.- Regis Goatlips (S,¥,yThank you Mr. Goatlips. Holly Near was also in ANGEL, ANGEL DOWN WE GO (69). - Last week I picked up a copy of your great magazine and was blown away! I was really impressed by the Joe Spinell interview. It’s about time somebody wrote about that guy. He has always been one of my favorite character actors. When will some of those movies he made last year come out? How can I see K.O.KIPPERS? Did Tom Rainone get any footage of Joe in LONE STAR MANIAC? Is he going to finish the film without Joe? PSYCHOTRONIC#! - Received #1 and loved it. Here are some additions to your Karen Black bio.-The list included alternate and pre-release titles which I wont repeat here, and MR. HORN, a 79 CBS westernn. Karen Black movies PSYCHOTRONIC - 4 announced since the article are DEAD GIRLS DON’T DANCE and Tapped again. She was also in HELL KITTEN (!) (See letter below!) . Caught OUT OF THE DARK in Times Square. Black didn't have any scenes with Divine (who only has a few brief lines) but unlike the local sriTiCS. I thought the clown mask killer movie was above average. Watch for It on tape- A\\so GOD DAMN DR. SHAGETZ was released -(xerox of ad was inclosed)- before il was turned into EVIL TOWN. And last, but not least, you didn’t mention Wegee Walk by The Rivingtons (Liberty single) my personal favorite of all their great hits. Keep up the good work and go monthly as soon as you can. - Tom North (Carbondale, 111.) - Having finished your corrections and additions, I noticed you still have not discovered the most exciting musician in Ohio during the 80s, W'illie Phoenix. He’s originally from Marion in Northwest Ohio, and has recorded at least five albums. We Love Noise being the best. He is a nimble guitarist who looks like Bob Marley with a voice like South side Johnny. He has (recently) changed his style, playing Hendrix-ish acid rock (with his new group, The Flower Machine). This new sound has yet to catch on. It’s sad, because this guy is what blue collar rock is all about.- David Miles (L.A.)- Yes I left out Willie. Also missing from the Ohio music article in #7 was Cleveland’s Burning River Band, big favorites at biker bashes around the country. - 1 play keyboards for a living at an amusement park called Silver Dollar City. I’m part of the band that performs every evening in the amphitheater. The crowds are usually from 3500 to 400 people. Anyway, we play a medley of country hits, and the final song is Elvira, with the Papa Ooom Mow Mow chorus, sung by our bass player (Guinness Book Of World’s Records says he’s the lowest in the world, no shit!), so I guess I feel in my own small way. I’m helping to spread the word about the BIRD. - Jeff Olson (Branson, MO)- Also inclosed was an excellent recent newspaper article about music from and recorded in Minneapolis. - PSYCHOTRONIC VIDEO saved my life at work in a big downtown law office the other day. If it hadn’t broken up the day’s tedium by delving into the inner meaning of the Rivington’s lyrics, I surely would have died (and, of course, death is the legal end of billable time). - Bruce Townley (San Francisco) • Any media source that seems to thrive on The Cramps is OK by me. Their album THE SMELL OF FEMALE is one of my favorites and your article on OHIO music just goes to show that the Rock Hall Of Fame does belong in Geveland. “I don’t know about art, but I know what I like”. -Belka Stamas (Philadelphia) ETC. - 1 Enjoyed the 2nd issue very much. I’M GONNA GET YOU SUCKA finally opened here in April and you are definitely right about it. I found it to be very much in the Mel Brooks tradition. I’d never put a name to Joe Spinell’s face- his Savini rant is hilarious. A couple of corrections and comments: It’s Linnea Quigley not Liana; you have two erroneous Diane Lane mentions, on pg. 18 where she is said to be Bmce Dem’s wife (it’s Diane Ladd) and in The AROUSERS review which says she’s in THE BEDROOM WINDOW (she wasn’t, Elizabeth Megovem v/2is).-Oops! Lane recently finished a movie with her new husband, French star Christophe Lambert. Ladd will be in S.P.O.O.K.S.- Also some stuff regarding Harry Hurwitz (Tampa). I assume he did the softcore musical of Cinderella around the same time as FAIRYTALES (also with Sy Richardson?)-Ke/7-He also did a movie right after The PROJECTIONIST that never came out. Roy Frumkes, the producer and writer of STREET TRASH was an assistant on it (and THE PROJECTIONIST).-/ think that one was The Comeback TraiL-?.S.- Is The DOLL SQUAD on video? - Paul Sherman (Brookline, Mass.)- Sure is. - One of the best things about PSYCHOTRONIC VIDEO is that it doesn’t stick to video alone, but covers the whole PSYCHOTRONIC world! Hopefully it will be a success and can be published more frequently. In reading the Give Barker interview in #1 1 felt somewhat a kinship with Barker. As a child he couldn’t see horror films in the UK because they were rated X. I saw some in the theatre, but when I was a child in the early 60s we lived in a place that only got one TV channel! The station usually ran MGM musicals- pure agony for me! Eventually we moved in the mid 60s to an area that got all the New York City stations. For me it was a mind boggling experience. Here were all the films I’d dreamed about and more! What a variety! The movies turned my brain permanently PSYCHOTRONIC! I’m sorry that I never got to see Ghoulardi. There are two hosts that I can get now. Watching Commander U.S.A on the U.S.A cable channel is a thankless experience. On WVIA, a public station out of Penn., there’s Uncle Ted’s Monster Mania on friday nights. They run higher class science fiction classics... ‘‘Uncle Ted”, an old magician performs lame tricks and ‘‘Nephew Leo” laughs at it all. I look foreward to future issues. - Ron Wilbur (Liberty, NY) - No comics. No comics. Comic books died around 1969. Movies- that’s what matters. - Hugh Shelton (Centerline, MI) - In case you don’t know yet, the first two Paramount Warner Gland Fu Manchu films, THE MYSTERIOUS FU M ANCHU and THE RETURN OF DR. FU MANCHU are available from Startime Video, PO Box 1058, Lewisville, TX 75067 for $19.95 each and have pretty decent picture quality. I’m also ga-ga about Anna May Wong and have been collecting her films on video. My favorites are ISLAND OF LOST MEN, WHEN WERE YOU BORN? and LIMEHOUSE BLUES (with George Raft as a Chinese gangster!). I’m still looking for LADY FROM SHANGHAI and SHANGHAI EXPRESS. - Rich Maslan (Chicago)- SHANGHAI EXPRESS (‘32) which stars Marlena Dietrich, Anna May Wong and Warner Oland, directed by Joseph Von Sternberg is on Mystic Video. Orson Welles' LADY FROM SHANGHAI is on Columbia Video. - 1 can’t believe your loyal Canadian scout has actually managed to find a PSYCHOTRONIC film you missed! At least it’s not in the book. - THE DAY IT CAME TO EASTA (circa ‘65), directed by Harry Thomason. A victim of a gangland slaying is dumped in Miller’s Lake. Meteor lands in lake and activates the rotting corpse. George Gobel (in an incredibly bad stilted performance) is a professor and two college students take an interest. The walking corpse scares sorority girls, etc., etc.. A gem. Have you seen it? - Hank Davis (Puslinch, Ontario)- Never even heard of it. Thank you ! - 1 just discovered a gem in the video store where I work, ROOM 43. It’s about a prostitution ring run by Herbert Lorn. There’s drugs, thugs and delicious Diana Dors as a hooker with a grudge. It appears to shot in PSYCHOTRONIC - 5 Europe by a camera operator named Nick Roeg. -Stately Wayne Manor (I)rexel Hill, PA)- Yikes, that movie (which I’ve never seen) is PASSPORT TO SHAME (UK 58). I’ve got pictures of it in lloppla- I Her Komml Eddie!, the amazing Eddie Constantine book I was lucky enough to find in Munich. For more on Nicholas Roeg see this issues book reviews. Sonney is secretary' -treasurer.-/ think Film Ventures is the defunct company that distributed those films. -Enpyed Rainone’s story on poor Joe Spinell. Good interview. Also enjoyed the Karen Black story., the notes re HGL and me at the beginning of the piece KX)% accurate. Who dug. up all this old stuff? PRI.ME TI.ME is not lost, although it should be. When Mid-Continent Films (the corporation founded by Hershell to produce THE PRIME TIME and later. LIVING VENUS) went belly up, one of the principal stockholders took over the assets, including the negatives and existing prints of both pix. This was before I left Chi for LA, and Dan Sonney and I bought both pix for S5,000. 1 re -titled PRI.ME TLME to HELL KITTEN , and we played it off on the newly burgeoning nudie house wheel, turning a nice profit. Karen was still a student at Northwestern when this picture was made in ‘58. She had agreed to do a nude swimming scene and we shot it. The next day, her then boyfriend came to Hershell and me saying she had had second thoughts about the sequence, and that he would pay for another half day shooting if we’d use another girl, and destroy the negative of Karen’s buff footage. We agreed, the guy paid the tab which was considerable since we were making the film stricktly (union).Dan Sonney taught me one thing.. .no movie, no matter how bad doesn’t have some value, if not today maybe tomorrow, maybe ten years from now. He was certainly right. 20 years ago no-one ever dreamed of something called video. I’m enjoying semi-retirement in my home town, busy writing YOUTH IN BABYLON, about how an innocent little Alabama boy got involved with Nightmare Alley carnivals, binh-of-a baby roadshow movies, gore films, nudies, and other disreputable devices designed to separate suckers from scratch- David F. Friedman (Anniston, Alabama)- Friedman, the man who produced BLOOD FEAST, also sent me some amazing pressbooks and a signed poster for his TRADER HORN EE, which I told him I had seen when in high school! For more on Friedman’s one time partner, Hershell Gordon Lewis, see the book review section. Starring DOUGLAS FREY-ROBYN WHITTING -PENNY BORAN With JOHN ALDERMAN - JUDE FARESE ■ Guest Star ROBERT W.

INC © EVI ■■■J - Here is information on Larry Buchanan’s GOODNIGHT, SWEET MARILYN (flyer enclosed). Note the casting of Misty Rowe (HEE HAW, THE HITCHIKERS...) as Marilyn, a particularly inspired PSYCHOTRONIC touch. -David Szulkin (New York)- Misty Rowe also starred in Buchdpan’s GOODBYE: NORMA JEAN (’76), so this promised new docudrama by the director of DOWN ON US, is a sequel. - In a future issue, your readership might enjoy a feature on Pam Grier in view of Orion Video’s recent release of five of her biggest hits. -Sean Reynolds (Silver Spring, SMjyPSYCHOTRONIC hopes to run a new Grier interview in a future issue. She recently co-starred in ABOVE THE LAW. Meanwhile see the this issue for an interview with her frequent co-star, Sid Haig! - Do you have the following videos for sale? THE EXECUTIONER (martial arts movie with Sonny Chiba). THE INCIDENT (Martin Sheen and Tony Musante play punks terrorizing subway riders). - Patrick H. Flynn (Astoria)- I'm not aware of a Jackie Chan movie called THE EXECUTIONER, but there are several tapes out there with the same name. THE INCIDENT hasn’t been released. We had to watch that one when I was in highschool, as part of a real life movies to scare the kids campaign. Maybe it was to keep us away from Manhattan. Didn’t work. By the way, I don’t sell tapes. - I have the PSYCHOTRONIC ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FILM in which you have immortalized in picture and prose several of my old movies. PEF is a fine reference work, Congratulations! Correction requested in PV#2- letters. Entertainment Ventures Inc. did not distribute SAGA OF DRACULA and VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES, nor is FVI defunct. It is a California company., of which I am president and Dan - You have got to tell me the title and origin of an incredibly sleazy exploitation film released in ‘75 or ‘76. In the final scene a woman is being threatened by her boyfriend (husband?), so her little girl shoots and kills him. The audience received paper ballots before the screening and on the way out, in the lobby, they voted whether the little girl was guilty or innocent (the title?). I talked my father into taking me to see it because they had left flyers on all the windshields in the neighborhood shopping center- George Maranville (Lexington, Kentucky)-5(?u/uiy like the Lana Turner story by William Castle. No, I don’t know. Does anybody out there? - Speaking of Rosanne Katon, Players magazine did an entire career article and interview with her in ‘85, discussing her film and singing career. I recently spotted her on an episode of the syndicated “Divorce Court’’ show, as a scheming voodoo priestess plaintiff. (!) EBONY, IVORY AND JADE was also a crummy ‘77 TV pilot movie with Burt Convy. C. Bock (Pensacola, ¥\\or\\&d)-That TV movie also featured Frankie Valli as himself. MOYV PSYCHOTRONIC - 6 THRIU-CRAZED SPACE KIDS BLASTING THE FLESH OFF HOMANS! qtmefang PRESENTS psycbotronic video!

Flushing, N.Y. 11375 psychotronk: ■ i HENRY- PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER (MPI ‘86) D/co-s John McNaughton, S Richard Fire, P Lisa Dedmond, Steve Jones Several people went out of their way to tell me about this movie. I was very suspicious - until I saw it. It’s excellent, one of most disturbing and well made features Fve seen, and it was shot on 16mm in Chicago. The chilling, but all too believable story is based loosely on real life killer Henry Lee Lucas. The only film that you could maybe compare it to is IN COLD BLOOD (*67), but without recognizable actors like Robert Blake, and even more important- without the killer being caught. The MPAA gave it an X rating, not for sex or violence (it includes both), but for “general tone”. The delayed video release is unrated. Henry (Michael Rookes) is a curly haired, emotionless, illiterate part time exterminator who had killed his own mother, and lives by the moto, “It’s either you or them.”. He’s addicted to killing, knows it’s easy to get away with, and carefully plans the murders, using different methods each time- “It’s always the same and it’s always different”. His roommate is a dense, crude and impressionable drug dealer TV addict named Otis (Tom Towles). Both are ex -cons. Otis’ blue eyed blonde sister Becky (Tracy Arnold)- (“Did you really kill your mama?”) leaves her husband and moves in with the deadly duo, landing a job as a shampoo girl. In a film loaded with shocking scenes, the most disturbing to me was the killers watching themselves at work, repeatedly and in slow motion on video. Talk about violence as pornography! The music, cinematography, dialog, acting, direction and special effects are all top notch. Only the inclusion of the (great) song “Psycho” by The Sonics seemed a little too obvious. Since playing HENRY so convincingly, Rookes has acted in the major releases EIGHT MEN OUT and MISSISSIPPI BURNING in support roles. McNaughton went to Hollywood to direct THE BORROWER, a movie about cannibal aliens, with Towles, Rac Dong Chong, and Antonio Fargas. If it’s half as good as Henry, it’ll be better than most anything else made recently. THE LAUGHING DEAD (video release soon ‘89) Exec. P/D/S/music/act J.T. Somtow (Somtow Sucharitkul), P Lex Nakashima The first directing effort of Somtow, a novelist from Thailand (“Mall World” TOR books...), is a wild, shot on location talc of present day Mayan Indian sacrifices. This low budget feature has excellent music and cinematography, an interesting plot and lots of surprising special effects. A busfull or people from Tucson, Arizona go to Oaxaca, Mexico to sec the festival of the dead. Tim Sullivan, another writer (who was also the associate producer) docs a good job starring as the troubled Father O’Sullivan of The Sacred Heart Catholic Church, the guide for the trip. Also along is his secret lover (an ex-nun) and their son (“It’s all your fuckin’ fault, preacher dude!”), a “new age” couple (complete with crystals), an Oriental girl escaping from a brutal father, a hippy driver, and a jerk in a yellow suit who tells dirty jokes. Dr. Um Tzeck (Somtow), a professor with a computer who plays classical music, leads the Mayans in their pagan sacrifices. Hearts are cut out, heads decapitated or crushed, and a ripped off arm is shoved down somebody’s throat. There’s a cave of zombies, shocking dreams, and two characters that turn into big reptilian monsters. Some of the effect scenes (by busy John Buechler and crew) are well done, unique firsts that people are going to be talking about, while a few are shown too long or are unconvincing. THE LAUGHING DEAD is a lot of fun for horror fans and one of the best independent productions in a while. I was dissapointed when Somtow (inspired by EVIL DEAD II ?) switched to all out comedy, after a great serious build up, but I’m sure others will love it that way. I didn’t recognize him, but Forry Ackerman plays a corpse. THE BRAIN (IVE ‘88) D Edward Hunt, S Barry Pearson, P Anthony Kramreither DAVID GALE (Dr. Hill from REANIMATOR) is back as Dr. Blake, the local TV host of “Independent Thinkers” on Ch. 9. He commands a giant killer brain, and brainwashes the locals, causing them to hallucinate, commit murders and suicide. James, a highschool troublemaker with a high I.Q., is sent to the celebrity doctor by his parents. Mom says “Dr. Blake wouldn’t be on TV If he wasn’t good!”. James has electrodes attached to his head and imagines the female assistant topless. Soon he’s hallucinating like crazy, and on the run with his blonde girlfriend who works at a 7-11 type store, trying to warn the people busy watching Blake on TV. This movie iwrrows ideas from David Cronenberg (as did Hunt’s PLAGUE,’77), INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, STRANGE INVADERS, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and even FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, but it’s one of the most fun action packed science fiction/horror movies in a long time. Some of the low budget special effects are well done, but others are laughable. The brain becomes a big scary floating face with moveable teeth tliat eats people whole, people are decapitated and characters have surprizing hallucinations. Filmed in Toronto, and presented by Shapiro/Glickenhaus. The Canadian Ed Hunt also directed the wild STARSHIP INVASIONS (‘77) which featured an alien suicide ray. This tape includes trailers for the less interesting RED HEAT and IRON EAGLE II. pfivrtinTonMir o KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE (Media ‘88) P/D/S Stephen Chiodo, P/S Charles Chiodo, P Edward Chiodo This oddball PG-13 rated take off of 50’s drive-in science fiction Tjovies starts with a comet landing in the woods that turns out to be a :rcus tent. The interior resembles a set from the LOST IN SPACE series and it’s filled with alien clowns of all sizes with ray guns and electric voices, who spin cotton candy cocoons around human victims! The plots closely follows THE BLOB, as some teens who oow what’s going on, can’t convince the local authorities. Even ±ough this movie drags a lot in spots, it has a great concept, good special effects and some inspired moments. A clown makes a balloon sculpture hunting dog, a tiny clown on a bike is harassed by bikers and knocks the leader’s head off, and a giant scary clown attacks. Some goofy comedy relief brothers in an ice cream truck come to the rescue. Royal Dano (a character actor recently wasted in HOUSE n and GHOULIES II) is a backwoods victim and sleaze great John Vernon plays the hateful Officer Mooney. The unique California band. The Dickies, provide a great theme song, and after the end credits do it again in a rock video. The song is on their Killer Klowns E.P. (Enigma). This tape includes trailers for STICKY FINGERS and Dennis Hopper in LET IT ROCK (White Star). 80s VAMPIRES There have been more vampire movies than any other type of horror movies. Vampire movie sequels, remakes, and comedies were being made before most of us were born. Every possible angle has been used and re-used. Here are some recent vampire tapes. None of them are must see items, but none of them irritated me as much as a recent theatrical release, VAMPIRE* S KISS (staring Francis Ford Coppolas overacting nephew Nicholas Cage), which actually received some good reviews. DRACULA’S WIDOW (HBO ‘88) D/S Christopher Coppola, P Stephen Traxler Another Coppola nephew vampire movie. Made for Dino De Laurentis just before his companay went bust, it stars the Dutch bom Sylvia Kristel, who was the original EMMANUELLE back in ‘73. A young guy runs a wax museum on Hollywood Blvd. and spends spare time watching an 8him print of the silent NOSFERATU. Sylvia, the vampire lady (with a black wig) is delivered (just like in ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN), wakes and bites him to use as a servant. “Who’s your husband?” “Dracula, you fool!” Usually she just kills people, becoming an ugly faced monster, ripping bodies apart, and sometimes becomes a bat. They go to a Satanic Mass (complete with topless virgin sacrifice) and she slaughters everybody. A cop, who also narrates, his dumb assistant, and an old man named Helsing hunt for the killer. With very somber music, some gore, a strange mechanical bat, Marc Coppola, and too many trendy blue and red lights. Kristel was also recently in THE BIG BET, directed by Bert I. Gordon. THE MIDNIGHT HOUR (Vidmark ‘85) D Jack Bender, S Bill Bleich So many video releases are of unknown origin, I figured this was just one of many horror movies that I somehow missed even hearing about. Actually it’s an ABC TV movie, made, no doubt, to cash in on the popularity of Michael Jackson’s Thriller. A fun enough movie for kids, or undemanding adults, this is a good example of just how much horror has been accepted, mixed up, and tamed by the mainstream. In a small Massachusets town on Halloween, a group of students (who all look to old for the parts) accidently unlease Lucinda, a black witch/vampire who had been hung in the 18th century, and a graveyard full of zombies. It all happens because these “nice” kids decide to break into a museum and “borrow” some authentic costumes for a party. Graves explode and the living dead emerge Thriller -style. One perfectly preserved blonde 50s cheerleader provides a love interest and comments about how things have changed for the worse. Make-up and effects by The Tom Burman studios are typically good. Several scenes are rock video style. Star Shari Belafonte Harper dances and sings “Let’s Get Dead” after becoming a vampire. The best scene is when she’s bitten in the wine cellar. Wine spurts all over in slow motion, while “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths plays(!) The soundtrack has mostly old hits , “Litle Red Riding Hood” by Sam The Sham And The Pharaohs, the great but overused “Bad Moon Rising”, and others.The cast includes Levar Burton (who also becomes a vampire), Kevin McCarthy (who becomes a zombie), Dick Van Patton, Kurtwood Smith (from ROBOCOP) and a couple of less famous relatives of other actors. The horror/comedy mixture includes a werewolf, a midget zombie, and the voice of Wolfman Jack. One of the trailers at the end is for WITCHERY with Linda Blair. DANCE OF THE DAMNED (Virgin ‘89) D/S Katt Shea Ruben, P/S Andy Ruben A few years ago Katt Shea was acting in cheap movies for Chuck Vincent (PREPPIES) and Roger Corman (THE DEVASTATOR). Corman, in his typical fashion, gave her a chance to direct STRIPPED TO KILL (87) starring Kay Lenz. It made money on video, so she got to direct a sequel, a movie called DAWN, and this lower budgeted direct to video vampire movie using the same Corman sets in Venice used in the Strip films. At Cafe Paradise where topless dancers seem to be in FLASHDANCE outakes, Cyril PSYCHOTRONIC - 9 A distort *<1 world ccin^s to life forbidden secret5 ftonsJtlonanv reveolod! w.ih JOHNNV S£KKA ALEX OAVION MADFUNf HINOf PATRICK MOWIR (MOGFN HASr, ALL • WILLIAM MERVYN CO^O^ ws MOV1I .

He offers the (suicidal) young woman $1(X)0 to talk. They take a bus, go to the beach, then to his pad. The caring vampire, who has an exercise bike and hates cigarette smoke, cries and talks about his bitter life. She claims her best friend was her Barbie doll. Except for scenes where bulldts pop out of his chest and a skinhead attack on the bus, this is an actionless, bloodless rip off of Interview With A Vampire, and is almost as irritating as VAMPIRE’S KISS. The tape includes a trailer for RETRIBUTION. onscreen, and North is shown in a wild rock dance segment and a famous ‘53 bikini dance short later sold through the mail. These scenes, and North herself (last seen in MANIAC COP) show why she should be better known and work more often. Fonda, whose tell all book should be publi.shcd pretty soon, is seen on Hollywood Boulevard (and coping in EASY RIDER). Trailers are shown for COCAINE FIENDS, REEFER MADNESS, and SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT (versions with and without Santa). Caroll Baker and Eli Wallach discuss BABY DOLL (“the dirtiest film ever!”), and Martin Scorsese talks about TAXI DRIVER and PEEPING TOM, which he first saw, uncut on New York’s Fright Night show! While showing scenes from BLOOD FEAST, Fonda yells “Cut! Cut!”, looking away in disgust. While some of the public domain footage shown will be overly familiar to some collectors, this is a very entertaining tape you’ll probably wish was longer. Trailers at the end include LADY BEWARE and RATE IT X. BRITISH VAMPIRES, WITH AVENGERS^ STARS BLOOD SUCKERS (Incense For The Damned) (VCL ‘70) D Robert Hartford-Davies, P Graham Harris, S Julian More Based on the novel “Doctors Wear Scarlet” by Simon Raven, this is a very different vampire feature, which, because of the sex theme and nudity was released as an exploitation movie in America, then forgotten until this video release. A narrator relates the story of how “I was asked to investigate” the whereabouts of Richard, an Oxford student missing in Greece. He flies to Greece with Richard’s fiance and school friend (African actor Johnny Seka). They’re joined by an embassy official (Patrick Macnee, in-between Avengers series). It turns out that Richard is a masochistic virgin, an easy victim of a sadistic female “vampire” who has sex and drug orgies. Hartford-Davies also directed the swinging London horror movie CORRUPTION (‘67), and this more serious effort is also padded with a long psychedelic orgy sequence with lots of warped lead guitar sounds and somebody singing “baby, don’t flash your evil eyes at me!...” HOLLYWOOD UNCENSORED (IVE ‘87) D/S James Forsher, S Leith Adams, Barbara Myers, Beverly Stanley, P Julian Schlossberg This light but fun documentary about censorship is divided into two parts. The hosts are two sons of more famous stars. A cheerful Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (last seen in GHOST STORY), covers the 30s through the 50s, and Peter Fonda (whose daughter Bridget is a bigger star these days) takes us up to the 80s and covers drug films. Early highlights are three great KING KONG scenes that were unseen for decades and amazing for the time topless scenes from the European version of HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL, and Reagan with Jayne Mansfield at an awards ceremony. Trailers for LOVE LIFE OF A GORILLA and SEX MADNESS are included along with surprizing pre-code scenes with Barbara Stanwyck, Mae West, W.C. Fields and Shirley Temple playing a sexy adult. Jane Russell, Don Murray (who has made religious themed films and wants restrictions), Mamie Van Doren (also seen in GIRL’S TOWN), and Sherry North reminisce Ulli Lommel’s TENDERNESS OF THE WOLVES (‘73), and Romero’s MARTIN (‘76) later explored some of the same real vampire ideas. Top billed Peter Cushing actually has a support role as an Oxford Professor, but is in one great scenes when Richard, back in England, almost causes a riot by giving an anti -academic sp^h. A surprisingly thin Edward Woodward (whose EQUALIZER series was just cancelled) has one scene as an expert who talks about how a person could achive an orgasm, having their neck sucked. Originally released in America on a double bill with BLOOD THIRST, an obscure Phillipines horror movie. A trailer for KILLER’S MOON follows the film. THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA (Count Dracula And His Vampire Bride) (Liberty/ABC ‘73) D Alan Gibson, P Roy Skeggs, S Don Houghtonh In America,, the last Hammer Dracula film starring Christopher Lee was shelved by Warner Brothers, announced to be released by A.I.P., then over five years later was badly released by the independent Dynamite company with an R rating. A satanic cult made PSYCIIOTRONIC - JO zp of rich influential men gets hold of a deadly plauge bacteria. The nit seems to be run by an Oriental woman with a dragon jacket Barbara Yu-Ling), who commands a group of biker thug snipers in fur '.ests! A nude blonde on a sacrificial alter becomes a vampire. More female vampires are kept chained in the basement Dracula, the real villain, disguised as the Howard Hughes style D.D. Denham, runs a luge corporation and wants the “supreme blasphemy” - armageddon! Unfortunately most of the movie's deaths are by guns, and this ultimate horror theme is wasted. Peter Cushing shows up as Van Helsing again and pre-Avengers Joanna Lumley is his daughter. It seems like she’ll be the new vampire hunter heroine, but she proofs to be useless and a government agent who didn’t even believe in vampires, instantly knows how to kill them with a stake. Lee’s European accent comes and goes, and after the promise of a great conspiracy theme movie, his last on screen vampire death is caused by a thorn bush. It’s great to have ±is once rare movie available but for me it was pretty disappointing, and the tape I rented was jumpy and scratchy. CHRISTOPHER CUSHINC WrCRrANWiNT MORE LOCAL ROCK EPICS DESPERATE TEENAGE LOVE DOLLS (Hollywood Home Theatre ‘84) P/D/S... Dave Markey, P/S/act Jordan Shwartz, S/star Jennifer Shwartz The success of this hour long do it yourself 8mm to video tape classic was the inspiration for TWISTED ISSUES, ROCK AND ROLL MOBSTER GIRLS and other local rock movies. Although it’s one of the cheapest (the original cost was said to be $250!), LOVE DOLLS has more spirit, better music, and is funnier than the others. Filmed in and near Hollywood, this is the story of the rise and fall of Bunny (Hilary Rubens), Kitty (Jennifer Schwartz, the producers sister) and Patch, a likeable female gang/rock group who record a hit single (“Come On Up To Me”), but end up killing several people. An original member, Alexandria escapes from a mental hospital after killing her doctor with a a guitar, starts shooting up and has to be replaced. Kitty’s mother (played by the producer, who also was the doctor) says “I try to be a mother and father to you!”. Her rebellious daughter answers, “Well go fuck yourself then!”. The She Devils, a murdering rival gang led by Tanya Hearst (Tracy Lea) causes trouble, and the Love Dolls drug their sleazy manager (Jeff McDonald of Redd Kross), who has a bad trip and is attacked by Felix the cat. The original soundtrack apparently included lots of actual famous records by Blue Cheer, Sweet, The Seeds and others. Nobody bothered to pay the rights to use them so the records were replaced by other new songs (or cover versions), but many of the familiar original intros remain, a great disorienting (accidental) concept. A soundtrack album (on SST) features Redd Kross (their theme song is a classic!) who also back the Love Dolls, Black Rag and others. LOVE DOLLS SUPERSTAR (SST ‘86) P/D/S Markey, S Jennifer Schwartz, McDonald Brothers In this welcome sequel, the Love Dolls reform and “climb back from the bottom”, Tracy Lea shows up as the mother of Tanya, who was killed in the first film, and Steve McDonald (also of Redd Kross) as a “freedom school” hippy shows up to avenge the death of his brother. Plotwise, things gets a lot more out there than in DESPERATE TEENAGE LOVE DOLLS. Bunny returns as a ghost, Alexandria is a hooker, Bruce Springsteen is assassinated by a guy possessed by a Kiss doll(!). Patch starts a new religion, and the Love Dolls massacre their own fans Jonestown style (at Bronson Canyon, used in ROBOT MONSTER, IT CONQUERED THE WORLD and countless other movies), then head for outer space! There’s also a funny hard core punk band take-off. The SST soundtrack uses the same great groups again plus Sonic Youth and others. Any rock movie that mixes references to Billy Jack, Manson, and Jim Jones is alright with me, even though I liked the original better. How about part three? Both tapes are rentable in better video stores, or can be ordered for $22.50 each from We Got The Power Films, 3017 Santa Monica Blvd. #314, Santa Monica, CA 90404. Last issue there was a review of TWISTED ISSUES a video from Gainsville, Florida. Charles Pinion sent more about TWISTED ISSUES -If you order the video tape ($15 ppd., $20 foreign), you also get a cassette of music by 20 Gainsville, Florida bands heard and! or seen in the video and a booklet. An article from an '88 issue of Creem says \"The U. of Florida is our major industry, with marijuana farming and general drug trafficing running a close second- and every time somebody checks, we end up on the national Top Five list for most murders per capita or increased crime rate or worst poverty level. A tremendous crack problem goes unchecked, but try riding a bicycle at night without a headlight...\" and goes on to tell about Dolrums, Ilellwitch and the others on the tape. Order from Pinion at FO Box 1261, Canal St. Station I00I3. Here are more local rock iztne videos that are parodies of older exploitation movies. ROCK AND ROLL MOBSTER GIRLS (Demolition ‘88) D/S/ed Rick Werner, P/story/act Fred Hopkins Up north in Seattle, “back in the early 80s” the five member DOLL SQUAD, led by Linx Lapaz, can’t find work and have to eat food from restaurant dumpsters. They decide to sign with a notorious psychotic local promoter, Bruno Multrock, played convincingly by producer Hopkins, often seen reading the Rocket, a paper he writes the Mondo Video column for. Filmed in “perform-vision” in part documentary style, local rock stars are interviewed and bands play in clubs in-between plot segments. Scott McCaughey from The Young Fresh Fellows (talking about a Crow album) and Jeff Simmons (who did the Straight label soundtrack for THE NAKED ANGELS) are interview highlights. One band plays The Arrow’s “Blue’s Theme”. PSYCIIOTRONIC - n Chcczy MOR organ music is usually heard in the background. An effective dream sequence is old home movies and crude animation attempts and long narrated scenes of cars on a highway seem to be a nod to GLEN OR GLENDA. Bruno has people butchered, talks to his brother’s head (“Remember Lloyd Thaxton!?”), and at the end, his decapitated body still makes the rounds of clubs. The Doll Squad do one entire song, “Psycho Girls” in a studio. At one point some people are stuck listening to a mutant landlord rant for what seems like an hour, a title says “15 minutes later” and he continues. Funny idea, but what this tape desperately needed was a real editor. Unless you’re part of the Seattle scene yourself, you’ll wish it was half as long. Tapes are $28 (pp) from BACKTRACK VIDEO, 5339 25th NE, Seatae,WA, 98115 MORE ROGER CORMAN MOVIES GUNSLINGER (Kartes ‘56) P/D Roger Corman, S Charles Griffith When Roger Corman started his career as a director, it wasn’t making the science fiction or horror movies he’s known for. His first feature was FIVE GUNS WEST (‘55) and he made three more wacky westerns for A.R.C. (the company that became A.I.P.) during a period of 18 months. GUNSLINGER, Corman’s last western was made in seven days (it went one day over schedule) and is in color. It borrows a lot from Nicolas Ray’s JOHNNY GUITAR (‘54), but then so did ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. It opens with arty 50s modem titles and jazz music! If you’re a Corman fan who likes to see his regular stock of actors in anything (like me), you’ll love it. If you’re looking for a good western, forget it! Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becomes sheriff after her husband (William Schallert) is gunned down. She guns down the killers during the funeral and sleeps in a jail cell. Erica Page (Allison Hayes) runs the local bar and uses her pathetic, lovesick barkeep (Jonathon Haze) to murder people in the way of her get -rich -when -the railroad- arrives plan. “Little man, you’re too stupid!”, she tells him many times. Page also hires Cane (John Ireland), a brooding killer who wears all black, and orders him to kill Rose, who he’s in love with. Garland, who Ireland calls “that chesty marshall”, gets to punch out Hayes during a cat fight. The set looks like a ghost town and the cast is minimal. Three dancing girls do the same act several times. We see two tables of spectators, but hear what sounds like hundreds, of loud people. Dick Miller is with the pony express, and Bruno VeSota plays a businessman. The beginning of the tape is in pretty bad shape, but it gets better. Garland starred in five early Corman movies (including NOT OF THIS EARTH). From ‘69 to ‘72 she was the step mother on MY THREE SONS. She owns two hotels in California. NOT OF THIS EARTH (MGM/UA ‘88) P/D/S Jim Wynorski, P Murray Miller, S R J. Robinson After making sequels to the Corman productions DEATHSTALKER and BIG BAD MAMA, Wynorsky, once an ad director at Corman’s New World, quickly made this cheap (of course) remake of NOT OF THIS EARTH. It opens with lots of great, but completely unrelated scenes from New World his like PIRANHA, HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, GALAXY OF TERROR... and even THE TERROR from A.I.P., and goes on to incorporate cost cutting scenes from other movies during the story, which is exactly the same as the ‘56 version. Except for Corman fans, not many people would have cared about this tape if it wasn’t for Traci Lords, from Steubenville, Ohio. A popular, pouty, and enthusiastic hard core pom star from ‘84 to ‘86, dozens of tapes she was in were recalled in ‘86, the year when she (supposedly) turned 18. All those tapes, banned in America, are still available in Europe. (A recent Variety article claimed that she might have just pretended to have been underage and planned the whole scandal to further her career, a brilliant and subversive move if it’s true). She then starred in TRACI, I LOVE YOU (‘87), her last, only legal, (and of course best selling) X rated tape, attended Strasberg acting classes, was a guest on WISE GUY, accepted an MTV award for GUNS ‘N’ ROSES and starred in NOT OF THIS EARTH, one of the best stocked tapes in most video chain stores. After all the jokes and publicity, she’s fine as the nurse working for an alien vampire. She has one major nude scene after a bath, but in every other (long) shot, high heels appear on her feet. The director substituted hookers for bums to put in the matter transformer, made the alien in a closet a hippy, and added a female alien in punk clothes, otherwise it’s the same characters and story with less interesting actors and direction. It’s too bad that the superior original (an Allied Artist release) is so hard to locate on tape (Lorimar owns the rights). Meanwhile, FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND, Corman’s first movie as director since 1970 should be out soon, and Traci’s mainstream career is doing fine. She’s in John Water’s CRY BABY, was in FAST FOOD (with Jim “Ernest” Varney) and was announced to be in ZOMBIE COP with Iggy Pop! ANGELS HARD AS THEY COME (Avco Embassy ‘71) D/co-S Joe Viola, P/co-S Jonathan Demme Scott Glenn stars as Long John, a sullen, bored pill dealing Hell’s Angel. He arrives with a friend on EASY RIDER style bikes at Lost Cause, a ghost town where The Dragons, led by the sadistic “General” (Charles Dierkop from The Police Woman series) wearing a WWI German helmet, party with terrified hippies. He saves a blonde (who had asked “What about Altamont?” and brought up Manson’s riame) from being raped, but she dies from a stab wound. He and two others are blamed, jailed, put on trial, found guilty and dragged behind bikes and generally degraded. It all ends in a violent all out battle when fellow Angels arrive. This was the first feature credit for Demme, who says the plot was lifted from RASHOMON. It was originally released by Corman’s New World and was Glenn’s second feature (he was in THE BABY MAKER with Barbara Hershey first). It was also the first film with Gary Busey, who plays a peaceful hippy. Busey, who was once a sidekick to a Tulsa, Oklahoma TV horror host, probably got his first screen acting job because he was the drummer for “Carp”, who did the soundtrack of OK instrumental rock. Carp had an album on Epic around the same time. He made the news last year by wiping out on a Harley, but survived and announced that he’s still “pro choice” about helmet laws. With James Iglehart and Sharon Peckinpah. Demme and director Viola also made THE HOT BOX for New World in ‘72. PSYCHOTRONIC - 12 MORE RECENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS (South Gate ‘89) P/D/S Christopher Reynolds I never thought I’d see horror movies from Oklahoma, but jiere’ve been several lately. My grandfather, who moved there not ong after the territory became a state, would not be amused. This ?ne is a HALLOWEEN copy. Johnny, a traumatized kid who won’t -ilk is badgered by his ugly, scary mom in curlers, “You’re sick!”, .hen taunted by other kids and falls in a well. “Ten years later”, he’s sedated in a sanitarium, kills a nurse with a syringe, and escapes to become a cannibalistic serial killer, cutting up victims offscreen) and leaving body parts for the one girl who was his childhood friend. Characters watching TV say “This shew is boring”, and “It’s stupid”, dialog that’s really begging to be applied 10 this tape. A dumb sheriff wondering about a bloody ear or a nose found inside a newspaper just doesn’t have the same effect as BLUE VELVET. I loved the authentic local version of Valley talk though. WITCHCRAFT (Academy ‘88) D Robert Spera, S Jody Savan, P Megan Barnett, Yoran Barzilai This one has some ideas from ROSEMARY’S BABY and opens with scenes of a woman giving birth, intercut with a witch burning. A new “Polish” mother (Anat Topol Barlai, married in real life to the producer maybe?) reluctantly joins her husband and moves in with her mother-in-law after their house mysteriously bums down. The house includes a mute, zombie like butler, weird visiting old people and DARK SHADOWS style lightning outside the windows. The grandmother (“Have some more teal”) keeps taking the baby away, and in a dream, eats a dog (?). A visiting Catholic father has a burning vision and pukes. This slow moving movie filmed in California has a decapitation, suicide and lots of ridiculous false scares. It also has trailers for a reincarnation movie called RETURN and WHITE HEAT, a drug movie directed by Robbie Benson! DOOM ASYLUM (Academy ‘87) D/S Richard Friedman, S Rick Marx, P Steve Menkin A couple drinking and driving while listening to a bad version of “House Of The Rising Sun” crash. Badly burned and thought to be dead, the guy kills the autopsy doctor and “ten years later” the rotting lovesick killer says dumb “Freddy” type wisecracks while killing teens (usually offscreen) in an abandoned asylum. This tape is a New York area horror/comedy and has a few laughs and interesting characters. “Tina And The Tots” a female band in leather skirts play tape loop/scream/noise music in the old building. Tina is Ruth Collins who has been in a lot of Chuck Vincent movies. Patty Mullen is the best bandmember though. She’s a vicious fighter, has an incredible laugh (and a topless scene). Both of them were in Playboy or Penthouse, a fact pointed out on the video box. The contrasting victims include a shrink’s daughter, a baseball card '.'ollecting nerd, and an indecisive guy. The movie must have been :ss than an hour long before they added repeated slow motion fhots of the black band member’s romantic fantasy and scenes from ^:id Slaughter movies on a TV. Slaughter was a unique old :_5hioned British horror star in the 30s and 40s. Some of his movies -T; dui on Rhino tapes, but if you want a good sampler, this movie jdes long clips (the best scenes) from 5 of his movies! And if . : - like the music in the new part of this tape, ‘Tormented” by ' rhodrama is available on the “You’ll Hate This Record Record”, . : -plete with real plastic puke on the cover! SLAVE GIRLS FROM BEYOND INFINITY (Urban Classics ‘87) P/D/S Ken Dixon, P John Eng, Mark Wolf This slow, talky science fiction adventure version of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is about two blonde slaves in bikinis who escape in a rocket ship and wake up on an island. The villain, wearing all black, has a castle, a laser crossbow and twin robots who decapitate people. John Buechler provided special effects. The women (including Elizabeth Cayton and Brinke Stevens, who have both been in too many of these kind of movies lately) go topless once in a while to try and relieve the boredom. “Fate sure weaves a curious tapestry!”. Joyce Godenzi in EASTERN CONDORS. EASTERN CONDORS (Paragon ‘86) D/star Samo Hung This large scale, subtitled Hong Kong action movie shot in the Philippines, borrows ideas from THE DIRTY DOZEN, DEER HUNTER, GUNS OF NAVARONE and even DR. NO., so there’s a lot going on. Set in 1976, it’s about a Chinese/American squat team (led by the director, a comic co-star of some of Jackie Chan’s best movies) sent to destroy a secret US arsenal left behind in Viet Nam- before the Viet Cong can use it. They take their pick from prisoners, then team up with three Cambodian female guerillas, led by Joyce Godenzi (a former Miss Hong Kong). Yuen Biao, an impishly handsome comical young fighting star is a black market hero who defects and joins them. Biao (and others) use martial arts, but most of the fighting is with machine guns and explosives. The Oscar winning Haing S. Ngor (THE KILLING FIELDS) plays a shell shocked local and there is some surprising political humor. My favorite of many insults is “Nonsense masturbator!” Like most of the better Chinese language movies, it played in Chinatown theatres unadvertised in English language papers, and is now available wherever Chinese videos are rented. ~ rCUDEKATRONJC - 13 CAPK COPY CENTER VIDEO Pre-recorded tapes for sale.

PSYCHOTRONIC - 15 ■BOOKS THE COLLECTOR’S GUIDE TO MONSTER, SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY FILM MAGAZINES (Imagine Inc. $9.95) Bob Michelucci This is a new updated edition of a now rare 1977 book. I preferred the original (more color, less 70s science fiction), but this 200 plus page guide is a must for anyone who seriously collects horror or sci/fi movie magazines. All issues of virtually every English language pro magazine that fits the title’s description, from the one shot SCREEN THRILLS in ‘57 to last year's issues of FANGORIA, FILMFAX..., are shown with (debatable) suggested collectors prices for good and mint copies. I like seeing the covers of the great sixties magazine that I used to own (especially FAMOUS MONSTERS which ran ^e longest and was the most influential, CASTLE OF FRANKENSTEIN- best writing, and FANTASTIC MONSTERS-great covers and the first horror foldouts), plus short lived rarities like WORLD FAMOUS CREATURES and MONSTER PARADE. It seems amazing now, that at one time issues of national magazines actually had full color cover illustrations from movies like THE FLESH EATERS and THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN’T DIE. A quick poll reveals that the horror star on the most covers was Christopher Lee, who doesn’t mean much to young fans today (33), followed by Boris Karloff (31). More recent magazines usually have robots or anonymous goiy faces. The reproductions are fine and 8 pages are in full color. FRAGILE GEOMETRY- THE FILMS, PHILOSOPHY, AND MISADVENTURES OF NICOLAS ROEG (PAJ $9.95) Joseph Lanza As a cameraman, the Dutch/British Roeg filmed everything from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and CASINO ROYALE (both 2nd unit) to Corman’s MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH and Truffaut’s FAHRENHEIT 451. He’s known to some for directing music personalities (Jagger, Bowie, Garfunkle). The first feature he (co-) directed was PERFORMANCE (‘68), which wasn’t released in America until ‘70, and then cut and rated X. Since then many of his challenging, unique films have been censored or barely released, and called “hypnotic, pretentious, obscure, complex, visionary, sick and perverse’’. He could never be accused of doing things the easy way, or just for the money. I was confused by DON’T LOOK NOW and THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH, but was impressed enough to watch them more than once and to check out EUREKA at a rare showing. In FRAGILE GEOMETRY, author Lanza interviews Roeg, who is “on the verge of going mad’’, his actress/star wife Theresa Russell, and his frequent scriptwriters. He discusses each film (up to last year’s TRACK 29), and even devotes a chapter comparing the films of Roeg to those of Ed Wood Jr. (!). A Roeg quote: \"Whoever is in charge of editing a film really plays God. It’s the juxtaposition of images that changes people’s views. (Soviet director) Pudovkin puts an empty plate in front of a fat man, and it means he’s eaten; an empty plate in front of a thin man means he wishes he could have the food. Goebbels also realized this”. This book should help explain why Roeg’s films are the way they are. It might even make you want to go out of your way to see more of them. (Roeg’s next feature will be THE WITCHES). GET RID OF THAT DEADLY HAIRSTYLE! DON’T nAY KUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH YOUR HAIR. Great looking hair i$ not a gamble at H4IR-0*DYN4MICS...

Hucksterism at its worsti HERSHELL GORDON LEWIS ON THE ART OF WRITING COPY (Prentice Hall $16.95) Cult director H.G.Lewis (BLOOD FEAST, SHE DEVIL’S ON WHEELS, THE WIZARD OF GORE...) hasn’t made a movie in 17 years. He’s made more money and had less headaches, living in Rorida and writing books about advertising and direct mail sales. This new illustrated volumn has a full color photo of a smiling Lewis sitting at his word processor on the cover, and since it’s from a division of Simon And Schuster, your local bookstore could easily order a copy for you. His career in gore, sex, and exploitation movies is never mentioned. He’s simply “a veteran copywriter and marketing communications expert’’. This book is full of useful advice for using psychology, common sense and the right words to sell literally anything in publications, on radio or TV, or through the mail. It tells you how much deception you can get away with and how to attract the potential buyers attention without confusing them. Many actual ads are analyzed for their effectiveness. A chapter on celebrities shows why Rodney Dangerfield was not good PSYCHOTRONIC - 16 promoting Western Airlines, why Mark Harmon is “the perfect spokesperson for Coors beer”, and ridicules ^Leona Helmsley hotel ad. I You could buy this book as a collectable oddity to show off to other ' H.G.Lewis movie fans, but although his ahead of their lime movies were i often amateurish, there is nothing shoddy about this book. If you want to sell something, this book will help. Even if you don’t, I II wouldn’t hurt to know what all the succCJsful people trying to sell things to you know. In this world of the relAilless psychological sales pilch, unless you live in a sensory deprivation lank, you’re a daily victim of expert (often criminal) modem snake oil salesmen (and women). We buy things we don't’ want or need and can’t afford. We pay for useless and harmful advice (and medication and operations) from money hungry “experts” and doctors, and support self serving and corrupt political leaders who have been sold to us by the same people who promote McDonalds, Budweiser and Coke. Lately some people (even whole cities and states) have woken up and realized that they were sold inefficient and dangerous nuke plants or are sitting next to deadly waste sites. School children should be taught how advertising works, how audio tape and film is edited, what movie stars, athletes, astronauts... have made more money as product or corporation spokesmen than what they’re supposed to be famous for, who sponsors politicians, and that Ed McMahon is the Great Satan. This book might help you in the advertising business, or could be a useful weapon to help you resist being another zombie spending machine. PROPAGANDA- THE ART OF PERSUASION: WORLD WAR II (WellfleeL a bargain at under $20 on better remainder tables) Anthony Rhodes A good companion to the Lewis book, this incredible heavily illustrated large “coffee table” book is highly recommended to anybody interested in the power of posters, art and films, and the events that still shape today’s world. It’s one of the best, easy to read history books ever, and like the Lewis book does with recent ads, shows what WWII propaganda worked and why. With hundreds of rare (often color) illustrations and detailed text, it illustrates and discusses the propaganda efforts of the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan- at home and in conquered countries), the Allies (America and Britain), the resistance, and the Soviet opportunists who conveniently changed sides during the war. Beautiful, effective, hateful and scary posters and leaflets are shown along with stamps, children’s books, record labels, parodies, and editorial cartoons. A detailed filmography lists the propaganda films of each country and many movie posters and stills are included. It’s a real jolt to actually see what helped turn some countries into single minded war machines and later turned ones that sat by and watched into full alert, mass production liberators. It’s easy to see how wartime propaganda changed government (and commercial) sales techniques forever. Who can stop using proven techniques? Some recent American print ads have been revealed as close copies of Nazi propaganda posters. Even the cover of the Meet The Beatles album was obviously inspired by a famous 1932 election poster showing “Hitler’s disembodied head floating on a black background”. If more people would buy and study a book like this instead of filling whole shelves with books about Elvis and Marilyn and watching inaccurate, unconvincing war themed TV mini-series, there might be a little more hope for the future. More stuff (magazines and booklets) THE MAN FRON PLANET X This 1987 reprint of the very rare 1952 comic book was based on Edgar G.Ulmer’s famous effective low budget movie about a friendly big headed alien who lands in Scotland and becomes the victim of a greedy scientist. Original mint copies are said to be worth over $10(X) in the Overstreet Comic Price Guide. The color panels feature the hero (who was played by Robert Clarke), the villain (William Schallert) and the love interest (Margaret Field, Sally Fields mom). The well drawn comic has more alien action than the movie did. Copies are $5 (postpaid) from Robert Brosch (14845 Anne St. Allen Park, Michigan 48101). BEMTO MUSSOLI.M ama molto i bambini. I bimbi d’ Italia aniano molto il Duce. The Fascist government wanted to teach schoolchildren the qualities of obedience, sacrifice, and intense devotion to the Duce. Mussolini was shown in schoolbooks as a stern but kindly father figure. The text for beginning readers says \"Benito Mussolini loves children very much. The children of Italy love the Duce very much. Long live the Duce. I salute the Duce: To usf\" THE BARE FACTS VIDEO GUIDE 1989 ($10) This obsessive spiral bound guide lists all the video releases featuring dozens of alphabetized actresses (from Angela Aames to Diane Lane to Pia Zadora) and highlights each title they have nude scenes in. Info includes exactly how many minutes into the tape each scene is, if the actress is naked from the back or front or topless, alone or with others. You also find out if the scene is long or you need slow motion or pause to get a good look! This booklet includes a lot of minor starlets I never heard of as well as major stars. It seems pretty silly to list every Meryl Streep video just to highlight a “very brief glimpse of upper half of left breast” in SILKWOOD, and it’s obvious that the editors haven’t seen some of the tapes since they missed some major nudity. Il is very useful though for viewers looking for their fave actresses undressed when Celebrity Sleuth and Celebrity Skin magazines aren’t enough. For readers who wants to see actors naked, they’re here too in a smaller separate section, but usually it’s just “brief buns”, with a few famous exceptions (Richard Gere, Dennis Hopper...). Order from PO Box 3255 Santa Clara, CA 95055 PSYCHOTRONIC ■ 17 LE RETOUR DE BELA LUGOSI ($6) Gerald Noel The second of two high quality small size Lugosi booklets from France, this has 32 pages of rare photos and posters. Even after years of buying Famous Monsters magazine, there are shots here I’ve never seen, including some great publicity shots, pics of Bela as Santa, drinking milk through a straw at a premiere, smoking a cigar and smiling while undergoing detox in ‘55, and two color shots (there are also two great color posters). A must for any Lugosi fanatic. DARIO ARGENTO PORTFOLIO ACTE 2 ($7) Gerald Noel Same format as the Lugosi, but with more color, this booklet includes a complete filmography of the Italian director and great pics from DEEP RED, SUSPIRIA, DEMONS, OPERA and others, as well as behind the scenes shots. The same people also did one Peter Cushing booklet. All of them are available mail order from FANTACO in America, TITAN in England, or write direct to Gerald Noel, 90 Rue Ghandi, 46000 Cahors, France. ZONTAR- THE MAG FROM VENUS #7,8 ($5 each) When I was still writing a column for High Times, I occasionally reviewed fanzines and newsletters. I never bothered with this one because I thought it wasn’t published anymore and the only issue I had seen was pretty messy and didn’t make much sense to me. ZONTAR is back with two big new improved xeroxed issues published simultaneously. Dedicated to (published by?) the mighty Zontar, star of Lany Buchanan’s ZONTAR, THE THING FROM VENUS (‘66), an impossibly cheap direct to TV remake of Corman’s IT CONQUERED THE WORLD, this magazine is not a normal movie fanzine. It’s full of conspiracies, politics, altered photographs, John Agar, Bozo The Clown, and Subgenious style graphics and rants that might at first seem : pointless, but if you bother to look, actually make sense and are often funny, scary and insightful. #8 is the “easier” issue with more acceptable film criticism and info. K features a long article/interview with Buchanan himself and great photos (Larry and Deborah Walley, THE CREATURE OF DESTRUCTION posing like a fashion model!...) and actual photo proof that rumored Buchanan movies like STRAWBERRIES NEED RAIN (a Bergman rip-off) REBEL JESUS, and HUGHES AND HARLOW actually exist! Larry also talks about SEX AND THE ANIMALS, THE BLACK CAT and others nobody knew he made. This issue is a must for fans of the director of DOWN ON US. A Zontar best 15 films article includes THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK, INTERNATIONAL HOUSE and KISSIN’ COUSINS! #7 features a long, crazed, but well researched and illustrated Nixon expose, the first serialized chapter of the Ed Wood Jr. book “Drag Trade”, Stalin, Elvis, late night testimonial TV shows and other things I can’t explain.

VENUS ■R P R PSYCHEDELIC N EW AN D USED HEAVY METAL ROCKABILLY BLUES • R & B HARDCORE PUNK RECORDS AHENTiON STORES WE WHOLESALE NEW LOCATION - STARTING SEPT. '89 13 ST. MARKS PLACE, NEW YORK 10003 (212) 598-4459 HOURS: 11-7 MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY, 1 - 6 SUNDAY PSYCHOTRONIC - 19 Since I often write about comics in this column, I wanna preface this glob of plugs by mentioning a week of blitzkrieg comix parties that hit New York in June. The major event was the ZAP Comix Show at The Psychedelic Solution Gallery. Along with displaying all the original art from ZAP #12, gallery owner Jay Castor brought all seven ZAP cartoonist to town for the opening. That’s right, California cartoonists Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, S. Clay Wilson, Robert Crumb, Spain, Robert Williams and current Parisian Gilbert Shelton danced their way through a press agents wet dream during the party and heavy storm of media attention. A few days later B. Dalton down the street had a signing party for the new RAW, with founders Art Spiegelman and Francise Moulty plus a bunch of RAW scriblers on hand to increase sales. Then the school of visual arts hosted a seminar called “Censorship in the comics” with members of the ZAP and RAW contingents pitching in their two cents worth on freedom of expression. As if this wasn’t too much of a good thing, Ron Mann’s documentary, COMIC BOOK CONFIDENTIAL opened at The Film Forum. The film intersperses comments and work by a wide range of influential comic book figures including E.C. founder William Gaines, MAD’s first editor Harvey Kurtzman, SPIRIT creator Will Eisner and the self effacing hero of the undergrounds, R. Crumb. Also featured was David Letterman’s ol’ pal Harvey Pekar, who flew in from Cleveland to help publicize the film and do a couple of in store signings of the freshly published AMERICAN SPLENDOR #14 ($4 pp from Harvey at PO Box 18471, Cleveland, Ohio 44118).COLLECT ‘EM, SWAP ‘EM DEPT... Carnage Press (Box 301, W Somerville, MA 02144) stretches the envelope of bad taste with “Death Cult: Jonestown Massacre Cards”. 39 different artists such as Katz, Gary Panter and Charles Bums illustrate tender moments from Rev. Jim Jones’ kooky, kwazy kult of kool-aid addicts. K-E-Y? BECAUSE WE LIKE YOU DEPT... William Stout and Jim Steinmeyer sent me a copy of “Mickey AT 60”, their limited edition comic offering a realistic view of a bloated, bitter 274/2 Mickey Mouse reminiscing about Uncle Walt and the gang (“Goofy is living on the street of Santa Monica, I think. Just can't handle money.”) This sold out fast, so why not consider reprinting this little Gem, Bill and Jim? BUT IS IT ART, DEPT... This mag should only be viewed with a note from your shrink. “Mother Shovel” ($3 pp from Steven Cerio, 51 MacDougal St. #44, NYC 10012) is a solo book of “art that needs a good spanking”, and rendered in a frightening style by Mr. Cerio. It showcases 28 pages of scary “scratches” with a mend bending purple and yellow silk screened cover. While on the subject of psychotic art work, let’s not forget “Losing Faith”. Dave Johnson sent us issues 7 and 8 of “the magazine that doesn’t have one fucking good thing to say about the world” ($2 from PO Box 10533, Mpls., MN 55458). Each issue features a slug of artists assaulting your eyeballs with very 4 HSHiH sick full page drawings, suitable for framing. POSTER POSTER ON THE WALL, WHO’S THE COOLEST BAND OF ALL?. ..Find out by grabbing a copy of “Xerographic Warfare: Posters of the New York City Music Scene ($4 pp from Rayozine Studios PO Box 291, Cooper Sta. NYC 10276). Compiled by SCREW art director and all around nice guy Kevin Hein, “X.W.” spotlights 25 gig flyers from musical troublemakers like The Honeymoon Killers, The Woodpeckers, Floor Kiss, and Reverb Motherfuckers. A handy historical document of NYCs alternative music scene. THANKS FOR THE MAMMARIES DEPT... “The Betty Pages” #3 is Greg Theakson’s tribute to the greatest pin- up beauty of all time. (S5 from Greg at 88 Lexington Ave. #9C, NYC, 10016). Along with rare photos, articles and checklists of Betty’s magazine credits, the mag also covers the world of “good girl” art For example, Steve Ringgenberg examines the stunning beauties of Frank Frazetta, featuring lots of lovely illos, including a romance comic Frazetta drew in ‘53 with a Betty Page look alike as the leading lady. Current pin up queen Justice Howard sent us info PSYCHOTROmC - 20 Retrosp^t The iarg|$t arpninest collection of superb qiisNity^lassic movie previews this sicjJpf the silver screen. » vaAed selection pf preview trailers Just name your g^nre: Ininest collection of classic movie previews legarding a product she’s hawking through the mail.

St. Andrews Place, LA,CA 90004). THEY GOT THE BEAT DEPT...Fans of Jack Kerouac may want to glom into the esoteric “Moody Street Irregulars” (18/19, a double ish is $5 from Jay Walsh, PO Box 157, Clarence Center, NY 14032) Subtitled “A Jack Kerouac Newsletter”, the zine is full of essays, memoirs and poetry mostly paying tribute to the grandad of the beat generation. DIRT ALERT DEPT... Yeah, The Hollywood Kids self titled gossip mag (S 1 to PO Box 691486, LA, CA 90069) even advertises their Dirt Alert Hotline (213-659-1477) for readers who may have some hot movie/rock star gossip tidbits they may have missed. ROCK ‘N’ ROLL WILL STAND DEPT... “New Gandy Dancer” (send price inquires to 87 Napier Road, Sw'alwell, Newcastle-Upon-Tyme, NE16 3BT, England) bills itself as the magazine of instrumental rock music. #27 features words on Duane Eddy, The Fireballs, The Spotniks and others. “Here ‘Tis” (S3 to Jeff Jarema, PO Box 11625, Richmond, VA 23230) focuses in on some of the cooler sounds of the 60s, like the Remains, Barracudas and Uniques. Rusty Breeding sent us the second issue of “New Positive Sanctions” ($1 plus two .25 stamps to 103 Downey St, SF, C A 94117) a spirited punk zine from the city on the bay. Lots of interviews herein with bands on the PMRC hit list like MDC, Pre Metal Syndrome and Capitol Scum. LAST BUT NOT LEAST DEPT... Special thanks to Jim Marshall for laying his latest volume of dirty rock and roll and country tunes, “Doggy Style Pl3” on me. It’s not for sale, so I’ll just remind NYC/NJ area PSYCHOTRONIC readers to catch the Hound every Sat. from 3-6 PM on WFMU, a truly cool radio station. A final tip of the SPARE PARTS helmet to Lisa B. of “Bikini Girl” magazine for sending me one of David Alexanders’ Phoenix books (#5, Whirlwind). Perfect subw'ay reading. And here comes my F train right now, so adios until I serve up the next great big glob of SPARE PARTS next issue. RECORDS By Art Black Hay-yull Briltania. Psychobilly was invented by Nigel Lewis of The Meteors and some myopic joker with a bad haircut. Nigel realized early the limitations of the form and bailed for more rewarding endeavors, whilst his poorly shorn matey built an entire non- career on same limitations, and a generation of muttonheads sprung up around him sporting stand up bases, tatoos, empty heads, and bad haircuts. Thence came the Stingrays to more or less perfect the mini-genre and fade away with a flatulent bark, and so way psychobilly laid to rest. Or it should have been. “Curse Of The Graveyard Demon” (Skyclad) gathers the best from four KREWMEN LPs in order that you might dismiss/ignore them easily in one fell swoop. Proof positive that in music as in movies, good PSYCHOTRONIC appreciation doesn’t translate into good PSYCHOTRONIC ability. Which brings us to the SERIAL KILLERS, Philly’s subdued answer to Gwar, a group struggling to diguise the nothingness of their music behind splatter theatrics and mild shock tactics. “Roadside Rendezvous” (Plus) is by-the- numbers gorepunk with not a whit of wit nor perk of personality to recommend it. Obviously recognizing this, the K’s went for the colleclorscum market on their follow-up, “Heidnik’s House Of Horror” (Suspiria, 1000 numbered red vinyl copies), capitalizing on the violent psychosexual viciousness of their hometown (the only city that comes to mind which had a major inhabited area firebombed and levelled by mayoral decree in order to forcibly evict one single unsavory “family”) by including a dollop of dirt from cellar dweller Gary Heidnik’s yard - he the twistopath accused of chaining and torturing mentally deficient femmes for sex and torture, feeding them dogfood and one another. In other words it’s worth the shekels for you Hyde’s and Jekll’s, even though you’ll probably play it through but once (or less). Which brings us to THE CHEMICAL PEOPLE and the two newest 45’s on their 2” Pecker label. Fronted by Dave Nazworthy, also of LA stalwarts The Last (if fronted is the right word for a dmmmer/vocalist), and heavily backed by Bill Stevenson (Descendents, Back Flag , et al), it’s kinda disappointing to hear the CP’s heading into territory previously charted by (go on, guess) the Descendents, Black Flag, et al). Steroid adrenopunk pop, still including the left field covertunes, the CP’s are probably a blast live and still colorful vinally, but now sorely lack the wicked wiry skew and spew of their bygone Tajia/Jeanna/Traci pom-rock days. Which reminds me to mention the SPORTING BACHELORS, whose “Love Letters To Joanna Stonn” (Dionysus) should be out by now. The SB’s are NY the same way that the Dictators were, or the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, or Suicide, and precious few of today’s famed Lower East Side Scumrockers save for perpetual outsider underdogs Sloth (from Brooklyn). The SB’s play scuzzy 60s punk with a vengeance, but have intentionally steered clear on NY’s terminally flighty/trendy “garage scene”, opting instead to record blaring soundtrack tunes for major pom vids (BLAME IT ON GINGER...), in the grand tradition of The Plugz CNEW WAVE HOOKERS...). Hear them. One of NY’s best kept filthy secrets. Which brings us to THE RAUNCH HANDS, whose “Payday” (Cry'pl) is not only their best LP yet, but easily one of the top 5 of the first half of ‘89. Kick aside your reservations about the neophyte Hands- these dnims blast overdrive; this sax pops cherries at forty paces. The other guys, well hell, you know already the kind of sleazy se"
