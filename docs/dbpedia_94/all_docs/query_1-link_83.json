These photos are from Dave’s and WGP co-editor Jordan Schwartz’s upcoming book, Party With Me Punker, edited by Thurston Moore.\n\n“I was 16 when I first started taking my camera and riding the bus to LA to see punk shows. Up to that point, I’d been making movies with my friends in Santa Monica and listening to whatever was on AM radio."
