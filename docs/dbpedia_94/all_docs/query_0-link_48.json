JULY 1978 The more you know about dishwashers, the better KitchenAid looks. People who have had experience with dishwashers don t just think KitchcnAid is best. I hey buy it. People say things like, \"Built solid, very reliable.\" \"Gets everything clean without hand rinsing, even dirty pans \" \"Needs few repairs. \"Lasts a long time \"Uses less hot water.\" \"Saves on electricity \"1 he adjustable racks make it so easy to load These are just some of the reasons w hy, over the years, so many people have replaced their dishwashers with KitchenAid.

And my old \"Monitor\" is lasting proof! Ta!'- about a great investment! I got it m 1957, when it was 23 years old. And it still works like a charm. Of course, it doesn't have all the improve- ments and innovations General Electric \"s added over the years. But it shows how dependable GE refrigerators are. As I told my daughter Mary Ellen, they just can't be beat! Great Aunt Agnes Spina West Orange, New Jersej. I've spent nearly half a century depending on GE refrigerators. We bought one of these in the mid-fifties, after giving away the faithful \"Monitor\" Jane has now. What a workhorse! Soda was always cold, ice cream was hard, and it never needed any service. So naturally when we modernized again five years ago, we went right back to GE for a big, beautiful side-by-side. General Electric refrigerators really hold up. We've had enough of them to know! Mary Ellen Steele Burns Totowa, New Jerse\\ Genera! Electric is a name you grow up with. You know it's dependable. So we felt confident that our lower-priced GE refrigerator would give us the same quality and reli- ability as the most expensive model. My mother told me GE refrig- erators were the best kind, and of course we did a lot of shopping around. No other brand had the features GE did for the same money. Or was as nice-looking, inside and out. Suzanne Steele Walsh Morristown, New Jersey Having had GE refrigerators in the family for so long impressed mc more than an> brochure or sales talk. So when we buy our new refrigerator, ii won j be a question of \"whether GE.\" but of \"which GE.\" And 1 think 1 know which — this <jorgcous dream of a side-by-side ! It has plenty of space, important wiih our li\\o children. And adjustable glass shelves, great \\'o\\ cleaning up spills. Separate lemperaiure control lor the meat pan. Automatic defrosting. Ami the Gl: dispenser that gives you chilled water, ice cubes, even crushed ice. I love the 'New Nalurals''\"coli>rs. loo— so soli! The reliabililN General l-leciric's been building into llkir refrigerators since Great Aunt Agnes hoiighl hers makes me feel really confident. \" Maybe some day my Gli refrigerator will become a family heirloom too! THE APPLIANCES AMERICA COMES HOME TO. GENERAL® ELECTRIC r Announcing The Official State Flowers Bell Collection . .-...J ■ p^-w'y- • For the first time ... 50 exquisite little bone china bells portray all of America's '^ ' state flowers. • Each bell will be decorated with a specially commissioned original painting and hand-decorated with 24 Kt. gold. • A uniquely designed unit to display the complete collection will be provided at no additional cost. • Final order deadline: July 31, 1978. America the Beautiful is blessed with magnificent flowers. A carpet of color and fragrance that stretches from sea to shining sea — reminding us of the bounty that nature has bestowed upon our nation. And of all the lovely flowers that flourish on our native soil, the very favorites have been named the official flowers of the 50 states. Now, at last, all 50 of these official state flowers will be faithfully portrayed on ex- quisite little bells of fine bone china — an unprecedented artistic tribute to our 50 states . . . a joyous celebration of our love for the land we live in. Fine Bone China — The Perfect Art Medium for This Unprecedented Collection The special qualities of imported fine bone china are perfect for portraying these beau- tiful flowers. Bone china is renowned for its pure ivory-white color and remarkable translucence — qualities which enhance the vivid colors of each flower. Fine bone china is also famous for its light weight and delicate appearance — qualities which perfectly correspond with the delicacy of the flowers themselves. Very few china makers in the entire world have mastered the necessary skills to produce bone china. This is why bone china is found only in a few countries —and why it is treas- ured by collectors on every continent. It is rare to find an exclusive, privately commis- sioned bell collection in fine bone :> m^ - and rarer still to find a collection consisting of fifty exquisite little bone china bells. Original Paintings by One of America's Most Distinguished Nature Artists To create the original art that appears on each of these bells, a special commission was awarded to the prominent American nature artist, Jo PoJseno, whose work has been shown in leading galleries and has appeared in Audubon Magazine. Working in fields, plains, and mountains across America, Pol- seno has created a striking series of original floral waiercolors expressly and exclusively for ihi? collection. These paintings have never been seen before — and will never ap- pear again in any form. The flowers include the sweetly scented Massachusetts Mayflower, beloved of the Pilgrims . . . the Mississippi Magnolia, fabled flower of the Deep South . . . the vibrant California Poppy . . . the lovely pink and L'oiitmucil 1)11 next p.i^r i I Continued from preceding pa^c yellow wild rose of Iowa. In all, 50 lovely flowers . . . authentic down to the most mi- nute detail . . . vibrant in all their natural colors. Each Bell a Handcrafted Work of Art To create a bell collection worthy of our official state flowers and the fine bone china, a specially designed bell shape was created. To produce this unique shape, each bell will be individually cast by hand. Then the original Polseno watercolors will be transferred to each bell using techniques involving many separate colors. As a crowning touch of lux- ury, each bell will be hand decorated with precious 24 Kt. gold applied to both the handle and base. Each bell will also bear the name of the state and its official flower, as well as the Danbury Mint hallmark. Display Accessory at No Additional Cost A custom designed display unit will be furnished at no additional charge. This beautiful unit may be placed on a table or book shelf (as shown below) or hung on a wall — to display all 50 bells to best advantage. Bells shown actual size.

Until re- cently, however, Mathsson furniture was produced in limited quantities in his own workrooms. Now. it is made bv Dux, a Swedish manufacturer of mod- ern furniture that recently reopened showrooms in New York. To celebrate their return to America. Dux is intro- ducing a new version of the famous chair, \"Pernilla 11\" {inset above). It sells for 1870 to $1,615, depending on upholstery. Mathsson himself reclines on the sheepskin-covered \"PerniUa III\" lounge, about $1,700. Mathsson/ Dux furniture is available to the trade at the Dux showroom, and to everyone else at Lord & Taylor. New York City, and Danica, Los Angeles. Woks cooking . . . Chinese cooking is a way of life for Harry and Jessie Freis.

Grooming has come a long way from the days of the charming little table with the flowered flounce. And makeuj) today is more sophisticated than a touch of rouge and a pat of powder. To look your very best you must find an area in your home where you can experiment until you find your best look. And the quandary of every woman is finding the space to accomplish the most in the shortest possible amount of time. The city woman is rarely satisfied with the dressing room she gets — it's fre- quently a bathroom with a medicine chest as the action center. In other parts of the country, space may be more generous, but even here it's organization that makes the setting work. \"Regardless of space.\" says Halston, \"create a private, mini-makeup center. The idea is to build horizontally so that every grooming aid is at hand. Look for spaces that you haven't utilized before. Since your mirror and washbasin constitute the center of your daily routine, build out from there. Are you utilizing the area on either side of the washbasin? Consider building a Formica table to surround it. Invest in a spray nozzle with a short hose to simplify facials and skin care — it's a terrific timesaver when you give yourself a once-a-week facial masque. Find a spe- cific place for your hairdryer so that it is always neatly in place instead of lending a feeling of disarray. Try and have your bathroom scale visible so that it's easier to keep a daily record.\" Another bright idea is to frame a calendar. .Select a sleek chrome frame, remove the glass and affix the cal- endar to the backing with double-faced tape. Then jot down your beauty commit- ments for each month. Schedule a dentist appointment, a monthly haircut even if it's just a trim, your manicure and leg waxing appointments. Each morning make note of your pre-breakfast weight. There's no easier way to lose five pounds than by being conscious of the ups and downs of your scale. Becoming beautiful is easier with a three-way mirror but sometimes space precludes the luxury. Buy a large hand mirror or place one on th<! wall op- posite your medicine chest mirror to get a back-of-the-neck reflection — a must fr)r checking hair, collars and scarves. It'« also a gentle reminder to the man in your <fe that it'H time for a trim. Just about every beauty book on the market today will tell you to change the bulbs in your dressing/grooming area to a soft, flattering pink, or it will tell you to invest in vei^y special makeup lights. Halston disagrees. After all, he started at the top designing hats for Lily Dache and has always been a keen observer of faces. \"Make up in a light that reveals all and you will find yourself ap- plying your makeup more discreetly. My models make up in a white light. It shows the imperfections and gives more detail. Being able to see reality allows you to make subtle adjustments. If a woman finds herself being complimented on her tur- quoise eye shadow, she should be aware that she's doing something wrong. Makeup is never obvious if you apply it properly. And you use less when you apply it in harder light. Too much makeup is always unattractive and the theory that using a ter chair has a back that tilts so that in an emergency, it's possible to have your hair- stylist come to your home or do your hair in privacy when you've planned a special evening. That's luxury,\" says the four time winner of the Coty Award and mem- ber of the Coty Hall of Fame. \"If you have a dressing table with drawers on either side, use them wisely. Ratiier than having your makeup ran- domly arranged, buy some rattan trays. Arrange your foundations and powder on one tray. Secure bottle tops so that they can lie flat. Eye shadows, mascaras and pencils go in the second tray, and lip and rouge colors are carefully arranged on the next tray. Each tray should fit into a separate drawer so that you can remove the tray when you need it.\" he states. Halston's feelings about how a woman should look are so strong that he became personally involved with the evolution of each of his makeup formulas. \"I carefully edited the colors to make them representa- tive of what is important now. Makeup can be likened to a form of dressing. Every woman has so many options from which to choose. The choice is hers, but in the end the basic reason for makeup is to look more attractive. That's the magic. It hap- pens between a woman and her mirror. heavier foundation will hide lines and make you appear years younger is simply not true.\" \"Be comfortable when you apply your makeup. Add a chair if your balh/dress- ir.g room permits. The ideal makeup cen- Her image becomes reality and suddenly she wants to become more attractive. And once she becomes pretty for her.self, she becomes pretty for everyone around her, as well, because she has learned the magic of making people see.\" U m ^ It's one thir? life.

Most ranges on the market today differ little from the ranges of 30 years ago. The Jenn-Air range dif- fers a lot. It breathes. The range that breathes. It's the sim- plest way to explain how the extraordi- nary lenn-Air range works. There's no hood A powerful venti- lation system, built x_^.~.^- into the oven and >• — f^ rangetop, breathes in air to whisk away smoke and odors, breathes out air to keep your kitchen cleaner, sweeter. And most important, lenn- Air's built-in ventilation gives you more ways to cook— virtu- ally every method of cooking the world has ever known. You gel more ways to cook, including 5 ways conventional ranges don't offer. A lenn-Air range can give you just the right temperature for all conventional cooking methods: boiling, braising, frying, baking, roasting, and broiling. But then, a lenn-Air range gives you even more ways to cook, cook- ing methods that conventional ranges don't offer cooking fla- vors you can't get any other way, Standard rangetop heating elements are re- movable and re- placeable in sec- onds with any of 5 different Cooktop Convertible units that give you your choice of 5 more ways to cook. You can grill mdoors with a Jenn- Air range. Thick steaks, or heavy chops sputter and sizzle as they absorb a rich char- flavor. Smoke is whisked away into the rangetop venti- lator located just inches from the meat. You can spit roast buttery chickens, spicy barbecue ribs, succulent pork roasts, whole legs of lamb. The meat turns lazily on the electric spit, bast- ing itself in its own rich juices. You can griddle a breakfast of bacon and eggs for a whole family, short-order quick. You can shish kebab with 4 spits turning at once, load' • ! with beef, lamb, shrimp, sou sage, vegetables, whole meals on a skewer. And you can deep-fry * doughnuts, fritters, French fries, hush puppies, without filUng your kitchen with greasy smoke and odors. This oven not only stays cleaner, it has an'ACCELERATED Choose from 2 different CLEANING \"cycle, loo. ways to roast and bake, including the way professional chefs use. Every time you usetheJenn-Air oven it works to keep itself cleaner. Greasy build-up is re- duced because this oven, like the rangetop, is fully vented — smoke and steam are ex- hausted direct to outdoors. Spattering is reduced because The roast-and-bake oven of the Jenn-Air range is actually two ovens in one. First, it's a conven- tional electric oven and broiler that lets you cook all your pres- ent recipes without change. But then, just by flicking a switch it becomes a professional type con vected oven that roasts and bakes in a stream of power- driven air— quicker, at lower temperatures. Cooked in this swirling airstream, meats brown-up more quickly with a crust of delicious brown coating that traps the hot, seething juices inside. Beef roasts cook lushly pink and fork tender all the way through. Turkeys turn a rich, golden brown, bub- bling with rich juices, and they cook in less time.

SOLAR GREENHOUSES II Last month we described si)lar greenhouses as thermally self-sufficient structures where plants could grow, and which, if attached to the house, could serve as sub- stantial supplemental heat sources. This month we'll talk about greenhouse con- struction in more detail. First, let's review the best glazing op- tions. You must double-glaze, but you don't have to use the same material for both layers. It's the air space that counts. 1. Glass. This is the best outer layer, but it is expensive and comparatively hard to work. I like ASG's \"Lolron\" glass, which transmits five percent more solar energy than typical float-glass for a very small additional cost. Any factory-made double glazing costs about 60 percent more than two layers of single glass, but consider- ably simplifies building. 2. Fiberglass reinforced acrylic i Filon. Sunlite. Lascolite) is translucent and dif- fuses the light. It comes flat for walls, cor- rugated for roofs. It costs about half as much as glass and is much easier to work for the do-it-yourselfer. It has about a 20-year lifetime if Tedlar coated. 3. Tuffak-Twinivall, a clear, semi-trans- parent material, is a double-walled sand- wich of jxtlycarbonate. It is excellent for the do-it-yourselfer because it is easy to cut and both glazing walls go up at once. 4. Instead of using permanent materials for the inner layer, you can save by using a i)lastic film with a one-to-five-year life. Monsanto 602 and Tedlar have the best resistance to ultra-violet degradation, a problem with most plastics. But remem- ber, films cover the bottom surface of the structural ribs, making the greenhouse much less interesting visually. Now. how about the angle of the glass? If your slope (angle A in the prototype) is 20 degrees greater than your latitude, you are angled to receive optimum winter heat gain. For example, in Philadelphia, at latitude 40 degrees, angle A would be 60 degrees. A lower angle, however, may be necessary to fit under second floor win- dows. A steei)er angle will make your greenhouse much more comfortable dur- ing the summer months. Since heat storage works best when in direct sunlight, its location is important. In our June prototype, water drums sup- ported benches along the house wall. This might prove insufficient; often the drums, or the container-shelves, must run from A handsome chest for practical storage or elegant accent recalling the less formal furniture madeduring the late 1 7th Century in England and America. Such careful interpretation of ageless themes — traditional with Henredon — is found throughout Folio Twelve, a bedroom and occasional collection of warm country English spirit. Send $1.00 for brochure to Henredon, Dept. B-78, Morganton, NC 28655. Henredon top to bottom of this wall. The east and west walls can also be used for such stor- age. One solution, shown here, has the knee-wall on the south side glazed, and high enough for a plant bench supported by water drums to go against it. Plan on two to three gallons of water per square foot of greenhouse depending on tempera- ture re(]uirements. WATER FILLED 55 GALLON DRUM PROTOTYPE GREENHOUSE To make your greenhouse comfortable in summer make sure it's (1) shaded either by deciduous trees, vines or exterior blinds; (2) well-vented to the exterior and (3) has a minimum of glazing where the roof pitch flattens out. This month's proto- type shows this roof completely unglazed. Note the overhang for further summer shading and storing roll-down blinds. The ventilation retjuirement is demanding: Operation sash is costly and leaks heat. The combined area of exterior vents should be one-sixth the floor area, with a typical 10 by 16-foot greenhouse having a four-square-foot low vent, a six-square- foot high vent and a three-by-seven-foot door. A door to the garden is useful for bringing in soil, moving plants, etc. If your summers are very hot, you'll need more vents than this, with a two-to-three ratio between low and high vents. All doors and operating sash must fit tightly with good weatherslripping. If you want to build a solar greenhouse, read The Solar Greenhouse Book ($10.95 from Rodale Press, Emmaus. I'a. 18049) and Solar Greenhouse by Yanda and Fisher ($6.00 John Muir Publications, Box 613, Santa Fe, N.M. 875011.

TJlis Month continued Noteworthy Books How To Delect and Collect Anti(|iic Furniture, by Will Tlit-us (Alfred A. Knopf, $10.95; paperback, $6.9S), will doubtlessly open many eyes to the benefits (Ix)th financial and recreational) of furni- ture collecting. Authoritative yet enter- taining, this outstanding little volume out- lines key ciiaracteristics of many 18th- and 19th-century styles while offering invalu- able advice on authentication. Color pho- tographs are terrific, too. Europe's Wonderful Little Hotels and Inns (E. P. Button, $9.95) is hardly your run-of-the-mill travel guide. Editor Hilary Rubinstein has compiled 300 rec- ommendations from travelers not content with the highly commercial, large an<l im- personal hotels so prevalent today. The result is a sumptuous listing of back-road cottages, cabins and even a few castles. But for travelers more interested in facing the wilds than enjoying creature comforts. Adventure Travel, by Pat Dickerman, (Thomas Y. Crowell, $9.95; paperback, $5.95), is another worthy addition to fravel libraries. Trek, kayak, balloon, glide or bicycle around mountains and streams with this book as your launching pad. State-by-state listings include infor- mation on rates, necessary equipment and experience requirements. The Dancer's Companion, by Teri Loren (Dial, $7.95; paperback, $3.95). will help dance novices reach their full potential whether studying in a clas.'yjoom or practicing with peers. Loren's book is an effective response to the increasing de- mand for information on selecting a dance school, participating effectively in class and confronting psychological obstacles. The Dance Encyclopedia, edited by Chujoy and Manchester, (revised edi- tion, Simon & Schuster, $8.95 paperl)ack) will also interest dancers. Close to 5,000 entries comprise a definitive information source on dancers, choreographers, termi- nology, technique, dance history and nu- merous classical and modern dance works. The Small Garden, by John Brookes (Macmillan, $19.95), provides new evi- dence for those who believe the English have long had the upper hand in garden design. Brookes, four-time winner of the Royal Horticultural Society's Gold Award for garden design, has assembled innu- merable patterns for displaying flowers, fruit trees, herbs and vegetables. And even if all the soil you possess would fit into one. small window box, this book, with its wonderful color photographs, will bring new-found joy with every seed and inilli >ou i.luni. -RK15ECCA SAWYER ■ The beauty of real ceramic tile. \\bu'll see it in a moment.

What's wrong with a little com- fort as you communicate with nature, especially if you're going back to the ice age? A Royal Viking Line cruise, from Los Angeles to Alaska via the Inside Passage, can lead you to Glacier Bay, an astounding sapphire and aciua- marine world where 20 frozen rivers meet, eagles soar and the stillness is broken only by the boom of cracking glaciers. The ship stops here for a daylight day. Park Rang- ers come aboard to explain all, and you're a rare one if you ever forget it. This year the \"Hoyal Viking Sky\" plies the route, which takes in Victoria, B.C. (quaint and flowery), Juneau (with its own glaciers and live-it-up strip), Skagway (where the Gold Rush made its mark), Sitka (Rus- sian flavored). Prince Rupert, B.C.

It has l)een called the monjirc the Cur, Heinz 57 Variety, mixed breed and, recently coim by Roger Caras, the random-bred dog. For most of us it is rt ferred to as the lovable mutt, and on this Fourth of July it i appropriate to announce that the mutt is making a comeback. With one paw on the pulse of the country, it is clear that dog of plebeian birth are rising quickly in popularity. This is con sistent with the American Humane Association's Be Kind Tv Animals Week (celebrated in May), because it helps to reduci: the huge mongrel dog population of this country's pounds ani shelters. In many of the fine parks and boulevards across tht nation, large numbers of mixed breed dogs are being walked tethered to expensive leather collars and affluent humans. Man) humans are discovering that unpedigreed dogs are as agreeabh to live with as the more aristocratic pure breds. Many animal shelters and humane societies are sponsoring dog shows and obedience trials for dogs oi the not-loo-fancy group. There is a movement afoot to glorify the All-American Mutt. In New York, the Bide-A-Wee Home Association will be helping this cause with their annual Canine, Carnival held this September at their Wantagh, Long Island fa- cilities. The obedience trials and dog show will be organized by l)rofessional dog trainer Brian Kilcommons and is open to dogs of all persuasions, including the random-bred. Any dog, randorn-bred or pure, may enter one of hundreds of Kids Dog Shows throughout the country this summer and autumn. This is the fourth season for these marvelous events, sponsored by Ken-L Ration Dog Food and the National Recrea- tion and Park Association. The Kids Dog Shows are open to youngsters between four and 14 and can be organized in your own community by writing: Kids Dog Show, P.O. Box 3493, Merchandise Mart Plaza, Chicago 60654. You will be sent a fantastic show kit and complete instructions. Another indication of the common dog having his day is the recent publication of a fine book, one of great significance to the mongrel owner, entitled Mutt: The First Guide to the All- American Breed by Nancy Dolensek and Barbara Burn (Clark- son Potter, Inc.). Mutt is an oversized, entertaining volume packed with much of the information mutt owners need, from rations to rationalizations. \"Mental Mutt\" and \"Mutt Main- tenance\" are especially effective chapters. Photos are great, and there is an added treat of 30 drawings by dog cartoonist Roy McKie. This is a major contribution to the very slender list of mixed-breed literature. Speaking of underdogs, the only other book of recent publication written for mutt owners is an obedi- ence training manual entitled Underdog: Training the Mutt, Mongrel, and Mixed Breed at Home (Published by Stein & Day) and coauthored by this writer. Underdog successfully introduces a technique for tailoring obedience training to the needs of the individual mutt. In addition to teaching obedience commands, the book provides a special temperament test that any owner can use to ascertain the traits of his or her dog (shy, nervous, stubborn, aggressive), and thus determine the appro- priate training method. In Mutt, authors Dolensek and Burn stale: \"No matter how long a dog's pedigree may be, no matter how many Best of Breed championships his forebearers have won. every dog today has a mongrel in his past. \"Mutts are the {]uintessence of dog— the very personification of man's best friend. They come in all shapes and sizes, all coats and colorings, and all temperaments —each one is unicpie.\" {Cofitinued on page 126) IS YOURS BEFORI ^ 3te .^.

By DISCANTARE D Technological advances in music are reflected in areas other than composition. The style of many of today's high-fidelity components is far difl^erent from what it once was and can be seen through the influence of industrial design. Note Nakamichi's rack-mounted System I for their Series 600 units, Bang and Olufsen's sleek teak cabinets in their Beominster range, and the white, vinyl-clad polyurethane cabinet and aluminum grille panel of the Advent/2 speakers. Just as there is room at home for industrial artifacts initially designed for different purposes, so contemporary electronic music often is better suited to an intimate home environment than to the classical ambience of the concert hall. The ability to preserve music as recorded sounds rather than by written notation or reliance on folk memory has been with us barely 100 years. It is a revolution that has changed our man- ner of composing, performing and listening. For a long time after its invention, the phonograph was devoted to copying an original performance, in an effort to duplicate the original ex- perience. It is only within the past 30 years or so that performers and composers have utilized the reproduction machine itself as a means of creating a new form of music: electronic. More than 50 years ago, inventors used vacuum tube oscilla- tors to produce differential tones capable of carrying a melody. Two new instruments were born from this experimentation and dubbed the thcremin and ondes Martenot. An interesting recital on the theremin has been recorded by Gladys Reisenberg Rock- more, who once thrilled audiences at Radio City Music Hall with the violin-like tone achieved by waving her hands in the air surrounding this instrument (Delos DEL-25437 | . Another innovation, somewhat surprising at the time, occurred in 1924, when Ottorino Respighi inserted the recorded song of a nightingale in his score of The Pines of Rome (London CS- 7043). More astonishing still was the use of \"tone clusters,\" or a strongly dissonant group of tones lying close together, by Henry Cowell in his piano studies (Atlantic/Finnandar 9016). Tliis use of tone clusters influenced his student, John Cage, to innovate the prepared piano by placing various objects between and around the strings (New World 204). The real impact of electronic music came as musicians responded to the currents of change in all the arts. The tape recorder provided the perfect tool for musical change, for composition as well as performance. Edgard Varese, drawing on his three decades of experimen- tation, wove into the fabric of the classical symphony orchestra passages of taped electronic crashes, whizzes, buzzes and moans in his mighty 1954 score Deserts (Columbia MS-6362). One of the founts of the new music is the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, which has issued a collection of pieces by Milton Babbitt and others (Columbia MS 6566). Mel Powell, the jazz pianist, has pointed out the \"perilously limited array of options\" open to the composer of electronic music, particularly when the choice of interpretive performance also is absent. The constraints of fashioning music directly on tape may have spurred Robert Moog to improve the synthesizer to its i)resent state. This keyboard instrument is not a com- puter, but an assemblage of oscillators, filters, mixers and envelopers, requiring the services of an arranger, programmer, player, recording engineer and mixer to realize the intended performance. Walter Carlos presents some distinctive Branden- burg Concertos on the Moog (Columi)ia MS-7194. MS-7286. KM-32659), if one is willing to accej)! the transcription of Johann Sebastian Bach into otiier modes. And why not? It's\" been done for 250 years, beginning with Bach. In this decade, musical frontiers are being extended still fur- ther as contemporary composers begin to generate music directly from computers.
