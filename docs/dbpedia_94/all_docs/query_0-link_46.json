        "text": "<strong>Marck</strong> <strong>Menke</strong>, <strong>Life</strong>time <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> Viewed <strong>Films</strong> (<strong>Version</strong>: 1 <strong>October</strong> 2012) The listing format is alphabetical by title, with notes pertaining to each film in square brackets. Alternate titles and non- English languages are given in italics, as are notes about my viewing experience, after the brackets. The second column lists the director(s). This list does not include long-term television series, introductions, excerpts, trailers or music videos. Film dates may variably refer to either the copyright year or the year <strong>of</strong> first release. <strong>Films</strong> requiring more notes are given additional indented lines. Abbreviations and codes used include: animation (‘anim’ or ‘animated’), black & white (‘b&w’), extensive clay animation (‘clay fx’), extensive computer generated imagery (‘CGI’), documentary film (‘docu’), English dubbed over original language (‘dubbed’nor ‘dub’), recorded stage production (‘rec. stage prod.’), short film (‘short’), ‘silent film’ (‘silent’ or ‘sil’), Television mini-series (‘TVmini’), made-for- television movie (‘TVmov’). A silent film is here considered as one that lacks a synchronized vocal soundtrack, even if music or sound effects were added later. <strong>Films</strong> made with transitional technologies (Movietone, Vitaphone, etc.) may or may not be labeled as ‘silent’ depending on the extent <strong>of</strong> the sound recording. A film with a soundtrack but no spoken dialogue may sometimes be identified as ‘score only’. Other information on this list includes: • Some geographic settings, which may or may not also be the filming location • Appearances by actors and other individuals I consider exceptionally noteworthy • Extensive gay, lesbian, bisexual or transsexual (GLBT) content is noted by ‘QR’. Relatively minor GLBT content is noted with a lowercase ‘qr’. Names and abbreviations <strong>of</strong> geographic settings and noteworthy individuals are listed after the main list <strong>of</strong> films. $30 [short film in Boys <strong>Life</strong> 3, Sara Gilbert, QR] 1999 Gregory Cooke 3D: A Brief History [short docu about 3D films & Dial M for Murder] 2004 Laurent Bouzereau 4 mosche di velluto grigio [Four Flies on Gray Velvet, Ital, Italy, Mimsy Farmer, qr] 1971 Dario Argento 5 Against the House [b&w, K.Grant, Brian Keith, G.Madison, K.Mathews, A.Moore, K.N.] 55 Phil Karlson 7 Faces <strong>of</strong> Dr. Lao [T.R., B.Eden] 1964 George Pal 7 th Voyage <strong>of</strong> Sinbad, The [clay fx, Baghdad, K.Grant, K.Mathews] 1958 Nathan Juran 8 1/2 [Italian, b&w, Italy, A.Aimée, C.Boratto, C.C., R.Falk, E.Gale, - - - M.Mast., S.Milo, B.Steele] 1963 Federico Fellini 8 Ball Bunny [Looney Tunes animated short film, Carib, NOLA, NYC, SAm, Mel Blanc] 1949 Chuck M.
