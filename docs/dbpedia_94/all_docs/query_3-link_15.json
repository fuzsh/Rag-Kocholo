        "text": "published on 2019-02-12T03:18:12Z\n\nRock LA? The Lovedolls are gonna rock the world! YOU DONâT KNOW MOJACK is a podcast dedicated to exploring the entire SST catalogue, in order, from start to finish. During the podcast we will discuss all the releases that are part of our core DNA, as well as many lesser-known releases that deserve a second chance, or releases that we are discovering for the very first time (we actually donât know Mojack!). First and foremost we are fans, and acknowledge that we are not perfect and donât know everything â sometimes the discussion is more about a time, place, feeling, personal experience or random tangents, and less about the facts (but we will try to get to the facts too).
