        "text": "There has been a fair share of Bozeman \"Party Bands\" in the last few, oh I don't know, decades, but The Love Darts are unique from the rest of them in the sense that they are inarguably THE Party Band of Bozeman right now. Nobody parties down like The Love Darts. They took some time away from partying to answer a few questions from our very own Isaiah Demontiney. See below!\n\nQ: Love Darts, Love Darts… did y’all get that name from critically acclaimed SST record film Desperate Teenage Love Dolls? If not, where did it come from?\n\nA: I got the name while me and my dad were reading these history books trying to come up with band names. There was some sentence about cupid’s love darts in it so I went with it. I’m a big Red Kross fan and have seen Desperate Teenage Lovedolls though! Never thought of the connection before but that movie rules!\n\nQ: Out of all the states you played before, what’s the best stop for a bite to eat or drink to slurp on? A: I really like eating in Seattle and LA so probably Washington or California but I’ve definitely had some real gnarly food in both of those states.\n\nQ: When the world becomes a corroded desert landscape what would be your soundtrack that keeps you rolling rolling rolling?\n\nA: probably a lot of Creedence Clearwater Revival and AC/DC. Maybe bust out the Nu Metal when times get real violent.\n\nQ: Out of all the super mega awesome rad bands playing, are there any that tickle yer fancy?\n\nA: I always love seeing Friends of Cesar Romero. We got to play with the Reddmen last year and it blew my mind more than any other band I have seen. I hope I get to see “But I’m a Cheerleader” too! They’re one of my favorite MT bands currently gigging and I’ve only gotten to see them once!\n\nQ: Last question, From getting me bit by shit ants and taking breaks in the middle of sets, are there any other notable stories from the wicked world of Love Darts? A: I feel like we get a pretty good story out of almost every show or tour but maybe we’re just romantics. We’ve been running into a lot of bar brawls lately. My favorite tour story right now involves watching a guy get kicked out of a bar after last call. Bartenders dumping a giant bucket of ice water on said man. Him claiming to have a gun resulting in two bouncers tackling him and beatin’ him down on the sidewalk. After the drama died down we got the guy away from the bar and he tried to offer me 3,000$ to kill Joey not knowing he was my brother. The night ended with me accidentally kicking Graham in the face and cutting his eyelid with my shoe in an attempt to reenact the fight later in our hotel room.\n\nCatch The Lovedarts at Craft Local on Saturday August 12th at 11 PM!"
