        "text": "If you went as far as getting to know this film even exists then i think it is safe to assume that you will enjoy it to some extent. It is, as one would imagine, quite bad. The acting is really god awful, the two main girls are really really bad, and have little charisma. The writing is pretty nothing, even if at times it can be funny. The photography is occasionally interesting, but for the most part it is quite standard home video level. The soundtrack can range from really nice to decent. What makes this one enjoyable though is knowing that it had such a close relationship with the LA punk scene at its arguable downfall. So when i looked at the girl gang that got into a fight with the love dolls i saw them as ACTUAL local punk kids and that by itself was entertaining to me as i've been listening to those bands since i was 10 or so but never had any kind of connection to this era. So to sum it all up. The film is kind of boring but to me it was nice just to see the general vibe of the LA punk kids in 84 also i would like to point that the choice for Steve McDonald for the glam looking rich corporate dude was really funny for me.\n\nBrassy lead singer Kitty (the adorable Jennifer Schwartz), spunky bass player Bunny (the equally cute Hilary Rubens) and feisty drummer Patch (the likewise attractive Janet Housden) are the hottie 18-year-old girl members of the scrappy all-female punk band the Lovedolls. The Lovedolls prove to be a fleeting flash-in-the-pan success; their fifteen minutes of fame are severely undermined by sleazy no-count heel manager Johnny Tremaine (deliciously overplayed to the sensationally slimy hilt by Steve McDonald) and the rival group the She Devils, a nasty bunch who are led by the spiteful and venomous Tania Heart (the splendidly snarky Tracy Lea). Technically, this fabulously flipped-out micro-budget underground indie cult favorite is extremely rough around the edges, with the sloppy storytelling, ragged editing, gritty, washed-out photography, crummy acting, lousy sound, and terrible lip-syncing all adding immensely to the movie's infectiously raw'n'ratty schlocky camp charm. Moreover, the often sidesplitting dialogue (\"Thanks for killing my mom\"), authentically grungy Los Angeles locations, the catchy, thrashy punk soundtrack (the Red Kross theme song in particular seriously smokes), the insanely eventful narrative, an excitingly vibrant depiction of the gnarly 80's punk scene, the hilariously lowbrow humor, the expected terrifically trashy clich√©s involving the dangers of sex and drugs (Johnny's nightmarish bad acid trip sequence is simply astonishing), colorfully wacky characters and an overall sense of gloriously gonzo go-for-it glee and gusto ensure that this beautifully berserk baby is a total rollicking blast of pure in-your-face impudent and irreverent 80's punk attitude and energy."
