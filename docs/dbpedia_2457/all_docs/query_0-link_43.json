        "text": "Disclaimer:\n\nIn case you are under the illusion that PAGMETER is an englisholgist, you would be wrong.\n\nIf I mess up down below, I’m so sorry…I usually do this on the run because I have been traveling so much. It’s all for the fun and the love of the game! My oldest Daughter Gianna used to be my proof reader but she now lives in Dallas and is way too busy for Pops. Gabe Camarillo & Paul Meadors are GREAT writers. PagMeter is the Godfather and a comedian.\n\nThe PAGMETER has been blowing plenty of picks so come on, send me your team shirt if I miss (XL) and I will wear them once I can tackle Matty J and get our Podcast started…..\n\nWEEK 3 UPSETS & BIG WINS\n\nTranquility beat Farmersville 22-7\n\nStockdale beat Ridgeview 21-13\n\nGolden Valley beat South 28-20 (Big upset)\n\nMendota beat Strathmore 20-0\n\nWashington Union beat Torres 25-0\n\nPAGMETER PLAYERS OF THE WEEK\n\nRB HUNTER BABB from the CARUTHERS BLUE RAIDERS\n\nHunter rushed for 364 yards and scored 6 TDs along with scoring two-2-point conversions in the win over Firebaugh. The offense rushed for 502 yards.\n\nHunter broke the school record which was held by stud Alex Puga with 357 yards in 2015. Scoring 6 TDs ties his own record scoring 6 TDs last year with Alex Puga 2015 and Howard Pharis 1929.\n\nIn 3 games, Hunter has now rushed for 811 yards and has scored 11 TDs.\n\nTREMENDOUS GAMES\n\nRB CARTER VARGAS from the ST JOSEPH KNIGHTS\n\nCarter carried the ball 21 times for 297-yards, scored 6 TDs, and returned two kickoffs for 162 yards in the big win over Newbury Park 63-52.\n\nQB DANIEL GOMEZ from the HANFORD BULLPUPS\n\nDaniel threw 6 TD passes in the win over Golden West 40-22 which ties a Hanford school record with Head Coach Cannon Sanchez.\n\nGAME UPDATE\n\nYOSEMITE BADGERS at LIBERTY HAWKS has been canceled. Yosemite is banged up and won’t be ready. Both teams have a bye in 2 weeks so Liberty is hoping they can play then. The Hawks have played the Badgers a total of one-half of football in 3 years. If they don’t play then Liberty wins on a forfeit.\n\nAnybody looking for a game on Sept 22? Email the Pagmeter and I will get it to coach Nolte.\n\nLEAGUE ALIGNMENT IDEA\n\nSome leagues need to change and have leagues for individual sports. Every sport is different in every school.\n\nExample football,\n\nThe Northwest Sequoia has,\n\nLiberty, Minarets, Fowler, Riverdale, Chowchilla, Parlier, Caruthers, Yosemite.\n\nParlier and Yosemite should not be playing with these teams. Give the small schools a chance.\n\nPAGMETER would have and this would work for every sport with these teams.\n\nNWSequoia league\n\nLiberty, Fowler, Chowchilla, Caruthers, Mendota Firebaugh, Dos Palos, Coalinga\n\nNW Sierra\n\nMinarets, Yosemite, Avenal, Tranquility, Riverdale, Parlier\n\nDo you like or don’t like my idea?\n\nIn week 3 the PAGMETER went 46-10 and for the year 133-38 (78%)\n\nComing soon GAME ON Podcast with the PAGMETER and will be the same entertaining UNCENSORED show with Matty J that you have loved for over 15 years and we will tackle all the Hot Topics along with High School, Fresno State, College sports, Pro Sports…you get the idea.\n\nWe will bring the No 1 show back to you that you all love and if you want to be a part of our show with advertising……email pagmeter@yahoo.com\n\nKEEP THE PAG METER UPDATED ON THE LATEST SCOOP ON YOUR TEAM\n\nWith Photos. Player updates….\n\nFollow the PagMeter on twitter @pagmeter, Instagram at @pagmeter\n\nEmail pagmeter@yahoo.com\n\nJOIN THE PAGMETER TWITTER SPACES POST GAME SHOW FOLLOWING THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS GAMES. IT’S A GREAT DISCUSSION FOR FOOTBALL.\n\nGET TWITTER AND FOLLOW THE PAGMETER.\n\nLET US KNOW IF YOUR GAME IS ON THURSDAY or FRIDAY NIGHT.\n\nTHERE IS CHANGES GOING ON ALL THE TIME.\n\nPLANDEMIC UPDATE\n\nFor the love of God, please don’t cancel your game because of the PLANdemic. If you are a soft school/district, the PAGMETER will be all over you for letting the kids down. I sure hope we learned something 3 years ago with all the corrupt bullshit. Parents, be strong and stand up to your school!\n\nCovid is now a mild cold so don’t fall for it with the mainstream media. The experimental vaccines are dangerous and masks don’t work. Don’t fall for the corruption like the first go around.\n\nTo all, if you don’t feel well, stay home, sleep, take your vitamin C and come back strong.\n\nWe have had a flu season for 1000 years and it’s amazing how smart this flu is because it only comes around when the election gets close. Hmmm\n\nTHANK YOU TO ALL THE TEAMS THAT SEND IN YOUR STATS\n\nPAGMETER WEEK 4 FOOTBALL PREDICTIONS\n\nTHURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL FINALS\n\nRIDGEVIEW WOLF PACK (0-4) at CENTENNIAL GOLDEN HAWKS (3-1)\n\nCan the Wolf Pack offense get it going this week? The Pack is playing a killer non league schedule and it continues this week.\n\nThe Pack comes in losing to Stocldale and the G Hawks beat Independence 42-21. Angel Lozano rushed for 170 yards and scored 3 TDs. QB Adam Copus threw 3 TD passes\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION GOLDEN HAWKS 40 WOLF PACK 13 (FINAL GOLDEN HAWKS 37 WOLF PACK 0)\n\nCALIFORNIA CITY RAVENS (1-3) at FOOTHILL TROJANS (2-2)\n\nThe Ravens shutout Vasquez 40-0 and the Trojans got shutout to Porterville 44-0. Porterville is light years better than Vasquez.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION TROJANS 30 RAVENS 20 (FINAL TROJANS 28 RAVENS 19)\n\nINDEPENDENCE FALCONS (2-2) at SOUTH SPARTANS (1-3)\n\nThe Falcons lost to Centennial 42-21. Diego Hernandez rushed for 173 yards on 14 carries and scored a TD. Richard Gooden rushed for 81 yards and scored a TD and caught a TD pass.\n\nThe Spartans lost to Golden Valley 28-20. The Spartans haven’t been the same since the woke South administration changed the mascot name from Rebels to Spartans. The woke administration didn’t do their homework because the Spartans killed people in their day. .Everybody killed everybody back in the day. I get it if South would have changed the mascot name to the South Jaguars, or something like the fighting screaming Sparrows but the Spartans..Makes no sense.\n\nBoth teams are trying to get it going before the league starts.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION FALCONS 33 SPARTANS 26 (FINAL FALCONS 35 SPARTANS 20)\n\nCHAVEZ TITANS (3-1) at HIGHLAND SCOTS (2-2)\n\nThis would be a big win if the Titans can go 4-0. The Scots have played a much tougher schedule.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION SCOTS 25 TITANS 23 (FINAL SCOTS 35 TITANS 14)\n\nIMMANUEL EAGLES (1-2) at MCLANE HIGHLANDERS (2-1)\n\nThe Eagles beat Fowler 35-12 and the Highlanders had a bye. The Eagles will have 4 new GIANT transfers and they are officially cleared to play starting this week. They are considered international transfers even though Hawaii is in the USA. This will be a physical game but when you get a brand new GIANT O-line overnight, that changes your team. That being said, the Highlanders are a much faster team so the big X factor can the Eagles match up with Highlanders team speed? THEY DID NOT! The Eagles will be a much better team with every game they play. Will it start tonight? This is the toughest game to pick.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION HIGHLANDERS 30 EAGLES 23 (FINAL HIGHLANDERS 49 EAGLES 13)\n\nMENDOTA AZTECS (1-3) vs ROOSEVELT ROUGH RIDERS (2-1)\n\nThe Aztecs shutout Strathmore 20-0. Coach Beto is an outstanding Coach because he is always doing the right thing for his players and making them better people. Last week Coach suspended 7 players against McLane for team rules and at the end of the day the Aztecs will be better because of it. I wish more coaches set the ground rules early.. The Riders lost to Mission Oak 31-7. The score is not what it looks like. The Riders gave up a 4th and 21, QB scramble for a TD and also a botched snap on a field goal that went for a TD pass.\n\nThe Riders offense needs a big night to beat a physical Aztecs team. Pagmeter says the Riders break out tonight! All week long I had the Aztecs but I got to go with the home team.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION RIDERS 30 AZTECS 25 (FINAL RIDERS 34 AZTECS 21)\n\nSTOCKDALE MUSTANGS (2-2) at BAKERSFIELD DRILLERS (2-2)\n\nThe Mustangs with a big win over Ridgeview and the Mustangs are one of the best early stories of the year. Some thought that the Mustangs would really struggle but new head coach Daron Mackey and his staff have the Mustangs playing with plenty of energy. The Drillers have plenty of talent and are trying to put it all together. When the Drillers decide to play as one unit, they will be very good.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION DRILLERS 21 MUSTANGS 19 (FINAL DRILLERS 28 MUSTANGS 27)\n\nTULARE UNION TRIBE (3-1) vs GARZA GUARDIANS (2-2)\n\nThe Tribe lost a tough one to Redwood 42-35. The Tribe gave up a late TD with the score tied 35-35. QB Jordan Crisp threw for 326 yards, and 4 TD passes. The Guardians beat Sanger West 48-14. QB Caleb Matthews threw 4 TD passes.\n\nCan the Guardians defense slow down the speedy Tribe offense? This could be a shootout.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION TRIBE 50 GUARDIANS 43 (FINAL TRIBE 62 GUARDIANS 48)\n\nMIRA MONTE LIONS (0-3) at WEST VIKINGS (1-2)\n\nBoth teams need a win before the league gets going. Which offense can finish drives with points?\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION VIKINGS 27 LIONS 21 (FINAL VIKINGS 28 LIONS 14)\n\nSALINAS COWBOYS (0-3) at CLOVIS COWBOYS (3-1)\n\nThe Cowboys are 0-2 but have played a killer non league schedule. Can the Cowboys offense breakout at Lamonica? I always thought that the Clovis Mascot should have been the Cowboys. There’s a ton more Cowboys in Clovis than Cougars. Just sayin.\n\nThe Cougars beat Whitney of Rocklin 41-28. Sophomore QB Deagan Rose rushed for 2 TDs and threw for 256 yards with a TD pass.\n\nThe Cougars need this win and are looking to go 4-1 in non league games especially with the tough TRAC league starting soon.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION COUGARS 30 COWBOYS 23 (FINAL COUGARS 37 COWBOYS 0)\n\nFRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS FINALS\n\nNORTHWEST SEQUOIA\n\nRIVERDALE COWBOYS (1-3) (0-1) at CARUTHERS BLUE RAIDERS (2-2) (1-0)\n\nThe Cowboys have hit a wall and the Blue Raiders are ready to go on a winning streak. Can the Boys slow down Pagmeter Player of the week Hunter Babb?\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION BLUE RAIDERS 52 COWBOYS 13 (FINAL BLUE RAIDERS 79 COWBOYS 38)\n\nPARLIER PANTHERS (1-3) ) (0-1) at CHOWCHILLA TRIBE (2-1) (1-0)\n\nThe Panthers come in getting shut out at Orange Cove and now face a hungry Tribe’s team.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION TRIBE 51 PANTHERS 7 (FINAL TRIBE 60 PANTHERS 0)\n\nMINARETS MUSTANGS (2-1) (0-1) at FOWLER REDCATS (1-3) (1-0)\n\nVery interesting match up. The Mustangs travel down the hill to take on the struggling Redcats. If the Mustangs can contain Redcats QB Jerrod Bubba Smith, game over. The Redcats are due to break out.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION REDCATS 27 MUSTANGS 24 (FINAL REDCATS 59 MUSTANGS 20)\n\nNON LEAGUE\n\nAVENAL BUCCANEERS (3-1) at FARMERSVILLE AZTECS (1-2)\n\nCan the Aztecs slow down the Bucs power running game?\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION BUCS 34 AZTECS 13 (FINAL BUCS 42 AZTECS 14)\n\nTAFT WILDCATS (1-3) at ARVIN BEARS (2-2)\n\nThis should be a battle. Both teams need a win before the league starts. The Wildcats were shutout against Tehachapi. The Bears beat Kern Valley 51-8. Sophomore QB Andrew Rosales threw for 164 yards with 3 TD passes and scored a TD. Both teams have beaten Kern Valley and both teams have lost to powerhouse teams. The Bears at home have the edge.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION BEARS 31 WILDCATS 23 (FINAL BEARS 19 WILDCATS 6)\n\nCLOVIS NORTH BRONCOS (4-0) at CENTRAL VALLEY CHRISTIAN CAVALIERS (3-1)\n\nOne of the best games of the night. The Broncos steamrolled El D 55-0. Jackson Cinfel rushed for 105 yards. QB Mario Cosma went 9-9 for 116 yards and 2 TD passes. Andrew Chavez scored on 2 rushing TDs, Vincent Cordoba returned a punt 61 yards for a TD. McKay Madsen and Josh Gerena each scored TDs.\n\nThe Cavaliers steamrolled Bakersfield Christian 56-25. Bryson Donelson rushed for 193 yards and scored 3 TDs. QB Brent Kroeze had a breakout game going 18-19 for 330 yards and 3 TDs.\n\nThis game a simple X factor, which defense can slow down the other power running game? Last year CVC beat CN 23-9.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION BRONCOS 39 CAVALIERS 28 (FINAL BRONCOS 48 CAVALIERS 14)\n\nBULLARD KNIGHTS (1-3) vs CLOVIS WEST GOLDEN EAGLES (3-1)\n\nThe Knights come in losing to Frontier 24-7. The defense did everything they could to slow down the Titans explosive offense.\n\nThe Golden Eagles beat Lemoore 27-26. With 1:50 to go, QB Tyler Patrick along with WR Marshel Sanders worked their magic and Lonnie Frank scored the game winning 1 yard TD with 25 seconds to go.\n\nCW will probably continue the clown show of rotating QBs but it won’t matter against a defense that struggles against a spread attack. It will matter when it really matters! If you want to disrupt a team and get players to start playing as a non team, then continue to rotate QBs because it’s working. In the long run, CW will throw their chances away from winning it all and that is sad for the outstanding senior class. This special class might never come around again. CW wide receiver Landon Wright returned the opening kickoff 85 yards for a TD. Landon might just be the best receiver in the Central Section and one of the best in the state.\n\nCan the Knights pound the ball and slow the game down? They did and it almost worked.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION GOLDEN EAGLES 36 KNIGHTS 17 (FINAL GOLDEN EAGLES 21 KNIGHTS 20)\n\nREEDLEY PIRATES (0-3) at COALINGA HORNED TOADS (3-0)\n\nThe young Pirates have lost 2 tough games that will make them a better team. The Toads beat up Selma 46-0. Junior QB Noah Tasi threw for 276 yards, 2 TD passes and scored on 2 rushing TDs.\n\nCan the Pirates slow down Tasi and the Toads offense?\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION TOADS 34 PIRATES 20 (FINAL TOADS 24 PIRATES 0)\n\nSELMA BEARS (0-4) at DINUBA EMPERORS (2-2)\n\nThe Bears come in struggling and the Emperors are getting better with every quarter they play in.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION EMPERORS 41 BEARS 13 (FINAL EMPERORS 41 BEARS 6)\n\nKERMAN LIONS (2-2) at SUNNYSIDE WILDCATS (2-1)\n\nThe Lions with a big win at Madera 28-22. Sophomore QB Adrian Torres threw for 224 yards and a TD. The Wildcats had a bye. The Lions can win this game if they can control the line of scrimmage and be extra physical!\n\nCJ Jones who was denied a transfer to Memorial because of a recruiting violation for playing 7 vs 7 this summer with SJM. (That’s a no-no) Sunnyside fought like hell on the transfer and won the battle. Here’s a kid that quit Sunnyside, wanted to go to Memorial to get better coaching, and lived with the Sunnyside Coach. I always remember what former Edison coach/49ers All Pro Tim McDonald used to say, “if a player doesn’t want to play for me then I don’t want him on my team”. There has been no paperwork for CJ to return to Sunnyside as of Wed Sept 6, but he can still play in this twilight zone world we live in. Sunnyside’s is like a 7 vs 7 offense so CJ as usual will go out, get open and throw the ball up to him.\n\nThis is crazy because there has to be a rule or bylaws that if a player transfers and they find out it’s an illegal transfer, that he just can’t go back and play at the old school the next game. You want to slow down transfers? This would be a start.\n\nIllegal transfer only happens at Roosevelt, especially if your dad is the AD.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION WILDCATS 36 LIONS 27 (FINAL WILDCATS 23 LIONS 22)\n\nBAKERSFIELD CHRISTIAN EAGLES (1-3) at SHAFTER GENERALS (4-0)\n\nThe Eagles lost to CVC 56-25 and the Generals beat the Drillers 31-7. The Generals trailed 14-2 at the half and Mariyon Sloan returned the 2nd half kickoff back for a TD to fire up the Generals. RB Chris Espinoza and the O-line dominated the 2nd half and controlled the line of scrimmage and beat the Drillers 31-17.\n\nCoach Pierucci used to coach at Bakersfield Christian but BC decided to bring in Darren Carr and Carr nation. I’m thinking this game is personal for some. Expect a loud home crowd on Thursday night.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION GENERALS 27 EAGLES 23 (FINAL GENERALS 35 EAGLES 34)\n\nPIONEER VALLEY PANTHERS (2-2) at DOS PALOS BRONCOS (3-1)\n\nThe Panthers beat Righetti High 35-28. For the first time since 2016, battle for the Helmet belongs back to the Panthers. QB Alex Garcia threw for 235 yards and 3 TD passes. ( Elias Giddings, Adrian Bautista and the 62-yard TD pass to Allan Jimenez-Meraz was the game winner)\n\nPepe Gonzalez sprinted 98 yards for a TD. Jimenez-Meraz scored on a 62 yard TD run,\n\nThe Broncos beat the Liberty Hawks 29-22. RB Andre Flores rushed for 200 yards and scored 3 TDs.\n\nThis will be another battle! Last year the Panthers beat the Broncos 28-27 on the coast. The X factor which team can control the line of scrimmage.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION BRONCOS 33 PANTHERS 30 (FINAL BRONCOS 41 PANTHERS 17)\n\nEL DIAMANTE MINERS (0-4) vs EDISON TIGERS (1-2)\n\nBoth teams come in struggling. Look for the Tigers to roll at Ratcliffe.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION TIGERS 27 MINERS 13 (FINAL TIGERS 21 MINERS 7)\n\nEXETER MONARCHS (4-0) at GRANITE HILLS GRIZZLIES (0-3)\n\nThe Monarchs are off to a great start especially on defense and will go 4-0.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION MONARCHS 41 GRIZZLIES 0 (FINAL MONARCHS 55 GRIZZLIES 0)\n\nHANFORD BULLPUPS (3-1) at FRONTIER TITANS (4-0)\n\nThe Bullpups beat Golden West 40-22. QB Daniel Gomez threw for 240 yards and tied a school record with 6 TD passes but after the game there was a fight when players were shaking hands but the CIF has decided to not suspend any players for fighting. The CIF said they do not have the authority to suspend any players because it was not during the contest and the referees were gone. If there is a fight after a game, it’s up to the individual team to do what’s best.\n\nThe Titans beat Bullard 24-7. QB Malakhi Statlter threw for 238 yards and a TD. The Titans come in with plenty of injuries.\n\nThe 2 top QBs in the Central Section will square off. Hanford will be at full strength and Frontier will come in banged up.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION BULLPUPS 40 TITANS 35 (FINAL TITANS 35 BULLPUPS 6)\n\nDELANO TIGERS (4-0) at GOLDEN VALLEY BULLDOGS (1-2)\n\nThis has the makings of a great game with 2 hot teams. The Bulldogs stepped up after a bad week from the horrible bus accident and took care of business.\n\nThe Tigers beat North 14-12. QB Eduardo Silva threw a TD pass and scored a TD.\n\nThe Bulldogs beat South 28-20. Senior Nate Abbott rushed for 143 yards and scored 3 TDs. Nate has stepped up to play QB at the right time when the Bulldogs needed a spark.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION BULLDOGS 21 TIGERS 19 (FINAL TIGERS 15 BULLDOGS 14)\n\nHOOVER PATRIOTS (1-2) vs HANFORD WEST HUSKIES (0-3)\n\nBoth teams come in and have yet to score a point this year. Somebody is scoring this game or this game could go on until Sunday.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION HUSKIES 13 PATRIOTS 12 (FINAL PATRIOTS 44 HUSKIES 21)\n\nKENNEDY THUNDERBIRDS (3-1) at EAST BLADES (0-3)\n\nThe Birds beat Highland 34-15. Sophomore RB Jace Demacabalin rushed for 220 yards and scored 2 TDs. Jamison Membreve rushed for 114 yards and scored 2 TDs.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION THUNDERBIRDS 50 BLADES 13 (FINAL BIRDS 43 BLADES 21)\n\nGOLDEN WEST TRAILBLAZERS (0-4) at KINGSBURG VIKINGS (4-0)\n\nThe Blazers lost to Hanford 40-22. The Blazers ran 66 plays to Hanford 27 offensive plays trying to slow the game down.The Blazers are playing a killer schedule.\n\nThe Vikings beat Dinuba 42-14. Kenyan Simpson returned a kickoff for 93-yard TD, caught an 84-yard TD pass and had a pick-6, That is what you call the HAT-TRICK.\n\nQB Max Warkentin threw for 207 yards and 3 TD passes. Chris Browe had a 105-yard pick-6.\n\nCan the Blazers slow the game down again? If GW can get into D4, watch out.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION VIKINGS 42 BLAZERS 21 (FINAL VIKINGS 31 BLAZERS 29)\n\nSANGER APACHES (3-1) at LEMOORE TIGERS (2-2)\n\nThe Apaches lost to Clovis East 42-21. This is one of the biggest and fastest teams in Apaches history. Izzy Robles, Jaden Chanthalangsy and Connor Bohlken each scored TDs.\n\nThe Tigers lost to Clovis West 27-26. Elijah Daley and Kobe Green each returned kickoffs for TDs.\n\nThe Apaches are loaded but a passing game. This should be a great game.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION APACHES 30 TIGERS 28 (FINAL APACHES 42 TIGERS 13)\n\nLIBERTY PATRIOTS (3-1) at BUCHANAN BEARS (1-3)\n\nThe Patriots lost to Santa Margarita 34-14. Cole O’Brien threw a 77-yard TD pass to Davari Degraffenried and Mekhi Deluth scored on a rushing TD. Every team in the Central Section is also losing to Santa Margarita and that’s why the Patriots remain the No 1 team on the Pagmeter.\n\nThe Bears lost to a very good Rocklin team 42-20.\n\nThe Patriots love playing at Buchanan. Last year in Bakersfield the game was called with 10:59 to go because of lightning with the Bears leading 35-27.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION PATRIOTS 34 BEARS 20 (FINAL PATRIOTS 35 BEARS 30)\n\nLINDSAY CARDINALS (2-1) at MCFARLAND COUGARS (2-2)\n\nThe Cardinals lost a tough one to Exeter 17-14 and the Cougars beat Granite Hills 19-0.\n\nCan the Cardinals offense break out?\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION CARDINALS 35 COUGARS 14 (FINAL CARDINALS 22 COUGARS 0)\n\nMADERA COYOTES (3-1) at MADERA SOUTH STALLIONS (0-3)\n\n15th annual Battle of the Saw\n\nThe Coyotes lost at home to Kerman 28-22 and the Stallions had a bye.\n\nThere is good news and bad news with this game.\n\nThe good news, it is great to see that MUSD did the right thing and let Madera South have a home game against big brother. 2-years ago, the Stallions were supposed to host Madera but Madera Unified said no way the Coyotes will play at Madera South stadium. Madera unified will load it up with extra bleachers. Madera South has a beautiful stadium and wants to show it off.\n\nThe bad news, MUSD let the Coyotes practice at Madera South on Wednesday. Wait…What!! Who does that! I can see if this was a state championship game and both teams travel and have a walk through practice at the stadium. This is unheard of. Home field advantage should be HOME FIELD advantage.\n\nThe Stallions are young and banged up and look for the Coyotes to roll in front of a huge crowd.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION COYOTES 52 STALLIONS 20 (FINAL COYOTES 48 STALLIONS 0)\n\nMT WHITNEY PIONEERS (1-3) vs MISSION OAK HAWKS (4-0)\n\nThe Pioneers come in losing to TW 36-21.

The Stars have yet to put it all together losing to Delano 14-12.\n\nOverall losing early is not a bad thing for both teams and it’s very smart especially with this crazy playoff format.

Go on YouTube and watch Franco Harris, former Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Famer..Caleb runs like a baby Franco.\n\nBoth teams don’t know each other and sometimes the film doesn’t give you all the answers.\n\nBoth teams are pretty young and the X factor is which defense will play better and make the big stops on a hot Saturday afternoon game. This is a long trip for the Bulldogs coming from Utah and usually HS teams struggle with long trips. The T Wolves have a solid 3 hour trip on the bus.\n\nThis has the makings to be a very good game.\n\nPAGMETER PREDICTION T WOLVES 33 BULLDOGS 30 (FINAL T WOLVES 41 BULLDOGS 24)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS LANCERS (2-2) at GARCES RAMS (1-3)\n\nThe Lancers beat Westlake 27-3.

Garces knew if they were going to play in 2023, it would be at SJM…Garces refused. It’s pretty obvious. This would have been Garces’ year to possibly beat SJM because SJM have had the Bishops trophy since 2017 and Panthers are way done this year. Moreover, what was discussed in 2018 was to have SJM host in 2019 and 2020 because SJM 75th anniversary was in 2020 but when the PLANdemic wiped it out, both teams returned to the normal rotation so Garces could celebrate their 75th in 2022. Otherwise Garces would have hosted in 2021 and SJM would have hosted in 2022 and therefore Garces would not have their 75th anniversary at Garces. So SJM actually accommodated Garces by hosting in 2021 instead of 2022.\n\nHOLY BOWL\n\n2022 at Garces\n\n2021 at SJM\n\n2020 No game (The world ended from the PLANdemic)\n\n2019 at SJM\n\n2019 at Garces\n\nThe Rivalry continues…. and they didn’t even play.

For the year Logan has thrown 9 TD passes and has scored 6 TDs.\n\nThe Knights had a bye\n\nThe problem for the back to back 8 man Champion Fresno Christian Eagles is to play a good team, they have to travel far.
