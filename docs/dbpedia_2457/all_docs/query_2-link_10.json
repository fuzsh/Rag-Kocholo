        "text": "Private school\n\nThe Webb Schools is the collective name for two private schools for grades 9–12, founded by Thompson Webb, located in Claremont, California. The Webb School of California for boys was established in 1922, and the Vivian Webb School for girls in 1981. Both are primarily boarding schools, but they also enroll a limited number of day students.[1] The Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology is a part of The Webb Schools.\n\nThe schools share a campus of approximately 150 acres (610,000 m2) in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. In 2018, Webb purchased undeveloped land next to the existing campus and will now preserve the hillside and create a buffer between the campus and suburban development. There are 410 students and 57 faculty members, of which 25% hold doctorates, 80% hold advanced degrees and 74% live on campus (as of the 2018-2019 school year).[2] Annual tuition (as of the 2023-2024 school year) is $76,985 for boarding students and $54,750 for day students, including meals, books, and fees.[3] For the 2019–20 school year, Webb offered $5.5 million in need-based aid to 35 percent of the families, with awards ranging from several thousand dollars to nearly the full cost of tuition.\n\nThe majority of ninth- and tenth-grade classes are taught in a single-sex environment. Co-educational courses are introduced to upperclassmen.[4]\n\nThe official student newspaper of The Webb Schools is the Webb Canyon Chronicle.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Webb School's founder, Thompson Webb, was born in 1887 as the youngest of eight children. His father, William Robert “Sawney” Webb, had established the Webb School in Tennessee in 1870.[6]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nRaymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology\n\n[edit]\n\nWebb is the only high school in the United States with a nationally accredited museum,[7] and the only high school in the world with a paleontology museum on campus.[8] The Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology is named for long-time Webb science teacher Raymond M. Alf (1905–1999). In the late 1930s, Alf and several students found a fossil skull in the Mojave Desert in the Barstow area. This discovery of a new species of Miocene-age peccary, Dyseohyus fricki,[8][9] inspired additional fossil-hunting trips in the western United States with student groups.\n\nAlf continued his pursuit of paleontology by earning his master's degree from the University of Colorado. The fossil hunting continued when Alf returned to Webb and he subsequently created a small museum in the basement of Jackson Library to house his collection of thousands of fossils. As the collection eventually outgrew the shelves in Alf's classroom and the library basement, the museum moved to its own campus building in 1968. Today the museum is professionally curated by Dr. Donald \"Doc\" Lofgren, and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. The museum features one of the largest collections of fossil animal footprints in the world,[10] and includes the original peccary skull found in 1937. The Alf Museum continues to sponsor paleontology field excursions over the summers and has contributed to the discovery of new species like Gryposaurus monumentensis, in the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. The fossils were removed and identified in collaboration with the University of Utah and the national monument.[11]\n\nThe latest in the museum's impressive discoveries includes \"Joe,\" the baby Parasaurolophus.[12] The dinosaur's 75 million-year-old fossilized remains were found by Webb student, Kevin M. Terris, in the summer of 2009. It took three years to completely excavate \"Joe\" from a ridge deep in the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument in Utah, including a helicopter lift out of the region. This extremely rare and important discovery provides groundbreaking information on how Parasaurolophus grew up.[13]\n\nVivian Webb Chapel\n\n[edit]\n\nFascinated by California missions, Thompson Webb took the mission at San Juan Capistrano as the inspiration for the Vivian Webb Chapel, a monument to both his religious faith and his love for his wife. In 1937, with the help of a small cement mixer and two hired workers, Thompson began making 60-pound (27 kg) adobe bricks. After a year of turning out more than 10,000 mission-style bricks and drying them in the sun on the school's tennis courts, he began building the chapel's foundation in 1938, and laid the chapel's first brick in 1939. He built the walls of the chapel with the help of students, parents, visitors, prospective students and even the governor of Tennessee.[14]\n\nNear completion of the structure, Webb learned that sculptor Alec Miller was in the United States because of World War II, and lacked the funds to return to his native Scotland. Miller was well known in England because of his carvings for the cathedral at Coventry.[15]\n\nThomas Jackson Library\n\n[edit]\n\nThe parents of Thomas Jackson donated the Thomas Jackson Library to the school as a memorial to their son, who graduated from Webb in 1930 but died of a heart attack while in his sophomore year at the California Institute of Technology. The library, dedicated in 1938, was designed by acclaimed architect Myron Hunt, who also built the Rose Bowl, the Pasadena main library, and Thompson and Vivian Webb's campus home. The building, in a Mediterranean style with small balconies on the second floor and a mezzanine balcony around the interior, won an Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects soon after its dedication.[16]\n\nNotable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nRelated schools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original Webb School founded by Thompson Webb's father still operates in Tennessee. A son of Thompson and Vivian Webb, Howell Webb, founded the Foothill Country Day School in Claremont in 1954.[26] A nephew, Robert Webb, started the Webb School of Knoxville in Tennessee in 1955.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nRaymond M.
