        "text": "The International Baccalaureate (IB) is a non-profit educational foundation offering four highly respected educational programs that develop the intellectual, personal, emotional and social skills needed to live, learn and work in a rapidly globalizing world.\n\nSchools must be authorized, by the IB organization, to offer any of the programs.\n\nThe IB has a hard-earned reputation for high standards of teaching and student achievement.\n\nStudents in 7th and 8th grade are not included in the GATE identification process in the Sacramento City Unified School District. Students who are identified as GATE in grades second through sixth will continue to be identified as GATE students throughout their middle and high school years. These classes include GATE identified students as well as students who have demonstrated high achievement or high potential.\n\nElementary, middle, and high school students are assigned to a designated neighborhood school based on where the student lives, as long as the school offers the services the student needs. Each neighborhood school has a defined geographic boundary and is intended to serve the students who live within that geographic boundary.\n\nGo to our Attendance Area page for more information about school boundaries, attendance maps and our neighborhood school locator."
