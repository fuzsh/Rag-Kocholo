        "text": "NC State head women's basketball coach Wes Moore announced on July 3, 2013 the hiring of former Wolfpack basketball playerRachel Stockdale as the program's Director of High School Relations. The 2015-16 season will be her third with the Wolfpack.\n\nStockdale, from High Point, N.C., was a four-year guard for Hall of Fame head coach Kay Yow from 2002-06. She helped guide the Wolfpack to three NCAA Tournament appearances and was an All-ACC Freshman team selection for the Pack.\n\n\"I'm truly thankful and blessed to have the opportunity to come back home to NC State,\" said Stockdale. \"I love everything about this place! I have a great deal of respect for Coach Moore, and as a proven winner, I'm excited about the future of the Wolfpack women.\n\n\"I look forward to the journey of building and cultivating the relationships surrounding our program.\"\n\nIn this new role, Stockdale will coordinate all recruiting activities for prospective student-athletes, which includes organizing all official and unofficial visits to campus.\n\nStockdale will also be tasked with supervising graduate assistants and student assistants, as well as organizing both coaching clinics and high school camps.\n\n\"Rachel is a perfect fit for us as a former Wolfpack player,\" said Moore. \"It's great to have someone on the staff who has the passion she brings for this program and NC State.\n\n\"She is from North Carolina.

The Pirates fashioned a 22-10 record and made a trip to the Postseason WNIT in her only season in Greenville.\n\nShe spent the previous season as an assistant coach at Wake Forest University.

Wake won 20 games for just the second time ever and made a trip to the postseason for only the fifth time in school history.\n\n\"Recruiting North Carolina is a big priority for this staff,\" explained Moore. \"Obviously having somebody with Rachel's background is going to make the job transition a little bit smoother as we reach out to coaches.\"\n\nBefore arriving in Winston-Salem, Stockdale helped Elon reach new heights as an assistant coach.
