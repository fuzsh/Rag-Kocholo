        "text": "The Duke field hockey program is thrilled to welcome five newcomers to the Blue Devil family this fall. The group hails from three different states – Pennsylvania, Illinois, Connecticut – and two countries – Germany and England.\n\nOver the coming weeks, we will profile each of the incoming Blue Devils, starting with Ashley Stockdale, hailing from the Constitution State.\n\nPam Bustin on Stockdale\n\n\"Welcome Ashley to the Duke True hockey program! Ashley brings to Duke her impressive speed along with her composed, yet fiery intensity. A standout within both the Darien High School and AGH Club programs, Ashley has led both teams to great success. She knows how to attack the goal cage – racking up points in the assists and goal scoring columns and can also distribute the ball out of the midfield. Her athleticism will make her quite versatile as she continues to develop and grow within the D1 collegiate level. I am excited about what lies ahead for Ashley and for the impact she will have on Duke True. We can't wait to welcome her to campus!\"\n\nComing to Durham from Darien, Conn., Stockdale is capable of playing both in the midfield and forward positions, earning a top-50 ranking from Max Field Hockey. She played for Darien High School and for AGH on the club circuit.\n\nStockdale had a standout career for Darien High School, breaking the career record for points with an amazing 161. Her 51 assists in her four years also set a record for the Blue Wave. The speedy Stockdale saved her best season for last, setting the school record for goals (32), assists (28) and points (92) to earn countless honors, including NFHCA All-America recognition. One of 25 finalists for the USA Today High School Field Hockey National Player of the Year honor, Stockdale also was named the 2023 CHSCA Player of the Year after guiding the Blue Wave to and undefeated regular season and second place in the Connecticut State Tournament among Class L schools.\n\nStockdale preceded her standout senior campaign by leading the Blue Wave to an undefeated 23-0 record and a Connecticut State Championship her junior season. She earned the first of her two all-state honors and was voted to the Max Field Hockey All-America third team and All-Northeast Region first team. Overall, Stockdale started all four years for Darien and garnered an All-FCIAC recognition in three of her four seasons.\n\nThe success for Stockdale on the hockey field continued with her club AGH. Playing with both the U-16 and U-19 squads during her time with the club, she helped AGH to runner-up finishes at the U-19 National Club Championship in 2022 and 2023 and to the 2022 National Indoor Tournament titles in both levels. Stockdale also helped guide the U-16 AGH squad to second place at the 2022 National Club Championship and a top ranking nationally that year. Standing at 5-7, Stockdale also has taken part in USA Field Hockey Rise Selection Camps and various Nexus Junior tournaments, including finishing fourth last year at the Nexus Junior Championship.\n\nGet to Know Ashley\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about home?\n\nMy favorite thing about home is my family and friends.\n\nWhat Taylor Swift era would you be and why?\n\nI would be Taylor Swift's Fearless era because I love country music.\n\nWhere is the best place field hockey has taken you?\n\nThe best place field hockey has taken me is near the beach.\n\nOther than hockey, what is your favorite summer Olympic sport or event?\n\nMy favorite summer Olympic sport is gymnastics.\n\nWhat is your go-to coffee or drink order?\n\nI don't drink coffee.\n\nWhat's your spirit animal and why?\n\nMy spirit animal would be a wolf because I'm very loyal and hard working.\n\nIf you could be any animal for one day, what would it be?\n\nI would want to be a bird.\n\nTo stay up to date with Blue Devils field hockey, follow the team on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook by searching \"DukeFH\".\n\nDuke Centennial\n\nIn 2024, Duke celebrates its Centennial, marking one hundred years since Trinity College became Duke University.
