        "text": "There were some nail-biters, and there were a couple of blowouts. And a couple of first-time champions.\n\nThe 2023 Central Section football championships offered a little bit of everything Friday night. Now the six champions will have to wait for Sunday's CIF meeting to find out where they will play their regional championship games.\n\nThe winners of those next weekend, advance to the state championships at three Southern California destinations Dec. 8-9.\n\nHere are the results from all six Central Section championship games played on Saturday.\n\nDivision 1\n\nFinal: Clovis North 24, Central 14\n\nRecords: Clovis North 13-0, Central 10-4\n\nThe Broncos trailed 14-7 at halftime and a dream perfect season and hopes for a first section championship in more than a decade was in jeopardy.\n\nNot a chance.\n\nThe state's No. 9 team simply scored 17 unanswered points and rode the strong legs of McKay Madsen who rushed for 110 yards and three touchdowns to give the Broncos their third section crown and first since 2012.\n\nSee game story.\n\nPREGAME\n\nNo. 7 seed Central (10-3) at No. 1 Clovis North (12-0)\n\nPlayoff road: Central defeated No. 10 Arroyo Grande 42-14, No. 2 Frontier 36-32, No. 3 Liberty 35-21. Clovis North defeated No. 8 Clovis West 34-0, No. 4 Clovis East 34-28\n\nSection titles: Central 3, Clovis North 2\n\nPreview: Central comes in scorching hot, defeating No. 2 Frontier and No. 3 Liberty on the road and will play in their sixth D1 title game in the last seven years under coach Kyle Biggs. Senior QB Dave Marquez is playing lights out football with 958 yards and 13 TDs in three playoff wins and Braylon Hall is as tough as they come, catching 11 passes for 197 yards and 2 TDs in the semifinal win over defending champion Liberty and the game-winner with 11 seconds against Frontier. The run game is solid with sophomore Brandon Smith and junior David Bell combining for 1,451 yards and 11 TDs. However, turnovers for the Grizzlies have been an issue all season with 13 INTs and 7 fumbles lost compared to Clovis North, who has only two give-aways, both on lost fumbles in garbage time.\n\nNo one has been able to solve the Broncos physical rushing attack all season, and those 3,472 yards and 50 TDs are paved by big-dudes James Cazares, Ayden Gumm, Preston Fletcher, Davit Boyajyan and Gus Gomez. Explosive RB Jackson Cinfel (1,771 yards, 17 TDs and only a junior) ran for scores of 75 and 86 in the first quarter against Clovis East last Friday and at 185 pounds can bench an impressive 330 lbs. RB/LB McKay Madsen (2nd place finisher at the 2022 CIF State Track and Field in discus) and WR/S Vincent Cordoba are two of the top two-way players in the section and will be tasked on defense to spy Marquez–who has 11 rushing TDs–and the talented Central receivers. The Broncos are one of the most physically imposing teams in recent memory, a tribute to their dedication to the weight room. And remember–three years ago the Broncos went 0-3 in the COVID shortened season and was trounced 69-0 by Central.\n\nFun fact: Central is 15-2 in the playoffs since 2017 including titles in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and a CIF State 1-A championship in 2019. Clovis North is the last Clovis Unified school to win a D1 title in 2012, when they beat Central 27-10.\n\nPredicted score: Clovis North 28 Central 27\n\nDivision 2\n\nFinal score: Central Valley Christian 27, Lemoore 26\n\nRecords: Central Valley Christian 13-1, Lemoore 10-4\n\nFresno State-bound running back Bryson Donnelson hauled in a 53-yard pass from Brent Kroeze with 4:28 left in the fourth quarter to pull out the thrilling victory. It was the seven section crown for the Cavaliers, who won their semifinal game also by a single point, 43-42. The victory avenged a 62-46 loss to Lemoore in last year's championship. Donelson had an 80-yard touchdown run in Friday's win\n\nPREGAME\n\nPlayoff road: Lemoore defeated No. 15 Justin Garza 38-27, No. 7 Sunnyside 38-22, No. 3 Centennial 20-14. Central Valley Christian defeated No. 16 Stockdale 43-7, No. 9 Tehachapi 48-27, No. 4 Tulare 43-42\n\nSection titles: Central Valley Christian 6, Lemoore 2\n\nPreview: A rematch of last season’s final that saw Lemoore beat CVC 62-46 features an aggressive Tigers’ defense that’s recorded 42.5 sacks, 17 interceptions and 18 fumble recoveries. However, that defense will have to figure out powerful and speedy Fresno State commit Bryson Donelson, who torched both Tehachapi (33-391-6) and Tulare (37-330-4) to reach the title game. Lemoore has two-way talent in Kobe Green (9 INTs, 506 receiving yards, 4 TDs) and running back Elijah Daley (690 rushing yards, 10 TDs). Junior QB Aiden McDaniel has been thrust into the starting role and has thrown twice as many interceptions as TDs: 6 to 3.\n\nDonelson, the best running back prospect in the section since Buchanan’s Kendall Milton, averages 12.6 yards every time he touches the football to go along with 37 TDs. The Cavaliers are no slouch in the passing either with senior QB Brent Kroeze (2,272 yards, 29 TDs, 2 INT) and main target Gunnar Piepgrass (781 yards, 9 TDs). The versatile Donelson is effective in the passing game as well with 393 yards and six TDs and also serves as the main punter. The defense has recorded 16 INTs, led by Cayden Ritchie’s five.\n\nFun fact: Central Valley Christian, who is playing in their sixth straight Central Section final, has only one loss this season, a 48-14 setback to D1 finalist and undefeated Clovis North.\n\nPrediction: Central Valley Christian 34 Lemoore 29\n\nDivision 3\n\nFinal: Mission Oak 34, Kerman 14\n\nRecords: Mission Oak 9-5, Kerman 8-6\n\nMission Oak, the third seed, spoiled Kerman's first chance at a section title, scoring 34 unanswered points after falling behind 7-0. It was the first title for the Hawks who came in riding an opportunistic defense (30 takaways) and the passing game of Daniel Gonzalez (2,566 passing yards, 29 touchdowns. Kerman has had a football team since 1920.\n\nPREGAME\n\nSection titles: Kerman 0, Mission Oak 0\n\nPlayoff road: Kerman defeated No. 12 Golden West 30-29, No. 4 Kennedy 34-28, No. 1 Mission Prep 20-14. Mission Oak defeated No. 14 Independence 38-31, No. 6 Mt. Whitney 35-12, No. 7 Washington Union 39-25.\n\nPreview: The Lions remarkable run to the title game included playoff wins on the final play of the game on a 75-yard run by Christian Velez to beat Kennedy and on a TD pass from Aiden Torrez to Adam Delgado to stun top-seed Mission Prep in OT. The “We Believe” mantra from second-year coach Damon Jenkins, who prepped at De La Salle during their historic 151-game winning streak, has proved tall behind Velez (816 rushing yards, 11 TDs), Torrez (2,532 passing yards, 23 TDs) and Adam Delgado (906 receiving yards, 10 TDs).\n\nIt’s run for show and pass for dough as Mission Oak’s passing game is dangerous and boasts a solid running game. QB Daniel Gonzalez has passed for 2,566 yards and 29 TDs and the team has rushed for 2,031 yards and 26 TDs. The defense has created 30 turnovers (17 INTs and 13 fumble recoveries) led by Cameron Azaveco’s five interceptions.\n\nFun fact: This is the first ever Central Section football game game for Kerman (pop. 16,174), a school that started football in 1920.\n\nPrediction: Kerman 21 Mission Oak 20\n\nDivision 4\n\nMatilda Torres 69, Dos Palos 14\n\nRecords: Torres 11-3, Dos Palos 11-2\n\nHistory made no difference in this one as the visiting Toros romped to win their first section championship against the 15-time champion and host Broncos. Torres, coming off a 42-41 road win over No. 1 Shafter, broke Dos Palos' 11-game win streak as Joseph Bass rushed for three touchdowns, including a 60-yarder to go up 14-0. With eight minutes left in the second quarter, Torres led 42-0.\n\nPREGAME\n\nPlayoff road: Torres defeated No. 12 Immanuel 43-14, No. 4 Coalinga 21-19, No. 1 Shafter 43-42. Dos Palos defeated No. 10 Santa Maria 45-28, No. 3 Exeter 28-21\n\nSection titles: Matilda Torres 0, Dos Palos 15\n\nReview: Torres, in only its third year of varsity football, reached the finals after beating No. 1 Shafter in OT on a controversial game-ending play that caught the eyes and ears of a national audience when the long-snapper caught a two-point conversion that was not called. Nevertheless, the balanced Toros feature two 1,000 yard running backs in Joseph Bass (1,132 yards) and Amani Sua (1,080) who have combined for 32 TD. The Toros average 39.7 points per game and have an efficient QB in Jose Soriano who’s completed 70% of his passes with 22 TDs to only two interceptions.\n\nDecorated Dos Palos comes into the final having won 11 straight and led by sophomore running back Andre Flores’ 1,346 yards and 21 TDs. Senior QB Peyton Van Worth has passed for 1,686 yards and 13 TDs and has thrown only one interception. Kicking could be a factor in this one and the Broncos have a good one in sophomore Jesus Bon, who has converted 37-38 XPs and 6 of 7 FGs on the season. Home field advantage looms large for the small community of 5,575.\n\nFun fact: Dos Palos won five straight Central Section titles from 1997-2001 but none since 2006. In fact, they’ve won 15 total from 1936-2006, second in section history to Bakersfield’s 38.\n\nPrediction: Torres 32 Dos Palos 20\n\nDivision 5\n\nWasco 42, Bishop Union 41\n\nRecord: Wasco 8-5, Bishop Union 11-2\n\nHami Lopez scored four touchdowns and Mike Dominguez two, leading the second-seeded Tigers, who won their third section title but first since 2012. Wasco took a big lead and then held on against the top-seeded and Broncos (11-2). \"It means a lot to the program, it means a lot to the town,\" Wasco coach Chad Martinez told the Bakersfield Californian.\n\nPREGAME\n\nRoad to the finals: Wasco defeated No. 10 Reedley 28-21, No. 3 Liberty-Madera 23-10. Bishop Union defeated No. 9 North 55-43, No. 4 Morro Bay 28-26\n\nSection titles: Wasco 2, Bishop Union 1\n\nPreview: Despite going 5-5 in the regular season Wasco was awarded the No. 2 seed in Division 5 and got hot at the right time, defeating Reedley and Liberty-Madera. And they’ll have to travel over 4 ½ hours to face the top seed in Bishop Union, who, in addition to all the major sports, has a snowboard and ski team. Bishop Union is led by senior QB Boden St. Marie, who has passed for 1,555 yards, 16 TDs and rushed for 12 more scores. Running back Austin Powell has rushed for 1,188 yards and 14 TDs.\n\nFun fact: Bishop Union joined the Central Section from the Southern Section in 2013 and won the 2019 D6 title. Wasco’s last title was in 2012, 60 years after their first title in 1962.\n\nPrediction: Wasco 26 Bishop Union 19\n\nDivision 6\n\nStrathmore 14, Mendota 7\n\nRecords: Strathmore 10-4, Mendota 7-7\n\nJacob Poole scored on an 85-yard kickoff return to tie the score at 7-7, then scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 2-yard run with 3:05 left in the third quarter as Spartans won their 10th game of the season, this one on the road. It turned around a 20-0 loss to Mendota on Sept. 1. Poole rushed for 1,501 yards and 19 touchdowns heading into the game.\n\nPREPGAME\n\nRoad to the Final: Strathmore defeated No. 13 Kern Valley 49-13, No. 5 Woodlake 27-21, No. 1 Arvin 28-21. Mendota defeated No. 14 Football 42-7, No. 6 Taft 42-28, No. 7 Fowler 56-44.\n\nPreview: Defensively the Spartans are led by Julian Ceballos who has recorded 87 tackles and 12 tackles for loss. Mendota counters with two very capable running backs in Jesse Rodriguez (1,315 yards, 13 TDs) and Donnie Munoz (1,120, 15).\n\nFun fact: The Aztecs and Spartans are the only Central Section finals matchup to not feature an animal as their mascot."
