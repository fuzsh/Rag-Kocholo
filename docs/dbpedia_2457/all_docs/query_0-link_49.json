        "text": "And then there were six (half of Final Four decided)\n\nThough I was one of many who thought Maryland overrated this season, I don't think I'm alone in saying Louisville came out of nowhere this year to win tonight. I wouldn't have thought \"Final Four\" and Louisville to be in the same sentence at the end of March, but they were really gritty tonight. They wanted the win, which is more than it looked like Maryland wanted. I'm not going to speculate, but Louisville's hunger for victory was palpable tonight.\n\nESPN story link: http://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=294000030\n\nI was laughing at the way Louisville was starting to jump up and down.........until Marissa Coleman stepped to the FT line with tears in her eyes. When she came out of the game she walked into Coach Brenda Frese's arms and wouldn't leave them. Just inconsolable on the bench. It was sad.\n\nThen Card Angel McCoughtry started yelling into the camera to Kara Lawson, about how she'd see her in St. Louis (Lawson had picked the Terps to win). McCoughtry also said she was ready for Obama before getting off camera. Some people thought it was in poor taste, but I'm willing to give the kid the benefit of the doubt. We all do and say wack stuff when we're excited.\n\nThis piece in today's Baltimore Sun provides some insight into McCoughtry's personality:\n\nhttp://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/basketball/womens/bal-sp.mccoughtry30mar30,0,1749103.story\n\nIn Angel, Roi and his wife, Sharon, had a capricious child, one who didn't like the word \"no\" and often brought her mother to tears.\n\n\"I'm sort of a quiet, laid-back person, and I thought I'd have a quiet, laid-back child,\" Sharon said. \"But she was just the opposite. If I told her, 'Let's do this,' she'd do the opposite. Now that I realize, she had all that energy for a reason; it just had to be channeled into something.\"\n\nBasketball became the perfect outlet. Growing up in Baltimore's Northwood neighborhood, there was always a game nearby for a teenage McCoughtry. It usually meant playing against boys, though older, quicker and tougher.\n\nAnd here's another testament to hard work:\n\nOnce on campus, she kept working on her game and kept improving. As a sophomore, McCoughtry was named Big East Player of the Year.\n\n\"I joke with her that I'm not sure how many friends she has,\" Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. \"She's always in the gym.\"\n\nI'd like to take a moment to thank all the young men all over the country who had no problem playing with McCoughtry, Dawn Staley, and countless other women who went on to great things in the sport they love because of it.\n\nOn the other side of the NCAA tourney, and the country, Jayne Appel is taking over where Candice Wiggins left off last year. Forty-six points is pretty amazing.\n\nESPN story link: http://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=294000015\n\nAppel story link: http://www.mercurynews.com/sportsheadlines/ci_12026703?nclick_check=1\n\n“She’s a 10 out of 10,” teammate Jillian Harmon said, describing Appel’s mental toughness. “You can count on her. She’s going to do whatever it takes.”\n\nTenacity and toughness are great things.\n\nBut all this leaves me a little uncertain. Have I mentioned I'm going to the Final Four? First time, and it's more than a little ironic that my team got knocked out in the first round. Even more ironic when I consider that the likely matchup on one side of the semi-finals - Stanford and Connecticut - will probably be the true championship game. Because let's face it, ladies and gentlemen, those are the top two teams in the country right now. Not taking away anything from Oklahoma (who will also probably win tomorrow, alongside the Huskies), but Stanford and Connecticut have been kicking butt and taking names this post-season. The only way either/one of them will lose in the next week or so is to each other.\n\nFaced with that, I'm prepared for this year's championship game to be a bit of a letdown (unless some wild upset takes place). I just hope it's not like the 2005 game, when Baylor kicked the butts of Michigan State.\n\nOn the bright side, I'm not emotionally invested in any team right now, so I can just enjoy myself in St. Louis.\n\nTomorrow:\n\nConnecticut vs. ASU, 4 PDT/7 EDT\n\nPurdue vs. Oklahmoa, 6/9\n\nSparks sign Marta Fernandez\n\nFresh from Sparks HQ:\n\nSPARKS SIGN GUARD MARTA FERNANDEZ\n\nSpanish League MVP Returns to Los Angeles\n\nLOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles Sparks have re-signed guard Marta Fernandez, Vice President and General Manager Penny Toler announced today. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nOriginally signed by the Sparks as a free agent in February 2007, Fernandez started 20 of 34 games for the Sparks and averaged 8.7 points, 3.0 assists and 2.1 rebounds in 26.2 minutes per game. The 5'11\" guard spent the 2008-2009 season in Poland playing for Wisla Can-Pack Krakow appearing in 34 games and averaging 10.0 points, 2.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 32.5 minutes, while shooting 52% from the field and recording a season high 23 points in November 2008.\n\n\"We're very happy that Marta will be back in Los Angeles,\" said Sparks Head Coach Michael Cooper. \"She's a very talented and experienced guard that is a great addition to our roster.\"\n\nA native of Spain, Fernandez spent 2004-2006 playing for U.B. Barca where she averaged 18.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game. In 2006 she was the MVP of the Women's Spanish League, Domestic Player of the Year, named to the Spanish League First Team and the Spanish All-Domestic Player Team.\n\n\"I'm really happy to have the opportunity to be back in L.A. It was a great experience for me two years ago,\" said Fernandez. \"There are great people surrounding the team, from the coaches to the players to the basketball staff. I can't wait to get back because I love the city and I'm excited about the great team they've put together that can make a run for the championship.\"\n\nWith the signing of Fernandez, the Sparks add another Olympian to their roster. Fernandez was a member of the Spanish National Team that finished sixth at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece. During the games she averaged 9.3 points and 1.6 assists in seven contests. The Sparks also have the only two active brother-sister combos between the NBA and WNBA. Forward Candace Parker's brother Anthony plays for the Toronto Raptors and Fernandez's brother Rudy plays for the Portland Trailblazers.\n\nThe WNBA season will tip-off June 6th as the Sparks take on the Defending Champion Detroit Shock at the STAPLES Center at 11:30am.

MARY'S (Stockton) def. INGLEWOOD 71-62\n\nAfure Jemerigbe scored 21 points as St. Mary’s of Stockton won its fifth state title by beating Inglewood, 71-62, in the girls' Division III state championship game.\n\nAlle Moreno added 21 for St. Mary’s (31-3) and Chelsea Gray had 14. The Rams used their trapping, pressure defense to force 36 Inglewood turnovers, which offset a 54-36 deficit on the boards.\n\nTayler Champion led Inglewood with 23 points and 13 rebounds, while Hazel Ramirez scored 13. The Sentinels’ official record for the season is 19-17 due to a series of early forfeits, but on the floor, they were 31-5.\n\nAfter some early sputtering, St. Mary‘s broke a 13-13 tie and went on a 37-12 run en route to a 50-25 lead. After that, however, Inglewood battled back, and outscored the Rams 29-12 to get within 12. Unfortunately for Sentinels’ fans, there were only 53 seconds left at that point, and St. Mary’s was simply too far ahead.\n\nSportsmanship Award: Tayler Champion, Inglewood; Ali Gibson, St. Mary's\n\nDIVISION I GIRLS\n\nPOLY (Long Beach) def. MONTE VISTA (Danville) 57-33\n\nLong Beach Poly used its depth and balance to win its fourth straight girls’ Division I state title, and tie a Calfornia record for most consecutive championships. The victim this time was Monte Vista of Danville, which fell 57-33.\n\nThe Jackrabbits (32-3) got 12 points from Ta’Nitra Byrd and 10 more from 6-3 Monique Oliver, but nine different players scored for Poly, and 11 had rebounds.\n\nThe Mustangs (29-3) jumped out to 6-1 and 10-7 leads, and Poly didn’t lead at all until 6:22 remained in the second quarter. The Jackrabbits carried only a two-point advantage into the locker room.\n\nNiveen Rasheed topped Monte Vista with 16 points, but unlike Poly, there wasn’t much help. Only one other player made more than one basket, and thus the Jackrabbits were able to focus on Rasheed.\n\nMonte Vista stayed close through the first two minutes of the third quarter by outrebounding Poly, and also refusing to buckle under the Jackrabbits’ defensive pressure. The Mustangs hung back in a zone and dared Poly to make outside shots -- and the Jackrabbit starters responded by going one for 13 from the field in the first half.\n\nBut Poly broke the game open early in the third quarter, going on a 15-3 run to turn a 21-20 lead into a 36-23 advantage. Oliver made some unlikely contributions to that outburst, hitting a three and handing out two assists, but coach Carl Buggs had called a timeout during the run to make sure that Poly’s posts got plenty of touches, and the move paid off. Byrd hit three free throws during that span, and Monte Vista never threatened thereafter.\n\nSportsmanship Award: Jazzmine Shirley, Long Beach Poly; Alexandra Whalen, Monte Vista\n\nDIVISION IV GIRLS\n\nMATER DEI CATHOLIC (Chula Vista) def. MODESTO CHRISTIAN 54-51\n\nEbone Henry capped a 10-point Mater Dei of Chula Vista comeback in the final 3:36 of the fourth quarter with a series of big shots as the Crusaders edged Modesto Christian, 54-51, in the girls’ Division IV state championship game.\n\nWith Mater Dei (30-3) down by three with 1:13 remaining, Henry (11pts, 11 rebs) completed an old-fashioned three-point play with a free throw that tied the game, and then hit two free throws with 27 seconds left to give the Southern Californians the lead for good.\n\nMater Dei’s Jhazmine Lynch led all scorers with 18 points, and Soulijah Evans added 14 points and 10 rebounds as the Chula Vista school won its first state title.\n\nBrandi Henton had 14 points and nine rebounds for Modesto Christian (27-8). Taryn Garza finished with 13 points and Danielle Thompson had 10 for the Central Valley school.\n\nModesto Christian controlled the game early, taking an 11-10 lead in the first quarter and jumping out to a 12-point halftime margin. Mater Dei made several runs at the lead in the third period, but Modesto Christian had an answer -- until the steady Mater Dei pressure finally wore down the Northern California representative.\n\nAfter Lauren Lucchesi gave Modesto Christian a 49-39 lead, Henry started the comeback with a pair of free throws. Lynch then scored six points in just over a minute to cut the margin to one, but Lucchesi calmly made two more free throws to stretch the lead to 51-48 with 1:36 left.\n\nSportsmanship Award: Kamela Jackson, Mater Dei Catholic; Taryn Garza, Modesto Christian\n\nDIVISION II GIRLS\n\nBREA OLINDA (Brea) def. CARONDELET (Concord) 68-45\n\nBrea Olinda now stands alone. The Ladycats won their ninth California title, defeating Carondelet of Concord, 68-45, in the girls’ Division II title game. That trophy moves Brea past the Crenshaw boys, who have eight state trophies.\n\nJunior guard Kelsey Harris led the way for the Ladycats, scoring 25 points as Brea (33-2) won its 27th straight game (including a 44-38 victory over previously number one in the nation Mater Dei of Santa Ana). The Ladycats came into the game ranked third in the U.S., and did nothing to detract from that lofty status. After Carondelet took a 4-3 lead with 6:48 to go in the first quarter, it was all Brea thereafter. It was 37-18 at the half, and the Cougars never got closer than 15 points in the final two periods.\n\nSophomore Erica Payne led Carondelet (29-4) with 18 points and eight reobunds, but the Cougars’ offense was stymied by the harassing Brea defense, and Carondelet managed to shoot just 29 percent from the field while turning the ball over 25 times.\n\nBrea-Olinda has been a California power since the 1980s. The Ladycats won four straight championships from 1991 to 1994, and three straight from 1998 through 2000. They have lost twice in the title game, in 1990 and 2007. Carondelet took the championship in 2004, but lost in 2006.\n\nSportsmanship Award: Kelsey Harris, Brea Olinda; Alyssa Flores, Carondelet\n\nDIVISION V GIRLS\n\nBELLARMINE-JEFFERSON (Burbank) def. PINEWOOD (Los Altos Hills) 55-47\n\nShelley Gupilan scored 22 points as Bellarmine-Jefferson of Burbank completed a 34-1 season with an 54-47 win over Pinewood of Los Altos Hills in the Division V girls’ state championship.\n\nGupilan’s cousin Margeaux added 13 points, including back-to-back three-pointers at the end of the first that extended Bell-Jeff’s lead to 31-20 at the break. Though Pinewood rallied in the fourth quarter, the final margin was the closest the Panthers could get.\n\nLindsay Nickel scored 16 points for Pinewood (31-5) and Hailie Eackles had\n\n15 to go along with 10 rebounds. The Panthers had won three previous state championships, in 1999, 2005 and 2006, but could never get comfortable against Bell-Jeff’s full-court pressure. Pinewood turned the ball over 22 times and shot just 28 percent -- and made only six of 28 three-pointers.\n\nThe Guards’ only loss was to Montclair Prep on Dec. 30, by a 63-62 score, and they finished the season on a 20-game winning streak.\n\nSportsmanship Award: Elizabeth Hawthorne, Bellarmine-Jefferson; Lindsay Nickel, Pinewood\n\nLink: http://www.cifstate.org/sports/state/basketball/finals_state09.html\n\nWhat to do if you think your daughter's coach has violated one or more rules\n\nSome comments here recently have indicated that some parents think the coach or coaches of their daughter's basketball team have committed rule violations. So I've done a little research.\n\nThis section of the California Interscholastic Federation website serves as a resource in determining if a violation has indeed occurred:\n\nhttp://www.cifstate.org/governance/transfer_eligibility/index.html\n\nThe CIF is broken down into 10 regions, and each has a local office. I called both the City Section and Southern Section offices this morning to ask what the proper procedure is for a parent wishing to file a complaint.\n\nA spokeswoman for the City Section office said all complaints are welcome, but only those that are signed with the writer's legitimate name, address and phone number will warrant an investigation. She also said that the confidentiality of the letter writers will be protected in the event of an investigation. A spokeswoman for the Southern Section office said the same policies held true there. Written correspondence should be sent to:\n\n(City Section)\n\nTrent Cornelius, Commissioner, girl's basketball\n\n1545 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 200\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90017\n\n(Southern Section)\n\nSharon Hodge, Commissioner, girl's basketball\n\n10932 Pine Street\n\nLos Alamitos, CA 90720-2428\n\nList of all 10 section offices:\n\nhttp://www.cifstate.org/about/sections/index.html\n\nI encourage those who feel they have a legitimate complaint to step up and say something. Don't just complain about it on a message board or a blog. If you really feel your daughter is being cheated, you must speak out on her behalf. She's a kid; she needs you to help her.\n\nI believe that too many people feel like they could \"never\" make a difference by speaking out. But the more I've lived the more I've seen that 1. it's amazing what you get if you just ask and 2. if you speak out and be persistent, you get places.\n\nFinally, last night I changed my profile to include an email address where you can reach me with comments or questions. I've never claimed to know everything, but I'm great at finding out what I don't know.\n\nDon't be nasty like some of my ninth-grade students: hoopism@yahoo.com\n\nBev Smith won't return to Oregon\n\nTo no one's surprise, eight-year Oregon coach Bev Smith's contract won't be renewed. The announcement was made just a short time ago:\n\nhttp://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&ATCLID=3694061&DB_OEM_ID=500\n\nThough I expected it, it's tremendously sad for me. Bev Smith was my first basketball hero - she was pretty much the reason I got into the sport in the first place.\n\nI remember how they honored her on senior night in 1982, with a special ceremony and lots of signs in the rafters. I remember how, a short time later, Oregon lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, on March 13, 1982, to Mizzou. I remember the picture of Bev, anguished on the bench, in the paper the next morning - a Sunday. And that day, I went for a run for the first time.\n\nIt's 27 years later and I'm still running, and I am enjoying the benefits of having been an athlete for most of my life: strong heart, low cholesterol, etc. I owe it to Bev Smith for the original inspiration.\n\nI have no idea why she wasn't able to be an effective coach for Oregon, and I appreciate how excruciating it must have been for Oregon officials to dismiss her. I hope that Bev will find happiness in future endeavors, whatever they are. Her legacy as a player remains the same as it has been for almost three decades.\n\nEdit March 17 to add link from the Register Guard: http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/sports/9848491-41/story.csp\n\nKilkenny said senior associate athletic directors Renee Baumgartner and Joe Giansante would join him on a search committee for Smith’s replacement. Kilkenny said he’d like to have a new coach in place within 30 days.\n\nWith a new arena on the horizon, the Ducks want a coach with name recognition who will play an up-tempo, high-scoring style that will be attractive to both traditional women’s basketball fans and newcomers to the sport.\n\nAs an Oregon alumni, I'd like to see this too. I have an Oregon women's basketball T-shirt in my closet that I haven't worn for a long time.\n\nShocker in Westwood: Brea Olinda 44, Mater Dei 38\n\nBrea did it - they took on the dragon and they won. The matchup that everyone had been waiting for all year was surprisingly one-sided, as the Wildcats dominated the number one-ranked team from beginning to end, and handed them their first loss of the season when all was said and done.\n\nSenior guard Jonae Ervin lead all scorers with 18 points in a gutty performance that saw her do everything from drive to the basket for the layup to steal the ball to sink crucial free throw shots. Ervin told OCvarsity.com that \"this is the game to prove we are the better team, and we proved it.\"\n\nIndeed. She was named MVP of the game.\n\nStory link, featuring videos: http://www.ocvarsity.com/articles/game-state-olinda-2335761-brea-dei\n\nBoth teams looked nervous to start the game, as a veritable turnover fest ran for the entire first quarter and most of the second. But what did it for Brea was their defense. Though shorter and smaller than the physical Monarchs, the Wildcats played suffocating defense and double-teamed Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis on every possession. The sophomore sensation was held to just four points on the day.\n\nBrea sophomore guard Alexis Perry takes it up the right side.\n\nKaleena Mosqueda-Lewis and Janier Olukemi line up for a free throw shot.\n\nBrea celebrates the victory.......\n\n......and keeps celebrating.\n\nA subdued Mater Dei prepares to accept their second-place award.\n\nMosqueda-Lewis and Alexyz Vailotama approach the medal stand.\n\nI ended up sitting in front of the former attendance secretary at Brea (25 years before retiring a long time ago), whose crew was pretty amusing. They were gracious about their opponents, and the husband of her friend said with a shrug, \"Brea will enjoy it now, because Mater Dei will be untouchable for the next several years.\"\n\nHe's right. Mosqueda-Lewis and Vailotama are both sophomores, and another of their top players - Jordan Adams - is only a freshman. Once they get some more playing experience under their belts this summer and next year, it will be lights out for other teams.\n\nBoth Brea and Mater Dei have great team composure. There were times on both ends where referees made calls players disagreed with, and several kids had their mouths open to say something, or their faces scrunched up into anger, but then they put themselves in check. I respect that; they've had good coaching.\n\nFormer secretary waxed on about Brea Coach Jeff Sink - not on the court but in the classroom. She said he is a heckuva history teacher, and doesn't hesitate to break something or rip something up to make a point. This doesn't surprise me.\n\n\"And the kids learn!\" she said.\n\nShe and I were walking down the stairs when Sink came, and hugged her right next to me. I thought about saying something, since he'd posted on this blog, but.....naw. It was his moment.\n\nOn to Arco Arena Friday for the Wildcats.\n\nPac-10 tourney: it's a Cali thing, baby\n\nFor the first time in Pac-10 Tournament history, today's semi-finals will feature all California teams. USC and California will square off at 6 p.m., and Stanford and UCLA take each other on at 8:30 p.m.\n\nI was at work yesterday morning but was following online (and with the help of friend Daniel in the last minute) when USC hung on to upset #16 Arizona State, 70-65. Trojan point guard Camille LeNoir lead the charge with 18 points, and Heather Oliver added 17 - including five three-point shots. Danielle Orsillo lead the Sun Devils with 17 points.\n\nI was on hand for the Arizona-Stanford game at 5 p.m., and Arizona is not as the 77-46 final score would indicate. It's not that Arizona is that bad - it's that Stanford is that good. The Cardinal is so loaded that one of their reserves - Lindy La Rocque - went off for four three-point shots. Three other reserves played key minutes as well.\n\nThe thing I really appreciated about Arizona was how scrappy they played, and how they kept fighting all the way until the final buzzer. There was never a moment where their heads hung and one got the sense they'd given up. I addressed that in the post-game press conference by asking Ify Ibekwe and Courtney Clements what improvements they'd noted from beginning to end of the season.\n\nIbekwe said they'd grown and matured, that they think more, and now they fight back and they didn't used to. Clements said the team had needed to find players who would step up to be leaders, and now they have several.\n\nI liked hearing both of those things. The Wildcat program was never the same since the death of Shawntinice Polk in September, 2005.\n\nAnother thing I really like is Coach Niya Butts. She has a serious demeanor, but at the same time is very warm. When she had a short coughing spell during the press conference (she said she's been a little ill), Ibekwe rubbed her on the back. It's obvious the players like their coach, and I can see why from talking to her a few times. She's the perfect answer in the Arizona program.\n\nDoreena Campbell, Christina Nzekwe, Rebekah Gardner.\n\nDoreena Campbell plays D.\n\nDoreena Campbell walks down court while a free throw shot is being set up.\n\nThe biggest flopper in the Pac-10, point guard Mercedes Fox-Griffin.\n\nThe UCLA-OSU game was exciting, as expected. UCLA finally got the monkey off their back (lost to them a few weeks ago) by putting them away, 62-56. Mad props to Brittney Davis, who scored 22 points for the Beavers - 15 in the first half. She was playing big.\n\nI was amazed at UCLA freshman Antonye Nyingifa, who put up a team-high 18 points. She has been a monster the last few weeks, and I asked her and Doreena Campbell at the post-game press conference what has been going on.\n\n\"As a team, we have come together and begun to work together as a team,\" Campbell said.\n\nNyingifa said she'd had a slow start as a freshman, but that she was constantly trying to \"build in daily improvement, like coach says.\"\n\nI have really become a Campbell fan this year, and it's not just because of her fearless play and work ethic on the court: it's because she's also a bit of a nerd. It seemed like it on her player interview that they'd run at timeouts at Pauley Pavilion. Then I learned from a reliable source that Campbell has been known to hit the library after games, and I was in platonic player love. How could I not adore a young woman who can break ankles both on the court and in the classroom? (She also yells when she's running the point, as she was last night).\n\nOSU is much, much improved, and Coach LaVonda Wagner said this year's 19-11 record is the best the program has had in a long time. The only fault I'd find with the Beavers is point guard Mercedes Fox-Griffin, who likes to flop. She was flopping all over the place at Pauley back in January, and tried it a couple times last night. The first time was the most blatant, and the refs weren't buying it at all (nor did they the second time). Still, it's irritating. It reminds me of the Sparks circa 2002, when they played dirty, dirty ball.\n\nThe winners of tonight's semi-finals will go on to play in the championship game Sunday at 6 p.m.\n\nCandace makes cover of ESPN\n\nOOO, interesting:\n\nParker has always been unflappable, an ocean of calm, the by-product of clear intention and unprecedented success. \"I remember when we played at DePaul,\" says legendary Lady Vols head coach Pat Summitt. \"Candace was maybe 12, and she came up to me to get a picture. I remember looking up at her and thinking, Wow! When she walked away, I said, 'Who is that?' She was mature beyond her years.\"\n\nOh, great! Just tell her she can't, and that's the best thing for the Sparks:\n\nThe important thing, everyone agrees, is to get the basketball player back on the court. \"No C-section, that's the biggest thing,\" Parker says. \"I'm stubborn. I've been through knee, ankle, shoulder injuries. I feed off of doubt, people telling me I won't be able to come back. We'll see about that.\" She says she's training hard, prepping to play as soon as July, two months after her due date. The dedication pleases Team Parker very much.\n\nAh, I knew it:\n\nParker does demand a lot from herself. She insists on making her own way. \"I just want to be who I am,\" she says. And who is that? Parker carefully considers her answer. \"I'm very sensitive,\" she ventures shyly. \"Not many people know that. I don't like to show my emotions. I may go behind the door and cry, but I'm not going to cry in front of anybody.\"\n\n.....which goes along with the last sentences of the first paragraph.....I never could understand why some people on rebkell have called her arrogant:\n\nShe's nice, too. Sweet, even. Kind to animals and children, she is the sort of woman who worries about others more than about herself, a saint in high-tops.\n\nLink: http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3967891\n\nPondering City ball vs. suburbs/Orange County ball\n\nSaturday night I ended up sitting with a fellow teacher at the Brea-Edison game. He is a former coach himself, and coached a few of the Edison girls in their earlier years. We ended up talking about how basketball playing styles differ between the City Section schools and schools further out, in Orange County and beyond.\n\nTeacher man sees a different game - namely, that city schools play a more athletic brand of hoop. He sees suburban school female players afraid to take the jump shot, hesitant to take contact. City schools, he maintains, just bang more, while suburban school teams have more rules. I told him about how Brea Coach Jeff Sink uses the \"five pass before the shot\" rule with his squad, and teacher man nodded and said, \"yeah, that kinda stuff.\"\n\nIn general, I tend to agree with teacher man. City schools usually have more bounce, and if a player is good, you know her style if you go to enough games. For example, Chatsworth's Gennifer Brandon has a huge cache of tricks under the basket to get the ball into it. Kejuana Gardner of Washington Prep grabs rebounds mid-air, in crazy body positions. On the other hand, Brea has 18 players, but I'd be hard-pressed to tell you anything special I've noticed about any of them (and no, I'm not picking on Brea or saying anything bad about Sink - they're just an example).\n\nThere are two exceptions that I have seen this season to the Orange County/suburban rule: Mater Dei and Cajon. Mater Dei is an extremely athletic team, and two of their top players - Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis and Alexyz Vailotama - have distinct playing styles. So does Layshia Clarendon of Cajon, which is also an athletic team.\n\nSo I'm opening the floor for discussion.\n\n1. Are city teams more athletic than suburban teams? Do they bang harder?\n\n2. Are suburban teams more structured?\n\n3. Which do you think is best, and why?\n\nJeniece Johnson overcomes staggering circumstances\n\nIf this doesn't inspire you, nothing will:\n\nAfter the academic year, Oliver drove Jeniece to summer school every day and she started taking classes seriously. She says she also quit smoking and drinking, and separated herself from the people who did. She said she told her friends, \"Don't get mad at me if I stop talking to y'all. I got to do what I got to do.\"\n\nJeniece's grade-point average during her repeat freshman year had been 0.26, in part because she had been placed in sophomore-level classes. In the 2006-07 academic year, with classes ranging from freshman to junior level, she earned a 2.33. When the season started, she made the team.\n\nFrom there, her improvement was \"dramatic,\" Oliver says.\n\n\"She went from not being able to make a layup to finishing with either hand. Jump hooks in the post. Running the floor. . . . She had good hands. And any coach will you tell you any post player with good hands can go a long way.\"\n\nAs Jeniece came off the bench to help H.D. Woodson win its second straight D.C. Interscholastic Athletic Association championship, her transformation extended beyond basketball.\n\n\"Before Jeniece had basketball, she was just . . . out there,\" said her godmother, Angie Green, with whom Jeniece lived during her sophomore year. \"I thought she was going to be lost. And once she got in the mode of basketball, basketball, everything changed. . . . It's basketball practice, homework, sleep and do it all over again.\"\n\nLink: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/07/AR2009030702116.html\n\nI interviewed Johnson and her teammates on the phone last fall for a piece I was doing on them. Johnson seems like she has it together now.\n\nThe Zen of losing........aw, screw it\n\nThere were some surprising losses yesterday, to be sure. But none surprised me more than Umpqua Community College's loss to Skagit Valley last night in the semifinals of the Northwest Athletic Association of Community Colleges championship. The number-one ranked Riverhawks were picked by many, including me, to take it all this year. They certainly had the record to prove it, as well as the top-scoring players.\n\nBut last night Skagit Valley began the game on a 20-2 run, and Umpqua fought hard but was never able to recover from that. The final score was 82-72.\n\nWhen I got the text I was just leaving the Brea-Edison game, and I gasped loudly enough for people to turn around. It's funny how even when you're way past old enough to expect the unexpected, that sometimes you're still surprised by the unexpected.\n\nBut I have to give it up to Umpqua because they set aside their extreme disappointment today, and at 3:37 p.m. they won their game against Clackamas, 81-68. The victory gives them the third-place trophy.\n\nThis is one of the keys to success in the game of basketball, is rebounding from heartbreaking losses. We've all seen our favorite team go on a losing skid after a key loss. When a team is able to get over a painful defeat quickly, they will be more successful in not only basketball, but life. It's a sign of maturity. So I give Umpqua props. Third place isn't first, but it isn't sixth place, either, which is what they would have got today if they had lost.\n\nGreat season, ladies.\n\nLane and Skagit Valley play at 4:30 p.m. for the NWAACC crown.\n\nAbout 1500 miles away last night, Texas high school sensation Brittney Griner and her team lost the 5A state championship to Mansfield Summit. Pictures 5 and 6 on this link tell the story:\n\nhttp://www.statesman.com/news/mediahub/media/slideshow/index.jsp?tId=148641\n\nHighlights, plus brief interview with Griner: http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid823425601?bclid=894333136&bctid=14397003001\n\nCongrats to Mansfield Summit.\n\nAnd earlier yesterday, in the SEC Tournament, Tennessee got blown out by Auburn in the semifinals.\n\nAlso yesterday, UCLA fell to Oregon State, 61-58. It's been a horrible basketball weekend by my standards. In general, it's not been the best of seasons overall.\n\nLast week, my high school team didn't make it to the City finals.\n\nHave you had one of those years when all your favorite teams didn't quite get there?\n\nArgh.\n\nSouthern Section championships, March 7\n\nColony (white uniforms) and Canyon Springs during play.\n\nColony 76, Canyon Springs 59\n\nI came in at the half, and Colony was up 35-34. But it didn't take them long to begin breaking away. By the 5:27 mark in the third, they had pulled ahead 41-35, and they never looked back.\n\nCanyon's defense kept them within at least 10 until about five minutes to play, when Colony stepped on the gas. The main reasons why were senior forward Jazmyne White and senior forward/center Camille Buckley. The two made a nice tandem, switching off between outletter and scorer. White finished with 12 points and Buckley, 30. Junior guard Te'onna Campbell added 17.\n\nBrea Olinda 62, Edison 40\n\nEdison deserves kudos for playing with so much heart and intensity. In a smaller pond, they'd be a dominating basketball team. But in the end, they were no match for Brea, who has waves and waves of skilled players.\n\nBrea's Jonae Ervin is such a hustler. She finished with 12 points, and I'd love to see the rest of the stats. She was everywhere. Junior guard Kelsey Harris started going off in the fourth quarter. I counted four threes.....again, I'm looking forward to when the stats are put up on maxpreps. Sophomore Justine Hartman added 10.\n\nSenior point guard Jonae Ervin lets another one fly, for the bucket. She finished with 12 points.\n\nCoach Jeff Sink stands in front of Brea's long, long bench.\n\nEdison's short bench.\n\nAfter sending in his second complete set of reserves, Coach Jeff Sink chills in the last few moments of the game.\n\nThe game was a blowout, so normally-intense Brea Coach Jeff Sink didn't need to yell so much. There was no Diet Coke on the scorer's table for him, no frantic gesturing; just a few yells and a couple intense timeouts. Heck, his wife could have even come to this game.\n\nI like the \"crazy\" Sink better.\n\nI was sitting next to a teacher who knows three of the Edison players. He answered my question from last time I was at Mater Dei - he said he was told the cameras in the ceiling are used by coaches to diagram their shots. If that's true, wow. To have those kinds of resources at your disposal........\n\nThe cameras in the ceiling at Mater Dei. I feel better knowing they're probably for shot diagramming than some freaky Big Brother security thing.\n\nBut wait a minute......if the ceiling cameras are for shot diagramming, what are these cameras for?\n\nI don't know if the security at this game was from Mater Dei, or from the CIF, but they acted like asses. To cap it off, after the game was over, they were trying to herd people out of the gym. The woman in charge of the section I was sitting in was being unecessarily rude about it, using sarcastic and mocking comments to attempt to get people to move (As a high school teacher I can tell you, this is not the way to get people to start walking).\n\nIn my younger years I would have said something to her, but last night I just gave her my most withering teacher look. She did a double-take and then looked away before looking at me again. Then she shut up. I swear to god.\n\n(Future) celebrity sightings: Mater Dei super sophomore guard Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis.\n\nOn an unrelated note, here is a great video of Friday's Cajon-Poly game, courtesy of a reader:\n\nhttp://www.pe.com/video/sports-index.html?nvid=339454\n\nEyewitness account: Cajon def. Poly\n\nMy secret homey from the OC was at the game last night, and had this recap:\n\nThe line score was\n\nCajon 16 - 14 - 9 - 13 =52\n\nLBP 11 - 8 - 8 - 17 = 44\n\nClarendon had 28 points.\n\nBurnside had a lot of blocks and was able to out-rebound most of the Poly players all night.\n\nClarendon did have a couple of flops, but nothing like the MD game. She also took her time at the foul line late in the game, so that the Poly fans started a 1-10 count to make the refs call a delay on her.\n\nI thought the refs could have called a lot more blocks on Poly when they were guarding Clarendon but they let the flow of the game go on if the bump wasnt affecting the flow of the game.\n\nPoly had no real outside shooting game last night and that had to be due to the loss of Kelli Thompson/UNLV. She is coming back from a wrist injury and tried some shots, including an air ball that was way off target.\n\nStrange site and something I thought might be ilegal was that (former Jackrabbit) Jasmine Dixon (Rutgers-next year UCLA) was allowed to sit on the end of the Poly bench.\n\nBoth teams brought a big group of fans.\n\nI have seen Clarendon play and win two SS CIF championships in two straight years. She has done this with Burnside and then three other girls that are nowhere near as talented as their teammates nor much of the championship competition they have faced. I dont know if K. Lewis of Mater Dei or Christiana Marinacci of Foothill could do the same job as Clarendon has done. To me she is the player of the year for the Southern Section.\n\nThanks, IM. Not sure if Mosqueda-Lewis could do the same job for MD right now, but she's a sophomore. By the time she's a senior, she'll be all Clarendon is now and then some.\n\nGame story link: http://www.presstelegram.com/preps/ci_11858149\n\nCity Section Championship: Chatsworth 60, Taft 49\n\nOn the strength of a fourth-quarter surge, the Chatsworth Chancellors beat league rivals Taft to win the City Section Championship last night, 60-49. After evenly trading baskets for three quarters, Chatsworth broke away in the fourth, lead by All-American Gennifer Brandon and junior guard Monica Jackson.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 Brandon not only made big plays under the hoop all night, but she dribbled the ball the full length of the court twice - once taking it to the rack herself and the second time, outletting to a teammate for the bucket. It was remniscent of the multi-skilled Candace Parker, who is 6-foot-4. Brandon, headed to Cal next year, finished with 22 points, 15 rebounds, two blocks and a steal.\n\nJackson, with 15 points and five rebounds, seemed to be in the right places at the right times, all the time. But it was her sometimes-dazzling moves that seemed to impress the crowd most. In the fourth quarter, she stole the ball and then spun around under the hoop, away from her defender, for the layup. Chatsworth fans were on their feet, and it was that bucket that put the Chancellors up 44-39 at the 5:34 mark, and began their run. Brandon, who had scored only six of her points in the first half, put in more than that in the fourth quarter; she seemed hungry for the win.\n\nTaft, fighting valiantly behind their crew of good shooters, suddenly began to miss shots in the last period. Junior guard Rmanii Haynes lead her team with 10 points and 10 assists.\n\nFirst quarter, 17-14 Taft\n\nSecond quarter, 26 all\n\nThird quarter, 37-36 Chatsworth\n\nFinal, 60-49\n\nChatsworth won the title this year after losing in last year's finals to Narbonne High School. Chancellors coach Michelle Chevalier had also lost to Narbonne in the same game in 2003, when she coached for Sylmar. And ironically, it was a game against Narbonne this season that kicked Chatsworth out of a slump, igniting them to a 17-4 season finish:\n\nNine games into the season, the Chancellors were just 5-4, riding a three-game losing streak at the Nike Tournament of Champions in Phoenix. Not exactly a running start.\n\nIt would only take one game to get back on a roll though, and in a weird twist of fate, that opponent was Narbonne, the team that had ruined Chatsworth's season twice a year before.\n\nOn Dec. 22, the Chancellors defeated the Gauchos 49-34 - since then, they've gone 17-4.\n\nLink: http://www.dailynews.com/preps/ci_11849042\n\nGood pics of both teams on this link: http://www.dailynews.com/preps/ci_11858243\n\nOn the other side of the Los Angeles metro area.................\n\nCajon did indeed beat Poly last night. Strangely, OCvarsity.com has no story on arguably the biggest game and upset of the Southern Section tournament so far. I am dying to know how it went down, who scored what and what went wrong for Poly. Tidbits on socalhoops indicate that both Darshae Burnside and Layshia Clarendon of Cajon were in foul trouble in the second half, but kept Poly down 8-10 points when one or the other was on the bench. OCvarsity.com better get off their cans and post a story about this upset of the defending state champions by basically two players.\n\nDown the road at the Mater Dei-Beverly Hills game, MD sophomore forward Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis scored 41 points in her team's 81-42 route. This isn't the first time Mosqueda-Lewis has come close to outscoring an opponent on her own. It's ridiculous.\n\nIs there anyone to stop Mater Dei this year? I think not. This piece says MD is ranked third in the nation. If they're third, who could be first and second? I'd like to see those teams.\n\nLink: http://www.ocvarsity.com/articles/dei-mater-first-2327773-player-points\n\nTonight's games at Mater Dei High School:\n\nColony vs. Canyon Springs, 6:30\n\nBrea Olinda vs. Edison, 8:15"
