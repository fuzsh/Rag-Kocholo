        "text": "Happy Thanksgiving Bakersfield\n\nI’m thankful that Bakersfield College is a place of transformation, excellence, achievement, hope, dreams, diversity, acceptance, and student support. I’m thankful that our campus is one without boundaries, where we reach out to serve students in our surrounding communities, bringing college closer to home so they, too, can obtain a college education.\n\nI’m thankful for the countless stories of how our work is changing lives. Each and every day, I am amazed by the leadership and engagement of BC’s faculty and staff, especially in the way they serve our students providing seamless transitions and guided paths with pillars of light, support and hope.\n\nIn this season of thanksgiving, I spent a few moments reviewing weekly posts on my blog and through seeing the photos of students, graduates, alumni, supporters, faculty, and staff, I am blessed to share that I truly am the happiest and luckiest college president ever. There really is so much to be thankful for.\n\nRemember the Renegade Pantry for the Holidays\n\nThe holidays are a time to set aside differences and focus on love of family and community, coming together in fellowship to celebrate each other’s accomplishments and mourn our losses over the year. As the temperatures drop with the change of seasons, we become more sympathetic to those less fortunate than us who are suffering in the cold without food,housing or proper clothing.\n\nAt BC, we believe that none of our students should come to class or go home hungry, which is why we established the Renegade Pantry to alleviate food insecurity, hunger and poverty among our students, which in turn makes them more prepared to commit to their education.\n\nThis holiday season, we ask that you consider supporting the Renegade Pantry by donating nonperishable food, clothing and hygiene items. For more information about how to make a donation or financial contribution, visit the Donate page on the Office of Student Life website. Also the Culinary Arts Renegade Room is hosting a promotion in support of the Renegade Pantry – bring in two canned or dry goods items to the Renegade Room, and you’ll receive a soft drink of your choice free of charge. They also accept new or gently used coats, scarves, hats and blankets.\n\nI’d like to thank the Office of Student Life for operating the Renegade Pantry and all those who have donated to keep it going.\n\nPhillips 66 Tours Industrial Automation Lab\n\nOn Tuesday, a team of 5 representatives from Phillips 66 were on campus to tour BC’s CIM and robotics labs. Dean of Instruction Michele Bresso shared that they asked incredible questions and one of them even made a comment that the equipment in our labs “is exact what is used in industry right now.”\n\nDean Bresso went on to share that at least two dozen students in Engineering and IT met with them for lunch and learned more about career opportunities within the field. Industry and community partnerships like this are one of the many enriching experiences for students at the home of the Renegades. Friends, it’s stories like these that prompt me to ask…\n\nHave I told you lately that I’m the luckiest and happiest college president ever? 🙂\n\nHelping Youth Develop A College Going Attitude\n\nMarisa Marquez presented valuable college application information to the Latina Leaders of Kern County Youth Leadership Program on Saturday, November 17. She spent three hours sharing tips on the college application process, financial aid, goal setting, and why developing a college going attitude is so important. Bakersfield College has been a longtime supporter of Latina Leaders of Kern County and their efforts in youth leadership development. LLKC launched its twenty-first annual Youth Leadership Program with this session. Kudos to Marisa and all of our BC faculty and staff who go above and beyond and volunteer for the many great organizations in our community.\n\nBC’s Counseling Department\n\nWith Thanksgiving now in our rear view mirror, the end of Fall and start of the Spring 2018 semester is right around the corner. I can bet that students are registering for their classes at this very moment. In light of this, I thought it was important to highlight the superheroes in our Counseling and Advising Department who assist students every day. The counseling office inside the Center for Student Success is always bustling with activities, workshops, appointments and walk-ins, and our Counseling and Advising staff handles it all with grace, conducting back-to-back appointments practically every day to serve our students and get them into the classes that they need.\n\nCounselors and educational advisors are integral to our vision for implementing guided pathways at BC, and many of them serve as completion coaches for our ten Learning and Career Pathways, as well as our affinity groups for African-Americans, Latinos, and veterans. These coaches work with diligence and care to ensure that each student in their completion coaching communities is on track to graduate with a degree that will transform their lives and the lives of their families.\n\nThe Counseling and Advising Department is also working to bring its services out into the rural communities in Kern County, offering appointments at the Delano Campus, as well as select appointment dates throughout the year in Shafter and Wasco to bring BC closer to home.\n\nNothing we do here at BC would be possible without our counselors and advisors working with students to get them registered in classes that properly align with their educational and career goals, so I’d like to just say thank you for all you do and keep up the good work!\n\nTransgender Day of Remembrance\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bakersfield College community gathered in Levinson Hall to honor the lives of 23 transgender people who were murdered in 2018 as part of the 19th annual Transgender Day of Remembrance.\n\nBC’s Sexuality and Gender Awareness club (SAGA) organized the campus’ commemoration of the Transgender Day of Remembrance, which began in 1999 by transgender woman Gwendolyn Ann Smith to memorialize the murder of her friend Rita Hester in Allston, Massachusetts. Since its inception, Transgender Day of Remembrance has grown into an international day of action, with candlelight vigils, marches and art shows organized around the world on November 20 every year.\n\nClub adviser and communication professor Helen Acosta spoke about the ways that people can be proper allies and advocates for the trans community.\n\n“You don’t have to understand what it’s like to be transgender,” Acosta said. “Accept them for who they are and love them for who they are.” “My life has been deeply enriched by the trans friends and students,” she added.\n\nCongratulations to Jen Garrett\n\nBC’s Choral Director, Jennifer Garrett has been invited to be one of the guest conductors for the 2019 Central Region Honor Choir. Each year the high school directors from the central region vote on next year’s honor choir conductors and so it’s quite an honor that our very own Jen Garrett will conduct.\n\nThe scheduled event is quite a ways away, not taking place until November of next year but stay tuned to my blog for more information when it becomes available.\n\nTBC Highlights Jeannie Parent\n\nBC’s Jeannie Parent was recently spotlighted in an article by The Bakersfield Californian’s Sam Morgen. The article titled “Local advocacy group extends welcoming hand into Mesa Verde detention facility” shares more about the group Kern Welcoming and Extending Solidarity to Immigrants, which was formed in 2015.\n\nFun Photos: College Council\n\nCollege Council met on Friday, November 16th to address college-wide issues through a collaborative approach. Of the topics presented, I was really impressed with the Industrial and Transportation Meta-major Pathways Report given by Katie Makaiwi and the State of the College by Dan Hall.\n\nFun Photos: Child Development Center\n\nSue Vaughn shared some fun photos from BC’s Child Development Center. She said, “the staff in the Child Development Center decided that they wanted to have special shirts to identify themselves so they designed these.”\n\nFun Photos: Renegades are Everywhere\n\nBC’s Dean of Instruction, Corny Rodriguez texted me that he spotted the Renegade Athletics mascot on the back of this local Pepsi truck while leaving the BC SW campus.\n\nWhere have you spotted the Renegades around town?\n\nRenegades of the Week\n\nRenegade Athletics is proud to announce this week’s Wells Fargo Renegades of the Week:\n\nGabby Lugo, Women’s Cross Country – Placed 10th at the CCCAA State Cross Country Championships and was named All-American in her final race as a Renegade.\n\nJosh Medina, Football – Honored as the 2018 Patriotic Bowl Player of the Game.

I loved cheering on the Renegade Volleyball Players beside Trustee Romeo Agbalog, Sandi Taylor, Michele Bresso, and Darrell Ballard. It’s extra special when families bring young ones to the games. Will I see you at a Renegade game?\n\nThat’s all for now.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nWith much Renegade Pride and Collegiality.\n\nsonya —\n\nGood morning Bakersfield.\n\nIt is Saturday, November 17, 2018…..A great day to be a Renegade\n\nWildfires Affecting Many California Community Colleges\n\nMany of our sister schools in the California Community College system have been gravely affected by the wildfires that raged across the state last weekend, bravely fighting to support the most vulnerable members of their communities while dealing with the loss of their homes and loved ones.\n\nMore than 70 people have died and 1000 are missing after the devastation of the Camp Fire in the North Valley, which completely destroyed the area around Paradise, California, a town of 26,000 people in the mountains above Chico in Butte County.\n\nButte College was surrounded on three sides by the blaze, but the campus was thankfully saved due to the valiant efforts of local firefighters. In a Student FAQ page on the Butte College web site, the campus announced that Butte College and all centers will remain closed until a tentative date of November 26, while some support services began this Thursday at the Butte College Chico Center, including mental health counseling, educational advising, referrals to local support services, and a food pantry for all those affected by the fire. The college has also established two GoFundMe accounts to support individuals affected by the fire: the Butte College Student Fire Relief Fund and the Butte College Faculty/Staff Fire Relief Fund.\n\nThe Butte College main campus continues to be used as a staging area for emergency service personnel, and “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” host Guy Fieri visited the area on Sunday to hand out food to relief workers, according to SF Gate.\n\nWhile the Woolsey fire continues to burn along the California coast, with only 57 percent containment as of Thursday, November 15, a new blaze referred to as the Sierra Fire has started in the town of Fontana, just 50 miles east of Los Angeles, according to NBC News. Los Angeles Pierce College in Woodland Hills is being used as an evacuation area for the Southern California wildfires, as people and their pets who were displaced by the Woolsey and Hill fires have found refuge in the Pierce College gyms. The college also opened its pens and stables to house over 300 horses, donkeys, sheep and chickens, according to USA Today.\n\nOn Tuesday, California Community College Chancellor Eloy Oakley released a message across the state linking to the California Wildfire Relief Fund put together by the Foundation for California Community Colleges. All of the proceeds from the fund will go to directly support community college students and staff affected by the fires. The Santa Monica College Foundation is also partnering with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District to raise money in the Malibu Fire Relief Fund.\n\nHere at Bakersfield College, our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by these fires, and we hope that our partners in community college education can recover from this devastation as soon as possible.\n\nI also want to take this opportunity to thank all of the first responders and firefighters around our state and those who have traveled, especially to California from other states, to assist. Earlier this year, we had a close call with a fire near campus, and you can read about it in my blog piece titled “Thank you firefighters and first responders.”\n\n100 Years Since The End of World War I\n\nSunday was the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice that ended World War I, and throughout the world, leaders and communities solemnly honored the courageous people who died in the war. I came across a YouTube video which I found moving and poignant.\n\nThe description of the video reads: “In fall 2015, Legion Magazine and Leonard Cohen released a video to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the poem ‘In Flanders Fields’ by Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. In a poignant tribute to McCrae, Canadian songwriter, painter, and poet Leonard Cohen has recited that stirring poem for this exclusive video. His voice is accompanied by stirring imagery from the First World War.”\n\nBC is About Student Success\n\nBakersfield College received the 2018 state Chancellor’s Student Success Award on Friday in recognition of the college’s intensive focus on strengthening curricular alignment throughout the k-16 educational pipeline. The state Chancellor’s Office describes the annual award as one which “honors college and/or district programs that demonstrate a commitment and significant progress toward achieving success and equity goals for all students.”\n\nIn a recent study of 98 of the 100 largest metro regions in the country, researchers at the non-profit Measure of America found that Kern County has the highest rate of disengaged youth in the country. With 21.2% of those aged 16-24 neither in school nor working, over 26,000 young people in Kern County are completely disengaged. By developing various student success initiatives, BC has united programs and resources to improve outcomes and support the Chancellor’s Vision for Success.\n\nIn 2016, BC developed a county-wide college promise, The Kern Promise, which focused on Associate Degree for Transfer Pathways. To advance the work specifically relating to issues of transfer misalignment, BC established a transfer task force for faculty from both BC and CSU Bakersfield to jointly clarify the pathways so students can progress through the college system, locally, unabridged, and efficiently.\n\nBakersfield College has recognized the value of momentum points which include:\n\nAttempting 15+ units in the first term\n\nCompletion of transfer-level math and English in the first year\n\nAttempting 30+ units in the first year\n\nCompletion of 9 core pathway units in the first year\n\nThese momentum points, along with high-tech, high-touch innovations such as the Program Pathways Mapper, Completion Coaching Communities, and with the Finish in 4 initiative, students are gaining the clarity to efficiently complete their degree or certificate. Special thanks to the WARBA group including Matthew Garrett, Janet Fulks, Eleonora Hicks, Marisa Marquez, and Khushnur Dadabhoy and BC’s Leading from the Middle team including Craig Hayward, Billie Jo Rice, Jennifer Johnson, Mark Osea, Brynn Schook, and Jonathan Schultz.\n\nStudent Success is on The Right Path\n\nStudent Success in Bakersfield was highlighted last weekend by Joseph Luiz in the Bakersfield Californian in his piece titled “Bakersfield College, Cal State Bakersfield see major increases in graduates.” In the article, Joseph cites BC’s Vice President of Instruction Liz Rozell highlighting\n\nthe college’s Guided Pathways model as one major reason we’ve seen such a significant increase. The article explains, “The goal of Guided Pathways is to graduate students more quickly by making the path to graduation more clear to students with a detailed plan and more counseling and other support services.” Read the full article at Bakersfield.com.\n\nSpeaking of student success, this week, a BC alum emailed his BC professors to share how being a Renegade has changed:\n\n“I would like to thank the both of you, and the entire electronics/industrial automation department at BC. I just accepted a position as a broadcast engineer at our sister station in San Diego KGTV. This is a very big leap for my career as San Diego is in the top 30 markets of the US. For reference, Bakersfield is 122 in market size.\n\nThe success I’ve had so far in my career is directly related to the classes that I took in the electronics program at BC. Beyond learning electronics, PLCs, telecom and radio, I learned valuable life skills that I’ll carry the rest of my life. Once I start at KGTV my hourly rate will increase to $34.10 an hour, or $70,928 per year. Your guys program is changing lives, I know it changed mine.”\n\nTeaching 411\n\nA BC team presented at the Teaching 411: Everything You Need to Know to Support and Prepare Future Teachers conference at College of the Canyons on November 9. The conference brought together experts from across California to provide insights and information to those who create the pipelines and pathways for students pursuing careers in education from preschool through college level.\n\nDr. Kimberly Bligh, Isabel Castaneda, and Jessica Wojtysiak presented a workshop called “Guided Pathways and Teacher Preparation” with a focus on how Bakersfield College has embraced and institutionalized the Guided Pathways approach to education. The Education Pathway Completion team is laser-focused on finding ways to identify our community’s future teachers and ensure they can enter their pathway as early as possible, stay on their pathway, and ensure they have the courses, skills, and knowledge they need to obtain their degrees, transfer to a 4-yr institution, and complete the requirements they need to realize their career goals. It’s a good time to be a future teacher at BC!\n\nL.E.T.S. TEACH\n\nThe Education Pathway team hosted a conference at the Bakersfield College Southwest campus for more than 120 high school students from 9 campuses who are on the pathway to become teachers. Fernando Lara and his team graciously supported the L.E.T.S. Teach BC education team of Dr. Kimberly Bligh, Isabel Castaneda, Christina Maldonado, Teresa McAllister, and numerous student volunteers and peer mentors as they took over the BC Southwest facilities for the day. The conference was funded through the Education Futures project, which is a grant through the California Community College Chancellor’s Office.\n\nThe conference offered 16 breakouts and included motivational workshops with a resource fair option with 15 vendors from multiple four-year institutions and community partners. Topics included:\n\n“Teaching from the Heart,” a presentation by Standard Middle School with LaStevia Dixon and Adan Garcia\n\n“How to Shine in a Teaching Interview,” with former Superintendent Dr. Domene from Hope International\n\nAnd a very cool hands-on Child Development activity facilitated by our very own Child Development faculty Amanda Tumblin!\n\nThe afternoon offered a great panel discussion with BC faculty Bill Chapman, Cato Middle School and BC Adjunct Faculty Amanda Gonzalez, and Samantha Hayes-Delaney, a BC Education Student and Classroom Aide at North Beard Elementary.\n\nThe BC L.E.T.S. Teach team will be hosting another conference in the spring for BC students in the Education Pathways. BC supports future teachers! #WeAreBC!\n\nBC’s Spanish Club Visits LA\n\nBC’s Spanish club organized a cultural trip to Los Angeles where they visited the Plaza Olvera, the Museum La Plaza de Cultura y Arte, a Mexican restaurant, the Chinese American Museum, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels, and finished dining at a Japanese restaurant.\n\nArt, Architecture, and Archetypes – What’s a Museum?\n\nNan Gomez-Heitzeberg (our newly elected KCCD Trustee!), David Koeth, Rae Ann Kumelos, Duane Anderson, and Susan Pinza hosted an interdisciplinary panel discussion this past Thursday. The discussion was titled “From the Lourve to the Museum of Ice Cream: What’s a Museum?” and is a series focused on the significance of art, aesthetics, and humanities on communities.\n\nDavid Koeth showed a slide saying there are approximately 850 million visits to American museums annually, which is more than the attendance for all major league sporting events and theme parks combined (483 million in 2011). Museums support more than 726,000 American jobs and contribute $50 billion to the U.S. economy. This information was mind-blowing! I want to thank all of our participants, and Levan Center Director Reggie Williams who makes these events possible.\n\nThese discussions are free and open to the public, so make sure to keep your eyes open for future dates and topics!\n\nCongratulations to Juan Pablo Buenrostro\n\nMusic Faculty Kris Tiner shared with me recently that one of his students, trumpet player and BC Music Major Juan Pablo Buenrostro, was selected to be a member of the prestigious Bakersfield Youth Symphony Orchestra. I’m also told this is a special year for the orchestra as they’ve been invited to perform in our sister city of Wakayama, Japan. Through his online fundraiser, Juan says, “Being able to participate in this international tour would be an enormous musical and educational opportunity for me.”\n\nThe sister city relationship between Bakersfield and Wakayama officially began on August 21, 1961, when the Bakersfield City Council adopted a resolution establishing an ongoing friendship with the city of Wakayama, Japan. This action was shortly followed by Bakersfield Mayor Gene Winer appointing a People-to-People Steering Committee to oversee the Bakersfield-Wakayama Sister City relationship. Later, the Bakersfield Sister City Project Corporation was created. Soon, Bakersfield officials and citizens were traveling to our new sister city, where they were overwhelmed by the friendly reception. In return, delegations from Wakayama began to visit Bakersfield, forming lasting friendships that continue to the present day. Over the years, every Mayor of Bakersfield since 1964 has visited Wakayama, while every Mayor of Wakayama has visited Bakersfield.\n\nBlessed are the Huggers’ by Jack Hernandez\n\nLast weekend, it was a joy to see Jack’s most recent Community Voices piece, “Blessed are the huggers” in The Bakersfield Californian. With words of wisdom, such as “Hugging somehow blends us in a way that words don’t,” and “I believe, though, that even if we don’t hug others, we should hug ourselves,” Jack shares the importance of closeness, caring for others, and caring for ourselves. If you missed it in print, check it out on Bakersfield.com.\n\nGadfly Cafe – Suicide: In Pain, Protest, and Honor\n\nThe fall semester’s third and final Gadfly Cafe took place on Wednesday, November 14. Students gathered in the Norman Levan Center for the Humanities to discuss a very serious topic–Suicide: In Pain, Protest, and Honor. Philosophy Professor Reggie Williams did a fine job moderating the discussion of a delicate topic. Attendees shared stories of how suicide has affected their lives and how they have managed to cope with these sudden losses. It was a heartbreaking yet supportive atmosphere. Stay tuned for more Gadfly Cafe events coming next semester!\n\nTaking BC Adult Education Across Country\n\nFall leaves, beautiful weather, the Charles River and Adult Education, as Boston, Massachusetts was the site of the National College Transition Network (NCTN) 2018 Fall Conference. Program Manager Endee Grijalva had the opportunity to co-present with Bakersfield Adult School (BAS) Principal Mark Wyattand Administrator Jodi Loeffler on the partnership between BAS and BC–a partnership that has birthed an innovative and creative space for student success! This co-located one-stop for education and resources is the first of its kind and only the beginning, as the BC Adult Education team continues to take education to the people via Rural Initiatives.\n\nMech Ag Grand Opening\n\nThe Mechanized Agriculture Grand Opening took place on Wednesday, November 14, at Renegade Park, with opening remarks by Anthony Cordova, Career & Technical Education (CTE) Director, and Cornelio (Corny) Rodriguez, Dean of Instruction, welcoming everyone to the event. Mechanized Agriculture Professor Matt Riley spoke about how this program is developing a strong workforce for jobs in local industries, in particular oil and agriculture.\n\nMore than a dozen students were on stage to share how the program has changed their lives. Some told their stories of how they came into the program, including Raul Herrera, who gave a moving speech about how the program offered him hope for a new career. Heavy equipment was on display, showing visitors the exact type of machinery these students will be using on the job.\n\nCongratulations to all the students who will be completing this new degree program! You are BC! For more coverage of the Mech Ag Grand Opening, read the story on Bakersfield.com or check it out on BakersfieldNow.com.\n\nDeep Cuts and Conversations\n\nOften when we hear a song that we enjoy, we sing along or tap a foot without even thinking about the artist’s personal life. On Thursday evening, the Levan Center hosted another round of Deep Cuts & Conversations with Josh Ottum, Kris Tiner, and Reggie Williams. The theme for the evening was musicians who were not the most exemplary people.\n\nThe evening started off discussing Merle Haggard. Although a celebrated country artist, Merle spent much of his younger years on the wrong side of the law. In 1950, at the age of 13 he was already involved in theft and writing bad checks. He had a knack for escaping incarceration and was eventually sent to San Quentin. In 1972 however, then-California Governor Ronald Reagan granted Merle a full pardon.\n\nThe conversation then turned to John Lennon. Although some of his songs have been used as celebrated anthems for peace, he was reputedly a horrible father who abandoned his son Julian at 5 years old. The song Imagine was played over the PA and Prof. Reggie Williams described how the song parallels the Communist manifesto. Prof. Kris Tiner added that the song was actually banned from some radio stations after the 9/11 attacks due to its anti-materialist sentiment.\n\nThe evening continued with mentions of Sam Cooke, Don Henley, Spade Cooley, and Beethoven for questionable aspects of their lives. Stay tuned for the next edition of Deep Cuts and Conversations. Date to be announced soon!\n\nFun Photos from Midnight Madness\n\nThe Rural Initiatives team burned the midnight oil! Express enrollment this week was Midnight Madness. We had a great turnout. Students were able to complete all matriculation steps in one day. Big shout out to the team!\n\nFun Photos from Hot Rod Reunion Drag Race\n\nBC Renegades and Automotive Technology professor Vic Posey participated in the 2018 Hot Rod Drag Race. Check out the fun photos!\n\nInternational Education Week\n\nAll this past week, the Bakersfield College community celebrated the diversity of our international students with a series of events in observance of International Education Week. This year, approximately 60 students from 24 different countries to start their futures here at BC, said International Students counselor Shoreh Rahman.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, several international students gathered at the International Students office in the Center for Student Success to raise awareness of the program, which provides educational services and academic support for students coming from abroad. And on Tuesday night, faculty and staff met with international students in the Fireside Room to network and learn more about the countries the students come from.\n\nThis year, Rahman has sought to provide more opportunities and support for international students at BC by hiring several of them to work in her department. Transfer Pathways director Khushnur Dadabhoy, Testing and Placement Program Manager Kalina Hill, and EMLS instructor Elizabeth Rodacker are all advocates for international students at BC.\n\nThe event culminated on Wednesday afternoon with the Passport to the World event, where students hosted tables from each of their countries on the lawn between the Center for Student Success and the Library. I’d like to thank Shoreh Rahman and the International Students department for participating in the nationwide celebration of International Education Week and striving to make Bakersfield College’s influence spread worldwide.\n\nChicano/Latino Community Leader Breakfast\n\nThe Annual Chicano/Latino Breakfast was hosted in the Fireside Room on the Bakersfield College campus on Thursday morning, November 15. What a great group of community leaders that came out in support of Bakersfield College. Mayor Karen Goh was in attendance along with many corporate and community partners. It is always inspiring to see the support our college and students receive. The highlight of the meeting was rhe commitment from those present to be “Padrinos” for students who may fall through the cracks and need a little guidance and support. A Padrino will be someone our students can reach out to when they run into an obstacle or question about their education. The Padrino will provide information on resources and support avenues for the student to be successful. Another start to great opportunities to ensure student success!\n\nKern Energy Summit\n\nEach fall, industry leaders gather in Bakersfield to exchange information on the latest advances and innovation in the energy industry, specifically as it affects Kern County’s position as a U.S. energy leader. Kern EDC partners with other industry supporters every November to explore current challenges and opportunities facing the petroleum, utility, and renewable energy industries. The conference provides an opportunity to network with top industry experts and suppliers to learn about local innovations and technologies that are shaping the energy future of the state and nation. Bakersfield College was a proud sponsor of the event.\n\nThe agenda included a presentation by Lorelei Oviatt, Director, Kern County Planning and Natural Resources Department, a presentation on the Belridge Solar Project, a panel discussion on the future of energy in Kern County, and ended with a panel discussion on Gender and the Changing Face of the Energy Industry.

Led by Fernando Ortiz, the faculty Guided Pathways Coordinator, the team members represented their Guided pathways Design Teams: Entry, Program Mapping, Communication, Student Support and Advising.\n\nSanta Ana College is in the early implementation phase as one of 20 California Community Colleges participating in the statewide CA Guided Pathways Project, which follows the national AACC Guided Pathways project that BC participated in several years ago. BC was instrumental in bringing the project to California and is recognized as a partner in the CA Guided Pathways project. The Santa Ana College team met with BC’s Guided Pathways Implementation Team (GPIT) on Tuesday, and on Wednesday morning with teams from Outreach & School Relations, Summer Bridge, Academic Support Services, Starfish Implementation, the Program Pathways Mapper, the Data Analytics Team and more for advice and to learn strategies in implementing Guided Pathways at Santa Ana.\n\nThank you Lesley Bonds for coordinating Santa Ana College’s team visit and thank you to GPIT and all of the teams that took time out of their busy schedules to meet with our visitors. I am proud that we are leading the way in Guided Pathways and improving the college system for not only our students, but for students all over California by assisting other colleges in implementing Guided Pathways. This is one more reason why I am the happiest college president.

It is truly the first honest portrayal of the lives of contemporary gay life in 1968. Taking place in an apartment in New York’s posh Upper East Side, the dialogue exchanges and witty remarks concerns 9 gentlemen who gather for the birthday. The play intertwines the conception themes of love, fear, self-loathing, alcoholism, stereotypes, friendships, betrayal, trust, and most importantly, the unknown. Cleverly directed by BC Professor Kimberly Chin, she brings this production to life with nine amazing BC actors with a bit of class and drama.\n\nRenegade Report\n\nIf you missed watching the Renegade Report live this last Thursday at 11 a.m., check out the segments from this week’s show from the links below.

See the email below.\n\nDear Tamara, Thank you for your act of generosity yesterday morning in giving me the rare and elusive parking spot. I was delighted to see you last night at the Levan Center! Now I can thank you properly. Your kindness had a lovely ripple effect.\n\nI was running late, had heavy bags of essays to schlep to Humanities, forgot a sweater and was wearing heels, so the full parking lot on Haley made me so grumpy. As I raced to the back lot hoping to find a spot, I was also saddened that I would not be able to share the latest morning parking drama with my beloved colleague, David Beest. As you may know, David passed away suddenly on Oct. 18th. We miss him terribly in the English department. David and I had a M/W ritual before class of comparing the daily parking story, and he would have appreciated this one.\n\nMore importantly, he would have appreciated and laughed at my silly warrioress parking mentality versus your generosity of spirit. My students keep a kindness journal and we often start class with someone sharing a kind act shared with them. Thanks to your kindness, I shared the story of your parking gift (something the students all relate to…), and your actions uplifted not only me, but the entire class. Thank you for making a lovely difference in my day–one that touched the students as well. I will be sure to pass your generous gift forward next time a parking challenge occurs (and we know there will be a next time).\n\nThank you again – wishing you all joy – and an empty parking spot whenever you need one.\n\nTake care, Rae Ann\n\nStories like this show how even during the holiday season, something as simple as kindness in the parking lot goes a long way and spreads joy throughout our community.\n\nThat’s all for now.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nWith much Renegade Pride and Collegiality.\n\nsonya —\n\nthe luckiest and happiest college president ever\n\nGood morning Bakersfield.\n\nIt is Saturday, November 10, 2018…..A great day to be a Renegade\n\nIt has been 6 weeks since I went to my Saturday exercise class. So I really enjoyed being back at Body Pump and fell in love with this song that the instructor used for the lunge session.\n\nNow back to BC….. Paul Beckworth texted me this morning that it was a “fantastic week” at BC. All week long we have been celebrating our student veterans at BC with many events.\n\nBakersfield College Vernon Valenzuela Veteran Resource Center\n\nMonday morning began with the 2018 Veterans Community Leader Breakfast, celebrating those who diligently support our returning veterans and men and women in service. Local leaders ate a delicious breakfast at the Renegade Room prepared by our amazing culinary team. With an over 60% increase in student veterans at BC on campus, it is the leadership and engagement from these dedicated individuals who help us intentionally and meaningfully support our students and veterans to reach their goals. Thank you to everyone who came out including Mayor Goh, Chancellor Tom Burke, Assemblyman Vince Fong, Dick Taylor, Cole Karr (Representative for Kevin McCarthy), Perry Finzel (Representative for David Valadao), Josh Dhanens, and Scott Spielman.\n\nA special thanks to Christian Flores-Castaneda, Alex Gomez, Suzanne Tangeman for all of your hard work on the breakfast!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAfter the breakfast, attendees joined others from the community to break ground on the Bakersfield College Veterans Resource Center, the first capital project to be funded by Measure J. Speakers celebrated Vernon Valenzuela and his importance to our community, and spoke about how it is fitting that the first building to be constructed using the Measure J funds is that in dedication to our veterans. Thank you to our MANY attendees, including Trustee Kay Meek, Trustee Bill Thomas, Trustee Romeo Agbalog for coming to celebrate this momentous occasion! You can view the entire photo album on Facebook.\n\nI grabbed some of these photos from Mayor Goh’s Facebook posts.\n\nKaren Goh, Sonya Christian.

The festival, which honored and showed appreciation to all active and former members of the military, was well-attended by students, community members, and veterans.\n\nThe morning began with the BC Drumline giving a wonderful performance to kick off the festivities. They were followed by the presentation of colors and National Anthem. The MC for the event, Veterans Club President Miguel Valle, did an excellent job welcoming the attendees and introducing the speakers. We had the distinct honor of hearing from the keynote speaker, Lt. Col. (retired) Dr. Tommy Tunson, Director of Public Safety Training Programs, who delivered a truly inspiring speech.\n\nProviding entertainment for the festival were the Brothers of Latin Rock. Music echoed throughout the campus as this talented band played many classic rock songs, adding their own Latin feel, including “Black Magic Woman” by Santana, which was requested by a veteran in attendance. BC student Brooke Perez also got on stage and showcased her amazing voice by singing a handful of songs. Way to go, Brooke!\n\nIt is events like this that remind us how important it is to never forget the sacrifices our veterans have made. I am humbled at how this campus has come together to take care of those who have given so much in the name of freedom.\n\nVery special thanks goes out to the following individuals for contributing to the success of Vetfest:\n\nArmando Trujillo – Veteran Educational Advisor\n\nBernadette Martinez – Office Supervisor, Counseling Dept.\n\nAdeana Williams – Department Assistant, Veterans Resource Center\n\nMiguel Valle – Student Veteran Club President\n\nLee Caldwell – BC Student Veteran\n\nLt. Col (ret.) Dr. Tommy Tunson — Director of Public Safety Training Programs\n\nBC Veteran Club advisors and members\n\nOffice of Student Success & Equity\n\nBC Food Services\n\nBC Facilities, Maintenance & Operations\n\nLast but most definitely not least, a HUGE thank you to Lisa Kent and Paul Beckworth for organizing this week! Thank you to everyone for helping honor our veterans as we celebrate Vet Week. We are BC!\n\nYou can view photos of the entire week’s worth of events on Facebook.\n\nFootball game honoring our Veterans\n\nLast weekend’s football game was a treat. There was a beautiful color in the sky which looked fierce like fire as I made my way towards Memorial Stadium.\n\nIt started with the National Anthem sung by a student veteran who is also a Music Major. His name is Josh Forquera. He works so hard and it shows. Let’s listen to his talent….\n\nThank you to SGA for being so supportive of our football game honoring our Veterans, and for providing the amazing skydivers to kick off the night.\n\nBC’s very own Jeremy Staat performed the coin toss at the game, alongside Chevron’s Gavin Kimmel. Jeremy played football as a Renegade, then went on to play at ASU as a teammate of Pat Tillman. Jeremy’s football career then took him to the NFL, after which he served in the Marines. He’s now a welding instructor at BC.\n\nWe also had a swearing in ceremony for army recruits at halftime. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for these recruits!\n\nThat night, the names of all BC staff/faculty veterans were read aloud. I would like to honor them now by listing them by name once again:\n\nUnited States Marines\n\n• Jeremy Staat, 2005-2009, Corporal (E-4). — Welding\n\n• Armando Trujillo, Marine Corps –Veterans Educational Advisor\n\n• Felix Ramirez from 1980-1985. 1985-2002 Army National Guard (E-7) —Public Safety Officer (ret).

In 2013 when I started as President of Bakersfield College, we received a $125,000 gift from Chevron for various programs and initiatives. With that gift, the college was able to modernize engineering labs equipment from the petroleum and engineering fields.\n\nAn ongoing project between Bakersfield College and Chevron, called Project Lead the Way, grows each and every summer offering more enriching STEM camp opportunities for local high school and middle school students. These day-long summer camps truly inspire students to consider career fields in engineering, robotics, architecture, and more. Check out the article from KGET which highlights these camps from last summer with a video.\n\nBC’s Yadira Guerrero, the Program Manager of Engineering at Bakersfield College has spoke about her passion for bringing hands-on STEM education to young people during these camps made possible by Chevron. “We’re hoping to inspire students and ignite a love for hands-on learning that maybe they don’t get the chance to do a lot of in school,” she said. “We’re hoping the academy will inspire them to want to go to college.”\n\nIn 2016, the Bakersfield College Foundation honored Chevron as Outstanding Corporate Donor for all they invest in our community. Everything Chevron does is focused on preparing students to succeed in school and in life. As a testament to their generosity, they are a core reason for the increase in our engineering majors from 163 in 2008 to 2512 STEM majors in Fall 2018.\n\nIn addition to the STEM camps before students get to BC, the support of BC’s MESA program is life changing. I previously blogged about MESA Week Zero here and news about recent MESA students is regular feature in my blog! It’s amazing to see these young men and women grow and succeed in their studies and budding passion for engineering and STEM careers.\n\nChevron leader and advocate Adam Alvidrez was also on campus for the signing of the Kern Promise in April 2017. The Kern promise supports a vision of focused partnerships between education and industry partners to increase efficiency and ensure that our graduates can find meaningful employment upon completion. You can read more about the signing event in my blog, “Strengthening Kern County One Degree at a Time.”\n\nChevron’s support goes beyond academics and the classroom, extending to athletics and support for our veterans. Last weekend, Chevron’s Gavin Kimmel was on the field alongside BC faculty and Veteran Jeremy Staat for the coin toss. Chevron invited employees to support veterans and attend the Renegade football at the game against Moorepark for a family night out supporting the ‘Gades.\n\nThank you Chevron, for investing in education, supporting our students, and inspiring the future workforce to learn skills that provide living wages and meaningful employment.\n\nWounded Heroes Fund: Salute to Our Local Heroes\n\nFor the 10th year, the local Wounded Heroes Fund sponsored a very successful BBQ steak lunch at the Kern County Fairgrounds–free for all veterans! Just inside the grounds was a range exhibitors that provide services for veterans, employers of veterans, and veteran supporters, such as Kevin McCarthy. Of course, Armando Trujillo, BC Veteran’s Adviser, was stationed at the BC booth, and addressed the gathering regarding his military service and transition home.\n\nInside the pavilion, large rows of camo-covered tables and US flags filled the room providing plenty of space for veterans, families, and friends. Attendees listened to speeches from our local veteran leaders, and rocked to music from outstanding veteran-lead bands. A fantastic steak lunch added to the festivities! BC Director of Veterans programs, Paul Beckworth and his wife Sandra were there with family, and joined by Terri Goldstein, Director of BC Disabled Students Programs & Services.\n\nThe official website states that The Wounded Heroes Fund is a local service organization for veterans and families affected by the war on terror in an effort to provide the support and appreciation they need for a healthy return to civilian life. Thank you to Mayor Karen Goh who always notices BC in the community and is never shy to forward me the photos, BC’s Veteran Services, Terri Goldstein, Director of BC’s DSPS, and BC’s Nursing students who always jump in with involvement in the community. See the post by Mayor Karen Goh on her Facebook! BC Nursing rocks!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThirty Unit Coining Ceremony\n\nOn Wednesday evening Bakersfield College Veteran Services held its first ever 30-unit Coining Ceremony, which signifies an important momentum point for our student-veterans. This milestone captures the halfway mark to the participants’ road to degree completion. Challenge coins are traditionally handed out upon completion of an important task or mission and to raise morale. Wednesday’s ceremony may very be the first of its kind in the California Community College system. Twenty-seven veterans were coined in front of a roomful of family and friends. I’m so proud of our student veterans!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nBC Honored with Joint Assembly & Senate Resolution\n\nEarlier this week, Senator Fuller presented BC with the joint Assembly and Senate Resolution in honor of Bakersfield College receiving the Gold Strong Workforce Star for our Radiologic Technology program and our Registered Nursing program. Over the summer, BC was recognized by the 2018 Strong Workforce Stars for SIXTEEN of our programs! The Strong Workforce Stars highlights career education programs whose students show significant gains in factors important in building a skilled workforce and for advancing personal social mobility: a substantial increase in earnings, attainment of a living wage and placement in a job closely matched with the field of study. Here you’ll be able to see the entire list of programs honored. You can view the ceremony on our Facebook page.\n\nIt was such a beautiful moment, and I’m glad I got to share it with those who work so hard to make our CTE programs successful. Thank you to Tony Cordova, Cindy Collier, Carla Gard, and Jennifer Johnson for all of your hard work and your commitment to our students!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThank you to Senator Fuller, Assemblyman Vince Fong, Senator Andy Vidak and Assemblyman Rudy Salas for your support and this honor.\n\nTelemundo highlights BC’s Free on the Outside program\n\nThank you to Telemundo for highlighting our Free on the Outside program. President Alex Arreola shared how this program has helped him envision a different future for himself and his family. Adolfo Vega shared how the program has provided academic and social support to help him feel part of the Bakersfield College campus. Norma Gaspar congratulated the students for their dedication and commitment to each other and to changing their lives all while encouraging viewers to see the opportunities Bakersfield College has to offer. Providing an avenue for all students to succeed and giving them support is what matters. Todos Somos BC!\n\nYou can watch the segment here on Telemundo.\n\nRoadmap to Public Health Degrees & Careers\n\nSarah Baron of BC’s Public Health Science program hosted an informational fair on Monday along with presentations on degrees and careers in public health. Throughout the morning, she shared tips for transferring to CSU and UC into a public health or health science major and various opportunities to learn more about public health careers from professionals in the field. There was information on how to apply for the UCLA Public Health Scholar program, an overview on how to obtain an Associate Degree for Transfer in Public Health Science and information on the new Health Navigator Certificate.\n\nBC is fortunate to have such incredible faculty who inspire students to learn more and be inspired by their programs and areas of focus. Thank you Sarah Baron!\n\nPanel Discussion – World War I: A Retrospective\n\nOn Tuesday, Bakersfield College professors gave a series of lectures about World War I in the Levan Center to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day this Sunday, which marks the end of The Great War. History professor Tina Mendoza moderated the event, which offered substantive analysis of three different aspects of World War I and how it continues to influence society today.\n\nPaul Beckworth’s presentation focused on the last day of the war on November 11, 1918. Even though a peace agreement had been reached by 5 a.m. that morning, seven US generals forced their troops to continue fighting until the official end of the war at 11 a.m. More than 11,000 casualties were needlessly suffered on that last morning due to the hubris of generals such as John J. Pershing, which Beckworth considers a criminal act and a violation of the social contract that a military officer agrees to when he or she becomes an authority figure in control of the fate of their troops. “An officer is a powerful thing, and it carries with it a heavy responsibility,” Beckworth said. “You don’t grade on curves with other people’s lives.”\n\nOlivia Garcia focused on young men in the British middle and upper class who volunteered to die by the thousands in the first major world conflict of the Industrial Age. Military propaganda convinced young men to fight in the conflict; and the horrifying realities of trench warfare and death at a scale that humanity had never seen before was challenging for Victorian and Edwardian notions of aristocratic masculinity that still permeated British society.\n\nJavier Llamas discussed how the United States’ late entry into World War I reorganized the structure of the Army and provided opportunities for immigrants and African-Americans to defend their country through volunteering and being drafted into the conflict. African-Americans, as well as Asian immigrants and Mexicans, participated in the conflict via segregated units that primarily provided infrastructure for the war effort. Some troops of color, such as the Harlem Hellfighters, got to fight alongside French and Senegalese troops and were treated as equals.\n\nI’d like to thank everyone who participated in this panel Levan Center discussion about World War I. It provided some fascinating perspectives on a conflict that shaped the the 20th Century.\n\nDistinguished Speaker Oz Sanchez\n\nOn Thursday BC hosted its fifth Distinguished Speaker, Oz Sanchez, author of Know No Limits: The Gold Medalist in Us All. Mr. Sanchez is a Marine and 3x Paralympic medalist who spoke about achieving successful change inevitably means overcoming obstacles and, in some cases, recreating oneself through an identity shift. He asked the question: how can you become better if you don’t change your mindset? An open mind creates a growth mindset, and helps create your identity. Mr. Sanchez explained that excuses are justifications for our inactions.\n\nThank you to Dr. Terri Goldstein, Director of Disabled Students Programs and Services, Paul Beckworth, Director of Veterans Services, and Sandi Taylor, Director of Athletics for organizing and advising on this event, and to the Veterans Committee, Renegade Athletics, and Kern Disability Collaborative for collaborating on it as well.\n\nOperation: Not Forgotten Drop Zone\n\nBC held its annual “Operation: Not Forgotten Drop Zone” from 7am-6pm this past Thursday. The community came out and showed its support by dropping off items to send to deployed military personnel overseas, as well as giving cards and letters of support. BC holds this activity annually alongside the group Blue Star Moms. Thanks to everyone who donated and showed their support for our troops!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nServices for David Besst\n\nLast Saturday, I attended a celebration of life for Professor David Besst. There were several faculty and staff and retired faculty and staff at the event.\n\nDavid passed away unexpectedly in October at the age of 55, with 25 of those years being spent as an English faculty at BC. I grabbed these photos from Andrea Thorson’s Facebook post.\n\nEntree to Employment\n\nSpeaking of the Renegade Room and Culinary Arts department, the Career Technical Education Department partnered with the Kern High School District ROC to host the 3rd Bi-Annual, Entrée to Employment event on October 23, 2018. The goal of this event is to introduce our students to the art of networking and gaining valuable knowledge of industry expectations from the employers firsthand. The following Automotive, Fire Technology, Nursing, and Veterinary Technician programs were highlighted. Students were individually selected to participate by their Professors and were required to attend an etiquette class that covered proper dining, attire, and business networking practices. Entrée to Employment took place in our very own Renegade Room, where Chef Suzanne Tangeman, Lab Technician Christian Flores, and their entire staff of students prepared and served an impeccable meal.\n\nWhile there are no expectations of job offers, the survey results from the event were very positive:\n\n95% of the employers surveyed commented on how professional our students were dressed and how effectively they communicated.\n\n1 student was offered an interview the following day\n\n2 students were told about internship opportunities\n\n1 student was invited to a facility tour\n\n1 student invited on a hike with the Battalion Chief\n\n1 student was offered a job\n\nKudos to Beth Harrison, Job Development Specialist, who coordinated the event. Without the assistance of BC culinary students, instructors, staff, community employers and the Kern High School District the event would not have been possible.\n\nStudent Life & SGA hosts Murder Mystery Dinner\n\nThe Renegade Room was packed for the Murder Mystery Dinner hosted by Student Life and BCSGA. The crowd was captivated by the hilarious performers and interactive experience. And the food…well the food was simply to die for! Special thanks to Christian Flores-Castaneda, Alex Gomez, Suzanne Tangeman and the Renegade Room Staff for a night well spent! It was fantastic!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nRunning in Silence\n\nDr. Terri Goldstein, BC’s Director of DSPS, shared an article featuring BC student athlete, Adolfo Escudero-Mendoza. The moving story featured the passion, love of sport, determination, and power of teammates. 23ABC’s Sports Director Kari Osep shot and produced this piece on our very own Men’s XC student athlete Adolfo, who has run Men’s XC since his time at Highland HS, and who does not let being deaf slow him down. His teammates even embrace the challenge of learning ASL to communicate with him and cheer him on. Special thank you to Kari Osep for sharing Adolfo’s story and bringing awareness to the incredible things taking place at the Home of the Renegades. Check out the story “Running in Silence” on 23ABC.\n\nTerri shared with me that Adolfo is also a gifted artist with several of his works hanging in the DSPS office. Here are a few that she shared:\n\nEmails Worth Sharing: Spotlight on Inmate Scholars\n\nCommunication faculty, John Giertz has been teaching at BC for 30 years and shared with me that he recently has taught classes at Kern Valley State Prison. His email said,\n\nOne of my Argumentation students paroled out of the prison at about the same time I was beginning an 8 week argumentation class. Today, Chelsea was waiting for me. We met the student in the hall and it was the first time I really shook his hand and the only time I have been able to give him a hug. This is what this program is about, and I was fortunate to see a former inmate coming back into society. This is what education is all about. To witness a student navigate from one world to another and to be, just a small part of it. This is what all teachers live for. To see your student become involved in your class and to realize that the two of you are walking unchartered territory—together.\n\nProfessor Giertz is one of many committed faculty and staff who prioritize supporting students through education. The Inmate Scholars program, led by Chelsea Esquibias is offering hope through education and transforming lives.\n\nBC is doing amazing things because of the leadership and engagement of faculty, staff, and of course… our students.\n\nThis is why I’m the luckiest and happiest college president EVER!\n\nFun Photos from Halloween Fun at BC\n\nFaculty and staff from the Math and Science departments have continued to share photos with me from the Halloween fun that took place on campus.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTalented Renegades at BC\n\nThroughout October, the talented Renegades in our choirs and chamber singers had some amazing events worth sharing! In case you missed it, on Oct. 25th Hila Plitmann, a Grammy-award winning soprano held a Master Class in the Indoor Theater. She worked with 5 of our Applied Voice Majors, performed 4 solo selections, and held a Q&A with the audience. It was great to see the piece by Susan Scaffidi “Love, tradition, modern hits – BC concert will have it all” in the Bakersfield Californian as well!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe following evening was the Fall Concert entitled Veni, Vidi, Amavi: We Came, We Saw, We Loved which featured Hila Plitmann, the Synergy Chamber Players and the finale included the Fairfax School District Choirs. We had a nearly full house too!\n\nOn October 29th, BC hosted the Chamber Festival with Dr. Cari Earnhart, Director of Choral Activities at Fresno State as our guest clinician for local high school chamber choirs. I’m filled with joy every time we are able to host local high schoolers on campus to showcase their talent. Director, Jennifer Garrett tells me that we had 13 high schools perform. She said, “The transitions were something to behold.”\n\nChamber Singers 5th Annual Holiday Dinner\n\nCan you believe it’s already that time of the year? The BC Chamber Singers will once again host their annual holiday dinner, this year called “Christmas Through the Ages.” This year’s event will take place on December 1, 2018 at 5:00pm and tickets are already going quickly.

It was a treat to be in Delano for our meeting.\n\nAbel Guzman, Raquel Lopez and Jaime Lopez did a great presentation on the expansion of Rural Initiatives.\n\nHomecoming Game\n\nIt was an exciting Saturday evening, October 27th, at Memorial Stadium with the Homecoming Game. The Renegade Football Team hosted East LA College in a wild 2018 homecoming game that ended with a big 58-17 Renegade win.\n\nAt halftime of the game the 1988 JC National Championship Renegade football team was honored on the field and presented with a special hat remembering their exceptional achievement.\n\nAbout 40-50 players and coaches, including Murray Adams, Chris Figueroa, William Young, Bobby Blackman, and Raymond Braxton, came from all across the country to reunite and remember their perfect 11-0 season from that year.\n\nAt the conclusion of the game all in attendance were treated to an incredible fireworks show with a finale that left multiple car alarms blaring throughout the tailgating parking lot!\n\nI love when families come to Renegade athletic events.

Over 800 guests attended our trunk-or-treat, Student Organization led game tables, face painting, inflatables, dancing, and a viewing of Hotel Transylvania 3. It was a great night!\n\nSaturday’s Homecoming Parade visited the packed Tailgating Area with the Drumline leading the way.

Thank you to Homecoming Royalty Candidates (pictured from left to right) Paul Coffman, Francis Benavente, Aliyah Khan, Andrea Lopez, and winner, Emmanuel Limaco – Congratulations, Emmanuel!\n\nBC in the Vineyards Project — Very proud of this work by the Rural Initiatives Team\n\nAs I wrote in last week’s blog, BC was out in the vineyards of Kern County this week. In partnership with the Central Valley Farm workers Foundation, Bakersfield College Rural Initiatives team and outreach advisors visited 20 farmworker crews at local vineyards throughout North and South Kern to promote higher education. The team was able to reach over 1200 farmworkers, planting a seed of hope for higher education. Over 150 workers have requested follow-up services to begin their matriculation.\n\nI would like to thank all those who assisted in this project and Adult Education Managers, Jaime Lopez and Endee Grijalva for coordinating the efforts to make this possible. Although, this outreach effort is the first of its kind, it will not be the last as the Rural Initiatives Team continues to change lives across Kern County!\n\nArt for Planet, Art for People\n\nLevan Center speaker Esther Iverem spoke to the Umoja Community ASTEP students before her evening presentation on Tuesday, October 30, 2018. Iverem is an independent journalist who has written on social justice, arts, and culture for the New York Times and Washington Post. She also has published books on poetry and film reviews.\n\nIverem, also host of the On the Ground radio show, talked to the students in Dr. Paula Parks’ Umoja English class on the importance of creating their own media and locating non-biased sources of information. Most students admitted that they get their news from social media. “Something I took away from her discussion was that everything we enjoy in the media was written by someone and that writing is a career option,” explained Michaela Edwards. Iverem, a native of Philadelphia who lives in Washington, D.C., also spoke on the importance of writing to express oneself. “She reminded me that not only do I have the ability to create as an individual, but the power as an African American to make great narratives. It was very motivating,” stated Dujour Sams.\n\nThe evening presentation consisted of Iverem reading and showing art from her latest book Olokum of the Galaxy, which is the story of Olokum, a West African spirit who lives in the oceans. From below, he witnesses the creation of the seas, bodies of slaves who jumped or were thrown off the slave ships, smoke and coal debris from the industrial revolution, today’s oil and chemical spills, and eventually the destruction of the planet due to man’s abuse.\n\nIverem said that “the way that we are treating the planet is an emergency. We were not great stewards before, but we seem to be going backwards.” She cited recent pipeline construction and increased offshore drilling.\n\nMost of the audience questions centered on her art.\n\nThe book was an offshoot of the Olokum figures that Iverem was making from reclaimed fabric and discarded buttons, chains, and belts. She said that it takes her a few days to hand make each doll. Some also have necklaces with small photos of African Americans (such as Tamir Rice) who were gunned down by police. Iverem’s Olokum projects have combined her passions for social justice, the environment, African-American culture, poetry, writing, and visual and textile art.\n\nWe are so fortunate to welcome journalists, artists, authors and speakers to Bakersfield College to enrich the lives of our students and community with culturally diverse experiences. We are able to educate our students and community beyond the regular classroom curriculum. See why I feel like the luckiest and happiest president? I would like to thank Dr. Paula Parks and Reggie Williams for organizing this event.\n\nAnimal Advice: Are You Listening?\n\nSpeaking of our fortune in being able to bring great scholars to enrich our lives, yesterday, Friday November 2nd, Dr. Rae Ann Kumelos, Bakersfield College English Professor, was honored as this year’s Faculty Colloquium in the Levan Center. About 50 faculty, staff, students and community members were present for her presentation “Animal Advice: Are You Listening?”\n\nThe colloquium examined the relationships between humans and animals through stories from myth, fairy tale, literature, science, pop culture and life. She pointed out that animals are often depicted as a wise helper in fairy tales, shamans use them as totems and spirit guides. We see them in our dreams and the etymology of the word “animal” can mean soul, breath, life and impulse.\n\nIn the physical world, animals are a major part of human life. 63% of homes have animals, while only 35% have children. 89% of pet owners call their animals their children and 94% talk to their pets like people. Presence of animals can lower blood pressure, cholesterol and anxiety and dogs are being used to assist people with medical issues like sensing epileptic seizures and low blood sugar, while others can be used for leading the blind. As our culture shifts from the rural life to a more suburban existence, we are bringing the animals into our homes and backyards and seeing their individual personalities. Yet, 50% of animals have gone extinct in the last 40 years. We recognize our individual pets as having a personality, yet hunters view wild animals as trophies. Rae Ann’s point is that animals are showing us our future and speaking to us about the state of our world and what we humans have done to it. We need to listen to the animals and pay attention to politics about our environment and treatment of animals.\n\nRae Ann writes academically and as a columnist for a variety of national publications about the relationships between humans and animals in myth, literature, astronomy and popular culture. She lectures at various conferences, most recently at Oxford University and has her own radio program broadcast on XM Satellite Radio called Voice of the Animal. Her book Wild Wisdom: Animal Stories of the Southwest received a national award as gift book of the year. We are lucky to have such quality faculty as Rae Ann, congratulations on your award.\n\nThe Faculty Colloquium is made possible by the generous donation from Dr. Norman Levan. Rae Ann was presented a plaque and a $1500 stipend which she plans to use for a safari to see the animals of Africa. Thank you to the Faculty Colloquium committee Susan Pinza, Bob Allison, Adel Shafik, Donna Starr, Nick Strobel, Erin Miller and Richard Marquez (Rae Ann outed that Richard doesn’t like cats, he says he does like dogs), Reggie Williams, Director of the Levan Center, and Alex Gomez for the fabulous food. And now, I am off to ask Neo and Bessie for some wisdom.\n\nCommunity Healthcare Needs Discussion\n\nBakersfield College, CSU Bakersfield, and Senator Andy Vidak partnered together earlier this week to create a forum of discussion between some of the top healthcare professionals in our region and higher education faculty. Bruce Peters, President & CEO of Mercy Hospitals, Sharlet Briggs, President & CEO of Adventist Health, and cardiology specialist Dr. Jeet Singh were just a few of the power houses in attendance. Attendees chatted about how we can all work together to ensure that our area is being provided the programs that it and the industry needs, and to try to help prevent any shortfalls in occupation employment. The interactions and topics were great, and exactly what we wanted to address!\n\nBC’s Associate Dean of Instruction Carla Gard shared her insight on BC’s nursing program. KCCD Associate Vice Chancellor Cindy Collier shared her insight on assisting in the healthcare workforce development in Kern. CSUB’s Chair of the Nursing Program, Debbie Boschini shared insights on challenges and opportunities for developing and strengthening our nursing pathways.\n\nThe conversations and interaction between education and healthcare industry partners led to a commitment to continue working together to develop opportunities for allied health education in our area. THANK YOU to everyone who attended. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this new partnership!\n\nDream Big Conference\n\nTwo-hundred and forty two participants attended the Dream Big Conference at the Bakersfield College main campus on Friday, October 26th. A grand total of 18 local high schools participated in the youth conference. It was a great day of inspiration for English second language learners, migrant students, undocumented youth, and first generation high school students of Kern County. The conference’s mission was to educate, motivate, and inspire disproportionately impacted youth groups with the intention of promoting education as a viable mechanism for future prosperity and social class mobility.\n\nParticipants learned about the various resources on campus, such as FAFSA/CA Dream Act, Dual/Concurrent Enrollment, Matriculation Steps, Transfer Services, EOP&S, and attended a resource fair from a variety of departments and community agencies. In addition to the wealth of knowledge students received, this extraordinary youth conference imparted resiliency, hope, sense of community, and stressed the importance of creating generational change within their immediate family by pursuing post-secondary education. Participants gained insight from a college panel which was made up of student leaders from the LUPE Student Organization. Students received BC swag, danced a little, left the campus well informed, and had a great time.\n\nI want to thank the following departments that supported, organized, and made the conference possible: Office of Student Success & Equity, EOP&S/CARE/CalWORKs Programs, Cal-SOAP, Office of Student Life, Office of VP Student Affairs, Office of Outreach & School Relations, Office of Financial Aid, Adult Education & Rural Initiatives, Counseling & Advising Department, LUPE Student Organization, Kern High School District (KHSD), Academic Support Services, Maintenance & Operations, BC Food Services, and the many wonderful student volunteers!\n\nWe are BC! (Somos BC!)\n\nFall Pathways Fest\n\nThis week we had another inspiring event for current students about the Learning & Career Pathways and support services. The sky was blue and the weather was perfect for the BC Counseling Faculty and Educational Advising team to host the inaugural Fall Pathways Fest outside on the Student Crossroads lawn. On Wednesday, October 31st, 2018, campus students were provided with full access to informational tables hosted for each Learning and Career Pathway, such as Agriculture/Nutrition/Culinary Arts, Arts/Humanities/Communication, Business, Education, Health Sciences, Industrial and Transportation Technology, Public Safety Training, Social and Behavioral Sciences, STEM, and Personal and Career Exploration.\n\nIn addition, CSU Bakersfield, the FINISH IN 4 Program, BC Transfer Center, LET’S TEACH, Summer Bridge, and EOP&S/CARE/calWORKS hosted tables promoting various support program services critical to student success and completion.\n\nAt the event, students met one-on-one with their Pathways Counselors and Advisors, signed up for educational workshops, received information regarding their majors, and obtained additional services such as change of major, educational planning, and major exploration. Food was provided by the Office of Student Success and Equity.\n\nI would like to thank Mark Oseo and the Counseling and Advising Department for organizing and hosting this event and thank all of the departments, staff and faculty that participated. This successful event exemplifies a structured educational experience to support our students. As a partner with California Guided Pathways project, BC is changing the way education is provided to our students. We are integrating our initiatives and providing students with maps to achieving their goals. This event exemplifies our dedication to the Guided Pathways Project and our students.\n\nEmployer of the Year for Large Business\n\nBC is honored to be recognized as Employer of the Year for Large Business at the 2018 Mayor’s Helping Incorporate Reliable Employees (HIRE) Luncheon. Manager of Operations, Ramon Puga accepted the award on October 16, 2018 during the HIRE luncheon which celebrates local employees with disabilities, employers, and National Disability Employment Awareness month. Originally founded by former Mayor Harvey Hall, current Mayor Karen Goh is continuing to champion and celebrate diversity within our workforce. The recipient of the Employer of the Year Award is a recognized employer who has shown active recruitment and hiring practices promoting the concept of employment of people with disabilities.\n\nBakersfield College is proud to offer on-campus student employment opportunities which can sometimes evolve into full time or permanent positions alongside programs like Disabled Students Programs and Services (DSPS), which ensures equal access to educational opportunities for all students with disabilities.

This year’s Leadership Academy cohort was presented with topics that included Guided Pathways, Baccalaureate degrees, Dual Enrollment, Facilities, and Strong Workforce.\n\nJohn Means, Vice Chancellor, began the day by welcoming everyone with an overview of the day’s activities. He was followed by Cornelio Rodriguez, Dean of Instruction at BC, who talked about the BC campus, including its centers, programs, and bright future. The audience was moved by his story of a young Latina student who, after graduating, received a bouquet of roses from her father.\n\nAfter the morning session, the group was treated to a cart tour of the BC campus, which highlighted Memorial Stadium, the Veterans Center, and Horticulture Lab. The day was a good opportunity for the district staff in attendance to learn about all the great things going on at BC.
