        "text": "BC Students, lean on BC.\n\nSometimes in our lives we all have pain\n\nWe all have sorrow\n\nBut if we are wise\n\nWe know that there’s always tomorrow.\n\nLean on me, when you’re not strong\n\nAnd I’ll be your friend\n\nI’ll help you carry on\n\nFor it won’t be long\n\n‘Til I’m gonna need\n\nSomebody to lean on (Bill Withers)\n\nGood morning, Bakersfield. Happy Easter\n\nIt is Saturday, April 11, 2020… A great day to be a Renegade.\n\nBill Withers\n\nI was saddened to hear that the legendary soul singer Bill Withers, passed away at the age of 81 last week. Withers is a three-time Grammy Award winner best known for the songs “Lean On Me” and “Ain’t No Sunshine”, which are both on Rolling Stone’s List of the 500 greatest songs of all time.\n\nJon Pareles wrote a moving piece in the New York Times about how Bill Withers used his music as a tool to express his compassion and selflessness. Withers was in his early 30s when his recording career started, and his real-life experiences serving in the Navy and working in factories brought an authenticity to his songs about people and their everyday lives. A 2009 documentary about Withers’ life titled “Still Bill” traces the influential singer’s life from his childhood in West Virginia to his retirement from the music industry in 1985.\n\nEnjoying spring with national poetry month\n\nJack Hernandez emailed me about April being National Poetry Month. His email triggered me dusting off an old book of poems that was part of my high school curriculum. Here are a few verses from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s The Cloud\n\nI bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,\n\nFrom the seas and the streams;\n\nI bear light shade for the leaves when laid\n\nIn their noonday dreams.\n\nFrom my wings are shaken the dews that waken\n\nThe sweet buds every one,\n\nWhen rocked to rest on their mother’s breast,\n\nAs she dances about the sun.\n\nI wield the flail of the lashing hail,\n\nAnd whiten the green plains under,\n\nAnd then again I dissolve it in rain,\n\nAnd laugh as I pass in thunder.\n\nHere is another lovely poem by Jack Hearnandez\n\nWaiting\n\nBy Jack Hernandez\n\nWhen dawn brings\n\nthe darkness,\n\nand light confounds\n\nthe day,\n\nwe are given\n\nthe gift of waiting,\n\nwhich must be opened\n\nto show the way\n\nof breathing\n\nwithout a calendar\n\nwhose hours\n\nare trained to run,\n\nWe must hold silence\n\nlike a bowl\n\nreceiving rain,\n\na leaf shining\n\nin the sun,\n\nWe must feel\n\nin stillness\n\nthe caress of hope.\n\nThank you Jack!\n\n============================\n\nThank you Greg and Mary Bynum\n\nOf Bakersfield College’s 40,000 students, 80% are First Generation, approximately 80% are low income, and many rely on campus WiFi and computer labs to access the internet in order to complete their assignments. Students’ responses to a March 20 survey revealed that about one in 10 students do not have adequate off-campus internet access while nearly a quarter of students use their cell phones as their primary device to access their courses. In response to student high student need for technology as Bakersfield College moved instruction online, BC developed a laptop loan program with a generous donation from Greg and Mary Bynum.\n\nEma Sasic covered this story in the April 10th issue of The Bakersfield Californian. https://tinyurl.com/r4jskk8\n\nJoseph Luiz covered it on KGET https://tinyurl.com/sqpcsx7\n\nBack to College\n\nIn my virtual forums, I have been sharing an article from Politico on April 2 highlighting the 10 million workers nationwide who filed jobless claims over the previous 2 weeks. Yet another surge has brought the total of new jobless claims during this pandemic to over 17 million. I have also been sharing this chart showing how the current unemployment claims compare with unemployment data from the Great Recession. One key difference is how quickly the jobless claims have spiked.\n\nI have previously mentioned the Back to College program our team has created to help combat rising unemployment in Kern County. It is my hope that our community can continue to Lean on BC in this time of need and difficulty.\n\nOur team held four sessions last week and two additional sessions this week to answer student questions and get students registered for these courses. Thank you to Victor Diaz, Erineo Garcia, Jo Ann Acosta, Heather Skibinski, Ashlea Ward and Armando Trujillo for leading these sessions and getting our students registered.\n\nI also want to thank Joseph Tipay, David Moton, Oliver Rosales, Isaias Hernandez, Sylvia Reyes, Beenne Anglin and Jonathan Ward for agreeing to take on this important work and teach these courses to our students. This 5-week program will help jumpstart students’ educational journeys and put them on a path that can lead to new associates degrees or transfer options. Online classes begin on Monday.\n\nLevan Institute Moves Online\n\nOn Monday, the Levan Institute for Lifelong Learning announced seven online classes starting the week of April 20.

Thank you to our whole Information Technology Department for helping us manage this transition.\n\nRenegade Nurses Help Fight COVID-19\n\nBakersfield College nursing students have stepped up to meet the need for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only eight weeks from graduation, our Level 4 nursing students were thrown into uncertainty as we shifted to a virtual learning environment. But our Associate Dean of Nursing, Carla Gard, playing to “where the puck was going to be,” coordinated externship opportunities with our community health partners: Kern Medical, Dignity Health Systems and Bakersfield Heart Hospital.\n\nWorking in paid positions at these facilities, these 69 senior students will be paired with nurses so they can complete their education by providing hands-on patient care.\n\nNursing student Shantelle Rubio and Cindy Collier were interviewed by Valley Public Radio last week, and Fresno Univision affiliate KFTV-21 featured our nursing students in a piece for Spanish-language media.\n\nHere’s a salute and prayer for all healthcare workers who are on the front lines of this epidemic.\n\nRenegades on the Front Lines\n\nEnglish faculty member Kaitlin Hulsy wrote a beautiful piece about the importance of nursing and her late mother’s 35-year career in nursing, which started right here at Bakersfield College. Thank you, Kaitlin!\n\nBefore I existed in this world, my mother was a student in the nursing program at Bakersfield College. At the time, she was a single mother who was working multiple jobs to raise two young boys and pay her way through college. My mother was always glamorous, but during her days hitting the books, she had a little more grit as opposed to glitter.\n\nBonny Lou Hulsy walked across the stage at graduation with a smile on her face. She had done it! She went on to have a 35-year career in nursing. This started with cleaning bedpans, and eventually morphed into assisting doctors in diagnosing kiddos with autism at Kern Regional Center. She eventually co-founded one of the top schools in the nation for children with autism and autistic spectrum disorders. Her sons are now grown, one of them the CAO of Kern County.\n\nWe know that nurses can do anything. More importantly, we know how needed they are at this uncertain time. It is in the spirit that I have an ask for the sixty-nine nursing students who are about to be on the front lines in the time of COVID-19: What do you need? How may we help each and every one of you as you begin your journey?\n\nIt is my desire to put together a wish list of items for our 69 Renegade nurses to bring them comfort as they confront a still very much unknown dragon. Please email Endee Grijalva to request any items you need. We will do our best to accommodate you.\n\nIn the meantime, please know that my mother is looking down from Heaven on BC nursing and bubbling with pride. As a faculty number, I join countless others who are so incredibly proud of you. We Are BC!\n\nUntil next time,\n\nKaitlin Hulsy\n\nEmails Worth Sharing: Castle In the Storm\n\nKaitlin is also spearheading an important creative outlet for Renegades as they shelter in place. In Kaitlin’s most recent column on the website, she shares her thoughts about teaching being the best job in the world. Read her email below about Castle In the Storm.\n\nGood Afternoon, Colleagues:\n\nI wanted to humbly direct your attention to a project I’m working on, namely Castle In the Storm.\n\nCastle in the Storm is a place for Renegade students who need a creative outlet in the time of Covid-19. The website functions both as a place to showcase student work, in addition to being a repository for professional advice and published pieces from established authors. Our logo was created by BC alumnus and local comedienne Margaret Haggard, and original student work is appearing daily.

Bill Thomas would continue to be a champion for Bakersfield College over the next half-century as a BC professor, KCCD Trustee, and US Congressman representing the Southern San Joaquin Valley. Check the article out below, and stay tuned for more glimpses at Renegade life in the 1960s.\n\n“During the last meeting of the Board of Representatives, Fall Semester, a motion was made without proper parliamentary procedures; this mistake was corrected by a member of the Board with the supervision of an interested teacher who had come into the meeting for a few minutes. Noticing this teacher’s interest in student government, Mr. Ronald McMasters, Advisor, appointed him as the Spring Semester Advisor to student government, knowing there was a vacancy for that position.\n\n“Mr. William Thomas has taught at Bakersfield College for the last two years. Previous to this he attended Santa Ana Junior College, where he received his A.A. degree, after which he transferred to San Francisco State College. After four years with a year of student teaching, he obtained his B.A. and M.A. degrees.\n\n“Besides being Advisor to Student Government, Mr. Thomas is a member of the Board of Publications. He teachers the Parliamentary Procedures Class, Political Science 1, and Social Science 53A and B. Previous to his new appointment, he was advisor to the Tutorial Project and the Young Republicans Club.\n\n“Mr. Thomas enjoys many extra-curricular activities but is not interested in any special activity. He enjoys sports very much, such as handball and basketball, and he also rides a motorcycle occasionally. To pass the time, he reads and listens to music. Most of his weekends in the past two years have been spent chaperoning the college dances.\n\n“Mr. Thomas is very active and is interested in helping the Bakersfield College students whenever he can through his active life in Student Government and campus life.”\n\nMore recent photos of Bill Thomas.\n\nAthletics\n\nWatch this week’s edition of the Renegade Report on the Bakersfield College Athletics Facebook page featuring our Renegade Men’s Tennis Coach Noel Dalton and Head Football Coach R. Todd Littlejohn. Both Coaches talked to Kenny Calvin, the radio host of the Renegade Report, about leading young student-athletes through this unprecedented time. The three also talked about how student-athletes and coaches are facing the stoppage of sports. Click the link to listen to the conversation on Facebook:\n\nNational Student-Athlete Day\n\nMonday, April 6th, was National Student-Athlete Day! With all of our sports teams at a standstill, it’s a unique time for athletic staff and coaches, and in particular, for student-athletes. On top of going to class and studying hard, they put in many hours in practice and competition every week. Even now, as we are all sheltering in place, our athletes are hard at work at home, pushing themselves to stay in shape so that they are ready to compete once again. Happy National Student-Athlete Day Renegades, you’re doing fantastic training at home!\n\nBrett Clark Named BVarsity Coach of the Year\n\nBrett Clark, BC’s head wrestling coach and the head girls wrestling coach at Frontier High School, was named the BVarsity All-Area Girls Wrestling Coach of the Year this week. Congrats go out to Coach Clark for this accomplishment! We are lucky to have a coach who is so devoted to developing young talent within our community.\n\nSpecial Edition: “I Miss Sports Because…”\n\nWe asked our student-athletes on social media this week to finish this sentence, “I miss sports because…” Here are a few of their responses\n\nBlake Keesey, from Men’s Golf: “I miss the pressure of needing to hit the shot at the right moment. I miss the early morning drives with the team. I miss the nerves of the opening shot. I miss fighting for each other.”\n\nBrooklyn Walsh, from Women’s Golf: “My team is my family.”\n\nCaleb Jameson, from Men’s Golf: “I miss sports because I miss my team, I miss my brothers, and I miss the pressure and expectations that come with sports.”\n\nCarlos Estrada, from the Football team: “The family environment.”\n\nThat’s all for now.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nWith much Renegade Pride and Collegiality.\n\nsonya-\n\nthe luckiest and happiest college president ever\n\nGood morning Bakersfield.\n\nIt is Saturday, November 3, 2018…..a great day to be a Renegade.\n\nVery active week at BC…but then that’s how we roll at BC.\n\nOn Friday, College Council met at our Delano Campus. It was a treat to be in Delano for our meeting.\n\nAbel Guzman, Raquel Lopez and Jaime Lopez did a great presentation on the expansion of Rural Initiatives.\n\nHomecoming Game\n\nIt was an exciting Saturday evening, October 27th, at Memorial Stadium with the Homecoming Game. The Renegade Football Team hosted East LA College in a wild 2018 homecoming game that ended with a big 58-17 Renegade win.\n\nAt halftime of the game the 1988 JC National Championship Renegade football team was honored on the field and presented with a special hat remembering their exceptional achievement.\n\nAbout 40-50 players and coaches, including Murray Adams, Chris Figueroa, William Young, Bobby Blackman, and Raymond Braxton, came from all across the country to reunite and remember their perfect 11-0 season from that year.\n\nAt the conclusion of the game all in attendance were treated to an incredible fireworks show with a finale that left multiple car alarms blaring throughout the tailgating parking lot!\n\nI love when families come to Renegade athletic events. And I was happy to see retired Dean Frank Gornick out at the game – once a Renegade always a Renegade! More about Frank-Gornick, Board of Directors for Foundation for California Community Colleges\n\nLook at who else was at the homecoming game:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAs always, the fireworks display was spectacular.\n\nDid you see the feature on KGET highlighting the incredible work of BC’s Industrial Automation seniors? See how students Chad and Aaron prepared their robots for Renegade football on KGET.\n\nHomecoming Week\n\nHomecoming Week closed out with a bang last week as Student Life and BC Student Government Association (BCSGA) welcomed the community to the BC Campus for the Friday Night Halloween Bash on October 26th. Over 800 guests attended our trunk-or-treat, Student Organization led game tables, face painting, inflatables, dancing, and a viewing of Hotel Transylvania 3. It was a great night!\n\nSaturday’s Homecoming Parade visited the packed Tailgating Area with the Drumline leading the way. Fans were so excited to see and take photos with the mascot, Emmanuel Limaco, who was crowned later at the halftime show as Homecoming Royalty. Thank you to Homecoming Royalty Candidates (pictured from left to right) Paul Coffman, Francis Benavente, Aliyah Khan, Andrea Lopez, and winner, Emmanuel Limaco – Congratulations, Emmanuel!\n\nBC in the Vineyards Project — Very proud of this work by the Rural Initiatives Team\n\nAs I wrote in last week’s blog, BC was out in the vineyards of Kern County this week. In partnership with the Central Valley Farm workers Foundation, Bakersfield College Rural Initiatives team and outreach advisors visited 20 farmworker crews at local vineyards throughout North and South Kern to promote higher education. The team was able to reach over 1200 farmworkers, planting a seed of hope for higher education. Over 150 workers have requested follow-up services to begin their matriculation.\n\nI would like to thank all those who assisted in this project and Adult Education Managers, Jaime Lopez and Endee Grijalva for coordinating the efforts to make this possible. Although, this outreach effort is the first of its kind, it will not be the last as the Rural Initiatives Team continues to change lives across Kern County!\n\nArt for Planet, Art for People\n\nLevan Center speaker Esther Iverem spoke to the Umoja Community ASTEP students before her evening presentation on Tuesday, October 30, 2018. Iverem is an independent journalist who has written on social justice, arts, and culture for the New York Times and Washington Post. She also has published books on poetry and film reviews.\n\nIverem, also host of the On the Ground radio show, talked to the students in Dr. Paula Parks’ Umoja English class on the importance of creating their own media and locating non-biased sources of information. Most students admitted that they get their news from social media. “Something I took away from her discussion was that everything we enjoy in the media was written by someone and that writing is a career option,” explained Michaela Edwards. Iverem, a native of Philadelphia who lives in Washington, D.C., also spoke on the importance of writing to express oneself. “She reminded me that not only do I have the ability to create as an individual, but the power as an African American to make great narratives. It was very motivating,” stated Dujour Sams.\n\nThe evening presentation consisted of Iverem reading and showing art from her latest book Olokum of the Galaxy, which is the story of Olokum, a West African spirit who lives in the oceans. From below, he witnesses the creation of the seas, bodies of slaves who jumped or were thrown off the slave ships, smoke and coal debris from the industrial revolution, today’s oil and chemical spills, and eventually the destruction of the planet due to man’s abuse.\n\nIverem said that “the way that we are treating the planet is an emergency. We were not great stewards before, but we seem to be going backwards.” She cited recent pipeline construction and increased offshore drilling.\n\nMost of the audience questions centered on her art.\n\nThe book was an offshoot of the Olokum figures that Iverem was making from reclaimed fabric and discarded buttons, chains, and belts. She said that it takes her a few days to hand make each doll. Some also have necklaces with small photos of African Americans (such as Tamir Rice) who were gunned down by police. Iverem’s Olokum projects have combined her passions for social justice, the environment, African-American culture, poetry, writing, and visual and textile art.\n\nWe are so fortunate to welcome journalists, artists, authors and speakers to Bakersfield College to enrich the lives of our students and community with culturally diverse experiences. We are able to educate our students and community beyond the regular classroom curriculum. See why I feel like the luckiest and happiest president? I would like to thank Dr. Paula Parks and Reggie Williams for organizing this event.\n\nAnimal Advice: Are You Listening?\n\nSpeaking of our fortune in being able to bring great scholars to enrich our lives, yesterday, Friday November 2nd, Dr. Rae Ann Kumelos, Bakersfield College English Professor, was honored as this year’s Faculty Colloquium in the Levan Center. About 50 faculty, staff, students and community members were present for her presentation “Animal Advice: Are You Listening?”\n\nThe colloquium examined the relationships between humans and animals through stories from myth, fairy tale, literature, science, pop culture and life. She pointed out that animals are often depicted as a wise helper in fairy tales, shamans use them as totems and spirit guides. We see them in our dreams and the etymology of the word “animal” can mean soul, breath, life and impulse.\n\nIn the physical world, animals are a major part of human life. 63% of homes have animals, while only 35% have children. 89% of pet owners call their animals their children and 94% talk to their pets like people. Presence of animals can lower blood pressure, cholesterol and anxiety and dogs are being used to assist people with medical issues like sensing epileptic seizures and low blood sugar, while others can be used for leading the blind. As our culture shifts from the rural life to a more suburban existence, we are bringing the animals into our homes and backyards and seeing their individual personalities. Yet, 50% of animals have gone extinct in the last 40 years. We recognize our individual pets as having a personality, yet hunters view wild animals as trophies. Rae Ann’s point is that animals are showing us our future and speaking to us about the state of our world and what we humans have done to it. We need to listen to the animals and pay attention to politics about our environment and treatment of animals.\n\nRae Ann writes academically and as a columnist for a variety of national publications about the relationships between humans and animals in myth, literature, astronomy and popular culture. She lectures at various conferences, most recently at Oxford University and has her own radio program broadcast on XM Satellite Radio called Voice of the Animal. Her book Wild Wisdom: Animal Stories of the Southwest received a national award as gift book of the year. We are lucky to have such quality faculty as Rae Ann, congratulations on your award.\n\nThe Faculty Colloquium is made possible by the generous donation from Dr. Norman Levan. Rae Ann was presented a plaque and a $1500 stipend which she plans to use for a safari to see the animals of Africa. Thank you to the Faculty Colloquium committee Susan Pinza, Bob Allison, Adel Shafik, Donna Starr, Nick Strobel, Erin Miller and Richard Marquez (Rae Ann outed that Richard doesn’t like cats, he says he does like dogs), Reggie Williams, Director of the Levan Center, and Alex Gomez for the fabulous food. And now, I am off to ask Neo and Bessie for some wisdom.\n\nCommunity Healthcare Needs Discussion\n\nBakersfield College, CSU Bakersfield, and Senator Andy Vidak partnered together earlier this week to create a forum of discussion between some of the top healthcare professionals in our region and higher education faculty. Bruce Peters, President & CEO of Mercy Hospitals, Sharlet Briggs, President & CEO of Adventist Health, and cardiology specialist Dr. Jeet Singh were just a few of the power houses in attendance. Attendees chatted about how we can all work together to ensure that our area is being provided the programs that it and the industry needs, and to try to help prevent any shortfalls in occupation employment. The interactions and topics were great, and exactly what we wanted to address!\n\nBC’s Associate Dean of Instruction Carla Gard shared her insight on BC’s nursing program. KCCD Associate Vice Chancellor Cindy Collier shared her insight on assisting in the healthcare workforce development in Kern. CSUB’s Chair of the Nursing Program, Debbie Boschini shared insights on challenges and opportunities for developing and strengthening our nursing pathways.\n\nThe conversations and interaction between education and healthcare industry partners led to a commitment to continue working together to develop opportunities for allied health education in our area. THANK YOU to everyone who attended. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this new partnership!\n\nDream Big Conference\n\nTwo-hundred and forty two participants attended the Dream Big Conference at the Bakersfield College main campus on Friday, October 26th. A grand total of 18 local high schools participated in the youth conference. It was a great day of inspiration for English second language learners, migrant students, undocumented youth, and first generation high school students of Kern County. The conference’s mission was to educate, motivate, and inspire disproportionately impacted youth groups with the intention of promoting education as a viable mechanism for future prosperity and social class mobility.\n\nParticipants learned about the various resources on campus, such as FAFSA/CA Dream Act, Dual/Concurrent Enrollment, Matriculation Steps, Transfer Services, EOP&S, and attended a resource fair from a variety of departments and community agencies. In addition to the wealth of knowledge students received, this extraordinary youth conference imparted resiliency, hope, sense of community, and stressed the importance of creating generational change within their immediate family by pursuing post-secondary education. Participants gained insight from a college panel which was made up of student leaders from the LUPE Student Organization. Students received BC swag, danced a little, left the campus well informed, and had a great time.\n\nI want to thank the following departments that supported, organized, and made the conference possible: Office of Student Success & Equity, EOP&S/CARE/CalWORKs Programs, Cal-SOAP, Office of Student Life, Office of VP Student Affairs, Office of Outreach & School Relations, Office of Financial Aid, Adult Education & Rural Initiatives, Counseling & Advising Department, LUPE Student Organization, Kern High School District (KHSD), Academic Support Services, Maintenance & Operations, BC Food Services, and the many wonderful student volunteers!\n\nWe are BC! (Somos BC!)\n\nFall Pathways Fest\n\nThis week we had another inspiring event for current students about the Learning & Career Pathways and support services. The sky was blue and the weather was perfect for the BC Counseling Faculty and Educational Advising team to host the inaugural Fall Pathways Fest outside on the Student Crossroads lawn. On Wednesday, October 31st, 2018, campus students were provided with full access to informational tables hosted for each Learning and Career Pathway, such as Agriculture/Nutrition/Culinary Arts, Arts/Humanities/Communication, Business, Education, Health Sciences, Industrial and Transportation Technology, Public Safety Training, Social and Behavioral Sciences, STEM, and Personal and Career Exploration.\n\nIn addition, CSU Bakersfield, the FINISH IN 4 Program, BC Transfer Center, LET’S TEACH, Summer Bridge, and EOP&S/CARE/calWORKS hosted tables promoting various support program services critical to student success and completion.\n\nAt the event, students met one-on-one with their Pathways Counselors and Advisors, signed up for educational workshops, received information regarding their majors, and obtained additional services such as change of major, educational planning, and major exploration. Food was provided by the Office of Student Success and Equity.\n\nI would like to thank Mark Oseo and the Counseling and Advising Department for organizing and hosting this event and thank all of the departments, staff and faculty that participated. This successful event exemplifies a structured educational experience to support our students. As a partner with California Guided Pathways project, BC is changing the way education is provided to our students. We are integrating our initiatives and providing students with maps to achieving their goals. This event exemplifies our dedication to the Guided Pathways Project and our students.\n\nEmployer of the Year for Large Business\n\nBC is honored to be recognized as Employer of the Year for Large Business at the 2018 Mayor’s Helping Incorporate Reliable Employees (HIRE) Luncheon. Manager of Operations, Ramon Puga accepted the award on October 16, 2018 during the HIRE luncheon which celebrates local employees with disabilities, employers, and National Disability Employment Awareness month. Originally founded by former Mayor Harvey Hall, current Mayor Karen Goh is continuing to champion and celebrate diversity within our workforce. The recipient of the Employer of the Year Award is a recognized employer who has shown active recruitment and hiring practices promoting the concept of employment of people with disabilities.\n\nBakersfield College is proud to offer on-campus student employment opportunities which can sometimes evolve into full time or permanent positions alongside programs like Disabled Students Programs and Services (DSPS), which ensures equal access to educational opportunities for all students with disabilities. Services are available to support students through certificate or degree completion in order to gain skillful employment within the local workforce.\n\nBakersfield College staff, Daniel Gutierrez, was also nominated for Employee of the Year, while Howard Silver, long-time volunteer on the Bakersfield College Workability Advisory Board, was nominated for the Harvey L. Hall Humanitarian of the Year Award.\n\nVarious BC staff participate in the HIRE Committee including Rudy Gutierrez, Workability Job Development Specialist, Jessica McGrath, Career Education Job Development, Carlos Medina, Career Education Job Development Specialist and Denise Crawford, Program Manager for Workability. I am truly the luckiest and happiest president to have such caring staff.\n\nKern High School Transition Fair for Students with Disabilities\n\nDisabled Students Programs & Services at Bakersfield College was well represented at Kern High School Districts’ Annual Transition Fair for Students with Disabilities on November 1, 2018. DSPS’ Job Development Specialist Rudy Gutierrez, Alternative Media Specialist Katrina Marquez, and Director Dr. Terri Goldstein met with students and their parents as they considered options for what to do after high school.\n\nAlso at the event were Janis Mendenhall and Amar Abbott from Taft College and representatives from CSU Bakersfield and Fresno State, as well as a number of state and community-based programs.\n\nLucky attendees won gift baskets from various groups, including a large basket of BC items that every respectable Renegade needs. The event was so well attended, they will need to find a larger location for 2019!\n\nThank you Terri, Rudy and Katrina for representing the college. It is so important that we prepare all of our students for the transition from high school and to enable them to be successful.\n\nKCCD Leadership Academy\n\nOn Friday, November 2, Bakersfield College hosted the KCCD Leadership Academy, which works to prepare classified, faculty, and management employees for leadership roles at every level of the organization through experiential learning opportunities in day-long workshops. This year’s Leadership Academy cohort was presented with topics that included Guided Pathways, Baccalaureate degrees, Dual Enrollment, Facilities, and Strong Workforce.\n\nJohn Means, Vice Chancellor, began the day by welcoming everyone with an overview of the day’s activities. He was followed by Cornelio Rodriguez, Dean of Instruction at BC, who talked about the BC campus, including its centers, programs, and bright future. The audience was moved by his story of a young Latina student who, after graduating, received a bouquet of roses from her father.\n\nAfter the morning session, the group was treated to a cart tour of the BC campus, which highlighted Memorial Stadium, the Veterans Center, and Horticulture Lab. The day was a good opportunity for the district staff in attendance to learn about all the great things going on at BC. Everyone learned information to help enhance their leadership skills.\n\nThank you to all of the presenters for your time and effort, including:\n\nJohn Means, Vice Chancellor, KCCD\n\nMichele Bresso, Dean of Instruction, Bakersfield College\n\nCornelio Rodriguez, Dean of Instruction, Bakersfield College\n\nJennifer Johnson, Dept.

Here are a few fun photos:\n\nI heard a rumor that Matt Garrett made his costume from scratch.\n\nWe are BC!\n\nThat’s all for now.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nWith much Renegade Pride and Collegiality.\n\nsonya —\n\nthe luckiest and happiest college president ever\n\nGood morning Bakersfield.\n\nIt is Saturday, August 25, 2018….\n\nthe day a great American Hero, John McCain, passed away.\n\nHere is one of the many McCain character moments that I love.\n\nSenator John McCain, an American Hero!\n\nNow to get back to Bakersfield College…. woke up to BC featured in The Bakersfield Californian and the Bakersfield Life magazine.\n\nFor starters Erin Auerbach‘s piece was published in the Bakersfield Life Magazine.\n\nRenegade Athlete Cameron Robeson\n\nGreat piece on the Homeless Shelter\n\nWelcome Week Fall 2018\n\nEnrollments are up for the fifth year in a row! BC’s current FTES has increased by 3.8%! The campus has been hustling and bustling, which is a nice change from the quiet that typically falls over the campus during the summer. Welcome to Fall 2018 – it’s a great day to be a Renegade!\n\nThe Office of Student Life and the Outreach & School Relations Department had welcome tents around Panorama campus for staff and faculty Renegades to greet arriving students and be available to help them with campus information and student planners. The tables were at the Administration Building, Red and White Way near the Huddle, and at the Roundabout in P3, the solar parking lot. Student Life also had golf carts roaming the campus offering rides and guidance to students as they walked around campus.\n\nKristina Whitmore from the Student Success and Equity Office was also driving a cart. They are calling it the “GUBER” ride. I think this meant a Golf Cart UBER – but who knows?!\n\nMultiple activities were hosted around campus to ensure that students had something to do between classes. Faculty and staff were out and about and the campus was bustling with activities. It was great to see Dean Billie Jo Rice having her morning coffee and sharing about BC’s ISER with Ginger Leblanc out in front of the Grace Van Dyke Bird Library. Just love this photos….great smiles…and so relaxed. We are BC!\n\nOffice of Student Life and the Outreach and School Relations department hosted a table near the Administration Building where they were able to help students, answer questions, and talk about BC. The people in the Office of Student Life and your Bakersfield College Student Government Association (BCSGA) understand how overwhelming that first day of the semester can be.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPublic Safety had officers conducting high visibility patrols in the parking lots. They, too, assisted students with questions regarding parking permits and where their classes were located on campus. We set up a right-turn-only traffic direction when leaving by the main driveway to assist students and staff to exit the campus easily onto Haley Street. This right-turn-only exit has helped in reducing congestion there.\n\nThe Welcome Center was an incredible hub of energy serving students with all sorts of questions and concerns throughout the first week. The camera was flashing non-stop as the Welcome Center crew prepared student ID’s for all our new Renegades. The amazing Steve Watkin, Director of Outreach and Dual Enrollment was also spending time at the front counter to assist students one-on-one.\n\nI’m the luckiest and happiest college president ever because of the way that BC truly supports our students. On Opening Day, it was incredible to see the helping hands of management, faculty, and staff everywhere! Like Corny Rodriguez, Manny Mourtzanos, Michele Bresso, Bill Moseley and others who I spotted in BC Food Services taking ticket orders or crafting sandwiches.\n\nThe Bakersfield Californian highlighted the smooth opening week due to the hard work of our Measure J construction planning team. In the article, “BC delays parking lot work to September, college opens smoothly” Steven Mayer said, “The college’s efforts to convince students, staff and faculty to ride the bus, carpool, ride a bike, or be dropped off may have helped ease the pressure. And administrators postponed plans to close a parking lot for improvements, a decision that likely was met with a sigh of relief from some students.” Students who are mentioned in the article took various modes of transportation to class and that’s wonderful to hear since our team has created partnerships and programs to help ease the commuter transportation burden.\n\nPartnership with Kern Transit\n\nCheck out Tamara Baker’s post on Facebook with Tabatha Mills of KGET who helped share the news about this incredible partnership. You can view the story HERE!\n\nBakersfield College students can ride Kern Transit for FREE as long as they present a valid student ID. Free rides begin in the Fall 2018 semester and will continue through the Spring 2019 semester. Students may ride free on all 100-numbered routes, not just on routes to and from the school, so they can save money commuting all around Kern County! For more information about routes and schedules, visit the Kern Transit website.\n\nRise and Shine Renegades\n\nDr. Nicky Damania was out early Tuesday morning sharing valuable information with Claudette Stefanian and the Eyewitness News team to get our Renegades off to a good start! During the four live broadcasts, Dr. Nicky Damania highlighted the Renegade Shuttle Express and the expansion of the service to help students access all our campuses and provided tips for student success as well as sharing the many ways students can get involved.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nBakersfield College’s SGA’s Student Activities Manager, Beth Hilne shared information regarding the 2018-2019 activities planned for students and the community and provided a warm Renegade welcome. The team was out early and clearly committed to sharing information that will set our students up for success! And what a beautiful sunrise over Bakersfield College!!\n\nTwo additional bus services provided to students and employees\n\nThis year we decided to offer two additional bus services to our students and employees.\n\n#1. A FREE parking shuttle service to bring students into the core of the campus from the parking lots on the south side of the campus. This service will be provided during the crucial first four weeks of the term will help new students navigate the Panorama campus and get to class on time. Thank you to Joseph Luiz of the Bakersfield Californian for helping share the news. You can read his story HERE!\n\n#2. An express bus service between our two campuses — one in the Southwest (Buena Vista and Stockdale) and the main campus on Panorama. The Express runs from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Thursday.\n\nThis week, I’ve been enjoying my rides to campus using the Express Bus service. Here I am leaving my home walking to Bakersfield College Southwest campus to catch the express bus. When I forwarded the photo to Monika so could upload it for me, she smiled and said, “Did you really walk from home?!”\n\nIf you look closely, I’ve still got my comfy walking moccasins on in the photo. The answer is yes! Although, I did change into my more formal shoes as soon as I boarded the shuttle. This week, I’ve enjoyed my morning walks to BC Southwest and I’ve enjoyed riding the Express bus too. It’s wonderful to have a little bit of extra time to brainstorm my day while on the way to BC Panorama while saving parking spots on the main campus for our students. Students come first! #WeAreBC\n\nNorma Rojas Mora on Telemundo — Todos Somos BC\n\nTelemundo hosts Norma Gaspar and Jose Gaspar spoke with Norma Rojas-Mora who shared information regarding the new shuttle services available to Bakersfield College students as well as the partnership with Kern Transit to provide free transportation to those students with a valid Bakersfield College I.D. The availability of the shuttles for students who may have obstacles getting to school and Bakersfield College’s efforts to set up students for success through these services were highlighted. The hosts recognized Bakersfield College’s efforts to help alleviate parking concerns for students and the surrounding community. Closing out the segment with our traditional call of “Todos Somos, Bakersfield College.”\n\nBC Southwest Tutoring Team\n\nThe BC Southwest Tutoring Center Team was also all hands on deck this week. Maria Wright visited them Wednesday morning and found they had a group of students already identified as “regulars.”\n\nThe enthusiasm of this team is incredible! The Center opened on Monday of this week and they have already done classroom presentations and have students coming in regularly to receive tutoring support in various subjects. #WeareBC and we support our students.\n\nCCCO IEPI Summer Budget Workshop\n\nThe Institutional Effectiveness Partnership Initiative (IEPI) Summer Budget Workshop presented by the College Finance & Facilities Division of the Chancellor’s Office was on Wednesday, August 15, 2018 in Newport Beach. Zach Quiroz, Budget Analyst, and Somaly Boles, Manager of Financial Information, joined other community college financial leaders across the state to learn of the new educational and fiscal policies California is using to shape the future of California institutions of higher learning. Here is a selfie they snapped with Chancellor Burke.\n\nClayton & Libby Rippey\n\nJerry Ludeke and the BC Archives team does an incredible job of keeping up to date with the most recent news of alumni, former employees and former faculty. It was shared this week that Clayton Rippey’s wife, Libby Hedden, has passed away. Clayton retired in 1980 with 31 years of service within the Kern Community College District. More recently, Clayton and Libby had been living (and both of them painting) in Las Vegas. The Bakersfield Californian spotlighted Clayton and his love of art in a 2016 article titled “Rippeys for sale: Art lovers get rare crack at trove of paintings.”\n\nWhile Clayton is a nationally recognized artist, we remember him on the BC faculty for 31 years teaching art and both designing and building the iconic Renegade knight mosaic that stands at the Haley-Panorama corner of campus. But, did you know he also created the color Porterville Pirate mosaic in 1960 in a nautical compass and pirate theme? Our well-loved and cherished Renegade mosaic is one of the most well known and iconic parts of Bakersfield.\n\nHave I told you recently that I’m the luckiest and happiest college president ever? It’s because each and every member of the BC community leaves a significant impression and a positive legacy on our campus, just like Clayton Rippey.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nRenegade Report\n\nThe Renegade Report is an online program from BC Athletics hosted by Ken Calvin, a former BC student athlete and football coach.

Attendees are encouraged to attend whenever they are able to throughout the day. The event is free and open to anyone who would like to participate.\n\nMath Hub is Open\n\nI was delighted this week to read an email that the Math Hub is open for the fall semester! You may not know this but the Math Hub is run on a drop in basis for all students! This means no appointments are necessary. The environment is conducive for independent studying and students are more than welcome to use the space to work on homework and ask questions. The Math Hub is located in MS 113 (next door to the Planetarium) and is a space where students can come and receive help in any BC math course, Pre-Algebra through Calculus, Statistics/Probability, and Psych B5. Every day the space is staffed with a professional math tutor and peer tutors.\n\nEmails Worth Sharing\n\nCarla Gard and I both received an email worth sharing this week from Abel Guzman who shared an experience that took place at the BC Delano campus. He said:\n\n“Yesterday morning we had a student on the Delano Campus who had a seizure in class. As I came into the class, the student was laying on his side with another student on her knees by his side. As we waited for paramedics to arrive the student helping kept checking on the other student. Once paramedics arrived, the helpful student took a sigh of relief and told me ‘Thank God for the BC CNA class that taught me how to handle this situation.’”\n\nKren Campbell, Bakersfield College’s CNA Director and Instructor, and her Clinical Teaching Assistants, Robert Vann, and Ashlyne Amanonce, are exemplary educators that collaborate efficiently to build incoming students into outstanding Nurse Assistants at the BC Main Campus and McFarland site. The instructors teach students a foundation that builds them into critical-thinking and caring CNAs. Upon completion of the course, and receiving their CNA certificate, most students are instilled with a desire for knowledge that they satiate by working towards and enrolling in the Vocational Nursing and Registered Nursing Programs at Bakersfield College. The community benefits from an increase in licensed healthcare workers, and this student’s action proves that further expanding the CNA Program in rural settings has a positive and amazing impact!\n\nDelano Chamber of Commerce\n\nThe Delano Chamber of Commerce recognized BC’s commitment to post secondary education alongside Assembly Member Rudy Salas on Thursday evening at the “Taste of Delano” Awards, Installation, and Membership Appreciation Mixer. I will cover this event next week when the photos come in.\n\nBC was in full force at the event, including Rich McCrow, Norma Rojas-Mora, Abel Guzman, Michele Bresso, Jaime Lopez, Rachel Lopez, and Juan Torres.\n\nIt’s a great time to be at BC!\n\nLisa Robles\n\nLisa Robles on BC’s Success and Equity team sent an email Friday morning sharing that she’d recently listed to a podcast featuring the California Community Colleges Chancellor, Eloy Oakley and Executive Director of California Completes, Lande Ajose. Lisa’s email says:\n\n“I was listening to this Podcast last night by Eloy Ortiz-Oakley, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and Lande Ajose, Executive Director of California Competes http://californiacompetes.org/ and I was struck at how much of this work BC is already doing. http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/Portals/0/AudioGallery/ccc18115.mp3\n\nDr. Ajose spoke about three areas of focus:\n\n1) Coordinating policy to ensure seamless transfer to 4-year schools\n\n2) Expanding our college entry points for returning students who got off path\n\n3) Comprehensive data system so we know how students are performing and identify gaps so we can get the students to completion\n\nIn listening to these points, I felt proud of the work we all do for our students. Some examples that jumped were BC’s Finish in 4 project with CSUB to support transfer, our massive expansion of the rural initiatives work, inmate education, and online education to open access points to campus, and how we’ve established the Office of Institutional Effectiveness and trained dozens of data coaches so we’re all better equipped to access and use data.\n\nAlthough we are making progress, there is still work to do to advance equity:\n\n47% of Latinos earn an Associates degree in 3 years and a Bachelors in 6 years compared to state average of 65%\n\n38% of African American students earn an Associates degree in 3 years and a Bachelors in 6 years compared to state average of 55%. http://californiacompetes.org/publications/opportunity-imbalance\n\nThe Office of Student Success & Equity is wholly focused on reducing inequities and supporting the Chancellor’s Vision for Success through our focus on the momentum points, the oversight of our affinity group Completion Coaching Communities, and by supporting the amazing work of the talented faculty and staff we have right here at BC.\n\nBefore I sign off, I want to say that BC is so fortunate to have folks like Abel Guzman and his team in Rural Initiatives reaching students who may never have made it to BC. And Dr. Parks, Julian West, and their team working towards the success of our African American students. Pedro Ramirez and Manuel Rosas working diligently with our undocumented Latino students. And so, so many more.\n\nThough the work in front of us is daunting, I feel more confident than ever that BC is not only up for the challenge, but that we are the best community college in the state with the best, most committed faculty and staff.\n\nHappy 2018-19 to all. I am looking forward to partnering with you to improve student completion and to build a more educated and sustainable community.\n\nWe Are BC!\n\nLisa\n\nIt’s Liz Rozell’s Birthday!\n\nOur Vice President of Instruction, Liz Rozell, celebrated her birthday a little early today with the President’s Office! Take a look at the festivities!\n\nBC SouthWest Buzzing!\n\nAfter years of service with Bakersfield College, most recently at the SW location, Officer Carlos Rios is moving on to another school district. Fernando Lara, BC’s administrator in charge of our Southwest Campus, describes Officer Rios as a dedicated, insightful, and intelligent officer. His presence will be missed at the SW location. Wish you the best, Officer Rios!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nParking Smart\n\nThe Testing and Placement Center accepted my challenge to Park Smart during the beginning of the semester! Thank you!\n\nThat’s all for now.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nWith much Renegade Pride and Collegiality.\n\nsonya —\n\nthe luckiest and happiest college president ever"
