        "text": "PEARSALL – When the Mavericks kick off against the Brahmas at Mack Laxson Field, there will be tension in the air as Pearsall looks to avenge last year’s disappointing loss to Stockdale.\n\nThe Pearsall football team hosts Stockdale for one last hurrah before its District 14-4A-DII schedule begins next week.\n\nEntering the Week 6 clash, the Mavericks are 4-1 to start the high school football season.\n\n“Definitely disappointed that it’s 4-1,” Pearsall senior fullback Orlando Selvera said. “I felt like we got robbed of one. But, at the end of the day, it was a battle. I feel like, as a team, that’s very good for us to be battle-tested at the end of the day. I (would) rather have that then have a blowout win.”\n\nPearsall’s one-point loss to Cole during week two of the high school football season left the Mavericks with a bitter feeling. But, as the saying goes, you learn more from your losses than wins.\n\n”We’re battle-tested, and we know how to get in close games, and we know what to do in close games, and we know how to perform in close games,” said Pearsall senior quarterback Elijah Luna.\n\nThe Mavericks are in for one more tough match-up before their district schedule begins. The last time Stockdale and Pearsall faced off, the Brahmas shut out the Mavericks to ruin their 5-0 start to the season.\n\n“Last year was definitely our best year in a while, and I felt like taking that loss,” Selvera said. “I know I cried that night, but it was definitely a learning lesson for all of us. After that, I feel like we were just locked in defensively (and) offensively. We couldn’t come out as weak as we did in those first two quarters, and I don’t feel like we ever have since then. We’ve given it all from (the) first quarter to (the) fourth quarter.“\n\nHead coach Ruben De Leon expects a challenge from this Stockdale team.\n\n”This is a caliber of opponent we’re going to see in the first round,” Pearsall football head coach Ruben De Leon said. “It’s going to be physical, as big as us, stronger than us, faster than us, it’s somebody that’ll get us ready for those opponents when we get into playoffs, which that’s our expectation to be in the playoffs because that’s our standard to get in the playoffs.”\n\nThe Mavericks and Brahmas kick off at 7 p.m."
