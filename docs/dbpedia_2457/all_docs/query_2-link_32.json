The benefits of gardening include producing homegrown vegetables that not only taste better, but are more nutritious.\n\nThe Wilson County News actually began the Wilson County Gardening Day at Calvin Finch's urging back in 2007. It was held Sunday, Feb. 11, in the parking lot of Richardson Bros Chevrolet! We chose the S.T.A.R.S program at the Floresville Alternative School as the beneficiary of the event. (S.T.A.R.S. was a very successful service-learning program that allowed participating students to learn about plants and actually to grow their own plants for sale.)\n\nSince that humble beginning, the show has grown and also evolved!\n\nFor the next couple of years, it was held in the parking lot of the Floresville High School administration office across from HEB (which is now the Corner Store), before eventually moving out to the Floresville Alternative School campus.\n\nIn its 11th year, it was expanded to a 2-day event and was moved to the Floresville Event Center. It eventually went back to a single day.\n\nIn 2021, the event was canceled because of the pandemic on what would have been the 15th annual event.\n\nIn 2022 the Wilson County News continued the show, going \"Back to Our Roots!\"\n\n2023 did not disappoint! The March 25, 2023 show continued a celebration of gardening!\n\nWe look forward to 2024's 17th annual show!
