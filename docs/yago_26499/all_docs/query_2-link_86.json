        "text": "I imagine the bride is related to Elisabeth von Pezold, an heiress of the house of Schwarzenberg?\n\nI was about ask this same thing too. You beat me to it. I should think so\n\nI imagine the bride is related to Elisabeth von Pezold, an heiress of the house of Schwarzenberg?\n\ndon't know but her mother is a born Countess zu Solms-Laubach and her grandmother is Princess Madeleine zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg\n\nThe bride might not have been titled but the family is clearly well connected among the German nobility. Her sister wore the same family tiara when she married a baron recently.\n\nSee royalwatchterblog: https://royalwatcherblog.com/2023/0...ce-ludwig-zu-lowenstein-wertheim-freudenberg/\n\nSome more information on the couple was included on Royal Musings at the time of their engagement in April last year: https://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2022/04/princely-engagement-zu-lowenstein.html\n\nThe bride might not have been titled but the family is clearly well connected among the German nobility. /\n\nExactly one of her aunts is Princess Maria zur Lippe and among the cousins of her mother is the Landgrave of Hesse and Prince Gustav zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg\n\nInteresting Tiara, looks like this one worn by the bride's ancestor Princess Elisabeth Helene: https://gw.geneanet.org/gpougnet?lang=fr&n=de+tour+et+taxis&oc=0&p=elisabeth+helene\n\nIt's strange, though, that this tiara hasn't been seen for many decades. The bride's mother Princess Gisela has been seen wearing a small ruby bandeau before.\n\nInteresting Tiara, looks like this one worn by the bride's ancestor Princess Elisabeth Helene: https://gw.geneanet.org/gpougnet?lang=fr&n=de+tour+et+taxis&oc=0&p=elisabeth+helene\n\nIt's strange, though, that this tiara hasn't been seen for many decades. The bride's mother Princess Gisela has been seen wearing a small ruby bandeau before.\n\nIndeed you are right this could be the tiara. I thought it looked not really old and historic and that it might be from the grooms Family.\n\nWonder why it hasn't been worn by Princess Gisela. But perhaps it is owned by the Dowager Margravine of Meissen.\n\nAt first, I also thought that the tiara had a contemporary look. But the pearls are somehow irregular, so they are probably old natural pearls and not modern cultured pearls. To me it looks like it's possible that the aquamarines and the pearls can be worn as separate necklaces.\n\nAnyway, it's exciting to see this heirloom tiara again, and I hope we'll see it on future brides.\n\nA pity we were not able to see more photos of the guests. I imagine there must have been quite a few members of the Bavarian RF present.\n\nA pity we were not able to see more photos of the guests. I imagine there must have been quite a few members of the Bavarian RF present.\n\nApparently there was quiet a Chaos before the Church with people storming the stairs leading into the Church so that the bride and her father had difficulties to come through and go into the Church-\n\nI imagine there are always quite a few tourists in Dresden. It has some wonderful buildings to visit. If I understood the words of Prince Alexander well, the wedding took place in the hofkirche?\n\nI imagine there are always quite a few tourists in Dresden. It has some wonderful buildings to visit. If I understood the words of Prince Alexander well, the wedding took place in the hofkirche?\n\nYes the Wedding was in the former Hofkirche which is now the Cathedral. Actually it is the only big catholic Church as most of the population of Saxony is protestant.\n\nYes there are always Tourists but if you look at pics here https://www.saechsische.de/dresden/dresden-hochzeit-wettin-5909437.html\n\nthere where masses of people. Apparently there had been no security measures\n\nApparently there was quiet a Chaos before the Church with people storming the stairs leading into the Church so that the bride and her father had difficulties to come through and go into the Church-\n\nAs Princess Maria's great-great-grandfather King Friedrich August once said the Saxons are a strange kind of republicans.\n\nAs Princess Maria's great-great-grandfather King Friedrich August once said the Saxons are a strange kind of republicans.\n\nYes he said on his way to a train station and I think he said deal with it yourselves."
