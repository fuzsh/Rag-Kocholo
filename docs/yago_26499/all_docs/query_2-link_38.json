        "text": "There has been a lot of work on the political history of Normandy in recent years, and this is changing understanding of the duchy's origins and development. Some of this work has examined the actions, relationships and settlement of the Vikings in the years prior to the 'treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte' and the inception of Normandy (traditionally dated to 911). The conditions that allowed the Vikings under Rollo to embed themselves in local society have been explored, and it has become clear that the Northmen were well-established in the region long before their settlement was officially recognized by Charles the Simple. The narrative sources which provide the foundation for any political history of Normandy, particularly Dudo of Saint-Quentin's Historia Normannorum or De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum, have also been the focus of a great deal of work. Dudo's intentions have been discussed at length, and while the provision of a historically accurate account was not among them, his work can now be used to suggest something of the ambitions of Duke Richard II and the concerns of those Franks who came into contact with him and his warriors. Until the 1970s, historians thought that Normandy was created swiftly and that it was unified from the outset. Now, a much more nuanced view is forming, which sees the establishment of Normandy as a slow process of confrontation and unification. Chance gave the dukes dominion over the Bretons and allowed them to take and hold the Avranchin. Elsewhere, the going was harder. Confrontation with the lords of Bellême and counts of Chartres led to stalemate. Within the frontiers thus established, the dukes had to fight to make their authority a reality and to weld Normandy into the unified family observed by Ralph Glaber in the later 1030s – although what Glaber did not know was that the duchy had still not taken its final form by that date.\n\nIn 966, by the end of the reign of its third duke, Richard I, Normandy had overcome the crises that had beset it in the middle of the century. Much of this success came from the coherence of its ruling group, which expressed itself partly in terms of ‘Norman’ identity. This article uses Dudo's history of the dukes and Richard's charters to argue that ‘Norman’ as a political identity was a deliberate creation of the court of Richard I in the 960s, following the perceived failure of his and his father's policies of assimilation into Frankish culture.\n\nDrawing on both written and archaeological evidence, this paper investigates the significance of the foreign, and in particular the concept of the ‘stranger- king’, in Viking Age Scandinavia. Focusing on the case of the Danish Jelling dynasty, the monumental complex at Jelling is reinterpreted as a material- ization of a stranger-king myth: the ship-setting reproduces the narrative of the founding of the dynasty by an immigrant forefather, and the earthen burial mounds convey the idea of the foreign king taking possession of the locals’ land. In a broader perspective, the stranger-king concept and the special association of the king with the foreign is identified as an integral element of Old Norse myth and a Scandinavian archetype of rulership. The embracing of the foreign in many different forms is seen as a political strategy whose aim is to illustrate a king’s special connection to the forces of the distant and unknown world beyond direct human control, and which clothes him with an aura of the strange and the exotic. In this way, and closely related to the concept of sacral rulership, the foreign emerges as a source of power and a presupposition for the formation of early states in Scandinavia."
