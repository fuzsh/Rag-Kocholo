        "text": "by Susan Flantzer © Unofficial Royalty 2019\n\nThe eldest surviving child of Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria and Elisabeth of Bavaria (Sisi), Archduchess Gisela was born in Laxenburg, Austria, the summer retreat of the Habsburgs, on July 12, 1856. The infant archduchess was baptized Gisella Luise Marie – Gisella with a double L – but she always wrote her name with only one L. Gisela had an older sister Sophie, born in 1855, and the birth of another girl was a disappointment to the family who was anxiously awaiting the birth of a boy to succeed to the throne.\n\nIn 1857, on a trip to Hungary, part of the Habsburg empire, Sophie and Gisela became ill with diarrhea and a very high fever. Gisela survived but Sophie died in her mother’s arms.\n\nGisela had three siblings:\n\nArchduchess Sophie (1855 – 1857), died in childhood\n\nCrown Prince Rudolf (1858 – 1889), married Princess Stéphanie of Belgium, had one daughter\n\nArchduchess Marie Valerie (1868 – 1924), married Archduke Franz Salvator, Prince of Tuscany, had ten children\n\nGisela was never close to her mother. Empress Elisabeth’s mother-in-law Archduchess Sophie, born Princess Sophie of Bavaria, was also Elisabeth’s aunt and deemed the teenage mother too young to care for her first two children. After their baptisms, Sophie and Gisela were taken away from their mother and raised by their grandmother.\n\nGisela was two years old when her brother Rudolf, the Crown Prince and heir to the throne, was born. Gisela had a close relationship with her brother even after she married and moved to Bavaria. She never got over Rudolf’s suicide. On January 30, 1889, at Mayerling, a hunting lodge in the Vienna Woods which Rudolf had purchased, in an apparent suicide plot, Rudolf shot his 17-year-old mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera, and then shot himself.\n\nIn April 1872, Gisela was betrothed to her second cousin Prince Leopold of Bavaria, son of Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria and Archduchess Augusta of Austria. Leopold’s father Prince Luitpold served as Prince Regent from 1886 until he died in 1912 due to the mental incompetence of his nephews King Ludwig II and King Otto. On April 20, 1873, 16-year-old Gisela and 27-year-old Leopold were married at the Augustinerkirche, the parish church of the Habsburgs, near Hofburg Palace in Vienna. The bride was overshadowed by her radiant and youthful-looking mother. Wedding festivities included a special performance of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream and a gala ball given by the city of Vienna at the Musikverein, a concert hall. Gisela was warmly welcomed by Leopold’s family in Munich. The couple had a happy marriage and lived in the Palais Leopold in the Schwabing section of Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, now in the German state of Bavaria.\n\nGisela and Leopold had four children:\n\nPrincess Elisabeth Marie of Bavaria (1874–1957), married Otto Ludwig Philipp, Graf von Seefried auf Buttenheim, had five children\n\nPrincess Auguste Maria of Bavaria (1875–1964), married Joseph August, Archduke of Austria, had six children\n\nPrince Georg of Bavaria (1880–1943), married Archduchess Isabella of Austria; in 1913, the marriage was dissolved by the Royal Bavarian Supreme Court and then was annulled by the Holy See of the Roman Catholic Church on the grounds of non-consummation, in 1921 Georg was ordained a Catholic priest\n\nPrince Konrad of Bavaria (1883–1969), married Princess Bona Margherita of Savoy-Genoa, had two children\n\nOn September 10, 1898, Gisela’s mother Empress Elisabeth was assassinated when she was stabbed in the heart by the Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni in Geneva, Switzerland. After her mother’s death, Gisela received 40% of her mother’s monetary assets and Achilleion Palace which her mother had built on the Greek island of Corfu to escape life at court.\n\nDuring World War I, Leopold was given the command of the German 9th Army and quickly proved himself to be an able commander. Gisela set up a military hospital in her Munich palace. Gisela’s father Emperor Franz Joseph died on November 21, 1916, in the middle of World War I, at the age of 86. As he had no son to succeed him, his great-nephew succeeded him as Emperor Karl I of Austria but only reigned for two years as the monarchy was abolished at the end of World War I.\n\nIn 1923, Gisela and Leopold celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Leopold died on September 28, 1930, at the age of 84. Two years later, Gisela died on July 27, 1932, aged 76. She was buried with her husband in the Wittelsbach crypt at St. Michael’s Church in Munich, Germany.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
