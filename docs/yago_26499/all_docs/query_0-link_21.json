        "text": "Monday July 30 was the funeral of Prince Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meisse, Duke of Saxony There have been reports that his brother, Prince Albert of Saxony, claimed the title of Margave of Meissen instead of Maria Emanuel’s designated heir, Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe. According to the report below there seems to be a reconciliation between the two men and another vacant title will not fall into dispute…hopefully.\n\nDresden – bells ringing on Monday at 15.40 clock on the Austrian Inn Valley. In the valley below the Alps, 2370 meters high summit Tschirgant a small funeral procession moved to the Royal Chapel of Wettin in Brennbichl .\n\nThe immediate family here was Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, Prince of Saxony, Duke of Saxony (86) carried to the grave. He would have been king, it would give the monarchy in the Free State still.\n\nAfter 44 years at the helm of the 1000 year old dynasty, he died eight days in his palace on Lake Geneva. His body was buried in a sealed zinc coffin, which covered an oak coffin.\n\nAt the grave grieving widow with Anastasia Louise (71) including the new Margrave Alexander Prince of Saxony (59) with wife Gisela (47) and four children.\n\nPreviously, it had come to a meeting in the chapel of the new Marquis of Albert Prince of Saxe (77). This arose in recent days claims to the chief post of Wettin. Prince Albert conciliatory: “I just want peace in the royal house!”\n\nhttp://www.bild.de/regional/chemnitz/chemnitz-regional/am-grab-des-sachsen-prinzen-25408164.bild.html\n\nHRH Prince Maximilian Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, head of the Royal House of Saxony died yesterday at the age of 86 at his Villa La Tour de Peilz at Genfer Lake.\n\nThe Margrave of Meissen was heir to the Kingdom of Saxony which was part of the German Empire. He succeeded his father, Hereditary Prince Frederick Christian of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen, to the headship of the Royal House in 1968. He was married to Princess Anastasia of Anhalt but since they had no children he chose as his heir Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe, who is the son of his eldest sister Princess Anna and her late husband Prince Robert of Gessaphe. Prince Alexander is married to Princess Gisela of Bavaria.\n\nThe Royal Saxon line was semi-Salic and allowed succession through the female line when the male line died out. However, the Margrave of Meissen does have a brother, Albert who married unequally, and this would bar him from the succession. The Margrave and Albert have a cousin, Timo, who married unequally but have male descendants.\n\nI would not be surprised to see the succession of Alexander challenged in the future."
