        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2016\n\nThe wife of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, Regent of Bavaria, Archduchess Auguste Ferdinande of Austria, Princess of Tuscany, was born in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, now in Italy, on April 1, 1825. She was the second of three daughters of Leopoldo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Princess Maria Anna of Saxony.\n\nAuguste had two sisters who both died before they were twenty:\n\nArchduchess Carolina Auguste (1822 – 1841), died in her teens\n\nArchduchess Maria Maximiliana (1827 – 1834), died in childhood\n\nAuguste’s mother died in 1832, and the following year her father married Princess Maria Antonietta of the Two Sicilies.\n\nAuguste had ten half-siblings from her father’s second marriage:\n\nArchduchess Maria Isabella (1834 – 1901), married her maternal uncle Prince Francesco, Count of Trapani, had six children\n\nFerdinando IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1835 – 1908), married (1) Princess Anna of Saxony, had one daughter (2) Princess Alice of Bourbon-Parma, had ten children\n\nArchduchess Maria Theresia (1836 – 1838), died in childhood\n\nArchduchess Maria Christina (1838 – 1849), died in childhood\n\nArchduke Karl Salvator of Austria (1839 – 1892), married Princess Maria Immaculata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, had ten children\n\nArchduchess Maria Anna (1840 – 1841), died in infancy\n\nArchduke Raineri Salvatore (1842 – 1844), died in childhood\n\nArchduchess Maria Luisa (1845 – 1917), married Karl, Prince of Isenburg-Büdingen, had nine children\n\nArchduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria (1847 – 1915), unmarried\n\nArchduke Johann Salvator of Austria (1852 – 1890), unmarried, lost at sea in 1890, officially declared dead in 1911\n\nAuguste was a very intelligent child, interested in the arts and science from a young age. Raised in a strict Catholic background, it was expected that she would marry into one of the Catholic ruling families in Europe. This came to be on April 15, 1844, in Florence, when she married Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, a younger son of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The King had initially opposed the marriage, as Auguste was already showing signs of pulmonary tuberculosis which would later take her life. However, he soon relented and allowed the couple to marry.\n\nOver the next eight years, they had four children:\n\nKing Ludwig III of Bavaria (1845 – 1921) – married Archduchess Maria Theresia of Austria-Este, had thirteen children\n\nPrince Leopold (1846 – 1932) – married Archduchess Gisela of Austria, had four children\n\nPrincess Therese (1850 – 1925) – unmarried\n\nPrince Arnulf (1852 – 1907) – married Princess Therese of Liechtenstein, had one son\n\nBecause of her health, Auguste had difficulty adjusting to the Bavarian climate. A few years after marrying, she and her husband built a home on Lake Constance, which they used as a summer residence. She was a devoted mother to her four children, speaking to them only in Italian, and a strong supporter of her husband and the Bavarian monarchy. In 1848, she publicly criticized her father-in-law, King Ludwig I, for his relationship with his mistress Lola Montez, and its negative effects on the monarchy. King Ludwig I soon abdicated, and Auguste made many public appearances encouraging support for her brother-in-law, the new King Maximilian II.\n\nSadly, on April 26, 1864, Princess Auguste died, aged 39, in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, now in the German state of Bavaria, from the effects of tuberculosis she had suffered for many years. She is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich.\n\nYears later, her husband would be named Prince Regent of Bavaria, due to the mental incapacity of his two nephews, King Ludwig II and King Otto. Following Luitpold’s death, the couple’s son Ludwig assumed the regency and eventually, formally deposed his cousin King Otto, taking the throne himself as King Ludwig III.\n\nBavaria Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\nKingdom of Bavaria Index\n\nBavarian Royal Dates\n\nProfiles: Bavarian Rulers and Consorts\n\nRoyal Burial Sites of the Kingdom of Bavaria\n\nRulers of Bavaria"
