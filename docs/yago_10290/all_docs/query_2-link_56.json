        "text": "ANNIE HALL (Woody Allen, 1977)\n\nConey Island Beach\n\nBoardwalk at West 12th St.\n\nMonday, August 8, free, 7:00\n\nwww.epixhd.com\n\nOne of the funniest, most-quoted romantic comedies in film history, Woody Allen’s Annie Hall is a pure delight from start to finish. It’s ostensibly a luuuuuurve story about a nebbishy Jew (Allen as Alvy Singer) and the ultimate WASPy goy (Diane Keaton as the title character), but it’s really about so much more: large vibrating eggs, right turns on red lights, television, Existential Motifs in Russian Literature, California, slippery crustaceans, driving through Plutonium, dead sharks, Freud, Hitler, Leopold and Loeb, religion, cocaine, Shakespeare in the Park, Buick-size spiders, planet Earth, and, well, la-di-da, la-di-da, la la. One of the all-time great New York City movies, it’s partly set in Coney Island, where Alvy grew up under the old Thunderbolt roller coaster. Tonight, Epix, in conjunction with Rooftop Films, will be screening the multiple Oscar winner — for Best Original Screenplay (Allen and Marshall Brickman), Best Director (Allen), Best Actress (Keaton), and Best Film — not far from that site, on the boardwalk by West 12th St. It will be preceded by a live DJ at 7:00, followed by Kirsten Lepore’s charming beach-set short, Bottle, and, yes, a Woody Allen impersonation contest. You know you so want to participate. Which section would you quote from? We’re still deciding which scene is our favorite…."
