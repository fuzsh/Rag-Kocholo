        "text": "Marshall Brickman says that he is ''ambivalent about gadgets.'' He says this while sitting in an office on Central Park South surrounded by word processing and stereo gear, a copying machine, an electric piano and an air-conditioner apparently set at ''arctic.'' The sheet music on the electric piano is Bach's Six English Suites. A moment before proclaiming his ambivalence about gadgets he had announced, ''I'm a clean copy freak,'' while excitedly paging through a thick instruction manual for a computer program called Scriptor that ''sits on top of your word processing program and reformats your screenplay automatically.'' A moment after proclaiming his ambivalence toward gadgets he announces: ''If I weren't a film maker I'd probably be a handyman.''\n\nThe most recent screenplay that Scriptor helped Mr. Brickman format was ''The Manhattan Project,'' the newly-opened comedy about a bright kid with a knack for gadgets who puts together a homemade atom bomb. Like much of Mr. Brickman's work for the screen (the three movies he co-wrote with Woody Allen - ''Sleeper,'' ''Annie Hall,'' ''Manhattan'' -and the two previous movies he wrote and directed without Woody Allen -''Simon'' and ''Lovesick''), ''The Manhattan Project'' teems with ambivalence. The 46-year-old Mr. Brickman is too much a man of his time not to love the toys that modern science provides and too intelligent not to be terrified of their ''downside'' potential -such as the possibility that we will blow ourselves up with them, making it unlikely that anyone will get to hear Bach's Six English Suites again.\n\nBach is one of Mr. Brickman's heroes along with Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick and Freeman Dyson, the physicist who once worked on a project to blast a spaceship into orbit by exploding atom bombs under it and who is now an advocate of nuclear disarmament. ''Bach had to write a cantata every Sunday, rain or shine. He also went around Europe consulting on the mechanics of organs.''\n\nIt's hard to tell whether Woody Allen is one of Marshall Brickman's heroes or just a good friend and a former (and possibly future) collaborator. Mr. Brickman says of their collaborations that ''it wasn't like working.'' But it must not be easy for him to hear people praising the films they wrote together as ''Woody Allen's films.'' There have even been times - before he struck out on his own -when people wondered aloud if there was a ''Marshall Brickman'' or whether the name listed on the credits was one Mr. Allen's in-jokes.\n\nA glance at the biographies of the two men only compounds the confusion. Like Woody Allen, Marshall Brickman grew up Jewish in Brooklyn, showed a talent for humor at an early age (''I was prone to funny hats and irony''), and went on to write jokes for big-time television (Mr. Brickman was head writer for Johnny Carson's ''Tonight'' show at the age of 27) before turning to the movies. Both men have also written humor pieces for The New Yorker, and are talented musicians.\n\nThere are differences, of course, Woody Allen dropped out of college, whereas Marshall Brickman got degrees in science and music from the University of Wisconsin (''two worthless pieces of paper instead of one''). Also, Woody Allen has been called ''the world's most unmarried bachelor,'' whereas Marshall Brickman is not only married and has two daughters, 6-year-old Jessica and 2-year-old Sophie, but his wife and collaborator, the film editor Nina Feinberg, edited ''The Manhattan Project'' in the living room of their apartment on Central Park West. ''We cleared out the furniture and moved in a Steenbeck and a Moviola, so Nina could work at home. We use the Italian rather than the English approach to bringing up kids - treat them like everyone else only shorter. Sophie's first word was 'rewind.'
