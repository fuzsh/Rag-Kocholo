        "text": "Given that Annie Hall is all about Alvy trying to figure out why Annie's the one who got away, it's fitting that the film is named after her. We're not going to say he's obsessed with her, but without Annie Hall, there's no Annie Hall. She fuels the film's entire plot.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the name \"Annie Hall\" itself came from Diane Keaton, the actress who portrays her. Keaton's real last name is Hall and, back in the day, she sometimes went by \"Annie.\""
