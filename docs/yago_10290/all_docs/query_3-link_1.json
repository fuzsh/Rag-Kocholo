        "text": "More than just discussing work, it's essential to embrace conversations about the leisure time we spend outside of it. Today, I'm excited to share my thoughts on Oppenheimer, a film that left a profound impact on me.\n\nAlthough I frequently share the films I watch at the cinema on social media, I rarely express my personal opinions on them. However, I find myself compelled to talk about my thoughts on Oppenheimer; I haven’t seen a movie this exceptional since 2014.\n\nAs many who know me are aware, I'm an enormous fan of Christopher Nolan's work and a devoted lover of Interstellar. I've proclaimed it has my favorite movie and vowed countless times that no other movie would ever dethrone it from its place. Nevertheless, I am beginning to question if Oppenheimer might soon occupy that spot; it's still too early to say.\n\nDespite using a subjective lens, Oppenheimer masterfully portrays the story of the father of the atomic bomb, drawing significant inspiration from the biography American Prometheus. The movie strikingly captures the nuances and complexity of the bomb’s development, which would ultimately fall upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki and eventually serves as reminder of the heinous decision made by the United States of America.\n\nWhile the film presents the gravity of this decision, it subtly prompts us to contemplate an alternative perspective. With the passage of time, it leaves us pondering whether the deployment of the bomb was indeed an imperative necessity or whether the attack was reflected of a futile and virile intent of demonstrating American strength and hegemony.\n\nOppenheimer delves beyond the mere creation of the atomic bomb. With masterful execution, it skillfully crafts a captivating and temporally specific portrait of Robert Oppenheimer. While the discovery of the atomic bomb remains a central theme, the movie goes beyond historical events and confronts the ethical and moral dilemma entwined with the use of the atomic bomb. The devastating consequences of the bomb, evident in Japan, lend a concrete and harrowing backdrop to this critical exploration.\n\nIn this context, it is absolutely essential to praise Cillian Murphy’s phenomenal work as Robert Oppenheimer. He impressively brings to life the burden that Oppenheimer carried, vividly portraying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nThe three hours of the film flew by effortlessly. The exceptional performances and dialogues, gripping screenplay, brilliant Nolan’s subjectivity, stunning aesthetics and photographic techniques created an unforgettable cinematic journey that I wholeheartedly recommend to everyone. It is a true homage to the art of cinema, exemplifying how a movie can profoundly impact the human sensory experience.\n\nSaving the best for last, Ludwig Göransson's masterful work on the soundtrack is truly extraordinary, leading and transcending us to an uncharted dimension of cinematic brilliance. The melodies and compositions achieve the delicate balance between sobriety and electrifying intensity. Tracks like Destroyer of Worlds, American Prometheus, Los Alamos and Can You Hear The Music are enchanting and takes us on a magical ride forming the very heart of Oppenheimer, leaving an indelible mark on the film, much like how Cornfield Chase did for Interstellar. There aren’t enough words to describe the profound impact of Göransson's musical genius on the film. It harmoniously dances with the narrative, fueling and guiding every pulse, elevating the film’s complexity to unparalleled heights.\n\nAmidst this extraordinary cinematic journey, Oppenheimer transcends its historical context, resonating profoundly in the present. The themes explored in the film resonate with the complexities of our modern world, making it a potent allegory for contemporary dilemmas. As we immerse ourselves in Oppenheimer's tale, the haunting relevance of the Manhattan Project echoes in today's global landscape. The film serves as a stark reminder of humanity's capacity for destruction and the repercussions of wielding such immense power.\n\nIn an era where the world grapples with its past and confronts its future, Oppenheimer invites us to examine the consequences of our decisions. The specter of war looms over us, and the film serves as a timely reflection on the importance of learning from history's lessons. We’ve never been so close to becoming echoes of our own past; the resonances with history are not in vain. As we witness Oppenheimer's journey, we are urged to consider the cost of power and the necessity of ethical responsibility in the face of scientific innovation. At the of the day, we will all be judged by history.\n\nUltimately, Oppenheimer is a testament to the enduring power of cinema as an art form that captures not just historical events but also the complexities of the human spirit. It challenges us to confront our past, our present, and our potential future with unyielding introspection. As we immerse ourselves in this cinematic masterpiece, we emerge with a profound appreciation for the impact of storytelling on our collective consciousness."
