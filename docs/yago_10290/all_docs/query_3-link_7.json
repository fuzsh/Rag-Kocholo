        "text": "StatGuy2000 said:\n\nHi everyone! As I'm sure many of you here on PF know, the latest Christopher Nolan film, \"Oppenheimer\" -- about the life of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, focusing on his role on the Manhattan Project, and based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"American Prometheus\" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin -- is now in theatres.\n\nHas anyone here on PF seen the film? If so, what are your thoughts on the film? And has any of you read the original source book on which this film is based on?\n\nLooking forward to seeing it. I have seen a couple of films regarding the Manhattan project, neither particularly amazing from memory.\n\nEdit, \"Infinity\" and \"Fat man little boy.\"\n\nFat man little boy featured the demon core incidents (actually one incident in the film) although they occured after the bombs were dropped.\n\nInfinity was about Richard Feynman.\n\nProbably featured in \"The World at war\" series 1973 but that was mainly about dropping the bomb and the aftermath.\n\nAs I mentioned in an earlier post, I have seen the first 5 episodes of the 7-episode 1980 BBC version of Oppenheimer - each episode was about 1 hour in length. That got me up to Trinity/Hiroshima/Nagasaki.\n\nI have just seen the film.\n\nAlthough Trinity/Hiroshima/Nagasaki is mentioned as the \"climax\" to this new 2023 movie, it actually happens at about the 2 hour mark. So both series put it at about the same point (5/7 vs. 2/3).\n\nIn both cases, significant the pre-T/H/N screen time is spent on the post-T/H/N drama where Opp. ultimately looses his clearance.\n\nIn this 2023 movie, the last hour was spent first dramatically exploring the case against Opp - with about 40 minutes spent on what I would call tedious \"gossip\" and the last 20 minutes dramatically rescuing that previous 40 minutes. But I am far from a typical viewer, so YMMV.\n\nIt is remarkable that two films about the same relatively narrow topic can be such different creations. The 1980 version showed considerable narrative skill - making a story entertaining. The 2023 version shows remarkable narrative art - imprecise use of story elements for artistic affect.\n\nFor example, both invoked the issue of possible atmospheric ignition. The 1980 version used it to show how Opp dealt with the issue. In the 2023 version, the \"emotional thesis\" shifts several times during the movie and it used ignition more often and far less precisely as a tool to assist in aligning audience emotion to the current thesis.\n\nAn example of how the story can be different is the spin applied to ETA of the Trinity event. The 1980's film starts with optimistic ETA dates and works forward. The 2023's version starts with an October estimate and pulls it back early enough to precede the Potsdam meeting.\n\nFrom a Physics point of view, there is a bit more Physics in 1980 version that in the 2023 version. But there was a scene in the 2023 film where information about the Nazi work including heavy water is reviewed to conclude that the Nazis have taken a \"wrong turn\" on the path to a bomb. I expect the average viewer with little knowledge of fission would translate the scene into \"blah blah blah, the Nazis aren't making bomb progress\".\n\nThe 2023 movie earns its \"R\" rating from a few quick nude scenes. They are clearly put in there for that purpose and to dodge a nerdy reputation as best as possible. Before seeing the movie, I had presumed that the controversial inclusion of a reference to the Bhagavad Gita in a sex scene was an unintentional foobar. Having now seen the movie, it was clearly intended to cause the controversy. It would be very hard to argue that it serves any other narrative purpose.\n\nI think both movies are good. If I was only allowed to see one, I would pick the 1980 version.\n\nSagittarius A-Star said:\n\nIn one scene of the film, the American flag has 50 stars, although it had only 48 stars in 1945.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/24/entertainment/oppenheimer-flag-mistake-intl-scli/index.html\n\nI read your post and looked at the screen shot before seeing the movie - but still didn't notice.\n\nThere is one mistake that I noticed - but I am not sure anyone else would. It occurred hours (or perhaps a day) after the Trinity explosion. He walks into a crowd of cheering engineers in the open skies of Los Alamos. If you would rather focus on the story content and not the technicalities, don't open this spoiler.\n\nThe crowd noise does not match the setting or the crowd. The noise is what you would hear from an indoor setting with sound reflected from the walls and ceiling - not from an outdoor, open-skies crowd.\n\nI am sure I notice different things than most."
