The plot makes no sense whatsoever and I think the script is garbage but the whole cast (especially Harvey Keitel and Willem Dafoe) are so so so into it like they really are trying their hardest here with a script that makes no sense and is also absolutely horrible. There's a part where Willem Dafoe has Harvey Keitel kidnapped and is interrogating him and literally all Willem Dafoe is doing is saying shit like \"you and your brother are related\" and Harvey Keitel freaks the fuck out and it's not even like an over the top freak out it's genuinely subtle it's genuinely good acting it's a genuine convincing reaction to Willem Dafoe saying…\n\nthe masculine urge to sit on the floor, lay waste to a sleeve of saltine crackers, and wail\n\nhadn't watched a harvey keitel flick in like 3 or 4 months and was starting to feel not quite myself because of it so i decided to return to my roots. WHAT a movie to pick as my homecoming. i've watched some garbage for this man but this was cringe-worthy in some all new ways. those comparing it to the room aren't far off\n\npaul auster is a terrorist for writing this at all, let alone making such a talented cast of people embarrass themselves by trying to salvage it. willem dafoe's scenes were the only ones that were watchable to me…\n\nI suspect that like most people who chose to watch writer/director Paul Auster’s first solo outing as a director (he had a co-directing credit with Wayne Wang on 1995’s Blue in the Face), the drawcard was the top notch cast that he was working with here. The IMDb synopsis was also intriguing: “A famous jazz saxophonist’s life is forever changed after he is accidentally shot”. Unfortunately, this one ends up very high on my “Directors who squandered a great cast” list and, as is almost always the case, the insurmountable problem is the screenplay.\n\nAuster had made a splash and picked up a couple of awards with his first original screenplay, for Wayne Wang’s Smoke (1995), and his experience with the…\n\nscavenger hunt 99: a movie starring an actor whose filmography you want to explore more (harvey keitel).\n\nObscure 80s/90s Films Binge #137\n\nIn this movie, Harvey Keitel tells Willem Dafoe that he stopped liking movies after Gene Kelly died and then Dafoe does a short rendition of Singin' in the Rain. It genuinely cannot get better than that.\n\nThis movie is insane and I am obsessed with it. I'm not sure why my niche is just really strange '90s movies where the plot makes no sense and the script is garbage - but here we are. Maybe I just admire films that don't try to be logical and therefore are fun.\n\nEveryone in this movie was trying so hard to…"
