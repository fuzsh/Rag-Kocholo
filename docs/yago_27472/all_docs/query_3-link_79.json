        "text": "St Petersburg, FL, July 08, 2010 --(PR.com)-- Meet Me at the Rainbow Bridge is Kenneth Newman's self published memoir, now available on lulu.com, relating the important role that dogs have played throughout his life. It is furthermore an appeal to the hearts and minds of pet lovers that the legal status of pets must be elevated above the level of property that they are granted in our legal system. The owner of a dog that is negligently killed cannot receive a penny for loss of companionship or pain and suffering.\n\nReturning home from a family vacation, Dr. Newman and his beloved Labrador Retriever, Gracie, are crushed between the rear of his car and a vehicle driven by a lady who backed up 25 yards without looking. Dr. Newman's leg was crushed, but Gracie was killed in the accident.\n\n\"I was far more upset that Gracie died than the fact that my leg was broken,\" says Dr. Newman.\n\nDr. Newman narrates his life story in retrospect. His dogs have always been family members like 90% of pet owners that consider their pets to be their children.\n\n\"I knew I had to do something when the insurance company attorney looked me in the eye and told me that my case was a simple broken leg case. Gracie was just a dog. The emotional loss of a dog must be recognized and compensated by our courts,\" states Dr. Newman. Dr. Newman plans to work to elevate the legal status of pets.\n\nThis book is a must read for anyone who has ever loved and lost a beloved pet.\n\nPlease go to Meetmeattherainbowbridge.com for more information about Dr. Newman and his book.\n\n###"
