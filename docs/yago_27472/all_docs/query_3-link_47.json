My software manual has been revised multiple times since first published (latest revision last week) and I'm sure that Lulu used to show the latest revision date. Now it doesn't, viz. www.lulu.com/content/2374396 , 'Publication Date\n\n4/25/2008' [first edition date]. Most people aren't going to order a 12 year old software manual! Am I missing something?\n\nYou are missing nothing. Log in and revise. Make it explicit in your description this is an updated version as of a specific date. You will have to change the cover according to a new one piece template.\n\nPost by JesusNinja on\n\nIf lulu isn't going to have an actual forum on their website, they at least owe it to their customers to provide a link here. That way at least people might get help or answers. They aren't getting it from Lulu anymore. tonyb if I were you I'd check all of your books to see if they are the latest edition. If not do as Maggie said and revise it and fix the cover to work with the latest template. If you need help with that come back here and we will be glad to help you. Just to add when I sent out my latest book lulu sent out the old version. I had checked it after I published and noticed that some photos did not come out right. So immediately fixed that and republished. Of course lulu sent the wrong one and now it sits on Amazon looking like crap. I emailed them weeks ago and nothing has changed.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIf lulu isn't going to have an actual forum on their website, they at least owe it to their customers to provide a link here.

But I actually think users would be less angry, motivated to publish more. A feeling of community gets the creative juices flowing.\n\nPost by tonyb on\n\nIf lulu isn't going to have an actual forum on their website, they at least owe it to their customers to provide a link here.

I posted a revision a few weeks back and as usual ordered a proof copy. It came back as a 2019 edition and I assumed that it was my error in managing not to commit the latest revision. I repeated the process just before my first post and am waiting for another proof copy, but given that I changed the content and not the cover, if it comes back wrong again I'll know why.\n\nPost by JesusNinja on\n\nIf lulu isn't going to have an actual forum on their website, they at least owe it to their customers to provide a link here.

I had ordered a proof I had just fixed during the \"two day update\" and they sent the old one. So I had to order a new one. To Lulu's credit they refund my money on the first one. If I were you I'd tell them you revised the book and they printed the wrong revision and remind them there is no option to delete the old now. Lulu used to be very good. Good support request responses, timely shipping etc. I did notice there is a retire option there. But I don't know if it's for each revision or the entire book. I'm actually afraid to touch anything now.\n\nPost by Retread-Retired-Cameron on\n\nThanks for this. I posted a revision a few weeks back and as usual ordered a proof copy.
