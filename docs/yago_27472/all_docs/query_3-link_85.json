        "text": "Fun. Food. Music.\n\nLucy Buffett had never run a restaurant before she opened the original LuLu’s at the Fish River Bridge on Highway 98, where Weeks Bay meets Fish River. She had a gift, though – actually, more than just one gift. She had a gift for hard work and hospitality, a way with food, and an ability to bring out the best in people. “Even then, in our little place with barely a hundred seats, we began to have a following, to develop an identity,” Lucy says. “We were just a bunch of river rats – the staff and the customers alike – but we grew into a family, a culture.”\n\nLocations in Destin and North Myrtle Beach, SC followed. “We have been able to keep the brand, the culture, intact. Each location has its unique aspects, but they are all on the same page about the food, the atmosphere, the ambiance,” says Lucy. “We even have the same music playlist for each day at all of the locations. The music changes by the season, but you can go into any location and know that the same music is playing in the other two!”\n\nIt came a piece at a time, a step at a time. There is still a vision for the future, room for more growth – but there is nothing on the drawing board right this minute. It is bigger than I envisioned, but I never limited what we could do, the potential for growth. I’m happy with what we have done, and I plan to keep going.\n\nSome of Lucy’s Favorite Things\n\nNoon Years Eve Celebration: “We open at 10:00 am on New Year’s Eve,” says Lucy. “We count down at noon. There are hundreds of beach balls that drop from the rafters; there is bubble wrap all over for jumping on and popping – this is our safe fireworks! It’s the most fun family event ever! We will have 1,500 to 2,000 people for this celebration, and then we close at 3:00 p.m. and we’re all off the next day!”\n\nLuLu’s Allergy (free) Menu: “We are so proud of what we have been able to accomplish in order to provide a safe and delicious dining experience for guests with allergies or food sensitivities,” says Lucy. “We have developed a system that really works. When a guest tells the server that there is an allergy issue, a manager takes over and takes the order. The food is prepared in an entirely separate kitchen and is delivered by the same manager. We are able to accommodate all sorts of food issues, and it makes us happy to serve guests who can be confident they are getting a specially prepared meal.”\n\nLuLu’s Coolest Technology: “We are so pleased to use DineTime’s GET IN LINE service to assist in keeping our guests’ wait time to a minimum. Guests can Beat the Wait by accessing this feature on our website and get on the list before they start out. It’s not a reservation, but it sure beats a really long wait!”\n\nLucy’s Biggest Challenge: “I think our biggest challenge is keeping the family feeling, the culture we have built while wearing a lot of hats and staying open to growth and new opportunities. I’m proud that we have been able to accomplish this.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY CHANDLER WILLIAMS\n\n& PASCHEN FRUIT PHOTOGRAPHY"
