        "text": "by Stephen Garrett\n\n“Lulu on the Bridge” is Paul Auster’s directing debut, although 1993’s “The Music\n\nof Chance” was his first script for the screen; and his following experiences\n\ncollaborating with director Wayne Wang on 1995’s “Smoke” and “Blue in the Face“\n\nwas, he felt, his own film school, during which he learned everything about\n\nthe craft that made it possible to undertake his first directing job alone.\n\nIn the film, Harvey Keitel is a jazz saxophonist crippled by a random gunshot\n\nthat leaves him unable to make music anymore. As he recuperates and finds a\n\nnew balance in life, random and magical circumstances lead to his meeting and\n\nfalling in love with an aspiring actress played by Mira Sorvino, who falls\n\nequally head over heels. More than anything, Lulu is about true love and the\n\npitfalls that sometimes come between fated lovers. Mixing fantasy with\n\nreality, and injected with a hefty dose of romance, American critics have\n\ngiven Lulu a mixed reception here at Cannes, which possibly has served as more\n\nof a reflection on cultural tastes than on the merit of Auster’s aspirations.\n\nindieWIRE: “Lulu” has certain references to other films, like “Pandora’s Box” and\n\n“Singin’ in the Rain”. Why did you decide to make these allusions?\n\nPaul Auster: Oh, you know, these things just develop, they just organically\n\nstart coming together. I love “Singin’ in the Rain” — I really do think what\n\n[Willam Dafoe’s character] says in the movie is true — it really is about\n\nlaughing your way through adversity. It’s so deeply American. I really\n\nbelieve it’s a great American contribution to the world.\n\niW: So then your film shares that same sense of being light-hearted in the\n\nface of despair?\n\nAuster: Definitely. Not to be light-hearted, but to overcome everything, rather\n\nthan be crushed by it. Stanley Donen, the director of “Singin’ in the Rain”,\n\nwas going to be in the film, but then he got sick and couldn’t do it. He was\n\ngoing to play that walk-on part that David Byrne did — I don’t know if you\n\nnoticed — in the pie-in-the-face scene. David Byrne is Mira’s date at the\n\ntable.\n\niW: How did the cast come together?\n\nAuster: I wanted all the people that are in the film, and I asked them. Many of\n\nthem I knew — that was my casting technique.\n\niW: So you have your dream cast?\n\nAuster: I do. If you notice, when Mira walks into her bedroom and plays her\n\ntelephone message, the agent was played by Stockard Channing.\n\niW: You were here last year as a member of the Cannes jury. What’s it like to\n\nbe here now as a director?\n\nAuster: It’s as if I’m in two different places. The palm trees look the same, but\n\neverything else is different.\n\niW: Are you a little more nervous?\n\nAuster: Yeah, you bet.\n\niW: The film has sold so far in most major territories, including Canada, but\n\nnot America. Why is that?"
