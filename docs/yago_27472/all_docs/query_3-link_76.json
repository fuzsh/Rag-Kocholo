        "text": "Albert Lewin, a well-known Hollywood cinema director who is significantly influenced by the surrealistic movement, brings together the myth f Pandora and the legend of the flying Dutchman in order to create an exemplary love story, a crazy love story which goes beyond the limits of human reason. Bearing in mind, then, that if one wants to believe in this sort of love story must not be guided by human reason stricto sensu, he builds a world of signs, a semiologic world which this article aims at helping to interpret.\n\nSince its 2015 debut, Alex Garland's Ex Machina has been conceptualized as a creation myth, as a succession myth, as the Pygmalion myth and as the Pandora myth, among others-each of these argumentations acknowledging the permeability between different interpretations. The author argues that Ex Machina recodes the myth of Pandora and creates a fertile ground to display cultural traumas that have been affecting women-such as female subordination and oppression caused by a patriarchal structure and stereotypical binary oppositions. Thus, Garland's film also suggests that the old forms of female oppression might be reaffirmed in the context of the age of technological innovation.\n\nDomestic violence against women has been a serious social and public health problem faced by contemporary society. This type of violence has grown in recent years, placing the woman not only as a victim of the aggressor but also of a sexist culture established over time. One of the ways to combat this problem is through prevention based on learning and awareness of its causes and damages. The use of 360-degree videos and immersive virtual reality (IVR) combined with serious games (SG) is a promising field of research in the educational field. They have the potential to provide more realistic and engaging environments, enhancing the engagement of their users, thus favoring more learning opportunities. This study presents The Mystery of Pandora, a SG that uses IVR and 360-degree videos to promote knowledge about domestic violence against women (DVAW). The game assessment results suggest a pedagogical potential for promoting knowledge DVAW. In addition, this work brings discussions abo...\n\nThis article examines the relationship between Hesiod and Empedocles through a comparative analysis of the Prometheus and Pandora myth and the Queen Cypris narrative. The author sustains that correspondences between the works of Hesiod and Empedocles can be interpreted through the framework of overlapping narrative structures, which would help to establish the order of the fragments. The relationship between Empedocles and Hesiod is polemic due to the fact that they belong to rival schools of wisdom. In the case of Empedocles, that school emanated from the Sanctuary of Apollo in Delphi.\n\nWhale Rider represents a particular type of mythic film that includes within it references to an ancient sacred story and is itself a contemporary recapitulation of it. The movie also belongs to a further subcategory of mythic cinema, using the double citation of the myth—in its original form and its re-enactment—to critique the subordinate position of women to men in the narrated world. To do this, the myth is extended beyond its traditional scope and context. After looking at how the movie embeds the story and recapitulates it, this paper examines the film’s reception. To consider the variety of positions taken by critics, it then analyses the traditional myth as well as how the book first worked with it. The conclusion is, in distinction to the book, that the film drives a wedge between the myth’s original sacred function to provide meaning in the world for the Maori people and its extended intention to empower women, favoring the latter at the former’s expense."
