Since his election to the Dáil, he has consistently held the Government to account over their failure to deal with record levels of rents, record levels of homelessness, and the record numbers of people in their twenties and thirties still living in their childhood bedrooms.\n\nCian has used his time in the Dáil to present practical solutions to the housing crisis. He has put forward motions with constructive proposals on tackling vacancy and increasing homeownership. He has also introduced bills to put a stop to land speculation, increase the delivery of social and affordable homes, ban exploitative sex for rent practices and give greater protections to renters.\n\nCian is proud to represent the people of Dublin Bay North who have put their trust in him to fight for a better and fairer society.\n\nWe do not have time for any more excuses or promises. The status quo is not working. We need a radical change of direction. We need to build homes where children can grow up and people can grow old. Communities that will thrive and not just survive.\n\nCian’s Priorities"
