        "text": "The lower house of the Oireachtas (Irish parliament), Dáil Éireann, contains 166 Teachtaí Dála (TDs), representing 43 parliamentary constituencies throughout the Republic of Ireland. Depending on its size, each constituency must have at least 3 members and a maximum of five members. The most recent (Census 2006)[1] ratio indicates that there is one TD for every 25,512 people. Elections are held using the single transferable vote form of proportional representation.\n\nContents\n\n1 Current constituencies\n\n2 2011 general election\n\n3 Historic changes\n\n3.1 2007 general election\n\n3.2 2002 general election\n\n3.3 1997 general election\n\n3.4 1992 general election\n\n4 External links\n\n5 References\n\nCurrent constituencies\n\nFor the 2011 general election Teachtaí Dála were elected for the following constituencies:\n\nConstituency Seats Carlow–Kilkenny 5 Cavan–Monaghan 5 Clare 4 Cork East 4 Cork North–Central 4 Cork North–West 3 Cork South–Central 5 Cork South–West 3 Donegal North–East 3 Donegal South–West 3 Dublin Central 4 Dublin Mid–West 4 Dublin North 4 Dublin North–Central 3 Dublin North–East 3 Dublin North–West 3 Dublin South 5 Dublin South–Central 5 Dublin South–East 4 Dublin South–West 4 Dublin West 4 Dún Laoghaire 4 Galway East 4 Galway West 5 Kerry North–West Limerick 3 Kerry South 3 Kildare North 4 Kildare South 3 Laois–Offaly 5 Limerick 3 Limerick City 4 Longford–Westmeath 4 Louth 5 Mayo 5 Meath East 3 Meath West 3 Roscommon–South Leitrim 3 Sligo–North Leitrim 3 Tipperary North 3 Tipperary South 3 Waterford 4 Wexford 5 Wicklow 5\n\n2011 general election\n\nThe 2007 report of the Constituency Commission,[2] an independent body established by the Government of Ireland to review constituency boundaries, proposed several changes to Dáil constituencies. These changes were provided for by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. In July 2011 the Irish government established a commission to review to the current Dáil and European constituencies.[3]\n\nThis table summarises the changes in representation. It does not address revisions to the boundaries of constituencies.\n\nConstituency Created Seats Change Dublin West 1981 4 plus 1 seat Dún Laoghaire 1977 4 minus 1 seat Kerry North 1937 3 abolished Kerry North–West Limerick 2011 3 new constituency Limerick 2011 3 new constituency Limerick City 2011 4 new constituency Limerick East 1948 5 abolished Limerick West 1948 3 abolished Louth 1923 5 plus 1 seat\n\nThere were further boundary changes to 18 constituencies, these were: Cork East, Cork North–Central, Cork North–West, Donegal North–East, Donegal South–West, Dublin North, Dublin North–Central, Dublin North–East, Dublin South, Kerry South, Kildare North, Kildare South, Laois–Offaly, Meath East, Meath West, Roscommon–South Leitrim, Sligo–North Leitrim and Tipperary North.\n\nHistoric changes\n\n2007 general election\n\nMain article: Irish general election, 2007\n\nIn 2004 the report of the Constituency Commission,[4] proposed major changes to Dáil constituencies.

These new changes resulted in the creation of a 43rd constituency and the removal of the provincial boundary breach between Leinster and Connacht.\n\nThe number of seats was reduced in two constituencies:\n\nCork North–Central (from 5 to 4)\n\nDublin North–Central (from 4 to 3)\n\nTwo three-seater constituencies gained an extra seat:\n\nDublin Mid–West (from 3 to 4)\n\nKildare North (from 3 to 4)\n\nThere were further smaller boundary changes to eleven constituencies outside Dublin, these were: Clare, Cork North–West, Cork South–Central, Cork South–West, Donegal North–East, Donegal South–West, Kerry North, Kerry South, Kildare South, Limerick East and Limerick West.\n\nBoundaries for ten of the twelve Dublin constituencies were also revised apart from Dublin South–East and Dún Laoghaire.\n\n2002 general election\n\nMain article: Irish general election, 2002\n\nDublin North–East, Dublin North–West and Dublin West were reduced from 4 to 3 seats\n\nDublin South–Central was increased from 4 to 5 seats.\n\nDublin South–West was reduced from 5 to 4 seats\n\nDublin Mid West was a new 3-seater\n\n1997 general election\n\nMain article: Irish general election, 1997\n\nMayo East (3) and Mayo West (3) were replaced by Mayo (5)\n\nKildare (5) was replaced by Kildare North (3) and Kildare South (3)\n\nGalway East was increased from 3 to 4 seats\n\nTipperary South was reduced from 4 to 3 seats\n\n1992 general election\n\nMain article: Irish general election, 1992\n\nLongford–Westmeath (4) and Roscommon (3) were replaced with Westmeath (3) and Longford–Roscommon (4)\n\nDublin North was increased from 3 to 4 seats\n\nDublin Central was reduced from 5 to 4 seats\n\nDublin South–West was increased from 4 to 5 seats\n\nDublin South–Central was reduced from 5 to 4 seats\n\nDublin West was reduced from 5 to 4 seats\n\nWicklow was increased from 4 to 5 seats\n\nElectionsIreland.org – Boundary Revisions\n\nOireachtas.ie – Constituency Maps of Ireland"
