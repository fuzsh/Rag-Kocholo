Their votes ensured that hare coursing - one of Ireland's worst acts of cruelty to animals - continues.\n\nIn a country where a majority want this vile bloodsport banned, these public representatives were certainly not reflecting public opinion.\n\nThey disrespected the decent majority who abhor cruelty, they dismissed the petitions and all the appeals and worst of all, they disregarded the suffering and death inherent in coursing.\n\nShame on the 114 who had an opportunity to do the right thing but chose not to.\n\nWe thank and applaud the 20 compassionate TDs who stood up for Irish wildlife and supported Maureen O'Sullivan's bill.\n\nBelow we present an analysis of how TDs voted. Find out how politicians in your constituency voted and see how Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Labour and Sinn Fein compelled their members to vote against the bill by applying the party whip.\n\nThere will be more opportunities ahead to achieve a long overdue ban on hare coursing so please continue lobbying TDs, supporting protests, signing and sharing petitions, etc. The campaign will continue until the Irish Hare is permanently protected from persecution.\n\nACTION ALERTS\n\nPlease join us in thanking the compassionate TDs who supported the bill. Complain to those who voted against the bill. Tell them that their stance on this animal cruelty issue means hares will continue to suffer and die in coursing. Urge them to show compassion for Irish wildlife and vote differently next time a similar bill comes before the Dail.\n\nFind out names and contact details for TDs at https://www.whoismytd.com/\n\nor on the Oireachtas website http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=32&disp=mem\n\nExpress your support for a ban on coursing.
