promote two of the largest challenges to traditional conceptions of Irish nation-statehood, i.e. the handing over of state sovereignty to the European Union and the retraction of the constitutional claim over Northern Ireland? This book argues that, rather than indicating a pragmatic retraction of nationalism, such decisions (and their justification on the public stage) reveal the unique power and continuing relevance of nationalism to Irish and, indeed, European politics today.\n\nAs the most detailed study to date of Irish official discourse in the late twentieth century, this book reveals how Irish governmental elites changed their definition of Irish nation-statehood in response to EU membership. This redefinition of Ireland’s identity, borders and governance was made all the more necessary by the Troubles and the related challenges to the credibility of Irish official nationalism. However, this process has not taken the form of ‘Europeanisation’ or of a simple replacing of ‘old’ concepts with ‘new’ ones. Rather, whilst conceptions of identity, borders and governance inspired by the European Union (EU) have been employed to help find more widely acceptable conceptions of Irish nation-statehood in relation to Northern Ireland, the Irish governmental elite has affirmed traditional conceptions of identity, borders and governance when conceptualising the position and prospects of Ireland in the EU. Thus, Irish official discourse appears to have been used not only to accommodate both traditional and new conceptions of nation-statehood, but also to make them appear mutually complementary.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis book is based on original research funded by a doctoral research scholarship from University College Dublin and completed through post-doctoral research fellowships from the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences and the Institute of Irish Studies’ International Research Initiative at Queen’s University Belfast.

Ahern was an early supporter of Haughey within the party and supported him against the challenge from Reynolds and others in late 1991. After sacking Reynolds as Minister for Finance in 1991, Haughey handed the position to Ahern. He was one of just two cabinet ministers to remain in their posts once Reynolds assumed the premiership in January 1992 and, when Reynolds resigned in 1994 following the collapse of the Fianna Fáil/Labour coalition, Ahern succeeded Reynolds unopposed. Somewhat surprisingly for a man known to have such good negotiating skills, Labour could not be persuaded back into coalition with Fianna Fáil and Ahern sat in opposition for three years. Ahern won the general election in June 1997 and formed a government in coalition with the Progressive Democrats; the same coalition won again in 2002 and in the 2007 election Fianna Fáil retained power with the aid of a dramatically reduced Progressive Democrat party, the Green Party and Independent TDs. Bertie Ahern resigned as Taoiseach on 6 May 2008.\n\nAndrews, David (b.1936): son of Todd Andrews, Andrews became Fianna Fáil TD for Dún Laoghaire in 1965. Lynch appointed him Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1977. His ministerial career was stymied by the fact that he backed George Colley against Haughey in the 1979 party leadership election, and he did not return to the frontbenches until 1992, when he was briefly Minister for Foreign Affairs for Albert Reynolds before Fianna Fáil went into coalition with Labour. Andrews was first Minister for Defence in Bertie Ahern’s government but was soon returned to Foreign Affairs to succeed Ray Burke. Andrews was a lead negotiator for the Irish government in the Good Friday Agreement. He retired as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2000.\n\nBruton, John (b.1947): one of the youngest ever TDs, Bruton was elected for Fine Gael for the Meath constituency in 1969 and was appointed Minister for Finance by Garret FitzGerald in 1981. The Dáil defeat of Bruton’s controversial budget of February 1982 led to the early collapse of the coalition government. On the coalition’s re-instatement in November 1982, Bruton was moved to the Ministry for Industry and Trade, to return to the post of Minister for Finance following a cabinet reshuffle in 1986. Again, Bruton’s budgetary proposals led to controversy and the coalition split once more in 1987. On Garret FitzGerald’s resignation, Bruton became deputy party leader (to Alan Dukes) and, in 1990, stood unopposed as Fine Gael leader. The party’s poor fortunes at the national polls continued in the 1992 election and it was only because of the Fianna Fáil/Labour coalition’s premature collapse in late 1994 that Bruton became Taoiseach, with the support of Labour and Democratic Left. Bruton’s partnership with Labour’s Dick Spring as Tánaiste and Proinsias De Rossa (Democratic Left) was a surprising success and Fine Gael made gains in the 1997 election, but not enough to counter the losses to its coalition partners. Bruton resigned from the party leadership in 2001 and subsequently became, along with De Rossa, an Irish Parliament representative to the European Convention on the Constitution, as well as National Parliament Representative on the steering committee of the Convention. In 2004, following resignation from the Dáil, he was appointed EU ambassador to the United States.\n\nBurke, Ray (b.1943): elected Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin North in 1973, Burke was Minister of State in Lynch’s second government and held various ministerial positions (Environment; Energy; Industry; Justice; Communications) in the Haughey administrations. He was not appointed to the cabinet by Reynolds, but was made Minister for Foreign Affairs by Bertie Ahern in June 1997. He resigned as minister and TD in October 1997 over allegations he received corrupt payments, subsequently a matter for tribunal inquiry.\n\nButt, Isaac (1813–79): a Protestant from Donegal, Butt’s political career saw him move from Conservative Unionism (and Orangeism) towards liberalism in thought and affiliation. He became an advocate of a federal solution to the British–Irish relationship and founder of the Irish Home Rule League in 1873, from which he resigned shortly before his death.\n\nCarson, Edward (1854–1935): Dublin-born Protestant with a prominent political career in Ireland, north and south, and Britain. Unionist MP for the University of Dublin (1892) and for Belfast Duncairn (1918–21). Leader of the Irish Unionist Party (1910–21), he led the campaign against Home Rule, including the Ulster Covenant of 1912. Solicitor-General for Ireland (1892); appointed Attorney-General (1915–16); joined the cabinet (1917–18) but resigned on discovery that Prime Minister Lloyd George was drafting an all-Ireland Home Rule Bill (Foster, 1989: 465).\n\nCollins, Gerry (b.1938): Fianna Fáil TD for Limerick, Collins held positions of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Foreign Affairs (1982, 1989–92) in the Lynch and Haughey administrations. In his latter ministerial role, Collins served as President of the Council of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1990. He supported Haughey right up to his resignation and was excluded from Reynolds’ cabinet (retiring as a TD in 1997). Collins was an MEP from 1994 to 2004.\n\nCollins, Michael (1890–1922): a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and participant in the Easter Rising, Collins joined the executive of Sinn Féin in 1917 under de Valera’s presidency. He was elected MP in 1918 for Cork South and sat in Sinn Féin’s Dáil Éireann. In 1919 he was nominated Minister for Finance by de Valera, elected president of the IRB, and became a director of intelligence for the IRA, thus taking a leading role for republicans during the Irish War of Independence. Following the truce, he deputised Griffith in negotiations with the British government, leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. Collins’ attempts to find a compromise between the pro- and anti- Treaty divisions in Sinn Féin failed and he led the Provisional Government and its army against the anti-Treaty IRA during the Civil War, during which he was killed in an ambush.\n\nCosgrave, Liam (b.1920): son of W. T. Cosgrave, he became a Fine Gael TD for Co. Dublin aged 23 and was made Minister for External Affairs in the coalition government of 1954, in which role he chaired meetings of the Council of Ministers for the Council of Europe. He succeeded Dillon as party leader in 1965 and became Taoiseach of the Fine Gael/Labour coalition government in 1973. He resigned as party leader following defeat in the 1977 general election and retired from politics in 1981.\n\nCosgrave, W. T. (1880–1965): imprisoned for his active role in the Easter Rising, Cosgrave won a parliamentary seat (Kilkenny by-election) for Sinn Féin whilst in prison in 1917 and won the Carlow-Kilkenny seat in the general election of the following year. On the pro-Treaty side in 1921, he succeeded Collins as Chairman of the Provisional Government in 1922, becoming the first President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State in December 1922. In April 1923, following the split within Sinn Féin, Cosgrave led the resulting pro-Treaty party of Cumann na nGaedheal, which was to be the governing party of the Irish Free State until 1932. The following year, in opposition, Cosgrave oversaw the creation of Fine Gael (from Cumann na nGaedheal, the National Centre Party and the National Guard) and led it until his retirement in 1944.\n\nCostello, John A. (1891–1976): Attorney-General 1926–32, in which role he represented Ireland at meetings of the League of Nations; 1933 elected Cumann na nGaedheal (Fine Gael) TD for Co. Dublin. In 1944 he became Fine Gael spokesperson on External Affairs. After the 1948 election, he became Taoiseach of a coalition led by Fine Gael (whose leader Richard Mulcahy was not acceptable as Taoiseach for some coalition partners). In his times as Taoiseach (1949–51, 1954–57), Ireland left the British Commonwealth (when the External Relations Act was repealed and the Republic of Ireland Act passed) and later joined the United Nations.\n\nCowen, Brian (b.1960): Cowen was elected Fianna Fáil TD for Laois-Offaly in 1984. He supported Albert Reynolds’ bid for the party leadership in the early 1990s and held ministerial positions (Labour; Energy; Transport; Health) in Reynolds’ government. On return to government (under Ahern) in 1997, Cowen was made Minister for Health and Children and succeeded David Andrews to the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs at a time (2000) of continued negotiations over ‘sticking issues’ in post-GFA Northern Ireland. He was made Minister for Finance in 2004 and, following the poor showing of the Progressive Democrats in the 2007 general election, Tánaiste. Cowen succeeded Bertie Ahern as leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach in May 2008, forming the 28th Government of Ireland just six weeks before the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nCraig, James (also Viscount Craigavon) (1871–1940): Belfast-born, MP from 1906 to 1921, when he succeeded Carson as leader of the Unionist Party and became Northern Ireland’s first Prime Minister until his death in 1940. Although he was a parliamentary secretary 1919–21, Craig was never as comfortable in wider British politics as Carson. He was actively involved in organising Ulster Volunteers against Home Rule.\n\nDe Valera, Éamon (1882–1975): born in New York and raised in Limerick, a member of the Gaelic League, Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, he held a position of responsibility during the Rising for which he was imprisoned until 1917. On his release, he took a parliamentary seat for Sinn Féin in an east Clare by-election and the following year led the party to victory in the general election. Although officially president of the first Dáil Éireann, de Valera was absent (due to imprisonment or fundraising in the US) for much of its nativity and he resigned from that position following the Dáil’s narrow ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He was nominal leader of the anti-Treaty forces during the Civil War, after which he was interned until 1924. He resigned from Sinn Féin whilst still its leader (because it rejected his proposal to accept the Free State Constitution) and founded Fianna Fáil in 1926. The following year he swore the Oath of Allegiance in order to become a TD. In 1932, Fianna Fáil gained a parliamentary majority, making de Valera Taoiseach. His dismantling of the 1921 Treaty from the position of government culminated in the 1937 Bunreacht na hÉireann. The following year he was elected President of the Assembly of the League of Nations but his international standing was soon damaged by his policy of neutrality during the Second World War. De Valera held the position of Taoiseach (with two three-year gaps of inter-party governments) until 1959, when he was replaced by Seán Lemass and moved to Áras an Uachtaráin as President of Ireland until 1973.\n\nDevlin, Joseph (1871–1934): Belfast-born Devlin was active in the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation and then the United Irish League before being elected MP for the Irish Parliamentary Party in Kilkenny North in 1902 and for Belfast West in 1906. He followed the party line (including Redmond’s position on the War) until 1918, when he opposed the compromise with southern Unionists following the Irish Convention. From 1918 until his death, he led the Nationalist Party in Northern Ireland, first in Westminster (in a policy of abstention) and then from 1929 in Stormont. Devlin played a crucial role in the revival of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in Ireland.\n\nDillon, James (1902–86): son of John Dillon, the last leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, James Dillon became TD for the National Centre Party (later merged into Fine Gael) for Donegal West in 1932 and, from 1937, for Co. Monaghan. He was Minister for Agriculture in Costello’s coalition governments (1948–51, 1954–57) and became leader of Fine Gael in 1959 until his resignation following narrow defeat by Lemass’ Fianna Fáil in the 1965 general election.\n\nDillon, John (1851–1927): Dublin-born, MP for County Tipperary 1880–83 and for Mayo East 1885–1918. Joined the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation after the split in the Irish Parliamentary Party, and later replaced Justin McCarthy as its leader. Supported Redmond on the Irish Party’s reunion and supported the third Home Rule Bill in 1912. He became leader of the Irish Party in March 1918 and withdrew it from the Commons one month later in protest at the extension of conscription to Ireland. In an event that mirrored the fortunes of the Irish Parliamentary Party as a whole, Dillon lost his seat to de Valera in the 1918 election.\n\nFitzGerald, Garret (b.1926): the son of Desmond FitzGerald (1888–1947; London-born Irish Volunteer, Sinn Féin then Cumann na nGaedheal TD, first Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State), FitzGerald had a relatively high profile as a writer and lecturer on economics before being elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965. He was elected Fine Gael TD for Dublin South East in 1969 and was soon active as a liberal member of the parliamentary party. He was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cosgrave’s coalition government of 1973, a role in which he made a particular impression in the EEC, including holding Ireland’s first Presidency. FitzGerald assumed leadership of Fine Gael in 1977, overseeing an exceptional growth in the party. Fine Gael formed a coalition government with Labour following the 1981 election but FitzGerald was forced to ask President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil in late January 1982 following the defeat of Bruton’s hairshirt budget. Fine Gael lost just two seats in the subsequent February election and was in a relatively strong position to resume power in the election of November that same year alongside Labour. FitzGerald’s reformist agenda – in a range of matters from British-Irish relations to contraception – met substantial opposition; his economic policies towards ‘fiscal rectitude’ were the most unpopular of all. Fine Gael lost nearly a third of its seats in the 1987 election and FitzGerald resigned as party leader, remaining as a TD for a further five years.\n\nGavan Duffy, George (1882–1951): English-born Gavan Duffy came to Dublin in 1917 when he was called to the Irish bar and defended several Irish republicans, including Roger Casement. He was subsequently elected as Sinn Féin MP (South Dublin) in 1918, and was sent by de Valera, with Seán T. O’Kelly, as envoy of the Irish Republic to the Paris Peace conference. He was a reluctant signatory to the Anglo-Irish Treaty and Minister for Foreign Affairs for the fourth Ministry of the Second Dáil Éireann in 1922, but resigned from office the same year. He continued to have a notable legal career, unofficially advising de Valera on the 1937 Constitution and serving as President of the High Court.\n\nGriffith, Arthur (1872–1922): member of the Gaelic League and Irish Republican Brotherhood, he founded Sinn Féin in 1905 and became its president in 1908 until replaced by de Valera in 1917. He was elected an MP for Sinn Féin in 1918 although his relationship with the party leadership was tense. He took a strong pro-Treaty stance after his involvement in negotiations and was voted President of Dáil Éireann for a short period immediately after its ratification.\n\nGwynn, Stephen (1864–1950): prolific author, member of the Gaelic League, and MP (Galway City, 1906–18) for the Irish Parliamentary Party, for which he led much of the pro-Home Rule Act publicity in face of the Sinn Féin challenge. Perhaps his greatest act in this regard was following Redmond’s call (and his own as member of the Irish Recruiting Council) and enlisting with the British Army during the First World War, where he had a distinguished military career. He returned to take Redmond’s place in the Irish Convention negotiations. After failing to win a seat in the 1918 elections, Gwynn turned to political commentary, becoming Ireland Correspondent for such papers as the Observer.\n\nHarney, Mary (b.1953): appointed by Lynch to Seanad Éireann in 1977, Harney was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1981 for Fianna Fáil (Dublin South/Mid West). She broke ranks with the party leadership by voting in favour of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was later one of the founding members of the breakaway Progressive Democrats. She succeeded Des O’Malley as party leader in 1993 and entered coalition government with Bertie Ahern four years later, becoming Tánaiste (until 2007). She has held ministerial responsibility for Enterprise and Health.\n\nHaughey, Charles (1925–2006): born in Mayo to parents from Co. Derry, Haughey became a TD for Dublin North Central on his fourth attempt in 1957 and was quickly appointed to the junior ministry by Lemass, becoming Minister for Justice in 1961 (during which time he dealt a strong hand against the IRA and its border campaigns, introducing special military courts and overseeing internment for IRA prisoners) and Minister for Agriculture in 1964. In 1966 he declared himself a candidate for the leadership of Fianna Fáil on Lemass’ retirement but later stepped aside on the Taoiseach’s advice in order to support the compromise candidate of Jack Lynch. He was rewarded with the position of Minister of Finance. Haughey was sacked from this position by Lynch in May 1970 over the ‘Arms Crisis’ and remained on the backbenches until 1975, when Lynch appointed him spokesman for Health and Social Welfare. Haughey held ministerial responsibility for this post when Fianna Fáil was re-elected to power in 1977. He beat Tánaiste George Colley in the leadership election following Lynch’s resignation in 1979, thus becoming Taoiseach. Haughey failed to gain a majority in the June 1981 election but regained power following the premature collapse of the FitzGerald administration in February 1982 through the support of four left-wing (Independent and Workers’ Party) TDs. However, these TDs withdrew their support for Fianna Fáil over its planned spending cuts and Haughey lost power again in November 1982. He returned as Taoiseach of a minority government in 1987 (having depended on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle [Speaker]), following parliamentary defeat in a Dáil vote, he called an election in 1989, this time depending on Desmond O’Malley’s Progressive Democrats (a breakaway party from Fianna Fáil) as coalition partners. Haughey resigned as party leader and Taoiseach in January 1992 following growing disquiet within the Fianna Fáil and was succeeded by Albert Reynolds, whom he had sacked from the post of Minister for Finance a few months earlier for his declaration of opposition to Haughey. He retired from politics the same year although the rest of his life was dogged by scandal relating to unethical payments he received whilst in power.\n\nHealy, Timothy (1855–1931): Healy’s political career is characterised by variety. Healy’s political career saw him elected as an Irish Parliamentary Party MP for, variously, Wexford, Monaghan, South Londonderry, north Longford and (for the Irish National Federation in 1892) north Louth. Following the split in the IPP, Healy was expelled from both the pro-Parnellite Irish National League and the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation. In 1911 he took the parliamentary seat in his native Cork for the anti-IPP All-for-Ireland League. He resigned his seat in favour of the Sinn Féin candidate in 1918 and was recommended by Cosgrave for the position of Governor General of Ireland, which he held from its creation in 1922 until his resignation in 1927.\n\nHobson, Bulmer (1882–1969): a Quaker from Co. Tyrone, Hobson was a founding member of the Irish Volunteers and sat on the Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He sided with MacNeill against the Easter Rising, and later became a civil servant in the Free State.\n\nHyde, Douglas (1860–1949): a Protestant from Co. Roscommon, Hyde is best known for founding the Gaelic League and for being the first to hold the position of President of Ireland following the dissolution of the office of Governor General through the 1937 Constitution.\n\nLemass, Seán (1899–1971): he joined the Irish Volunteers in his youth, and subsequently participated in the Easter Rising, the War of Independence (for which he was interned 1920–21) and, for the anti-Treaty republicans, the Civil War. He was elected as TD for Sinn Féin for Dublin City in 1924 and soon after joined de Valera in leaving Sinn Féin to found Fianna Fáil. He served as Minister for Industry and Commerce (Minister for Supplies during the Emergency) under de Valera in all his governments until 1959, when he succeeded de Valera as leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach until 1966.\n\nLynch, Jack (1917–99): Cork-born Lynch had an illustrious reputation as a Gaelic Athletic Association footballer and hurler, only retiring inter-county competition some years after being elected as Fianna Fáil TD for Cork in 1948. He soon became an assistant and speech writer for de Valera and was appointed a parliamentary secretary in 1951. From 1957, he held ministerial posts for Education, the Gaeltacht, Industry and Commerce and, in 1965, Finance. When Lemass retired in 1966, there were a substantial number of prospective leaders within a restless Fianna Fáil, and Lynch was persuaded to stand as a compromise candidate against George Colley. His first period in office was a time of upheaval in Irish politics, with the rising Troubles in Northern Ireland and Ireland’s entry into the EEC. He lost the election of February 1973 to the Fine Gael/Labour coalition but returned a significant majority for Fianna Fáil in 1977. Nonetheless, power struggles within the party led to his early resignation in December 1979, just before completing his term as President-in-office of the Council of the EEC.\n\nMacBride, Seán (1904–88): former Chief of Staff of the anti-Treaty IRA and founder of the republican socialist party Clann na Poblachta, for which he was elected TD for Dublin County (South-West) in 1944. He became Minister for External Affairs in Costello’s first inter-party government and played a key role in Ireland’s withdrawal from the Commonwealth. MacBride left the Dáil in 1957, after which time he played a significant role in international affairs, including in the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United Nations and Amnesty International (which he founded). He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974.\n\nMcCarthy, Justin (1830–1912): a Liberal and Home Rule MP for Longford (1879–86, 1892–1900) and Londonderry (1886–92), he chaired the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation at its inception.\n\nO’Donnell, Liz (b. 1956): former deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats, O’Donnell was TD for Dublin South in 1992 until 2007 and helped negotiated the PDs into coalition government with Ahern’s Fianna Fáil. She was made Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs and was involved in the negotiations around the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nO’Higgins, Kevin (1892–1927): Sinn Féin MP for Laois (then Queen’s County) from 1918 and one of the original members of Cumann na nGaedheal, O’Higgins’ rose rapidly within the political rankings, holding the position of assistant Minister for Local Government in the first and second Dáil Éireann and (as a strongly pro-Treaty member) Minister for Economic Affairs in the Provisional Government, Minister for Justice (1922–27), first vice-president of the Executive Council from December 1922 and briefly Minister for External Affairs. As Minister for Justice, he was responsible for the establishment of the Civic Guard (becoming An Garda Síochána) and the execution of many republican prisoners during the Irish Civil War. For this latter role, he was assassinated by the anti-Treaty IRA in July 1927.\n\nO’Neill, Terence (1914–90): born and educated in England to an aristocratic family from Ulster, O’Neill was elected to Stormont for the Unionist Party in 1946. In 1963 he became party leader and succeeded Lord Brookeborough as Prime Minister for Northern Ireland. His reformist policies and conciliatory gestures (such as the meetings with Lemass and Lynch) were unpopular with many members of his own party. The increasing unrest around the civil rights movement, growing paramilitary activity and internal dissidence within the UUP made O’Neill’s position untenable and he resigned as party leader and Prime Minister in April 1969.\n\nParnell, Charles Stewart (1846–91): Wicklow-born Protestant, elected MP for the Home Rule League in 1875 and soon became associated with radicalism and parliamentary obstructionism. He became party leader in 1880 and founded the Irish Parliamentary Party two years later. Parnell’s able tactics as a parliamentarian were central to Gladstone’s decision to introduce the first Home Rule Bill (Foster, 1989: 359).\n\nPearse, Patrick (1879–1916): a young member of the Gaelic League and one of the first members of the Irish Volunteers. His membership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood led to him taking a leading role in the Easter Rising.\n\nPlunkett, Horace Curzon (1854–1932): a Protestant from Co. Meath, Plunkett moved from being a unionist of Anglo-Irish heritage to a staunch Irish nationalist. He was a Conservative MP for South Dublin from 1892 to 1900 but became convinced of the need for Home Rule after the failure of the Irish Council Bill in 1908. He chaired the Irish Convention (1917–18), seeking to find agreement on implementing the third Home Rule Act. In seeking compromise between nationalists, unionists and Britain, and as an alternative to partition, he founded the Irish Dominion League, proposing a united Ireland within the British Commonwealth. He was a senator in the post-Treaty Seanad Éireann, but turned in later life to his other interest of agricultural co-operation.\n\nRedmond, John (1856–1918): Nationalist MP from 1881 until his death in 1918. After the Irish Parliamentary Party’s split and Parnell’s death, Redmond led the Parnellite minority Irish National League from 1891, during which time he worked constructively with Irish Unionists in Westminster, such as Plunkett, and later became leader of the reunited Irish Parliamentary Party in 1900. Redmond played a crucial role in the introduction of the third Home Rule Bill of 1912 and his trust that it would be implemented after the First World War (which caused its suspension in 1914) caused him to encourage Irish volunteers to join the British Army.\n\nReynolds, Albert (b.1932): after a successful and varied business career, Reynolds was elected TD for Longford-Westmeath in Fianna Fáil’s landslide election victory of 1977. Reynolds supported Haughey in the wrestle to replace Lynch as Fianna Fáil leader in 1979, and was rewarded with ministerial positions of Posts and Telegraphs, Transport (1980–82), Industry and Energy (1982) and Industry and Commerce (1987–88). In 1988, he replaced Ray MacSharry (who became European Commissioner) as Minister for Finance and played a key role in negotiating agreement with the Progressive Democrats to support Fianna Fáil in government after the 1989 election. Following growing disquiet within the party about Haughey’s leadership, Reynolds announced he would stand for election should Haughey resign and subsequently backed a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach. He was sacked for this action but shortly afterwards won the leadership election and premiership following Haughey’s resignation in January 1992. Reynolds held onto the position of Taoiseach after the general election a year later through coalition agreement with Labour. The government survived a series of storms (some of which related to Reynolds’ decisions in business) but by late 1994 Dick Spring led the Labour Party out of government (following disagreement over the Taoiseach’s nominated appointee for President of the High Court) leaving Reynolds little choice but to resign."
