        "text": "Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, PC, Irish politician, courtier and soldier, dies of apoplexy on August 14, 1691, in Limerick, County Limerick. He is also known by the nickname “Mad Dick” Talbot.\n\nTalbot is born likely in 1630, probably in Dublin. He is one of sixteen children, the youngest of eight sons of William Talbot and his wife Alison Netterville. His father is a lawyer and the 1st Baronet Talbot of Carton, County Kildare. His mother is a daughter of John Netterville of Castletown, Kildare. The Talbots are descended from a Norman family that had settled in Leinster in the 12th century. They adhere to the Catholic faith, despite the founding of the Reformed Church of Ireland under Henry VIII. Little is recorded of Talbot’s upbringing. As an adult he grows to be unusually tall and strong by standards of the time.\n\nTalbot marries Katherine Baynton in 1669 and they have two daughters, Katherine and Charlotte. Katherine dies in 1679. In 1681, he marries Frances Jennings, sister of Sarah Jennings, the future Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.\n\nTalbot’s early career is spent as a cavalryman in the Irish Confederate Wars. Following a period on the European continent, he joins the court of James, Duke of York, then in exile following the English Civil War, becoming a close and trusted associate. After the 1660 restoration of James’s older brother, Charles, to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland, he begins acting as agent or representative for Irish Catholics attempting to recover estates confiscated after the Cromwellian conquest, a role that defines the remainder of his career. James converts to Catholicism in the late 1660s, strengthening his association with Talbot.\n\nWhen James takes the throne in 1685, Talbot’s influence increases. He oversees a major purge of Protestants from the Irish Army, which had previously barred most Catholics. James creates him Earl of Tyrconnell and later makes him Viceroy, or Lord Deputy of Ireland. He immediately begins building a Catholic establishment by admitting Catholics to many administrative, political and judicial posts.\n\nTalbot’s efforts are interrupted by James’s 1688 deposition by his Protestant son-in-law William of Orange. He continues as a Jacobite supporter of James during the subsequent Williamite War in Ireland, but also considers a peace settlement with William that would preserve Catholic rights. Increasingly incapacitated by illness, he dies of a stroke on August 14, 1691, shortly before the Jacobite defeat. He is thought to have been buried in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Limerick. By depriving the Jacobites of their most experienced negotiator, his death possibly has a substantial impact on the terms of the Treaty of Limerick that ends the war.\n\nTalbot’s widow, Frances, and his daughter, Charlotte, remain in France, where Charlotte marries her kinsman, Richard Talbot, son of William Talbot of Haggardstown. Their son is Richard Francis Talbot. Talbot’s other daughter, Katherine, becomes a nun. An illegitimate son, Mark Talbot, serves as an officer in France before his death in the Battle of Luzzara in 1702. Talbot’s estate in nearby Carton, renamed Talbotstown, is uncompleted at the time of his death. Tyrconnell Tower on the site is originally intended by him as a family mausoleum to replace the existing vault at Old Carton graveyard but is also left unfinished.\n\nTalbot is controversial in his own lifetime. His own Chief Secretary, Thomas Sheridan, later describes him as a “cunning dissembling courtier […] turning with every wind to bring about his ambitious ends and purposes.” Many 19th and early 20th century historians repeat this view. Recent assessments have suggested a more complex individual whose career was defined by personal loyalty to his patron James and above all by an effort to improve the status of the Irish Catholic gentry, particularly the “Old English” community to which he belonged.\n\n(Pictured: Watercolour portrait of Richard Talbot by John Bulfinch (d.1728) after painting by Sir Godfrey Kneller)\n\nShare this:\n\nGerard William Augustine Hogan, MRIA, Irish judge, lawyer and academic who has served as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ireland since October 2021, is born on August 13, 1958, in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. He previously serves as Advocate General of the European Court of Justice from 2018 to 2021, a Judge of the Court of Appeal from 2014 to 2018 and a Judge of the High Court from 2010 to 2014. He first works as a barrister and lecturer in law specialising in constitutional and administrative law.\n\nHogan is born to Mai and Liam Hogan. His father is the deputy principal of the Christian Brothers secondary school in the town. He is educated at University College Dublin (UCD), from where he receives BCL and LLM degrees in 1979 and 1981. He co-authors his first book Prisoners’ Rights: A Study in Irish Prison Law in 1981 with Paul McDermott and Raymond Byrne. He obtains a John F. Kennedy memorial scholarship to study for an LLM at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He subsequently attends the King’s Inns. He holds two doctorates – an LLD from UCD and a PhD in law from Trinity College Dublin in 2001.\n\nIn 1986, early in his legal career, he supports the Anti-Apartheid Movement with other legal scholars, including Mary McAleese, Mary Robinson and Bryan MacMahon. He is involved with the Progressive Democrats and in 1988 writes the party’s proposed new Constitution of Ireland with Michael McDowell. In May 2021, he is made a member of the Royal Irish Academy.\n\nHogan is called to the Bar in July 1984 and becomes a Senior Counsel in 1997. He appears domestically in cases in the High Court and the Supreme Court and internationally at the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice.\n\nHogan is noted in particular for his experience in constitutional law. He acts for the Attorney General of Ireland in references made by President Mary Robinson under Article 26 of the Constitution of Ireland to the Supreme Court regarding the Information (Termination of Pregnancies) Bill 1995 and the Employment Equality Bill of 1997. He appears again for the Attorney General (with Dermot Gleeson and Paul Gallagher) in another reference made by President Mary McAleese regarding the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004.\n\nHogan is a law lecturer and fellow at Trinity College Dublin from 1982 to 2007. He lectures on constitutional law, competition law and the law of tort. He is regarded as “one of the foremost constitutional and administrative lawyers in Ireland.” He is the co-author of Administrative Law in Ireland and JM Kelly: The Irish Constitution, the core Irish legal texts in Irish administrative and constitutional law respectively. He also writes a text on political violence and a book chronicling the origins of the Constitution of Ireland.\n\nDuring his career as a barrister, Hogan is involved in cases involving employment law, habeas corpus, immigration law, judicial review, company law and commercial law.\n\nHogan appears for Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners in the High Court and Miss D in her case related to the rights to travel abroad for an abortion. He represents the State in the High Court and the Supreme Court in litigation that emerges following a court finding that an offence of unlawful carnal knowledge is unconstitutional. In 2008, he acts for Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly in the Supreme Court who are contesting an action taken by families of victims of the Omagh bombing when they are refused access to books of evidence.\n\nHogan is involved in several tribunals and Oireachtas committee investigations, appearing either in the actual proceedings or in related court proceedings. He represents Desmond O’Malley at the Beef Tribunal in 1992, Dermot Desmond at the Moriarty Tribunal in 2004, and Jim Higgins and Brendan Howlin in actions related to the Morris Tribunal. He acts for the Committee on Members’ Interests of Seanad Éireann in action taken by Ivor Callely.\n\nHogan is the first barrister to appear in an Irish court without a wig, following the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.\n\nThroughout his career, Hogan has been a member of committees and boards in areas requiring legal expertise. He chairs the Department of Justice‘s Balance in Criminal Law Review Group and is a member of three other review groups: the Constitution Review Group, the Competition and Mergers Review Group and the Offences Against the State Acts Review Group. He is also a member of the Competition Authority‘s Advisory Panel and the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.\n\nHogan is appointed a Judge of the High Court in 2010. Soon after his appointment, he holds an emergency hearing in his home regarding a blood transfusion for a sick baby. He is one of three judges who hears a case taken by Marie Fleming, seeking a right to die in 2012. His reference to the European Court of Justice in 2014 regarding the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, results in a declaration by the Grand Chamber that the Safe Harbour Decision is invalid. He subsequently becomes a Judge of the Court of Appeal upon its establishment in October 2014.\n\nIn May 2018, Hogan is nominated by the Government of Ireland for appointment as the Advocate General to the European Court of Justice. His term begins in October 2018 and was scheduled to expire in October 2024. Anthony Collins is appointed in 2021 to complete his term following his appointment to the Supreme Court. He concludes his term on October 7, 2021.\n\nIn one of his first opinions, on a reference from the French Conseil d’État, Hogan finds that Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2011, requires that products originating from Israeli-occupied territories should indicate if these products come from such a territory. His opinion is followed by the Court of Justice.\n\nIn April 2021, the Irish government nominates Hogan to the Supreme Court of Ireland. He is appointed in October 2021.\n\nShare this:\n\nOn August 12, 1744, during the War of the Austrian Succession between Austria and the Kingdom of Naples, the Irish Brigade of Spain fights at the Battle of Velletri, in Italy, against an Austrian army commanded by Irishman Field Marshal Count Maximillian Ulysses Browne, of Limerick.\n\nOn June 17, as darkness falls, 12,000 troops move toward the fortifications of Monte Piccolo. At dawn the Walloon grenadiers of the Spanish regiments occupy the battery of Monte Piccolo, while other troops occupy the Artemisio Male, La Fajola and set fire to the Pratoni del Vivaro, the commander of the Monte Piccolo garrison, Jan. Pestaluzzi, is captured, probably drunk in a farmhouse of winemakers. The next day, Jean Thierry du Mont, comte de Gages, gives the order to withdraw and preserve only the Artemisio ridge line.\n\nThe surprise nighttime attack of Browne’s Austrians on Velletri on August 12 overruns the advanced Irish picquets commanded by Lt. Burke, who is killed, and capture much of King Charles III of Spain‘s royal entourage. But Burke’s men rally to make a fighting retreat, joined by members of the relief guard commanded by Capt. Slattery. The delaying tactics of the picquets allow the rest of the Brigade, along with a regiment of Walloons, to form a line to meet the Austrians. Still, the Irish are heavily outnumbered and suffer tremendous casualties as the Austrians push them. At Velletri’s gates they make a stand. Col. MacDonald of the Hibernia regiment and over 40 other Irish officers are killed, along with several hundred of the red-coated Irish soldiers. But they exhaust the Austrians, as well. With the rest of the Spanish army now rallied behind them, the remaining Irish and Walloons lead a bayonet charge that drives the Austrians from the field. So impressively did the Irish fight, the King of Spain awards each regiment a motto for their flags: “In Omneim Terram ex hivit sonos corum” (Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth). And to each regiment he also grants a sobriquet: To Irlanda, “El Famoso“; to Ultonia, “El Immortal“; and to Hibernia, “La Culumna Irlanda” (“The pillar of Ireland”).\n\nRaimondo di Sangro takes part in the Battle of Velletri, distinguishing himself for his courage and skill. Act 3 of the drama Don Álvaro o la fuerza del sino by Ángel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas, and the opera La forza del destino by Giuseppe Verdi, based on Saavedra’s play, is set during the Battle of Velletri.\n\n(Pictured: Charles VII of Naples at the Battle of Velletri by Camillo Guerra, oil on canvas, 1850)\n\nShare this:\n\nGrace Henry HRHA, Scottish landscape artist who spends a large part of her career painting in Ireland, dies in Dublin on August 11, 1953.\n\nHenry is born Emily Grace Mitchell at Kirktown St. Fergus, near Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on February 10, 1868. She is the ninth of ten children of the Rev. John Mitchell and Jane Mitchell (née Gardner). Lord Byron is a cousin of her maternal grandmother. She is educated at home, spending time at the family’s home in Piccadilly, where she experiences London society. After the death of her father, and the reduced circumstances she finds herself in, she leaves home in 1895 to pursue a career as an artist. The first record of her work being exhibited is with the Aberdeen Artists Society in 1896 and 1898. These paintings have not been traced since. In 1899, she leaves Scotland for the continent, visiting Holland and Belgium, studying at the Blanc‐Guerrins Academy in Brussels. She goes on to attend the Delacluze Academy in Paris. While in Paris, she meets Paul Henry, an Irish artist. The couple marries in September 1903 in London.\n\nThe Henrys live at a few different residences outside London until 1910. A small number of her works are known from this time, such as The Girl in White, which is in the collections of the Hugh Lane Gallery. This piece shows the influence of fellow artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, whom she meets in Paris through her husband. The couple travels to Achill Island for the first time in 1910, intending to stay two-weeks, but going on to live there until 1919. During this time, she paints numerous night scenes, including Achill Cottages (Hugh Lane Gallery). One of her well-known works is Top of the Hill, on display in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, which shows a group of island women. The period spent on the island places a strain on the Henrys marriage, as she is not as happy living there.\n\nThe couple returns to Dublin in 1919 and are founding members of the Society of Dublin Painters in 1920 alongside Letitia Marion Hamilton, Mary Swanzy, and Jack Butler Yeats. The Society offers an outlet for younger Irish artists to exhibit. Five of Henry’s works are featured at the Irish Exhibition in Paris in 1922, and at a similar exhibition in Brussels in 1930.\n\nAround 1920, Henry has a romantic association with Stephen Gwynn who is an important political, cultural and literary figure from the lost world of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Ireland. During this period, she travels with Gwynn in France and Italy and later paints a number of portraits of him. Invariably, during this time, the Henrys’ marriage continues to have problems, with the couple breaking up in 1924. Her affair with Gwynn, who she depicts in two known oil paintings including The Orange Man (Limerick City Gallery of Art) and Portrait of a Man, which depicts a much more distinguished Gwynn in later life, contribute to the breakup. The couple legally separates in 1930.\n\nHenry develops her own style through the 1920s and 1930s, spending time in France and Italy. From 1924 to 1925, she studies with André Lhote, a cubist painter who also works with Mainie Jellett, Evie Hone, and Mary Swanzy. She goes on to display little of his influence in her work. She paints in Venice and in the environs of the Italian lakes, painting with the fauvist style, with free brushwork and vibrant colours. She also experiments with expressionism, which can be seen in Spring in Winter. Upon the outbreak of World War II, she returns to Ireland. She does not have a permanent residence during this period, instead stayed with friends or living in hotels. She also experiences periods of melancholy during these later years, though she continues to exhibit. Her work is regularly displayed at the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA), and she has solo shows at the Waddington and Dawson galleries. She is made an honorary member of the RHA in 1949.\n\nHenry dies in Dublin on August 11, 1953, and is buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery. During her career, and for a number of years after her death, she is largely overshadowed by her husband, sometimes being referred to as “Mrs. Paul Henry.” She is even omitted from Paul Henry’s two-volume autobiography. Her body of work is re-examined in the 1970s, which leads to wider public recognition and her inclusion in a number of exhibitions such as The Paintings of Paul and Grace Henry at the Hugh Lane Gallery in 1991. She is deemed to be a much bolder painter than her husband, incorporating more elements of the modernist movement, as evident in The Long Grey Road of Disting (1915). Her popularity has been growing since her rediscovery.\n\n(Pictured: “Road to Destiny,” oil on board by Grace Henry)\n\nShare this:\n\nJoseph Medlicott Scriven, an Irish-born Canadian poet best known as the writer of the poem which becomes the hymn “What a Friend We Have in Jesus,” drowns on August 10, 1886, in Bewdley, Northumberland County, Ontario, Canada.\n\nScriven is born on September 10, 1819, of prosperous parents in Banbridge, County Down. He graduates with a degree from Trinity College Dublin in 1842. His fiancée accidentally drowns in 1843, the night before they are to be married. In 1844, at the age of 25, he leaves his native country and migrates to Canada, settling in Woodstock, Ontario. He leaves his country feeling a spiritual calling to serve the Lord in his Plymouth Brethren faith. He remains in Canada only briefly after becoming ill but returns for good in 1847.\n\nFor two or three years Scriven conducts a private school at Brantford. In 1855, while staying with James Sackville in Bewdley, Ontario, north of Port Hope, he receives news from Ireland of his mother being terribly ill. He writes a poem to comfort his mother called “Pray Without Ceasing.” It is later set to music and renamed by Charles Crozat Converse, becoming the hymn “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.” Scriven does not have any intentions nor dream that his poem would be published in the newspaper and later become a favorite hymn among the millions of Christians around the world.\n\nAbout 1857, Scriven moves near to Port Hope, Ontario. Here he again falls in love and is due to be married, but in August 1860 his fiancée becomes ill with pneumonia and dies. He then devotes the rest of his life to tutoring, preaching and helping others.\n\nIn 1869, Scriven publishes a collection of 115 hymns entitled Hymns and other verses which does not include “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.”\n\nScriven drowns at age 66 on August 10, 1886. At the time of his death, he is very ill with fever and has been brought to a friend’s home to recover. It is a very hot night, and he goes outside possibly to cool down or to get a drink of cold water from the spring. His friend reports, “We left him about midnight. I withdrew to an adjoining room to watch and pray. You may imagine my surprise and dismay when upon visiting his room I found it empty. All search failed to find a trace of the missing man, until a little after noon his body was discovered in the nearby river, lifeless and cold in death.” To this day, no one knows for certain if his death is an accident or a suicide. He is buried next to his second fiancée in her family cemetery, Pengelley Family Cemetery, at Pengelly Landing, Peterborough County, Ontario, Canada.\n\nA tall obelisk is built upon his grave with the words from the song and the following inscription:\n\n“This monument was erected to the memory of Joseph M. Scriven, B.A., by lovers of his hymn, which is engraved hereon, and is his best memorial. Born at Seapatrick, Co. Down, Ireland, 10 Sept. 1819, emigrated to Canada 1844. Entered into rest at Bewdley, Rice Lake, 10 August 1886, and buried here. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.“\n\nA plaque can be found on the Port Hope-Peterborough Highway with the following inscription:\n\n“Four miles north, in the family Pengelley Cemetery, lies the philanthropist and author of this great masterpiece, written at Port Hope, 1857. The composer of the music, Charles C. Converse, was a well-educated versatile and successful Christian, whose talents ranged from law to professional music. Under the pen name of Karl Reden, he wrote numerous scholarly articles on many subjects. Though he was an excellent musician and composer with many of his works performed by the leading American orchestras and choirs of his day, his life is best remembered for this simple music so well suited to Scriven’s text.“\n\nLukas Media LLC releases the full-length documentary Friends in Jesus, The stories and Hymns of Cecil Frances Alexander and Joseph Scriven in 2011. The 45-minute documentary movie details the life of Scriven and his influence on popular hymns.\n\nShare this:\n\nThe Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to address the collapse of the British civilian administration in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence, receives royal assent on August 9, 1920, following a guillotine motion.\n\nIn effect a special extension of the Defence of the Realm Acts, the aim of the Act is to increase convictions of nationalist rebels while averting the need to declare martial law. Under Section 3(6) of the Act, military authorities are empowered to jail any Irish person without charge or trial. Secret courts-martial are established, and lawyers (appointed by Crown agents) can be present only if the death penalty is involved. Inquests of military or police actions are banned.\n\nBy the middle of 1920, Ireland is in the throes of a full-fledged rebellion that is barely recognized by the British Government in Ireland headquartered in Dublin Castle. The Irish Republican Army (IRA), the military arm of the Dáil Éireann revolutionary government, is engaged in a guerilla campaign to destroy elements of British power, particularly burning down courthouses and attacking members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), Britain’s police force in the countryside.\n\nThe British response to the increase in violence and the assassination of police officers is twofold. To suppress the IRA “murderers,” Major General Hugh Tudor, commander of the RIC and self-styled “Chief of Police,” begins supplementing that body with the employment of World War I veterans known as the “Black and Tans” because of the colour of their surplus World War I uniforms, and an additional temporary force of Auxiliaries. With little discipline and utter indifference to the plight or moral indignation of the Irish population, these groups raid and burn villages, creameries, and farm buildings to intimidate supporters of the IRA.\n\nThe second measure is the enactment of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act (ROIA). The Act is envisioned as a remedy to the problem perceived by Chief Secretary for Ireland Sir Hamar Greenwood that “throughout the greater part of Ireland criminal justice can no longer be administered by the ordinary constitutional process of trial by judge and jury.”\n\nThe genesis of the Act may be seen in a Cabinet discussion on May 31, 1920, in which the members focus on the violence in Ireland. Rather than addressing violence as the product of rebellion, Greenwood insists that, “The great task is to crush out murder and arson.” He asserts that the violence is perpetrated by handsomely paid thugs. Commenting on a pending Irish bill, Secretary of State for War Winston Churchill states, “You should include in the Bill a special tribunal for trying murderers. It is monstrous that we have some 200 murders, and no one hung.” The prime minister agrees that convicted murderers should be hanged but questions whether convictions can be obtained from Catholics. The concern of all is that the civil courts are incapable of strictly administering justice to the revolutionaries because the juries largely consisted of Irish Catholics. The ensuing discussion of possibly imposing court-martial jurisdiction is inconclusive.\n\nAfter the May 31 meeting, Greenwood investigates the feasibility of imposing martial law in Ireland and raises martial law as the specific subject of a July 23, 1920, conference committee meeting of the Cabinet led by Prime Minister David Lloyd George to which the key members of the Dublin Castle administration are invited. William E. Wylie, the law advisor at Dublin Castle, notes that the RIC is disintegrating through resignations brought on by terrorist attacks, and that with “regard to the Civil Courts, the entire administration of the Imperial Government had ceased.” The civilian participants from Dublin Castle, especially Wylie, maintain that martial law is counter-productive, and will only antagonize the Irish people. As an alternative to martial law, General Tudor argues for the imposition of court-martial jurisdiction. Tudor argues forcefully that court-martial jurisdiction over all crimes will support the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries that he is recruiting. He declaims that “not a single criminal had been brought to justice for murder.” Lloyd George closes the discussion directing the Dublin Castle participants to provide final proposals for enforcement of the laws.\n\nA draft bill to establish military criminal jurisdiction is considered by the Cabinet on July 26. The prime minister’s most telling contribution is his question as to whether a convicted man would be shot or hanged. It appears that he is comforted by the response that the defendant will be tried under the ordinary law which implies death by hanging. The resulting bill is completed by July 30, 1920, and is then quickly pushed through Parliament and receives royal assent on August 9, 1920. The ROIA provides that all crimes punishable under the laws in Ireland can be brought before a court-martial. The court-martial will have the power to impose any punishment authorized by statute or common law including the death penalty. The final step is taken on August 20, 1920, when the final regulations for implementation go into effect.\n\nThe combination of growing police and military pressure and recourse to the ROIA lead to increased internments of known or suspected IRA members and a steady increase in convictions to 50-60 per week. This makes it more difficult for IRA soldiers to continue openly working day jobs while carrying on part-time guerrilla activities. As a result, the IRA shifts its approach to guerrilla warfare in the rural counties. Volunteers from IRA units are organized into elite, full-time, mobile flying columns of around 25 men who live off the land and on the run. These flying columns prove to be more suited to ambushes of patrols and convoys and other targets of opportunity, rather than attacks on barracks which had become better defended.\n\nOn December 10, 1920, martial law is proclaimed in counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary. In January 1921 martial law is extended to counties Clare and Waterford.\n\nIn a crucial judgement, R (Egan) v Macready, the Irish courts rule that the Act does not give power to impose the death penalty. This would no doubt have proved politically contentious had not hostilities ended the same day.\n\nDespite its name, the courts are of the view that ROIA applies in England as well. Following the creation of the Irish Free State, when the Act is repealed by implication, it is still used to deport ex-members of the Irish Self-Determination League to Ireland.\n\nShare this:\n\nPatrick Devlin, guitarist and singer, is born in Dublin on August 8, 1967. He currently fronts Blaggards, an American Celtic rock band based in Houston, Texas. The Houston Press describes Blaggards as “H-town’s heir to the emerald throne of Phil Lynott and Shane MacGowan.”\n\nGrowing up in Dublin, Devlin listens to and is influenced by Irish rebel music and heavy metal bands like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden.\n\nAfter moving to Houston in 1994, Devlin tends bar in Irish pubs and music venues for a number of years before starting his first band. From his perspective behind the bar, he realizes there is a local demand for Irish rock music that nobody is fulfilling. In 1996, to this end he forms a band called On the Dole. Although the band does well for several years, opening for legendary Irish touring acts like The Wolfe Tones and The Saw Doctors, eventually he decides it is time to clear the decks and start again.\n\nIn 2003, while hosting a weekly open mic at an Irish pub, Devlin meets bassist and singer Chad Smalley, son of Nobel laureate Richard Smalley and a veteran of the Houston music scene who had recently returned from New York and is looking for a new project. The two of them soon begin singing and performing together every week, developing a tight vocal harmony style.\n\nIn July 2004, Devlin and Smalley form Blaggards, along with violinist Turi Hoiseth and drummer Brian Vogel. Hoiseth and Vogel have since left the band, leaving Devlin and Smalley as the only original members.\n\nBlaggards tours nationally and internationally. They perform at South by Southwest in 2008, where they are the only Celtic-based act on the official schedule. Their music has been played on the Sirius Satellite Radio program Celtic Crush, hosted by Larry Kirwan of Black 47. In 2013 he includes their recording of “The Irish Rover” on his compilation album Larry Kirwan’s Celtic Invasion.\n\nThe song “Big Strong Man” from Blaggards’ first album Standards (2005) appears in the 2010 British film The Kid, directed by Nick Moran.\n\n“Big Strong Man” and “Drunken Sailor” (also from Standards) are both featured in episode 86 of the CBS series The Good Wife, aired on March 24, 2013.\n\nBlaggards’ second album, Live in Texas, is released in 2010. It is a recording of a live performance at Houston’s Continental Club on June 13, 2009. The band’s latest album, Blagmatic, is released on July 14, 2021.\n\nBlaggards, with Arizona-based fiddle player Heide Riggs and drummer Kevin “Turbo” Newton in the current lineup, continue to maintain a rigorous schedule, playing constantly throughout Texas and touring nationally several times a year. Beginning in 2010 (excluding the COVID years), the band does a 10-day Ireland tour every year in the early fall.\n\nShare this:\n\nOn August 6, 1998, Irish Olympic swimming champion Michelle de Bruin is banned from swimming for four years after being found guilty of tampering with a drug test. The International Swimming Federation says she used alcohol to tamper with urine samples taken the previous January at her home as part of the out-of-competition doping control programme run by FINA, the world governing body of swimming.\n\nDe Bruin is the golden girl of Irish swimming, winning three medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Her performances in Atlanta give rise to much muted comment about a dramatic improvement in her times. U.S. swimmer and then world record holder Janet Evans is more vocal, stating at one press conference that the Irish swimmer’s performance is “questionable and suspicious.” Supporters decry the comments as jealousy. At the same time, the Irish media does not cover itself in glory with the national broadcaster RTÉ apparently decreeing that comment about possible drug taking should not be referenced by commentators.\n\nFINA says her urine sample shows “unequivocal signs of adulteration” and has an alcohol content (to mask drug taking) that is “compatible with physical manipulation.”\n\nDe Bruin confirms a challenge to the ban at a news conference on Friday, August 7. It continues her emphatic and repeated claims that she has never breached drug rules. Her sister, Aisling Smith, speaking from the family home in Rathcoole, on the outskirts of Dublin, says, “Michelle is determined to fight it through.”\n\nDe Bruin competes under her maiden name of Smith at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and wins gold medals in the 400m individual medley, 400m freestyle, and the 200m individual medley. She wins a bronze medal in the 200m butterfly event.\n\nReacting to news of the ban, Irish Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation Dr. Jim McDaid says it is a personal tragedy for the swimmer and her family. Taking time out from government business in Reykjavik, Iceland, he says, that like the rest of the Irish people, he is “saddened and disappointed” at the ban and hopes that the Olympic champion can establish her innocence.\n\nA four-year ban from any national or international swimming contest at De Bruin’s age of 28 effectively ends her swimming career. She could also be stripped of the four medals – two gold, two silver – she won at the 1997 European Aquatics Championships in Seville, Spain.\n\nAt a later conference, Evans highlights that the accusations of de Bruin’s doping had been heard by her poolside. De Bruin later receives an apology from Evans.\n\nDe Bruin never returns to competitive swimming and later works as a barrister, practising under her married name. Despite the ban for manipulating samples, none of Smith’s swimming achievements have been annulled, and she remains Ireland’s most successful Olympian.\n\nHer coach and husband, Erik de Bruin, previously serves a four-year ban for using illegal drugs during his career as a discus thrower.\n\nShare this:\n\nJohn Havelock Nelson, composer and conductor, dies in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on August 5, 1996. He makes an immense contribution to the development of the cultural life of the province – and beyond – over the second half of the 20th century.\n\nNelson is born of middle-class parents in Cork, County Cork, on May 25, 1917, his distinctive forename being taken from a cousin of his mother who lost his life in World War I. Despite his birthplace, both his parents’ ancestral roots lie firmly in Northern Ireland.\n\nNelson’s father Robert comes from Larne, County Antrim, where he was raised. However, the early years of his mother Grace are quite eventful. She is born in the Belgian Congo on account of her father’s placement there as a missionary in the latter years of the 19th century (his family hail from Tobermore, County Londonderry). She is eventually sent home at an early age, due to the threat of malaria, and is raised in Belfast by an aunt and uncle who have no family of their own. It appears that Nelson inherits his musical genes from both parents. Although his father is trained as a chartered accountant, he is a capable baritone singer who studies in the early 1900s with C. J. Brennan, later to become the organist and choirmaster at St. Anne’s Cathedral, Belfast). Meanwhile, his mother shows talent as a pianist during her upbringing in her adopted city and by her early 20s is offering her services as an accompanist.\n\nBy chance, this is how his parents meet. They marry in 1916, shortly before their arrival in Cork where Robert takes up his first accountancy job. Within a month of Nelson’s birth, the family moves to Dublin where his father has secured a better post, eventually settling near Dún Laoghaire, just south of the capital city. From the age of five, now the eldest of four brothers born a year apart, he starts piano lessons and makes such rapid progress that, by the age of ten, he is able to play in a piano trio and to accompany his father in informal concerts. By the age of twelve, he wins a scholarship to the Royal Irish Academy of Music, Dublin, giving him the opportunity to study piano and theory and helping him to establish his core musical skills. Soon he adds conducting and organ lessons to his study programme.\n\nAs far as Nelson’s general education is concerned, this is completed at St. Andrew’s College, Dublin, where he excels in English, history and the sciences. By his late teens, he is determined to pursue a professional career as a musician. His father, however, exercises caution in this regard, advising him to take a science degree in the first instance. Consequently, he gains entry to Trinity College Dublin (TCD) in 1935 to read Natural Science, then makes a decision the following year to change to Medical Science. By 1939, he completes his primary degree in Medical Science, leading to doctoral research in bacteriology. At the same time, he begins a 4-year music degree at TCD while remaining musically active outside the university in relation to his piano studies, and also co-founds and conducts the Dublin Orchestral Players, a body that continues to provide an invaluable platform for amateur performers. He completes his university studies in 1943, graduating with a PhD in Medical Science and a primary Music degree. Seven years later he also completes a doctorate in Music from the same university.\n\nHis university career now behind him, like many fellow Irishmen, Nelson feels a desire to contribute to the World War II effort and applies for a commission in the medical branch of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1944. Eventually, he is called up and located at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire, where he remains until after the end of the War, only returning to Dublin for his marriage in 1945. By nature, an outgoing, sociable person, he wastes no time in immersing himself in music-making activities when off duty, both inside and outside his RAF base. It is during this immediate post-war period that he becomes convinced that he wants to pursue a career in music. By chance, his attention is drawn to a BBC advertisement regarding a number of regional posts for staff accompanists, including Northern Ireland. His application is successful, and he reports for duty at BBC Northern Ireland in March 1947, where he remains for the next 30 years. In his new post, his main role is to play and accompany on the piano. To this end, he becomes involved in a number of new radio programmes, notably Children’s Hour. Elsewhere, he composes and arranges music for adult dramas and serials, the best known being The McCooeys. Another responsibility is to assist in auditioning local musicians for broadcasting opportunities, a process that uncovers much local talent, including a young James Galway. While his activities revolve around radio work in the 1950s, the next 20 years embrace opportunities arising from the new medium of television, including the popular Songs of Praise which involve him as conductor.\n\nNelson’s decision to retire from the BBC in 1977 enables him to focus fully on his free-lance career which had been running parallel, up until then, with his broadcasting work. In this capacity he is able to give full rein to his diverse range of musical skills as choral and orchestral conductor, chamber musician, music-festival adjudicator, composer and arranger. One should not overlook his role as animateur in founding the Studio Symphony Orchestra (1947) and the Studio Opera Group (1950). Both became integral parts of the local cultural scene during Nelson’s lifetime. His contribution as a festival adjudicator is an important activity, notably when undertaking tours abroad, including to Canada and the Caribbean. His visits to the latter area lead him to form the Trinidad and Tobago Opera Company shortly after his BBC retirement. In his busy lifestyle, he makes time to satisfy his creative energy as a composer and arranger. In total he publishes over 100 pieces, many inspired by his love of Irish traditional song and are of short duration and scored for a variety of vocal combinations. His enjoyment of his reputation as a piano accompanist of international standing is confirmed by his association with some of the leading Irish and British professional singers of the period, including Bernadette Greevy (soprano), Margaret Marshall (soprano), Peter Pears (tenor) and Ian Wallace (bass-baritone).\n\nDuring his lifetime, Nelson’s outstanding services to music, both inside and outside the province, are recognised by a number of awards. The first of these is an OBE in 1966, followed in the latter part of his life by four honorary doctorates, three from local universities. A gifted and versatile musician, his personality is described by one colleague as “magnetic”- he has the unique ability to reach out to everybody irrespective of their age, status and position in life in whatever role he performs. In his best-known role as a conductor, a critic says of him that, “Dr. Nelson has a remarkable touch in getting people to do what he wants in the pleasantest way possible.” His vision and determination help to establish a vibrant music culture throughout Northern Ireland, an achievement that will remain his lasting legacy.\n\nNelson is survived by his three children and eight grandchildren; his wife Hazel having predeceased him in 1983.\n\n(From: “John Havelock Nelson (1917-1996),” Dictionary of Ulster Biography, http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk)\n\nShare this:"
