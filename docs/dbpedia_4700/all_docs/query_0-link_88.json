        "text": "Varadkar first served as Taoiseach from 2017 to 2020, holding the role again from December 2022 until now.\n\nHe served as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from June 2020 to December 2022.\n\nHe also previously served as Minister for Social Protection (2016 to 2017), Minister for Health (2014 to 2016), and Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (2011 to 2014).\n\nIn his statement, Varadkar said he knows his announcement “will come as a surprise to many and a disappointment to some”.\n\nHe has asked Fine Gael’s General Secretary and Executive Council to provide for the new Leader to be elected in advance of the party’s Ard Fheis on Saturday, 6 April, thus allowing a new Taoiseach to be elected when the Dáil resumes after the Easter break.\n\nHe said: “There is never a ‘right time’ to resign high office. However, this is as good a time as any – Budget 2024 is done, and negotiations have not yet commenced on the next one.\n\n“The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are working again, and our trading relationship with the United Kingdom, in the post-Brexit era, is settled and stable.\n\n“The new Taoiseach will have a full two months to prepare for the Local and European Elections, and up to a year before the next General Election.\n\n“My reasons for stepping down now are personal and political, but mainly political.\n\n“I believe this Government can be re-elected. I believe my Party, Fine Gael, can gain seats in the next Dáil. Most of all, I believe that would be the right thing for the future of our country, continuing to take us forward. Protecting what we achieved and building on it.”\n\nHe continued: “After careful consideration and some soul-searching, I believe a new Taoiseach will be better-placed than me to achieve that – to renew and strengthen the top team, to refocus our message and policies, and to drive implementation.\n\n“After seven years in office, I am no longer the best person for that job.\n\n“There are loyal colleagues and good friends contesting the Local & European Elections and I want to give them the best chance possible. I think they will now have a better chance under a new Leader.\n\n“In standing aside, I can do so in the absolute confidence that the country and the economy are in a good place, and that my colleagues in the Government from all three parties, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, and the Oireachtas will continue to work hard for the nation’s best interests.\n\n“On a personal level, I have enjoyed being Taoiseach, Leader and a Cabinet member since March 2011. I have learned so much about so many things, met people who I would never have got to meet, been to places I would never have seen, both home and abroad. I am deeply grateful for it and would wholeheartedly recommend a career in politics to anyone considering it.\n\n“However, politicians are human beings. We have our limitations. We give it everything until we can’t anymore and then we have to move on.\n\n“I will, of course, continue to fulfil my duties as Taoiseach until a new Taoiseach is elected and will remain as a constituency TD for Dublin West.\n\n“I know, inevitably, there will be speculation as to the ‘real reason’ for my decision. These are the real reasons. That’s it. I have nothing else lined up or in mind. No definite personal or political plans, but I am looking forward to having the time to think about them.\n\n“I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Party, my coalition partners Micheál [Martin] and Eamon [Ryan], Constituents, colleagues and staff for their loyalty and their phenomenal work, and will also thank them in person in the near future.\n\n“Most of all, I’d like to finish by thanking the people of Ireland for giving me the opportunity to serve them. I promise I will keep working for Ireland and my community in any way I can in the future.”\n\nFine Gael, of course, haven’t elected a new leader since 2017 when Enda Kenny stepped down, making way for Varadkar.\n\nKenny’s departure had long been expected but the veteran Mayo TD repeatedly refused to say when exactly he would step aside.\n\nHe eventially told voters he would not seek a third term as Taoiseach in advance of 2016′s spring general election. From the following summer, some party members were vocal in stating they wanted a clear indication of when he would be stepping down.\n\nThe then-Taoiseach, who was also the longest-serving TD in the Dáil, faced down the threat of a motion of no confidence and chose to ignore calls from some younger members of the party who took to the airwaves to say his position was untenable.\n\nHowever, in the background of all this, Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, the apparent front-runners to take his job, were getting in election mode.\n\nVaradkar walked the subsequent election campaign and became Taoiseach on 14 June 2017.\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood has paid tribute to Varadkar’s service as Taoiseach, following the announcement of his resignation.\n\nEastwood said that Varadkar was a “strong voice for people in Northern Ireland” during the Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe SDLP leader also said that “as an LGBT+ leader from a minority ethnic community”, Varadkar also provided “visibility and inspiration to many across our Island who have not felt represented in the institutions of Government before”.\n\nSpeaking further on Varadkar’s contributions to Brexit negotiations, Eastwood said:\n\n“Having taken office at a fractious moment in the politics of our island and during a period of turbulence in the British/Irish relationship, he has undoubtedly played an important role providing encouragement and support for the North.\n\n“During two periods of difficulty for devolution, the Taoiseach worked hard to support the restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. Beyond warm words of encouragement, he has committed measurable resource to critical projects in the North that will bring communities closer together.”\n\nHow will the new Fine Gael leader be elected and when will we have a new Taoiseach?\n\nEach party has different ways and means of electing its leaders, and the rules for Fine Gael are defined with Rule 49 of the Fine Gael Constitution and Rules.\n\nIt states that candidates must be members of Dáil Éireann and must be nominated in writing by at least 10% of the Parliamentary Party within seven days of the vacancy arising.\n\nThis means at least 10 Fine Gael TDs or Senators would needed for a candidate to be nominated.\n\nThat rule outlines that party leaders are elected via an Electoral College system, consisting of the Parliamentary Party (TDs, Senators and MEPs), public representatives (councillors), and any other party members.\n\nA voting weight is attached to each grouping, which goes as follows:\n\nParliamentary party 65%\n\nParty membership 25%\n\nCouncillors 10%\n\nDiarmuid Pepper breaks it down in full here.\n\nGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan has offered his “sincere thanks” to Varadkar for his work as Taoiseach.\n\nRyan said his coalition colleague “has been an energetic and committed leader of the country who was always supportive of his government colleagues”.\n\n“It’s worth noting that the agreement at the start of this Government was between the three coalition parties, not the three leaders. That agreement stands, particularly in light of the important work that this Government has to do.\n\n“The Green Party looks forward to the the conclusion of the Fine Gael leadership contest and the election of a new Taoiseach by Dáil Éireann.\n\nIn the interim, the important work of Government continues and the three coalition parties will continue to fulfil our mandate, just as we have done over the last three and a half years.\n\n“I would like to offer my good wishes to Leo as he prepares to depart the Taoiseach’s office. He has served the country well and can be proud of the contribution he has made to Irish political life.”\n\nIn her first remarks since Varadkar’s shock announcement, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said we are at “a critical moment in Irish politics”.\n\nSpeaking directly to Varadkar during Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil, McDonald said the decision of who will run the country “must be placed in the hands of the people”.\n\n“Today’s announcement can have only one conclusion – the calling of a general election,” she said.\n\n“Another Fine Gael Taoiseach is not what people want,” she told the Dáil, adding that the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-Green coalition has “run out of steam and run out of road”.\n\nVaradkar reiterated that he does not intent to call an election in the immediate future.\n\nReplying to McDonald, he said: “There will be a general election within a year, there has to be.”\n\nPeople Before Profit-Solidarity TD Richard Boyd Barrett is up next. He also wants a general election to be called.\n\nReferring to Fine Gael electing a new leader, and therefore a new Taoiseach, he told the Dáil:\n\nWe don’t need a shifting of the deck chairs on the Titanic.\n\nHe said, given how rich Ireland is, it’s “shameful” that we have such a massive homelessness crisis. He criticised how the Government has handled issues like hospital overcrowding and disability services.\n\nHe said it’s also shameful that tens of thousands of young people don’t think they have a future in Ireland and instead are choosing to emigrate.\n\n“The people, not Fine Gael, should now decide who leads the next government,” he said.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Labour Leader Ivana Bacik said it is “utterly untenable that we would see this Government remain in office” after today’s “deeply destabilising news”.\n\n“The resignation of An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar underscores the urgent need for the people, not Fine Gael, to determine the future leadership of our country.\n\nIt is not the prerogative of any one party to dictate who should lead Ireland. The people must decide who is best equipped to address the pressing issues facing our nation.\n\n“To solve the housing crisis, to end child poverty, and to reduce hospital waiting lists, we need visionary leadership focused on the needs of the people. Fine Gael’s tenure has seen these challenges persist and worsen. It’s time for a new approach, one driven by compassion, innovation, and a genuine commitment to the well-being of all citizens.\n\n“And how can Fianna Fáil and the Green Party prop up this chaos? The only way to ensure that the people’s voices are heard and their concerns addressed is through a general election. Fine Gael need to do the right thing and go to the people now,” Bacik said in a statement issued in the last few minutes.\n\nWe have a round-up of the opposition members calling for a general election here.\n\nThe publication of a landmark report from the TDs and senators on the Assisted Dying Committee has been somewhat overshadowed today by the announcement of Varadkar’s resignation.\n\nOur reporter Eimer McAuley was the only reporter to attend the launch of the report in the AV Room at Leinster House this afternoon.\n\nYou can find our initial piece on the report here. Eimer will have more on the subject on the site later this evening, but in the meantime she’s sent this on for the liveblog:\n\nThe committee’s report on assisted dying has recommended that the Government introduces legislation allowing the practice, but not without a long list of safeguards.\n\nThe move is a significant development and could see laws introduced that campaigners - including the late Marie Fleming – have fought long and hard for.\n\nPoliticians at the launch event today acknowledged that introducing this legislation will in all likelihood be a matter for the next Government.\n\nSinn Féin Health spokesperson David Cullinane said that these laws “cannot be rushed”.\n\nWhen asked if Leo Varadkar’s resignation as Taoiseach had taken away attention from the important work of the committee, Fine Gael Senator Mary Seery-Kearny said that the two issues should not be connected, and that committee reports are published regularly within the Oireachtas.\n\nSolidarity-People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny said the Taoiseach’s resignation has inevitably “taken away some of the shine” from the committee’s report.\n\nFianna Fáil TD John Lahart acknowledged that it has been a struggle to get the public and media to engage with this complex and emotive topic, and voiced his view that the nature of legislation on assisted dying should be put before “the public” at some stage – a suggestion that raised eyebrows, and is not part of the report’s recommendations.\n\nThe report recommends many different restrictions that should be put in place before someone would be able to avail of assisted dying, and also recommends that if any person fails to adhere to assisted dying laws, it would be a criminal offence.\n\nTD Michael Healy-Rae and Senator Rónán Mullen are set to launch their alternative report, which posits that assisted dying should not be legislated for, shortly."
