        "text": "Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter): As the Deputy will be aware, the catchment area served by the Drug Treatment Court was significantly expanded with effect from July 2011 and the Court is now in a position to deal with offenders from a much wider area including offenders who are resident in all areas of Dublin north of the river Liffey and to offenders receiving treatment in the Castle Street Drug Treatment Centre which provides services to people residing in Dublin 2,4,6 and 8. Not all of the Dublin North West constituency was within the catchment area of the Court prior to 2011. Details are provided in the table below of the numbers of people referred to the Drug Treatment Court Programme with an address in the Dublin North West Constituency."
