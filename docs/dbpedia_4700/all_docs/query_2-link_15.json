These guidelines are concerned with the statutory obligations for candidates, national agents, designated persons and persons unconnected to a political party or candidate (third parties) at the forthcoming local elections and are issued pursuant to section 18(6) of the Act.\n\nSpending limits, first introduced for the 2009 local elections, were revised by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. The limit depends on the population of the local electoral area, as follows:\n\nPopulation and Candidate Spending Limit\n\nLocal Electoral Area Candidate Spending Limit Population in excess of 35,000 15,350 Euro Population between 18,001 and 35,000 13,600 Euro Population of 18,000 or less 11,500 Euro\n\nCandidates nominated by a political party are deemed to automatically allocate 10% of their spending limit to the party’s national agent. For example, a party candidate with a limit of 15,350 euro would be deemed to automatically allocate 1,535 euro for use by the party. Their effective limit would therefore be 13,818 euro. The 10% figure can be varied upwards or downwards by written agreement between the candidate and national agent.\n\nElection spending incurred during a period before the election must be reported to the local authority concerned and must be below the specified limit. The date of commencement of the spending period is set out in S.I. No. 135 of 2024 made by the Minister on 9th April 2024 and fixes the period as the 8th April 2024 to 7th June 2024.\n\nFull details of the Guidelines for Candidates on the Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure, Spending Limits and Political Donation Accounts at the Local Elections on 7 June 2024 are available here (An Ghaeilge).\n\nFor the 2024 Local Elections candidates, national agents and designated persons of political parties, and third parties must submit to Dublin City Council a statement of all election expenses incurred, and a statutory declaration to the effect that to the best of their knowledge the statement is correct and that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure its accuracy. Election spending incurred between April 8th, 2024 and polling day on June 7th 2024 (inclusive), must be included on the declaration form submitted. For the 2024 local elections, spending limits will apply to electoral expenditure by candidates and political parties. Each candidate of a political party is deemed to automatically allocate 10% of the applicable spending limit to his or her political party. The maximum expenditure that the national agent can incur is the aggregate of the amounts allocated by his or her party’s candidates (either by way of the 10% automatically allocated, or alternative amounts agreed in writing between the national agent and candidate). Full details of the National Agents and Designated Persons of Political Parties and Third Parties on the Disclosure of Election Expenditure, Spending Limits and Political Donation Accounts at the Local Elections on 7 June 2024 are available here(An Ghaeilge).\n\nDonations\n\nThe following rules apply for donations:\n\nThe maximum amount that can be accepted in the same calendar year by a member of a local authority or by a local election candidate from the same source is 1,000 euro.\n\nDetails of donations which exceed 600 euro must be disclosed in a statement made to the local authority.\n\nA candidate or member of a local authority who receives a monetary donation that exceeds 100 euro must open and maintain a political donations account in a financial institution.\n\nCertain donations are restricted:\n\nIt is prohibited to accept a donation from an anonymous source which exceeds 100 euro.\n\nDonations in cash which exceed 200 euro are also prohibited.\n\nThere are specific rules covering corporate donations which exceed 200 euro – the donor must be registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission and evidence that the donation was approved by the corporate body must be provided."
