        "text": "Announcing his retirement, Deputy Ring said serving as an elected representative for 45 years, first on Westport Town Council, then Mayo County Council, and for the past 30 years in Dáil Éireann, has been the “privilege of my life.”\n\n“After much consideration and reflection with my family and supporters, I have decided that I will not be seeking a nomination to contest the next General Election.\n\n“It is important to me to express my gratitude to all of you who have supported me and canvassed for me since I first ran for election back in 1979,” said Deputy Ring.\n\nDuring his time in politics, he held various roles including Minister of State for Tourism and Sport, Minister for Regional Economic Development and Minister for Community and Rural Development.\n\nReflecting on his three decades in the Dáil, Deputy Ring said he is proud of the significant developments and investments he secured for Mayo and beyond, in his time as Minister.\n\n\"Initiatives such as The Gathering, The Wild Atlantic Way, and Ireland’s Ancient East have revitalised tourism and created thousands of jobs.\n\n\"Re-opening the Sports Capital Programme, as well as setting up the Rural Regeneration ad Development Fund (RRDF) and Sport Ireland, have transformed communities across the country.\n\n“In Mayo, we have witnessed transformative projects like the Connaught GAA Centre of Excellence, the redevelopment of Ballintubber Abbey, investment in the Wild Nephin Ballycroy National Park, and enhancements to local sports facilities and greenways.\n\n“Achievements like the Lough Mask to Westport Water Scheme, various sewerage schemes, and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme are milestones I hold dear.\n\n“The trust and support from my constituents has been humbling and inspiring,” said Deputy Ring.\n\nHe continued by voicing his pride in the Fine Gael party and said he believes the party boasts strong leadership in Taoiseach Simon Harris, and a dynamic team of ministers.\n\n“We have enjoyed great success in recent elections, and I am confident in our prospects moving forward.\n\n\"Here in Mayo, we have done great work and I am confident that we will maintain and build on our seats in the next General Election and contribute to Fine Gael securing another term in Government.\n\n\"I will be doing everything here in Mayo to contribute to this.\n\n“In closing, I want to extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to the people of Mayo.\n\n\"Your trust and support has allowed me to serve you, and I am eternally grateful. Representing you has been an honour and I am proud of what we have accomplished together,” said Deputy Ring.\n\nSince the announcement, tributes have been pouring in for Deputy Ring.\n\nAn Taoiseach Simon Harris has paid a warm tribute to Deputy Ring and described him as a ‘remarkable politician of national importance and representative of his beloved county Mayo’.\n\n“Though fiercely loyal to the West, he is known all over this country for his work ethic, his effectiveness, his deep-rooted connection with his constituents and his ability to communicate with wit and charm like no other politician of his generation.\n\n“Michael has had a long and distinguished career representing the Fine Gael party for five decades.\n\nHe has served as an elected representative for 45 years, first starting out on Westport Town Council, then Mayo County Council and for the past 30 years in Dáil Éireann.\n\n“He served as the first ever Minister for Community and Rural Development, championing the voice of rural Ireland and ensuring it was always heard in the corridors of power.\n\n“He also served as Minister of State for Tourism and Sport and Minister for Regional Economic Development.\n\n“Michael got involved in politics to help people and nothing was ever more important to him than the people of Mayo which led him to secure significant investments for his county.\n\n“He has never wavered in his belief in rural Ireland and his constituents never doubted his ability to get things done. His legacy is evident to us all as we travel around the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's ancient East.\n\n“Indeed, Michael Ring will go down in history as one of this country’s best-loved and most effective local representatives who made waves on the national stage.\n\n“As a colleague, he will be sorely missed in the halls of Leinster House.\n\n“I hope it is a long and happy retirement and that we continue to benefit from his knowledge, humour and compassion.\n\n“To one of Mayo’s finest, I say thank you,” said Mr Harris.\n\nHis FG Dáil colleague in Mayo, Minister of State Alan Dillon, praised Ring's legacy in his home county.\n\n“As a colleague, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Michael for his outstanding contributions throughout his distinguished political career.\n\n“Michael has been a brilliant TD, minister and representative for Mayo, consistently championing rural and community development.\n\n“Michael’s departure will be a significant loss to Fine Gael, to public life and marks the end of an era. He has certainly earned a well-deserved retirement with his wife Anne and family.\n\n“Michael’s career is a testament to his tireless work ethic and years of sacrifice. His dedication has left an indelible mark on our county, and his achievements will be remembered for years to come,” said Mr Dillon.\n\nMr Dillon said Michael has been an invaluable mentor, trusted friend, and supportive colleague.\n\n\"I have always valued his guidance and advice and am deeply grateful for the knowledge he has shared. We have worked on numerous projects to improve our constituents’ lives, and I look forward to continuing to work alongside him during his remaining time in the Oireachtas,” concluded Mr Dillon.\n\nMEP Maria Walsh described Deputy Ring’s career as ‘outstanding’ and said he will be missed in politics.\n\n“His warmth and colourful political speeches always had a singular goal, giving voice to his constituents.\n\n“Wishing you well Michael. Thank you for all your support over the years.”\n\nLocal Councillor Gerry Coyle said ‘they don’t make them like ‘The Ringer’ anymore.’\n\n\"First and foremost, I want to say thank you to my friend and colleague Michael Ring for his service to this area, County and Country.\n\n\"The passion and virtue of this man won’t be seen again in politics.\n\n\"There aren’t enough words to describe Michael, he’s caring, compassionate, patient, witty, helpful and unbelievably hard working.\n\n\"Throughout his many years representing his constituents he has really and truly given it everything.\n\nReferring to their ‘strong working and personal relationship’, Cllr Coyle said “there is nobody I would rather have in my corner, be it politically or personally, than Michael Ring.”\n\n\"Michael is without doubt one of the hardest working politicians I’ve ever met but credit must also go to Michael’s wife Ann, the driving force behind Michael and a wonderful public servant.\n\n\"Thank you Ann for all all of your help and assistance over the years. Indeed thank you and best wishes to all of the staff of the office, particularly Maggie and Suzanne.\n\n“I won’t lie, I am selfishly sad that Michael has announced his departure from politics, I will miss working closely with him but I wish him and his family nothing but health and happiness for the future.
