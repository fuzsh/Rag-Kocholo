History and boundaries

It is located in the southern part of South Dublin county. A constituency of this name was first created in the 1940s and was used for elections from 1948 to 1973 inclusive.[1] The original constituency was based around the areas of Ballyfermot, Crumlin and Kilmainham.[2] The constituency was then abolished and was mostly replaced by the Dublin Ballyfermot constituency. In its current incarnation the seat was created in 1981 and had completely different boundaries from the original pre-1977 constituency, being based around the areas of Clondalkin, Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart, Tallaght, Templeogue, and parts of Terenure.[3]

In 1998, it was reduced in size and electorate, losing territory, including Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart and Clondalkin, to the new Dublin Mid West seat. Major areas today include Tallaght and surrounding localities, Firhouse and parts of Terenure.[4]

The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009 defines the constituency as:

"In the county of South Dublin the electoral divisions of:

Ballinascorney, Bohernabreena, Firhouse Village, Tallaght-Avonbeg, Tallaght-Belgard, Tallaght-Fettercairn, Tallaght-Glenview, Tallaght-Jobstown, Tallaght-Killinardan, Tallaght-Kiltipper, Tallaght-Kingswood, Tallaght-Millbrook, Tallaght-Oldbawn, Tallaght-Springfield, Tallaght-Tymon, Templeogue-Cypress, Templeogue-Limekiln, Templeogue-Orwell, Templeogue-Osprey, Templeogue Village, Terenure-St. James;

and those parts of the electoral divisions of Clondalkin-Ballymount and Tallaght-Kilnamanagh situated west of a line drawn along the M50 Western Parkway."[4]

Constituency profile

The constituency leans towards left wing parties such as the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. Both Labour party TD's elected in 2011 had been members of other left wing parties Pat Rabbitte of the Workers' Party of Ireland and Democratic Left, and Eamonn Maloney was a member of the Jim Kemmy's Democratic Socialist Party. The constituency is noted for its volatility: in the past three general elections, the poll topper from the previous election lost his seat, Brian Hayes in 2002, Seán Crowe in 2007 and Conor Lenihan in 2011.[5]
