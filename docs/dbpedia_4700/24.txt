2011 general election

The 2007 report of the Constituency Commission,[2] an independent body established by the Government of Ireland to review constituency boundaries, proposed several changes to Dáil constituencies. These changes were provided for by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2009. In July 2011 the Irish government established a commission to review to the current Dáil and European constituencies.[3]

This table summarises the changes in representation. It does not address revisions to the boundaries of constituencies.

Historic changes

2007 general election

Main article: Irish general election, 2007

In 2004 the report of the Constituency Commission,[4] proposed major changes to Dáil constituencies. Five new constituencies were created under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2005:

Longford–Westmeath (4)

Meath East (3)

Meath West (3)

Roscommon–South Leitrim (3)

Sligo–North Leitrim (3)

These replaced the four existing constituencies of Longford–Roscommon, Meath, Sligo–Leitrim and Westmeath. These new changes resulted in the creation of a 43rd constituency and the removal of the provincial boundary breach between Leinster and Connacht.

The number of seats was reduced in two constituencies:

Cork North–Central (from 5 to 4)

Dublin North–Central (from 4 to 3)

Two three-seater constituencies gained an extra seat:

Dublin Mid–West (from 3 to 4)

Kildare North (from 3 to 4)

There were further smaller boundary changes to eleven constituencies outside Dublin, these were: Clare, Cork North–West, Cork South–Central, Cork South–West, Donegal North–East, Donegal South–West, Kerry North, Kerry South, Kildare South, Limerick East and Limerick West.

Boundaries for ten of the twelve Dublin constituencies were also revised apart from Dublin South–East and Dún Laoghaire.
