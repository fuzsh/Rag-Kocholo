“Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad” province is one of the provinces that has an attractive nature due to its location among the Zagros Mountains and abundant rainfall. In this small province you can see a wide range of natural attractions. Rushing rivers, dense forests and tall waterfalls are among the sights of this beautiful province.

In the west of “Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad” province and near Khuzestan province, one of the beautiful and famous natural phenomena in the region can be observed. A lake surrounded by the Zagros Mountains, which can be seen as a colorful gem. This lake is called “Barm-Alwan” and is one of the most important attractions in the region and many people come to visit it.

Lake “Barm-Alwan” is located 220 km from Yasuj and 34 km west of Landeh and there is no need to walk to visit it. “Barm-Alwan” is not a big lake. The approximate diameter of the lake is about 500 meters and its water is supplied by rainfall and springs at the bottom of the lake. The lake is surrounded by lush trees and in some parts you can see a bunch of reeds that have become a place for birds to live. In the corners of the lake you can see beautiful birds that are resting and feeding.

This lake is located in the tropical climate of “Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad” province and its attractiveness decreases with the arrival of early summers. That’s why the best time to visit it is early spring. There are no amenities near the lake and it is better to take all the necessities of a long trip with you.
