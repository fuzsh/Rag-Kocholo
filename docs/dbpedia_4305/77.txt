Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad is one of the southwestern provinces of Iran, renowned for its pristine and captivating natural attractions, abundant rivers, and hospitable people.

History

The land where Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province is currently located has ancient roots, but the formation of this province within the current administrative divisions dates back to less than fifty years ago. The Boyer-Ahmad tribe, the original inhabitants of this province, gained significant power during the Qajar period and spent a considerable amount of time consolidating their power through internal and ethnic conflicts. During the Pahlavi era, parts of this province were part of Fars Province, and other parts belonged to Khuzestan Province until this region was upgraded to a province called Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad in 1963. It eventually became an independent province in 1355 S, Khordad (June 1976). The name of this province is derived from one of its natural features, namely the mountain of "Jilu" or "Gilu," and the name of one of the tribes residing in this area, the Boyer-Ahmad tribe.

Geography

Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province is bordered by Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province to the north, Fars and Bushehr Provinces to the south, Isfahan and Fars Provinces to the east, and Khuzestan Province to the west. This province has a mountainous and elevated terrain, encompassing the Zagros Mountains with parallel ranges stretching across the north and east, as well as the Khayiz, Nil, Siah, and Sefid Mountains in its southeast. Mount Dena, one of the highest peaks in the southern Zagros, is located in this province. Rivers such as Marun, Bishar, Zohreh, Khersan, and Nazmakan flow through this province.

Climate

The peculiar distribution of rainfall and the elevation variations have divided this province into two distinct climatic regions: temperate and warm. The warm region, situated in the south and west of the province and adjacent to Khuzestan, has a warm and semi-arid climate. Rainfall in this region is relatively low, and cold weather and frost are rare. This part of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province is covered with wild pistachio trees or, as the locals call them, "Baneh."

The temperate region lies in the north and east of the province, bordering Fars, Isfahan, and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Provinces. This part of the province, located in the southernmost moist section of the Zagros, is covered with vast and beautiful oak and mountain pistachio forests and is the source of large and abundant rivers such as the Karun and Marun. The frost season in this area begins in some places from Shahrivar (August–September) and continues until the end of Esfand (February–March). Despite its not-so-wide expanse, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province exhibits considerable climatic diversity; while the temperate region is snowy in the cold winter season, various summer fruits and vegetables are cultivated in the warm regions.

Cities of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province

Until 1375 SH (1996), this province consisted of three counties named Boyer-Ahmad, Kohgiluyeh, and Gachsaran. However, in the recent national divisions, this province has been divided into seven counties and sixteen districts, which include sixteen cities and more than 1,700 villages.
