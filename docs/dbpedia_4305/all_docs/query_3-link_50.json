        "text": "What is a Gram stain?\n\nA Gram stain is a laboratory test that checks for bacteria at the site of a suspected infection or in certain bodily fluids. A medical laboratory scientist processes the Gram stain, which gives relatively quick results, so healthcare providers can know if bacteria are present, and, if so, the general type(s). This can help guide further identification tests and treatment options.\n\nBacteria are a large group of one-celled organisms. They can live in different places in your body and on your skin. While some types of bacteria are harmless or even beneficial, others can cause infections and disease. A Gram stain helps diagnose harmful bacteria.\n\nUnder a Gram stain, different kinds of bacteria change one of two sets of colors (pink to red or purple to blue) under a special series of stains and are categorized as “gram-negative” or “gram-positive,” accordingly. Gram staining works by differentiating bacteria by the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls.\n\nHowever, not all forms of bacteria can be tested using the Gram stain method, and Gram stains don’t usually provide a diagnosis alone. Instead, they help to broadly determine the type of bacteria.\n\nGram staining is an essential staining technique in microbiology that scientists have used for hundreds of years. It’s named after Danish bacteriologist Hans Christian Gram, who first introduced it in 1882, mainly to identify organisms causing pneumonia.\n\nWhat are gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria?\n\nIf bacteria are present on a Gram stain slide, a medical laboratory scientist classifies them as gram-negative or gram-positive based on which color they turn under a series of stains. There are also gram-variable bacteria, which means they stain irregularly, and there’s a mix of pink- and purple-colored bacteria.\n\nIt’s important to note that gram-negative doesn’t mean there are no bacteria, and “positive” and “negative” don’t mean “good” and “bad” in this case.\n\nGram-positive organisms\n\nGram-positive bacteria have cell walls that contain thick layers of peptidoglycan, a substance that forms the cell walls of many bacteria. The peptidoglycan forms about 90% of the cell wall in gram-positive bacteria. This causes them to appear blue to purple under a Gram stain.\n\nGram-positive organisms include:\n\nStaphylococcus species.\n\nStreptococcus species.\n\nCorynebacterium species.\n\nClostridium species.\n\nListeria species.\n\nGram-negative organisms\n\nGram-negative bacteria have cell walls with thin layers of peptidoglycan (10% of the cell wall) and high lipid (fatty acid) content. This causes them to appear red to pink under a Gram stain.\n\nGram-negative organisms include:\n\nNeisseria gonorrheae and Neisseria meningitides.\n\nMoraxella species.\n\nEscherichia coli (E. coli).\n\nPseudomonas species.\n\nProteus species.\n\nKlebsiella species.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a Gram stain and a bacteria culture?\n\nHealthcare providers use both Gram stains and bacteria cultures if they suspect you have a bacterial infection. However, these tests provide different information.\n\nProviders usually request bacteria culture tests alongside Gram stain tests. In a bacteria culture test, a medical laboratory scientist takes cells from the sample that’s also for the Gram stain and puts it in a special environment to encourage cell growth. Results are often available within a few days, but some types of bacteria grow slowly, which may take several days or longer. Once the cells have multiplied and grown enough, a medical laboratory scientist examines the cultured bacteria to determine their exact identity.\n\nA Gram stain involves applying a stain to a sample in glass microscope slides and looking at it under a microscope to determine if bacteria are present at all. If bacteria are present, the medical laboratory scientists can see if they’re gram-negative or gram-positive based on if the bacteria appear pink to red or purple to blue under the stain. Different types of bacteria are either gram-negative or gram-positive.\n\nWhile Gram stains provide quicker results than bacteria cultures, in most cases, a Gram stain can’t diagnose the type of bacterium, unlike a bacteria culture. However, Gram stains can help point healthcare providers in the right direction for prescribing treatment.\n\nWhat conditions do Gram stains help diagnose?\n\nHealthcare providers order Gram stains to help diagnose and treat certain bacterial infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bacterial pneumonia. Providers may not always request a Gram stain to help diagnose conditions caused by bacteria. For example, they usually don’t Gram stain for food poisoning, but it’s possible to do so through a stool (poop) sample.\n\nCommon gram-negative bacteria and their associated conditions\n\nExamples of gram-negative bacteria (in italics) and the conditions they can cause include:\n\nEscherichia coli: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and food poisoning.\n\nLegionella pneumoniae: Legionnaires’ disease.\n\nSalmonella: Food poisoning and Typhoid fever.\n\nKlebsiella: Pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections and bacterial meningitis.\n\nNeisseria gonorrheae: Gonorrhea.\n\nProteus: UTIs.\n\nMorganella morganii: UTIs, sepsis, pneumonia, wound infections, musculoskeletal infections, central nervous system infections and pericarditis.\n\nAeromonas: Eye infections, osteomyelitis, bacterial meningitis, respiratory infections following \"near drowning\" and joint infections.\n\nCommon gram-positive bacteria and their associated conditions\n\nExamples of gram-positive bacteria (in italics) and the conditions they can cause include:\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae: Bacterial pneumonia.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus: Bacterial pneumonia, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and toxic shock syndrome.\n\nGroup A Streptococcus species: Strep throat infections.\n\nListeria: Food poisoning.\n\nClostridium: Food poisoning\n\nClostridium botulinum and clostridium butyricum: Botulism.\n\nWhen is a Gram test performed?\n\nHealthcare providers typically request a Gram stain along with a bacteria culture when they suspect you have a bacterial, or sometimes fungal, infection. It’s one of the most common ways to quickly diagnose bacterial infection in your body.\n\nWho performs a Gram stain test?\n\nDepending on what kind of infection you may have, many types of healthcare providers could collect a sample for a Gram stain test. For example, a gynecologist may collect a swab for a gonorrhea Gram stain test and a pulmonologist may collect a sample of your spit or mucus from your cough to use for a bacterial pneumonia Gram stain test.\n\nYour provider then puts the sample in a sterile container and sends it to a laboratory for testing. A medical laboratory scientist applies the sample to microscope slides, applies a series of stains and looks at the sample under a microscope. They put together a report and share it with your healthcare provider."
