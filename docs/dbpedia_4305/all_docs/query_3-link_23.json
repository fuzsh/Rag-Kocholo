        "text": "What's new\n\nITIN holders can access their online account\n\nTaxpayers with an ITIN can complete the registration process to access their IRS online account, which provides balance due, payment history, payment plans, tax records, and more.\n\nITIN holders must verify their identity through the video chat process and will need a valid email address, proof of ITIN, one primary document and one secondary document. One of the documents must provide proof of address.\n\nThis identity verification process applies to IRS services including Online Account, Get Transcript Online, Online Payment Agreement, Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN), Tax Pro Account, e-Services, and Submit Forms 2848 and 8821 Online.\n\nTax return requirement\n\nAll Form W-7 applications, including renewals, must include a U.S. federal tax return unless you meet an exception to the filing requirement.\n\nExpanded discussion of allowable tax benefit\n\nThe discussion of allowable tax benefits has been expanded. For more information see Allowable Tax Benefits in the Instructions for Form W-7 PDF.\n\nChild and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC)\n\nAn ITIN may be assigned to an alien dependent from Canada or Mexico if that dependent qualifies a taxpayer for a child or dependent care credit (claimed on Form 2441). The Form 2441 must be attached to Form W-7 along with the U.S. federal tax return. See Publication 503 PDF for more information.\n\nImportant reminders\n\nExpired ITINs: If your ITIN wasn't included on a U.S. federal tax return at least once for tax years 2020, 2021, and 2022, your ITIN will expire on December 31, 2023. ITINs with middle digits (the fourth and fifth positions) \"70,\" \"71,\" \"72,\" \"73,\" \"74,\" \"75,\" \"76,\" \"77,\" \"78,\" \"79,\" \"80,\" \"81,\" \"82,\" \"83,\" \"84,\" \"85,\" \"86,\" \"87,\" or \"88\" have expired. In addition, ITINs with middle digits \"90,\" \"91,\" \"92,\" \"94,\" \"95,\" \"96,\" \"97,\" \"98,\" or \"99,\" IF assigned before 2013, have expired.\n\nNote: If you previously submitted a renewal application and it was approved, you do not need to renew again. Otherwise, you should submit a completed Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, US federal tax return, and all required identification documents to the IRS.\n\nInformation returns: If your ITIN is only being used on information returns for reporting purposes, you don't need to renew your ITIN at this time. However, in the future, if you need to use the ITIN to file a U.S. federal tax return, you will need to renew the ITIN at that time.\n\nChange of address: It's important that the IRS is aware of your current mailing address. This address is used to mail notices about your Form W-7, including notification of your assigned ITIN, and return your original supporting documentation. If you move before you receive your ITIN, notify us of your current mailing address immediately, so we may update our records.\n\nWhat is an ITIN?\n\nAn Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a tax processing number issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS issues ITINs to individuals who are required to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number but who do not have, and are not eligible to obtain, a Social Security number (SSN) from the Social Security Administration (SSA).\n\nWhat is an ITIN used for?\n\nIRS issues ITINs to help individuals comply with the U.S. tax laws, and to provide a means to efficiently process and account for tax returns and payments for those not eligible for Social Security numbers. They are issued regardless of immigration status, because both resident and nonresident aliens may have a U.S. filing or reporting requirement under the Internal Revenue Code. ITINs do not serve any purpose other than federal tax reporting.\n\nAn ITIN does not:\n\nAuthorize work in the U.S.\n\nProvide eligibility for Social Security benefits\n\nQualify a dependent for Earned Income Tax Credit Purposes\n\nDo I need an ITIN?\n\nDoes the following apply to you?\n\nYou do not have an SSN and are not eligible to obtain one, and\n\nYou have a requirement to furnish a federal tax identification number or file a federal tax return, and\n\nYou are in one of the following categories:\n\nNonresident alien who is required to file a U.S. tax return\n\nU.S. resident alien who is (based on days present in the United States) filing a U.S. tax return\n\nDependent or spouse of a U.S. citizen/resident alien\n\nDependent or spouse of a nonresident alien visa holder\n\nNonresident alien claiming a tax treaty benefit\n\nNonresident alien student, professor or researcher filing a U.S. tax return or claiming an exception\n\nIf so, then you must apply for an ITIN.\n\nWhat do I do if my name has changed since I received my ITIN?\n\nIf the change affects your legal name, you will need to request a name change by sending a letter directly to the address listed under \"Where do I file my Form W-7/W-7(SP)?\", later. Include an explanation of the circumstances leading to the change (marriage, divorce, etc.) and submit documentation to support your request. Examples include:"
