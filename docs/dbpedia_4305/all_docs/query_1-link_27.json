        "text": "Since the invention of photography, a variety of approaches have made noninvasive imaging for cultural heritage applications possible. Multi‚Äê and hyperspectral imaging (together denoted spectral imaging) are two techniques that evolved from conventional color photography, having overcome its spectral limitations. Instead of imaging in three broad spectral bands, multispectral imaging acquires data in up to ten more or less equally wide and nonoverlapping spectral bands. Hyperspectral imaging goes beyond the multispectral approach by generating images in tens to hundreds of narrow, contiguous (i.e., adjacent but not overlapping) spectral bands. Most spectral imaging techniques are limited to the optical electromagnetic spectrum and acquire the reflected portion of the radiation that is used to illuminate the scene. However, imaging the emitted thermal radiation or active techniques based on laser scanners do exist as well. In cultural heritage, all these techniques are used to gain a better, noninvasive insight into the chemical and physical properties of the object(s) under investigation.\n\nHyperspectral imaging is a non-destructive optical analysis technique that can for instance be used to obtain information from cultura l heritage objects unavailable with conventional colour or multi-spectral photography. This technique can be used to distinguish and recognize materials, to enhance the visibility of faint or obscured features, to detect signs of degradation and study the effect of enviro nmental conditions on the object. We describe the basic concept, working principles, con struction and performance of a laboratory instrument specifically developed for the analysis of historical documents. The instrument measures calibrated spectral reflectance images at 70 wavelengths ranging from 365 to 1100 nm (near-ultraviolet, visible and near-infrare d). By using a wavelength tunable narrow- bandwidth light-source, the light energy used to il luminate the measured object is minimal, so that any light-induced degradation can be exclud ed. Basic analysis of the hyperspectral da...\n\nIn the present work, a hyperspectral imaging system (imaging spectrometer) using a commercial webcam has been designed and developed. This system was able to capture two-dimensional spectra (in emission, transmission and reflection modes) directly from the scene in the desired wavelengths. Imaging of the object is done directly by linear sweep (pushbroom method). To do so, the spectrometer is equipped with a suitable collecting lens and a linear travel stage. A 1920 x 1080 pixel CMOS webcam was used as a detector. The spectrometer has been calibrated by the reference spectral lines of standard lamps. The spectral resolution of this system was about 2nm and its spatial resolution was about 1 mm for a 10 cm long object. The hardware solution is based on data acquisition working on the USB platform and controlled by a LabVIEW program. In this system, the initial output was a three-dimensional matrix in which two dimensions of the matrix were related to the spatial information of the object and the third dimension was the spectrum of any point of the object. Finally, the images in different wavelengths were created by reforming the data of the matrix. The free spectral range (FSR) of the system was 400 to 1100 nm. The system was successfully tested for some applications, such as plasma diagnosis as well as applications in food and agriculture sciences."
