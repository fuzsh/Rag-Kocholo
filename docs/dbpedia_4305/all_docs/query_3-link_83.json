        "text": "Voter Registration\n\nVoting\n\nPrimary Election\n\nPropositions\n\nRunning for Office\n\nVoter Registration\n\nWho can register to vote?\n\nTo register to vote in California, you must be:\n\nA United States citizen and a resident of California,\n\n18 years old or older on Election Day,\n\nNot currently serving a state or federal prison term for the conviction of a felony (for more information, please see Voting Rights Restored: Persons with a Prior Felony Conviction), and\n\nNot currently found mentally incompetent to vote by a court (for more information, please see Voting Rights: Persons Subject to Conservatorship).\n\nWho can pre-register to vote?\n\nTo pre-register to vote in California, you must:\n\nBe 16 or 17 years old, and\n\nMeet all of the other requirements to vote.\n\nYou will automatically be registered to vote on your 18th birthday.\n\nHow do I register to vote?\n\nTo register to vote you must complete a voter registration application on paper or online at RegisterToVote.ca.gov. When you register online, the system will search the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database for your California driver license or identification card number, date of birth, and last four digits of your social security number. If your information is found and you authorize elections officials' use of your DMV signature, an electronic image of your DMV signature will be added to your voter registration application after you click \"submit\" at the end of the online application. If there is no signature on file with DMV, all of your information will be transmitted to your county elections office; you will just need to click \"print,\" sign the paper application, and mail it. Your county elections official will contact you when your voter registration application is approved or if more information is needed to confirm your eligibility.\n\nWhere can I register to vote?\n\nYou may submit your voter registration application online at RegisterToVote.ca.gov. You can also pick up a paper application at your county elections office, any Department of Motor Vehicles field office, and many post offices, public libraries, and government offices. To have an application mailed to you, call your county elections office or the Secretary of State's toll-free Voter Hotline at (800) 345-VOTE (8683).\n\nWhat is conditional voter registration?\n\nIf you did not register to vote by the 15-day voter registration deadline, in most elections, you may conditionally register to vote and cast a provisional ballot by visiting your county elections office, a vote center, or a designated satellite location during the period of 14 days prior to, and including, Election Day.\n\nOnce your county elections official processes your affidavit of registration, determines your eligibility to register, and validates your information, your registration becomes permanent and your provisional ballot will be counted. For more information, please refer to Same Day Voter Registration.\n\nHow do I change my political party?\n\nIn order to change your political party preference, you must re-register to vote. You can re-register to vote by completing a voter registration application online atRegisterToVote.ca.gov. When you register online, the system will search the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database for your California driver license or identification card number, date of birth, and last four digits of your social security number. If your information is found and you authorize elections officials' use of your DMV signature, an electronic image of your DMV signature will be added to your voter registration application after you click \"submit\" at the end of the online application. If there is no signature on file with DMV, all of your information will be transmitted to your county elections office; you will just need to click \"print,\" sign the paper application, and mail it. Your county elections official will contact you when your voter registration application is approved or if more information is needed to confirm your eligibility.\n\nYou can also pick up a paper application at your county elections office, any Department of Motor Vehicles field office, and many post offices, public libraries, and government offices. To have an application mailed to you, call your county elections office or the Secretary of State’s toll-free Voter Hotline at (800) 345-VOTE (8683).\n\nDo I need a California driver license or California identification card to apply online? What happens if the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have my signature on file when I try to submit an application online?\n\nAll Californians who are eligible to vote may fill out an online voter registration application at RegisterToVote.ca.gov. California military and overseas voters may also use RegisterToVote.ca.gov to fill out an application and request a special absentee ballot. If you do not have a California driver license or identification card number, but you enter your other information, the website will create a pre-filled voter registration application for you to print, sign, and mail. All of your information will be sent directly to your county elections office so that when your signed application arrives in the mail, the county elections staff will simply add your signature to your voter registration record.\n\nI am eligible to register, but I am in the military, living abroad, or temporarily living outside of California. Can I register to vote online?\n\nYes. California military and overseas voters may also use RegisterToVote.ca.gov to fill out a voter registration application and request a special absentee ballot. When filling out an application to register as a special absentee voter, you can choose to have your ballot mailed, faxed, or emailed to you.\n\nAm I automatically registered to vote when I submit the online application?\n\nNo. The onlinevoter registration application is an easy avenue for submitting your information, but the information you provide in your online application still must be verified by your county elections official. If you have a California driver license or identification card and submit an online voter registration application, the Department of Motor Vehicles is simply sharing a copy of your signature on file so that it can be transferred to your voter registration record. No matter how you turn in your registration application – online or paper – when it comes to determining a person's eligibility to vote, preventing duplicate registrations, and adding a person to California's official voter rolls, all the same safeguards are in place. Your county elections official will contact you when your voter registration application is approved or if more information is needed to confirm your eligibility.\n\nAre voter registration applications available in languages other than English?\n\nYes. The California Secretary of State'sonline application is available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. Paper applications are also available in those same languages. To have an application mailed to you, call your county elections office or the Secretary of State's toll-free Voter Hotline at (800) 345-VOTE (8683).\n\nCan I vote online?\n\nNo. For security reasons, California law prohibits casting a ballot over the Internet. This also means that county elections officials cannot accept marked ballots sent via email. If you are a military and overseas voter, as defined by the federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, you may return your voted ballot to your county elections office only by mail or fax (in certain limited circumstances).\n\nAm I already registered to vote?\n\nTo find out if you are currently registered to vote, please refer to My Voter Status.\n\nI did not vote in the last election. Do I need to re-register to vote?\n\nIn general, you do not need to re-register because you are registered to vote for as long as you remain at the same address. However, there are cases in which voter registration can be cancelled if a voter has not voted in several consecutive general elections.\n\nWhat should I do if I have just moved within California?\n\nYour voter registration record should always reflect your current residence. If your move is permanent, you can update your California residence address by re-registering online or by submitting a paper voter registration application.\n\nYou can also send a signed letter to your current county elections official, informing them of your move and providing them with your date of birth and current address, even if it is in a different county. However, if you have already updated your residence address at the Department of Motor Vehicles or the U.S. Postal Service, your registration will be automatically updated with your new address.\n\nIf your move is temporary, you can continue to use your prior permanent residence where you were registered to vote as your address for the purpose of voting.\n\nWhat should I do if I changed my name?\n\nIf you have legally changed your name, you mustre-register to vote so that your voter record reflects your current name. The Secretary of State recommends that before you update your voter record with your current name, you first update your California driver license or identification card with DMV.\n\nIf you are re-registering online and you have not updated your DMV record with your new name, select \"decline\" on the application when asked to use your DMV signature to register to vote. If you do not decline use of your DMV signature, your application will be rejected by your county elections official because your DMV signature for your prior name will not match your voter signature with your new name. After you decline to use your DMV signature, continue filling in your information. Print, sign, and mail the paper application to your county elections office.\n\nWhat is the deadline to register to vote?\n\nThe deadline to register to vote is 15 days prior to Election Day, often called E-15. You must submit the voter registration application by midnight on the registration deadline day. A timestamp will be attached to your online voter registration application. If you register to vote using a paper application, it must be postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office by E-15. After the registration deadline, in most elections any individual may conditionally register to vote and cast a provisional ballot by visiting their county elections official. For more information, please refer to Same Day Voter Registration.\n\nIf I started to fill out the online voter registration application before midnight on E-15 but didn't finish until after midnight, am I too late?\n\nYes, you must submit the voter registration application online by midnight on the registration deadline day. However, in most elections you may go in person to your county elections office during the 14 days immediately following the registration deadline to conditionally register to vote and vote a provisional ballot. For more information please go to Same Day Voter Registration (Conditional Voter Registration). If you do not conditionally register to vote, your voter registration application will still be processed and, if it is approved, you will be able to vote in future elections.\n\nI missed the deadline to register to vote. Is there any way I can still vote in this election?\n\nIn most elections, during the period of 14 days prior to Election Day and including Election Day, an individual can go to the office of their county elections official to conditionally register to vote and vote a provisional ballot. For more information, please refer to Same Day Voter Registration.\n\nI registered to vote a while ago but I never got a postcard confirmation from my county elections official. Am I registered?\n\nYou may check the status of your voter registration by visiting My Voter Status or by contacting your county elections official.\n\nI submitted a voter registration application through another agency, but my county elections office says I'm not registered. What can I do?\n\nGive yourcounty elections official any documentation you have to help establish when and where you submitted your voter registration application, such as a receipt with a tracking number or timestamp, or whether you were previously registered to vote elsewhere.\n\nHow can I cancel my California voter registration?\n\nIf you are currently registered to vote in California and would like to cancel your voter registration, you can complete the California Voter Registration Cancellation Request Form (PDF) and submit it to your county elections office. If you have any questions, you can contact your county elections office or the Secretary of State's Voter Hotline at (800) 345-VOTE (8683).\n\nCalifornia Voter Registration Cancellation Request Form (PDF)\n\nSpanish (PDF)\n\nChinese (PDF)\n\nHindi (PDF)\n\nJapanese (PDF)\n\nKhmer (PDF)\n\nKorean (PDF)\n\nTagalog (PDF)\n\nThai (PDF)\n\nVietnamese (PDF)\n\nIf I have problems registering to vote or have additional questions who should I contact?\n\nCall the Secretary of State's toll-free Voter Hotline at (800) 345-VOTE (8683) or contact your county elections office, which is where your voter registration record is maintained. For assistance in other languages, please refer to Contact Information.\n\nI want to start a voter registration drive. What do I need to do?\n\nRead the rules for conducting voter registration drives in California. You may also want to contact the county elections office in the county where you plan to conduct the voter registration drive.\n\nHow many paper voter registration applications can I get if I want to distribute them in my community?\n\nThere is no limit to the number of paper voter registration applications a person may obtain. However, depending on the volume of requests and the number of applications in stock, the Secretary of State or county elections officials may ask requestors to take fewer applications and return later if they need more. The Secretary of State requires the requestor to complete a Statement of Distribution form and a county elections official may require something similar.\n\nCan an iPad, tablet, or smartphone be used to fill out California's online voter registration application?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat voter registration applications are approved for use in California?\n\nThere are two acceptable voter registration applications that can be accessed online: the California Secretary of State's RegisterToVote.ca.gov and the National Mail Voter Registration Application. Some organizations host websites that encourage voter registration. Some of these websites collect data from people before redirecting them to RegisterToVote.ca.gov or the National Mail Voter Registration Application (this cannot be submitted online; you must print, sign, and mail it to your county elections office).\n\nYou can also pick up a paper application at your county elections office, any Department of Motor Vehicles field office, and many post offices, public libraries, and government offices. To have an application mailed to you, call your county elections office or the Secretary of State’s toll-free Voter Hotline at (800) 345-VOTE (8683).\n\nIs voter registration information confidential?\n\nThe voter registration rolls are not available to the general public. However, California law allows certain voter information to be released to a member of the California Legislature or U.S. Congress, to any candidate, to any committee for or against a proposed ballot measure, and to any person for election, scholarly, journalistic, or political purpose, or for governmental purposes. Even in these cases, a few items remain confidential and are never provided to any requestor: your social security number, your driver license number, and your signature.\n\nWhere can I find voter registration statistics?\n\nThe California Secretary of State publishes voter registration statistics during every election cycle. Reports of Registration contain registration information going back to 1910.\n\nCan the Secretary of State provide race, age and gender statistics for the voting population?\n\nNo. The Secretary of State compiles voter statistics by political party and jurisdictions. The state government does not collect voter race, voter age or voter gender data. You may wish to contact the Public Policy Institute of California or the United States Census Bureau for voter demographics.\n\n(return to top)\n\nVoting\n\nHow do I find out what my legislative and congressional districts are?\n\nYou may contact your county elections official or refer to \"Who Are My Representatives?\".\n\nHow can I vote a vote-by-mail ballot?\n\nCounty elections officials mail vote-by-mail ballots to all active registered voters.\n\nApply for a second ballot\n\nIf you failed to receive your vote-by-mail ballot or you have lost or destroyed your original ballot, contact your county elections official in order to be sent a second vote-by-mail ballot.\n\nCalifornia Replacement Ballot Application\n\nIf you did not receive your vote-by-mail ballot, or you lost or destroyed your original ballot, you may apply for a replacement ballot. Only the registered voter themself may request a replacement ballot. This application will need to be returned to your local county elections office. You may also request a replacement ballot from your county elections office by phone, email, fax, or other electronic means. Only the registered voter themself may request a replacement ballot. A request for a replacement ballot that is made by any person other than the registered voter is a criminal offense. (Elec. Code, § 3014(a).)\n\nCalifornia Replacement Ballot Application (PDF)\n\nSpanish (PDF)\n\nChinese (PDF)\n\nHindi (PDF)\n\nJapanese (PDF)\n\nKhmer (PDF)\n\nKorean (PDF)\n\nTagalog (PDF)\n\nThai (PDF)\n\nVietnamese (PDF)\n\nWhen is the last day to return my voted vote-by-mail ballot?\n\nVote-by-mail ballots that are personally delivered must be delivered no later than the close of polls at 8:00 p.m. on Election Day. Vote-by-mail ballots that are mailed must be postmarked on or before Election Day and received by your county elections office no later than 7 days after Election Day. If you are not sure your vote-by-mail ballot will arrive in time if mailed, take it to your county elections office on or before Election Day or to any polling place in your county between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nHow do I turn in my vote-by-mail ballot on Election Day?\n\nYou may return it in person to any polling place in your county or to your county elections office on Election Day. If you are unable to return the ballot yourself, you may designate any person to return the ballot to the elections official or the precinct board at any polling place within the jurisdiction. The ballot must be received by the elections official or the precinct board before the close of the polls at 8:00 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted.\n\nWhat is the Voter's Choice Act?\n\nThe California Voter’s Choice Act is a new law (PDF) passed in 2016 that modernizes elections in California by allowing counties to conduct elections under a new model which provides greater flexibility and convenience for voters.\n\nThis election model allows voters to choose how, when, and where to cast their ballot by:\n\nMailing every voter a ballot\n\nExpanding in-person early voting\n\nAllowing voters to cast a ballot at any vote center within their county\n\nWhere is my polling place?\n\nYour polling place will be printed on the county voter information guide you receive from yourcounty elections official prior to an election. You may also contact your local county elections office for polling place information. If you live in a county that is conducting elections under the California Voter's Choice Act, please visit that web page for more information.\n\nWhat hours are polling place locations open?\n\nAll polling place locations are open on Election Day from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. If you live in a county that is conducting elections under the California Voter's Choice Act, please visit that web page for more information.\n\nWhy was my precinct/polling place changed?\n\nCounties try to use the same polling place for each election, so your polling place normally does not change between the primary and the general elections. If the county is conducting smaller local elections where the turnout is likely to be lower, the county may consolidate precincts into fewer polling places.\n\nYou can always determine where your polling place is by looking at the back of your county voter information guide, which you will receive from your county elections official. The back cover contains the name and address of your polling place. You can also call your county elections official to find out where your polling place is located.\n\nIf you live in a county that is conducting elections under the California Voter's Choice Act, please visit that web page for more information.\n\nIs there a toll-free telephone number I can call regarding voter information?\n\nYes. The Secretary of State has established a toll-free Voter Hotline for requests for voter registration forms and other election materials and to report suspicions of voting or registration irregularities. The number is (800) 345-VOTE (8683). For assistance in other languages, please refer to Contact Information.\n\nAre election returns for state offices on your website?\n\nThe election results from past statewide elections can be found at Election Results.\n\nWhat can be done to increase voter participation?\n\nThe Secretary of State's office has been working with a wide range of groups throughout the state to increase voter participation. We are always looking for better ways to reach out and engage citizens in the voting process. OurVoter Education and Outreach webpage will provide you with information on some of the programs and events we are currently working on.\n\n(return to top)\n\nPrimary Election\n\nWhat is a voter-nominated office?\n\nThe Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act, which took effect January 1, 2011, created \"voter-nominated\" offices. The Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act does not apply to candidates running for U.S. President, county central committees, or local offices.\n\nMost of the offices that were previously known as \"partisan\" are now known as \"voter-nominated\" offices. Voter-nominated offices are state constitutional offices, state legislative offices, U.S. senate, and U.S. congressional offices. The only \"partisan offices\" now are the offices of U.S. President and county central committee.\n\nHow are primary elections conducted in California?\n\nAll candidates for voter-nominated offices are listed on one ballot and only the top two vote-getters in the primary election – regardless of party preference - move on to the general election. A write-in candidate will only move on to the general election if the candidate is one of the top two vote-getters in the primary election.\n\nPrior to the Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act, the top vote-getter from each qualified political party, as well as any write-in candidate who received a certain percentage of votes, moved on to the general election.\n\nThe Top Two Candidates Open Primary Act does not apply to candidates running for U.S. President, county central committee, or local office.\n\nHow are presidential primary elections conducted in California?\n\nQualified political parties in California may hold presidential primaries in one of two ways:\n\nClosed presidential primary - the party only allows voters indicating a preference for that party to vote for its presidential nominee.\n\nModified-closed presidential primary - in addition to allowing voters indicating a preference for that party to vote for its presidential nominee, the party also allows voters who did not indicate a party preference to vote for its presidential nominee.\n\nIf a qualified political party chooses to hold a modified-closed presidential primary, the party must notify the California Secretary of State no later than the 135th day before Election Day.\n\nWhat do party preferences mean when listed with candidates' names on the ballot? What are the qualified political parties and abbreviations of those party names?\n\nThe term \"party preference\" is now used in place of the term \"party affiliation.\" A candidate must indicate his or her preference or lack of preference for a qualified political party. If the candidate has a qualified political party preference, that qualified political party will be indicated by the candidate's name on the ballot. If a candidate does not have a party preference, \"Party Preference: None\" will be indicated by the candidate's name on the ballot.\n\nSimilarly, voters who were previously known as \"decline-to-state\" voters (because they did not have a party affiliation) are now known as having \"no party preference\" or known as \"NPP\" voters.\n\nAbbreviations for the qualified political parties are:\n\nDEM = Democratic Party\n\nREP = Republican Party\n\nAI = American Independent Party\n\nGRN = Green Party\n\nLIB = Libertarian Party\n\nPF = Peace & Freedom Party\n\nIf a candidate receives a majority of the vote (over 50 percent) in the primary election, will there still be a general election?\n\nYes. The top two vote-getters move on to the general election regardless of party preference or whether one candidate receives a majority of all votes cast in the primary election. Only candidates running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction or candidates for voter-nominated offices in special elections can win outright by getting a majority of the vote (over 50 percent) in the primary election.\n\nIf there are only two candidates in the primary election, is a general election required?\n\nYes. The top two vote-getters move on to the general election regardless of candidate pool size, party preference, or whether one candidate receives the majority of all votes cast in the primary election. Only candidates running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction or candidates for voter-nominated offices in special elections can win outright by getting a majority of the vote (over 50 percent) in the primary election.\n\nWhich candidates can run in the general election?\n\nCandidates running for a voter-nominated office cannot run in the general election without having been one of the top two vote-getters in the primary election (refer to \"What is a voter-nominated office?\" above).\n\nAn exception is made if no candidate has been nominated at the primary election for a voter-nominated office. If this occurs, a candidate can use the independent nomination process to run in the general election.\n\nAdditionally, candidates running for the office of U.S. President can run in the general election as either a Presidential Elector using the independent nomination process or a Presidential Elector write-in candidate.\n\nFor more information about running for office, please refer to Candidate Resources.\n\nCan independent or write-in candidates for voter-nominated offices run in the general election?\n\nAll candidates, including candidates who would have used the former independent nomination process, are allowed to run for a voter-nominated office in a primary election. All primary candidates for a voter-nominated office are listed on a single ballot, and only the two candidates who get the most votes in the primary election will move on to the general election.\n\nHowever, if no candidate has been nominated at the primary election for a voter-nominated office, a candidate can use the independent nomination process to run in the general election.\n\nWrite-in candidates for voter-nominated offices cannot run in the general election, however, they can still run in the primary election. If a write-in candidate is one of the top two vote-getters in the primary election, the candidate can move on to the general election.\n\nCandidates running for the office of U.S. President can run in the general election as either a Presidential Elector using the independent nomination process or a Presidential Elector write-in candidate.\n\n(return to top)\n\nPropositions\n\nWhen is the deadline for initiatives, referenda, and legislative measures to qualify for the ballot and which election ballot will they appear on?\n\nAs a result of Senate Bill 202 (Chapter 558, Statutes of 2011), from July 2011 forward, initiative and referendum measures will only appear on general election ballots.\n\nInitiatives have to qualify 131 days before a general election. Referenda can qualify for the ballot up to 31 days before a general election.\n\nSenate Bill 202 does not affect the placement of legislative measures on the ballot. Legislative measures can still appear on the ballot during any statewide election. Legislative measures must also be placed on the ballot 131 days before an election, unless the legislature passes legislation allowing a specific bill to be placed on the ballot after the 131 day deadline.\n\nHow and when are numbers assigned to state propositions?\n\nState propositions are generally numbered between 131 and 105 days before an election and are numbered in 10-year cycles starting with the number \"1,\" according to Elections Code section 13117. The current numbering cycle starts with the November 4, 2008, General Election.\n\nHow can I learn more about California's statewide initiative process?\n\nThe Secretary of State's Statewide Ballot Initiative Handbook contains some very useful information on this topic.\n\nHow many signatures does it take to qualify a statewide initiative?\n\nThe number of signatures required for initiative statutes must be equal to at least 5% of the total votes cast for Governor at the last gubernatorial election. The number of signatures required for initiative constitutional amendments must be equal to at least 8% of the total votes cast for Governor at the last gubernatorial election.\n\nHow many signatures does it take to qualify a statewide referendum?\n\nThe number of signatures required for referenda must be equal to at least 5% of the total votes cast for Governor at the last gubernatorial election.\n\n(return to top)\n\nRunning for Office\n\nWhat requirements must a person meet to run for office?\n\nThese requirements are specific to the office and are posted at Candidate Information.\n\nWhen do candidates have to file their various official documents in order to become certified for the next statewide election cycle?\n\nPlease refer to Candidate Information for information on candidate filing deadlines."
