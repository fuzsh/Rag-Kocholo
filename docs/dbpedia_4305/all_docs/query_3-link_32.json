        "text": "33 U.S.C. ยง1251 et seq. (1972)\n\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. The basis of the CWA was enacted in 1948 and was called the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, but the Act was significantly reorganized and expanded in 1972. \"Clean Water Act\" became the Act's common name with amendments in 1972.\n\nUnder the CWA, EPA has implemented pollution control programs such as setting wastewater standards for industry. EPA has also developed national water quality criteria recommendations for pollutants in surface waters.\n\nThe CWA made it unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit was obtained:\n\nEPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program controls discharges.\n\nPoint sources are discrete conveyances such as pipes or man-made ditches.\n\nIndividual homes that are connected to a municipal system, use a septic system, or do not have a surface discharge do not need a NPDES permit;\n\nIndustrial, municipal, and other facilities must obtain permits if their discharges go directly to surface waters.\n\nCompliance and Enforcement\n\nClean Water Act Compliance Monitoring: investigations and inspections\n\nWater Enforcement\n\nHistory of this Act\n\nEPA History: Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972\n\nHistory of the Clean Water Act\n\nArchived EPA History: Clean Water Act\n\nMore Information\n\nThe Office of Water (OW) ensures drinking water is safe, and restores and maintains oceans, watersheds, and their aquatic ecosystems to protect human health, support economic and recreational activities, and provide healthy habitat for fish, plants, and wildlife."
