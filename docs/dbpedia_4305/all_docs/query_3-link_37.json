        "text": "What it is\n\nEbola disease is caused by a group of viruses, known as orthoebolaviruses (formally ebolavirus)1. These viruses can cause serious illness that, without treatment, can cause death. Orthoebolaviruses were discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHealthcare providers:‎\n\nReview guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers, like Ebola disease, here: Site Index | Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs) | CDC\n\nTypes\n\nThere are four orthoebolaviruses that cause illness in people:\n\nEbola virus (species orthoebolavirus zairense) causes Ebola virus disease.\n\nSudan virus (species orthoebolavirus sudanense) causes Sudan virus disease.\n\nTaï Forest virus (species orthoebolavirus taiense) causes Taï Forest virus disease.\n\nBundibugyo virus (species orthoebolavirus bundibugyoense) causes Bundibugyo virus disease.\n\nSome orthoebolaviruses do not cause illness in people. Reston virus (species Orthoebolavirus restonense) can cause illness in nonhuman primates and pigs. Bombali virus (species Orthoebolavirus bombaliense) was identified in bats, but scientists don't know if it causes illness in animals or people.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nPeople with Ebola disease may experience \"dry\" symptoms early in the course of illness. These symptoms may include fever, aches, pains, and fatigue. As the person becomes sicker, the illness typically progresses to \"wet\" symptoms and may include diarrhea, vomiting, and unexplained bleeding.\n\nHow long it takes for signs to show\n\nSomeone with Ebola disease may start getting sick 2 to 21 days after contact with an orthoebolavirus. However, on average, symptoms begin 8 to 10 days after exposure.\n\nRisk factors\n\nHealthcare providers and family members caring for someone with Ebola disease without proper infection control methods have the highest risk of infection.\n\nThe viruses that cause Ebola disease pose little risk to travelers or the general public.\n\nHow it spreads\n\nPeople can get Ebola disease through contact with the body fluids of an infected sick or dead person. Rarely, some people can get the disease from contact with an infected animal, like a bat or primate.\n\nKeep Reading: How Ebola Disease Spreads\n\nPrevention\n\nWhen living in or traveling to regions where viruses that spread Ebola disease may be present, take steps to protect yourself.\n\nAvoid contact with body fluids\n\nAvoid contact with body fluids from people and animals, including\n\nBlood and body fluids, like urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, amniotic fluid, semen, and vaginal fluid from people who are sick.\n\nSemen from someone who has recovered from Ebola disease, until testing shows that the virus is no longer in the semen.\n\nClothes, bedding, needles, medical equipment, or other items that may have touched an infected person's blood or body fluids.\n\nThe body of someone who is suspected or confirmed to have had Ebola disease (such as during a funeral or burial practices).\n\nBats, forest antelopes, primates, and blood, fluids, or raw meat from these or unknown animals.\n\nWear protective equipment\n\nWear protective equipment if you come in contact with people who are sick or have died from Ebola disease, their blood and bodily fluids, or objects covered with their blood or body fluids.\n\nMonitor your health\n\nIf you return from an area with an ongoing Ebola outbreak, monitor your health for 21 days. Seek medical care immediately if you develop symptoms of Ebola disease.\n\nEbola Vaccine‎\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ERVEBO® for the prevention of Ebola disease (species Orthoebolavirus zairense only). Vaccination is recommended for U.S. adults 18 years and older who are at potential risk of exposure to the Ebola virus. Ebola Vaccine Product Information\n\nTesting and diagnosis\n\nHealthcare providers use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to diagnose Ebola disease. They can also test for orthoebolavirus antibodies.\n\nSomeone being tested for Ebola disease should be separated from other people in a healthcare facility until results are confirmed.\n\nHealth Care Providers: Clinical Guidance for Ebola Disease"
