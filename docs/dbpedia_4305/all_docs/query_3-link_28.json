        "text": "With NASAâ€™s Artemis campaign, we are exploring the Moon for scientific discovery, technology advancement, and to learn how to live and work on another world as we prepare for human missions to Mars. We will collaborate with commercial and international partners and establish the first long-term presence on the Moon. NASA will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.\n\nIntroduce a Friend to Artemis\n\nLearn More\n\nLearn More about Artemis Missions\n\nArtemis I\n\nArtemis I was an uncrewed flight test of the Space Launch System and the Orion spacecraft around the Moon.\n\nArtemis II\n\nArtemis II will be the first crewed flight test of the Space Launch System and the Orion spacecraft around the Moon.\n\nArtemis III\n\nArtemis III will send the first humans to explore the region near the lunar South Pole.\n\nArtemis IV\n\nArtemis IV debuts humanity's first lunar space station, a larger, more powerful version of the SLS rocket, and new mobile launcher.\n\nArtemis\n\nWhy We Are Going To The Moon\n\nWeâ€™re going back to the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and inspiration for a new generation of explorers: the Artemis Generation. While maintaining American leadership in exploration, we will build a global alliance and explore deep space for the benefit of all.\n\nLearn More About the Moon about Why We Are Going To The Moon\n\nWhat more can we learn at the Moon?\n\nThe Moon is a treasure trove of science.\n\nEarthâ€™s Moon is a 4.5-billion-year-old time capsule, pristinely preserved by the cold vacuum of space. The lunar samples returned during the Apollo Program dramatically changed our view of the solar system, and scientists continue to unlock new secrets from those samples. Yet, we are just scratching the surface of knowledge about the Moon. Future samples from Artemis missions will continue to advance our knowledge of the history and formation of our solar system including Earth and the Moon.\n\nLearn More about the Moon\n\nHow much water is on the Moon, and why is that important for future exploration?\n\nWater is a critical resource for long-term exploration.\n\nPermanently shadowed regions of the Moon, including craters at the South Pole, are rich in frozen water. Finding it on the Moon, extracting it and converting it means water for drinking, oxygen for breathing, and rocket fuel to power missions farther into the solar system. Finding and using resources in space makes exploration more affordable when we do not have to send everything from Earth. This is also important to help NASA get ready for our next giant leap â€“ human exploration of Mars.\n\nNASA wants to understand how much water exists below the surface and if it can be extracted. The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) will be the worldâ€™s first lunar water-hunting rover and is planned to launch aboard a CLPS provider lander in late 2024.\n\nLearn More About VIPER\n\nHow can we grow a lunar economy?\n\nFor the Artemis missions, American innovation is leading the way, and the future at the Moon holds promise for a robust lunar marketplace.\n\nNASAâ€™s strategy stimulates the commercial space industry, which drives new ideas, brings down costs, and grows the business opportunities that can foster a lunar economy and serve other customers for the benefit of humanity.\n\nRead More\n\nHow We Explore the Moon\n\nTogether, the Orion spacecraft, SLS rocket, Gateway, human landing systems, and advanced spacesuits represent the core of NASAâ€™s infrastructure for long-term human exploration at the Moon.\n\nGetting to the Moon\n\nLearn about the systems that carry astronauts to the Moon.\n\nIn Lunar Orbit\n\nLearn about living and working aboard Gateway in lunar orbit.\n\nOn the Lunar Surface\n\nLearn about systems to live and work on the surface of the Moon.\n\nArtemis Partners\n\nLearn about the industry and academic partnerships empowering the Artemis missions.\n\nNASA Encyclopedia\n\nCommercial Lunar Payload Services\n\nNASA is supporting the creation of a lunar economy through commercial deliveries of NASA science that will help prepare for the next generation of explorers.\n\nLearn More\n\nArtemis Accords\n\nWe go together.\n\nThe Artemis Accords are grounded in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, outlining the vision and principles for a safe, transparent environment that facilitates exploration, science, and commercial activities for all of humanity to enjoy. To date, 43 countries have joined the accords and are committed to establishing a peaceful, prosperous future in space. More countries will sign the Artemis Accords in the months and years ahead to ensure the entire world can benefit from our journey of exploration and discovery.\n\nMore About The Artemis Accords about Artemis Accords\n\nAll that we build, all that we study, all that we do, prepares us to go.\n\nLearning resources\n\nJoin Artemis\n\nMake, launch, teach, compete and learn. Find your favorite way to be part of the Artemis mission.\n\nLearn More\n\nArtemis\n\n53 Images\n\nBeyond the Moon\n\nHumans to Mars\n\nLike the Moon, Mars is a rich destination for scientific discovery and a driver of technologies that will enable humans to travel and explore far from Earth.\n\nMars remains our horizon goal for human exploration because it is one of the only other places we know where life may have existed in the solar system. What we learn about the Red Planet will tell us more about our Earthâ€™s past and future, and may help answer whether life exists beyond our home planet.\n\nLearn More about Humans to Mars"
