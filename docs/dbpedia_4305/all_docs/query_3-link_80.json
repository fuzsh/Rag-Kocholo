        "text": "I donât know what else you would want from a social media app. If you want entertainment you could find it, if you want knowledge on a business or company you may want to start you could find it, if you just want to kill time you could just go on and scroll. I think itâs my favorite social media app and it is very diverse from young to old people from people with all different intrests and hobbies educating each other on cool or interesting topics also unlike other apps it is not just a brain rot for low attention spans and it does not hurt anyone who wants to go on as long as you donât look at the wrong stuff. That is also why X is great is it gives you a freedom to post whatever and look at whatever so if you donât like what you see you could only blame yourself since that is what you have been looking and the algorithm is perfect if I look at something once it gives it to me maybe once more if I look up knicks game score I will get more updates on the score to knicks games and other NBA games.\n\nTwitter has always been a great app for keeping up with sports, events, and people youâre interested in. Itâs technically still that nowadays, but the experience has worsened so much ever since Twitter became X. More specifically, ever since you could pay $8 to boost your account and take over the top spots of replies. Spam is more visible than ever because of this, ads are everywhere whether you pay for premium or not, and thereâs huge privacy concerns regarding new implementations like calls.\n\nI still use this app because I can still do what I always wanted: keep up with my interests. I can do the same on Reddit and Meta platforms in some cases, but Twitter serves a purpose in my routine of this. Itâs not a free speech platform and there is a bunch of misinformation that is spread here (but thatâs nothing new). Elon had some interesting ideas but the approach with everything has been disastrous and disappointing.\n\nI can no longer properly recommend this service to anyone. Itâs full of spam, ads, misinformation, and bots. Not to mention that if thereâs ever a case of you being harassed or if you see any other form of rule breaking, support will do nothing to assist you even if you pay for premium. That subscription isnât worth it and this platform is not worth your time.\n\nâOops something went wrong. Please try again later,â is the typical response you get when trying to resolve an issue. Twitterâs arbitrary software allows some users to abuse others with impunity, while innocuous posts or singular instances of merely âlikingâ a post may get you suspended. When you try to resolve the issue, good luck. You will rarely get a human to look at your issue, only an endless circle of useless articles and login tasks which may be impossible if you run both a business account and a private account. The âappealâ option is little more than a memory hole from which you will never get a response, or sometimes an automatically generated instant denial. Twitter does little to control spam or bots. It will disable an account but still send you email notifications linking to it, yet not permit you to login simply to unsubscribe. Deleting arbitrarily suspended accounts is nearly impossible. The user-generated content is poorly and capriciously monitored, often laden with the worst sentiments and epithets so-called humanity has to offer. If you anger someone by promoting human rights or legal reform in the wrong country, you will be locked/suspended without warning. It is a time-wasting garbage app run by those who profit from toxicity and spit on the very ârulesâ they comically established."
