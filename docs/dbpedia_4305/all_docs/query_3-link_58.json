        "text": "If you receive a letter asking for missing information or documentation to support what you claimed on your return, it doesn't mean you did anything wrong. It's just an extra step we take to ensure refunds—for the correct amounts—go out to only those who are entitled to them. Our goal is to stop questionable refunds before they go out the door, not to delay your refund.\n\nTo identify the letter you received, locate the form number in its bottom-left corner.\n\nRespond to Form DTF-948 or DTF-948-O\n\nRespond to another letter\n\nRequest for Information letter (Form DTF-948 or DTF-948-O)\n\nThe primary letter we use to request information about a return is Form DTF-948 or DTF-948-O, Request for Information (RFI). If your refund status says we sent you one of these letters, it's important you respond by the date noted on the letter so we can continue processing your return.\n\nCommon reasons we send RFI letters include:\n\nWe need to verify you reported the correct amount of wages and withholding for New York State, New York City, and Yonkers (see Checklist for acceptable proof of wages and withholding).\n\nWe need to verify you lived or worked in New York State, New York City, or Yonkers.\n\nYou claimed a credit or tax benefit, and we did not receive a copy of the form with your tax return. (We need a copy of the form to review the credit you are claiming.)\n\nWe need to verify your eligibility for the tax credits or itemized deductions you claimed.\n\nYou claimed a dependent deduction and we need to verify the dependent's Social Security number or date of birth (see Checklist for acceptable proof of a child or dependent).\n\nWe need information to verify the rental real estate income or loss you claimed.\n\nWe need to verify information about income or loss for a partnership, S corporation, or trust.\n\nWhere to view your letter online\n\nIf you received an RFI letter, you can view it in your Individual Online Services account using our Respond to Department Notice application. You do not need to request electronic communications to view this letter in the application.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWe review responses in the order we receive them. Your return may remain under review for an extended period to allow us time to review. When complete, your return will move to the processing stage and could be selected for additional review before completing processing.\n\nOnce all reviews are complete, we’ll process your return and issue a refund, a bill, or an account adjustment notice, as applicable.\n\nWe recommend you open an Individual Online Services account and request electronic communications so you can view online any communications we send.\n\nIf we approve a refund or adjusted refund, your status will update to OSC Approved.\n\nIf we issue a bill, your status will update to: Balance Due Assessed. You must follow the directions in the letter and reply completely with the information we requested. The Office of the Taxpayer Rights Advocate cannot assist you if you have not responded to our request.\n\nDemo: Respond to a Department Notice\n\nDemo: Respond to a Department Notice"
