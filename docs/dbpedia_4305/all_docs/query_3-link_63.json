        "text": "There are several different types of vaccines. Each type is designed to teach your immune system how to fight off certain kinds of germs—and the serious diseases they cause.\n\nWhen scientists create vaccines, they consider:\n\nHow your immune system responds to the germ\n\nWho needs to be vaccinated against the germ\n\nThe best technology or approach to create the vaccine\n\nBased on a number of these factors, scientists decide which type of vaccine they will make. There are several types of vaccines, including:\n\nInactivated vaccines\n\nLive-attenuated vaccines\n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines\n\nSubunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines\n\nToxoid vaccines\n\nViral vector vaccines\n\nInactivated vaccines\n\nInactivated vaccines use the killed version of the germ that causes a disease.\n\nInactivated vaccines usually don’t provide immunity (protection) that’s as strong as live vaccines. So you may need several doses over time (booster shots) in order to get ongoing immunity against diseases.\n\nInactivated vaccines are used to protect against:\n\nHepatitis A\n\nFlu (shot only)\n\nPolio (shot only)\n\nRabies\n\nLive-attenuated vaccines\n\nLive vaccines use a weakened (or attenuated) form of the germ that causes a disease.\n\nBecause these vaccines are so similar to the natural infection that they help prevent, they create a strong and long-lasting immune response. Just 1 or 2 doses of most live vaccines can give you a lifetime of protection against a germ and the disease it causes.\n\nBut live vaccines also have some limitations. For example:\n\nBecause they contain a small amount of the weakened live virus, some people should talk to their health care provider before receiving them, such as people with weakened immune systems, long-term health problems, or people who’ve had an organ transplant.\n\nThey need to be kept cool, so they don’t travel well. That means they can’t be used in countries with limited access to refrigerators.\n\nLive vaccines are used to protect against:\n\nMeasles, mumps, rubella (MMR combined vaccine)\n\nRotavirus\n\nSmallpox\n\nChickenpox\n\nYellow fever\n\nMessenger RNA vaccines—also called mRNA vaccines\n\nResearchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades and this technology was used to make some of the COVID-19 vaccines. mRNA vaccines make proteins in order to trigger an immune response. mRNA vaccines have several benefits compared to other types of vaccines, including shorter manufacturing times and, because they do not contain a live virus, no risk of causing disease in the person getting vaccinated.\n\nmRNA vaccines are used to protect against:\n\nCOVID-19\n\nSubunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines\n\nSubunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use specific pieces of the germ—like its protein, sugar, or capsid (a casing around the germ).\n\nBecause these vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, they give a very strong immune response that’s targeted to key parts of the germ. They can also be used on almost everyone who needs them, including people with weakened immune systems and long-term health problems.\n\nOne limitation of these vaccines is that you may need booster shots to get ongoing protection against diseases.\n\nThese vaccines are used to protect against:\n\nHib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) disease\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHPV (Human papillomavirus)\n\nWhooping cough (part of the DTaP combined vaccine)\n\nPneumococcal disease\n\nMeningococcal disease\n\nShingles\n\nToxoid vaccines\n\nToxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ that causes a disease. They create immunity to the parts of the germ that cause a disease instead of the germ itself. That means the immune response is targeted to the toxin instead of the whole germ.\n\nLike some other types of vaccines, you may need booster shots to get ongoing protection against diseases.\n\nToxoid vaccines are used to protect against:\n\nDiphtheria\n\nTetanus\n\nViral vector vaccines\n\nFor decades, scientists studied viral vector vaccines. Some vaccines recently used for Ebola outbreaks have used viral vector technology, and a number of studies have focused on viral vector vaccines against other infectious diseases such as Zika, flu, and HIV. Scientists used this technology to make COVID-19 vaccines as well.\n\nViral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus as a vector to deliver protection. Several different viruses have been used as vectors, including influenza, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus, and adenovirus, which causes the common cold. Adenovirus is one of the viral vectors used in some COVID-19 vaccines being studied in clinical trials. Viral vector vaccines are used to protect against:"
