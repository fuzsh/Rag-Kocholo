        "text": "Illinois State Police Sex Offender Registry\n\nIllinois Compiled Statutes (730 ILCS 152 /115 (a) and (b)) mandate that the Illinois State Police (\"ISP\") establish and maintain a statewide Sex Offender Database, accessible on the Internet, identifying persons who have been convicted of certain sex offenses and/or crimes against children and must register as a Sex Offender.\n\nPersons required to register as Sex Offenders are persons who have been charged of an offense listed in Illinois Compiled Statutes 730 ILCS 150 /2(B) and 730 ILCS 150 /2(C) when such charge results in one of the following:\n\n(a) A conviction for the commission of the offense or attempt to commit the offense,\n\n(b) A finding of not guilty by reason of insanity of committing the offense or attempting to commit the offense, or\n\n(c) A finding not resulting in an acquittal at a hearing for the alleged commission or attempted commission of the offense.\n\nThe Sex Offender Registry was created in response to the Illinois Legislature's determination to facilitate access to publicly available information about persons convicted of sex offenses. ISP has not considered or assessed the specific risk of re-offense with regard to any individual prior to his or her inclusion on this Registry and has made no determination that any individual included in the Registry is currently dangerous. Individuals included on the Registry are included solely by virtue of their conviction record and Illinois state law. The primary purpose of providing this information is to make the information easily available and accessible, not to warn about any specific individuals.\n\nAnyone who uses this information to commit a criminal act against another person is subject to criminal prosecution.\n\nISP updates this information regularly in an effort to assure that the information on the Registry is complete and accurate; however, ISP makes no representation, express or implied, that the information contained on the Registry is accurate.\n\nThe information contained on the Registry can change quickly so the current residence, status or other information regarding an offender may not be accurate. Though much of the information is of record, some information is gathered from the offenders themselves who may fail to provide any or accurate information. Additional information and verification can be obtained from the local law enforcement agency where the sex offender resides.\n\nIF YOU BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE INFORMATION FOUND IN THESE RECORDS IS INACCURATE, PLEASE CONTACT THE ILLINOIS STATE POLICE OFFENDER REGISTRATION UNIT (ORU) AT ISP.SOR.Unit@illinois.gov.\n\nIMPORTANT REMINDERS\n\nThe information on the Registry refers only to sex offenses and/or certain crimes and may not reflect the entire criminal history of a particular individual. A complete public record of Illinois criminal history can be obtained from the Illinois State Police Bureau of Identification.\n\nThe information contained on this site does not imply listed individuals will commit a specific type of crime in the future, nor does it imply that if a future crime is committed by a listed individual what the nature of that crime may be. ISP makes no representation as to any offender's likelihood of re-offending.\n\nInformation compiled on this Registry may not be used to harass or threaten sex offenders or their families. Harassment, stalking or threats may violate Illinois criminal law.\n\nYou must agree with all the conditions set forth above to enter this site.\n\nIf you agree to the conditions then click AGREE. If you choose not to agree with the conditions, click DO NOT AGREE to be redirected to the main Illinois State Police homepage."
