        "text": "For the Public\n\nThe person may present any of the following documents bearing the applicant's SSN:\n\nA W-2 form,\n\nA SSA-1099 form,\n\nA non-SSA-1099 form, or\n\nA pay stub with the applicant's name and SSN on it.\n\nState Compliance\n\nState Implementation\n\nIn addition to the plastic I-551 Permanent Resident Card, the following documents qualify as a valid, unexpired Form I-551:\n\nA foreign passport with an unexpired temporary I-551 stamp, or with a temporary I-551 printed notation on a machine-readable immigrant visa (MRIV) with a DHS admission stamp, within the stated validity period, which is normally one year from the date of the DHS stamp;\n\nA DHS Form I-94 or Form I-94A with a photograph and an unexpired temporary I-551 stamp; or\n\nA U.S. Department of State Form DS-232, Unrecognized Passport or Waiver Cases, with a temporary I-551 printed notation on a machine-readable immigrant visa (MRIV) with a DHS admission stamp and validity period, which is normally one year from the date of the DHS stamp.\n\nIn all cases, the documentation presented for proof of identity and lawful status must be verified through Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE).\n\nYes. States should accept DHS-issued EADs that have had the validity period automatically extended by DHS because they are unexpired. These include EADs that bear a “Card Expires” date that has passed, or one that has a future expiration date on its face. To determine whether an EAD validity period is extended, states should follow the scenario-based guidance below and then use SAVE to verify the extended EAD validity period.\n\nDocumentation\n\nApplicant presents an EAD and an individual notice that includes language referring to an extension of the validity period of the EAD.\n\nIf the individual notice is a Notice of Action (Form I-797 or Form I-797C) and\n\nThe EAD bears a category listed in Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension, then follow the guidance on that webpage and verify it by using SAVE.\n\nThe EAD bears a category not listed in Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension, then the EAD may still be automatically extended. As with all EAD extensions, verify it by using SAVE.\n\nApplicant presents EAD and a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) Category (A12 or C19) but no extension notice.\n\nIn this situation, visit the country-specific TPS webpage available through the applicable country link on left side of the Temporary Protected Status webpage.\n\nUse the information on the country-specific TPS webpage to determine whether there is a blanket automatic extension of expiring EADs for TPS beneficiaries of that country.\n\nSAVE Verification\n\nVerify all EAD extensions using SAVE. SAVE will generally include any status and/or EAD extension as part of its initial verification response. In situations where SAVE does not, please submit an additional verification request. If a previous SAVE case verified an applicant’s status and/or employment authorization, please submit a new verification request to determine whether there has been an extension or change.\n\nYes. States should accept DHS-issued Form I-551, Permanent Resident Cards that have had the validity period automatically extended by DHS because they are unexpired. These include a Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card (PRC, commonly known as a Green Card), bearing a “Card Expires” date that has passed, or one that has a future expiration date on its face, but is presented with a Form I-797 Notice of Action that contains language extending the validity period of the Green Card. Examples include a:\n\nReceipt notice for Form, I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (In this situation, follow the guidance on the webpage USCIS Extends Green Card Validity Extension to 24 Months for Green Card Renewals.)\n\nReceipt notice for Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence\n\nReceipt notice for Form I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status\n\nReceipt notice for Form N-400, Application for Naturalization\n\nAs with all situations where an applicant presents a Green Card, verify their Lawful Permanent Resident status by using SAVE."
