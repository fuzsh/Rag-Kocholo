        "text": "The residency and proof of identity requirements for a Nevada identification card are the same as those for a driver license. You must be a resident of Nevada. The minimum age for an ID card is 10 years.\n\nYou cannot hold both an Identification Card and a Driver License, even if they are from different states. Nevada has a seasonal resident ID for those who reside in the state only part of the year.\n\nDrivers who wish to surrender their license for an ID card must do in person at a DMV office.\n\nReview the Proof of Identity requirements to determine whether you should upgrade to a Real ID.\n\nLicense Surrender/Downgrade\n\nIf you are surrendering your Nevada driver's license for an ID card, you may do so in person at a DMV office or by mail or fax.\n\nFor mail/fax orders, complete the following forms. The address and fax number are listed on the forms.\n\nApplication for Driving Privilege or ID Card By Mail (DMV 204)\n\nVoluntary License/Identification Card Surrender (DP 5)\n\nPayment Authorization Form (ADM 205)\n\nIf you are 65 or older, the fee is $11.25. If you are under 65, the fee is $21.25.\n\nYou may pay via check or money order if using the mail.\n\nIn most cases, no further documentation is necessary. Those who presented immigration documents when first obtaining a license must present their current documents."
