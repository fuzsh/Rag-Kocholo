Additional documents may be required.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nLAWFUL STATUS\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER\n\nMISSOURI RESIDENCY\n\nThe applicant will also be required to present documents to verify the following information, if applicable:\n\nALTERNATE MAILING ADDRESS\n\nNAME CHANGE\n\nAdditional documents may be required to determine eligibility for special indicators, such as Veteran, Boater Safety, or Permanent Disability indicators, or to request a change to the gender or date of birth.\n\nIDENTITY AND LAWFUL STATUS DOCUMENTS\n\nAll documents presented must be valid and unexpired.\n\nEXCEPTION: For a non REAL ID-compliant application, an expired Missouri or out-of-state license, identification card, or instruction permit may be accepted for identity, if within six months (184 days) of expiration.\n\nA U.S. birth certificate must be an original certified document with an embossed, stamped, or raised seal issued by a vital records agency (hospital-issued birth certificates and birth registration cards or birth transcripts are not accepted). An original certified U.S. birth certificate marked as a \"delayed\" or \"amended\" filing, issued by the state vital records agency, is acceptable.\n\nEXCEPTION: For a non REAL ID-compliant application, a photocopy of a certified U.S birth certificate (issued by a vital records agency) accompanied by a U.S. Military Identification Card or U.S. Military Discharge Papers is acceptable.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (ALL Applicants)\n\nAcceptable documents must include name and Social Security number\n\nSocial Security card must be signed if the applicant is 18 years of age or older\n\nSocial Security card cannot be laminated\n\nIf a Social Security number has not been assigned, the applicant must present a letter from the Social Security Administration (SSA) regarding the status of the applicant's Social Security number.\n\nA Social Security number mayÂ be provided verbally by current Missouri license or permit holders with a previously verified Social Security number on file.\n\nMISSOURI RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS (ALL Applicants)\n\nAll applicants show residency with any recent document from the acceptable document list.\n\nAcceptable documents must include the name and address.\n\nApplicants for a non REAL ID-compliant card must submit one issued acceptable document to verify residency.\n\nApplicants for a REAL ID-compliant driver license or nondriver license must submit two acceptable documents from two different sources to verify residency.\n\nApplicants for a non REAL ID-compliant or REAL ID-compliant document requesting to use an alternate mailing address, must submit one acceptable document to verify the alternate mailing address.\n\nApplicants for a REAL ID or non REAL ID Commercial Driver License (CDL) or a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP) must submit two acceptable documents from two different sources to verify state of domicile (residency).\n\nNOTE: A Post Office Box is not acceptable as a residential address. Current addresses are important! Your license will be mailed to the address provided.\n\nResidential address is the location at which a person has been physically present and regards as home. A residential address is a person's true, fixed, principal, and permanent home, to which a person intends to return and remain, even though currently residing elsewhere.\n\nExceptions\n\nSafe at Home Address Confidentiality Program - Persons who are enrolled in the Safe at Home program may submit their program card to meet residence and mailing address verification requirements for a non REAL ID or REAL ID compliant instruction permit, driver license or nondriver identification card. For more information about the Safe at Home Program Address Confidentiality Program visit the Missouri Secretary of State website at https://www.sos.mo.gov/business/safeathome.\n\nCertification of Homeless Status and Residency - A homeless service provider assisting an individual experiencing homelessness may be eligible to complete Form 5862 certifying the named individualâs status and that the individual resides within the boundaries of Missouri. The form completed by the applicant and the eligible homeless services provider, as defined on Form 5862, must complete the form in full and submit it to the local license when applying for a nondriver identification card. Form 5862 applies to an alternative for an address verification document and does not waive document requirements for identity, lawful status, SSN or name change when such are required.\n\nSelf-Certification of Same Address\n\nIf you are a current noncommercial permit, noncommercial driver's license or nondriver license identification cardholder applying for a renewal, duplicate, upgrade or downgrade and the address on your current printed document is the same, you may be eligible to self-certify and waive submission of physical address verification documents.\n\nYou may be eligible to self-certify your residence and mailing address remain the same if you are:\n\nA current REAL ID-compliant cardholder with previously verified residence and mailing address documents scanned and stored on record; or\n\nA current non REAL ID-compliant cardholder who opted to have their address verification and other supporting documents scanned as part of their prior transaction.\n\nExemption for Applicants Age 65 or Older\n\nAn applicant age 65 or older renewing a non REAL ID-compliant, non-commercial driver license, nondriver ID, or instruction permit is exempt from presenting documents for place of birth. If your Missouri driver or nondriver license or instruction permit is expired more than 6 months (184 days), you do not qualify for this exemption. The exemption also does not pertain to those obtaining a new permit/driver license, or nondriver ID, or a request for a REAL ID-compliant document.\n\nExemption for Applicants With a 15-year Missouri Driving History\n\nIf you are a Missourian who has held a driver license or nondriver ID for 15 years or more, you are eligible to obtain a special one-year non REAL ID-compliant, non-commercial driver or nondriver ID. A one-year license may not be renewed, but does provide a full year for you to obtain the documents required to verify lawful status.\n\nIf You Have a Name Change\n\nTo change your name, you must take documents to verify identity, Social Security number, Missouri residency, and proof of your legal name change to a Missouri license office. You may then apply and pay for a duplicate driver license with your new name. Since a new signature must be \"captured\", a new photo may be necessary as well. If your Missouri driver license is within 6 months (184 days) of expiring, you are eligible to renew your driver license early, saving you another trip to the license office.\n\nAt the time of initial application or REAL ID-compliant card issuance, you will be required to present name change verification documents if your current full legal name is different than the name provided on your identity or lawful status verification documents. More than one name change document may be required if you have had multiple name changes.\n\nAcceptable documents to verify a name change include:\n\nCertified Marriage License â Must be issued by: 1) the recorder of deeds in the county in which you were married; 2) the state office of vital statistics; or, 3) an equivalent agency in your state or country of marriage. It must be an original certified document and have the stamp or raised seal of the issuing authority. A church, chapel, or similarly issued certificate is not acceptable. Photocopies and faxes are not acceptable.\n\nCertified Divorce Decree â Must contain your prior full legal name, your court-ordered legal name, and your date of birth and be stamped with the official court seal (date stamps and file stamps are not the official court seal). Photocopies and faxes are not acceptable.\n\nCertified Court Order â Must contain your prior full legal name, your court-ordered legal name, and your date of birth and be stamped with the official court seal (date stamps and file stamps are not the official court seal).\n\nCertified Adoption Papers â Must contain your full legal name, your court-ordered legal name, and your date of birth and be stamped with the official court seal (date stamps and file stamps are not the official court seal).\n\nAmended Birth Certificate â Must be an original certified copy issued by the vital records agency in your birth state. Must have the stamp or raised seal of the issuing authority.\n\nIf you are applying for an initial REAL ID-compliant card at the time of completing your name change request, additional documents may be required. Click here for a complete list of documents required to obtain a REAL ID-compliant Missouri driver or nondriver license or instruction permit. Use the Department's interactive guide to ensure you have the documents required to apply for your REAL ID-compliant card.\n\nSpecial Considerations for Exceptional Circumstances\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, a U.S. citizen who wishes to obtain a new Missouri non REAL ID-compliant, non-commercial instruction permit, driver license, or nondriver ID, and is unable to obtain a government-issued U.S. birth certificate, may provide the following:\n\nA certified \"No Record Statement\" from the vital records agency in your state of birth; and\n\nIf you were born in Missouri, a certified \"No Record Statement\" may be obtained from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, Bureau of Vital Records (the same agency that provides certified birth certificates). This verifies that there is no birth record on file; and\n\nTwo supporting documents. The supporting documents should list the applicantâs name, place of birth, date of birth, or age at the time the document was issued. Each document does not need to have all of the preceding information but the department needs sufficient information to establish place and date of birth. Example: Military discharge papers stating that Mr. John Brown was discharged on March 25, 1945 would not be sufficient since the document does not include Mr. Brownâs place of birth. Supporting documents include, but are not limited to:\n\nMilitary records;\n\nYour child's certified birth certificate (listing you as parent) issued by a vital records agency (a hospital-issued birth certificate or birth registration card is not accepted);\n\nBaptismal record;\n\nAn Insurance policy;\n\nA Social Security Administration numident;\n\nSchool records\n\nEmployment records, and\n\nCensus Bureau record.\n\nNOTE: All other requirements for verification of Social Security number and Missouri residential address still apply.\n\nSubmit the above documents to the Document Review Panel using one of the three methods listed below:\n\nFax: 573-526-4548;\n\nMail: Department of Revenue, PO Box 200, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0200; or\n\nEmail: dlbmail@dor.mo.gov\n\nA response will be provided within two weeks of our receipt of the documents. If you have any questions, you may contact our staff by phone at 573-526-2407 or by email at dlbmail@dor.mo.gov.\n\nHow to Obtain Required Documents\n\nBirth Certificate\n\nIf you were born in Missouri, you must contact the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, Bureau of Vital Records to obtain a certified copy of your birth certificate.\n\nIf you were born in a state other than Missouri, you must contact the appropriate vital records agency in your birth state to obtain a certified copy of your birth certificate.\n\nMarriage License\n\nIf you were married in Missouri, you must contact the Recorder of Deeds in the county where your marriage license was issued to obtain a certified copy of your marriage license.\n\nIf you were married in a state other than Missouri, you must contact the appropriate office in the state in which you were married to obtain a certified copy of your marriage license.\n\nIf you are a Missouri resident who recently married outside the United States, you must first present your non-U.S. marriage license to be recorded at the Recorder of Deeds in the Missouri county where you live. You may then obtain a certified marriage license from that same office.\n\nDivorce Decree"
