        "text": "Employees must provide documentation to their employers to show their identity and authorization to work.\n\nList A Documents\n\nDocuments that Establish Both Identity and Employment Authorization\n\nThe documents on List A show both identity and employment authorization. Employees presenting an acceptable List A document should not be asked to present any other document. Some List A documents are in fact a combination of 2 or more documents. In these cases, the documents presented together count as one List A document.\n\n1. U.S. Passport or U.S. Passport Card\n\n2. Permanent Resident Card or Alien Registration Receipt Card (Form I-551)\n\nTo reduce the risk of fraud and counterfeiting, USCIS redesigns the Permanent Resident Card (PRC) every three to five years. Introduction of new card designs does not mean that cards with previous designs are invalid. Both current and previous cards remain valid until the expiration date shown on the card (unless otherwise noted such as through an automatic extension of the validity period of the PRC as indicated on a Form I-797, Notice of Action, or in a Federal Register notice). USCIS began issuing its most recent redesign on January 30, 2023. Some PRCs issued after that date may still display the previous design format because USCIS uses existing card stock until supplies are depleted. These cards are also known as “Green Cards.”\n\nCurrent Permanent Resident Card issued on January 30, 2023:\n\nPrevious Permanent Resident Card issued on May 1, 2017:\n\nAdditionally, Permanent Resident Cards issued through January 2021 may contain a USCIS-issued sticker extending its validity to the date indicated on the sticker.\n\nPrevious Version of the Permanent Resident Card with signature:\n\nPrevious Version of Permanent Resident Card with notation, \"Signature Waived\":\n\nSee Section 7.1, Lawful Permanent Residents for when a Permanent Resident Card is considered unexpired past the “Card Expires” date.\n\n3. Foreign passport that contains a temporary I-551 stamp or temporary I-551 printed notation on a machine-readable immigrant visa\n\nPassport must contain a temporary Form I-551 stamp or temporary Form I-551 printed notation on a machine-readable immigrant visa (MRIV).\n\nThis document is subject to reverification.\n\n4. Employment Authorization Document that contains a photograph (Form I-766)\n\nTo reduce the risk of fraud and counterfeiting, USCIS redesigns the Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card every three to five years. Introduction of new EAD designs does not mean that previous designs are invalid. Both current and previous cards remain valid until the expiration date shown on the card (unless otherwise noted such as through an automatic extension of the validity period of the EAD indicated on a Form I-797, Notice of Action, or in a Federal Register notice). See Section 5.0 Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization and/or Employment Authorization Documents EADs in Certain Circumstances. USCIS began issuing its most recent redesign on January 30, 2023. Some EADs issued after that date may still display the previous design format because USCIS uses existing card stock until supplies are depleted.\n\nMost Recent Employment Authorization Document:\n\nPrevious Employment Authorization Document:\n\n5. Foreign passport with Form I-94 or Form I-94A with Arrival-Departure Record, and containing an endorsement to work\n\nA foreign passport must be accompanied by a Form I-94/94A Arrival-Departure Record bearing the same name as the passport and containing an endorsement of the individual’s nonimmigrant status and authorization to work for a specific employer based on this status.\n\nThis document may only be used if the period of endorsement has not yet expired and the proposed employment does not conflict with any restrictions or limitations listed on Form I-94 or I-94A, Arrival-Departure Record. Note: Some individuals who present this List A document, such as certain nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors, must present additional documentation in order to prove their work authorization in the U.S.\n\nIn April 2013, Form I-94 was automated at airports and seaports. U.S. Customs and Border Protection no longer automatically provides travelers with a paper copy of Form I-94. Travelers may access Form I-94 information through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website or may request a paper Form I-94 during the inspection process.\n\n6. Passport from the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) or the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) with Form I-94 or Form I-94A indicating nonimmigrant admission under the Compact of Free Association Between the United States and the FSM or RMI\n\nPassport must be presented with Form I-94 or Form I-94A showing nonimmigrant admission under the Compact of Free Association Between the U.S. and the FSM or RMI.\n\nAcceptable Receipts\n\nReceipt for a replacement of a lost, stolen, or damaged List A document.\n\nForm I-94 issued to a lawful permanent resident that contains an I-551 stamp and a photograph of the individual.\n\nForm I-94 with “RE” notation or refugee stamp issued to a refugee.\n\nMay be presented in lieu of a document listed above for a temporary period. For receipt validity dates, see the M-274, Section 4.4 Acceptable Receipts.\n\nList B Documents\n\nDocuments that Establish Identity\n\nThe documents on List B establish only identity.
