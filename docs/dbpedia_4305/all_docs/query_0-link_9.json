        "text": "About Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad\n\nÂ\n\nKohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province is one of the thirty-one provinces of Iran. It is in the southwest of the country and its capital is Yasuj. The people in this province mainly speak the Lurish language. The counties of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province are Bahmai County, Landeh County, Boyer-Ahmad County, Charam County, Dana County, Basht County, and Gachsaran County.\n\nThe province is mostly mountainous in terrain, part of the Zagros range. The mountain range, which is located in Kohgiluyeh and Buyer Ahmad province, is covered with oak forests. Natural springs, singing of the birds, and fresh air fascinate all lovers of nature. Another mountain is Khamin or Khami that is located in Gachsaran country.\n\nKohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province share borders with five provinces: Isfahan and Fars provinces to the east, Bushehr province to the south, Khuzestan to the west, and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari to the north. The province is divided into nine cities and 16 districts, which include 16 cities and more than 1,700 villages.Â\n\nÂ\n\nHome of Iranian Nomads\n\nWe have mentioned already in which this province is located in southwestern Iran. It is a mountainous region where the Zagros Mountains cover most of the northern and eastern parts of its area. The highest point is Mt. Dena with a height of 4409 meters above sea level. considering the geographical features of this province the more you move from the north-eastern mountains to the south-western areas the height of the mountains and the humidity of the weather significantly decreases which causes this province to have two distinct cold Boyer-Ahmad and hot Kohgiluye regions.\n\nTherefore, from the earliest times of civilization, Iranian nomads have found it an ideal home. One of the most important protected territories of the wildlife in this province is called Dena which is rich in terms of species of plants and animals. There are different kinds of trees, forest plants, lawns, herbs, edible plants, and crucial economical resources for local people. This area is also the home of many species of animals such as large size brown bears, leopards, wolves, and wild cats as well as birds like eagles, hawks, partridges, skylarks, and some other local birds like Kamarkoli and Sangcheshm. Other species of animals found in this area include otters, ferrets, and Iranian squirrels as one of the most beautiful species of squirrels in the world.\n\nÂ\n\nThe Ancient City of Dehdasht\n\nBased on historical documents this city was called Belad Shapur in the past and was built by king Shapur I of the Sassanid dynasty. The city was very populated and different facilities like public baths, mosques, caravanserai, and almost two thousand houses were built to create the comfort of city life. As this city has experienced the insecurity of the Safavid dynasty and also the degeneration of the Zand dynasty, it is all in ruins now. The building materials used to make the buildings were stone, mortar of plaster and Saruj (the mortar of lime), soil, ash, and sand. It is only in the dome of the public bath that pieces of brick were used.\n\nÂ\n\nDena National Park\n\nOne of the most beautiful natural areas of the province is the Dena protected Zone or Dena National Park. It has the privilege of having vegetation and animal species.\n\nÂ\n\nKheyrabad Temple\n\nThis temple is located between the cities of Dehdasht and Behbahan, close to the north of the village of Dodeh.

This temple is highly valued and respected by Zoroastrians as a pilgrimage site.\n\nÂ\n\nLake Kuh Gol\n\nThis lake is located at 33 km distance to the north of the city of Yasuj, near the famous Bijan Pass. This lake is the natural habitat of local and migrating birds such as storks, cranes, geese, and different kinds of ducks. Around the lake, you can find a coat of vegetation like clematis, oregano, and other kinds of wild plants.\n\nÂ\n\nTang-e Sarvak Historical Monuments\n\nIn some mountainous parts of Kohgiluye and Boyer-Ahmad, there is a pass called Sarvak or Sulak. There are many stone carvings in this area that are believed to belong to Elimayee tribes who were independent tribes living in the time of the Parthian Kingdom. The common subject of these carvings includes wars, worshiping God, and the coronation of kings.\n\nÂ\n\nSisakht Village\n\nThis village is located at 35 km distance to the northwest of Yasuj at the foothills of a mountain. This village is surrounded by three mountains called Dinar Mountain, Koh Mountain, and Zanguyeh Mountain. This village is the starting point of a climb to Mount Dena. There is heavy snowfall starting from late autumn to early spring. This is also a fascinating region for skiing fans.\n\nÂ\n\nHanging Tulips\n\nThis kind of tulip is only found in red or yellow colors in the Zagros Mountains in Chahar Mahal Va Bakhtiari Province.
