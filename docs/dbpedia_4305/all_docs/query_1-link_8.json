The name of this village is derived from two old bridges on the river close to the village.\n\nOne of the most important attractions of this tourist area is its water springs, which, after merging, create a large river, which has become a factor for the creation of large gardens downstream of this promenade.\n\nEshkaft-e Salman Cave is actually two cave entrances, one of which is much larger than the other. The caves are not very deep and at the deepest point of the caves there is enough light to see.\n\nCategories\n\nHelen is one of the protected areas of Iran that is at the disposal of the Environmental Protection Organization to take care of this valuable ecosystem.\n\nCategories\n\nKhamin Mountain is the catchment area of ​​some major rivers in the region, including \"Shah Bahram\", which has caused significant economic prosperity in this region.\n\nCategories\n\n\"Shah Bahram\" is one of the beautiful rivers of \"Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad\" province, which along its route causes the development and irrigation of many agricultural lands.\n\nCategories\n\nThe water of this wetland is the result of rains and springs from melting snow from the heights.\n\nCategories\n\nBazoft is a beautiful river with a turquoise blue color that passes in a large part of its route, away from the eyes of urban people and through deep valleys."
