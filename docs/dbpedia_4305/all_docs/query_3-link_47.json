        "text": "There are several types of names you can create and use.\n\nDefined name A name representing a cell, range of cells, formula, or constant value. You can create your own defined name, or Excel can create a defined name for you, such as when you set a print area.\n\nTable name A name for an Excel table, which is a collection of data about a particular subject stored in records (rows) and fields (columns). Excel creates a default Excel table name of Table1, Table2, and so on, each time you insert an Excel table. You can change a table's name to make it more meaningful. For more information about Excel tables, see Using structured references with Excel tables.\n\nAll names have a scope, either to a specific worksheet (also called the local worksheet level) or to the entire workbook (also called the global workbook level). The scope of a name is the location within which the name is recognized without qualification. For example:\n\nIf you have defined a name, such as Budget_FY08, and its scope is Sheet1, that name, if not qualified, is recognized only in Sheet1, but not in other sheets.\n\nTo use a local worksheet name in another worksheet, you can qualify it by preceding it with the worksheet name. For example:\n\nSheet1!Budget_FY08\n\nIf you have defined a name, such as Sales_Dept_Goals, and its scope is the workbook, that name is recognized for all worksheets in that workbook, but not other workbooks.\n\nA name must always be unique within its scope. Excel prevents you from defining a name that already exists within its scope. However, you can use the same name in different scopes. For example, you can define a name, such as GrossProfit, that is scoped to Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3 in the same workbook. Although each name is the same, each name is unique within its scope. You might do this to ensure that a formula that uses the name, GrossProfit, is always referencing the same cells at the local worksheet level.\n\nYou can even define the same name, GrossProfit, for the global workbook level, but again the scope is unique. In this case, however, there can be a name conflict. To resolve this conflict, by default Excel uses the name defined for the worksheet because the local worksheet level takes precedence over the global workbook level. If you want to override the precedence and use the workbook name, you can disambiguate the name by prefixing the workbook name. For example:\n\nWorkbookFile!GrossProfit\n\nYou can override the local worksheet level for all worksheets in the workbook. One exception is for the first worksheet, which always uses the local name if there is a name conflict that cannot be overridden.\n\nYou can also create a list of defined names in a workbook. Locate an area with two empty columns on the worksheet (the list will contain two columns, one for the name and one for a description of the name). Select a cell that will be the upper-left corner of the list. On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Use in Formula, click Paste and then, in the Paste Names dialog box, click Paste List.\n\nUse the commands in the Filter drop-down list to quickly display a subset of names. Selecting each command toggles the filter operation on or off, making it easy to combine or remove different filter operations to get the results you want.\n\nTo filter the list of names, do one or more of the following:\n\nSelect:\n\nTo:"
