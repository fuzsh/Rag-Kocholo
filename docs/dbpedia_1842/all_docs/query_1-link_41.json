        "text": "Quick Facts: Although they are a nation with a small population, Uruguay is a country with great football pedigree. Only six countries with smaller populations than Uruguay have qualified for the World Cup. Three of them come from weak confederations, and the other three come out of Europe. This La Celeste squad is captained by Diego Lugano, who was available via Bosman transfer last season, but decided to head straight back to Fenerbahce rather than find a new club. Their all-time most capped player is Rodolfo Rodriguez, a goalkeeper who played in the 1986 World Cup and had a short European stint with Sporting Lisbon afterward. He played in 79 matches. Their all-time leading goalscorer is Hector Scarone, who has 31 goals in 52 matches and was on the 1930 team that won the World Cup. He scored one goal in that competition. If Sebastian Abreu can score three times in this World Cup, he will tie that record, although he has had more caps than Scarone, with 56. Their all-time highest FIFA ranking is 12th in May of 1994, right now they are ranked 18th (which might be a little high).\n\nRecent Team History: Shall we say that Uruguay had a tough time making this tournament? I shall. If not for a goal in San José at the Saprissa, Uruguay would not be here, as they would have lost on away goals to Costa Rica in their two match playoff. Fortunately after Walter Centeno scored back in Montevideo, Uruguay were able to hold on, not concede, and advance to the World Cup Finals. Although Uruguay were World Cup winners in 1930 and 1950, they have not been able to repeat those fortunes, and since 1970, they have only won one match at the World Cup. The Final in 1950 is known as the Maracanazo, where they beat host nation Brazil to win the World Cup in front of 173,000 people at the Maracana in Rio. After that match Brazil changed their kits from white on white into the canary yellow and blue we are used to. This is Uruguay's first time qualifying for the World Cup since 2002, where they scored four goals but could only notch two points. Uruguay are 14 time South American Champions, which is a record their supporters will surely not let their rivals forget about. Diego Forlan will be the only player on this team who has scored in the World Cup before.\n\nLast Three World Cups\n\n1986, Round of 16, loss to Argentina 1 to nil\n\n1990, Round of 16, loss to Italy, 2-0\n\n2002, Eliminated in the Group Stage, 2 points, 4 goals\n\nManagerial Profile: Oscar Tabárez previously coached this team to a small margin of success in the 1990 World Cup, where their only victory came against South Korea in the group stage. At 63 years old he is a well traveled manager, who has managed at clubs such as Boca Juniors and AC Milan. Having managed Uruguay since 2006, he led them through qualifying and to an admirable 4th place finish at Copa America 2007. I won't lie, he led Milan to an absolutely abysmal start before being sacked, this was a Milan side with players like Maldini, Weah, Baggio, Desailly, Costacurta, Baresi, Simone, Boban, and now I'm starting to wonder, is Tabarez such a bad manager that he can't manage those players to success? Maybe so! Luckily I actually know what his tactics are and I can talk about them. Tabarez will either line his team up in a 4-4-2 or 4-3-1-2 with someone in the #10 role, although I don't believe they have a player equipped to handle that position. He is a tinker man and so we could see a lot of things from him, unfortunately in addition to keeping his opposition unbalanced, his team will be too from having to change their approach so often.\n\nLikely Roster\n\nGK: Fernando Muslera (SS Lazio, ITA), Juan Castillo (Deportivo Cali, COL), Martin Silva (Defensor Sporting, URU)\n\nDF: Diego Lugano (Fenerbahce SK, TUR), Martin Caceres (Juventus FC, ITA), Diego Godin (Villarreal CF, ESP), Jorge Fucile (FC Porto, POR), Andres Scotti (Colo Colo, CHI), Maxi Pereira (SL Benfica, POR), Mauricio Victorino (Universidad de Chile, CHI), Sebastian Coates (Nacional, URU)\n\nMF: Walter Gargano (SSC Napoli, ITA), Diego Perez (AS Monaco, FRA), Alvaro Pereira (FC Porto, POR), Nicolas Lodeiro (AFC Ajax, NED), Alvaro Fernandez (Universidad de Chile, CHI), Sebastien Eguren (AIK Fotboll, SWE), Jorge Rodriguez (River Plate, URU),\n\nFW: Diego Forlan (Atletico Madrid, ESP), Luis Suarez (AFC Ajax, NED), Edinson Cavani (US Palermo, ITA), Sebastian Abreu (Botafogo, BRA), Sebastian Fernandez (Club Atletico Banfield, ARG)\n\nOmisssions and Why\n\nFabian Carini formerly of Inter Milan could be one of the goalkeepers, it wouldn't be shocking. He lost his place because he made a lot of mistakes and a change was necessary. If he makes the team and then starts each group stage match, he will be only 2 caps away from being tied as the most played Uruguayan. As far as defense goes, I believe Bruno Silva is a disaster waiting to happen, but could be called in. Where did Carlos Diogo head off to? I thought he was a player who would surely play in the World Cup but he didn't even as much as appear during qualifying, Diogo has fallen off their map. He's their best right back but it seems not to matter. In the midfield we have a few omissions but no one terribly relevant. Ignacio Gonzalez joined Newcastle via loan after Dennis Wise insisted he be signed after watching a few YouTube videos of the player. He is not terrible, but nothing great either. At forward La Celeste have some great primary options, but no depth. I do not believe their forwards will be anyone other than I mentioned. They have a great fifth option in Javier Chevanton, but he doesn't get along with one of the assistant coaches and so he is not in the mix for selection.\n\nLikely Formation\n\nGoalkeepers: Muslera is not a well known goalkeeper, but with Lazio he has been in good form. After every Uruguayan goalkeeper either made a huge mistake with La Celeste or became injured, Muslera stepped in and seized the position, just like he did at Lazio when Juan Pablo Carrizo fell out of form. Without him this would surely be a weak spot for Uruguay, and if he slips up or gets injured, it surely will be.\n\nDefense: With Martin Caceres and Diego Lugano in the Uruguay setup, they will either compose a formidable center back partnership, or a good center and right back partnership. Fucile is definitely not a great defensive left back but he has his mind on the attack and will use all of his efforts on getting forward. Either Godin or Scotti will be starting, Scotti I am mostly unfamiliar with as his lone European excursion was with Rubin Kazan of Russia, and although I do get the Uruguayan league on my television, I never watch it. So back to Godin, he's a young physical defender who can play the ball. Yesterday he got torched by Messi and Bojan but that happens to everyone.\n\nMidfield: Gargano and Eguren are a pretty good backbone in this central midfield, nothing totally spectacular but these two are familar with their competition and know that their bread is buttered in getting the ball up front. Perez helps Monaco play a nasty and unwatchable style in defensive midfield, but on this team he will be played on the right side, albeit defensively. Alvaro Pereira will try to get forward just like Fucile and that could cause problems because teams will be bombing down their right side and attacking successfully I believe.\n\nForwards:\n\ngolazos de diego forlan\n\nAs a player who caused me much grief in mid-week, I am well aware of how good Forlan is. Since traveling to Atletico Madrid for a fee of €21 million, Forlan has been on fire, scoring goals for fun and topping out at 35 last season. Forlan is a goal poacher who specializes in playing the defender to perfection and running in behind the defense onto goal. At Manchester United he wasn't great and most people think of that when it comes to Forlan, but he really is outstanding and a player any club in the world should be interested in. He will score in this World Cup, anybody who has won the Pichichi twice should.\n\nLuis Suárez (El Pistolero) - 2009/2010\n\nA rising star in world football, Luis Suarez has scored a whopping 47 GOALS this season. In the Eredivisie, he has scored more goals than the number of games he has played in. Just crazy. Anyway, Suarez is a multi-faceted forward who can dribble the ball, shoot it, pass it, he's just the total package. He would be gone from Ajax already if not for the gigantic asking price clubs are unwilling to meet, but Suarez is definitely worth. He and Forlan in tandem could push this team a long way but the supply could possibly be lacking. At 23 years old he has a very bright future ahead. He won't, however, be a breakout star because most in Europe area already well aware of his escapades.\n\nBench: Uruguay have a few defenders who are very likely to play off the bench, but truthfully I don't know anything about them, save one. Maxi Pereira is a decent option at right back but isn't fast and doesn't have anything in terms of a quick burst. Nicolas Lodeiro is a hot prospect, who has great dribbling and a very good left footed shot. At forward, Uruguay have two pretty good choices to choose from. For starters, Loco Abreu is a typical South American #9, who is good in the air, experienced, and very well traveled. Abreu has played for 20 clubs, that might give you guys a bit of insight about his personality. Cavani is a player with some guile who is mostly a dribbler, like a poor man's Ibrahimovic. He too has a lot of potential and considering it is unusual for a young player to play in Italy, he does play a lot even at 23.\n\nProjected Finish: I think La Celeste are good for some goals, the problem is that their great strike force is nullified by weak supply and a weak left back that can affect them negatively. They are a little thin as well. Because of that weak left side, they are going to be abused by Ribery in their first match. Uruguay will score but that left side is just a massive hindrance. I like Uruguay to beat South Africa which takes it down to the Mexico match where I believe they will draw. So I've got\n\nEliminated in the Group Stage, 4 points\n\nUruguay just do not have the required left side and midfield to make it through this group. As I said, I love their up front pairing but it is unfeasible to expect them to do better. I know the Soccer Power Index on ESPNsoccernet.com has them rated as the favorites in the Group, I do not agree. With those strikers anything can happen, this may not be the Group of Death, but I rate it as second.\n\nMy final group standings are\n\nFrance 7 points\n\nMexico 5 points\n\nUruguay 4 points\n\nSouth Africa 0 points\n\nUnfortunate to say the host will not get a result, but I believe that's fact.\n\nMoving on, their group stage matches are\n\nJune 11th France v. Uruguay Cape Town Stadium, Cape Town\n\nJune 16th South Africa v. Uruguay, Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Pretoria\n\nJune 22nd Mexico v. Uruguay, Royal Bafokeng Stadium, Rustenburg\n\nTonight, I think I will preview South Korea.\n\nQuick Facts: As one of the two host nations for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, South Korea proved that they belonged on the world stage with an impressive performance. The captain of the Taegeuk Warriors is Park Ji-Sung, someone who has played for both PSV Eindhoven and currently Manchester United. He is the only Korean to have won the Champions League and also the first Asian to play in the Champions League Final. He has only been South Korea's skipper for the last year and a half. South Korea's all-time most capped player is Hong Myung-Bo, a sweeper who captained their team in 2002 and finished out his career with the LA Galaxy. Myung-Bo played for South Korea a whopping 136 times. Right now he manages the Korean Olympic Team. South Korea's all-time leading scorer, Cha Bum-Kun, scored 55 times for the Taegeuk Warriors, and was one of the first Koreans to make their name as a big time scorer in a European league, while playing with Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. All that said, he never scored in the World Cup. Their highest ever FIFA ranking was 17th, in December of 1998. Right now their ranking is far lower, at 49. Their national stadium is the Seoul World Cup Stadium, a ground where South Korea did not win a game in their World Cup, incidentally.\n\nRecent Team History: In 2002, when South Korea joint-hosted the World Cup, they did the impossible, making the semifinal of the World Cup only to lose to Germany. They could not beat Turkey in the Third Place Game, and finished 4th, an admirable and the highest finishing place for any Asian team in the history of the World Cup. Guus Hiddink unfortunately will not be managing in this World Cup, so that feat is not likely to occur for South Africa or any other unfancied nation. That was also the first time South Korea made it out of the Group Stage. In 2006, they beat Togo and then drew France, which I believe meant South Korea were good enough to advance out of their group. By all rights they should have. However, they did not, because Switzerland whooped them. They needed a draw and could not get it. Needless to say, they are still dangerous. Surprisingly the Red Devils have not won an Asian Cup since 1960 despite being the best Asian team by far over that span. In World Cup Qualifying, they did not lose, a feat which was not duplicated by any other Asian squad. Before they lost to Serbia, it had been 27 straight matches without South Korean defeat, a very high mark.\n\nLast Three World Cups\n\n1998, Eliminated in the Group Stage, 1 point, -7 Goal Differential\n\n2002, Fourth Place, loss to Turkey in 4th place match after loss to Germany in Semifinals\n\n2006, Eliminated in the Group Stage, 4 points, -1 Goal Differential\n\nManagerial Profile: Huh Jung-Moo favored young players when he took the South Korean job for the second and third time (first was irrelevant), so now that those young players are quite experienced, they are clearly his favorites. South Korea are extremely organized, and are likely to play a 4-4-2. They will prove extremely difficult for any team to break down as they play as a complete unit. Admittedly I do not know much about their manager other than who he likes to have on his team. They have already released their provisional squad so I merely have to guess which 7 will be left off. Joy! Here's the 30 names.\n\nProvisional Roster\n\nGK: Lee Woon-Jae (Suwon Bluewings, KOR), Kim Young-Kwang (Ulsan Horang-i, KOR), Jung Sung-Ryong (Seongnam Ilwha, KOR).\n\nDF: Kang Min-Soo (Suwon Bluewings, KOR), Kim Hyung-Il (Pohang Steelers, KOR), Oh Beom-Seok (Ulsan Horang-i, KOR), Lee Young-Pyo (Al Hilal, KSA), Kim Dong-Jin (Ulsan Horang-i, KOR), Lee Jung-Soo (Kashima Antlers, JAP), Hwang Jae-Won (Pohang Steelers, KOR), Cha Du-Ri (SC Freiburg, GER), Cho Yong-Hyung (Jeju United, KOR), Kwak Tae-Hwi (Kyoto Sanga, JAP)\n\nMF: Ki Sung-Yong (Celtic FC, SCO), Kim Bo-Kyung (Oita Trinita, JAP), Kim Nam-Il (FC Tom Tomsk, RUS), Park Ji-Sung (Manchester United, ENG), Shin Hyung-Min (Pohang Steelers, KOR), Kim Jae-Sung (Pohang Steelers, KOR), Lee Chung-Yong (Bolton Wanderers, ENG), Gu Ja-Cheol (Jeju United, KOR), Kim Jung-Woo (Gwangju Phoenix, KOR), Kim Chi-Woo (FC Seoul, KOR), Cho Won-Hee (Suwon Bluewings, KOR)\n\nFW: Park Chu-Young (AS Monaco, FRA,), Lee Seung-Ryul (FC Seoul, KOR), Yeom Ki-Hoon (Suwon Bluewings, KOR), Lee Keun-Ho (Jubilo Iwata, JAP), Ahn Jung-Hwan (Dalian Shide FC, CHN), Lee Dong-Gook (Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, KOR)\n\nOmissions and Why\n\nFirst of all, I'm pretty shocked that Seol Ki-Hyeon of Wolves, Reading, and Fulham fame was not selected to this squad. He scored against Italy in 2002, for what it's worth. Second, I was surprised that Lee Chun-Soo was omitted as he scored their first goal when they were facing Togo in 2006. I think Chun-Soo would have been a really good playmaker for South Korea. Now for the next part. I will not even try to pick 7 cuts out of that squad because I am only familiar with half of these players. Instead I will talk about the ones I am familiar with very soon. I will, of course, update this list right before the World Cup.\n\nLikely Formation\n\nGoalkeepers: Lee Woon-Jae will obviously be their starter. With 129 caps, it is the most obvious choice. With two World Cups under his belt, his experience is a prevailing factor in choosing who will be their goalkeeper. Woon-Jae is great on penalties and made a crucial save during penalty kicks against Spain during a match in 2002 where Spain were completely robbed by bad officiating. Kim-Young Kwang is a good bench option and their future goalkeeper, so he can step in for the Red Devils if needed.\n\nDefense: For South Korea's defense, I chose the players who started against Denmark in March as their most likely starters. Any English football fan is familiar with Lee Young-Pyo, a decent left back who has played for PSV, Tottenham Hotspur, and Borussia Dortmund. He is a potential weak link on a backline that will go up against the quickness of players like Lionel Messi. Cha Du-Ri has played his whole professional career in Germany, an unusual thing for any Asian player. When he made their World Cup team in 2002, he was still playing amateur football. As the son of the aforementioned Cha Bum-Kun, he has a lot to live up to. He is very fast and quite tall for a right back. The two central defenders I have in their starting XI are not their most experienced, but have made a good account of themselves as is evidenced by Korea's undefeated record in qualifying. Despite only being in the set-up for two years, they have a good amount of caps.\n\nMidfield:\n\nJi-sung Park Video\n\nAs the video shows, Ji-Sung Park is most known for his hard work, and good passing. Park covers a ton of ground when he is in the match and can play all over the midfield. He doesn't score many goals with Manchester United, but did a good job bagging goals in the high scoring Dutch Eredivisie. He has scored twice in the World Cup, once a notable goal against Portugal that put South Korea into the knockout rounds in 2002, and another to draw France in 2006. For some reason the goalscorer in Ji-Sung Park comes out during the World Cup.\n\nAs for the other players, Chung-Yong Lee has been very solid for Bolton Wanderers during his first season in England. At 21 years old, he is certainly a player to watch and could perhaps become a better player than Park. If South Korea make the Round of 16, Chung-Yong will have had a large part to play. Despite playing for a bad club team he has still risen above all odds and played great. Ki Sung-Yong transferred to Celtic this winter and in his debut at Parkhead against Falkirk he was named Man of the Match by Celtic supporters via their club website. He is affectionately known as the Korean Gerrard, but I find him most comparable to a player like Xabi Alonso in his few appearances and the videos I have watched. I know nothing of Kim-Jung Woo, but he will start I'm guessing.\n\nForwards: Lee Dong-Gook will lead the line in South Africa for the Koreans. It is absolutely necessary for him to put goals into the net, he should be getting great service from their wingers. It will also be up to Chu-Young Park to knock balls down onto his partner's feet. That will be his main priority, although he could score a few goals with his head. Unfortunately, I do not rate him at all, I think he sucks. I became acquainted with him when Freddy Adu was at Monaco and saw some awful performances on his part. I guess we shall see how things turn out next month.\n\nBench: Ahn Jung-Hwan was a very surprising addition in this squad, he has rarely been called up for South Korea in the last three years. In 2002 he scored a golden goal to beat Italy in a shock result, also one where South Korea was for the most part handed the match. Notice a trend? They got lots of benefits because they were the hosts. When he scored that goal, Italian club Perugia in Serie A tore up his contract. No joke. Lee Seung-Ryul could also prove important, he is from the same generation as the two young British-based midfielders I already mentioned. This could in fact be the start of a South Korean golden generation, they will be very strong for Brazil 2014. Kim Dong-Jin is a left back who could replace Lee Young-Pyo and Kim Nam-Il could perhaps feature in defensive midfield for the Argentina match.\n\nThere are some great clips of South Korean fans singing, but I cannot find them right now unfortunately.\n\nProjected Finish: Although the Red Devils are very well organized, they aren't exactly in a group where it is most easy for them to benefit from that. Their first match is against Greece who are perhaps MORE organized. I believe the winner of the group could be decided there in what could be a massively boring match. South Korea know how to pip goals but for some reason I will go with the Greeks and their resolve. Whoever wins that match will then have momentum and Argentina will not be able to break them down. South Korea is pretty likely to lose against Argentina, I feel. Against Nigeria they will get their win, a team without tactics like Argentina will have a hard time, but a team without tactics AND without a star player will have an even more difficult time. This is another very difficult group.\n\nEliminated in the Group Stage, 3 points\n\nGood team but their central defense isn't the fastest. Plus they have a left back problem. Great tactics will only take you so far. I also don't believe Chu-Young Park will do his job correctly. This is the first player I have slammed on and with reason.\n\nTheir Group Stage matches are\n\nJune 12th South Korea vs. Greece, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth\n\nJune 17th Argentina vs. South Korea Soccer City, Johannesburg\n\nJune 22nd Nigeria vs. South Korea Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban\n\nTomorrow, I'm doing Greece. I'm enjoying this more and more as I go. Should be fun!\n\nQuick Facts: Over the last few years, Greek football has reached heights the Greeks previously believed they could only dream of touching. Going into Euro 2004 their odds of winning the competition ranged from 80-1 to 150-1. But yet they won and a generation of Greeks suddenly became much richer. The captain of this Greek side is Giorgos Karagounis, a small midfielder who scored the first goal of Euro 2004, a long-range effort, during a game in which they beat host nation Portugal. When Greece later beat Portugal in the Final, Karagounis was suspended and could not play. Their most capped player is Theodoros Zagorakis, a midfielder who mostly played in Greece, but had stints with Leicester City and Bologna. He retired in 2007, but was their captain in 2004, a year where he finished fifth in Ballon d'Or voting, ultimately losing to Ukranian Andriy Shevchenko. He played 120 matches for Greece. Their all-time leading scorer is Nikos Anastopoulos, who scored 29 goals for his country. His lone stint outside of Greece was with Italian club Avellino. Currently Anastopoulos is a manager who has coached many Greek clubs. Currently they are ranked by FIFA as the 12th best team, but considering they just lost to Senegal, that ranking will surely go down. Their highest ranking was 8th, right before Euro 2004. Currently Greece plays their matches at the Athens Olympic Stadium.\n\nRecent Team History: This is only the second time Greece has qualified for the World Cup. Their first excursion was during USA 1994, and they didn't perform so well. Despite not having to face the travel that Bulgaria, Argentina, and Nigeria had to endure, their three matches at Soldier Field and Foxboro Stadium were horrible. They did not score and gave up 10 goals. Legends Stoichkov, Maradona, and Batistuta torched them for half of those. This came as an absolute shock considering Greece did not lose in their World Cup Qualifying stage. There are no players on that team that played in 1994. As for Euro 2004, they won that tournament by playing an unbelievably defensive style, and scoring only a select few amount of goals, 7 in 6 matches. Qualifying for the 2006 World Cup did not go very well, they finished 4th in their group. Euro 2008 was also not the greatest show of Greek footballing pride, Angelos Charisteas was their lone scorer against a mostly substitute Spain squad. I watched them qualify for the World Cup through Dimitris Salpigidis, who scored in and against Ukraine to send Greece to South Africa.\n\nLast World Cup\n\n1994, Eliminated in the Group Stage, 0 points, -10 GD\n\nManagerial Profile: Otto Rehhagel was Greece's manager in 2004, when they won the Euro and has been their manager for the last nine years. The German has been a football manager since 1974, his longest stint with any club being one with Werder Bremen for 14 years, an astonishingly long time to manage any one club. That team was much different than this Greek one, a true contrast of styles if there ever was one. That Werder Bremen team played with a quick, up-tempo pace and great central defending. This Greek team will pick a few instances during the match where they will counterattack although they are certainly capable of playing a more offensive style. The Greeks will truly turn every match into their kind of match, a grueling, slow, and physical style of defending with very rare movements at goal. They will very likely play a 3-4-3, or a 5-3-2, or maybe even a 3-3-3-1 with defensive principles and size up front rather than speed or calculated passing. Maybe even a 4-5-1! In any case they will try to clog up the entire pitch. At 71 years old this will surely be Otto's last managerial experience and he will be hoping to end his career nicely. His teams are well spirited and so Greece will perform at their best.\n\nLikely Roster\n\nGK: Kostas Chalkias (PAOK, GRE), Michalis Sifakis (Aris Salonika, GRE), Alexandros Tzorvas (Panathinaikos FC, GRE)\n\nDF: Vangelis Moras (Bologna FC, ITA), Sotiris Kyrgiakos (Liverpool FC, ENG), Sokratis Papastathopoulos (Genoa CFC, ITA), Nikos Spiropoulos (Panathinaikos FC, GRE), Loukas Vyntra (Panathinaikos FC, GRE), Giourkas Seitaridis (Panathinaikos FC, GRE), Avraam Papadopoulos (Olympiakos FC, GRE), Vasilis Torosidis (Olympiakos FC, GRE)\n\nMF: Giorgos Karagounis (Panathinaikos FC, GRE), Kostas Katsouranis (Panathinaikos FC, GRE), Alexandros Tziolis (AC Siena, ITA), Christos Patsatzoglou (AC Omonia, CYP), Sotiris Ninis (Panathinaikos FC, GRE), Grigoris Makos (AEK Athens, GRE)\n\nFW: Angelos Charisteas (FC Nuremberg, GER), Georgios Samaras (Celtic FC, SCO), Theofanis Gekas (Hertha Berlin, GER), Dimitris Salpigidis (Panathinaikos FC, GRE), Pantelis Kapetanos (Steaua Bucharest, ROM), Ioannis Amanatidis (Eintracht Frankfurt, GER)\n\nOmissions and Why\n\nAngelos Basinas is Greece's most prominent omission, but the midfielder who plays his football at Portsmouth already said it is best for the Greek team if Otto does not call him up. If Otto does call him up, he will simply not go play in South Africa. Basinas is a solid player who I believe would be useful in the Greek midfield. If the defenders I named are not selected I would be very surprised. Kostas Manolas should probably be in the side but at 18 maybe isn't even on Rehhagel's radar. Greek fans are hoping Vasilis Pliatsikas of Schalke 04 will be in the side as a midfielder, but he is injured. If he is fit, he will be there. Kostas Mitroglou of Olympiakos could possibly make the team ahead of Amanatidis, but I'm not sure about that. Apparently Rehhagel doesn't want to take Amanatidis to South Africa but what choice does he have?\n\nLikely Formation\n\nAgain this really is not a sensible formation and not the best players, but certainly the most likely by a wide margin.\n\nGoalkeepers: Tzorvas is not the experienced option but after asking a Greek friend of mine he is certain Tzorvas will be the Greek goalkeeper. Chalkias is getting up there in age and after the retirement of Antonios Nikopolidis, perhaps it is not best to continue on the path of calling up old goalkeepers. The 39 year old echoed that thought when he retired from the national squad in 2008. In any case none of these players have played many matches for Greece.\n\nDefense: Greece have a unique situation in which they will be playing five defenders, with two of them out of position. You can call that a 5-4-1 if you'd like because those two defensive minded wide midfielders surely will not be attacking much. The defenders are chosen more based on size than actual footballing ability. At the moment I will cover the back three. Sotiris Kyrgiakos is the exception and has been somewhat of a revelation at Liverpool. The Greek Pirate has shown a good tactical acumen and strong defensive ability for Rafael Benitez this season. A season which has sucked, but one where Kyrgiakos has also become one of my favorite players. The large defender has put forward a great account of himself, replacing Sami Hyypia quite well. At 21, Papastathopoulos has played a fair bit for Genoa and is looking to solidify his place at that club. After Euro 2008 he has been a consistent fixture in the Greek team. Moras is 6'5 and a typical Rehhagel player. He needs a libero in his teams and Moras plays that position well enough. A 2009 match against Denmark was his first appearance.\n\nMidfield: Vyntra is the first defender being played in a midfield position. He doesn't have much skill, but he does have what Rehhagel likes, a physical presence with average speed and good size for his position. Spiropoulos is different than the other defenders, he can actually play multi-faceted football and help in the counterattack. The Giannina product won't get many chances to shine but he could look very good. At 5'7 he is the anti-Otto. In central midfield Giorgos Karagounis is not only the Greek captain, but at 33 years old, one of Greece's all-time greatest footballers. The dimunitive midfielder is one of very few Greeks to play for clubs the stature of Inter Milan and Benfica. Karagounis doesn't score much, but he knows how to score at critical times. He is a strong passer and has good vision. Kostas Katsouranis is at times criticized for the lack of emotion and effort he gives for Greece. Katsouranis also played for Benfica, but in a more defensive role than his midfield partner. In 2005 he was Greek Footballer of the Year after putting in some great performances at AEK Athens and scoring 10 times.\n\nForwards: It's a little bit hard to find starting words with this group. Instead I will post a video.\n\nTheofanis Gekas\n\nAs the video shows, Theofanis Gekas doesn't score the most flashy goals, but he just scores, I don't know how to describe it. He's not fast, not tall, not quick, just very smart and times his runs perfectly. Gekas has played all over Europe, but in the Bundesliga is where he has made his name. With VfL Bochum in 2006-2007, he led the league with a surprising number of goals, 20. Since leaving Bochum he has floundered a little bit at club level, but not for Greece. He scored 10 goals in qualifying to lead the charts over Edin Dzeko and Wayne Rooney. Great names to be mentioned with. Although Gekas is not of that quality he clearly knows how to get goals and Greece will depend on him a great deal.\n\nSamaras has also had a rough time at club level. Since leaving Heereenveen, Samaras has had two trips that differ greatly from one another. First, with Manchester City, he had an incredibly tough time breaking into the team despite not having much competition for position. That isn't a great sign. In 55 matches he scored eight goals, quite a poor mark. With Celtic he has fared much better, quadrupling his goal mark in only a few more matches. Even still, Samaras is having a rough time, lately he was slammed by Neil Lennon for not putting in a 90 minute effort and the temporary Celtic manager suggested Samaras should be made to leave for the good of the squad. At 6'4 Samaras doesn't really play equal to his size, he likes to go on long runs and finishes mostly with his feet. He does score goals in the air, but not nearly as often as with the feet. Quite an interesting player is what he is.\n\nDimitris Salpigidis is not special at right wing although he scored the goal to put Greece in the World Cup. He scores lots of goals for Pana but with Greece has only scored 3 times in 34 matches played. He is more equipped to be one of the two strikers in a 4-4-2 but will not be played there by Rehhagel. As such it will not be easy for him to score although he is a quality player, perhaps even the best Greek striker. He is too small for Rehhagel, but I think he's a better goal poacher than Gekas and has some speed to go with it.\n\nBench: In defense, well, Greece have many options. For starters Seitaridis is likely to feature if the formation changes. So is Torosidis. Both are right backs but Rehhagel will find room for both of them should things not turn out to his liking against South Korea. Papadopoulos could start in place of Papastathopoulos in their first match against the Koreans. I find that quite likely considering South Korea will be as well-prepared as Greece and Papadopoulos is slightly older and thus, more experienced. He is physical but also can play the ball decently. For once it is possible that all these men will play.\n\nSotiris Ninis is perhaps the greatest Greek prospect in the history of their footballing program. Ninis is Albanian-born but has never once considered the idea of playing for them, as he is of Greek descent. Were Greece's manager not a dinosaur, Ninis would certainly be the first name on the Greek teamsheet. He lacks pace but shows great vision and a true knack for passing. Ninis is Greece's youngest ever scorer, that goal coming when he was just over 18. Amazingly he is 20 years old and has only played twice since then. Ninis has truly unlimited potential and one day will make his mark with a giant football club.\n\nThe rest of their midfield is quite frankly, made up of players who Greek's think suck. They would much prefer Pliatsikas but he tore some knee ligaments. Grigoris Makos is in truly rotten form, but he played well prior to this season and so perhaps he will be called up, improve his level of play, and do a solid job.\n\nAngelos Charisteas defines the word suck, but Rehhagel will call him in anyway. Charisteas has scored a grand total of three goals for Nuremberg in league play since 2008. It truly does not get much worse than that. Rehhagel is hoping that Charisteas will rediscover anything that caused him to score the lone goal in the Euro 2004. Kapetanos has only been called to the national team once, and admittedly I know nothing about him.\n\nProjected Finish: Before writing this up, I had Greece finishing at the top of their group due to sound defending, good tactics, and the ability to score from set pieces. Although I do not think much of them as a team, I believe it will take very sound organization to beat this side. Against South Korea in their first match is absolutely perfect for Greece. They will be facing a side who is similar both in mind and spirit. They both know that if there is a winner, that team in all likelihood will be moving on. I will take Greece to score from a corner, using their size to beat a very small Korean team. They are just good at that. Greece must think they are lucky to play Nigeria after. Nigeria beat them in 1994, but that has no relevance. A very disorganized side can have massive problems against Greece. I also believe they can win this match, although I am not completely sure they will. Against Argentina I do not believe they will have a lot to play for, and they will lose knowing they are already in the next round. Argentina may be in that same boat and this could be a battle for position. I originally had them finishing at the top of their group, but after writing it out, that just cannot happen for Greece. I am about to change my predictions.\n\nRound of 16, loss to France, 6 points in Group B\n\nSo now this means Mexico would play Argentina in the first knockout round. Hm. I actually do not think Mexico will win that match, I have Argentina moving on. What that means for France is that they will be headed into a match with ENGLAND in the Quarterfinals. And there, France will go out, because this England is not the same as the others, and France's defending is pretty weak.\n\nTheir Group Stage matches are\n\nJune 12th South Korea vs. Greece, Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth\n\nJune 17th Greece vs. Nigeria, Free State Stadium, Bloemfontein\n\nJune 22nd Greece vs. Argentina, Peter Mokaba Stadium, Polokwane\n\nI am going to preview Nigeria on Tuesday and revise my projections right now. However, I believe I should mention Traianos Dellas, who scored what will likely be the last Silver Goal in the history of football, and led the Greek defense in 2004. I did not forget to mention him but merely submitted my post too early.\n\nQuick Facts: The Super Eagles of Nigeria go into this tournament with a clearly defined goal, get past the group stage and be the team from Africa that ventures furthest into this competition. One thing the Super Eagles will do is attack and goals should be plentiful in their matches. With new coach Lars Lagerback, they must truly believe they can accomplish that goal. Their captain is Nwankwo Kanu, a player who, as the video mentioned may not be more than a substitute in their games. His impact will still be evident both in spirit and on the pitch. Kanu is by far the most decorated footballer in African history. Not only has he been African Footballer of the Year, he is the only player in the Premier League to have won the Premier League, Champions League, UEFA Cup, FA Cup, and an Olympic Gold Medal. For matches where he does not start, Joseph Yobo will wear Nigeria's armband. Nigeria's most capped player is Mudashiru Lawal, a midfielder who played 86 times for the Super Eagles in the 70's and 80's. Kanu is a mere five matches away from tying that mark. Their goal chart is topped by Rashidi Yekini, who scored 37 times in 70 matches for Nigeria. He scored Nigeria's first World Cup goal, and led them out of the Group Stage and less than one minute away from defeating Italy and reaching their first Quarterfinal match. Yekini was Nigeria's first African Footballer of the Year, due to his numerous amounts of goals for Portuguese club Vitoria Setubal. Currently Nigeria are ranked 20th, but right before the 1994 they were ranked an astounding 5th, and it was well deserved.\n\nRecent Team History: Nigeria surprisingly have also won a fair share of tournaments. In 1980 and 1994, they won the African Cup of Nations, but in the most recent competition this year, they merely finished 3rd. A good result for most, but not up to Nigerian expectations. Surely Nigerians scammed many more people out of money as punishment! In 1996 the Nigerians shockingly defeated Brazil and Argentina on their way to an Olympic Gold Medal, however in 2008, they did not repeat that feat against a very tough Argentinian side. With that in mind, beware that Nigeria are both a good tournament team and always boast great youth prospects.\n\nUSA 1994 was where Nigeria had their best performance. Roberto Baggio destroyed that and since the Super Eagles have been yearning to reach the Quarterfinals as they feel they were unjustly beaten on that day. That team however was not their best. France 1998 boasted the best Nigerian team we have seen yet. With such stars as Yekini, Jay-Jay Okocha, Kanu, Celestine Babayaro and coached by Bora Milutinovic, they were convinced that they should be able to reach the quarters, but Denmark denied them that and put a 4-1 beating on Nigeria in the Stade de France. In 2002 Nigeria were not very fortunate. I guess my point is that every Nigerian team we have seen yet is pretty good. 2006 would perhaps have boasted their greatest amount of talent with two solid generations of Nigerian footballers coming together at just the right time, but one loss to Angola in Luanda lost them the group based on head to head results. Even still the group was far too easy to let slip through their fingers. One loss was all it took.\n\nLast Three World Cups\n\n1994, Knocked Out in Round of 16, 2-1 loss to Italy in Extra Time\n\n1998, Knocked Out in Round of 16, 4-1 loss to Denmark\n\n2002, Eliminated in the Group Stage, 1 point, -2 GD\n\nManagerial Profile: Lars Lagerback was with Sweden for quite a long time. In the 11 years he managed his homeland, he didn't quite get very far. He made it out of the group stage and lost to Holland in Euro 2006, and in World Cup 2006, he led Sweden to defeat against Germany. Sweden was quite clearly in the midst of the best teams the country could possibly have and that time was lost. He signed onto the Nigerian cause specifically for this tournament. His attempt at qualifying Sweden for this World Cup did not turn out so well. A third place finish against the likes of Denmark and Portugal is never acceptable. In qualifying he nearly played the same formation the whole way through. A classic 4-4-2 was the formation of choice for Lars Lagerback, however for the last World Cup, he quite enjoyed a 4-1-3-2. I do not think however that Nigeria have the attacking midfielders to support that, so 4-2-2 or 4-3-3 it could be. I actually have it as a 4-2-1-3 where Kalu Uche plays slightly ahead of the two defensive midfielders. I am quite interested to see if Lagerback will stick around or if he is just there for the tournament. In any case he is no doubt an upgrade as Nigeria's previous manager basically just let them run around and play individually, but coincidentally, this is the same formation Amodu played.\n\nNigeria have released a 44 man provisional squad, I will narrow it down to 23 and explain why I'm keeping some players off.\n\nLikely Roster\n\nGK: Vincent Eneyama (Hapoel Tel Aviv, ISR), Austin Ejide (Hapoel Petah Tikva, ISR), Dele Aiyenugba (Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv, ISR)\n\nDF: Chidi Odiah (CSKA Moscow, RUS), Joseph Yobo (Everton FC, ENG), Danny Shittu (Bolton Wanderers, ENG), Taye Taiwo (Olympique Marseille, FRA), Rabiu Afolabi (Red Bull Salzburg, AUT), Onyekachi Apam (OGC Nice, FRA), Dele Adeleye (Sparta Rotterdam, NED), Olubayo Adefemi (US Boulogne, FRA)\n\nMF: Kalu Uche (UD Almeria, ESP), Seyi Olofinjana (Hull City, ENG), John Obi Mikel (Chelsea FC, ENG), Sani Kaita (Alania Vladikavkaz, RUS), Ayila Yussuf (Dynamo Kiev, UKR), Dickson Etuhu (Fulham FC, ENG)\n\nFW: Nwankwo Kanu (Portsmouth FC, ENG), Obafemi Martins (VfL Wolfsburg, GER), Yakubu Aiyegbeni (Everton FC, ENG), Peter Odemwingie (Lokomotiv Moscow, RUS), John Utaka (Portsmouth FC, ENG), Victor Obinna (Malaga CF, ESP)\n\nOmissions and Why\n\nWell, most of the players that have been called in that I left out, are Nigerian based players that don't have a hope of playing for Nigeria. The only countries who will be put in the unique situation of having no players who play in the league of their country are African ones, I'm guessing. With Nedim Onouha not committing to Nigeria, I will have to assume that he wants to play for England in the future and will not be a Super Eagle for this World Cup. If he decides to play for Nigeria he will instantly be put into their starting XI in place of Odiah. Who will stay home is anyone's guess. Nigeria have two defenders that are good enough for their team that play in Switzerland, but they have been frozen out. In midfield I don't expect anyone different, but where I could radically differ from Lagerback is up front. I left out two very strong strikers and a prospect. Chinedu Obasi has been a fixture both for Hoffenheim and for Nigeria, with 25 goals over three years at Hoffenheim and my assumption that being based so closely to Germany for so long may influence Lagerback, perhaps he will be in the squad. Ikechukwu Uche is the real puzzler here, not Victor Anichebe who doesn't really belong. Uche has made a name for himself in Spain where he has spent nearly his whole career. He is fast and somewhat dangerous if in fact he can find himself onside consistently. He was injured for most of the season and so I left him off.\n\nLikely Formation\n\nI know, this formation is crazy, right? I actually don't think so. Utaka or Odemwingie will be coming in from the right no matter where they are played, I just happen to think Lagerback will prefer Utaka's pace.\n\nGoalkeepers: All I have to say is I hope for their sake Enyeama doesn't get hurt. It's weird that these three men all play club football in Israel.\n\nDefenders: I had a pretty good video picked out for Taye Taiwo, at least until I turned my speakers up and the music was horrible. Anyway, the Nigerian left back possesses perhaps the hardest shot in the entire world. When I say I have not seen someone who shoots the ball as hard as he does, I'm not lying. His left foot is amazing and I hope he scores a scorcher in South Africa. Shittu is just a barely average center back who will simply be looking to not make mistakes. This team is going to get ripped by Argentina because the defending capability of their players just isn't up to snuff. They will hope that Yobo can provide something as their most experienced defender, but honestly I doubt it. With the additions of defenders like Johnny Heitinga, Sylvain Distin, and Phil Jagielka, Yobo hasn't featured nearly as much as he did when he first joined Everton. He has still played 218 matches for the Blues, that my friends is a lot. Odiah is completely attack minded but also makes silly mistakes and doesn't have much of a positional sense. He's not going to save any goals to say the least, in fact he could be sent off as he was against Inter in the Champions League. If he provides good service to the forwards he will have done his job.\n\nMidfield: Most people here are familiar with John Obi Mikel. He is the anti-thesis of what you'd think this team represents. At defensive midfield he can quite literally contribute nothing to the attack. And frankly, he can't even pass the ball well. One thing's for certain, he is no Claude Makelele. The kid can't shoot and can tackle only adequately. Big clubs probably shouldn't have a player like this as a fixture in their starting XI, Chelsea's fixation with him is mystifying. Last season he played 55 matches! That said he has played better this season than he has ever played before, perhaps he can become a good player with more work. His positioning is not great either and he has a tough time reading the play. Speaking of that, I just described Olofinjana too! Only difference is that the aloof midfielder can score with his head from set pieces and he runs around the whole of the pitch a lot better. In all other categories, he is worse than Mikel, but they can live with that. I believe Dickson Etuhu should play in place of Olofinjana, but that's unlikely.\n\nUche will play a more advanced role and certainly will join in the attack and perhaps leave the last two bands of the formation exposed. Uche is very fast and could be a spark for a Nigeria side that he has only played 18 matches for. With good finishing perhaps he may even play as a striker rather than a midfielder. If that's the case then we should anticipate a drastic formation and personnel change as Lagerback will have to make his bed prior to the World Cup.\n\nForwards: I don't believe I have posted a three forward attack yet, but here I am. I am merely going off a hunch here. John Utaka hasn't featured for Portsmouth too much since moving there from Rennes, but he is capable of putting in a few blinding performances for the Super Eagles. Considering Odiah will make many overlapping runs on his side and vice-versa, they will both need to provide good service and show the ability to keep beating defenders.\n\nObafemi Martins goal vs. Spurs\n\nMartins is easy to describe but yet confusing at the same time. He has a flair for the spectacular but the spectacular doesn't happen very often. No matter how ordinary his goals may be, the celebration will always be spectacular. I guess what I'm trying to say is that despite his speed, he isn't very consistent, but on his day Martins is a match winner. I can't be the only one out there who found it crazy that he was sold from Inter to Newcastle of all places (no offense), but that's football I guess. I don't know if that was 10 million Euros well spent or not. At Wolfsburg Martins has been quite alright, but with Dzeko and Grafite in the team minutes are quite scarce. Since March 21st Martins has been used exclusively as a substitute and has not scored. That date was the same week as Wolfsburg's exit from the Europa League. Do the math! Coincidentally he has not scored since that exit. 7 goals in 24 appearances sums up his career, right?\n\nAs a target player, Yakubu is pretty important to Nigeria's success. It is imperative that he does his job correctly and finishes the chances he will surely be receiving. Yakubu is a threat but has not had the best season, but if he scores, more than likely it will be with his head. Half of Yakubu's goals this season have been headed in, and he has knocked some balls down and assisted on other players goals too. In the 2007-2008 season he was the first Everton player since Peter Beardsley to score 20 goals in a season. Not surprising at all, to be fair.\n\nBench: To cover midfield and defense, I believe these three players will be the most likely to make appearances. We've got Dickson Etuhu, Rabiu Afolabi, and Onyekachi Apam. To be fair, I have maybe seen the latter two play a grand total of one time each. Etuhu is a pretty decent tackler who may feature both now and in Fulham's Europa League Final against Atletico Madrid, he stays in front of the defense and does not stray. That could be a good thing for the Super Eagles.\n\nNigeria have a LOT of good bench forwards. Odemwingie followed the money after a good Champions League campaign with Lille back in 2007 where he was part of a very good Lille attack along with Abdul Kader Keita and one of my favorites, Michel Bastos. Odemwingie isn't terribly fast I don't think, but he knows how to score goals and get behind defenses. It's possible he plays the right side of that 4-2-1-3 instead of Utaka. Victor Obinna will start in their last match, I believe. You guys might like him, I won't hype him up at all. As for Kanu, he will play a cameo role considering I figure Nigeria will find their way behind often, but I don't think he is really all that relevant. He cannot help Nigeria but he is there as a relic, and he surely will retire from football once Nigeria head out. If his squad place was based on merit, then Obasi and Ikechukwu Uche would surely be there ahead of him.\n\nProjected Finish: I don't really like Nigeria's chances. First of all, this team is full of wildly inconsistent players. They are also unequipped to deal with someone else's potent attack. So when they go against Argentina and take an ass whooping, that could destroy their players spirit and knock them into a shell against Greece. That's why I have them losing there. After they lose to Argentina, although Nigeria have proven otherwise in their World Cup history, I believe they will fold up and start to think they have nothing to play for. And unfortunately they will wind up with no points.\n\nEliminated in the Group Stage, 0 points\n\nNow this is a really good team and the second most-talented in Group B, but I have a serious doubt about their team spirit and if their coach is invested into making them the best team possible. That thing of playing Argentina in Match #1 with that defense is a confidence destroyer and will ruin them. Maybe they can draw Greece, I think that's possible. If they do and can keep Argentina from breaking the dam into pieces, maybe with a win against South Korea their goal differential can hold up and they can move on. We shall see. Because of this, Group B is incredibly interesting. Two well-organized sides against two teams with a penchant for good offensive play.\n\nTomorrow I will preview Argentina, who when I think about it more and more, has a shot at making the Final, even with a bad manager. Thursday I'm taking a day off."
