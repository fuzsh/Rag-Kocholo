I used the January rankings from 2004-2008. I realize the FIFA rankings are (sometimes seriously) flawed but it still gives a decent barometer of where the confederations stand.\n\nIt's been pretty similar on a yearly basis, with Asia, South America, and CONCACAF switching places a few times. Every year Europe tops the list and Africa comes in second. Not Surpisingly, Oceania is way off the pace on a yearly basis even when Australia was a member in the 04-06 average.\n\nThe average rank is the average of the 1-10 placed nations in each region. The Best Rank represents the top ranked team in each region and the Worst Rank is what the number 10 ranked team in each region was ranked in January of each year.\n\nAvg.

I wondered how they did it, so I looked around a bit and here's what I found.\n\nThe technology is made by a Swiss company, LiberoVision.\n\nInfo from an ESPN press release:\n\n“ESPN Axis” creates \"virtual\" replays using video captured by cameras covering the live action event. Images fed from the game cameras are calibrated and seamed together to create virtual freeze-frames from multiple angles. The angles of view may be tilted upwards by 90 degrees -- from pitch level to direct overhead shots -- creating three-dimensional, birds-eye views of key plays from multiple vantage points.\n\nExcerpt About \"Axis\" technology From the Sports Video site, SVG, article By Ken Kerschbaumer:\n\nESPN ties together two camera feeds from different sides of the stadium to allow for analysts to swing around 90 degrees and show the backside of a play or overhead for a bird’s eye view. It takes approximately 10 minutes to process the video and build the graphics however Liberovision is working hard to shorten the time to air.\n\n“The minimum number of cameras you need is two,” says Stephan Würmlin, LiberoVision co-founder, adding that more cameras will require more processing time but will add more replay angles.\n\nThe camera streams are ingested into an EVS server and then fed to the LiberoVision system that is 5 rack-units high. ESPN is using two software products, DiscoverEye, which builds the virtual graphics, and Interactive Telestrator, providing the ability to place 3D telestrator graphics that change perspective as the replay is played out to viewers.\n\n“It gives us five camera angles even though only two camera angles are being used,” says Toms.\n\nHere is a page from the brochure on LiberoVision's Website\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nAxis really is a cool technology, like bringing a video game replay to the real world. It's unreal to me that no additional infrastructure is needed in the stadium to pull this off. I assumed there were about 100 cameras all over the stadium to do the effect but those smart Swiss have made it much simpler. Hopefully future coverage of Champion's League and MLS will receieve the Axis treatment.\n\nHere is an example of Axis from the \"was he offside?\" Netherlands goal vs. Italy in the Euro group stages.\n\nCheck out the LiberoVision website for videos and more information on the technology.\n\nA compilation of statistics from the official Euro 2008 page for the players and teams that are remaining in the tournament.

They were born in Paramaribo, Suriname.\n\nActive European Based Players Born in Suriname:\n\nClarence Seedorf - Netherlands (86) and AC Milan\n\nEdgar Davids - Netherlands (74) and Free Agent - LA Galaxy?\n\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink - Netherlands (23) and Cardiff City\n\nRomeo Castelen - Netherlands (10) and Hamburger SV\n\nAndwélé Slory - Netherlands (2) and Feyenoord\n\nDwight Tiendalli - Netherlands U21 and Sparta Rotterdam\n\nEdson Braafheid - Netherlands U21 and FC Twente\n\nLorenzo Davids - Netherlands U21 and NEC Nijmegen\n\nNordin Wooter - Netherlands U21 and AEK Larnarca (Cyprus)\n\nLeroy George - FC Utrecht\n\nSigourney Bandjar - Excelsior Rotterdam\n\nFabian Wilnis - Ipswich Town (Released end of 2008)\n\nMark De Vries - Dundee United\n\nDarl Douglas - Willem II\n\nKurt Elshot - NAC Breda\n\nPurrel Fränkel - De Graafschap\n\nCerezo Fung a Wing - De Graafschap\n\nKelvin Maynard - FC Volendam\n\nSamuel Koejoe - FSV Frankfurt (2.Bundesliga Germany)\n\nNicandro Breeveld - FC Omniworld\n\nAdilio Augustin - Haarlem\n\nRodney Cairo - Haarlem\n\nToevaro Pinas - Stormvogels Telstar\n\nThere are dozens of players playing in Holland and elsewhere that could have played for Suriname. However, Suriname's government doesn't allow for dual citizenship, so once a player accepts another nation (generally the Netherlands), he can no longer return to play for his home country. Conversely, Dutch born Surinamese don't play for Suriname either, as they'd have to give up their Dutch citizenship to do so.\n\nIf their government rules were different, Suriname would very likely be one of the top teams in CONCACAF and the Caribbean region, similar to Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago who've used many players that are based in and were born in England.\n\nIt's not only an issue for soccer players as about 350,000 people from the small Brazilian neighbor have left the country to live in the Netherlands. That is about a quarter of the entire population of the country.\n\nI'm sure there are even more players overseas, but without knowing the Dutch language, it is difficult to find player information for the second division and below.\n\nIncluded with these players are many great players of Surinamese descent that were born in the Netherlands.\n\nRuud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Aron Winter, Gerald Vanenburg, Patrick Kluivert, Ryan Babel, Royston Drenthe, Boy Waterman, Ryan Donk, Gianni Zuiverloon, Maceo Rigters, and many more.\n\nPretty impressive list.\n\nSuriname's Little Secret from Fifa.com\n\nInteresting Geography Fact:\n\nSuriname was aquired by the Netherlands in a trade with England for New Amsterdam, the present day Manhattan.\n\nThis map shows where the players on Russia's Euro 2008 squad came from in the vast country. I assumed that the whole team would be from Moscow and St Petersburg, but they are from all over the country, including one player from eastern Ukraine and two from the Siberian region of Russia.\n\nGK Igor Akinfeev - Moscow\n\nGK Vyacheslav Malafeev - St Petersburg\n\nGK Vladimir Gabulov - Republic of North Ossetia-Alania\n\nDF Sergei Ignashevich - Moscow\n\nDF Aleksandr Anyukov - Samara Oblast\n\nDF Aleksei Berezutski - Moscow\n\nDF Vasili Berezutski - Moscow\n\nDF Denis Kolodin - Volgograd Oblast\n\nDF Roman Shirokov - Moscow\n\nDF Renat Yanbayev - Krasnodar Krai\n\nMF Sergei Semak - Luhansk Oblast (Ukraine)\n\nMF Igor Semshov - Moscow\n\nMF Diniyar Bilyaletdinov - Moscow\n\nMF Vladimir Bystrov - Leningrad Oblast\n\nMF Yuriy Zhirkov - Tambov Oblast\n\nMF Konstantin Zyryanov - Prem Krai\n\nMF Dmitri Torbinski - Krasnoyarsk Krai (Siberia)\n\nMF Ivan Saenko - Voronezh Oblast\n\nMF Oleg Ivanov - Moscow\n\nMF Andrei Arshavin - St Petersburg\n\nFW Dmitri Sychev - Omsk Oblast (Siberia)\n\nFW Roman Pavlyuchenko - Krasnodar Krai\n\nFW Roman Adamov - Volgograd Oblast\n\nBy Territory:\n\n8 - Moscow\n\n2 - St Petersburg\n\n2 - Krasnodar Krai\n\n2 - Volgograd Oblast\n\n1 - North Ossetia-Alania\n\n1 - Samara Oblast\n\n1 - Luhansk Oblast (Ukraine)\n\n1 - Tambov Oblast\n\n1 - Prem Krai\n\n1 - Krasnoyarsk Krai(Siberia)\n\n1 - Voronezh Oblast\n\n1 - Leningrad Oblast\n\n1 - Omsk Oblast (Siberia)\n\nGeography Facts:\n\nKrai and Oblast are terms that roughly translate to province, region, or territory.\n\nDmitri Torbinski and Dmitri Sychev, both from areas of Siberia, are the only two players from the Asian section of Russia.\n\nVladimir Gabulov's North Ossetia-Alania is a Republic in Russia, or an area of non-Russian Ethnicity. It is in southern Russia's Caucasus region near disputed Chechnya. Many people speak Ossetic in this Republic which is an Iranian language.\n\nDmitri Torbinski was born in Norilsk, Siberia, which is the northernmost city in Siberia and the world's second largest city above the Arctic Circle with a population of just over 200,000 (Murmansk in Northwest Russia is the largest). It's also one of only two large cities in a continuous permafrost zone.\n\nRenat Yanbayev is of Tatar ethnicity who are Turkic people that once made up the western part of Genghis Khan's army in the 13th century. Today there are nearly 7 million Tatars in the Caucasus region of southern Russia, with 97% practicing Sunni Islam.\n\nSergei Semak is from Ukraine's easternmost province, Luhansk Oblast, where nearly 70 percent of the population speak Russian rather than Ukrainian.\n\nMagpies, Zebras, Bianconeri, Os Alvinegros, The Black Eagles, Die Schwarz-Weißen, whatever the nickname, there are quite a few clubs that sport the vertical black and white stripes on their shirts.

They win, then lose a time or two before winning again. They're also the only team in the league with zero draws to this point.\n\nI wanted to get a visual look at how the different teams in MLS have reached their current point totals. This chart shows a week by week total for each Eastern Conference team. I'm still working on the Western Conference, it should be up in the near future.\n\nThe most interesting one for me is the white Kansas City dot. It goes up,up,up,up and then basically flatlines after week four. KC went from first place for a month, to dead last 8 weeks later. Ouch, sorry KC fans. On the other end of the league table, New England has shot off like a rocket since week six to take the league lead.\n\nDid anyone else used to play that board game Mastermind?\n\nLook at Edson go! The man has had an up and down career, but he can put in the goals when he's on his game, evidenced by his 8 goals in 9 appearances for the LA Galaxy this season. Including his recent hat trick against San Jose, he's now tied for second in MLS history with 4 hat tricks and Edson is now sitting on a decent 61 career goals in 169 MLS appearances.

The shirt has been debated all over the US Soccer blogosphere. Bill Archer from Big Soccer calls it a Golf Shirt, many of the comments over at Goff's Soccer Insider were not excited by the design, and Soccer by Ives says it looks like a Gap commercial. However, the comments at Football Shirt Culture and Luis Arroyave from The Red Card generally like it and I have to say, my opinion has changed for the better after seeing the shirt on the field a couple of times now.\n\nI finally decided to get one for myself from soccerpro.com and I was actually pleasantly surprised when I took it out of the shipping package. The \"off-white-grey\" color is less prominent than in the pictures, making it look very clean with red pinstripes and not quite as preppy as I thought it would be. I was also impressed with how the inside collar has the Stars and Stripes and the Don't Tread On Me slogan. Good so far.\n\nI even got all excited and pulled the shirt on to pretend I'm a good soccer player in the field behind my back yard. True to my usual form, I dribbled the ball off my shins, whiffed a couple of times, and ballooned a few shots a mile over the goal and decided to call it a day. No really, I'm awful, but the good news is the shirt was comfortable and cool on a very hot and muggy day.\n\nIt turns out my initial impressions from the early internet pictures have faded and although I may be in the minority, I actually like the \"golf\" shirt. My personal style doesn't usually include the polo-shirt look, but I'll definitely be wearing this shirt out and about. As a side note, I just wish that the USSF and Nike would come up with a US shirt that featured red more prominently, even if it's the red and white striped look of the 1994 shirts.\n\nAlso, did anyone else find it annoying that the recent Argentina-USA friendly featured very closely colored shirts? I couldn't tell the teams apart very well. (I read somewhere that Argentina refused to wear their darker tops, don't know if it's true though) Maybe it was just my TV.\n\nIf you have an opinion on the USA home shirt, good or bad, feel free to share in the comments below.\n\nThis is a map showing all of the current Major League Soccer players that were born in Europe.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nThe map does not include Yura Movsisyan (Azerbaijan) and Vardan Adzemian (Armenia).\n\nThe Shortest Euro 2008 Players\n\n1.66m - Florentin Petre (Romania)\n\n1.67m - Gökdeniz Karadeniz (Turkey)\n\n1.69m - Piotr Trochowski (Germany)\n\n1.69m - Santi Cazorla (Spain)\n\nThe Tallest Euro 2008 Players\n\n2.02m - Jan Koller (Czech Republic)\n\n1.99m - Andreas Isaksson (Sweden)\n\n1.99m - Konstantinos Chalkias (Greece)\n\n1.98m - Orlando Engelaar (Netherlands)\n\n1.98m - Per Mertesacker (Germany)\n\n1.98m - Pascal Zuberbühler (Switzerland)\n\nConversion:\n\n2.02m = 6ft 7½in\n\n1.90m = 6ft 3in\n\n1.75m = 5ft 9in\n\n1.66m = 5ft 5½in\n\nTallest (1.90m or taller) and Shortest (1.75m or shorter) Players for Each Participating Nation:\n\nCzech Republic\n\n2.02m - Jan Koller (FW)\n\n1.72m - David Jarolím (MF)\n\nPortugal\n\n1.91m - Hugo Almeida (FW)\n\n1.70m - João Moutinho (MF)\n\n1.70m - Simão Sabrosa (FW)\n\nSwitzerland\n\n1.98m - Pascal Zuberbühler (GK)\n\n1.73m - Ricardo Cabanas (MF)\n\nTurkey\n\n1.95m - Volkan Demiral (GK)\n\n1.66m - Gökdeniz Karadeniz (FW)\n\nAustria\n\n1.96m - Sebastian Prödl (DF)\n\n1.75m - Christoph Leitgeb (MF)\n\nCroatia\n\n1.95m - Josip Šimunić (DF)\n\n1.95m - Mario Galinović (GK)\n\n1.72m - Danijel Pranjić (MF)\n\nGermany\n\n1.98m - Per Mertesacker (DF)\n\n1.69m - Piotr Trochowski (MF)\n\nPoland\n\n1.94m - Jacek Bąk (DF)\n\n1.94m - Artur Boruc (GK)\n\n1.75m - Rafał Murawski (MF)\n\nFrance\n\n1.92m - Patrick Vieira (MF)\n\n1.70m - Claude Makélélé (MF)\n\nItaly\n\n1.94m - Luca Toni (FW)\n\n1.70m - Antonio Di Natale (FW)\n\nNetherlands\n\n1.98m - Orlando Engelaar (MF)\n\n1.70m - Wesley Sneijder (MF)\n\nRomania\n\n1.96m - Dorin Goian (DF)\n\n1.66m - Florentin Petre (MF)\n\nGreece\n\n1.99m - Konstantinos Chalkias (GK)\n\n1.72m - Nikos Spiropoulous (DF)\n\nRussia\n\n1.93m - Oleg Ivanov (MF)\n\n1.70m - Igor Semshov (MF)\n\nSpain\n\nNONE over 1.90m\n\n1.69m - Santi Cazorla (MF)\n\nSweden\n\n1.99m - Andreas Isaksson (GK)\n\n1.75m - Freddie Ljungberg (MF)\n\nPlayers 1.90m (6ft 3in) and over by Nation:\n\nSwitzerland (8), Germany (7), Austria (6), Greece (6), Croatia (5), Czech Republic (5), Sweden (5), Italy (4), Netherlands (4), Turkey (4), Poland (3), France (2), Portugal (2), Russia (2), Romania (1), Spain (0)\n\nPlayers 1.75m (5ft 9in) and under by Nation:\n\nSpain (7), France (5), Portugal (5), Germany (4), Italy (4), Netherlands (4), Romania (4), Greece (3), Russia (3), Croatia (2), Czech Republic (2), Austria (1), Poland (1), Sweden (1)\n\nAverage Height by Nation (in cm):\n\n184.91 - Croatia\n\n184.87 - Germany\n\n184.61 - Switzerland\n\n184.48 - Greece\n\n184.43 - Austria\n\n184.17 - Sweden\n\n184.14 - Poland\n\n184.00 - Czech Republic\n\n183.30 - Netherlands\n\n183.17 - Italy\n\n182.09 - Russia\n\n181.83 - France\n\n181.43 - Romania\n\n180.57 - Portugal\n\n180.35 - Turkey\n\n179.61 - Spain\n\nMore Euro 2008 Posts:\n\nForeign-born Players on Euro 2008 squads\n\nFormer 'Team of the Tournament' Players returning to Euro 2008\n\nPremiership Players on Euro 2008 squads\n\nLa Liga Players on Euro 2008 squads\n\nSerie A Players on Euro 2008 squads\n\nBundesliga Players on Euro 2008 squads\n\nClub Breakdown of Euro 2008 squads\n\nThis map shows the birth countries for all of the African Born players currently on Major League Soccer rosters.\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nThese are all of the Caribbean players I could find that are playing in England at semi and full professional level. A good portion of these players were born in England to Caribbean parents and have eventually been called to represent their Caribbean National Teams.
