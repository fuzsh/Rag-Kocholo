        "text": "It’s been an odd career has Arjen Robben’s, spent almost exclusively in the very upper reaches of the game, yet one where he has failed to receive the plaudits that his play has deserved.\n\nIt’s particularly odd when you consider the kind of footballer that he is. Fleet footed, generally playing on the wing, darting at and beyond defenders, unleashing crosses and shots at goal and generally causing mayhem among opposition backlines wherever he has gone. When the ball is at his feet, excitement is rarely far away and yet, and yet…\n\nWhen people talk about the greats of the modern era, Robben is rarely mentioned by the cognoscenti. Sure, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are out there at the head of the pack, the gloriously eccentric Zlatan Ibrahimovic places himself in and around that company with both his extravagant performances and his gnomic pronouncements. But while Franck Ribery has forced himself into that company in the last couple of years, Robben has never quite followed him into that particularly distant part of the cosmos where the Gods are busy necking back the honeydew.\n\nIn part, perhaps it’s the look of the man. There’s something of the Albert Steptoe about him, an air that makes him resemble a pensioner on wheels, some kind of drawback in an era where the big three have a trace of the matinee idol about them. But it’s not an insurmountable challenge as Ribery’s recent elevation has illustrated, so it cannot be the only issue. His appearance is barely helped by the remarkably tight shirts that he insists on wearing, tops that appear to be sprayed on. I suspect that it’s their very tightness around the nipple – and God alone knows just how tight his garments around the gentleman’s area must be – that causes Robben to have that peculiar relationship with gravity that might well be the one issue that keeps him away from the pantheon. Such serious chafing as must occur must put intense strain upon his body which surely explains why he falls over such a lot.\n\nIt is that which makes Robben such a hard player to warm to, though let us recognise that Ronaldo is every bit as quick to make a swift acquaintance with the turf when he sees the chance. But where Ronaldo can swiftly acquire our forgiveness by doing something utterly impossible, great player that Robben is, he does not have that gift for redemption.\n\nHis petulance is always something that is peculiarly unappealing to many too, though again, he is not alone on that front. His willingness to wave the imaginary card at transgressor who have waved in his general direction is an unedifying spectacle and one that detracts from his general play.\n\nThat’s a real pity because with the ball at his feet, he is a genuine treat to watch, a player who can ignite excitement in a stadium in the blink of an eye and who can transform defence to attack in a similar twinkling. At his best, Robben is a throwback to a glorious age, one of width, of pace, of wingers with pace and trickery being the key figures in teams that are willing to take the game to the opposition.\n\nWhile Bayern Munich have carried all before them at home and abroad in the last couple of seasons, where Ribery, Neuer and Schweinsteiger have been the ones most often picked out by the media, it is Robben as much as anyone who has been at the core of their success. He is the one who can provide an outlet, he is the one that can press the opposition deeper and deeper into their half, he is the one that can spring the most steadfast of defences by the simple expedient of express pace and padlock control of the ball, an ability as old as the game itself.\n\nRobben is, without doubt, one of the most exciting sights in world football and should be lauded as such……As long as he’s on his feet.\n\nNow @awaycolours invites you to watch this in neutrality – we dare you…\n\n© Nigel Molesworth 2014\n\nRibéry playing for Bayern in 2009. Image by az1172\n\nThe recent award of the Ballon D’Or on 13th January to Cristiano Ronaldo was greeted with some acclaim, many suggesting that after all those years of Lionel Messi’s dominance, the Portuguese goalscorer deserved a look in, as if he was getting some kind of consolation prize before it was too late. None will deny Ronaldo’s incendiary brilliance but his victory suggests that placing the award in the gift of FIFA’s voting jury rather than the award panel that used to sit in judgement when it was a trophy awarded by France Football has rather skewed things. Having current players able to vote is certainly questionable – neither Ronaldo nor Messi voted for the other for example – and it seems as if we are now in the age where the individual holds sway rather than the man who, while personally brilliant, is above all a team performer.\n\nThe result did not go down that well in France. Quelle surprise you might say given that some still begrudge the merging of their flagship trophy with FIFA’s own bauble. But they have reason to be concerned about the outcome for surely, by any sane measure in this year, the finest footballer on the planet and the man who contributed most heavily to the most significant outcomes, is Franck Ribéry, the diminutive street fighter from Boulogne. Just as in years past when Messi has triumphed by inspiring Barcelona, so last season it was Ribéry who was the hub of the all conquering Bayern Munich side. World Soccer recognised his pre-eminence and that of his team by giving him the European Footballer of the Year award.\n\nAnd there we have the fault line that lies in the appreciation of the game, one that has always been there but which has been exacerbated in the age of youtube, Soccer Saturday and endless recycling of clips of the spectacular – football’s equivalent of T20 cricket, the bite sized morsel that can be thrilling but which lacks the light and shade, the subtlety of the proper thing, be it Test cricket or the full 90 minutes of a game.\n\nWhile Ribéry is more than capable of producing a special moment in any game, it is his work across 90 minutes after 90 minutes that has been so effective this last year. For all his quality on the ball, his acceleration, his sparkling technique, the man has reached his peak by being very much a team player, something that might surprise given his part in France’s great collapse at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\n\nYet it seems as if that – also a turbulent year in his personal life – was the catalyst for him to seize the greatness that was waiting for him, telling ESPN, “It’s clear I had a horrible 2010 from all points of view. I won’t even speak of the injuries that troubled me. But in my private life, my behaviour as a footballer, I went down the wrong roads, I lost myself. I hurt people, people who are very dear to me. I disappointed and even shocked many people and I want to apologise.”\n\nFrom there, he has been a player reborn, the fulcrum of a Bayern Munich side that has gradually come to dominate European football and which shows signs of doing so for a while to come yet given that the change over of power between Heynckes and Guardiola has been so comparatively seamless. Both men realised that Ribéry is vital to the way Bayern can play, his pace, his aggression crucial components in the transition of possession and in Munich’s ability to get onto the front foot quickly once they win the ball.\n\nFor not only is Ribéry talented, he’s a spiky little so and so as well, utterly secure in his belief in his ability with the ego that special players need. Put the ball at his feet and give him space to gallop into and he will immediately have the opposition on the back foot, his acceleration a frightening prospect for full-backs, as is his control. He is the kind of player that gets supporters out of their seats, the kind that persuades us to part with the folding stuff.\n\nBut he is also a winner through and through, a footballer who wants to perform at his highest level in order that the team can prevail. Not all players of his ability are quite so selfless, let’s face it.\n\nAnd now, the greatest challenge awaits, a World Cup in which France, the colossus of world football at the turn of the century and beyond, need to rehabilitate a reputation that has taken a pasting over the last few years. Scraping into the tournament via the play-offs, the French were fortunate indeed to be drawn in the Group of Indifference, alongside Switzerland, Ecuador and Honduras. Win that group and either Nigeria or Bosnia-Hercegovina will likely await, giving France chance to get some momentum going.\n\nWhat they will need above all is leadership. At 30, and as perhaps the most valuable player in world football at present, it falls upon Ribéry to offer it. The evidence of the last two years in particular is that the pint-sized winger is ready for the responsibility. The French like their generals to be on the small side after all.\n\nAnd finally some vintage Franck at Bayern and a taste of what he offers France…\n\n© Nigel Moleswoth for @awaycolours 2014\n\nFrance likes to see itself as something of a father to the modern game, and with some justification given its role in the inception of the World Cup, the European Cup and the way in which it has continued to pursue both a cosmopolitan and intellectual line on football, looking to stretch its possibilities as both sport and art.Yet in the post-war world, for decades, French football was largely a second rate operation, often failing to qualify for the World Cup and rarely performing well when they did get there, the miracle of Just Fontaine and his 13 goals in the 1958 tournament aside.\n\nIt was the late 1970s when France finally began to emerge as a true world power, the likes of Paris Saint Germain and, especially, Saint-Etienne in those evocative emerald green shirts, serving notice that something was happening in their game. A poor World Cup in 1978 was a setback, not least for a 23 year old man who went to that competition in Argentina with the hopes of the nation on his shoulders. Midfielder Michel Platini, then with AS Nancy, was already a footballer of great vision and intelligence but he had an ordinary tournament and returned home to the kind of savage criticism that might have ended the career of a lesser man.\n\nIndeed, it took him a year to shrug off that disappointment and re-emerge as the player he had always promised to be, energised by a move to Saint-Etienne. By 1982 he was the centrepiece of a French side that was the equal even of the teams that were to come in the future. With players such as Giresse, Tigana, Six, France had flair aplenty, and in Platini in the number ten shirt, they had the general that could pull it all together for them, orchestrating, dictating, changing the tempo, passing the ball with the accuracy of a mathematician and the finesse of an artist. Like all the great players, the likes of Di Stefano, Cruyff, Puskas, Platini had twice as many touches of the ball as any other man on the park, an expression both of his monumental ego and of the way in which other huge individual talents were willing to suppress their own needs in recognition of his supreme talent.\n\nIn what was a genuinely great 1982 World Cup in Spain, one that featured the magnificent Brazilians under the similarly imaginative direction of Socrates, France were the side that thrilled, coming back from an opening defeat to England to march on to the semi-finals, playing football with a verve, a modernity and a joie de vivre that captured the imagination. Platini was the auteur at the hub of it all, producer, writer, director, actor, covering all the bases with breathtaking mastery of them all.\n\nPerhaps France would have won the trophy but in the semi-final with West Germany, Battiston was all but decapitated by goalkeeper Schumacher when clean through, the goalkeeper allowed to remain on the pitch as the game edged to penalties and, in those circumstances, the inevitable West German win.\n\nAfter the World Cup, Platini moved to Juventus, where not even the straitjacket of Serie A football could contain his talents. After a stuttering start, he flowered in the city of Turin, topped the goalscoring charts in Serie A for three seasons, won a hat-trick of European Player of the Year awards, was World Soccer’s Player of the Year twice, won two titles, the European Cup, the European Cup Winners’ Cup, European Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup as the “Old Lady” came to dominate European football, largely thanks to his guile and the explosive partnership he forged with Poland’s Zbigniew Boniek.\n\nBut still there was a crowning glory to be had on the international stage, and it came when France hosted the 1984 European Championships. The injustice of 1982 burnt bright within the nation and within Platini and on home soil, their captain was not going to let the nation suffer again, understanding full well too that the greatest players end up by putting trophies on the table. He’d seen Cruyff, watched his genius, but saw too that he had never delivered a trophy for the Dutch, a void in an otherwise magnificent career. He was not going to end empty handed.\n\nWe talk of Maradona winning the 1986 World Cup single handed, but was his performance in Mexico any greater than Platini’s in France ’84? Hardly. The skipper scored the winner in the group opener with Denmark, than scored two perfect hat-tricks, an almost unthinkable achievement, as they laid waste to Belgium and Yugoslavia. The semi-final pitted them against Portugal in a cracking game won, inevitably, by scoring the dramatic winner in the last minute of extra time, and then in the final, his free-kick set France on their way to a victory over Spain. Destiny had been served.\n\nPlatini continued to touch the sky through to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, guiding his country to another semi-final and another defeat at the hands of the West Germans, before, a year later, he was gone, announcing his retirement from all football at the age of just 31, a typically Gallic gesture that would be replicated later by Eric Cantona, neither man willing to peddle their wares any longer once the kiss of genius had been withdrawn, once the ravages of time had just begun to nibble at the edges, once the drive of ambition had started to weaken, and to call them into other areas of life.\n\nPlatini took his exit from the game in the way in which he had played it. With style, with timing and with an extraordinary grace. He had adorned it while he could and refused to smear the memory of his ebullient, elemental game with a series of gradually diminishing returns. Would that we all had such self awareness.\n\n© Nigel Molesworth for @awaycolours 2014\n\nThere was something particularly affecting about the news from Portugal on January 5th, that the great Eusébio had passed. Hitherto, unless they were especially unfortunate or, in the case of George Best, wilful, the genuinely great players who have passed on to the celestial dressing room have tended to be figures from the dim and distant, those who were barely caught on black and white film never mind the coloured stuff.\n\nThe death of Eusébio, at least for those of us of a certain age, brings mortality that little bit closer to home. Although I was marginally too young to catch the great man’s career in his prime, growing up in the early ‘70s, accumulating old European Cup final programmes or inheriting Goal magazines from the ‘60s, he was everywhere, lauded as perhaps the finest European footballer of his age, no mean feat at a time when Bobby Charlton for one bestrode the continent.\n\nBut like so many who are fated to be iconic, Eusébio’s magic did not lie in his brilliance alone. Instead he was totemic, he was the first great player from Portugal – or its colony, Mozambique, to be precise – that nation’s first world star, spearheading what we would now be forced to term a golden generation. Some would categorise him as the Ronaldo of his time, but that is to do him a disservice. Ronaldo is but a descendant, playing for a team who have produced a litany of talent over the last 50 years. But when Eusébio emerged, he was the standard bearer, he was the man taking Portuguese football out to the world.\n\nHe did it first via Benfica, the club that turned its Stadium of Light into both feared venue and beacon of footballing light, the club that finally ended Real Madrid’s hegemonic hold over the European Champions’ Cup, concluding their run of five straight titles by wrestling it away from them in 1961 and 1962.\n\nEusébio did not feature in that first triumph, but he more than made up for it a year later scoring twice in an extraordinary final, Benfica emerging 5-3 winners over Real in Amsterdam, Eusébio scoring the two decisive goals inside three minutes midway through the second half.\n\nThat was to be his calling card, for over a career of more than 700 games, Eusébio averaged a goal in each give or take the width of a gnat’s embarrassment, and this in an era where defensive thinking began to advance apace, especially across Europe. Yes, Benfica were perhaps the equivalent of Celtic in their domestic league, but though he bludgeoned his goals on the domestic scene, he could export them too, scoring in the Champions’ Cup and for Portugal.\n\nIt was the 1966 World Cup that established his reputation for perpetuity, scoring nine times as Portugal reached the semi-final stage. That game had been due to take place at Goodison Park, but a little behind the scenes politicking ensured that because their opponents were the hosts, England, the game would go on at Wembley Stadium instead, a huge advantage to Alf Ramsey’s team.\n\nIn its way, that game was the 1966 version of the recent play-off between Portugal and Sweden, a game that boiled down to Ronaldo versus Ibrahimovic. Back then, it was Eusébio against Bobby Charlton and, on the night, Bobby was boisterously magnificent where Eusebio was shackled, almost literally, by the rumbustious urchin that was Norbert Stiles, chipping, clipping, digging away at the visiting giant. It was enough to separate the teams, 2-1, Charlton and Eusebio sharing the goals. Eusébio left his indelible mark on the competition by top scoring with nine goals but as a genuine team man, it was the real prize that he coveted.\n\nAn ambassador for both game and country after his playing days were over, he was an unlikely hero in many ways. Although he had all the physical attributes of a sporting god, there was a humility to his demeanour that is all too rare in such stars, people who, almost by definition, have to surf the tsunami of waves created by their egos if they are to go out and defy logic in the way that they do. Eusébio, at his heart, was a sportsman, with all the positive connotations that should bring with it.\n\n© Nigel Molesworth for @awaycolours 2014\n\nRIP Eusébio\n\nThe game of football, like the world it reflects, seems to get quicker by the year. At times there is beauty in this helter skelter pace, within the quicksilver feet of Silva or Bale for instance, but more often than not, it is hurry for scurry’s sake, blind speed masking blind panic. Yet more haste, more speed, is the cry from coaches everywhere as we chase ourselves into oblivion.\n\nIn such an environment, it takes a brave man to cast off the running spikes and don a pair of comfortable loafers instead. It demands not only a moral courage but an intellectual capacity that far outstrips the run of the mill sprint slave. To drift through modern games at rarely above walking pace, yet to invariably be the key figure on the field, requires an intelligence so sharp, so acute, you could reassemble a peeled apple with it.\n\nSuch a man is arguably the best footballer on earth, and has been since around 2006 when he became one of those rare souls to play in a World Cup winning side. And yet Andrea Pirlo, for it is he of whom we speak, has never come close to winning the Ballon d’Or, nor any of those other baubles that are thrown in the direction of Messi and, perhaps this year, Ronaldo or Ribery. I suppose it’s inevitable really, for we are in an era where only the bright and shiny things catch the eye and the camera while subtlety, depth, substance, they are left to live in the shadows, minority interests in this world of the mass and the easy and the mainstream.\n\nPirlo is a throwback to a different game, one where it was not all about pace and power, a time before we were in thrall to the sports scientists, a time when we trusted the evidence of our own eyes and came to our own conclusions as to who could play and who could not, rather than being told by a computer printout. He comes from a time when football was still lauded as an art form, before the paranoid and the self obsessed began trying to constrict it to mere science. Here is a player that can touch the soul and enliven the mind, not one that can be reduced to the algorithms of a computer game. Little wonder the modern game would render him extinct.\n\nFor a footballer of intelligence, what can we do with such a beast? Dear God, the man might want to express himself, be more than a mere automaton, might actually choose to do his own thinking in the midst of a game. We can’t have that. And so football looks to breed squadrons of mechanical men who will do as they are told, buckle to the system and serve the star, the pyrotechnical Ronaldo or Ibrahimovic who can do the impossible. In essence, they look to turn football, 11 versus 11, into a boxing match, one versus one, where the other ten on each side are redundant entities, athletes charging hither and thither, crunching into tackles, recovering, overlapping, shuttling one another into blind alleys, simply cancelling each other out.\n\nThat is the joy of a Pirlo, an orchestrator, a conductor. With him in the team, you are not looking to a lead violinist to garner the killer reviews on his own. Pirlo introduces piano, percussion, wind instruments, the full panoply of strings, voices too. With Pirlo on the rostrum, everyone is involved, everyone is valued, everyone can potentially be the difference, everyone is brought to the party and given greater significance. It is about the group, not the individual.\n\nLook at the evidence of 2011/12 should you require convincing. After Milan made the catastrophic misjudgement that Pirlo was past his best and allowed him to leave for Juventus, he responded with perhaps his greatest campaign, piloting Juve to an invincible, title winning season in Serie A before heading off to the European Championships where he dragged an otherwise insipid Italian outfit to the brink of the title.\n\nOn the way, they defeated England by a thousand cuts and by penalties. Were England unlucky? No. They were beaten by a side with better technique, for while penalties are a test of nerve at that stage, they are also a true test of quality, something that Pirlo proved emphatically. With his team trailing, at a point where they dare not miss another penalty, he scored with a slow motion chip aimed directly at where the goalkeeper was standing. In that instant, that moment of innovation and guile, he shifted the momentum irrevocably Italy’s way such that Young and Cole looked beaten men as they approached the penalty area. Though Italy were behind, as soon as Pirlo’s kick trickled over the line, the game was won.\n\nDanny Blanchflower, one of the game’s great intellectuals, explained his own style of play as an expression of his ego, that he wanted more touches of the football than anyone else because he believed that he would do more with it than anyone else, though he was aware that footballers such as Cliff Jones might be more technically gifted. But Blanchflower had gifts that the quicksilver Jones did not. He had a footballing imagination that dwarfed his contemporaries. He could envision passing moves, he could visualise ways in which defenders might be moved out of position, how opposing formations could be bent out of shape. Blanchflower couldn’t run, he couldn’t head it and he really only had the one good foot. But he was the pulse of the Tottenham side that did the first double of the 20th century, he was its heartbeat and its brain.\n\nIt is the same with Pirlo. He plays much of his football on a sliver of turf, far more concentrated than the acres that the rampaging modern athlete is expected to cover. But he can achieve more to change the conversation within a game of football with a simple sidestep or a 180 degree turn than an army of middle distance runners can do over the course of a season.\n\nPirlo is no less than a footballing treasure, a player of colossal influence. He is Tolstoy to Ronaldo’s Dan Brown, the kind of player in whom we can see, understand and respond to all that the game should be. He has consumed and assumed the football of the Gods, he is the summation of a line that runs through Ockwirk, Hidegkuti, Di Stefano, Netzer, Giles, Zidane.\n\nThe likelihood is that Brazil 2014 will be Andrea Pirlo’s swansong. Record every minute of it on whatever device you’ve got. The chances are we will not see the like of him again. Football doesn’t want us to.\n\nAway Colours now invites you to sit back and watch the following:\n\nArticle © Nigel Molesworth for @awaycolours 2014\n\nFootball is a pretty simple game. That’s what the coaches tell you, what Academies try to drill into kids. You get the ball, you pass it to a member of your team, you try to score goals at one end, keep them out at the other. The basic principles haven’t changed, but all along the way, there have been subtle refinements, changes in laws, in methodology, in preparation, in equipment. Formations have evolved, rarely quickly, but incrementally.\n\nThere have been “eureka” moments, such as the advent of the magnificent Hungarians of the early ‘50s; Brazil later in the decade; the catenaccio system in Italy; Cruyff and Total Football. And then – came Franz Beckenbauer and the revolutionising of “the sweeper system.”\n\nThere can be no doubt that Beckenbauer, known as “the Kaiser” (Emperor) , is one of the key figures in post-war football, as player; coach and administrator. He was the central character in the rise of Bayern Munich from a team that wasn’t deemed worthy of a place in the original Bundesliga , to the side that bestrode Europe little more than a decade later. And he was the man who drove the West German machine to extraordinary heights in the first half of the 1970s after they had been languishing in the international backwaters ever since the Miracle of Bern and the 1954 win.\n\nBeckenbauer had perhaps the finest footballing brain of his generation, a player who didn’t dazzle in the way of a Best or a Cruyff, but someone who thought his way through a game, who was reading it like a chess Grandmaster, four, five, six moves ahead of the rest of the field, ghosting into positions to mop attacks up in his role as a central defender, then somehow able to steer a path out from the back, through the midfield minefield through spaces that simply opened up in front of him, spaces that were never there for other footballers.\n\nThe wonder of Beckenbauer’s football though was that it largely happened from a central defensive role, and yet he was an extraordinarily dangerous attacking weapon, in a way that the game had never seen before. It was almost as if the deep lying centre-forward role pioneered by Hungary had reached its ultimate logical conclusion, playing so deep that he was in defence.\n\nIf you think about it, there’s perfect sense in what seems like madness. After all, what team is going to go and mark the opposition’s centre half? The whole point of being a striker is to avoid going anywhere near him, which in turn means that if the sweeper can get on the ball, he will have time with it. In most cases, that’s broadly irrelevant given that distribution is not always the greatest asset of your typical central defender.\n\nBut Beckenbauer was not a typical central defender, having made his name initially in the midfield. He didn’t have electric pace or the supreme dribbling skills of George Best, but he would glide across the turf, timing late runs into the box to perfection to score his share of goals, just as he did in that famous World Cup quarter-final of 1970, when a beaten West Germany at 2-0 down, suddenly found themselves back in the game through his late strike – they went on to win 3-2 in extra time and dump the holders, England, out of the competition.\n\nHis poise, the quality of his passing and his reading of the game made him a natural sweeper, a position from which he simply dictated games, time and again finding the right run or the right pass at the right moment, spring defence into attack and setting both Bayern and West Germany off on another raid on goal. Simply, he invented, refined, perfected the modern sweeper system and he still remains its finest ever exponent.\n\nThe honours he collected in his career as a player testify to his greatness. He won both the World Cup and European Championship with West Germany and was also a beaten finalist in both. He collected three European Cups with Bayern, the World Club title, the Cup Winners’ Cup, four Bundesliga titles, and four German cups, as well as being the European Footballer of the Year in 1972 and 1976.\n\nAfter playing for the star studded New York Cosmos, he hung up his boots and was quickly installed as the national team coach. Saddled with a West German side in transition, he took them all the way to the 1986 World Cup Final where, amid stultifying humidity, Diego Maradona was simply too good for the German side.\n\nFour years later, Beckenbauer and Germany were better prepared, tactically shrewd, organised to perfection with another all-time great, Lothar Matthäus, providing the driving force on the field. This time, their final meeting with Argentina went Beckenbauer’s way, as he became the first man to Captain and coach a World Cup winning side. Further spells as coach at Bayern saw him collect a Bundesliga title and the UEFA Cup, and subsequently, his skills as an administrator have been used by both club and country, most notably as head of the organising committee of the 2006 World Cup.\n\nBut the images of Beckenbauer that will persist are of him collecting trophy after trophy in the 1970s and, above all, of him collecting the ball outside his own penalty area and then either bringing it forward himself or spraying an extraordinary into the path of a colleague to open up the opposition, finding angles that even Pythagoras would have struggled with. What a player.\n\n© Nigel Molesworth 2013 for @AwayColours\n\nPhotos reproduced courtesy of the Bundesarchiv under the Creative Commons 3.0 Licence"
