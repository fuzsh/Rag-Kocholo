World Cup in 1966: West Germany, Argentina, Brazil and England were all conident it would be their turn to lift the Jules Rimet trophy. Despite being blighted by the barbaric treatment of Pelé and some controversial refereeing, the tournament was enlightened by the giant-slaying North Korea, the brilliance of Eusébio and a nail-biting, but triumphant, inal for the host nation. The 1966 World Cup also saw goals that would become legendary, including the lung-bursting run from West Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer, an outside-of-the-foot free kick from Brazil’s Garrincha and Geoff Hurst’s monumental hat-trick in the inal – the irst ever in a World Cup inal.\n\nGEOFF HURST – England vs West Germany\n\n6\n\n10 England’s Geoff Hurst scores that famous fourth goal to put England 4–2 up against West Germany after extra time, 30 July 1966.\n\n1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.\n\n5\n\nPass (chipped, cross) Schulz Ball recovery Moore Pass Moore Pass Hunt Pass (chipped, long ball) Moore Goal Hurst\n\n1 5\n\n21 4\n\n3\n\n6\n\n2\n\n6\n\nKEY Ball movement Shot Player with ball Player without ball\n\n8\n\n1966 World Cup Goals LUIS ARTIME – Argentina vs Spain\n\n7\n\nFRANZ BECKENBAUER – West Germany vs Switzerland 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\n\n6\n\n19\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nInterception Más Pass Más Pass Solari Pass Rattín Pass Onega Pass Solari Goal Artime 11\n\nGoal kick Tilkowski Pass Schnellinger Keeper pick-up Tilkowski Keeper throw Tilkowski Pass (chipped, long ball) Höttges 6.

Although referee clampdowns and new rules to protect players from reckless challenges have increased the tally, statistics reveal a large number of indiscretions are due to rash decisions and second offences. It appears that as the game gets quicker, and more skilful, tackling becomes a much riskier business. So, hats off to Ryan Giggs. He managed 632 Premier League appearances without seeing red once.\n\nCHELSEA 1536\n\nEVERTON 1465\n\nARSENAL 1417\n\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 1397\n\nASTON VILLA 1362\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED 1336\n\nWEST HAM UNITED 1321\n\nLIVERPOOL 1220\n\nNEWCASTLE UNITED 1220\n\nMANCHESTER CITY 1158\n\nBLACKBURN ROVERS 1111\n\nSUNDERLAND 1095\n\nSOUTHAMPTON 996\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH 973\n\nBOLTON WANDERERS 845\n\nLEEDS UNITED 790\n\nFULHAM 708\n\nWEST BROMWICH ALBION 645\n\nLEICESTER CITY 619\n\nSTOKE CITY 617\n\nDERBY COUNTY 538\n\nWIGAN ATHLETIC 513\n\nCOVENTRY CITY 481\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE 477\n\nBIRMINGHAM CITY 428\n\nCHARLTON ATHLETIC 408\n\nWIMBLEDON 407\n\nPORTSMOUTH 398\n\nNORWICH CITY 394\n\nQUEENS PARK RANGERS 364\n\nSHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 341\n\nHULL CITY 328\n\nSWANSEA CITY 318\n\nNOTTINGHAM FOREST 287\n\nWATFORD 272\n\nWOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS 255\n\nBURNLEY 186\n\nIPSWICH TOWN 183\n\nSHEFFIELD UNITED 170\n\nREADING 142\n\nBRADFORD CITY 113\n\nBOURNEMOUTH 105\n\nOLDHAM ATHLETIC 70\n\nBARNSLEY 66\n\nCARDIFF CITY 50\n\nBLACKPOOL 47\n\nSWINDON TOWN 39\n\n10\n\nPremier League Fouls and Cards\n\nEVERTON 86\n\nARSENAL 84\n\nNEWCASTLE UNITED 78\n\nBLACKBURN ROVERS 76\n\nCHELSEA 74\n\nWEST HAM UNITED 68\n\nMANCHESTER CITY 62\n\nSUNDERLAND 61\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED 60\n\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 59\n\nASTON VILLA 56\n\nLIVERPOOL 54\n\nSOUTHAMPTON 49\n\nMIDDLESBROUGH 45\n\nBOLTON WANDERERS 43\n\nFULHAM 36\n\nLEICESTER CITY 36\n\nSTOKE CITY 30\n\nWEST BROMWICH ALBION 30\n\nLEEDS UNITED 28\n\nWIGAN ATHLETIC 27\n\nWIMBLEDON 26\n\nQUEENS PARK RANGERS 26\n\nBIRMINGHAM CITY 26\n\nCOVENTRY CITY 24\n\nCHARLTON ATHLETIC 24\n\nHULL CITY 24\n\nPORTSMOUTH 20\n\nSHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 19\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE 18\n\nDERBY COUNTY 17\n\nNORWICH CITY 15\n\nWATFORD 14\n\nSWANSEA CITY 13\n\nWOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS 11\n\nNOTTINGHAM FOREST 10\n\nSHEFFIELD UNITED 9\n\nREADING 9\n\nIPSWICH TOWN 6\n\nBURNLEY 6\n\nBOURNEMOUTH 4\n\nOLDHAM ATHLETIC 4\n\nBARNSLEY 4\n\nBRADFORD CITY 2\n\nBLACKPOOL 2\n\nCARDIFF CITY 1\n\nSWINDON TOWN 1\n\nTotal Fouls since 2003 EVERTON 6679 ASTON VILLA 6576 MANCHESTER CITY 6536 CHELSEA 6274 MANCHESTER UNITED 6270 TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 6259 LIVERPOOL 6151 ARSENAL 5988 NEWCASTLE UNITED 5771 WEST HAM UNITED 5292\n\nFULHAM 5233 SUNDERLAND 5105 BLACKBURN ROVERS 5044 BOLTON WANDERERS 4871 WEST BROMWICH ALBION 4521 STOKE CITY 4222 WIGAN ATHLETIC 4042 PORTSMOUTH 3728 MIDDLESBROUGH 3648 SOUTHAMPTON 3214\n\nBIRMINGHAM CITY 3085 CRYSTAL PALACE 2440 HULL CITY 2398 SWANSEA CITY 2295 NORWICH CITY 2254 CHARLTON ATHLETIC 2013 WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS 1901 LEICESTER CITY 1883 WATFORD 1573 READING 1341\n\nBURNLEY 1296 QUEENS PARK RANGERS 1262 BOURNEMOUTH 729 LEEDS UNITED 583 DERBY COUNTY 548 SHEFFIELD UNITED 510 BLACKPOOL 440 CARDIFF CITY 345\n\nSource: Opta (May 2017)\n\n11\n\nAFRICA CUP OF NATIONS TROPHIES AND GOALS What began in 1957 with a three-team competition has developed 31 tournaments later into a monthlong, 16-team extravaganza.

What has proved critical over the years is not just how those players perform, but where. Formation is a key tactical element and, as these diagrams show, it is continually evolving. We can see the attack-heavy teams that dominated the early years of the game gradually becoming more balanced, with stronger midields and defence.\n\n1872\n\n1889\n\n1930\n\n1-2-7 Formation\n\nThe Pyramid (2-3-5)\n\nThe WM Formation\n\nEngland\n\nPreston North End\n\nArsenal\n\n“ [Going behind] didn’t bother us at all...

Here was a system that focused on passing and tackling in the central zones of the pitch and enabled increasingly it midielders to bolster both attacks and defences. It seemed the evolution had reached its conclusion. However, the search for any slight advantage meant coaches kept on tinkering. “Wingless wonder” teams and luid “total football” line-ups were followed by wing-backs, “false 9s”, pyramids and Christmas trees. Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto Parreira once predicted 4-6-0 as the “formation of the future” – and some might claim we are edging ever closer to that prophesy.\n\nThe pace and attacking skills of Tottenham Hotspur and England’s Kyle Walker (on left) were integral to the success of the club’s wing-back formation in 2017.\n\n2014\n\n2017\n\n4-5-1 Formation\n\n3-4-1-2 Formation\n\nChelsea\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n“ When you have full-backs like ours, Danny Rose or Kyle Walker, they can play forward as offensive players. We tried to put them in a better position to try and play more like wing-backs. That was our idea, and then to play with two strikers. ” Mauricio Pochettino, manager Tottenham Hotspur 27\n\nLA LIGA TITLE WINNERS La Liga, the elite league of Spanish football, was born in 1929 from a core group of teams playing for the national knockout competition, the Copa del Rey. Sixty different teams have since competed in the league and nine different teams have lifted the trophy. The league has been dominated by Barcelona and Real Madrid, the giants of Spanish football, while Athletic Bilbao, Atlético Madrid and Valencia deserve honourable mentions too.

Rated as one of the most entertaining and thrilling leagues in the world, Serie A has a reputation for highly tactical performances and players with virtuoso and prodigious technical ability. However, the league has also been rocked by controversy and scandal, including the 2006 Calciopoli, as it became known, where some top teams were accused of rigging games by selecting biased referees. The winner of the league is awarded the Scudetto, a badge with the colours of the Italian lag, to be worn on the champions’ shirts the following season.\n\n31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\n1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973\n\n0\n\n32\n\nSerie A Title Winners Key (from top) JUVENTUS 31 INTERNAZIONALE MILANO 16 AC MILAN 15 BOLOGNA FC 5 TORINO FC 5 AS ROMA 3\n\nACF FIORENTINA 2 SS LAZIO 2 SSC NAPOLI 2 CAGLIARI CALCIO 1 UC SAMPDORIA 1 HELLAS VERONA FC 1 Source: Opta (May 2017)\n\nJUVENTUS 31\n\nINTERNAZIONALE MILANO 16 AC MILAN 15\n\nBOLOGNA FC, TORINO FC 5 AS ROMA 3 ACF FIORENTINA, SS LAZIO, SSC NAPOLI 2\n\n1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\nUC SAMPDORIA, HELLAS VERONA, CAGLIARI 1\n\n33\n\nEUROPEAN CUP & CHAMPIONS LEAGUE RECORD GOALSCORERS Real Madrid strikers have dominated the table of goalscorers in the Champions League and its forerunner, the European Cup.

Since then, the women’s game and the competition have grown beyond recognition with eight four-yearly tournaments. In Canada, in 2015, the qualifying rounds saw 134 nations compete for 24 places; 26.7 million TV viewers made the inal the most-watched soccer game in American history and the victorious US team won $2 million in prize money.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nNORWAY\n\n1, 22, 86 3, 33, 112 SWEDEN GERMANY\n\n18, 59\n\n2, 26, 111 48\n\nBRAZIL\n\n18, 59\n\nWomen’s World Cup Trophies and Goals Source: Opta (October 2015)\n\nCAMEROON\n\n2, 9\n\nFRANCE\n\n6, 22 SWITZERLAND\n\n1, 11\n\nPR CHINA\n\n15, 52 AUSTRALIA\n\nGHANA\n\n5, 29\n\n1, 6 KOREA REPUBLIC\n\nJAPAN\n\nRUSSIA\n\n1, 13, 36\n\n4, 16\n\n1, 5 COLOMBIA\n\n1, 4 DENMARK\n\nTHAILAND\n\n3, 19\n\n1, 3\n\nENGLAND\n\n10, 30\n\nNETHERLANDS\n\n1, 3\n\nNIGERIA\n\n3, 18 CHINESE TAIPEI\n\n1, 2\n\nDPR KOREA\n\n3, 12\n\nCANADA\n\n6, 30 ITALY\n\n3, 11\n\n1 1 1\n\nTOURNAMENTS WON MATCHES WON GOALS SCORED 49\n\n1978 WORLD CUP GOALS The “Tickertape Tournament” in 1978 was a bittersweet affair. It was set against an unsavoury political background, boycotted by Johan Cruyff (rated as the world’s best player at the time) and disgraced by Scotland’s Willie Johnston, who was sent home after a positive drug test. However, the tournament also gave us some unforgettable goals, including a magical inish by Scotland’s Archie Gemmill, screamers from the Netherland’s Arie Haan and Brazil’s Nelinho, and a much-needed morale-boosting triumph for the host nation, Argentina, when they defeated the Netherlands 3–1, thanks to the tournament’s top scorer, Mario Kempes, and his second goal of the day.\n\nARIE HAAN – Netherlands vs West Germany\n\n1 1\n\n7\n\n10 5 6\n\n9\n\n11\n\n4\n\n9 3\n\n22\n\nArie Haan’s goal against West Germany (18 June 1978) helped the Dutch national team reach the 1978 World Cup inal, where they were beaten by Argentina 3–1 in extra time.\n\n2\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\n\nGoal kick (long ball) Maier Head pass Brandts Ball recovery Haan Pass Haan Pass Willy van de Kerkhof Pass René van de Kerkhof Goal Haan\n\nKEY Ball movement Shot Player with ball Player without ball\n\n50\n\n1978 World Cup Goals ARCHIE GEMMILL – Scotland vs Netherlands\n\n9\n\n5 8 15\n\n3\n\nLEOPOLDO LUQUE – Argentina vs France 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\n\nFree kick taken Rioch Pass Kennedy Take on Dalglish Take on Gemmill Tackle Krol Good skill Gemmill Challenge Krol Take on Gemmill Goal Gemmill\n\nGoal kick Fillol Pass Olguín Pass Ardiles Pass Gallego Pass Kempes Pass Ardiles Goal Luque\n\n4 8\n\n7 6\n\n7\n\n15\n\n14 15\n\n55 6\n\n2 2 5\n\n1\n\n6\n\n13 10\n\n4\n\n6\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\n15\n\n5\n\nNELINHO – Brazil vs Italy\n\n1\n\nKARL-HEINZ RUMMENIGGE – West Germany vs Mexico 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\n\n1\n\nGoal kick (long ball) Zoff Interception Cerezo Ball recovery Mendonça Pass Mendonça Pass Cerezo Pass Dinamite Goal Nelinho\n\n5 7 8\n\n7\n\n11\n\n20\n\n6\n\n1.

It was never used again. The tournament became the battleground for two of the greatest matches ever played in World Cup history. Italy’s Paolo Rossi hit a hat-trick in an amazing 3–2 defeat of Brazil and, after a 3–3 draw, West Germany overcame France in the irst ever World Cup penalty shoot-out. Memorable goals included an overhead bicycle kick by Germany’s Klaus Fischer, a sublime chip from Brazil’s Éder and a strike from his compatriot, Sócrates, which proved completely unstoppable. However, it was Tardelli’s goal (and his celebration) against West Germany in the inal that we all remember the most.\n\nMARCO TARDELLI – Italy vs West Germany\n\n7 7\n\n5 4\n\n3\n\n3 6\n\n14 2\n\n20\n\n1\n\n16 Italy’s Marco Tardelli celebrates scoring his goal against West Germany during the 1982 World Cup inal.

For every exquisite shot curled in from the edge of the penalty area, there is a ricochet off the shin from two yards. For every perfectly timed scissor-kick, there is a vicious and ugly toe-punt just to make sure the ball goes in. When it comes down to the wire in a World Cup match, any goal will do.\n\n886 RIGHT-FOOT GOALS\n\nSource: Opta (October 2015)\n\n486 56\n\nLEFT-FOOT GOALS\n\nWorld Cup Goals by Body Part\n\n300\n\nHEADED GOALS\n\n10\n\n30\n\nOWN GOALS\n\nOTHER GOALS\n\nThe most notorious scoring body part belongs to Maradona’s “Hand of God” against England in 1986. Also worthy of a mention are Clint Dempsey’s “Groin Goal” for the USA against Portugal in 2014 and the great Jairzinho “chesting” the ball in to score Brazil’s second goal in the 1970 inal.\n\nOf the 1712 goals scored in the World Cup only 30 have been own goals – less than two per cent. Perhaps the strangest own goal ever scored, so far, belongs to Greece’s Vasilis Torosidis during the World Cup qualifying game against Romania in 2014, whose intended leftfoot clearance from inside the penalty box ended up being ished out from the back of his own net. 57\n\nSERIE A GOALS\n\n4095\n\n4565\n\n4881 4769\n\nGoals are said to be hard to come by in an often defensively minded Serie A, but if you are good enough… It certainly wasn’t a problem for 1930s star Silvio Piola, whose record of 274 goals in 537 games – set with Novarro, Lazio, Juventus and others – looks unassailable. Even the great Francesco Totti had eventually to concede that the target was out of sight.

The five-time Italian footballer of the year, European Golden Boot holder (2007) and World Cup winner (2006) scored his first goal for the Giallorossi on the opening day of the 1994–95 season. His 250th and final league goal came in September 2016 at the age of 40. His loyalty to Roma has meant he has never achieved Champions League success, but there is no doubt of his status in the game. When Roma met Barcelona in a pre-season friendly, Lionel Messi uploaded a shot of him in Totti’s shirt with the caption: “A great! What a phenomenon!!” It got 1.8 million likes.\n\n59\n\nGAMES TO REACH 100 GOALS It’s true that you need more than star power in order to score goals consistently. You need a little luck, talented teammates and a crumbling opposition too. But when it comes to scoring a century (and more) for their club, the Premier League players below have shown they’ve got what it takes to become truly magical and, as a result, have joined an elite squad of top-scoring centurions. For all strikers, this is the benchmark worth getting out of bed for.\n\nSERGIO AGÜERO 147 Games\n\nTHIERRY HENRY 160 Games\n\n100th Goal: 30-12-95 Blackburn Rovers vs Tottenham Hotspur 41st min\n\n100th Goal: 19-04-16 Manchester City vs Newcastle United 14th min\n\n100th Goal: 10-02-04 Arsenal vs Southampton 31st min\n\nROBBIE FOWLER 175 Games\n\nLES FERDINAND 178 Games\n\nMICHAEL OWEN 185 Games\n\n100th Goal: 16-01-99 Liverpool vs Southampton 37th min\n\n100th Goal: 11-05-97 Newcastle United vs Nottingham Forest 23rd min\n\nALAN SHEARER 124 Games\n\nROBIN VAN PERSIE 197 Games\n\n100th Goal: 02-09-12 Manchester United vs Southampton 90th min\n\n60\n\nJIMMY FLOYD HASSELBAINK 200 Games\n\n100th Goal: 27-03-04 Chelsea vs Wolverhampton Wanderers 77th min\n\n100th Goal: 26-04-03 Liverpool vs West Bromwich Albion 49th min\n\nDIDIER DROGBA 220 Games\n\n100th Goal: 10-03-12 Chelsea vs Stoke City 68th min\n\nSource: Opta (May 2017) The players’ colours below represents the team colour for which the player scored their 100th goal.\n\nIAN WRIGHT 173 Games\n\n100th Goal: 13-09-97 Arsenal vs Bolton Wanderers 81st min\n\nANDREW COLE 185 Games\n\n100th Goal: 17-02-99 Manchester United vs Arsenal 60th min\n\nDARREN BENT 226 Games\n\n100th Goal: 01-02-12 Aston Villa vs QPR 45th min\n\nGames to Reach 100 Goals WAYNE ROONEY 247 Games\n\n100th Goal: 31-01-10 Manchester United vs Arsenal 37th min\n\nTEDDY SHERINGHAM 254 Games\n\n100th Goal: 28-10-00 Manchester United vs Southampton 51st min\n\nDION DUBLIN 271 Games\n\n100th Goal: 23-11-02 Aston Villa vs West Ham United 71st min\n\nPETER CROUCH 419 Games\n\n100th Goal: 01-02-17 Stoke City vs Everton 7th min\n\nDWIGHT YORKE 254 Games\n\n100th Goal: 25-11-00 Manchester United vs Derby County 76th min\n\nROBBIE KEANE 255 Games\n\n100th Goal: 26-12-07 Tottenham Hotspur vs Fulham 62nd min\n\nJERMAIN DEFOE 303 Games\n\n100th Goal: 23-04-11 Tottenham Hotspur vs West Bromwich Albion 66th min\n\nPAUL SCHOLES 436 Games\n\n100th Goal: 06-03-10 Manchester United vs Wolverhampton Wanderers, 72nd min\n\nAlan Shearer’s record may never be beaten, but he is not the record holder for English top-flight football.

First played in the 1871–72 season, the English FA Cup is the oldest football competition in the world. Open to the top 10 levels of English football, the tournament includes hundreds of non-league teams (in 1901, Tottenham Hotspur became the only non-league team ever to win the trophy). Since 1923, the inal has been played at Wembley (old and new) apart from the period between 2001 and 2006, when it was hosted at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

The 25-year-old’s goals against England and Belgium were described by many pundits, players and fans alike as “pure genius”. In the now famous quarter-final match against England, Maradona’s unforgettable “Hand of God” goal was (almost) forgotten when he scored his “Goal of the Century” just four minutes later. His achievements would dwarf the World Cup’s other magical moments, which included six goals from England’s Gary Lineker (the tournament’s top scorer), a screamer from Brazil’s Josimar and an ambitious scissor-kick from the Mexican player Manuel Negrete.\n\nDIEGO MARADONA – Argentina vs England\n\n13\n\n10 10 12 1 11\n\n14\n\nDiego Maradona dribbles the ball beyond England goalkeeper Peter Shilton to score the “Goal of the Century”.

The format of this much-revered event has historically led to a select and elite group of nations reaching the inals, so this data is not distorted by easy wins and goal feasts.

Donovan has won the MLS Cup a record six times – twice with the Earthquakes and a further four times with the Galaxy.\n\n903\n\nMLS GOALS PER CLUB\n\nMLS Goals Per Club JEFF CUNNINGHAM\n\nLANDON DONOVAN\n\nCHRIS WONDOLOWKSI\n\nJAIME MORENO\n\n145\n\n134\n\nANTE RAZOV\n\n133\n\nJASON KREIS\n\nDWAYNE DE ROSARIO\n\n114\n\nTAYLOR TWELLMAN\n\n108\n\n104\n\nKEI KAMARA\n\nEDSON BUDDLE\n\n100\n\nROY LASSITER\n\n89\n\nBRIAN CHING\n\nBRIAN MCBRIDE\n\n82\n\n80\n\nSTEVE RALSTON\n\nKENNY COOPER\n\n79\n\n76\n\nÁLVARO SABORÍO\n\nRONALD CERRITOS\n\n72\n\nEDDIE JOHNSON\n\nMIKE MAGEE\n\n70\n\n71 CHRIS ROLFE\n\nDOMINIC ODURO\n\n64\n\n63\n\n61\n\nCHAD BARRETT\n\n59\n\n61\n\n57\n\nWILL BRUIN\n\n57\n\n57 DANTE WASHINGTON\n\nPAUL BRAVO\n\n52\n\n52 THIERRY HENRY\n\nFREDY MONTERO\n\n51\n\n51 GIOVANNI SAVARESE\n\n51\n\nJAVIER MORALES\n\n51\n\nDAVY ARNAUD\n\n50\n\n51\n\n50\n\n101 ORLANDO CITY SC\n\nNEW YORK CITY FC\n\n111\n\n205 MIAMI FUSION\n\n296 PORTLAND TIMBERS\n\nVANCOUVER WHITECAPS\n\n305 PHILADELPHIA UNION\n\n324\n\n348 MONTREAL IMPACT\n\nTAMPA BAY MUTINY\n\n357\n\n401 TORONTO FC\n\nCHIVAS USA\n\n407 SEATTLE SOUNDERS FC\n\n257\n\n503 HOUSTON DYNAMO\n\n52\n\nEDDIE GAVEN\n\n51 WOLDE HARRIS\n\n53\n\nALAN GORDON\n\n52 CHRIS HENDERSON\n\n58\n\nDOM DWYER\n\nDIEGO SERNA\n\nALEJANDRO MORENO\n\n63\n\nSÉBASTIEN LE TOUX\n\nCLINT MATHIS\n\nBRAD DAVIS\n\n70\n\nCLINT DEMPSEY\n\n64 MARK CHUNG\n\n71\n\nCOBI JONES\n\n71 FABIÁN ESPÍNDOLA\n\n75\n\nJUAN PABLO ÁNGEL\n\n73\n\n74 CONOR CASEY\n\n80\n\n82\n\nPREDRAG RADOSAVLJEVIĆ\n\nBRADLEY WRIGHT-PHILLIPS\n\n88\n\nRAÚL DÍAZ ARCE\n\n83 JOSH WOLFF\n\n101\n\nCARLOS RUIZ\n\n89\n\nROBBIE KEANE\n\n126\n\n87\n\nRONALDO VS MESSI Future generations might well consider us blessed to have seen the two greatest players in the history of the game. Between them they have been named as FIFA’s best two players in the world every year since 2008 (except 2010 when Iniesta was runner-up to Messi). Both players have scored in two UEFA Champions League inals, have regularly scored more than 50 goals in a single season, and struck their 500th goals for their club in 2017. But who wouldn’t doubt the Argentinian would trade a fair few of them to match the European Championship winner’s medal, won by Ronaldo in 2016?\n\nCRISTIANO RONALDO Club Record\n\nIMAGE OF RONALDO\n\nMatches won\n\n469\n\nGoals scored\n\n529\n\nGames played\n\n717 0\n\n800\n\nInternational Record Matches won\n\n84\n\nGoals scored\n\n75\n\nGames played\n\n142 0\n\n800\n\nLeague Championships National Cups National League Cups Comm Shield/Super Cup\n\n“ Messi is outstanding in certain attributes but Ronaldo is such an all-round player.”\n\nChampions League UEFA Super Cup Club World Cup\n\nEngland international Michael Owen\n\nEuropean Championship Total 88\n\n21\n\nRonaldo Vs Messi\n\n“ Messi or Ronaldo best player in the world?

Played in nine cities across the US, this World Cup saw Italy lose 3–2 to Brazil in a penalty shoot-out – the irst ever World Cup inal to be decided by penalties. Roberto Baggio’s wild penalty miss will long be remembered. The lick, spin and volley by Germany’s Jürgen Klinsmann, the 65-yard run to score by Saudi Arabia’s Saeed Al-Owairan and the diving header by Bulgaria’s Yordan Letchkov were all wonderful goals, but it’s Hagi’s strike against Colombia that we’ll never forget...\n\nGHEORGHE HAGI – Romania vs Colombia\n\n7\n\n10 1 3\n\n9\n\n6\n\n6\n\n19 2\n\n4\n\n7\n\n5\n\n2\n\n2\n\nRomania’s Gheorghe Hagi celebrates after scoring his unforgettable leftfoot lob over the top of Colombian keeper Óscar Córdoba, 18 June 1994.\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\n\nTackle Râducioiu Ball recovery Petrescu Dispossesed Rincón Pass Petrescu Pass Popescu Pass Munteanu Goal Hagi\n\nKEY Ball movement Shot Player with ball Player without ball\n\n90\n\n1994 World Cup Goals PHILIPPE ALBERT – Belgium vs Germany\n\nDANIEL AMOKACHI – Nigeria vs Greece 1.

When it comes to individuals, EA Sports FIFA 17 listed its best dribblers as Messi (Barcelona) and Neymar (Barcelona). Real Madrid’s Ronaldo tops their most powerful shot list, but the top 10 also includes Hull City’s Tom Huddlestone, Schalke’s Naldo and Piti from Rayo Vallecano. Take a look at these comparison charts and see where Europe’s mazy masters and hot shot kings ply their trade.\n\nChelsea’s often unstoppable Eden Hazard boosted the Premier League’s stats by attempting more than 150 dribbles in the 2016–17 season.\n\n49,079 45,781 34,545\n\n12.9\n\n41,395\n\n12.0\n\n42,072\n\nPer Game\n\nPer Game\n\n11.3 11.1\n\n10.9\n\nPer Game\n\nPer Game\n\nPer Game\n\nPremier League\n\nBundesliga\n\nLa Liga\n\nLONG SHOTS 92\n\nSerie A\n\nLigue 1\n\nThe Flair League 142,820 Source: Opta (August 2007–May 2017)\n\n131,998 128,490 125,945 124,217\n\n42.0 Per Game\n\n37.6 34.7\n\nPer Game\n\n33.1\n\nPer Game\n\n32.7\n\nPer Game\n\nPremier League\n\nPer Game\n\nBundesliga\n\nLa Liga\n\nSerie A\n\nLigue 1\n\nDRIBBLES 93\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE PLAYER APPEARANCES With only 38 Premier League games played a season, a player needs a long career at the highest level to get anywhere near this list. It helps, of course to start young (you’ll need at least 12 seasons in the irst team), stay injury free and play into your 30s. Even then, it’s tough. The youngest to play was Fulham’s Matthew Brigg, 16 and 65 days when he made his debut in 2007, he amassed a total of 30 appearances. No wonder only around 100 players have notched up over 300 appearances.\n\nKEY: NUMBER OF GAMES SUBBED ON\n\nNUMBER OF GAMES SUBBED OFF\n\nNUMBER OF FULL GAMES PLAYED\n\nNUMBER OF GAMES STARTED TOTAL NUMBER OF APPEARANCES MADE * Active up to and including season 2016–17 Source: Opta (May 2017)\n\nNEVER SUBBED OFF\n\nJUSSI JÄÄSKELÄINEN\n\nMOST APPEARANCES / MOST GAMES SUBBED OFF\n\nRYAN GIGGS · 632 / 134\n\nMOST GAMES STARTED\n\nGARETH BARRY · 596\n\nMOST FULL GAMES PLAYED\n\nDAVID JAMES · 567\n\n600\n\n94\n\n550\n\n500\n\n450\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\nPremier League Player Appearances MANCHESTER CITY SOUTHAMPTON LIVERPOOL SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR COVENTRY CITY CHELSEA LIVERPOOL CHELSEA ASTON VILLA STOKE CITY ARSENAL PORTSMOUTH EVERTON ARSENAL LEEDS UNITED ARSENAL LEEDS UNITED LIVERPOOL TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR CHELSEA MANCHESTER UNITED EVERTON SOUTHAMPTON SOUTHAMPTON CHARLTON ATHLETIC WIMBLEDON FULHAM BLACKBURN ROVERS EVERTON ARSENAL BIRMINGHAM CITY FULHAM TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR LIVERPOOL TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR NEWCASTLE UNITED EVERTON ARSENAL ARSENAL ASTON VILLA STOKE CITY WEST HAM UNITED WIMBLEDON CHELSEA EVERTON SUNDERLAND MANCHESTER UNITED WEST HAM UNITED CRYSTAL PALACE ASTON VILLA BLACKBURN ROVERS TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR CHELSEA CHARLTON ATHLETIC LIVERPOOL ARSENAL MIDDLESBROUGH EVERTON CHELSEA FULHAM LEEDS UNITED EVERTON MANCHESTER UNITED BOLTON WANDERERS CHELSEA MIDDLESBROUGH MANCHESTER UNITED MANCHESTER UNITED LIVERPOOL TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR ASTON VILLA STOKE CITY MANCHESTER CITY BOLTON WANDERERS NEWCASTLE UNITED BOLTON WANDERERS MANCHESTER UNITED BLACKBURN ROVERS NEWCASTLE UNITED MANCHESTER CITY NEWCASTLE UNITED MANCHESTER UNITED TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR MANCHESTER CITY MANCHESTER UNITED CHELSEA MANCHESTER UNITED TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR LIVERPOOL MANCHESTER UNITED MANCHESTER UNITED LIVERPOOL MIDDLESBROUGH LIVERPOOL NEWCASTLE UNITED LIVERPOOL CHELSEA ASTON VILLA MANCHESTER UNITED\n\nNEVER SUBBED ON\n\nDAVID SEAMAN GARETH SOUTHGATE BRAD FRIEDEL SHAY GIVEN MARK SCHWARZER\n\nMOST GAMES SUBBED ON\n\nPETER CROUCH · 135\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n316 316 318 318 319 319 320 321 321 322 322 323 325 325 325 325 325 325 326 327 327 328 328 329 331 332 335 336 341 343 344 346 347 349 349 351 351 352 352 353 355 359 361 363 364 364 364 366 368 372 375 375 377 378 378 379 379 384"
