        "text": "Carl and Christine Ware met and fell in love when they were both freshmen in high school, he at Smyrna and she at Lake Forest.\n\nThey planned to go to university, get married and have a family.\n\nSept. 11, 2001, changed all that.\n\nChristine felt pulled to join the military after the attacks on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., the Twin Towers in New York City and the hijacking and crash of Flight 93 in Pennsylvania.\n\nCarl soon followed her.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, Carl became one of more than 20 Delawareans to die during the war on terror. Some were killed overseas, like Carl, and others died by suicide upon returning home.\n\nCarl and his fellow service members will be honored at the end of September as part of the 2019 Vet Fest in Middletown's Town of Whitehall development. The festival gives veterans an opportunity to gather and be celebrated for their service. Proceeds from the event go toward StopSoldierSuicide.org, a national organization focused on preventing suicides among veterans.\n\nRoughly 20 veterans die by suicide every day. The annual festival is intended to offer resources to veterans who are having suicidal thoughts or know of fellow veterans who may need support.\n\nThis year's event will feature a photographic memorial wall, \"Remembering Our Fallen.\" The wall highlight soldiers who have died since Sept. 11 and will be in Delaware from Sept. 27 to Oct. 2 during Vet Fest.\n\n\"They're the reason we have the freedoms we have,\" Christine Ware said.\n\nHere are short stories about each Delaware service member who has died since Sept. 11, 2001. (If we have missed any, please contact reporter Marina Affo at maffo@delawareonline.com).\n\nRichard Clifton\n\n2005\n\nRichard \"Chad\" Clifton had dreams of being a renowned writer like his favorites, who included beatnik poets Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Between lacrosse practice at Cape Henlopen High School, the teen would write stories in journals. He realized however, that to be as great as his heroes, he needed to experience more of the world.\n\nSo when the Milton resident graduated from Cape Henlopen in 2003, at the age of 18, he went straight to boot camp to become a Marine. His mother Terri remembers him saying, \"I want to be a great writer, but I have to live first,\" right before he left for Iraq, a day after his 19th birthday.\n\nHis mom said he was the kind of kid who, even though he didn't like opera music, still bought her an Andrea Bocelli CD for her birthday.\n\nChad was killed by enemy action in Iraq on Feb. 3, 2005. He was 19.\n\nAndrew Creighton\n\n2010\n\nAndrew \"A.J.\" Creighton loved music because he saw everything through the lens of math, and music was just a series of formulas to him. Before graduating from Sussex Tech High School in 2003, he played an integral part in recruiting people for the school's first band, his father Tim Creighton said. He said A.J. played multiple instruments including bass guitar and trombone.\n\nThere was a third M he loved besides math and music: the military. The Laurel resident's dream was to go to West Point Military Academy and he won the support of then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden. But Andrew decided he didn't want to wait, and enlisted in 2004.\n\nHe spent two years learning Korean and was a Special Forces translator and interrogator. “He loved to learn,” Tim Creighton said.\n\nA.J. drowned while conducting combat operations and his body was found on July 3, 2010. He was 23.\n\nKeith Fiscus\n\n2006\n\nKeith Fiscus loved golf and played for his high school team in California before his family moved to Delaware in 1998, where he graduated from Glasgow High School. A music lover, he taught himself to play the electric guitar.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army in 2002. Coming from a military family in which both of his grandfathers served, he was determined to continue that legacy, even though both of his parents urged him not to. They knew the toll military service takes on someone and wanted to shield Keith from the dangers of war.\n\n\"His destiny in life was to become an American soldier,\" his mother Pamela said at the time of his death. \"He was a proud American soldier.\"\n\nKeith died during his second tour when the Humvee he was in exploded due to a roadside bomb on Dec. 2, 2006 in Iraq. He was 26.\n\nMatthew Flocco\n\n2001\n\nMatthew Michael Flocco didn't consider joining the Navy until he was a senior at Newark High School. Until then, his energy was spent on baseball.\n\n\"He did whatever he could do on the baseball field and was a quiet leader who all the kids wanted to be around,\" said his high school baseball coach Curtis Bedford.\n\nOnce Flocco decided the Navy was his path, however, he put all his energy into being the best and getting to the top. He joined the Navy right after graduating from high school in 1998.\n\n\"He dedicated his life to his job and his friends,\" his father Michael said at the time of his death. His mother, Sheila, said he was a shy guy but loved giving back to his country.\n\nMatthew was a sailor specializing in weather for the Department of Defense and was stationed at the Pentagon. He died on Sept. 11, 2001 when the Pentagon was attacked. He was 21. Following his death, Matthew's father Michael helped rebuild the Pentagon in honor of his son.\n\nJoseph Garyantes\n\n2004\n\nJoseph Garyantes, a Sussex county native, was a career soldier who first joined the Army in February 1991.\n\n\"He was a good man; he was a good father to his boys,” said his brother Stephen.\n\nStephen noted that his brother was a fierce competitor and loved to play basketball in his spare time.\n\n\"We just want everyone to know that he loved his job and he believed in what he was doing in Iraq,\" his sister Jean Marie Shipley, of Milton, told the (Fort Myers, Fla.) News-Press.\n\nAt the time of his death, his family — wife Monika and sons Tevin and Ryan — had been stationed in Germany for several years.\n\nJoseph was killed by a sniper attack in Iraq on May 18, 2004. He was 34.\n\nFrances Graves III\n\n2015\n\nFrances \"Stoney\" Graves III was known as a prankster and was on the William Penn High School wrestling team for four years. A 2000 graduate, he enjoyed motorcycling, boating and bodybuilding. He joined the military in June 2002 and did one tour of Iraq, following in his father's footsteps.\n\n\"Everybody loved him and he was a very loyal soldier to his brothers,\" his father Rocky told the News Journal earlier this year. \"He was a person you would want on the machine gun.\"\n\nDespite seeking and getting help, Stoney died on Jan. 29, 2015 from a deliberate heroin overdose. He was 32.\n\nTravis Griffin\n\n2006\n\nIn an interview with the American military newspaper Stars and Stripes the November before his death, Travis Griffin said: \"I want to leave knowing that we've done something.\"\n\nThe former Dover resident came from a military family that dedicated itself to defending the country. Born on a military base in Okinawa, Japan, Graves spent almost nine years in the Air Force.\n\n\"He died doing what he loved,\" his mother Christine Herwick told the News Journal.\n\nTravis was in the middle of a yearlong deployment in Baghdad when he was killed in an explosion on June 2, 2006. He was 28.\n\nDarren Harmon\n\n2006\n\nA New Castle native, Darren Harmon joined the Army shortly after graduating from William Penn High School, where he played football.\n\nA devoted father of four, he was also a veteran of Desert Storm.\n\nHis father, Fisher Harmon, said that besides being a loving father, his son enjoyed fishing and collecting tropical fish. \"He loved the water,\" Fisher said.\n\nDarren died of a heart attack at base camp in Iraq on June 6, 2006. He was 44.\n\nRichard James\n\n2006\n\nRichard James was never someone who stayed quiet in the corner. \"He made himself known to everybody. He was a real character,\" his mother Carol James said.\n\nAt Seaford Christian Academy he was a passionate basketball player and also spiritual, always exploring different faiths.\n\nRichard wanted to join the Army when he was 17 but his parents would not sign him up. So he enlisted himself the day after his 18 birthday in 2004. His family said he used to call home to ask for Bible verse recommendations to share with his fellow troops.\n\nHe was particularly enjoying his second tour in Iraq when he was shot by insurgents and died on May 13, 2006. He was 20.\n\nRyan Long\n\n2003\n\nRyan Long was active in his school's JROTC program. He was a fourth-generation soldier. Both of his parents served in the military so he was interested in learning and understanding the ways of the Army.\n\nRyan joined right after graduating from Seaford High School in 1999, following in the footsteps of his mom, dad and grandparents.\n\nHis mom, Donna Long, wants people to remember how outgoing and generous he was. \"He loved life and he did everything to the max,\" she said.\n\nHe died when a suicide bomber exploded near him in Iraq on April 3, 2003. Donna Long learned following his death that he had been trying to protect his buddies at a checkpoint in Iraq. He was 21.\n\nElizabeth Loncki\n\n2007\n\nElizabeth graduated in 2001 from Padua Academy in Wilmington, where she was a volleyball player. She then attended Arizona State University until March 2003 when she enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. She graduated from the Naval Tech Explosive Ordinance Disposal School at the Eglin Air Force Base in 2004.\n\nShe deployed to Iraq in September 2006.\n\nThe New Castle resident told her family before she went to Iraq that they should not worry, an aunt said at the time of her death. \"She was a star in our family — strong, smart and beautiful. She loved her country,\" her grandmother Chris Loncki said in 2013.\n\nShe was 20 days away from coming home when she was killed by a car bomb in Iraq on Jan. 7, 2007. She was 23 and she's the only woman from Delaware killed in Iraq.\n\nBrian McGinnis\n\n2003\n\nBrian McGinnis graduated from William Penn High School in 1998. Although his wrestling coach urged him to go to college, Brian said the Marines were the best thing for him and he enlisted.\n\nThe St. Georges resident is remembered as being patriotic by both family and Army comrades. \"He was so proud to be doing something for his country in Iraq,\" Cpl. Bill Quirk, a member of Brian's unit, said at his funeral in 2003. Brian was planning to leave the Marines in March 2003 to start a family and get a civilian job, but the country went to war against Iraq that month.\n\nHis wife, Megan, whom he'd met while in high school, said at his funeral that she would miss reminiscing about their senior prom, trips to to New Jersey where McGinnis was born and looking back on their wedding and honeymoon to Walt Disney world together.\n\nHe was the first Delawarean to die in Iraq, only 10 days after the war began. He lost his life in a helicopter crash on March 30, 2003. He was 23.\n\nStephen McGowan\n\n2005\n\nFor his 26th birthday, Steve McGowan sent his mother flowers from Iraq with the words \"Thank you for having me.\" His mom, Bobbie McGowen, said that was the type of person her son was: playful and a prankster but incredibly loyal to his friends, family and faith.\n\nHis mother remembers the Army medic as the type of bold person who traveled the world and never had trouble going up to strangers and saying hi.\n\nA Newark native and St. Mark’s High School graduate, Steve loved children. While in Iraq he carried Beanie Babies to hand out to children in villages and became known as the Beanie Baby Soldier.\n\nSteve died March 4, 2005 when a roadside bomb exploded. He was 26.\n\nJames Moudy\n\n2005\n\nBefore James \"Shawn\" Moudy graduated from Tatnall High School in 1987, he was an active football player and was goalkeeper for the school's first lacrosse team. Even back then, however, he knew that he wanted to go into the Army.\n\nAfter graduation, the Newark resident attended the Marion Military Institute in Alabama where he was in the ROTC and was also part of the Alabama National Guard. He joined the Army in 1988. Eventually he was sent to Korea and it was there that he met his wife, Pak Myong Sun. The two were married in 1991.\n\nThe Moudys described Shawn as \"earnest but fun-loving.\" He loved the outdoors and enjoyed spending time with his wife and daughter.\n\nShawn died when a roadside bomb went off near his Humvee in Baghdad on Dec. 11, 2005. He was 37.\n\nSean Mullen\n\n2013\n\nSean Mullen grew up in Dover after moving to Delaware from Pennsylvania at the age of 3.\n\nHe was known as an organized person whom everyone could go to if they needed anything or needed help with a project. His sister Christina said when he was growing up, people called him \"The Organizer.\"\n\nMullen graduated from Caesar Rodney High School in 1992. After serving with the Maryland National Guard he went on active duty in 1995.\n\nWhen not in the Army he enjoyed spending time with his wife, Nancy, and their two dogs, Patton and Gwennie. He also read anything he could get his hands on and enjoyed rescuing and caring for strays.\n\n\"He was just a good person,\" his mother Miriam Mullen said.\n\nOn June 2, 2013, he was killed in action while conducting combat operations in Afghanistan. He was 39 years old.\n\nCory Palmer\n\n2006\n\nCory Palmer was a soccer player and was on the varsity team his senior year at Seaford High School. The Seaford resident had dreams of being an engineer after high school, however, and went to West Virginia University after graduating in 2002.\n\nHe was at West Virginia University when he decided that he wanted to do more than just study engineering, so he enlisted in the Marines.\n\nHis uncle, Ralph Palmer, said his nephew always felt the pull to do anything he could for his country and went on two tours of Iraq.\n\nCory was on his second tour in Iraq in May when a roadside bomb went off near the car he was in.\n\n\"He was always positive and wasn't hesitant to go to war either time,\" his uncle Ralph Palmer said shortly after his death.\n\nCory died from his injuries on May 6, 2006. He was 21 years old.\n\nAnthony Roberts\n\n2004\n\nAs a child Anthony Roberts enjoyed T-ball, Little League and karate. He was his mother's only son and the pair were very close. \"He was a wonderful, wonderful son,\" Emma Roberts said.\n\nA graduate of Middletown High School, he ran track, played the saxophone, did student theater, participated in modern dance and spent free time writing raps.\n\nHe was also a member of the school's Air Force ROTC.\n\nStudents who knew and looked up to him described him as a popular guy who was fearless in everything he did.\n\n\"He never backed down from nothing. When he wanted to do something he did it,\" said Maurice Thomas, a classmate of Roberts.\n\nTeachers described him as a sharp dressing, smooth talking kid who saw the Marines as his ticket out of his small town.\n\nThe Glasgow native was 17 and less than a year out of high school when he decided to join the military.\n\nAnthony died during an enemy ambush in Iraq on April 6, 2004. He was 18.\n\nStephen Snowberger III\n\n2006\n\nStevie Snowberger grew up in Bear and went to William Penn High School until he was 16. Then he transferred to the Red Rock Job Corps, an education and vocational school in Pennsylvania that his mother felt would help him land a better job after high school.\n\nIt was there that Snowberger decided he wanted to join the Army.\n\n\"He thought that if he stayed in (the Army) he'd have his education and still be young enough to do something else,\" his mom Debbie Brown said shortly after his death.\n\nStevie joined the Army when he was 17, at the end of 2004.\n\nHis mom said he was always able to make friends easily and wasn't afraid of the dangers of war.\n\n\"I said to him, 'You know what's going on right now, don't you?' And he said, 'Mom, I'm not afraid of the sandbox.' That's how he was,\" she said.\n\nStevie died on May 11, 2006 when a bomb exploded near his Humvee in Baghdad. He was 18.\n\nChristopher Slutman\n\n2019\n\nChristopher Slutman was a Maryland native who became an Eagle Scout while playing football and baseball as well as wrestling in high school.

He was a decorated firefighter in New York for 15 years before he went to Afghanistan. Although he worked with the fire department there, his wife Shannon and their three daughters lived outside Wilmington.\n\nShannon described him as a gentleman and hero. \"He was a friend who always gave back more than he took,\" she said at his memorial service.\n\n\"Christopher always helped people,\" his father Fletcher Slutman Jr. said. \"He was nice.

He was the third soldier from Delaware killed in Iraq. He was 27 years old.\n\nCarl Ware\n\n2006\n\nChristine and Carl Ware met after being set up by her best friend and his brother, and went on to date throughout high school. They married at 19 on a Hawaii Air Force base where both were stationed.\n\nA military policeman, Carl shipped out to Iraq in May of 2006. By then, he and Christine had one daughter, Caitlyn, and another one on the way.\n\nChristine left the military after Carl's death, and their second daughter, Carly, was born six months later.\n\nThirteen years after Carl's death, Christine — now 35 — still misses everything about him, she said. Her favorite memories include the birth of their first daughter and a beach day when the proud dad took Caitlyn on a boogie board for the first time.\n\n\"I would tell him I miss him. And I love him. And I wish he could be here to see our girls. And I hope he's proud of me,\" Christine said.\n\nCarl died after another airman shot him while cleaning a gun on July 1, 2006.

His family and friends said he really liked football, hunting, skiing and anything that got him on water.\n\nHe joined the military in 2003, a year after graduating from high school.\n\nHis mother Tricia said Russell was always a smiley person, even during basic training when orders were being shouted at him.\n\n\"They couldn't crack him,\" his father Gregg White said.\n\nThe Dagsboro native was then part of a team sent over in 2004 to root out al-Qaida members, particularly Osama bin Laden.\n\nRussell was killed June 20, 2004 when he was shot by another Marine cleaning his gun. He was 19.\n\nBoyd Wicks Jr.\n\n2004\n\nBoyd \"Chip\" Wicks was a guard on the varsity football team and played lacrosse and baseball at Concord High School in Wilmington, but also wanted to be a writer.\n\nAbove all else, however, he wanted to give back. He told his father Boyd Wicks Sr. that he thought joining the Marines would be the perfect way to do that. So when he turned 18 and was a senior at Concord, he signed up, joining after he graduated in 1999.\n\nChip ended up in Kuwait as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. After he came back in 2003, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and died by suicide on Feb. 27, 2004. He was 23.\n\nContact Marina Affo at maffo@delawareonline.com.
