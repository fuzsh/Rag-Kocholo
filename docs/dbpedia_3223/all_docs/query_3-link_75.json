(in EXCEL)\n\nMedian Family Incomes\n\nQ1. How does HUD calculate median family incomes?\n\nTo calculate the FY 2024 median incomes, HUD uses 2022 Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) data for most areas of the country. HUD evaluates the ACS estimates of median family income for statistical validity. For an ACS estimate to be considered statistically valid, the estimate must have a margin of error less than half the size of the estimate and the estimate must be based on at least 100 observations. In areas where there is a statistically valid survey estimate using 2022 one-year ACS data, that is used. If not, statistically valid 2022 five-year data is used. Where statistically valid five-year data is not available, HUD will average the minimally statistically valid income estimates from the previous three years of ACS data. Minimal statistical validity is defined as those ACS estimates where the margin of error of the estimate is less than half the size of the estimate. ACS data from 2022, 2021, and 2020 will be evaluated to determine if it is minimally statistically valid. HUD averages the minimally statistically valid 5-year data which is adjusted to 2022 dollars using the national change in CPI between the ACS year of the data and 2022. For all places in the US including Puerto Rico, the estimates (using either one-year data or five-year data) are then inflated from 2022 to Fiscal Year 2024 using the Consumer Price Index forecast from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nFor additional details concerning the use of the ACS in HUD’s calculations of MFI, please see our FY 2024 Median Family Income methodology document, at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2024_data.\n\nAdditionally, full documentation of all calculations for Median Family Incomes are available in the FY 2024 Median Family Income and the FY 2024 Income Limits Documentation System. These systems are available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2024_query.\n\nQ2. What is the difference between HUD’s Median Family Income (MFI) and Area Median Income (AMI)?\n\nHUD estimates Median Family Income (MFI) annually for each metropolitan area and non-metropolitan county. The metropolitan area definitions are the same ones HUD uses for Fair Market Rents (except where statute requires a different configuration). HUD calculates Income Limits as a function of the area's Median Family Income (MFI). The basis for HUD’s median family incomes is data from the American Community Survey, table B19113 - MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS.\n\nThe term Area Median Income is the term used more generally in the affordable housing industry. If the term Area Median Income (AMI) is used in an unqualified manner, this reference is synonymous with HUD's MFI. However, if the term AMI is qualified in some way - generally percentages of AMI, or AMI adjusted for family size, then this is a reference to HUD's income limits, which are calculated as percentages of median incomes and include adjustments for families of different sizes.\n\nIncome Limits\n\nQ3. What is the limit on increases and decreases to income limits for FY 2024?\n\nSince FY 20101 HUD has limited annual decreases in the low- and very low-income limits to five percent and all annual increases to the greater of five percent or twice the change in the national median family income. For 2024 and hereafter, HUD is specifying that the cap should be measured using the annual change in the unadjusted national median family income subject to an absolute cap of 10 percent. HUD first announced this methodology on January 10, 2024 in a Federal Register Notice. For 2024, the annual change is measured by the ACS from 2021 to 2022. Twice this change is approximately 14.8 percent, which is greater than the ten percent absolute cap. So, for FY 2024, the income limits “cap” is 10 percent.\n\nQ4. Is HUD raising rents on low-income tenants?\n\nThe potential impact of changing income limits varies based on the program. Many tenants in Federally-supported housing will see no impact because rents are directly tied to their incomes. For other programs, such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits, properties have their maximum allowed rents based on the income limits that HUD is mandated to publish. The Federal government has no control over how individual LIHTC landlords set rents within the prescribed range. HUD has not required or suggested rent increases. To the extent that owners increase rents, they should be minimal increases, phased in over time, and only to an extent consistent with maintaining financial feasibility of the property.\n\nQ5. Why don’t the income limits for my area reflect recent gains (or losses)?\n\nAlthough HUD uses the most recent data available concerning local area incomes, there is still a lag between when the data are collected and when the data are available for use. For example, FY 2024 Income Limits are calculated using 2017-2021 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data, and one-year 2021 data where possible. This is a two-year lag, so more current trends in median family income levels are not available.\n\nQ6. Why does my very low-income limit not equal 50% of my median family income (or my low-income limit not equal 80% of my median income)?\n\nThere are many exceptions to the arithmetic calculation of income limits. These include adjustments for high housing cost relative to income, the application of state nonmetropolitan income limits in low-income areas, and national maximums in high-income areas. These exceptions are detailed in the FY 2024 Income Limits Methodology Document, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2024_data. Please also note that Tables 1 and 2 show that most nonmetropolitan area income limits are based on state nonmetropolitan area medians.\n\nFor further information on the exact adjustments made to an individual area of the country, please see our FY 2024 Income Limits Documentation System. The documentation system is available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2024_query. Once the area in question is selected, a summary of the area’s median income, Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-Income Limits are displayed. Detailed calculations are obtained by selecting the relevant links.\n\nQ7. Why is the Extremely Low-Income Limit sometimes no different than the Very Low-Income Limit?\n\nThe Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 established a new income limit standard based on 30 percent of median family income (the extremely low-income limits), which was to be adjusted for family size and for areas of unusually high or low family income. A statutory change was made in 1999 to clarify that these income limits should be tied to the Section 8 very low-income limits.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 further modified and redefined these limits as extremely low family income limits to ensure that these income limits would not fall below the poverty guidelines determined for each family size. Specifically, extremely low-income families are defined to be very low-income families whose incomes are the greater of the Poverty Guidelines as published and periodically updated by the Department of Health and Human Services or the 30 percent income limits calculated by HUD. Puerto Rico and other territories are specifically excluded from this adjustment. There are separate poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii. The remaining 48 states and the District of Columbia use the same poverty guidelines. The extremely low-income limits therefore are first calculated as 30/50ths (60 percent) of the Section 8 very low-income limits. They are then compared to the appropriate poverty guideline and if the poverty guideline is higher, that value is chosen. If the poverty guideline is above the very low-income limit at that family size, the extremely low-income limit is set at the very low-income limit because the definition of extremely low-income limits caps them at the very low-income levels.\n\nAdditionally, starting in FY 2023, HUD elected to set the extremely low income limit at the level of the very low income limit for Puerto Rico to expand the number of households eligible for targeted assistance within HUD programs that have targeting requirements based on the extremely low income limit.\n\nQ8. Why am I unable to access the FY 2024 Income Limits Documentation System using a prior year bookmark, or using the results of web search? Using links from these methods generally result in broken webpages.\n\nThe income limits documentation calculates median family incomes and income limits for each area of the country; therefore, certain parameters must be set for these calculations to be performed correctly. Please access the FY 2024 Income Limits Documentation System using this link: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2024_query.\n\nArea Definitions:\n\nQ9. Why do area definitions change for median incomes and income limits?\n\nHUD follows Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan areas with some exceptions. In 2006, when HUD implemented the widespread area definition changes OMB made based on the 2000 Decennial Census, exceptions were made to the new OMB area definitions when FMR or MFI changes for new areas were greater than five percent. HUD created exception subareas, called HUD Metro FMR Areas (HMFA), which continue to exist today.\n\nThe FY 2024 MFIs and income limits are based on metropolitan area definitions, defined by OMB using commuting relationships from the Census, as updated through 2018. While HUD has maintained its HMFA subareas, there is no longer the five percent FMR or median income test; all counties added to metropolitan areas will be an HMFA with rents and incomes based on their own county data, where available. The disposition of all counties is shown in the Area Definitions report https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2024_data.\n\nQ10. What is the relationship between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas?\n\nWith minor exceptions, FMR areas and Income Limit areas are identical. HUD uses FMR areas in calculating income limits because FMRs are needed for the calculation of some income limits; specifically, to determine high and low housing cost adjustments. Also, the two sets of area definitions are linked in statutory history. The exception to the similarity between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas is Rockland County, NY. By statute, income limits are calculated for Rockland County, NY while separate FMRs are not.\n\nQ11. What does the term “HMFA” mean?\n\nHUD Metro FMR Area. This term indicates that only a portion of the OMB-defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is in the area to which the income limits (or FMRs) apply. HUD is required by OMB to alter the name of metropolitan geographic entities it derives from the MSAs when the geography is not the same as that established by OMB.\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs) (otherwise known as Low-Income Tax Credit projects (LIHTC) or tax-exempt bond-financed projects)\n\nQ12. What is the national non-metro median to be used to calculate the floor on rural LIHTC rents?\n\nSection 3004 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) specifies that any project for residential rental property located in a rural area (as defined in section 520 of the Housing Act of 1949) use the maximum of the area median gross income or the national non-metropolitan median income. The current year non-metropolitan median income and the 1-8 person 50-percent income limits based on the non-metropolitan median income are listed in the table available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il24/FY2024-National-Non-Met-Very-Low-Income-Limits.xlsx.\n\nQ13. What are Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects?\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs), a term used by HUD, are all Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and multifamily projects funded by tax-exempt bonds under Section 142 (which generally also benefit from LIHTC). These projects may have special income limits established by statute so HUD publishes them on a separate webpage. If you are a tax credit developer or resident in an MTSP, please go to the following site to determine what the appropriate income limits are, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html.\n\nQ14. How can 60 percent income limits be calculated?\n\nFor the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, users should refer to the FY 2024 Multifamily Tax Subsidy Project income limits available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html. The formula used to compute these income limits is as follows: take 120 percent of the Very Low-Income Limit. Do not calculate income limit percentages based on a direct arithmetic relationship with the median family income; there are too many exceptions made to the arithmetic rule in computing income limits.\n\nQ15. How are maximum rents for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects computed from the very low-income limits?\n\nPlease consult with the state housing financing agency that governs the tax credit project in question for a determination of official maximum rental rates. A list of state housing finance agencies can be found at https://lihtc.huduser.gov/agency_list.htm. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is a U.S. Treasury Department program; therefore, HUD has no official authority over setting maximum rental rates. The following table is included for informational purposes only.\n\nThe imputed income limitation (as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42(g)(2)) is 60 percent of the median income. A rent may not exceed 30 percent of this imputed income limitation under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42(g)(2). Unit rents by number of bedrooms are derived from Very Low-Income Limits (VLILs) for the different household sizes according to the following table:\n\nLIHTC Maximum Rent Derivation from HUD Very Low-Income Limits (VLILs)\n\nUnit Size 0 Bedroom 1 Bedroom 2 Bedroom 3 Bedroom 4 Bedroom 50% MFI Unit Maximum Monthly Rent is 1/12 of 30% of: 1-Person VLIL (1-Person VLIL + 2-Person VLIL)/2 3-Person VLIL (4-Person VLIL + 5-Person VLIL)/2 6-Person VLIL 60% MFI Unit Maximum Monthly Rent is 1/12 of 30% of: 120% of 1-Person VLIL 120% of [(1-Person VLIL + 2-Person VLIL)/2] 120% of 3-Person VLIL 120% of [(4-Person VLIL + 5-Person VLIL)/2] 120% of 6-Person VLIL\n\nNOTE: Maximum rents for larger units are set by assuming an additional 1.5 persons per bedroom.\n\n1. Prior to FY 2010, HUD maintained a “hold harmless” policy, whereby Section 8 income limits for certain areas were held at previously published levels when reductions would otherwise have resulted from changes in housing cost, median income, or income limit methodologies, or changes in metropolitan area definitions.\n\nFAQs on FY24 Income Limit Cap-on-Cap\n\nWhat are Income Limits?\n\nEvery year, HUD publishes annual income limits, which are used primarily to determine the income eligibility of applicants for HUD housing assistance programs and are based on data from the American Community Survey and other sources. The income limit for federal affordable housing programs is the maximum income a household can earn to qualify or be targeted for assistance.\n\nIncome Limit methodology. Income limits are based on a percent of median family income for an area and are adjusted based on how many people live in the household (including children). More information on how income limits are calculated is available here.\n\nIncome Limit use for setting rents. In addition to being used to determine eligibility for federal rental housing programs, income limits are also used to determine the maximum rents allowed for the HOME and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) incentive. More information on “Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects” limits is available here.\n\nWhat is new for the income limit methodology in 2024?\n\nWe are making a modification to the methodology for determining the cap on how much income limits can go up in a single year in any individual Fair Market Rent (FMR) area (FMR areas are generally metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan counties).\n\nExisting cap. Since 2009, HUD has limited the year-to-year increase in income limits as the higher of five percent or twice the percentage change in national median family income.1 The list of annual caps on year-over-year increases since HUD instituted this policy is as follows: 2\n\nYear Cap FY 2010 5.00% FY 2011 5.00% FY 2012 5.00% FY 2013 5.00% FY 2014 5.00% FY 2015 5.95% FY 2016 5.00% FY 2017 7.00% FY 2018 11.47% FY 2019 10.01% FY 2020 7.95% FY 2021 5.00% FY 2022 11.89% FY 2023 5.92%\n\nModification to the cap. This year, HUD is putting an additional parameter such that if twice the change in national median income is over 10%, the cap in that year can’t be greater than 10%. We are calling this the “cap-on-cap.” HUD issued a Notice in January 2024 seeking comment on this change, and after consideration of the comments has decided to move forward with the change.\n\nHUD also conferred with the Treasury Department, which administers the LIHTC incentive, to determine how to improve the income limits methodology as applied to that incentive.\n\nWhy is HUD making this “cap-on-cap” change?\n\nWe are making this change for three reasons:\n\nTenant protection. Because income limits are used by landlords to set rents in the HOME program and LIHTC incentive, this change protects against single-year rent increases of more than 10 percent for affordable housing properties receiving these federal benefits. By limiting increases in income limits, HUD decreases the burden on low-income households who otherwise would face a large single-year rent increase resulting from higher income limits.\n\nStatistical error. The data used to determine income limits in some FMR areas may not have a large sample size, and thus statistical error could lead to a change in the estimated local median income that is greater than actual change. If the increase is a real increase, that would likely be captured in the following year’s data and result in a smoother increase in the income estimate over two years. It would be highly unusual to have multiple years of annual income growth over 10 percent, so for places with a cap and real income growth, HUD’s income limits would be expected to “catch up” in years with slower income growth. If the increase is due to statistical error, then we would not have raised the income limits (and potentially lead to sharp rent increases) unnecessarily.\n\nStability and certainty. With the adoption of this methodological change, HUD also hopes to assist affordable housing development by providing some additional certainty on future maximum income limit increases and the data used to determine that limit. In response to the Notice, several commenters indicated that this certainty will be helpful in planning for the financial viability of current and future projects.\n\nHow many areas does the cap impact in 2024?\n\nIn FY 2024, the cap of 10 percent allowed increase would apply to 21 percent of FMR areas.3\n\nDoes the “cap-on-cap” mean owners of LIHTC properties won’t have enough rent revenue to maintain their properties?\n\nNo, we don’t think the new “cap on cap” will impact LIHTC owners ability to operate and maintain their properties.\n\nUnder current Treasury rules, LIHTC owners are not required to lower their rents when incomes in an area decrease. They are also not required to raise their rents when income limits increase, but they may. We recognize that landlords have experienced increased costs associated with higher labor costs, higher material costs, and higher insurance costs. HUD calculates year-to-year change on these costs as part of its Operating Cost Adjustment Factors for HUD-assisted housing. HUD estimates of the combined increases in costs for labor, materials, and insurance in 2023 and 2024, capturing the inflationary period of 2022, never exceeded 10 percent in any state.\n\nIn properties financed with LIHTC, owners also do not typically assume annual rent growth in excess of 10 percent. In fact, financial underwriting criteria are generally much more conservative, assuming rent growth in the range of 2 or 3 percent annually. While we recognize that property owners are under financial pressure given recent increases in both development and operating costs, the 10 percent “cap on cap” appropriately balances the economic pressure on owners with the objectives of reducing risk of statistical error and protecting low-income residents from untenable rent increases described above.\n\nIn addition, because it is highly unusual to have multiple years of annual income growth over 10 percent, properties in jurisdictions with newly capped income limit increases could phase in rent increases over a multi-year period instead of implementing a larger increase all in one year. HUD’s income limits would be expected to “catch up” in years with slower income growth and allow owners to raise rents as needed to cover any higher cost to operate.\n\nDoes this mean the developers of LIHTC properties won’t seek credits or build housing?\n\nNo, we don’t think the new “cap on cap” will impact the supply of new LIHTC properties nationally. HUD has had a cap on income limits since 2009 and we’ve seen no evidence that caps – even those much lower than 10 percent – have limited supply nationally. Because demand for LIHTC credits is significantly larger than the current supply of credits, the overall supply of LIHTC properties should not be affected by a cap on the cap on single-year rent increases in a limited number of places.\n\nIn comments HUD received in response to the Notice announcing the methodology change, some advocates for the LIHTC developer community noted that new developments are the most impacted by the cap because developers would be able to build more units if they are able to charge higher rents.\n\nHUD notes that the cap on income limit increases is but one component of the financing and operation of LIHTC properties. The future income level will often not be known and may result in lower income limits than planned properties have assumed, regardless of the cap on income limit increases. Developers of properties financed with LIHTC do not typically assume annual rent growth in excess of 10 percent; rather, financial underwriting criteria are much more conservative, assuming rent growth in the range of 2 or 3 percent annually.\n\nIn addition, properties in jurisdictions with newly capped income limit increases could phase in rent increases over a multi-year period instead of implementing a larger increase all in one year. At most, the capped increase on income limits would moderate exceptionally high rent growth in a limited number of areas for just one-to-two years. A cap of ten percent represents an exceptionally high value compared to historical averages, suggesting that income limits calculated using a 10% cap in one year will “catch up” in future years. For example, over 65% of all Income Limit areas that were covered by the cap in FY23 will either catch up and become uncapped in FY24 or get the full 10% capped increase that exceeds their increase in local AMFI.\n\nWe think this cap-on-cap is a very reasonable limitation. As noted above, a cap has been in place for fifteen years, usually capping at significantly less than 10 percent, and interest in credits has still exceeded demand for credits nationally. This policy change has no impact on developers who wish to build market rate housing without the LIHTC subsidy.\n\nWill the “cap on cap” mean that people whose incomes are still low but rising faster than income limits will be ineligible for federal housing assistance?\n\nThis may impact a small number of potentially eligible households. Households on a fixed income are a large portion of the population in need of housing assistance. In general, a 10 percent cap on year-to-year increases exceeds any likely increase in income for households with fixed income cost of living adjustments (COLA). The largest Social Security COLA adjustment in recent years was 8.7 percent in 2022. Only in 1980 and 1981 was it above 10 percent.\n\n1. Prior to FY 2022, the change in national median family income relied on American Community Survey (ACS) year-to-year change adjusted by inflation. Beginning in FY 2022 and continuing, the year-to-year change only uses ACS change.\n\n2. Since 2009, HUD has put a “floor” on the “cap” at 5%. Without that floor, the 5% cap in years with slower income growth would’ve been significantly lower.\n\n3. In areas where the very low-income limit exceeds the statutory target of 50% of median family income because of adjustments we make to income limits such as the high housing cost adjustment and state non-metropolitan minimum, the year-to-year cap of 10 percent increase also applies. For FY 2024, over 90% of the country by population is in an area where the 4-person Very Low-Income Limit is equal to or exceeds 50% of area median family income (82% of all areas).\n\nQuery Tool\n\nDocuments\n\nData\n\nFAQs\n\nEffective May 15, 2023.\n\nAccess Individual Income Limits Areas\n\nThis system provides complete documentation of the development of the FY 2023 Income Limits (ILs) for any area of the country selected by the user.

(in EXCEL)\n\nMedian Family Incomes\n\nQ1. How does HUD calculate median family incomes?\n\nTo calculate the FY 2023 median incomes, HUD uses 2021 American Community Survey (ACS) median family incomes as the basis for FY 2023 medians for all areas designated as Fair Market Rent areas in the US including Puerto Rico. HUD would have ordinarily used 2020 ACS data for FY 2023; however, the Census Bureau did not release standard one-year estimates from the 2020 ACS due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on data collection (for more information please see this statement). For an ACS estimate to be considered statistically valid, the estimate must have a margin of error less than half the size of the estimate and the estimate must be based on at least 100 observations. In areas where there is a statistically valid survey estimate using 2021 one-year ACS data, that is used. If not, statistically valid 2021 five-year data is used. Where statistically valid five-year data is not available, HUD will average the minimally statistically valid income estimates from the previous three years of ACS or PRCS data. Minimal statistical validity is defined as those ACS estimates where the margin of error of the estimate is less than half the size of the estimate. ACS data from 2021, 2020, and 2019 will be evaluated to determine if it is minimally statistically valid. HUD averages the minimally statistically valid 5-year data which is adjusted to 2021 dollars using the national change in CPI between the ACS year of the data and 2021. For all places in the US including Puerto Rico, the estimates (using either one-year data or five-year data) are then inflated from 2021 to Fiscal Year using the Consumer Price Index forecast from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nFor additional details concerning the use of the ACS in HUD’s calculations of MFI, please see our FY 2023 Median Family Income methodology document, at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2023_data.\n\nAdditionally, full documentation of all calculations for Median Family Incomes are available in the FY 2023 Median Family Income and the FY 2023 Income Limits Documentation System. These systems are available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2023_query.\n\nQ2. What is the difference between HUD’s Median Family Income (MFI) and Area Median Income (AMI)?\n\nHUD estimates Median Family Income (MFI) annually for each metropolitan area and non-metropolitan county. The metropolitan area definitions are the same ones HUD uses for Fair Market Rents (except where statute requires a different configuration). HUD calculates Income Limits as a function of the area's Median Family Income (MFI). The basis for HUD’s median family incomes is data from the American Community Survey, table B19113 - MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS.\n\nThe term Area Median Income is the term used more generally in the affordable housing industry. If the term Area Median Income (AMI) is used in an unqualified manner, this reference is synonymous with HUD's MFI. However, if the term AMI is qualified in some way - generally percentages of AMI, or AMI adjusted for family size, then this is a reference to HUD's income limits, which are calculated as percentages of median incomes and include adjustments for families of different sizes.\n\nIncome Limits\n\nQ3. What is the limit on increases and decreases to income limits for FY 2023?\n\nSince FY 2010, HUD has not allowed income limits to decrease by more than five percent, and not allowed income limits to increase by the greater of five percent or twice the annual change in national median family income. For FY 2023, the two most recent years of national median family income data are from the American Community Survey (ACS) in 2020 and 2021, at $84,394 and $85,806. However, because HUD did not use the ACS 2020 data for FY 2022 or FY 2023 Income Limits as the Census Bureau deemed it “experimental”, HUD is retaining the 2019 ACS national median of $80,944. HUD compares this to the 2021 ACS national median family income of $85,806. This is a cumulative two-year change of 6.01%, or 2.96% on an annual basis. Two times 2.96% is 5.92%. This exceeds five percent, so the limit on increases in income limits is set at approximately 5.92%. (Note that HUD uses unrounded percentages in its actual calculations). The limit on decreases in income limits remains five percent.\n\nQ4. Is HUD raising rents on low-income tenants?\n\nThe potential impact of changing income limits varies based on the program. Many tenants in Federally-supported housing will see no impact because rents are directly tied to their incomes. For other programs, such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits, properties have their maximum allowed rents based on the income limits that HUD is mandated to publish. The Federal government has no control over how individual LIHTC landlords set rents within the prescribed range. HUD has not required or suggested rent increases. To the extent that owners increase rents, they should be minimal increases, phased in over time, and only to an extent consistent with maintaining financial feasibility of the property.\n\nQ5. Why don’t the income limits for my area reflect recent gains (or losses)?\n\nAlthough HUD uses the most recent data available concerning local area incomes, there is still a lag between when the data are collected and when the data are available for use. For example, FY 2023 Income Limits are calculated using 2017-2021 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data, and one-year 2021 data where possible. This is a two-year lag, so more current trends in median family income levels are not available.\n\nQ6. Why does my very low-income limit not equal 50% of my median family income (or my low-income limit not equal 80% of my median income)?\n\nThere are many exceptions to the arithmetic calculation of income limits. These include adjustments for high housing cost relative to income, the application of state nonmetropolitan income limits in low-income areas, and national maximums in high-income areas. These exceptions are detailed in the FY 2023 Income Limits Methodology Document, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2023_data. Please also note that Tables 1 and 2 (beginning on page 5) show that most nonmetropolitan area income limits are based on state nonmetropolitan area medians.\n\nFor further information on the exact adjustments made to an individual area of the country, please see our FY 2023 Income Limits Documentation System. The documentation system is available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2023_query. Once the area in question is selected, a summary of the area’s median income, Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-Income Limits are displayed. Detailed calculations are obtained by selecting the relevant links.\n\nQ7. Why is the Extremely Low-Income Limit sometimes no different than the Very Low-Income Limit?\n\nThe Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 established a new income limit standard based on 30 percent of median family income (the extremely low-income limits), which was to be adjusted for family size and for areas of unusually high or low family income. A statutory change was made in 1999 to clarify that these income limits should be tied to the Section 8 very low-income limits.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 further modified and redefined these limits as Extremely Low Family income limits to ensure that these income limits would not fall below the poverty guidelines determined for each family size. Specifically, extremely low-income families are defined to be very low-income families whose incomes are the greater of the Poverty Guidelines as published and periodically updated by the Department of Health and Human Services or the 30 percent income limits calculated by HUD. Puerto Rico and other territories are specifically excluded from this adjustment. There are separate poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii. The remaining 48 states and the District of Columbia use the same poverty guidelines. The extremely low-income limits therefore are first calculated as 30/50ths (60 percent) of the Section 8 very low-income limits. They are then compared to the appropriate poverty guideline and if the poverty guideline is higher, that value is chosen. If the poverty guideline is above the very low-income limit at that family size, the extremely low-income limit is set at the very low-income limit because the definition of extremely low-income limits caps them at the very low-income levels.\n\nQ8. Why am I unable to access the FY 2023 Income Limits Documentation System using a prior year bookmark, or using the results of web search? Using links from these methods generally result in broken webpages.\n\nThe income limits documentation calculates median family incomes and income limits for each area of the country; therefore, certain parameters must be set for these calculations to be performed correctly. Please access the FY 2023 Income Limits Documentation System using this link: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2023_query.\n\nArea Definitions:\n\nQ9. Why do area definitions change for median incomes and income limits?\n\nHUD follows Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan areas with some exceptions. In 2006, when HUD implemented the widespread area definition changes OMB made based on the 2000 Decennial Census, exceptions were made to the new OMB area definitions when FMR or MFI changes for new areas were greater than five percent. HUD created exception subareas, called HUD Metro FMR Areas (HMFA), which continue to exist today.\n\nThe FY 2023 MFIs and income limits are based on new metropolitan area definitions, defined by OMB using commuting relationships from the Census, as updated through 2018. While HUD has maintained its HMFA subareas, there is no longer the five percent FMR or median income test; all counties added to metropolitan areas will be an HMFA with rents and incomes based on their own county data, where available. The disposition of all counties is shown in the Area Definitions report https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2023_data.\n\nQ10. What is the relationship between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas?\n\nWith minor exceptions, FMR areas and Income Limit areas are identical. HUD uses FMR areas in calculating income limits because FMRs are needed for the calculation of some income limits; specifically, to determine high and low housing cost adjustments. Also, the two sets of area definitions are linked in statutory history. The exception to the similarity between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas is Rockland County, NY. By statute, income limits are calculated for Rockland County, NY while separate FMRs are not.\n\nQ11. What does the term “HMFA” mean?\n\nHUD Metro FMR Area. This term indicates that only a portion of the OMB-defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is in the area to which the income limits (or FMRs) apply. HUD is required by OMB to alter the name of metropolitan geographic entities it derives from the MSAs when the geography is not the same as that established by OMB.\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs) (otherwise known as Low-Income Tax Credit projects (LIHTC) or tax-exempt bond-financed projects)\n\nQ12. What is the national non-metro median to be used to calculate the floor on rural LIHTC rents?\n\nSection 3004 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) specifies that any project for residential rental property located in a rural area (as defined in section 520 of the Housing Act of 1949) use the maximum of the area median gross income or the national non-metropolitan median income. The current year non-metropolitan median income and the 1-8 person 50-percent income limits based on the non-metropolitan median income are listed in the table available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il23/FY2023-National-Non-Met-Very-Low-Income-Limits.xlsx.\n\nQ13. What are Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects?\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs), a term used by HUD, are all Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and multifamily projects funded by tax-exempt bonds under Section 142 (which generally also benefit from LIHTC). These projects may have special income limits established by statute so HUD publishes them on a separate webpage. If you are a tax credit developer or resident in an MTSP, please go to the following site to determine what the appropriate income limits are, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html.\n\nQ14. How can 60 percent income limits be calculated?\n\nFor the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, users should refer to the FY 2023 Multifamily Tax Subsidy Project income limits available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html. The formula used to compute these income limits is as follows: take 120 percent of the Very Low-Income Limit. Do not calculate income limit percentages based on a direct arithmetic relationship with the median family income; there are too many exceptions made to the arithmetic rule in computing income limits.\n\nQ15. How are maximum rents for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects computed from the very low-income limits?\n\nPlease consult with the state housing financing agency that governs the tax credit project in question for a determination of official maximum rental rates. A list of state housing finance agencies can be found at https://lihtc.huduser.gov/agency_list.htm. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is a U.S. Treasury Department program; therefore, HUD has no official authority over setting maximum rental rates. The following table is included for informational purposes only.\n\nThe imputed income limitation (as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42(g)(2)) is 60 percent of the median income. A rent may not exceed 30 percent of this imputed income limitation under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42(g)(2). Unit rents by number of bedrooms are derived from Very Low-Income Limits (VLILs) for the different household sizes according to the following table:\n\nLIHTC Maximum Rent Derivation from HUD Very Low-Income Limits (VLILs)\n\nUnit Size 0 Bedroom 1 Bedroom 2 Bedroom 3 Bedroom 4 Bedroom 50% MFI Unit Maximum Monthly Rent is 1/12 of 30% of: 1-Person VLIL (1-Person VLIL + 2-Person VLIL)/2 3-Person VLIL (4-Person VLIL + 5-Person VLIL)/2 6-Person VLIL 60% MFI Unit Maximum Monthly Rent is 1/12 of 30% of: 120% of 1-Person VLIL 120% of [(1-Person VLIL + 2-Person VLIL)/2] 120% of 3-Person VLIL 120% of [(4-Person VLIL + 5-Person VLIL)/2] 120% of 6-Person VLIL\n\nNOTE: Maximum rents for larger units are set by assuming an additional 1.5 persons per bedroom.\n\nQuery Tool\n\nDocuments\n\nData\n\nFAQs\n\nPuerto Rico FAQs\n\nEffective April 18, 2022.\n\nAccess Individual Income Limits Areas\n\nThis system provides complete documentation of the development of the FY 2022 Income Limits (ILs) for any area of the country selected by the user.

Is HUD raising rents on low-income tenants?\n\nThe potential impact of changing income limits varies based on the program. Many tenants in Federally-supported housing will see no impact because rents are directly tied to tenant incomes. For other programs, such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits, properties have their maximum allowed rents based on the income limits that HUD is mandated to publish. The Federal government has no control over how individual LIHTC landlords set rents within the prescribed range. HUD has not required or suggested rent increases. To the extent that owners increase rents, they should be minimal increases, phased in over time, and only to an extent consistent with maintaining financial feasibility of the property.\n\nQ2. Income limits have fallen in my area but haven’t done so in the past, why did this happen?\n\nBeginning with FY 2010 Income Limits, HUD eliminated its long standing “hold harmless” policy. HUD’s “hold harmless” policy sustained Section 8 income limits for certain areas at previously published levels when reductions would otherwise have resulted from changes in median family incomes, housing cost adjustment data, median income update methodology, income limit methodology, or metropolitan area definitions. HUD eliminated the “hold harmless” policy to ensure better alignment between an area’s most recent income experience and the income thresholds for housing assistance.\n\nFurthermore, in an effort to minimize disruptions in the operation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, HUD instituted maximum thresholds for the amount income limits can change from year to year. The new policy limits annual increases in income limits to 5 percent or twice the change in the national median family income as measured by the American Community Survey, whichever is greater. For the FY 2022 income limits, the cap is approximately 11.89 percent. For areas where income limits are decreasing, HUD limits the decrease to no more than 5 percent per year.\n\nIncome Limits for rural housing programs will continue their current hold-harmless policy at the request of the Rural Housing Service, because these limits are based on area definitions and program rules specified by the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. Income-based rents used in the HOME Investment Partnerships program (HOME) will also be held harmless.\n\nQ3. Why don’t the income limits for my area reflect recent gains (or losses)?\n\nAlthough HUD uses the most recent data available concerning local area incomes, there is still a lag between when the data are collected and when the data are available for use. For example, FY 2022 Income Limits are calculated using 2015-2019 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data, and one-year 2019 data where possible. This is a three-year lag, so more current trends in median family income levels are not available.\n\nQ4. What is the difference between HUD’s Median Family Income (MFI) and Area Median Income (AMI)?\n\nHUD estimates Median Family Income (MFI) annually for each metropolitan area and non-metropolitan county. The metropolitan area definitions are the same ones HUD uses for Fair Market Rents (except where statute requires a different configuration). HUD calculates Income Limits as a function of the area's Median Family Income (MFI). The basis for HUD’s median family incomes is data from the American Community Survey, table B19113 - MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS.\n\nThe term Area Median Income is the term used more generally in the affordable housing industry. If the term Area Median Income (AMI) is used in an unqualified manner, this reference is synonymous with HUD's MFI. However, if the term AMI is qualified in some way - generally percentages of AMI, or AMI adjusted for family size, then this is a reference to HUD's income limits, which are calculated as percentages of median incomes and include adjustments for families of different sizes.\n\nQ5. Why does my very low-income limit not equal 50% of my median family income (or my low-income limit not equal 80% of my median income)?\n\nThere are many exceptions to the arithmetic calculation of income limits. These include adjustments for high housing cost relative to income, the application of state nonmetropolitan income limits in low-income areas, and national maximums in high-income areas. These exceptions are detailed in the FY 2022 Income Limits Methodology Document, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2022_data. Please also note that Tables 1 and 2 (beginning on page 5) show that most nonmetropolitan area income limits are based on state nonmetropolitan area medians.\n\nFor further information on the exact adjustments made to an individual area of the country, please see our FY 2022 Income Limits Documentation System. The documentation system is available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2022_query. Once the area in question is selected, a summary of the area’s median income, Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-Income Limits are displayed. Detailed calculations are obtained by selecting the relevant links.\n\nQ6. Why is the Extremely Low-Income Limit much higher than in the past and sometimes no different than the Very Low-Income Limit?\n\nThe Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 established a new income limit standard based on 30 percent of median family income (the extremely low-income limits), which was to be adjusted for family size and for areas of unusually high or low family income.

They are then compared to the appropriate poverty guideline and if the poverty guideline is higher, that value is chosen. If the poverty guideline is above the very low-income limit at that family size, the extremely low-income limit is set at the very low-income limit because the definition of extremely low-income limits caps them at the very low-income levels.\n\nQ7. Why am I unable to access the FY 2022 Income Limits Documentation System using a prior year bookmark, or using the results of web search? Using links from these methods generally result in broken webpages.\n\nThe income limits documentation calculates median family incomes and income limits for each area of the country; therefore, certain parameters must be set for these calculations to be performed correctly. Please access the FY 2022 Income Limits Documentation System using this link: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2022_query\n\nMedian Family Incomes\n\nQ8. How does HUD calculate median family incomes?\n\nTo calculate the FY 2022 median incomes, HUD uses 2019 ACS or PRCS median family incomes as the basis for FY 2022 medians for all areas designated as Fair Market Rent areas in the US and Puerto Rico. For an ACS estimate to be considered statistically valid, the estimate must have a margin of error less than half the size of the estimate and the estimate must be based on at least 100 observations. In areas where there is a statistically valid survey estimate using 2019 one-year ACS or PRCS data, that is used. If not, statistically valid 2019 five-year data is used. Where statistically valid five-year data is not available, HUD will average the minimally statistically valid income estimates from the previous three years of ACS or PRCS data. Minimal statistical validity is defined as those ACS estimates where the margin of error of the estimate is less than half the size of the estimate. ACS data from 2019, 2018, and 2017 will be evaluated to determine if it is minimally statistically valid. HUD averages the minimally statistically valid 5-year data which is adjusted to 2019 dollars using the national change in CPI between the ACS year of the data and 2019. For all places in the US and Puerto Rico: All estimates (using either one-year data or five-year data) are then inflated from 2019 to February 2022 using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nFor additional details concerning the use of the ACS in HUD’s calculations of MFI, please see our FY 2022 Median Family Income methodology document, at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2021_data.\n\nAdditionally, full documentation of all calculations for Median Family Incomes are available in the FY 2022 Median Family Income and the FY 2022 Income Limits Documentation System. These systems are available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2022_query.\n\nArea Definitions:\n\nQ9. Why do area definitions change for median incomes and income limits?\n\nHUD follows Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan areas with some exceptions. In 2006, when HUD implemented the widespread area definition changes OMB made based on the 2000 Decennial Census, exceptions were made to the new OMB area definitions when FMR or MFI changes for new areas were greater than five percent. HUD created exception subareas, called HUD Metro FMR Areas (HMFA), which continue to exist today.\n\nThe FY 2022 MFIs and income limits are based on new metropolitan area definitions, defined by OMB using commuting relationships from the 2010 Decennial Census, as updated through 2018. While HUD has maintained its HMFA subareas, there is no longer the five percent FMR or median income test; all counties added to metropolitan areas will be an HMFA with rents and incomes based on their own county data, where available. The disposition of all counties is shown in the Area Definitions report https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2022_data.\n\nQ10. What is the relationship between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas?\n\nWith minor exceptions, FMR areas and Income Limit areas are identical. HUD uses FMR areas in calculating income limits because FMRs are needed for the calculation of some income limits; specifically, to determine high and low housing cost adjustments. Also, the two sets of area definitions are linked in statutory history. The exception to the similarity between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas is Rockland County, NY. By statute, income limits are calculated for Rockland County, NY while separate FMRs are not.\n\nQ11. What does the term “HMFA” mean?\n\nHUD Metro FMR Area. This term indicates that only a portion of the OMB-defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is in the area to which the income limits (or FMRs) apply. HUD is required by OMB to alter the name of metropolitan geographic entities it derives from the MSAs when the geography is not the same as that established by OMB.\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs) (otherwise known as Low-Income Tax Credit projects (LIHTC) or tax-exempt bond-financed projects)\n\nQ12. What is the national non-metro median to be used to calculate the floor on rural LIHTC rents?\n\nSection 3004 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) specifies that any project for residential rental property located in a rural area (as defined in section 520 of the Housing Act of 1949) use the maximum of the area median gross income or the national non-metropolitan median income. The FY 2022 non-metropolitan median income is: $71,300 and the 1-8 person 50-percent income limits based on the non-metropolitan median income are listed below:\n\nStatewide Income Limits For U.S. Non-Metropolitan Total\n\nFY 2022 Very Low-Income (50%) Limit (VLIL)\n\nMedian Family Income 1 Person 2 Person 3 Person 4 Person 5 Person 6 Person 7 Person 8 Person $71,300 $24,950 $28,500 $32,100 $35,650 $38,500 $41,350 $44,200 47,050\n\nQ13. What are Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects?\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs), a term coined by HUD, are all Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and multifamily projects funded by tax-exempt bonds under Section 142 (which generally also benefit from LIHTC). These projects may have special income limits established by statute so HUD publishes them on a separate webpage. If you are a tax credit developer or resident in an MTSP, please go to the following site to determine what the appropriate income limits are, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html.\n\nQ14. How can 60 percent income limits be calculated?\n\nFor the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, users should refer to the FY 2022 Multifamily Tax Subsidy Project income limits available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html. The formula used to compute these income limits is as follows: take 120 percent of the Very Low-Income Limit. Do not calculate income limit percentages based on a direct arithmetic relationship with the median family income; there are too many exceptions made to the arithmetic rule in computing income limits.\n\nQ15. How are maximum rents for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects computed from the very low-income limits?\n\nPlease consult with the state housing financing agency that governs the tax credit project in question for a determination of official maximum rental rates. A list of state housing finance agencies can be found at https://lihtc.huduser.gov/agency_list.htm. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is a U.S. Treasury Department program; therefore, HUD has no official authority over setting maximum rental rates. The following table is included for informational purposes only.\n\nThe imputed income limitation (as defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42(g)(2)) is 60 percent of the median income. A rent may not exceed 30 percent of this imputed income limitation under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 42(g)(2). Unit rents by number of bedrooms are derived from Very Low-Income Limits (VLILs) for the different household sizes according to the following table:\n\nLIHTC Maximum Rent Derivation from HUD Very Low-Income Limits (VLILs)\n\nUnit Size 0 Bedroom 1 Bedroom 2 Bedroom 3 Bedroom 4 Bedroom 50% MFI Unit Maximum Monthly Rent is 1/12 of 30% of: 1-Person VLIL (1-Person VLIL + 2-Person VLIL)/2 3-Person VLIL (4-Person VLIL + 5-Person VLIL)/2 6-Person VLIL 60% MFI Unit Maximum Monthly Rent is 1/12 of 30% of: 120% of 1-Person VLIL 120 % of [(1-Person VLIL + 2-Person VLIL)/2] 120% of 3-Person VLIL 120% of [(4-Person VLIL + 5-Person VLIL)/2] 120% of 6-Person VLIL\n\nNOTE: Maximum rents for larger units are set by assuming an additional 1.5 persons per bedroom.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions Puerto Rico Income Limits\n\nPreguntas frecuentes sobre los límites de ingreso para Puerto Rico\n\nPublic Engagement Session Puerto Rico Income Limits Video\n\nQuery Tool\n\nData\n\nFAQs\n\nEffective April 1, 2021.\n\nAccess Individual Income Limits Areas\n\nThis system provides complete documentation of the development of the FY 2021 Income Limits (ILs) for any area of the country selected by the user.

I live in a Low-Income Housing Tax Credit property and have been informed that my rent is increasing based on the publication of HUD Income Limits. Is HUD requiring or suggesting rent increases?\n\nNo. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Pursuant to an IRS revenue ruling, participating properties base their rents on the income limits that HUD is mandated to publish. However, HUD has no control over how LIHTC rents are set and has not required or suggested rent increases. HUD continues to encourage property owners to exercise compassion with respect to tenants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and would be surprised that an owner would be so out of step with the moment in which we are living to raise rents at this time.\n\nIncome Limits\n\nQ2. Income limits have fallen in my area but haven’t done so in the past, why did this happen?\n\nBeginning with FY 2010 Income Limits, HUD eliminated its long standing “hold harmless” policy. HUD’s “hold harmless” policy sustained Section 8 income limits for certain areas at previously published levels when reductions would otherwise have resulted from changes in median family incomes, housing cost adjustment data, median income update methodology, income limit methodology, or metropolitan area definitions. HUD eliminated the “hold harmless” policy to ensure better alignment between an area’s most recent income experience and the income thresholds for housing assistance.\n\nFurthermore, in an effort to minimize disruptions in the operation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, HUD instituted maximum thresholds for the amount income limits can change from year to year. The new policy limits annual increases in income limits to 5 percent or twice the change in the national median family income, whichever is greater. For the FY 2021 income limits, the cap is almost 5 percent. For areas where income limits are decreasing, HUD limits the decrease to no more than 5 percent per year.\n\nIncome Limits for rural housing programs will continue their current hold-harmless policy at the request of the Rural Housing Service, because these limits are based on area definitions and program rules specified by the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. Income-based rents used in the HOME Investment Partnerships program (HOME) will also be held harmless.\n\nQ3. Why don’t the income limits for my area reflect recent gains (or losses)?\n\nAlthough HUD uses the most recent data available concerning local area incomes, there is still a lag between when the data are collected and when the data are available for use. For example, FY 2021 Income Limits are calculated using 2014-2018 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data, and one-year 2017 data where possible. This is a two-year lag, so more current trends in median family income levels are not available.\n\nQ4. What is the difference between HUD’s Median Family Income (MFI) and Area Median Income (AMI)?\n\nHUD estimates Median Family Income (MFI) annually for each metropolitan area and non-metropolitan county. The metropolitan area definitions are the same ones HUD uses for Fair Market Rents (except where statute requires a different configuration). HUD calculates Income Limits as a function of the area's Median Family Income (MFI). The basis for HUD’s median family incomes is data from the American Community Survey, table B19113 - MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS.\n\nThe term Area Median Income is the term used more generally in the industry. If the term Area Median Income (AMI) is used in an unqualified manor, this reference is synonymous with HUD's MFI. However, if the term AMI is qualified in some way - generally percentages of AMI, or AMI adjusted for family size, then this is a reference to HUD's income limits, which are calculated as percentages of median incomes and include adjustments for families of different sizes.\n\nQ5. Why does my very low-income limit not equal 50% of my median family income (or my low-income limit not equal 80% of my median income)?\n\nThere are many exceptions to the arithmetic calculation of income limits. These include adjustments for high housing cost relative to income, the application of state nonmetropolitan income limits in low-income areas, and national maximums in high-income areas. These exceptions are detailed in the FY 2021 Income Limits Methodology Document, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2021_data. Please also note that Tables 1 and 2 (beginning on page 5) show that most nonmetropolitan area income limits are based on state nonmetropolitan area medians.\n\nFor further information on the exact adjustments made to an individual area of the country, please see our FY 2021 Income Limits Documentation System. The documentation system is available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2021_query. Once the area in question is selected, a summary of the area’s median income, Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-Income Limits are displayed. Detailed calculations are obtained by selecting the relevant links.\n\nQ6. Why is the Extremely Low-Income Limit much higher than in the past and sometimes no different than the Very Low-Income Limit?\n\nThe Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 established a new income limit standard based on 30 percent of median family income (the extremely low-income limits), which was to be adjusted for family size and for areas of unusually high or low family income. A statutory change was made in 1999 to clarify that these income limits should be tied to the Section 8 very low-income limits.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 further modified and redefined these limits as Extremely Low Family income limits to ensure that these income limits would not fall below the poverty guidelines determined for each family size. Specifically, extremely low-income families are defined to be very low-income families whose incomes are the greater of the Poverty Guidelines as published and periodically updated by the Department of Health and Human Services or the 30 percent income limits calculated by HUD. Puerto Rico and other territories are specifically excluded from this adjustment. There are separate poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii. The remaining 48 states and the District of Columbia use the same poverty guidelines. The extremely low-income limits therefore are first calculated as 30/50ths (60 percent) of the Section 8 very low-income limits. They are then compared to the appropriate poverty guideline and if the poverty guideline is higher, that value is chosen. If the poverty guideline is above the very low-income limit at that family size, the extremely low-income limit is set at the very low-income limit because the definition of extremely low-income limits caps them at the very low-income levels.\n\nQ7. Why am I unable to access the FY 2021 Income Limits Documentation System using a prior year bookmark, or using the results of web search? Using links from these methods generally result in broken webpages.\n\nThe income limits documentation calculates median family incomes and income limits for each area of the country; therefore, certain parameters must be set for these calculations to be performed correctly. Please access the FY 2021 Income Limits Documentation System using this link: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2021_query\n\nMedian Family Incomes\n\nQ8. How does HUD calculate median family incomes?\n\nTo calculate the FY 2021 median incomes, HUD uses 2018 ACS or PRCS median family incomes as the basis for FY 2020 medians for all areas designated as Fair Market Rent areas in the US and Puerto Rico. For FY 2021, HUD has updated its definition of statistical validity for ACS data. For an ACS estimate to be considered statistically valid, the estimate must have a margin of error less than half the size of the estimate and the estimate must be based on at least 100 observations. In areas where there is a statistically valid survey estimate using 2018 one-year ACS or PRCS data, that is used. If not, statistically valid 2018 five-year data is used. Where statistically valid five-year data is not available, HUD will average the minimally statistically valid income estimates from the previous three years of ACS or PRCS data. Minimal statistical validity is defined as those ACS estimates where the margin of error of the estimate is less than half the size of the estimate. ACS data from 2018, 2017, and 2016 will be evaluated to determine if it is minimally statistically valid. HUD averages the minimally statistically valid 5-year data which is adjusted to 2018 dollars using the national change in CPI between the ACS year of the data and 2018. For all places in the US and Puerto Rico: All estimates (using either one-year data or five-year data) are then trended from 2018 to the midpoint of FY 2021.\n\nA Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast as published by the Congressional Budget Office is used in the trend factor calculation to bring the 2018 ACS data forward to the middle of FY 2021.\n\nFor additional details concerning the use of the ACS in HUD’s calculations of MFI, please see our FY 2021 Median Family Income methodology document, at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2021_data.\n\nAdditionally, full documentation of all calculations for Median Family Incomes are available in the FY 2021 Median Family Income and the FY 2021 Income Limits Documentation System. These systems are available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2021_query.\n\nArea Definitions:\n\nQ9.

Also, the two sets of area definitions are linked in statutory history. The exception to the similarity between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas is Rockland County, NY. By statute, income limits are calculated for Rockland County, NY while separate FMRs are not.\n\nQ11. What does the term “HMFA” mean?\n\nHUD Metro FMR Area. This term indicates that only a portion of the OMB-defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is in the area to which the income limits (or FMRs) apply. HUD is required by OMB to alter the name of metropolitan geographic entities it derives from the MSAs when the geography is not the same as that established by OMB.\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs) (otherwise known as Low-Income Tax Credit projects (LIHTC) or tax-exempt bond-financed projects)\n\nQ12.

Pursuant to an IRS revenue ruling, participating properties base their rents on the income limits that HUD is mandated to publish.

Income limits have fallen in my area but haven’t done so in the past, why did this happen?\n\nBeginning with FY 2010 Income Limits, HUD eliminated its long standing “hold harmless” policy. HUD’s “hold harmless” policy sustained Section 8 income limits for certain areas at previously published levels when reductions would otherwise have resulted from changes in median family incomes, housing cost adjustment data, median income update methodology, income limit methodology, or metropolitan area definitions. HUD eliminated the “hold harmless” policy to ensure better alignment between an area’s most recent income experience and the income thresholds for housing assistance.\n\nFurthermore, in an effort to minimize disruptions in the operation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, HUD instituted maximum thresholds for the amount income limits can change from year to year. The new policy limits annual increases in income limits to 5 percent or twice the change in the national median family income, whichever is greater. For the FY 2020 income limits, the cap is almost 8 percent. For areas where income limits are decreasing, HUD limits the decrease to no more than 5 percent per year.\n\nIncome Limits for rural housing programs will continue their current hold-harmless policy at the request of the Rural Housing Service, because these limits are based on area definitions and program rules specified by the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. Income-based rents used in the HOME Investment Partnerships program (HOME) will also be held harmless.\n\nQ2. Why don’t the income limits for my area reflect recent gains (or losses)?\n\nAlthough HUD uses the most recent data available concerning local area incomes, there is still a lag between when the data are collected and when the data are available for use. For example, FY 2020 Income Limits are calculated using 2013-2017 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data, and one-year 2017 data where possible. This is a two-year lag, so more current trends in median family income levels are not available.\n\nQ3. What is the difference between HUD’s Median Family Income (MFI) and Area Median Income (AMI)?\n\nHUD estimates Median Family Income (MFI) annually for each metropolitan area and non-metropolitan county. The metropolitan area definitions are the same ones HUD uses for Fair Market Rents (except where statute requires a different configuration). HUD calculates Income Limits as a function of the area's Median Family Income (MFI). The basis for HUD’s median family incomes is data from the American Community Survey, table B19113 - MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS.\n\nThe term Area Median Income is the term used more generally in the industry. If the term Area Median Income (AMI) is used in an unqualified manor, this reference is synonymous with HUD's MFI. However, if the term AMI is qualified in some way - generally percentages of AMI, or AMI adjusted for family size, then this is a reference to HUD's income limits, which are calculated as percentages of median incomes and include adjustments for families of different sizes.\n\nQ4. Why does my very low-income limit not equal 50% of my median family income (or my low-income limit not equal 80% of my median income)?\n\nThere are many exceptions to the arithmetic calculation of income limits. These include adjustments for high housing cost relative to income, the application of state nonmetropolitan income limits in low-income areas, and national maximums in high-income areas. These exceptions are detailed in the FY 2020 Income Limits Methodology Document, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#data_2020. Please also note that Tables 1 and 2 (beginning on page 5) show that most nonmetropolitan area income limits are based on state nonmetropolitan area medians.\n\nFor further information on the exact adjustments made to an individual area of the country, please see our FY 2020 Income Limits Documentation System. The documentation system is available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2020_query. Once the area in question is selected, a summary of the area’s median income, Very Low-Income, Extremely Low-Income, and Low-Income Limits are displayed. Detailed calculations are obtained by selecting the relevant links.\n\nQ5. Why is the Extremely Low-Income Limit much higher than in the past and sometimes no different than the Very Low-Income Limit?\n\nThe Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 established a new income limit standard based on 30 percent of median family income (the extremely low-income limits), which was to be adjusted for family size and for areas of unusually high or low family income. A statutory change was made in 1999 to clarify that these income limits should be tied to the Section 8 very low-income limits.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 further modified and redefined these limits as Extremely Low Family income limits to ensure that these income limits would not fall below the poverty guidelines determined for each family size. Specifically, extremely low-income families are defined to be very low-income families whose incomes are the greater of the Poverty Guidelines as published and periodically updated by the Department of Health and Human Services or the 30 percent income limits calculated by HUD. Puerto Rico and other territories are specifically excluded from this adjustment. There are separate poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii. The remaining 48 states and the District of Columbia use the same poverty guidelines. The extremely low-income limits therefore are first calculated as 30/50ths (60 percent) of the Section 8 very low-income limits. They are then compared to the appropriate poverty guideline and if the poverty guideline is higher, that value is chosen. If the poverty guideline is above the very low-income limit at that family size, the extremely low-income limit is set at the very low-income limit because the definition of extremely low-income limits caps them at the very low-income levels.\n\nQ6. Why am I unable to access the FY 2020 Income Limits Documentation System using a prior year bookmark, or using the results of web search? Using links from these methods generally result in broken webpages.\n\nThe income limits documentation calculates median family incomes and income limits for each area of the country; therefore, certain parameters must be set for these calculations to be performed correctly. Please access the FY 2020 Income Limits Documentation System using this link: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2020_query\n\nMedian Family Incomes\n\nQ7. How does HUD calculate median family incomes?\n\nTo calculate the FY 2020 median incomes, HUD uses 2017 ACS or PRCS median family incomes as the basis for FY 2020 medians for all areas designated as Fair Market Rent areas in the US and Puerto Rico. For FY 2020, HUD has updated its definition of statistical validity for ACS data. For an ACS estimate to be considered statistically valid, the estimate must have a margin of error less than half the size of the estimate and the estimate must be based on at least 100 observations. In areas where there is a statistically valid survey estimate using 2017 one-year ACS or PRCS data, that is used. If not, statistically valid 2017 five-year data is used. Where statistically valid five-year data is not available, HUD will average the minimally statistically valid income estimates from the previous three years of ACS or PRCS data. Minimal statistical validity is defined as those ACS estimates where the margin of error of the estimate is less than half the size of the estimate. ACS data from 2017, 2016, and 2015 will be evaluated to determine if it is minimally statistically valid. HUD averages the minimally statistically valid 5-year data which is adjusted to 2017 dollars using the national change in CPI between the ACS year of the data and 2017. For all places in the US and Puerto Rico: All estimates (using either one-year data or five-year data) are then trended from 2017 to the midpoint of FY 2020.\n\nA Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast as published by the Congressional Budget Office is used in the trend factor calculation to bring the 2017 ACS data forward to the middle of FY 2020.\n\nFor additional details concerning the use of the ACS in HUD’s calculations of MFI, please see our FY 2020 Median Family Income methodology document, at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2020_data.\n\nAdditionally, full documentation of all calculations for Median Family Incomes are available in the FY 2020 Median Family Income and the FY 2020 Income Limits Documentation System. These systems are available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2020_query.\n\nArea Definitions:\n\nQ8. Why do area definitions change for median incomes and income limits?\n\nHUD follows Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of metropolitan areas with some exceptions. In 2006, when HUD implemented the widespread area definition changes OMB made based on the 2000 Decennial Census, exceptions were made to the new OMB area definitions when FMR or MFI changes for new areas were greater than five percent. HUD created exception subareas, called HUD Metro FMR Areas (HMFA), which continue to exist today.\n\nThe FY 2020 MFIs and income limits are based on new metropolitan area definitions, defined by OMB using commuting relationships from the 2010 Decennial Census, as updated through 2017. While HUD has maintained its HMFA subareas, there is no longer the five percent FMR or median income test; all counties added to metropolitan areas will be an HMFA with rents and incomes based on their own county data, where available. The disposition of all counties is shown in the Area Definitions report https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2020_data.\n\nQ9. What is the relationship between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas?\n\nWith minor exceptions, FMR areas and Income Limit areas are identical. HUD uses FMR areas in calculating income limits because FMRs (or 40th percentile rents for 50th percentile FMR areas) are needed for the calculation of some income limits; specifically, to determine high and low housing cost adjustments. Also, the two sets of area definitions are linked in statutory history. The exception to the similarity between Fair Market Rent areas and Income Limit areas is Rockland County, NY. By statute, income limits are calculated for Rockland County, NY while separate FMRs are not.\n\nQ10. What does the term “HMFA” mean?\n\nHUD Metro FMR Area. This term indicates that only a portion of the OMB-defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is in the area to which the income limits (or FMRs) apply. HUD is required by OMB to alter the name of metropolitan geographic entities it derives from the MSAs when the geography is not the same as that established by OMB.\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs) (otherwise known as Low-Income Tax Credit projects (LIHTC) or tax-exempt bond-financed projects)\n\nQ11. What are Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects?\n\nMultifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSPs), a term coined by HUD, are all Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and multifamily projects funded by tax-exempt bonds under Section 142 (which generally also benefit from LIHTC). These projects may have special income limits established by statute so HUD publishes them on a separate webpage. If you are a tax credit developer or resident in an MTSP, please go to the following site to determine what the appropriate income limits are, https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html.\n\nQ12. How can 60 percent income limits be calculated?\n\nFor the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, users should refer to the FY 2020 Multifamily Tax Subsidy Project income limits available at https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/mtsp.html. The formula used to compute these income limits is as follows: take 120 percent of the Very Low-Income Limit. Do not calculate income limit percentages based on a direct arithmetic relationship with the median family income; there are too many exceptions made to the arithmetic rule in computing income limits.\n\nQ13. How are maximum rents for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects computed from the very low-income limits?\n\nPlease co"
