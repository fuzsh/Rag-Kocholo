Steven Byrne, East Lansdowne Officer Rob Meehan and Lansdowne Officer David Schiazza who carried the memorial wreath during the ceremony. Each man was shot in two separate incidents in February, Byrne in the later incident and Meehan and Schiazza in the earlier.\n\nByrne was shot after a police pursuit. He was investigating a drive-by shooting when he exchanged gunfire with a suspect, who was killed.\n\nMeehan and Schiazza were injured in the shootout part of the shootout and fire that resulted in six deaths in East Lansdowne, including the perpetrator.\n\n“That massacre that horrible day in East Lansdowne was also county law enforcement’s best day,” the DA added. “The police response, everybody working together regardless of their own personal safety.”\n\nStollsteimer said an uplifting aspect of the East Lansdowne tragedy was the silent majority of residents who reached out to him to say they were thankful for police officers and the officers were in their prayers.\n\n“They know for us to have a just society we need to have a component of law and order. It’s the only way it works,” Stollsteimer said. “And thank God there are many men and women like those … who keep answering the call of duty to serve our community.”\n\nStollsteimer lamented that the professional criminal class has access to firearms that sometimes outgun police. He also said there are too many people who have mental health issues who have access to weapons.\n\n“We need to do more as elected officials, as a community to stand up and make sure our officers have every single tool they need to protect us,” he said.\n\nStollsteimer said he is horrified to hear from officers how many guns are recovered from simple traffic stops and how that prevents another massacre.\n\nThe memorial foundation honored 47 fallen officers.\n\nFamily of fallen heroes, law enforcement officers from across Delaware County and their families and friends attended.\n\nThe service began with officers carrying individual uniform hats to the spot of each of the fallen officers, followed by a ceremonial “roll call” of the 47 names of the fallen officers that are displayed on the memorial wall.\n\nThe Rev. Perry Messick, the FOP chaplain, reminded those in attendance that the 47 and all police officers protect us from the forces of evil.\n\nDelaware County Council President Dr. Monica Taylor thanked officers and noted when each of them take a call they are risking their lives running towards danger.\n\n“You are truly heroes,” she said.\n\nOriginally Published: May 8, 2024 at 2:10 p.m."
