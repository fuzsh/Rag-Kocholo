        "text": "Symbol of Endurance and Valor\n\nThe most sacred part of the memorial is formed by its innermost granite retaining walls. Emblazoned in white on a sleek black stone, and facing the colonnade of conflicts, are the names of Veterans from Newtown Square who answered the call of duty. The names on those Delaware County men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice are engraved with their branch of service facing the flags of the United States of America and all branches of service. We honor these local heroes who served, fought, and died to defend us. Their valor, whether from the most extraordinary acts of unimaginable bravery of the simple heroism of everyday courage, is evident by their title – Veteran. It is on their shoulders that we stand.\n\nSymbol of Life and Peace\n\nCentral to the Memorial is the fountain with its flowing water symbolizing eternal life. It is here that we gather to keep the memory of our Veterans alive forever. In this place we honor them and by our presence we are restored. By the pool of still water, in moments of quiet reflection, the soul can find serenity and through that calmness a sense of renewed faith and peace.\n\nSymbol of Unity and Inclusion\n\nLocated between the Memorial and the Hall of Prayers is Statuary Circle. Currently contained within the circle is a life-size statue of The Battlefield Cross, a symbolic memorial marker erected on the battlefield or at the base camp for a soldier who has been killed. It is made up of the soldier’s rifle stuck into the ground or into the soldier’s boots, with helmet on top. The purpose of this marker is to show honor and respect for the dead at the battle site. It is dedicated to all who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. A bronze statue of Wild Bill Guarnere, a wounded WWII soldier made famous through the HBO miniseries, Band of Brothers, is also located in the circle. Wild Bill symbolizes the strength of all soldiers through their courage to serve and their strength to continue.\n\nSymbol of Strength and Perseverance\n\nThe Hall of Prayers is an open-air chapel designed to represent a fallen tree with its roots firmly planted in American soil. The structure represents the wounded warrior who will not fall or give up due to the support of their fellow troops and support from home. The interior of the Hall of Prayers contains 50 messages to Veterans from all 49 Delaware County Municipalities and Delaware County Council.\n\nSymbol of Thanks, Courage, and Remembrance\n\nThe gray granite “empty chair” monument is set in front of a black granite wall engraved with white lettering, the monument serves as a memorial to those who served our great Nation but have never returned and have been classified as Prisoners of War or Missing in Action."
