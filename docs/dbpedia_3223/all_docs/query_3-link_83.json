        "text": "About the Species\n\nHumpback whale breaching. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\n\nBefore a final moratorium on commercial whaling in 1985, all populations of humpback whales were greatly reduced, most by more than 95 percent. The species is increasing in abundance throughout much of its range but faces threats from entanglement in fishing gear, vessel strikes, vessel-based harassment, and underwater noise.\n\nHumpback whales live in all oceans around the world. They travel great distances every year and have one of the longest migrations of any mammal on the planet. Some populations swim 5,000 miles from tropical breeding grounds to colder, more productive feeding grounds. Humpback whales feed on shrimp-like crustaceans (krill) and small fish, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates, which act like a sieve.\n\nThe humpback whale gets its common name from the distinctive hump on its back. Its long pectoral fins inspired its scientific name, Megaptera, which means “big-winged” and novaeangliae, which means “New England,” in reference to the location where European whalers first encountered them. Humpback whales are a favorite of whale watchers―they are often active, jumping out of the water and slapping the surface with their pectoral fins or tails.\n\nNOAA Fisheries is dedicated to the conservation of humpback whales. Our scientists use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and disentangle humpback whales. We also work with our partners to ensure that regulations and management plans are in place to reduce entanglement in fishing gear, create safer shipping lanes, and protect habitats.\n\nPopulation Status\n\nCommercial whaling severely reduced humpback whale numbers from historical levels. The United States listed all humpback whales as endangered under the Endangered Species Conservation Act in 1970 and then under the Endangered Species Act in 1973. NOAA Fisheries worked worldwide to identify and apply protections for humpback whales. The International Whaling Commission’s final whaling moratorium on commercial harvest, in effect since 1985, played a major role in the recovery of humpback whales. Currently, four out of the 14 distinct population segments are still protected as endangered, and one is listed as threatened (81 FR 62259, September 2016). Three humpback whale stocks in U.S. waters are designated as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (see annual stock assessment report).\n\nAppearance\n\nHumpback whales’ bodies are primarily black, but individuals have different amounts of white on their pectoral fins, bellies, and the undersides of their flukes (tails). Southern Hemisphere humpback whales tend to have more white markings, particularly on their flanks and bellies than do Northern Hemisphere humpback whales.\n\nHumpback whale flukes can be up to 18 feet wide—they are serrated along the trailing edge, and pointed at the tips. Tail fluke pigmentation patterns, in combination with varying shapes and sizes of whales’ flukes and/or prominent scars, are unique to each animal. They are distinctive enough to be used as “fingerprints” to identify individuals.\n\nWhen photographed, scientists can often identify individual whales—a process called photo-identification - and catalog occurrences of individual whales and use this information to track them over time.\n\nBehavior and Diet\n\nHumpback whales are a favorite of whale-watchers, as they can be found close to shore and often display activities near the surface, such as breaching (jumping out of the water) or slapping the surface with their pectoral fins and tails.\n\nDuring the warmer months (and occasionally into cooler months), humpback whales spend most of their time feeding and building up fat stores (blubber) to sustain them throughout the winter. Humpback whales filter-feed on small crustaceans (mostly krill) and small fish. They use several techniques to help them herd, corral, and disorient prey and that can include using bubbles, sounds, the seafloor, and even their pectoral fins. One specific feeding method, called \"group coordinated bubble net feeding,\" involves using curtains of air bubbles to condense prey. Once the fish are corralled, they are pushed toward the surface and engulfed as the whales lunge upward through the circular bubble net. Different groups of humpback whales use other bubble structures in similar ways, though there appears to be some regional specialization in bubble-feeding behaviors among populations.\n\nWhere They Live\n\nHumpback whales live throughout the world's major oceans. They can travel great distances during their seasonal migration with some animals migrating 5,000 miles between high-latitude summer feeding grounds and winter mating and calving areas in tropical waters. In the North Pacific, some humpback whales migrate from Alaska to Hawaiߵi—they can complete the 3,000 mile trip in as few as 28 days. While calving, they prefer shallow, warm waters commonly near offshore reef systems or shores. Humpback whale feeding grounds are generally in cold, productive waters.\n\nAt least four humpback whale populations occur in the North Pacific:\n\nMexico population\n\nBreeds along the Pacific coast of Mexico and the Revillagigedo Islands\n\nTransits the Baja California Peninsula\n\nFeeds across a broad range from California to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska\n\nCentral America population\n\nBreeds along the Pacific coast of Central America, including off Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua\n\nFeeds off the West Coast of the United States and southern British Columbia\n\nHawaiߵi population\n\nBreeds in the main Hawaiian Islands\n\nFeeds in most of the known feeding grounds in the North Pacific, including the Aleutian Islands/ Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Southeast Alaska, and northern British Columbia\n\nWestern North Pacific population\n\nBreeds in the areas of Okinawa, Japan, and the Philippines\n\nFeeds in the northern Pacific, primarily in the West Bering Sea and off the Russian coast and the Aleutian Islands\n\nAlso evidence for the existence of a lesser-known breeding area in the western North Pacific\n\nIn the North Atlantic, two populations of humpback whales feed during spring, summer, and fall throughout a range that extends across the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Maine to Norway. These two populations migrate south during the winter to calve and mate in the West Indies and Cape Verde (off the coast of Africa), and possibly in other areas.\n\nSeven populations of humpback whales are found in the Southern Hemisphere, all of which feed in Antarctic or sub-Antarctic waters.\n\nLifespan & Reproduction\n\nHumpback whales reach sexual maturity between the ages of 4 and 10 years. Females produce a single calf every 2 to 3 years on average, although annual calving has been documented in some individuals. Calves are born after an 11-month gestation and measure about 13 to 16 feet in length. Calves stay near their mothers for up to 1 year before weaning. Mothers are protective of their calves, swimming closely and often touching them with their flippers. While calves are not believed to maintain long-term associations with their mothers, they are more likely to be found in the same feeding and breeding areas as their mothers.\n\nThreats\n\nVessel Strikes\n\nInadvertent vessel strikes can injure or kill humpback whales. Humpback whales are vulnerable to vessel strikes throughout their range, but the risk is much higher in coastal areas with heavier ship traffic.\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe impacts of climate change on whales are unknown, but it is considered one of the largest threats facing high latitude regions where many humpback whales forage. Most notably, the timing and distribution of sea ice coverage is changing dramatically with altered oceanographic conditions. Any resulting changes in prey distribution could lead to changes in foraging behavior, nutritional stress, and diminished reproduction for humpback whales. Additionally, changing water temperature and currents could impact the timing of environmental cues important for navigation and migration.\n\nEntanglement in Fishing Gear\n\nHumpback whales can become entangled by many different gear types, including moorings, traps, pots, or gillnets. Once entangled, if they are able to move the gear, the whale may drag and swim with attached gear for long distances, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury, which may lead to reduced reproductive success or even death. There is evidence to suggest that most humpback whales experience entanglement over the course of their lives but are often able to shed the gear on their own. However, the portion of whales that become entangled and do not survive is unknown.\n\nVessel-Based Harassment\n\nWhale watching vessels, recreational boats, and other vessels may cause stress and behavioral changes in humpback whales. Because humpback whales are often found close to shore and generally surface in an active state, they tend to be popular whale watching attractions. There are several areas within the United States where humpback whales are the central attraction for the whale watching industry, including the Gulf of Maine (particularly within the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary), California, Alaska (particularly southeast Alaska), and the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nScientific Classification\n\nKingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Cetacea Family Balaenopteridae Genus Megaptera Species novaeangliae\n\nRecovery Actions\n\nUnder the ESA, NOAA Fisheries is required to develop and implement recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species. NOAA Fisheries originally developed a recovery plan in 1991 to identify actions that would advance the recovery of the global species and protect its habitats. The ultimate goal of the 1991 Humpback Whale Recovery Plan is to help humpback whales thrive, allowing the species to be reclassified from “endangered” to “threatened,” and ultimately removed from the ESA's list of threatened and endangered species.\n\nThe major actions recommended in the existing species-wide recovery plan are:\n\nReduce or eliminate injury and mortality caused by fisheries, fishing gear, and vessel collisions\n\nMinimize effects of vessel disturbance\n\nContinue the international moratorium on commercial whaling\n\nCollect as much data as possible from dead whales through our Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Program\n\nFollowing the 2016 change in the listing status of humpback whales, NOAA Fisheries determined in 2019 that recovery plans would not promote the conservation of the endangered Arabian Sea and the Cape Verde Islands/Northwest Africa DPSs. We are currently developing an updated, DPS-specific recovery plan for the ESA-listed Central America, Mexico, and Western North Pacific DPSs. In the interim, the recovery strategy for these DPSs will be guided by the existing species-wide plan and a new DPS-specific recovery outline.\n\nRead the recovery plan for the humpback whale\n\nImplementation\n\nTogether with our partners, we undertake numerous activities to support the directives of the humpback whale recovery plan, protect humpbacks, and reduce adverse impacts from human activities.\n\nEfforts to implement recovery for humpback whales include:\n\nCreating marine protected areas for humpback whales\n\nMinimizing vessel disturbance\n\nReducing entanglement in fishing gear\n\nReducing vessel strikes\n\nUnderstanding and addressing the effects of ocean noise\n\nCollaborating with the Commission on Environmental Cooperation to develop the North America Humpback Whale Conservation Action Plan for the United States, Canada, and Mexico\n\nMonitoring Plan\n\nNOAA Fisheries collaborated with state and federal agencies to create a monitoring plan for the nine distinct population segments of humpback whales that have recovered and are no longer protected under the ESA. Recently, NOAA Fisheries convened a post-delisting monitoring plan group (PDMP working group) to assemble, review, and discuss any updated data on the nine distinct population segments of humpback whales that no longer meet the definition of a threatened or endangered species and are no longer protected under the ESA. An interim report for the post delisting monitoring plan was published in 2022.\n\nCritical Habitat\n\nAlthough the original listing of this species predated the requirement for critical habitat designations, the 2016 revision to the humpback whale listing under the ESA triggered the requirement for NOAA Fisheries to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable. A proposed rule to designate critical habitat for the Central America, Mexico, and Western North Pacific DPSs of humpback whales was published in 2019 and a final rule was published on April 21, 2021.\n\nLearn more about the critical habitat designation\n\nDesignating Marine Protected Areas for Humpback Whales\n\nIn 1992, the U.S. Congress created the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary to protect humpback whales and their habitat around Hawaii. NOAA Fisheries co-manages the sanctuary with the State of Hawaiߵi, conducts research on humpback whales, and operates a sanctuary education and learning center.\n\nNOAA Fisheries and the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources have established the world’s first sister sanctuaries to protect humpback whales. The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Massachusetts, and the Santuario de Mamíferos Marinos de la República Dominicana are two marine protected areas 3,000 miles apart. Around 900 humpbacks spend spring and summer in the rich feeding grounds of Stellwagen Bank before they head south in the late fall to mate and give birth in the warmer waters of the Dominican Republic. The sister sanctuary agreement strengthens coordination and management efforts between the two sanctuaries and improves humpback whale recovery in the North Atlantic.\n\nMinimizing Whale Watching Harassment\n\nNOAA Fisheries supports responsible viewing of marine mammals in the wild and has adopted a guideline to observe all large whales from a safe distance of at least 100 yards by sea or land in all areas. In addition, federal approach regulations for humpback whales in Alaska and Hawaii require, with limited exceptions, that you:\n\nNot approach within 100 yards of a humpback whale\n\nNot place your vessel in the path of oncoming humpback whales, causing them to surface within 100 yards of your vessel\n\nNot disrupt the normal behavior or prior activity of a humpback whale\n\nOperate your vessel at a slow, safe speed when near humpbacks\n\nIn Hawaiߵi, regulations also prohibit operating an aircraft within 1,000 feet (333 yards) of a humpback whale.\n\nWhaleSENSE is a voluntary education and recognition program developed by NOAA Fisheries and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation in collaboration with the whale watching industry to recognize whale watching companies committed to responsible practices in the U.S. Atlantic and Alaska.\n\nCompanies participating in the WhaleSENSE program agree to:\n\nStick to the regional whale watching guidelines\n\nEducate naturalists, captains, and passengers to have “SENSE” while watching whales\n\nNotify and report whales in distress\n\nSet an example for other boaters\n\nEncourage ocean stewardship\n\nBoth Alaska and Hawaiߵi have specific guidance and requirements for minimizing whale watching impacts from tourism on humpback whales and other marine animals.\n\nReducing and Responding to Entanglement\n\nEntanglement in fishing gear is a leading cause of serious injury and death for many whale species, including humpback whales.\n\nIn the Atlantic, we implemented the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan to reduce the incidental mortality and serious injury of right whales, humpback whales, and fin whales in gillnets and trap/pot fisheries along the East Coast.\n\nIn the Pacific, we are working with state fishery management working groups to reduce the risks of entanglements in Dungeness crab pot fisheries, including the California Risk Assessment and Mitigation Program (RAMP) used to detect and respond to increased entanglement risk. NOAA Fisheries Science Centers are engaged in significant efforts to improve the scientific understanding of the drivers that may be influencing the risks of entanglements for whales along the U.S. West Coast. We also implemented the Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan to reduce mortalities and serious injuries of several marine mammal stocks, including humpback whales, incidentally injured in the California thresher shark/swordfish drift gillnet fishery.\n\nIn Alaska, we have a network of trained entanglement responders around the state. When an entangled whale is reported, responders can be authorized to evaluate the entanglement and, in cases where the entanglement is life threatening to the animal and a response can be carried out safely, a team may attempt to cut the whale free from gear.\n\nLearn more about large whale entanglement and how NOAA Fisheries is addressing this threat\n\nLearn more about bycatch and fisheries interactions\n\nReducing Vessel Strikes\n\nCollisions between whales and large vessels can injure or kill whales, damage the vessels, and injure passengers, but they often go unnoticed and unreported. The most effective way to reduce collision risk is to give whales a wide berth or avoid areas of high whale concentrations altogether. If this is not possible, the second best option is for vessels to slow down and keep a lookout.\n\nIn the Atlantic, we have taken both regulatory and non-regulatory steps to reduce the threat of vessel collisions to North Atlantic right whales. These actions, may also reduce the threat of vessel collisions to humpback whales, which occur in the same waters. The steps include:\n\nRequiring vessels to slow down in specific areas during specific times (Seasonal Management Areas)\n\nAdvocating for voluntary speed reductions in Dynamic Management Areas\n\nRecommending alternative shipping routes and areas to avoid\n\nModifying international shipping lanes\n\nDeveloping mandatory vessel reporting systems\n\nIncreasing outreach and education\n\nImproving our stranding response\n\nLearn more about vessel strikes and marine animals\n\nOverseeing Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response\n\nWe work with volunteer networks in all coastal states to respond to marine mammal strandings including all whales. When stranded animals are found alive, NOAA Fisheries and our partners assess the animal’s health and determine the best course of action. When stranded animals are found dead, our scientists work to understand and investigate the cause of death. Although the cause often remains unknown, scientists can sometimes attribute strandings to disease, harmful algal blooms, vessel strikes, fishing gear entanglements, pollution exposure, and underwater noise. Some strandings can serve as indicators of ocean health, giving insight into larger environmental issues that may also have implications for human health and welfare.\n\nLearn more about the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program\n\nMarine Mammal Unusual Mortality Events\n\nThere is an ongoing Humpback Whale Unusual Mortality Event, and the species has experienced unusual mortality events in the past. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, an unusual mortality event is defined as \"a stranding that is unexpected; involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population; and demands immediate response.\" To understand the health of marine mammal populations, scientists study unusual mortality events.\n\nGet information on active and past UMEs\n\nGet an overview of marine mammal UMEs\n\nAddressing Ocean Noise\n\nUnderwater noise can pose a threat to whales, interrupting their normal behavior and potentially causing temporary or permanent reductions in hearing. NOAA Fisheries is investigating all aspects of acoustic communication and hearing in marine animals, as well as the effects of sound on whale behavior and hearing. In 2018, we issued technical guidance for assessing the effects of anthropogenic (human-caused) sound on marine mammal hearing.\n\nLearn more about ocean noise\n\nNOAA Fisheries conducts research on the biology, behavior, and ecology of the humpback whale. The results are used to inform management decisions and enhance recovery efforts for this species.\n\nShipboard Studies\n\nNOAA Fisheries conducts research cruises that investigate the whales’ habitat preferences and feeding ecology, as well as doing photographic and genetic identification. Information from these research projects can be used to inform management actions that protect the humpback whale and reduce their human-related mortalities.\n\nThe Years of the North Atlantic Humpback Project in 1992 to 1993 and the follow-up project, More North Atlantic Humpbacks, in 2003 to 2005 were international collaborations to monitor humpback whale populations, investigate human-caused deaths, and conduct various other surveys, including research on humpback songs, across many humpback habitats.\n\nThe Structure of Populations, Levels of Abundance, and Status of Humpbacks (SPLASH) Project, conducted from 2004 to 2006, brought together many research programs and researchers from across the world, including NOAA Fisheries, to monitor humpbacks.\n\nAcoustic Science\n\nOther research is focused on the acoustic environment of cetaceans, including humpback whales. Acoustics is the science of how sound is transmitted. This research involves increasing our understanding of the basic acoustic behavior of whales, dolphins, and fish; mapping the acoustic environment; and developing better methods to locate cetaceans using autonomous gliders and passive acoustic arrays.\n\nLearn more about acoustic science\n\nAerial Surveys\n\nScientists use small aircraft to spot large whales (including humpbacks) and record their seasonal distribution. Understanding their migration patterns helps managers establish measures to reduce vessel strikes.\n\nStock Assessments\n\nDetermining the size of humpback whale populations helps resource managers determine the success of conservation measures and regulations.
