I think it just made it more authentically us.”\n\n“We didn’t know what to expect being on both sides of the glass, but we loved it,” Cannon said. “Everybody got along, and we really incorporated everybody’s ideas.”\n\nJeffers emphasizes how that sense of collaboration and experimentation defined their whirlwind 18 days of recording at the Sonic Ranch studio, outside of El Paso, Texas.\n\n“There’s never a right or wrong answer when it comes to ideas,” he said. “We would run every single idea from everyone — some work and some don’t, but we give them all a shot. And then there’s that magical moment when the whole band hears it, your eyes get a twinkle — ‘That’s it, that’s us!’ It’s usually a no-brainer.”\n\nIt should come as no surprise that at this point, the members of Whiskey Myers can communicate and create so cohesively. The band’s roots stretch back decades into the red dirt of East Texas, where Cannon, Jeffers and Tate first began playing together. They earned a rabid local following on the strength of their 2008 debut album, “Road Of Life,” and then notched their first No. 1 on the Texas Music Charts with the 2011 follow-up “Firewater.”\n\nWith “Early Morning Shakes,” though, the rest of the world started to catch up to what Texas already knew. Esquire called them “the real damn deal,” while USA Today wrote that their music had “shades of Led Zeppelin and David Allen Coe.” They took their blistering live show across the U.S. and U.K. non-stop, sharing stages with the likes of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Hank Williams Jr. and Jamey Johnson and racking up more than 300 million streams of their songs.\n\nThe band draws as much inspiration from Nirvana as from Waylon Jennings, and Whiskey Myers bursts out of the gate with the raging “Die Rockin’,” followed by such bruisers as “Rolling Stone” and “Gasoline.” Over the course of 14 tracks, though, songs expand, moods change and songs like “Bury My Bones” and “California to Carolina” explore different stories and emotions.\n\n“You want an album to be like a rollercoaster,” Jeffers said. “Does it really take you for a ride, with ups and downs and some loops and sometimes you’re upside down?”\n\n“Those first songs on the album were the first batch we recorded, and they were really rock ‘n roll,” Cannon said. “That got the juices flowing. But an album should be like a whole work of art that moves, comes out strong, ends strong, flows in the middle — like a good show does.”\n\nWhiskey Myers hasn’t dialed down their Southern rock rowdiness, but these songs also reveal new maturity and changes in the lives of the band — both Jeffers and Cannon got married since the release of their last record.\n\n“There’s always pressure there,” Jeffers said about the challenges of maintaining a relationship and a relentless touring schedule, “‘Bury My Bones’ is about being home. I was on the road and just wanted to go home. It is on your mind, sometimes harder than others, and it shows in the songs.”\n\n“We’re growing up,” Cannon said, “and this is exactly the place we’re at, and it comes out in our songs, in our business, everything, We’re not as wild as we were — we’re not totally calm, but you see how your life changes. You always write about little sections of your life — you can write a happy song when you’re sad, but you tend to go to where you are — and I just think this album is happier, more upbeat, doesn’t have too many dreary songs on it.”\n\nFor this band of renegade brothers, the goal isn’t to fit into a format or try a new direction for its own sake, it’s to be true to the music they love — and with Whiskey Myers they continue pushing in all directions and sharpening their attack, whether country, rock, blues, whatever — even adding the legendary McCrary Sisters’ gospel influence to the project on background vocals."
