        "text": "Capitol Police Officer William Evans, who died Friday following a confrontation with a motorist who rammed a barricade and lunged at authorities with a knife, was an 18-year veteran of the Washington department, officials said.\n\n\"He began his USCP service on March 7, 2003, and was a member of the Capitol Division’s First Responder’s Unit,\" Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said in a statement about Evans, who was known as Billy.\n\nCapitol Police said in a separate statement it was \"devastated\" by the death. The department had still been recovering from the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol, which claimed the life of Officer Brian Sicknick, 42. Another died by suicide after the riot, as did an officer with the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nDetails surrounding Evans' death were not immediately known, but officials indicated he was one of two officers struck when the blue Nissan Sentra driven by the suspect hit a barricade. Law enforcement sources alleged the man got out of the vehicle and ran toward law enforcers with a knife.\n\nThe second officer was \"stable,\" with non-life-threatening injuries, Capitol Police said on Twitter.\n\n\"There is still much to be determined about this attack and DHS offers its full support to Capitol Police and DC Mayor [Muriel] Bowser,\" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorka said in a statement.\n\nThe suspect, identified by multiple law enforcement sources as Noah Green, 25, of Indiana, was fatally shot by responding officers, officials said.\n\nBoth officers hit by the car were immediately hospitalized. The FBI was assisting with the Metropolitan police investigation into the motive behind the attack, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., mentioned the family Evans left behind.\n\n\"On behalf of the House of Representatives, I have conveyed our prayers and condolences to his mother Janice, with our offer of assistance to her and Officer Evans’ children Logan and Abigail,\" she said.\n\nIn a separate public statement, she said, \"Today, America’s heart has been broken by the tragic and heroic death of one of our Capitol Police heroes: Officer William Evans. He is a martyr for our democracy.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., spoke to the officer's family and told them \"they will forever be a part of our Capitol Hill community,\" a spokesman said.\n\nOn Friday afternoon President Joe Biden said in a statement that he wanted to express \"the nation's gratitude\" to the Capitol police.\n\n\"Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the violent attack at a security checkpoint on the U.S. Capitol grounds, which killed Officer William Evans of the U.S. Capitol Police, and left a fellow officer fighting for his life,\" the president said.\n\n\"We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans’ family, and everyone grieving his loss.\" he said.\n\nBiden ordered the United States flag at the White House, public federal buildings and military sites to be flown at half-staff through Tuesday in honor of Evans.\n\nIn a separate statement, Vice President Kamala Harris called the attack an \"inexplicable act of violence.\"\n\n\"We continue to be proud of the courageous men and women who defend the Capitol, especially during a challenging period when they have faced two violent and deadly attacks,\" she said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement, \"Once again, brave officers of the United States Capitol Police have been violently attacked while simply doing their job.\"\n\n\"I am heartbroken that Officer William F. Evans was killed in the line of duty defending the Capitol,\" he said."
