        "text": "Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River offers amazing opportunities to enjoy the river through a variety activities such as boating, fishing, tubing, and swimming. While the river may look serene and peaceful, looks can be deceiving. The current is often stronger than it appears and conditions are constantly changing. New obstacles can emerge after high water events or be invisible from the surface. Moving water can be very dangerous and can still be quite cold even on a warm day, leading to shock. Stay safe by reviewing best practices for river safety.\n\nWearing a Life Jacket\n\nOne of the easiest things you can do to keep yourself safe on or in the river is by wearing a properly-fitted life jacket. It is a fact—life jackets save lives. We strongly recommend everyone wears a life jacket while on or in the water.\n\nWear It and Wear It Right!\n\nLife jackets can only do their job if they are in good condition and worn correctly. A life jacket should fit snugly to the person so that the shoulders of life jacket cannot be pulled above one’s ears. Test the buoyancy of your life jacket each year and make sure it is still in good condition.\n\nLoaner Life Jacket Program\n\nDid you forget to bring a life jacket? Don’t let that stop you from being safe! Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River has a life jacket lending program, where visitors can borrow life jackets for free at certain public access points. Life jacket lending stations are open between Memorial Day to Labor Day.\n\nSkinners Falls Access, Skinners Fall W Rd, Narrowsburg, NY 12764 (at River Mile 295.5)\n\nTen Mile River Access, Crawford Rd, Narrowsburg, NY 12764 (near River Mile 284)\n\nLackawaxen Access, 135 Scenic Dr, Lackawaxen, PA 18435 (near River Mile 277.5)\n\nMongaup Access, NY-97, Narrowsburg, NY 12764 (near River Mile 261.5)\n\nLife jackets can be returned to:\n\nThe location that you borrowed the lifejacket from\n\nAny of the public accesses listed above\n\nAt one of the following public life jacket return stations:\n\nPennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission Matamoras Fishing Access, 1087 Delaware Drive, Matamoras, PA, 18336\n\nWest End Beach, 14 Ferry St, Port Jervis, NY 12771\n\nRiver Conditions\n\nAlways check the river conditions before getting out on the river.

There are no lifeguards to assist you. Swimming is the #1 cause of drowning in the park. Swimming is not recommended at Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River.\n\nHowever, if you do choose to swim, wade, or float in the river:\n\nWear a Life Jacket: Wearing a life jacket and shoes will reduce the risk of drowning.\n\nWear Closed-toed Shoes: Wearing closed-toe shoes will reduce the risk of getting your feet trapped underwater. Be careful of sharp and slippery rocks along the river.\n\nDo Not Jump or Dive off Cliffs, Rocks, or Bridges into the River: Water is often more shallow than it appears and objects under the water may not be visible. The river is constantly changing and new obstacles can appear in places that previously seemed safe.\n\nNever Attempt to Swim Across the River: The river water is often colder than one expects and the current often stronger than it appears. Steep underwater drop offs create very deep areas of the river. Swimming also uses up a lot of energy. Strong swimmers have drowned in the past attempting to swim across the river. Do not take the risk. Do not attempt to swim across the river.\n\nVisitors enjoy a variety of boating activities on the Delaware River. Things to keep in mind when using boats, kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, inflatable tubes, and other vessels on the river:\n\nDo not tie your lifejacket to our boat, vessel, inner tube, etc.\n\nKeep your weight low. Do not stand while in your boat.\n\nKneel when going through rapids, this reduces the likelihood of capsizing.\n\nIf with a partner, each of you should paddle on opposite sides of the canoe.\n\nHold the paddle, not the boat.\n\nConsumption of alcohol and drugs can be extremely dangerous while boating and on the water.\n\nDon’t panic.\n\nStay upstream of the boat to avoid getting pinned by the boat against a rock.\n\nDo not stand in rapids. Float on your back and keep your feet and stomach up. Point your feet downstream so you can push off of obstacles and avoid foot entrapment.\n\nDo not swim against the current. Backstroke and let the current take you to shore.\n\nPrioritize the safety of yourself and other passengers. Only retrieve boats and equipment if it can be done safely.\n\nCome Prepared and Have a Plan\n\nAlways plan ahead and do your research before you arrive at the river.\n\nCheck weather forecast and the river conditions.\n\nBring the appropriate gear:\n\nLife jacket\n\nClosed-toed shoes\n\nExtra clothes\n\nSunscreen\n\nRain gear\n\nAs applicable: boat and/or fishing equipment, valid NY or PA fishing license\n\nBring food and water.\n\nCommunicate: Always tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return.
