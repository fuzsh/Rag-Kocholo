        "text": "History buffs and clock watchers are celebrating the centennial of a horological revolution: the day the railroads eliminated the patchwork of regional times and brought standard time zones to the United States and Canada.\n\nAt noon on Sunday, Nov. 18, 1883, most of the train stations around the continent and many jewelers, factories, courthouses and other timekeepers adjusted their clocks to the four zones, Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific, of Standard Railway Time.\n\nUntil then the railroads had been coursing through a maze of at least 50 regional times. Even that had been an improvement over hundreds of local times that prevailed earlier when towns simply figured noon at when the sun was at its zenith.\n\nClocks in New York City were 1 minute 1 second behind Albany, but 10 minutes 27 seconds ahead of Baltimore. So the railroads decided to adopt a variation of the idea first advanced in 1869 by a New York schoolmaster, Charles F. Dowd, to divide the continent into four time belts, each 15 degrees of longitude, or one hour, wide. Campaign Was Mounted\n\nWilliam F. Allen, secretary of the railroads' General Time Convention and editor of The Traveller's Official Guide, fashioned the final plan and mounted a publicity campaign to muster support for standard time.\n\nAs the appointed hour neared, churches in New York City chimed their bells at their customary noon. But the new noon occurred four minutes later when, on a signal telegraphed from the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, a time ball dropped at the Western Union building. The telegragh company flashed the time signal around the country.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
