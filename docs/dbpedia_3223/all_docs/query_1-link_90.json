        "text": "Jem Nolt Nelson passed away peacefully in Cream Ridge, New Jersey at the age of 93.\n\nJem lived a remarkable life. She was born in Landisville, PA in Lancaster County where she graduated from East Hempfield High School. After matriculating at Temple University, she attended Cornell University New York Hospital School of Nursing, Class of 1951, where she would meet her late husband of 66 years, Dewey A. Nelson, MD, while playing piano for Cornell Medical School parties. She lived with Dewey as a newlywed in Japan in 1953 during his service in the Korean War.\n\nWhile Dewey was finishing his neurology residency at Bellevue Hospital in New York, Jem worked as a visiting nurse there until they moved to Wilmington, Delaware to set up Dewey’s practice in 1957. Many years later, Jem obtained her master’s degree in nursing from the University of Delaware, taught nursing at a local community college and ran the final 10 years of Dewey’s office practice until his retirement in 1996.\n\nMore important than her professional endeavors was Jem’s faith. She was a devoted servant to Jesus Christ and this positively affected everything she did and everyone she touched. She was a member of Red Clay Creek Presbyterian Church for over 60 years where she served as an elder, choir member, musician, teacher, clerk of session and mission participant.\n\nHer faith was lived out in relationships. Jem loved people. Her greatest calling in life was to her family. She was a wife, mother of 5, grandmother of 14, and great-grandmother of 2. Jem was a wonderful mother who mentored by example and nurtured by grace.\n\nJem was the quintessential grandmother, baking thousands of batches of chocolate chip cookies and sending many a thoughtful card and gift for each and every birthday. She could throw together a Thanksgiving dinner for 30 people in her sleep.\n\nJem loved taking long walks with her dear friends and neighbors and playing the piano for anyone who would ask her. She loved feeding birds and bird watching. Her favorite was the bluebird. She also was an author, who published a memoir devoted to her grandmother.\n\nEven after her stroke in 2010 that robbed her of her ability to talk and tickle the ivories, Jem never lost her sense of humor. She embodied the Bluebird of Happiness. Jem was always humble and selfless and will be sorely missed by those she loved and touched.\n\nJem is survived by a sister, Mary Nolt Mortemore of Oregon, Ohio; her five children and their spouses: Allen F. Nelson and wife Rose (Tombazzi), Stephen J. Heinzel-Nelson and wife Elisabeth (Heinzel), Jean M. Nelson and husband Matthew DiGioia, John D. Nelson and wife Randa (Boggus) and Daniel E. Nelson and wife Toshiko (Katano). She is also survived by 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Jem was preceded in death by her beloved husband, Dewey, in 2017 and by her loving grandson, Brandon Nelson, in 2018.\n\nA springtime memorial service and life celebration will be scheduled for 2022 and will be held at Red Clay Creek Presbyterian Church at a date to be determined."
