Alford\n\nDate of Birth Sunday, January 20, 1952\n\nDate of Death Monday, May 9, 2016\n\nPlace of Death [Middletown, New Castle Co.] DE\n\nGerald was born in Washington, DC on January 20, 1952 to the late Francis M. Alford, Sr. and Geneva Gilliam Alford. The family eventually moved to Philadelphia, PA.; where he grew up with his two older brothers, Francis and Wilbur. Gerald was baptized at an early age. He spent his years growing up as a member of Corinthian Baptist Church in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nGerald was educated in the Philadelphia School System. He graduated from the Philadelphia Police Academy and joined the Philadelphia Police Department. Gerald loved being a police officer and served in various capacities including patrol and undercover vice. One of his fun memories was working the New Years Day Mummers Parades where he could be seen doing a strut while controlling the crowd.\n\nGerald was a member of the Masonic Order - King David Lodge 52, in Philadelphia, PA. He became a Master Mason in 1985. He loved his lodge and was a member in good standing.\n\nGerald was joined in matrimony to Jill Richards and from that union, no children were born. He later married Sheryl Oliver and from that union, he gained a loving daughter, Martinique Sheree, and a daughter was born, Sydney Nicole, who is truly the spitting image of her dad and carries his personality. His daughters meant the world to him and he was always proud to talk about them and their accomplishments. They were also proud to talk about their dad.\n\nAfter retiring from the Police Department, he moved his family to New Castle, Delaware. He became a member of Seeds of Greatness Bible Church in New Castle, DE, where he eagerly served on the Security Ministry.\n\nUnable to sit still, he wanted to explore other career options and began working at Union Park Honda in Wilmington, DE. Gerald was the typical salesman  he could sell stripes to a zebra!\n\nGerald eventually moved to South Florida and adopted it as his home. He later served as Director of Security for Tenant Healthcare at West Boca Medical Center where he built many relationships and memories with the people he worked with. Gerald loved the sunshine, warmth and salt water. Gerald loved to golf, ride his Harley to Daytona, visit the Keys and spend lots of time in the water.\n\nOn the verge of Gerald becoming ill, he relocated to North Carolina to be closer to his family. In North Carolina he spent a lot of time visiting with his late aunt Cleo. His final employment was at Truck Movers Trucking Company where the freedom of the road appealed to him. Not long after settling in North Carolina, Geralds health took another turn and he ventured back to Delaware to be even closer to his family. Geralds ultimate wish was to go back to Florida even if just for a visit. Florida will be the final resting place for Gerald Alford and his wish will be granted.\n\nGerald is survived by his daughters, Sydney and Marty, as well as his brothers, Francis (Corliss) and Wilbur; Gerald leaves behind his grandchildren, Jordan, Jaidan, Justin, Karl, Jr., and Jurnee. He is also survived by his nieces, Tracie, Shawnette and Tammy along with a host cousins other family and friends in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Florida, North Carolina, Washington DC, Maryland and New Jersey.\n\nAAFA NOTES: SSDI records do not yet list his death.\n\n******************************************\n\nGERTRUDE HALL ALFORD\n\nEVENING JOURNAL\n\nWilmington, New Castle Co., DEWednesday 4 August 1971\n\nAAFA NOTES: SSDI records do not list her death.\n\nSee the obituaries of her husband, Leroy Romeo Alford; and children Constance Alford Verucci, John William Alford, and Thomas Hall Alford Sr. in this compilation..\n\nFrom Delaware, Birth Records (Ancestry): Gertrude Hall was born 18 May 1893 in Wilmington, New Castle Co., DE, daughter of Wm.

Alford was found dead at her Pike Creek home Monday by New Castle County police after she did not show up for grand jury proceedings she was to oversee.\n\nThe cause of death was not released, but county police said their initial investigation did not indicate foul play. Alford was 54.\n\nShe was a remarkable judge, well thought of by her fellow judges and court employees, said Art Bernardino, Superior Court administrator. She was a pleasure to work with.\n\nAppointed by former Gov. Mike Castle in 1992, Alford became the first black woman to serve on the states Superior Court. Before her appointment, she worked as counsel for Aqualon Co., a Hercules Inc. subsidiary.\n\nAlford was a native of New York and received her bachelor of arts degree from Herbert H. Lehman College, City University of New York, in 1971. She earned her law degree from Rutgers University School of Law-Camden. She was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1976 and to the Delaware Bar in 1981.\n\nCounty police forced their way into Alfords home about 2 p.m., after she didnt answer their knocks at the door, Officer 1st Class Trinidad Navarro, police spokesman, said. The state Medical Examiners Office will determine how she died.\n\nJudge Alford will be missed by her friends and her colleagues, Gov. Ruth Ann Minner said through a spokeswoman. Her family should be proud of the service she rendered to the state of Delaware.\n\nAlford is survived by her son, Julian, and daughter, Kaamilah.\n\nMany in Delawares legal community were shocked to learn of the judges death.\n\nJudge Alford was a role model for so many of us who practice in the community, said Chipman L. Flowers Jr., an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Wilmington. Flowers, who is chairman of the Multicultural Judges & Lawyers Section of the Delaware State Bar Association, said Alford often spoke at the organizations October gathering to welcome new minority members.\n\nFlowers also said that Alford was always willing to give advice to attorneys seeking it. She was a mover and a shaker, but she never wanted to be in the limelight, he said.\n\nDelaware Public Defender Larry Sullivan said many attorneys enjoyed appearing before Alford. She was a wonderful judge, who had no bias whatsoever, he said.\n\nDelaware Attorney General M. Jane Brady said she and Alford often talked to each other about the importance of being role models, especially to young women. We wanted to let young girls know that they could dare to dream and to reach for goals, Brady said.\n\nPrior to Alfords nomination, then-Gov. Castle had been criticized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for his lack of minority judicial appointments. But Castle, now Delawares member of the U.S. House of Representatives, said he appointed Alford because of her qualifications, not because she was a minority.\n\nI got to know her through the process. I was very impressed by her, he said. Such a loss is very hard to comprehend.\n\nCourt administrators said they did not know what would happen with Alfords caseload. At this point, no one is thinking of that, Bernardino said.\n\nIn another article:\n\nNEWS JOURNAL\n\nWilmington, New Castle Co., DEFriday, 15 August 2003\n\nThe Honorable Haile L.

Appointed by former Governor Michael N. Castle in 1992, Judge Alford became the first African American woman to serve on the Delaware State Supreme Court. She remained in that position until her death. Judge Alford received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Herbert H. Lehman College-City University of New York in 1971. She earned her law degree from Rutgers University School of Law in Camden, NJ in 1976 and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar the same year. Admission to the Delaware Bar followed in 1981. Prior to her appointment to the bench, Judge Alford was employed with Hercules, Inc. and Aqualon Company.\n\nJudge Alford held membership in a myriad of organizations that reflected her wide-ranging interests and active responsibility to the legal profession and her commitment to making the greater Wilmington community a better place in which to live. This included the Delaware State Bar Association: Women in Law Division and Multicultural Judges and Lawyers Division; Board of Governors for the National Bar Association Judicial Council; Philadelphia Judicial Council; and Board of Managers for the Wilmington Library. Past memberships included board member of New Castle County Head Start; board member of Delaware Adolescence Program, Inc.; a member of Task Force on Racial and Ethnic Fairness; committee of the Delaware Supreme Court and the Governors Council on Labor. Some of her hobbies were bridge, sewing, biking and collecting antiques.\n\nJudge Alford will be lovingly remembered by her devoted son and daughter, Julian and Kaamilah Moore; 3 brothers, William D., Jr., Harry W. and Douglas B.

Cole\n\nSuperior Court Judge Haile L. Alford, who died last week in her Pike Creek home, is being remembered as a compassionate jurist and person whose New York City upbringing contributed to a quick wit and energetic personality.\n\nThe 54-year-old made lasting impressions on those who knew her.\n\nTo members of the judiciary, she discharged her duties with integrity and respected those who appeared before her. Judge Alford has the distinction of being the first black woman to serve on a state constitutional court, which includes the Supreme Court, Chancery Court and Superior Court.\n\nYoung lawyers in the bar considered her a mentor, always available for advice or support.\n\nFriends recall Judge Alford having wisdom, a passion for life and varied hobbies and interests, including being a seamstress and once owning a small antique shop in downtown Wilmington.\n\nShe loved life and was the most vibrant, witty, energetic and entertaining person I knew, said longtime friend Arnetta McRae of Delaware.\n\nWe will miss our friend and the camaraderie we all had with her, said Superior Court President Judge Henry duPont Ridgely. She showed throughout her life a special compassion and dignity, and, as a mentor for young members of the bar, she will be very difficult to replace.\n\nJudge Alford handled civil and criminal cases in New Castle County. Ridgely said her scheduled hearings are being assigned as judges are available to hear them. Other cases may have to be postponed, he said.\n\nRidgely expects to hold a memorial court session, but a date has not been set.\n\nJudge Alfords funeral services were to be held Aug. 17, at St. Paul UAME Church in Wilmington. She was buried Aug. 19, in The Evergreen Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nJudge Alfords brother, Harry Alford of Freeport, N.Y., said authorities are telling the family his sister died of natural causes, although the autopsy by the county Medical Examiners Office is still pending.\n\nOn Aug. 11, New Castle County police found Judge Alford dead on her bed inside her home. She was last seen Aug. 8, said Harry Alford. She lived alone, having divorced several years before.\n\nAfter Judge Alford failed to show up for a grand jury hearing, a court employee called 911. Police were then sent out on a welfare check, said police Officer 1st Class Trinidad Navarro.\n\nWhen police arrived they knocked on the door, but no one answered. Officers then disabled the front door lock and entered the home.\n\nOfficers found Judge Alford lying on her bed. Medical personnel were called to the scene, but it was apparent she was already dead, police said.\n\nNavarro said the doors and windows were still locked and nothing appeared out of place. There was no other evidence obtained at the scene to point to any sort of foul play, Navarro said.\n\nJudge Alfords friends said she had high blood pressure but otherwise appeared healthy. She recently took up bicycling.\n\nLast year, Judge Alfords younger brother was found dead in his home in New York City after suffering from heart complications caused by heart disease, said Harry Alford.\n\nIn 1992, former Gov. Michael N. Castle nominated Judge Alford to the Superior Court bench. Her 12-year term was due to expire in July 2004, but sources confirmed she most recently applied for the vacant vice chancellor post on the Court of Chancery.\n\nJudge Alford grew up in Brooklyn, and in 1971 received a bachelors degree in history from Herbert H. Lehman College, City University of New York. She was a junior high school teacher for a few years before attending law school at Rutgers University in Camden. She earned her law degree in 1976, and joined the law department at Hercules Inc.\n\nShe was the first black woman lawyer to work in the Hercules law department. She also worked at Aqualon Co., a division of Hercules.\n\nJudge Alford was a member of the Richard S. Rodney Inn of Court and was involved in several community organizations.\n\nMentor and Advocate\n\nJudge Alford was a mentor to many young lawyers.\n\nWhat stands out for me is she was so candid and upfront when I sought advice, said Chipman L. Flowers, chairman of the state bars Multicultural Judges and Lawyers Section. What was important to her was that lawyers knew she was there.\n\nDelaware Supreme Court Justice Randy J. Holland said Judge Alford was hardworking but always had a smile, regardless of the load she was carrying.\n\nState Attorney General M. Jane Brady said Judge Alford cared about her role in the community.\n\nTo her, she felt an obligation to be a role model.\n\nDelaware State Bar Association President Charles S. McDowell said Judge Alford discharged her legal and judicial responsibilities in the highest tradition of our bench and bar.\n\nJudge Alford spoke at and attended many minority job fairs. As a way of inspiring others, she talked with passion about striving for lofty goals and of her own experience breaking down barriers, said Joshua W. Martin III, president of Verizon Delaware Inc.\n\nMartin, also a Rutgers graduate and longtime friend, remembers Judge Alford telling him he must accept his 1982 appointment to Superior Court because, as the first minority appointed to a state constitutional court, it is historically significant.\n\nIts funny, because I recall those were the same words I told her when she was nominated for the bench in 1992, Martin said.\n\nFriends will miss her sound advice.\n\nJudge Alford was everyones sounding board, said McRae, a friend of 30 years, and chairwoman of the Delaware Public Services Commission. I cant even comprehend not having her insights and input anymore.\n\nJudge Alford is survived by son Julian and daughter Kaamilah Moore; brothers William, Harry and Douglas; and many other relatives. Her parents and her brother Norris preceded her in death....\n\nIn another article:\n\nDelaware Online\n\n23 February 2007\n\nBLACK HISTORY MONTH: 10 FIRSTS IN THE FIRST STATE\n\nSEVERAL AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS IN DELAWARE HAVE ACHIEVED NO. 1 STATUS\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Haile L. Alford became the first black woman to serve on the states Superior Court.\n\nJudge Haile Alford, the first black woman appointed to the bench of Delawares Superior Court, could talk to anyone from a janitor to a Supreme Court justice and be comfortable, said her secretary, Benita Smith.\n\nAlford grew up in New York and earned a law degree from Rutgers University after several years of teaching. In 1976, she went to work for Hercules, where she handled corporate matters such as labor arbitration and purchasing.\n\nGov. Mike Castle appointed her to the bench in 1992. The judiciary suited Alford well because of her analytical mind and understanding of others circumstances, said friend Arnetta McRae.\n\nAlford made it a point to mentor young adults because she felt she had lacked role models. One may never know that they did something to encourage a person, Alford said in a 1997 interview. But I think we all are role models and we should always strive to be the best we can be. She died in 2003.\n\nAAFA NOTES: SSDI records show that Haile L.
