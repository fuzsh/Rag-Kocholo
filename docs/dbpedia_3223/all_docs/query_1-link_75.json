        "text": "Will was a true man of God. He died February 27, 2018, his 34th birthday. He was a remarkable man of faith and courage, with his main goal in life being to glorify his Savior in all his ways.\n\nWill was an elder in his church. Strongly rooted in his convictions, he made choices reflecting those beliefs. He strove to be a blessing to everyone and was always willing to put others’ needs before his own.\n\nWill was a loving provider. He was a devoted husband to his high school sweetheart, Bonnie. He sacrificed in many ways so that she could stay home with their four small children, Walker, Hudson, Darby, and Chauncey. He wanted his children to grow closer to God through being in nature and loved nothing more than spending time with them outdoors. He spent countless hours carrying them on his back up a hiking trail and just as many hours rocking them to sleep. He sang a special song for each child.\n\nWill was a servant to all around him. No matter the situation, he was there to help and give a smile. He learned how to work with his hands from an early age through his family’s construction and building supply business. He also ran his own electrical business with his best friend from childhood. He was skilled in many ways and had a tremendous work ethic. He used his extensive knowledge to bless others.\n\nWill was a firefighter. As a boy, he would pretend his bicycle was a firetruck and ride all over the neighborhood with his siren blaring. He joined the Ebbs Chapel Volunteer Fire Department at age 16, where he served as their deputy chief. A dream was realized when he became a career firefighter with the City of Asheville Fire Department. He most recently worked as an engineer for Station 6. He was always studying, learning, and achieving so that he could perform his job to the best of his ability.\n\nWhether it was mowing for a friend, helping fix dinner, solving a plumbing problem, cutting down a tree, or changing a diaper, he was always there to lend a hand. He gave 100% to whatever situation he was facing. He never wavered or questioned his duty, even when faced with the ultimate sacrifice. He truly made the world a better place. He will always be carried in the hearts of those who knew him."
