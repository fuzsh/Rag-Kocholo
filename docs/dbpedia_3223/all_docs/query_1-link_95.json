        "text": "Enhancing phosphorous removal in permeable paving\n\nPrincipal Investigator(s): Davis, Allen P.\n\nThis project will provide research and development support for a sub-base material to be used with PaverGuide, a base material for permeable paving. This paving reduces sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus runoff into the Chesapeake Bay. Specific emphasis is on phosphorus removal. More information about this project is available online.\n\nEvaluation of compost addition to stormwater control measure (SCM) performance\n\nPrincipal Investigator(s): Davis, Allen P.\n\nRecent state law encourages the use of compost throughout the landscape. This project evaluates the possibility of using compost in bioretention and submerged gravel wetland stormwater control measures. Emphasis is on understanding, quantifying, and minimizing leaching of nitrogen and phosphorus from the compost. More information about this project is available online.\n\nLIDMIX Stormwater Treatment System\n\nPrincipal Investigator(s): Davis, Allen P.\n\nUse of Compost to Establish Permanent Vegetation"
