        "text": "Gregg Bacchieri, age 62, passed away peacefully after a courageous five-year battle with cancer on Tuesday, January 15, 2019 surrounded by his wife and two children.\n\nHe joined his late mother Carole, brother Bob, and mother and father in-law Joan and John Hondry. Born in Aurora, Colorado, Gregg lived in many places across the country and world as part of a military family. He attended Robinson High School in Northern Virginia where he was captain of the basketball team. His love for athletics continued at Virginia Tech. In the early 1980’s, he started his 30-plus year career with MBNA which brought him to Wilmington, Delaware where he met Stacey, his loving wife. At MBNA, he sat on Mastercard and VISA International committees and was instrumental in instituting anti-fraud and security features that have since been implemented worldwide. He oversaw thousands of employees across many sites and was widely seen as a mentor and leader by example. He valued the views of the people he worked with and strived to include their input in all decisions. The people of MBNA describe Gregg as an authentic, dedicated man who was confident and steadfast in his values of family and “doing the right thing.” He touched so many lives and made a positive impact during his career and throughout his life. Also, a philanthropist, Gregg sat on the boards of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware and Sanford School for many years. He also supported Helen Graham Cancer Center and Christiana Care, Nativity Preparatory School, Serviam Girls Academy, Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition, The Garage Community Youth Center, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, University of Delaware, Ursuline Academy, Strive: How You Lead Matters, and more.\n\nGregg travelled the world with his family and especially enjoyed his time at the beach in Rehoboth, Delaware and Naples, Florida. An athlete and lover of sports, he played and enjoyed watching basketball, football (go Redskins!), tennis, golf, baseball, fishing, and volleyball. He often enjoyed dining out with family and friends, and once entrees were taken away, would quickly ask for “the check please” (unless vanilla ice cream was an option for dessert). There are too many family memories to list… including vacations, holidays, outings, and traditions. He treasured these times with his wife “LuLu,” daughter “Bun-Bun,” son “C’mon Nol,” and dog “Izz-Ball.”\n\nGregg is survived by his beloved wife Stacey of 32 years; his children Krista and Nolan (fiance Anna Taber); his father Leo R. Bacchieri; his sisters Karen Roberson (Dwayne) and Jill Jones (Jeff); his sister-in-law Joell Bacchieri; his nephews Leo J. Bacchieri, Max Bacchieri and John Hondry; his niece Kim Gardner; and his brothers-in-law Bill Hondry and Steve Hondry.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Gregg’s name to the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center, Head and Neck Bacchieri Research Fund, at the Department of Radiation Oncology, 4701 Ogletown-Stanton Rd, Suite 1109, Newark, DE 19713."
