        "text": "Allen was born in Bridgeville, Delaware, son of William Franklin (\"Frank\") Allen and Mollie (Smith) Allen. He moved to Seaford, Sussex County, Delaware, with his family in 1889, and then to Laurel, Delaware in 1903. He married Addie M. Davis on April 16, 1905, and they had three children, Robert, Franklin, and Doris. They belonged to the Methodist Church.\n\nAfter completing school in 1902, Allen worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad as an agent, telegrapher, and train dispatcher. In 1922, he returned to Seaford, Delaware, began a real estate business, and also formed a business buying and selling fruit and produce along the Delmarva Peninsula. In 1927, Allen diversified his businesses, and founded the Allen Petroleum Corporation and the Allen Package Company.\n\nAllen was a public school commissioner in Seaford from 1920 until 1924, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1920.\n\nAllen was elected to the State Senate in 1924. He served in the Senate from 1925 to 1929, serving as President pro tempore in 1927[1]\n\nA strong supporter of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, Allen was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1936, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Representative J. George Stewart. Allen lost his bid for a second term in 1938 to Republican George S. Williams, a businessman from Millsboro, Delaware. During his term, Allen was a member of the Democratic majority in the 75th Congress and served from January 3, 1937, until January 3, 1939, during the second administration of President Roosevelt.\n\nSubsequently, he resumed his work in the oil and gasoline distribution business. In 1940, he challenged both major parties and ran for the U.S. Senate as an Independent \"Liberal Democrat\", but received only a small number of votes."
