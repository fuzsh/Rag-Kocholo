        "text": "(1868–1944). Known throughout the United States as the “Sage of Emporia,” William Allen White was the publisher of a small-town newspaper. His opinions on public issues, however, were republished throughout the nation and influenced public attitudes and government policy.\n\nWhite was born in Emporia, Kan., on Feb. 10, 1868, and lived there nearly all of his life. After attending the University of Kansas, he worked for the El Dorado Republican from 1890 to 1892 as business manager and the Kansas City Star (1892–95) as editorial writer. He bought the Emporia Daily and Weekly Gazette in 1895. In his well-written editorials he became the spokesman for liberal Republicanism. He came to the attention of the whole country in 1896, when his editorial, “What’s the Matter with Kansas?,” was widely reprinted in other papers and circulated by the Republican party. It attacked the Populist Democratic platform of presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and probably helped elect William McKinley to office. Another powerful editorial—on freedom of speech—won him a Pulitzer prize in 1923."
