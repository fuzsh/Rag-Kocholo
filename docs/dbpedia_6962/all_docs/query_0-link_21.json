        "text": "No, this is NOT a sequel to ”I Am Curious – Yellow”: both movies were shot and edited parallel. ”Blue” opened five months later, and with much less brouhaha. ”I Am Curious – Yellow” had worked as an effective ice-breaker. But it took three years until U.S. Customs took its confiscating hands off both films. After finally opening, they grossed a then phenomenal 50 million SEK, the total production budget many times over.The story about Lena and Börje (and the Director, played by... the director, Sjöman, himself) follows on where the yellow adventure ended; the two movies are intertwined into one giant and curious look at the state of Sweden in the late Sixties."
