        "text": "Aside from the fact that \"I Am Curious (Blue),\" which opened yesterday at the Evergreen, Cine Malibu and neighborhood theaters is decidedly less blue than \"I Am Curious (Yellow),\" it is so similar to the first that it almost seems to be the same movie, which indeed, it is.When he was making his film in 1966 and 1967, Vilgot Sjoman, the Swedish director, called it simply \"I Am Curious,\" and in its first rough cut, its running time was something more than three hours. Sjoman thereupon took the footage and edited it into the two parallel films that can be immediately distinguished only by the title parentheses, which refer to the colors of the Swedish flag.Sjoman has thus been able to indulge himself in a way denied to most movie directors, who judge every bit of exposed film to be unique and dear. If \"I Am Curious\" were nothing else (and I think it is), it would still be noteworthy in cinematic history as a stunt, one that recalls Billy Wilder's suggestion that Hollywood give an Oscar each year to the most successful wheeler-dealer.One West Coast critic, who saw both films back-to-back at the Sandrews screening room in Stockholm, has written a long and careful essay in Film Quarterly noting the schematic differences in the two. 'Yellow,\" he says, emphasizes social ills and is \"a man's film.\" \"Blue,\" a woman's film, is \"more concerned with the relations between people.\" It's possible to make such distinctions, but it's difficult and precious work, and I'm not at all sure it's really valid.\"Because \"Yellow\" and \"Blue\" were conceived as a single film, they overlap and reiterate each other, and to discuss them as separate works is no more rewarding than seeking out the differences between the first 16 chapters of \"Women in Love\" and the last 15.As in \"Yellow,\" Sjöman, who describes himself in one of \"Blue's\" many title cards, slogans and chapter headings as a \"young film director, age 42,\" is his own leading actor, playing a film director named Vilgot Sjöman, who is making a movie starring Lena Nyman, age 20, with whom he is having a rather bumpy, unsatisfactory affair.Mostly through Lena, both the actress in real life and the character in the film-within-the-film, Sjöman conducts a relentless, often very funny inquiry into Swedish political, social and sexual attitudes. Sjöman's methods amounts to a kind of cinematic collage consisting of man-in-the-street interviews, fiction, still photographs, posters and newsreels.Not so surprisingly, smugness and hypocrisy are rampant. Nobody quite manages to practice what he preaches. One of Lena's former lovers, the man who schooled her in nonviolence, can only make love after he has beaten up his partner-to-be. Lena herself spends a lot of time trying to be unfaithful to Sjöman with Borge Ahlstedt, her co-star in the film-within-the-film.In \"Yellow,\" Lena was militantly concerned on behalf of disarmament and peace. In \"Blue,\" she is concerned with women's liberation, with religion and with prison reform. As in \"Yellow,\" she exhibits a marvelous faith in the efficacy of home-made, wall posters (\"Message to the Prison Board/You have stopped thinking radical\").In \"Yellow,\" it was often impossible to tell whether you were watching the main film, or the film-within. There is no such confusion in \"Blue,\" but because the differences between the frame and the interior movie are so slight, they effectively become a single, slightly mocking experience.I'm not very fond of this sort of moviemaking, which tries to disarm conventional criticism by exploiting formlessness as meaningful itself, but I like Sjoman's sense of humor and sense of humanity, and his obvious affection for Lena of the earnest, pretty face and the somewhat rotund figure that betrays every candy bar she has ever eaten. It looks like real love.\n\nThe CastI AM CURIOUS (BLUE), directed by Vilgot Sjoman; Swedish with English subtitles; music by Bengt Ernryd and Bengt Palmers; producted by Goran Lindgren; released by Grove Press.
