        "text": "The Boat of a Million Years\n\nPoul Anderson. Tor Books, $19.95 (470pp) ISBN 978-0-312-93199-5\n\nLess a novel than a series of short stories and novelettes tied together by their subjects, this volume tells of 11 ``immortals'': individuals who will not die of old age but who can, however, be killed. Anderson ( The Avatar ) brings proven storytelling abilities and research skills to chronicles that range from 310 B.C. to a centuries-distant future. Many of the stories describe an immortal's first awareness of his or her difference, and flight from accusations of witchcraft; other tales relate chance encounters between immortals; a few simply tell a good yarn. The penultimate chapter tells of the eight survivors coming together in present times; the last portrays a future where science has extended everyone's life, creating a world vastly different from what the immortals had expected.
