        "text": "TITLE: The Boat of a Million Years\n\nAUTHOR: Poul Anderson\n\nPUBLISHER: Tor Books\n\nDATE: 1989\n\n“Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you.” So wrote the Roman philosopher-Emperor Marcus Aurelius in his Meditations, sometime between 170 and 180 AD. “Nothing in life is certain but death and taxes” wrote Benjamin Franklin, in 1789. “Nothing in life is promised except death” is what contemporary rapper Kanye West said in his 2005 acceptance speech for Best Rap Album at the GRAMMYs. The inevitability of death is one of the most persistent themes in human literature and philosophy, an obsession for obvious reasons. The Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest story we have, written over four thousand years ago, is about grappling with the terrible knowledge that life is fleeting, and that death is unavoidable. But what if it wasn’t? That’s the question that Poul Anderson tackles in his breathtaking saga The Boat of a Million Years, in a story that is both sweeping in scope and all-too human in scale. It’s a strange, beautiful one, and one of the best pieces of science fiction I’ve read in a long time.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nIt doesn’t happen very often. One in a million? One in a hundred million? Nobody knows for sure. But it happens. People are born who do not die. They don’t realize it at first, of course. They have normal childhood, they grow to adulthood. But they don’t get sick. They don’t age. Their spouses wither away, their children grow old, and they remain young and healthy, unchanging and eternal. They don’t know why. They don’t know how. But those that escape the terrified lynch mobs and the accusations of witchcraft learn to live with it. They learn to adapt, to conceal their true natures, to come to terms with the long, winding road of the centuries, to shift with the shifting of civilizations and nations. And as eternity spools onward? They begin to find each other.\n\nWHAT I LIKED:\n\nThe Boat of a Million Years doesn’t have a plot so much as it has a premise; the idea that throughout history, occasional immortals are born. They’re ordinary humans in every respect, except that they just don’t die. It’s a brilliantly simply concept, and Anderson uses it as a lens to explore a wide variety of different times and places and ideas. For most of the novel, the story is set up as a series of disconnected and standalone vignettes, jumping back and forth between characters as they advance from 310 BCE to some unspecified date in the Far Future. Characters are born, and sometimes killed, and figure out who they are, and what they are, and make choices about what kind of life they want to lead, and then sometimes make new choices. It takes a long time until the various strands begin to weave together into a single, cohesive narrative, and that doesn’t really happen until all the surviving immortals are brought together in the last few chapters. Most of the time, it’s essentially an excuse to explore the human condition, and it works really well as that.\n\nDeath, and its inevitability, is a fundamental part of being alive. Remove that and…….what do you get? For the immortals in our story, life just keeps going, and its as much a curse as it is a blessing. Memories build up over the centuries until they threaten to overwhelm you—pretty much everyone went through a few decades of insanity while they learned to deal with that—wives and children and husbands and beloved friends pass away, societies evolves around you. Those that survive learn a certain amount of distance, they cultivate the ability to stand apart from the rest of their civilization, to not get too comfortable or too close to anyone or anything. They’re very different. But they’re still human. They’re still indelibly molded by their upbringing, by their beliefs, by their personalities. Eternity provides the time to accumulate knowledge, to build secret financial empires for some, to learn centuries of philosophy and lore for others, or just a lot of time to drink and whore away the years for a few. It doesn’t make them Gods, or masters, or supermen. It just makes them people.\n\nThe obvious comparison, for me at least, is the movie The Old Guard, based on the comic of the same name. It’s a similar premise, following a group of immortal warriors, but I think Boat of a Million Years has a much more interesting take on the concept. I did like the movie a lot, but it sort of………cheats? That’s not the right word, but I think it focuses on a very narrow interpretation of the idea, and loses a lot in doing that. The Old Guard of The Old Guard are all warriors, obviously, they don’t just not age, but can regenerate from any wound, and they are all drawn to one another by dreams. Poul Anderson explores a wider range of the human experience, and the fact that his immortals are so much more human makes them so much more interesting. There’s no secret brotherhood or mission here, it’s just the story of a dozen or so men and women slowly realizing that they’re different from everyone else, and trying to find ways of grappling with that. Hanno, the closest thing we have to a protagonist, spends thousands of years trying to find other immortals, with only minimal success until the modern day. Other spend centuries living as hermits up in the mountains. It’s a deeper, and richer story, even if it has less Charlize Theron murdering people, which I do admit is a shame.\n\nSo much of the fun of this book is reading about the different paths and choices the different characters make over the years. As I keep saying, most chapters are essentially standalone stories, and a lot of them are great. Just for example, you’ve got:\n\nIn Chapter II “The Peaches of Forever”, set c. 19 AD during the reign of the usurper Wang Mang in Han China, we meet Tu Shan, a wandering Taoist monk. Unlike so many of his peers, he has never hidden his nature or attempted any subterfuge—-after all, Taoist holy men are supposed to live forever. He is simple and straightforward, a man who makes no pretenses about who or what he is, but when the Emperor attempts to recruit him as a court advisor, he makes his excuses and leaves the civilized lowlands of China.\n\nChapter V “No Man Shuns His Doom” is an interesting one because it’s the only one adopted from preexisting folklore. Here, Anderson retells a version of the Norse saga of Nornagestr, a man blessed or cursed to live as long as a specific candle was un-burnt. In Boat, he has been a live for thousands of years, since sometime in the Neolithic era. He meets Starkad, another immortal viking, and a great warrior, and he hopes that his long loneliness will be at an end, but they are too different from one another. This is not the first or the last time that we will see that immortality is no guarantee of friendship. In the end, Starkad dies heroically in battle, and Nornagestr converts to Christianity, and allows himself to pass away peacefully in 998 AD.\n\nThe search for connection, and how often it fails, is a running theme throughout the book. We see it again in Chapter VI “Encounter”, where we’re first introduced to Svoboda Volodarovna, a young widow moving to Kiev in 1065 AD, after the death of her third husband has finally aroused too much fear and suspicion in her native village. While there, she meets and has a brief affair with the ancient Phoenician merchant Hanno (now posing as a Welsh trader), neither of them realizing that the other is an immortal.\n\nI think my favorite chapter, though, is Chapter XI “The Kitten and the Cardinal”. Hanno–now posing as an expatriate Irishman in 1640 AD–is able to arrange a meeting with Cardinal Richelieu, the de facto ruler of France, where he presents him with proof of his immortality. Hanno, spiritually exhausted by his endless wandering, wants asylum, wants Richelieu to offer his protection to the Immortals in return for their knowledge and services. Richelieu, wiser in matters political, warns Hanno that his plan will fail miserably, and lead to nothing but strife and chaos. The Cardinal desires stability above all else, and what could be more disruptive than proof of immortal life? Despite his better judgement, however, he allows Hanno to leave unharmed, fascinated by his story. Just a perfect little snippet of supernatural historical fiction, you could read it without any other context.\n\nAnother connection—and this one successful. Chapter XV “Coming Together”. In 1931 AD, Aliyat and Corinne arrange a cautious meeting in New York. Aliyat is a Palmyrene woman, once a nobleman’s wife in the tumultuous days of the Arab Conquests, now a prostitute, courtesan, and madam for the past fifteen hundred years, one of the few path to independent wealth a woman could pursue. Corinne was born a slave shortly before the American Revolution, escaped to Canada in the 1850s, and has since built a hidden secret society and religion, constructed from elements of Vodou and money inherited from her rum-running lover. In a book that is mostly from a very masculine perspective, it’s a nice look at how women construct their own paths through a hostile world.\n\nMy second favorite chapter is Chapter XVI “Niche”. Set in 1938 AD, Hanno meets with a minor Turkish bureaucrat in Ankara, who admits that he is really Patulcius, a patrician of the Roman Republic, who has been quietly working in civil service through the rise and fall of the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Seljuk Sultanate, the Ottoman Empire, and the Republic of Turkey. So quietly, in fact, that this is the first time in the book that we’ve encountered him. He politely declines Hanno’s offer of joining his international fellowship, and returns to his humble duties.\n\nYou may have noticed that Hanno shows up several times in that, and there’s a reason for that: he’s the closest thing that Boat of a Million Years has to a protagonist. Hanno is the oldest surviving immortal, born in the city of Tyre circa 1000 BC. (He seems to have been the historical Carthaginian Hanno the Navigator, though this is never confirmed). Over the centuries, Hanno becomes obsessed with trying to find other immortals and create a secret society, a task that he pursues fruitlessly for thousands of years, before modern technology and global connectivity allows him to succeed. Where many of the other Immortals are interested in parochial concerns, or mere survival, Hanno’s endless quest provides a loose structure to the novel, and provides the driving force of the plot, to the extant that there is one.\n\nSo, the final chapter of the book is set in “The Far Future”, when (SPOILER WARNING) everyone on Earth is immortal, there’s a post-scarcity hedonistic society connected by cybernetic telepathy, and our characters are all famous. In the end, they become disillusioned with this, travel out into space at relativistic speeds, meet aliens, discover how Galactic society works, solve the Fermi Paradox and do a lot of other stuff. It’s not bad, which is why I included this point in this section. But it feels like a totally different book. It’s a hodgepodge of interesting science fiction speculation about civilization and society and computers and intelligence and how space travel might work, thrown together almost randomly. I enjoyed it, but the book loses something the further away it gets from its original premise.\n\nWHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:\n\nImagine an ancient Phoenician, wandering the Earth for three thousand years, immortal and unchanged. What would he think? How would he live? What would he dream of? To this, Poul Anderson boldly answers: “He’d probably have the same opinions on contemporary US politics as I do.” The chapter set in 1975 is by far the weakest, which is a shame, because it’s also the one where all the surviving immortals unite together at last. The transcendental strangeness and profound mystery loses something when it turns into ranting about the IRS and the peaceniks and how Ted Kennedy is a hypocrite. I’ve read enough Poul Anderson that his politics aren’t a surprise to me, and this is far from the worst libertarian-screed-thinly-disguised-as-science-fiction I’ve read, but the rest of the book is so good that it makes it more disappointing.\n\nI compared the book to The Old Guard earlier, and said this was better. In most respects, that’s true, but I do think one advantage the movie has is its choice to make immortality a completely mystical phenomenon. In Boat it is eventually scientifically solved and duplicated, and I find that a much less interesting choice.\n\nWILL YOU LIKE:\n\nDo you like classic science fiction? Then you should read this! Poul Anderson is an author whose work I enjoy a lot, and I think this is far and away his best work. Even with the last few chapters being a little disappointing, the book stands as a deeply moving and brilliantly written exploration of life, death, and loneliness, a exultation of the human spirit of survival in all situations; from a Greek coracle dashed ashore on the frozen isles of the North Sea, to the perfumed cloisters of a Constantinople brothel, to the shattered steel and concrete husk of Stalingrad, to a starship hurtling across the universe divide. It’s one of the best books I’ve read in a long time, and I’d recommend it to anyone interested in the genre or wants to become interested, or is open to speculative fiction at all, really.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
