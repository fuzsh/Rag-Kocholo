Immune to disease, able to heal themselves from injuries, they will never die of old age—although they can fall victim to catastrophic wounds. They have walked among mortals for millennia, traveling across the world, trying to understand their special gifts while searching for one another in the hope of finding some meaning in a life that may go on forever.\n\nFollowing their individual stories over the course of human history and beyond into a richly imagined future, \"one of science fiction's most revered writers\" (USA Today) weaves a broad tapestry that is \"ambitious in scope, meticulous in detail, polished in style\" (Library Journal).\n\nPoul Anderson (1926-2001) grew up bilingual in a Danish American family. After discovering science fiction fandom and earning a physics degree at the University of Minnesota, he found writing science fiction more satisfactory. Admired for his hard science fiction, mysteries, historical novels, and \"fantasy with rivets,\" he also excelled in humor. He was the guest of honor at the 1959 World Science Fiction Convention and at many similar events, including the 1998 Contact Japan 3 and the 1999 Strannik Conference in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Besides winning the Hugo and Nebula Awards, he received the Gandalf, Seiun, and Strannik, or \"Wanderer,\" Awards. A founder of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America, he became a Grand Master, and was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.\n\nKeith Sellon-Wright is a seasoned professional with a career in Hollywood spanning over thirty years. He has had the good fortune to work with some of Hollywood's seminal directors, including Christopher Guest and Spike Lee. His TV career includes some of the most important shows in TV history, going back to shows such as Wings, Frasier, Seinfeld, and The West Wing. More recently he's appeared on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, NCIS, Mad Men, and Parks and Recreation. The majority of Keith's audiobook work so far is nonfiction, (\"I love what I get to learn!\") but as a lifelong storyteller, he of course loves fiction too. Keith also serves as a \"voice of the New York Times,\" narrating selected articles for the daily audio edition on Audible. He records from a \"killer\" booth he built at his residence in Southern California. The quickest way to Keith's heart-introduce him to a great new wine!"
