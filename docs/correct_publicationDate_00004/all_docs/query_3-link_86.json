        "text": "How big do Gulf sturgeon get?\n\nGulf sturgeon may reach a maximum size of about eight feet and weigh approximately 150-220 pounds. Most males stop growing at about five feet. Most Gulf sturgeon exceeding this length are females. Females grow large and develop a great number of large eggs.\n\nA 503-pound sturgeon (possibly a Gulf sturgeon) was captured at the mouth of the Mississippi River in 1936. In recent decades, the largest reported Gulf sturgeon was a 300-pound fish from the Pearl River, Louisiana.\n\nHow long do Gulf sturgeon live?\n\nThe life expectancy for Gulf sturgeon is between 20-42 years. The oldest age documented for a tagged and recaptured Suwannee River Gulf sturgeon is about 27-28 years. A Gulf sturgeon caught in the Suwannee River in the early 1970s was aged at 42 years.\n\nHow many eggs does a female Gulf sturgeon produce?\n\nAn individual female will produce between 200,000-500,000 eggs per spawning cycle. She will spawn multiple times during her lifetime. However, mortality from all causes, including natural mortality from mishaps, predators, diseases and water quality, will claim most of the eggs, newly hatched, and juveniles before they reach maturity. So, only a very few eggs will eventually become adult sturgeon. Each female only needs to produce two successful offspring during her life to maintain a stable population.\n\nWhat do Gulf sturgeon eat?\n\nGulf sturgeon feed on tiny aquatic insect larvae and other small aquatic invertebrates during the first few months of their life. However, after their first year of life in the river, Gulf sturgeon do not eat while in fresh water. Intensive feeding occurs in estuarine waters or in nearshore marine waters of the Gulf during winter. By feeding on small shrimp, crabs, worms, and mollusks during the winter, Gulf sturgeon increase greatly in weight. Then, from March-April through October-November, they do not feed. Instead, they use energy stored in their body fat and muscle. During the summer-fall period of fasting, sturgeon may lose up to 20 percent of their body weight. This weight loss is more than compensated for during the next round of winter feeding, when Gulf sturgeon may increase their body weight by as much as 50 percent.\n\nDo sturgeon form schools?\n\nUnlike many coastal and river-dwelling fishes, Gulf sturgeon do not school but congregate. Behaving more like herd animals, they gather loosely during the winter feeding period and during the summer fasting period. They may also move in loosely-organized groups during the spring and fall migration.\n\nCan sturgeon bite?\n\nNo, as sturgeon have no teeth. They feed by sucking in their food. Prey is detected by taste and touch by four sensitive barbells in front of the mouth, and by a system of sensors on the underside of their long, flat snout.\n\nWhy do large male sturgeon netted in spring and fall have red, raw snouts?\n\nDuring spawning, which takes place at night, several males may compete for one female. Spawning males repeatedly rub their snouts against the flanks of the female. Their snouts become red, raw, and sometimes bloody from abrasion against the bony scutes of the female. The abdomen of the female also becomes pink or red from the same rubbing behavior. When captured in large mesh nets made of multi-filament twine (instead of monofilament), they are rarely injured in any way. Since a few fish may spawn in fall, red snouts and flanks may also be observed then.\n\nWhy do sturgeon jump?\n\nResearchers have discovered why sturgeon jump. There are two reasons for this activity. Jumping helps the fish equalize pressure in their swim bladder. When the ambient pressure changes during a high or low front, or when the fish move to a different depth in the river, their bladder will expand or shrink. By jumping, they can gulp in air needed to maintain neutral buoyancy. The other reason they jump is to communicate with other sturgeon.\n\nWhen do sturgeon jump?\n\nSturgeon are generally observed jumping during the summer and fall months (May-October). Jumping occurs most frequently in mid-summer (May-early August) in rivers when sturgeon are fasting. Therefore, jumping has nothing to do with feeding. Jumping occurs intensely at dawn and dusk and less frequently in between.\n\nWhere do sturgeon jump?\n\nGulf sturgeon are known to jump in a few Florida rivers, including the Suwannee River. While it is possible for sturgeon to jump anywhere in the river, sturgeon in the Suwannee River are more commonly observed jumping in certain parts of the river where sturgeon gather, referred to as 'holding' areas. Major holding areas in the Suwannee River occur above Jack's Sandbar; below Manatee Springs; between Fanning Spring and Usher Landing; below Old Town Trestle; below the conjunction of the Santa Fe and Suwannee Rivers; near Rock Bluff; and below Anderson Springs. There are a number of less important holding areas.\n\nDo sturgeon attack boats?\n\nNo. As part of their natural behavior in summer holding areas, sturgeon frequently jump straight out of the water, turning sideways and landing with a loud noise. Much like deer hit by cars, jumping sturgeon are sometimes struck by boats. A large sturgeon can weigh more than 100 pounds, so impact with a fast-moving boat can cause serious injury to both boat passengers and the sturgeon alike.\n\nHave people been injured by jumping sturgeon?\n\nYes, people have sustained injuries related to jumping sturgeon. Injuries have resulted when jumping sturgeon have come into direct contact with people and when people have responded to avoid collisions with jumping sturgeon.\n\nHow many people have been injured in the Suwannee River by jumping sturgeon?\n\nBelow is a list showing the number of reported strikes by year in the Suwannee River:\n\n2006 – Nine reported strikes resulting in 11 injuries.\n\n2007 – Seven reported strikes resulting in nine injuries.\n\n2008 – Three reported strikes resulting in three injuries.\n\n2009 – Two reported strikes resulting in one injury.\n\n2010 – No strikes reported.\n\n2011 – Eleven reported strikes resulting in six injuries.\n\n2012 – Two reported strikes resulting in two injuries.\n\n2013 – No strikes reported.\n\n2014 – No strikes reported.\n\n2015 – Three strikes reported resulting in one fatality and five injuries.\n\nAdditionally, there was one reported strike in 2013 on the Choctawhatchee River resulting in one injury and two reported strikes in 2015 on the Santa Fe River resulting in three injuries.\n\nHow can I avoid being injured by a jumping sturgeon?\n\nThe Suwannee River is a beautiful river that should be treasured and enjoyed by everyone. However, the risk of being struck by a sturgeon does exist during the spring/summer/fall months. The best course of action is to go slow, wear your life jacket, and stay off the bow of the boat.\n\nWhat should I do if I am hit by a sturgeon?\n\nIf you are injured, seek medical attention. Collisions with sturgeon should be reported to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission by calling the FWC Wildlife Alert hotline at 1-888-404-3922.\n\nHow many Gulf sturgeon are in the Suwannee River?\n\nBiologists estimate there are about 10,000 adult sturgeon that come into the Suwannee to spawn. Populations in other Gulf Coast rivers range from a few hundred to about 2,000.\n\nWhy are there so many sturgeon in the Suwannee River?\n\nThere are smaller sturgeon populations in other Florida rivers, particularly in the Panhandle, but the largest population is in the Suwannee River. The Suwannee is considered one of the last \"wild\" rivers in Florida. There are no man-made structures or dams on the river and the sturgeon have access to the entire river. Water and habitat quality in the river are good.\n\nWhy do Gulf sturgeon come into the Suwannee River? Aren't they really marine fish?\n\nGulf sturgeon are called anadromous fishes, from the Greek, meaning fishes that travel back and forth between fresh and salt water. They feed in marine waters but they must return to freshwater rivers to spawn in early spring and then they loiter in the rivers until fall.\n\nExcept when they jump, why are sturgeon rarely seen or caught in the Suwannee River?\n\nMuch of Gulf sturgeon behavior, including spawning and the fall migration from the river to the Gulf, takes place at the bottom of the river, in dark tannic (tea-colored) water, or nocturnally (at night). Fingerlings are nocturnal, rarely venturing into shallow water along the riverbank in the daytime, or into the clear waters of spring outflows. In addition, anglers rarely catch larger sturgeon on fishing gear because Gulf sturgeon generally do not feed in the river.\n\nAre Gulf sturgeon found in the smaller tributaries of the Suwannee River?\n\nAlmost all sturgeon species are adapted to live primarily in large rivers. They generally do not go into small streams and tributaries, or do so only briefly for spawning. Although abundant in the lower and middle Suwannee River, Gulf sturgeon are also occasionally found in the upper Suwannee, Santa Fe and Alapaha rivers, and venture only a short distance up the larger Withlacoochee River (a tributary of the Suwannee). In the Suwannee, adults are rarely found above the point where the Withlacoochee River joins the Suwannee River, except during the spawning season.\n\nCan Gulf sturgeon be harvested?\n\nGulf sturgeon are protected by Florida law and listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act. They are protected from fishing or other harvest. It is illegal to keep or injure a Gulf sturgeon.\n\nWhy are Gulf sturgeon protected?\n\nGulf sturgeon have been federally listed as a threatened species since 1991 and protected by Florida law since 1984. These protections were needed to counter the effects of habitat loss caused by river damming and commercial harvesting. Development, surface mining and declining water quality continue to threaten Gulf sturgeon today. Dams on some rivers cut off access to upriver spawning grounds, preventing reproduction."
