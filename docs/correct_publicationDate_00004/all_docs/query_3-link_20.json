        "text": "Ocean Basin Mapping\n\nBathymetry is the measure of depth of water in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. Bathymetry data is used to create maps (called charts) of the seamounts. Bathymetric charts are the equivalent of topographic maps on land.\n\nIn the past, the depth of water was measured by lowering weighted lines overboard. Mapping in this crude manner was mostly limited to shallow waters along coastlines and port harbors. The development of echolocation began during World War 1and was advanced to sonar in the 1920s. SONAR (short for SOund NAvigation & Ranging) is a system for detecting objects under water and for measuring the water's depth by emitting sound pulses and detecting or measuring their return after being reflected off an object or the seamounts (Figure 15-1).\n\nAdvances in submarine and marine warfare during World War 2, and especially the development of advanced nuclear submarines in the 1950s during the Cold War, created an intense demand for more accurate maps of the world's ocean basins. Information from US Navy investigations combined with information from commercial transatlantic communications cable-laying operations were used to create the first details maps of the North Atlantic ocean basin was released in 1957 (Figure 15-2). The first map of the worldâs ocean basins released to the public was in 1977âthese maps ultimately served to initiate research and interpretations leading to Plate Tectonics Theory.\n\nDeep-Sea Drilling and Geologic Mapping of the Seafloor\n\nStarting in the late 1960s, the US National Science Foundation and several foreign countries collaborated with funding the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) operated Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The project used the deep sea drilling ship, the D/V Glomar Challenger. Between 1968 to 1983, this exploration ship drilled 1,124 holes at 624 locations worldwide (Figure 15-3). In addition to drilling and collecting core samples of sediments and rocks, the ship collected geophysical data from the wells and the surrounding seafloor. The data from the ship's activities, and from many other oceanographic investigations since then, have been fundamental to resolving questions about the geology and origins of the world's ocean basins.\n\nMore modern methods used by the US Navy (and other organizations) use side-scan sonar imagery and sub-bottom profiler data to map and interpret the geography and geology of the seafloor. The side-scan sonar instrument is towed below the surface behind a ship and emit high-frequency sound pulses which reflect off the sea bed. This data is used to compile black-and-white map-like images of the seafloor. Sub-bottom profilers emit low-frequency sound pulses which can penetrate into the seafloor. Sound pulses of returning signals from the seabed are captured as the ship moves along, gradually creating a profile of the geology directly below the ship. In addition, sediment samples and photographs taken with cameras on submersible vehicles are used to produce geologic maps of the seafloor. Satellite orbital motions are impacted by subtle differences in the Earth's gravity around such features as mountains or volcanoes on the bottom of the ocean. The Navy used satellite orbit data to compile the first gravity map of the seafloor (Figure 15-4).\n\nFig. 15-2. First published map of the worlds ocean basins and land surface published by Marie Tharp, Bruce Heezen, and Heinrich Berann in 1977.\n\nFig. 15-3. Map showing locations where the Glomar Challenger drilled deep sea wells to sample sediments and rocks from the seafloor.\n\nFig. 15-4. Map of the seafloor produced by gravity measurements from satellite data.\n\nGeologic Map of the Ocean Floor\n\nCollaborative efforts between numerous science organization and governments have led to the first complete geologic map of the world's ocean basins (Figure 15-4). The figure shows the age of rocks on the seafloor in a color spectrum with red being the youngest rocks (recently formed to several million years) and blue being the oldest (about 200 million years). Ocean crustal rocks older that 200 million years have either already sunk into the mantle or have been \"modified\" by metamorphic and igneous processes, and pushed up and accreted onto continental margins bordering the ocean basins. Rocks grow progressively older in age as they slowly move away from spreading centers along mid-ocean ridges. Ancient ocean crust is sinking back into the mantle along subduction zones associated with deep sea trenchesâsuch as along the margins of the Pacific Ocean (discussed below). In contrast, the relatively smaller Atlantic Ocean basin is expanding (slowly growing wider a few inches each year). This motion is pushing continents on either side of the Atlantic farther apart, and subduction zones have not yet formed along the margins of the Atlantic Basin. It could be argued that the Pacific Ocean basin is shrinking at the expense of the expanding Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins.\n\nFig. 15-4. Map showing the geologic age of the seafloor of the world's oceans. Red are youngest rocks and blue are the oldest.\n\nActive vs. Passive Continental Margins\n\nContinental margins typically fall into two classes: active and passive. North America is partly surrounded by both active and passive continental margins (Figure 15-7).\n\nAn active continental margin is a coastal region that is characterized by mountain-building activity including earthquakes, volcanic activity, and tectonic motion resulting from movement of tectonic plates. Characteristics of active continental margins include:\n\nâ¢ They are located mostly along convergent plate boundaries.\n\nâ¢ In most places along active margins, the continental slopes descend abruptly into a deep-ocean trench (there may be no continental rise), or they may be rugged regions associated with large fault systems.\n\nâ¢ Most are located primarily around the margins of the Pacific Ocean (the Ring of Fire).\n\nActive continental margins are characterized by rugged coastlines with narrow beaches and steep sea cliffs. The West Coast of the United States is an active continental margin (Figure 15-8).\n\nPassive continental margins occur where the transition between oceanic and continental crust which is not an active plate boundary. Examples of passive margins are the Atlantic and Gulf coastal regions which represent setting where thick accumulations of sedimentary materials have buried ancient rifted continental boundaries formed by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean basin.\n\nPassive continental margins are characterized by wide beaches, barrier islands, broad coastal plains. The Atlantic Coast of the United States is a passive continental margin (Figure 15-9).\n\nFigure 15-10 is a comparison of general geographic and geologic features on active and passive continental margins. shoreline features associated with continental margins are discussed in Chapter 15).\n\nFig. 15-7. Active and passive margins of North America. The East Coast and North Slope are now passive margin regions located within the greater North American Plate.\n\nFig. 15-8. Active margin: San Francisco Bay and Monterey Bay region has actively rising coastal range mountains and sinking coastal basins.\n\nContinental Shelves\n\nA continental shelf is a submerged nearshore border of a continent that slopes gradually and extends to a point of steeper descent to the ocean bottom. Continental shelves are submerged extension of the continent.\n\nContinental shelves typically have low relief: they usually have less than 1 degree of slope. Average is about one tenth of one degree.\n\nContinental shelves are influenced by a variety of geologic processes, particularly associated with the erosion and deposition of sediments on beaches, deltas, and carbonates (coral reefs). Shallow water coastal and shelf environments are particularly influenced by the impact of large storms.\n\nContinental shelves are commonly cut by submarine canyons.\n\nContinental resources are areas with important natural resources, particularly fisheries, but also oil and gas, and sand and gravel.\n\nDuring the peak of the last ice age, the world's continental shelves were mostly exposed coastal plain environments.\n\nA shelf break is a general linear trend that marks the boundary between the relatively flat continental shelf and the drop off into deeper water on the continental slope. The shelf break generally follows the ancient shorelines that existed at the peak of the continental glaciation periods of the ice age when sea level was as much at 400 feet (120 meters) lower that present sea level.\n\nFig. 15-11. The continental shelf around Florida (shown in red) gradually transitions to the continental slope (yellow and green). Florida displays features of a typical \"passive continental margin\" having wide coastal plains, wide continental shelves, and gentle slopes extending into deep water.\n\nSeamounts, Islands, Atolls, and Guyots\n\nA seamount is any isolated mountain-sized feature that rises above the seafloor. A seamount may be a large tectonic block that separated from a large continental landmass or may be an ancient or even active submarine volcano. A submarine mountain that is partly exposed above the ocean surface is called an island. Many seamounts (and islands) are isolated volcanic peaks rising off seafloor. Many are part of mid-oceanic ridges or associated with oceanic hotspots (discussed below). For instance, the Hawaiian Islands are part of the Emperor Seamount Chain (see Figure 15-18). The South Pacific region is a region with numerous seamounts, of which many are islands, atolls, or guyots (Figure 15-19 and 15-20).\n\nAn atoll is a ring-shaped reef, island, or chain of islands formed of coral, typical on a foundation of an extinct volcano in the ocean. The limestone ring forms along the margins of the volcano. Over time, the volcano either erodes away or sinks below the surface, but the limestone rim continues to grow and expand over time. A guyot is a submarine mountain (seamount) with a flat top. Most guyots are ancient submarine volcanoes that have been beveled by wave action before sinking into ocean depth and may lack the fringing limestone reefs associated with atolls.\n\nFig. 15-17. Formation of ocean-basin volcanoes, atolls, and guyots. Guyots are flat-topped seamounts that have sunk deep enough into cold water so that reefs cannot form.\n\nOrigin of Oceanic Lithosphere and Basins\n\nAt mid-ocean ridges (spreading centers), newly forming lithospheric plates move apart. This creates space for magma to flow upward into the fractures forming along rift zones. Over time, more and more fractures form, they fill with magma, and then cool and fracture making pathways for more magma to flow upward and the process is repeated. This process generates new oceanic lithosphere (ocean crust). In some locations around the world, large mountain-sized blocks of old ocean crust has been pushed up along faults and exposed on landâwhere they are exposed, they are called an ophiolite sequence because they consist of unique varieties of rocks that formed in a sequential order (Figure 15-32).\n\nFormation of Oceanic Lithosphere\n\nZones of active rifting along mid-ocean ridges (spreading centers) are typically 20 to 30 km wide. In some locations, the very hot, fluid lava migrating upward from the asthenosphere (upper mantle) reaches the surface of the seafloor resulting in formation of undersea volcanoes. These undersea eruptions produce pillow basalts - pillow-shaped pods of basalt rock formed where the hot lava cools rapidly when exposed to seawater.\n\nAs new lithosphere forms, older ocean crust gradually moves away from the mid-ocean ridge crest beyond the zone of active rifting and volcanism. Over time, the cooling-shrinking crust increases in density and isostatically sinks lower because it is floating on the asthenosphere. Marine sediments gradually blanket the aging oceanic crust as it moves away from the spreading center. The layer of sediment grows thicker and thicker as aging ocean crust moves away from a mid-ocean ridge.\n\nStructure of the Oceanic Lithosphere: Ophiolite Sequences\n\nThe character of the rocks and sediments on the seafloor are similar in most locations around the world. These materials appear in a pattern called an ophiolite sequence. Ophiolite sequences can be found exposed in coastal mountain ranges and in ancient mountain systems where portions of the ocean crust have been split away and pushed up by tectonic activity. For instance, ophiolite sequences, or portions of them, are exposed throughout the Coast Ranges of central and northern California.\n\nFour distinct layers of oceanic lithosphere (combined are called an ophiolite sequence) â¢ Layer 1: sequence of unconsolidated sediments\n\nConsists mostly of plankton remains (ooze) and fine dust blown in from distance sources including from land (continental deserts sources) and cosmogenous dust. â¢ Layer 2: consisting of pillow lavas\n\nForms from basaltic lava erupting on the surface of the seabed, rapid cooling from exposure to seawater creates the pillow-like structure of the lava beds on the sides of underwater volcanoes. â¢ Layer 3: interconnected dikes called sheeted dikes\n\nNewly cooled igneous rock formed at depth shrinks and fractures as it cool, allowing more magma to inject upward into new fractures in the expanding rift zone along the axis of a spreading center â¢ Layer 4: gabbro (like basalt but slowly cooled at depth) and serpentinite (seafloor crustal rocks altered by exposure to seawater).\n\nFeatures of an Ophiolite Sequence\n\nâ¢ Layer 4: represents rocks derived from the upper mantle or rocks formed from the crystallization of magma derived from the mantle. Rocks preserved in Layer 4 deposits are typically a gabbro of ultramafic composition: pyroxenite and peridotite (rocks rich in olivine and other ultramafic minerals) (Figure 15-33). Over time, exposure to seawater and changes in pressure and temperature, the convert to the metamorphic rock, serpentinite.\n\nâ¢ Layer 3: Magma injected into parallel fractures above magma chambers along spreading centers create a sheeted dike complex composed of igneous rocks of ultramafic to mafic composition (gabbro and basalt) (Figure 15-34).\n\nâ¢ Layer 2: Pillow basalts form from basaltic lava erupting on the seafloor that is flash-cooled by cold seawater into pillow-shaped pods that stack on the seafloor (Figure 15-35).\n\nâ¢ Layer 1: When volcanism ends, marine sediments begin to accumulate on top of the pillow basalts.\n\nThickness of marine sediments on the seafloor\n\nWhere new ocean crust is forming along mid-ocean ridges, there is generally very little sediment. The thinnest layers of marine sediments are generally found in deep-ocean basins near mid-ocean ridges. However, as the ocean crusts ages and moves away from the spreading centers, time allows sediments to gradually accumulate on the seafloor. The blanket of sediment grows thicker and more consolidated as the ocean crust ages. Over time, sediments gradually fill in low places on the seafloor, eventually creating a flat seafloor on many of the world's abyssal plains. The sequence of sediments also increase in thickness in regions closer to continental margins.\n\nAging of oceanic lithosphere results in chemical and physical changes\n\nOnce new oceanic lithosphere forms it begins to cool. The lithosphere is very warm relative to the cold ocean water above it. Large quantities of seawater sink into the new ocean crust and chemically reacts with it. These chemical process are a form of metamorphism. Ultramafic rock (rocks enriched in magnesium and iron) that formed deep in the upper mantle and oceanic lithosphere can gradually be altered into serpentinite (Figure 15-36). Large amounts of serpentinite are exposed in the Coast Ranges of northern California where old ocean crust has been pushed up and exposed in the mountain ranges.\n\nFig. 15-32. Formation of oceanic lithosphere produces an ophiolite sequence (ocean crust) along spreading centers associated with mid-ocean ridges.\n\nFig. 15-33. Gabbro (varieties pyroxenite and peridotite) is a dominant dark crystalline igneous rock type formed in oceanic lithosphere.\n\nFig. 15-34. Sheeted dikes form as magma is injected upward into fractures in cooling lithosphere along rifting spreading centers.\n\nFig. 15-35. Pillow basalts exposed near Avila Beach, central California.\n\nFig. 15-36. Serpentinite (the State Rock of California) is a metamorphic rock derived from altered oceanic lithosphere. This outcrop is part of a large mountain-sized block of oceanic crust exposed in the mountains near San Jose, California.\n\nContinental riftingâthe birth of a new ocean basin\n\nâ¢ A new ocean basin begins with a the formation of a continental rift (example: the African Rift valleys, Figure 15-37).\n\nâ¢ The Red Sea is an example of a rift valley that has lengthened and deepened into a narrow linear sea\n\nâ¢ If spreading continues the Red Sea will grow wider and develop an oceanic ridge similar to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSubductionâthe destruction of oceanic lithosphere\n\nâ¢ Oceanic lithosphere subducts because its overall density is greater than the warmer underlying mantle. Sinking slabs of ocean lithosphere may actually pull more lithosphere behind it. This may be part of the driving forces responsible plate motion.\n\nâ¢ Subduction of older, colder lithosphere results in STEEP descending angles of the sinking oceanic lithosphere.\n\nâ¢ Younger, warmer oceanic lithosphere is more buoyant and angles of descent are SHALLOW.\n\nâ¢ Research indicates that parts, or even entire oceanic basins, have been destroyed along subduction zones.\n\nDestruction of oceanic lithosphere adds new material to continental crust\n\nAs oceanic lithosphere sinks back into the asthenosphere it carries large quantities of seawater and sediment with it. As it sinks, the increased heat and pressure forces water and gases out of the rock. This combination of trapped water and gases allows some of the material melt. The resulting magma that forms is depleted in iron and magnesium, but enriched in aluminum and silica (felsic in composition). This is because mafic minerals have both higher melting temperatures and higher density than felsic minerals.\n\nAs a result this natural refining process occurs... denser, mafic material sinks back into the mantle whereas the molten felsic material (along with trapped water and gases) separate and work their way back to the surface. This results in the formation of volcanoes in the region above where subducting lithospheric slabs are sinking. This felsic material is less dense and becomes incorporated into new continental crust. Over long periods of time, enough felsic material accumulates to build continents, a process that may take billions of years.\n\nFig. 15-37. Map and features associated with African continental rift zones.\n\nFig. 15-38. A plate tectonics model illustrating the formation and destruction of oceanic crust and the formation of continental crust.\n\nCosmogenous Sediments\n\nCosmogenous sediments originated from outer space. Scientists have used satellites to estimate how much material enters the Earth's atmosphere. Current estimates from satellite data suggesting about 100 to 300 tons (mostly cosmic dust) hits earth each day. This is just a tiny fraction of the sediments generated on Earth each day. However, early in the history of our Solar System, Earth and other planets, moons, comets and asteroids formed from the gravitational accumulation of extraterrestrial material, but by 4.5 million years ago, most of this cosmogenous accumulation had significantly diminished. However, cosmogenous materials including iron-nickel and stony meteorites can be found. Although a relatively insignificant source of sediment, meteor fireballs disintegrating in the atmosphere contribute dust that can accumulate measurable amounts in parts of some ocean basins.\n\nExtraterrestrial impacts have changed life on Earth repeatedly, including the mass extinction at the end of the Mesozoic Era associated with the extinction of dinosaurs and many other forms of life on land and in the oceans. Tektites are silica glass generated by extraterrestrial impactsâasteroids exploding on the surface and molten material is ejected into the atmosphere where it condenses into a glass-like material.\n\nIn deep ocean basin settings, far from shore, deposition of sediments may be very slow. Cosmogenous material, mostly in the form of dust particles, are mixed with dust and fine volcanic ash blown in from distant land sources. These deposits form abyssal clay deposits or are commonly diluted by organic-rich mud materials (oozes, discussed below).\n\nFig. 15-39. A meteor fireball (a bolide) disintegrates in the night sky over Oklahoma.\n\nFig. 15-40. Iron-nickel meteorite from the Diablo Canyon meteor crater area, Arizona (see below)\n\nFig. 15-41. A tektite is a ball of glass-like material ejected by an asteroid impact.\n\nHydrogenous Sediments\n\nHydrogenous sediments are sediments directly precipitated from water. Examples include rocks called evaporites formed by the evaporation of salt bearing water (seawater or briny freshwater). Although salts are a major component of seawater, comparatively little of it gets deposited excepted along the shores of shallow, restricted bays along coastlines and in continental interior basins in arid regions of the world.\n\nEvaporites (Salts)\n\nAn evaporite is a rock composed of salt minerals left behind by the evaporation of salty water. Examples include rock salt (NaCl) and gypsum (CaSO4 â¢ x H2O).\n\nRock saltâa rock dominantly composed of sodium chloride (NaCl - the mineral halite; Figure 15-45). Rock salt is an evaporite formed in restricted basins with an inflow of seawater located in an arid environmental setting.\n\nGypsum and anhydriteâgypsum is a mineral composed of hydrous calcium sulfate (CaSO4 -2H2O); an evaporite mineral used in the manufacture of plaster and fertilizers. Gypsum is deposited by concentrated seawater and by evaporation of freshwater in arid regions. Crystals of gypsum are common in soils in arid regions. If gypsum looses its water content, it is becomes a mineral called anhydrite (Figure 15-46).\n\nSalts are precipitated when sea water (or briny lake water) is concentrated by evaporation (Figures 15-47 and 15-48). Shorelines along the oceans in hot arid regions of the world are places where salt, gypsum and anhydrite are being deposited today. Places where salts (evaporites) are actively accumulation include around the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Salt deposits are also forming in isolated, internally drained lake basins around the world including the Great Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea.\n\nIron-Manganese Nodules\n\nIron-manganese nodules form on the ocean bed (mostly in the deep Pacific) from the slow precipitation of metal oxides in the absence of other kinds of sediments. It may take many millions of years for an individual manganese nodule to grow on the deep seafloor (Figures 15-49 and 15-50). Deposits of them cover the seafloor only in regions located very far away from lithogenous sediment sources.\n\nFig. 15-45. Rock salt is the name for rock composed mostly of the mineral halite. Rock salt precipitates directly from seawater.\n\nFig. 15-46. Anhydrite was originally deposited as gypsum with thin layers of organic matter before it looses its water content.\n\nLithogenous Sediments\n\nLithogenous sediments form through the processes of weathering and erosion of materials exposed on land and along coastlines. Lithogenous sediments consist of solid fragments of inorganic or organic material that come from the weathering of rock and soil erosion, and are carried and deposited by wind, water, or ice. Volcanoes and coastal mountain ranges are major sources of lithogenous sediments. Volcanic ash clouds from erupting volcanoes and sediments carried by rivers in flood dump large quantities of sediment into ocean basins. In addition, shoreline erosion by wave action is also a major source of lithogenous sediments in some regions. Lithogenous sediments are also commonly called terrigenous sediments because they are derived dominantly from continental sources. They are also called clastic sediments because they are made up of rock fragments derived from other rocksâa clast is a Greek word for a rock fragment (discussed in Chapters 8 and 9).\n\nLithogenous sediments are:\n\nâ¢ Mostly small pieces of broken rock transported to ocean from the land (wind, rivers, glaciers, coastal erosion, etc.)\n\nâ¢ Generally form deposits rapidly (such as sand on a beach or a river delta)\n\nâ¢ Can form in high energy environments and have coarse grain sizes (coarse sand, gravel, cobbles, and boulders).\n\nâ¢ Beach sand is mostly composed of the quartz (SiO2), a mineral which very resistant to weathering.\n\nâ¢ Most lithogenous sediments eventually are deposited along the margins of ocean basins.\n\nâ¢ Some is deposited into the deep ocean by currents and underwater landslides near continents, and far offshore, lithogenous sediment of fine silt and clays, some as desert dust, forest-fire ash, or volcanic ash blown in by the wind.\n\nFig. 15-51. Sand and gravel on SoCal beaches are typical lithogenous sediments. This view is of South Carlsbad State Beach, California. Lithogenous sediments accumulate offshore, building up continental shelves and flooding int deep ocean basins along continental margins.\n\nContinental-Derived Lithogenous Sediments\n\nContinents shed vast quantities of sediments into adjacent ocean basins. Rivers in flood transport vast quantities of gravel, sand, silt, and clay (mud) into ocean basins. River deltas are vast accumulations of sediment along the boundary between coastal plains and continental shelve, however the deltas exposed on land are only a small fraction of the material deposited at sea. Most of the sediment is carried to sea by flood waters where they are redistributed offshore by wave and currents, especially during major tropical storms. For example, the Ganges River floods each year as annual monsoonal storms drench to Himalayan Mountains and Indian subcontinent. Flood waters dump vast quantities of sediment into the Bay of Bengal in between India and Bangladesh (Figure 15-52). The influx of sediments supplied by the Ganges River supports a large mangrove forest (which traps some sediment to form new land). However, most of the mud continues to move off shore to contribute to a massive accumulation of sediments, many miles deep, along the outer continental margin beneath the Bay of Bengal.\n\nVolcanoes also contribute large quantities of sediments to ocean basins. Thick accumulations of volcanic sediment build up along the volcanic island chains along the margin of the Pacific Ocean (such as the Andes Mountains of South America, the Aleutian Island Chain, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, and others). Volcanoes in the western Pacific region are also subject to severe erosion from tropical storms. Heavy rains from tropical storms produce lahars (volcanic mud flows) and floods that move vast quantities of sediment. For example, the volcanic eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in the summer of 1991 released an estimated 8 to 10 cubic kilometers of ash and erupted materials (Figure 15-53). The ash clouds rose to 35,000 feet into the atmosphere and spread ash and sediments both across the landscape and into adjacent Pacific Ocean basin. The eruption occur the same time that Typhoon Yunka struck. Storm flood waters and mudflows during and after the eruption also dumped vast quantities of volcanic material into the sea. Fig. 15-52. The Ganges River transports large quantities of sediments derived from the Himalayan Mountains region into the Indian Ocean.\n\nFig. 15-53. A massive eruption of Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines.\n\nTurbidity Currents and Development of Submarine Canyons and Fans\n\nA turbidity flows is a turbid, dense current of sediments in suspension moving along downslope and along the bottom of a ocean or lake. In the ocean, turbidity currents can be massive episodic events. They typically form and flow down through a submarine canyon (carved by previous turbidity flows) and accumulate near the base of the continental slope on deep-sea fans. Turbidity flows produces deposits showing graded bedding (Figure 15-54). Slowing turbid currents drop their coarser fractions first (gravel and sand) and the finer silt and clay fractions settle out last. Sediments deposited by turbidity currents are called turbidites. A deep-sea fan is a fan- or delta-shaped sedimentary deposit found along the base of the continental slopes, commonly at the mouth of submarine canyons. Deep sea fans form from sediments carried by turbidity flows (density currents) that pour into the deep ocean basin from the continental shelf and slope regions and then gradually settle to form graded beds of sediment on the seafloor. Deep-sea fans can extend for many tens to hundreds of miles away from the base of the continental slope and an coalesce into a broad, gently sloping region called a continental rise.\n\nGraywacke is a fine-to-coarse-grained sedimentary rock consisting of a mix of angular fragments of quartz, feldspar, and mafic minerals set in a muddy base (commonly called a dirty sandstone or mudstone because of its mixed size fractions and brown appearance). Graywacke is the general term applied to sediments deposited by turbidity flows, and they commonly show graded bedding. Graywacke is common in the Coast Ranges of California and other active continental margin regions. It is exposed on land where tectonic forces push up rocks that originally formed in the deep ocean (example in Figure 15-57). Turbidites (deposits associated with turbidity flows) commonly appear as inter-bedded layers of graywacke sandstone and shale. Conglomerate typically occurs in thicker beds and were originally deposited as gravel and mud on ancient submarine fans closer to the mouths of submarine canyons or in channels carved into the seabed.\n\nFig. 15-54. Turbidity flows are essentially underwater landslides or density-driven currents. Sediments laden with sediment are heavier than clear seawater.\n\nFig. 15-55. Seas stacks composed of submarine channel deposits (mostly conglomerate) exposed at Gazos Creek State Beach, California\n\nBiogenous Sediments\n\nBiogenous sediments include sediments formed by accumulation of organic materials. Biogenous sediments are mostly composed of the remains of organismsâincluding skeletal remains of microplankton (both plants and animals), plant remains (algae, wood, roots, and leaves) and remains of larger animals including shells of invertebrates, such as shells, coral fragments, and fish and other vertebrate teeth, bone, and scales, and fecal material left behind by any type of organism. Biogenous sediments can form in both terrestrial and marine environments. Biogenous sediments may be partly mixed with lithogenous sediments (continental-derived sediments) in coastal regions, particularly where streams and rivers contribute sediments. For instance, quartz beach sand is not biogenous, but ground up an worn fragments of shells is biogenous. Some beach sands consist entirely of shell and coral fragments.\n\nBiogenous Sediments In the Marine Environment\n\nBioaccumulation is the buildup of organic remains, such as deposits associated with coral reefs, shell or bone beds, and algae and ooze (calcareous and siliceous). On land bioaccumulation in swampy environments produces peat beds (with burial and time, peat eventually can be converted to coal). In many passive margin regions in tropical regions, carbonate sediments form and accumulate forming massive deposits along continental margins.\n\nCarbonate Reefs (or Coral Reefs)\n\nA reef is a general name for a ridge of jagged rock, coral, or sand just above or below the surface of the sea. A carbonate reef is one that is made of skeletal material composed of coral, coralline algae, and other carbonate skeletal material. Carbonate reefs are commonly called coral reefs, but not all organisms that look like corals are actually coralsâother organisms that create solid structure (branching or not) include coralline algae, bryozoans, sponges, stromatoporoids, and many other types of invertebrates). Figure 15-58 illustrates the variety of settings and features associated with carbonate depositional environments.\n\nCarbonate (coral) reefs form in clear shallow, warm, tropical marine waters.\n\nOver time, lime sediments are produced by biological activity in and around carbonate reefs. Carbonate reefs grow at rates of 10-30 feet per thousand years. Wave action and currents will erode and redistribute lime sediments offshore where they may accumulate. Over time (millions of years) calcareous sediments build up, creating massive carbonate platforms (becoming regions underlain by limestone that may become strata many thousands of feet thick). Examples of carbonate platform regions include the Bahamas, South Florida, and the Yucatan Peninsula (Figure 15-59 and 15-60).\n\nThe world's largest reef system is the reef tracts, islands, and tidal shoals associated with the Great Barrier Reef located along the east coast of Australia (Figure 15-61). The Great Barrier Reef is composed of over 2,900 individual carbonate reefs and about 900 islands stretching for over 1400 miles (2,300 km) along the northeast coast of Australia and encompassing about 133,000 square miles (344,400 km2). It is the largest feature of biological origin on Earth. Similar reef tracts have formed throughout geologic history in other locations around the world.\n\nFig. 15-58. Calcium carbonate depositional environments include coral reefs, keys, shoals, tidal flats, bays, and other coastal and offshore features.\n\nFig. 15-59. South Florida is part of a growing carbonate platform with the Keys consisting of both ancient and modern reefs, forming a barrier reef complex."
