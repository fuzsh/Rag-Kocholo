        "text": "In this blog post, we share our total expenses as we traveled around America’s Great Loop in one year. This 6,000 nautical mile journey around part of both the US and Canada by boat is typically completed by people who are retired after working and saving money throughout their lives. By sharing our Great Loop costs, we hope to inspire other young couples, families, and individuals to do the Great Loop sooner rather than later.\n\nNote: We use affiliate links which provide us a little kickback each time you use one of our links and make a purchase, without any additional cost to you. We do not recommend products that we don’t already love or have heard great things about, so you can trust we’re only suggesting great products to you.\n\nDuring our first loop attempt in 2021, we received a lot of questions about how we’re doing the loop at a young age (the answer to that question is that we’re both working full-time) but I think the more relevant question was how are we doing the loop in an economical way? This sparked our idea to share our monthly great loop expenses on our website for anyone to read. We want to be clear that the Great Loop can be done for less money than we spent and can also be much more expensive than what we spent this past year. This Great Loop Expense Report is shared as a reference for prospective loopers who are interested in planning for their trip of a lifetime on the Great Loop. We hope you find this Great Loop costs information both valuable and helpful.\n\nNot All Great Loop Budgets Are The Same\n\nCompleting the Great Loop is a completely unique experience as it varies from person to person. The Great Loop is full of a variety of people with varying-sized boats, budgets, and lifestyles. This is by no means the only way to do the loop, but it’s how we did our loop. Just as the Great Loop experience is completely customizable, so is each person or couple’s budget. We chose to anchor more than we visit marinas because it maximizes our largest controllable budget category.\n\nOur time at marinas is typically very focused on getting convenient boat tasks done like washing the boat, filling up our water tanks, grocery shopping, boat work, etc. We found that spending the money to have a reliable and trustworthy anchor setup and dinghy was valuable to our overall budget because it helps us limit our time at marinas which can add up quickly. You can read more about our boat and our ground tackle (aka anchoring gear) here. Elliot also wrote an E-book explaining the electrical system changes we made to make our boat capable of being off the grid for extended periods of time.\n\nWhat Kind of Expenses are on the Great Loop?\n\nTraveling on the Great Loop has many of the same expenses as on land, however, there are a few specific to cruising full-time. We divided up our Great Loop costs into a few categories, including marina, fuel, groceries, housekeeping, restaurants, attraction/tours, insurance, and other. Here are how we made these categories and what is included in each of them:\n\nMarinas\n\nThis category is for overnight dockage or mooring. This could be at a marina, a paid dock, or any paid overnight stays. Throughout our journey on the Great Loop, we saw marinas range from $0.50-6/foot depending upon your location. The northeast, specifically New York City had the most expensive marina, Liberty Landing Marina at $6/foot whereas some of the least expensive marinas were on the midwest rivers at $1/foot. When available, we try to get a mooring ball as they are a fixed price and provide many of the same amenities as a marina, just without the convenience of a dock. Since you’re paying for the marina, a mooring ball typically comes with the marina amenities including showers and laundry.\n\nFuel\n\nThis category of the Great Loop costs is just diesel fuel. Our engine and generator take diesel so we have two large diesel tanks that hold about 300 gallons total. When our tanks are getting low, we begin to shop around for diesel before making a large fill-up. We made a video on Tips for Saving Diesel on an Old Trawler which includes searching for the best diesel prices on Waterway Guide and Cruisers Net. When researching fuel prices, be sure to look at whether tax is included or not. That can affect your overall fuel prices when filling up hundreds of gallons. By doing our homework and searching around ahead of time, we can avoid high fuel prices and can rest assured that we’re getting the best price available.\n\nGroceries\n\nThis category includes groceries, pantry items, large provisioning hauls from Walmart or Amazon, and alcohol. While we lived on land, we would shop around at various grocery stores for deals. Now that we live on a boat, we’re at the mercy of whatever is most convenient to our boat and shopping at whatever grocery store is available. In some cities or towns, there might only be one grocery store in town, while other locations might have several options available. When available to us, we prefer to buy organic, however, that wasn’t always an option.\n\nHousekeeping\n\nThis Great Loop costs category includes things like laundry, propane refills, pump outs, water refills, and tipping dock hands. We primarily wash our clothes in marina laundry facilities. Each load can cost between $1-4 per load, with the average load costing $2 for a total of $4 to wash and dry one load of laundry. Our galley uses two primary fuel sources for cooking: electricity and propane. We have two propane tanks on our boat for our stove top and grill cooking. Fill-ups usually cost around $5-10 per tank.\n\nPump-outs can range from free to $10, however, we usually see pump-outs costing $5. In Canada, pump-outs cost us $15/tank. Usually, water is free with a diesel fill-up or overnight dock stay. While we cruised in the Florida Keys, we paid for water which cost us about $0.10/gallon. Each time we visit a dock, there are usually people there to help catch lines and assist us when docking. We tip $5/person.\n\nRestaurants\n\nPart of the fun of traveling is tasting the delicious food that’s popular in a specific region. This category includes everything from bars, restaurants, desserts, breweries, coffee shops, etc. Anytime we ate out whether it was taken out or dining in, it went in this Great Loop costs category.\n\nAttractions/Tours\n\nThe other part of traveling is seeing various sights and taking tours to learn more about a place. This category will vary significantly from place to place but is something we valued to make the most of our Great Loop experience.\n\nInsurance\n\nPart of owning a boat includes boat insurance. It’s just part of doing business.\n\nBoat Projects\n\nThis category is for all hardware, maintenance items, or engine pieces that are completed on the loop. This can range from boat improvements to maintenance items like an oil change. Basically, anything that’s related to our boat goes here.\n\nOther\n\nThis category is for any miscellaneous items that don’t fit into the previously mentioned Great Loop costs categories.\n\nAnnual Boating Expenses\n\nThese are the boat expenses that we pay for on an annual basis that didn’t make it into our 12 month of expenses for one reason or another:\n\nUS Coast Guard Vessel Renewal $26.00\n\nAquaMaps US and Canada Maps $29.99\n\nBoat US Annual Gold Unlimited Towing $169.00\n\nNebo Link $149\n\nNebo Monthly Subscription $12/month\n\nAmerica’s Great Loop Cruisers Association yearly Membership $79/year plus a one-time joining fee of $15\n\nStarlink Internet $150/month plus $697.68 ($599 plus taxes and fees) one-time fee for hardware\n\nThis totals $3,109.67 of expenses which were not all included in our Great Loop Expense total. We didn’t include some of these items like Starlink internet because they’re business expenses, but since we received so many questions about it, we thought it was important to share.\n\nThe Travel Summary\n\nAmerica’s Great Loop is a 6,000-mile journey around the United States and Canada by boat. It’s typically done in one year, however, it can be extended into multiple years where boaters enjoy a slower pace to enjoy each region deeper. The Great Loop has a ‘standard route’, but also has many options when planning your trip, primarily in the Great Lakes region.\n\nThe trip also can include a few side trips including the St. John’s River in northeast Florida, the Potomac River to D.C., the Rideau Canal to Ottowa, Ontario, the Cumberland River to Nashville, Tennessee, the Tennessee River to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and lastly the Florida Keys. Each Great Loop is different and ours was not an exception, so it’s important to understand where we traveled, how far we cruised, and some specifics in our particular loop experience when thinking about our Great Loop costs.\n\nWe began our Great Loop in Key West, Florida, traveled a total of 5,861 nautical miles, and crossed our wake in Stuart, Florida. During our Great Loop, we choose to cruise through Canada, took the side trip to Nashville, and Chattanooga, and took the Big Bend – hugging the Florida coastline instead of doing the overnight Gulf Crossing. Here’s our Nebo travel summary:\n\nAnchoring has been key to our Great Loop budget. Prior to starting our Great Loop, we created our budget for the trip. There are a few “given expenses” on the Great Loop including fuel, boat maintenance, and boat insurance, but there are a few expenses that are much easier to control. Our Great Loop costs budget required us to stay on anchor more than we spent time at marinas. Spending time at marinas is a reoccurring high expense for loopers, but by anchoring out significantly helps control this expense category. We spent 63% of our nights free of charge – either on anchor, at free docks, or free mooring balls. Anchoring is by far our easiest way to save money on the loop!\n\nThe type of boat you choose to complete your Great Loop with has a huge effect on your budget. The length of your boat will affect your marina budget as marinas charge by the vessel’s length. So a smaller 27 Ranger Tug will have a significantly cheaper marina budget than a 45 Carver or a 55 Fleming. We were in the smaller range of boat sizes with a 34-foot boat since the average looper boat is about 40.5 feet long.\n\nThe next boat characteristic that will determine your budget is the number of engines you have (one or two) and how fast you run your engines. Looper boats are typically categorized into two categories: “go fast boats” and “slow boats.” If someone is hoping to save money on their loop, then reducing their cruising speed from 10 knots to 8 knots or from 8 knots to 6 knots can drastically reduce the amount of fuel they consume. Fuel consumption on a boat is exponentially calculated from how high the RPM of the engines run.\n\nWe bought an old trawler, with a reliable diesel engine that had low engine hours on it. Our boat was a “slow boat” that sips diesel and was on the smaller scale of looper boats, which allowed us to tuck into spaces that larger boats would not fit into. Having a smaller, fuel efficient boat was a great way for us to keep our expenses lower.\n\nMonthly Expense Breakdown\n\nWe recorded our monthly expenses on the Great Loop.
