        "text": "Emily Kallfelz graduated from Princeton University in 2019 and is set to race in the United States W4- later this month at Paris Olympic Games.\n\n1. What inspired you to go to your first rowing practice; was there anything memorable about it?\n\nAt my first rowing practice at Narragansett Boat Club in Providence, my coach asked me to jump into a junior men's quad full of guys who had been rowing for years, and were some of the best junior scullers in the country at the time. I was assured we'd just go paddle around a bit, but then some of the guys thought, why not just try a start for fun. At that point I didn't know what a start was, but we took off at what felt like a million strokes a minute, and three strokes in I caught a boat stopping crab. Of course I was mortified, but we all laughed it off and the next start I think we made it 5 strokes.\n\n2. Was there a practice, race or other event when you fell in love with the sport, or when you knew you might not be too bad at rowing? When you thought you could make the national team?\n\nThere was a period of time in high school where it felt like every single practice and every single race I was improving. Each practice in my single I could go a split faster, keep my blades off the water for 10 more strokes, catch 2 fewer crabs. Since then my rate of improvement has obviously slowed, but I liked the prospect of getting just a little bit better.\n\n3. Best race/practice, worst race/practice?\n\nOne of the most special rowing experiences was sweeping Ivy League Championships in 2019 my senior year. I couldn't really put it into words at the time, but I was just so proud of all of the work everyone had put in. The whole team jumped in the water and lost probably 15 pairs of Oakley sunglasses, but it was worth it in the end.\n\nAs for a worst practice - in October 2020 I was rowing a double in Boston with my teammate and friend Alie Rusher. I had just come back from a few months off due to a back injury, and I had a massive back spasm while rowing with Alie. I had to be dragged out of the boat and couldn't walk for a few days. A week or two later I had to decide to take about a year off of training to heal from multiple disc tears. Coming to the conclusion that I'd miss the Olympics in 2021 and potentially would not be able to row again, was pretty devastating.\n\n4. Best/Anything you've done in the sport no one knows about?\n\nMy sister Eliza and I raced the 2x at U23 world championships in Rotterdam in 2016 and came in fourth. What's most impressive to me is I was 19, but she was 17 at the time. That year was megaworlds, so she doubled up also racing for the US in the junior women's 1x. At the time it was pretty stressful and overwhelming, but looking back, that was pretty gutsy and an impressive showing for someone so young - I think she had been rowing for about a year and a half.\n\n5. Any/Most important advice for young rowers?\n\nI would say keep developing your overall skills - play lots of different sports, push yourself in different ways. Versatility will make you a better rower. And then if/when you decide to really go all in for rowing, focus on the process of improving. Becoming incrementally better and focusing on what is within your control to me is more important and more fulfilling than most medals or achievements. That is often what sets you up for success in the end.\n\nHometown: Jamestown, RI\n\nClub Affiliation: Princeton Training Center\n\nDate of Birth: April 5, 1997\n\nHeight: 5' 11\"\n\nWeight: 158 lb\n\nUndergraduate Education: Princeton, 2019\n\nNational Teams: Nine - Junior, 2014-15; U23, 2016-19; Senior, 2022-23; Olympic, 2024\n\nInternational Results: Finished third in the four at the 2024 World Rowing Cup II...Finished 11th in the quadruple sculls at the 2023 World Rowing Championships...Finished fifth in the double sculls and seventh in the quadruple sculls at the 2023 World Rowing Cup II…Finished ninth in the quadruple sculls at the 2022 World Rowing Championships...Finished second in the single sculls at the 2019 World Rowing Under 23 Championships...Finished second in the single sculls at the 2018 World Rowing Under 23 Championships...Finished third in the single sculls at the 2017 World Rowing Under 23 Championships...Finished fourth in the double sculls at the 2016 World Rowing Under 23 Championships...Finished third in the quadruple sculls at the 2015 World Rowing Junior Championships...Finished seventh in the quadruple sculls at the 2014 World Rowing Junior Championships.\n\nNational Results: Finished second in the double sculls at the 2023 National Selection Regatta...Finished fourth in the single sculls at the 2023 USRowing Winter Speed Order…Won the single sculls at the 2017, 2018 and 2019 Under 23 World Championships Trials...Won the double sculls at the 2016 Under 23 World Championships Trials...Won the single sculls and double sculls at the 2015 USRowing Youth National Championships."
