" Fascinating story. Immortal, but not impervious to violence, several characters maneuver through all of human history, and well into the future, in order to survive. "

" not as good as the hype but still very good. it left me wanting to know what happens next. "

" Very well written story with three or four interwoven storylines that only come together in the last third of the book. It has many of the same issues that plague many Poul Anderson books, notably his heavy handed application of libertarian themes and concepts. "

" this was a good book. it definitely made think. what fun is immortality if there is nobody to share it with and if there is no goal other than survival? "

" A fantastical and grandiose ideas that is marred by Anderson's political interjections and an unwieldy plot. The characters were all distinct and complicated, but the limp ending makes the journey a wild goose chase for all but the biggest fans. "

" Favorite book about immortals - would love to see this as a movie some day. The movie Hanncock could have been partially based off a segment of this story. "

" This work of scifi is boring I could not finish the book because it did not even come close to grasping my interest. From page 1 it is not interesting, the only interest was the title. Reading this piece of work is a challenge for me but I will try to read it again. "

" As I've said elsewhere, I only like this book until the story reaches "present day". After that it's not very interesting anymore. "

" I listened to this as an audiobook and couldn't bear to finish it. The story just seemed like garbage. This is simply science fiction drivel. If you were trapped in a prison cell this might be pretty cool but if you have any options at all there is no reason to choose this. "

" Probably one of my favorite books of all time. I can still remember many of the scenes from this book vividly, something that is very rare for me with books I have only read once. "

" I really really love this book. I've read it a zillion times or so. The themes it explores, such as the logistics of immortality, are realistically and beautifully dealt with. One of the best books I've read in years. "

" The boat of a million years is a very neatly done work about people who don't age. Not immortal, because they can die. They just don't age. It's an amazing and large-scope story. "

— Martin, 6/19/2013

" I want to write the screen play of this book. I have read it 3 times...so far. "

" An interesting story of a group of immortals and their trek through the centuries. Some science fiction is good like Arthur C. Clarke and this book is one of them. "

— Joseph, 2/4/2013

" Should have been better--good premise, following long-lifers/possible immortals through different eras, describing their eventual meetings...came across as ponderous and pretentious to me, and I hate to say something like that about an author I like. "

— Thannasset, 1/17/2012

" The book had promise, but it tailed off toward the end. I was almost 100 pages from the end when I stopped reading - I just didn't care any more. "
