        "text": "1574\n\nImperial Court/Wien​\n\nAs word leaked out further and gossip ran about the court about the portraits from Kleves; Rudolf grew irritated. Rudolf and Ernest, only a year apart, had a good relationship but the thought that Ernest would wed ahead of him irked him somewhat. Ernest for his part felt his father was rushing him away from bachelorhood. The \"negotiations\" were the talk of court, but not only in Wien, word had spread to Graz, Innsbruck and it was well on its way to Spain via the governor in Milan. However it was not all too sensational, Maximilian had made his choice wisely. A marriage to the ducal court of Kleves would not be out of ordinary for the House of Habsburg, it would be similar to that of his and his wife Maria, Philip in Spain and his first wife and Charles V and Isabella of Portugal [*] so it would not arouse much suspicion.\n\nAs he continued his machinations, Maximilian now took to serious thought, whom among his son's would he offer as replacement for a bridegroom for Isabella Clara? He intended for Rudolf to wed Marie Eleonore, this was certain and he would have no dissent on it from anyone; nevertheless he needed assurances that the House of Habsburg remained rulers of the lands they'd acquired both in the empire and in Spain. For Ernest, he intended to place in Further Austria and stipulate that he rule as governor for Rudolf, he would not divide his patrimony like his father did but he needed to ensure his sons were provided for; Matthias was much too like him, he had disdain for the Spanish exuded from him and as such Maximilian did not think he could part with his 17 yr old mini-me just yet. His son, Maximilian, was comfort to his wife Maria; they would hold conversations exclusively in her Spanish tongue much to her elation. This could be a plus, he suspected, Maria could certainly advocate for him. Albert and Wenceslaus his youngest he decided would be raised for the church.\n\nBrussels​\n\nMis-steps by the new governor, Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga, in Brussels had wasted the Emperor's effort at mediation. To his credit de Requesens y Zúñiga was certainly more moderate than the Duke of Alba and had been directed by Philip to pursue conciliation with the rebels but ensure that the most itinerant of them be set as examples. Mediation from the Emperor had been helpful, nevertheless this was a revolt against the King Philip in Spain and the penchant of the rebels towards violence [1] did not help matters. The issue needed resolution, lest it spread to the Empire which had achieved a peace a mere decade earlier [2] was the stance of the Emperor. Spain had defaulted on its debts before in 1557, the revolt in the Nederlands was not be helping matters. Word had spread to Brussels of the strain on the finances of Spain and via Brussels to the Emperor Maximilian.\n\nWien​\n\nMaximilian decided he would now make his move, his son-in-law, Charles IX had passed earlier in the year. His brother, Francis II, too had died young. These were certainly tragedies for their adversarial in-laws but nevertheless could be put to good use. Maximilian II summoned his eldest sons Rudolf & Ernest with the intention that they view the portraits of the cousins from Kleve; not that he was not aware that they'd probably seen them prior, but now they'd view them in his presence......\n\n[1] Beeldenstorm\n\n[2] Peace of Augsburg\n\n[I am focusing mostly on Austria, the Netherlands and Spain for now. I could an commentary on other places as well, but assume they are the same as OTL. France is still dealing with its' wars of religion and is now under Henry III as per OTL following the death of Charles IX.]\n\n1574\n\nWien​\n\nThe Archdukes answered the summons of their father, were the topic of the kleve marriage to come up, they both assumed it concerned Ernest and that Rudolf was there as he would succeed his father as the head of the junior Imperial branch and as such it was an exposure in matters of diplomacy and governance. As they entered the Emperor's office they observed two chairs in opposite sides of the room, one on the left and one on the right, with portraits in front of them covered with cloth drapes such that you couldn't see what was underneath; their mother the Empress Maria arrived shortly after they did, she had an inkling as to what was going on but was surprised by the rooms arrangement .\n\nHe ordered Rudolf to the right and Ernest to the left, and the room cleared of staff. And then he spoke of their grandfather Ferdinand I, and his brother Charles V, their great-uncle. He told them that though they had different opinions from time to time, overall their good relationship, wise council to each other and devotion overall to the House of Habsburg triumphed overall distractions. He professed that he hoped these two brothers would be the same, and come to rely on one another and set examples for their younger brothers. Additionally, he stressed the importance that they both, as well as their brothers remain loyal to the true faith but rule over their subjects in a tolerant manner lest they invite the chaos in the Burgundy[*] and France to Austria. That they be responsible men, their Imperial father said, they would wed and then he instructed them to unveil the portraits.\n\nRudolf viewed Marie Eleonore and Ernest Anna. Both were pleased though frustrated that they appeared to have no say in the matter. Before they could offer any comment or protest, their mother protested. Ernest's marriage was not an issue but Rudolf was engaged to her niece the 8 yr old Infanta Isabella Clara. The Emperor had anticipated this, he pointed to the Infanta's age. \"She would not be ready to bear heirs for another 8-10 years\" By then Rudolf would be in his 30s, his brothers' had no heirs; Ferdinand in Innsbruck son's would not succeed him, Charles in Graz had wed in 1571 but only daughters had survived of the marriage so far as death had robbed him of his first born son; likewise France was in a state of anarchy the death Kings of France and the perpetual regency of Catherine de Medici hobbled them. This was to the benefit of the House of Austria no doubt, but who is to say that it could not happen to his sons', allowing for enemies of their most prestigious house to swoop in for the kill. The Emperor would not have it, the Empress understood he husbands position and that he'd made up his mind. At the very least the girls were still family, they were both close in age to their sons, she would have grandchildren son. The Emperor the said, \"I have no intention to bring discord between the family, Matthias or Maximilian would take the place of the bridegroom, as was done so before us\" [**] He also mentioned a double wedding would reduce the costs of wedding celebrations, financing was always tight; he could tell by her face she thought \"As thought heirs and grandchildren aren't more mouths to feed\" [1] This was another advantage to springing this up on the sons and the Empress at the same time. Maximilian answers' laid out his reasons in such a manner that his sons' couldn't protest; and the last comment on the matter of precedent had sealed the discussion. The immediate parties concerned now knew the decision was made; a double wedding between the House of Austria and the House of Kleves was for all intents and purposes to occur.\n\nWord was then sent to the courts in Julich and the Madrid respectively, Maximilian had also instructed Maria to send word to her brother Philip outlining the reasoning, he sent word to his daughter Anna ahead of time such that when the news arrived in Madrid she would help placate her husband. Maximilian would break the news to his brothers in Innsbruck and Graz, Charles hadn't taken too kindly to being used in such a manner but nevertheless understood that the House of Austria must remain ascendant. There was no love lost between Philip of Spain and Maximilian, but with Maria and Anna to placate and influence Philip disaster might be averted. Besides, though it meant he would not have his daughter as Holy Roman Empress, heaven forbid should the heavens take his sons from him and Isabella were to succeed him her husband would still come from their most prestigious house.\n\nMarriage negotiation now officially began and the Emperor sought papal dispensations for the marriage of his two sons\n\nMadrid​\n\nUpon receiving official word and letters from Maria his sister of his cousins plans to alter the engagements between their sons and his daughter, Philip was furious. This just made the relationship worse, however, Maria his sister had spoken to the qualities of her other sons' Maximilian and Matthias, especially Maximilian. Anna, his wife spoke kindly of her brothers as well and their concerted actions had warmed Philip to the idea. Besides the revolt in Burgundy/Low Countries and the finances of Spain were his main concern. He had two sons, what did it matter. Nevertheless, he would drive a hard bargain. An official response would not be sent acceding to this change, not yet, he then sent word to Maria \"I will not accede to such an agreement until I am assured my daughter will be provided for\" In other words, she was an Infanta of Spain, she could not wed a landless Archduke, despite family ties, if he were to accede to a marriage between Isabella Clara and another one of Maximilian's sons, he would need lands and a means to care for his daughter, additionally the dowry would be renegotiated.........\n\nDusseldorf​\n\nWord arrived from the court in Wien, the marriage negotiations were now official. Marie Eleonore and Anna were now aware of the negotiations to marry their Imperial cousins. The elation and excitement of the mother was visible to them and so they did not protest. Marie Eleonore did not welcome the idea of marrying into the very catholic court in Wien, Anna was ambivalent to the whole thing. Portraits had arrived from Wien of the bridegrooms and Anna now grew attached to her intended Ernest. Marie Eleonore protested to her father but he would hear none of her remonstrations. Her mother and father put their foot down, were these negotiations to go through she would go to Wien, she would behave at court and was to keep her reformed opinions to herself and the privacy of her quarters. Eventually Marie Eleonore came to see this as a mission from God, she could be a useful eye to the sympathies of those of the reformed faith to the Emperor and the son likely to succeed him, Rudolf her intended......\n\nKrakow; Poland-Lithuania\n\n​\n\nThe King was in France, the realms without their King and a crisis had erupted. The Parliament was called and an ultimatum issued. Had he not return from to his elected Kingdom by May 1575, he would be considered to have abdicated the throne and would no longer be King of Poland-Lithuania.\n\n[\n\n[*] Nederlands = Burgundy, will be using Burgundy from now on; scratch that we'll go with Low Countries.\n\n[**] I'm referring to the marriage contract arranged by Maximilian I, for his grandsons to Anna of Bohemia. It didn't stipulate whether it would be Ferdinand or Charles. Eventually to accommodate both demands from Bohemia and Maximilian I's will that his lands be partitioned between his 2 grandsons was it decided that Ferdinand would marry Anna and receive the Austrian hereditary lands.\n\n[1] Per autobiography, finances were pretty bad from Maximilian. He instituted several cost saving measures in his court]\n\n1574\n\nWien​\n\nTactic approval had arrived from the Spanish court on the matter of the modifying the marriage contract, however, preconditions needed to be met. Maximilian had anticipated this, and sent word to his brother Ferdinand in Innsbruck to expect his visit. For what he was about to request of him, a person to person discussion would be best. Word was also sent to the court in Dusseldorf, he requested the presence of his sister in Prague to mark the anniversary of their mothers' death along with instructions that she visit Innsbruck with her two daughters in December...\n\nInnsbruck​\n\nThe Emperor had been arrived in Innsbruck the night before, niceties were exchanged at dinner. Now the next day, Maximilian and Ferdinand moved to discuss matters in private. Maximilian had decided how he would meet the Spanish preconditions but assistance from Ferdinand would help ease matters. Ferdinand's eldest was raised for the church, the younger however needed to be provided for. Maximilian promised Ferdinand that his youngest would be provided for with a secured position in the administration of Hungary and with that a guaranteed pension. Tyrol and the dominions of Further Austria were to pass back to the main Imperial line when Ferdinand returned to the Lord. Upon that, Ernest would administer the County of Tyrol on behalf of the main Imperial line as governor but possessions in Further Austria (Sungdau, Burgau etc) and claims to ancestral lands in Switzerland would go to whichever Habsburg prince that married the Spanish Infanta.\n\nFerdinand was content that his son would be provided for but protested, \"This is far too much of our lands to yield to the Spaniards\" Maximilian agreed but he had his reasons, these lands were necessary for the movement of Spanish troops to the Low Countries since the Duke of Alba began the process in 1567. Maximilian knew Philip was greedy and such as display would surely wet his appetite. It would increase Spanish influence, but it would not enhance their possessions in Germany, after all, it would be the sons' of Maximilian that would rule. Additionally, Maximilian too would not go empty handed, word had spread to Maximilian of Philips' issue of debts. Spain had declared bankruptcy twice since Philip ascended in 1557, for a dowry Maximilian was prepared to suggest territory in lieu of funds and that whichever son he married Isabella be made governor in Low Countries.\n\nWith the agreement of Ferdinand, Maximilian could now reminisce on his youth in Innsbruck with his father and mother. His sister Maria and nieces arrived shortly before December 6, so did his two sons Rudolf and Ernest. The Empress remained in Wien and the rest of the Imperial family. And now feelers were sent out to see how Philip would respond to Maximilian's counter. As he'd done before Maria the Empress and Anna his daughter were informed to do what they could if necessary to influence Philip to accede.\n\nThe introductions of Rudolf & Ernest to their intendeds Marie Eleonore & Anna, appeared to go over well. Maria the duchess of Kleves, made sure to stress to her daughter Marie Eleonore to not offend the Emperor nor her intended. She was aware of her brothers reformed sympathies so that was not a cause for much concern, however, the prince Rudolf and her sister-in-law Maria of Spain were less likely to take as kindly to Marie Eleonore's religious inclinations. Rudolf however, was not too religious and on the family's journey to Prague via Wien, when Marie Eleonore slipped and revealed some of her opinions, Rudolf found it amusing. Likewise Anna had endeared herself to Ernest....\n\nMadrid​\n\nPhilip received word of Maximilian's proposal, he found it suitable. Approval and a contract was agreed. Isabella Clara would wed either Matthias or Maximilian in her 17th year. He did alter the agreement slightly, it was to be known that his Isabella would be appointed governor as his aunt and great aunt had been, this was designed to weaken the authority of the Imperial line and make known in the Low countries, it was he and Spain that were the authority not Maximilian nor his son.\n\n1575\n\nPrague​\n\nThe Imperial family plus the guest from Dusseldorf went to Mass to mark the death of the Emperor's mother Anna. Marie Eleonore had dared not act up since arrival in Innsbruck and maintained good behaviour now in Prague. She had developed a good relationship with her Uncle, and had come to learn of his great admiration the Emperor had of his mother. She had managed to avoid mass keeping it at minimum, after-all they'd been travelling, first to Graz, then Wien, via Moravia and finally Prague. She was beginning to tire of these catholic mannerism and began to doubt if she could go through we the marriage. This mass in commemoration of her grandmother however managed to contain her, she would have to get used to the ceremonies of the Catholic way and keep her opinions on matter of religion to herself. Her uncle assured her he would impose no attempts to sway her from her inclinations but as stipulated in her marriage contract, she would have no role in the religious education of her children, this needed to placate Maria the Empress.\n\nAfter week after the commemoration, word arrived of the Spanish response. Maximilian saw the changes that Philip had made but nevertheless agreed to them. He decided Matthias would be the bridegroom. He'd gotten what he wanted. Likewise, the papal dispensation had come through. The engagement of Rudolf & Ernest, Archdukes of Austria to the ducal princesses Marie Elenore and Anna of Julich-Berg-Kleves were officially announced, as well as the engagement of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia to Archduke Matthias. The double wedding of Austria and Kleves would take place in Prague in April of that year, a grand affair.\n\nBrussels​\n\nLuis de Requesens had occupied most of Brabant and Zeeland, however his mercenaries grew restless. They hadn't been paid in months. He sent word to his Sovereign the King about the increasingly strain situation.\n\n1575\n\nKrakow​\n\nHenry I of Poland-Lithuania was now considered to have abdicated. A new election must be held, the sejm began to consider candidates. The Holy Roman Emperor and was considered. He was of descended Jagiellon descent, however, the some of the sejm didn't like the idea of being attached to another realm after what happened in with the Frenchman. Eventually Stephen Bathory of Translyvania as consort to the elected Anna of Jagiellon was decided as a compromise and to avoid conflict with the Ottomans. However, a separate faction had elected the Emperor anyway and word was already sent to the Emperor in Wien.\n\nWien​\n\nNews of the disputed election reached Maximilian and he began gathering forces to assist in his assumption of the throne of Poland-Lithuania. Maximilian had been in a good mood, both of his daughter-in-laws were with child, expecting children in either February or March the following year. Rudolf had also been elected King of Romans.\n\nParis​\n\nLouise of Lorraine, Queen of France was also with child. A welcome to the court of France, though dominated by the conflicts of religion the affairs the deaths of Francis II & Charles IX had only exacerbated the problem. Though Francis, the Duke of Anjou remain there was worry. If the same ill fate which befell their brothers were to come to the King and his brother the next in line would be the protestant, Henry of Navarre.\n\nMadrid​\n\nThe ulcer that was the rebellion in the Low countries remained and now Spain had declared bankruptcy for the third time since Philip ascended the throne. More troubles had come for Philip that year, Charles Laurence, his second son of Anna had passed. Though fortune had shine upon him again with the birth of a son Diego, the death of Charles Laurence still affected him.\n\n[Nederlands and Burgundy will now longer be used, I shall stick to the Low countries. They have too much either modern or French connotations and create some confusion. I've also changed it in the older thread posts]\n\n1575\n\nDusseldorf​\n\nFortune had shone on the court of Kleves, the duke had married his eldest daughters to the imperial court. His eldest, Karl Frederich, had survived his scare with small pox. Karl Frederich had convalesced in the court of his aunt in Tuscany and recovered early enough to join his family in Prague for his sisters' wedding. He returned to Dusseldorf with his mother Maria. But his brush with small pox had not left him without problems, his breathing would remain tasked for the rest of his days and his winters especially harsh......\n\n1576\n\nWien​\n\nMarie Eleonore gave birth to a twins, a son christened Frederick William, and a daughter Maria Elisabeth. Her sister Anna, too welcomed her a daughter named Maria Philippa. However towards the end of the year the death came forth to claim many in the court of Wien. Within months of each other, Frederick William and Maria Elisabeth would die, in the midst of mourning the Emperor Maximilian II would pass as well. Rudolf II would assume the throne as Holy Roman Emperor and in accordance to agreements made between his father and uncle, installed Matthias as Landgrave of Sundgau. Rudolf would make his court in Prague, though he would spend time in Brno, Poszony and Wien from time to time.\n\nErnest was made governor of the Archduchy of Austria proper. During his time there, he would introduce the tenets of the counter-reformation with assistance from his uncle Charles, some degree of tolerance was permitted to a certain number noble families but this would no be extended to the common people. The Emperor Maximilian had expressed before his death to his sons' \"Be of one purpose, that the house of Austria remain stable & ascendant\" and so Rudolf, Ernest and Matthias would act as the triumvirate of Rome, however it was made clear who the leader was lest conflict consume Austria as it did Rome.\n\nIn Moravia, Bohemia proper and Lusatias' the counter-reformation would also be introduced gradually. Silesia on the other was avoided. Rudolf maintained good relations with the Piast dukes of Silesia and avoided religious matters with them.\n\nParis​\n\nLouise of Lorraine, Queen of France welcomed a set of twins, Charles Henri and Catherine Elisabeth. However fortunate the royal family seemed to be in marital affairs, this did not extend to political affairs. Henry was forced to rescind concessions made to protestants in France.\n\nBrussels​\n\nThe bankruptcy of Spain would now come at cost in the Low Countries, though they had managed to drive back the rebels from Brabant up to the Rhine the mercenaries would sack Antwerp in the winter due to lack of payment. This affair gravely worsened the Spanish position in the Low Countries. John of Austria was made governor, after the passing of Luis de Requesens.\n\nNeuenburg am Rhein​\n\nMatthias would make his main court in the former free imperial city of Neuenburg. Though he was technically a ruler in his own right, the fact his father had pre-deceased his uncle had weakened his hand. In the end, Matthias and Rudolf agreed to yield some lands in Burgau originally meant for him back to their uncle that they be kept for his sons Andrew and Charles.\n\nFrieburg would serve as his second court, and he would spent his time there while fortifications were constructed for the city of Neuenburg. Neuenbrug was chose as his seat mainly because it was equidistant between the the two regions of his Landgrivate; Sundgau and Breisgau. As Matthias settled into his new, conflict arose with the Swiss. Matthias much like his father before him though tolerant to a degree nevertheless enforced Catholicism in his realms. Existing protestant noblemen gained the right to private worship, but conversions from the catholic way were henceforth prohibited. Reformed preachers from Zurich and Bern continued to proselytise in the Landgrivate.\n\nProtests and strong words would be sent over the next few years, Matthias sent word to his brothers & uncles on his issue, however given the how much Spain needed access via the Cantons, conflict was avoided for now. Tensions would continue to bubble between the Landgrave and the Swiss confederacy. Matthias would organise defences and ordered the arrest of any Swiss preacher in the Landgrivate. Matthias also attempted to establish alliances with the catholic cantons in the confederacy though this failed. Nevertheless an agreement was made between the Archducal houses to the exclusion of Spain to a matter of mutual defence in the event of conflict with the swiss......\n\n[Heads up, time jump to 1579/1580 is in the cards]\n\n​\n\n1579\n\nNeuenburg am Rheim/Freiburg​\n\nThe war would come to be known as the Jesuit war or Winterthur conflict due to the initial pretext being the murder of Jesuits in Winterthur. Thurgau would to join Zurich in the hopes of acquiring Konstanz. Landgrivate forces repelled the Zuricher siege of Konstanz and the Bernese seige of Rheinfelden. Meanwhile Archduke Matthias accumulated a force of soldiers and mercenaries in Neuenberg. These forces combined were about 5000; about 1000 under Archduke Albrecht were sent via ship down the Rhine and the remaining 4000 under Archduke Matthias would link up with forces from Tyrol, Carinthia & Austria proper to relieve Konstanz.\n\nFollowing the relief and Battle of Konstanz, were Zurich & Thurguan forces were repelled, a stalemate ensued between the confederacy and the Habsburg forces. Archduke Albrecht's distraction campaign had proven successful and Bernese forces had to leave Rheinfelden to defend their territory. At this junction a new development, the entry of the Duchy of Savoy. Savoy declared war on the city of Geneva. Bern, were now distracted even further.\n\n1580\n\nBrussels​\n\nAlexander Farnese, would gain success where his predecessors had failed, through series of lightening campaigns until 1583, he would reclaim much of the low countries up to the River Waal most famously the city of Nijmegen. From that point, word was sent to Alexander to reclaim Zeeland so as to re-secure Antrewpen. Defences were shored up on the Waal, and lands between the Waal and Lek would see devastation and despoliation for years by Spanish and Dutch alike. As the Spanish mainland was focused on the Portuguese crisis at the time, shipbuilders were brought in from Genoa and a small fleet was constructed on the Lys. Later in 1583, the Duke of Parma would move his forces from the Lys via the Scheldt and begin a successful campaign to re-occupy most of Zeeland.\n\nNeuenburg am Rheim/Freiburg​\n\nThe distraction provided by the duchy of Savoy was most opportune for Habsburg forces. A small defensive force was left in Konstanz and the army under Archduke Matthias moved and took Stein in the Spring of 1580. From there they moved in and seized Frauenfeld. Meanwhile Archduke Albrecht moved his armies and took Brugg which had suffered from the plague in 1541. He then moved and made base in the ancestral castle at Habsburg.\n\nMatthias having made base in Fraunfeld moved on Winterthur. Generous terms had been offered to Kyburg and Baden and so these cities defected. Winterthur would fall following a 2 month siege and a great deal of brutality befell the city. About a quarter of its population would die and the entirety of it's city council were executed, held responsible for the death of the Jesuits. A final battle occur between Habsburg & Swiss forces before the city of Zurich. Zuricher forces were victorious in the 1st and 2nd battles in the summer of 1581 hoping to hold out until the harsh Swiss winter would push back Habsburg forces. However the fate of the Winterthur conflict was sealed following the 3rd Battle of Zurich. The Swiss forces were routed completely, of an army of 1000, 300 would survive. At this junction peace negotiations began, the Swiss were forced the yield parts of the olde county of Kyburg, Landgrivate of Thurgau and County of Baden; and pay indemnities. This would be Albrecht and Matthias's launch pads, for they had secured their ancestral Castle of the House of Habsburg. Matthias would remain in Freiburg after negotiation while Albrecht was made governor of Matthias's newly re-acquired territories and would base himself in Frauenfeld. The French meanwhile taken aback by Habsburg success in Switzerland moved to intervene against Savoy and forced a peace between Savoy, Bern and Geneva; enhancing French influence in the region.\n\nThe Counter-Reformation would be introduced to the region prompting some protestants to leave. They were replaced by catholics from protestant cantons.\n\n[Behind the black lines are territories yielded to Matthias. Lindau would be given to Archduke Ferdinand in Innsbruck. Side note Philippine Wesler is alive. This is a religious map of Switzerland circa 1536. Source link is Reformation in Switzerland Page on Wikipedia]\n\n1581\n\nDusseldorf​\n\nThe winter of 1581 would not take kindly to the court of Dusseldorf, both the duchess Maria and the treasured her Karl Friedrich would pass. Duke William was utterly devastated, not only had he lost his wife, his precious heir too was gone. He despised his younger son John William, however the need to secure his house prompted him to finally organise a marriage for him. Jakobea of Baden would marry John William in 1585."
