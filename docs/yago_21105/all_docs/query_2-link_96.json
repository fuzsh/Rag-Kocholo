        "text": "Following the resounding success of ELISABETH, VBW again turned to the Austrian Habsburg dynasty as an inspiration for yet another remarkable dramatic musical masterpiece. Using modern music and choreography, RUDOLF – AFFAIRE MAYERLING is based on the tragic fate of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, son and heir-apparent of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth (the legendary “Sisi”). Aged only 30, he died an early death by his own hand.\n\nHis death, along with that of his 17-year-old mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera, at his Mayerling hunting lodge in 1889 made international headlines. Whether the sensitive and liberal-minded aristocrat’s suicide was sparked by an unhappy love affair, his loveless marriage to his wife, Crown Princess Stephanie, the rejection by his austere father and his absent mother or even a political intrigue set up by his mighty adversary, Austrian Prime Minister Count Eduard Taaffe remains obscure to this day, making the incident one of the most fascinating and haunting myths and mysteries of Austrian and European history.\n\nIn a similar vein to its predecessor, ELISABETH, this enthralling musical drama combines elements of powerful universal appeal: an absolutist ruler, his sensitive and troubled son, an empire on the eve of its decline, the clash of an upcoming 20th century with its new liberal and social ideas against an expiring 19th century still steeped in strict feudal tradition – and the fateful conflict between personal happiness and public duty. Based on Frederic Morton’s bestselling novel A Nervous Splendor, RUDOLF brings this dramatic, mysterious and darkly romantic episode in Austrian history to spectacular new life. Drawing from the book’s historical backdrop, Frank Wildhorn, composer of the worldwide hit musical JEKYLL & HYDE, and renowned author Jack Murphy created a romantic chef d’oeuvre full of longing and passion.\n\nRUDOLF paints a riveting portrait of the young prince as a liberal thinker and sensitive social reformer, carrying an entire empire’s hopes for an open, modern and socially aware Europe. Yet at the same time he is destined to be crushed by a rigidly old-fashioned and stultifying social environment based on rigid conservative values, represented by his obstinate father Franz Joseph I. Still, Rudolf strives to pursue his own idealistic path until his final defeat, riddled by nagging doubts and accompanied by his teenage lover, Baroness Mary Vetsera, a loyal and beautiful kindred spirit who shares his vision. Leading an ill-fated double life, both politically and privately, Rudolf finds himself trapped by the ruthless and powerful Prime Minister Count Eduard Taaffe, who insidiously puts his knowledge of the Crown Prince’s secret political activities to use to ruin his career – and as a consequence, his life.\n\nRUDOLF does not attempt to explore in detail the backgrounds of this historical and personal tragedy. Instead, the ideological and romantic motives are represented by wonderfully sweeping melodies, passion-filled ballads and marvellously evocative stage sets and lighting design. The precise circumstances of the infamous “Mayerling Affair” and the deaths of Rudolf and Mary remain mysteriously shrouded in darkness – just as they will forever be in real life.\n\nThe first foreign premiere by VBW, RUDOLF – AFFAIRE MAYERLING opened as a licensed production in Budapest in May 2006. In spring 2008 the Japanese version opened at the Imperial Theatre in Tokyo. The German-language version ran at the Raimund Theatre in Vienna from 2009 to 2010 followed by productions in Hungary (Pécs, 2010 - 2012) and South Korea (Seoul and Tour): 2012 – 2013; 2014 – 2015 and 2017 - 2018 (en suite). In Korea and in Japan RUDOLF – AFFAIRE MAYERLING runs under the title THE LAST KISS.\n\nThe Viennese production, directed by British multi-Tony Award nominee David Leveaux (FIDDLER ON THE ROOF) underscores VBW’s policy of focussing on original productions in a compelling way. One of this production’s most remarkable features is an impressive revolving stage section, allowing set designer Mike Britton (Royal Shakespeare Company, numerous Shakespeare plays) to create scenes with tremendous vibrancy and movement, such as the opulent Ringstrasse and iceskating scenes.\n\nThe atmospheric lighting that heightens the tension as the web is drawn ever more tightly around the two hapless lovers is designed by one of world’s true masterminds in the field: Patrick Woodroffe, whose credits read almost like a Who’s Who of rock, classical and stage music: ABBA, Bob Dylan, The Police, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Van Morrison, the Rolling Stones, Phil Collins, Depeche Mode, Tina Turner, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the English National Ballet, Son et Lumière in the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, Cirque du Soleil, the Millennium Dome in London and Michael Jackson’s This is It tour and film.\n\nAbove all, the musical is characterized by dramatic ballads that powerfully convey a huge range of emotions, from anger, despair and gnawing uncertainty to tender love, joie de vivre and revolutionary fervor. And thus, the magnificent yet fragile Habsburg Empire slowly crumbles in time to the beguiling notes of the Viennese waltz ..."
