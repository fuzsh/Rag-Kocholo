        "text": "King of the Germans\n\nRudolf was crowned in Aachen Cathedral on October 24, 1273. To win the approbation of the Pope, Rudolf renounced all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade. Pope Gregory X, despite the protests of Ottokar II of Bohemia, not only recognised Rudolf himself, but persuaded King Alfonso X of Castile (another grandson of Philip of Swabia), who had been chosen German (anti-)king in 1257 as the successor to Count Willem II of Holland, to do the same. Thus, Rudolf surpassed the two heirs of the Hohenstaufen dynasty whom he had earlier served so loyally.\n\nIn November 1274, the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg decided that all Crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Friedrich II must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognising the new king. Ottokar refused to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia together with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden.\n\nRudolf refuted Ottokar’s succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the Imperial crown due to the lack of male-line heirs. King Ottokar was placed under the imperial ban; and in June 1276 war was declared against him.\n\nHaving persuaded Ottokar’s former ally Duke Heinrich XIII of Lower Bavaria to switch sides, Rudolf compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then re-invested Ottokar with the Kingdom of Bohemia, betrothed one of his daughters to Ottokar’s son Wenceslaus II, and made a triumphal entry into Vienna.\n\nOttokar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, and procured the support of several German princes, again including Heinrich XIII of Lower Bavaria. To meet this coalition, Rudolf formed an alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and gave additional privileges to the Viennese citizens. On August 26, 1278, the rival armies met at the Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. The Margraviate of Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolf’s representatives, leaving Ottokar’s widow Kunigunda of Slavonia in control of only the province surrounding Prague, while the young Wenceslaus II was again betrothed to Rudolf’s youngest daughter Judith.\n\nRudolf’s attention next turned to the possessions in Austria and the adjacent provinces, which were taken into the royal domain. He spent several years establishing his authority there but found some difficulty in establishing his family as successors to the rule of those provinces. At length the hostility of the princes was overcome.\n\nCoat of Arms of Rudolf as King of Germany\n\nIn December 1282, at the Hoftag (imperial diet) in Augsburg, Rudolf invested his sons, Albrecht and Rudolf II, with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolf Duke of Swabia, a merely titular dignity, as the duchy had been without an actual ruler since Conradin’s execution.[citation needed] The 27-year-old Duke Albrecht, married since 1274 to a daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol (1238–95), was capable enough to hold some sway in the new patrimony.\n\nIn 1286, King Rudolf fully invested Albert’s father-in-law Count Meinhard with the Duchy of Carinthia, one of the conquered provinces taken from Ottokar. The Princes of the Empire did not allow Rudolf to give everything that was recovered to the royal domain to his own sons, and his allies needed their rewards too.\n\nTurning to the west, in 1281 he compelled Count Philip I of Savoy to cede some territory to him, then forced the citizens of Bern to pay the tribute that they had been refusing. In 1289 he marched against Count Philip’s successor, Otto IV, compelling him to do homage.\n\nIn 1281, Rudolf’s first wife died. On February 5, 1284, he married Isabella, daughter of Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy, the Empire’s western neighbor in the Kingdom of France.\n\nRudolf was not very successful in restoring internal peace. Orders were indeed issued for the establishment of landpeaces in Bavaria, Franconia and Swabia, and afterwards for the whole Empire. But the king lacked the power, resources, and determination to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an expedition into Thuringia, where he destroyed a number of robber castles.\n\nIsabella of Burgundy\n\nIn 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. The electors refused, however, claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality, perhaps, wary of the increasing power of the House of Habsburg. Upon Rudolf’s death they elected Count Adolf of Nassau.\n\nDeath\n\nRudolf died in Speyer on July 15, 1291 and was buried in Speyer Cathedral. Although he had a large family, he was survived by only one son, Albrecht, afterwards the German king Albrecht I. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from Katharina who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.\n\nRudolf’s reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern part of the realm. In the other territories, the centuries-long decline of Imperial authority since the days of the Investiture Controversy continued, and the princes were largely left to their own devices.\n\nRudolf’s last legitimate agnatic descendant was Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress (1717–1780), by Albrecht I of Germany’s fourth son Albrecht II, Duke of Austria."
