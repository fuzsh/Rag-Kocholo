        "text": "1122: Background: The Concordats of London and Worms[]\n\nThe Investiture Controversy, which had torn apart Germany since 1079, had weakened imperial control in favor of local lords, was settled by the Concordat of Worms, which was modelled on the Concordat of London (1107), between Pope ? and Henry I of England, father-in-law of Emperor Henry V. The Concordat of London distinguished between secular and ecclesiastical powers of prelates. Henry I of England was not especially weakened by the Concordat of London, since William I of England had ensured that none of his vassals had substantial local control. Henry I of England then appointed secular scholars, who had minor orders, to bishoprics so that they would depend on him and the royal power would grow stronger.\n\nThe Concordat of Worms was similar in principle to the Concordat of London. Election of bishops and abbots in Germany would occur in front of the Emperor, who would judge any disputes and ensure that there were no bribes. In Burgundy and Italy, outside the Empire, the Emperor would send symbols of authority to newly elected bishops within six months. The Emperor renounced the right to invest bishops with the ring and crosier and guaranteed free election and consecration.\n\nThe half-century of strife in Germany had diminished the royal coffers, transferred juridical rights to local lords, while lay piety had increased, setting a stage for the use of Crusade against Emperor Frederick II .\n\n1123: The First Council of the Lateran confirmed the Concordat of Worms.\n\n1124: Emperor Henry V impregnated Maud of England.\n\n1125: Birth Pains[]\n\nIn 1125, Emperor Henry V died, leaving his wife Maud of England pregnant. If Maud bore a girl, the Imperium would be up for grabs; if she bore a boy, it would be more chancy to wrest the Imperium from the Salian dynasty.\n\nLothair I, Duke of Saxony, with the aid of the Archbishop of Mainz, positioned himself as a candidate for election as King of Germany if Maud’s child should be a girl. Lothair I had first aided Henry V to rebel against his father Emperor Henry IV and become Emperor, but later rebelled against Henry V.\n\nFrederick II, Duke of Swabia, championed heredity regardless of the gender of the child. This was not mere kin-loyalty: Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, and his full brother Conrad I, Duke of Franconia, were the sons of Agnes of Germany, sister of Emperor Henry V. If the child was a girl, they could claim the Imperial dignity and possibly an imperial princess as bride; if the child was a boy, they stood a good chance of achieving guardianship and influence.\n\nLeopold III the Holy, Margrave of Austria (a Babenberg), declined a candidacy for Emperor and supported the pro-heredity party.\n\nEmpress Maud gave birth to a boy, Henry, who was surnamed Postumus for the time being. Maud made a deal with Henry I of England and Stephen of Blois - she would relinquish her claim on England if England would support her son, Henry, as King of the Romans and later Emperor.\n\nEmpress Maud and her supporters claimed that Henry Postumus became Henry VI, King of the Germans, at his birth, since his grandfather, Henry IV, had become Emperor when he was six.\n\nThe pro-election party claimed that an Emperor ought to be able to defend his realm.\n\nPope Honorius II supported Henry VI in the hopes of influencing the infant emperor’s education.\n\nIn late 1125, the nobles of the Empire expressed their support for Henry VI. Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, and Conrad I, Duke of Franconia, became joint regents for Henry VI. Lothair I lost the election. The detractors chose Lothair I, Duke of Saxony, as anti-king Lothair III.\n\n1126-9: Staufen vs. Welf[]\n\n1126: Henry the Proud (a Welf) became Henry X, Duke of Bavaria upon the death of his father Henry the Black, Duke of Bavaria. The Bavarian-Saxon alliance rivaled that of the Staufen-Salian alliance.\n\n1127: Henry the Proud, Duke of Bavaria, wed Gertrude, only child of anti-king Lothair III. As a result, the imperial regents stripped Henry the Proud of the Duchy and invested the Duchy on Leopold the Generous, son of Leopold III the Holy, Margarve of Austria, as Leopold I, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nA group of nobles in Regensburg agreed that anti-king Lothair III should attempt to seize the imperial lands which the Staufen Dukes of Swabia and Franconia were holding on behalf of their cousin Henry VI, King of the Romans.\n\nThe Staufen Dukes, naturally, resisted. As result, anti-king Lothair III undertook the following actions: Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, was placed under imperial ban; Conrad was stripped of the Duchy of Franconia; the rectorate of Burgundy was passed to Conrad, Duke of Zähringen (the family remained rectors of Burgundy until 1218).\n\nThe Staufen, however, had support in their own lands, many imperial cities, Austria, and most of Lower Lorraine.\n\n1129: Anti-king Lothair III captured the pro-Staufen cities Speyer and Nürnberg. Empress Maud fled to England, where her father King Henry I of England agreed to help in his grandson’s education. Pope Honorius II was not happy about this. The Dukes of Swabia and Franconia remained to fight anti-king Lothair III.\n\n1130: Anacletus, The Unpopular Anti-Pope[]\n\n1130: Pope Honorius II died. Although Pietro Pierleone, a descendant of Jewish converts, had more local support for the position of Pope, Pierleone’s political rivals could not condone his candidadacy and forced the election of Gregorio Paparechi as Innocent II. Pierleone’s supporters thereupon elected him as Anacletus II. Anacletus II gained the support of Roger II, new “King” of Sicily, and Duke William X of Aquitaine. Most European rulers, however, including anti-king Lothair III, supported Innocent II, whose most persuasive advocate was Bernard of Clairvaux. Anti-king Lothair III acknowledged Innocent II in October. Anti-king Lothair III even refused Anacletus II’s offer to crown him emperor. Roger II of Sicily\n\n1131: January: Innocent II visited Henry I of England and made a favorable impression despite the presence of Empress Maud and young Henry VI, king of the Romans.\n\n1132: August: Anti-king Lothair III announced his intention to set out for Rome to crown Innocent II. Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, and Conrad of Franconia opposed this journey, but Lothair III compelled the brothers to come with him.\n\n1133: June 4: Lothair III crowned Innocent II, who then crowned him Emperor Lothair II. Henry I of England and Henry VI, King of the Romans, refused to recognize Anti-emperor Lothair II.\n\n1135: Staufen Defection and Stephen's Doubt[]\n\n1135: The Reichstag at Bamberg restored all non-imperial lands to the Staufen brothers, while they acknowledged Emperor Lothair II as legitimate. This was a severe blow for Henry VI, King of the Romans. Maud suspected that Stephen of Blois would renege on his agreement to support Henry VI, King of the Romans. Stephen suspected that Maud would renege on her relinquishment of her son’s title to the throne England, now that the Imperial dignity seemed out of reach. Maud asked for a ship, but Henry I of England, who had already lost an heir to the English Channel, refused and kept her under guard.\n\nDecember 1: Henry I of England died and Stephen of Blois became King of England. The tension between Stephen and Maud was so great that she risked the crossing with her son and fled to her Duchy of Normandy.\n\nAlso in 1135: Eric II of Denmark (June 25 1135-September 18, 1137) became a vassal of the anti-Emperor Lothair II. Boleslaus III, Duke of Poland (r. 1102-1138), recognized Lothair II as his overlord in Pomerania, Poland, and Rügen.\n\n1136: An Innocent In Italy[]\n\n1136: Anti-emperor Lothair II led an army to Italy again to try to win Rome for Innocent II. Henry the Proud of Bavaria led a second army. The German troops rebelled against fighting in the summer, thereby ensuring the failure of the campaign.\n\nAlso in 1136, Lothair II invested the Margraviate of Lausitz on Conrad the Great of Wettin, Margrave of Meissen, permanently uniting the two Margraviates.\n\n1137: December: Anti-emperor Lothair II died while crossing the Alps back into Germany. Before he died, he gave the Duchy of Saxony and the imperial regalia to his son-in-law Henry the Proud, Duke of Bavaria.\n\n1138: Two Henrys and a Conrad[]\n\n1138: January 25: Anti-Pope Anacletus II died. Bernard of Clairvaux convinced the supporters of Anacletus II to give support to Pope Innocent II.\n\nHenry the Proud, Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, was the logical candidate to be become Emperor. Henry the Proud nearly undermined his own cause through his arrogance. The Staufen faction proposed Conrad I, Duke of Franconia, but the hesitation which Conrad had displayed on numerous occasions weighed against him. Henry, Duke of Normandy, was not even considered. Henry the Proud became anti-Emperor Henry VI.\n\nMeanwhile, Henry, Duke of Normandy (age 13), was spending time at the French court, with the new king of France (r. 1137-1180), Louis VII the Young (age 18), and his new wife Eleanor, heiress of Aquitaine (age 14). Eleanor soon was more taken by Henry, Duke of Normandy, than her own husband.\n\n1139: The Norman Election[]\n\n1139: Oct 20: Anti-Emperor Henry VI the Proud died. Henry the Proud’s son Henry the Lion became Duke Henry III of Saxony and XII of Bavaria, but was only ten years old. The Staufen camp, having failed twice in its own candidacy, made amends with Henry, Duke of Normandy, and presented the fourteen-year-old as a candidate for King of the Romans. Since Henry the Lion was Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, and the Dukes of Franconia and Swabia were the Staufen brothers, the effective decision lay in the hands of the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne.\n\nStephen, King of England, provided money for bribing the archbishops so that he would no longer have to worry about a potential claimant to the throne of England living directly across the channel. Louis VII of France gave money to Henry, Duke of Normandy, and married him to his sister Constance of France (1124-1176) so that Henry, Duke of Normandy, would stay away from his wife Eleanor. Henry, Duke of Normandy, was confirmed as Henry VII, King of the Romans, over Henry the Lion.\n\nDespite Henry of Normandy’s successful election, his problems were far from over. He was in debt to the Church in a way which he had hoped to avoid. Adalbert II of Saarbrücken, Archbishop of Mainz, whose predecessor Adalbert I had been instrumental in blocking the election of the infant Henry, Duke of Normandy, had been wooed to Henry of Normandy’s cause by great territorial concessions. His defeated opponent was extremely powerful in “his” kingdom, controlling two stem Duchies.\n\nHenry VII, King of the Romans, claimed that it was illegal for tow Duchies to be held by one individual and divested Henry the Lion of both Saxony and Bavaria. Henry VII, King of the Romans, invested the Duchy of Bavaria on Leopold IV the Generous, Margrave of Austria (d. October 21, 1141). He also invested the Duchy of Saxony on Albert the Bear, the former Margrave of Lusatia, and a loyal vassal of Anti-Emperor Henry VI the Proud, provided that Albert could capture it.\n\nAlthough Leopold the Generous managed to control Bavaria with the aid of his brother Otto, Bishop of Friesing, Albert the Bear failed miserably and was forced to flee to the southern duchies. Although Leopold the Generous managed to control Bavaria with the aid of his brother Otto, Bishop of Friesing, Albert the Bear failed miserably and was forced to flee to the southern duchies. Henry of Normandy, also called Curtmantle, summoned Robert, First Earl of Gloucester, from England to support him.\n\n1141: Emperor at Last[]\n\nBy the end of 1141, both Adalbert II, Archbishop of Mainz, and Leopold, Duke of Bavaria, were dead. Leopold’s successor was his brother Henry XI Jasomirgott, Duke of Bavaria, Margrave of Austria. Adalbert II’s successor as Archbishop of Mainz was Markholf. Henry VII Curtmantle confirmed these men’s titles in exchange for his election as Emperor Henry VI. Henry XI Jasomirgott’s former office of Count Palatinate of the Rhine was conferred on Robert FitzRoy, First Earl of Gloucester (d. 1147).\n\n1142: Saxon Daggers Withdrawn[]\n\nAlbert the Bear and Henry the Lion came to terms over the Duchy of Saxony. Albert the Bear conceded his claim to Saxony to Henry the Lion. Emperor Henry VI Curtmantle made Albert the Bear Arch-Chamberlain of the Empire, Count of Weimar and Orlemuende.\n\n1142-44: The French Champagne War[]\n\nIn 1142, Petronilla of Aquitaine, sister to Queen Eleanor of France, met Count Raoul I of Vermandois, a cousin of Louis VII of France. Raoul I was so smitten that he repudiated his wife, the niece of Count Theobald II of Champagne/IV of Blois, brother to King Stephen of England. Raoul then married Petronilla. Pope Innocent II excommunicated Raoul. The religious Louis VII was outraged and sent his brother to invade Vermandois. Innocent II promised to lift the excommunication, but reneged in 1143. During this war, Louis VII burned Vitry, including the church where many people had taken refuge. On September 24, 1143, Innocent II died. His successor was Guido di Castello, a pupil of Abelard, who became Celestine II. At the Council of Reims in 1144, Celestine II absolved Louis VII of France before dying on March 8 of that year.\n\nPapal Power Struggles[]\n\nOn March 8, 1144, Pope Celestine II died. His successor, Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso, had been Papal legate in Germany for Honorius II and Innocent II and had possessed influence over Anti-emperor Lothair II. Caccianemici dal Orso was crowned Pope Lucius II on March 12. He met in 1144 with King Roger II of Sicily to clarify Roger II’s duties as a Papal vassal. Roger II made unreasonable demands, which Lucius III refused. Roger then forced Lucius to accept his terms. The Roman Senate, which had assumed all temporal power under Innocent II until its dissolution by Lucius II, reconstituted itself. Lucius II appealed to Emperor Henry VI for aid, but Emperor Henry VI declined to intervene. On February 15, 1145, Lucius II died of wounds incurred in battle.\n\n1145: Eugenius III and the Commune of Rome[]\n\nAfter the death of Lucius II, the conclave elected Bernardo Pignatelli, an abbot of a Cistercian monastery ouside Rome and friend and pupil of Bernard of Clairvaux. Although Bernard initially objected to the appointment of Pignatelli, he used Pignatelli as his puppet after he had been crowned Eugenius III. The citizens of Rome almost immediately formed a republican commune under the influence of Arnold of Brescia, a pupil of Abelard, and barred Eugenius III from reentry.\n\n1145-6: Preparations for the Second Crusade[]\n\nOn December 1, Eugenius III wrote Louis VII of France, asking him to lead a Second Crusade and providing the first mention of a plenary indulgence and Prester John. Louis VII of France, who had been planning his own crusade, and Eugenius III conferred, and on March 1, 1146, Eugenius III authorized Bernard of Clairvaux to preach crusade in France. Since no popular support for the Second Crusade had spontaneously emerged, Bernard laid emphasis on the new plenary indulgences. Many royalty were attracted to the cause. Louis VII and Eugenius III convinced Geza of Hungary, Roger II of Sicily, and Emperor Manuel I Comnenus to allow the Crusaders to cross their kingdoms. Bernard continued to preach in northwest Europe. Rudolf, a Cistercian monk, began to preach against the Jews for not contributing to the restoration of the Holy Land and incited pogroms. Bernard and the Archbishops of Cologne and Mainz took a dim view of the rabble-rousing and Bernard eventually found Rudolf in Mainz and convinced him to stop.\n\nSince Bernard was already in Germany, on November 1146 he preached Crusade to the German nobility, including Emperor Henry VI. Henry VI declined personal participation and many of the nobles followed his lead. Bernard then headed south. On his return journey, Bernard’s method acting while orating convinced Conrad I, Duke of Franconia, Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, and Henry XI Jasomirgott, Duke of Bavaria, to go on Crusade. Frederick of Swabia, as the heir presumptive to Emperor Henry VI’s imperial lands, was the Imperial legate on the Crusade.\n\nRaw Material[]\n\n1146: Henry VI Curtmantle (d. 1181) Frederick II, Duke of Swabia (d. 1147); Conrad I, Duke of Franconia (d. 1152); Henry XI Jasomirgott, Duke of Bavaria, Margrave of Austria (d. 1156); Henry III the Lion, Duke of Saxony (d. 1180)\n\n1147: December: Conrad III’s army arrive in Constantinople ahead of Louis VII.\n\n1147: October 31: Robert of Gloucester dies.\n\n1147: Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, dies.\n\n1147: Albert the Bear, Count of Weimar, conducts the Wendish crusade as “Margrave of Brandenburg”.\n\n1147: October 25: Battle of Dorylaeum: The Turks defeat Conrad III’s army.\n\n1151: September 7: Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, dies.\n\n1152 Conrad III, King of the Romans, dies.
