        "text": "The Royal House of Habsburg was one of the most influential royal houses of Europe. Rudolph of Habsburg become King of Germany in 1273 and the dynasty of the House of Habsburg was truly entrenched in 1276 when Rudolph became ruler of Austria, which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.\n\nIsabella of Portugal (24 October 1503 – 1 May 1539) was an Infanta of Portugal, by birth, and a Holy Roman Empress, Queen of Germany, Italy, Spain, Naples and Sicily, Duchess of Burgundy etc. as the spouse of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. She was the daughter of Manuel I of Portugal and Maria of Aragon. She served as regent of Spain during the absence of her spouse for long periods.\n\nMary I of England (18 February 1516 – 17 November 1558) was the only child of Henry VIII and his first wife Catherine of Aragon to survive to adulthood. She was the Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 after the dead of her younger half-brother, Edwar VI (son of Henry andJane Seymour). In 1554, Mary married King Philip of Spain, becoming Queen consort of Habsburg- Spain on his accession in 1556.\n\nElisabeth of Valois or Isabel de Valois (2 April 1545 – 3 October 1568) was the eldest daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de’ Medici. The 14-year-old Elisabeth married the 32-year-old King Philip II of Spain on 2 February 1560. His second wife, Mary I of England, had recently died, making Elisabeth as Philip’s third wife. Elisabeth had originally been betrothed to Philip's son, Carlos, Prince of Asturias, but political complications unexpectedly necessitated instead a marriage to Philip. They had 2 daughters, Infantas Isabella and Catherine of Spain.\n\nAnna of Austria (1 November 1549 – 26 October 1580). She was the eldest daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II, and Maria of Spain. She was Queen of Spain by virtue of her marriage to her maternal uncle, King Philip II of Spain. She was Philips’ fourth and most beloved wife.\n\nMargaret of Austria (25 December 1584 – 3 October 1611) was the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria. Margaret married Philip III of Spain, her first cousin, once-removed, on 18 April 1599 and became a very influential figure at her husband’s court. Philip had an “affectionate, close relationship” with Margaret, and paid her additional attention after she bore him a son in 1605."
