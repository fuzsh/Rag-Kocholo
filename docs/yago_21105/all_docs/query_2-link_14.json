        "text": "From the Emperor’s Desk: In discussing how Archduke Charles of Austria inherited the Imperial title I will be backtracking on some of the information on how the House of Habsburg became Archdukes of Austria. One more post on this topic on Monday!\n\nThe House of Habsburg, also known as the House of Austria, is one of the most prominent and important dynasties in European history.\n\nThe house takes its name from Habsburg Castle, a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day Switzerland by Radbot of Klettgau, who named his fortress Habsburg. His grandson Otto II was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding “Count of Habsburg” to his title.\n\nIn 1273, Count Radbot’s seventh-generation descendant, Count Rudolph of Habsburg, was elected King of the Romans. Taking advantage of the extinction of the Babenbergs and of his victory over King Ottokar II of Bohemia at the battle on the Marchfeld in 1278, he appointed his sons as Dukes of Austria and moved the family’s power base to Vienna, where the Habsburg dynasty gained the name of “House of Austria” and ruled until 1918.\n\nRudolf IV’s brothers Albrecht III and Leopold III ignored his efforts to preserve the integrity of the family domains and enacted the separation of the so-called Albertinian and Leopoldian family lines on September 25, 1379 by the Treaty of Neuberg.\n\nThe former would maintain Austria proper (then called Niederösterreich but comprising modern Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria), while the latter would rule over lands then labeled Oberösterreich, namely Inner Austria (Innerösterreich) comprising Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, and Further Austria (Vorderösterreich) consisting of Tyrol and the western Habsburg lands in Alsace and Swabia.\n\nBy marrying Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the daughter of Emperor Sigismund in 1437, Duke Albrecht V of the Albertine line (1397–1439) became the King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia again expanding the family’s political horizons. The next year, Duke Albrecht V of Austria was crowned as King of the Romans, known as such as Albrecht II. He was a member of the House of Habsburg and ruled the Holy Roman Empire as King of the Romans and not Emperor.\n\nArchdukes\n\nThrough the forged document called privilegium maius (1358/59), Duke Rudolf IV (1339–1365) introduced the title of Archduke to place the Habsburgs on a par with the Prince-Electors of the Empire, since Emperor Charles IV had omitted to give them the electoral dignity in his Golden Bull of 1356. Emperor Charles IV, however, refused to recognize the title, as did his immediate successors.\n\nDuke Ernst the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title “Archduke”.\n\nThat title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Friedrich III, himself a member of the House of Habsburg, himself used just “Duke of Austria”, never Archduke, until his death in 1493.\n\nThe title was first granted to Friedrich’s younger brother, Albrecht VI of Austria (died 1463), who used it at least from 1458. In 1477, Emperor Friedrich III granted the title Archduke to his first cousin Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III’s son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, apparently only started to use the title after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy in 1482, as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled “Duke of Austria”).\n\nThe title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and Philipp (his under-age son) in the Low Countries.\n\nEmperor\n\nFriedrich III (September 21, 1415 – August 19, 1493) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1452 until his death in 1493. He was the first King of the Romans from the House of Habsburg to be made Emperor. He was the penultimate emperor to be crowned by Pope Nicholas V and the last to be crowned in Rome.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1493, Archduke Maximilian was proclaimed the new King of the Romans, receiving the name Maximilian I. Maximilian was initially unable to travel to Rome to receive the Imperial title from Pope, due to opposition from Venice and from the French who were occupying Milan, as well a refusal from the Pope due to enemy forces being present on his territory.\n\nIn 1508, Pope Julius II allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as Electus Romanorum Imperator (“elected Emperor of the Romans”). This had a historical consequence in that, in the future, the Roman King would also automatically become Emperor, without needing the Pope’s consent.\n\nMaximilian’s predecessor Friedrich III was the last to be crowned Emperor by the Pope in Rome, while Maximilian’s successor Charles V was the last to be crowned by the pope, though in Bologna, in 1530.\n\nMaximilian’s rule (1493–1519) was a time of dramatic expansion for the Habsburgs. In 1497, Maximilian’s son Archduke Philippe, known as the Handsome or the Fair, married Infanta Joanna of Castile, also known as Joanna the Mad, heiress of the Castile.\n\nArchduke Phillipp of Austria and Duke of Burgundy (King Felipe I of Castile) and Queen Joanna had six children, the eldest of whom became King Carlos I of Spain and ruled the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (including their colonies in the New World), Southern Italy, Austria, and the Low Countries in 1516, with his mother and nominal co-ruler Joanna, who was kept under confinement.\n\nAt the death of his paternal grandfather, Emperor Maximilian I in 1519, Archduke Charles inherited Austria and was elected to succeed him as Holy Roman Emperor. He adopted the Imperial name of Charles V as his main title, and styled himself as a new Charlemagne.\n\nNow back to the future Queen Isabella I of Castile.\n\nAt the time of Infanta Isabella’s birth, she was second in line to the throne after her older half-brother the future King Enrique IV of Castile. Enrique was 26 at that time and married, but childless at that time.\n\nHer father, King Juan II of Castile was King of Castile and León from 1406 to 1454, was therefore the reigning monarch when future Queen Isabella I of Castile was born. King Juan II died on July 20, 1454 in Valladolid at the age of 49 and his eldest son succeeded him as King Enrique IV of Castile and Léon. Young Infanta Isabella was three years old.\n\nInfanta Isabella’s younger brother, Infante Alfonso of Castile was born two years after her on November 17, 1453, demoting her position to third in line. When her father died Infanta Isabella and her brother Infante Alfonso were left in King Enrique IV’s care. Isabella, her mother, and Infante Alfonso then moved to Arévalo.\n\nKing Enrique IV had been married prior to becoming King and when he was Prince of Asturias.\n\nHis chosen bride was Blanche of Navarre and Aragon the daughter of King Juan II of Aragon and Queen Blanche I of Navarre. Blanche of Navarre was an elder sister of the future King Fernando II of Aragon, husband of Queen Isabella I of Castile.\n\nIn 1427, she, her brother Charles, and her sister Eleanor were proclaimed the rightful heirs of the kingdom of Navarre. Blanche was promised to the heir of Castile in the peace treaty between Navarre and Castile in 1436. She married Enrique, Prince of Asturias (later King Enrique IV of Castile) in 1440. The marriage was reputedly never consummated.\n\nIn 1453, after thirteen years, the year before Infante Enrique became King, he sought the annulment of the marriage. An official examination confirmed the virginity of Blanche. A divorce was granted by Pope Nicholas V on the grounds that some “witchcraft” had prevented Enrique from consummating the marriage.\n\nAfter this, Blanche was sent home to Navarre, where she was imprisoned by her family: from 1462, she was under the custody of her sister. She remained childless throughout her life.\n\nAfter the death of her brother Charles in 1461, some dissatisfied Navarrese elements and some of the anti-Aragonese party regarded Blanche as the rightful monarch, as they had regarded her brother Charles. They proclaimed her queen. She would have thus become Queen Blanche II of Navarre, had not her father (who wanted to keep the government of Navarre) already had her incarcerated and thus not capable to act.\n\nShe died by poison in Orthez less than a month later.\n\nOne of Enrique’s detractors, the historian Alfonso de Palencia, wrote that the marriage had been a sham and accused Enrique of despising his wife and planning to commit adultery to bear children. According to Palencia, Enrique demonstrated “most extreme abhorrence” to his wife, and indifference to the confines of marriage.\n\nKing Enrique IV of Castile was married to his second wife Infanta Joan of Portugal, the posthumous daughter of King Duarte of Portugal and Infanta Eleanor of Aragon. They had a child, Infanta Joanna of Castile, Princess of Asturias. I will have more to say on her in an another blog entry. This marriage needed a dispensation also granted by Pope Nicholas V.\n\nArchdukes\n\nThrough the forged document called privilegium maius (1358/59), issued by Duke Rudolph IV of Austria (1339–1365) it introduced the title of Archduke in order to place the Habsburgs on an equal status with the Prince-Electors of the Empire, since Emperor Charles IV had omitted to give them the Electoral dignity two years prior in his Golden Bull of 1356.\n\nEmperor Charles IV, however, refused to recognize the title, as did his immediate successor and son, Count Sigismund of Luxembourg, future Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nIn 1357 Duke Rudolph IV of Austria was married to Catherine of Bohemia, also known as Catherine of Luxembourg, the second daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV and Blanche de Valois of France the youngest daughter of Charles de Valois of France and his third wife Mahaut of Châtillon.\n\nEager to compete with his mighty father-in-law, who had made the Kingdom of Bohemia and its capital Prague a radiant center of Imperial culture, Duke Rudolph IV desired to raise the importance of his residence Vienna to a comparable or greater physical height.\n\nThe forged privilegium maius, trying to raise the importance of his residence in Vienna, along with his attempts to make Vienna the seat of its own diocese, a status that they considered appropriate for the capital of a duchy, are viewed as further attempts to raise the status of House of Habsburg and the Duchy of Austria.\n\nDuke Rudolph IV, his brothers Albrecht III and Leopold III divided the Austrian domains between themselves, in accordance with the Treaty of Neuberg, signed in 1379.\n\nAlbrecht III retained Austria proper, while Leopold III took the remaining territories.\n\nDuke Ernst II the Iron of Austria was the third son of Duke Leopold III of Austria (1351–1386) and his consort Viridis Visconti (d. 1414), a daughter of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan.\n\nShortly after his birth, his father and his uncle Duke Albrecht III divided the Habsburg lands by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg: while Duke Albrecht III and his Albertinian descendants would rule over the Duchy of Austria proper, the Leopoldian line received the Inner Austrian states of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola with the remaining March of Istria, as well as Tyrol and the Further Austrian possessions.\n\nAfter Duke Leopold III’s death in the 1386 Battle of Sempach, young Ernst and his brothers Wilhelm, Leopold IV and Friedrich IV remained under the guardianship of their uncle Albrecht III.\n\nIn 1402, there was another split in the Leopoldian line, when Duke Ernst II the Iron took Inner Austria (i.e. the duchies of Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola) and Duke Friedrich IV became the ruler of Tyrol and Further Austria. The partitions decisively weakened the Habsburg position, in favour of their rivals from the Luxembourg and Wittelsbach dynasties.\n\nIn 1407, however, conflicts between Leopold III and Ernst II resulted in a civil war that lasted until May 1409. When Leopold III died without male heirs in 1411, Ernst II finally became the uncontested head of the Leopoldian branch.\n\nIn 1414, Ernst became the last Duke to be enthroned according to Carantanian traditional rite at the Prince’s Stone in Carinthia, and from that time on called himself ‘archduke’. He was the first Habsburg to actually use this title, since it had been invented by his uncle Duke Rudolph IV.\n\nThat title Archduke was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Friedrich III, himself a Habsburg. Friedrich III himself used just “Duke of Austria”, never Archduke, until his death in 1493.\n\nThe title was first granted to Emperor Friedrich III’s younger brother, Duke Albrecht VI of Austria (died 1463), who used it at least from 1458. In 1477, Friedrich III granted the title Archduke to his first cousin Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III’s son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, apparently only started to use the title after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy in 1482, as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled “Duke of Austria”). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and Philipp (his under-age son) in the Low Countries.\n\nArchduke was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled an Habsburg territory, i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to Cadets . These “junior” Archdukes did not thereby become independent hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown.\n\nOccasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, archduke and its female form, archduchess, came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g., Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria).\n\nCharles of Austria’s father Archduke Philipp of Austria was never a reigning Archduke of Austria since he predeceased his father, Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nTherefore when Emperor Maximilian died on January 12, 1519, Charles inherited the Austrian Hereditary Lands as Archduke Charles I of Austria.\n\nCharles of Austria of the House of Habsburg was born on February 24, 1500 in the Prinsenhof of Ghent, a Flemish city of the Habsburg Netherlands, to Archduke Philipp of Austria and his wife Infanta Joanna of Castile of the House of Trastámara.\n\nHis father Archduke Philipp, was nicknamed Philipp the Handsome, was the firstborn son of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, and Duchess Mary of Burgundy, heiress to the Burgundian Netherlands.\n\nHis mother, Infanta Joanna of Castile, was the younger child of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Fernando II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain and both were members of the House of Trastámara.\n\nGiven the dynastic situation at the time of his birth, the newborn Prince was originally heir apparent only of the Burgundian Low Countries as the honorific Duke of Luxembourg and second in line to the Austrian duchies, becoming known in his early years simply as “Prince Charles of Ghent”.\n\nAlthough Prince Charles was an Archduke of Austria at his birth, this title was an honorific and does not signify he was the reigning Archduke at the time. That distinction went to his grandfather, Archduke Maximilian I of Austria, who was the reigning Archduke of Austria from August 19, 1493 to January 12, 1519.\n\nI would like to give a little back story to the Duchy of Austria and how it came into the possession of the House of Habsburg.\n\nThe Duchy of Austria was a medieval Principality of the Holy Roman Empire, established in 1156 by the Privilegium Minus, when the Margraviate of Austria was detached from Bavaria and elevated to a duchy in its own right.\n\nAfter the ruling Dukes of the House of Babenberg became extinct in male line, there was as much as three decades of rivalry on inheritance and rulership, until King Ottokar II of Bohemia defeated the Hungarian troops at the Battle of Kressenbrunn. He now was sole ruler of the Bohemian, Moravian, Austrian and Styrian lands—an anticipation of the early modern Habsburg monarchy after 1526.\n\nWhen he failed to be elected King of the Romans in 1273, he contested the election of the successful candidate, the Swabian count, Rudolph of Habsburg. Nevertheless, Rudolph was able to secure his rule as the first actual King of the Romans and Germany after the Great Interregnum. By his Imperial authority he seized Ottokar’s “alienated” territories and added them to his already extensive homelands in Swabia.These territories included Austrian and Styrian lands.\n\nKing Ottokar II was finally defeated and killed by the united Austrian and Hungarian forces in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld.\n\nKing Rudolph married his daughter Judith off to King Ottokar II’s son, King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who retained the Bohemian throne.\n\nHaving reached an agreement with the Prince-Electors, King Rudolph granted the Austrian domains to his sons Albrecht I and Rudolph II at the 1282 Diet of Augsburg, elevating them to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, thereby securing it for the House of Habsburg. King Rudolf I’s descendants ruled Austria and Styria until 1918.\n\nThe Divided Duchy of Austria\n\nThe Erblande (“Hereditary Lands”) of the House of Habsburg formed the Alpine heartland of the Habsburg monarchy. They were the hereditary possessions of the Habsburgs within the Holy Roman Empire from before 1526. The Erblande were not all unified under the head of the dynasty prior to the 17th century. They were divided into several groupings: the Archduchy of Austria, Inner Austria, the County of Tyrol, and Further Austria.\n\nThe Duchy of Austria remained divided between the Albertine and Leopoldian lines of the Habsburg Dynasty until the reign of Emperor Friedrich III.\n\nFriedrich III (September 21, 1415 – August 19, 1493) was the eldest son of Duke Ernst the Iron of Inner Austria, and a member of the Leopoldian line of the Habsburg dynasty, and his second wife Cymburgis of Masovia.\n\nFriedrich acted as regent for his nephew, King Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria and King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia and son of the late Habsburg Monarch, King Albrecht II of the Romans and Germany and his consort Elizabeth of Luxembourg, in the duchy of Further Austria.\n\n(Ladislaus would die before coming of age). Friedrich, as Duke Friedrich VI of Inner Austria, was now the undisputed head of the Habsburg dynasty, though his regency in the lands of the Albertinian Line (Further Austria) was still viewed with suspicion.\n\nAs a cousin of late King Albrecht II of the Romans and Germany, Duke Friedrich VI became a candidate for the 1440 imperial election. On 2 February 2, 1440, the Prince-Electors convened at Frankfurt and unanimously elected him King of the Romans as Friedrich IV; his rule was still based on his hereditary lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or Inner Austria.\n\nIn 1452, at the age of 37, King Friedrich IV of the Romans and Germany travelled to Italy to receive his bride, the 17-year-old infanta Eleanor of Portugal and to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III, by Pope Nicholas V. Emperor Friedrich III was the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned in Rome. His great-grandson Emperor Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned, but this was done in Bologna.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III was the first member of the House of Habsburg to have the Imperial title. The previous two members of the House of Habsburg, Rudolph and Albrecht II, were elected Kings of the Romans and Germany but never held the Imperial title.\n\nDuring his reign as both King and Emperor, Friedrich III concentrated on re-uniting the Habsburg “hereditary lands” of Austria and took a lesser interest in Imperial affairs. Nevertheless, by his dynastic entitlement to Hungary as well as by the Burgundian inheritance, he laid the foundations for the later Habsburg Empire.\n\nEmperor Friedrich III died on August 19, 1493 in Linz at the age of 77. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Archduke Maximilian I of Austria, later Emperor, and grandfather of Emperor Charles V.\n\nIn the next entry I will discuss the title Archduke of Austria.\n\nHeinrich I of Hesse “the Child” (June 24, 1244 – December 21, 1308) was the first Landgrave of Hesse. He was the son of Henri II, Duke of Brabant and Sophie of Thuringia, daughter of Ludwig IV of Thuringia and Saint Elisabeth of Hungary.\n\nLife\n\nIn 1247, as Heinrich Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia, died without issue, conflict arose about the future of Thuringia and Hesse. The succession was disputed between Heinrich Raspe’s nephew and his niece: Sophie was the daughter of Heinrich Raspe’s brother Ludwig IV and claimed the territories on behalf of her son Heinrich, while Heinrich the Illustrious, Margrave of Meissen, was the son of Heinrich Raspe’s sister Jutta.\n\nAnother competitor were the Archbishops of Mainz, who could claim Hesse was a fiefdom of the archbishop and now, after the extinction of the Ludowingians, demanded its return to them.\n\nSophia of Thuringia, supported by the Hessian nobility, succeeded in retaining Hesse against her cousin, who in 1264 accepted the division of the Ludowingian inheritance: Heinrich of Meissen received Thuringia, while Sophia’s son Heinrich would inherit Hesse. In the following year, the Archbishop Werner II von Eppenstein acceded to this outcome in the Treaty of Langsdorf, accepting Heinrich as his liege-man and Landgrave of Hesse.\n\nAt this time, the landgraviate of Hesse consisted of the region between Wolfhagen, Zierenberg, Eschwege, Alsfeld, Grünberg, Frankenberg and Biedenkopf. In the same year, Heinrich acquired a part of the county of Gleiberg with Gießen from the Counts palatine of Tübingen. The landgraviate was centred on the towns of Cassel, where Heinrich took up his residence since 1277, and Marburg, where his grandmother Saint Elisabeth was buried and where Heinrich built the Castle Marburg.\n\nStruggle for possession of Naumburg\n\nHenry again got into conflict with his liege-lord, the Archbishop, about the possession of Naumburg. On behalf of the Archbishop, Heinrich was outlawed in 1274 by Rudolph I of Habsburg, King of the Romans/Germans but after Heinrich had supported Rudolph in the war against King Otakar II of Bohemia and had helped to conquer Vienna 1276, Rudolph reinstated Heinrich. In 1290 Heinrich defeated the Archbishop in the battle of Fritzlar and could henceforth maintain his territory.\n\nThough Heinrich never relinquished his own claim on Brabant, he supported his nephew Jean of Brabant against Guelders and Luxembourg in the Limburg succession war.\n\nElevation to prince of the realm\n\nOn May 12, 1292, Heinrich was made a Reichsfürst (Prince of the Realm) by Adolph of Nassau, King of the Romans/Germans freeing Hesse of the supremacy of the Archbishop of Mainz. Heinrich was bestowed with Eschwege and the Boyneburg (with Sontra), strengthening his position in Hesse. By skillful diplomacy he gained the cities of Sooden-Allendorf, Kaufungen, Witzenhausen, Immenhausen, Grebenstein, Wanfried, Staufenberg, Trendelburg and Reinhardswald.\n\nIn 1263 Henry had married Adelheid of Brunswick, daughter of Duke Otto of Brunswick, who bore him four daughters and the sons Heinrich (“the Younger”) and Otto. After Adelheid’s death in 1274, Heinrich had married Mechthild, daughter of Dietrich VI, Count of Cleves, who bore him another four daughters and the sons Johann and Ludwig.\n\nUncertainty over succession\n\nIn 1292 internal conflict arose about the question of Heinrich’s successor. Mechthild of Cleves demanded on her sons receiving a share of the heritage, while Heinrich and Otto, Heunrich’s sons by his first wife, insisted on excluding their half-brothers from the inheritance. This led to civil war lasting throughout the rest of Heinrich’s lifetime.\n\nHeinrich died in Marburg during the conflict, and was buried there in St. Elisabeth’s Church, which became the gravesite of the succeeding Landgraves for several more centuries. After his death, the inheritance was divided between Otto, who received Upper Hesse (Oberhessen) around Marburg, and Johann, who received Lower Hesse (Niederhessen), centred on Kassel. Johann’s younger brother Ludwig had entered the clergy and became bishop of Münster in 1310."
