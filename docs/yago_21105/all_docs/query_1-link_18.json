        "text": "Pieter van Sompel's and Pieter Soutman's 17th century portrait entitled, \"Rudolphus I, Nascitur Comes Habsburgicus\" (Rudolph I, Founder and Count of Habsburg) is an original etching and engraving. It is the first from a set of thirteen large portraits depicting monarchs of the House of Habsburg, beginning with Rudolph I, who was the first German King of the Habsburg Dynasty and ending with Ferdinand III. Soutman designed each of the portraits for this series, \"Effigies imperatorum domus Austriacae\" and entirely designed and etched each unique, ornamental border. Soutman's engravers for the portraits were either Pieter van Sompel or Jonas Suyderhoef. This impression of \"Rudolphus I, Nascitur Comes Habsburgicus\" (Rudolph I, Founder and Count of Habsburg), hails from the third state of four published by Frederick de Wit c. 1660 - 1680 and is printed on seventeenth century hand-made. This etching and engraving is a fine, original example of the art created by the Dutch artists, Pieter van Sompel and Pieter Claesz Soutman.\n\nHere, Pieter van Sompel depicts a three quarter length portrait of Holy Roman the Emperor Rudolph I, born, Count of Habsburg wearing his Royal dress and crown with his head slightly turned to the left. The portrait is surrounded by Pieter Soutman's large and richly ornate border decorated with Rudolph's coat-of-arms which occupies the top of the border and is flanked by imperial eagles. To the sides, putti mischievously play with arms and armour. The Latin inscription under this superb portrait of Emperor Rudolph I reads; \"I, Rudolphus I, Nascitur Comes Habsburgicus Kal, Maii, MCCXVIII, Sceptrum, Caesareum, Infert Suae Domui III KAL, Octob, MCCLXXIII, Ottocari Victor, Austriam, et Alias Terras, Filiis, Dat, Imperio Restituto, Atque, Pacato, Obit, XVII, Kal, Sextil, MCCXCI. 'P. Soutman Invenit Effigiavit et Excud. Cum Privil. P. van Sompel Sculp. Frederick de Wit Excudit'\". Born in 1218, Rudolph I was the first German King of the Habsburg Dynasty. He inherited Breisgua, Alsace and the Aargau and acquired the duchies of Austria and Styria by defeating his enemy, Ottakar II, also known as Premyslid Otakar (Ottokar), King of Bohemia and Duke of Styria. Rudolph was crowned King in 1273. Emperor Rudolph I died in 1291 and was succeeded by his son, Albert I. This is a striking example of the 17th century art created by the Dutch artists, Pieter van Sompel and Pieter Soutman"
