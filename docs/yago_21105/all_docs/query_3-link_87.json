        "text": "When Emperor Frederick II was crowned by the Pope in 1220, his son Henry was elected King of the Romans (i.e. King of Germany and heir to the Empire), and dropped the title of Rector of Burgundy. Thereafter there was no attempt to govern Arelate as a single unit. As Imperial power weakened from the later 13th century onwards, the increasingly powerful Kings of France further extended the borders of France eastward into Arelate, and brought Provence under their influence. The remainder of the ex-Kingdom of Burgundy was dominated by the County of Savoy. Count Amadeus VI was named Imperial Vicar for the Kingdom of Arelate in 1365, and in 1416 the County became the Duchy of Savoy. Imperial weakness also led to full independence for the (still growing) Papal States in 1282, and to the gradual development of autonomy for, amongst others, the Swiss Confederation (founded in 1291), the Electorate of Brandenburg (a status granted in 1356 meaning that the Margrave of Brandenburg would be one of those who elected the Emperor), and the Arch-Duchy of Austria (self-proclaimed in 1358, after the Duke of Austria was not raised to the status of an Elector) and its dependencies under the Hapsburgs. By the time of this map, the Hapsburg Frederick III had been Emperor since 1440, and the title would be held by his descendants until 1806 (apart from 1742-5). As Colin McEvedy [4] wrote, the Electors were prepared to allow this monopoly on the Imperial throne \"because its possession was a source of weakness rather than strength.\" This weakness was most evident on the western borders of the Empire, where, starting in 1384, the Valois Dukes of Burgundy (in France) acquired an extensive array of territories by marriage alliance and purchase. This included the Free County (Franche Comt√©) of Burgundy (that part of the ex-Kingdom of Burgundy immediately to the east of the Duchy), much of what had once been Lotharingia (see 843), as well as Flanders and Picardy in France. Collectively, all of these territories were known as Burgundy, and made the Dukes one of the wealthiest monarchs in Europe. The last of them, Charles \"the bold\" (1467-77) aimed at nothing less than the revival of Lothar's Middle Kingdom. He effectively controlled numerous neighbouring Bishoprics and Principalities (these are shown in Burgundian colour in the map, which also somewhat simplifies the convoluted borders). He had subjugated and planned to annex Savoy (effectively under the rule of the Valois Duchess Yolande) [9], and Nevers to the west (under the Valois Count John) was nominally his vassal. In 1473 Charles nearly managed to force the Emperor Frederick III to grant him the title King of Burgundy. Burgundian territory reached its peak in 1475, with Charles' conquest of Lorraine (the southernmost part of Lotharingia, which still retained the ancient name). For the first time since 855, there was a realm between France and Germany whose power extended from the North Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe ambitions of Charles the Bold alarmed Louis XI of France, who financed the Swiss and the ousted Duke of Lorraine to make war upon him and Savoy. In 1477, Charles, living up to his epithet, was killed in a reckless attempt to retake Nancy in Lorraine. He had no sons, and his only daughter Marie was unmarried, so his Middle Kingdom died with him. The Duke of Lorraine regained his Duchy, and Louis XI invaded the other Burgundian territories. But Marie agreed to marry Maximilian, heir of the Hapsburg Emperor Frederick III, to try to preserve her inheritance. In this way, Emperor Maximilian of Austria ended up ruling most of the Burgundian territories within the Empire, as well as extending the Empire's border to encompass Flanders and Picardy. These former Burgundian territories now under Hapsburg rule were known as the Burgundian Circle, one of ten Imperial Circles (regions) set up for taxation and governance in 1512. Marie and Maximilian's son Phillip meanwhile had married Joanna the Mad, daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castilla. Phillip and Joanna's eldest son Charles had inherited all of his grandparent's territories by 1519 --- Spain and its growing Empire in Italy and the New World, the Burgundian Circle, and Austria --- as well as the Imperial title. But he faced stiff opposition from an alliance between the Ottoman Empire and France. The latter had finally become a unified Kingdom (apart from a few tiny territories) when Francis, recently married to Claude, heiress of Brittany, ascended to the French throne in 1514 (*). To deal with this threat on all sides of his Empire, Charles made his brother Ferdinand Archduke of Austria in 1521. By 1556, when Charles abdicated, Ferdinand had brought Bohemia and western Hungary into the Austrian fold. Ferdinand kept these and gained the Imperial title, while Charles' son Phillip II got the rest, including the Burgundian Circle. This Circle had been extended in the north in 1548 but in 1566 these northernmost subjects of Spain, and their fellow Protestants around the Zuiderzee, rebelled. Their struggle for independence from Spain lasted 82 years, the last 30 of which were part of the terrible 30-years war which laid waste much of the Empire. It ended with the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which saw a major contraction in the Empire. It had been known as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation since 1512, and the new boundaries of the Empire reflected this, ending the fiction of Imperial power in northern Italy, Savoy, Switzerland, and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. But the greater part of the Burgundian Circle remained within the Empire, under Spanish rule (hence the green Spanish dots on the original Burgundian colour). Spain also kept the Kingdom of Naples (held by Aragon since 1504) and the Duchy of Milan (held since 1535).\n\n(*) As a consequence the official borders of France are no longer shown on the map."
