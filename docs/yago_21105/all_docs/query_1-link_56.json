        "text": "2. Constance, who died in 1125, married (1) Hugh I., Count of Champagne, and in 1106 (2) Bohemond I. of Antioch, who died in 1111.\n\nWhen King Philip I. died in July 1108, he was succeeded by his son, Louis VI.:\n\nPhilip I. married in 1092 (2) Bertrade of Montfort, daughter of Simon I, Seigneur de Montfort (Count de Montfort-l'Amaury, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Richard, Count of Evreux, and widow of Fulk IV., le Rechin, from whom descended Fulk V., the Younger, and the Geoffrey Plantaganet, father of Henry II. of England. They were separated in 1104. Bertade died in 1117. Philip and Bertrade had four children as follows:\n\n1. Philip\n\n2. Fleury (Florus)\n\n3. Cecile, married (1) Tancred, Prince of Tiberias, who died in 1112, and (2) Pons, Count of Tripolis, who died in 1137.\n\n4. an unnamed child.\n\n3. Louis VIII See below.\n\nPhilip married on August 15, 1193 (2) Ingeborg (Ingeburge or Isambour)) of Denmark, sister of King Chanute VI. of Denmark. She was born in 1175, died in 1236, but that marriage lasted but one day. For some unknown reason, Philip totally rejected her after the first night together, and he had her shut up in a nunnery and later put in prison, attempting to obtain a divorced decree, in order to remarry. There were no children. He quickly married in 1196 (3) Agnes of Meran, daughter of the German prince of the Holy Roman Empire, who ruled Merano, even though she was so closely related to Philip that their union was automatically forbidden by canon law. Philip found some obliging churchmen to annul the first marriage and solemnize the second, on May 7, 1196. The Pope Celestine III. did not take action except to issue appeals and warnings. When Innocent III. became Pope in 1198 the affair had been dragging on for two years. When Philip refused to yield, Pope Innocent III. placed an interdict against all of France. This action deprived the entire population of the sacraments of the Church. Philip finally in desperation agreed to a separation from Agnes, and the Pope lifted the ban. But not before she bore him a son, Philip Hurepel of Boulogne, died in 1234, Count of Boulogne by marriage with the heiress to the country, active during the reign of Louis IX., and a daughter, Mary (Marie), who died in 1224, married (1) Philip I. of Namur, who died in 1212, and (2) Henry I., Duke of Brabant, who died in 1235. There was issue by this second marriage.\n\nAnother son (illegitimate) was born to Philip and \"a maiden of Arras\", Pierre Charlot, Bishop of Noyon."
