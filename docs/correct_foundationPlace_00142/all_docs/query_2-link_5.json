It is the sequel to Star Wars: Battlefront and the second installment in the series. It was developed by Pandemic Studios for the Sony PlayStation 2, the Microsoft Xbox and Windows, and by Savage Entertainment for the Sony PlayStation Portable, and it was published on November 1, 2005 in North America and on October 31, 2005 in Europe by LucasArts. On July 8, 2009, the game was added to Steam and on October 20 to the PSP's PlayStation Store. On January 20, 2015, it was added to GOG as well. The PS2 version can be played on certain models of the PlayStation 3. The PSP version is backward-compatible on the PlayStation Vita. The Xbox version is backward-compatible on the Xbox 360 since March 30, 2006[1] and on the Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S since April 26, 2018[2]. It was added to Origin on December 18, 2018[3]. It was available for free download from April 1 to April 15, 2019 on the Xbox Games with Gold service[4].\n\nA third installment called Star Wars: Battlefront III was in development at Free Radical Design in 2006[5], but it got cancelled by LucasArts[6].\n\nOn May 10, 2016, the development of a reboot of Star Wars: Battlefront II was announced by Electronic Arts, its publisher, and it was developed by DICE, Motive Studios and Criterion Games[7]. EA's Star Wars Battlefront II released on November 17, 2017 for the Sony PlayStation 4, the Microsoft Xbox One and Windows.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, a remastered collection of Battlefront I and II developed and published by Aspyr was announced during the Nintendo Direct showcase[8]. Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection was released on March 14, 2024 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows[9].\n\nGameplay[]\n\nSee also: Gameplay in Star Wars: Battlefront\n\nLike the first game, Star Wars: Battlefront II is a first and third-person shooter with vehicular combat elements, that can be played in both single-player and multiplayer mode. Its gameplay is essentially the same as the previous game, but the sequel introduces new features. The player can now sprint and roll forward. It is now possible to change the character at any friendly command post.\n\nIn addition to the soldier classes of the first game, the player can also play as the heroes and villains of the Star Wars saga, albeit for a limited time. These and the advanced unit classes becomes playable when the player reaches a certain score. To earn points, the player must kill enemies, capture command posts, or destroy vehicles; they can also be deducted by doing negative actions such as harming teammates. There are also three new classes for each faction: the engineer, the marine and the officer. The engineer replaces the pilot on land as the pilot is now the primary space class, the marine is the secondary space class and the officer is a unit that varies depending on the player's faction.\n\nEngineers and pilots can now hijack enemy vehicles thanks to their fusion cutters. The game also features new vehicles, such as the A-Wing and the TIE Interceptor. Most of the flying vehicles have been moved from land battles to the newly added space battles, which allow the player to dogfight in these vehicles in space. Players are also able to board capital ships and engage in combat with other enemies in different sections of the ships. In order to win a space battle, the player team must reach a certain collective score before the enemies by killing their troops, destroying their starfighters and/or parts of their capital ship.\n\nThe game introduces 16 new maps, like the refinery of Mustafar and the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Many maps that came from the original Battlefront were edited to fit more accordingly in the storyline, such as the Naboo battlefield, which was shifted from plains to Theed. However, some of the original locations from the first game have been removed.\n\nAnother new feature are the awards, earned during gameplay by accomplishing certain objectives. These awards can assist the player by giving them upgraded weapons and gameplay traits. There are four levels in which the players awards are ranked: green, elite, veteran, and legendary. Once the player gets a certain award to legendary status, the effect will be permanent.\n\nBattlefront II expands upon the original game's campaign experience with open-ended mission-based objectives. The galactic conquest mode has been revamped as well, and now it plays out on a galactic scale. New gametypes for the instant action mode on land has been added: hunt, capture the flag, XL (PC only) and hero assault. In hunt players can battle with factions that aren't normally playable, like Wampas. XL is a game mode similar to assault except players have to kill 350 units to win the game with more units spread throughout the map. In hero assault players can fight it out as every hero and villain in the game. Capture the flag has two variants: 1 flag CTF and 2 flags CTF. In the first variant whoever captures the flag and returns it to their command post for a certain amount of times wins. In the second variant the players must take the enemy flag and bring it back to their respective base a certain amount of times to win the battle, whilst simultaneously defending their own flag.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe campaign is told from the point of view of an unknown clone trooper/stormtrooper veteran of the 501st Legion remembering his battles. The story includes battles that go from Attack of the Clones' battle of Geonosis to The Empire Strikes Back's battle of Hoth.\n\nOriginally part of the Republic, the 501st Legion was first deployed during the battle of Geonosis at the beginning of the Clone Wars, where they captured a Separatist outpost occupied by battle droids and Geonosians. Near the end of the war, the 501st was sent to Mygeeto to aid the 21st Nova Corps, led by General Ki-Adi-Mundi, to destroy a Separatist energy generator. The clones received special orders from Palpatine to collect a sample of the generator after its destruction, which would later be used to power the Death Star. After this, the 501st was pressed into space combat above Coruscant, which has been attacked by Separatist forces led by General Grievous, and had to destroy one of their cruisers to clear a path for Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to rescue Palpatine. Then, the 501st was called in to find the lost 327th Star Corps on Felucia, and battled the CIS with the help of Aayla Secura, their commander. The 501st were later sent on a seemingly suicidal mission to assist Wookiees on Kashyyyk, with help from Yoda. But first, they fought their way through the Separatist blockade. Next, the 501st was sent in Utapau with General Kenobi's 212th Attack Battalion to defeat the CIS forces and General Grievous. This is when Order 66 was issued, and under the command of Darth Vader, the 501st stormed the Jedi Temple in Coruscant to kill all its occupants. Meanwhile, Palpatine declared the end of the Clone Wars and the foundation of the Galactic Empire.\n\nDarth Vader took command of the 501st, which soon became known as \"Vader's Fist\", replacing Republic uniforms and equipment with stormtrooper armor and weapons. Their first assignment was forcing a regime change on Naboo by assassinating Queen Apailana. Gizor Dellso, a surviving geonosian member of the CIS, reactivated a droid factory in Mustafar. The 501st was sent in to stop the production of new battle droid prototypes, kill Delso, and ultimately destroy his factory. The remaining clones on Kamino raised a legion of clone troopers to use against the Empire. The young bounty hunter Boba Fett led the 501st to quell the uprising. Following the Kamino incident, the Empire halted clone production, and clone troopers were slowly replaced by stormtroopers. The 501st remained one of the few Imperial legions to consist mostly of clones. Roughly nineteen years after the end of the Clone Wars, a group of rebel prisoners managed to escape from the Death Star with the battle station's schematics. The 501st, reassigned due to the breakout, was sent to track the stolen plans to a Rebel outpost on Polis Massa and eventually tracked them down to the spaceship Tantive IV above Tatooine. The Galactic Civil War began.\n\nVader's Fist captured Princess Leia Organa, but they failed to retrieve the stolen schematics. Thanks to them, the Rebels found the Death Star's weakness and destroyed it. The 501st was then sent to exact revenge for those lost on the Death Star by destroying the Rebellion's HQ on Yavin 4. Three years later, the Empire located another rebel base on Hoth. The 501st captured the base and destroyed most of its evacuating transports. The veteran ends the story by stating that the Death Star was eventually rebuilt and the Empire's grip on the galaxy became stronger than ever, all thanks to the efforts of the 501st Legion.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nSee also: Characters in Star Wars: Battlefront\n\nPlayable characters[]\n\nBattlefront II expands the number of playable characters of the previous game by adding 3 new soldier classes, 7 members of neutral factions found in hunt mode and 19 heroes/villains. Unlike regular units' health, the heroes and villains' health will slowly drain if they don't kill enemies. Dying will cause them to retreat and depending on the game mode they will be selectable again after a period of time has passed. These are the new playable characters in Battlefront II:\n\nEngineers\n\nMarines\n\nOfficers\n\nDarth Vader\n\nLuke Skywalker/Pilot Luke\n\nHan Solo\n\nThe Emperor\n\nBoba Fett\n\nChewbacca\n\nYoda\n\nDarth Maul\n\nObi-Wan\n\nGeneral Grievous\n\nCount Dooku\n\nMace Windu\n\nKi-Adi-Mundi\n\nJango Fett\n\nPrincess Leia\n\nAnakin Skywalker\n\nAayla Secura\n\nKit Fisto*\n\nAsajj Ventress*\n\nEwoks\n\nGeonosians\n\nWampas\n\nWookiees\n\nJawas\n\nTusken Raiders\n\nGungans\n\n* Xbox DLC only\n\nNon-playable characters[]\n\nBattlefront II adds 6 new NPCs as well, but also removes some from the previous game. These are the new non-playable characters compared to the first game:\n\nAnti-Troopers\n\nJedi\n\nAcklays\n\nTemple Security Force\n\nQueen Apailana\n\nGizor Dellso\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront II was announced on April 21, 2005, during Star Wars Celebration III[10]. The game's release date would be set to coincide with the DVD release of Revenge of the Sith and an Xbox demo was included on the DVD's extras[11]. LucasArts browsed forums and used other means to provide feedback for the sequel. Peter Hirschmann, vice president of product development at LucasArts, stated that making the game playable on the PSP required immense efforts. LucasArts Engineers working on Indiana Jones and Star Wars development teams were brought in to help optimize game code.\n\n\"It was a huge 'pop the champagne' day if you got back one whole frame a second\"\n\n— Peter Hirschmann\n\nAs always, Pandemic Studios developed the game using their in-house engine, Zero, and Lua. Josh Resnick, president of Pandemic Studios said that it was difficult to get assets from the movie in order to build the related in-game assets.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is a rearrangement of the movies' musics done by Jesse Harlin.\n\nDifferent versions[]\n\nPlayStation Portable version[]\n\nThe PSP version of the game has a lot of differences when compared to the other versions. Graphically speaking, the models and the textures have lower quality, the resolution is reduced to 480 x 272 pixels and the framerate lies between 20 and 30 FPS. This is due to the console being significantly less powerful than the other platforms.\n\nRegarding the multiplayer aspect, all online features are completely cut and only the local multiplayer through the PSP's ad-hoc function is available. A maximum of 4 players are allowed per lobby, two for each team, and the splitscreen is removed, likely due to the PSP's small screen. The multiplayer version of galactic conquest is also removed.\n\nThe campaign and the training mission are completely removed, and are replaced with 3 challenges, Rogue Assassin, Rebel Raider and Imperial Enforcer, with 4 levels each, and a tutorial, a small slideshow to show off game features. Eleven maps are removed while others are heavily modified due to technical limitations. Consequently, the board of galactic conquest is altered to fit the lack of these maps. The number of units on maps in conquest mode is drastically reduced.\n\nReloading a weapon manually is not possible in this version for the lack of buttons, and squad commands are completely removed for the same reason. Droidekas can pick up flags in ball mode and their shield is shown as an oval rather than a sphere. There are no announcers in this game. The audio lines for the heroes and the units have been cut as well. The only voices present are those when the units receive critical damage from blasters or other weapons.\n\nDownloadable content[]\n\nLucasArts released a patch for the Windows version on February 15, 2006[12], which included support for additional maps. The modding tools were subsequently released on February 21[13]. The download included many of the game's assets, several tutorials, and the tools required to make custom content, like a plugin for Softimage XSI which allows users to create new 3D models and animations, and the Zero Editor, a software that allows users to make anything from user interface changes to additional gameplay levels.\n\nOn May 31, 2014, the online service that was hosting Battlefront II's multiplayer at the time, Gamespy Technology, was shut down and the game's online functionality was at risk[14]. On the same day the Windows version was added to a list of supported games on GameRanger[15]. Electronic Arts extended the servers for PC and PS2 until June 30 of the same year[16], then on July 25 they stopped. On October 2, 2017, multiplayer for the Windows version was restored by Disney with a patch, allowing for Steam and GOG cross-play[17]. However, the patch created new game breaking bugs, so another patch came out on January 5, 2018[18] to fix these issues. The last time the game was updated was on February 10, 2021, but it was quickly reverted since the patch broke the game once again[19].\n\nThe Xbox version of the game received two DLCs through Xbox Live. The first released on December 19, 2005 for free[20], and it added the hero assault mode to Kashyyyk. The second one came out on January 31, 2006 at the price of $4.99[21], and introduced a new hero, a new villain and four maps from the original game. It also added the hero assault mode to Coruscant, Mygeeto, and Naboo. Today it is no longer possible to get these DLCs on the original Xbox, however, they have been released again for Xbox One on June 10, 2019 for free[22].\n\nReception[]\n\nReviewers PS2 PSP Xbox PC EGM 8.17/10 6.33/10 8.17/10 N/A Eurogamer N/A N/A 6/10 N/A Game Informer 8.5/10 7/10 8.5/10 8.5/10 GamePro 4.5/5 N/A 4.5/5 N/A GameRevolution 7/10 N/A 7/10 7/10 GameSpot 8.1/10 6.8/10 8.1/10 7.8/10 GameSpy 4.5/5 3.5/5 4.5/5 3.5/5 GamesRadar+ 4/5 N/A 4/5 4/5 GameZone 8.4/10 7.9/10 8.2/10 8/10 IGN 7/10 7.8/10 7/10 7/10 Metacritic 84/100 69/100 83/100 78/100 PC Gamer N/A N/A N/A 83%\n\nOn Metacritic, the Xbox version scored 83 out of 100 with 40 reviews[23], the PS2 version 84 with 30 reviews[24], the Windows version 78 with 23 reviews[25] and the PSP version 69 with 22 reviews[26].\n\nAndrew Reiner of Game Informer gave it an 8.5 out of 10, saying:\n\n\"Developers like Pandemic are creating some of the most memorable Star Wars experiences to date.
