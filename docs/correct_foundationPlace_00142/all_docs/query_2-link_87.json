        "text": "Senior Game Designer\n\nDarren\n\nWhat makes Full Circle unique?\n\nIf I had only one phrase to describe the Full Circle team, it would probably be “winning the lottery”. The team is comprised of some of the most incredibly passionate humans I have ever had the pleasure to work with, as everyone here seems to be a “total package”. They are experienced and professional, well-thought and logical… and at the same time they are sincerely caring, compassionate, inclusive, and kind. They go above and beyond to ensure every single team member is heard, and do everything in their power to make the experience the absolute best it can be for everyone. This is a combination you rarely see anywhere, and is kind of a one-in-a-million scenario, which is why I can only describe it as “winning the lottery”.\n\nSenior Gameplay Designer\n\nAlice\n\nWhat makes Full Circle unique?\n\nBorn during the pandemic, Full Circle is a fully hybrid studio with a decentralized team. This permits us to have the best members available regardless of location. When hiring we focus obviously on talent but it’s as important to us that the members of our team fit our culture of transparency, diversity, and inclusivity. Ironically even if I’m so far away from the physical location of the studio, I’ve never felt more at home and connected than with my team than here. I think this shows how great our team is at fostering connections and collaboration remotely.\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nSasha\n\nWhy should a candidate want to join Full Circle to work on Skate?\n\nEvery day, I am grateful to be at Full Circle. It's not just about making a skate game; it's about fun, teamwork, and a family vibe that makes each day great. Working with a team where every opinion and idea counts is incredible. It's the kind of place where work doesn't feel like work, and the balance between professional growth and personal happiness is just right. Joining Full Circle, I've found not just colleagues, but friends who make every project, every challenge, a journey worth being a part of.\n\nSenior Creative Director\n\nDeran\n\nWhat makes Full Circle unique?\n\nI think it’s our chemistry; our team’s talent without ego, the ambition of the products we make and the way we build them. We’re assembling a diverse and inclusive studio of quality human beings. Making games is hard and requires collaboration and dedication. Finding the right mix of people in the right roles is as important as the concept itself. At the end of the day, it’s all about making cool stuff with good people.\n\nManager, Operations & Culture\n\nAngela\n\nWhy should a candidate want to join Full Circle to work on Skate?\n\nI can tell you that the team is what has made me love my job. The Full Circle studio is filled with people who are passionate, and even though many of us have not physically met yet due to covid-19, that passion has connected us all. Our team members have ranging industry experience; some are the creators of the original Skate game while others have previously never worked in a gaming studio (like me!). Regardless of our background, we respect one another for what each person can contribute to the project. Outside of the project, EA and Full Circle have given me avenues to pursue things that are important to me. I have been able to convert volunteer hours to dollars towards my charity of choice and am part of our studio’s Culture Committee, where we work to continuously improve the diversity and inclusivity within the team. I am thankful to have met such a great group of people and look forward to meeting more!\n\nLead Social Designer\n\nAndreia\n\nWhat makes Full Circle unique?\n\nThe reason the studio is so unique is that everyone is supportive and every voice is respected. We’ve put a lot of focus on welcoming more diverse perspectives to the team and it’s been inspiring to see the impact that has had. Everyone is really passionate about making the best game and welcoming everyone. And the results already show!\n\nWhy should a candidate want to join Full Circle to work on Skate?\n\nWe want our team to reflect our players as much as we can. If you’re keeping an eye on how Skate culture has evolved in the past years you will see that it’s now more inclusive than ever before. To truly reflect that we need diverse voices and perspectives in the team so that it can be part of our foundation and factored in every day. If you are passionate about making a game that pushes boundaries on the medium and on who gets to play games, we want to hear from you"
