Because families know best what they need, the City of Saint Paul launched the People’s Prosperity Guaranteed Income Pilot in 2020 and CollegeBound Boost in 2022 to give them the additional income they need to make ends meet and the dignity to have control over their decisions.",

        "text": "Too many of our families today are experiencing economic hardship, and rising costs, a lack of affordable housing, and limited childcare options only make things more difficult. These barriers to prosperity impact families and our whole community by depriving our neighborhoods of their full potential. The struggles that people are facing are real and that’s why the City of Saint Paul is committed to building a more inclusive economy that works for all of us.\n\nDirect cash payment are a simple, effective way to help Saint Paul residents achieve economic security The City launched the People's Prosperity pilot in November 2020 to get cash to 150 families so they can buy the things they need.\n\nThe City is doubling down on this investment with the launch of CollegeBound Boost to provide guaranteed income to additional families, but also combine these payments with savings for the future, in the form of savings deposits into their children's CollegeBound savings account. Income helps parents make it through the month, but savings can give families tangible hope for their kid's future.\n\nThe People's Prosperity pilot is being evaluated by the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania. They are using mixed-methods to study the pilot, including periodic surveys and qualitative interviews. Findings from the evaluation are planned for release in 2023.\n\nCollegeBound Boost is being evaluated by the University of Michigan's School of Social Work under Professor William Elliott, a nation-leading expert on children’s college savings and asset building, and will study the impacts of combining guaranteed income and asset building through CollegeBound Boost for Saint Paul families."
