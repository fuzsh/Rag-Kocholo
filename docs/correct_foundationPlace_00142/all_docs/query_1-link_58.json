Usually heavy duty, multi-purpose, and at least semi-permanently installed with a taping system, or permanently with adhesive. When you’re looking for the right dance flooring, having a number of options is helpful in finding the right one. Dance floor material refers to all the elements that make up a dance floor system. They can include vinyl, wood, screws, click and lock mechanism, foam block, tape, adhesive, transition ramps and vapor barrier. Flooring for dance consists of a vinyl (called marley) or wood surface along with a foam backing or absorbent subfloor.
