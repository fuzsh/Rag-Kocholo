        "text": "The Atlanta Police Foundation\n\nTo Make Atlanta the Safest Large City in the Nation\n\nThe Atlanta Police Foundation employs a broad array of 21st century public safety initiatives to accomplish its mission. These initiatives include community programs designed to provide resources to underserved neighborhoods, as well as training to cultivate a mindset of true servanthood among the Atlanta Police Department sworn personnel.\n\nSince 2003, APF has been providing vital strategic support to Atlanta’s Mayor, Chief of Police, and Police Department to ensure that our City’s law enforcement agency remains on the forefront of policing and public safety practices. In 2015, Atlanta was named a model city by President Obama’s task force for 21st Century Policing – one of only 15 jurisdictions to be given that status out of 18,000 reviewed.\n\nOur work is far from over. Through our public-private partnership model, we will continue to pursue, privately fund and implement programming that creates a safe and just city for every citizen of Atlanta, driving out crime and enhancing the safety of our neighborhoods.\n\nAbout Dave Wilkinson\n\nDave Wilkinson is one of America’s leading law enforcement professionals. Before joining the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF), he served 22 years with the United States Secret Service in various senior roles.\n\nThese included Assistant Special Agent in Charge of Presidential Protection under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Investigations, and Special Agent in Charge of the Secret Service’s Georgia Division. He was awarded the Secret Service Distinguished Service Award from President Bush for his leadership during the 9-11 terrorist attacks.\n\nIn 2005, Dave became the President & CEO of APF. This independent non‐profit organization brings together civic‐minded business leaders from the region’s largest companies and philanthropic organizations to ensure that APF has the financial strength, technological prowess, and advocacy from the private sector to support public safety initiatives in Atlanta.\n\nAs one of the most respected thought leaders in the law enforcement community, Dave has led the Atlanta Police Foundation to become an indispensable strategic planning and research partner to four Atlanta Mayors and five Chiefs of Police.\n\nHe graduated from Leadership Atlanta in 2008 and serves on the boards of directors of the Metro Atlanta Chamber, Rotary Club of Atlanta, and Atlanta Metropol.\n\nDave is also a proud Tennessee Tech University graduate and lives in Brooks, Georgia, with his wife, Renee, and their two sons, Jacob and Jonathan."
