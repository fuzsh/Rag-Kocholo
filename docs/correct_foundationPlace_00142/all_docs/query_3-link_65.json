        "text": "The latest NYC Opportunity annual report on poverty updates the NYCgov Poverty Measure for New York City in 2020. This year’s report, which covers the first year of Covid-19, provides less robust poverty data than past reports because of significant pandemic-related limitations in data collection in 2020.\n\nRead the Report\n\nEquityNYC, New York City’s equity data tool, has updated data and features! The site now includes data sets through 2022, disaggregated by race/ethnicity, gender, income, sexual orientation, and neighborhood. The tool has also been redesigned to make it easier to find the data you’re looking for.\n\nNYC Opportunity released a new participatory study that examines the evidence base, historical context, and strengths of the credible messenger approach, and presents recommendations that can inform future investments in the credible messenger field.\n\nReducing Poverty and Advancing Equity: A Retrospective provides a look at ways our multidisciplinary team has worked across City government, partnering with agencies to initiate new approaches and enhance existing practices between 2014 and 2021"
