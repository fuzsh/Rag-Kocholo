Morgan Chase turned millions of legal documents into The Waiting Workforce.\n\nOn screen:\n\nOutside of the National Constitution Center building, The Waiting Workforce Installation is displayed in a large room with glass walls. It consists of dozens of life-sized figures made from the stacks of legal paperwork. The hazel-eyed man:\n\nMan With Slicked-Back Dark Hair and Hazel Eyes:\n\nWhen I actually walked up to this piece and I see all these people faceless and nameless… I look at that sculpture and I say “that is me”. I feel like one of these people who’s constantly waiting.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAt the exhibition, the man with short black hair looks at the figures and then speaks:\n\nMan With Short Black Hair and Brown Eyes:\n\nI’m like, those are people burdened by mountains of documents, mountains of paper.\n\nText on screen:\n\nWe made 38 statues, one for each state that has yet to pass Clean Slate legislation.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA montage shows the different speakers in this video visiting The Waiting Workforce installation.

Together we've traversed the uncertain unknown. There's a greater story waiting to be told. A community of gold. We make it happen.\n\n00:00:15:06 - 00:00:28:15\n\nSpeaker 2\n\nFor me, Detroit is home. It is where I was born and raised. It is a place where the people hustle hard. We're super resilient. We've gone through a whole lot and have always found a way to bounce back.\n\n00:00:29:03 - 00:00:45:06\n\nSpeaker 3\n\nI got lucky that I came to this city at the same time JPMorgan Chase was investing in Detroit. That allowed me to get access to capital to rehab these houses. The house is going to go to an actual family. We might have put them on a different trajectory.\n\n00:00:45:20 - 00:01:06:14\n\nSpeaker 2\n\nJPMorgan Chase has been with the Detroit at Work system almost since our inception, helping to fund the work to transform jobs and training in the city. Detroiters are deserving of jobs that are professional, that provide a long term pathway to other employment opportunities. Because I'm a born and raised Detroiter, I'm proud to serve the community that raised me.\n\n00:01:07:00 - 00:01:18:22\n\nSpeaker 2\n\nJPMorgan Chase was able to help me grow exponentially within my business. I get to bring my children out to job sites that I’ve worked on and they get to see the revitalization of the city.\n\n00:01:19:16 - 00:01:29:14\n\nSpeaker 1\n\nThreads of creativity woven into the fabric. The world awaits our unique magic. Let's fill the gaps with grit and passion. By working together\n\n00:01:30:00 - 00:01:32:18\n\nSpeaker 4\n\nWe make it happen.\n\nSUPER: Make Comebacks Happen\n\nSUPER: Serving Detroit for 90 Years.\n\nLOGO: JPMorgan Chase\n\nSUPER: jpmorganchase.com/detroit\n\nSUPER: Participants compensated.\n\nSUPER: ©2023 JPMorgan Chase & Co.

We see the people.\n\nKelly: My mom had a disability...and I began to see the world as inaccessible...When I first started the company I was really excited to empower people of all abilities.\n\nBeto: I truly believed that I wasn't going to be able to surf again. Being able to get back in the ocean is a blessing using the mats.\n\nKelly: You’ve made something that other people find invaluable. It fuels you to keep thinking bigger...keep making a better impact with your business.\n\nBeto: I don’t have to think about the pathway to the ocean, I just know I’m going to be able to surf again. It’s huge to open up opportunities for everybody out there to reach their full potential.\n\nVO: That’s why we’re here to help make it happen. JPMorgan Chase."
