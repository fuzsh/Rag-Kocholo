        "text": "Andrew Taylor\n\nBorn Unknown Birth Place Unknown Nationality British Aliases Andy Taylor, The Doomsday Machine\n\nAndrew Taylor is a game designer, computer programmer, and musician. He has been creating video games since 1994, and has composed and programmed music for several of them. He mostly specializes in programming these days, and doesn't get a chance to contribute musically.\n\nDigital Entertainment News, Aug 6th, 2004:\n\n“\n\nMy first game was published 20 years ago in the heady days of the 8-bit home computers. I worked for a number of companies freelance until around 15 years ago when I finally came in house. I've worked for companies including Eidos, (then Domark Software), SCI and Sega in the UK, Spain, Germany, Hong Kong and briefly Japan. Around 8 years ago I finally made the move to the states and have since worked for Bethesda Softworks, Legend Entertainment, Pandemic Studios and now 2015. I have over 30 published titles on almost every platform from the last 20 years, including the most recent crop of consoles. I've been working as a lead programmer for around 10 years, and also as Technical Director at Pandemic. I started to specialize in game AI about the time I moved to the states.\n\n„\n\nGameography"
