The fashion industry is estimated to produce up to 10% of global carbon emissions.\n\nTo address these issues, new companies are at the forefront of the movement to re-use, repair, re-dye and/or recycle clothing. People want new clothes. Instead of buying new clothes, they can be repaired, re-dyed and/or re-designed to get new looks. In addition, these companies are also supporting clothing swaps to help people get new clothes by trading with others.\n\nRead More"
