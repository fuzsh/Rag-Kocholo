        "text": "Since 2016, Chevron and the Fab Foundation have partnered to recognize educators that are creating STEM learning opportunities through digital fabrication. To date, we have awarded over $40,000 to formal and informal educators all around the world.\n\nLast year was a particularly challenging time for educators and their students. Due to the pandemic, over 95% of school-age children were unable to learn in their classrooms with teachers. In spite of these difficulties, many teachers are innovating and finding a way to get quality learning experiences to their students, and we wanted to acknowledge them with the Teacher Innovator Award! Fab Foundation and our partners at Chevron awarded innovative teachers with $1,000 to continue their work during this pandemis.\n\nTo learn more about the 2020 Teacher Innovator Award Winners, click below!\n\nThe National Fab Lab Network Act of 2019 has been introduced to the US Senate and is in process of introduction in the House of Representatives, Bill S.2752 mandates a Fab Lab for every congressional district, empowering individuals and communities through digital fabrication tools that promote education, science, technology, engineering and math skills, increase invention and innovation, create businesses and jobs, and fulfill personal, professional, and community needs.\n\n*Alaska and Hawaii not shown due to sizing constraints but also have fab labs. This map shows a rough estimate of fab labs that already exist in the US, taken from fablabs.io. There are more maker spaces throughout the US that do not appear on this map."
