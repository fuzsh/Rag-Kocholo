        "text": "As Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Albert Bourla leads Pfizer in its purpose, Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives, with a focus on driving the scientific and commercial innovation needed to have a transformational impact on human health.\n\nDuring his more than 25 years at Pfizer, Albert has built a diverse and successful career, holding several senior positions across a range of markets and disciplines. The global nature of his work – having lived and worked in eight different cities and led teams across five continents – has informed his understanding of the needs of patients and healthcare systems around the world and deepened his commitment to helping ensure equitable access to medicines and vaccines.\n\nWhen he took the reins as CEO in January 2019, Albert accelerated Pfizer’s transformation to become a more science-driven, innovative company – divesting its consumer and off-patent products businesses and dramatically increasing its R&D and digital innovation budgets. To create a culture in which the company’s people and science could thrive, Albert and his leadership team established Pfizer’s Purpose Blueprint, which included four core values: courage, excellence, equity and joy.\n\nA powerful example of Pfizer’s capabilities and culture was seen in the company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refusing to accept public funding and instead investing more than $2 billion dollars at-risk, Albert inspired colleagues to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in just eight months – a process that typically take 8-10 years – without compromising quality or integrity. A year later, continuing to move at the speed of science, Pfizer delivered the first FDA-authorized oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19 by implementing the same sense of urgency and new ways of working that had made the vaccine program so successful. The company is now applying many of these “lightspeed” principles to projects across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory conditions and more.\n\nUnder Albert’s leadership, Pfizer also has further strengthened its commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles. This includes issuing the biopharmaceutical industry’s first Sustainability Bond addressing capital investments in both environmental and social initiatives; launching the company’s first ESG report; and completing an extensive priority issue assessment to confirm where and how Pfizer can have the greatest long-term impact.\n\nAlbert is a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and holds a Ph.D. in the Biotechnology of Reproduction from the Veterinary School of Aristotle University. In January 2022, he was named the 2022 Genesis Prize Laureate in recognition of his leadership during the pandemic. In 2021, he was named CEO of the Year by CNN Business, included in Insider Magazine’s Most Transformative CEOs list, and inducted into the Crain’s New York Business 2021 Hall of Fame. That same year, he received the Appeal of Conscience Award in recognition of his extraordinary leadership in service of the global community and The Atlantic Council’s Distinguished Business Leadership Award for his and Pfizer’s work on the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nAlbert is chairman of The Pfizer Foundation. He is on the executive committee of The Partnership for New York City, a vice president of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, a director on multiple boards—Pfizer Inc., PhRMA and Catalyst—and a trustee of the United States Council for International Business. In addition, Albert is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Business Roundtable, the Business Council and the New York City Mayor’s Corporate Council.\n\nRob Speyer is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Tishman Speyer. Over the past decade, Rob has led the firm’s global expansion, doubling its assets under management to over $65 billion, delivering more than 50 million square feet of mixed-use development and redevelopment projects globally, and adding more than 13,000 units to its residential portfolio and development pipeline. Today, Tishman Speyer serves the needs of nearly 1,800 industry-leading customers in 30 markets around the world.\n\nRob has driven the firm’s growth and entry into new markets across the U.S., Asia, Europe and Latin America, and the development of innovative new business lines. His accomplishments at Tishman Speyer include:\n\nWorking with leading architects around the globe, Rob has spearheaded new residential, office and mixed-use developments in the world’s most vibrant cities, from San Francisco, New York and Boston to Frankfurt, Berlin, Shanghai and Shenzhen.\n\nRob’s vision for distinctive, progressive place-making has led to new development partnerships with such institutions as Harvard University, the San Francisco Giants, the San Diego Padres and Beijing Capital Steel to create the next generation of dynamic, large-scale urban neighborhoods.\n\nRob co-founded Breakthrough Properties, a life science real estate investment, development, and operations firm that uses cross-sector collaboration to deliver modern environments in support of scientific research, innovation, and discoveries. Breakthrough is a Tishman Speyer joint venture with Bellco Capital.\n\nOver the last 25 years, he has led Tishman Speyer’s reinvention of the iconic Rockefeller Center in New York City and its over 6 million rentable square feet, capped by the creation of Top of the Rock, one of the world’s most successful observation decks.\n\nIn 2012, Rob directed Tishman Speyer’s launch of a RMB-denominated real estate fund, the first ever sponsored by a non-Chinese company. To date, the company has successfully closed on 9 RMB funds with total equity raised of RMB 13 billion.\n\nRob has leveraged Tishman Speyer’s global portfolio and vertically integrated platform to make venture capital investments in 19 promising early-stage proptech firms over the past 3 years.\n\nIn 2020, he led Tishman Speyer’s successful launch of a proptech-focused SPAC, the first sponsored by a major real estate company.\n\nRob has also championed a range of initiatives designed to enhance the health, productivity and quality of life of Tishman Speyer’s customers and local communities, including the tenant amenities platform ZO. and Studio, its flexible office and co-working brand.\n\nRob serves as the Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City. In 2013, he became the youngest ever Chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, the city’s premier industry association, and served in the role for five years. He also serves on the Board of The City, a nonprofit digital news platform.\n\nRob is active on the Board of Trustees of NewYork-Presbyterian, where he serves on the Executive Committee and as Chairman of the Real Estate Committee, and St. Patrick’s Cathedral, where he was Co-Chairman of the Construction Committee overseeing the New York City landmark’s restoration and renovation. He is also Vice Chair of the Shanghai Mayor’s International Business Leaders Advisory Council. An emeritus member of the Board of Visitors at Columbia College, Rob graduated magna cum laude from Columbia in 1992 and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society.\n\nKathryn Wylde is the President and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit organization whose members are the city’s global business leaders and major employers.

From 1995-2000, Wylde worked with Henry Kravis and Jerry Speyer to establish and manage the Partnership Fund for New York City, a civic fund that is capitalized with $170 million in private contributions.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1995, Wylde was responsible for developing and managing affordable housing and economic development programs that contributed to the renaissance of blighted urban neighborhoods across the five boroughs. The New York City Housing Partnership was the sponsor of the city’s New Homes and Neighborhood Builders programs, producing more than 35,000 units of new, owner-occupied housing and of the Neighborhood Entrepreneurs Program, which enabled more than fifty minority and women-owned firms to purchase and rehabilitate apartment buildings that were formerly owned by the city.\n\nBefore joining the Partnership, Wylde worked in senior positions at the former Anchor Savings Bank and at the former Lutheran Medical Center in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. She is a native of Madison, Wisconsin."
