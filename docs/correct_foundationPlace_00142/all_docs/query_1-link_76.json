        "text": "Thank you for joining us at New York City Center. We can't wait to welcome you back soon.\n\nSee Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater perform at the BAAND Together Dance Festival, July 30–August 3, 2024.\n\nGet Tickets Today\n\nFor 65 years, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater has showcased the work of diverse choreographers, amplifying a wide range of voices alongside Mr. Ailey’s own. During this milestone anniversary season, the Company will expand on that tradition, introducing Amy Hall Garner and Elizabeth Roxas-Dobrish to the repertory with world premieres CENTURY and Me, Myself and You, which is commissioned by City Center.\n\nNew productions of Ronald K. Brown's Dancing Spirit (2009), Alonzo King's Following the Subtle Current Upstream (2000), Jamar Roberts' Ode (2019), and Hans van Manen's Solo (1997), as well as a new version of Ailey Classics spanning the breadth of Mr. Ailey’s rich catalog, round out the calendar. The season will also pay tribute to the women who have made Ailey what it is today, notably with the Opening Night Gala celebrating Artistic Director Emerita Judith Jamison in her 80th year, and a one-night-only “Pioneering Women of Ailey” program honoring trailblazers Carmen de Lavallade, Judith Jamison, Denise Jefferson, and Sylvia Waters. On select programs, the thrill of live music will enhance favorite Ailey works including Revelations, Night Creature, and excerpts of Pas de Duke, Masekela Langage, Opus McShann, Love Songs, For ‘Bird’ – With Love, and Reflections in D.\n\nIn a return to pre-pandemic tradition, the magic of Ailey will shine at New York City Center for a full five weeks, giving audiences the opportunity to once again celebrate the holidays with Ailey. Check the schedule online for program details or download a copy of the calendar.\n\nPrograms, casting, and prices are subject to change without notice.\n\nEn Face Magazine is the publisher of Ailey's City Center 2023 program book.
