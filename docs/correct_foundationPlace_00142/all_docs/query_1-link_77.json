        "text": "Guided Tours of Cosanti\n\nExperience the site that launched the movement to create sustainable urban landscapes integrated with the natural world. Our guided tour includes architect Paolo Soleri's design studio, residential and craftwork structures, a live bronze pour (weather permitting) in our foundry, and much more - all exemplifying the handmade heritage of Cosanti Originals.\n\nTo organize a private group tour or event, or for more information, contact: tours@cosanti.com.\n\nBOOK A GUIDED TOUR\n\nTOUR TIMES AND RESERVATIONS\n\nTours of Cosanti in Paradise Valley are held on:\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, Fridays\n\n9:15am only\n\nBookings are made by reservation placed online by clicking the \"Book a Guided Tour\" button above. Prices for our guided tours are as follows:\n\nAdults - $25 per guest\n\nStudents (with school ID) - $15 per guest\n\nTeens/Children (under 18) - $10 per guest\n\nCosanti also participates in the Culture Pass program in collaboration with Arcosanti. To learn more, visit the Phoenix Public Library's information page here.\n\nKNOW BEFORE YOU GO\n\n• Guided tours last about an hour\n\n• Attendance is limited to 15 guests per tour\n\n• Please check in at the Gallery 10-15 minutes beforehand\n\n• Tours will typically feature a live bronze pour but this cannot be guaranteed\n\n• Cosanti is closed for tours on weekends and all major holidays\n\n• Our tour route is very exposed to the weather, please plan to wear comfortable clothes and shoes, and bring a hat, sunscreen, and water\n\n• Our guided tour passes over uneven pathways, stairs, and narrow quarters - if anyone in your group requires accommodations for mobility, please contact us in advance\n\nOur Ongoing Mission of Education\n\nCosanti, a cultural site on the Arizona Registry of Historic Places, is proud to take part in the legacy of education and outreach integral to The Cosanti Foundation from its beginning.\n\nTour fees are collected as donations to benefit The Cosanti Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to influencing a balance between the built world and the environment, the well-being of the planet and humankind.\n\nSince 1965, The Cosanti Foundation has been an important voice in the global conversation about adapting the way humankind consumes resources on a planet already stressed by explosive population growth, a dramatically changing climate, and limited natural resources.\n\nYour visit will contribute both to furthering the mission of The Cosanti Foundation, and to spreading awareness of the philosophy and possibility of living in a way both radically different, and urgently necessary.\n\nCONSENT AND RELEASE WAIVER\n\nTour guests are required to complete a Consent and Release Waiver prior to touring Cosanti. Our easy-to-use online form makes completing a waiver for a single guest or a large group quick and efficient. Additionally, parents or guardians of minors can complete a waiver on their behalf using the online form. Once you've reserved your tour, a link to the online form is sent in the confirmation email.\n\nOUTDOOR CONDITIONS\n\nWhile there will be strategic stopping and resting points during the indoor/outdoor one-hour tour of Cosanti, guests should be aware that the experience involves a good deal of walking and standing, sometimes in the sun. Please be sure to plan accordingly, bringing water and using sun protection.\n\nTours Are Offered Year-round, Excluding Holidays\n\nPlease note that Cosanti is open almost every day of the year but is closed on occasion in observance of the following holidays:\n\nNew Year's Day\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. Day\n\nPresidents' Day\n\nEaster\n\nJuneteenth\n\nFourth of July\n\nLabor Day\n\nVeteran's Day (observed)\n\nThanksgiving\n\nChristmas Day\n\nOn Thanksgiving Eve, Christmas Eve, and New Year’s Eve, Cosanti is open only until 3:00pm. No tours are offered on the holidays listed above.\n\nNo Time to Tour? Come Watch the Pour!\n\nLocals know that Cosanti is one of the best places to bring out-of-town visitors or friends in the Valley who’ve yet to discover Cosanti! Of course, it’s best to take the one-hour guided tour but if you’re short on time, don’t skip Cosanti altogether: come watch the bronze pour!\n\nIn a carefully-choreographed process, skilled foundry artisans deftly pour molten bronze from a crucible into sand molds carved with the designs and patterns that will make each windbell one-of-a-kind. Don’t miss this \"cool\" spectacle where 2,200 degree bronze becomes new Cosanti windbells, a process which has dazzled visitors for decades.\n\nThe bronze pour takes place on weekdays (Monday-Friday) at 9:30am and 10:30am.\n\nPlease Note: On occasion, Cosanti may be open to the public but bronze pours are canceled due to weather conditions (excessive heat, heavy rain, etc.) without advance notice. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."
