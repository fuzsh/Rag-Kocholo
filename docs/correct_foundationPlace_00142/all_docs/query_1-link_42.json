        "text": "When you come to one of our sites you will be asked whether you have any symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting, respiratory infection or other COVID-19 symptoms. If you are symptomatic, the appointment must be postposted.\n\nYou will be asked to clean your hands before and after each visit.\n\nWe ask that you attend your appointment alone, unless you are accompanying a child or a vulnerable person.\n\nIf you have any concerns about coming to site, please talk to your health care professional.\n\nWe have made the difficult decision to continue keeping leave to a minimum until further notice.\n\nWe are able to grant leave that is in line with your recovery plan, for example some grounds leave to get some exercise.\n\nAll leave will need to be discussed with your care team and there are some guidelines that go with this\n\nfor example: making sure you are able to comply with hand hygiene, maintain social distancing and mask wearing rules.\n\nCaring for someone who is unwell can be difficult at any time, but with COVID-19 in circulation it is probably feeling a lot more worrying and stressful as one carer has said “it’s like being in a pressure cooker”. When we care for someone, we do what we can to have all of the answers. We prepare in any way we can to prevent further stress and this probably feels more difficult as the guidance/situation is changing so quickly.\n\nSouthampton City residents\n\nThere is support available for patients who are shielding, and this is being co-ordinated through the City Council COVID support hub and SoLinked. Please read this following webpage to understand more for Southampton residents: https://www.southampton.gov.uk/news/article.aspx?id=tcm:63-426458.\n\nThe Hub will enable the council to respond to requests, using our own resources and voluntary sector, the community, and faith sector partners to deploy help quickly.\n\nHampshire residents\n\nFor residents living within Hampshire County Council please visit https://www.hants.gov.uk/socialcareandhealth/coronavirus/volunteer-welfare or contact the helpline on 0333 370 4000, open Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm.\n\nMore information about support availability both locally and nationally is available here.\n\nPeople aged 16 and over can get a first and second dose of a vaccine.\n\nMost children aged 12 to 15 are currently only being offered a first dose.\n\nBooster doses are available for people who have had a second dose of the vaccine at least three months ago.\n\nHow to get your COVID-19 vaccine\n\nTo get your vaccine you can:\n\nbook your COVID-19 vaccination appointments online for an appointment at a vaccination centre or pharmacy\n\nfind a walk-in COVID-19 vaccination site to get vaccinated without needing an appointment\n\nwait to be contacted by your GP surgery and book your appointments with them\n\nIf you cannot book appointments online, you can call 119 free of charge. You can speak to a translator if you need to.\n\nInformation: If you have difficulties communicating or hearing, or are a British Sign Language (BSL) user, you can use textphone 18001 119 or the NHS 119 BSL interpreter service.\n\nFor details about the Hampshire and Isle of Wight vaccination programme, click here.\n\nFor general information about the COVID-19 vaccination please see www.nhs.uk\n\nOur mental and physical health and wellbeing has been and continues to be impacted by the affects of the pandemic. Here is some general advice and links to useful websites to help you look after yourself:\n\nIt can be helpful to acknowledge emotions of anxiety as they come and try to let them pass on. Try not to reject these emotions, as this can create a bottleneck of feelings and then they can come all at once.\n\nKeep in contact with your family and friends regularly. You could use your phone or perhaps Skype if you have it. Writing letters are another great way of staying in contact! Try to check in on older relatives or neighbours if you can, giving can provide a sense of purpose.\n\nTry to keep some structure to your day. If you're working from home, it might help to create a space for work so you can walk away from it at the end of the day to relax. Here is some great advice on working from home.\n\nOnly look at trusted sources of information. There is lots of incorrect information doing the rounds at this time, and it is essential that you only look to trusted and reliable sources of information during this time. This is a trusted source of information. Others include the NHS website and the Government website. If you are looking on social media (Twitter and Facebook) look out for a blue tick next to the account name - this means the account is verified and trusted.\n\nKeep your body moving! Exercise is a fantastic way to improve your physical and mental health. Whether it's a home work out, getting moving in the garden if you have one, or your allotted time outside to exercise.\n\nMake sure you take time for yourself. Whilst it may be difficult to find time to yourself, it's important to take even just a couple of minutes to process and relax. It might be a bath at the end of the day, or your daily walk outside before the rest of the house gets up.\n\nTo stay fit and healthy, the NHS recommends to get at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week, or around 20 to 30 minutes a day. These website may help:\n\nNHS One You home workouts - easy 10 minute cardio workout and strengthening workout\n\nThe Body Coach - Joe Wicks - P.E workouts every day of the week and a range of other home workouts\n\nA guide to yoga - a NHS guide on yoga, the benefits and how to get started\n\nNHS Fitness Studio - exercise sessions focused on toning and strengthening your muscles"
