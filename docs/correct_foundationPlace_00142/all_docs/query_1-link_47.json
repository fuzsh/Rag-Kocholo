        "text": "Suwichada Busamrong-Press\n\nSuwichada Busamrong-Press (b. 1975 in Khonkean, Thailand) is a Thai American artist based in Los Angeles, California. She is an interdisciplinary artist who begins by recalling her memories in writings and transfers them into paintings, sculpture and performance. Suwichada earned a bachelor’s degree in interior design and fiber from College for Creative Studies and a master’s degree in architecture from Cranbrook Academy of Art, both in Detroit. She also has a master’s degree in Fine Arts from Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles. She has shown her work in various group shows around the country, including in Detroit, New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles.\n\nAndrea De Anda\n\nI'm Andrea, a graduating fashion senior. I grew up in Mexico and moved to Los Angeles to attend Otis and pursue my love for art and fashion. I'm currently seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and grow as a designer, I am excited to work in a collaborative, fast-paced environment and ready to take the next steps and submerge myself even deeper into the world of women's contemporary fashion.\n\nMarcAnthony Smith\n\nMarcAnthony Smith is a freelance toy concept/development designer, storyteller, and student leader who dedicates himself and his work to supporting the creative endeavors of children and the people around him. He is an active student leader and Lead Resident Assistant, known for his honest and welcoming nature for the inclusive environment and fun social events that he creates for all the students at Otis. With a lifelong passion for the toy industry, MarcAnthony has already curated an impressive list of toy industry credits as a student that spans a variety of toy categories from dolls to preschool, to small novelty toys, and beyond.\n\nNick Hermida\n\nMy name is Nick Hermida, I’m an illustrator and ceramicist based in Los Angeles graduating with a BFA in Illustration and a minor in contemporary clay from Otis College of Art and Design. My work often includes themes of queer identity, nature, and the occult.\n\nEsmeralda Escobar\n\nHi, I'm Esmeralda a Mexican American graphic designer with an emphasis in publications and visual identities. My personal practice consists of honest explorations that appeal to humility and nostalgia but also provide space for innovative experimentation. Through design I look for opportunities to grow while merging tactile and digital forms of communication.\n\nAshley Khalil ('23)\n\nHi, I'm Ashley, I am an international student from Hong Kong who is in the graduating senior class of Environmental Design at Otis College. My brand of design is evenly balanced between functionalism and beauty. I believe that structural form should have an aesthetic appeal that simultaneously accentuates the natural beauty in its surrounding environment and that is also driven by practical considerations.\n\nJessica Williams\n\nHi! I’m a Senior in Comm Arts: Illustration, and traditional media user such as watercolor, gouache and colored pencils, whose love of nature, horror, fantasy, and fairytales has inspired an interest in making the expected, unexpected. My work represents opposites: light and dark, color and monochrome, hot and cold, natural and man-made, or playful and creepy. I like learning new things, exploring new mediums, and am not afraid to take risks to get a great result in my finished piece."
