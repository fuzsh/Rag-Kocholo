The Hub will link neighborhood service providers to offer comprehensive support for at-risk children, teens, and young adults to prevent them from becoming involved with the criminal justice system.\n\nThe Art Show 2017 raises over $1 million for Henry Street’s programs.\n\nThe Settlement makes history in April when it is awarded a competitive $360,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to support The House on Henry Street, a multi-platform project, including a permanent exhibition, exploring social activism, urban poverty, and public health through the lens of Henry Street’s history.\n\nHenry Street takes possession of the vacant firehouse at 269 Henry Street, adjacent to its historic headquarters. The three-story firehouse, former home of Engine Company No. 15, had been empty since November 2001, when the FDNY relocated the company to Pitt Street. The new building, to be named the Dale Jones Burch Neighborhood Center, will be home to the Parent Center and Resource Center.\n\n2018\n\nHenry Street Settlement joyously marked its 125th anniversary with events and celebrations throughout 2018. The organization opens The House on Henry Street, its National Endowment for the Humanities–funded permanent interactive exhibition, in our historic headquarters on September 17. A virtual-tour microsite and walking tour is unveiled with the exhibition, as well as a series of public programs for the community.\n\nThe Dinner on Henry Street anniversary gala is held September 13 under the stars in Sol Lain Park adjacent to the Settlement. Henry Street honors the Abrons/Aranow family with the Lillian Wald Legacy Award. Dale Jones Burch, Pilar Crespi Robert, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Credit Suisse, UPS, The Clark Foundation, and Tiger Foundation receive Heart of Henry Street awards.\n\nMore than 1,000 people join the Settlement and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York September 16 for a Community Day to commemorate both organizations’ 125th anniversaries. During 2018, Henry Street launches Humans of Henry Street, a series hosted on our website and social media channels, profiling 125 people whose involvement with the Settlement has been transformative. Henry Street also introduces to the world its miniature mascot, #FlatLillian, to teach the public about our history and the exhibition.\n\nAmid growing national political turmoil, Henry Street’s advocacy efforts take on greater resonance. Team members train colleagues to register community members to vote, and Henry Street holds two town halls, including one on access to affordable housing. Team members and clients march for housing for the homeless and against domestic violence.\n\nMore than 2,000 art enthusiasts, philanthropists, and business leaders attend 30th anniversary of The Art Show on February 27, raising $1 million for Henry Street. The CINEMAtheque party at Metrograph held May 9 attracts more than 250 guests and features a collaboration with guest artist KAWS and youth from the Abrons Center.\n\nThe agency launches a Talent Development Initiative that begins with the July 2018 hiring of Jan Rose as chief people officer, whose mission includes increasing professional-development opportunities for the team. Executive director David Garza is named to City and State’s Nonprofit Power 50 and is appointed to the board of the Citizens Committee for Children and the executive board of the New York City Employment and Training Coalition.\n\nIn conjunction with the new exhibition, the Settlement holds multiple history-themed events. The 3rd Annual Lillian Wald Symposium, Nevertheless, She’s Persisted, is held March 19 with Tony-nominated actor Kathleen Chalfant embodying Wald in a reading from Lillian at Home and a panel discussion of Wald’s enduring legacy.\n\nThe Abrons Arts Center collaborates with ONEOFUS, a theater group focused on inclusive casting, to bring to the Lower East Side the first of three panto-style plays, starting with “Jack and the Beanstalk.” Panto is a centuries-old English musical comedy genre typically produced around the Christmas and New Year season.\n\n2019\n\nHenry Street kicks off 2019 with a Housing Town Hall and Resource Fair, Lunar New Year Celebration at Abrons Arts Center, and the 31st The Art Show and Gala Preview at Park Avenue Armory.\n\nDomestic Violence Program team members and survivors work with writer/director Sarah Daggar-Nickson and star Olivia Wilde on the film A Vigilante, and some even appear in the film.\n\nThe fourth annual Lillian Wald Symposium, City of Extremes: Can New York’s Affordable Housing Crisis Be Solved? is held on April 10. Additional public history panels during the year include The NAACP at 110—commemorating the organization’s founding reception in Henry Street’s historic dining room—and ‘Steadies’ and ‘Crushes’, examining Henry Street’s queer history.\n\nHenry Street issues the People’s Permit Process, a guide to navigating New York City and NYCHA event permit rules, led by Advisory Board Member Shaheeda Yasmeen Smith with Good Old Lower East Side.\n\nA newly recovered guestbook belonging to Lillian Wald is returned to Henry Street Settlement from the Neighborhood Playhouse School archives. The guestbook includes inscriptions to Wald by Jacob Schiff, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jacob Riis, four-time New York governor Alfred E. Smith, and even Amelia Earhart. The discovery is featured in The New York Times.\n\nIn October, Henry Street cuts the ribbon on the Dale Jones Burch Neighborhood Center, located in the restored firehouse adjacent to Henry Street’s headquarters, which had been vacant since 9/11.\n\nIn November, Henry Street receives the Overall Management Excellence Winner for the 2019 Nonprofit Excellence Awards of Nonprofit New York, with special acknowledgment of communications and human resources best practices.\n\nThe year ended with sad goodbyes to two important members of the Henry Street community. Richard Abrons—a board member for 52 years, including a decade as president—passed away in September. Former Henry Street executive director Danny Kronenfeld died in December.\n\n2020\n\nThe year 2020 is monumental at Henry Street Settlement and around the world. It begins with Rainbow Shoe Repair: An Unexpected Theater of Flyness, an exhibition of portraits taken at the beloved Rainbow Shoe Repair on Delancey Street from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. Portraits are installed outdoors around the Henry Street Settlement campus. In February, Henry Street hosts the 32nd annual Gala Preview to kick off The Art Show, organized by the Art Dealers Association of America.\n\nIn March, everything changes. As COVID-19 is declared a pandemic, Henry Street works quickly to reimagine all programs so they can operate safely. Henry Street redeploys nurses to our Transitional & Supportive Housing program and begins delivering meals directly to residents’ apartments to enable them to stay in place. The Senior Center transitions from providing two daily congregate meals to grab ‘n’ go, and soon to meal delivery. Team members and dozens of new volunteers begin making check-in calls to 600 seniors. Many programs pivot to meet online, with ESOL classes, mental health counseling, and art lessons conducted virtually.\n\nAs months roll on, need increases. The agency launches an emergency cash assistance program for unemployed workers, including undocumented individuals; it will distribute more than $250,000. Abrons Arts Center also announces the first round of Artist Relief Fund grants, with some subsequent rounds targeted to BIPOC and Indigenous artists. Henry Street launches a Helpline, staffed with 22 caseworkers to assist in a wide range of social services, including food delivery.\n\nHenry Street launches the Food Access Initiative; the first home-delivery food pantry opens at Boys & Girls Republic in partnership with Vision Urbana. The base of operations moves during the summer to Abrons Arts Center, where more than a dozen arts workers have been redeployed. We launch the LES Mobile Market in August 2020 with NewYork-Presbyterian, employing local young people who make bimonthly food deliveries to 180 food-insecure families living in public housing on the Lower East Side.\n\nHenry Street places 475 young people in summer jobs through a reconfigured Summer Youth Employment Program; additional youth join Rambler Studios, a youth fashion-design program based in Amsterdam and Berlin. Henry Street also launches the youth Community COVID Response Team, which provides information and services to the community.\n\nIn June 2020, NYU Press publishes The House on Henry Street: The Enduring Life of a Lower East Side Settlement, by Ellen Snyder-Grenier, with a foreword by President Bill Clinton. The election season brings the fifth annual Lillian Wald Symposium, “Who Gets to Vote?” in September, as well as voter registration and census events.\n\nThe fourth season of the Netflix series The Crown recreates Diana, Princess of Wales’s 1989 visit to Henry Street’s Urban Family Center. To ensure that Lower East Side children can safely enjoy the holidays, Henry Street hosts outdoor Halloween and winter holiday community events in Martin Luther King Jr. Park.\n\n2021\n\nDuring the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Henry Street provides a mixture of in-person and virtual programming, devoting significant resources to new offerings focused on the direct consequences of the pandemic. The health of the community—mental, physical, financial, and more–emerges as a top priority for the Settlement’s work. The Community Covid Response Team, initially created to provide PPE and COVID education to the community, becomes a permanent outreach program, providing job training and connecting young people to their community. NY Project Hope takes up residence at 281 East Broadway, providing thousands of short-term crisis counseling interventions from February 2021 to the end of the year.\n\nHenry Street receives one of the largest gifts in its history, a combined donation of $4.8 million over three years from Union Beer Distributors, a branch of The Sheehan Family Companies, matched by a generous donor. These gifts enable Henry Street to expand its programming for young people ages zero to 24 at a time when the pandemic has had disproportionate and catastrophic mental health, educational, and economic repercussions on the agency’s low-income, vulnerable youth participants\n\nBy summer 2021, the Emergency Food Access Initiative comes to an end, as three Henry Street pantry sites (Abrons Arts Center, Boys & Girls Republic, and the Senior Center) return to their intended purposes. However, the LES Mobile Market, a collaboration with NewYork-Presbyterian, continues to deliver 40 pounds of food biweekly to 180 families with children in public housing.\n\nOn April 7, Henry Street hosts the sixth annual Lillian Wald Symposium, moderated by Nicole Daniels, a staff editor of The New York Times Learning Network, addressing the Black history of the Lower East Side. Daniels is joined by Rhonda Evans, assistant chief librarian at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture; Lauren O’Brien, public historian; Woodie King, JR., founder of the New Federal Theatre; Brian Purnell, professor of Africana studies and history at Bowdoin College; and Kamau Ware, founder of the Black Gotham Experience.\n\nThroughout summer 2021, Henry Street organizes safe, outdoor community events, many of them with COVID testing and vaccination opportunities provided onsite. From a spring Welcome Back Healthy fair in the Vladeck Houses to three Summer Saturday festivals and three outdoor roller skating events, we welcome more than 1,000 individuals to reconvene after many months apart. .\n\nThe New York State Historic Preservation Office approves a new designation of Henry Street Settlement—specifically the buildings at 265 and 267 Henry Street—as an LGBT historic site. The designation is based on Lillian Wald’s romantic and platonic relationships with the women she affectionately called “The Family” (a concept commonly used in women-run settlement houses), who provided an essential support network for her from the 1890s until her retirement in the 1930s.\n\nHenry Street is honored by the Lower East Side Ecology Center, for its dedication to food justice, at the center’s Fall Social Fundraiser.\n\nOn November 4, The Art Dealers Association of America, with lead partner AXA XL, a division of AXA Group, premieres The Art Show, the 33rd annual benefit for Henry Street, which raises more than $1 million in unrestricted support for the agency’s programs through ticket sales and contributions. This event marks a permanent change in the time of year that The Art Fair is held.\n\n2022\n\nHenry Street Settlement launched “Hope & Resilience on the COVID Frontlines,” an oral history project, on our website, henrystreet.org/oralhistory.\n\nThe project is the culmination of 30 oral history interviews with Henry Street frontline staff members, program participants, and neighborhood residents, recorded in spring and early summer 2020. During this period, Henry Street underwent a significant pivot, with frontline workers creating new programs practically overnight in response to community needs and steering the organization through an unpredictable time while managing their own fears and losses. Thirteen edited audio clips appear in the exhibit.\n\nIn 2022, nearly all Henry Street Settlement programs have returned in person. Lingering effects of the pandemic—a mental health crisis, a shifting economy, and isolation—lead many to Henry Street’s new and older programs.\n\nIn May 2022, the CONNECT (Continuous Engagement between Community and Clinic Treatment) is introduced for people with a variety of mental health challenges. This new clinic without walls offers therapy and support groups as well as a food pantry and ceramics class, connecting participants with whatever type of support they need.\n\nHenry Street’s Urban Family Center (UFC) celebrates its 50th anniversary. UFC is the nation’s first apartment-style transitional shelter with onsite social services for families, and its 50th anniversary brings together former and current team members—including past directors Verona Middleton-Jeter and Geniria Amstrong—with colleagues and guests at Abrons Arts Center.\n\nAli Rosa-Salas is named vice president of performing and visual arts for the Settlement. Rosa-Salas joined the Abrons Arts Center in 2018 and redesigned its institutional curatorial strategy to be more accessible to the local community and integrative of Henry Street Settlement programs. Henry Street continues the NYCHA Arts Initiative, offering free classes to anyone living in public housing in our nearest zip codes. A total of 132 young New York City public housing residents—about one-third of Abrons’s students—benefited from the program in 2022, studying dance, visual arts, music, and theater at no cost.\n\nOn September 29, Henry Street welcomes Little Amal, the 12-foot puppet of a 10-year old Syrian refugee child, who spreads a message of global human rights throughout the five boroughs. She meets with leaders from the Lenape disapora in the Abrons Amphitheater.\n\nHenry Street expands youth programs to serve a wide range of ages and interests, providing a sense of community, connection, and healing. With funding from NYCHA, Henry Street expands summer hours and offerings at the Education Services building and at Boys & Girls Republic, with open gym, cooking, movie night, boxing, chess, and more. School District 1 and the Settlement’s education division launch City Trekkers summer camp, with support from Trinity Church Wall Street. The field-trip-based camp takes children to only-in-New York sites from the American Museum of Natural History to Yankees games.\n\nOther youth-focused programs include Mentoring & Nurturing (M.A.N.), engaging five cohorts of 70 young men in a curriculum of self-love, financial literacy, emotional intelligence, and more. On Ramps to Opportunity (ORO), a spinoff from the Job Essentials Training program for ages 18 to 24, seeks to reach young people who are not working or attending school, helping them launch their careers. Services include resume and interview assistance and job-search help. Eleven young participants in Henry Street’s programs spend the summer of 2022 honing their artistic skills at Buck’s Rock Camp in New Milford, Connecticut.\n\nHenry Street and its partner organization Stacks+Joules continue the Building Automation Systems training program. This program brings under-represented groups into the high-tech field of automated HVAC and lighting controls. Among the first two cohorts of graduates, 36 are working in the high-paying building automation industry by the end of the year.\n\nOn April 13, the Settlement holds its 7th annual Lillian Wald Symposium, What Is a Living Wage: Making Ends Meet in NYC. A virtual panel brings together experts in labor history, economics, the arts, and human services. The event dovetails with the Settlement’s announced increase in its wage floor to $22 per hour in July 2022. Moderated by Paul Sonn of the National Employment Law Project, the panel features Raysa Rodriguez of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, Maura Cuffie of Creatives Rebuild New York, Tsedeye Gebreselassie of the National Employment Law Project, and Samir Sonti of the CUNY School of Labor & Urban Studies.\n\nPublic historian Katie Vogel, together with historian partners, creates the Settlement’s Queer History Walking Tour of the Lower East Side, which is an instant hit. Taking as inspiration Lilian Wald’s romantic relationships with women in the early years of the Settlement, their tour includes many little-known Lower East Side sites of historic importance.\n\nOn November 2, The Art Dealers Association of America, with lead partner AXA XL, a division of AXA Group, holds The Art Show, the 34th annual fundraiser for Henry Street, which raises more than $1.3 million in support for the agency’s programs through ticket sales, contributions, and proceeds from an auction of works generously donated by the artist Tomm El-Saieh."
