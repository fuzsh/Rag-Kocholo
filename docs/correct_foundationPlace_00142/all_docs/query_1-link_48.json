        "text": "Do you have a passion for film? Are you fascinated by what goes on behind the scenes of the movies and TV shows you love? Are you longing to get your hands on professional equipment and learn the craft skills you need to make your own productions? If so, Digital Film Production at BCU is well worth your consideration.\n\nThis course will allow you to develop essential skills with film production technology – from script to screen. Bring your creative ideas to life using industry-standard sound, camera and lighting equipment, and learn how to apply technology and craft in the pursuit of your artistic vision. From narrative design, through selection and testing of cameras and lenses, to creating digital production workflows and using professional sound and picture finishing software including Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro, Da Vinci Resolve, and Logic Pro, you will be encouraged to develop an extensive portfolio of work in addition to that produced for assessment.\n\nBA (Hons) Filmmaking and BSc (Hons) Digital Film Production students took part in a shoot for the documentary feature 'Somewhere in La Mancha' in studio B on the 9th and 10th of November. Utilising the new motion control rig, The Bolt, students helped capture key scenes for the documentary which explores how The Birmingham Royal Ballet and Artistic Director, Carlos Acosta produced a new version of the classic ballet, Don Quixote through one of the most challenging times, during the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe Digital Film Production degree course combines a study of audiovisual technologies and production processes, with contextual investigations and production experience. You’ll develop knowledge, understanding and skills relevant to the production of digital film content and to the wider film, television and video industries.\n\nYou’ll focus on fundamental technical concepts, including the physics of sound and light being recorded during production (and the tools and techniques required to do this), as well as the technology used to digitally store and manipulate both images and audio in post-production.\n\nWhen you graduate, you will be versatile, technically literate, and creative: well-equipped to perform a variety of craft roles within film, television and video production and will bridge the gap between technology specialists and creative artists.\n\nBirmingham City University is a great place to study - the city has ambitious plans to develop a production hub of Film and TV studios to attract productions to the region and you will be on the same campus as students on our Visual Effects, Computer Games Technology, Sound Engineering, Music Technology and Photography courses offering the chance to collaborate on creative projects.\n\nYou’ll also be encouraged to engage with industry in various ways including module assessments based on live briefs, access to Industrial Mentors for many of your modules, and the opportunity to take a 36-week Industrial Placement between your second and final years. You can also register your availability for paid work experience on corporate productions within the University and apply for entry-level crew roles which external producers sometimes require to be filled.\n\nProfessional Placement Year\n\nThis course offers an optional professional placement year. This allows you to spend a whole year with an employer, following successful completion of your second year, and is a great way to find out more about your chosen career. Some students even return to the same employers after completing their studies.\n\nIf you choose to pursue a placement year, you will need to find a suitable placement to complement your chosen area of study. You will be able to draw on the University’s extensive network of local, regional, and national employers, and the support of our Careers teams. If you are able to secure a placement, you can request to be transferred to the placement version of the course.\n\nPlease note that fees are payable during your placement year, equivalent to 20% of the total full-time course fee for that year.\n\nPersonal statement\n\nUK / EU students are required to submit a personal statement as part of their application for this course.*\n\nThe personal statement gives you a crucial opportunity to say why you’re applying and why the institution should accept you.\n\nHere are the key areas you’ll need to address:\n\nCourse choice - Why does this course appeal? What areas are of particular interest?\n\nCareer plans - If you have a specific career in mind, say how your chosen course will help you pursue this goal.\n\nWork experience - Mention any work that is relevant to your subject, highlighting the skills and experience gained.\n\nSchool or college experience - Highlight skills gained at school/college, eg summer schools or mentoring activities.\n\nNon-accredited skills or achievement - eg Duke of Edinburgh Award, Young Enterprise scheme.\n\nYou should also mention your future plans – if you’re planning to take a year out, don't forget to give your reasons. Talk about any subjects you’re studying that don’t have a formal assessment and any sponsorships or placements you’ve applied for. And don't be scared to add in details about your social, sports or leisure interests.\n\nWorried about Personal Statements?\n\nIf you've got no idea where to start or just want to check you're on the right track, we’ve got expert advice and real examples from our students to help you nail your personal statement. You can even download our ultimate personal statement guide for free.\n\nGet personal statement advice\n\n*Non-EU students are not required to submit a personal statement when applying for this course.\n\nEnhancing employability skills\n\nEngaging with industry and gaining work experience during your studies is essential if you intend to have a competitive edge when you start to apply for work after graduation. Getting work experience in film, television and the wider screen industries can be challenging, so we encourage you to take advantage of all the opportunities which may become available.\n\nThe University is eager to recognise students who have made the effort to gain this experience and stand out from the typical graduate using the following examples:\n\nYou have the option undertake an assessed Industrial Placement of 36 weeks between your second and third year, which will provide you with valuable work experience and give you the professionals skills and knowledge that will enhance your degree studies.\n\nThe second-year Collaborative Practice and final-year Production Project modules have been designed so that you can use your practical production work as a basis for the assessments in each case.\n\nThe University encourages you to enrol in its Graduate+ scheme: an extracurricular awards framework that is designed to augment the course-specific skills that you will develop throughout your degree studies with broader attributes which will enhance your employability upon graduating.\n\nAs an international student on this course you will benefit from studying alongside a diverse range of students, all with different backgrounds and experience. In addition to this the course is led by tutors with international experience. You will have the chance to draw upon the diverse cultures and wealth of experience from your fellow students, learning new skills and sharing your own knowledge.\n\nAs an international student you will benefit from studying in close proximity to the UK’s diverse and continuously changing creative industries, and you are encouraged to engage and regularly network with these industries. Through practice-based teaching you will develop an in-depth understanding of digital media technology practices within the UK and further afield.\n\nYou have the chance to earn while you learn, taking on various roles through the University’s in-house employment scheme. You will also be able to access personal and academic support services, as well as help and advice tailored specifically for you. Through an international orientation and welcome week you will be able to adjust to life within the UK, preparing you for your studies!\n\nDigital Film Production is based at our £62 million Parkside Building, part of our expanding City Centre Campus.\n\nOur cutting-edge facilities include four TV studios, including one of the largest green screen studios in the UK with a three wall infinity cove – a perfect studio for Chroma key video production. The studio is often used by production companies and businesses, such as Sony and BBC, to film TV commercials, music videos and live-stream online entertainment shows. This also provides students with opportunities to support and assist with large-scale productions on campus through our Curzon Street Studios.\n\nStudio A\n\nAt over 2000sq ft and three stories high, Studio A’s TV floor is the largest of any University studio in the UK. Studio A could easily accommodate shows like ‘Deal or no Deal’, ‘Blue Peter’, ‘The One Show’, ‘Watchdog’ and ‘Newsnight’ to name but a few.\n\nStudio B / BOLT JR+ (TV)\n\nStudio B is a green screen studio for recording material that will then have CGI (computer-generated imagery) added to form the final image. We are the only University in the country to have the BOLT JR+ high-speed camera robot, which our Film and Media students can utilise for high-scale productions. BOLT JR+ is a compact, lighter weight high-speed camera robot with a longer reach than the BOLT JR. The agile, smaller rig also comes with an increased camera payload (10kg) and is an ideal solution for smaller spaces or location work.\n\nLike Studio A, Studio B is three storeys high. The height allows the heat from the lights to be removed so that the studio floor remains at a reasonable working temperature. All the excess heat generated in the Media Centre will be recycled into hot water for the Parkside Building.\n\nStudio C’s Studio Floor (TV)\n\nStudio C is 1900sq ft, and has a separate production and sound gallery on the same floor. Like all the studios, it is built as a box within a box (to enhance the acoustics for sound recording) and the lighting has been designed so that staff and students will not have to work at height to change the lighting design, this is done through the use of lights and bars which are moved across the grid by poles.\n\nPost-Production Suites (TV)\n\nParkside has four fully professional standard edit suites, based on the industry-standard Avid editing system, which is used in almost all films and the majority of UK television. Though all of the suites can edit, two of the suites are specialised for Audio Finishing and Colour Grading.\n\nDubbing Suites (TV)\n\nParkside has full professional standard dubbing suites. Based on a multi-layered ProTools desk, the suites can dub both film and TV projects with up to 120 simultaneous sound sources. There is an ADR (Additional Dialogue Recording) booth and the ability to record Foley (additional live sound, like footsteps). If additional Foley activity is required, for example to cover a crowd scene, then one of the radio studios or TV studio floors can be used and the sound delivered to a dubbing suite through the technical integration system."
