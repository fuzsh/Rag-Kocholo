        "text": "RECOVERY is an international clinical trial identifying treatments that may be beneficial for people hospitalised with pneumonia.\n\nRECOVERY started in the UK in early 2020 as the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy, a clinical trial testing treatments for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia. Since then it has identified four life-saving treatments for COVID-19, and shown that several other commonly used treatments were not effective. RECOVERY is now open at sites across Europe, Asia and Africa and in 2023 expanded to test treatments of other types of pneumonia including influenza and non-viral community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nA range of promising but unproven treatments are being evaluated in RECOVERY. The treatments being tested depend on the cause of pneumonia:\n\nFor patients with pneumonia caused by influenza\n\noseltamivir (an antiviral treatment)\n\nbaloxavir (an antiviral treatment)\n\ncorticosteroids\n\nFor patients with pneumonia caused by other organisms (often referred to as 'community-acquired pneumonia' or CAP)\n\ncorticosteroids\n\nData from the trial are regularly reviewed so that any effective treatment can be identified quickly and made available to all patients. Please see our news page for results that RECOVERY has found. The RECOVERY Trial team constantly review information on new drugs and may include promising ones in the trial in future.\n\nRECOVERY Protocol v27"
