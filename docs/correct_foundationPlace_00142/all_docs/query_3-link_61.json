        "text": "Tips for Filling Out Applications:\n\n• Address every question. If the question doesn’t apply or the answer is “none” or “zero,” write it in. You don’t want the building to think you have skipped any questions. You also don’t want to use “N/A” as many of the questions apply, but the answer is simply “none” or “zero.”\n\n• Food Stamps are not counted as income and should not be included when the application asks about income sources.\n\n• If you need to make a correction, draw a single line through it. The applicant should initial the page by the error. Do not use white out.\n\n• When the property asks if an applicant “expects to work” or “expects to receive” a benefit, respond “yes” if you have been approved for subsidized housing. The landlord wants to know the response to this question is a definite “yes.” (If the applicant has an application pending or is looking for work, the answer is “no.” If the applicant has been told by Social Security that they will begin receiving benefits, or they have a start date for work, then the answer is “yes.”)\n\n• Always use a stable mailing address and phone number. When an applicant’s name comes to the top of a wait list, the building often mails a letter. It may help applicants to use the address of a family member or friend that is unlikely to move in the coming years. Make sure to list an address where the applicant can receive mail. It’s okay to write “Homeless – mail to [address].” Always update the buildings where you have applied when your address or phone number changes. At this time, most buildings will not send an email when an applicant’s name reaches the top of the wait list.\n\n• Fill in the complete housing history, even if the applicant was/is homeless, in a shelter, or staying with friends. The building wants to know where applicants have been staying and whether or not they were/are on a lease and paying rent.\n\nOther Housing Options\n\nEmergency Shelter\n\n• Call the Shelter Hotline (202-399-7093 or 311), Family Resource Center (202-526-0017, 920 Rhode Island Ave. NE) for more information.\n\n• Immediate shelter for the night.\n\n• No income needed.\n\nHousing First Programs\n\n• Housing programs for chronically homeless individuals and families (staying on the street or in shelters).\n\n• You are identified by your Community Support Worker, Virginia Williams Family Resource Center, the Veteran’s Administration, or through the city’s Homelessness Assessment tool (VI-SPDAT).\n\n• You may be offered Permanent Supportive Housing or Rapid Re-Housing.\n\n• Not immediate housing, as you have to wait to be identified and assessed.\n\nTransitional Housing and Transitional Shelter Programs\n\n• Time limited life skills/recovery programs for people living with mental illness, in recovery from substance abuse, and/or families, among others.\n\n• Some programs require income, some do not.\n\n• Not immediate housing.\n\nSingle Room Occupancy (SRO)\n\n• Permanent room rental program for single individuals who are homeless.\n\n• Share kitchen, bathroom, and living space with others.\n\n• Landlord is usually a program like SOME, Catholic Charities, or Community Family Life Services.\n\n• Some programs are for people living with mental illness, in recovery from substance abuse, veterans, etc.\n\n• Income is required, as residents pay a set rent amount (does not go by your income).\n\n• Not immediate housing.\n\nDC Housing Authority Public Housing\n\n• Rent an apartment from DC Housing Authority (DCHA) or obtain a voucher to use with private landlords.\n\n• Rent is 30% of your income.\n\n• Not immediate housing.\n\n• Waiting list is currently closed and they are not accepting any new applicants.\n\n• Update your information in person at 1133 North Capitol St, NE (Monday-Friday from 8:15-4:45) or online at dchousing.org. Call (202) 535-1000 for more information.\n\nSubsidized Housing\n\n• Rent an apartment in a privately owned building that is subsidized by HUD.\n\n• Rent is 30% of your income.\n\n• Apply separately at each building.\n\n• Some buildings require that you be 62+, or have a disabling condition; some have no requirements.\n\n• They will run a background and credit check on you.\n\n• Not immediate housing.\n\n• Also called Site-Based Section 8 or In-House Section 8.\n\n“Affordable” Housing\n\n• Rent amounts are calculated based on the Area Median Income (AMI) of the DC Area (which is about $76,000 for a single person). Rent does not go by your individual income, but rather by the income of the general area.\n\n• Income minimums and maximums; the minimum income is much higher than SSI and TANF amounts.\n\n• Also called Tax Credit Properties.\n\n• Visit Housing Counseling Services or www.DCHousingSearch.org for more information.\n\nRoom Rental\n\n• Rent a room in a house from a private landlord.\n\n• Income is required; rent is typically $600-700 per month.\n\n• Ask friends and family if they know of anyone who wants to rent a room or look in coffee shops, rec centers, the newspaper, on the internet to see who has rooms for rent.\n\n• Visit Housing Counseling Services or www.CraigsList.org for more information.\n\nApartment Rental at Fair Market Rent\n\n• Rent an apartment from a private landlord.\n\n• Rent is often more than $1000 for a studio size unit.\n\n• Consider renting with a roommate to reduce costs.\n\n• Visit Housing Counseling Services or www.dchousingsearch.org for more information.\n\nHousing Resource Websites:\n\nhttps://dchousing.org/ DC Housing Authority\n\nhttp://dchousingsearch.org/ DC Housing Search\n\nhttp://washingtondc.craigslist.org/ Craig’s List (Washington DC)"
