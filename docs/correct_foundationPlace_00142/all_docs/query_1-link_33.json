        "text": "Studying fine art allows you to find and fulfil your full potential as an artist.\n\nAt the University of Brighton you can focus on a chosen discipline, or explore the broader subject until you find your specialisation.\n\nBecome a part of our artistic community in a dynamic central Brighton art school environment where you'll be encouraged to explore, experiment and create.\n\nUndergraduate degrees\n\nFine Art BA(Hons)\n\nFine Art Painting BA(Hons)\n\nFine Art Printmaking BA(Hons)\n\nBased in our central Brighton Grand Parade building on our City campus. They share common features of being hands on and experimental. All include critical studies, as well as practical application, with opportunities to exhibit your work throughout.\n\nYou’ll work alongside your year group in a studio space just for you: this is your creative place, your artistic home while at Brighton. You can make use of extensive workshops facilities for metal work, ceramics, plastics, printmaking and more.\n\nPostgraduate degrees\n\nFine Art MA\n\nThis Fine Art MA degree course is for artists wishing to push their practice to the next level and challenge themselves creatively.\n\nPhD studies in fine art\n\nAt Brighton we’re internationally renowned for arts teaching and research, and the School of Art and Media has a long history of internationally recognised work.\n\nArt and creative practices PhDs\n\nWe also have research centres and groups.\n\nFine Art BA(Hons)\n\nThis dynamic course is for you if you want to choose an exploratory, avant-garde artistic path. Our students work in all types of media, from collage to installation, sculpture to performance, text to digital. The Fine Art programme at Brighton guides you in imagining, investigating, experimenting and communicating your creative ideas. You will enhance your creativity and develop composition, communication, collaboration and critical skills.\n\nFine Art Painting BA(Hons)\n\nIf you adore painting and want to push your practice and challenge yourself, this course is for you. Taught by an experienced team of acclaimed artists, the degree is well known and highly respected. One of the few painting degrees in the UK, Fine Art Painting at Brighton is studio-based and centred on vital hands-on learning-by-doing. Many of our graduates exhibit their work globally and have made significant contributions to fine art and related cultural spheres.\n\nJoseph Ring, Fine Art Painting BA(Hons)\n\n“The university has offered me so much, not only through the tutoring I have received, but also in the opportunities it has exposed me to, alongside meeting other incredible artists I share a course with. After my foundation there was really only one place I wanted to study my BA. Brighton really has shown me what can be done with painting and how open for exploration the practice truly is.\"\n\nAgnieszka Szymaniak, Printmaking BA(Hons)\n\n“I knew I wanted to take a course that would provide me with a good range of technical skills, as well as the opportunity to think more deeply about artistic practice from theoretical perspective. I knew Brighton to have a brilliantly equipped printmaking department. I am incredibly proud of the work me and my peers produced in response to the pandemic. We couldn’t have done it without the brilliant support of our technical and lecturing staff.\"\n\nVoytec Brodacki, Fine Art MA\n\n\"Brighton impressed me with what I would call the magic of the place. My predictions were correct. I developed reflective skills, gained the opportunity to create exhibitions with other students including displaying work in a gallery space, developing my curatorial experience and organising and installing the display of my works with artist peers. Conversations, comments, suggestions from tutors, mentors and other students contributed to the development of my art practice.”"
