        "text": "Each author will read a few brief excerpts from their respective work, pausing to reflect on the writing process and what it means to “bear witness” through writing—that is, through the choice to remember rather than forget and to remember through writing itself. Together and individually, they ask: What benefit is there to remembering—perhaps something difficult or traumatic—through writing? How might writing aid both the writer and reader in the process of healing? To what extent are readers willing to engage with these stories, and to what extent might readers shy away from stories about a pandemic they would prefer to \"move on\" from?\n\nIn addressing these questions through the lens of memory and creative expression, their work invites us to consider how we as individuals and members of families, communities and larger society experience and understand the personal and communal losses of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n1–4 p.m. | Visitors to the studio will get a behind-the-scenes look at the ongoing efforts to archive and transcribe the 20,000 individually dedicated flags from the In America installations. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg will demonstrate how the flags have been preserved — cleaned, ordered, cross- checked, and stored — and the Rituals in the Making team will explain the transcription process and the database being created. There will be a screening of Jamie Meltzer’s film short, not even for a moment do things stand still, as well as 3D footage of the In America: Remember installation.\n\n5 p.m. | Reunion for volunteers who worked on the installation."
