        "text": "In October 1992, Joan Mitchell passed away in Paris. Continuing the generosity she showed to other artists during her lifetime, Mitchell’s will called for the creation of a foundation to “aid and assist” working artists and serve as the chief steward of her legacy. These two distinct yet intertwining components of Mitchell’s life and vision have remained at the core of the Joan Mitchell Foundation’s mission, driving all of our work. We see the Foundation as a gift from one artist to many artists.\n\nSince its inception, the Foundation has worked through several distinct phases of focus, each defined by the need to find balance between the Foundation’s dual purposes, setting a trajectory of sustaining our mission-based work into the future. We offer this overview of the Foundation’s evolution as a case study for other foundations and an affirmation of the power of artists and their legacies.\n\n1993-2003: Formation & Start Up Phase\n\nIn accordance with Mitchell’s will, the Joan Mitchell Foundation was incorporated in New York City in 1993 by Mitchell’s attorney and executor of her estate, John Somers. Over the next ten years, Mitchell’s estate was in a protracted settlement process. As with many artist-endowed foundations, the Joan Mitchell Foundation’s operating model uses funds from strategic sales of artworks in the Foundation’s collection to grow an investment portfolio and support mission-driven work.\n\nWhile Mitchell’s estate was being settled, the Foundation began its work with modest resources. Carolyn Somers, the daughter of John Somers, led the Foundation in establishing its charitable purpose and through a subsequent decade of programmatic growth. This period was centered on start up and programmatic goals, as the board and staff considered what meaningful support for artists should be, as an extension of Mitchell’s life and legacy. In these early years, defining new programs also laid the groundwork for the Foundation’s core values: a commitment to equity, being artist-centered, and embodying a spirit of generosity.\n\n2015-Present: Strengthening Focus, Ensuring Sustainability\n\nIn its first two decades, the Foundation’s commitment to supporting artists at all career stages inspired a robust range of programs. When Christa Blatchford stepped into the role of director in 2015, board and staff leadership took a step back to consider the scale of the Foundation’s charitable work in relation to its sustainability. The Board and leadership carefully examined the Foundation’s roster of programs, with an eye toward clarity of vision, alignment with the priorities Mitchell set forth for the Foundation, and ensuring the Foundation’s stability in perpetuity. This led to the closing of the Art Education Program and refocusing of grant programs to affirm the Foundation's focus on unrestricted support for individual artists.\n\nDuring this period, the Foundation’s board and leadership also developed a vision for Mitchell’s legacy in the next decade. The Foundation launched the Joan Mitchell Catalogue Raisonné as an independent research project and deepened staff skill-sets in the areas of collections and archives management, database development, conservation, and research.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe changes of the past several years have realigned and strengthened the Foundation. During this period, we have focused on right-sizing the operating scale of the Foundation, clarifying vision and goals, taking stock of our impact, and prioritizing key strategic decisions to further the mission and expand Mitchell’s legacy. Our programmatic work is informed by our values in response to these crucial questions: Who becomes an artist? Who is recognized? Who is remembered?\n\nLooking to the future, we are excited to continue being a resource and innovator in our field, demonstrating the importance of artists and their work, and the power of Joan Mitchell’s vision of generosity."
