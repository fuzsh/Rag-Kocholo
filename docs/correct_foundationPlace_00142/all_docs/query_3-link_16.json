        "text": "The building had served as a tannery and wool warehouse starting in 1924, and the old backyard pit for curing animal hides in saltwater had been fixed in the renovation. “While we were doing construction that summer, it smelled like vinegar and urine,” Isaac said. By the time we spoke on the restaurant’s patio in September of 2020, the Sandovals felt pleasantly surprised by how well The Skillet had weathered the pandemic so far—although they worried about a slow winter. But on that fall afternoon, masked patrons wandered onto the patio to drink beer at metal tables as top-40 music blared, and not a whiff of brine pit could be detected.\n\nMost entrepreneurs in Las Vegas can tell you about the challenges of opening a small business in an old building that’s gone through decades of neglect and reuse. Sagging roofs, unstable brick walls, sawdust insulation, old plumbing. Such is the process in a city that boasts a rich preservation history and a growing cohort of preservation-minded residents. The past few years have seen increased momentum and innovation in tourism and hospitality, what some call a Las Vegas renaissance.\n\nBaca knows this history well: His family has lived in and around the Las Vegas area for at least a century. The Indigo Theater, an old hardware store building that he and his father bought in 1980, still has its original stone walls. Its 15-foot ceiling happens to be high enough to accommodate a movie screen. He often shows family-oriented blockbusters, and fondly remembers screenings of Star Wars franchise films and the Pixar movie Coco. The day we spoke, he sat in front of a Mulan poster dated March of 2020. It was slated to premiere about two weeks after he closed the Indigo’s doors because of COVID-19.\n\nHe isn’t sure how long it will be until he can reopen. That’s a huge loss for the community: Baca built the theater in order to serve Las Vegas residents. As a lifelong film enthusiast who spent part of his career helping old New Mexican movie theaters stay alive during the transition from film to digital projectors, he sees them as critical to every community. “A theater is one of the pillars of civic life. It’s people coming together, sharing life together,” he says. “When you lose a theater in a town, it’s one of the first signs of death.”\n\nBut Baca has been involved in Las Vegas’ civic life long enough to feel hopeful. “It’s a quintessential American town in a bicultural way,” he says, referring to its Hispano and Anglo-European design roots. “It engenders a real fierce loyalty to the town because we all have similar memories of the urban landscape.” Not long into our interview, a thin, bespectacled man passes by the theater, and Baca asks him how his mother is doing. “We grew up on Tilden Street together,” he tells me.\n\nWith logistical help from MainStreet de Las Vegas, he and his wife, artist Tina Mion, bought the Castañeda along with the downtown Plaza Hotel, a Historic Hotels of America member. Affeldt knew that the cost of repairs to the Castañeda could quickly exceed the building’s original price tag, so used federal historic tax credits and New Markets tax credits to help finance the work. Affeldt’s team made the building livable again, filled it with vintage furniture, and halved the number of rooms to 20. (Back in the day, rooms were smaller, and patrons shared a bathroom down the hall; now, each room has its own.)\n\nAfter meeting chef Sean Sinclair at a Harvey-themed dinner in Santa Fe, Affeldt asked the New Mexico native to helm the Castañeda’s bar and fine-dining restaurant. Sinclair says that people started showing up with old documents, pictures, and menus from the Harvey days. “We got to see what the menus and prices were like. Some entrees were 25 cents, and the drink menu was three lines long.” He added historically inspired items—like spaghetti and meatballs, a dish often served on train cars—to his own menu.\n\nThe hotel attempts more than just a nod to the Harvey days; Affeldt preserved as much of the look of the building as possible.\n\n“The light after the Dark Ages was the Renaissance, and these are the darkest times,” she said. “I can only imagine what’s going to happen after. I see us coming back in a very big way.”\n\nYou don’t need to look far to see evidence that good things are still in the works. In the building she owns, Mathews has been sorting food donations to deliver to the local homeless shelter and elderly residents. Jewelers, music stores, and other small businesses line Bridge Street and the nearby plaza, where she’s been helping to run “Cash Mobs” with MainStreet de Las Vegas. Every week, one featured store offers a selection of items for people to purchase during a live Facebook event. The program has raised more than $55,000 for local businesses since April of 2020.\n\nA few doors down from Borracho’s is the E. Romero Hose & Fire Co., the building that served as New Mexico’s first volunteer firehouse. Student volunteers recently gave it a fresh red-and-white repaint, and in 2017 MainStreet won a $150,000 Partners in Preservation grant from the National Trust and American Express for the site. The money was used to restore the building, which will eventually contain a museum.\n\nLas Vegas has drawn both lifelong residents and thoughtful newcomers with similar values: a love of old buildings and an unhurried approach to modernizing the downtown while preserving a tight-knit, small-town feel. “If you have to survive the end of the world anywhere, Las Vegas is the place to do it,” Mathews said. “I joke that Las Vegas is like the Hispanic Stars Hollow, for anyone who watches Gilmore Girls.”\n\nNot long after, her neighbor passed us on the sidewalk. “I have to return your dish,” he said—he’d been stuck at home with the virus a while ago, and she’d brought him food. “I burned the COVID right out of you with green chile,” Mathews said, laughing.\n\n“See, maybe that’s a small taste of the Las Vegas magic that I’m talking about,” she added as he left. “People have good hearts, and we support each other in good times and bad. Las Vegas is a very old community. They’ve survived a lot, and we’ll be back.”"
