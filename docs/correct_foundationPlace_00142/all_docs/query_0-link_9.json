She also does numerous volunteering for our community, one being as Rotarian for our club.\n\nWelcome New Member Morgan Turland Hazel Nevrkla 2023-08-31 07:00:00Z 0\n\nSchool Lunch Program\n\nIn 2014 the Rotary Club of Salmon Arm discovered that many students in School District #83 went to school without lunch. The lack of a noon meal meant that they were unable to focus on learning, so their education was compromised. The club decided to do something about the situation, and so a School Lunch Program was born.\n\nFor nine years, since September 2014, we have donated $160,000 to support a school lunch program to help hungry students get through the school day. Our partner was Askew's whose gift cards were provided to all 25 of the district schools and Parent Advisory Committees, which include Sicamous, Sorrento, Armstrong, Enderby, Falkland, and all the Salmon Arm schools. Throughout the program, we received positive feedback many times from school principals and teachers about the importance of student lunches in the learning process.\n\nNow our participation in this program has come to an end because the provincial government will be taking over. \"Through Budget 2023, the Province is investing $214 million over three years so school districts can create or expand local food programs in schools throughout B.C. The funds will be used for purchasing food and hiring dedicated staff to co-ordinate providing meals and snacks to students. This is the largest investment in school food programs in the Provinceâs history.\" (https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases)\n\nSchool Lunch Program 2023-08-04 07:00:00Z 0\n\nRecent Speakers\n\nWe have enjoyed hearing from two interesting speakers on July 17 and 24.

Following are some pictures from this event, which was held at the Salmon Arm Fairgrounds.\n\nThe weather cooperated with lots of sunshine, but a strong wind during the ride stirred up the dust!\n\nJuly 1 Musical Ride 2023-07-02 07:00:00Z 0\n\nMusical Ride History: Queen Elizabeth II\n\nQueen Elizabeth II took a keen interest in horses and was highly knowledgeable about them. She had a long and close relationship with the RCMP which began in 1969 and lasted over 50 years during which time, the RCMP presented Her Majesty with eight horses and received two from her: Golden Jubilee and Victoria.\n\nThe first and most beloved was Burmese, who was given to her in April 1969. The Queen rode Burmese for 18 years at the annual Trooping of the Colour event.\n\nMusical Ride History: Queen Elizabeth II 2023-06-25 07:00:00Z 0\n\nMusical Ride Horse Breeding Program\n\nWhen S.T.Wood became RCMP Commissioner in 1938, he ordered that all Musical Ride horses should be black, and it soon became apparent that the RCMP would have to establish its own breeding program to meet this requirement. In 1939, Depot Division in Regina officially started breeding black horses. The farm was moved to Fort Walsh, Saskatchewan in 1942 and to its current location at Pakenham, Ontario in 1968.\n\nMusical Ride Horse Breeding Program 2023-06-18 07:00:00Z 0\n\nModern Musical Ride\n\nToday, the RCMP Musical Ride consists of 32 riders plus the member in charge. It executes a variety of cavalry drills choreographed to music. The Ride tours throughout Canada and internationally between May and October, performing at approximately 50 venues each year.\n\nThis year is the 150th Anniversary Tour, and Salmon Arm has the honour of being chosen to see the Ride on July1, Canada Day. There will also be two performances on July 2.\n\nAlberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are also on the schedule for 2023.\n\nFormation Photos\n\nDiamond Formation\n\nModern Musical Ride 2023-06-12 07:00:00Z 0\n\nMusical Ride History 1948-1990\n\nThe war ended in 1945. By 1948 Musical Rides were once again being organized, mainly from N Division in Ottawa. Shows were held at various locations in Canada and the US. In 1953 the Ride performed at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and in 1957 at the Edinburgh Tattoo.\n\nIn 1961 the Musical Ride was established permanently in Ottawa to perform annually in Canada and abroad. The following year the Regina troop performed its farewell Ride, and since then the Musical Ride has been based exclusively in Ottawa. In 1964 performances were held in the Maritime provinces for the first time.\n\nMusical Ride History 1948-1990 2023-06-04 07:00:00Z 0\n\nMusical Ride History: Between the Wars\n\nThe Musical Ride was put on hold when war was declared in 1914 and not resumed until 1920, when the Royal NWMP amalgamated with the Dominium Police (of Eastern Canada) and became the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 1935 Canadian Postage\n\nThe RCMP headquarters were then moved to Ottawa, Ontario, and \"N\" Division was established in nearby Rockcliffe. The division designation was removed in 1987; the current designation is the Canadian Police College and Musical Ride Headquarters.\n\nIn the 1920's the Musical Ride immediately became very popular. Two performances were presented at Ottawa on May 24, 1920 and in Brockville on July 1. 1920. For the next ten years both âNâ Division and âDepotâ Division in Regina performed every almost every year in their respective regions. In the 1930's five performance were organized in and shown in Vancouver, B.C. (E Division).\n\nMusical Ride History: Between the Wars 2023-05-30 07:00:00Z 0\n\nMusical Ride: the First 40 Years\n\nThe North-West Mounted Police was formed in 1873. In 1874, the first 300 members gathered at Lower Fort Garry to begin the March West. They were divided into six troops from A to F, and to distinguish the troops, each one had horses of a different colour. The troops used these letters to identify their new posts on the prairies; eventually the posts became divisions and the smaller outposts were known as detachments. We continue to use the terms division and detachment today. For example, Salmon Arm Detachment is located in E Division (British Columbia).\n\nMusical Ride: the First 40 Years Patricia Graf 2023-05-24 07:00:00Z 0\n\nRCMP Musical Ride - Salmon Arm\n\nThe Rotary Club of Salmon Arm and the Salmon Arm and Shuswap Lake Agriculture Association, in cooperation with the City of Salmon Arm are hosting 3 RCMP Musical Ride performances on the Canada Day long weekend at the Salmon Arm Fair Grounds.\n\nSaturday, July 1, 2023: 1:00PM\n\nSunday, July 2, 2023: 1:00PM\n\nSunday, July 2, 2023: 5:00PM\n\nAs of Friday May 19th you can pick up tickets in person at Shuswap Tickets & Gifts at The Mall at Piccadilly.\n\nLimited tickets will be available at the gate.\n\nRCMP Musical Ride - Salmon Arm kaw 2023-05-16 07:00:00Z 0\n\nChaten's Bio\n\nWe were recently treated to a bio from new member Chaten Randhawa, who told us all about his upbringing in Vernon (where he met another of our new members - Kyle Gadbois) and his work life which took him all over Canada.

Rotary issued a policy statement that any Rotary club in the United States can admit qualified women into membership.\n\nTwo years later, at its first meeting after the 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the Council on Legislation voted to eliminate the requirement in the RI Constitution that membership in Rotary clubs be limited to men. Women were welcomed into Rotary clubs around the world.\n\nAs of June 1990, there were about 20,200 female Rotarians worldwide.\n\nWomen in Rotary 2020-05-07 07:00:00Z 0\n\nCongratulations, Colleen!\n\nRotarian Colleen Fennell holds up the certificate she received from Interior Health for her efforts to improve living conditions at Bastion Place by cleaning up the gardens and providing new outdoor furniture.

Our club has made a commitment to Project Amigo to sponsor two students.\n\n\"Research shows that young people who graduate high school enjoy better outcomes in all areas of their lives--health, relationships and financial well-being and are better able to make choices that positively affect themselves, their families and their communities. Oftentimes the only thing standing in the way of a high school diploma for our young people is the ability to cover the basic costs of transportation, uniforms and school supplies. Your donation will make sure a young person has what he or she needs to be successful in school--bus money, books, school supplies, uniforms, a hot lunch, and weekly support through Project Amigoâs Homework Club.\n\nClick READ MORE for a look at our two students.\n\nProject Amigo 2019-01-23 08:00:00Z 0\n\nGary's Bio\n\nLongtime member Gary Carder presented his bio to the club on Monday.
