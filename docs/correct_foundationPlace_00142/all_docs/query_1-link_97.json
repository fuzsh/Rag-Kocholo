        "text": "Andrew Nielsen: Communication is Key\n\nCommunication is key to Andrew Nielsen's role at Nationwide - a skill he honed at Columbus State.\n\nNielsen started his higher education at Columbus State, earning an associate of arts degree. He credits his Columbus State faculty for their high standards and willingness to work with him outside of class times. The associate of arts fulfills the first two years of a bachelor's degree, and Nielsen went on to earn a bachelor's in the History of Art at Ohio State. That got him in the door at Nationwide.\n\nNow, Nielsen works with a network of brokers, salespeople and underwriters to sell insurance solutions to employers.\n\n\"A lot of courses at both Columbus State and Ohio State focused on writing and communication, which helped set me up for my role at Nationwide,\" Nielsen says. \"I’m glad that I was held to a high standard so that I could be ready to get a job that has helped provide for my family financially.\"\n\nZachary Griffith: Studentâs data to be cited in upcoming paper\n\nData gathered by a Columbus State student might help the next generation of American chestnut trees recover from a deadly blight.\n\nStudent Zachary Griffithâs data will be cited in an forthcoming scientific paper on how chestnuts survive on former coal-mining land. Griffith, who is pursuing his Associate of Science in Biology, was connected to the research project by Ryan Homsher, an instructor at the Delaware Campus.\n\nAmerican chestnuts were well-known in colonial America, but theyâre nearly extinct today. âI didnât understand how fundamental the American chestnut was. It was a huge market for the Appalachian region,â Griffith says. Read full story\n\nFuture Scientists of Ohio\n\nFull tuition for two years at Columbus State\n\nFunded by both the National Science Foundation and Choose Ohio First, the Future Scientists of Ohio program (FSO) provides full-tuition scholarships for incoming freshmen. Students must be enrolled in the Associate of Science major and planning to transfer after earning an associate degree to pursue a bachelor’s degree in a STEM field. The scholarship is renewable for a second year, allowing students to complete their first two years of a bachelor’s degree tuition-free. Students with required grade point averages also have the opportunity to take their FSO scholarship with them for reduced tuition at many four-year universities.\n\nLSAMP\n\nThe Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation at Columbus State\n\nThe mission of the Columbus State LSAMP program is to increase the number of underrepresented minority students who complete associate degrees in STEM disciplines (science, technology/computer science, engineering, and mathematics) and transfer to a four-year institution to continue their STEM education.\n\nLSAMP provides resources, education and support to address academic, personal, emotional, social, financial, cultural and ethnic issues that may affect students’ academic performance and persistence toward a college degree.\n\nColumbus State LSAMP participants benefit from:\n\nPersonal academic advising and tutoring\n\nPeer mentoring and networking\n\nFaculty-mentored undergraduate research opportunities\n\nCommunity service opportunities\n\nOpportunities for student employment\n\nParticipation in The Ohio LSAMP Alliance Conference\n\nFor additional information and to apply to the LSAMP Program, email program coordinator Dr. Randle at mrandle2@cscc.edu.\n\nAdeina Davis – The Right Place to Start\n\nAfter homeschooling, Adeina Davis wasn’t ready to start at a large four-year university. Columbus State is turning out to be the perfect place to start.\n\nDavis started her college career at Columbus State to take advantage of small classes and individual attention from professors. She says her favorite classes so far have been biology, anthropology and African-American Studies. She’s getting a well-rounded education in science and social issues.\n\nThe North Carolina native has her eyes on the next step: She says she plans to transfer to Ohio State University and study veterinary medicine.\n\nShandon Mitchell, business and IT\n\nDiscovering new opportunities with Columbus State’s Honors Program\n\nShandon Mitchell almost didn’t go to Columbus State. He started at a four-year college in 2014, but had to leave after a problem with scholarships. Luckily, a spot was still open in Columbus State’s Honors Program. \"At first, it seemed like the end of the world, but I'm glad I ended up at Columbus State,\" Mitchell says. \"The Honors Program has helped me in ways I couldn't have imagined.\"\n\nThat program also led to an internship at COSI, which led to a job as a research assistant on a project to compare regional accents around Ohio. And if that wasn’t enough, Mitchell helped his brother and some friends start an apparel company while he was still a student as Columbus State. StarStrukt has a thriving online trade and maintains a storefront in Reynoldsburg.\n\nAfter earning his associate degree, Mitchell transferred to Ohio State’s Fisher College of business, where he’s decided to focus on business and IT for his bachelor’s degree. “I’m on track to graduate, on time, and with half the cost,” Mitchell says, noting the value of Columbus State’s low tuition.\n\nExact Track Business Program\n\nEarn a bachelor’s degree in less than four years with this streamlined business program\n\nWhether you want to advance your career or prepare for a new one, The Exact Track Business program can get you there.

Not because of journaling. Not because of publishing, but because of the ability to teach.”\n\nAutumn Spitler – Autumn’s Sweet Shoppe\n\nAutumn Spitler’s recipe for success includes a big heaping of hard work and a pinch of Columbus State.\n\nSpitler graduated with an associate degree in Baking & Pastry Arts, with a Foundations of Business Certificate, in winter 2018. Today, she’s running Autumn’s Sweet Shoppe, a small-batch bakery specializing in tantalizing treats.\n\nShe credits her time at Columbus State for not only building her baking skills, but also her leadership.

Students deliver everything from graphic design and brand identity to web page development and digital photography for brochures, logos, posters, web advertising and marketing services. This gives students a unique opportunity to participate in all aspects of an advertising agency from initial concept to working directly with the client on the final product. Along with the valuable experience, students produce creative work that they can add to their resume and portfolios.\n\nAward-Winning Digital Photography program\n\nDigital Photography has grown into a world-class degree\n\nColumbus State’s Digital Photography program was named one of the top photography degrees in the country by Intelligent.com in both 2020 and 2021. The site ranked programs based on student readiness, return on investment, cost, and other factors.

Many grads transfer to photography bachelor’s degree programs, where their mastery of craft is a distinct advantage.\n\n“Four-year schools love our grads because they really learn their aesthetic and technical skills,” Strickland says, “and their portfolios are rock-solid.”\n\nShaun Barber\n\n3D Visualization\n\nColumbus State helped Shaun Barber visualize a great career. Barber earned an associate degree in Construction Management, which helped him land a job as a project estimator. There, he uses his skills in 3D modeling to bring his clients' dreams to life.

Students put the concepts they learn in class into practice, and the Columbus Zoo benefits from the studentsâ work. In the spring 2019 semester, Columbus State students were largely responsible for planting new landscaping around Conservation Lake, a main focal point when guests walk into the zoo.\n\nWelding\n\nThe structure of society is shaped by welders\n\nWelding is a skilled trade that, when mastered, transforms the student from rod burner to skilled artisan. From the metal beams that support skyscrapers to rods that power automobiles to the puddle that shapes a childâs toy, weldersâ work is an essential part of creating all aspects of modern existence.\n\nStudents in the Skilled Trades Associate Degree Program in Welding acquire knowledge and skills that qualify them for commercial, industrial, and manufacturing jobs in the welding industry. Students successfully completing their degree will also have the opportunity to earn up to a LEVEL II Advanced Welder Certification through the American Welding Society.\n\nJez Alogla\n\nConstruction Manager, Fischer Homes. Adjunct Instructor, Construction Management, Columbus State.\n\nJez Alogla enrolled at Columbus State to obtain an associate degree in Construction Management. âIâd previously worked in the construction industry for eight years, so I felt that I knew most everything there was to know about construction,â he said. âBoy, was I wrong!â\n\nThe Construction Management program helped Alogla become a well-rounded construction manager who understands all facets of a construction project. It helped him solidify skills he already learned on the job, like blue print reading and field management, and taught him new ones, like how to use Timberline estimating software, Auto CAD drafting software, and Primavera scheduling software.\n\nAlogla appreciated that his instructors at Columbus State had backgrounds in the industry, and were able to challenge students at every level of experience. âThey had such a huge impact on me that, after I graduated, I came back to Columbus State as adjunct professor in construction sciences,â he said.\n\nTracy L. Smith: Top Ranked Grad\n\nIf you see a first responder, chances are they're a Columbus State grad. And if you're in the City of Columbus, that goes all the way to top.\n\nTracy L. Smith, who is both a graduate of and an adjunct professor in Columbus State's Fire Science department, was recently named assistant chief for emergency services at the Columbus Division of Fire. Smith oversees 1,300 public safety employees, including all firefighters, EMS workers, the hazmat unit and the bomb squad.\n\nIn her current role as assistant chief, Smith is the highest-ranking woman in the history of the Columbus Division of Fire. She credits her position to her hard work and guidance from great leaders in the division. During her 22-year career, Smith has seen more women and minorities enter the profession, and as an instructor at Columbus State she's in a position to inspire even more to rise through the ranks.\n\n“It’s not significant that it’s me. It’s significant that over the years, the city has changed in the opportunities it gives all people to succeed,” Smith said. “I hope this sends a message to young women everywhere that if they work hard and stay focused, they can do anything.”\n\nFire science\n\nLive burn simulations are vital for firefighters in training\n\nUntil recently, students in Columbus State’s Fire Science program had to travel to the Ohio Fire Academy in Reynoldsburg or to surrounding departments to get live burn training. Now, the department has its own two-story fire training lab simulator, located at the Southwest Regional Learning Cetner at Bolton Field.\n\nThe simulator is built from shipping containers and can accommodate up to 20 students. The Fire Science department conducts three live burn trainings every semester, allowing students to practice fighting fires fueled with natural materials as well as liquid ignition sources.\n\nHelping people get back on track\n\nAshley Weaver knew she wanted to study Criminal Justice, but instead of wanting to punish people who break the law, she wanted to help them get their lives back on track.\n\nThe Pataskala native came to Columbus State in 2018 to take general courses and was inspired by a class with Professor Daniel Hare to pursue a career in the court system. She graduated in 2020 with a Criminal Justice Associate of Applied Science, and her connections in the program helped her land an internship, then later a job with the Licking County Municipal Court.\n\nNow, Ashley works as a Drug Court Probation Officer in Licking County, overseeing people who have been sentenced for drug crimes or are suffering from drug abuse problems.\n\n“I really do love it.

At 27 years old, she had been out of school for a decade. However, she says, “With the support and encouragement of friends, I dove in.”\n\nShe started slow, taking only seven credit hours the first semester in 2018 as a part-time student. Working full-time in sales made it difficult to take more classes. But then Davis had an epiphany. “I realized the sales job was not my end goal,” she says. “So I left a job I loved and took a part-time job which allowed me to take hold of my education goals and be a full-time student.” Davis graduated magna cum laude with an Associate of Arts degree and will transfer to Ohio State-Newark to obtain her bachelor’s degree in Middle Childhood Education followed by a master’s degree in Psychology.\n\nEarly Childhood Aide Certificates\n\nProgram offers independence and a dream job\n\nTwo Licking County women are on the path to a rewarding career with Columbus State’s Early Childhood Aide Certificate, a program to train students with developmental disabilities to work with young children. Ellen Roudebush and Jordyn Hubert are carpooling together as they complete the yearlong program.\n\nStudents spend some time in the classroom, but also get hands-on experience at different childcare centers. The pair have learned to navigate college and use the resources Columbus State offers, such as getting a quiet place to take exams. “Working with children is my dream job,” Ellen said.\n\nDavid Janning\n\nDavid Janning is bringing the experience from two deployments fighting COVID-19 back to the classroom.\n\nDavid Janning graduated Columbus State Community College with an associate degree in Emergency Medical Services/Fire Science in 2011, and has taught in that department for seven years. He's also currently a student in the RN Nursing Associate Degree program.\n\nSo, when the pandemic started, Janning knew that he had skills that could be useful. He reached out to a company recruiting for health care professionals to work in COVID-19 hot spots. Janning took a brief sabbatical from his studies and teaching and immediately went down South with 50 pounds of medical supplies for his first deployment.\n\n“When we can say, ‘Not only are we are teaching this, we are living it,’ it makes teaching that much more effective,” Janning says.\n\nAmbulance Simulators\n\nThanks to grant funding, Columbus State’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) program has three new simulation rig ambulances. Known as “sim-rigs,” they are replicas of the back of an actual ambulance. They were constructed in a lab classroom where the EMS program is based.\n\nPreviously, students used what you might consider “make-believe” ambulance setups. For example, they would place a stretcher in an area surrounded by chairs to act as shelves for medical items that you would need in an ambulance. Staring with this semester, students will have an actual replica of the back of an ambulance.\n\nState Rapid Grants provided nearly $28,000 for each of the three sim rigs. Additional grant funding provided just over $14,000 for the three stretchers and special equipment. They are used by students in the Emergency Medical Services Technology associate degree program, the Paramedic certification program, and the Emergency Medical Technician certification program.\n\nHealthcare jobs are expected to grow faster than any other sector of the economy\n\nStart your career in this high-demand industry with help from Columbus State\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the health care industry is projected to add 2.3 million jobs between 2014 and 2024 â thatâs more job openings than any other occupation. Many careers in the health care field require only an associate degree, and range from nursing to dental hygiene to respiratory therapy. If you plan to earn a bachelorâs or masterâs degree in the medical field, starting at Columbus State and transferring can save you thousands of dollars in student loans.\n\nFrom exercise science to herbal medicine\n\nNetworking helped this Columbus State student engage in scientific research and discover a new passion\n\nA sports-lover all her life, Zeaâannah Slack knew she wanted to major in exercise science. Slack took some courses at Columbus State during her junior year of high school, and she enjoyed the experience so much that she decided to enroll here to earn her associate degree. That decision allowed her to forge connections with advisors and teachers early on, and opened the door to new opportunities. Slackâs advisor helped her land a research assistant position at Ohio State University where sheâs worked on a study looking at the effects of nutrition and exercise for minority students in college.\n\nâThe thing I like the most about Columbus State is that you really get to know you professors on a name-to-name basis,â Slack says. âIt helped me stay focused and get good grades because it was easy for me to get the help and tutoring I needed.â\n\nSlack plans to transfer to a four-year school to earn a physicianâs assistant degree with a minor in herbal science â a passion sheâs developed during her time at Columbus State. Slack aspires to own her own herbal remedy business one day, so she can educate others about the benefits of herbal treatments and create her own affordable yet effective remedies.\n\nPreparing automotive techs for tomorrowâs technology\n\nAlternative Energy Automotive Technician Certificate\n\nIn the last decade, the number of alternative-fueled vehicles on the roads has risen dramatically and continues to increase. From individuals to corporate and government fleets, more and more Americans are choosing these energy-efficient modes of transportation. That creates a high demand for automotive technicians with the technical skills to maintain and repair vehicles powered by electricity, alternative fuels, or a hybrid of conventional fuels and new technology.\n\nFunded in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation, the new Alternative Energy Automotive Technician Certificate prepares automotive students and professionals to step into this up-and-coming specialty.\n\nErica Miller, Modern Manufacturing\n\nColumbus Stateâs Modern Manufacturing Work-Study program helped Miller learn on the job\n\nErica Millerâs first foray into engineering and robotics was in middle school, when she participated in the First Lego League. âAs a kid I was always fascinated with figuring out how things worked. I really liked thinking through problems and evaluating solutions,â she says. Today, sheâs channeling that passion for problem-solving into her job as a technician with Stanley Electric US, Inc.\n\nMiller gained the knowledge and skills she needed through Columbus Stateâs Modern Manufacturing Work-Study program, which gives students an opportunity to work with a local company while theyâre still in school. For Miller, that meant servicing and maintaining robots and equipment at Honda. âItâs great how what you learn at school and what you learn on the job build on each other,â she says. âThey ask me to do things at work for the first time and Iâm like âHey, I know how to do this!â The classes and lab work really teach you the basics so you can jump in when you get a job.â\n\nShane Bendele, Engineering\n\nPreparing students for the workforce and beyond\n\nFor professor Shane Bendele, thereâs nothing more satisfying than know heâs prepared his students well. âProbably my favorite thing that I hear over and over again is somebody whoâs been working in the field for maybe six months, they come back and they tell me âI use everything you taught me,ââ he says.\n\nNadine Reece, Automotive Technology\n\nNadine Reece loves figuring things out â and Columbus State's Automotive Technology department is a piece of that puzzle.\n\nReece became interested in cars through a high school internship with Alternative Auto Care for a semester. \"I love the puzzle aspect of the work, and figuring out the exact root cause of an issue is very satisfying,\" she said.\n\nColumbus State's program gives students a solid understanding of how every part of the car works, Reece said. And although she was one of the few women in the program, she always felt respected and included. \"The camaraderie we had as classmates was one of my favorite parts of the program. Even on long and hot days, it was a delight to be there with friends.\"\n\nArchitecture\n\nLearn to take building projects from concept to completion\n\nColumbus Stateâs Associate of Applied Science in Architecture teaches students how to make a building come to life by piecing together a building project and developing the drawings necessary for it to be constructed. The program covers skills used daily in the field, such as manual and CAD drafting, Building Information Modeling (BIM), detailing, product selection and specification, design, the study of architectural history, and code evaluation. Graduates find positions with architectural and engineering firms, builders, developers, product manufacturers and others."
