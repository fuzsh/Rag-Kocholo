        "text": "Applications are now closed.\n\nThe Queens Museum (QM) is pleased to launch its sixth QM-Jerome Foundation Fellowship for Emerging Artists in New York City. Two visual artists will receive $20,000 each, individual studio space at the Queens Museum, professional development consultations, close mentorship from QM staff members, and a solo exhibition that will open in 2025. Fellows will move into the studios in January 2024 and will have access to studio space through January 2025.\n\nOn the occasion of the upcoming 60th anniversary of the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair, this year’s Open Call invites applications that respond to the complex history of the Queens Museum’s site and Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Applicants are encouraged to join the Museum in critically engaging with the present-day implications of the Fair, which idealized American democracy by promoting industrial, international, and domestic cooperation through technology and culture. At the Fair, the Queens Museum building served as “The New York City Building,” a pavilion dedicated to the country’s most populated metropolitan community. The New York City Building envisioned the future of American cities, hosted the awe-inspiring Panorama of the City of New York, and celebrated the rapid industrialization of New York City in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nTo learn more about the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair, possible themes for artists to respond to, and access a list of available resources, click here.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe QM-Jerome Foundation Fellowship is open to emerging visual artists who have been living in the five boroughs of New York City for at least one year prior to the application deadline. The Queens Museum defines an emerging artist as one who is at the beginning of their public career. The eligible artist has completed their studies, but has not had solo exhibitions at commercial galleries or public institutions, or yet received major grants comparable in amount to this fellowship. The category also includes artists who are well beyond their studies, and may have participated in group exhibitions but have not received extensive press or market recognition. These artists may have exhibited their work in other countries on a limited basis, but have not had major exhibition opportunities in the US or in New York City in particular.\n\nPast and Current Fellows\n\n2014-2015: Meredith James, Kameelah Janan Rasheed, Casey Tang\n\n2016-2017: Ronny Quevedo, Sable Elyse Smith, Julia Weist\n\n2018-2019: Alexandria Smith, American Artist\n\n2020-2021: Asif Mian, Sydney Shen\n\n2022-2023: Emilie Louise Gossiaux, Sonia Louise Davis\n\n“The QM-Jerome Foundation Fellowship was an invaluable opportunity at a critical point in my trajectory as an emerging artist. The experience helped me both expand and define my studio practice. I learned a great deal about developing an institutional exhibition, and for the first time had the both time and funding to make ambitious, new, large-scale work.”\n\n– Sydney Shen\n\n“Even as we traversed pandemic delays and restrictions, there was a deep enthusiasm and unwavering support for my debut solo museum exhibition. The QM-Jerome Foundation Fellowship allowed me to work with a talented curatorial team and experienced staff to research, plan, create, and install the type of immersive installation I have been working towards. I am especially appreciative of how the exhibition integrated itself into the Queens community from items in the gift shop, to educational tours, and a guided sound meditation performance.”\n\n– Asif Mian\n\n“The QM-Jerome Fellowship gave me space, time and funding to experiment with scale, materials, and architecture in ways I had not had the opportunity to in the past…Through this fellowship, I had the opportunity to teach a multilingual and intergenerational ‘zine-making class which allowed me to see the potential of an exhibition project that integrates all elements of my practice as both an artist and educator.”\n\n– Kameelah Janan Rasheed\n\n“The Jerome Fellowship has allowed me to focus on creating a critically rigorous exhibition that reflects my research-based practice rather than being concerned with the artwork performing well on the art market. By having the fellowship I’ve gained an understanding of how production, labor, and research factor into a large-scale exhibition. I have also learned how to interface with a large institution and work collaboratively to develop an exhibition.”\n\n– American Artist\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow are you defining “emerging artist”?\n\nQM defines an emerging artist as one who has had limited exhibition exposure, with no more than a few grants or fellowship awards. You are at the beginning of your public career and have completed your studies, but have not had solo exhibitions at established commercial galleries, museums, or major public institutions;\n\nOR you are well beyond your studies, and may have participated in group exhibitions but have not received extensive press or market recognition;\n\nAND/OR you have exhibited work in other countries on a limited basis, but have not had major exhibition opportunities in the US or in New York in particular.\n\nYou have not received major grants comparable to the amount granted by this fellowship ($20,000).\n\nI have already committed to another artist residency during this time period (January 2024-January 2025). Am I eligible to apply?\n\nUnfortunately artists who have already committed to other residency opportunities which are more than 4 weeks in duration are not eligible for this opportunity.\n\nI live outside of the five boroughs of NYC, can I apply?\n\nApplicants should reside in New York City—from any of the five boroughs—and have resided in the City for at least one (1) year prior to the application deadline. They should reside in NYC until the end of the Fellowship period.\n\nHow are applications evaluated?\n\nApplications will be shortlisted based on the strength of their proposed project, overall practice, and work samples.\n\nStrong applications demonstrate a clear and ambitious vision, strong readiness to expand and experiment in their artistic practice, have an understanding of the context at QM, and add valuable insight and nuance to a conversation around the legacy and implications of the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair today.\n\nIs there a timeline for the selection process?\n\nA jury made up of curatorial staff from QM and two guest jurors will review applications. Shortlisted candidates will be invited for an in-person interview at QM in early December. We hope to inform all applicants before the new year, with selected fellows invited to move into their studios during the month of January.\n\nDo I need to submit floor plans, sketches, or renderings related to my proposed project?\n\nNo. Artists are welcome to share visual materials related to their proposed project if available as work samples, but this is not required.\n\nWhat size are the studios available for QM-Jerome Foundation Fellows?\n\nEach of the two studios is about 300 sq ft.\n\nWill late submissions be accepted?\n\nWe will not be able to accept any late submissions. Please be sure to submit your application by October 29, 2023, 11:59pm EST.\n\nHow is payment handled, if I’m awarded this fellowship?\n\nThe $20,000 award is a lump sum payment that will be paid in two installments. This monetary award covers the artist fee, materials, and relevant production costs for the work the fellow will create for the exhibition.\n\nEquity, Access, and Inclusion\n\nEquity, Access, and Inclusion are at the forefront of all our initiatives.
