Pandemic Studios was a video game developer notable for creating destructible environments that was based in Los Angeles, California and Brisbane, Australia. Some of their major hits were Full Spectrum Warrior, Star Wars: Battlefront, Star Wars: Battlefront II, Destroy All Humans! and Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction.

History[]

The company's president was Josh Resnick and its CEO was Andrew Goldman, both formerly worked at Activision, and they founded Pandemic Studios thanks to an equity investment by Activision in 1998[1]. They gathered together with most of the original team members that worked on the Activision titles Battlezone and Dark Reign: The Future of War[2]. Pandemic Studios' first two games, Battlezone II: Combat Commander and Dark Reign 2, were both sequels to previously mentioned games.

In 2000, Andrew Payne and Adam Iarossi left the Los Angeles studio and opened a satellite studio in the Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley. The first project was Army Men: RTS, a real-time strategy game using the Dark Reign 2 engine. This studio would later develop Destroy All Humans!.

In 2002 they developed their first Star Wars game for LucasArts, Star Wars: The Clone Wars. From this point they began to shift their focus from the real-time strategy genre to the action and third-person shooter genres.

In 2003, the Los Angeles studio moved from its founding location at Santa Monica to a high-rise building in Westwood. In the same year, the game Pandemic Studios was working on, Specwarrior, was cancelled by its publisher, Midway Games. This brought Pandemic Studios to file a lawsuit against Midway Games on May 13 in Los Angeles Superior Court asking for $4 millions in damages[3].

The years 2004 and 2005 were Pandemic Studios' golden era. In this period they developed their most successful titles, like Star Wars: Battlefront I and II, Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction, Destroy All Humans! and Full Spectrum Warrior.

In November 2005, it was announced that Pandemic and BioWare would be joining forces, with private equity fund Elevation Partners investing in the partnership (investors included Bono from U2). However, both companies retained their brands and identities[4]. BioWare's two co-founders, Greg Zeschuk and Ray Muzyka, and Pandemic's two co-founders, Andrew Goldman and Josh Resnick became shareholders and senior executives. John Riccitiello from Elevation became the company's CEO.

In 2006 they developed more sequels for their IPs: Destroy All Humans! 2 and Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers. On October 23, the company announced to have created a second development team at its Brisbane, Australia studios[5].

On October 11, 2007, it was announced that VG Holding Corp., the owners of Bioware and Pandemic Studios, would be acquired by Electronic Arts as of January 7, 2008, subject to Federal Trade Commission approval[6].

In 2008 they released their first seventh generation video game, Mercenaries 2: World in Flames, sequel to the first Mercenaries.

In February 2009, the Brisbane office was shut down[7]. Nine months later, in November, EA cut a total of 1.500 jobs, which affected various studios, including Pandemic Studios. On November 17, EA officially confirmed Pandemic Studios' closure, laying off 228 employees[8]. The company absorbed 35 Pandemic employees into its EA Los Angeles studio to support The Saboteur, Pandemic Studios' swan song, and an unannounced project which was later revealed to be Mercs Inc., a spin-off to the Mercenaries series, which would be cancelled later. In response, four former employees of the studio created an Office Space-style video, where they are shown smashing their office printer[9].

On October 17, 2010 the demolition of the building in Brisbane began after Electronic Arts' long term lease on the location ended[10].

Over a dozen former Pandemic Studios developers are now employed at 343 Industries[11]. Other former employees have gone to work for Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Respawn Entertainment, Blendo Games and many others.
