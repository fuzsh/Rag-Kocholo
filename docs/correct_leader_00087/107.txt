Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was just 6 years old when he became king of Bulgaria in 1943, and ruled (with a panel of advisers) for three years until a Soviet coup abolished the monarchy and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was exiled in 1946, eventually settling in Madrid, Spain with his mother. While Bulgaria remained under Communist rule, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha became a successful businessman. He returned to his homeland in 1996 and formed a political party that won over the Bulgarian parliament in 2001 and installed him as prime minister. While in office until 2005, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was careful not to refer to himself as king, although he never renounced his royal title. "I'd like to emphasize that my job is prime minister of the republic of Bulgaria," he told Charlie Rose in 2001.

Royal Factoid: He was the first dethroned monarch to ever win back power in a democratic vote.

"I wasn't schooled for this specific job, but when things happen, one has to face the music if one wants to be loyal to one's people."
