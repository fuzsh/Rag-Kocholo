        "text": "Key Findings\n\nWith a number of weak spots, Bulgaria falls into the bottom ranks internationally (rank 36) with regard to democracy quality. Its score on this measure has declined by 0.4 points relative to 2014.\n\nThe party-financing regime was overhauled in 2019, diminishing state support and giving a greater role to uncapped business-sector donations. Parties are required to submit financial reports and are penalized for irregularities. Observers suspect that parties underreport totals. Electronic voting was introduced in 2021, without reports of problems.\n\nNew anti-corruption rules have been put in place. While governments have exerted significant influence over the media in recent years, this pressure has subsided somewhat. Media pluralism has expanded, although a number of small and regional outlets shut down during the pandemic.\n\nThe overuse of force by law enforcement, particularly against Roma and protesters, is a serious problem. The Roma minority is marginalized, and the public discourse is increasingly xenophobic. The prosecutor general has acted without accountability, even raiding presidential advisors. NGOs and independent journalists have presented evidence that the officeholder has abused his position.\n\nElectoral Processes\n\n#32\n\nCandidacy Procedures\n\n9\n\nBulgaria’s present electoral code has been in force since 2014. Registration processes for parties and candidates are fair and transparent. Candidate registration requires a candidate to be registered as a member of a party, coalition of parties or nominating committee. For the registration of parties or nominating committees, a bank deposit and a certain number of citizen signatures are required. Citizens of other countries cannot run for public office, unless they are EU citizens running for office in municipal or European Parliament elections. A constitutional clause prohibits the formation of “ethnically based and religious” parties, but because it cannot be applied retroactively, it has no impact on the existence of parties in place before the first post-Communist elections (June 1990), such as the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) representing Bulgarian Turks and Muslims.\n\nThe Bulgarian constitution does not allow Bulgarian citizens with dual citizenship to run as candidates or serve in office, a requirement which runs against international best practices. This became relevant in the case of Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, whose status as a dual citizen of Bulgaria and Canada became the object of a Constitutional Court case in the fall of 2021. Petkov, who had served as minister of the economy under Stefan Yanev’s caretaker government in the summer of 2021 and was elected as prime minister by parliament following the November 2021 elections, renounced his Canadian citizenship in April 2021. However, because the procedure was not formally complete until August 2021, the court retroactively overturned his appointment as minister of the economy, effectively upholding the constitutional ban on citizens with foreign passports running for public office. No changes in this area are anticipated for the near future.\n\nContrary to best practices and OSCE recommendations, voter registration remains strict with regard to those who fail to meet the registration deadlines.\n\nMedia Access\n\n5\n\nMedia access for candidates and parties differs between publicly and privately run media. The public broadcast media – one TV and one radio station with several channels each – are required by law to provide full and balanced coverage and to set aside presentation time for every candidate and registered party or coalition. With a large number of parties or candidates usually in the running, splitting the time between each is a serious challenge. Between electoral campaigns, parties not already represented in parliament have little access to public media, especially if they are considered to be potentially serious competitors by the incumbent parties.\n\nCandidates with enough resources face no restrictions to access in private media outlets. Most national private TV and radio broadcasters, with the exception of broadcasters with close relationships to (or owned by) political parties and/or leaders, remain relatively objective throughout campaigns.\n\nMost candidates relied heavily on internet media during the four electoral campaigns of 2021.\n\nCitations:\n\nPrice, L.

In: Eric Freedman, Robyn S. Goodman, Elanie Steyn (eds.), Critical Perspectives on Journalistic Beliefs and Actions. London/ New York: Routledge, 211-221.\n\nVoting and Registration Rights\n\n7\n\nBulgarian voters are registered by default through voter lists maintained by the municipalities. Voter lists are published in advance of election day, and voters can also check online to see if they are on the lists. Every person who is not included in the voter list at their place of residence can ask to be included, and if not included can appeal to the courts. However, concerns persist as to whether persons without a permanent address (about 1% of the population), most of them Roma, are not registered in voter lists. Bulgarian citizens residing abroad have the right to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections, as well as in national referendums. In May 2021, the electoral code was amended to introduce electronic voting for most voters and to remove the limitations on the total number of polling stations that can be established abroad. There were no reports of irregularities affecting the implementation of electronic voting during the parliamentary elections in November 2021.\n\nContrary to ECHR recommendations, people serving prison sentences are not allowed to vote. Citizens can obtain permits to vote outside of their permanent place of residence\n\nCitations:\n\nOSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights: Republic of Bulgaria. Early Parliamentary Elections 11 July 2021. ODIHR Limited Election Observation Mission Final Report, Warsaw, 22 October 2021. https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/8/b/502110.pdf\n\nParty Financing\n\n4\n\nParty financing in Bulgaria is regulated by the Political Parties Act. The party-financing regime was significantly overhauled in 2019, which resulted in decreasing the annual support provided to parties with more than 1% of the vote in the last parliamentary election from BGN 11 to BGN 1 per voter. To compensate for this loss of revenues, the prohibition on donations from businesses was eliminated.\n\nThe decline in state subsidies for parties is likely to weaken the parties with high vote shares. The greater reliance on business-sector money is likely to create linkages between parties and business interests.\n\nParty financing is overseen by the Audit Office, and parties are obliged to submit an annual financial report of all their properties as well as an income statement. Reports must also be submitted after each electoral campaign; reports on budgets larger than €25,000 must be certified by an independent auditor.\n\nA recent report on campaign spending during the last parliamentary elections of 2021 finds that one of the smaller parties represented in parliament spent the most on the campaign. Given the transparency associated with this party, it seems plausible that some mainstream parties may be under-reporting how much they spend on their campaigns.\n\nCitations:\n\nhttps://openparliament.net/2022/02/01/17642/\n\nDo citizens have the opportunity to take binding political decisions when they want to do so?\n\n10\n\n9\n\nCitizens have the effective opportunity to actively propose and take binding decisions on issues of importance to them through popular initiatives and referendums. The set of eligible issues is extensive, and includes national, regional, and local issues.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nCitizens have the effective opportunity to take binding decisions on issues of importance to them through either popular initiatives or referendums. The set of eligible issues covers at least two levels of government.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nCitizens have the effective opportunity to vote on issues of importance to them through a legally binding measure. The set of eligible issues is limited to one level of government.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nCitizens have no effective opportunity to vote on issues of importance to them through a legally binding measure.\n\nPopular Decision-Making\n\n7\n\nThe list of eligible referendums issues is restrictive, fiscal/tax issues cannot be addressed, political and judicial nominations are also excluded. If backers of a referendum collect a minimum of 200,000 signatures in support of the referendum, they can address parliament to call for a referendum. If 400,000 signatures are presented, parliament is obliged to call a referendum but can, within certain limits, edit the questions posed. The outcome of referendums is binding only if voter turnout is higher than in the last general election.\n\nNational referendums were held in 2013, 2015 and 2016, turnout levels were not high enough to make the results obligatory for the parliament.\n\nRequirements for local referendums are less stringent than those for national referendums, and 10% of voters with permanent residence in the municipality can make a binding proposal for a referendum. If more than 40% of voters with permanent residence participate, the local referendum is binding for the local government. Three local referendums were held in 2017, and another two in 2019. In one case in 2019, voter turnout was high enough to make the results binding.\n\nAccess to Information\n\n#36\n\nMedia Freedom\n\n3\n\nIn legal terms, media are independent of the government. All electronic media – public or private – are subject to licensing by two independent state agencies: the Council for Electronic Media (issuing programming licenses) and the Commission for Regulation of Communications (for radio frequencies and other technological aspects of electronic media). The management of the public Bulgarian National Television and Bulgarian National Radio are elected by the Council for Electronic Media.\n\nIn practice, however, media independence has been compromised since 2010-2011, a situation that has only worsened during the review period. After a series of well-known investigative electronic-media journalists lost their positions and on-air exposure over the last two years, the public radio’s leading station was pressured into actually shutting down for several hours with the sole purpose of keeping a particular investigative journalist off the air. This journalist had been asking inconvenient questions about the selection procedure for the new prosecutor general in September 2019. This caused a major crisis, and forced the Council for Electronic Media to fire the recently elected executive director of the radio service. In the process, it became clear that the decision to shut down the broadcast was a result of outside pressure by unrevealed persons.\n\nDifferent governing parties have either sought or tacitly succeeded in restricting media freedoms, particularly during periods of public discontent and protests. The BSP and MRF did so in 2013-2014, and GERB in 2020. In 2021, six alerts concerning attacks and the harassment of journalists were registered on a Council of Europe platform established to protect journalists.\n\nA major development in the media space has been the growth of non-traditional outlets.\n\nDuring the 2021 elections, many candidates and journalists used public registries and data in their campaigns. The refusals of some public officials to disclose information publicly ended up being challenged in administrative courts, and the caretaker governments did their best to disclose as much information as possible. Access to information thus seems to have improved somewhat.\n\nCitations:\n\nAccess to Information Program (https://www.aip-bg.org/en/)\n\nCouncil of Europe Platform to promote the protection of journalism and safety of journalists https://fom.coe.int/accueil\n\nTo what extent are the media characterized by an ownership structure that ensures a pluralism of opinions?\n\n10\n\n9\n\nDiversified ownership structures characterize both the electronic and print media market, providing a well-balanced pluralism of opinions. Effective anti-monopoly policies and impartial, open public media guarantee a pluralism of opinions.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nDiversified ownership structures prevail in the electronic and print media market. Public media compensate for deficiencies or biases in private media reporting by representing a wider range of opinions.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nOligopolistic ownership structures characterize either the electronic or the print media market. Important opinions are represented but there are no or only weak institutional guarantees against the predominance of certain opinions.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nOligopolistic ownership structures characterize both the electronic and the print media market. Few companies dominate the media, most programs are biased, and there is evidence that certain opinions are not published or are marginalized.\n\nMedia Pluralism\n\n4\n\nMedia pluralism in Bulgaria is supported by a diversified ownership structure. The sheer plurality of media outlets ensures relatively broad coverage of different points of view. At the same time, however, the ownership structure is often opaque, allowing for hidden interests to operate. That said, at least one well-known de facto owner of print media (Delyan Peevski) has made his ownership official. Pluralism of opinions is greater in the radio and print media than in the TV sector.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Peevski was sanctioned by the U.S. government under the so-called Magnitski Act. Even the media outlets that he effectively owns have made modes attempts to live up to higher standards.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further eroded the financial resources of media, forcing several smaller and regional outlets to shut down. Different media, from TV, radio, new papers and internet outlets, have their own political preferences but the diversity of opinion as well as the respect of facts media and ethics seem to have improved since the ousting of the GERB-led governments in 2021. Public radio and TV outlets have led the way toward facilitating a pluralism of opinions after years of tacit but harsh pressure from the government and politicians.\n\nCitations:\n\nEuropean Commission: 2021 Rule of Law Report. Country Chapter on the rule of law situation in Bulgaria, Brussels 20.7.2021 SWD(2021) 703 final\n\nTo what extent can citizens obtain official information?\n\n10\n\n9\n\nLegal regulations guarantee free and easy access to official information, contain few, reasonable restrictions, and there are effective mechanisms of appeal and oversight enabling citizens to access information.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nAccess to official information is regulated by law. Most restrictions are justified, but access is sometimes complicated by bureaucratic procedures. Existing appeal and oversight mechanisms permit citizens to enforce their right of access.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nAccess to official information is partially regulated by law, but complicated by bureaucratic procedures and some poorly justified restrictions. Existing appeal and oversight mechanisms are often ineffective.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nAccess to official information is not regulated by law; there are many restrictions of access, bureaucratic procedures and no or ineffective mechanisms of enforcement.\n\nAccess to Government Information\n\n7\n\nAccess to government information for citizens is guaranteed by the Bulgarian constitution and regulated by the Access to Public Information Act originally adopted in 2000. It ensures a high level of access for citizens to government information, and refusals to provide information can be appealed in court. Civil society actors and organizations have exercised their right to court appeals, which has fostered robust court activity. In recent years, the amount of government information made freely and promptly available on the internet has increased markedly, so that the need for formal requests for information has declined. The most common excuse for refusing to release information is that interests of third parties may be affected, while confidentiality and classified information considerations come a distant second. This is the conclusion one can derive from the Access to Information Program annual reports\n\nThird-party interests has been the most-cited reason given for not releasing information on the part of the National Electric Company and the state-owned natural gas monopoly, Bulgargas.\n\nAccess to public information is typically weak in the area of public procurement. Public procurement regulations were amended over a five-year period (2015-2020) to allow for “in-house,” non-competitive and non-public decisions to be made by the procuring government agency. This practice has been abandoned by the 2021 governments.\n\nCitations:\n\nAccess to Information Programme Foundation (2019): Access to information in Bulgaria in 2018.

In practice, rights are generally respected by state agencies and citizens have legal recourse in cases involving infringement. Cases are also regularly heard at the European Court of Human Rights. Citizens actively use the administrative-justice process to challenge the actions of state agencies, and the courts regularly side with citizen plaintiffs.\n\nThe courts generally uphold efforts to protect property rights, despite recent attempts to amend legislation that would permit violations of property rights go unchecked. Even when the government and public prosecutors took illegal action against former government beneficiaries and their relatives (2019 – early 2021), the courts have upheld the constitutional protection of property rights.\n\nThe most frequent and serious rights violations are the overuse of force by law-enforcing government bodies, especially against Roma. The Commission for Protection against Discrimination has observed more frequent complaints about hate speech in media, online publications and social networks. Citizens regularly report failures to investigate and protect rights related to some types of crimes, especially crimes against property.\n\nTo what extent does the state concede and protect political liberties?\n\n10\n\n9\n\nAll state institutions concede and effectively protect political liberties.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nAll state institutions for the most part concede and protect political liberties. There are only few infringements.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nState institutions concede political liberties but infringements occur regularly in practice.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nPolitical liberties are unsatisfactory codified and frequently violated.\n\nPolitical Liberties\n\n8\n\nPolitical liberties are guaranteed in Bulgaria by the constitution and relevant laws. Bulgarians enjoy the freedom to express themselves, to assemble and organize themselves (also for explicitly political purposes), to practice their religious beliefs and to petition the government. Bulgarians have clearly established rights to speak freely, assemble and protest. The freedom of expression has suffered from the declining independence of the traditional media, but has been strengthened by the opportunities provided by the internet.\n\nIn 2020, these rights were confirmed by a number of protests that were allowed to take place without interference, and by the registration of a new party established by popular TV personality Slavi Trifonov.\n\nIn 2020, with the prosecutor general’s consent, prosecutors and police investigators illegally videotaped more than a thousand peaceful protesters, many of whom as well as one journalist, were subject to police brutality. In the context of the protest, the prosecutor general himself initiated several investigations of protesters, referring to them as “national traitors.”\n\nCitations:\n\nVassileva, R. (2019): Framing and Raiding. Bulgaria’s Kafkaesque Prosecutor’s Office,\n\nhttps://verfassungsblog.de/framing-and-raiding/ 09 June 2021\n\nHow effectively does the state protect against different forms of discrimination?\n\n10\n\n9\n\nState institutions effectively protect against and actively prevent discrimination. Cases of discrimination are extremely rare.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nState anti-discrimination protections are moderately successful. Few cases of discrimination are observed.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nState anti-discrimination efforts show limited success. Many cases of discrimination can be observed.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nThe state does not offer effective protection against discrimination. Discrimination is widespread in the public sector and in society.\n\nNon-discrimination\n\n5\n\nThe Bulgarian constitution, the 2004 Anti-Discrimination Act and various EU directives aim to provide protection against discrimination. There is a Commission for Protection against Discrimination, and citizens have access to the courts in cases of suspected discrimination. In practice, instances of discrimination can be frequently observed, especially against the highly marginalized Roma minority. There is some labor market discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, and ethnicity. Public discourse has become increasingly xenophobic, as explicitly nationalistic parties serve in the ruling coalition and routinely rely on agitation during election campaigns. The government failed to push through the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, and some portions of it were pronounced unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.\n\nRule of Law\n\n#37\n\nLegal Certainty\n\n4\n\nBulgaria’s government is legalistic and favors a strict interpretation of the legal code in justifying its actions. Another problem is the legal consistency of the content of the law. Executive action is not only relatively unpredictable, but may be applied ad hoc, thus creating privileges and inequality before the law.\n\nDeficiencies in the area of the rule of law crowd out FDIs. There were attempts led by prosecutors and individual judges to redistribute market and economic influence in 2014, 2016-2017 (against foreign interests) and 2019-2020. These efforts failed, however, thanks to the fact that EU ambassadors, investigative journalists and NGOs targeting corruption made this information public. It is anybody’s guess what the situation was with local companies that have no foreign ambassadors to speak out for them.\n\nIn the period from 2015 to 2019, Bulgaria’s prosecutor general, who was able to act without accountability, created and/or gained control over specialized organs of the justice system (i.e., commissions tasked with special investigations, prosecution and forfeiture, anti-corruption efforts and conflict of interests). These “reforms” were ostensibly pursued in an effort to fight high-profile cases of corruption, terrorism and organized crime but, in fact, served instead as an instrument of protection and racketeering.\n\nThe situation deteriorated after the election of Ivan Geshev as prosecutor general in December 2019, who has proven to be inefficient, demonstrated clear bias in his interpretation of certain cases, failed to presume innocence until proven guilty in specific cases and has publicly taken issue with the division of powers. In June 2020, prosecutors raided the offices of two advisors to then-President Radev. The prosecutors explained the action as part of their investigation of suspected influence peddling and disclosure of state secrets. Many protesters viewed the raids as attacks carried out by the prosecutor general and motivated by an escalating conflict between Radev and Borissov.\n\nMarking a setback for prosecutorial reform in Bulgara, the Constitutional Court ruled in 2021 against a new law designed to establish accountability and criminal liability for the office of the prosecutor general, stating that the law was in violation of the constitution.\n\nThe first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 saw increased activity on the part of the prosecutor general. The non-parliamentary opposition, NGOs and independent journalists increased their criticism and disseminated factual evidence of embezzlement, extortion and abuse of public office with the help of individual prosecutors.\n\nCitations:\n\nhttps://acf.bg/en/osemte-dzhudzheta/\n\nTo what extent do independent courts control whether government and administration act in conformity with the law?\n\n10\n\n9\n\nIndependent courts effectively review executive action and ensure that the government and administration act in conformity with the law.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nIndependent courts usually manage to control whether the government and administration act in conformity with the law.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nCourts are independent, but often fail to ensure legal compliance.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nCourts are biased for or against the incumbent government and lack effective control.\n\nJudicial Review\n\n5\n\nCourts in Bulgaria are formally independent from other branches of power and have large competencies to review the actions and normative acts of the executive. Court reasoning and decisions are sometimes influenced by outside factors, including informal political pressure and, more importantly, the influence of private sector groups and individuals through corruption and nepotism.\n\nSince 2015, judges have become formally more independent from prosecutors and investigators in the Supreme Judicial Council, although the prosecutor general has had informal leverage to influence Council decisions through different standing committees and Council members from the investigation.\n\nHowever, despite the formal independence of various committees within the Council, its work remains politicized and its decisions are influenced by the political establishment. The office of the prosecutor general also lacks transparency and accountability. The Council was heavily criticized in 2019 for the highly opaque and non-competitive manner in which it went about appointing a new prosecutor general, which met with public protest.\n\nDespite the fact that judges who decide in favor of the government are promoted more quickly than judges who act independently, the latter continue to act with integrity in observation of the law and legal procedures. However, the judiciary’s ability to act as a check on the executive has been compromised in many ways.\n\nCitations:\n\nEuropean Commission (2019): Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Progress in Bulgaria under the Co-operation and Verification Mechanism.

This is balanced by the fact that three different bodies are involved, and appointments are spread over time. Equal shares of the 12 justices of the Constitutional Court are appointed personally by the president, by the National Assembly with a simple majority, and by a joint plenary of the justices of the two supreme courts (the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court), also with a simple majority. Justices serve nine-year mandates, with four justices being replaced every three years. The most recent election was among 10 candidates.\n\nOne of the challenges in 2021 was the uncertainty surrounding the election of the individual to act as chair of the Supreme Court of Cassation by the existing Council, whose members include individuals who are not judges and has a record of engaging in suspicious activity. On 14 January 2022, after six hours of a publicly broadcasted hearing, a female judge with an impeccable reputation was elected to the post. As the first woman in the country to hold this position, her election bodes well for improvements in the appointment and career prospects of junior judges.\n\nTo what extent are public officeholders prevented from abusing their position for private interests?\n\n10\n\n9\n\nLegal, political and public integrity mechanisms effectively prevent public officeholders from abusing their positions.\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\nMost integrity mechanisms function effectively and provide disincentives for public officeholders willing to abuse their positions.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nSome integrity mechanisms function, but do not effectively prevent public officeholders from abusing their positions.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nPublic officeholders can exploit their offices for private gain as they see fit without fear of legal consequences or adverse publicity.\n\nCorruption Prevention\n\n4"
