        "text": "The prime minister, formerly known as Simeon II, was just six when his father King Boris III died suddenly in 1943. A year later, a Soviet-led coup triggered theexecution of the three-member regency, including Simeon’s uncle Kiril, who were performing the monarchy’s functions while the young king was at school.\n\nWhen a referendum (quite probably rigged) calling for the monarchy’s abolition was passed in 1946, Simeon’s mother Queen Joanna fled to Egypt, taking him and his sister, Princess Maria-Luisa.\n\nFast forward 55 years and a balding ex-king with a grey-flecked beard takes over as head of a democratically-elected government.\n\nThe National Movement Simeon II (NMSII) won a landslide victory in the 2001 general election by tapping into a reservoir of both disenchantment with Ivan Kostov’s outgoing administration and goodwill towards a man his compatriots still call ‘the king’.\n\nAnd by making a promise it could not keep.\n\nWithin 800 days, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha predicted, Bulgarians would have heavier wallets, thanks to the era of “economic and spiritual renewal” he would usher in.\n\nThose 800 days elapsed in October last year. A parliamentary debate saw members of the junior coalition partner, the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), distancing themselves from the remarks.\n\nMRF leader Ahmed Dogan reflected the feeling that, despite an official decline in unemployment, many Bulgarians were worse-off than they were before the prime minister took office: “So far, people have not seen the 5% GDP [gross domestic product] growth in their fridges and this is not good.”\n\n“Nobody could fulfil those promises in 800 days,” remarks Ognyan Minchev, director of the Sofia Institute for Regional and Institutional Studies.\n\n“He ran on a completely populist ticket and he pledged to be a good patriarch, a good king. There were high expectations about the king. And this has been built up on two components – the first was that the pain people had to go through during 12-13 years of transition [since the collapse of communism] was so deep many started to look for a miracle to get out of their desperation. The second was his appeal as a king, just because of the particular irrational charisma about a king.”\n\nOne Bulgarian who has become richer in recent years, however, is Saxe-Coburg-Gotha himself.\n\nIn 2001, the Sofia authorities returned the Vrana palace in the country’s capital to him, complete with its verdant lawns, fountains and fish-ponds.\n\nYet this oasis of tranquillity has become the focus of a fierce legal battle. The heirs of the palace’s former owner, Hadj Bone Petrov, have started proceedings against the restitution in Sofia City Court. Their case has won support from a number of parliamentarians.\n\n“He is a very helpless prime minister, who unfortunately has looked very well after himself rather than Bulgarians as a whole,” said Anastasia Dimitrova, co-chairman of agrarian party, the People’s Union (BANU), during a visit to Brussels last week. “He has been restituted a lot of property and, according to lawyers, he did not have a right to those properties.”\n\nYet, while Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has been fretting about his property, his compatriots have been voting with their feet. Last year, the traffic in Sofia was regularly disrupted by protests from teachers and doctors seeking better pay, senior citizens seeking better pensions, taxi drivers angered by a proposed rise in excise duties on petrol and farmers troubled by a crisis in wheat production. Moreover, there has been a war between crime bosses, which has seen gangland killings in the capital, prompting both opposition politicians and international commentators to argue that the government lacks a coherent strategy on lawlessness.\n\n“Generally, the corruption and crime rates are growing, with the understanding of organized criminals that institutions at government level are weak – and that there is an absence of an opposition that could take over and strengthen the government system,” says Ognyan Minchev.\n\n“They [the crime bosses] don’t feel vulnerable at all.”\n\nOne policy area in which there is general agreement that Bulgaria is doing well concerns progress towards its European Union membership.\n\nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha has dubbed 2004 the most important year since democracy was introduced, and he is confident it will lead to Bulgaria concluding talks on joining the Union.\n\nBulgaria has made considerably more progress in aligning its legislation to the EU’s than neighbouring Romania, with pundits attributing much of that success to Europe Minister Meglena Kuneva.\n\nHowever, the government has faced strong domestic criticism for bowing to EU demands that Soviet-era nuclear reactors in Kozloduy should be shut down in 2006. In 2002, the premiersurvived a ‘no confidence’ vote, called for by the opposition, over the administration’s handling of the energy chapter in its EU accession talks.\n\nBulgaria has also been invited to join NATO in May this year, while the country’s international profile was enhanced by securing a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002-03.\n\nBut it was also one of the central and eastern European states excoriated by French President Jacques Chirac last year for siding with the US during the build-up to the war in Iraq.\n\nThe premier’s support for the US stance can perhaps partly be explained by his own military training in America during the late 1950s, when he graduated as second lieutenant at the Valley Forge Military Academy, near Philadelphia.\n\nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha was exiled for several decades outside Bulgaria. However, he was cosseted during that time in a way that most refugees could only dream of.\n\nHis family first went to Egypt, where Joanna’s father, the ousted Italian King Victor Emmanuel, was living.\n\nThere, Simeon was enrolled in the exclusive Victoria College in Alexandria.\n\nSpain then granted his family asylum in 1951. This enabled him to study law and political science at Madrid’s Lycée Français. It afforded him too an opportunity to become a polyglot – he now commands fluent French, Spanish, German and Italian, along with a smattering of Portuguese and Arabic.\n\nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha, whose name originates from a duchy in Germany, in the present regions of Bavaria and Thuringia, married Spanish aristocrat Margarita Gomez-Acebo y Cejuela in 1962. They have four sons and a daughter. (The family name has also long been associated with the monarchies in Britain, Belgium and Portugal, since the marriage of Prince Albert Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to the UK’s Queen Victoria in 1840.)\n\nWhen Simeon II returned to Bulgaria in 1996, he was met by adoring ‘subjects’ chanting: “We want the King!”\n\nThe goodwill obviously lasted until 2001, when the NMSII secured almost 44% of the vote.\n\nYet the national movement named after him is paying a high price for making unrealistic promises. In local elections last year its support plummeted to just 6%.\n\nIt is highly probable, then, that it will not be the dominant political force following the next election – due in 2005, should the government not collapse before then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA crushing defeat could well prove to be an ignominious end to Simeon’s political career.\n\nStill, even if he loses some of his property due to court battles, he should be able to spend his remaining years in the lap of luxury."
