Thanksgiving service was held in St. Alexander Nevski Cathedral in Sofia. Later in Vrana Palace, Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha will welcome guests from all corners of Europe, members of Royal families, Bulgarian statesmen and politicians.\n\nThe church service was attended by nearly all members of his family, including his wife Margarita, his sister Maria-Luisa, and members of the royal families of Spain, Romania, Serbia, Albania, were present.\n\nThe thankgiving service was led by His Holiness Patriarch Neophyte in a ministry of Metropolitans of the Holy Synod.

Most of the royal property was later returned to him.\n\nAfter his return, he joined the political life in the country. In 2001 Simeon announced ther formation of a national movement, carrying his name that would work for new ethics in politics. His Simeon II National Movement was registered as a party and he took part in the parliamentary elections on 7th of June, 2001. After a smashing victory, he became the new Prime Minister of Bulgaria.\n\nSimeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was Prime Minister of Bulgaria from 2001 to 2005.\n\nUpon taking office, Simeon took as his surname Saxecoburggotski, the Bulgarian form of the name of his royal house, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha."
