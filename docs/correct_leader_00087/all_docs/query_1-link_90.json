We find that the transfer of knowledge, skills and competetences of magistrates, clerks and other justice professionals needs to be done by trainers from the judicial system – judges, prosecutors and other practitioners. Sharing professional experiences is key in the pocess of craftmanship. More than 200 trainers – magistrates and court clerks are seconded on temporary basis in the NIJ training teams. In addition, over 100 lecturers – experts outside the judiciary partake as trainers in seminars where such expertise is needed for developing specific skills.\n\nThe elaboration of self-learning tools – handbooks, manuals and reference guides, easily accessible and available in digital for all justice professionals, is crucial for the development of innovative and supportive learning environment. The self – learners are our new trainees, who upgrade knowledge, skills and competences using the NIJ e-tools.\n\nTailoring training according to procedural roles (judges, prosecutors, magistrate investigators), level of competence (supreme, appellate, district and regional level), and the trainees’ professional experience is a targetted approach that we have been trying out when designing our training programs.\n\nLanguage proficiency in English or French of magistrates, clerks and other justice professionals is essential for strengthening mutual trust and judicial cooperation across Europe. A comprehensive language training scheme in English and French has been recently launched, which will serve as a basis for elaboration of follow-up linguistic legal trainings."
