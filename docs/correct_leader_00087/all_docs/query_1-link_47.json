Joe Wilson, R-SC, today on the House Floor asked NATO to expand to include the Republic of Bulgaria.\"I rise today to express my support for the expansion of NATO to include the Republic of Bulgaria and to welcome Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to America,\" said Rep. Wilson.\"A recent article appearing in The Washington Times notes that U.S. Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns was impressed by Bulgaria's reforms during a February visit to Sofia. Also, a recent Washington Post editorial noted Bulgaria has already assisted America in Afghanistan and can make substantial contributions for Europe as a member of NATO.\"I commend the efforts of patriots like Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Ambassador Elena Poptodorova, Foreign Minister Solomon Pasi, Defense Minister Nikolai Svinarov, Deputy Chief of Mission Emil Yalnazov, and Ambassador Stefan Stoyanov for continuing important reforms.\"I was an observer of Bulgaria's first democratic elections in 1990, and I have witnessed the progress of Bulgaria's democracy. Bulgaria is strategically located, and would enhance NATO for the mutual defense of Southeastern Europe,\" said Rep. Wilson.###"
