They also demanded 14 persons from the villages of Gradec, Dobridol and Toplica to be re-deployed in the reserve composition of Gostivar police department.\n\nThe police patrols did not enter in the villages of Ribnica, Bistrovo, Grekaj and Tanuse, due to the blockades by the group of residents from these villages that demanded reconstruction of their houses, which according to their statements, were demolished during the last year crises.\n\nSome persons from Albanian nationality blocked the traffic in the settlement of Drenovec 2, near the gas station on Ivo Lola Ribar Street.

The road was unblocked not long ago.\n\nAccording to the Department of Interior, these Albanians set blockades also on the main traffic line near Tetovo Teke.

Kidnapped by local Albanians on Saturday, Simonovski was in critical condition after being tortured and physically abused. He was discovered by an OSCE patrol, according to the Macedonian government. At time of going to press, the OSCE office in Skopje had no further information on the case.\n\nShemshevo, ethnically mixed until last summer, was one of the many villages afflicted by NLA kidnappings. During the war, NLA-sponsored terrorism forced the Macedonian inhabitants of Shemshevo to flee their homes. They have yet to return.\n\nViolence against Macedonians continues. A MakPetrol gas station in Tetovo was robbed on Monday, and vehicles have been stoned while trying to leave the city. A toll booth on the Tetovo-Gostivar road was also robbed and destroyed on Monday morning. According to government sources, armed and uniformed Albanians recently harassed Macedonian drivers at an impromptu \"checkpoint\" set up near the Tetovo village of Poroj. Such incidents show that the ongoing redeployment of police in the crisis region is doing little to stop ethnically-motivated intimidation of Macedonians.\n\nMeanwhile, street warfare between rival Albanian factions continued in Tetovo and surrounding villages through the night, the Macedonian Information Agency reported. Heavy weapons fire was reported at six points in downtown Tetovo, including the new Southeast-Europe University (SEE) a project financed by the EU. Violence extended into early Tuesday morning in the nearby villages of Tearce and Poroj. What is being described as a \"turf war\" has caused millions of dollars in property damage, and called into question the credibility of Albanian \"freedom fighters,\" who have claimed that their war is for increased rights. The current violence in Tetovo belies that assertion.\n\nFor weeks, warfare between dueling factions of the Albanian militant organization, NLA and ANA, has engulfed this ethnically-mixed city in western Macedonia. While the exact reasons are unclear, informed sources claim the fighting revolves around war profits that have \"disappeared\" among Albanians in Kosovo and in the European diaspora. The infighting has also taken on political overtones. The headquarters of the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) was recently attacked, and a restaurant and café owned by Menduh Thaci the DPA's powerful vice-president was bombed. High leaders of the DPA and their colleagues including Thaci and NLA chief Ali Ahmeti were said to have been the targets of the attack. Their security staff went on high alert, with Thaci's bodyguards gunning down a vehicle passing the restaurant only days later.\n\nThe past week has seen sporadic fighting in Tetovo and five nearby villages.\n\nSunday's shootout in Shipkovica, which caused the hospitalization of a 29 year-old man, shows that the ANA is taking the war to the enemy. Shipkovica is a stronghold of Ahmeti and the NLA. The more radical ANA has accused Ahmeti of \"selling out the Albanian people,\" a reference to the compromise negotiations made last summer with the Framework Agreement at Ochrid. The generous concessions made at that time were widely regarded as a big victory for the NLA. The recent Albanian infighting shows that the NLA may have enjoyed too much of a good thing.\n\nPM GEORGIEVSKI'S ADDRESS AT CONFERENCE IN ATHENS.\n\nMIA\n\nThe last year conflict in Macedonia, caused by the Albanian extremism from Kosovo, has stopped the country's development bringing it into a deep political, security and economic crisis, which could have been spilled over in the entire region, Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said Thursday in his address at the conference on \"Strategy for International Renewal and Regional Cooperation\", organized by the magazine \"Economist\" in Atnes.\n\nIn his speech on the topic \"Regional Partnership-Contribution to Global Progress\", Georgievski said that the world was becoming smaller and people closer due to the global processes in all spheres.\n\nReferring to the Macedonian-Greek relations, Georgievski said that Athens always demonstrated a sense of reality.\n\n\"Despite the crisis, Greek businessmen have not stop to invest in Macedonia, giving specific and constructive contribution to its surpassing,\" Georgievski said, underlying that Greece is still the main Macedonia's partner in regard to investments.\n\nUsing the constitutional name of Macedonia, Georgievski said that the name dispute was the only unresolved matter in the actually outstanding relations between Skopje and Athens.\n\nToday, Georgievski had meetings with his Albanian counterpart Pandeli Majko and a leader of the Greek opposition party Nea Democratia (New Democracy) Konstantin Karamanlis. The meetings were focused on current developments in Macedonia and the region.\n\nUS SPECIAL ADVISOR ON SOUTH EAST EUROPE HOLMES TO VISIT MACEDONIA.\n\nMIA\n\nUS State Department's Special Advisor on South East Europe, Ambassador James Holmes who is in a three-day visit to Macedonia Thursday met with Macedonian Parliament's speaker Stojan Andov, Macedonian Justice Minister Ixhet Memeti and Foreign Minister Slobodan Casule.\n\nAccording to the Parliament's Media Center, Andov and Holmes exchanged their positions on the situation in Macedonia.\n\nAndov emphasized that by the end of April, the Macedonian Parliament will pass all legal projects arising from the adopted constitutional amendments.\n\nHe emphasized that the dynamic of the Parliament's work depends mostly from the competent ministries that should submit the proposals as well as from the four political parties signatories of Framework agreement.\n\nDuring their meeting Macedonian Justice Minister Ixhet Memeti and Ambassador Holmes exchanged their views on promoting the process for implementation of Ohrid framework agreement.

These efforts were given full support by the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and were not contravened by the monarch, despite continuous pressure from Nazi Germany.\n\nRecently, two Bulgarian church leaders were honoured posthumously as Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. They were the late Metropolitan of Sofia, Stefan, and the late Metropolitan of Plovdiv, Kiril. Both men sent direct pleas to the Bulgarian King begging for mercy towards the Jews. Owing to their efforts the deportation of the Jewish population was postponed time and time again, until it was finally cancelled.\n\nFollowing the demands of members of Bulgarias Jewish community, it was announced this year in Sofia that March 9 is to be declared an annual day of commemoration for Holocaust victims and the rescue of the Bulgarian Jews.\n\nEaster Egg to Cost 0.16 Levs.\n\nStandartnews\n\nYuliana Uzanicheva\n\nDeficit on the market is not expected, sources from the Poultry-Farmers' Union maintain.\n\nThe prices of eggs and poultry meat won't up for the Easter, Prof. Boris Stoimenov - chairman of the Poultry-Farmers' Union in Bulgaria (PFUB), released yesterday.

Italy backs your aspiration. We see many opportunities for the cooperation of NATO and especially of Italy with Bulgaria because the two countries belong to the NATO southern wing.\n\n- Italy is among the biggest economic partners of Bulgaria. Which of the joint projects are to start in a short time?\n\n- In 1999 Italy ranked 16 among the investors in Bulgaria and now she, most probably, is topping the list. During his visit Berlusconi will meet some 120 Italian businessmen at Interpred which now is owned by Miroglio - an Italian firm. This is indicative of the fact the Berlusconi's visit is closely related to the accelerated process of Italian investments in Bulgaria, amounting to $500 or $600 million. To now, Germany ranked first in terms of investments but in all probability Italy is getting ahead. There are three major investments projects: the Gorna Arda cascade, the construction of Plovdiv-Kapitan Andreevo highway as well as the gas power station nearby Varna.\n\n(Abr)"
