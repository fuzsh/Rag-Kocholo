        "text": "President Bush will welcome Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Washington on April 23, 2002. Bulgaria is a good partner and friend of the United States which has actively supported the war on terrorism and made significant contributions to our common effort of maintaining peace and stability in Southeast Europe. The visit provides an opportunity for the President and Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to discuss Euroatlantic and regional issues of common concern."
