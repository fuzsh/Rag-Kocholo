He studied at the Pedagogical School in Vienna from 1876 to 1882. He then studied philosophy and literature at Jena in 1884 and spent two years in Geneva. In 1888, he finished his Ph.D. studies in Leipzig under the direction of Professor Wilhelm Wundt.\n\nIn 1894 Shishmanov became Professor of General Literary and Cultural History and comparative literary history. He was also the founder and editor of the Folklore and Ethnography Collection (СбНУНК) from 1889 to 1902 and the Bulgarian Observer magazine from 1893-1900. Shishmanov was a member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. He was also one of the founders of the State Drawing School, which later became the National Academy of Arts (1896).\n\nShishmanov was a member of the People’s Liberal Party, and in 1903 he became Minister of Public Education, but in early 1907 he left office because of disagreement with the government’s actions during the University crisis. As a minister of education, he opened the school for the blind in 1906.\n\nShishmanov acted as a plenipotentiary representative of Bulgaria in the Ukrainian People’s Republic during the reign of Pavlo Skoropadsky in 1918-1919. King Ferdinand I sent him to Kyiv. He founded and served as the first president of the Bulgarian Department of the Pan-European Union.\n\nHe was married to Lidia Shishmanova. His son, Dimitr Shishmanov, writer and politician, was executed by the People’s Court due to his work as the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then the Minister of Foreign Affair.\n\nProf. Ivan Shishmanov died in Oslo on June 23, 1928, at the age of 65.\n\nFourth “Prof. Ivan Shishmanov” Award Holder is\n\nLech Wałęsa\n\nThe fourth award “Prof. Ivan Shishmanov” was presented to Lech Walesa for his contribution to democracy in Eastern Europe. The legendary leader of Solidarity celebrated his 80th anniversary in September 2023 and the guests of honour, Gergana and Solomon Passy, presented him with the European Contribution Award “Prof. Ivan Shishmanov\n\nLech Walesa was born on 29 September 1943 in Popowo, Poland. He is an icon of the resistance against the communist regime in Poland and one of the founders of the independent trade union Solidarity, which played a key role in changing the political landscape in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1980, after a series of strikes and protests, Walesa became the leader of Solidarity and a leading figure in the movement for democratic reform in Poland.\n\nHis decisive stance and inspiring leadership led to Poland’s first free elections in 1989, which marked the beginning of the end of communist rule in the country.\n\nIn 1990, Walesa became Poland’s first democratically elected president since World War II. As president, he continued his efforts to integrate Poland into European institutions and strengthen the country’s democratic structures.\n\nWałęsa has also been an active advocate of the expansion of the European Union and NATO to their eastern neighbours, believing in the strength of European integration and the importance of preserving peace and stability on the continent.\n\nIn recognition of his efforts for peace and freedom, Lech Walesa received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. He continues to be an active participant in global and European political discussions, upholding his values of democracy, freedom and human rights.\n\nThird “Prof. Ivan Shishmanov” Award Holder is\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nThe third prize was awarded in 2022 to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his actions during the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nVolodymyr Oleksandrovich Zelensky was born on 25 January 1978 in Kriviy Rih, then in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Zelensky’s inauguration on May 20, 2019, was attended by various foreign dignitaries, including leaders from Georgia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, the European Union and the United States. During his inauguration speech, Zelensky dissolved the Ukrainian parliament and called for early parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for October of that year. The move led to the withdrawal of one of his coalition partners, the Popular Front.\n\nIn April 2021, in response to the Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders, Zelensky spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden and urged NATO members to expedite Ukraine’s membership application. Since then, Zelensky has engaged in numerous cooperative talks to rally support from NATO and EU countries.\n\nPanEuropa Bulgaria was able to personally present the award to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his official visit to Bulgaria on 6 July 2023, at the National History Museum during his meeting with politicians, public figures and journalists.\n\nSecond “Prof. Ivan Shishmanov” Award Holder\n\nPetar Stoyanov\n\nThe second prize was awarded to Petar Stoyanov, in 2019, for his contributions to the resolution of the Kosovo crisis.
