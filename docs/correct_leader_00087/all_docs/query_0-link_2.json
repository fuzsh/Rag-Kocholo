        "text": "Simeon Saxecoburggotski (born June 16, 1937, Sofia, Bulg.) is the last king of Bulgaria, reigning as a child from 1943 to 1946 as Simeon II. He later served as the country’s prime minister (2001–05).\n\nOn Aug. 28, 1943, his father, Boris III, died under mysterious circumstances—the cause of death being reported variously as heart attack or poisoning—and the six-year-old crown prince ascended the throne, overseen by a three-man regency comprising Boris’s brother Prince Cyril, former war minister Lieutenant General Nikolai Michov, and former premier Bogdan Filov. After Bulgaria quit the Axis Powers and was overrun by the Soviet Red Army, the regents were arrested, and on Feb. 2, 1945, all three were executed as enemies of the state and as collaborators with the Germans. A second regency was established, but on Sept. 8, 1946, the monarchy was voted out of existence, and Simeon and his mother, Queen Ioanna, went into exile. Simeon eventually settled in Madrid, marrying a Spanish heiress.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nIn 1996 Simeon visited Bulgaria and most of the royal property was later returned to him. In April 2001 he announced the formation of the National Movement for Simeon II, an organization that set out to field candidates in the national legislative elections scheduled in June. When the courts ruled that the party had not met all of the requirements for registration, it joined two minor parties’ coalition and was thereby allowed to participate in the election. The party won 120 of the 240 seats and formed a coalition with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which represented the country’s Turkish minority. On July 24, 2001, Simeon became the country’s prime minister."
