        "text": "[Congressional Record Volume 151, Number 14 (Thursday, February 10, 2005)] [House] [Page H526] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] THE BULGARIAN MIRACLE (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation of the strong partnership between the United States and Bulgaria. For over 100 years the United States has enjoyed diplomatic relations with Bulgaria. With its new era of democracy, our two countries now stand together in the war on terrorism and our friendship is stronger than ever. Bulgaria is a new democracy which recognizes the importance of furthering freedom throughout the world. By sending over 400 troops to rebuild Iraq and train security forces, the country is playing an important role in helping the Iraqi people. Also, with a contingent in Afghanistan, Bulgaria is protecting the modern world by containing terrorists at the source. Bulgaria is also a country of great accomplishment. Last year I was honored to meet Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha and to attend the White House ceremony honoring Bulgaria's admission into NATO. Under his leadership, the Bulgarian economy is being transformed and EU admission is planned in 2 years. During my visits to Bulgaria, I have seen firsthand the Bulgarian miracle, the establishment of a dynamic democracy and the restoration of economic freedom. As the co-chair of the Congressional Bulgaria Caucus with the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Tauscher), it is also my privilege to work with Ambassador Elena Poptodorova. In conclusion, may God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11. ____________________"
