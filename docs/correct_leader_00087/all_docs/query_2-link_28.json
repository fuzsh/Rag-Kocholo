        "text": "Royal history\n\nSimeon was born to Boris III and Giovanna of Italy. Following his birth, Boris III sent an air force officer to the River Jordan to obtain water for Simeon's baptism in the Orthodox faith. He became tsar on 28 August 1943 on the death of his father, who had just returned to Bulgaria from a meeting with Adolf Hitler. Since Tsar Simeon was only six years old when he ascended the throne, his uncle Prince Kyril, Prime Minister Bogdan Filov, and Lt. General Nikola Mikhov of the Bulgarian Army were appointed regents.\n\nUnder his father, Bulgaria had reluctantly joined the Axis powers in World War II but had managed to preserve diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Still, on 5 September 1944 Stalin declared war on Bulgaria and three days later the Red Army entered the country without encountering resistance. On the next day, 9 September 1944, Prince Kyril and the other regents were deposed by a Soviet-backed coup and arrested. The three regents, all members of the last three governments, Parliament deputies, heads of the army and eminent journalists were executed by the Communists in February 1945.\n\nTowards exile\n\nThe royal family (Queen Giovanna, Simeon II, and his sister Maria-Louisa) remained at Vrana Palace near Sofia, while three new regents were appointed (Todor Pavlov, Venelin Ganev and Tsvetko Boboshevski). On 15 September 1946, a referendum was held in the presence of the Soviet army. It resulted in a 97% approval for republic and abolition of the monarchy, and the boy Tsar Simeon was forced to abdicate. For the first time since the first Caesar took power in 27 B.C., there was no longer anywhere in Europe a ruler calling himself Caesar/Czar/Tsar and claiming to derive his authority from Rome.\n\nOn 16 September 1946, the royal family was exiled from Bulgaria. Simeon II has never signed any abdication papers—neither at that moment when he was nine years old and his legal capacity to sign such an instrument would be questionable in any event, nor at any time later. The royal family first went to Alexandria, Egypt, where Queen Giovanna's father Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy, lived in exile. There, Simeon II finished Victoria College (along with Crown Prince Leka of Albania). In July 1951, General Franco's dictatorship in Spain granted asylum to the family.\n\nEducation and business career\n\nIn Madrid, Simeon studied at the Lycée Français, but did not graduate. On 16 June 1955, upon turning 18, in accordance with the Tarnovo Constitution Simeon II read his proclamation to the Bulgarian people as the Tsar of Bulgaria, confirming his will to be king of all Bulgarians and follow the principles of the Tarnovo Constitution and free Bulgaria. In 1958, he enrolled at Valley Forge Military Academy and College in the United States, where he was known as \"Cadet Rylski No. 6883\", and graduated as a second lieutenant. Once again in Spain (between 1959 and 1962), Simeon studied law and business administration.\n\nHe became a businessman. For thirteen years, he was chairman of the Spanish subsidiary of Thomson, a French defence and electronics group. He was also an adviser in the banking, hotel, electronics, and catering sectors.\n\nMonarch in exile\n\nSimeon issued several political declarations during his exile through his \"chancellery\" in Madrid directed at the Communist regime in Bulgaria and his exiled compatriots. His early attempts at forming an official government in exile did not come to fruition, however.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\nOn 21 January 1962, Simeon married a Spanish aristocrat, Doña Margarita Gómez-Acebo y Cejuela. The couple have had five children – four sons (Kardam, Kiril, Kubrat and Konstantin) and a daughter, Kalina, all of whom subsequently married Spaniards. All of his sons received names of Bulgarian kings, his daughter has a Bulgarian name, although only two of his eleven grandchildren have Bulgarian names (Boris and Sofia).\n\nKardam (1962 - 7 April 2015) married Miriam de Ungría y López. They had two sons, Boris and Beltran.\n\nKiril (born 1964) married María del Rosario Nadal y Fuster-Puigdórfila. They have two daughters, Mafalda and Olimpia, and one son, Tassilo.\n\nKubrat (born 1965) married Carla María de la Soledad Royo-Villanova y Urrestarazu. They have three sons: Mirko, Lukás and Tirso.\n\nKonstantin-Assen (born 1967) married María García de la Rasilla y Gortázar. They have twins, Umberto and Sofia.\n\nKalina (born 1972) married Antonio José \"Kitín\" Muñoz y Valcárcel. They have one son, Simeon Hassan Muñoz.\n\nPolitical return\n\nIn 1990, just months after the fall of communism, Simeon was issued a new Bulgarian passport. In 1996, fifty years after the abolition of the monarchy, Simeon returned to Bulgaria and was met in many places by crowds cheering: \"We want our King!\" He did not, at that point, make any political announcements or moves. However, these monarchist sentiments gradually disappeared after his premiership and specifically during his coalition as a leader of NMSP with the ex-Communist Party, together with changing of generations; since today the majority of voters were born after the fall of the monarchy.\n\nVarious estates in Bulgaria that had been nationalised during the Communist era were returned to Simeon and his family. In 2001, Simeon, who had by this time taken the name Simeon Borisov Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, announced he would return to Bulgaria to form a new political party, the National Movement Simeon II (NMSII) (later renamed to NMSP), dedicated to \"reforms and political integrity.\" Simeon promised that in 800 days the Bulgarian people would feel tangible positive effects of his government and would enjoy significantly higher standards of living.\n\nPrime Minister\n\nFor details on his cabinet, see: Sakskoburggotski Government\n\nNMSP won a large victory in the parliamentary elections held on 17 June 2001, capturing 120 of the 240 seats in Parliament and defeating the two main pre-existing political parties. Simeon gave an oath as Prime Minister of Bulgaria on 24 July, forming a coalition with the ethnic Turkish party, Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF). He gave ministerial positions in his government mainly to technocrats and Western-educated economic specialists. In 2002, his efforts were recognized by his receiving the 2002 Path to Peace Award from the Path to Peace Foundation. During his time in power, Bulgaria joined the EU and NATO.\n\nIn the 2005 elections, Simeon's party ranked second and participated in the grand coalition government led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party and including the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. Simeon II was given the unofficial ceremonial post of Chairman of the Coalition Council.\n\nThe party got just 3.01% of votes and no seats at the parliamentary elections of 2009. Shortly after, on 6 July, Simeon also resigned as NMSP leader.\n\nViews on restoration of the Bulgarian monarchy\n\nSimeon II has never formally renounced his claim to the Bulgarian throne. He used the title \"Tsar of the Bulgarians\" in his political statements during his exile. Since his return to Bulgaria, however, Simeon has consistently declined to reveal his views on the restoration of the Bulgarian monarchy, notwithstanding the name of his party. Upon taking office as prime minister, he took an oath to protect the country's republican constitution.\n\nAutobiography\n\nSimeon II wrote an autobiography in French under the title Simeon II de Bulgarie, un destin singulier that was released in Bulgaria on 28 October 2014. It was first presented at the headquarters of the UNESCO in Paris on 22 October 2014.\n\nHeir to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry\n\nAfter the death of his distant cousin Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in April 2010 and due to the exclusion of the late prince's uncle Philipp Josias Maria Joseph Ignatius Michael Gabriel Raphael Gonzaga (Walterskirchen, 18 August 1901 – 31 December 1994) children and descendants from his morganatic marriage with Sarah Aurelia Halasz, Simeon became the Head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry, former Magnates of Hungary, and heir to the castles of Čabraď and Sv. Anton, both in modern-day Slovakia. In early 2012, he nominally ceded his rights (and those of his children) to the headship of the princely house of Koháry to his sister Princess Marie Louise of Bulgaria. In a statement published on its website on 1 May 2015, the Bulgarian Patriarchy announced that Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will be referred to as king of Bulgaria in all public and private services held in the dioceses of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\nLongevity\n\nSakskoburggotski turned 80 years old on June 16, 2017. If he lives to December 31, 2024, he will become the longest-lived head of state in Bulgarian history at 87 years, 198 days, surpassing Ferdinand I who holds the current record at 87 years, and 197 days when he died on September 10, 1948.\n\nTitles, styles, honours and awards\n\n16 June 1937 – 28 August 1943: His Royal Highness Prince Simeon of Bulgaria, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Saxony\n\n28 August 1943 – 15 September 1946: His Majesty The King of the Bulgarians\n\n15 September 1946 – 24 July 2001: Mr Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\n24 July 2001 – 17 August 2005: His Excellency Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\n17 August 2005 – present: Mr Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\n15 September 1946 — present (in pretense): His Majesty The King of the Bulgarians\n\nNational dynastic honours\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross with Chain of the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Order of Saint Alexander\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross with Chain of the Royal Order of Bravery\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Civil Merit\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Military Merit\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight of the National Order of Labour\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight of the Order of 9 September 1944\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign Knight of the Order of People's Freedom\n\nHouse of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry: Sovereign recipient of the Coming of age Medal of King Simeon II\n\nNational state honours\n\nBulgaria: Grand Cross of the Order of Stara Planina\n\nBulgarian Ministry of Defence: Collar of the Order of Justice\n\nForeign honours\n\nAlbanian Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Fidelity, Special Class\n\nBelgium: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold II\n\nFrance\n\nOrléans-French Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Saint Lazarus\n\nFrance: Grand Officer of the Order of the Legion of Honour\n\nGreek Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Redeemer\n\nItalian Royal Family: Knight Grand Collar of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation\n\nVatican: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre\n\nSovereign Military Order of Malta: Bailiff Knight Grand Cross of Justice of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, 1st Class\n\nCalabrian Royal Family of Two Sicilies: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Januarius\n\nCalabrian Royal Family of Two Sicilies: Knight Grand Cross of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George\n\nParmese Ducal Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of the Parmese Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George\n\nJordan: Knight Grand Cordon of the Order of Independence\n\nRussian Imperial Family: Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Imperial Order of St. Andrew\n\nSpain: 1, 192nd Knight with Collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece\n\nSpain: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III\n\nSweden: Recipient of the 70th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nNational awards\n\nBulgaria: Honorary degree of the National Guards Unit of Bulgaria\n\nBulgaria: Jubilee badge of honour of the Bulgarian Chitalishte community\n\nForeign awards\n\nEuropean Union: Paneuropean Union integration award\n\nRomania: Honorary degree of the University of Bucharest\n\nNational patronages\n\nBulgaria: Patron of the National day of Bulgaria\n\nForeign patronages\n\nSlovakia: Patron of restoration of the Statue of St. John of Nepomuk in Divina, realised out under auspices of the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Slovakia (2017)."
