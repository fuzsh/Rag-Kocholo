        "text": "The president, directly elected for up to two five-year terms, is the head of state; the prime minister, who serves as head of government, is chosen by the legislature. Though presidential powers are generally limited, in the event that parliament cannot form a government, the president has the power to dissolve the National Assembly, schedule new elections, and appoint an interim government.\n\nIn November 2021, incumbent president Rumen Radev was reelected to the presidency for a second term after winning 65.8 percent of the vote in the second round of the presidential elections. Radev, an independent candidate, was supported by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the We Continue the Change party (PP), and the antielite There is Such a People party (ITN). The election was assessed by international observers to be generally competitive and free, though some irregularities, including problems with voting machines, were noted.\n\nIn December, the newly elected parliament confirmed Kiril Petkov, a member of the PP, as prime minister.\n\nThe unicameral National Assembly, with 240 members, is elected every four years in 31 multimember constituencies.\n\nParliamentary elections were held as scheduled in April 2021. Though incumbent prime minister Boyko Borisov’s ruling party, the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), won the highest percentage of the vote, the party lost its majority, and was unable to form a coalition government. Following the April elections, Radev appointed a provisional government and called for new parliamentary elections to be held in July. A second interim government was put in place after the July parliamentary elections also failed to result in the formation of a government.\n\nA third round of parliamentary elections, held in November, was won by the PP, a newly launched centrist party. The PP, which received 25.5 percent of the vote, was able to form a coalition government with the BSP, the ITN, and the Democratic Bulgaria alliance (DB). After forming, the coalition—which occupies 134 seats in the National Assembly—announced that it will govern based on a shared anticorruption platform.\n\nAll three parliamentary elections held in 2021 were deemed to be generally competitive and free by international election observation missions. However, alleged instances of voter intimidation and vote-buying by various groups, including by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) party, were reported; such irregularities are persistent in economically and socially vulnerable communities. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) election observation mission also reported the “massive” misuse of government resources by the incumbent GERB during the April elections.\n\nThe Central Election Commission (CEC) administers Bulgaria’s elections and generally works professionally and impartially, though some flaws have been reported in past elections.\n\nControversial changes to the electoral code were introduced in September 2020, just months ahead of scheduled 2021 elections. The changes mandated a “mixed” mode of voting, using both paper ballots and voting machines; OSCE observers reported that the use of paper balloting led to a high percentage of invalid ballots in the April 2021 elections.\n\nSubstantial changes to the electoral framework were introduced between the April and July 2021 parliamentary elections, removing restrictions on voting abroad, reducing the CEC from 20 members to 15, and requiring the implementation of electronic voting as the only voting method. Though the short timeframe between the electoral code amendments and election day negatively impacted electoral administration, the electoral code reforms were generally accepted by both voters and political parties. In both the July and November elections, electronic voting reduced the incidence of invalid ballots; no evidence was found to support allegations of voting machine fraud made by GERB.\n\nIn November, contrary to provisions made in the May electoral reforms, the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) ruled that the CEC would not be permitted to use mandatory manual vote counts to certify the election results.\n\nWhile marginalized groups generally have full political rights, the law dictates that electoral campaigns must be conducted in the Bulgarian language, which hinders outreach to non-Bulgarian-speaking minority groups. The ethnic Turkish minority is represented by the DPS, but the Roma are more marginalized. Small Romany parties are active, and many Roma reportedly vote for the DPS, though none hold seats in the parliament. Courts have continued to deny registration to the political party OMO Ilinden, which seeks legal recognition of a Macedonian ethnic minority in Bulgaria; this issue was featured in a critical European Parliament resolution on the rule of law and fundamental rights in Bulgaria, adopted in October 2020.\n\nMembers of far-right nationalist parties have engaged in hate speech against Roma, ethnic Turks, Jews, Muslims, migrants, and refugees, among other groups, particularly during election periods.\n\nWomen are underrepresented in parliament, and the inclusion of women’s issues in politics is generally lacking.\n\nSo-called oligarchs exert influence on the vote in smaller municipalities and within marginalized groups in particular, an issue referred to as the “controlled vote.” Instances of controlled voting decreased following the May 2021 adoption of electoral reforms requiring electronic voting.\n\nElected executive and legislative officials in general are able to set and implement policies without undue interference from external or unelected entities. However, “oligarch” politicians in the last several years have had increasing influence on policy making.\n\nThe informal influence on government of the nominally opposition party DPS and its honorary chair Ahmed Dogan, and the widespread perception that aspects of the state have been “captured” by dubious business figures, were among the triggers of the mass antigovernment protests in 2020.\n\nThe businessman and DPS lawmaker Delyan Peevski is also suspected of having had influence over policymaking, and of having played a role in securing the appointment of Ivan Geshev as the country’s controversial prosecutor general. In July, as protests continued, Borisov replaced several of his cabinet ministers and GERB released a statement saying the dismissals were necessary to “eliminate insinuations that GERB and the three are directly controlled by the DPS and Peevski.”\n\nBulgaria, which joined the European Union (EU) in 2007, has struggled to meet the bloc’s anticorruption requirements amid resistance from much of the political class. Anticorruption laws are not adequately enforced, including in high-profile cases, contributing to a culture of impunity. The country remains subject to long-term monitoring by the EU’s Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), whose annual reports have called for new legislative efforts to combat corruption.\n\nIn 2020, mass antigovernment protests were launched in response to a series of corruption scandals involving both the prosecutorial office and a number of politicians. The resignations of Geshev and Borisov, both of whom are widely associated with corrupt practices within the government, were key demand of the protesters. Though Borisov left parliament following the April 2021 elections, Geshev remained in office at year’s end.\n\nThe judiciary has been inefficient in tackling high-profile corruption cases; a 2021 report released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) criticized the prosecutor’s office for its persistent failure to investigate and prosecute cases of corruption.\n\nThe coalition government that formed following the November 2021 elections is made up of four “protest parties” that share an anticorruption platform centered on judicial reform.\n\nAcademic freedom is generally upheld in practice.\n\nIn April 2021 a professor was fired for criticizing a preelection university visit by the prime minister Borisov as politically motivated on social media; he was reinstated following public outcry.\n\nDue to a pervasive lack of access to both the internet and digital devices, Roma students have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19-related online learning requirements. In 2020, the government offered to provide free internet access to Roma communities and local NGOs donated a number of electronic devices to students in need. The education ministry provided 20,000 computers and tablets to students at state and municipal schools in August 2021.\n\nFreedom of expression is guaranteed by the constitution. However, Bulgaria’s criminal code allows for legal secret surveillance of citizens in a wide range of cases; in recent years, there has been increasing concern that authorities have misused such surveillance laws in order to monitor citizens who criticize the government.\n\nIn July 2021, then interim interior minister, Boyko Rashkov, testified that the prosecutor’s office had conducted illegal mass wiretapping of antigovernment protesters in 2020. His testimony was corroborated in September by leaked police documents that showed that the government had secretly wiretapped around 1,000 people who had participated in the protests.\n\nBulgaria’s judiciary has benefited from legal and institutional reforms associated with EU membership and is generally considered independent, but is still prone to politicization. Despite significant legislation formally guaranteeing judicial independence, the members and governing bodies of the judiciary often act in accordance with the ruling majority.\n\nA Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), responsible for judicial and prosecutorial appointments and management, was installed under revised rules in 2017, with half the members (six judges, four prosecutors, and an investigator) elected by their peers and half by a two-thirds parliamentary majority. Bulgarian legal observers have reported that in practice, requiring a two-thirds majority vote in parliament to appoint SJC members has allowed political parties—including minority parties such as DPS—to exert undue influence over the selection and appointment of the country’s top magistrates.\n\nTensions have increased in recent years between the prosecutor general’s office and some of the courts, with high-ranking prosecutors verbally attacking the Supreme Court of Cassation (SCC), its court decisions, and its chair. The SJC, taking the side of the prosecutors, has launched disciplinary procedures against judges critical of it, which are widely seen as politically motivated.\n\nConstitutional rights to due process are not always upheld. Police have been accused of misconduct, including arbitrary arrests and failure to inform suspects of their rights. Public trust in the justice system is low due to its reputed vulnerability to political and outside pressure.\n\nThe long seven-year mandate granted to the prosecutor general and the lack of effective accountability mechanisms have long been noted as major problems with the prosecutorial office, weakening due process and rule of law in the country. In July 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled that any prosecutor may launch an investigation on the activities of the prosecutor general; however, the prosecutor general’s strong position both with regard to career promotion, and within the SJC, does not de facto permit such investigations to take place. This leaves the most powerful figure within the judicial system without effective mechanisms of control over their actions.\n\nA series of scandals involving the prosecutorial office, including alleged raids of private businesses, actions suppressing voices critical of the government, as well as a raid of the offices of the Bulgarian president, were among the triggers of the 2020 antigovernment protests.\n\nEthnic minorities, particularly Roma, face discrimination in employment, health care, education, and housing, though the government and NGOs operate a number of programs meant to improve their social integration. Authorities periodically demolish illegally constructed or irregular housing—mostly in areas occupied by Roma—without providing alternative shelter.\n\nCOVID-19-related lockdown measures left many Roma unable to access basic services in 2020 and 2021; the Romany minority was also subject to disproportionately severe pandemic-related restrictions throughout 2020. Human rights watchdogs in the country and abroad raised serious concerns that COVID-19 had exacerbated racism against the Roma in Bulgaria.\n\nMigrants and asylum seekers have reportedly faced various forms of mistreatment by Bulgarian authorities, including beatings and extortion.\n\nDiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal, but societal bias against LGBT+ people persists. Throughout 2021, several LGBT+ events were disrupted, and in October, Rainbow Hub—a well-known LGBT+ organization in Sofia—and its employees were violently attacked by a mob allegedly led by a far-right political figure. Anti-LGBT+ violence is significantly underreported in Bulgaria, and largely goes unaddressed by authorities. However, following the October attack on Rainbow Hub, several politicians and the prosecutor’s office announced that they plan to propose legislation that will allow homophobic attacks to be prosecuted as hate crimes.\n\nA gender equality law passed in 2016 was designed to foster equal opportunity for women, but discrimination in employment persists: women are employed less often and paid less than men.\n\nThe legal and regulatory framework is generally supportive of property rights and private business, though property rights are not always respected in practice, and corruption continues to hamper business and investment. The gray economy of undeclared business activity has been estimated at over 20 percent of the country’s economy. Attempts at business raiding, including with the suspected assistance of state institutions and the prosecutorial office, are perceived to be on the rise and were among the triggers of the antigraft protests in 2020–21."
