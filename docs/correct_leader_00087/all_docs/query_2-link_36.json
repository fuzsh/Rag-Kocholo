        "text": "February 10, 2005\n\nRecognizes Strong Relationship between US and Bulgaria\n\nWashington - Today, Congressman Joe Wilson (R-SC) made the following remarks from the House Floor:\"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the strong relationship between the United States and Bulgaria,\" said Wilson. \"For over a hundred years, interrupted by tragic periods of totalitarianism, the United States has enjoyed diplomatic relations with Bulgaria. With its new era of democracy, our two countries now stand together in the War on Terrorism and our relationship is stronger than ever. Bulgaria is a thriving democracy which recognizes the importance of furthering freedom throughout the world. By sending over 400 troops to Iraq to rebuild the country and train security forces, Bulgaria is playing an important role in helping the Iraqi people. Also with a contingent in Afghanistan, Bulgaria is protecting the modern world by containing barbarians overseas. \"Bulgaria is also a country of great accomplishment. Last year, I was honored to meet Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha and to attend the White House ceremony honoring Bulgaria's admittance into NATO. Under his leadership, the Bulgarian economy is being transformed and EU Admission is planned in two years. \"With my visits to Bulgaria, I have seen firsthand the Bulgarian miracle: the establishment of a dynamic democracy and the restoration of economic freedom creating unlimited opportunities for the Bulgarian people. As the Co-Chair of the Congressional Bulgaria Caucus along with Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher of California, it is also my privilege to work with Ambassador Elena Poptodorova, who is the finest representative of Bulgarian hospitality and friendship in the United States. \"In conclusion, may God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.\""
