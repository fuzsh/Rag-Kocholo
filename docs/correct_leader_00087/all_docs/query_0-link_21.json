He had ruled just three years when his family were sent into exile.\n\nHalf a century later, his Simeon II National Movement party won an overwhelming victory in Bulgaria's general election, and he was sworn in as Prime Minister.\n\nBut have his promises for a better life for ordinary Bulgarians proved difficult to deliver?\n\nAs the country grooms itself for NATO and EU membership, the Government's approval rate is falling sharply.\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nHARDtalk is broadcast on BBC News 24, Monday to Friday at 10.30pm, and is repeated Tuesday to Saturday at 2.30am.\n\nBACK TO THE TOP\n\nPRINTABLE VERSION"
