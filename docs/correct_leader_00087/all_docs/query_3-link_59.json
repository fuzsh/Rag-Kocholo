        "text": "President Petar Stoyanov announced the date of parliamentary elections in March 2001. This was the first time since the end of the communist era in 1990 that Parliament and Government had completed their full four-year term.\n\nThe Central Election Committee (CEC) registered a total of 65 parties and 11 independent candidates for the 2001 parliamentary elections. One of the parties was the National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) of the former King of Bulgaria, Simeon II. He had been forced to create a coalition with the Bulgarian Women's Party and the Movement for National Revival after the Sofia City Court refused to register his movement because it did not meet all of the requirements. Fifteen out of the 65 registered parties withdrew before election day, while others did not submit candidate lists in a single constituency, reducing the number of contesting parties to 31.\n\nThe electoral campaign officially started on 17 May and ended on 15 June 2001, and was mostly calm. Nevertheless, it was characterised by negative campaigning as well as allegations of possible vote-rigging and election fraud.\n\nThe elections were carried out in an orderly manner. The International Elections Observation Mission (a joint team from the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Right and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe) affirmed that the poll was in line with international standards on democratic elections.\n\nThe NDSV obtained 120 of the 240 seats in Parliament, one short of an outright majority. The centre-right Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) won 51 seats, the Socialist Party 48 and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MDL) 21.\n\nOn 24 July 2001, the former King, Simeon of Saxe Coburg-Gotha was sworn in as Prime Minister. A week before, his party had struck a coalition deal with the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MDL), the party representing the ethnic Turkish minority."
