        "text": "Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic with a single house legislature based on proportional representation. The first democratic elections were held in 1990, shortly after the collapse of the Communist state.\n\nThe prime minister who is the head of government holds the most powerful executive position. The president who is the head of state primarily holds representative powers as well as limited veto powers.\n\nBulgaria is a unitary country. The territory is divided into 28 regions (oblast), with governors appointed by the prime minister. Municipalities do not have tax-collecting powers and largely depend on fiscal transfers from the state budget.\n\nHow much does Bulgaria pay and receive from the EU?\n\nThe EU budget is the tool to ensure that Europe remains a democratic, peaceful, prosperous and competitive force. The EU uses it to finance its priorities and big projects that most individual EU countries could not finance on their own.\n\nThe benefits of EU membership significantly exceed the size of the EU budget contributions and the examples are many. All Member States benefit from being part of the Single Market, a shared approach to the common challenges of migration, terrorism and climate change, and concrete gains like better transport infrastructure, modernised and digitalised public services and cutting-edge medical treatment.\n\nHow much each EU country pays into the EU budget is calculated fairly. The larger your country's economy, the more it pays – and vice versa.\n\nThe EU budget is not about giving and taking – it’s about collectively contributing to making Europe and the world a better place for us all.\n\nEU budget spending and revenue per country and per year\n\nEU-funded projects in Bulgaria\n\nMoney from the EU budget helps fund programmes and projects in all EU countries – for example to build roads, subsidise researchers and protect the environment.\n\nFind out more about how Bulgaria benefits from EU funding and recovery funds in your country or region."
