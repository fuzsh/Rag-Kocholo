        "text": "PREFACE\n\nThis preface is intended to serve as a supplement to the following Alert on Bulgaria (AL/BGR/93.001). It covers in brief the most significant developments that have occurred in Bulgaria since initial research was completed in December 1992. The information contained herein is concerned with two topics: the formation of the new government following the fall from power of the UDF in October 1992; and the issue of \"lustration bills\" (and \"lustration riders\" to bills) currently being debated in the Bulgarian parliament.\n\nFormation of the New Government\n\nIn late October of 1992, the reigning UDF was voted out of power when its sometime ally, the MRF, sided with the BSP in a parliamentary vote of no confidence.[1] In accordance with his mandate, President Zhelyu Zhelev invited each of the parties to attempt to form a new government. The UDF and the BSP both failed, but the MRF, in conjunction with the BSP and elements within the UDF, was able to form a new government that has been described as \"centrist.\"[2] Lyuben Berov, President Zhelev's economic advisor, was named the new Prime Minister. The new government was formed at the initiative of the MRF, and is dominated (in terms of seats) by the BSP. No successful coalition would have been possible, however, without the cooperation of some members of the UDF. Although UDF officials have characterized the MRF-BSP power-sharing agreement as an \"unholy alliance,\" at least 23 members of the UDF have publicly admitted to voting for the new government.[3] Preliminary indications are that the new government will live up to its \"centrist\" description. It has described its \"programme\" as being focussed primarily on \"continuation of the reform, privatization, social orientation, strengthening of national security, and denunciation of the policy of confrontation.\" The new prime minister's cabinet also seems to indicate a commitment to a politics of nonpartisan cooperation, including as it does two members of the UDF and one member of the MRF. Prime Minister Berov has announced that the members of his government \"will not be bound hand and foot to any party discipline.\"[4]\n\n\"Lustratrion\" Bills and Riders\n\nSince the end of Communist rule in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian parliament has drafted a series of four \"lustration\" bills, designed to bar members of the former regime from holding any positions of influence in post-Communist Bulgaria. The fourth and latest version of the \"lustration bill\" would (if passed) prohibit all those who occupied certain specified positions in the Bulgarian Communist Party from holding any public office. This prohibition would also extend to all those that were members of or collaborators with the Zhivkov era secret police. Any cases that appeared questionable would be referred to a special parliamentary committee, but their decision would be final; there would be no recourse to the court system following the decision of the parliamentary committee.[5] In addition, similar provisions have been attached to a variety of other bills, some of which have been passed. One of these \"lustration riders\" was attached to the Banking Law, passed in March 1992. This rider barred the same groups of people identified in the lustration bills from sitting on banking commissions or receiving pensions. On 29 July 1992, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court overturned this law, declaring it to be inconsistent with Article 6 of the 1991 Constitution (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of a variety of things, including political opinion).[6] On 11 February 1993, however, the Constitutional Court upheld a very similar law, the so-called Panev Act (also called the \"Democratization of Science Act\"), that bars persons connected with \"supreme structures of the former BCP and security services\" from holding \"managerial offices at scientific establishments, such as chiefs of departments, deans, rectors, and chief editors of serials.\"[7]\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSince the ruling Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) forced Bulgaria's long-time dictator, Todor Zhivkov, to resign in 1989, Bulgaria has made substantial progress toward the establishment of democracy. The country has had two parliamentary elections (the second of which ousted the BCP's successor party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party, from power) and a presidential election. Each of these elections were judged by international observers to be largely free and fair. For most sectors of the population, democratic rights and freedoms have been solidly established in both law and practice. The status of Bulgaria's ethnic minorities, however, has yet to be fully resolved. On one hand, the BSP did repeal the forced assimilation policies of the Zhivkov era,[8] and a predominately Turkish organization, the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), does play an important role in the parliament. On the other hand, there was strong judicial and legislative opposition to the MRF's registration as a political party, and a clause in the July 1991 Constitution banning ethnically and religiously based parties bars Rom and Macedonian parties from electoral politics. The open hostility displayed by a significant number of Bulgarian Christians towards ethnic Turks, Muslims, and Roms, the continuing incidents of discrimination and violence against Roms, and other similar considerations indicate that a culture of tolerance has yet to be established. Bulgaria has demonstrated a promising degree of respect for the rule of law and the provenance of international legal standards. While trials for incidents of corruption and human rights abuse during the Zhivkov era are being conducted, anti-communist \"witchhunts\" appear unlikely to result. Unfortunately, convictions of top level officials responsible for human rights abuses during the Zhivkov era appear to be equally unlikely to occur.\n\nPOLITICAL RESTRUCTURING\n\nThe Transition Period\n\nZhivkov Forced From Power in 1989\n\nBulgaria was occupied by Ottoman Turks from 1396 to 1878, and did not achieve complete independence until 1908. It was on the losing side in both World Wars, and communists seized power in conjunction with the \"liberation\" of Bulgaria by the Soviet Army in 1944. The Bulgarian Communist Party, under the control of Todor Zhivkov since 1954, was forcefully criticized by human rights groups for its severely authoritarian and anti-minority policies.[9] On 3 November 1989, the last day of an international environmental conference held in Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, several thousand Bulgarians participated in a pro-democracy demonstration.[10] The following week, one day after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Bulgarian Communist Party forced the resignation of Todor Zhivkov, its leader and Bulgaria's president of 35 years.[11]\n\nMladenov Institutes Reforms\n\nZhivkov was replaced by Petar Mladenov, his foreign minister, who announced in mid-November 1989 that he favored free elections and a stronger parliament. In mid-December 1989, Mladenov stated that the Communist Party's constitutional monopoly on power should be rescinded, and that free parliamentary elections should be held in early 1990. The parliament responded by repealing a repressive anti-free speech law,[12] and, on 15 January 1990, by revoking the Communist Party's monopoly on power, as well as a 1946 law banning the Agrarian Party.[13] During this period, Bulgaria experienced some of the largest independent rallies in its post-war history, with crowds of about 50,000 non- or anti-communist protestors participating. The demonstrations were peaceful, and were eventually covered by the government-controlled media. The government also dismantled a police unit that had harassed human-rights campaigners.[14]\n\nSocietal Hostility Against Bulgaria's Ethnic Minorities\n\nAs Bulgarians began to exercise freedom of speech, the hostility felt by ethnic Bulgarians towards ethnic Turks and other ethnic minorities became apparent. Groups which advocated minority rights in public demonstrations were met with marked animosity.[15] When the government announced on 29 December 1989 that it would allow ethnic Turks, Bulgarian Muslims, Roms (Gypsies), and Macedonians to readopt their traditional names (which the government had forced them to change for \"Bulgarian\" names in an assimilation campaign which began in the 1970s), ethnic Bulgarian Christians staged protests.[16] As will be discussed in the section on ethnic Turks below, there was equally vehement opposition to Turkish demands that Turkish language instruction be available in schools.[17] After nearly a year of painstaking negotiations, widespread Turkish protests over the cumbersome and costly judicial procedure adopted by the National Assembly, and significant international pressure, the government agreed in November 1990 to a relatively simple administrative procedure for resuming original names. The legislature also adopted measures guaranteeing religious freedom, but stipulated that Bulgarian would remain the official language.\n\nFreedom Of The Press\n\nOn the whole, Bulgaria now enjoys a free press. Over 600 newspapers currently publish in Bulgaria, 135 of which are privately owned, and 125 of which are owned by various political organizations. The Voice of America and broadcast services from Britain and France can be heard freely, and the new Constitution bans censorship. There are, however, occasional skirmishes over proposals to regulate the media or establish \"competency\" standards.[18] So far these debates have not yet resulted in any significant restrictions on Bulgaria's press.\n\nTrade Unions\n\nBulgaria now has two large labor union confederations, the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions of Bulgaria (KNSB), a successor to the Communist Party's trade union, and Podkrepa, a union formed in 1989 and active in the democratization movement. Unions have the right to strike, except for political reasons, and have exercised that right. While the July 1991 constitution prohibits unions from engaging in political activities, both confederations have been active in parliamentary politics. The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights reports a few cases of apparent discrimination against Podkrepa members, primarily dismissals.[19]19\n\nElections\n\nJune 1990\n\nReforms continued during the spring of 1990, while the Communist Party still controlled the government. In February 1990, the Communist Party chose a new prime minister, Andrei Lukanov.[20] Later that spring, the Communist Party changed its name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). In preparation for the elections scheduled in June 1990, opponents of the BSP united to form the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), an \"umbrella\" opposition party, with Zhelyu Zhelev as its chief.[21] The BSP won the June 1990 elections by a small majority. According to the State Department, \"[i]nternational observers pronounced the elections free, but many agreed with opposition claims that intimidation by Socialists was a factor in their victory.\"[22] Support for the BSP, however, may also have been due to the BSP's reforms, its continued influence in rural areas, and the UDF's lack of organization. Within a month after the elections, President Petar Mladenov resigned because of claims that he had sent tanks to deal with an anti-government demonstration in December 1989. The Parliament chose the leader of the UDF, Zhelyu Zhelev, to replace Mladenov on 1 August 1990.[23] BSP Prime Minister Lukanov came under pressure in November 1990, mainly because of his government's failure to halt the economic decline and improve supplies of food and consumer goods. Although he survived a vote of confidence, Lukanov quit at the end of November, 1990, following two weeks of non-violent protests and a four-day strike by the union Podkrepa.[24] His nonpartisan successor, Dimiter Popov, freed prices on 1 February 1991, which caused a six-fold price increase, but brought food back into the stores.[25]\n\nOctober 1991\n\nOn 12 July 1991, the Bulgarian National Assembly approved a new constitution which, according to Human Rights Watch, \"provides broad protection of fundamental liberties.\"[26] On 13 October 1991, Bulgaria had another democratic parliamentary election. A total of 61 parties took part, vying for 240 seats.[27] The Bulgarian Parliament uses a system of proportional representation, and only three parties won sufficient votes to meet the cutoff requirement for representation:[28] the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), eking out a victory with 111 seats; the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), taking 106; and the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), winning 23. Filip Dimitrov, leader of the UDF, was named prime minister. Although it balked at forming a full coalition with the UDF, the MRF agreed to give the UDF limited support in exchange for some concessions to the ethnic Turkish minority in Bulgaria.[29] As will be discussed in greater detail below, opposition parties nearly succeeded in denying the predominantly ethnic Turkish MRF the seats it had won because of a clause in the new Constitution forbidding the registration of political parties founded on ethnic or religious grounds.[30]\n\nJanuary 1992\n\nOn 12 January 1992, Bulgaria's first popular presidential elections took place. The incumbent president, Zhelyu Zhelev of the UDF, had been chosen by parliament on 1 August 1990 to hold the office until proper elections could be held. He and his vice-presidential running mate, Blaga Dimitrova, were elected in the second round of voting, out of a total of 21 \"tandems\" or candidate teams.[31] The BSP accepted its loss, calling the election \"a step forward in the consolidation of the democratic process in Bulgaria.\"[32] In late October, 1992, the UDF was voted out of power when the MRF sided with the BSP in a parliamentary vote of no confidence.[33]\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS QUESTIONS\n\nJudicial Investigations of Human Rights Abuses Under Zhivkov\n\nSince the fall of Zhivkov, the Bulgarian Communist Party, its successor, the BSP, and the UDF have each taken measures to investigate the allegations of human rights abuse and corruption leveled against officials of the Zhivkov era. Several major incidents have been or are being investigated, including: the suspicious death in 1978 of a prominent exiled Bulgarian dissident, Georgi Markov; Bulgaria's alleged role in the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II; cases of corruption involving Zhivkov and other high ranking Bulgarian Communist Party officials; and cases in which prison camp officials were implicated in human rights abuses. Although by and large the trials are being conducted in accordance with international legal standards, there has been a significant lack of cooperation within the Bulgarian bureaucracy.[34] Additionally, most top officials are being tried for relatively minor corruption charges, while only lower-level administrators have thus far been prosecuted for human rights abuses. The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and Helsinki Watch, as well as various media commentators, have criticized the current government's failure to prosecute former high level officials for the more serious human rights abuses which occurred during the Zhivkov era.[35]\n\nThe Status of Ethnic Minorities in Bulgaria\n\nEthnic Turks and Ethnic Bulgarian Muslims\n\n1970 - 1989: The Forced Assimilation Campaign\n\nAccording to the New York Times, about 1.5 million of Bulgaria's 9 million people are ethnic Turks, most of them located in those areas of Bulgaria that are closest to Turkey.[36] There are also about 200,000 ethnic Bulgarian Muslims, sometimes referred to as Pomaks (a term they find demeaning).[37] In the 1970s, Bulgarian authorities began a policy of forcing Bulgarian Muslims to change their Islamic names to similar-sounding traditionally Bulgarian names.[38] This \"forced assimilation\" campaign was extended to Bulgaria's ethnic Turks in the early 1980s, and was at its height in the mid-1980s.[39] Turkish-language schools and newspapers were shut down, mosques were closed except on religious holidays, and Turkish boys were even checked on a regular basis to see if they had been circumcised.[40]\n\n1989: 310,000 Ethnic Turks Flee to Turkey\n\nIn the spring of 1989, the Bulgarian government began to exert extreme pressure on ethnic Turks to leave Bulgaria altogether. At first, Turkish Prime Minister Ozal promised that Turkey would accept every ethnic Turk who fled Bulgaria.[41] In August 1989, however, after more than 310,000 ethnic Turks had crossed into Turkey, the Turkish government closed the border. By mid-December 1989, about 65,000 of these expatriates had returned to Bulgaria.[42]\n\nResuming Traditional Ethnic Turkish and Muslim Names\n\nBoth ethnic Turks and ethnic Bulgarian Muslims staged demonstrations in December 1989 demanding the right to resume their original names.[43] Bulgarian Christians were vocal in their opposition to minority rights, particularly regarding the issue of traditional names.[44] As mentioned above, it took from mid-December 1989 to November 1990, a period marked by widespread anti-Turkish strikes and demonstrations, for an acceptable procedure for the resumption of traditional names to be adopted.[45]\n\nParticipation By The MRF In Parliamentary Politics\n\nThe July 1991 Constitution adopted by Bulgaria's parliament expressly forbids the registration of political parties founded on ethnic, racial or religious bases. The ban also extends to any associations or religious societies which have political aims, or which engage in political activities. Human Rights Watch maintains that \"such a narrow view of freedom of association has no place in a democratic society.\"[46] The State Department concurs, stating that \"[t]he constitutional ban on ethnic- and religious-based political parties seems to conflict with Bulgaria's commitments within the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\"[47] The Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), although predominantly Turkish and Muslim, is not exclusively so. The spokesperson for the movement at the time of the elections, for instance, was Jewish. The MRF won 23 parliamentary seats in the 1990 elections, officially running as a \"movement\" rather than as a party. When the MRF attempted to register a parallel political party, however (the Rights and Freedoms Party), the Supreme Court declared the party unconstitutional.[48] Pressure from western ambassadors may have been central in the Court's decision on September 20 to allow the MRF to register for the 13 October 1991 elections. According to the State Department, the decision was made on a technicality: the Central Electoral Commission ruled that the registration of the MRF for the parliamentary elections in 1990 (before the Constitution was changed) was a permanent registration which could not be revoked.[49] Despite reported acts of intimidation in the countryside (where most ethnic Turks live) about 6% of the population voted for the MRF in the 13 October elections.[50]\n\nSocietal Hostility Toward Ethnic Turks\n\nAnti-Turkish sentiments continue to be expressed and exploited by ethnic Bulgarian parties, notably by elements within the BSP, which have openly appealed to anti-Turkish sentiments in their political campaigns. Other radical nationalist organizations which have made anti-Turkish statements include the Bulgarian National Radical Party, the Fatherland Party of Labor, the Bulgarian National Democratic Party, and the People's Committee for Defense of the National Interest.[51]\n\nTurkish Language Classes\n\nOne of the concessions won by ethnic Turks from the BSP was a promise that Turkish language instruction would eventually be made available in public schools. In March 1991, anti-Turkish organizations blockaded schools and staged hunger strikes to protest the institution of Turkish language instruction.[52] The legislature responded by first postponing, and then (on 1 October 1991) prohibiting the teaching of minority languages in Bulgarian schools. A widespread Turkish school boycott followed, and the BSP lifted the ban shortly before leaving office.[53] In November 1991, the newly elected government (relying heavily on support from the largely ethnic Turkish MRF to stay in power) issued a decree stating that minority children in the third through eighth grades could receive minority language instruction as an optional subject, after school hours, for four hours a week.[54]\n\nRelations Between Ethnic Turks And Bulgarian Muslims\n\nFriction also exists between ethnic Bulgarian Muslims (Pomaks) and ethnic Turks. Some Bulgarian Muslims are opposed to the MRF, which is seen by them as being dominated by ethnic Turks. According to a New York Times analyst, such attitudes stem from \"a distrust handed down from the days of Ottoman rule and made worse by the communists.\"[55]\n\nAccountability For Human Rights Abuses Against Turks\n\nSome provisions are being made to redress past human rights abuses against ethnic Turks. Bulgarian citizens who were forced to leave during the 1989 anti-Turkish campaign are receiving some compensation for confiscated property and lost jobs when they return to Bulgaria, and in January 1992 the Bulgarian Interior Ministry fired 28 policemen for having been actively involved in the forced Turkish name-changing campaign under Zhivkov.[56] Nevertheless, Bulgaria still lacks any real consensus as to the rights of Bulgarian minorities. A \"Bill Against Ethnic Discrimination\" introduced by EcoGlasnost, which would have adopted the standards of international human rights law on the treatment of minorities, failed to pass parliament, and no effort has been made to investigate the torture of Turkish political prisoners under Zhivkov.[57]\n\nFuture Status of Ethnic Turks in Bulgaria\n\nThe sheer number of ethnic Turks in Bulgaria (they make up about 10% of the Bulgarian population), the weight of international concern, the fact that both of Bulgaria's two major parties need MRF support to attain a parliamentary majority, and the political acumen of MRF leader Ahmed Dogan have all combined to afford Bulgaria's ethnic Turks a certain amount of security despite a continued mood of general hostility towards minorities. Until a social consensus is reached regarding the rights of minorities, however, the status of ethnic Turks will remain uncertain.[58]\n\nRoms (Gypsies)\n\nHistory of Roms (Gypsies) in the Zhivkov Era\n\nBulgaria's approximately 850,000 Roms (Gypsies) comprise just under 10% of Bulgaria's population of 9 million. Roms were primarily nomadic until the mid-1950s, when the Bulgarian government began a campaign of forced assimilation, severely restricting traditional Rom religious and cultural practices. Roms were forced to settle in Soviet-style collective farms or in specially-built housing projects, mostly in the cities of Sofia, Plovdiv, Sliven, Varna, Rousse and Vidin.[59]\n\nStatus of Roms in Bulgaria\n\nMost Bulgarian Roms live in crowded conditions (sometimes as many as 20 people to a room) in rundown housing projects where the unemployment rate among Roms usually runs from 50% - 80%. Crime levels are estimated to be seven times as high in the Rom ghettos as elsewhere in Bulgaria, and the social services available (e.g. garbage collection, street sweeping) have been described as being \"vastly inferior\" to those provided to other communities.[60] The government maintains that Roms are equal under law, and that it is unable to provide better educational facilities and social benefits because of the poor state of the economy.[61] Reports by the State Department and Helsinki Watch, however, indicate continued discrimination against Roms in housing, employment opportunities and job security, military service, and education.[62] Bulgaria's police are predicting \"Los Angeles style riots\" if increasing ethnic tensions, and tensions between the Rom community and the police force, are not somehow relieved. After a clash in the Stolipinovo ghetto left one dead and 18 wounded, the Bulgarian government stepped up attempts to alleviate the tension between police and Roms. Plans include the teaching of non-violent crowd control tactics, the hiring of police who are Roms, cooperation with leaders in the Rom communities, and the institution of a national program aimed at settling the acute social problems of Roms.[63]\n\nRoms: The Constitutional Ban on Ethnic Parties\n\nAs mentioned above, the 13 July 1991 Constitution expressly forbids ethnic-based political parties from registering to take part in elections, a decision which the State Department characterizes as being in \"conflict with Bulgaria's commitments within the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\"[64] The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights concurs, stating that the ban has \"significantly infringed the right of political participation of ethnic and religious minorities.\"[65] Organizations representing Roms were not allowed to participate in either the 1990 or the 1991 elections. The general feeling of hostility towards Bulgaria's ethnic minorities has resulted in a failure on the part of the current parliament to champion the cause of the Roms, or support constitutional provisions guaranteeing minority rights. Helsinki Watch charges that Roms \"frequently face open discrimination from members of the Bulgarian government and parliament,\" including but not limited to ethnic slurs and derogatory stereotyping.[66]\n\nMacedonians\n\nThe traditional Macedonian region of the Balkans is now divided by the borders of Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia (now an unrecognized republic of Macedonia), and Greece. Macedonians, like ethnic Turks and Roms (Gypsies), were targeted in the forced assimilation campaign of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1991, the Bulgarian Supreme Court denied two ethnic Macedonian organizations, Ilinden and Ilinden Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization- Independent, the right to register as political organizations because they were deemed to be separatist organizations that threatened the security of Bulgaria. The State Department characterized this decision as in \"conflict with Bulgaria's commitments within the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\"[67] The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights concurs, stating that the ban has \"significantly infringed the right of political participation of ethnic and religious minorities.\"[68] Helsinki Watch maintains that the groups should have been permitted to register, as they have explicitly disavowed the use of violence and have recognized the territorial integrity of Bulgaria.[69]\n\nVietnamese Guest Workers\n\nIn 1991 there were 13,000 Vietnamese \"guest workers\" in Bulgaria, employed on short-term contracts, usually in unskilled positions. After a riot between Vietnamese and ethnic Bulgarians brought in police (who killed two Vietnamese and wounded others), the Bulgarian government moved to return to Vietnam the majority of the Vietnamese before the expiration of their contracts.[70]\n\nJews\n\nAccording to all available sources, both governmental and societal attitudes towards Bulgaria's estimated 6,000 Jews are quite positive. Although Bulgaria was allied with Germany in World War II, the Bulgarian parliament, church leaders and societal groups refused to allow Germans to deport Bulgaria's 50,000 Jews to concentration camps. During the Communist Party era between 1945 and 1989, the Bulgarian government allowed about 90 per cent of Bulgarian jews to emigrate, most to Israel. many who remained retained prominent positions in academics, the arts and professions, although most had trouble obtaining higher level positions in the Communist Party and the government. There are currently no restrictions on religious, economic or political freedoms of Bulgarian jews in law, nor, according to available reports, in practice. As mentioned above, the spokesperson of the predominantly Turkish Movement for Freedom and Rights is Jewish.[71]\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBulgaria has made substantial, and largely consensual, progress towards implementing and maintaining democratic processes and institutions. It is important to note, however, that laws protecting the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, as well as those of former government officials who have not been tried and found guilty of specific crimes, have often been implemented as a result of pressure or fear of pressure from the United States and Europe. Incidents of open hostility and discrimination continue to mar relations between \"mainstream\" Bulgarians and the ethnic and religious minorities. Until a consensus is reached regarding the rights of minorities and political dissenters (a goal few democracies have achieved) the potential for an escalation of human rights violations will continue to exist.\n\n[1] \"Bulgaria Forming New Government,\" Washington Post (Washington, D.C.: 30 October 1992), p.
