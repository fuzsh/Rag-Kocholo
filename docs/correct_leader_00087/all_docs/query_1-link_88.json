        "text": "The heir to the Italian throne plans to finally return home. But he likely will get an indifferent reception from citizens, who remain republicans at heart. After 56 years in exile, what's a Crown prince to do?\n\nPerhaps Vittorio Emanuele, who is now 65, might consider the example of another royal who was exiled while still a boy after the Second World War. The former King Simeon II is living a remarkably productive life as Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (or Saxcoburggotski), Prime Minister of his native Bulgaria. This week, he met British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London and won support for Bulgarian membership in NATO.\n\nThe Prime Minister, who ruled as king at the end of the war, promised when elected that he'd turn the country around in 400 days. Judgment day has passed and most Bulgarians think he's done reasonably well -- corruption remains endemic and living standards haven't budged much, but public finances have improved and a few foreign investors are showing interest. He works 18 hours a day.\n\n\"I am a humble pragmatist,\" he says.\n\nVittorio Emanuele has a reputation for being a bit dissolute. His son, Emanuele Filiberto, is a jet-setter with similar instincts. If they really want to make an impact in their ancestral home, they might think about running for office. Italy is no Bulgaria, but -- then again -- Mussolini's granddaughter Alessandra has made a fine career out of politics."
