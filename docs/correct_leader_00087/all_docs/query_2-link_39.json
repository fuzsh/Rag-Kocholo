        "text": "Konstantin-Assen, Prince of Vidin, Duke of Saxony (born 5 December 1967) is the fourth son of Tsar Simeon II of Bulgaria and his wife Dona Margarita Gomez-Acebo Cejuela. He is known also as Konstantin-Assen of Bulgaria and Konstantin-Assen of Vidin, the latter being the title of the fourth son of Bulgarian kings. He was born in Madrid. Simeon II was exiled as a child when Bulgaria ceased to be a monarchy, so Simeon's wife and children never received any royal title from Bulgaria.\n\nEducation and Career\n\nKonstantin-Assen studied business in Spain before gaining a Masters degree from Columbia University, United States. Currently he is the Country Manager for Barclays Bank in Spain, having previously served at Rothschild Bank in Madrid as Co-Head of their Spanish office.\n\nMarriage and Issue\n\nIn Madrid on 7 July 1994 Konstantin-Assen married Dona Maria Garcia de la Rasilla Gortazar, daughter of Alvaro Garcia de la Rasilla Pineda and his wife Maria de Gortazar Ybarra, daughter of Manuel Maria de Gortazar Landecho, 9th Count of Superunda, City Councilor of the Ayuntamiento of Bilbao, and wife (m. Algorta, Getxo, Biscay, 8 November 1932) Maria del Rosario de Ybarra y Berge (Bilbao, 13 June 1908-), niece of Ignacio de Gortazar e Ybarra, 10th Count of Superunda.\n\nThey have twins: Umberto (b. 20 November 1999) and Sofia (b. 20 November 1999).\n\nKonstantin-Assen is godfather of Infanta Sofia of Spain, the younger daughter of King Felipe VI of Spain. The King of Spain is in turn the godfather to Konstantin's own daughter, Sofia, along with her maternal grandmother Maria de Gortazar e Ybarra. Prince Umberto's godparents are Ramon Ros Bigeriego and his grandmother Queen Margarita.\n\nTitle\n\n5 December His Royal Highness Konstantin-Assen, of Vidin and Duke of Saxony\n\n(https://www.kingsimeon.bg)\n\nHouse: Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Kohary"
