The Program during the second day of the course started with his lecture.\n\nMr. Saxe-Coburg Gotha said that he was very happy to see how young people progress in their lives and careers in a completely different society. “For us, the elder people, democracy has no price”, he said.\n\nThe former Prime Minister highlighted the importance of the institutions because without them there would not be a strong state system. In his opinion they should not been personalized because they symbolize the state.\n\nMr. Simeon Mr. Saxe-Coburg Gotha shared with the participants his memories about the Bulgarian School of Politics founder – Mr. Dimi Panitza.\n\nThe program continued with a lecture for the financial and economic crisis in the Euro zone. The lecturers were Mr. Sebastian Barnes, the head of the EU / Euro Department at the OECD, and Mr. Georgi Ganev, who is a program director at the Center for Liberal Strategies.\n\nThe afternoon started with a session on the EU budget.
