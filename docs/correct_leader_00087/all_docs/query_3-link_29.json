        "text": "The Executive Office of the Bulgarian president is in the Presidency building, which is located on 2 Dondukov Boulevard (commonly referred to as “The yellow pavement”). The National honor guard is mounted at the entrance to the building and the sentries are changed hourly. On the first Wednesday of each month, at 12:00, you can see the official changing of the guards complete with music, battle shouting and weapon brandishing.\n\nThe building was built in 1950 during the communist period.\n\nThe oldest preserved buildings in Sofia – the Rotunda church of St. George, the ruins of a late antiquity public complex and Emperor Constantine the Great’s palace are located in the courtyard of the Presidency.\n\nThe so-called “Coat of Arms Hall” has the purpose of welcoming international delegations, signing contracts and other official event. Smaller group meetings are held at the “Red Room”, formal dining takes place at the “Mirror Hall” and common appointments – at the “Blue Room. The president’s official chambers are facing the archaeological museum."
