        "text": "Ferdinand (born Feb. 26, 1861, Vienna, Austria—died Sept. 10, 1948, Coburg, Ger.) was a prince (1887–1908) and the first king (1908–18) of modern Bulgaria.\n\nThe youngest son of Prince Augustus (August) I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Ferdinand was elected prince of Bulgaria on July 7, 1887, as successor to the first ruler of that autonomous principality, Alexander I, who was forced by a pro-Russian coup d’état to abdicate the preceding year. Though dominated by his prime minister, Stefan Stambolov, during the early years of his reign, he became an important factor influencing national affairs after his minister’s humiliating fall from power (1894). Ferdinand’s dynastic position, which long suffered from lack of recognition by the Great Powers, was strengthened by his marriage to the Bourbon princess Maria Luisa of Parma (April 1893) and later by his infant son Boris’s reception into the Orthodox church (February 1896). The assurance of an Orthodox successor to the Bulgarian throne, as well as the skillful performance of Konstantin Stoilov’s government in maintaining national independence, eventually prompted Russia to seek a diplomatic rapprochement. In March 1896 Ferdinand finally received international confirmation of his rule.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
