        "text": "By Dan and Billie Jo Rylance\n\n[note: UW Oshkosh Associate Professor of Special Education Billie Jo Rylance was recently awarded a Fulbright Scholarship taking her to Bulgaria. Her husband Dan is a former teacher, legislator, and editorial page editor. He writes regularly for Commentary. While in Bulgaria, Billie Jo and Dan will send letters to be posted on the Commentary site. Below is the third installment. --Tony Palmeri].\n\nSOFIA--As we leave the silence of the forests and return to the noise of the city, we wish to change topics. We have tasted small fragments of the rich culture of this small but diverse country. Now we want to explore ideas. Ours is a modest endeavor. We are only short term observors not experts. What we think and write here is very preliminary, most cursory, but nevertheless worth sharing.\n\nIn the broadest sense, we begin with the thoughts of Dr. Magdalena Elchinova, chairman of the Anthropology\n\nDepartment at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia. We were honored to be among her students at Pamorovo\n\nover the last three weeks.\n\nShe writes: \"Public discourse in Eastern Europe in the last ten years have been shaped by the rhetoric of transition. Not only are words like transition, change, shift, crises, perspective, etc, widely used, but a specific set of ambivalent interpretations is\n\nattributed to them, too. According to popular opinion in Bulgaria it is transition that makes life hard, choices difficult, and perspectives unclear.\"\n\nThe current leaders of Bulgaria demonstrate the complexities of transition. The president is Georgi Parvanov,a Socialist and former Communist. The prime minister is Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the former king of Bulgaria, who was forced to leave in 1946, at age nine, after the Communist takeover.\n\nBulgaria remains a small nation with an internal inferiority complex struggling to achieve parity with greater Europe. Historically, no Balkan country exited the last century a winner and they entered the present century as frustrated as they were in the last century.\n\nUnfortunately Communism was stronger in Bulgaria and Romania than Hungary or Poland. Dissent was impossible except within the membership of the Communist Party. Furthermore, there was no existing elite to form the backbone of any transition process. As a result, there is a dramatic institutional vaccum and reform has fallen on the wrong groups such as the Mafia.\n\nBulgaria's future rests with modernization, democracy and the rules of a free-market economy. While the country does not experience international terrorism like the West, it suffers from institutional instability which fosters criminals who operate boldy. In short, Bulgaria society is divided between a small group of winners and a vast majority of losers.\n\nBulgaria's future rests with NATO (now a member) and EU (in 2007) Support of present U.S. Foreign policy should not be interpreted as an endorsement of President Bush. Instead it reflects the belief that a U.S. presence is a better guarantee for Bulgaria than either the old great powers of Europe or the newly emerging Mafia."
