RES. 77 Commemorating the 60th anniversary of the historic rescue of 50,000 Bulgarian Jews from the Holocaust and commending the Bulgarian people for preserving and continuing their tradition of ethnic and religious tolerance. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES March 4, 2003 Mr. Wilson of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. Weldon of Pennsylvania, Mr. Lantos, Mr. Bereuter, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and Mr. Rohrabacher) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on International Relations _______________________________________________________________________ CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Commemorating the 60th anniversary of the historic rescue of 50,000 Bulgarian Jews from the Holocaust and commending the Bulgarian people for preserving and continuing their tradition of ethnic and religious tolerance. Whereas the people of the United States and the Republic of Bulgaria respect all faiths, including Judaism and Jewish culture; Whereas during World War II, despite being allied with Germany, Bulgarians did not cede to Nazi pressure to fully enforce anti-Jewish legislation and resisted orders to deport their Jewish compatriots to Nazi concentration camps; Whereas in the spring of 1943 the Bulgarian people succeeded in preventing the deportation of 50,000 Jews to such camps; Whereas Bulgaria was the only European country during World War II to increase its Jewish population; Whereas members of the Bulgarian Parliament, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, King Boris III, politicians, intellectuals, and citizens all played a part in the resistance to Nazi pressure to carry out the deportation; Whereas March 2003 marks the 60th anniversary of Bulgaria's refusal to deport its Jews to Nazi concentration camps; Whereas the Bulgarian people today preserve and continue their tradition of ethnic and religious tolerance; and Whereas President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha are leading the United States and Bulgaria into a long-term strategic partnership: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That Congress-- (1) commemorates the 60th anniversary of the historic rescue of 50,000 Bulgarian Jews from the Holocaust and commends the Bulgarian people for preserving and continuing their tradition of ethnic and religious tolerance; and (2) reiterates its support for strong ties between the United States and Bulgaria. <all>"
