        "text": "Premier Date March 6, 1999\n\nOctober 6, 2000 Director Hosoda Mamoru Character Design Animator Character Designer Nakatsuru Katsuyoshi Animation Director Yamashita Takaaki Producer Seki Hiromi\n\nComposer Arisawa Takanori Duration 21 minutes Home Release December 1, 1999 Official Site\n\nDigimon Adventure (デジモンアドベンチャー Dejimon Adobenchā)[N 1] is a short film. It is both the first released anime production and the first film in the Digimon franchise. It is a prequel to the Digimon Adventure television anime series.\n\nDigimon Adventure premiered on March 6, 1999, as part of '99 Spring Toei Anime Fair, alongside Dr. Slump: Arale's Surprising Burn and . The first episode of the Adventure television series premiered on Fuji TV the following day.\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nSummary[edit]\n\nFraming Device[edit]\n\nYagami Taichi (age 11) reflects on his first encounter with a Digital Monster and how it changed the course of his life.\n\nAct One[edit]\n\nIt is the spring of 1995.[N 2] Late one night, electronic devices in the Hikarigaoka area experience a wave of strange glitches. Taichi (age 7[4]) awakens to find his sister Yagami Hikari (age 3[5]) staring at the family computer. The computer monitor is flashing red with static, and an egg-like shape has appeared on its monitor and caught Hikari's attention. The egg shape—a Digitama—emerges from the computer.\n\nThe next morning, Taichi's mother, Yagami Yuuko, awakens him and asks him to look after Hikari while she runs errands. Taichi is convinced that the events from the night before were a strange dream, until he looks into Hikari's bunk and sees that she is holding the Digitama.\n\nAt breakfast, Hikari insists on clinging to the Digitama while she is seated at the table. When she reaches for her drink, the Digitama slips out of her lap and rolls itself away from her. Hikari chases the Digitama around the house, while Taichi does not realize what is going on until he almost trips on the Digitama. It rolls back into the siblings' bedroom and, as they watch, hatches into a Botamon.\n\nBotamon immediately attempts to attack Taichi by latching onto his face, then runs and hides under their bed. Taichi attempts to attack it with his goggles, scaring it into blasting him with bubbles. Hikari, instead, strikes a rapport with it through her whistle: when she blows her whistle, Botamon responds by blowing short blasts of bubbles the same number of times. Botamon's bubbles escape their room and begin drifting all around the Hikarigaoka area.\n\nThe two find that Botamon has a very large appetite, as Hikari keeps feeding it. Taichi is at a loss as to what it is or what to do with it, and Hikari keeps rejecting his names for it. The phone rings, but when Taichi answers it, the phone experiences a severe malfunction. When he returns to the bedroom, he finds that Botamon has evolved into Koromon.\n\nHikari takes Miiko's food bowl to give to Koromon. In gratitude, Koromon latches onto Hikari and Taichi's faces. While it is eating the food, Miiko enters and attacks it. Koromon is terrified and attempts to run away, and when Taichi attempts to intervene, Miiko scratches him, then Koromon, before leaving with the food bowl.\n\nLater that evening, when Yuuko comes home, Hikari and Koromon begin talking to each other, to Taichi's surprise. Out of gratitude and as a \"sign of friendship,\" Koromon latches onto both of their faces again.\n\nAct Two[edit]\n\nLate that night, another wave of glitches impact electronic devices around Hikarigaoka, and children begin to notice. Hikari wakes Taichi because Koromon appears to be extremely ill. Before their eyes, Koromon evolves again, into an enormous Agumon who shatters their bunk bed with its sheer size.\n\nMeanwhile, Yagami Susumu comes home, drunk and rowdy, but in good spirits. Yuuko, who is totally unaware of anything that is transpiring in the bedroom, tries to prevent him from going in and waking them, while Taichi blocks the door and prevents him from opening it and seeing \"Koromon\"/Agumon. Susumu is eventually dissuaded and leaves, but when \"Koromon\" forces its way out the window and destroys it, the sound alerts Yuuko. Before Taichi can do anything, \"Koromon\" leaps out of the apartment, with Hikari riding it, and crushes a car. Taichi runs out to chase them, against Yuuko's protests.\n\n\"Koromon\"/Agumon and Hikari explore the Hikarigaoka area. \"Koromon,\" not knowing what it is doing and despite Hikari's protests, causes some damage around the area: it smashes a vending machine, blows up a phone booth, nearly attacks a bus, and attempts to attack some aircraft lights in the sky. Hikari notices that \"Koromon\" is no longer speaking. Meanwhile, Taichi follows the trail of destruction that \"Koromon\" leaves behind.\n\nAct Three[edit]\n\nAnother wave of electronic disturbances hits the area as \"Koromon\"/Agumon senses that something is coming. A massive Digitama appears in the sky above Hikarigaoka, then splits in half, releasing a Parrotmon, who descends onto a street. \"Koromon\" attempts to attack it, but its shots miss or fail to harm it. Meanwhile, children gather at their balconies and windows to observe, including Takenouchi Sora, Ishida Yamato, Takaishi Takeru, Kido Jo, Izumi Kōshirō, and Tachikawa Mimi.\n\nJust as Taichi arrives on the scene and rejoins Hikari, Parrotmon retaliates with an electric blast that shatters the bridge above \"Koromon\"/Agumon, Taichi and Hikari, causing debris from the bridge to rain down on \"Koromon.\" At this moment, another wave of electronic disturbances occurs, disrupting the apartment lights and Jo's phone call. By the time that the dust clears, \"Koromon\" has evolved again, into Greymon. Taichi is reminded of Koromon's earlier comments about a \"sign of friendship.\"\n\n\"Koromon\"/Greymon engages Parrotmon in a lengthy, vicious fight. It unleashes a blast of fire that tears off Parrotmon's wing and grapples with it, piercing its lower beak with its horn. During the fight, the two smash cars and street infrastructure all around them. Eventually, Parrotmon throws \"Koromon\" aside and blasts it with electricity again, knocking it out.\n\nHikari is distraught, and she and Taichi attempt to rouse \"Koromon\"/Greymon, with no effect, as Parrotmon stalks closer to them. Hikari tries blowing her whistle for \"Koromon\" again, but she is unable to make a sound with it, as she is crying and out of breath. Taichi sees this and is inspired, so he snatches the whistle from Hikari, takes a deep breath, and blows it with all his might. The sound of the whistle reverberates all around the Hikarigaoka street and draws the attention of the onlookers, including Takeru and Sora.\n\nIn response to the whistle, \"Koromon\"/Greymon snaps back to life and, at Taichi's command, unleashes another blast of fire that consumes both it and Parrotmon. The two Digimon disappear.\n\nAs the sun begins to rise, Hikari, saddened, cries out for \"Koromon\" over and over, imploring it to come back to her.\n\nScreenshots[edit]\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nHome Media Box Art[edit]\n\nCredits[edit]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\n\nTheme Song: \"Butter-Fly\"\n\nSongwriter/Composer: Chiwata Hidenori (千綿偉功)\n\nArranger: Watanabe Cher (渡部チェル)\n\nArtist(s): Wada Kouji (和田光司)\n\n(NEC Interchannel)\n\nProduction[edit]\n\nConception[edit]\n\nThe film project that eventually became Digimon Adventure was the first Digimon anime production to be greenlit, approximately a month and a half before a television anime was also greenlit. As such, it was for the most part produced as a standalone film; the bookends seen in the final cut, featuring Yagami Taichi as he appears in the Adventure television series, were only added after the series had been greenlit.[7]\n\nThe film was the directorial debut of Hosoda Mamoru, who had been working for Toei Animation for several years at that point. Ever since he had commenced at Toei, he had wanted to make films, and Toei's producers granted him an opportunity to do so with both this film and the later Digimon Adventure: Our War Game! However, Toei constrained his film work to short films of a maximum of 40 minutes in length.[8] Character designer Nakatsuru Katsuyoshi was also attached to the film project from its inception.[7]\n\nAs with their counterparts on the Adventure television series, the film's production crew were initially at a loss as to how to develop a story out of the Digimon virtual pets, which at the time were the only franchise material that they had to work with. Despite this, Nakatsuru drafted some character designs which Hosoda characterized as resembling comic books from the 1970s, and the rest of the crew used these designs as inspiration.[7]\n\nAs \"Digital Monster\"[edit]\n\nOne early concept for the film was simply titled \"Digital Monster.\" It was intended to be a prequel to a then-current concept for an upcoming televised anime series, also titled \"Digital Monster\", but was to be set significantly further in the series' past. The film would have starred a character by the name of Akira—the father of the planned protagonist of the Digital Monster anime, dubbed \"Kou\" in a step outline[9] (in contrast to a planning document for the series itself from August 1998, which called him \"Yūsuke\"[10])—and would have depicted what was billed as \"the first encounter between humans and Digital Monsters\" in Akira's own childhood. A character named \"Hikari\" is also present in said step outline, but unlike Yagami Hikari, she has no pre-existing relationship to Akira.[9]\n\nIn the story presented in released pages from the step outline, a Botamon Digitama appears out of thin air in front of Akira while he is working on a radio. Botamon/Koromon is immediately friendly and attached to Akira, but after an encounter with a cat, Koromon follows its senses to a nearby electronics repair shop, where he and Akira meet Hikari and her Digimon, Tanemon.[9]\n\nAs Digimon Adventure[edit]\n\nAround the fall of 1998, however, plans for a multimedia franchise to run alongside the anime emerged in the form of Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01,[11] and it was agreed that both the anime and V-Tamer 01 would share a main protagonist. Because of this, Nakatsuru's initial character designs for the film were abandoned in favor of said shared protagonist, Taichi.[7]\n\nOut of concern about contradictions that could be caused by setting the film in the same time period as the television series, it was decided to instead make it a prequel to the series. The film crew's initial concept, similar to the \"Digital Monster\" pitch, was to instead star Taichi's father, Yagami Susumu, in his own childhood around the beginning of the 1964 Summer Olympics; this version would have been a comedy where the characters would cause mayhem around Tokyo. However, Toei executives rejected this script, and directed the production crew to abandon the 1960s setting[7] and instead—in response to other film studios' scheduling of kaijū films in their spring 1999 lineups[12]—take the film in the direction of a Digimon-themed kaijū film.[7][12] Going forward, while they retained the prequel idea, they settled on setting the film just four years before the television series.[7]\n\nWriting[edit]\n\nIn a midnight meeting after receiving the kaijū directive, Hosoda, writer Yoshida Reiko, and producer Seki Hiromi developed the final premise of the film, which arose out of the conclusion that the film was ultimately a story about children meeting Digimon, so a focus on the usual trappings of kaijū films like city destruction was unnecessary. Their thinking was also partly motivated by the film's limited run time of twenty minutes, which they felt would not be long enough for a typical kaijū film.[7]\n\nHosoda's conception of \"Koromon\" as neither friend nor enemy inspired the idea of setting the film's climax between apartment complexes, which would act as a \"coliseum\" from which an audience of children could naturally watch the \"kaijū\" fight from a dispassionate remove above them. Such a setting also allowed for the film's action to be restricted to one location, in further deference to the twenty-minute run time. Hikarigaoka was chosen simply because it was the nearest apartment complex to their office, allowing for easy accesss for location scouting; it replaced early plans for the story to be set in downtown Tokyo.[7]\n\nIn order to add some depth to the Digimon, Hosoda thought of using evolution as a way to explore multiple sides of the same entity, \"Koromon,\" in the short run time. Hence, \"Koromon\"'s disposition, ability to communicate, and relationship with Taichi and Hikari change radically between its four forms. As part of this, although neither Digimon was planned to be able to talk at first (since the decision that Digimon could talk had not yet been made by the Adventure series production crew, either), some lines of dialogue were added for the Digimon's Koromon form during the storyboarding process, but for none of its other forms, creating a minor plot beat that \"Koromon\" suddenly loses the ability to speak upon evolving. Taichi and Hikari's initial views on the Digimon were also intended to be linked to \"Koromon\"'s evolution to play into the theme of seeing the Digimon in different lights.[7]\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nIn order to reflect both the film's status as a prequel to the series (in which the children and Digimon definitively are friends) and the nature of kaijū, Hosoda wanted the film to not treat the Digimon as if they were as pets or belonged to anybody, but rather as independent entities to be respected and given the same weight as humans. He emphasized tension over whether \"Koromon\" is a friend or enemy to Taichi and Hikari. \"Koromon\"'s destructive wandering around Hikarigaoka was written with this in mind, as was the fight between \"Koromon\" and Parrotmon, which was envisioned like a fight between two wild animals with no concept of right or wrong applicable to either side. That Taichi and Hikari side with \"Koromon\" in the fight, in Hosoda's opinion, is largely because it was coincidentally the first of the two Digimon that they they happened to meet.[7]\n\nHikari was designed by Nakatsuru. Her whistle was already present on his first rough draft design for the character, and it inspired both the role of the whistle in the film, and Taichi and Hikari's opposing initial viewpoints on the Digimon from each other: while Taichi starts out embodying the everyday \"world of language\" and is accordingly suspicious and unable to accept \"Koromon\" at first, Hikari represents a \"world of senses\" without the ability to communicate through words, enabling her to be immediately willing and able to accept and reach out to \"Koromon\" in a way that Taichi cannot. Their experiences after Koromon evolves into Agumon, and during the Parrotmon fight, were framed as causing each to adopt the other's views and accept the other's \"world,\" symbolized by Taichi using Hikari's whistle to awaken \"Koromon\" non-verbally, and Hikari verbally crying out for \"Koromon\" to come back to her. Hosoda has characterized the nature of their respective changes of heart as setting up the reason why, of the two, only Taichi was able to enter the Digital World at first in the Adventure series.[7]\n\nThe initial storyboards did not feature any of the other six Chosen Children from the Adventure series. They were added into the film at Seki's suggestion to establish a link with the series. To continue the theme of ambiguity and neutrality toward the Digimon, Hosoda directed Kido Jo's voice actor to avoid any hints of bias toward either Digimon when performing the character's descriptions of the fight.[7]\n\nYagami Yuuko and Susumu were intentionally depicted without ever showing their faces due to Hosoda's preference at the time for using only \"essential\" elements in the stories of his films. He reasoned that while the presence of the two is necessary to the plot, they are otherwise not essential given that the film is about the children, and that showing any more of them would have required adding unnecessary exploration of their characters.[7]\n\nReception[edit]\n\nThe producers of Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris, which was released on the same day as Digimon Adventure, largely praised the film and noted that they must create films like it.[13]\n\nThe Digimon Adventure short film and Digimon Adventure: Our War Game! have been credited with bringing director Hosoda Mamoru to the attention of Studio Ghibli head producer Suzuki Toshio, who is said to have identified him as a potential successor to Miyazaki Hayao on the basis of his work on the two short films. This led to a brief tenure at Studio Ghibli in which Hosoda was, for a time, attached as the director of Howl's Moving Castle, although he departed both the project and the studio over creative differences before its completion.[14]\n\nIn light of Hosoda's subsequent high-profile career, the Adventure short film and Our War Game!—in their original incarnations, independent of the recut versions in Digimon: The Movie—have attracted a small degree of retrospective critical interest from Western anime and pop culture press. Such retrospectives typically praise Adventure for its charisma and emotional resonance, its representation of the perspectives, emotions, and relationships of children, its atmosphere and visual storytelling, and how these traits set it apart from its origins as a tie-in to a toy franchise. It is also commonly characterized as an early demonstration of Hosoda's directorial style and talents.[15][16][17]\n\nIn May 2020, in a Digimon Web poll in which users voted on their favorite Digimon films, Digimon Adventure placed fourth, earning 9% of the vote.[1]\n\nExtra[edit]\n\nEvolutions[edit]\n\nDigitama → Botamon → Koromon → Agumon → Greymon\n\nIn Other Media[edit]\n\nThree episodes of the Digimon Adventure television anime series directly address the events of this film:\n\nIn \"Mammon, the Great Clash at Hikarigaoka!\", the seven Chosen Children (Yagami Hikari is not yet part of the group at the time) return to the scene of the battle in Hikarigaoka four years later, and inadvertently re-enact it when Takenouchi Sora's Garudamon fights a Mammon sent by Vamdemon. They had forgotten the true nature of the events of that night prior to that point, but the familiarity of the sight of the battle jogs their memories and helps them reconstruct their recollections of what actually happened that night.\n\nIt is established that the media had reported the destruction caused by the fight as a terrorist bombing (this story had displaced what they actually witnessed in their recollections up to this point), and that their families had all moved away from Hikarigaoka afterwards.\n\nThe battle also has significance to the plot going forward, as the revelation that they all have their presence at it in common provides them with a clue as to the identity of the eighth Chosen Child (who they later discover is Hikari): that they must also have witnessed the battle, and therefore at the time lived in Hikarigaoka.\n\nIn \"Raremon! The Surprise Attack on Tokyo Bay\", during their investigation to identify the eighth Chosen Children, Taichi asks Hikari if she remembers the battle. Unlike the others, she still remembers it perfectly well without needing to have her memory jogged. (Prior to this, in \"Koromon, the Great Clash in Tokyo!\", she had also immediately recognized Taichi's partner Digimon as Koromon when the two briefly returned home; in \"Mammon, the Great Clash at Hikarigaoka!\", Taichi speculates that her memory of the 1995 incident is how she had been able to do so.)\n\nIn \"The Clashing Ultimates! War Greymon VS Metal Garurumon\", it is established that Homeostasis chose the Chosen Children due to the events depicted in this film, and that both \"Koromon\" and Parrotmon survived the battle and were taken back to the Digital World. It also confirms that Taichi and Hikari were, in fact, directly responsible for causing \"Koromon\" to evolve at all, which is the reason that Homeostasis chose them. A holographic recreation of the the aftermath of the battle, showing \"Koromon\" and Parrotmon being taken back to the Digital World, is also shown.\n\nDigimon Adventure: Our War Game! (which was also written and directed by Yoshida Reiko and Hosoda Mamoru) opens with a brief homage to this short film with a non-diegetic shot of a massive Digitama, in the same style as the one that yielded Parrotmon, over the sky of Odaiba while Boléro plays. Once the Digitama hatches, the shot fades to a daytime establishing shot of the same scene, beginning the movie's story.\n\nIn Digimon Adventure 02: Vol. 2: Transcendent Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals, when Wallace is telling the story of how he was separated from Chocomon as a child seven years prior, Motomiya Daisuke comments that seven years prior is around the same time that Taichi had his first encounter with a Digimon, in reference to the events of this short film.\n\nDigimon Adventure 02: Diablomon Strikes Back includes two homages to this film. Armagemon hatches from a giant Digitama in the sky, once again of the exact same style as Parrotmon's, which was formed by the fusion of mass numbers of Kuramon. Following the destruction of Armagemon, the shot from this film in which Taichi blows the whistle to awaken \"Koromon\" is shown as the crowd assembled at Tokyo Bay hears the sound of the whistle.\n\nDigimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna also includes two overt homages to this film as plot points. It begins with a battle in Tokyo (this time in Nakano, not Hikarigaoka) between the adult Chosen Children (including a different Agumon/Greymon) and a Parrotmon who has also appeared suddenly in the Real World. In the climax of the film in Never-Land, Taichi seizes the whistle from Hikari (who has been de-aged to her 8-year-old self from Adventure) and blows it to snap the other Chosen Children out of Menoa Bellucci's influence; during this scene, a recreation of this short film's shot of 7-year-old Taichi blowing the whistle is also shown to highlight the connection.\n\nHome Media Releases[edit]\n\nImage Name ID No. Format RRP Release Date Notes Running Time Picture Track Audio Track Distributor Digimon Adventure\n\n「デジモンアドベンチャー」 VCTM02362[18] VHS ¥2,940[18] December 12, 1999[18] 20 minutes[18] Unknown, Color[19] Stereo sound (Japanese)[19] Toei Video[18] Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!\n\n「デジモンアドベンチャー ぼくらのウォーゲーム!」 DSTD02003[20] DVD ¥4,725 (2000s)[21]\n\n¥2,695 (2020s)[20] January 21, 2001 Compilation release which features Digimon Adventure: Our War Game![20]\n\nBonus Features:[20]\n\nInterviews with Hosoda Mamoru (director) and Seki Hiromi (producer)\n\nMaking-of featurette (a Toei Channel program)\n\nTheatrical preview and TV spot\n\n60 minutes (total)[20] 16:9 (letterboxed), Color[20] Surround sound (Japanese)[20] Toei Video[21] Digimon THE MOVIES Blu-ray 1999-2006\n\n「デジモン THE MOVIES Blu-ray 1999-2006」 BSTD03773[22] Blu-ray Disc ¥27,500[22] January 9, 2015[22]\n\nMain article: Digimon THE MOVIES Blu-ray 1999-2006\n\nIncluded on Disc 1 with Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!\n\n301 minutes (total)[22] 16:9 1080p, Color[22] Disc 1: 1) Linear PCM stereo sound (Japanese)\n\n2) Dolby TrueHD Pseudo-5.1 surround sound (Japanese)[22] Toei Video[22] Digimon THE MOVIES Blu-ray Vol.1\n\n「デジモン THE MOVIES Blu-ray Vol.1」 BSTD03891[23] Blu-ray Disc ¥5,500[23] January 6, 2016[23]\n\nIndividual release of Disc 1 of the Digimon THE MOVIES Blu-ray 1999-2006 boxed set.

SAG argued that The Movie no longer constituted a \"dub\" under the terms of their dubbing agreement with Saban due to the \"significant\" extent of its \"revisions, reformatting, additions, deletions and modifications\", and on those grounds sought remuneration for the English voice cast (who were members of SAG) commensurate with the greater remuneration owed to performers in non-dub productions but not those in dub productions, namely residuals.[26] The outcome of this action is unknown.\n\nAs usual for American English dubbed Digimon productions, the original score—which, with the exception of \"Butter-Fly\" playing over the credits, consists entirely of Maurice Ravel's Boléro—is totally replaced in The Movie. Unlike other dubbed productions, The Movie uses licensed pop songs from the US in addition to the usual score from Saban's dubs of the Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure 02 television series.\n\nNotably, in the original version, Boléro forms part of the film's structure: increases in the song's intensity, tempo, volume and number of instruments coincide with Koromon's growth, significant plot beats, action, and upping of stakes in the film. No attempt is made to replicate its effect in The Movie's score.\n\nAs usual for contemporary American English Digimon dubs, dialog is generally significantly longer-winded, previously nonexistent jokes are often added, and previously nonexistent dialog is often added over what were originally moments of silence.\n\nIn the original version, narration is limited to a framing device at the start and end of the film featuring Yagami Taichi at age eleven. In The Movie, consistent with the other parts of it, Kari Kamiya (Yagami Hikari)—specifically, her eleven-year-old self from Adventure 02—provides narration throughout its duration, often irreverent in tone and explaining in detail what is happening or about to happen.\n\nAs part of Taichi's narration at the start of the original, there is a scene of him at age eleven standing alone in a field. This footage is not repurposed anywhere in The Movie. This scene is interspersed with footage of the \"Koromon\"/Parrotmon fight scene from later in the film; this usage of it is also cut from The Movie, although this has no bearing on the same footage's subsequent usage in the fight scene itself, later in the film.\n\nWhen Kari introduces this part of The Movie, a title card declaring \"Highton View Terrace, Japan - Eight Years Ago\" is superimposed on top of its first shot. This is inconsistent with the timeline established in the original films, in which the total time elapsed between the three films that were turned into The Movie has been affirmed on multiple occasions (including by fellow The Movie constituent film Digimon Adventure 02: Vol. 2: Transcendent Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals) to be seven years.\n\nKari's introductory narration at the start of this part covers characters from all three films used to form The Movie. Footage from the films that form the subsequent parts is reused as she introduces said characters, namely Tai (Taichi), T.K. Takaishi (Takaishi Takeru), and Willis (Wallace).\n\nIn the original version, Hikari's dialog is very limited. Before she and Koromon begin bonding, she only speaks one word, \"Egg\" 「卵」, once, at the very beginning, and is otherwise non-verbal and communicates only through her whistle; she barely says anything to anyone other than Koromon through the entire film, and even then, her lines tend to be short and infrequent. While The Movie preserves the period in which she is still only communicating by whistle and does not add dialog for her during it, it otherwise rewrites Kari to be significantly more verbose (not counting her 11-year-old self's narration), and an extensive amount of dialog is added for her in the Agumon exploration sequence.\n\nA shot of Taichi kneeling on a chair so that he can reach the kitchen counter is cut from The Movie.\n\nThe Movie adds in Tai brainstorming ideas for what to do with the Digi-Egg (Digitama), including using it as a soccer ball and telling others who ask that \"our chicken coop is on a nuclear waste dump!\"\n\nThe Movie cuts 30 seconds from the Digi-Egg chase sequence, including the shot of Taichi almost tripping over it while carrying a chair.\n\nAlthough its footage is mostly unaltered, The Movie radically changes the scene under the Yagami children's bed where Hikari is bonding with Botamon by altering the sound effects.\n\nIn the original, Hikari initiates by blowing her whistle, and Botamon responds by blowing an equal number of bubble blasts to the number of times Hikari blows the whistle.\n\nIn The Movie, Botamon initiates by gurgling a bar from the Saban dub \"Digimon Theme,\" and Kari responds by playing the next bar on her whistle; since the footage is unmodified, Botamon is also still blowing bubbles while doing so.\n\nDuring this scene, there is a shot in which Hikari is tickled by the sensation of Botamon's bubble stream blowing in her face. In the original version, this occurs right after the first time that Hikari does two whistle blasts, in the middle of the scene, before the two continue on for further call-and-response whistling/bubble-blowing. In The Movie, this shot is moved to the very end of the scene under the bed, before it cuts to Tai watching, confused.\n\nIn The Movie, the aftermath of the bubble-blowing interaction is shortened and cuts straight to Kari feeding Botamon. The intervening shots—the bubbles floating around the city, and a B-roll shot of an educational hiragana chart on the bedroom wall—are cut.\n\nIn the original version, when Taichi answers the phone, there is no voice or speech on the other end of it, only the sounds of it malfunctioning due to Botamon evolving at that moment.\n\nIn The Movie, Tai is instead subjected to a tirade from Sora Takenouchi (Takenouchi Sora) about how she has just learned from Mimi Tachikawa (Tachikawa Mimi) that it was Tai who recently vomited in her hat without telling her; this tirade is then cut off by the Botamon-induced malfunction. This incident has no basis whatsoever in the original version, and moreover, in Japanese material in general there is no indication that Taichi, Sora and Mimi knew each other at this point in their lives. The Movie later references this incident again in the \"Four Years Later\" part (Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!), in its heavily rewritten version of Tai's apology email to Sora.\n\nThe Movie cuts some footage from the fight scene between Koromon and Miko (Miiko), partly to reduce the impact of Miko's violence.\n\nThe chase sequence is shortened, including cutting the shot of Koromon trying to get behind the toy basket.\n\nIn the original version, Miiko scratching Taichi is depicted with two shots: an action shot of Miiko's paw rushing at him, and a cut to black where red claw marks are slashed across the screen. In The Movie, it just cuts straight to Tai dropping Miko.\n\nIn the original version, when Miiko then scratches Koromon, it cuts to the aforementioned red claw mark shot again, which has another set of red claw marks slash across the screen. In The Movie, since the former shot never happened in the original sequence, the two-claw-slash black screen shot is cut and the earlier single-claw-slash shot is inserted in its place.\n\nIn the original version, Koromon only speaks in its Koromon form, and as Agumon and Greymon, its vocalizations are limited to realistic roars. In The Movie, it also speaks in its Agumon and Greymon forms, although the added dialog for these forms is not significant and, with one exception, is limited to it shouting its technique names.\n\nThe one exception is that in The Movie, when Tai attempts to address it as \"Koromon\" after it evolves into Greymon, it replies, \"I'm Greymon now.\" (In the original version, it says nothing in the shot in question and merely eyes Taichi.) Because of this, in The Movie, Tai and Kari adapt to calling it \"Greymon\" after this point, whereas in the original version, Taichi and Hikari only ever know the Digimon as \"Koromon\" even after it evolves.\n\nSome B-roll shots of electronic malfunctions, and children around the area observing the malfunctions, during Koromon's evolution are cut from The Movie.\n\nThe character of Yagami Susumu is removed entirely from The Movie. The shots depicting him coming home and attempting to say good night to his children are cut, likely because of his drunkenness, and dialog is amended to present that sequence as if Yagami Yuuko is the only one at risk of coming in and seeing Agumon. (Susumu is still present in the Saban dub of the Adventure television series.)\n\nIn The Movie, some minor footage is trimmed from Kari and \"Koromon\"/Agumon's exploration of Highton View Terrace (Hikarigaoka).\n\nIn the original version, Parrotmon does not speak at all. The Movie adds some minor dialog for it.\n\nIn the original version, Parrotmon does not announce the name of its lightning attack technique, which is called Mjölnir Thunder in other Japanese media. In The Movie, Parrotmon announces the technique as Sonic Destroyer, which is the name of a totally different technique of Parrotmon's, in both Japanese and other English media, that does not involve lightning.\n\nThe Movie cuts the fight between \"Koromon\"/Greymon and Parrotmon in multiple places, both for time and to reduce the intensity of the violence.\n\nThe shot of Greymon's first Mega Flame impacting Parrotmon is trimmed to omit the blast tearing off Parrotmon's wing.\n\nSome shots of both Taichi and Hikari spectating, and other children watching from their balconies, are cut.\n\nThe shot where Greymon's horn shatters Parrotmon's lower beak is cut. No subsequent footage is edited to accommodate for this, so in The Movie, Parrotmon's lower beak suddenly becomes heavily damaged with no explanation.\n\nCompared to Taichi's blowing of the whistle in the original, Tai's blowing of the whistle in The Movie is shorter, and some B-roll of a nearby building as the whistle echoes around is omitted.\n\nDuring the fight scene, when the other six future Chosen Children from the Adventure television series make their cameos watching the fight, there is no indication in the original version that any of them know each other, or Taichi or Hikari, at that time (with the obvious exception of the sibling pair of Ishida Yamato and Takeru, who are together in the film). The Movie changes dialog to try and establish pre-existing connections:\n\nIn the original, Kido Jo does not identify who he is on the phone with in either shot depicting him. In The Movie, Joe's (Jo) dialog in the first shot is rewritten to identify that he is on the phone with Mimi, and in the second shot (in which his phone call is interrupted by \"Koromon\"/Agumon evolving), his dialog is rewritten to instead identify that he is calling Izzy Izumi (Izumi Kōshirō). (In both the original and Saban dub versions of \"Mammon, the Great Clash in Hikarigaoka!\", it is directly pointed out that Jo did not know Kōshirō at all at the time.)\n\nIn the original version, when Sora sees Taichi blowing the whistle, she only says \"That boy...\" In The Movie, her dialog is changed to \"Get 'em, Tai...\" This is the second time that The Movie has established a prior relationship between Tai and Sora, following the hat vomit phone call.\n\nThe Movie takes some minor steps to attempt to distinguish this short film's versions of Agumon and Greymon from the more familiar Digimon species seen in the televised Adventure anime and the rest of The Movie.\n\nThey have different English voice actors: respectively, Michael Sorich and Bob Papenbrook, instead of Tom Fahn and Michael Lindsay. Since neither form speaks in the original version, they never had Japanese voice actors. (Koromon is not affected by this, as it is voiced by the same actor as Tai's partner Koromon in the Adventure series' dub, Brianne Siddall, consistent with how Sakamoto Chika is the Japanese voice of both this film's Koromon and Taichi's partner Koromon in the Adventure series.)\n\nIn the credits, the roles are labeled \"Big Agumon\" and \"Red Greymon,\" although neither name is used in dialog.\n\nTheir attack techniques have slightly different names from what they are usually called in Adventure dubs. Agumon's attack is called Pepper Flame, instead of the usual Pepper Breath (Japanese: Baby Flame); and Greymon's is called Nova Flame, instead of the usual Nova Blast (Japanese: Mega Flame).\n\nThe original film's closing credits are cut entirely, in favor of the combined closing credits of The Movie which run after the Transcendent Evolution!! part. The footage that plays in the background of the original credits—which depicts Taichi, age eleven, bonding with the partner Greymon from the Adventure television series—is not repurposed anywhere (The Movie's credits are played over a black background).\n\nDiscotek Media redub[edit]\n\nAn individual American English dub of the Adventure short film was produced in 2023 for Discotek Media's \"Digimon The Movies Collection 1\" Blu-ray release, along with individual dubs of Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!, Digimon Adventure 02: Vol. 1: Digimon Hurricane Landing!!, and Vol. 2: Transcendent Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals. The new dubs were recorded at Sound Cadence Studios with \"as much of the original cast [of the Saban Entertainment dubs] as possible.\"[25]\n\nThis dub was announced and premiered at a screening event at Otakon 2023.[25]\n\nThe redub retains the original Japanese soundtrack.[27]\n\nWhile uncut, the redub's tone is \"a mix between classic Digimon dubs & a bit more straight.\"[27]\n\nAdditional Information[edit]\n\nReferences Notes\n\n↑ This short film is occasionally referred to as \"Digimon Adventure: The Movie\" 「劇場版デジモンアドベンチャー Gekijōban Dejimon Adobenchā」 by Bandai[1] and Toei Animation,[2] to disambiguate it from the Digimon Adventure television anime series.\n\n↑ The \"Memories of Our Digimon Adventure\" interview booklet that was bundled with Happinet Pictures' Digimon Adventure series DVD box set in 2007 dates the events of the Adventure short film to the spring vacation period of 1995. While the year is not explicitly stated in the text of any subsequent anime production, both the Adventure series (set in 1999, says this film's events happened four years prior[3]) and Digimon Adventure 02: Vol. 2: Transcendent Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals (set in 2002, says this film's events happened seven years prior) indirectly affirm the 1995 setting.\n\n[edit]\n\nDigimon Adventure on the '99 Spring Toei Anime Fair official website (Archived by the Internet Archive Wayback Machine)\n\nDigimon Adventure on the Toei Animation Production Lineup website\n\nDigimon Adventure (film) on Wikipedia"
