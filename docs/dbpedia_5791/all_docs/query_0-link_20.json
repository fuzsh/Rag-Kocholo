        "text": "by Alexis Moyle\n\nYou’re probably familiar with movies like Inception or Black Swan—films that deal with perceptions of reality. But have you ever seen the films of Satoshi Kon?\n\nSatoshi Kon was a famous Japanese director, writer, and animator who unfortunately died at the young age of 46, in 2010. His memory lives on in his visceral anime, and arguably, in many famous Hollywood films. Whether or not the directors of the movies mentioned above were directly influenced by Kon, there is an uncanny resemblance between the films. Here’s two of my recommendations to get you started:\n\nPaprika (2006)\n\nPaprika, Kon’s last film, has a stark resemblance to Christopher Nolan’s Inception; and predates it by 4 years. Paprika is about a new form of psychotherapy that aims to help patients by infiltrating their dreams. The main character, Dr Atsuko Chiba, starts to use the machine which infiltrates dreams (called the DC Mini) to illegally help her patients. She uses her alter ego, Paprika, to enter the dreams. As she stays in the dreams longer, reality and the dreams begin to blur and overlap, causing things from the dreams to enter real life. Because of the movie’s success there was going to be a live-action film. However, when Inception was released, it was nixed.\n\nThere are some scenes in the movie which can be directly compared to scenes in Inception, frame by frame. Some argue that while both Inception and Paprika deal with the topic of dreams and a breakdown in reality, they are substantially different in their approach. Paprika is a surrealist film, which blends reality and dreams together, leaving the viewer unsure of which they are viewing at any given time. Inception is inspired aesthetically by surrealist elements, but at its core, fits primarily into an action/sci-fi category because the viewer has a much clearer understanding of scenes that are based in reality and scenes that happen in dreams.\n\nPaprika breaks into another dream via a mirror.

Pictures, image via The Agony Booth\n\nPerfect Blue (1997)\n\nPerfect Blue follows the story of a young J-pop Idol, Mima Kirigoe, who leaves her pop-star life behind in order to pursue acting. Throughout the film we see Mima wanting to be taken more seriously as an actress and taking on roles that her manager believes will ruin her image. Mima is stalked and threatened throughout the film by a stalker called “Me-Mania” who believes Mima is a traitor for leaving her pop group. Her grip on reality slowly deteriorates throughout the film as she is faced with someone impersonating her online, and is accused of murder.\n\nAlthough Darren Aronofsky, director of Black Swan, agreed there were similarities between his film and Perfect Blue, he denies that Kon’s film had any influence on his. While the plot in Black Swan is different from Perfect Blue, the theme of losing one’s identity and grips on reality ring true in both films. For example, in Black Swan, the prima ballerina, Nina, has a rival, who Nina believes is trying to replace her. We see a similar theme run through Perfect Blue, where Mima is faced with an online impersonator who knows intimate details about her life.\n\nI won’t spoil the ending of Perfect Blue, but it is a psychological thriller worth seeing, with beautiful editing and dark themes.\n\nA doppelganger of Mima enters Mima’s room. Image from Perfect Blue ⓒ Mad House/ Rex Entertainment, via Constantine In Tokyo\n\nWhether or not Nolan or Aronofsky agree that their films were influenced by Kon, the visual evidence is quite convincing. Kon was an influential figure of his time and dealt with complex and dark themes such as loss of innocence, identity, and reality. If you’re interested in psychological thrillers, animation or just good movies, these two are definitely worth watching.\n\nDo you believe Kon was an influence on these Hollywood films? Let us know what you think of Kon’s influence on Hollywood blockbusters in the comments below."
