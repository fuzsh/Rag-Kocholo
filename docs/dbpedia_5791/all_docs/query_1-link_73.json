        "text": "(It pairs very well with our habit of saying “They’re Canadian” every time someone talks about a celebrity who was born or migrated here.)\n\nSo many movies and TV shows are filmed here—especially in the production centres of Vancouver and Toronto—that we’ve earned the nickname Hollywood North. This is attributed to generous government subsidies and a good exchange rate on our dollar; many productions with budget constraints choose Canadian locations.\n\nVancouver benefits from being in the same timezone as LA, and its 60+ visual effects and animation studios make it a global VFX centre. Toronto hosts TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), which is recognized as the second most influential film festival after Cannes.\n\nCanada is home of many top actors (Ryan Gosling, Sandra Oh, Ryan Reynolds, Rachel McAdams, Keanu Reeves, to name a few) and directors (like David Cronenberg, Denis Villeneuve, James Cameron). There is no shortage of “lights, camera, action” here. No wonder we’re proud.\n\nBelow is a list of movies filmed here in Canada. It’s not exhaustive, but there is a huge variety to explore. Find one to watch tonight!\n\nMovies Filmed (Almost) Entirely in Canada\n\nRambo: First Blood\n\nIt’s been 40 years since the release of the first Rambo (1982) action movie, which is about a Vietnam war veteran who travels to visit an old friend, who unfortunately has died. The local sheriff runs him out of town and and manhunt ensues when Rambo tries to return. The story takes place in Hope, Washington, but it was filmed in the small town of Hope in southern British Columbia. The town celebrated the anniversary, even carving a second Rambo statue to mark its legacy.\n\nThe drama The Revenant (2015), for which Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Oscar for Best Actor, tells the true story of a fur trapper who was left for dead after being attacked by a bear. The bear attack scene was shot north of Vancouver near Squamish and Whistler, but the rest of the movie was shot in Alberta…until there wasn’t enough snow and production had to move to the southernmost tip of South America. But other than those four days and one scene that was filmed in Montana, this movie was made in Canada.\n\nThese two new thrillers were filmed in Canada. Trap (2024) is about a serial killer at a pop concert with his teenage daughter, evading the police outside the arena doors. The movie was filmed at the FirstOntario Centre arena in Hamilton, Ontario, which was closed for renovations. The larger Rogers Centre arena in Toronto (home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, not my beloved Vancouver Canucks) provided exterior shots.\n\nFear (1996) is a psychological thriller about the intense and volatile relationship between a teenage girl and a charming but dangerous young man, who becomes increasingly possessive and violent. Set in Seattle, the movie only filmed there for three days. Instead, it was mostly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, including the fairgrounds at the PNE (Pacific National Exhibition). The Walker family’s isolated home was located in Howe Sound, between Vancouver and Squamish.\n\nThese two romantic comedies were both filmed and set in Toronto. The F Word (2013, titled What If in the USA) is about a young man and woman who meet and decide to become friends, despite having a good connection, because the woman already has a boyfriend. Other than a couple scenes in Ireland, the movie is all about Toronto.\n\nSame with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), starring Canadian Michael Cera as the titular character. This movie is about a young man who meets the girl of his dreams but must defeat her exes before they can date, The comic book from which the film is adapted used real Toronto locations, and the film often used these same locations.\n\nScary Movie (2000) parodies the storylines of Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and other classic 1990s teen horror movies. A group of teenagers accidentally hit and kill a man with their car and bury him, then a year later are stalked and killed one-by-one by someone in a Ghostface mask. Much of the movie was filmed in the charming fishing village of Steveston, located south of Vancouver.\n\nThe drama Room (2015) is about a young woman who has been held captive in a single-room dwelling for seven years. After her escape, her son who was born in the Room (played by the young Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay in his breakout role) experiences the outside world for the first time. While much of the film takes place inside the Room, which was built on a Toronto soundstage, the outdoor scenes were filmed in and around Toronto.\n\nSpotlight (2015) tells the story of the Boston Globe’s Pulitzer-winning investigation into allegations of abuse by the Catholic Church. Some of the Boston-centric story was filmed there, at locations such as the Boston Globe offices, Fenway Park, and the Boston Public Library. But most of the movie (starring Canadian Rachel McAdams as one of the journalists) was filmed in the cities of Toronto, where a former Sears building was used for the interior shots of the Boston Globe offices, and Hamilton in Ontario.\n\nThese two rom-coms from the early 2000s were both filmed in Canada. The Oscar-winning Juno (2007), directed by Jason Reitman and starring Michael Cera and fellow Canadian Elliot Page, is about a teenage girl who finds herself pregnant and sets out to find great adoptive parents for the baby. It was filmed in and around Vancouver, which is standing in for Elk River, Minnesota.\n\nJust Friends (2005) is about a successful record executive, played by Ryan Reynolds, who goes to his hometown with his pop star girlfriend over the winter holidays and tries to win the heart of his longtime crush, who rejected him and wanted to be “just friends” in high school. Due to budget constraints, it was filmed in winter in the cities of Regina and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, as well as Los Angeles.\n\nDespite being set in Boston, these two movies were actually filmed in Canada. Good Will Hunting (1997) centres around Will Hunting, a custodian at MIT, whose genius-level intelligence is discovered by a professor. After being arrested for assaulting a police officer, Hunting gets treatment with a therapist in order to receive a more lenient sentence. Due to financial concerns, the drama was filmed in Toronto along with some real Boston locations.\n\nAfter exposure to gamma radiation, a scientist in The Incredible Hulk (2008) transforms into the titular character whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. He goes on the run from the US government after killing several people in his lab due to this condition, and he searches for a cure. Filmed in Toronto and Hamilton in Ontario and Bella Coola in British Columbia, parts of this movie were also filmed in Brazil.\n\nextra: A little bit of Leo in Canada\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is my favourite actor, and lucky for me he has filmed in Canada nearly from coast to coast. In addition to the months he spent in the west filming The Revenant—during which I told my coworkers and friends to call me at any time, day or night, if they spotted Leo around Vancouver—he has also spent some time filming in Quebec.\n\nInception\n\nThis mind-bending thriller is about the act of stealing and implanting corporate secrets through dream-sharing technology. Inception (2010) was filmed all over the world: California, France, United Kingdom, Morocco, Japan, and finally Canada. The winter scenes were filmed at the same closed-down ski resort outside of Calgary as The Revenant. Fun fact: the avalanches filmed there in both movies were real, not CGI.\n\nDid any film on this list surprise you? What’s your favourite filmed-in-Canada movie?
