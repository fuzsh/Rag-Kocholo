        "text": "The typical career trajectory of Japanese film folk with international ambitions is to first succeed at home before venturing abroad. Ken Watanabe established himself as a movie star with the made-in-Japan hit “The Last Samurai” in 2003, and then went on to film “Inception” with Christopher Nolan in 2010.\n\nDirector Takeshi Fukunaga has taken the opposite path."
