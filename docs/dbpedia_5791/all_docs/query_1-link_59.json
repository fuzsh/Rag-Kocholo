        "text": "Acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan directs an international cast in\n\nInception, an original sci-fi actioner that travels around the globe and into the intimate\n\nand infinite world of dreams.\n\nDom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief, the best in the dangerous art of\n\nextraction: stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the\n\ndream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a\n\ncoveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also\n\nmade him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now\n\nCobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back\n\nbut only if he can accomplish the impossibleinception. Instead of the perfect heist,\n\nCobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse; their task is not to steal an\n\nidea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.\n\nBut no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the\n\ndangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb\n\ncould have seen coming.\n\nThis summer, your mind is the scene of the crime.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Legendary Pictures, a\n\nSyncopy Production, a film by Christopher Nolan, Inception.\n\nThe film stars three-time Academy Award® nominee Leonardo DiCaprio (Blood\n\nDiamond, The Aviator), Academy Award® nominee Ken Watanabe (The Last\n\nSamurai), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days of Summer), Oscar® winner Marion\n\nCotillard (La Vie en Rose), Academy Award® nominee Ellen Page (Juno), Tom Hardy\n\n(RocknRolla, Bronson), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), Academy Award® nominee\n\nTom Berenger (Platoon), Dileep Rao (Avatar), and two-time Oscar® winner Michael\n\nCaine (Hannah and Her Sisters, The Cider House Rules).\n\nInception was written and directed by Oscar® nominee Christopher Nolan\n\n(Memento, The Dark Knight), who also produced the film with Emma Thomas. Chris\n\n1\n\nBrigham and Thomas Tull served as executive producers, with Jordan Goldberg coproducing.\n\nNolans behind-the-scenes collaborators included three-time Oscar®-nominated\n\ndirector of photography Wally Pfister (The Dark Knight, The Prestige, Batman\n\nBegins), production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the\n\nCrystal Skull, Elizabeth: The Golden Age), two-time Oscar®-nominated editor Lee\n\nSmith (The Dark Knight, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World),\n\nOscar®-nominated costume designer Jeffrey Kurland (Bullets Over Broadway,\n\nCollateral), and Oscar®-nominated special effects supervisor Chris Corbould (The\n\nDark Knight). The music is by Academy Award®-winning composer Hans Zimmer (The\n\nDark Knight, The Lion King).\n\nConcurrently with the films nationwide theatrical release, Inception: The IMAX\n\nExperience will be released in select IMAX® theatres. Inception will be digitally re-\n\nmastered into the unparalleled image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience®\n\nthrough proprietary IMAX DMR® technology. With crystal clear images, laser-aligned\n\ndigital sound and maximized field of view, IMAX provides the worlds most immersive\n\nmovie experience.\n\nInception has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA for sequences of violence and\n\naction throughout.\n\nwww.inceptionmovie.com 2\n\nABOUT THE PRODUCTION\n\nCOBB\n\nYou create the world of the dream.\n\nYou bring the subject into that dream\n\nand they fill it with their secrets.\n\nDirector/writer/producer Christopher Nolan reveals that he began creating the\n\nworld of Inception almost a decade before he made the movie. About ten years ago, I\n\nbecame fascinated with the subject of dreams, about the relationship of our waking life\n\nto our dreaming life. Ive always found it to be an interesting paradox that everything\n\nwithin a dreamwhether frightening, or happy, or fantasticis being produced by your\n\nown mind as it happens, and what that says about the potential of the imagination is\n\nquite extraordinary. I started thinking how that could be applied to a grand-scale action\n\nmovie with a very human dimension.\n\nInception hinges on the premise that it is possible to share dreams dreams\n\nthat have been designed to look and feel completely real while youre in them. And in\n\nthat subconscious state, a persons deepest and most valuable secrets are there for the\n\ntaking. Nolan elaborates, At the heart of the movie is the notion that an idea is indeed\n\nthe most resilient and powerful parasite. A trace of it will always be there in your\n\nmind somewhere. The thought that someone could master the ability to invade your\n\ndream space, in a very physical sense, and steal an ideano matter how privateis\n\ncompelling.\n\nProducer Emma Thomas agrees, noting that the film had to maintain that\n\nbalance between a thrill ride and an emotional journey. It has elements of a heist\n\nmovie, but one set in a more fantastical framework. It has huge action sequences, but it\n\nalso has characters you truly care about, and there is a real emotional driving force\n\nthroughout the movie.\n\nThat driving force is largely embodied in the central character of Dom Cobb,\n\nplayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. In essence, thats what was immediately engaging to me\n\nabout the script, says the actor. It is this highly entertaining, complex thriller where\n\nanything can happen, but at the heart is one mans quest to uncover a long-buried truth\n\nand to get back home. Its also completely original; I dont think anyone could say\n\ntheyve experienced anything like it before. That combination made me excited about\n\n3\n\nworking on the project, as well as with Chris Nolan. He is an expert at taking this kind of\n\nmulti-layered storyline and making it true and tangible to an audience.\n\nThomas comments, Chris has learned a lot over the years in terms of making\n\nbig movies, and a lot of those things have come into play here. But this film is\n\nsomething very fresh and very different and also quite personal. It gave him a\n\ncompletely clean and pure canvas on which to work.\n\nNolan asserts that the central theme of the story is both personal and universal\n\nbecause we all dream. We all experience the phenomenon of our minds creating a\n\nworld and living in that world at the exact same time. There is also an incredible contrast\n\nin the world of dreamsthey are so intimate and yet they have infinite possibilities in\n\nterms of what we can imagine. So the challenge was to blend the intimacy and emotion\n\nof what might take place in a dream with the massive scope of what our brains can\n\nconceive of. I wanted to create a film that would allow the audience to experience the\n\nlimitless realities that only in dreams can we realize.\n\nWe knew the production of Inception was going to have to be big because of\n\nthe subject matteryou can do anything in a dream, adds Thomas. In fact, the scope\n\nof this film is greater than anything weve done before, even just in terms of the number\n\nof countries in which we shot.\n\nProduction on Inception circled the globe, with principal photography taking\n\nplace in six countries, on four separate continents. Over the course of filming, the cast\n\nand crew experienced a number of extremes, braving the heat of Tangiers in Morocco\n\nand traversing the snows of Calgary, Canada. Shooting also took place in Tokyo, Paris\n\nand Los Angeles, where the effects team generated a driving rain for a multi-vehicle\n\naction sequence, complete with a freight train plowing down the middle of the street.\n\nNolan also returned to the cavernous converted airship hangars at Cardington in\n\nEngland, where he previously filmed sequences for both Batman Begins and The Dark\n\nKnight. Although the actors were not subject to the elements while shooting interiors at\n\nCardington, their equilibrium was challenged by gravity-defying sets that were designed\n\nto revolve a full 360 degrees, and another set constructed on a giant gimbal that put\n\neverything and everyone on tilt.\n\nTo me, the material demanded a very large-scale approach, Nolan attests.\n\nThats why we wound up shooting in six different countries, building enormous sets, and\n\nreally pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved practically, as opposed to\n\ncomputer effects.\n\n4\n\nIts interesting because the human brain is often compared to a computer, the\n\ndirector continues, but the truth is thats a very inadequate analogy because the brain is\n\ncapable of more than well ever know. For a filmmaker, that made it an ideal world to be\n\ndelving into because there are no rules for what the mind can create, and a movie\n\nexploring that had to be the grandest form of entertainment.\n\nSAITO\n\nAssemble your team, Mr. Cobb.\n\nAnd choose your people wisely.\n\nIn addition to filming all over the world, Inception features an international\n\nensemble cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard,\n\nEllen Page, Tom Hardy, Tom Berenger and Dileep Rao, who were all working with Nolan\n\nfor the first time, as well as Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine, who were\n\nreunited with the director.\n\nThomas observes, The movie has some great roles, and the actors really\n\nresponded to the material, which made the casting process very smooth. We felt very\n\nlucky to have such a remarkable level of talent. I think the actors were also inspired by\n\nthe rest of the cast; they wanted to work together and be a part of it.\n\nThey also wanted to work with Christopher Nolan.\n\nEllen Page affirms, I am such a fan of Chriss, so the idea of being a part of this\n\nfilm was very exciting. And I was blown away by the script; it was like nothing I had ever\n\nread. I completely disappeared into it, and when I finished, I was literally sweating. It\n\nwas so conceptually original and so incredibly moving, with a powerful emotional spine\n\nthat one can really connect to. It was phenomenal to work with a filmmaker who is able\n\nto create entire worlds, things youve never seen before, in such an amazing way.\n\nKen Watanabe, who previously teamed with Nolan on Batman Begins, recalls,\n\nWhen Chris called and asked me to join him, it was easy to say yes, because it was a\n\nwonderful opportunity to work with a director I loved working with before. And after I\n\nread it, I was even more pleased. So my heart and my head told me I definitely had to\n\ndo this movie.\n\nI was very excited by the script, and then when Chris told me the other actors\n\ninvolved, I knew it couldnt get any better, says Cillian Murphy, who was in both\n\nBatman Begins and The Dark Knight I think Chriss films are intelligent and hugely\n\nentertaining, and this one fits that bill beautifully.\n\n5\n\nHis mind is so rich, Marion Cotillard says, and thats one reason Chris is such\n\nan extraordinary director and writer. On a movie as imaginative as this, you need a\n\ndirector you can trustsomeone to take your hand and share his visionand I trusted\n\nhim 100 percent. He really inspired me and gave me the keys I needed.\n\nChris is an extremely talented filmmaker, DiCaprio states, adding, I also\n\nappreciated getting to collaborate so closely with such an unbelievable cast. We had\n\nlengthy conversations about our characters, and their individual histories and\n\nrelationships. And Chris definitely encouraged that; he wanted every actor, no matter\n\nhow big or small the part, to have a real sense of our characters and to bring something\n\nto the table to make them our own.\n\nNolan offers, It was fascinating to watch the actors evolve as a group, very much\n\nthe way the characters do in the story. It really brought a richness to their scenes\n\ntogether. As a writer, you hope for that kind of chemistry, but its not until you get on the\n\nset that you see the cast bring out their characters idiosyncrasies and interesting interrelationships.\n\nThats a vital part of any movie, especially a heist movie, and I think these\n\nactors really delivered that.\n\nThe film follows a team of very different people, each with singular skills, who\n\nare brought together to accomplish a very special task, Nolan continues. If any one of\n\nthem fails, it can spell disaster, so each individual is integral to their success. And we\n\nunderstand everything theyre going through because we are on that journey with them.\n\nDOM COBB  THE EXTRACTOR\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio stars as Dom Cobb, a master in the art of extraction. The\n\nactor notes, Cobb has achieved a level of expertise that has made him very well known\n\nin the underground black market of individuals who are able to infiltrate peoples minds\n\nand extract information.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Nolan says, we learn that Cobb is the best\n\nextractor in the game. He is hired by corporations to steal secrets they would otherwise\n\nnever have access to. Its all based on the persistence of an idea, the notion that any\n\nconcept will stay fixed in the subconscious. Its impossible to unlearn something, and\n\nthat forms the basis for what an extractor is able to do in terms of retrieving information.\n\nThe way extraction works is through a process called dream sharing\n\nmanufacturing the world of the dream and bringing the subject into that world, which\n\nfeels completely real as long as they are in it.\n\n6\n\nBut Cobbs rare skills have also resulted in him being a wanted fugitive who can\n\nnever go home. Thomas shares, From the start, we know he is a man with a past that\n\nmakes it impossible for him to go back to America. But his kids are there and that\n\nmotivates him more than anything else. Hes willing to take any risk in his work if it\n\nmeans he can get home to what he loves most.\n\nFor that reason, DiCaprio says that the approach he and Nolan took was that no\n\nmatter how surreal the dream state, everything needed to be grounded in our connection\n\nwith the character; everything had to be emotionally charged. From Cobbs standpoint\n\nthere is something very real at stake, so all of his choices, his reactions, and how he\n\ndeals with the people hes working with is a means to one end: getting back his life.\n\nNolan expounds, Working with Leo early on, we really delved into the emotional\n\nlife of his character. It was very important to him that that be the guiding thread of the\n\nstory, and with it he is able to draw the audience through the complex story in a very\n\nclear fashion. Thats what great actors are able to bring to a project, and Leo made a\n\nmassive contribution to the film. I think he is one of our finest actors and his\n\nperformance in the film is extraordinary.\n\nARTHUR  THE POINT MAN\n\nCobbs longtime and most trusted colleague is Arthur, played by Joseph Gordon-\n\nLevitt. While Cobb is the master planner, Arthur takes care of the details. Gordon-Levitt\n\nasserts, Arthur is the organized one, the one making sure everything is in its right place.\n\nThe way I see it, Cobb is the artist and Arthur is the producer. Hes the one saying,\n\nOkay, you have your vision; now Im going to figure out how to make all the nuts and\n\nbolts work so you can do your thing. But as fastidious and professional as he is, Arthur\n\ndidnt want to apply his organizational skills to being a lawyer or doctor or any of the\n\nthings he could have been because sharing dreams is fascinating. Its not just a job for\n\nhim. I think the technology of dream sharing is something that has inspired him since he\n\nfirst heard about it so, ultimately, its not the money hes doing it for. He wouldnt risk his\n\nlife for a good paycheck. He loves it.\n\nGordon-Levitt discloses that his characters fascination with dreams is something\n\nthey had in common. I consider myself a creative person and dreams are where were\n\nall artists. Everything you do in a dreameverything you see, everything you hear,\n\neveryone you talk tois your creation. Thats evidence of how powerful the creative\n\nmind could be if we were to let it, so it intrigued me to do a movie about dreams. You\n\n7\n\ncould call it a heist film, but I think of it more as a con artist film. I think of our characters\n\nas gentlemen thieves, and I identify with them because they are artists, or actors.\n\nTheyre lying for a living not just lying but manufacturing truth. Theyre creating reality,\n\nand thats what I do, too, he smiles.\n\nJoe is a tremendous actor to work withvery charismatic, extremely dedicated,\n\nand also physically adept, Nolan says. He is a performer who doesnt just find the\n\ninternal life of the character but also projects the physical expression of that through his\n\nmovements and expressions. And thats good because there was definitely a very\n\nphysical component to playing Arthur.\n\nARIADNE  THE ARCHITECT\n\nTo manufacture the world of the dream, one of the most vital members of the\n\nteam is the architect. Ellen Page portrays Ariadne, a brilliant student of architecture,\n\nwho is approached by Cobb for a job, which, Page concedes, isnt necessarily legal, but\n\nshe is propelled by an intellectual curiosity that makes her unable to pull herself away\n\nfrom such a unique opportunity.\n\nThat opportunity is to design and build places that could not exist in reality. Page\n\noffers, When Cobb brings Ariadne into his world, so to speak, she immediately displays\n\na natural ability to think outside the box and broaden her mind enough to facilitate what\n\nhes trying to accomplish. She ends up becoming even more involved in the job as she\n\ndiscovers whats really going on with Cobb and learns about things he cant control. But,\n\ndespite the fears that arise, she wants to try and help him in order for the team to\n\nsucceed.\n\nNolan relates, In writing the script for Inception, it was very important to me that\n\nthere be a conduit for the audiencea character who is being shown this world for the\n\nfirst time and is eager to explore it. Thats how the character of Ariadne was born. It\n\nwas also very important for the audience to see Cobb through Ariadnes eyes and get to\n\nthe core of that character. And when I met with Ellen, she had the perfect combination\n\nof freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years. She is an extraordinary\n\nperformer with incredible creativity and an innate curiosity of her own and, therefore,\n\nnaturally infused Ariadne with those qualities. Ellen was able to balance the emotional\n\nlife of her character with the need for Ariadne to bring the audience in and show them\n\nthe truth.\n\n8\n\nPage says, I was excited that Chris had written an awesome role for a young\n\nwoman who is intelligent and comfortable in her own skin. She is thrust into this\n\ncompletely new environment and unusual situation and deals with it very eloquently.\n\nShe can very much hold her own, especially in a group thats a bit of a boys club, she\n\nlaughs.\n\nEAMES  THE FORGER\n\nUnlike Ariadne, Eames is an old hand at dream sharing and has some history\n\nwith Cobb, whether as allies or possibly even competitors. Tom Hardy plays the role of\n\nEames, who, he notes, possesses surprising skills as a forger and not just on paper.\n\nIn the dream world, Eames can project the image of anyone, so hes actually forging an\n\nidentity in a physical manifestation and can convince another person that hes whomever\n\nthe team needs him to be in order to aid their deception. Whats especially interesting\n\nfor me about these characters is the idea of the antihero, the fact that what they are\n\ndoing could be considered dishonorable, but you still root for them. Thats nice because\n\nits not just black and white; we have a lot of gray area to play in.\n\nNolan says that, like his character, Hardy is something of a chameleon. Tom is\n\nan actor who can absolutely jump into the skin of a character and inhabit a role, and he\n\ndid that very effectively with Eames. He saw the potential of the character right away\n\nand brought a wonderfully cheeky quality to his performance, which I was delighted to\n\nsee come through.\n\nEmma Thomas adds that there was also some comic relief in the banter played\n\nout by Hardy and Gordon-Levitt. There is a fun dynamic between Eames and Arthur in\n\nthe movie. Clearly, they have a rivalry that dates back before our story begins, but they\n\nalso have a grudging admiration, even if theyd never admit it. They are a pretty funny\n\nduo to watch as the heist unfolds.\n\nMAL  THE SHADE\n\nMal, played by Marion Cotillard, is the love of Cobbs life. Mal is a tricky one to\n\ndescribe because she is a mix of so many things, the actress says cryptically. But\n\nmaybe its the kind of thing you dont describe because different people can have\n\ndifferent interpretations.\n\nMal is the essence of the femme fatale, states Nolan. Marion brought an\n\nexceptionally haunting quality to her performance. What she was able to do with just her\n\n9\n\neyes and her emotional openness is quite beautiful. And she and Leo together portray\n\nan incredibly moving couple. Underneath all of the action, I think Inception is very\n\nmuch founded on a love story, and these two actors found the truth of that in a most\n\nremarkable way.\n\nLeo is such a gifted actor. I have always been a great fan of his work, so it was\n\namazing to work with him, Cotillard says. His commitment is total and his intensity is\n\nunlimited. You can see it in his eyes. When you share a scene with him, you can trust\n\neverything he does because hes so authentic.\n\nDiCaprio has equal praise for his co-star. It was wonderful to act alongside\n\nMarion. She can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the\n\nsame moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character.\n\nSAITO  THE TOURIST\n\nKen Watanabe portrays the role of Saito, a rich and powerful business magnate,\n\nwho offers Cobb a very special job with a promise of payment more valuable than\n\nmoney. Simply put, if Cobb can give Saito what he wants, Saito will get Cobb home.\n\nThere is only one condition: Saito wants to accompany Cobbs team on the job to be\n\nsure he gets what hes paying for. Thomas says, We refer to him as the tourist\n\nbecause he has no expertise, but uses his financial influence to join the group.\n\nWatanabe observes, At first, its only a business relationship, but as the story\n\ncontinues, Saito and Cobb develop an understanding and a respect. They need each\n\nother.\n\nNolan says that he created the role of Saito with Watanabe in mind. I wrote the\n\npart specifically for Ken because I wanted to work with him again. I enjoyed directing\n\nhim so much on Batman Begins, but his role was smaller and we didnt have a lot of\n\ntime together. This time I made sure he had a bigger part. Ken is an extremely\n\ncharismatic performer, a true movie star. He is a consummate actor who knows how to\n\nget the most out of every scene. Its just a pleasure to watch him work.\n\nROBERT FISCHER  THE MARK\n\nThe target of Saitos business proposition is Robert Fischer, who is about to\n\ninherit control of his dying fathers multibillion-dollar empire. Cillian Murphy, who plays\n\nthe part of Fischer, points out, Despite his vast wealth, Robert is riddled with all sorts of\n\ninsecurities, as one might expect of someone who has lived his entire life in the shadow\n\n10\n\nof a hugely powerful individual. It doesnt help that he has a very strained relationship\n\nwith his father. So here you have a person who is about to inherit the world and is\n\nlacking for nothing except, perhaps, the thing he wants most: a proper relationship with\n\nhis father.\n\nThomas comments, We were so happy to work with Cillian again. Hes a\n\nfantastic actor and he brought so much to his role. I think the character of Robert\n\nFischer is especially interesting, because in a heist movie the mark isnt always so\n\nmultifaceted. But Robert becomes a very large part of the storys emotional heart and a\n\ngreat deal of that is found in Cillians performance.\n\nYUSUF  THE CHEMIST\n\nOne of the keys to carrying out Cobbs operation is the use of a drug compound\n\nthat enables multiple people to share different dream states. Dileep Rao appears as a\n\nchemist named Yusuf whom the actor describes as an avant-garde pharmacologist,\n\nwho is a resource for people, like Cobb, who want to do this work unsupervised,\n\nunregistered and unapproved of by anyone. Yusuf obviously has a monetary interest in\n\nhelping Cobb, but he is also motivated by a burning curiosity. He has been\n\nexperimenting with this stuff for so long and now he wants to see what its like.\n\nThe role of the chemist was particularly tough because you dont want him to\n\nseem like some kind of drug dealer. Hes absolutely not, says co-producer Jordan\n\nGoldberg. Hes someone who is committed to the art of dream sharing and making it\n\nwork in ways it hasnt before. We needed Yusuf to be funny and interesting and\n\nobviously smart, and Dileep is all of those things.\n\nCompleting the main cast of Inception is a trio of veteran actors who each play\n\nsomething of a paternal role to two of the characters. Pete Postlethwaite is seen as\n\nRoberts dying father, Maurice Fischer, while Tom Berenger takes on the part of Peter\n\nBrowning, who is Maurices longtime legal counsel, as well as Roberts godfather. In\n\nfact, Berenger calls Browning more of a surrogate father to Robert, emphasizing,\n\nRobert even calls my character Uncle Peter because Browning has been with him his\n\nwhole life and has probably spent more quality time with him than his own father.\n\nMichael Caine appears as Cobbs father-in-law, Miles, who played a pivotal role\n\nin the younger mans life. Miles is a professor who taught Cobb about dream sharing,\n\nCaine reveals. Cobb ended up going against his advice and Miles doesnt necessarily\n\n11\n\napprove of what hes done with that knowledge. But he still cares about him and worries\n\nabout him all the time.\n\nDespite his disapproval, Miles also introduces Cobb to his most promising\n\nstudent, Ariadne. He wants to help Cobb come home, says Caine, so, being a great\n\njudge of character, Miles makes an educated guess that she is the right one for the job\n\nand hopes for the best.\n\nCaine counts Inception as his fourth film with Nolan, following Batman Begins,\n\nThe Prestige and The Dark Knight. Nolan says, Its always good to have Sir Michael\n\nCaine in your film, and he was gracious enough to do this role for us. Its a joy to have\n\nhim on set.\n\nAs Michael says, he is our good luck charm, Thomas smiles. I dont think we\n\ncould make a film without him at this point.\n\nEAMES\n\nYou mustnt be afraid to\n\ndream a little bigger, darling.\n\nBehind the camera, Nolan assembled a group of artists and artisans to help him\n\nrealize his vision of Inception, a process he suggests is not far removed from the work\n\nof Cobb and his team. There are definite similarities between the way these characters\n\ncreate an entire world for someone to exist in and the way that filmmakers construct a\n\nreality for an audience, the director asserts. So, just as the character of Cobb puts\n\ntogether this extraordinary team of people, I wanted to do that behind the scenes.\n\nThe production of Inception reunited Nolan with several of his previous\n\ncollaborators, including director of photography Wally Pfister, editor Lee Smith, special\n\neffects supervisor Chris Corbould, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, and stunt\n\ncoordinator Tom Struthers. In addition, Nolan worked for the first time with production\n\ndesigner Guy Hendrix Dyas and costume designer Jeffrey Kurland.\n\nNotwithstanding some of the more illusory sequences in the film, Nolan, as is one\n\nof his trademarks, called upon his entire crew to accomplish whatever was attainable in\n\npractical terms, keeping CGI effects to a minimum. Its always very important to me to\n\ndo as much as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very\n\nuseful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically. Regardless of the fact\n\nthat the story deals with different dream states, it is crucial that, at every level, the world\n\nfeels concrete because when we are in a dream, we accept it as reality. So whether we\n\n12\n\nwere filming a ski chase down a mountain, or going underwater, or simulating zero\n\ngravity, I always wanted to go to the absolute limit of what was possible to shoot, the\n\ndirector states.\n\nNot to say that the visual effects department wasnt critical to the production.\n\nNolan affirms, I was confident that Chris Corbould and his special effects unit could\n\nfigure out a way to run a train down the middle of the road in Los Angeles, but I knew it\n\nwasnt feasible to fold a Paris street onto itself without the help of Paul Franklins group.\n\nI love watching my team react with a little bit of panic when I first present them\n\nwith what Im thinking, Nolan admits, laughing. But its astounding to watch the various\n\ndepartments break it down and then come up with inventive approaches to get it done.\n\nAnd at every stage of Inception, everyone delivered in extraordinary ways.\n\nEven when they feign horror, Thomas teases, I think they all truly enjoy solving\n\nwhatever problem Chris throws at them, but they also appreciate that he is challenging\n\nhimself along with them and hell be right with them in the thick of things.\n\nFurther augmenting the sense of realism, a large portion of the films principal\n\nphotography was completed on location. It is vital that, even when the characters are in\n\na dream landscape, it doesnt feel like they are in a computer-generated world, says\n\nexecutive producer Chris Brigham, who served as the on-set line producer. I think it\n\nadds so much texture and believability to the storytelling that the action is taking place in\n\nreal surroundings.\n\nFilming on Inception took the cast and crew from a skyscraper in Tokyo to a\n\nmountain in Calgary, from the exotic roads of Tangiers to the picturesque streets of\n\nParis, and from historic London to modern Los Angeles.\n\nThomas says that, as beneficial as it was, having such a global footprint was\n\none of our biggest challenges. Traveling to six different countries meant we also had to\n\nhave different production crews in each place. It went great, but it was daunting.\n\nDOM COBB\n\nA single idea from the human mind\n\ncan build cities. An idea can transform\n\nthe world and rewrite all the rules.\n\nTOKYO\n\nThe earliest filming was done in Tokyo, where Saito makes his unusual business\n\nproposition to Cobb and Arthur, setting the story in motion. Opening on a skyscraper\n\n13\n\nheliport, the scene transitions to aerial shots from Saitos helicopter. Although that\n\nseemed fairly straightforward, Brigham contends, It was actually somewhat complicated\n\nbecause Tokyo has very strict rules about where and how high helicopters can go. But it\n\nhelped that we had a lot of cooperation from the local officials, who were terrific.\n\nChris has wanted to film in Tokyo for a long time so we appreciated the\n\nopportunity, says Thomas. We love the city; its such a sprawling, vibrant place and\n\nChris really wanted to capture that on film.\n\nENGLAND\n\nProduction then moved to one of Nolans favorite bases of operation: Cardington,\n\na converted airship hangar, north of London. There, the mammoth stage could\n\naccommodate the sizeable yet intricate sets that would test everyones perception of up,\n\ndown and sideways.\n\nOne of the most complicated sets was a long hotel corridor that was able to\n\nrotate a full 360 degrees to create the effect of zero gravity. Designing and building it\n\nrequired a partnership between production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas, special effects\n\nsupervisor Chris Corbould, and cinematographer Wally Pfister.\n\nThe filmmakers originally envisioned the hallway at 40-feet long, but as the plan\n\nof action grew, so did the sets length, ending up at 100 feet. The corridor was\n\nsuspended along eight massive concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside\n\nits walls and powered by two giant electric motors. Ive built revolving sets before,\n\nCorbould offers, but nothing as big or as fast. Once the set was up and runningor\n\nrather turningit could spin up to eight revolutions per minute.\n\nCorbould also worked closely with Pfister to determine how to place cameras in\n\nthe revolving set. I prefer handheld cameras, but it turns out I couldnt hold the camera\n\nwhile rolling upside down, Pfister deadpans. So Chris Corbould and Bob Hall, from my\n\ndepartment, devised a way to mount a remote control camera on a plate that ran on a\n\ntrack underneath the floor.\n\nSince the entire length and breadth of the corridor were often going to be in\n\ncamera range, Pfister could not have traditional movie lights hanging from the ceiling.\n\nInstead, he says, We came up with a practical lighting scheme using sconces and\n\npendant lights that were on dimmers, which gave me a lot of flexibility.\n\n14\n\nApart from the corridor, there was also a revolving hotel bedroom set, which had\n\nits own challenges. Corbould explains, The room set was smaller lengthwise, but there\n\nwere only two rings, so there was a lot more weight on each ring.\n\nIn designing the inside of the hotel sets, Dyas and his department had to bear in\n\nmind that there would be actors and stunt people working along every surface. It\n\nbecame very apparent to me that if we were going to be bouncing people around the set,\n\nit needed to be made of soft materials, Dyas says. Fortunately, there are\n\ncontemporary hotels that use leather and fabric to dress the walls, so we incorporated\n\nthose soft finishes with padding underneath. We also had to make sure that objects like\n\ndoor handles and light fixtures would break on impact so no one would be hurt.\n\nThat was good news to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and members of the stunt team,\n\nwho spent a good deal of time negotiating the dizzying set for a major action sequence.\n\nPrior to filming those scenes, Gordon-Levitt spent weeks in training and rehearsing the\n\naction with stunt coordinator Tom Struthers and his team. Struthers says, Normally, we\n\nwould have to use a double for this kind of work, because when a set is revolving like\n\nthat it can throw you around like a washing machine and be pretty disorienting. But Joe\n\nwas strong and flexible, and we trained him to develop his upper body and core\n\nmuscles. He worked really hard and did exceptionally well.\n\nI definitely got in better physical shape than Ive ever been in my life, Gordon-\n\nLevitt states. I had to be fit enough to pull it off, and I also had to learn to keep my\n\nbalance and carry out a fight scene while jumping from surface to surface. In order to\n\nget it done, I couldnt think of the floor being the floor and the ceiling being the ceiling. I\n\nhad to think of it like, This is the ground. Okay, now this is the ground. And now, this is\n\nthe ground. It was just that the ground was always moving under me. That was the\n\nmind game I had to play to make it work. That was also the most fun because no one\n\nelse was controlling me; it was up to me to keep my balance. But the wires were a\n\ndifferent story, he adds, referring to other gravity-defying shots.\n\nThere were actually two versions of the corridor set erected at Cardington: one\n\nthat rotated; and a duplicate hallway that was built vertically, so that its length became its\n\nheight, so to speak. Gordon-Levitt had to wear a harness and wire for the scenes done\n\nin the vertical corridor, as well as in the hotel room set where he had to maneuver in\n\nmid-air. Gravity and I went head-to-head a lot in this movie, the actor kids. But I loved\n\nit. I got to fly, whichI dont think Im alone in sayinghas always been a dream of\n\nmine.\n\n15\n\nNolan states, I was delighted that Joe wanted to do it all on his own, once it\n\nbecame evident that his skill was such that he could do it safely. It was a huge\n\nadvantage in fusing the action with the character because with every punch, every kick,\n\nevery bit of action, its all Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur.\n\nI think a big part of why Christopher Nolan is so successful is that he strikes a\n\nreally encouraging balance between having everything thought out and being open to\n\nspontaneity, Gordon-Levitt remarks. I saw it every day when, in the midst of these\n\ngargantuan technical feats, he made sure to leave space for the actors to be creative\n\nand prioritize their performances.\n\nSimulating zero gravity also influenced the work of costume designer Jeffrey\n\nKurland and his department. Kurland notes, The clothes in those scenes could not be\n\nhanging down because, without gravity, they would be floating. We had to do things like\n\nwire shoelaces to make sure they were standing straight out and tack down the mens\n\nties so they didnt flop around at random.\n\nLike the vertical corridor, the set for the hotels elevator shaft also defied\n\nconvention. Utilizing Cardingtons existing infrastructure, the crew built the elevator\n\nchute horizontally along one uninterrupted wall of the hangar. Pfister then oriented the\n\ncamera so the elevator looks like it is moving up and down. To complete the illusion, the\n\nelevator cables had to be kept taut with absolutely no slack.\n\nPutting everyone even more off-kilter, Corbould and Dyas masterminded a hotel\n\nbar set on a gigantic gimbal that enabled the entire room to tilt and then slowly right\n\nitself. Corbould says, Ive done many gimbal sets where you see everything shaking\n\nand its mayhem. This was quite different because as the whole rig was tilting, all youre\n\nseeing are the angle of the drinks and the hanging lamps moving in unison. It really\n\nachieved the surreal effect Chris (Nolan) was looking for.\n\nDyas adds, It was quite a large structure to tilt fully. In simple terms, it was\n\nbasically a seesaw controlled by two pistons that could be raised and lowered to get the\n\nplatform to slant. I believe the entire set tilted to approximately 20 degrees, which\n\ndoesnt sound like much until you try to stand on it.\n\nDiCaprio attests, In the scene, Cillian and I had to carry on an intense\n\nconversation while the entire set was tilting. We had to hold on so we didnt slide off, but\n\nwe couldnt react to it in the way you normally would; we just had to focus. It really does\n\nsomething to your perspective.\n\n16\n\nIn addition to filming at Cardington, the company also used several locations in\n\nand around London, including: the Flaxman Gallery at the University College London,\n\nwhere Miles introduces Cobb to Ariadne; the Victorian-era Farmiloe Building, where they\n\ncreated Yusufs pharmacy; and the modern steel and glass lobby of a former gaming\n\ncompany, where Arthur demonstrates the paradox of the Penrose steps to Ariadne.\n\nDyas says, We designed the staircase in the same style as the existing stairs in the\n\nfacility, so it looks as if it was part of the background.\n\nPARIS\n\nLeaving England, the production relocated to France, where the scenes included\n\na pivotal conversation between Cobb and Ariadne at a Paris bistro. The spot was\n\nactually a small bakery, which Dyas and the art department turned into a quaint sidewalk\n\ncafé. At a specific moment the entire area literally blows apart. Filming the explosion\n\ninvolved the close collaboration of Corbould, Pfister and Paul Franklin.\n\nOne obstacle was that the local authorities in Paris do not allow the use of actual\n\nexplosives, no matter how controlled. Instead, Corboulds department used high-\n\npressure nitrogen to create the effect of a series of blasts that blow up the surrounding\n\nshops and stands and, finally, the café itself.\n\nCorbould says, We knew Leo and Ellen were going to be in the middle of the\n\nexplosions, so we made everything out of very lightweight materials. Still, we did weeks\n\nof testing before I felt totally comfortable with it. And on the day we shot the scene, it\n\nwas like the two of them were in their own safety zone; even the paper cup on their table\n\ndidnt move. It was a great shot.\n\nTo ensure that they got the shot, Pfisters team employed six cameras to capture\n\nthe sequence from different angles. They also filmed it at the highest possible frame\n\nrate because, the cinematographer explains, Chris Nolan wanted the explosions at the\n\nmost extreme slow motion we could get, given the outdoor lightingabout 1,000 frames\n\nper second, more than 40 times the normal speed of 24 frames per second. In general,\n\nChris has never been a fan of slow motion, but there are scenes in this film that\n\ndemanded it.\n\nThe super slow motion made the debris appear to momentarily hang in mid-air.\n\nFranklins visual effects department then augmented the sequence. We painstakingly\n\nadded more destruction and flying debrisin particular the bits of masonry, glass, and\n\n17\n\nother objects that would have made it too dangerous for the people in and around the\n\nscene at the Paris location, Franklin details.\n\nVisual effects were also integral to completing other critical sequences where\n\nAriadne begins to discover the infinite possibilities of building the world of the dream,\n\nincluding a scene on the banks of the River Seine where Ariadne recreates the landmark\n\nbridge called Pont du Bir-Hakeim.\n\nTANGIERS\n\nBy far, the most exotic milieu for the Inception cast and crew was Tangiers,\n\nMorocco. The coastal city doubled for Mombassa, where Cobb tracks down the best\n\nforger in the business, Eames, who, in turn, introduces Cobb to the pioneering chemist\n\nnamed Yusuf.\n\nThe Inception cast and crew arrived in Tangiers in early August, when the first\n\nthing that confronted them was the unrelenting summer heat. Nevertheless, Chris\n\nBrigham comments, The great thing about Morocco is that there have been a number of\n\nbig films shot there, and they have a talented local crew. Any time you are on location\n\nwhere they have experience with large productions and the people are comfortable\n\nhaving filming going on around them, its a big advantage.\n\nMorocco is very inspiring from a visual standpoint, adds Pfister. The\n\narchitecture is so completely different, with wonderful streets and corridors that gave us\n\na fantastic canvas to play with. It really is a feast for the eyes.\n\nNolan says he has reason to trust the cinematographers instincts. Ive worked\n\nwith Wally on a number of films now, and he has an extraordinary eye. He is also\n\nalways motivated by the concerns of the story and not just the look of the film. That\n\nmakes him a tremendous creative ally in determining how we progress from one shot to\n\nthe next to advance the audiences immersion in the world of the film.\n\nOne progressiona pulse-pounding foot chasewas shot along the narrow\n\nstreets and alleyways of Tangiers historic Grand Souk. Jordan Goldberg relates, Cobb\n\nis trying to get away from people who are trying to catch or maybe kill him. It was\n\nprobably a hundred degrees that day and, take after take, Leo was running full tilt. He\n\ncommitted himself completely and made it feel incredibly real.\n\nTo capture the pursuit, Pfister says that he and Nolan engaged in what he calls\n\na kind of guerilla filmmaking. Chris loves that style of shooting and so do I. There are\n\ncertain scenes where it applies more than others, and the chase was definitely one, so\n\n18\n\nwe used a combination of methods: we jumped on the back of an ATV with a handheld\n\ncamera and flew through the streets with Leo running behind the vehicle; we did a bit of\n\nSteadicam work; we had wide overhead shots; and I did some shooting on foot, running\n\nbackwards with a camera on my shoulder trying to keep everything in frame.\n\nAmong the other scenes filmed in Morocco was a riot that was shot in the middle\n\nof the main market of Tangiers. The uprising was staged in three sections, with a mix of\n\nstunt people, members of Chris Corboulds effects unit, and many local extras. They\n\npretty much wrecked everything in sight, but it was all done safely and it looked perfect,\n\nStruthers says.\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nCrossing the Atlantic, filming on Inception proceeded in the Los Angeles area,\n\nwhere some sets were constructed on a Warner Bros. soundstage, including the interior\n\nrooms of Saitos Japanese-style castle. Perhaps the most striking set was the\n\nmagnificent dining room with its golden-hued, patterned walls and its ceiling covered in\n\ndozens of lamps. Guy Hendrix Dyas notes, The walls of the dining room are based on\n\na theme of pines and hawks, which was inspired by the Nijo Castle, built around 1603.\n\nBut the sets were not intended to be any kind of historical reproduction; they also include\n\nother types of Japanese architecture, as well as Western influences. They are an\n\namalgamation of different styles to give more of a general sense of Japanese culture\n\nrather than anything specific.\n\nAnother design element that was influenced by Japanese culture is the tuxedo\n\nJeffrey Kurland created for Saito. Ken Watanabe says, With the tuxedo, Jeffrey wanted\n\nto evoke the feeling of a Japanese kimono, so he combined Eastern and Western\n\nfashion in a very interesting way. All of the suits he made for me had a very beautiful\n\nsilhouette.\n\nThomas states, Jeffrey Kurland did an amazing job with the costumes on this\n\nfilm. Nothing came from the store; every item of clothing was designed as an extension\n\nof the particular character who wore itfrom Arthurs conservative, tailored suits and\n\ndress shoes to Eames more flashy wardrobe. I especially loved what Jeffrey did with\n\nMals costumes, like the gorgeous, flowing gown we first see her in. She is the femme\n\nfatale and her wardrobe reflects that.\n\n19\n\nThe Japanese castle sets also included a dramatic two-level great room with a\n\nbeamed ceiling, large picture windows, and solid wood staircases going up to the\n\noverlooking landings.\n\nCorbould reflects, It was a beautiful set. You know, I often feel sorry for\n\nproduction designers because they build these really fantastic sets and, nine times out\n\nof ten, we end up destroying them, he grins.\n\nThat was our running joke, Dyas replies. My people go to great lengths to\n\nmeticulously build these beautiful set pieces and then Chris comes in and blows\n\neverything up. He did it to us again in Calgary but he does it so well, how can I\n\ncomplain?\n\nTrue to form, Corboulds team, including special effects coordinator Scott Fisher,\n\nrigged the castle set to collapse, culminating in torrents of water smashing through the\n\npicture windows. To flood the set, they used pressurized water jets, 12 on each side.\n\nCorbould explains, We triggered them sequentially so we had a progression of water\n\ncoming from the back of the room to the front.\n\nThe special effects group produced another kind of downpour for a thrilling multi-\n\nvehicle car chase staged on the streets of downtown Los Angeles. To generate the\n\ndrenching rain, the team rigged spray heads from the tops of the surrounding buildings.\n\nIt was definitely more than a drizzle, Corbould says. Everybody on the set was getting\n\nsoaked all day long, including Chris, who was right there in the middle of it. He set the\n\nexample for the whole crew.\n\nEmma Thomas attests, Chriss philosophy is that if hes asking the actors and\n\ncrew to do something, he should have to do it, too.\n\nThe main problem with filming the rainstorm in Los Angeles was that it was\n\ntypically sunny without a cloud in the sky, which posed certain lighting issues. After\n\nweeks of praying for it to be overcast, Pfister jokes, I finally gave up on that and started\n\ndoing my homework to figure out how to shoot around the sunlight. I had great help\n\nfrom my fantastic key grip, Ray Garcia, who actually plotted the course of the sun for\n\nthat day and thenusing cherry pickers and guys on rooftopsset up a series of black\n\nflags that acted as louvers to block out the sun as we moved. It was incredibly efficient.\n\nThe rain was not the only incongruous thing in downtown Los Angeles that day.\n\nNolan and his crew also brought a freight train down the middle of the street. The\n\ndirector says, The sequence with the train was a particular element that was important\n\nto get right because its a surreal image, but you want it to feel real. So it was a question\n\n20\n\nof balancing the peculiar nature of a train running down a city street with the reality of it\n\nsmashing into cars and the like. It is the kind of grand scale physical effect that I think\n\ncan take an action film to the next level and make it jaw-dropping for the audience. No\n\nmatter how big the action is, it has to be based on things people can relate to. Then you\n\njust have to exaggerate it about a thousand times, he laughs.\n\nBeing miles from the nearest train tracks, it was obviously not feasible to drive an\n\nactual train down the street, so Tom Struthers came up with the idea of configuring a\n\ntrain engine on the chassis of a tractor trailer. However, the largest wheelbase they\n\ncould find was still too short. Picture car coordinator Tyler Gaisford says, We stretched\n\nthe frame and drive train and then added a steel decking and bolstered the suspension\n\nto hold the extra weight, which ended up being about 25,000 pounds.\n\nThe train was crafted as a replica of an actual freight train. Dyas says, Parts of\n\nour train were manufactured from fiberglass molds taken from real train parts so that\n\neverything had the correct look and texture. Then it had to be matched in terms of color\n\nand design.\n\nBuilding the train was one thing, driving it was quite another. Gaisford clarifies,\n\nAny time you have a vehicle thats 60 feet long, about 10 feet wide and 14 feet tall,\n\nyoure going to have problems with handling, and the turning radius was notably absent.\n\nAlso the driver had very little visibility because we built the structure around the cab, so\n\nwe ended up putting little screens inside and we had cameras, front and back and on\n\neither side, which the driver could use to navigate.\n\nThat driver was Jim Wilkey, the same person who drove the truck that did the\n\nfamous flip in The Dark Knight. Hes just the best, Struthers puts it simply.\n\nAnother, more traditional, vehicle that becomes a centerpiece of the story is a\n\nwhite van that carries the main cast through some harrowing action sequences.\n\nGaisford specifies, There were actually 13 vans used over the course of production, and\n\na lot of work went into modifying each one, based on how we were utilizing itwhether\n\nfor interior or exterior shots, underwater, or in the rollover scene.\n\nThe van used for the rollover was mounted on a rig that allowed it to rotate with\n\nthe actors strapped inside. Struthers reveals, They all had five-point harnesses under\n\ntheir costumes, like a NASCAR driver, so it was safe and comfortable. And they were all\n\nvery game: after one time around, they were all ready to go again.\n\nEllen Page confirms, All the stunts I got to do on this film were an absolute blast.\n\nI love that stuff. As we were filming, I kept thinking that I couldnt wait to see it all come\n\n21\n\ntogether because I think its going to be really exciting, and I hope people go and enjoy\n\nthe ride as much as I did.\n\nOne of the vans was also specially prepared to go under water. We removed\n\nthe engine, drive train, and all liquids, and then steam cleaned it inside and out to\n\neliminate any contaminants because of environmental considerations, says Gaither.\n\nOther Los Angeles locations included a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles,\n\nwhich became Cobbs teams Paris workshop; the water tank at Universal Studios; the\n\nharbor in San Pedro; and an area in Palos Verdes, where they built parts of the exterior\n\nof Saitos castle.\n\nCALGARY\n\nMoving to Calgary, Canada, the final leg of principal photography took place on a\n\nmountain near Banff. The location manager had discovered a ski resort called Fortress\n\nMountain, which had been closed down. The fact that it had accessibility but was not\n\nopen to the public made it an ideal filming location.\n\nThe majestic mountains also provided a breathtaking landscape in more ways\n\nthan one. Dyas recalls, During scouting, we sped around on snowmobiles and the air\n\nkept getting thinner and thinner. At one point, the guides told us, You need to be\n\nseasoned skiers or mountaineers to go further up to the higher peaks. They didnt know\n\nit, but that was like throwing gasoline on a fire, he teases. The moment the words left\n\nthat guys lips, I thought, Oh no. Why did you have to say that? Immediately, Chris\n\nwas like Shackleton: Right! Off to the next peak! It was hilarious. We went as high as\n\nwe could go within the safety confines of Fortress Mountain, but it was important to Chris\n\nbecause he wanted that spectacular natural backdrop.\n\nSeveral months before filming on Fortress Mountain commenced, the crew\n\nbegan erecting an austere multi-level structure, which had the imposing appearance of\n\nan actual fortress. The frigid temperatures hampered the crews efforts because the\n\nmoment the paint left the tin, it was already frozen solid, Dyas says. They had to\n\ndevise a kind of lean-to that allowed them to heat an area long enough to paint it. Then\n\nthey kept moving it as they went.\n\nBecause of the location constraints, it was also impossible to use conventional\n\nconstruction vehicles. Without access to heavy machinery, the crew had to build the\n\nentire structure almost entirely by hand. Additionally, despite its outward appearance,\n\nthere was absolutely no concrete used to make the fortress. Instead, it was fabricated\n\n22\n\nout of untreated spruce to ensure that there would not be any lasting impact on the\n\nenvironment.\n\nOnce the set was built, there was only one thing missing. Thomas shares,\n\nAbout a week before we were leaving for Canada to film an enormous snow sequence,\n\nthere was still no snow. Chris had come up with some contingency plans of what we\n\nmight do if we didnt have proper snow, but nothing would have been as good as the real\n\nthing. Then about two days before we arrived, it started to snow. So we felt very lucky.\n\nBut be careful what you wish for because, from that moment on, it didnt stop.\n\nIn addition to the snow, high winds whipped across the terrain, sometimes\n\ncausing whiteout conditions. Nevertheless, the filmmakers used the prevailing\n\natmosphere to their advantage. Pfister states, When there were adverse conditions, the\n\nonly thing to do was to embrace them. We made it part of the photography.\n\nNolan agrees, It was unbelievably cold and we were often shooting in a virtual\n\nblizzard, but I think what that adds to a scene is incalculable. Just being out there in the\n\nreal conditions adds veracity to everything you do.\n\nMany of the action sequences in Calgary were accomplished on skis, which\n\nmeant the actors had to be able to navigate the slopes to some degree. Tom Hardy\n\nremembers, Chris asked me if I could ski and, for a moment, I was tempted to say yes,\n\nas any actor would in the situation: So, Tom, can you ride a horse? Absolutely. Can\n\nyou fly a plane? Yes, certainly. Do you ski? Oh, professionally, he laughs. But I\n\ndidnt say that, because I knew I couldnt ski to save my life and I would be found out as\n\nsoon as we hit the slopes.\n\nNolan confirms, Tom never actually told me he could ski. But when I asked him\n\nif he knew how to ski, there was that very telling long pause where you realize\n\nsomeones deciding whether or not to tell you if they can ski which I took to mean no.\n\nHowever, he got up to Canada in advance of us and took some intensive skiing lessons.\n\nHe wound up being pretty good, which was helpful on camera.\n\nThe skiers on Tom Struthers stunt team all had to be advanced, so he\n\nassembled some of the best, including two extreme skiers. Struthers says, I had one\n\nguy, Ian McIntosh, who makes his living skiing avalanches and doing hundred-foot\n\njumps off of glaciers. He was unbelievable.\n\nNolan and Pfister also relied on experts to shoot the downhill and cross-country\n\naction. The cinematographer recounts, About 85 percent of what we shot in Calgary\n\nwas done with handheld cameras. I did some of it, but I am an amateur skier so it was\n\n23\n\nhard for me to conceive of even getting down those hills, much less doing it with a\n\ncamera in my hands. We brought in Chris Patterson, who specializes in ski photography\n\nfor movies and commercials. What he was able to do holding that camera amazed Chris\n\nand me. He delivered some spectacular footage.\n\nThere was also striking footage taken from the air, with the aid of helicopter pilot\n\nCraig Hoskins and aerial director of photography Hans Bjerno. Both previously worked\n\non Nolans Insomnia, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Pfister says, Between\n\nthe wind and the snow, they braved some tough conditions and did a phenomenal job.\n\nNolan says, I think we experienced a number of extremes, from burning sun to\n\nheavy rain to incredible snowfalls, and thats something we were after in making this film.\n\nWe took our actors to the top of mountains and under the water and all over the world,\n\nand they rose to every challenge marvelously. I am a great believer in getting out there\n\non location and confronting an environment because it brings so much to the credibility\n\nof the action. And, at the end of the day, I think it adds something to the feeling the\n\naudience has of being taken someplace they havent been before.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio relates, For the actors, it was so intriguing that we were\n\nessentially experiencing all of this for the first time, just as the audience will be. As a\n\ngroup, we were on this epic journey and were in a constant state of discovery and\n\nsurprise. I think thats going to be one of the most exciting things about watching this\n\nmovierealizing that there are unlimited possibilities and you never truly know what\n\ncould happen next.\n\nCOBB\n\nDreams feel real while were in them.\n\nIts only when we wake up that we\n\nrealize something was actually strange.\n\nAfter the cold of Calgary, the filmmakers welcomed the warmer clime of Los\n\nAngeles, where Nolan reunited with his longtime editor, Lee Smith.\n\nSmith notes, Chris enjoys the process of editing and is very decisive about what\n\nhes looking for. It also helps that he has a remarkable memory for everything he put on\n\nfilm, no matter how long they shot. His recall never ceases to amaze me.\n\nI love working with Lee in the editing room, says Nolan. Hes a perfectionist\n\nhe gets excited about the finer details of putting the film together. He is also incredibly\n\n24\n\nfast, which is a huge advantage to me, and he has an innate ability to look at a\n\nsequence and gauge whether its going to work for an audience.\n\nThere is so much raw footage on a movie like Inception, I have to rely on my\n\ngut in determining what works, Smith says. My first instinct is usually the one we agree\n\non. I find the less we analyze it, the better chance we have of getting to the heart of the\n\nstory.\n\nCollaborating with Nolan for the third time, composer Hans Zimmer used music\n\nto get to the heart of Inception. Zimmer emphasizes, My focus was constantly on the\n\nemotional world of the story because, even when all is said and done about the\n\nastounding visuals, I think that is one of the great strengths of the film.\n\nNolan states, I always want Hans to be inspired by the picture, but I also like to\n\nhear where his imagination would go in interpreting the ideas of the script. Based on\n\nthat, we start finding interesting points of synchronization between the movie and the\n\nmusic.\n\nZimmer says that his first conversations with the director were about the\n\narrangements and the orchestrations. We talked about wanting big waves of sound,\n\nwhich would require more brass than strings, so I put together a huge brass section. We\n\nrecorded them separately because there was no way that strings would have survived\n\nthe onslaught, he smiles.\n\nOne of the string instruments that Zimmer did spotlight was the guitar, played by\n\nlegendary musician Johnny Marr, the guitarist for the seminal band The Smiths. Zimmer\n\nacknowledges, The idea of incorporating a guitar in the score can be a little tricky\n\nbecause guitar and orchestra dont always gel. But I kept thinking of Johnny Marr, who\n\nhas influenced a whole generation of guitarists. The great thing was that as soon as\n\nJohnny played the first few notes, it was exactly how Id imagined it only better. And\n\nthats what you expect from a great artist.\n\nAnother great artist who is heard in Inception is singer Edith Piaf, whose voice\n\nserves a function beyond the score, Zimmer says. I love that Chris wrote Edith Piaf\n\ninto the script because there is a timeless romantic quality to her voice.\n\nNolan remarks, One of the decisions I had to make early on was regarding our\n\nuse of the Edith Piaf song. Due to the nature of its place in the story, should it be\n\nhandled by the sound department or Hans? I decided to give it to Hans because the\n\nsong was going to have to weave into the score at some point, and he is a genius at\n\n25\n\nblending music and sound togetherfiguring out the balance between instruments and\n\nsynthesizers and voices and sound effects. Its very exciting.\n\nThe aim is for there to be a complete sonic world for the movie, Zimmer adds.\n\nThe instruments should bleed into the sound effects and the sound effects should bleed\n\ninto the music.\n\nThere are scenes in the film where the score and the sound design are literally\n\nindistinguishable, Nolan affirms. What you wind up with is something that connects the\n\ndifferent layers of reality the movie presents between waking and dreaming.\n\nEmma Thomas reflects, Working on this film has made me think very differently\n\nabout dreams and its definitely made me wonder about what Im dreaming and how it\n\nties into my life.\n\nNolan concludes, Once you start examining what the dream experience might\n\nmean, it invites people to think about their own dreams and what they reveal. It raises\n\ninteresting questions about how we assess the nature of our own reality.\n\n# # #\n\n26\n\nABOUT THE CAST\n\nLEONARDO DICAPRIO (Cobb) is an award-winning actor and a three-time\n\nAcademy Award® nominee.
