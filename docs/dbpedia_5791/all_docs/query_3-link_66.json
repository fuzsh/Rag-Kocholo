        "text": "From blockbuster hits like James Bond to the world-famous TV series Game of Thrones, Iceland has become a major stomping ground for major film productions. Here are the 15 best TV shows and movies filmed in Iceland:\n\n1. James Bond series: A View to a Kill (1985) and Die Another Day (2002) - Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon\n\nJames Bond action movies, featuring the British secret agent, 007, have been filmed in Iceland twice. Many scenes of the 14th and the 20th James Bond movies were shot in Iceland, from amazing snowboarding scenes to an epic car chase across the frozen glacier lagoon, meandering between giant blue icebergs - this was one of the most unforgettable action scenes in the whole James Bond series. Filming locations also included the town of Höfn and Vatnajökull Glacier.\n\nDirected: Lee Tamahori. Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, John Cleese and Judi Dench.\n\n2. The Star Wars saga - Epic locations spanning across Iceland\n\nGeorge Lucas's epic space opera has featured Icelandic scenes in both The Force Awakens and Rogue One. Many of the desolate wintry scenes that most of us watched when we were growing up were also shot in Iceland, the film crews visited Iceland multiple times to shoot footage all over the island.\n\nIcelandic scenery was used as a backdrop for Hoth, the ice planet, in The Force Awakens, and, also, for Eadu, the planet where the mission to assassinate Galen Erso takes place in Rogue One.\n\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Max von Sydow.\n\nEyjafjallajökull\n\nSome Star Wars scenes were shot on Eyjafjallajokull Glacier, the very glacier-topped volcano that became infamous by way of its own huge eruption in 2010 - stopping air traffic around the world.\n\nSvínafellsjökull, Skaftafell Nature Reserve\n\nThe icy scenery of Svínafellsjökull, the 'Hollywood Glacier', was used for shooting scenes which took place, or so we are meant to believe, on the icy planet of Hoth! However, it is quite difficult to recognize any specific features of the Icelandic landscapes in the movie.\n\nReynisfjara and Mýrdalssandur\n\nThe area around the mountains of Hjörleifshöfði and Hafursey at Mýrdalssandur were used to film Lah’mu and Eadu. Mýrdalssandur is a desert-like glacier flood outwash plain. Hjörleifshöfði and Hafursey are on the south coast of Iceland and surrounded by black sand desert. These places are all, indeed, almost extraterrestrial in appearance. The Ring Road crosses this flat 25 kilometers-long plain.\n\nLake Mývatn and Lake Víti\n\nBoth lakes are located in the north of the country, surrounded by extraordinary volcanic landscapes and geothermal fields. We can easily see the reason why the directors chose to shoot footage in these places!\n\n3. The Game of Thrones Series\n\nGame of Thrones is an epic American fantasy drama television series, the show has achieved one of the highest global popularity ratings to date. Set on fictional continents, the Icelandic landscapes play an important role in the storyline, representing the land of the far north where legendary creatures live, known to fans as the ‘Land Beyond The Wall’.\n\nCreators: David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Starring: Sean Bean, Mark Addy, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Michelle Fairley, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Iain Glen, Aidan Gillen, Kit Harington, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Richard Madden, Alfie Allen, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Jack Gleeson, Rory McCann, Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance, Liam Cunningham, John Bradley, Natalie Dormer and Jerome Flynn.\n\nVatnajökull National Park\n\nScenes with the Wildlings north of The Wall in seasons two and three were filmed at Svínafellsjökull Glacier, an outlet glacier of the Vatnajökull icecap, and other locations nearby in the Skaftafell Nature Reserve on the South Coast of Iceland.\n\nGrjótagjá Hot Spring Cave\n\nThe famous scene where Jon Snow breaks his vow with Ygritte was shot in in Grjótagjá, a hot spring cave near Lake Mývatn in North Iceland. The hot spring does exist - but bathing in it is forbidden because the water is far too hot. The waterfall which shows up in this scene is, alas, not real!\n\nDimmuborgir\n\nThe scenes where Mance Rayder sets up his camp and Sam Tarly is being attacked by white walkers was filmed in the area of Dimmuborgir and the otherworldly lava fields that surround it.\n\nThingvellir National Park\n\nThingvellir National Park was the location for Arya's and Sandor Clegane's journey, and the fight between Brienne and the Hound in the fourth season. The pass to the impregnable Eyrie was filmed at the rift between the tectonic plates. If you visit the Golden Circle sights in Iceland you can actually walk through this area and see these places close-up for yourself!\n\nOh, and did you know that the Mountain is played by an Icelandic actor? Or that the band playing at Joffrey’s wedding was actually Sigur Rós, a famous Icelandic band?\n\nKirkjufell Mountain\n\nKirkjufell is one of the most photographed mountains in Iceland. It appears for a second in episode five of the sixth season, when the Children of the Forest created the first White Walker. The mountain can be seen again in season seven, when the Hound describes it as a mountain that looks like an arrowhead.\n\n4. Tomb Raider\n\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider is an action-adventure film, based on the popular Tomb Raider video game series, featuring the character Lara Croft who is portrayed by Angelina Jolie.\n\nThere is a three-minute sequence in the first Tomb Raider film, which was filmed at the Jökulsárlón Glacial Lagoon in South-East Iceland. The location depicted in the film is a remote village in Siberia. If you feel like pretending to be Angelina for a day, and even taking a boat ride on the ice lagoon just like Lara Croft does in Tomb Raider, join us on a tour to the south coast!\n\nDirected: Simon West. Starring: Angelina Jolie, Jon Voight, Daniel Craig, Iain Glen, Noah Taylor and Chris Barrie.\n\n5. Batman Begins\n\nBatman Begins is a superhero action film based on the DC Comics character. The film reboots the origin story of Bruce Wayne, from the death of his parents and his journey to becoming Batman.\n\nSurprisingly, the Icelandic landscapes in the movie represent Bhutan in South Asia, which just goes to show how diverse the scenery in this country really is. In the movie, Liam Neeson and Christian Bale have their epic sword fight on the glacier. The actors later told the press that they heard cracking from beneath the ice whilst they were shooting the scene.\n\nThese scenes were shot at Svínafellsjökull Glacier on the South Coast of Iceland. It is one of the numerous outlet glaciers which stretch out from the enormous Vatnajökull, Europe's largest icecap, which covers 8% of Iceland’s total landmass.\n\nIf you want to do a glacier hike on the glacier where the two Hollywood stars battled it out, check out our glacier hike tour of Svinafellsjokull Glacier.\n\nDirected: Christopher Nolan. Starring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe and Morgan Freeman.\n\n6.
