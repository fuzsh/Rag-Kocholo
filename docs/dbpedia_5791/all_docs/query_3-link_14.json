        "text": "Now first of all, they definitely did not create zero gravity to films this, since this is way harder and more expensive then you might expect, and not really doable for a whole set at all. The only way to achieve that here on earth (well, not actually \"on earth\" either, but without putting the set in a geostationary orbit like satellites) would be through a parabolic flight in a plane, putting the passengers into extended free-fall (which is practically what weightlessness is). But you can only do that for a short time and not with a whole room, let alone an entire hotel corridor. And let's not talk about how much that would cost for the runtime of an entire scene.\n\nBut since Christopher Nolan is a known proponent of pracitcal effects minimizing the use of CGI (or at least not simulating entire sets with it), it has to be simulated somehow. The BluRay of the movie contains a few making-ofs that also elaborate on the simulation of gravity in the film, provided you're talking about the scenes in the hotel on the 2nd dream level.\n\nWhat they did was use different sets for the whole scene, with different orientations, suspending the actors on wires to let them \"fly\" through the scene.\n\nChristopher Nolan: What I wanted to do for the zero gravity sequences was to take an ordinary environment and achieve this very congruent zero gravity effect. We did it through a number of different rigs and in the final edit what you see is shot to shot to shot it tends to be a different orientation and a completely different rig in each shot and I think that more than anything else really stops the audience of seeing the trick of how this scene is done.\n\nSome of the sets, especially the long hotel corridor was built upright, so that the walkway is actually vertical and the camera is at the bottom looking upward. Then they just hung the actors, primarily Joseph Gordon-Levitt, upside down on wires so his movement is actually controlled towards the bottom (along the corridor in the film) and he's free to move towards the sides (inside the cross-section of the corridor).\n\nPaul Franklin: The vertical corridor is supposed to be the same location as the horizontal corridor, it's an identical set. The difference is that it has been built vertical standing on its end. This means we drop actors and stunt performers on wires down into the set and the camera looks up at them. They can then be raised and lowered and swing around the sides and it looks like they're floating in zero gravity.\n\nIn addition to that actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt tried to simulate the behaviour of a human in zero gravity, based on that of people subject to real weightlessness.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt: In real zero-G, and I've actually spoken to people that have been in real zero-G, what they told me is they never felt so relaxed in life. What I did is the exact opposite of that. In order to make it look like that was the case I actually had to keep every muscle tight because I was supporting myself."
