        "text": "This double exposure image was achieved using a special film swapping technique. I also masked the upper half and lower half of the lens with a product called the \"Splitzer\". This double exposure was shot in Taiwan and Hong Kong. When I shot the film in Taiwan, I opened only the lower half of the lens using the \"Splitzer\". After shooting the film in Taiwan, I rewound and took the film out of the camera. After a few weeks, I went to Hong Kong and installed the same film in the camera again. Then I only opened the upper half of the lens using the “Splitzer” and shot the entire roll again in Hong Kong. These 2 images were combined on each one frame finally.\n\nMy double exposures are inspired by movies, paintings, graphic arts etc. \"INCEPTION\" by Christopher Nolan has so many hints for my double exposures. Movies use computer graphics to achieve these effects. I love making these unique views with a film camera and no / minimal editing."
