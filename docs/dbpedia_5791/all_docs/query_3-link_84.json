        "text": "Gabriel Harman was the talented storyboard artist who helped the amazing director, Christopher Nolan, realise his visions for the special effects used in the film Inception. Inception is one of the most modern films using the most high tech special effects out there today. Nolan wanted to use over 500 special effects shots within his complex film and Harman was one of the many, who helped him visualise his ideas and bring them to life. Many shots within the film Inception are sot at strange and unusual angles that often spin and turn. Harman’s unique and diverse style that he applies to his storyboards are incredibly detailed and modern. What I adore about the shots above is that Harman has simply drew an incredibly complex and detailed image sequence and then drawn boxes around specific sections to explain exactly what element will be included in each shot. It’s an amazingly new way of developing the way the storyboard is designed by making it a lot more modern.\n\nWebsite: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7ff4c-ZqpY"
