        "text": "KANANASKIS, CANADA — 85 miles west of Calgary. In a defunct ski resort at the eastern fringe of the Canadian Rockies, director Christopher Nolan has erected a fortress. An angular assemblage of gray slab and metal grill with a tower that overlooks a former ski slope at 7,600 feet, it’s taken three months to construct — movie-show prefab, but sturdy enough to brave the valley’s 100 mph winds. Black and yellow CAUTION lines are pulled taut around its perimeter.\n\nIt’s Nov. 22, the final day of shooting for Nolan’s latest film, the Leo DiCaprio thriller “Inception,” which arrives in theaters Friday. In the time it took to build the fortress, Nolan — director of critical and commercial successes such as “Batman Begins,” “The Dark Knight” and “Memento” — has spent $170 million and filmed in locations as far-flung as Morocco, Tokyo, Paris, London and LA.\n\nBut today he is back in Kananaskis. And he is going to blow that fortress up.\n\nOriginally, the explosion was going to be achieved purely through model work. But Nolan and his special effects supervisor, Chris Corbould — the man who built the Batmobile and Batpod, flipped a tractor-trailer in “The Dark Knight” and made the impossible look real in 11 James Bond films — reasoned that if this set was going to be struck anyway, they might as well do it for real.\n\nOver the past few days, Nolan has been constantly on the move, whether filming a ski-chase from the back of a skidoo, a shootout from a helicopter, or the spectacular detonation of a Humvee. It doesn’t take long to realize there is no director’s chair on his set. The only time he sits down is when he climbs into a chopper.\n\n“There’s no big playback and no big monitor screen system,” marvels DiCaprio. “It’s just Chris with his handheld cameras, shooting and shooting and shooting. And if it looks great to him on this little monitor, to the naked eye, on film, he’ll move on. It’s very fast, very efficient, there aren’t a lot of bells and whistles. Him and the cameramen and the actors. Boom boom boom.”\n\nOn most movies, these explosive, mountainside-blasting antics would be dealt with by a second unit, but Nolan doesn’t believe in such things. Indeed, not only does he feel he should shoot action himself, he actively enjoys the experience. As do his crew. Despite the tough conditions and quick pace — the weather could turn treacherous at any moment, while daylight is at a premium at this time of year — the mood at the fortress is generally ebullient, certainly calm. There are even a few snowball fights, and not just when the director’s back is turned. Nolan himself at one point lobs one at stunt coordinator Tom Struthers.\n\nArctic-camouflaged goons on skis, balcony-hopping gunfight action and explosions designed by Courbold. The Bond vibe is strong here.\n\n“This is absolutely my Bond movie,” Nolan chuckles. “I’ve been plundering ruthlessly from the Bond movies in everything I’ve done, forever. I grew up just loving them, and they’re a huge influence on me.”\n\nSo the 007 feel is utterly deliberate. And 1969’s “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” is the key inspiration.\n\n“I think that would be my favorite Bond,” Nolan says. “What I liked about it that we’ve tried to emulate in this film is there’s a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion. Of all the Bond films, it’s by far the most emotional. There’s a love story. And ‘Inception’ is a kind of love story as well. I’m going soft in my old age.”\n\nA love story? A Bond movie? It’s seemingly a far cry from Nolan’s original, cryptic promise of a sci-fi thriller set “within the architecture of the mind.”\n\nIt goes something like this: DiCaprio is Dom Cobb, a man who presents himself to a business magnate (Cillian Murphy) as an expert in “subconscious security.” He uses clandestine technology to enter, explore and manipulate people’s dreams, and extract ideas — the ultimate in corporate espionage.\n\nIn truth, though, Cobb has been hired by a rival businessman (Ken Watanabe) to insert an idea. The job also somehow offers the dream thief personal redemption, connected to the fate of his wife (Marion Cotillard). So Cobb assembles a team, including a point man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an impersonator (Tom Hardy) and a young architecture student (Ellen Page) recommended by her professor, played by Nolan’s “good luck charm” Michael Caine.\n\n“What Chris accomplishes here, besides the emotional journey, is this constant, unrelenting feeling of suspense and infinite possibility,” Di-Caprio says. “You never know what’s gonna happen next. It’s hard to do that. And even having worked on the movie and knowing the plot, when I watched the movie I was like, ‘Wow, what the hell am I gonna see next? I have no idea what’s possible.’”\n\nNolan has been trying to work with DiCaprio for some years. “I’ve met with him a bunch of times,” the director says. “I always felt he would be a great collaborator, just in sitting and talking about projects, even though nothing came of them. Just his initial take on scripts is fascinating to engage with. In fact, I’m sure I’ve stolen ideas from him in the past, based on those conversations!”\n\nNolan further praises DiCaprio for lending “Inception” an invaluable emotional edge, comparing the role to that of Guy Pearce’s amnesiac in “Memento.” The actor needed to bring life to a fiendishly intricate plot.\n\n“I absolutely desperately needed him,” Nolan says. “I’d written ‘Inception’ as sort of a clever-clever heist movie. And heist movies tend to be deliberately superficial and glamorous. I needed him to bring the thing together, open it up to the audience and make it a human story, and he’s done that extraordinarily well.”\n\nSo why did DiCaprio say yes to this project as opposed to any of Nolan’s previous movies? He’d just made Martin Scorsese’s “Shutter Island,” another movie about distortions of reality and perception, albeit with vast differences in tone, genre and setting.\n\n“It reminded me of [Nolan’s 2002 Al Pacino manhunt thriller] ‘Insomnia’ or ‘Memento,’ but on steroids. I just became immediately intrigued by this concept — this dream-heist notion and how this character’s gonna unlock his dream world and ultimately affect his real life.”\n\nIt’s not often we see DiCaprio in a full-on summer blockbuster — for that is exactly what Warner Bros., and Nolan himself, want “Inception” to be. Of course, the actor’s quick to point out that this isn’t your typical popcorn flick.\n\n“Yes, this is a summer blockbuster, and it’s being marketed as such, but to me, some of those films have themes or sequences I’ve seen a hundred times before,” DiCaprio says. “This is definitely something I’ve not seen a hundred times before. This is unique in every aspect. It is surreal. It is cerebral.”\n\nIt is refreshing to see a gargantuan summer release that isn’t based on a TV show, comic book or plastic plaything. There’s no brand to hang it on, no built-in audience.\n\nNolan got the idea for “Inception” walking on a beach nearly a decade ago. He wrote 80 pages, which languished in a drawer for five years. Meanwhile, his filmmaking chops and reputation caught up with his vision.\n\nHad Nolan done the “$30 million version” of “Inception” as his follow-up to 2002’s “Insomnia,” it would have been a stripped-down thriller rather than a full-on action movie. “And that never worked for me,” he says. “It took me a long time to figure out why, but what I realized is incredibly simple: As soon as you say this film is about dreams, it has to be on the grandest scale possible or you’re not addressing it correctly. Because what’s fascinating about the potential of the human mind is that it’s infinite, and infinitesimal.”\n\nWhich brings us back to that $170 million budget, a luxury afforded by the combined $1.3 billion worldwide gross of Nolan’s Batman films.\n\nIt’s almost 2 p.m. at the fortress set, and Nolan is ready to decimate his pricey creation. Five cameras are set up, a sixth on the chopper circling above. Paramedics are on standby.\n\n“Let me show you something,” says effects maestro Corbould. “We’ve got just enough time.”\n\nHe lifts one of the cordon lines and heads into the tower, winding up in a crawl space below the flooring. Detonating cord snakes around him. Sticks of dynamite, 40 or so, nestle in holes drilled into stanchions. And there are about a dozen 20-gallon barrels of gasoline.\n\n“Your mobile phone is switched off, right?” Corbould asks.\n\nThe plan, Corbould explains, is that the front wall will explode first. Then two more sets of charges will detonate, in sequence, just after. The desired effect being that the tower will fall forward and the wreckage will cascade down the mountainside.\n\n“That’s the plan,” he says. “But you never know how it’s going to go…” This is a one-take deal.\n\nA crewman pops his head beneath the floorboards: “You need to clear the set.”\n\nAlmost everyone has vanifshed from the mountain. Walkie-talkies “go dark.” “This is insane!” one crew member trills. “It’s sooo James Bond!” Warnings are shouted to watch the sky. For falling debris.\n\n“Stand by… Here we go. Cameras rolling!”\n\nAn almighty BOOM thunders around the valley, and fire and smoke roll impressively up into the air from the tower’s base. But something is amiss. Only the front charges have gone off. And the tower topples… backward.\n\nYet this is no mood-destroying\n\nanti-climax. “How long to reset?” someone jokes. This is Nolan’s world, after all. Everything’s under control, even when it isn’t.\n\n“It did not go quite as planned,” he later admits. “But we’re still using the shot. We got a very spectacular initial blast, and we had always planned a massive miniature shoot, because the set you saw only represents about a tenth of the actual complex in the film. So then we did an enormous miniature explosion…\n\n“And exactly the same thing happened — the tower fell the wrong way!” He laughs. “So we did it again.”\n\nCould your mind really be the scene of the crime?\n\nIf our dreams were crime scenes, could our secrets be easily stolen?\n\nAnyone experiencing our dreams would learn more about us than we’d like. We dream about things that are important to us. If you were being hunted by someone who wants to know a secret, you’d probably be concerned about it and dream about it.\n\nHow much power can we exert over our dreams?\n\nA tremendous amount, but we live in a non-dreaming Western culture so most of the influence is benign neglect. As a state of consciousness, though, it is highly malleable by culture, setting and personal attention.\n\nCould anything like the dream-heist technology of “Inception” really work?\n\nIt’s probably never going to happen. Finding a specific piece of information would be like looking for a needle in a stack of needles. Which is the right one? How do you know it happened? Dreams take memories and make hybrids of them with current events and old emotional material. It’s a fascinating idea, though.— Joe Cunningham"
