        "text": "I know it’s a little premature to make a thread about a movie that’s still a year off, but I just can’t contain my excitement every time a little news tidbit comes out.\n\nWe know very little about it so far:\n\nIt’s “a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind.”\n\nIt has a big budget, reportedly more than $150m.\n\nIt will be shot in a number of locations around the world including Tokyo, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Tangiers and Calgary.\n\nIt has an amazing cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine.\n\nShooting has started in Tokyo under the working title Oliver’s Arrow. Is anyone else torn between dying to know more about the movie and not wanting to be the slightest bit spoiled?\n\n[EDIT]\n\nIMDB\n\nRotten Tomatoes\n\nOfficial Site\n\nMind Crime viral site\n\nPASIV Device viral site\n\nWhat is Dreamshare viral site\n\nTeaser Trailer 1\n\nTeaser Trailer 2\n\nTeaser Trailer 3\n\nPoster 1\n\nPoster 2\n\nPoster 3\n\nPoster 4\n\nSpoiler thread\n\nThis statement perplexes me. I like the characters in Nolan’s movies for what they are, the Joker in particular was amazing, as well as everyone in Memento. But if you mean that these aren’t character driven movies like “There will be blood” and “Gran Turino” then I agree, and I don’t think that’s what Nolan’s going for.\n\nWhich of his films are you basing this on, in particular? I love Nolan’s movies and totally disagree with your assessment of the characters. Memento, Following, The Prestige, hell, his entire filmography is essentially a collection of character pieces. Not the boring sort of character piece where nothing happens, but fast-moving narratives where the elaborate plots are driven by, and are reflections of, the characters.\n\nYou have a loose description of “character piece”\n\nI do agree that most of his characters are a bit thin, but I think you are overgeneralizing a bit. He has done some deep stuff. But I do feel his movies are a lot more about plot twists than actual interesting dialogue and characters.\n\nI’m talking about the Batmans and The Presitge, particularly. Memento, by it’s very nature, has a thin main character, but I think it worked really well regardless, even if it was all plot twists.\n\nThe Prestige was basicallyabout 2 static characters who each had plot twists that weren’t that impressive. Batman, Harvey Dent, and The Joker? All pretty thin. The movie was still really enjoyable, though.\n\nIt is premature. Oh lord. Are we going to have a thread for Spielberg/Jonathan Nolan’s Interstellar?\n\nOur community college Michael Bay is now in PSYCH 101.\n\nShit explodes. Great.\n\nShit explodes in various places. Great.\n\nLeonard DiCaprio isn’t amazing by any stretch of the means, unless you mean his paycheck.\n\nShooting has started in Tokyo under the working title Oliver’s Arrow. Is anyone else torn between dying to know more about the movie and not wanting to be the slightest bit spoiled?\n\nNo, did you just post this to flamebait me? This film is probably just a repackaging of [I]The Exec[/I].\n\nNot to mention everything else is paper thin; he uses gimmickry to cover up the gaping flaws of his work.\n\nUh…no, the man and his brother don’t know what characterization mean.\n\nI thought he was absolutely perfect in several movies, like Catch Me if You Can, the Aviator, and Revolutionary Road. He was also excellent in other movies like The Departed. Which performances were you underwhelmed by? All of them? Did you not think he was really good in the Aviator, for example?\n\nNolan is currently my #1 director, at least until Cameron’s Avatar comes out.\n\nI have seen Memento about 8 times and will probably keep watching it once every year till I die, because it is simply perfect.And what gets me about it is the atmosphere - thanks to that this movie never gets old.\n\nI also loved Following, liked Insomnia very much, liked Prestige, liked Batman Begins and loved Dark Knight.He is just awesome.\n\nAnd when I saw Memento for the first time back in 2000, I NEW this guy would make it big.But this big, I had no idea.I love the fact that he is making scifi now, my favourite genre.\n\nJudging by the standards of superhero movies, the Batmans have the best characterization out there. Any weaknesses are more attributable to the source material than Nolan’s writing skill.\n\nSay what you will about the two main characters in The Prestige, but static they weren’t. Heck, half of the movie is devoted to detailing their gradually increasing obsessions.\n\nUh, Burton/Keaton’s Bruce Wayne in the '89 Batman has better characterization in what way? He walked around dinner parties and public as a vague, odd, low-key guy with a lack of cuisine knowledge (i.e. on vichysoisse: “It’s cold…”) but no real distinct characteristics. Keaton’s Wayne is a complete cipher. Keaton’s Batman is also more-or-less a cipher.\n\nCompare that with Nolan/Bale’s Bruce Wayne: angry, bitter youth driven to attempted murder; vagabond, world traveling criminal; ninja-in-training; vapid playboy facade upon return; and at his core, completely driven towards justice and retribution. You understand his inner character and his personal progression, and it stresses that his true self is Batman, and that Wayne is the mask."
