He spins his totem--the top--to make sure he isn't dreaming, and then receives a call from his children.\n\nHow do they know where he's staying? As his father-in-law (Michael Caine) later says,\n\nIt'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince these children they still have a father.\n\nSo we know he isn't in contact with them a lot. Additionally, he wouldn't want to risk making a call to the United States where he is still wanted for murdering his wife."
