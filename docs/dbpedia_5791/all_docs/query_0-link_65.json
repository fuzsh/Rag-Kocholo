        "text": "AKA: N/A\n\nGenre: Slice-of-Life/Drama/Comedy\n\nYear Released: 2003\n\nDistributor: Destination Films/GKIDS\n\nOrigin: Japan\n\nRunning Time: 92 minutes\n\nRating/Recommended Audience: PG-13\n\nRelated Films/Series: The Three Godfathers, Marked Men, Action, Hell‚Äôs Heroes, Three Godfathers (1936 Remake), 3 Godfathers (1948 Remake)\n\nFor Fans Of: Millennium Actress, My Neighbors the Yamadas, The Pursuit of Happyness, God Bless the Child\n\nNotes:\n\n-I was able to stream it via Crackle and it‚Äôs streaming for free albeit with ads.\n\n-Please check out Ashley‚Äôs blog The Review Heap.\n\nFun Facts:\n\n-Tokyo Godfathers is the first and only time Satoshi Kon remade something. It‚Äôs a 21st-century Japanese anime remake of The Three Godfathers which is based on Peter B. Kyne‚Äôs novel of the same name, hence the multiple entries in the ‚ÄúRelated Films/Series‚Äù section.\n\n-The nurse that shows up later in the film (she will be unnamed lest it spoil a major aspect of the plot) is voiced by Mamiko Noto. She‚Äôs the voice of Rin from Inu-Yasha, Yukina from My-Hime, and Nina Fortner/Anna Liebert from Monster.\n\n-GKIDS is going to give this film an English dub this year which has never been done until after they relicensed it.\n\n-Musical Fan Bonus: The song that Hana sings from The Sound of Music is ‚ÄúClimb Every Mountain‚Äù.\n\n-The co-writer of Tokyo Godfathers‚Äô script is Keiko Nobumoto. She was a writer for Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus, Samurai Champloo, and she created Wolf‚Äôs Rain.\n\nO: It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve reviewed anything from the late great Satoshi Kon, but now‚Äôs as good a time as any to check out more of his works. For those that are new to Iridium Eye, I have reviewed his debut film Perfect Blue and his last film Paprika AKA The Original Inception. I was certainly positive about both of those films. I‚Äôm glad to revisit Kon-sensei‚Äôs work, but this time, I‚Äôm not reviewing alone. What‚Äôs good Ashley?\n\nA: Hey! So much seems good, I don‚Äôt know quite where to start. Perhaps with the way that this film still stands out for me, in Kon‚Äôs filmography, as being quite ‚Äòwarm‚Äô in tone. Yes, it‚Äôs winter and of course, it‚Äôs meant to be comedic but even with heartbreaking themes there‚Äôs a real sense of ‚Äòeverything will work out‚Äô to this movie that I‚Äôm not sure I see in his other works. Do you see Tokyo Godfathers as having similar qualities?\n\nO: That‚Äôs good to know. I have noticed a lot of warm colors with the outfits and some of the backgrounds that aren‚Äôt covered in snow. That‚Äôs actually an astute observation of sorts with the overall tone and coloration. I guess we‚Äôre a bit late by not reviewing this around Christmastime, but it‚Äôs still a movie anyone can enjoy regardless of the holiday season or the weather. Since you‚Äôre from Australia, I know you guys have a Summertime Christmas down under. Not so much here in America especially with me being from the Midwest. Okay, we had a green Christmas that was surprisingly warm that time of year (it was in the 50s Fahrenheit which is almost unheard of where I‚Äôm from).\n\nNow for all of you readers not familiar with Tokyo Godfathers, this is what the movie is about. It takes place in Japan‚Äôs capital (obviously) around Christmas time and there are three homeless people trying to survive in this snowy weather. There‚Äôs Gin, who‚Äôs a rugged and crotchety middle-aged man who struggles with alcoholism. There‚Äôs Hana, who‚Äôs a drag queen that tends to be very dramatic and has a romantic way of looking at life. The last one is Miyuki who‚Äôs a runaway girl who‚Äôs very brash and tomboyish. After going to the local Christmas pageant for some free food, they go dumpster diving for more food and supplies until they all find a baby girl that was buried in all of the trash. Hana decides to name the girl Kiyoko and the three of them become unlikely foster parents of sorts before seeing how they can return the child to her parents. As the homeless trio takes care of Kiyoko, they encounter other people that need help along the way, but they get entangled into crazy situation after crazy situation in order to find out who the parents are.\n\nA:It is almost like a comedy of errors, huh? Yet, the narrative often keeps things firmly in that idea of ‚ÄòChristmas miracle‚Äô, as the trials they face lead to another clue or some respite from trouble. In that sense, Tokyo Godfathers really does feel like a fantasy but the setting is still kinda grimy. After all, the poor kid‚Äôs found in a trash heap and our heroes are homeless so it‚Äôs not a conventionally ‚Äòpretty‚Äô anime ‚Äì instead, I think the obvious inference we as viewers are encouraged to make is that we should recognise the beauty of humanity beyond appearances.\n\nI think that‚Äôs one aspect that makes it a perfect Christmas film too. And down here in Australia most of us had an extremely rough fire-season to go with our holidays (I could have used some of that Northern Hemisphere snow you missed üôÇ ) so I found watching Tokyo Godfathers a really welcome distraction, even as you say, we‚Äôre watching it a little late. Speaking of snow, I wanted to ask, since we both like haiku, whether you enjoyed the appearances of haiku?\n\nA little baby / powdery snow on its cheeks / on this holy night\n\nMy mother‚Äôs white breath / as she watches me set out / on a long journey\n\nOn the year‚Äôs last day / when all of a life‚Äôs accounts / have been settled up\n\nO: That would certainly be accurate about it being a comedy of errors. Tokyo Godfathers certainly delivers funny moments like Hana‚Äôs ‚Äúeating for two‚Äù comment or the callback to that quote when one of the parishioners sees him with Kiyoko from a distance, Gin temporarily losing his voice due to losing his breath as he‚Äôs explaining the mother‚Äôs whereabouts, or the yakuza don not paying attention on the road were random highlights for me. The comedy worked, but I enjoyed there is a healthy balance between the funny and serious moments. The ‚ÄúChristmas miracle‚Äù aspect was a nice contrast with the grimy reality of poverty, homelessness, and crime. Your sentiment of recognizing beauty beyond appearances is quite the opposite of so many Western animated films while also unintentionally reminding me of the French/Congolese music documentary Benda Bilili! Since the title refers to two-thirds of the Kinshasa-based band‚Äôs name (Staff Benda Bilili) and it‚Äôs Lingala for ‚ÄúLook beyond appearances‚Äù. Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect to cross over a documentary or a DRC band in an anime review, but I really was adding to your point. Hahaha!\n\nYeah, having a summer Christmas is so foreign to me. I never experienced a warm January until I visited Ecuador three years ago. I‚Äôm certainly fine with snow as long as the roads are plowed and salted. Trust me, driving in three inches or more of snow really isn‚Äôt fun. With that said, I was sorry to hear about Australia‚Äôs fire issues and all the damage done to the people, wildlife, and the environment. The haiku? Oh, yeah. You knew I would be a fan of that being an actual narrative device. I‚Äôm a poet and spoken word artist, so this was right up my alley. A few years ago, I did a whole series on katauta, so I do have an interest in Japanese styles of poetry.\n\nA: I thought you‚Äôd dig the ku üôÇ\n\nO: You‚Äôd be right about that. The verses were plot relevant and certainly creative in its presentation. I liked how the words of the haiku showed up on screen every time Hana would wax poetic in those moments.\n\nA: I think about the verses a lot because it really feels like another piece of fantastic congruity in an already super-cohesive film ‚Äì each haiku has a winter kigo and the setting is full of snow and shadow, the layers of clothing for the characters signal it too or the coldness of the antagonists.\n\nSpeaking of antagonists, I also really like that there aren‚Äôt many simplistic villain/hero set-ups in the movie ‚Äì even with the shattered family that kicks everything off. It‚Äôs understandable why some of their actions were taken, even if it‚Äôs still unconscionable. Right down to the yakuza you mentioned, we see that humanisation. This extends to our leads I guess, as they have some pretty rough secrets in their past, though maybe Hana is the most open of all the characters.\n\nAbout Hana, I wanted to ask whether you‚Äôd come across much writing around representation for her or the film in general? In terms of representation she‚Äôs far from a cruel cliche played as a joke ‚Äì she‚Äôs a fully realised character, but I did stumble across a concern about some translations of the script into English, where choosing to use a slur for what might have actually been better written as ‚Äòdrag queen‚Äô.\n\nO: Definitely. The poetry really adds another layer to Tokyo Godfathers without becoming overbearing or even pretentious. I feel like most other directors would‚Äôve been too obtuse or handled it in a clunky matter. For example, I do like Makoto Shinkai‚Äôs works, but there are times when the poetic aspect wasn‚Äôt needed in some of his films.\n\nThat‚Äôs right. The people feel human whether it‚Äôs the main characters, the yakuza don, the Latinx family living in Japan, and most of the other passersby. Most of the characters had some kind of humanization. The characters that come the closest to being straight-up villains even if it was to shed light on an issue were those rich kids who beat up Gin in the middle of the film. That‚Äôs a sad thing that happens in Japan where the homeless population gets abused. It‚Äôs not even just limited to that nation since I know that happens in America as well by some ‚ÄúAffluenza gangs‚Äù of sorts who come from wealthy families and get away with so many things. Not many movies would dare to take on poverty or call out a situation that is very under-reported, to say the least.\n\nGood question about Hana. I totally understand the concerns about the translations about the multiple instances of homophobic language whether by Gin or Hana. This came out in the early 00s when it wasn‚Äôt seen as much of an issue back then which certainly doesn‚Äôt help. There could‚Äôve been better word choices or at least they could‚Äôve tweaked the script to where Hana would call out those who would use those words. I do feel like Hana is someone who is believable and can be taken seriously as a character. When I first watched this film, I did have concerns if she would be some flaming LGBT stereotype. Yes, the drag queen/transvestite aspect certainly plays into the character, but she doesn‚Äôt play it up as much as one would expect. Besides being addressed by a female name, wearing women‚Äôs clothes, and even using feminine dialogue like saying ‚ÄúAtashi (wa)‚Äù as opposed to the gender-neutral ‚ÄúWatashi (wa)‚Äù or masculine ‚ÄúBoku (wa)‚Äù when comes to saying ‚ÄúI (am)‚Äù in Japanese, she is someone with redeemable character traits who legitimately wanted the best for everyone. Even though I‚Äôm a straight man, I didn‚Äôt feel as though Hana was some stereotypical LGBT character.\n\nA: I hadn‚Äôt noticed the personal pronoun aspects, that‚Äôs a great piece of detail. And yeah, she‚Äôs got the biggest heart in the film üôÇ\n\nI can‚Äôt find the quote but I believe Kon mentions that 1948 film as one aspect of what inspired him here, but I found it interesting that if ‚Äò3 Godfathers‚Äô has the baby as its device to drive a redemption arc for criminals, that Kon chose to give the heroic task of saving a baby to three folks who were not bad sorts. More, three people who are also vulnerable. In this sense, I wonder how much social commentary we can read into the film? We‚Äôve both talked about the work done to humanise everyone in the movie and you mentioned the rich punks beating up the homeless, which I‚Äôve seen in other anime too. I wonder, with the focus in the mainstream on Shonen fighting (and also Isekai) whether at times, the heroism in anime can be focused on massive battles against massively evil forces ‚Äì sometimes to the exclusion of ‚Äòsmaller‚Äô heroes? Is there shrinking room for social commentary in anime? It is out there but I suspect commercial pressures shape the landscape as much as anything else.\n\nO: No problem. It was something I remembered from my Japanese classes during my later high school years. If you want a very glaring example of this in that language, I‚Äôd check out Kino‚Äôs Journey and the first movie from the original series. Going back on topic, Hana is the heart of the trio.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt aware of that quote or notion, but this gives a whole new dynamic to Tokyo Godfathers. The only one who did anything criminal of the bunch was Miyuki and while I‚Äôm not excusing her actions in this case, the three of them were vulnerable people in their own ways but were united because of their homeless state. It‚Äôs like they know they can‚Äôt survive on their own for long, so they become a surrogate family of sorts with Gin being the dad, Hana being the mom, and Miyuki being their teenage daughter if you will. The dynamics work well even with how broken they all are.\n\nMy goodness, you bring up a very legitimate point about heroism. In the context of anime, you always see these giant epic battles with the fate of a city or the world at stake. I‚Äôm even going to add to your point by saying Tokyo Godfathers becomes an even starker contrast in heroism in hindsight when you consider how popular superhero movies have been for over a decade now (Iron Man pun not intended). With the MCU and DC, you see these same giant battles or at least high-risk situations going on and people assume that‚Äôs the kind of heroism that matters. Instead of showing heroes in spandex, capes, masks, or martial arts outfits, we see people who would be considered at the bottom of society doing the simple kindness of taking care of a baby, saving someone from being buried in a car in the snow, or even just talking to an immigrant family despite language barriers was that much more poignant. This could be a great discussion piece on ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù heroes as opposed to the rampant superhero or Shonen fighting-type stories that many idolize that people forget to do ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù forms of doing good things. I don‚Äôt expect to see Superman flying around to fly people to safety in reality. I don‚Äôt expect to see Captain America using his shield to fight bad guys in real life. I sure don‚Äôt see Goku coming to Kamehameha or spirit bomb any inter-dimensional threats. However, I do know there are people helping others in simple and understated ways, but they never get the shine like fictional characters do. What does that say about our society and what constitutes heroism?\n\nA: I think a lot about this in terms of who we elevate in society, yeah. So many ‚Äòsmaller‚Äô folks do so much but receive too little recognition. I do wonder how much of our attraction to the larger-than-life heroes simply comes from needing those giants‚Ä¶ maybe as some sort of paragon to look up to, even being aware that it‚Äôs not possible in the real world? I do wish heroism was more generally discussed in a broader sense/more visible in film. And while we definitely agree on the heroes in Tokyo Godfathers I wanted to ask where you saw shortcomings in the movie?\n\nFor me I guess I wanted a little more backstory for our heroes at times, though I know it would have impacted what felt like pretty great pacing to me. I‚Äôm in two minds about whether more condemnation of the villain for abandoning the baby would have been good ‚Äì I guess it could easily changed the tone of the film too much if Gin had given him a real thrashing.\n\nO: Oh, sure. I could see your typical superhero type to be some kind of paragon to look up to, but some of them can be Marty Stus/Mary Sues. Seeing three normal people who are in the bottom echelons of society makes them more relatable and grounded. We see their flaws and some aspects of their situation were out of their control. I wish other forms of heroism were discussed like those without superpowers or hi-tech gadgets to save the day.\n\nI do agree that a bit more backstory would‚Äôve helped with the main characters. They could spend even just a few more minutes doing so. What they had was great and worked well with the pacing. While the concept of rich people abusing the poor was a rare concept that needed to be addressed, that affluenza gang was karma houdinis that got away and weren‚Äôt mentioned again. Part of me wanted there to be some kind of retribution even if they weren‚Äôt a main part of the story. Maybe this could be fridge brilliance with how those with money get away with crimes even though what they clearly did was enough to get anyone behind bars. Man alive, you have those in jail serving hard time for non-violent offenses and this would include homeless people being locked up because of their homelessness. I also thought that Sachiko got off with just a slap on the wrist (or rather a slap from Hana after they interact) for what she did at the climax of the film. I wouldn‚Äôt wish what happened to her in the backstory to anyone, but that in no way excuses what she did. If that was a man in her position, he‚Äôd be considered the biggest monster of the movie (I‚Äôm trying not to spoil for those who haven‚Äôt seen Tokyo Godfathers). The story was still great regardless, but those were things that bugged me that came to mind.\n\nA: Definitely with the Marty/Mary stuff, yeah. And that‚Äôs a really good point about the punks and especially Sachiko, I remember wondering whether the dark humour of the bridge scene undercut some of the seriousness of the moment with her? (Also, trying not to spoil that part :D). Walking the line between comedy and drama with such serious subject matter must have been tough but it feels like Kon did succeed ultimately, huh?\n\nO: Yeah. The darkly comedic aspect did undercut the bridge scene a bit and even more so in hindsight given the finale. Kon was able to bring the whole story together, but there were a few missteps along the way. I‚Äôm probably going to sound like a hardcore dyed-in-the-wool fanboy for Kon-sensei, but I don‚Äôt think most other directors would‚Äôve handled the balance as well as he did.\n\nIn closing, I was glad to have re-watched this film. I was planning on reviewing it alone at first for my goal to review everything Satoshi Kon directed, but ever since I got that email for a collaborative review, I thought to myself ‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs make it a collab.‚Äù Thanks, Ashley! I‚Äôm glad to have collaborated with you. This film is certainly a must-see for anyone regardless if they are anime fans or not. The level of humanity of the characters is spot-on, the animation is wonderful despite not being as flashy as Paprika, and the themes used are still relevant to this day. I will admit that there were a few flaws that prevented me from giving it a full 10/10 with some underdeveloped story and character aspects, but they were minuscule in hindsight. Any closing thoughts, Ashley?\n\nA: I think just thanks for reviewing this with me üôÇ It was a lot of fun to collaborate and I enjoyed seeing the film from other angles, and especially the way that something you noticed then triggered something for me. And I feel like a Kon fanatic too‚Ä¶ but it really is a fantastic film, folks!\n\nAdjustable Rating System:\n\nAdd 1 point if you like anything from Satoshi Kon.\n\nAdd 1 point if you like dark humour.\n\nSubtract 1-2 points if you want flashier and over-the-top animation.\n\nSubtract 1-2 points if you prefer bright, wholly happy films.\n\nSubtract 1-2 points if you don‚Äôt enjoy films featuring coincidence as plot feature.\n\nPros:\n\n-Wonderful main characters and their interactions\n\n-Excellent albeit understated animation quality\n\n-Relevant and on-point social commentary\n\nCons:\n\n-Sachiko and the affluenza gang got off the hook too easy\n\n-Some less-than-desirable moments of dark comedy\n\n-More character insight would‚Äôve been great\n\nFinal Score from Curtis/Ospreyshire: 9/10\n\nFinal Score from Ashley: 9/10\n\nContent Warning: Tokyo Godfathers is rated PG-13 which makes sense. While this film is nowhere near as graphic as Perfect Blue or Paprika, I wouldn‚Äôt let young children watch it. There are adult themes with child abandonment, homelessness, poverty, suicide, and alcoholism to name a few. The language does get very strong in parts and there‚Äôs homophobic language around Hana given that she‚Äôs a drag queen/transvestite. There are moments of blood and violence with Miyuki‚Äôs backstory, the affluenza gang beating up on Gin, and actual on-screen murder of a Yakuza member by gunshot during a wedding party. The only other things would be some innuendo and a couple of cases of nudity with breastfeeding.\n\n-Written by Curtis Monroe and Ashley Capes"
