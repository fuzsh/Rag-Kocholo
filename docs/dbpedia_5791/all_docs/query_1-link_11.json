Christopher Nolan wrote and directed it. He also produced the movie with his wife, Emma Thomas. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who steals information by going into the subconscious of his targets. A man tells him he will erase his criminal history if he puts an idea into someone's subconscious. The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.[6]\n\nNolan had the idea for Inception over nine years before it was released. But, there is also an anime film just like it called Paprika. After making Insomnia, Nolan wrote an 80-page story for a horror movie about \"dream-stealers\". He presented the idea to Warner Bros. based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation.[7] He decided he needed more experience before making a movie this complex. Nolan stopped working on it,[8] and worked on Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008). He spent six months working on the script for Inception before Warner Bros. bought it in February 2009.[9] They filmed the movie in six countries. They started in Tokyo on June 19, and ended in Canada on November 22. The movie cost $160 million to make. Warner Bros. and Legendary paid for it.[4] The movie studios spent over $100 million to advertise Inception because The Dark Knight (another movie Nolan made) was very popular.[4]"
