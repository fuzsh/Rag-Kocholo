        "text": "'Dad, what do you think it meant when the totem wobbled like that?\" Many parents will be asked a tricky question like this as they leave the cinema after watching Inception. Some will inevitably answer, \"Er… what was the totem again?\" to be met with the unending scorn of their offspring.\n\nEven Leonardo DiCaprio, the star of Christopher Nolan's complex summer blockbuster, has urged filmgoers to see Inception twice. He believes that a second viewing clarifies some difficult plot points and allows the acting to shine through.\n\n\"The sheer nature and the scope of the film and a lot of the action presents itself as something extremely surreal and infinite in possibility,\" he said. \"But when you start to home in on the character's journey, it is four different states of going deep into one's past.\"\n\nDiCaprio speaks with the benefit of having negotiated a challenging learning curve. In February he admitted that the screenplay \"didn't make sense to many of us\" during the shooting process. Bemused fans with no time to go back to the cinema are seeking out answers on Twitter, where the film is repeatedly appearing at the top of the list of most tweeted-about subjects.\n\nYounger viewers should have less of a problem. The thriller, which is largely set inside the heads of its protagonists during a drug-induced sleep, closely resembles the structure of a video game. It sets up a world where narrative is reversible and several things can go on at the same time, at different speeds.\n\n\"I got lost in the skiing bit,\" confessed Kathy Stephens, 46, from Middlesex after a screening in London's Leicester Square. \"I knew we were going down the levels of a dream, but I wanted to discuss it with my friends to work it out.\"\n\nFor her younger companions, Charlie and Sarah Kern, Inception made comparatively easy viewing. \"I was worried before that it would be hard to follow, but it was fine,\" said Sarah, 18.\n\n\"It was a tailor-made video game, wasn't it? With all those levels?\" asked a fellow audience member, the rather more cynical 45-year-old Rose Scott from London. \"And presumably Inception II is already on the way.\"\n\nIt might be all right to spend £9.50 on a cinema ticket to be baffled, but for a Hollywood director to spend a budget of more than $200m on confusing his audience seems more extravagant. In fact, however, Nolan is following a fine cinematic tradition. The art of unsettling an audience with a fiendish plot or a subversive narrative technique has an illustrious history, according to Philip French.\n\n\"At one time in my career I thought that if a film was immediately understood, then it had failed,\" the Observer's veteran film critic, a fan of Inception, said this weekend. He points out that Orson Welles' revered Citizen Kane was regarded in much the same way when it came out in 1941. Audiences then were at a loss to know what the elusive \"Rosebud\" really was.\n\nComparisons with Citizen Kane are not necessarily so far-fetched. Rotten Tomatoes, the influential American on-line reviewing website, gave Inception a 100% rating, a rare honour it shares with Welles's masterpiece.\n\nAccording to French, the joy of a truly playful film such as Inception is that \"you don't have to check your mind in with your coat when you go in, or check your watch while you are seeing it\".\n\nFrench argues that the filmmakers' growing love of disorienting their public first hit the big time with the birth of the New Wave in France, in the movement embodied by the Cahiers du Cinéma film journal. The disjointed films of Alain Resnais, for example, such as Hiroshima Mon Amour, from 1959, and Last Year in Marienbad, which came out in 1961, were influenced both by the experimental novel writing of the \"nouveau roman\" and by the abstract movement in art, where conventional images were broken up by painters but were still able to communicate, perhaps even more powerfully. \"It is as Jean-Luc Godard said, 'A film should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order',\" argues French.\n\nOther critics have been less generous about Nolan's talent to bemuse. Rex Reed wrote in the New York Observer that \"Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and IQ points,\" while John Anderson of the Wall Street Journal felt that, \"No one short of a Nasa systems analyst will be able to articulate the plot.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the most conceptually puzzling moments comes when DiCaprio, an ace \"dream extractor\", assumes the identity of a fictional head of internal security, Mr Charles, as a ruse to stabilise the turbulence being experienced by his crack team as they work inside a dream within a dream, bobbing around in the head of their troubled, sleeping \"mark\". While audiences are working hard to keep up with the plot, they are of course happy to swallow the film's ludicrous futuristic premise, which is that it has become technically possible to enter other people's dreamscapes.\n\nMost of the online debate so far has centred on the meaning of the varied dreamworlds Nolan has created. Three or four competing theories have emerged since the film opened, with some arguing that DiCaprio's character loses all contact with reality, while others contend he remains in a dream throughout the entire story. Still more fans of the film are convinced that Nolan has given us a good old-fashioned happy ending to enjoy.\n\nOne interlocutor, \"Ahmad\", is not persuaded though, pointing out that our hero does not return back up through the required dream levels in his putative return to reality. \"Marvin\" countered last week that he is \"85% sure that the entire movie was Cob performing INCEPTION on himself\", while \"Jo\" argued forcefully an hour later that the whole film has been deliberately constructed like a maze.\n\nThe heated discussions about Inception in so many web forums are best summed by the comments of \"Ryan\" who writes: \"I love the fact that I have read every one of these replies and have gotten absolutely nowhere. It's awesome. Everyone has a very intelligently thought-out reason to what happened and all of them could be possibly true.\"\n\nNolan's real skill, commercially speaking, has probably been to create a film that already functions like the computer game it is soon likely to become and also has enough narrative red herrings to set up a viral avalanche of speculation.\n\nFor French, Nolan's earlier film, Memento, was just as intriguing and more emotionally powerful. A story told backwards through fractured memory, the film managed to make a thriller out of the day-to-day workings of the human mind.\n\nThe trick, deployed in Inception, of leaving the story open-ended with a final twist also has a good film pedigree, French argues. Since Antonioni's work, filmmakers have been aping the techniques of Umberto Eco, the literary exponent of the \"open text\". Films such as L'Avventura (1960) and Blow-Up (1966) then in Passenger (1975), made a virtue of leaving clues unanswered and discrepancies unexplained.\n\n\"The danger, of course, if you break things up too much,\" said French, \"is that people begin to stop caring about what happens.\"\n\nCertainly, though, Nolan's final twist of the knife in Inception prompted a communal, appreciative groan in at least one London cinema last week. And now, as the hit film's content is digested by its public, a new, more sophisticated interpretation is gaining currency. Some enthusiasts and critics believe that the film is about the process of making a film, rather like Fellini's celebrated 8½.\n\nCritic Jonathan Romney has noted that \"Inception is its own in-flight movie\", but some are going further still. According to this theory, DiCaprio represents the director, with the young student architect, played by Ellen Page, standing for the screenwriter, and, of course, their intended dreaming target represents the audience. In the end then, the best response to questions about the meaning of Inception may prove to be \"...and then I woke up and it was all a film.\""
