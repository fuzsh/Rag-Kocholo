The \"Dark Knight\" director hopes to shoot the sci-fi action film in the summer for a release during summer 2010.\n\nNolan will produce with partner Emma Thomas, who served as a producer on The Dark Knight.\n\n\"Chris Nolan is a visionary filmmaker who continually raises the bar with each movie he makes,\" Warner Bros. Pictures Group president Jeff Robinov said. \"We are thrilled to be collaborating again with him and Emma on this exciting new motion picture.\"\n\nInception is described as \"a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind.\"\n\nThis pushes back any potential filming on a third Batman film, but three years -- and The Prestige -- passed between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Nolan has also long been attached to direct a big-screen adaptation of the British TV series \"The Prisoner\" for producer Scott Stuber at Universal.\n\nPersonally, I'm excited. As long as Nolan is still on for Batman 3 I don't mind him doing other side projects.\n\nTheMutt92 said:\n\nAlas, no. And sad to say Memento as well. I've seen all of his others and most of Insomnia.\n\nThe report says it will be sci-fi. We all know Nolan is a big fan of Bladerunner... any thoughts on that?\n\nI've never seen Following either.\n\nAbout the sci-fi vibe: Memento and Insomnia have a rather 'otherworldly' aura to them - certainly from the lead character's viewpoint.\n\nOf all his movie's, The Dark Knight is, oddly, possibly, the most human and identifiably of-this-earth.\n\nYouNeverKnow said:\n\nI didn't like Insomnia too much but he's had a string of good since then.\n\nI think the main reason for that may be that he had no hand in writing it (as far as I know).\n\nInteresting sidenote: this is truly the first ORIGINAL screenplay Nolan has ever written. All of his others have been adapted from comics or novels (Memento was adapted from his brothers short story before it was published).\n\nTheMutt92 said:\n\nI think the main reason for that may be that he had no hand in writing it (as far as I know).\n\nInteresting sidenote: this is truly the first ORIGINAL screenplay Nolan has ever written. All of his others have been adapted from comics or novels (Memento was adapted from his brothers short story before it was published).\n\nYes, because the original Norwegian Insomnia was terrible.\n\nThe Man said:\n\nNolan is one of those directors I feel can be trusted in the descisions he makes, just like in casting Heath as the Joker. Though I do admit, Ellen Page? Perhaps in a role like she was in Hardy Candy (I think that was the movie).\n\nIt'd be interesting to see if past Nolan stars will appear (particualry Oldman, Eckhart, and Murphy).\n\nCotillard? Page? Murphy? Yes!\n\nhttp://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=54152\n\nCotillard, Murphy and Page Joining Inception\n\nSource: Variety April 2, 2009\n\nWarner Bros. is in talks with Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy and Ellen Page to join the cast of Inception, which Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) wrote and will direct as his next film.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio has already been set to star. Production begins this summer for a July 16, 2010 release.\n\nThe subject matter has been kept under tight wraps, with the studio describing the film as a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind.\n\nNolan will produce with Emma Thomas.\n\nNolan is reteaming with Murphy, who played Scarecrow in Batman Begins, with a cameo in The Dark Knight.\n\nNice to see Nolan reaching out to new and former cast members of his, particualry Murphy who I had listed as a Nolan actor I'd like to see return.\n\nTheMutt92 said:\n\nIt'd be interesting to see if past Nolan stars will appear (particualry Oldman, Eckhart, and Murphy).\n\n\"Will you be wanting the Michael Caine, Sir..?\"\n\n“I think there might be a part for me,” Caine told MTV News.\n\nGiven Caine and Nolan’s history together and Nolan’s fondness for bringing back past collaborators, Caine’s prediction is an easy sell. And verification should be on its way soon.\n\n“I will know this week if I’m going to be in it,” Caine said.\n\nThe Man said:\n\n\"Will you be wanting the Michael Caine, Sir..?\"\n\nNo offense to Caine, he's a great actor and all (especially in Nolan's films), but lately his attention in the press seems to be full of BS and such. He might just be having some fun w/ the reporters, but I don't know... alot of the 'news' on Batman 3 has come from his theories (which are pretty outlandish), though like I said, he could just be having fun.\n\nAnd if he is cast, this will be looking to be one of the strangest castings for any sci-fi film in recent memory...\n\nTheMutt92 said:\n\nNo offense to Caine, he's a great actor and all (especially in Nolan's films), but lately his attention in the press seems to be full of BS and such.

Just a tiny part,\" he said. \"Chris and I are very good friends so I'll do that little part. I think I'll work about three days.\""
