The report also says that Inception will be filming in Los Angeles, London, Paris, Tangiers and Calgary. Also, screenwriter David Goyer (The Dark Knight) recently spoke with IGN about a third installment to Nolan’s Batman films. Goyer stated that in regards to Nolan to “talk to him after principle photography on Inception is done.”\n\nI am a fan of all of Nolan’s work Batman or not. I can’t wait for this film and the fact that it has begun shooting makes me just that more excited."
