        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Audie Bock, author of ''Japanese Film Directors,'' was assistant producer of the international film version of Akira Kurosawa's ''Kagemusha,'' and has translated Mr. Kurosawa's autobiography, scheduled for publication in 1982. By AUDIE BOCK\n\n''Modern technology and and I do not get along,'' says Akira Kurosawa. ''My son tells me I look like a chimpanzee when I try to dial the telephone, and it would be hopeless for me to try to drive a car.''\n\nDespite his disclaimer, the internationally famous 71-year-old Japanese director, renowned for such films as ''Rashomon,'' ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ikiru'' has long been regarded not only as a great artist with profound influence on such younger American counterparts as Francis Coppola and George Lucas, but also as one of the movies' foremost technical innovators.\n\nNext Friday, Mr. Kurosawa will be present in New York City to introduce the first complete English-subtitled retrospective of 26 of his films at the Japan Society of New York. Mr. Kurosawa's work has been stimulating Western audiences since his 1950 ''Rashomon'' first drew attention to the cinema of Japan by winning an award at the Venice International Film Festival.\n\nThis film, which tells the story of rape-murder over and over again, each t ime from a different point of view, so caught the world's imagi nation that it became an Off Broadway play and later a Hollywood wes tern under the title, ''The Outrage,'' directed by Martin Ritt. Even today the expression ''Rashomon syndrome'' can occasionally be heard from psychologists and political commentators.\n\nBefore any of his contemporaries, Kurosawa-the-technical-innovator made highly effective use of telephoto lenses and multiple cameras, beginning with ''Seven Samurai''; and 70-millimeter beginning with ''Dersu Uzala.'' He quickly earned a reputation with his crew as ''the world's greatest editor,'' because of his practice of editing late at night during the shooting, whenever a batch of rushes comes up, so that he can put a fine cut on a film in as little as three weeks, as in last year's Japanese version of ''Kagemusha''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
