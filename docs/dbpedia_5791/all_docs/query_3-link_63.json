        "text": "logline: A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\n\nSource: IMDb\n\nA dream within a dream within a dream within a… you get the point. Maybe it’s because I’m a sucker for some world-building, but I really enjoy Inception. It gets a lot of flack for being super convoluted, but it’s a really interesting concept that was translated into an exciting and trippy film. The direction and production are amazing, and there were many moments where you are left shocked at how the Dream Team(hah pun) pulled it off at times, as well as how they pulled off that shot... The soundtrack - composed by Hans Zimmer - complements the film wonderfully, and Inception will ever be attributed to the popularization of the “Braam.” As I said before, people have spoken of the confusion of the movie, along with the opinion that it has too much exposition. I agree that though the movie starts a bit slow in the beginning, it really picks up towards the middle and I can ensure you you will be enthralled by the end. The scenes fit together in a way where you can understand what is going on, but only if you pay attention. Another aspect of the movie I love is the Dream Team themselves. The characters all fit so well together, and their camaraderie and mentions of backstory always sparked my imagination for other jobs they pulled off in the past. Inception is a gift to your imagination, a chance to let go of reality for a little while and stretch your brain. It’s not fantastical in the way Harry Potter or Star Wars is, but possibly even more out there because it feeds you the idea that your own world could be fabricated. Did Christopher Nolan just pull inception on us, the audience? There is so much to explore in this concept, and watching Inception overall is a great movie to strike inspiration in those to, well, dream.\n\nMy Favorite Characters:\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur - I love all of the Dream Team, but I’d have to say Arthur is my favorite. Though he’s a bit of a stickler, Arthur stands as the perfect Point Man for Cobb and trusts him to get the job done no matter the circumstances. I’d love to see what jobs they’ve gotten mixed up in before, as well as some insight on the backstory he seems to have with Eames. Also, his totem - a loaded die - is my favorite out of everyone, and if I had to have any job on a mind heist it’d be his.\n\nTom Hardy as Eames - Sophia’s favorite character, as well as my second favorite, Eames brings a bit of humor to the team. His job as the Forger is one of the coolest, and watching him work was both exciting and funny. He steals the show in the scenes he’s in, and all around is an interesting character to watch.\n\nRated PG-13 for violence and mild language.\n\nFun Fact: The movie’s runtime of two hours and twenty-eight minutes was a reference to the length of the original recording of “Non, je ne regrette rien” by Édith Piaf, a song that is featured on the movie. It’s two minutes and twenty-eight seconds, if that wasn’t clear.\n\nWhere To Watch:"
