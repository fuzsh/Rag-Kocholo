There’s been a scary amount of speculation over Christopher Nolan’s latest project ‘Inception’ and as the film nears release the excitement has grown all the more palpable. At last the full trailer is online (see below) and boy does it look a corker: a thinking man’s existential thriller in The Matrix mould. Rapidly gaining a reputation as a genuine 21st Century auteur, Nolan is yet to turn 40 and already has ‘Memento’, The Prestige’ and ‘The Dark Knight’ under his belt. Overachiever, anyone?

For some time now the only tight lipped information the director or anyone else would give out about the movie was that it was “a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind”. Abstract certainly but understandable. It’s the type of film that spoilers genuinely spoil, so majestic and groundbreaking does it look in terms of high definition camera work and imagery.

Shot in Tokyo, Los Angeles and Tangiers as well as other exotic locations, ‘Inception’ has had money literally thrown at it but Nolan looks as if he’s spent every penny wisely. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Ken Watanabe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the cast alone will be bait enough for some.

Ostensibly De Caprio’s character is a dream thief, venturing into the unconscious mind through means of state of the art technology. To say any more would be a shame. Instead, save up your pennies, get thee to a cinema and prepare to be amazed.

Inception is due for release on 16th July 2010.
