For more information, see R&TC Section 23101 or go to ftb.ca.gov and search for doing business.\n\nBackup Withholding – With certain limited exceptions, payers that are required to withhold and remit backup withholding to the IRS are also required to withhold and remit to the FTB on income sourced to California. If the payee has backup withholding, the payee must contact the FTB to provide a valid Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), before filing the tax return. Failure to provide a valid TIN may result in a denial of the backup withholding credit. For more information, go to ftb.ca.gov and search for backup withholding.\n\nSuspension/Forfeiture – LLCs are suspended or forfeited for failure to file or failure to pay. See General Information V, Suspension/Forfeiture, for more information.\n\nEstimated Fee for LLCs\n\nThe LLC must estimate the fee it will owe for the year and make an estimated fee payment by the 15th day of the 6th month of the current taxable year. LLCs will use form FTB 3536, Estimated Fee for LLCs, to remit the estimated fee. A penalty will apply if the LLCâs estimated fee payment is less than the fee owed for the year. The penalty is equal to 10 percent of the amount of the LLC fee owed for the year over the amount of the timely estimated fee payment. A penalty will not be imposed if the estimated fee paid by the due date is equal to or greater than the total amount of the fee of the LLC for the preceding taxable year.\n\nThe LLC fee remains due and payable by the due date of the LLCâs return. LLCs will use form FTB 3536 to pay by the due date of the LLCâs return, any amount of LLC fee owed that was not paid as a timely estimated fee payment. If the taxable year of the LLC ends prior to the 15th day of the 6th month of the taxable year, no estimated fee payment is due, and the LLC fee is due on the due date of the LLCâs return. See General Information F, Limited Liability Company Tax and Fee, for more information.\n\nLLC Fee\n\nThe LLC fee is based on total California source income rather than on worldwide total income. For more information, see Schedule IW, LLC Income Worksheet Instructions.\n\nSeries LLC\n\nA series LLC is a single LLC that has separate allocations of assets each within its own series.

Only the first series to pay tax or file a return may use a California Secretary of State (SOS) file number. On all other series, enter zeros for the entity identification number on the first voucher and we will assign a number and notify each series. Get FTB 3556 LLC MEO, Limited Liability Company Filing Information, for more information.\n\nPaid Preparer Authorization\n\nAn LLC can designate a paid preparer to discuss the tax return with the FTB. For more information see General Information M, Signatures.\n\nBusiness Entity Name and Identification Number\n\nIn order to expedite processing, be sure to use the business entity name as it appears with the California SOS and a valid California identification number.\n\nProviding California and Federal Returns\n\nThe FTB may request copies of California or federal returns that are subject to or related to a federal examination. Generally, the California statute of limitations is four years from the due date of the return or from the date filed, whichever is later. However, the statute is extended in situations in which an individual or a business entity is under examination by the IRS. For more information concerning the extended statute of limitations, due to a federal examination, see General Information J, Amended Return.\n\nThe FTB recommends keeping copies of returns and records that verify income, deductions, adjustments, or credits reported, for at least the minimum time required under the statute of limitations. However, some records should be kept much longer. For example, members should keep records substantiating their basis in an LLC and LLCs should keep records to figure the basis of its assets.\n\nFederal/State Differences\n\nFor LLCs classified as partnerships, California tax law generally conforms to federal tax law in the area of partnerships (IRC, Subchapter K – Partners and Partnerships).

A material advisor is required to provide a reportable transaction number to all taxpayers and material advisors for whom the material advisor acts as a material advisor.\n\nFor more information, go to ftb.ca.gov and search for disclosure obligation.\n\nClaim of Right\n\nIf the LLC had to repay an amount that was included in income in an earlier year, under a claim of right, the LLC may be able to deduct the amount repaid from its income for the year in which it was repaid. Or, if the amount the LLC repaid is more than $3,000, the LLC may be able to take a credit against its tax for the year in which it was repaid. For more information, see the Repayments section of federal Pub. 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\n\nCalifornia Tax Information on the Internet\n\nYou can download, view, and print California tax forms and publications at ftb.ca.gov/forms.\n\nFederal Tax Information on the Internet\n\nThe IRS has federal forms and publications available to download, view, and print at irs.gov.\n\nState Agenciesâ Websites\n\nAccess other California state agency websites at ca.gov.\n\nJoint Agency Website\n\nFor additional business tax information, go to taxes.ca.gov, sponsored by the Board of Equalization (BOE), California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA), Employment Development Department (EDD), the FTB, and the IRS.\n\nB. Introduction\n\nLLCs combine traditional corporate and partnership characteristics. LLC members are afforded all of the following:\n\nLimited liability with the extent of a memberâs liability limited to the memberâs equity investment.\n\nFlexible management alternatives.\n\nLiberal membership qualification requirements.\n\nLLCs classified as partnerships for tax purposes generally will determine their California income, deductions, and credits under the Personal Income Tax Law. They will be subject to an annual tax as well as the LLC fee based on total California income. See General Information F, Limited Liability Company Tax and Fee, and Schedule IW instructions for more information.\n\nLLCs organized in California are vested with all the rights and powers enjoyed by a natural person in carrying out business affairs. However, California law does not allow the formation or registration of LLCs (foreign or domestic) in California to render any type of professional service for which a license, certification, or registration is required under the Business and Professions Code or the Chiropractic Act, with the exception of insurance agents and insurance brokers.\n\nCalifornia law requires LLCs not organized in the state of California to register with the California SOS before entering into any intrastate business in California. The laws of the state or foreign country in which the LLC is organized generally govern the internal affairs of the LLC. The California SOS may not deny recognition of an LLC because the laws of the organizationâs home state or foreign country differ from Californiaâs laws, except in the case of professional service LLCs, which are not allowed to register as LLCs in California.\n\nFor more information about organizing and registering an LLC, contact:\n\nMail:\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State\n\nBusiness Entities Section\n\nPO Box 944260\n\nSacramento, CA 94244-2600\n\nTelephone:\n\n916-657-5448\n\nor go to sos.ca.gov.\n\nC. Purpose\n\nUse Form 568 to:\n\nDetermine the amount of the LLC fee (including a disregarded entityâs fee) based on total California income.\n\nReport the LLC fee.\n\nReport the annual tax.\n\nReport and pay any nonconsenting nonresident membersâ tax.\n\nReport income, deductions, gains, losses, etc., from the operation of a multiple member LLC that has elected to be classified as a partnership.\n\nUse Form 568 as the return for calendar year 2023 or any fiscal year beginning in 2023.\n\nD. Who Must File\n\nAn LLC may be classified for tax purposes as a partnership, a corporation, or a disregarded entity. The LLC should file the appropriate California return.\n\nForm 568 must be filed by every LLC that is not taxable as a corporation if any of the following apply:\n\nThe LLC is doing business in California.\n\nThe LLC is organized in California.\n\nThe LLC is organized in another state or foreign country, but registered with the California SOS.\n\nThe LLC has income from California sources (Nonregistered foreign LLCs, see Exceptions to Filing Form 568, below).\n\nAn LLC is not required to file a tax return and is not subject to the annual tax and LLC fee if both the following are true:\n\nThe LLCâs taxable year is 15 days or less.\n\nThe LLC did not conduct business in the state during the 15 day period.\n\nRegistration\n\nLLCs that are formed in California, are required to file articles of organization with the California SOS before doing business in this state.\n\nLLCs organized under the laws of another state or foreign country are required to register with the California SOS before entering into intrastate business in California.\n\nNonregistered foreign LLCs that are members of an LLC doing business in California or general partners in a limited partnership doing business in California are considered doing business in California.\n\nRegardless of where the trade or business of the LLC is primarily conducted, an LLC is considered to be doing business in California if any of its members, managers, or other agents are conducting business in California on behalf of the LLC.\n\nExceptions to Filing Form 568:\n\nThe LLC elected to be taxed as a corporation for federal tax purposes.\n\nThe LLC is a single member limited liability company (SMLLC) that was treated as an association taxable as a corporation prior to January 1, 1997, for California tax purposes, and did not elect to change that tax treatment in the current taxable year.\n\nNonregistered foreign (i.e., not organized in California) LLCs (excluding disregarded entities/single member LLCs) that are not doing business, but are deriving income from California or filing to report an election on behalf of a California resident, file Form 565 instead of Form 568.\n\nA single-member, nonregistered foreign (i.e., not organized in California) LLC classified as disregarded which is not doing business in California, need not file Form 565 or Form 568.\n\nLLCs classified as a general corporation file Form 100, California Corporation Franchise or Income Tax Return. LLCs classified as an S corporation file Form 100S, California S Corporation Franchise or Income Tax Return. For LLCs classified as disregarded entities, see General Information S, Check-the-Box Regulations.\n\nThe LLC is still required to file Form 568 if the LLC is registered in California even if both of the following apply:\n\nThe LLC is not actively doing business in California.\n\nThe LLC does not have California source income.\n\nThe LLCâs filing requirement will be satisfied by doing all of the following:\n\nCompleting Form 568 with all supplemental schedules.\n\nCompleting and attaching California Schedules K-1 (568) for members with California addresses.\n\nWriting âSB 1106 Filingâ in black or blue ink at the top of Form 568, Side 1.\n\nEntering the total number of members in Question K on Side 2 of the Form 568.\n\nCertain publicly traded partnerships treated as corporations under IRC Section 7704 must file Form 100.\n\nA resident member of an out-of-state LLC taxed as a partnership not required to file Form 568, may be required to furnish a copy of federal Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, to substantiate the memberâs share of LLC income or loss.\n\nE. When and Where to File\n\nAn LLC must file Form 568, pay any nonconsenting nonresident membersâ tax, and pay any amount of the LLC fee owed that was not paid as an estimated fee with form FTB 3536, by the original due date of the LLCâs return.\n\nFor LLCs classified as partnerships, the original due date of the return is the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of the taxable year.\n\nSMLLCs\n\nFor SMLLCs owned by pass-through entities (S corporations, partnerships, and LLCs classified as partnerships), the original due date of the return is the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of the taxable year.\n\nFor all other SMLLCs, the original due date of the return is the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the taxable year of the owner.\n\nFor more information, see R&TC Section 18633.5.\n\nWhen the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline to file and pay without penalty is extended to the next business day.\n\nExtensions\n\nCalifornia does not require the filing of written applications for extensions. All LLCs in good standing that are classified as partnerships have an automatic seven month extension to file. If the LLC cannot file its Form 568 by the returnâs due date, the LLC is granted an automatic seven month extension unless the LLC is suspended or forfeited.\n\nSMLLCs disregarded for tax purposes will be granted an automatic six month extension, with the exception of an SMLLC owned by a partnership or an LLC that is classified as a partnership for California tax purposes, which will be granted an automatic seven month extension. For more information see R&TC Section 18567.\n\nHowever, the automatic extension does not extend the time to pay the LLC fee or nonconsenting nonresident membersâ tax.\n\nIf the LLC is filing the return under extension see form FTB 3537, Payment for Automatic Extension for LLCs to submit the required payments.\n\nPAYMENTS\n\nMail Form 568 with payment to:\n\nMail\n\nFranchise Tax Board\n\nPO Box 942857\n\nSacramento, CA 94257-0501\n\nE-Filed returns: Pay electronically using Web Pay, credit card, EFW, or mail form FTB 3588, Payment Voucher for LLC e-filed Returns, with payment to:\n\nMail\n\nFranchise Tax Board\n\nPO Box 942857\n\nSacramento, CA 94257-0531\n\nUsing black or blue ink, make the check or money order payable to the âFranchise Tax Board.â Write the LLCâs California SOS file number, FEIN, and â2023 Form 568â on the check or money order.\n\nNote: The California SOS file number is 12 digits long.\n\nMake all checks or money orders payable in U.S. dollars and drawn against a U.S. financial institution.\n\nDo not attach a copy of the return with the balance due payment if the LLC already filed a return for the same taxable year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nMail Form 568 requesting a refund to:\n\nMail\n\nFranchise Tax Board\n\nPO Box 942857\n\nSacramento, CA 94257-0500\n\nRETURN WITHOUT PAYMENT or PAID ELECTRONICALLY\n\nMail Form 568 without a payment or paid electronically to:\n\nMail\n\nFranchise Tax Board\n\nPO Box 942857\n\nSacramento, CA 94257-0500\n\nElectronic Funds Withdrawal\n\nLLCs can make an annual tax, estimated fee, or extension payment using tax preparation software. Check with your software provider to determine if they support EFW for annual tax, estimated fee, or extension payments.\n\nAnnual Limited Liability Company Tax\n\nIf the 2023 annual tax of $800 was not paid on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the beginning of the taxable year (fiscal year) or April 15, 2023 (calendar year), the tax should be sent using the 2023 form FTB 3522, as soon as possible. Do not use the 2024 form FTB 3522.\n\nIf the LLCâs taxable year is 15 days or less and it did not conduct business in the state during the 15 day period, see the instructions for Exceptions to Filing Form 568 in General Information D, Who Must File.\n\nAlso see General Information G, Penalties and Interest, for the additional amount that is now due. To assure proper application of the tax payment to the LLC account, do not send the $800 annual tax with Form 568.\n\nThe 2024 $800 annual tax is due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the beginning of the 2024 taxable year (fiscal year) or April 15, 2023 (calendar year). The payment is sent with form FTB 3522. Do not mail the $800 annual tax with Form 568. When the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline to file and pay without penalty is extended to the next business day.\n\nFor taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021 and before January 1, 2024, an LLC that organizes, registers, or files with the Secretary of State to do business in California is exempt from the annual LLC tax in its first taxable year.\n\nPrivate Delivery Services\n\nCalifornia law conforms to federal law regarding the use of certain designated private delivery services to meet the âtimely mailing as timely filing/payingâ rule for tax returns and payments. See the instructions for federal Form 1065 for a list of designated delivery services. If a private delivery service is used, address the return to:\n\nMail\n\nFranchise Tax Board\n\nSacramento, CA 95827\n\nCaution: Private delivery services cannot deliver items to PO boxes. If using one of these services to mail any item to the FTB, Do not use an FTB PO box.\n\nF. Limited Liability Company Tax and Fee\n\nThe definition of limited liability company has been revised to exclude certain title holding companies that are tax exempt provided that they are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for tax purposes. As such they are not liable for the annual LLC tax and fee.\n\nEnter all payment types (overpayment from prior year, annual tax, fee, etc.) made for the 2023 taxable year on the applicable line of Form 568.\n\nAnnual Limited Liability Company Tax\n\nLLCs are subject to an $800 annual tax if they are doing business in California or have articles of organization accepted, or a certificate of registration issued by the California SOS. The annual tax is prepaid for the privilege of doing business in California, and is due and payable on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the beginning of the taxable year. The annual tax must be paid for each taxable year until the appropriate papers are filed. See General Information Q, Cancelling a Limited Liability Company, for more information.\n\nUse form FTB 3522 to submit the $800 annual tax payment. Using black or blue ink, make the check or money order payable to the âFranchise Tax Board.â Write the LLCâs California SOS file number, FEIN, and â2024 FTB 3522â on the check or money order.\n\nIf the 15th day of the 4th month of an existing foreign LLCâs taxable year has passed before the existing foreign LLC commences business in California or registers with the California SOS, the annual tax should be paid immediately after commencing business or registering with the California SOS.\n\nExemption from First Taxable Year Annual LLC Tax – For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021 and before January 1, 2024, an LLC that organizes, registers, or files with the Secretary of State to do business in California is exempt from the annual LLC tax in its first taxable year.\n\nDeployed Military Exemption – For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and before January 1, 2030, an LLC that is a small business solely owned by a deployed member of the United States Armed Forces shall not be subject to the annual tax if the owner is deployed during the taxable year and the LLC operates at a loss or ceases operation. LLCs exempt from the annual tax should print âDeployed Militaryâ in black or blue ink in the top margin of the tax return.\n\nFor the purposes of this exemption:\n\n(A) âDeployedâ means being called to active duty or active service during a period when the United States is engaged in combat or homeland defense. âDeployedâ does not include either of the following:\n\nTemporary duty for the sole purpose of training or processing.\n\nA permanent change of station.\n\n(B) âOperates at a lossâ means an LLCâs expenses exceed its receipts.\n\n(C) âSmall businessâ means an LLC with two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or less of total income from all sources derived from or attributable to California.\n\nIf the LLC is claiming Deployed Military Exemption, enter zero on line 2 and line 3 of Form 568. See the Specific Instructions for Form 568 for more details.\n\nLimited Liability Company Fee\n\nIn addition to the annual tax, every LLC must pay a fee if the total California annual income is equal to or greater than $250,000. For more information, see Schedule IW instructions.\n\nThe LLC must estimate the fee it will owe for the year and make an estimated fee payment by the 15th day of the 6th month of the current taxable year. LLCs use form FTB 3536, to remit the estimated fee. A penalty will apply if the LLCâs estimated fee payment is less than the fee owed for the year. The penalty is equal to 10 percent of the amount of the LLC fee owed for the year over the amount of the timely estimated fee payment. A penalty will not be imposed if the estimated fee paid by the due date is equal to or greater than the total amount of the fee of the LLC for the preceding taxable year.\n\nThe LLC fee remains due and payable by the due date of the LLCâs return. LLCs will use form FTB 3536 to pay by the due date of the LLCâs return, any amount of LLC fee owed that was not paid as a timely estimated fee payment. If the taxable year of the LLC ends prior to the 15th day of the 6th month of the taxable year, no estimated fee payment is due, and the LLC fee is due on the due date of the LLCâs return. Use the following chart to compute the fee:\n\nIf total California annual income from Form 568, Side 1, line 1 is: Equal to or over – but not over – The fee is: $250,000 $499,999 $900 500,000 999,999 2,500 1,000,000 4,999,999 6,000 5,000,000 and over 11,790\n\nIf you have a total California annual income of $250,000 or greater, you must report a fee.\n\nTo determine the LLC fee see the Specific Line Instructions for line 1.\n\nIf the FTB determines multiple LLCs were formed for the primary purpose of reducing fees, the LLCâs total income from all sources that are reportable to California could include the aggregate total income of all commonly controlled LLC members. âCommonly controlledâ means control of more than 50 percent of the capital interests or profit interests of the taxpayer and any other LLC or partnership by the same persons.\n\nSeries LLCs\n\nIf the laws of the state where the LLC is formed provide for the designation of series of interests (for example, a Delaware Series LLC) and: (1) the holders of the interests in each series are limited to the assets of that series upon redemption, liquidation, or termination, and may share in the income only of that series, and (2) under home state law, the payment of the expenses, charges, and liabilities of each series is limited to the assets of that series, then each series in a series LLC is considered a separate LLC and must file its own Form 568 and pay its own separate LLC annual tax and fee, if it is registered or doing business in California.\n\nNonconsenting Nonresident Membersâ Tax\n\nEvery nonresident member must sign a form FTB 3832, Limited Liability Company Nonresident Membersâ Consent. The LLC returns the signed form with Form 568. If a nonresident member fails to sign form FTB 3832, the LLC is required to pay tax on that memberâs distributive share of income at the highest marginal rate. Any amount paid by the LLC will be considered a payment made by the nonresident member.\n\nThe tax may be reduced by the amount of tax previously withheld and paid by the LLC with respect to each nonconsenting nonresident member.\n\nReminder: All nonresident members must file a California tax return. The completion of form FTB 3832 does not satisfy the nonresident memberâs California filing requirement. Corporate members are also considered doing business in California and may have additional filing requirements. For more information, get FTB Pub. 1060, Guide for Corporations Starting Business in California. Nonresident individuals may qualify to file a group Form 540NR, California Nonresident or Part-Year Resident Income Tax Return, and should get FTB Pub. 1067, Guidelines for Filing a Group Form 540NR.\n\nIf the LLCâs return is being filed on or before the original due date of the return, the LLC completes the Schedule T, Nonconsenting Nonresident (NCNR) Membersâ Tax Liability. See the Specific Instructions for Schedule T for more information.\n\nIf the LLC owes NCNR tax and is unable to complete Form 568 on or before the original due date, it must complete form FTB 3537. For more information on when the NCNR membersâ tax along with the voucher must be received by, see form FTB 3537.\n\nG. Penalties and Interest\n\nFailure to Comply with Filing Requirements\n\nUnless failure is due to a reasonable cause, a penalty will be assessed if the LLC is required to file a Form 568 and either of the following apply:\n\nThe LLC fails to file the return on time, including extensions.\n\nThe LLC files a return, including Schedules K-1 (568), that fails to show all the information required.\n\nThe amount of the penalty for each month, or part of a month (for a maximum of twelve months), that the failure continues, is $18 multiplied by the total number of members in the LLC during any part of the taxable year for which the return is due. Interest will be charged on the penalty from the date the notice of tax due is mailed until the date the return is filed.\n\nFor âsmall partnerships,â as defined in IRC Section 6231, the federal exception to the imposition of penalties for failure to file partnership returns does not apply for California purposes. For more information, see R&TC Section 19172.\n\nFailure to File a Timely Return\n\nAny LLC that fails to file Form 568 on or before the extended due date is assessed a penalty. The penalty is 5 percent of the unpaid tax (which includes the LLC fee and nonconsenting nonresident membersâ tax) for each month, or part of the month, the return remains unfiled from the due date of the return until filed. The penalty may not exceed 25 percent of the unpaid tax. If an LLC does not file its return by the extended due date, the automatic extension will not apply and the late filing penalty will be assessed from the original due date of the return. See R&TC Section 19131 for more information.\n\nFailure to Pay by the Due Date\n\nThe failure-to-pay penalty is imposed from the due date of the return or the due date of the payment. Since any amount of the LLC fee due which was not paid as an estimated fee payment, and the nonconsenting nonresident membersâ tax are due with the return, the penalty is calculated from the original due date of the return. The annual tax payment date is the 15th day of the 4th month during the taxable year, so the penalty is calculated from this date. The penalty for each item is calculated separately.\n\nThe failure-to-pay penalty begins at 5 percent. Every month or fraction thereof the amount is not paid the penalty increases 0.5 percent. The penalty continues to increase for 40 months, thereby maximizing at 25 percent. See R&TC Section 19132 for more information.\n\nIf an LLC is subject to both the penalty for failure to file a timely return and the penalty for failure to pay the total tax by the due date, a combination of the two penalties may be assessed, but the total penalty may not exceed 25 percent of the unpaid tax. However, the penalty for failure to comply with the filing requirements will be assessed in addition to the penalty for failure to file a timely return and the penalty for failure to pay the total tax by the due date. The FTB may waive the late payment penalty based on reasonable cause. Reasonable cause is presumed when 90 percent of the tax is paid by the original due date of the return.\n\nIf the LLC underpays the estimated fee, a penalty of 10 percent will be added to the fee. The underpayment amount will be equal to the difference between the total amount of the fee due for the taxable year less the amount paid by the due date. A penalty will not be imposed if the estimated fee paid by the due date is equal to or greater than the total amount of the fee of the LLC for the preceding taxable year.\n\nInterest\n\nInterest is due and payable on any tax due if not paid by the original due date. Interest is also due on some penalties. The automatic extension of time to file does not stop interest from accruing. California follows federal rules for the calculation of interest. Get FTB Pub. 1138, Business Entity Refund/Billing Information, for more information.\n\nOther Penalties/Fees\n\nA penalty may also be charged if a payment is returned for insufficient funds. In addition, fees may be charged for the cost of collection.\n\nH. Accounting Methods\n\nCompute ordinary income or loss by the accounting method regularly used to maintain the LLCâs books and records. This method must clearly reflect the LLCâs income or loss.\n\nLLCs given permission to change their accounting method for federal purposes should see IRC Section 481 for information relating to the adjustments required by changes in accounting method.\n\nGenerally, an LLC may not use the cash method of accounting if the LLC has a corporate member, averages annual gross receipts of more than $5 million, or is a tax shelter. For exceptions, see IRC Section 448.\n\nThe mark-to-market accounting method is required for securities dealers. The IRC Section 481 adjustment is taken into account ratably over five years beginning with the first income year.\n\nI. Accounting Periods\n\nLLC returns normally must be filed for an accounting period that includes 12 full months. A short period return must be filed if the LLC is created or terminated within the taxable year. In that case, write âShort Periodâ in black or blue ink at the top of Form 568, Side 1.\n\nFor information on the required taxable year of a partnership that also applies to LLCs, see the instructions for federal Form 1065.\n\nJ. Amended Return\n\nIf, after the LLC files its return, it becomes aware of changes it must make, the LLC should file an amended Form 568 and an amended Schedule K-1 (568) for each member, if applicable. Check the amended return box in Item H(3) Form 568, Side 1. Give a corrected Schedule K-1 (568) with box G(2) checked and label âAmendedâ to each affected member. If the LLC originally filed a Form 540NR group nonresident member return, the LLC should file an amended Form 540NR.\n\nAttach a statement that identifies the line number of each amended item, the corrected amount or treatment of the item, and an explanation of the reason(s) for each change.\n\nIf the LLCâs federal return is changed for any reason, the federal change may affect the LLCâs California return. This would include changes made because of an examination. The LLC must file an amended return within six months of the final federal determination if the LLC fee or tax a member owes has been affected. The LLC should attach a copy of the federal Revenue Agentâs Report or other notice of the adjustments to the return. The LLC should inform the members that they may also be required to file amended returns within six months from the date of the final federal determination.\n\nK. Required Information Returns\n\nEvery LLC must file information returns if, in the course of its trade or business, any of the following occur:\n\nThe LLC makes payments to one person of rents, salaries, wages, annuities, or other fixed or determinable income during one calendar year totaling $600 or more.\n\nThe LLC pays an individual or one payee interest and dividends totaling $10 or more during one calendar year.\n\nThe LLC receives cash payments over $10,000.\n\nPayments of any amount by a broker, dealer, or barter exchange agent must also be reported.\n\nLLCs must report payments made to California residents by providing copies of federal Form 1099 (series). For nonresidents, see the reporting and withholding requirements on Form 592, Resident and Nonresident Withholding Statement; Form 592-B, Resident and Nonresident Withholding Tax Statement, Form 592-F, Foreign Partner or Member Annual Return, Form 592-PTE. Get FTB Pub. 1017, Resident and Nonresident Withholding Guidelines, for more information.\n\nLLCs must submit a copy of federal Form 8300, Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business, within 15 days after the date of the transaction.\n\nLLCs must report interest paid on municipal bonds that are issued by a state other than California or a municipality other than a California municipality that are held by California taxpayers. Entities paying interest to California taxpayers on these types of bonds are required to report interest payments aggregating $10 or more paid after January 1, 2022. Information returns will be due June 1, 2023. For more information, get form FTB 4800 MEO, Interest and Interest-Dividend Payment Reporting Requirement Letter.\n\nLLCs must use form FTB 3834, Interest Computation Under the Look-Back Method for Completed Long-Term Contracts, to report interest due or to be refunded under the look-back method on long-term contracts. If you are filing form FTB 3834 to compute the interest due or to be refunded under the Look-Back method, attach a copy of form FTB 3834 to Form 568.\n\nAny information returns required for federal purposes under IRC Sections 6038, 6038A, 6038B, and 6038D are also required for California purposes. Attach the information returns to the Form 568 when filed. If the information returns are not provided, penalties may be imposed under R&TC Sections 19141.2 and 19141.5.\n\nAll information returns, unless otherwise noted, are mailed separately from the Form 568. Information returns should be sent to:\n\nMail\n\nFranchise Tax Board\n\nPO Box 942857\n\nSacramento, CA 94257-0500\n\nL. Special Items\n\nCalifornia LLC tax law generally follows federal partnership tax law for LLCs classified as partnerships, in all of the following areas:\n\nIRC Section 702(a) items\n\nElections\n\nDistributions of unrealized receivables and inventory\n\nMembersâ dealings with the LLC\n\nContributions to the LLC\n\nIncome of foreign nonresident members subject to withholding, Form 592-A, Form 592-B, and Form 592-F\n\nBasis and at-risk rules\n\nPassive activity limitations\n\nNet operating loss deduction by a member of the LLC (an LLC is not allowed the deduction)\n\nPublicly traded partnerships\n\nLong-term contracts\n\nInstallment sales\n\nVacation pay\n\nAmortization of past service costs\n\nDistributions of contributed property by an LLC\n\nRecognition of precontribution gain in certain LLC distributions to members\n\nSee the instructions for federal Form 1065 for specific information about these areas.\n\nM. Signatures\n\nForm 568 is not considered a valid return unless it is signed by an authorized member or manager of the LLC. If a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or assignee controls the organizationâs property or business, that individual must sign the return.\n\nInclude an authorized member or managerâs phone number and email address in case the FTB needs to contact the LLC for information needed to process this return. By providing this information the FTB will be able to process the return or issue the refund faster.\n\nPaid Preparerâs Information\n\nAnyone who is paid to prepare the LLC return must sign the return and complete the âPaid Preparerâs Use Onlyâ area of the return.\n\nAll of the following must be completed by the paid preparer:\n\nComplete the required preparer information. Tax preparers must provide their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).\n\nSign in the space provided for the preparerâs signature.\n\nGive the LLC a copy of the return in addition to the copy to be filed with the FTB.\n\nAn individual who prepares the return and does not charge the LLC should not sign the LLC return.\n\nPaid Preparer Authorization\n\nIf the LLC wants to allow the paid preparer to discuss its 2023 Form 568 with the FTB, check the âYesâ box in the signature area of the return. This authorization applies only to the individual whose signature appears in the âPaid Preparerâs Use Onlyâ section of the return. It does not apply to the firm, if any, shown in that section.\n\nIf the âYesâ box is checked, the LLC is authorizing the FTB to call the paid preparer to answer any questions that may arise during the processing of its return. The LLC is also authorizing the paid preparer to:\n\nGive the FTB any information that is missing from the return.\n\nCall the FTB for information about the processing of the return or the status of any related refund or payments.\n\nRespond to certain FTB notices about math errors, offsets, and return preparation.\n\nThe LLC is not authorizing the paid preparer to receive any refund check, bind the LLC to anything (including any additional tax liability), or otherwise represent the LLC before the FTB.\n\nThe authorization will automatically end no later than the due date (without regard to extensions) for filing the LLCâs 2024 tax return. If the LLC wants to expand the paid preparerâs authorization, go to ftb.ca.gov/poa. If the LLC wants to revoke the authorization before it ends, notify the FTB in writing or call 800-852-5711.\n\nN. Group Returns\n\nNonresident Group Returns\n\nNonresident members of an LLC doing business or deriving income from sources in California may elect to file a group nonresident return (R&TC Section 18535).\n\nGroup nonresident returns may include less than two nonresident individuals.\n\nNonresident individuals with more than $1,000,000 of California taxable income are eligible to be included in group nonresident returns.\n\nAn additional 1% tax will be assessed on resident and nonresident individuals who have California taxable income over $1,000,000.\n\nGet FTB Pub. 1067, Guidelines for Filing a Group Form 540NR, for more information.\n\nO. LLC Investment Partnerships\n\nIncome of nonresident members, including banks and corporations, derived from âqualifying investment securitiesâ of an LLC that qualifies as an âinvestment partnershipâ is considered income from sources other than California, except as noted Nonresident individuals or foreign members generally will not be taxed on this income. The LLC should inform its nonresident individuals or foreign members if all or a portion of their distributive share of income is from âqualifying investment securitiesâ of an âinvestment partnershipâ and whether it is sourced to California. See the instructions for Question L for definitions of âinvestment partnershipâ and âqualifying investment securities.â\n\nHowever, for apportioning purposes, income from an LLC that is an investment partnership (LLC investment partnership) is generally considered business income (see Appeal of Estate of Marion Markus, Cal. St. Bd. of Equal., May 6, 1986). LLC investment partnerships that are doing business within and outside California should apportion California source income using California Schedule R. LLC investment partnerships that are doing business solely within California should treat all business income of the LLC investment partnership as California source income.\n\nLLC investment partnerships that have California source income should show on Schedule K-1 (568), column (e) each memberâs distributive share of California source income.\n\nGenerally, members who are nonresident individuals would not record this income as California source income. However, there are two exceptions to the general rule when a nonresident individual may have California source income from an LLC investment partnership. Nonresident individual members will be taxed on their distributive shares of income from the âLLC investment partnershipâ if the income from the qualifying investment securities is interrelated with either of the following:\n\nAny other business activity of the nonresident member.\n\nAny other entity in which the nonresident member owns an interest that is separate and distinct from the investment activity of the partnership and that is conducted in California.\n\nNonresident individual members will be taxed on their distributive share of investment income from an LLC investment partnership if the qualifying securities were purchased with working capital of a trade or business the nonresident owns an interest in and that is conducted in California (R&TC Section 17955).\n\nCorporations that are members in an LLC investment partnership are not generally taxed on their distributive share of LLC income, provided that the income from the LLC is the corporationâs only California source income. However, the corporation will be taxed on its distributive share of California source income from the LLC if either of the following apply:\n\nThe corporation participates in the management of the investment activities of the LLC investment partnership.\n\nThe corporation has income derived from or attributable to sources within this state other than income from the LLC investment partnership.\n\nP. Nonresident Members\n\nAn LLC with multiple members is required to file form FTB 3832 with Form 568 when one or more of its members is a nonresident of California. Form FTB 3832 is signed by the nonresident individuals and foreign entity members to show their consent to Californiaâs jurisdiction to tax their distributive share of income attributable to California sources.\n\nFile form FTB 3832 for either of the following:\n\nThe first taxable period for which the LLC became subject to tax with nonresident members.\n\nAny taxable period during which the LLC had a nonresident member who has not signed a form FTB 3832.\n\nSeparate forms for an individual (or groups of individuals) are permissible. The LLC must maintain and have available for examination a form FTB 3832 signed by each nonresident member.\n\nThe LLC must pay the tax for every nonresident member that did not sign a form FTB 3832. The LLC is responsible for paying the tax on that nonresident memberâs distributive share of income determined at the highest marginal rate for that member. See General Information F, Limited Liability Company Tax and Fee, for more information.\n\nThe tax may be reduced by the amount of tax previously withheld and paid by the LLC with respect to each nonconsenting nonresident member.\n\nIf the LLC fails to timely pay the tax of such nonresident member, the LLC shall be subject to penalties and interest (R&TC Sections 19132 and 19101). Any amount paid by the LLC on behalf of a nonresident individual or foreign entity member will be considered a payment made by the member.\n\nAn LLC may recover from the nonresident member the tax it paid on behalf of the nonresident member.\n\nTo claim credit for the tax, the nonresident member needs to attach a copy of the Schedule K-1 (568) to their California income tax return.\n\nNonresidents or Part-Year Residents\n\nNonresidents pay tax to California only on their California taxable income. For more information, get FTB Pub. 1100, Taxation of Nonresidents and Individuals Who Change Residency.\n\nCAUTION: The requirements and procedures discussed above are not related to the nonresident withholding requirements discussed under General Information R, Withholding Requirements.\n\nQ. Cancelling a Limited Liability Company\n\nIn general, LLCs are required to pay the $800 annual tax and file a California return until the appropriate papers are filed. In order to cancel an LLC, the following steps must be taken:\n\nFile a timely final California return (Form 568) with the FTB and pay the $800 annual tax for the taxable year of the final return.\n\nFile Form LLC-4/7, Certificate of Cancellation, with the California SOS. The California SOS also requires a domestic LLC to file Form LLC-3, Certificate of Dissolution. Contact the California SOS for more details.\n\nThe Form LLC-4/7âs effective date will stop the assessment of the $800 annual tax for future taxable years. If Form LLC-4/7 is filed after the taxable year ending date, a subsequent year return and an additional $800 tax may be required.\n\nThe annual tax will not be assessed if the LLC meets all of the following requirements:\n\nThe LLC files a timely Final Limited Liability Company Return of Income, for the preceding taxable year, including extension.\n\nThe LLC did not do business in California after the final taxable year.\n\nThe LLC files the appropriate documents for cancellation with the California SOS within 12 months of the timely filed Final Limited Liability Company Return of Income.\n\nShort Form Cancellation\n\nDomestic LLCs organized in California can file a Limited Liability Company Form LLC-4/8, Short Form Cancellation Certificate, if the following requirements are met:\n\nForm LLC-4/8 is being filed within 12 months from the date the Articles of Organization were filed with the SOS.\n\nThe domestic LLC has no debts or other liabilities (other than tax liability).\n\nThe known assets have been distributed to the persons entitled thereto or no known assets have been acquired.\n\nThe final tax return or a final annual tax return has been or will be filed with the FTB.\n\nThe domestic LLC has not conducted any business from the time of the filing of the Articles of Organization.\n\nA majority of the managers or members, or if there are no managers or members, the person or a majority of the persons who signed the Articles of Organization, voted to dissolve the domestic LLC.\n\nIf the domestic LLC received payments for interests from investors, those payments have been returned to those investors.\n\nThe LLC must file SOS Form LLC-4/8, with the SOS. The LLC must include a statement that all of the items above have been completed before the California SOS will cancel the LLC. If available, attach an endorsed SOS filed copy of Form LLC-4/8 to the first tax return.\n\nFor more information on how to cancel your LLC:\n\nWhere to File: Completed forms along with the applicable fees, if any, can be mailed to:\n\nBy mail:\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State\n\nBusiness Entities Filing Unit\n\nPO Box 944260\n\nSacramento, CA 94244-2600\n\nor delivered in person (drop off) to the Sacramento office:\n\nIn person:\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State\n\nBusiness Entities Filing Unit\n\n1500 11th Street\n\nSacramento, CA 95814\n\nThis form is filed only in the Sacramento office.\n\nBy phone:\n\n916-657-5448\n\nOffice hours are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (excluding state holidays).\n\nWebsite:\n\nsos.ca.gov\n\nIf the LLC is being canceled to be converted to another type of business entity, be sure to file the appropriate forms with the California SOS.\n\nGet FTB Pub. 1038, Guide to Dissolve, Surrender, or Cancel a California Business Entity, for more information.\n\nShort Period Return\n\nIf the LLC is filing a short period return for 2023 and the 2023 forms are not available, the LLC must use the 2022 Form 568 and change the taxable year.\n\nR. Withholding Requirements\n\nForeign (non U.S.) Nonresident Members\n\nAs described in IRC Section 1446 and modified by R&TC Section 18666, if an LLC has any income or gain from a trade or business within California, and if any portion of that income or gain is allocable under IRC Section 704 to a foreign (non U.S.) nonresident member, the LLC is required to withhold tax on the allocable amount.\n\nState and Federal Differences Regarding Foreign (non U.S.) Nonresident Members\n\nCalifornia generally conforms to IRC Section 1446 and corresponding federal rulings and procedures. The main differences between California and federal laws in this area are:\n\nThe California withholding rate is 8.84% for C corporations and 12.3% for individuals, partnerships, LLCs, and fiduciaries.\n\nIncome attributable to the disposition of California real property is subject to withholding under R&TC Section 18662.\n\nDomestic (U.S.) Nonresident Members\n\nAn LLC is required to withhold funds for income or franchise taxes when it makes a distribution of income to a domestic (U.S.) nonresident member (R&TC Section 18662). This includes prior year income that should have been, but was not previously reported as income from California sources on the memberâs California income tax return. However, withholding is not required if distributions of income from California sources to the member are $1,500 or less during the calendar year or if the FTB directs the payer not to withhold.\n\nDomestic (U.S.) nonresident members include individuals who are nonresidents of California and corporations that are not qualified to do business in California or do not have a permanent place of business in California. Domestic nonresident members also include nonresident estates, trusts, partnerships, and LLCs that do not have a permanent place of business in California. Foreign nonresident members covered under R&TC Section 18666 are not domestic nonresident members.\n\nLLCs with income from both within and outside California must make a reasonable estimate of the ratio, to be applied to the distributions, that approximates the ratio of California source income to total income. The ratio for the prior year will generally be accepted as reasonable in determining the California part of the distribution subject to withholding. LLCs are required to withhold tax at a rate of 7 percent of distributions (including property) of income from California sources made to domestic nonresident members. For more information, get Schedule R.\n\nThe FTB has administrative authority to allow reduced withholding rates, including waivers, when requested in writing. These authorizations may be one-time, annual, or for a longer period. Waivers or reduced withholding rates will normally be approved when distributions are made by publicly traded partnerships and on distributions to brokerage firms, tax-exempt organizations, and tiered LLCs.\n\nNo withholding of tax is required if the distribution is a return of capital or does not represent taxable income for the current or prior years. Although a waiver is not required in this situation, if upon examination the FTB determines that tax withholding was required on a distribution, the LLC may be liable for the amount that should have been withheld including interest and penalties.\n\nSend waiver requests and inquiries to:\n\nMail:\n\nWithholding Services and Compliance, MS F182\n\nFranchise Tax Board\n\nPO Box 942867\n\nSacramento, CA 94267-0651\n\nTelephone:\n\n888-792-4900 or\n\n916-845-4900\n\nWaivers may also be submitted online. Go to ftb.ca.gov and search for 588 online.\n\nReport withholding on Forms 592, 592-B, 592-F, and 592-PTE. Withholding payments are remitted with Forms 592-A, 592-Q, and 592-V, Payment Voucher for Resident and Nonresident Withholding.\n\nThe taxable income of nonresident members is the distributive share of California sourced LLC income, not the distributed amount. For more information, get FTB Pub. 1017.\n\nThe nonresident withholding requirements and procedures discussed above are not related to the nonconsenting nonresident membersâ tax paid by an LLC on behalf of nonresident members as discussed under General Information P, Nonresident Members.\n\nS. Check-the-Box Regulations\n\nCalifornia generally conforms to the federal entity classification regulations (commonly known as âcheck-the-boxâ regulations). These regulations allow certain unincorporated entities to choose tax treatment as a partnership, a corporation, or a single member LLC (SMLLC) (SB 1234; Stats. 1997, Ch. 608).\n\nGenerally, any elections made for federal purposes under the federal âcheck-the-boxâ regulations are treated as California elections. No separate elections are allowed. If federal Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, is filed with the federal return, a copy should be attached to the electing entityâs California return for the year in which the election is effective. The entity should file the appropriate California return.\n\nAn âeligible entityâ may choose its classification. An eligible entity is a business entity that is not a trust, a corporation organized under any federal or state statute, a foreign entity specifically listed as a per se corporation, or other special business entities. Other special business entities under the IRC include publicly traded partnerships, REMICs, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs), or regulated investment companies (RICs). An eligible entity with two or more owners will be a partnership for tax purposes unless it elects to be taxed as a corporation. For tax purposes, an eligible entity with a single owner will be disregarded. If the separate existence of an entity is disregarded, its activities are treated as activities of the owner and reported on the appropriate California return.\n\nExceptions\n\nThe exception to the general rule exists under R&TC Section 23038(b)(2)(C) in the case of an eligible business entity.\n\nThe exception does not apply to a business entity which, during the 60 month period preceding January 1, 1997, was appropriately classified as an association taxable as a corporation and met all of the following conditions:\n\nThe business entity was not doing business in California.\n\nThe business entity did not derive income from sources within California.\n\nThe business entity had no members who were residents of California.\n\nThe eligible business entities are generally:\n\nBusiness trusts that were classified as corporations under California law, but were classified as partnerships for federal tax purposes for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.\n\nPreviously existing foreign SMLLCs that were classified as corporations under California law but claimed to be partnerships for federal tax purposes for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1997.\n\nThese business trusts and previously existing foreign SMLLCs will continue to be classified as corporations for California tax purposes and must continue to file Form 100, unless they make an irrevocable election to be classified or disregarded the same as they are for federal tax purposes. See form FTB 3574, Special Election for Business Trusts and Certain Foreign Single Member LLCs, and Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18 sections 23038(a)-(b).\n\nCalifornia regulations make the classification of business entities under federal regulations (Treas. Reg. Sections 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3) generally applicable to California. If an eligible entity is disregarded for federal tax purposes, it is also disregarded for state tax purposes, except that an SMLLC must still pay a tax and fee, file a return, and limit tax credits.\n\nFiling Requirements for Disregarded Entities\n\nAn SMLLC is required to complete Form 568, Side 1, Side 2, Side 3, Side 7 (Schedule IW), and pay the annual tax and LLC fee (if applicable). If a nonresident has not signed the single member LLC consent on Side 3, then the SMLLC is required to complete Schedule T on Side 4.\n\nHowever, if either of the following two items below are met, Schedule B and Schedule K are also required to be filed:\n\nThe income or loss amount reported on Schedule B, line 1 or line 3 through line 11, is $3,000,000 or more.\n\nThe âTotal distributive income/payment items,â Schedule K, line 21a, is greater than or equal to $3,000,000 OR less than or equal to $-3,000,000.\n\nNote: If the SMLLC does not meet the 3 million criteria for filing Schedule B (568) and Schedule K (568), the SMLLC is still required to complete Schedule IW.\n\nIf Schedule K (568) is required to be filed, disregarded entities should prepare Schedule K (568) by entering the amount of the corresponding Memberâs share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc. attributable to the activities of the disregarded entity from the memberâs federal Form 1040 or 1040-SR, including Schedules B, C, D, E, F, and Federal Schedule K, or Federal Form 1120 or 1120S (of the owner). SMLLCs do not complete Schedule K-1 (568). The single owner would include the various items of income, deductions, credits, etc., of the SMLLC on the tax return filed by the owner.\n\nUtilization of credits attributable to the SMLLC is limited to the regular tax liability on the income attributable to the activities of the SMLLC. The limitation on the SMLLCâs credits is the difference between: 1) The regular tax liability of the single owner computed with the items of income, deductions, etc., attributable to the SMLLC; and 2) The regular tax liability of the single owner computed without the items of income, deductions, etc., attributable to the SMLLC. It is the responsibility of the single owner to limit the credits on the ownerâs tax return. The single owner should be prepared to furnish information supporting the use of any credits attributable to the SMLLC.\n\nThe owner of the SMLLC should perform the following steps to determine the SMLLCâs credit limitation:\n\nCompute the ownerâs tax with the SMLLC income, and the ownerâs tax without the SMLLC income.\n\nComplete Schedule P (100, 100W, 540, 540NR, or 541), up to the line where the credit is to be taken.\n\nDetermine the credit to be utilized. The amount allowed is the lesser of either of the following:\n\nThe total credit or the limitation based on the LLCâs business income.\n\nThe net tax balance that may be offset by credits on Schedule P (100, 100W, 540, 540NR, or 541) on the line above the line where the credit is to be taken.\n\nThe following example shows the credit limit calculation for an SMLLC that is owned by a C corporation. The SMLLC has a Research credit of $4,000. The computation of the C corporationâs regular tax liability with the SMLLC income is $5,000. The computation of the C corporationâs regular tax liability without the SMLLC income is $3,000. The difference in tax is $2,000, which is the C corporationâs credit limitation on all LLC credits. The owner of the SMLLC then performs the following steps:\n\nCompletes Schedule P (100), Side 2, down to line 4, column (c). The amount is $1,000.\n\nEnters the limitation amount from Schedule P (100), Side 2, line 4, column (c) in column (f) of the table below.\n\nEnters the following amounts from the table below on the Schedule P (100):\n\n$4,000 from column (d) of the table below, to Schedule P (100), Side 2, line 5, column (a);\n\n$1,000 from column (f) of the table below, to Schedule P (100), Side 2, line 5, column (b);\n\n$3,000 from column (g) of the table below, to Schedule P (100), Side 2, line 5, column (d).\n\nT. Substitute Schedules\n\nThe LLC needs approval from the FTB to use a substitute Schedule K-1 (568). The substitute schedule must include the Memberâs Instructions for Schedule K-1 (568) or other prepared specific instructions. For more information and access to form FTB 1096, Agreement to Comply with FTB Pub. 1098, Annual Requirements and Specifications; or FTB Pub. 1098, Annual Requirements and Specifications for the Development and Use of Substitute, Scannable, Absolute Positioning, and Reproduced Tax Forms, email the FTBâs Substitute Forms Program at SubstituteForms@ftb.ca.gov.\n\nU. Property Subject to IRC Section 179 Recapture\n\nCalifornia will follow the revised federal instructions (with some exceptions) for reporting the sale, exchange, or disposition of property for which an IRC Section 179 expense deduction was claimed in prior years by a partnership, LLC, or S corporation.\n\nIf there is gain from the sale, exchange, or disposition of property for which an IRC Section 179 expense deduction was claimed in a prior year, special rules apply. Members should follow the instructions in federal Form 4797, Sales of Business Property.\n\nLLCs should follow the instructions in federal Form 4797 with the exception that the amount of gain on property subject to the IRC Section 179 recapture must be included in the total income for the LLC.\n\nThe gain on property subject to the IRC Section 179 recapture should be reported on the Schedule K (568) and Schedule K-1 (568) as supplemental information as instructed on the federal Form 4797.\n\nThe LLC must provide all of the following information with respect to a disposition of business property if an IRC Section 179 expense deduction was claimed in prior years:\n\nDescription of the property.\n\nDate the property was acquired and placed in service.\n\nDate the property was sold or other disposition.\n\nGross sales price or amount realized.\n\nCost or other basis plus expense of sale (not including the entityâs basis reduction in the property due to IRC Section 179 expense deduction).\n\nDepreciation allowed or allowable (not including the IRC Section 179 expense deduction).\n\nAmount of IRC Section 179 expense deduction (if any).\n\nAn indication if the disposition is from a casualty or theft.\n\nIf this is an installment sale, compute the installment amount by using the method provided in form FTB 3805E, Installment Sale Income.\n\nV. Suspension/Forfeiture\n\nIf an LLC does not file Form 568 and/or does not pay any tax, penalty, or interest due, its powers, rights, and privileges may be suspended (in the case of a domestic LLC) or forfeited (in the case of a foreign LLC). Also, any contracts entered into during suspension or forfeiture are voidable at the request of any party to the contract other than the suspended or forfeited LLC. Such contracts will remain voidable and unenforceable unless the LLC applies for relief from contract voidability and the FTB grants relief. See R&TC Sections 23301, 23305.1, and 23305.2, for more information.\n\nW. California Use Tax\n\nGeneral Information\n\nUse tax has been in effect in California since July 1, 1935. It applies to purchases of property from out-of-state sellers and is similar to sales tax paid on purchases made in California. If the LLC has not already paid all use tax due to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, it may be able to report and pay the use tax due on its state income tax return. However, LLCs required to hold a California sellerâs permit or to otherwise register with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration for sales and use tax purposes may not report use tax on their state income tax return. See the information below and the instructions for line 13 of the income tax return.\n\nIn general, LLCs must pay California use tax on purchases of merchandise for use in California, made from out-of-state sellers, for example, by telephone, online, by mail, or in person.\n\nLLCs must pay California use tax on taxable items if:\n\nThe seller does not collect California sales or use tax, and\n\nThe LLC uses, gifts, stores, or consumes the item in California.\n\nExample: The LLC purchases a conference table from a company in North Carolina. The company ships the table from North Carolina to the LLCâs address in California for the LLCâs use, and does not charge California sales or use tax. The LLC owes use tax on the purchase.\n\nHowever, not all purchases require the LLC to pay use tax. For example, the LLC would include purchases of office equipment, but not exempt purchases of food products or prescription medicine.\n\nFor more information on nontaxable and exempt purchases, the LLC may refer to Publication 61, Sales and Use Taxes: Tax Expenditures, on the California Department of Tax and Fee Administrationâs website at cdtfa.ca.gov.\n\nFor more information about California use tax, refer to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administrationâs website at cdtfa.ca.gov and type âFind Information About Use Taxâ in the search bar.\n\nComplete the Use Tax Worksheet to calculate the amount due.\n\nExtensions to File. If the LLC requests an extension to file its tax return, wait until the LLC files its tax return to report the purchases subject to use tax and to make the use tax payment.\n\nInterest, Penalties, and Fees. Failure to timely report and pay use tax due may result in the assessment of interest, penalties, and fees.\n\nApplication of Payments. For purchases made during taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2015, payments and credits reported on an income tax return will be applied first to the use tax liability, instead of income tax liabilities, penalties, and interest.\n\nChanges in Use Tax Reported. Do not file an Amended Limited Liability Company Return of Income to revise the use tax previously reported. If the LLC has changes to the amount of use tax previously reported on the original tax return, contact the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.\n\nFor assistance with use tax questions, go to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administrationâs website at cdtfa.ca.gov or call their Customer Service Center at 800-400-7115 (CRS:711) (for hearing and speech disabilities). For California income tax information, contact the Franchise Tax Board at ftb.ca.gov.\n\nSpecific Instructions\n\nForm 568\n\nFill In All Applicable Lines and Schedules\n\nEnter any items specially allocated to the members on the applicable line of the memberâs Schedule K-1 (568) and the total amounts on the applicable lines of Schedule K (568). Do not enter these items directly on Form 568, Side 4, Schedule A or Schedule D (568). Do not apply the apportionment factor to the items on Schedule K (568).\n\nWhole numbers should be shown on the return and accompanying schedules.\n\nName, Address, California SOS File Number, and FEIN\n\nBefore mailing, make sure entries have been made for all of the following:\n\nCalifornia SOS file number (12 digits)\n\nFederal employer identification number (FEIN) (9 digits)\n\nLLC legal or trade name (use legal name filed with the California SOS) and address, include Private Mail Box (PMB) number, if applicable.\n\nUse the Additional Information field for âOwner/Representative/Attentionâ name and other supplemental address information only.\n\nForeign Address\n\nIf the limited liability company has a foreign address, follow the countryâs practice for entering the city, county, province, state, country, and postal code, as applicable, in the appropriate boxes. Do not abbreviate the country name.\n\nItem G – Total Assets at End of Taxable Year\n\nSee the instructions for Schedule L – Balance Sheets – before completing this item.\n\nIf the LLC is required to complete this item, enter the total assets at the end of the LLCâs taxable year. This is determined by the accounting method regularly used to maintain the LLCâs books and records. If there are no assets at the end of the taxable year, enter $0.\n\nItem H(2) – Final Return\n\nIf the LLC is filing a final year tax return, check the âFinal Returnâ box on Form 568, Side 1, Item H(2), and check the âA final Schedule K-1 (568)â box for Item G(1) on Schedule K-1 (568). Attach a statement that explains the reason for the termination or liquidation of the partnership.\n\nItem H(4) – Protective claim\n\nCheck the box if this Form 568 is being filed as a protective claim for refund. A protective claim is a claim for refund filed before the expiration of the statute of limitations for which a determination of the claim depends on the resolution of some other disputed issues, such as pending state or federal litigation or audit.

The questions provide information regarding changes in control or ownership of legal entities owning or under certain circumstances leasing California real property (R&TC Section 64). (Real property includes land, buildings, structures, fixtures – see R&TC Section 104).\n\nIf any of the answers are âYes,â a Statement of Change in Control and Ownership of Legal Entities, must be filed with the State of California; failure to do so within 90 days of the event date will result in penalties. The form for this statement is form BOE-100-B, filed with the California State Board of Equalization. Get this form and information from the BOE website (boe.ca.gov) by searching for Legal Entity Ownership Program (LEOP).\n\nThere may be a change in ownership or control if, during this year, one of the following occurred with respect to this LLC (or any legal entity in which it holds a controlling or majority interest):\n\nThe percentage of ownership interests transferred to or owned or controlled by, one person or one legal entity cumulatively exceeded 50%.\n\nThe total ownership interests transferred to or held by one irrevocable trust or trust beneficiary cumulatively exceeded 50%.\n\nThis LLC, (or any legal entity in which it holds a controlling or majority interest,) cumulatively acquired ownership or control of more than 50% of the LLC or other ownership interests in any legal entity.\n\nAs of the end of this year, cumulatively more than 50% of the total ownership interests have been transferred in one or more transactions since an interest in California real property was transferred to the LLC that was excluded from property tax reassessment under R&TC Section 62(a)(2) which established an original co-ownersâ interest status.\n\nFor purposes of these questions, leased real property is a leasehold interest in taxable real property: (1) leased for a term of 35 years or more (including renewal options), if not leased from a government agency; or (2) leased for any term, if leased from a government agency. For LLCâs, ownership interest is measured by a memberâs interest in both the capital and profits interests in the LLC.\n\nR&TC Section 64(e) requires this information for use in determining whether a change in ownership has occurred under section 64(c) and (d); it is used by the LEOP.\n\nSchedule IW, LLC Income Worksheet Instructions\n\nFor purposes of this worksheet, âTotal California Incomeâ means total income from all sources derived from or attributable to this state. The definition of total income for purposes of calculating the LLC fee excludes all allocations, distributions, or gains from another LLC that was already subject to the LLC fee. âTotal incomeâ means gross income, plus the cost of goods sold that are paid or incurred in connection with the trade or business of the taxpayer attributed to California. Total income from all sources derived or attributable to this state is determined using the rules for assigning sales under R&TC Sections 25135 and 25136 and the regulations thereunder, as modified by regulations under R&TC Section 25137, if applicable, other than those provisions that exclude receipts from the sales factor.\n\nIf the SMLLC does not meet the 3 million criteria for filing Schedule B (568) and Schedule K (568), the SMLLC is still required to complete Schedule IW. Disregarded entities that do not meet the filing requirements to complete Schedule B or Schedule K should prepare Schedule IW by entering the California amounts attributable to the disregarded entity from the memberâs federal Schedule B, C, D, E, F (Form 1040), or additional schedules associated with other activities. For example, if an SMLLC has IRC Section 1231 gains, the SMLLC will need to get the amount from the schedule containing that information, such as Schedule D-1, and enter the amount on line 14 of the Schedule IW.\n\nDetermining Total Income From All Sources Derived From or Attributable to California.\n\nUse only amounts that are from sources derived from or attributable to California when completing lines 1-17 of this worksheet. If the LLC business is wholly within California, the total income amount is assigned to California and is entered on Schedule IW. If the LLC conducts business within and outside of California, the LLC must assign its total income, item by item, to California based on the following rules:\n\nSales of Tangible Property\n\nTotal income from sales of tangible personal property with a destination in California (except sales to the U. S. Government) are attributable to California if the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser within California regardless of the freight on board point or other conditions of sale. Total income from sales of tangible personal property (except sales to the U.S. Government) which are shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage within California are assigned to California unless the seller is taxable in the state of destination. Any transportation of goods by vehicle is a form of shipment, whether the vehicle is owned by the seller, the purchaser, or a common carrier. If a seller transfers possession of goods to a purchaser at the purchaserâs place of business in California, the sale is a California sale. However, if goods are transferred to the purchaserâs employee or agent at some other location in California and the purchaser immediately transports the goods to another state, the sale is not a California sale. (See FTB Legal Ruling 95-3).\n\nTotal income from sales of tangible personal property to the U.S. Government are attributable to California if the property is shipped from California even if the taxpayer is taxable in the state of destination. Only sales for which the U.S. Government makes direct payment to the seller according to the terms of a contract constitute sales to the U.S. Government. Thus, as a general rule, sales by a subcontractor to the prime contractor, the party to the contract with the U.S. Government, do not constitute sales to the U.S. Government.\n\nSales of Other Than Sales of Tangible Personal Property\n\nMarket As"
