        "text": "The paper covers a theoretical approach in data acquisition needed for design of a retaining wall. The procedure is more of a general summary and an appreciation of the role of subsurface exploration in geotechnical design. I hope to update it later after being involved in an actual field project.\n\nThis paper presents two case histories, wherein double twisted hexagonal wire mesh crates and netting are used as a solution for geotechnical problems that aroused while execution. One of which is worldwide known and one of the most prestigious projects of India Konkan Railway, and second is internationally noted tourist spotAmby Valley Sahara lake city. In Konkan Railway project, double twisted wire mesh crates were used for variety of problems like rock fall prevention, Gravity walls at the base of rock slopes, Baby Gabions as ballast for railway tracks, Platform Gabions etc. Adoption of Gabions and rock fall netting was one of its types of innovative solutions for this project. For Amby Valley Sahara lake city project, global instability of high cuttings in soil and heavy landslides were the major geotechnical problems. Many traditional solutions have failed at the site. Gabion retaining walls were adopted of heights ranging from 2 m to 13 m. Though there were failures due to fau..."
