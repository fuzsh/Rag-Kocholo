        "text": "LimeWire is making its triumphant return with the help of a Soulja Boy classic.\n\nLast week, on July 7, the former file sharing client announced it will be returning in an all new form, different from its origins as an illegal music downloading hotbed. In the video promotion, two kids are shown leaving school and excitedly rushing home to download Soulja Boy's 2007 hit \"Crank Dat (Soulja Boy),\" which scores the commercial. The video then cuts to the two kids as adults. In a similar situation, they rush home to get on LimeWire. Only this time, they are going on the site to check on an NFT purchase.\n\nThe commercial closes with the message, \"LimeWire is back. Your place for music NFTs.\"\n\nSoulja Boy has reposted his fans' responses to the ad on Twitter.\n\n\"This man brought limewire back. Legendary,\" one person posted.\n\n\"First Rapper to bring Limewire back in 2022,\" another person wrote."
