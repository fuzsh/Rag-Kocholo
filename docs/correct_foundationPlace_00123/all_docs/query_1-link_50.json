It will also offer higher download and upload speeds ranging from 50/25 Mbps to 250/50 Mbps without service charge increases;\n\nCRSTTA will increase outreach and education efforts to inform customers about existing federal Lifeline and EBB programs; and\n\nCRSTTA will develop a “Digital Awareness and Training Program” to increase digital literacy among Tribal communities and households within its service area.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe project’s expected outcome is to increase the number of Tribal households and institutions to 1,732 that subscribe to broadband services as well as shrink the digital divide that exists among Tribal communities via digital literacy programs.\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nThe project will benefit 20 different communities that reside within CRSTTA’s service area, covering 4,676 square miles of Tribal lands.\n\nSubrecipient activities if applicable\n\nN/A\n\nChickahominy Indian Tribe\n\nApplicant\n\nChickahominy Indian Tribe\n\nProject Title\n\nThe CIT Broadband Connectivity Program\n\nCity/Town\n\nCharles City, New Kent, Henrico, and James City Counties\n\nState\n\nVirginia\n\nGrant Funding\n\n$500,000.00\n\nProject Purpose/Type\n\nThe Chickahominy Indian Tribe (CIT) will engage in network planning activities to develop a solution for broadband infrastructure connection, construction, and service deployment for currently unserved Chickahominy households, government properties, and community anchor institutions.\n\nActivities\n\nThe project proposes the following activities designed to improve access to, and use of, broadband services among Tribal members:\n\nGathering baseline data and initial stakeholder input to evaluate broadband coverage needs.\n\nUtilizing sources including internet service providers to create broadband mapping.\n\nWorking with stakeholders and internet service providers to identify areas requiring right-of-way permissions.\n\nDeveloping a plan, method, and timeline with internet service providers to implement extension of last-mile broadband access and 1 year of discounted service to approximately 123 eligible Tribal citizen residences in the Tribal service areas of New Kent, Charles City, Henrico, and James City counties.\n\nCreating workflow with internet service provider Comcast for extension of last mile/fiber to the premises for the Tribal Center (an anchor institution).\n\nCreating workflow to implement extension of Wi-Fi to Tribal powwow grounds adjacent to the Tribal Center.\n\nDeveloping a plan, method, and timeline with internet service providers to evaluate and provide broadband service to five Tribal government properties (anchor institutions).\n\nOutcomes\n\nProject outcomes will include a sustainable broadband infrastructure plan to address deployment needs and offer a solution for unserved Tribal citizens and Tribal properties.
