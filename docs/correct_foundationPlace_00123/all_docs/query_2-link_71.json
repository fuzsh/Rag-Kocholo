        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve access to vision care and eyeglasses for all Americans through a self-serve, rapid vision exam kiosk for retail stores and public spaces. An estimated 175 million Americans suffer from blurry vision, of which 30 million live without eyeglasses. By partnering with retailers, pharmacies, and supermarkets, the company has the potential to reach a large number of Americans via a network of kiosks spread across the US. With 70% of the population benefitting from eyeglasses, the development of the company?s rapid vision exam kiosk aims to democratize vision care and eliminate the gap in easily accessible vision exams.\n\nThis project develops a gaze-independent, contactless autorefractor technology (GIPR) for use in a self-serve and autonomous vision exam kiosk. Gaze-camera misalignment is a leading contributor to accuracy drift in autorefractors using the retinal reflex method. Eliminating the gaze alignment requirement marks a significant milestone in the company?s development. The GIPR design refracts the inner visual field in a single capture, thus providing a measurement of refractive error at the subject?s foveal position. Building on the success of the Phase I feasibility project, this Phase II project will continue the development of the GIPR module towards commercial readiness by optimizing hardware layout and improving data processing pipeline throughput.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in deploying an easy-to-use roof monitoring system. This affordable high-performance geolocated wireless monitoring system detects unsafe loads and movements on buildings, especially flat commercial rooftops found on schools, distribution centers, office buildings, malls, factories, arenas, apartments, condominiums, and warehouses. This project will innovate scientific and technological advancements that realize the promise of the Internet of Things, generating not just useful products demanded by the marketplace but products that can save lives and fundamentally improve life cycle infrastructure management. The affordability of our technology directly benefits disadvantaged communities, especially in rural areas where resources are severely limited, and serious infrastructure and substandard building problems tend to linger for years. In 2015, it was reported on a major national channel that more than 160 roofs collapsed or faced imminent collapse in Massachusetts alone due to snow load throughout 2014-2015. This SBIR project will inform precisely where unsafe rooftop snow and water loads exist to ensure resources are allocated in advance and as required.\n\nThe proposed project efficiently pinpoints risks in flat roof structures at an affordable cost. All 5.9 million commercial buildings in the USA are vulnerable to the destructive forces of nature and negligence. Out of building failures that occur for known reasons, accumulated ice, snow, and/or liquid water account for 33% of incidents. Dilapidation caused by a lack of maintenance, which makes up 30.7% of known-cause building failures, often develops slowly and is not apparent immediately. Complete or partial building collapses leave occupants at risk of mortal injury and the valuable property contained in the structure lost or damaged. Avoiding damage to large-scale infrastructure will save society significant resources and reduce lost productivity. Even minor collapses impact business continuity, affecting revenues and often the larger community, in the case of grocery stores and similar institutions. The sensor technology improves greatly upon current structural health monitoring methods, limited to single-dimension measurements, higher system costs, and complex installations. The project will develop sets of battery-powered wireless sensors and deploy them across several building rooftops. An intuitive online application will be developed to display building health data and provide users with alerts when loads exceed safety thresholds.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to increase the competitiveness of the US in manufacturing high value parts for shops with high product variety, low volumes, large lead times, and large set up times. The application addresses a need to find the optimal way of utilizing existing resources in order to maximize production rates. The proposed technology may provide an affordable and easy-to-use solution for target markets in aerospace and medical technologies industries. The technology may also help strengthen the national defense of the United States by facilitating onshoring of defense manufacturing by making domestic producers more cost competitive.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a new technology that enables high value manufacturers in optimizing the flow of materials in their shops. For shops with high product variety, low volume, large lead times, and large set up times, there is a need to find the optimal way to utilize existing resources in order to maximize production rate. Most scheduling optimizers are unable to handle this problem reliably or affordably. The newly proposed methods, algorithms, and software may solve this challenge. The business model for delivering this software solution is designed for small and medium size businesses in terms of both cost and usability perspectives. The solution demonstrates double digit improvements in all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as on-time delivery (OTD), inventory turns, and profitability. Phase II work will mature shop optimization software through demonstration in a real aerospace parts factory.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is reducing fuel consumption, improving safety and stability, and reducing the carbon footprint of the trucking industry while increasing profitability. Over 70% of US freight tonnage is moved by trucks. At highway speeds, aerodynamic drag uses over 65% of the total vehicle energy. The proposed device modifies the aerodynamic behavior of semi-trucks using air injection by allowing continuous optimization of aerodynamic performance. This project will bring the pneumatic, sensor and artificial intelligence (AI) control systems from proof-of-concept to commercialization. Having a commercial product capable of determining and delivering the trailer?s best aerodynamic profile based on real-time operating conditions may be a game-changer for the trucking industry, as fuel is a significant operating cost. Commercializing this system has the potential to create an energy savings for all US fleets, saving more than 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel, reducing the release of more than 33.5 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, tripling trucking company profits, and saving an annual $22 billion.\n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes development of an aerodynamic add-on prototype for semi-trucks to save fuel by dynamically changing the trailer?s aerodynamic profile to accommodate diverse operating conditions. Objectives of this SBIR Project are to evolve the device from prototype to the first commercially viable release through system miniaturization and encapsulation, controller optimization, and improved overall system performance, reliability, and safety. Research conducted to miniaturize the overall system footprint will minimize any additional operational impacts, ensuring widespread adoption and utilization that maximizes fuel savings. Research to optimize the Artificial Intelligence-Controller operation will maximize fuel savings because it will allow the device to operate under a broader set of operational conditions. Further development to improve system performance, reliability, and the addition of a safety assist will improve the profit margins of the trucking industry while simultaneously improving on-road safety for the public. The project seeks to deliver 10% savings in operational costs for the trucking industry while improving the efficiency and safety of their country-wide operations.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to deliver an engaging, scalable, and effective social emotional learning platform by integrating soft skills training with major streaming media sites. By leveraging the reach and appeal of popular streaming media platforms with the latest emotion and learning science, the project may lead to improved academic performance, health, and quality of life for America?s youth. The product seeks to benefit mental health professionals and K-12 schools, with potential future areas of growth in corporate training and social emotional skills certification\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve social and emotional skills like emotional literacy, empathy, and resilience among children, adolescents, and young adults at scale. The project aims to deliver a solution that addresses some of the shortcomings of existing social emotional learning (SEL) offerings, namely content quality and diversity. The technology will do so through the development of a platform that integrates SEL directly with major media streaming platforms using a browser extension technology. This technology will make it possible to leverage the wide range of popular content available on those platforms to build critical skills like empathy and emotion regulation. The platform will be powered by a training engine based on established emotion science principles to enable flexibility and personalization. The platform will support user collaboration as well as detailed performance analytics and will be designed to facilitate eventual integration with streaming applications on mobile devices and smart televisions. Efficacy studies will be conducted to evaluate the platform?s impact on social emotional skills.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support industries keen on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. By simplifying the deployment of artificial intelligence technologies, this project allows a broader range of businesses in the manufacturing sector to join the data revolution. It empowers businesses to leverage their existing data assets, leading to enhanced efficiency, fostering a culture of innovation, and carving out a competitive edge in the market. On the commercial front, the benefits are multifold, ranging from bolstered business efficiency and substantial cost reductions to potential market expansion for solutions in artificial intelligence of things. From a societal perspective, this technology contributes substantially to the development of a data-literate 21st-century workforce and strengthens human-technology synergies. The project will drive efficiency and standardization across diverse industries and streamline the process of analyzing and acting upon extensive data sets which will result in improved product quality, fuels innovation, and pave the way for more efficient decision-making processes in an increasingly data-driven world.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the complex challenge of efficiently deploying artificial intelligence models on edge devices for real-time defect detection in industrial manufacturing systems. The problem lies in creating a scalable, efficient, and easy-to-use solution that allows for the wide application of artificial intelligence technologies in Internet of Things devices. The research objectives include developing a modular end-to-end defect detection system, implementing advanced machine learning automation techniques, improving model interpretability, and enhancing model compression for edge devices. The research will leverage machine learning, edge computing, and user feedback to create a practical, robust, and user-friendly solution. The anticipated results include an artificial intelligence of things system that effectively performs real-time defect detection with improved interpretability and reduced resource usage. The expected outcomes comprise an artificial intelligence of things system capable of performing real-time defect detection with elevated interpretability, using minimal computational resources, and revolutionizing defect detection in industrial manufacturing systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to develop a novel technology for the early detection of complications and effective management of kidney disease at home. More than 37 million patients in the US have chronic kidney disease, which is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, hospitalization, premature death, and progression to end-stage kidney disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2018, treating Medicare beneficiaries with chronic kidney disease cost over $81 billion, and approximately 20% of the Medicare budget was spent on kidney disease. This project leverages a medical device and digital tools with advanced analytics capabilities to provide actionable data and key health insights for timely interventions for at-risk patients. There is a rapid shift towards value-based healthcare from the traditional fee-for-service model accelerated by the significant cost burden and poor outcomes, especially in kidney care management. This solution is designed to facilitate this transition seamlessly, lowering unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations, and minimizing exacerbations and associated healthcare costs in a disease condition that contributes over $100 billion in healthcare expenses.\n\nThis STTR Phase II project develops a comprehensive disease management solution for chronic kidney disease by offering a personalized clinical-decision support system for providers as well as a companion diagnostic solution for patients to improve therapeutic benefits. There is a dearth of reliable and accurate predictive tools that can non-invasively measure critical biophysical and biochemical markers to inform clinical care and empower self-identification of undesirable effects. The objective of this research is to develop and validate disruptive technologies for the non-invasive assessment of biomarkers critical to chronic kidney disease diagnosis and management such as hemoglobin levels, electrocardiography (ECG)-based arrhythmia, estimated potassium levels, and lung functions, augmenting the existing capability that measure 10+ vital signs. The innovation also includes a novel concept for any medical device, to record and broadcast personalized messages in a trusted voice (physician/family member), to improve treatment adherence and outcomes. The project further incorporates a proprietary cloud-based analytics system that leverages both subjective and objective data to generate a unique ?digital fingerprint? for effective management and triage. Consistent use of the proposed solution will improve symptoms management, care delivery, and diagnosis, and ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in hospitalizations, total medical expenditure related to morbidity and lost productivity, and patient anxiety.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to help lessen the environmental burden of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Climate change is an urgent environmental challenge and to address it, it is essential to provide alternatives to the use of fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gases. Nearly all the jet fuel or aviation fuel in use today is made from crude oil, which is a fossil fuel. This project provides an alternative technology that makes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using only carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from waste sources, relatively small volumes of water, and renewable (e.g., solar and wind) electricity. Catalysts are one of the key components of the process that is used to produce this SAF, helping the chemical reactions that produce the fuel occur more efficiently. This project will optimize the catalysts for improved production of SAF.\n\nThis STTR Phase II project seeks to significantly improve SAF production by developing and characterizing catalysts that convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into the hydrocarbon constituents in sustainable aviation fuels using advanced characterization techniques such as x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. The process will use catalysts as mimics for photosynthesis, taking air (as a CO2 source), water (as a hydrogen source) and sunlight (as an energy source) and converting them into sustainable chemicals and transportation fuels. The only by-products are oxygen and water. Many other related processes often rely on multiple reaction steps to target the same products. This project develops a novel family of proprietary catalysts to convert CO2 to fuels and chemicals in a single step via a direct CO2 hydrogenation process, enabling yields even greater than the theoretical maximum of legacy processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch. This new process eliminates the need for extra intermediate steps that negatively affect process energy demands, emissions, capital and operational cost, and product selling price. The successful outcome of the project will allow significant improvements in production and economics of sustainable aviation fuels.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the reduction of food waste and improved nutrition. Each year, more than 30% of fresh produce is wasted. The value of this wasted produce is estimated at more than $60 billion globally. This project?s main goal is to extend the shelf life of perishable foods with an edible coating that regulates the rate of both transpiration to slow moisture loss and respiration to delay ripening. The project aims to enable produce growers and distributors to preserve the freshness and quality of fruits and vegetables. Consumers could benefit by having access to fresher, tastier, and more appealing produce. This technology may also promote healthier food choices, especially in currently underserved food deserts. Packers would benefit by being able to offer a high-quality product that will last longer and that can better withstand the rigors of various types of transport. Extended shelf life also extends the market reach of U.S. exports in global markets.\n\nThe core innovation underlying this project is the creation of stable Zein colloids that employ only edible, plant-based ingredients, are non-flammable, non-corrosive, and meet most global food regulations. These colloids will be initially developed as coatings for fresh whole or minimally processed foods, root crops, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. The coating will not impede the delivery of nutrients, flavors, and other functional ingredients that make foods appealing, improve their quality, and encourage consumption. The technology will also reduce food spoilage and improving food safety. Experimental work will be focused on further improving the stability of Zein dispersions and demonstrating the ability to adjust the film properties (water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide permeances) to respond to the physiology of a broad range of crops. This technology will also be piloted at various packing plants to evaluate its operational fitness with existing operations. This research will also enable related applications, such as for compostable coatings on food packaging and pharmaceutical and nutraceutical coatings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader/commercial impact potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the food allergy patient community with a digital platform in order to improve care and support the implementation of emerging food allergy oral immunotherapy treatments. Today there are no cures for food allergies. Patients and their families are in constant fear of anaphylaxis reactions. The proposed technology is a comprehensive platform addressing pain points of food allergy oral immunotherapy, meeting the needs of patients, families, and caregivers. The platform enhances patient treatment adherence and allows healthcare professionals to assess the progress of the patient?s condition remotely and efficiently. Furthermore, the solution provides artificial intelligence analytical capabilities for a systematic approach to food allergy oral immunotherapy that is currently not available. There is a promising commercial opportunity in developing and commercializing such a holistic digital platform. While the platform will enable the creation of a clinical database of food allergy immunotherapy experiences not available previously, it will also shed light on yet unknown factors of food allergy conditions and their potential treatments.\n\nThis project addresses the challenge of patient adherence to oral immunotherapy treatments. Oral immunotherapy is still an emerging treatment that consists of feeding an allergic individual an increasing amount of an allergen, under clinical supervision, with the goal of desensitizing the immune system against the allergen. However, perfect adherence of patients to the treatment plan is essential to ensure safety and enhance treatment efficacy. This platform is the first-ever solution aimed at providing a systematic and comprehensive approach to food allergy immunotherapy treatment. The platform includes an innovative epinephrine auto-injector (EAI) that integrates into an ad-hoc smartphone case and a smartphone app that supports the daily life of food allergy patients. The team will develop a HIPAA-compliant database, a machine learning engine to analyze relevant clinical data and unveil data patterns that allow predicting relevant events in the treatment, a web-based application for allergists to help patients with data management and analyses, and a digital access point for pharmaceutical companies to receive a raw data feed for research and development purposes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a novel, surgically implanted device for treating female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Nearly 50% of women in the U.S. will suffer from stress urinary incontinence with age resulting in over 40 million suffering women by 2050. No pharmacological solutions currently exist and mesh-based midurethral slings (MUS) are the mainstay surgical option, even though they are associated with various long-term complications, challenges, and risks. Furthermore, all SUI repair products on the market are polypropylene mesh-based with no alternatives available. This project aims to address this gap in options with a mesh-free, sling-free, outpatient transvaginal repair device for female urinary incontinence.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and validate a novel, transvaginal surgical procedural technology for treating stress urinary incontinence. This project progresses findings from the SBIR Phase I project which demonstrated functional proof-of-concept biomechanical feasibility. This Phase II project aims to further the surgical procedure and system in a manner suitable for human use. The scope of technical activities includes design optimization, mechanical testing and validation, surgical procedure validation, biocompatibility testing, and histological characterization in a series of benchtop, cadaveric, and animal studies. The scope of the activities will be conducted in accordance with practices needed to demonstrate chronic implanted safety and efficacy in pre-clinical models in order to gain eventual U.S. regulatory approval.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables the use of modern packaging technologies for integrated circuits in space applications. While failures in satellites are common and high insurance claims due to such failures are frequent, the space industry continues to use integrated circuits (ICs) that are either unreliable (non-space-grade) and are prone to failure, or space-grade ICs with large and costly packaging and compromised performance. This innovation offers a cost-effective and reduced-size solution for the packaging of ICs that can operate reliably over the extreme temperature cycles experienced in space applications. Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging (WLCSP) is lighter, smaller, and has superior electrical and thermal performance when compared to traditional leaded packaging solutions. These attributes make it desirable to the space industry by reducing size and weight, while not compromising performance. As this packaging technology is limited due to its performance under temperature cycling, this project seeks to address this reliability problem by using existing manufacturing techniques coupled with a novel design concept.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to redesign specific layers within the existing Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging (WLCSP) to improve reliability under temperature cycling. The temperature cycle reliability problem in the WLCSP is caused by a thermal expansion rate mismatch of silicon die and the copper circuit board. This project will redesign the redistribution layer within the WLCSP to compensate for this mismatch by effectively moving the interconnects on the silicon die in accordance with the faster moving printed circuit board (PCB). This project will make the benefits of WLCSP accessible for the entire space community.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to revolutionize microplastics detection with the development of the first near real-time automated in-situ sensor. Unlike existing sensors that take hours to days for a single sample, this\n\ntechnology promises quick and cost-effective analysis of microplastics abundance in water samples. This technology can enable communities nationwide to monitor drinking water and characterize undersampled environments and sources of human exposure to microplastics pollution. Given the\n\nalarming environmental and human health implications of microplastic contamination, a rapid and affordable sensor is crucial to the NSF?s broader impact goal of advancing the health and welfare of the American public. The commercial sensor caters to scientists, drinking water providers,\n\nmonitoring facilities, conservation organizations, and health professionals, facilitating widespread access to microplastics data.\n\nThe goal of this project is to create an ultrasound-based sensor that can detect and characterize microplastics in water or other fluids. Traditional optical-based methods for microplastic detection are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, and cannot detect the smallest microplastics\n\nthat are most harmful to human health and environmental systems. Traditional ultrasonic particle detectors use reflection and scattering to detect particles based on the material's different bulk modulus (compression resistance) compared to that of the fluid. However, the bulk modulus of\n\nplastic is similar to that of water. This project utilizes a novel detection method inspired by tomography and interferometry to measure spectral differences as a function of concentration and composition of microplastics, even for the smallest of microplastics. The method leverages\n\nobservables from multiple physical processes including scattering, reflection, absorption, attenuation, and resonance in order to empirically map the received ultrasonic energy to concentration and composition of suspended particulates in a fluid sample.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the acceleration of a new technology for the destruction of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS), otherwise known as ?forever chemicals?. PFAS chemicals are widely used in firefighting foams and consumer goods. However, they are incredibly recalcitrant environmental pollutants, highly toxic to humans, and very hard to destroy. Widespread contamination of soil, groundwater, and drinking water at sites near airports, military bases, and manufacturing sites is driving a global effort to remove and destroy PFAS toxins. PFAS are poorly broken down by incineration and they do not have a natural half-life. The environmental remediation industry needs effective technology for on-site, end-of-life destruction of PFAS. The technology being developed in this SBIR Phase II project is energy efficient, scalable, pairs with existing technologies, and can be deployed at-scale for the destruction of PFAS-rich wastes.\n\nThis SBIR Phase II project seeks to reduce technical risks related to system corrosion and chemical consumption in the development and scale-up of the hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT) process for the destruction of PFAS. Hydrothermal processing has historically been plagued by challenges with corrosion and low component lifetimes, and/or has requiring the use of expensive alloys, replaceable system components, and/or elegant chemical corrosion prevention strategies. This said, hydrothermal processes are some of the most effective and efficient technologies for destroying hazardous wastes, such as PFAS. This project will focus on measuring and mitigating the material corrosion challenges to enable more widespread adoption of hydrothermal processes for waste disposal. Additionally, HALT processing requires the use of alkaline chemicals as process additives. In this project, by adopting chemical recycling strategies, the use of chemicals may be drastically reduced, improving overall unit economics and reducing the environmental footprint of HALT processing.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes related to cardiovascular side effects of various treatments. It is currently not possible to test this activity on cells in a petri dish, and mice are not an accurate model for predicting these outcomes in human clinical trials. Rodent lifespans, metabolism and responses to drugs are often very different from those of humans. This project advances a pre-clinical drug screening platform, leading to the development of better and safer drugs.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project improves accurate pre-clinical screening of new pharmaceutical compounds that may trigger unwanted effects on vascular tone and blood pressure. Both hypertension and hypotension can have immediate and long-term life-threatening effects on patients, and are almost always disqualifying for further development of a new drug. As a result, there is a need for improved, human cell-based models to screen vasoactive drugs for human patients. This project advances a platform to accurately mimic physiologically-relevant vasoactivity.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the novel scientific knowledge gained by understanding the effects of high electrostatic fields on composite dielectrics, the translation of experimental materials to robust and high performance HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators, and, more generally, the impact of HASEL actuation technology within real-world applications. This knowledge contributes to many highly interdisciplinary fields of science, ranging from electrostatics, materials science, mechanical engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering. The advancements of HASEL actuators achieved during this project may have broad impacts on commercial, research, education, and defense sectors. These actuators may be an enabling component for a variety of industries including automation, automotive, medical devices, robotics, and defense applications. Key features of HASEL actuators include: analog motion, mechanical compliance, high speed, high strain, silent operation, customization, and self-sensing. By bringing forward actuator technologies, industries may adopt robotic technologies, strengthening the economic competitive advantage of these industries. The team will continue to leverage academic partnerships to contribute to and train a highly capable technical workforce of scientists and engineers.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance the performance of HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators. HASEL actuators harness electrostatic forces to drive shape-change in a soft hydraulic structure, providing a variety of muscle-like actuation modes and the ability to self-sense their deformation state. HASEL actuators address critical problems in existing soft actuator technologies. For example, soft pneumatic actuators must be tethered to a system of valves and pumps for high performance actuation, whereas HASEL actuators are electrically controlled and can be operated with battery-powered portable power supplies. The team will develop and validate approaches to advance the performance and ease of use of HASEL actuators. These advances of the technology will be realized through material optimization, fabrication improvements, and a more fundamental understanding of solid-liquid composite dielectric structures under high electrostatic fields. Performance improvements will be applied to actuators well-suited for industrial, consumer, defense, and experimental applications.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the outcomes for upwards of 500,000 Americans each year who undergo shoulder soft tissue repair surgeries. Shoulder repair surgeries have an unacceptably high failure rate of around 25% and lack effective, economical, and easy-to-use treatment options in this $7B market. This NSF Phase II SBIR campaign will develop a multi-axial filament winding process (3DMF) for robotically positioning biological materials to medical device implants. 3DMF implants will be made more rapidly and economically than existing technologies, with extraordinary biomechanical performance, and, importantly, designed for facile surgical use without additional tooling or fixation for delivery, based on extensive surgeon-guided inputs. Upon commercialization, this technology will significantly reduce the cost of surgical implant augmentation and minimize surgical touch time, surgical complexity, and overall costs while providing a superior healing implant for challenging rotator cuff repairs.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will biomanufacture 3DMF orthobiologic implants using human collagen resin and biopolymer yarns to form physiologically high-strength microfibrous implants that mimic native tissue strength and biology. This research advances knowledge in the field, progressing beyond existing limited additive and fiber-based manufacturing technologies (i.e., electrospinning, weaving, braiding, 3D printing, etc.) to provide features critical for the end-user surgeon. The work?s main objectives include: 1.) To biomanufacture quality-controlled 3DMF implants at the clinical scale; 2.) To optimize 3DMF arthroscopic surgical delivery and human factors, 3.) to determine 3DMF biomechanical performance, and 4.) To determine 3DMF device biocompatibility. Completing this work will progress product development of the 3DMF device with proven manufacturability, yielding implants with the required strength and accessible surgical approach for facile implantation within the existing surgical workflow to drive commercial adoption and reimbursement. This work specifically targets research and development of 3DMF implants for the rotator cuff repair niche with a large market with an unmet need for an accessible, economical, and effective solution.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes enhancing US economic competitiveness, improving the health and welfare of the American public, and developing the US technical workforce. The success of this project will have a direct impact on the manufacturers, integrators, and operators of battery-powered assets. Empowering battery engineering teams with predictive analytics across their product life cycle will be a crucial competitive advantage to accelerating the scale-up of domestic battery technology development and deployment. Bringing better battery technology to market faster and ensuring a long, safe operating life will, in turn, catalyze the transition away from fossil fuels and towards electric vehicles, grid-scale energy storage, and other clean technologies. The social and economic implications include clean energy jobs, improved environmental quality, and ubiquitous low-cost energy. The potential commercial impact of this project will help accelerate the development and deployment of new battery-powered vehicles, energy storage systems, and other assets. It will allow the company to serve the wider battery industry by de-risking operation and extending service life of battery assets, thereby increasing customer revenue and avoiding costly warranty events.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project's goal is to de-risk the deployment, operation, and maintenance of battery energy storage systems. It will combine results from the Phase I with data from partners to forecast system maintenance and inform warranty design, thereby lowering the total cost of ownership and minimizing liability. Access to cell testing, outgoing quality control, and field data will allow for a deep dive across the product life cycle to identify how known degradation mechanisms manifest in the real-world battery data. Physics-informed feature engineering will be used to extend models to incorporate these insights and then implement these models at scale in the cloud. Criteria for success include: 1) correlating real-world operating conditions with known Lithium-ion battery degradation pathways, 2) engineering new features that are correlated with physics- and electrochemical-based insights, 3) accurately estimating remaining useful life to within 5% of total cycle life, and 4) implementing data-driven model in a scalable cloud environment.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a platform technology for creating rapid virus diagnostics that directly recognizes the virus surface protein pattern from a patient sample and generates accurate results within minutes. Current standards for high-fidelity viral pathogen diagnostics require complex instruments, technical expertise to run the instruments, and hours to produce and interpret results. The proposed platform creates a virus-specific biosensor that selectively binds to the target virus and produces visible results without time-consuming pre-processing or expensive instruments. Lower cost tests and faster sample-to-result turnovers could result in more effective control of disease spread.\n\nThis project seeks to develop a highly functional, sensitive, and specific diagnostic for the detection of coronavirus. This technology is based on the company?s Pattern-Recognition Enhanced Sensing and Therapeutics (PEST) concept. The solution is a first-in-class diagnostics that uses algorithmically-designed structural DNA to form a trap that may detect and selectively bind a signature pattern of the pathogen. This recognition and binding may generate visual signals without the need of DNA/RNA preprocessing or amplification associated with the current generation of molecular tests (polymerase chain reactions, PCRs). This project will involve building a preclinical prototype of PEST-enabled lateral flow based COVID-19 rapid diagnostics with a goal of providing results for each sample within 5 minutes. This fast test result will be followed by preclinical validation to determine the test?s specificity, limits of detection, and implement mechanism to improve the assay specificity and to avoid cross-reaction to other virus types.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project will research and validate an internet-of-things (IOT) platform to help commercial fleets transition to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The ZEV transition is the primary solution to the decarbonization of the transportation sector, which is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the US. The project focuses on transit agencies, with the ultimate goal of lowering both operating costs and capital costs of their ZEV fleets. Coupled with the current funding support by federal, state and local governments to transit agencies to purchase ZEVs, this project could accelerate the decarbonization of the US transit fleet. A 50% transition of the US transit fleet to ZEVs will reduce nearly 200 million metric tons of carbom dioxide (CO2) equivalent, providing cleaner air quality and reducing urban noise pollution, particularly in low-income communities that rely more heavily on transit services for their transportation needs. The addressable market of Transportation Management Systems will grow from $8.8 billion in 2020 to $27.48 billion in 2028. Demonstrating success in the transit segment will enable the replication of this approach to other fleet segments like school bus fleets, last-mile and mid-mile delivery fleets, and long-haul trucking fleets.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the design and implementation of an artificial intelligence software platform to automatically learn predictive vehicle models of transit ZEVs and provide recommendation services to transit agencies. The Phase II project has three integrated goals. The first goal is the development of energy prediction algorithms which are scalable and highly accurate. Transit ZEV fleets have stochastic load changes, high sensitivity to operator driving style and high variation of battery size, weight and driving range, even for similar vehicles. These challenges will be addressed by developing automated learning techniques built on algorithms developed in Phase I, which use contextualized data from ZEV stops and trips. The second goal is to validate the prediction accuracy via pilots with ZEV fleets providing scheduled bus services. The final goal is development of real-time, scalable, fleet optimization algorithms which optimize daily assignment and charge management of ZEV fleets. Chance-constrained optimization will be merged with predictive control theory to address scalability and real-time performance of the resulting optimization algorithms. These recommendations will, if successful, demonstrate highly accurate predictions of charge usage, a substantial increase in ZEV fleet utilization, and a reduction of transit ZEV fleet operating costs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create very low power and very high capacity optical interconnects for general computer applications. Computer performance is limited by the speed, power, and latency of connections between chips and memory. The limitations of electrical interconnects are well known, and optical interconnects overcome the limitations and offer 100-1000 times performance improvements. While historically optical interconnects have been hampered by high cost and high power, recent developments show that the promise of optical interconnects can be practically realized. Optical interconnects will dramatically improve overall performance of enterprise and cloud computing services, especially when used in data center computers, while reducing electrical power consumption. This will in turn permit a vast improvement in resource utilization and dramatic reduction in the cost of computation across all segments of society\n\nThe proposed project will develop an optical peripheral component interconnect expreess (PCIe)-compatible transparent bridge for general computer interconnects. PCIe is the most prevalent interconnect used today in computers. The technology developed in this proposal, based on light emitting diode (LED)-based transmitters, multicore optical fibers, and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible photodetectors, seeks to reduce electrical power consumption from ~10 pJ/bit for electrical solutions to ~100-200 fJ/bit. The use of LEDs leverages investments already made for cost and power effective LED lighting and displays. The small size of the LEDs and multicore fibers allows for data densities of >1 Pbps/cm2. Electrical interconnects and other optical interconnect technologies cannot compare with the performance of these LED based optical interconnects. These advantages enable physical disaggregation of the compute, storage, and memory functions, improving system performance and resource utilization. This Phase II effort is focused on the development of a PCIe-compliant transparent bridge for applications in chip to chip and chip to memory interconnects.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop and commercialize a new technology for accurate, portable, and inexpensive measurement of multiple blood clotting parameters. Common tests are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions like atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. These conditions affect millions of patients in the US alone and represent $2 B of spending annually. However, many current solutions cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system or sample, causing clinically significant problems for end-users and raising the cost and inconvenience of performing these tests routinely. The technology in this project will enable various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable system. This will potentially lead to cheaper and more convenient blood coagulation testing for medical professionals and improve medical outcomes by bringing accurate and multiple tests to a single portable devices.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a point of care (POC) direct, mechanical test in a meter and single-use disposable card format, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods that underpin blood clotting tests in the clinical laboratory. As a mechanical measurement, the card will measure physical properties of a clotting whole blood sample and account for confounding factors, such as hematocrit. Specifically, the objective of the project will be to develop a POC, hand-held, battery-operated system that can enable the generation of a viscoelastic curve and associated thromboelastography parameters in less than 10 minutes, a significant improvement over current bulky and labor-intensive solutions with turnaround times of up to 30 minutes or more. Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time. This project will demonstrate the implementation of a blood coagulation test in a portable POC system.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its strong potential to disrupt the small wind market, which to date has lagged behind solar counterparts. Through dual installation with solar on commercial buildings, the proposed roof-edge wind turbines will be able to deliver enhanced energy capture systems to buildings, with a shorter payback period, thus improving cost-efficiency and power potential, and attracting a broader body of adopters. By improving product offerings in the renewable energy sector, this technology has the potential to promote sustainable infrastructure, reducing reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a roof-edge wind capture technology with commercial viability. The proposed distributed wind technology reduces costs by harnessing elevated wind speeds at the roof edge, optimizing powertrain architecture, and mitigating soft costs through sale to solar installers, who have already achieved significant market penetration yet would benefit from a diversified portfolio. The project aims to: 1) Prove the feasibility of integrating a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine into the system 2) Design for additional stakeholders, with respect to aesthetics, structural integration, ease of installation, and code compliance, while maintaining cost targets needed for scaleup 3) Design and test full powertrain architecture using components intended for commercial scaleup and 4) Build and test the full turbine for reliability and certification testing. These efforts will inform critical needs to address prior to large-scale commercial rollout, providing a strong foundation for translation as a reliable and cost-efficient distributed wind solution.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of an analysis method and software package to identify human disease subtypes using omics data. This technology will enable the ability to provide personalized treatment for patients, and more successful and cost-effective clinical trials, bring drugs to market more rapidly. The goal is identification of disease subtypes and patient subgroups, a prerequisite to the ability to distinguish between patients who are in danger and need the most aggressive treatments, and those who are less suited to treatment because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently, 70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more than $1 trillion per year. This may be avoided by refining trial inclusion criteria and administering the drug only to the patients most likely to respond. The technology is designed to identify patient subgroups most likely to respond or not respond to a given treatment. This technology also may reduce the cost of prophylactic clinical trials by reducing the number of subjects and/or duration necessary to achieve sufficient power. The technology will significantly reduce drug development costs while simultaneously improving patient care by selecting the correct treatment for each patient.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a novel analysis method and software package that is able to identify subtypes of disease based on the integration of multiple types of omics data. Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients (respondents vs. non-respondents) and/or subtypes of disease (aggressive vs. non-aggressive). The current unmet challenge is to discover the molecular subtypes of disease and subgroups of patients. Attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success (very few gene expression tests are FDA-approved to date). The technology proposed here may be used to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple types of high-throughput data. In addition, the Phase I results obtained on real patient data demonstrated that the technology is able to distinguish between more and less aggressive types of cancer based on their molecular profiles alone. This Phase II project proposes to extend this technology to integrate genomic and clinical data.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project is to create a pathway to success in STEM for all students, including those who are blind or have low vision (BLV), with a truly usable and effective description system for STEM diagrams. The lack of accessible accommodations creates roadblocks for BLV students in STEM education, leading many students to give up, even though they have equal potential as the general population for academic success. All web-based, non-decorative diagrams are required to include alternative (alt) text descriptions for use with screen readers. Current methods for making STEM visualizations accessible through alt text are not scalable or amenable for use with dynamic digital media. Visualizing STEM concepts through a linear string of text can be difficult for BLV students, because of the high cognitive load. Integrating an interactive method for querying specific information provides screen reader users a more personalized learning experience. This interactive system can be used by all students to make sense of STEM concepts, creating a use case where all users benefit from the inclusion of alt text. Commercialization will be from integration into existing learning platforms to meet accessibility requirements required of federally funded educational institutions.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will create an expandable system for generating detailed and standardized descriptions of STEM diagrams in interactive media. The goal is to provide real-time alt text generation for screen reader users (SRUs) and to create an inclusive and accessible communication method for all students in STEM courses. The alt text description engine provides a method for integrating visual information from STEM diagrams with large language models and the algorithms of current artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. The AI-driven learning assistant from this project guides SRUs in understanding complex alt text descriptions in a manner that best matches their skillsets and prior knowledge. The AI learning assistant also provides personalized contextual learning support for all users. The technical objectives include 1) Expanding the architecture to scale the alt text generation engine to other STEM subjects and readily integrate with AI platforms, 2) Implementing accessibility features to the suite of learning interactives, and 3) Developing a database of learning activities aligned to learning objectives. Usability studies with SRUs and instructors will guide iterative product development. Research studies in classrooms will demonstrate the promise of outcomes to enhance commercial success for the suite of accessible learning interactives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable energy efficient smart internet of things (IoT) devices capable of running a neural network locally. The proposed energy-efficient neural network accelerator solution uses circuit architecture that allows for chips with a small area, a key enabler for cost-effective adoption and inclusion in space-constrained systems such as mobile devices. The solution is energy-efficient compared to the existing digital logic-based accelerator solutions, which will enable edge implementation for systems with power constraints. The manufacturing process is fully scalable in advanced standard logic processes at almost all manufacturing foundries, thus allowing for widespread adoption of the architecture. The outcome of this project will be an energy-efficient system on a chip (SoC) solution that offers artificial intelligence integration in smart IoT devices without cloud access, while enabling security and privacy enhancements.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop an energy efficient analog circuit topology and variation tolerable system solution. To enable analog compute-in-memory architecture based neural network accelerator solution in an advanced semiconductor process technology, significant design challenges need to be solved with reduced supply voltage and noise margin. Along with the newly proposed area efficient and performance efficient analog compute-in-memory architecture solution, the logic compatible non-volatile neural network accelerator intellectual property core will be designed, fabricated, and validated in the advanced process technology through the project. Once verified successfully from the fabricated silicon in this project, the proposed neural network IP will be ready to be integrated as a key building block of future artificial intelligence systems on a chip and enable energy-efficient smart edge IoT devices.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will advance a novel system for sensing, predicting, and addressing plant stress, offering affordable guidance for permanent and specialty crop farmers. This guidance will simultaneously reduce irrigation water and agricultural chemical applications, while also increasing crop yields and farmer profits. The project will develop easy-to-use equipment and software that delivers guidance compatible with installed irrigation systems and processes. The addressable market for this technology is $3 B in the United States and $30 B internationally. The system's ability to reduce the use of irrigation water and chemicals has a profound societal benefit. The system will conserve scarce fresh water resources, allowing for population growth and an increase in irrigated land. The system will reduce water pollution from agricultural activities, addressing a $210 B annual problem in the United States; furthermore, it will improve agricultural yields, ensuring adequate food for growing populations, with reduced use of pesticides and fungicides.\n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate a software and distributed hardware system for measuring and predicting yield-reducing plant abiotic and biotic stressors, and delivering intervention guidance to farmers to mitigate these stressors. In order to predict plant stresses at a localized level, many data feeds must be fused and analyzed to create a synthetic sensor estimating plant water stress, predicting microclimatic conditions, and performing localized plant disease and pest modeling. The project will advance the fields of ultra-low power sensor arrays, wide-area networking, machine learning, and human interface design for big data interpretation.\n\nThis project will expand a test system by adding microclimate and disease and pest model prediction algorithms for precision temporal and location-targeted interventions of irrigation, fertilizer, fungicide, pesticide, and biostimulant applications to mitigate plant stress.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the efficiency and performance of electronic devices. Modern devices, including cell phones, laptops, and electric vehicles contain high-powered semiconductor components which generate unwanted heat that, in turn, reduces their efficiency. If left unchecked, this heat may destroy the devices and even injure users or cause damage to the environment. This project addresses excessing heating in electronic devices by introducing new high-performance thermal interface materials based upon embedding liquid metal droplets inside of stretchable polymers. These so-called liquid metal embedded elastomer (LMEE) materials can be applied to computer processors, graphics cards, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and even power modules in electric vehicles, to help keep electronic devices operating at peak performance at all times. The growing prevalence of the Internet of Things, 5G network infrastructure, and electric cars all necessitate better thermal solutions so that devices can function properly. This project could contribute to the semiconductor, automotive, and healthcare industries.\n\nThis project?s goal is to develop and commercialize a thermal interface material (TIM) for packaged microelectronics, building upon the LMEE composite architecture. The technology will outperform existing TTIMs by combining the superior thermal resistance of metal-based solid TIMs (S-TIMs) with the mechanical reliability of polymer-based TIMs and the high-volume manufacturing compatibility of thermal greases. Specifically, LMEEs possess a unique combination of metal-like thermal resistance, rubber-like elasticity, and liquid emulsion-like rheology prior to curing, thereby solving two main challenges present with existing S-TIMs: (i) poor mechanical reliability over long durations and (ii) incompatibility with syringe-based dispensing for high volume manufacturing. The strategy proposed in this project is to synthesize an LMEE-based TIM that forms a robust bond between the surfaces of the semiconductor chip and surrounding enclosure, maintains a controlled thickness between the chip and enclosure, and ensures the necessary rheology for syringe-based dispensing. Specific project tasks build around a comprehensive technical plan that includes materials synthesis, performance characterization, and in-package evaluation. In parallel, the project will examine methods for storage, shipment, and dispensing to ensure a product that is ready for integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor assembly and testing industry by the end of this project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is demonstrate new lasers for advanced communication and sensing applications. The proposed work includes the design, simulation, and testing of new lasers to meet rapidly-growing high-speed data center optical communication and emerging automotive laser range-finding requirements.\n\nThe proposed project activities will include the design, simulation, and experimental verification of hybrid, external-cavity silicon-based optical sources to meet rapidly-growing high-speed datacenter optical communication and emerging automotive laser range-finding requirements. The project will demonstrate that a flexible electronic-photonic integration process can be created to enable dense integration of silicon-photonic and silicon-electronic circuits, independent of specific foundry or fabrication production limitations. This process can be used to develop arrays of high-performance, low-noise, and widely-tunable lasers for advanced optical communication and sensing applications. The proposed project will address existing laser mode-control issues and reduce back-reflection issues. The result will be silicon-photonic lasers suitable for commercial production that will demonstrate industry-leading semiconductor laser capabilities including low-noise, narrow-linewidth, and wide tunability in single and multi-laser chipsets.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a new cancer treatment liquid biopsy product using Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can detect and classify cancer derived rare cell (CRC) from a blood draw. There are over 100 different types of cancers and over 1.9 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in the US in 2022 resulting in over 600,000 deaths (1,670 deaths per day). Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. New treatment therapies are being developed for a substantial proportion of cancers with many clinical trials for new therapies on-going world-wide. The minimally invasive, high sensitivity blood test will monitor therapeutic response and progression at low-cost, supporting development of these new cancer treatments. Specifically, with a less invasive and more comprehensive diagnostic tool, the test results will give clinical researchers real-time insights into cancer tumor biology, providing better understanding of cancer heterogeneity.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project combines Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning neural networks used for computer vision, with CRC immunofluorescent reagents integrated into an immunofluorescent microscope. The main objective of this effort is to identify and classify CRCs with high accuracy. There is increasing evidence that CRCs are correlated with cancer type, staging, treatment response, minimal residual disease, and overall disease progression. However, in a typical blood sample, there are over 7 million blood artifacts with very few CRCs present. Current techniques to analyze CRCs are expensive, lengthy, and are limited in automation. To meet project sensitivity, specificity, and runtime requirements, the AI image analysis will be further optimized to: 1) find CRCs, 2) discriminate against false positives, and 3) classify CRCs into clinically relevant types. The developed AI architectures will be selected through extensive training using thousands of clinical samples compared to expertly characterized cancer blood pathology images. After high sensitivity and specificity are demonstrated, development work will continue to mature the AI-revolutionized CRC liquid biopsy test to meet clinical research use only (RUO) requirements. For the cancer research community, the product offering will be used in the conduct of non-clinical laboratory research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve vertical farms. The global threat to food security and the need to deal with unpredictable climate conditions have opened the doors to advanced precision agriculture and vertical urban farming. Rapidly growing global populations, demand for higher agricultural yields with limited arable farmland drive demand for vertical farming and new technologies to expand access to this method of sustainable crop cultivation. The proposed system will reduce the burden on the environment by decreasing water, fertilizers and pesticides required to grow crops. These micro-farms will boost agricultural profitability by providing a reliable, sustainable food system with fresh, healthy, and eco-friendly produce. This reduces food waste and the environmental impact of the food supply chain while improving yields and nutritional density.\n\nThis SBIR Phase II project advances a system with integrated environmental control, consumables management, alerting, and scheduling. Furthermore, the automated controls are continuously improved by using camera vision to estimate yield and machine learning to forecast yield and optimize the environmental variables. To make the system cost-effective, a novel multispectral camera will be developed to collect agricultural data. Using machine learning, the images collected will be correlated to the environmental variables, such as pH and nutrient concentration, so that those variables can be optimized to increase yields. In order to improve scheduling and logistics, the platform will track inputs such as seeds, nutrients, and pH solution, using sensors and QR codes to automate consumable replacement. Sensors and software checks will determine when component or human failure have occurred, before they lead to crop failure, leading to just-in-time component replacement and maintenance.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project reduces the cost and complexity of building modern cellular networks. In grave emergencies such as natural or manmade disasters, and in rural areas where infrastructure for Internet access is limited, one of the largest barriers to digital access is the cost and complexity of building cellular networks. Cellular networks are relied upon everyday by millions of Americans to communicate with others, conduct business, work together, access healthcare and information resources, and power the economy through Point of Sale (PoS) devices, utility meters and transportation infrastructure. Loss of these cellular networks constitutes a major disruption in life, an example being Hurricane Maria that struck Puerto Rico in 2017 and created a massive island-wide communications blackout that lasted several weeks. Even in normal times, the lack of high-speed Internet sets communities back. According to the U.S. Census in 2020, more than 12% of households across the nation's 50 states do not have internet access. As digital infrastructure is upgraded to 5G and even 6G, cellular base station technology is more expensive, requires expertise to configure, and widening the digital divide. This project will combat these problems.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create new cellular base station technology (the equipment that provides cellular signals) to decentralize cellular networks and make them easier to establish. Compared to current solutions, this project will reduce the cost to set up new cellular networks, by at least an order of magnitude compared to existing networks. The technology will reduce the deployment time and enable individuals with no training to easily set up a large network, even if no infrastructure exists. The cellular infrastructure increases the reliability resulting from the use of a mesh network to communicate and transfer data between base stations. The research objectives of this project are to develop integrated digital and radiofrequency (RF) circuitry and the enclosure for a production-ready base station device reducing the cost by 2.5x and the weight by 2x. In addition, the objectives are to develop a high-performance amplifier to allow the base station to operate on any band at higher power up to 1 W peak output, implement telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) communication ability for the radio and amplifier, implement a spectrum access system, and design a phased array antenna to increase the link budget by up to 18 dBi for the mesh network.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is advancement in the development of an effective wound closure product for internal gastrointestinal (GI) surgical applications. Anastomotic leaks resulting from ineffective GI surgical wound closures are associated with significant healthcare and economic costs. Effective closure of wounds decreases the likelihood of complications that significantly impact patient outcomes and increases the cost of care. Development of an enhanced tissue adhesive to address the limitations of current products has the potential to offer a reliable wound closure product to support improved patient outcomes. Successful development and commercialization of the enhanced GI wound closure product will provide surgeons with an effective tissue adhesive that is easy to use and can be safe for the closure of internal GI wounds, thus ensuring safe and reliable closure, decreasing anastomotic leaks, and allowing for enhanced patient outcomes. Additionally, this project has the potential to support additional product development to generate improved tissue adhesives/sealants for a wide range of surgical applications that will have the potential to decrease surgical complications related to ineffective wound closure.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of an enhanced tissue adhesive to improve surgical wound care specific to gastrointestinal (GI) tract surgeries. Gastrointestinal tract surgical wounds have a high rate of anastomotic leaks resulting from incomplete and sub-optimal surgical closures. These leaks put the patients at an increased risk of infection and creates an estimated $28.6 million in hospitalization and readmission costs per 1000 patients. Current tissue adhesives for GI applications are biologically derived, which are amenable for internal use but pose a risk of infection. The technology being developed is a polyurethane-based adhesive that is biodegradable, easy to use, and biocompatible. The overall goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to demonstrate in vivo efficacy for the use of the surgical adhesive in GI surgical wound care. To meet this goal, the surgical adhesive formulation developed from Phase I will be refined to identify the ideal formulation for GI use and a lead formulation will be assessed for in vivo performance. The results from this project have the potential to identify a safe, easy-to-use, and effective lead tissue adhesive for implementation in GI surgical applications to prevent anastomotic leaks and improve GI surgical wound closures.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to address the unmet need in the companion diagnostic guided therapy market for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). SCD is a lifelong disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Emerging therapies are estimated to be $150k-$200k per patient each year. A companion diagnostic cost in SCD anti-adhesive therapies is estimated at least $3,000 per patient. With improved accessibility to patients living in low- and middle-income countries and scalable curative therapies, the global SCD treatment market size is projected to increase to $8.75B by 2029. Additionally, companion diagnostic-guided drugs have an increased regulatory approval probability of 50% in Phase III clinical trials. The proprietary Endothelium-on-a-chip platform with human donor cells provides a physiologically relevant means to study blood-endothelium interaction. This platform can be integrated into preclinical studies to screen the effect of novel drug candidates as well as for assessment of drug toxicity. In Phase I of the STTR project, standards and quality control criteria for experimental conditions on the Endothelium-on-a-chip were established. The continuing projects with pharmaceutical companies have highlighted the need to scale the manufacturing process.\n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will focus on optimizing the manufacturing process to enable the scale-up of the assay and develop the machine learning system for automated data analysis. Currently, this assay involves in-house fabrication and is limited to the central laboratory at the company?s location. Manufacturing will be optimized with proper selection of material, fabrication methods, scalable techniques, and systematic integration of different elements of the assay. This will potentially enable the commercialization and implementation of the technology at a larger scale. Current methods of analysis include counting adhesion events manually. This method will be replaced by a machine learning-based system to identify and classify adhesion events and separate those from the endothelial cells in the background. Automated data analysis will enable faster outcomes and remove user bias. Since this approach relies on enhancing the capabilities of the existing platform for scale-up and streamlined analysis, it is anticipated that it will improve its accessibility to the broader research community.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project would be a significant increase the commercial, scientific, and human health potential of the microbiome field by enabling large-scale, dense longitudinal measurement and analysis of microbial RNA. This could enable: (1) a significant reduction in false discoveries caused by a lack of reproducible data; (2) a major cost reduction ? ensuring these advancements are accessible to the entire industry; (3) high-frequency sampling, making time-series explorations routine; and (4) the creation of a large-scale database that contains both DNA and RNA data, which could lead to unprecedented discovery and validation of precision medicine biomarkers. Successful completion of this project could have a high likelihood of advancing the health and welfare of the American public, increasing the economic competitiveness of the United States healthcare and life sciences sector, and enhancing partnerships between academia and industry.\n\nThe proposed project describes the development of an RNA feature to an existing microbiome measurement and analysis platform that consists of an automated sample collection system and an analytics engine for sequence data. Currently, the question of which genes are being expressed by gut microbes (which can be studied using RNA transcripts) is an extraordinarily promising research field for advancing the understanding of host-microbial interactions. This is because bacteria that make up a small amount of the gut microbiome can still influence the community dramatically through their gene expression. This can be overlooked by DNA sequence data, which only measures bacterial abundance. Despite this, RNA remains under-utilized, as RNA quickly degrades outside of the cell, and most laboratories lack the capability to measure RNA at any significant scale reliably. The main activities of this project will be (1) refining a process for RNA capture and storage, (2) integrating these into the automated hardware system, and (3) developing the methods and infrastructure for analysis of the resulting RNA datasets. This project will allow studies of gene expression in the gut microbiome to become commonplace, allowing researchers to discover more powerful clinically relevant biomarkers for precision medicine applications.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides more 7.7 million women in the U.S. struggling with infertility a quantitative and affordable way to assess their ovulatory health. This progesterone biosensor is the first outcome of a platform technology built to improve at-home blood diagnostics and telehealth implementation. This project will produce a novel class of inexpensive, real-time, and point-of-care biosensors. The commercialization of this product may also increase public engagement and comfort with biosensors and at-home diagnostics. In concert with informational videos, website pages, and workshops the commercialization of this product will improve scientific literacy. Finally, the affordability of this product may help narrow the disparity of access to fertility technology allowing for more socioeconomically disadvantaged and underserved populations equal opportunity to assess their fertility.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a novel class of biosensors for progesterone. The technical hurdles to be addressed are to first translate optical transduction technology onto low-cost paper strips, then to determine the efficacy of the biosensors as paper test strips. The team will then develop a low-cost and portable measurement device which reads the paper lateral flow strips. The anticipated technical results are a lateral-flow strip device which can measure progesterone from clinical blood samples of women who have never been pregnant, women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), pre-menopausal women, and post-menopausal women down to levels which indicate successful ovulation.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients suffering from complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). Today, cUTIs account for 400,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Unfortunately, multidrug resistant pathogens are a common cause of cUTI. Many are resistant to the first-line antibiotic (Ceftriaxone), which is used as the empiric treatment of this condition. However, the high incidence of multidrug resistant pathogens causing cUTI delays the time until patients receive more appropriate treatment. Delayed time to appropriate therapy in cUTI has been attributed to extended hospital stays and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The current standard test for diagnosing a drug-resistant cUTI takes 2-3 days from obtaining a patient sample. Therefore, diagnostic tests that can rapidly inform the initial treatment of UTIs are urgently needed to improve patient care.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a rapid urinary diagnostic test that will enable the detection of ceftriaxone-resistant uropathogens. Early detection of resistance to first-line therapies would enable antibiotic prescribing to be informed, reducing the risk of disease progression in patients. In the case of UTIs, disease progression can lead to severely invasive infections, predominately sepsis. Therefore, diagnostics that can detect resistance to first-line antibiotics enable early treatment interventions, reducing the time to appropriate treatment and reducing the risk of disease progression. Decreased treatment time also lowers the healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant cUTI, as disease progression is associated with increased lengths of hospital stays compared to susceptible infections. The completion of the Phase II project will yield the development of a prototype test that can provide actionable information regarding ceftriaxone susceptibility in less than 5 minutes. This project?s success will provide clinicians with a diagnostic solution for cUTIs that can be acted on immediately to improve patient outcomes and aid antibiotic stewardship by preventing the unnecessary use of inappropriate antibiotics.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project promotes small and mid-sized farming in the United States through environmentally friendly means. Through cost-effective labor automation, a fully automated, turn-key greenhouse production system can be made more accessible. This project will provide farmers with a tool that can guarantee a baseline annual production of leafy greens and herbs, independent of weather variables and labor accessibility. By removing weather limitations and labor requirements, small and mid-sized farms can be made more profitable and scalable. This project will have a positive impact on the advancement of local and regional food systems. By advancing a market that has been historically ignored from a technological standpoint, an attractive alternative to large-scale industrial agriculture and foreign fresh food imports will be created. Making small and mid-sized farms more economically viable will create a more robust and sustainable food system.\n\nThis SBIR Phase II effort will design, build, and demonstrate a full-scale, automated greenhouse farm prototype. This prototype will remain completely autonomous for weeks at a time requiring no humans to enter the farm while all processes from seed to storage of harvested crops are performed robotically. No greenhouse technology, at any price point, has been able to demonstrate an ability to achieve this degree of automation. This technology will advance the implementation of robotics in food production by addressing the capital costs, labor, and energy barriers that controlled environment agriculture systems currently face. Key challenges include the production of approximately 340 plants per day without any human intervention, a low-cost design for setup and ongoing operations, and the ability to adjust product outputs in real-time to meet market demands. Human interaction with the growing process will be limited through a high degree of system automation, including computer vision for plant inspections and self-cleaning processes. Novel plant growth and handling processes will allow for virtually any type of leafy green or herb to be grown. A variety of sensors will be used to monitor conditions and adjust the system, allowing fresh produce in areas without suitable agricultural opportunities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide an ecofriendly, efficient, and cost affordable adjuvant product to solve the pressing problem of herbicide drift. For years, farmers growing organic, non-genetically modified (non-GM) and specialty crops have incurred financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars due to drift of volatile herbicides such as dicamba, a highly volatile and efficient herbicide that is used to get rid of weeds. The devastation of dicamba on non-GM crops and the natural landscape has been a widespread issue. In 2021, about 4,000 dicamba-related herbicide misuse complaints were reported across 27 states. If successfully commercialized, the new adjuvant will help all key stakeholders, including farmers who grow GM crops and use dicamba, and those who grow non-GM crops and do not want drift of dicamba. The award reflects NSF?s statutory mission of promoting and improving national economy and health, as well as protecting the environment for the well-being of U.S. citizens.\n\nThe innovation proposed in this SBIR Phase II project is a bio-based emulsion adjuvant, derived from renewable resources, with the combined functionality of a volatility and drift reducing agent and surfactant that will be used to reduce the volatility and off-target movement of herbicides and improve their spreading. The adjuvant has environmental and financial benefits that give it a competitive edge over commercially available but less efficient petroleum-based and synthetic adjuvants on the market. The patent-pending technology is a platform technology that can be applied to other industries from paints and coatings to pharmaceuticals. The project sets the following technical objectives to evaluate and demonstrate the commercial feasibility of the innovation: 1) assess droplet dynamics of several drift-prone herbicides when used in conjunction with the adjuvant at different use rates, 2) complete the registration of the adjuvant, 3) conduct field trials to evaluate particle drift of dicamba and dicamba-glyphosate tank mixes when used in conjunction with the adjuvant, 4) low tunnel field test to assess volatility of tank mixes on different surfaces, 5) evaluate the effects of the adjuvant on dicamba efficacy that are common in the South and Mid-West, and 6) scale up the production of the minimally viable product.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to bring new and more diverse audiences to circuit design and digital fabrication through an integrated STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) approach. Research shows that the STEAM approach is especially successful for reaching underrepresented minorities, girls, and women. This project continues the development of the Phase I circuit design software and accompanying physical toolkit for do-it-yourself (DIY) digital fabrication of circuits on paper. Through the design, development, and evaluation of this toolkit, the team will contribute to the scientific understanding of human computer interaction design for STEAM learning, accessibility, and equity. By introducing the novel category of technology-integrated crafts to mainstream education and craft markets, open market opportunities create a new ecosystem of products and accessories, customers, and inventors. This innovation brings the digital manufacturing of electronics out of traditional technical environments and into entirely new, more mainstream, and more diverse audiences.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development of the Phase I activities towards commercial deployment. The team is developing a novel electronics design software that greatly reduces the complexity of existing computer-aided design tools and prepares a custom toolkit optimized for the do-it-yourself digital fabrication of circuits. The research objective is to blend engineering activities with arts and crafts in innovative ways to radically reduce the barriers to entry for learning, designing, and producing electronic circuits. The team will develop a production version of their software that includes advanced simulation and design features, as well as a library of projects and resources to scaffold the circuit learning and design process. The team will also refine and manufacture the toolkit for user testing and deployment at scale. In close partnership with K-12 educators and hobby crafters, the technology will be developed to meet the needs of target users.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to advance clinical methods that address the extensive physiological variation that is age- and race-dependent. Well-publicized over the last few decades is the lack of healthcare solutions for diseases in preemie babies, who are born to mothers with significant socioeconomic inequalities. Case in point, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a common and often fatal gastrointestinal, or gut, emergency in premature infants that disproportionately affects African American babies. The disease has not only confounded doctors and nurses for 200 years, but also these neonatal emergencies are also frightening to almost all preemie care providers due to its high mortality rate. Its healthcare in the US requires $3 billion annually due to repeated x-ray testing, surgery, longer hospital stays, and long-term complications of its survivors. An early and accurate diagnostic test for NEC would be a disruptive paradigm shift in preemie intensive care: it would enable medical intervention to be more effective, reduce risk of disease progression, decrease medical care expenses by hundreds of millions annually, and lower mortality.\n\nThe proposed project will develop requisite reagents for a diagnostic test that will enable detection of infant proteins that play a role in gut health. Absolute quantitation is a prerequisite for data interpretation and validation between experiments, laboratories, and testing platforms. Research objectives are directed toward critical technical hurdles: (1) determination of optimal reference standard to quantitate host biomolecules in clinical settings and (2) understanding the usage limitations of these reference standards in the background of high variation in the human population. Native and recombinant candidates will be compared and analyzed with various methods. Anticipated results are reference standards that are age-specific for diagnostic use in the most fragile and smallest patients and that are acceptable to regulatory stakeholders.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to advance dynamic chemical reactor systems that repurposes waste gases (primarily carbon dioxide (CO2)) for use as fuels and as chemicals. This effort can have substantial commercial and market impacts as its output is compatible with existing infrastructure. This project leverages significant recent investments into carbon capture, renewable energy generation, and green hydrogen. A particularly interesting application of this technology is the production of chemical feedstocks that are used to make plastics and other commodity chemicals from living organisms. This is inherently a step towards carbon negative manufacturing.\n\nThe proposed project aims to re-purpose pollutants to a feedstock for fuels and chemicals. Although renewable energy sources are increasing and becoming cheaper, these technologies are not ready for heavy-duty transportation and chemical sectors. No commercial scale operation is in existence in which CO2 is captured from the air or flue ga"
