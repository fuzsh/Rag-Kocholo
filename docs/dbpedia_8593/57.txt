The Premier League has charged the world’s richest soccer team with breaking financial rules.

Manchester City, which retained its position as the highest revenue-generating soccer team at $794 million for the 2021-22 season, has been referred to an independent commission by the top-flight English league over alleged breaches of its financial rules each season from 2009-10 to 2017-18.

The Premier League alleges the club failed to provide accurate information representing a “true and fair view of the club’s financial position.”

Man City also allegedly didn’t provide full details of player remuneration from the 2010-11 to 2015-16 seasons and manager remuneration from the 2009-10 to 2011-12 seasons.

It also allegedly breached Union of European Football Associations Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations between 2013 and 2018.

Since the club was purchased in 2008 by a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, it has spent more than roughly $2.25 billion on buying players, according to Transfermarkt.

The Premier League also claims the club — which Forbes last valued at $4.25 billion — didn’t cooperate or assist with investigations over the last four years.

A commission will be held in private, and the team could face fines, point deductions, or relegation from the league.
