        "text": "England’s Manchester City is the oldest football club in 2015’s edition of the UEFA’s Champions League, kicking it for 136 seasons. City is closely followed by the London-based Arsenal Gunners, at 130 years. And another English team, Liverpool, wraps up the top three.\n\nOut of the 32 clubs representing 18 countries at Europe’s top combined level, 22 have been around for over a century.\n\nThe kids on the block? France’s Paris Saint-Germain (46), Belarus’ BATE Borisov (20) and Bulgaria’s Ludogorets Razgrad (15) – the only clubs 50 years young, or younger.\n\nFollow @VinGetz\n\nUEFA FOOTBALL CLUB COUNTRY YEARS ESTABLISHED 1.

The City has the hot foot of recent, for sure.\n\nBut the Red Devils still own Manchester and the League, itself. United has netted 13 EPL championships, by far the most.\n\nThe Arsenal Gunners and Chelsea Blues, both out of London, are next, tied with three apiece.\n\nThis is all only a small part of the whole story, though. The Premier League’s inaugural season was 1992-93, but it has been around in a few different forms since 1888: English Football League (1888-89 through 1891-92), English Football League First Division (1892-93 through 1991-92) and the Premier League.\n\nFor a club tally of all the championships since the very beginnings, straight through the Premier League to today, check out a previous Sports List of the Day post…Clubs with the Most English Football League Championships. Manchester United leads that one, too, but the race is much tighter. Liverpool‘s just two behind.\n\nFollow @VinGetz\n\nFOOTBALL CLUB NUMBER OF PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIPS SEASON RUNNERS-UP 1.
