        "text": "The wait for the outcome of the charges levelled at Manchester City in February of 2023 goes on over 115 alleged breaches of FFP regulations over nine years from the 2009/10 season through to 2017/18. Reports suggest that an independent panel will settle the matter later this year with an outcome heard in 2025.\n\nAll the talk has surrounded the potential sanctions that the club could face if found guilty. Suggestions have ranged from points deductions and fines to even expulsion from the league, with some wondering whether Man City could be stripped of their titles.\n\nSky Sports were told by financial expert Kieran Maguire that this latter outcome would be unlikely. He said, \"It will be difficult for another club to say that they lost a title or lost probably more in access to the Champions League.\"\n\nWith their win at Manchester United, Arsenal guaranteed that the campaign will indeed be decided on the final day as they host Everton and City face West Ham. While unlikely, it means that were Pep Guardiola's side to be stripped of their titles then the awarding of the 2022/23 and 2023/24 seasons would be the Gunners' 14th and 15th league titles.\n\nIt would be something akin to the 2006 awarding of the Serie A title to Inter Milan following the revoking of Juventus' league victory who finished 15 points above the Nerrazzurri. That said, few fans recognise it as much of a title for Inter.\n\nHence why were Arsenal to be retrospectively awarded a couple of titles, I'd barely bat an eye-lid. It would be a hollow result because whilst the accolades are nice there would always be a feeling of an asterisk next to these.\n\nRival fans often goad Liverpool supporters for their title victory in 2020 which was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. While the situations aren't quite the same, there is little hope that were Arsenal theoretically awarded the titles from the past two seasons it would simply be accepted as if they'd finished in the top spot.\n\nREAD MORE: Man City 115 charges and points deduction reality as Arsenal Premier League title hope explained\n\nREAD MORE: Man City PSR latest, Hato links, Lokonga, Smith Rowe and 10 players who could leave Arsenal\n\nIf unlikely retrospective sporting action was taken against Manchester City's titles, I'd want them to be made void. A title won is more than just the trophy: it's the season itself, the games which won it or lost it for your side.\n\nA title is the culmination of years of work to finish about the other 19 sides, which - regardless of the context - Arsenal did not achieve. Nor did Liverpool or Manchester United in their respective years as runners-up.\n\nArsenal remain on a journey toward the goal of winning the league by finishing in the top spot in the table, not through any retrospective action. They can still do it this season despite the odds being stacked against them but all the evidence points toward big things in the near future."
