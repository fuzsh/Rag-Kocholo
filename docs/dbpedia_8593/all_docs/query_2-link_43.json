        "text": "The Premier League on Monday charged its reigning champion, Manchester City, with engaging in years of financial rules violations in its pursuit of trophies, accusations that could result in the most severe punishments in league history — including the prospect that City, one of the most dominant soccer teams in Europe over the past decade, could be ejected from England’s top division.\n\nThe Premier League’s list of charges, outlined in a news release dotted with legalese and dry references to specific rules and bylaws, was remarkable in its scale. Manchester City is accused of more than 100 violations, including failing to provide accurate financial information “that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position”; not disclosing contractual payments to managers and players; and failing, as required, to cooperate with Premier League investigators.\n\nThe charges have been referred to an independent commission and will be heard in a confidential hearing, the Premier League said. League officials declined to comment further on the statement or on the case against City. The team currently sits second in the league table. No date has been set for the hearing.\n\nManchester City responded to the charges with a statement whose language was at odds with the league’s claim that City had failed to cooperate in the investigation, which is now in its fifth year. The club declared itself “surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches” and said that it had turned over a “vast amount of detailed materials.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
