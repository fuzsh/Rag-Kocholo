        "text": "Manchester City made it a hat-trick of Premier League (PL) titles after Arsenal couldn’t make it back on top of the table. The team won its seventh PL crown and is now two trophies down with two more to go, in its pursuit of winning the rare continental ‘treble’.\n\nThe concept of winning a treble is a rare phenomenon with only a handful of teams succeeding.\n\nWhat is a treble?\n\nTreble means three. A treble-winning campaign in football refers to when a team manages to grab three crucial trophies in a single season. These can come either through winning domestic tournaments or continental tournaments or both.\n\nHow many types of treble are there?\n\nThere are two types of treble – domestic and continental.\n\nWhat is a domestic treble?\n\nA domestic treble is what the team earns by winning national competitions.\n\nIt is possible to win a domestic ‘treble’ in only some countries, notably England, Scotland, Portugal and France.\n\nOther countries can win only two national titles as they lack an additional local tournament. Hence, the privilege of being a domestic treble holder is open to only select countries.\n\nWhat are the competitions for a domestic treble?\n\nThe competitions for domestic trebles for England, Scotland, Portugal and France are:\n\nEngland: Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup (Carabao Cup)\n\nScotland: Scottish League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup\n\nPortugal: Primeira Liga, Taca de Portugal, Taca da Liga\n\nFrance: Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Coupe de la Lique\n\nHow many teams have won the domestic treble?\n\nSixteen teams have won the domestic treble so far, with the last treble coming from Manchester City in 2018-19.\n\nWhich European teams have won the domestic treble?\n\nThe following teams have won the domestic treble:\n\nRangers- 7 (1948–49, 1963–64, 1975–76, 1977–78, 1992–93, 1998–99, 2002–03)\n\nCeltic- 7 (1966–67, 1968–69, 2000–01, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20)\n\nLinfield- 5 (1921–22, 1961–62, 1993–94, 2005–06, 2007–08)\n\nParis Saint-Germain- 4 (2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2019–20)\n\nShamrock Rovers- 3 (1924–25, 1931–32, 1963–64)\n\nValetta- 2 (1996–97, 2000–01)\n\nThe New Saints- 2 (2014–15, 2015–16)\n\nAthletic Club- 1 (1930-31)\n\nBayern Munich-1 (1999-2000)\n\nBenfica-1 (2013-14)\n\nBohemians-1 (1927-28)\n\nCSKA Sofia-1 (1988-89)\n\nDerry City-1 (1988-89)\n\nLevski Sofia-1 (1983-84)\n\nManchester City-1 (2018-19)\n\nRhyl FC-1 (2003-04)\n\nWhat is a continental treble?\n\nA continental treble involves at least one trophy from the inter-continental level + two domestic trophies, eg. the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup) in Europe.\n\nHow many teams have won the continental treble?\n\nOnly seven teams have won the continental treble in European football.\n\nBarcelona- 2 (2008-09, 2014-15)\n\nBayern Munich- 2 (2012-13, 2019-20)\n\nAjax-1 (1971-72)\n\nCeltic-1 (1966-67)\n\nInter Milan-1 (2009-10)\n\nManchester United-1 (1998-99)\n\nPSV-1 (1987-88)\n\nWhich team last won the continental treble?\n\nBayern Munich won the last continental treble in the 2019/20 season. The team won the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League.\n\nWhich team can win the treble this season?\n\nManchester City is eyeing the continental treble for the first time in its history. Pep Guardiola has not won the treble since leaving Barcelona after the 2008-09 season.\n\nHas Manchester City won the treble before?\n\nMan City has won the domestic treble in the 2018-19 season but has failed to win the intercontinental treble so far.\n\nHow can Manchester City win its first ‘continental’ treble?\n\nAfter winning the Premier League and the FA Cup, Man City will take on three-time champions Inter Milan at the UEFA Champions League Final on 10 June.\n\nIf it wins the Champions League, it will win the treble, becoming only the second English club to do so, after Man United."
