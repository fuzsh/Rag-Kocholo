        "text": "Manchester City would not be guaranteed a spot in the EFL if alleged financial fair play breaches bring about their relegation from the Premier League.\n\nReigning top-flight champions City have been hit with multiple charges and accused of more than 100 breaches, relating to activities between 2009 and 2018. An independent commission is due to rule on the findings, though the club will be unable to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, something which saw them avoid a ban following previous charges brought by UEFA.\n\nA number of City's rivals are reportedly keen for them to be relegated from the Premier League if the charges are upheld. However, there would be no requirement for the EFL to accept the demoted club if that ends up happening.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the EFL - which oversees the Championship, League One and League Two - would have no obligation to accept a demoted City. Questions have been asked regarding any situation which might see the body forced to accommodate 73 clubs rather than the current 72.\n\nThe publication reports that the Premier League's independent disciplinary commission has it within its power to expel a club but not to relegate one to the tier below. The Premier League and EFL have not been overseen by the same body since the former competition came into being in 1992, but the current promotion and relegation system still allows clubs to move between the top two tiers of the English football pyramid from season to season.\n\nRelegation is not the only potential punishment for City, who will learn the next steps once the independent commission has addressed the charges brought against them. Other suggested measures - if the Premier League's charges are upheld - include points deductions or even the potential stripping of past league titles.\n\nWhat do you expect to happen to Manchester City? Have your say in the comments section\n\n\"Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with,\" a club statement read.\n\n\"The Club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent Commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position. As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.\""
