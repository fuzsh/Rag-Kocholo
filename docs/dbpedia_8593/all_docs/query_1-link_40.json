        "text": "Now, that was some weekend of football, eh? Manchester City wrapped up their fourth consecutive Premier League title while Jurgen Klopp signed off after a magnificent spell at Liverpool with a home win. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen continued their never-losing streak, and Marco Reus scored in his last league game for his boyhood club. Over in Spain, the penultimate weekend saw Alexander Sorloth score four against Real Madrid. Here, then, are the best stats from this weekend's action in Europe's big leagues:\n\nPremier League\n\n4\n\nManchester City are the first club in English top-flight history to win 4 straight league titles. They are also the 12th different club to win 4 straight league titles among clubs from Europe's top 5 leagues (It is also the 13th instance, as Real Madrid did it twice).\n\n27\n\nErling Haaland is the first player to retain the PL Golden Boot since Mohamed Salah (2017-18 and 2018-19). He scored 27 goals.\n\n10\n\nThis is the 10th time the Premier League title has been decided on the last day; all 10 times, the club that went into the final day on top of the table ended up winning the title.\n\n12\n\nPep Guardiola has won his 12th league title in his 15th season as a head coach. Only Sir Alex Ferguson (13 PL titles) has won more in Europe's top 5 leagues.\n\n40\n\nCole Palmer is the first Chelsea player with 40 goal contributions in a single season in all competitions since Didier Drogba had 42 in 2009-10.\n\n49\n\n2023-24 saw a joint-high number of own goals scored in the Premier League along with season 2013-14.\n\n143\n\nBrighton have made 143 changes to their starting XI in the Premier League this season; only Manchester United in 2013-14 (144) and Manchester City in 2019-20 (144) have ever made more in a single campaign in the competition.\n\nLaLiga\n\n1\n\nLamine Yamal is the first player under 18 years old with 10 goal contributions in one of Europe's top 5 leagues in a single season in the last 15 years.\n\n25\n\nLewandowski has scored 25 goals in all competitions this season -- his 13th consecutive season with at least 25 goals in all competitions since he last failed to score 25 goals in 2010-11, his first season outside of Poland.\n\n56\n\nAlexander Sorloth needed just 56 minutes to score 4 goals against Real Madrid, the second fewest minutes needed to score 4 goals in a LALIGA game vs Madrid. Emil√≠n scored his 4th against Real Madrid in the 50th minute on Sept. 24, 1944, for Real Oviedo..\n\nBundesliga\n\n1\n\nBayer Leverkusen, who had already won the first Bundesliga title in club history this season, is the first team in Bundesliga history (since 1963-64) to complete a season without a league loss (WDL: 28-6-0)\n\n7\n\nXabi Alonso's team is, in fact, the 7th unbeaten champion in one of Europe's top 5 leagues. What makes the achievement even more remarkable is that Leverkusen's final goal difference in the Bundesliga (+65) is the best by an unbeaten champion from Europe's top 5 leagues (breaking 1888-89 Preston North End's mark).\n\n90\n\nLeverkusen is the first club in over 90 years -and just the 4th ever- to win their first league title as an unbeaten team in the history of the top 7 European leagues (Real Madrid 1931-32, Athletic Club 1929-30, Preston North End 1888-89).\n\n120\n\nMarco Reus scored his 120th career Bundesliga goal with Borussia Dortmund, in his final league game with the club.\n\n13\n\nIt will be the first German Super Cup without Bayern Munich since 2011, 13 years on.\n\nLigue 1\n\n6\n\nKylian Mbappe finishes as the 2023-24 Ligue 1 leading scorer and tie Robert Lewandowski for the most consecutive seasons (6) as the leading scorer in one of Europe's top 5 leagues. Currently, Lewandowski's streak is in danger, as he trails Alexander Sorloth by 5 goals for the 2023-24 LALIGA Pichichi going into the final weekend: although you'd be wary before writing Lewandowski off."
