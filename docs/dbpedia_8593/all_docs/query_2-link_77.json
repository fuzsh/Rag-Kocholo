        "text": "Antonio BRYAN (d.o.b. 4.10.89)\n\nAntonio is a former Manchester United striker/ wide player. Known as \"Anton\", he joined United at the age of 12 and reached their reserve side. He was signed by the Reds on professional forms in summer 2008 but was allowed to leave Old Trafford in summer 2009. He joined Altrincham on 23 October 2009 and was an unused sub the next day at Mansfield in the FA Cup. He started against Oxford United in the BSP on 31 October but after opting to go for a trial at a League One club in preference to playing a Cheshire Senior Cup tie for Altrincham on 10 November, he was released. Appearances for Altrincham: 1.\n\nAaron BURNS (d.o.b. 8.11.1987)\n\nOn 22 September 2009, Alty signed Aaron Burns as an emergency one-month loan from Northwich Victoria. As early as October 2007, Graham Heathcote had tried to sign Burns, a former Manchester United trainee (released in June 2007), who had moved to Old Trafford from Wythenshawe Amateurs. As Aaron had then moved on to Afturelding, an Icelandic second division side and also Cardiff City, Altrincham even obtained international clearance for him - only to find that the FA would not allow him to sign for the Robins till January 2008. The FA deemed him to be of amateur status and therefore ineligible to join a BSP Premier side till the transfer window reopened. Instead of joining Alty, Burns went off to FC United who, being lower down the Pyramid, were allowed to sign him. FCUM released him in January 2008 and Aaron then moved on to Northwich Vics on an 18-month deal. Burns had therefore played for Alty before this season, featuring in a friendly against Ashton United at the time of the collapse of his move to Moss Lane in 2007.\n\nAaron made his Alty debut against Tamworth on 22 September 2009 but suffered a four-inch head wound against Gateshead on 29 September which sidelined him for a game. His loan was extended for a further month in mid-October but he then returned to Northwich after the game at Chester on 21 November. Appearances for Altrincham: 6(+3), 1 goal.\n\nMatthew CROWELL (d.o.b. Bridgend, 3 July 1984)\n\nAltrincham FC signed Welsh under-21 international midfielder Matty Crowell on 10 July 2009. His previous club was Northwich Victoria but he had begun his career at Southampton. Then, following a trial at Bristol City, he spent four years with Wrexham (2003-07) where he still lives. He signed for Northwich in January 2008 and made 52+4 league appearances for the Vics, scoring five goals. In late May 2009, Matty was having trials in Australia for Sydney Olympic and after just five games for Altrincham, on 28 August 2009 he accepted an offer to go back Down Under and play for Central Coast Mariners in the Australian \"A League\". He had looked to be forming a promising central midfield partnership at Altrincham with Tom Kearney during his short stay. Photo, www.altrinchamfc.com Appearances for Altrincham: 5, (1 goal).\n\nDanny HEFFERNAN (d.o.b. 25 May 1987, at Bolton)\n\nDanny was originally signed on first-team forms by Altrincham on 30 August 2006, following impressive displays for the Reserves. However, he did not appear for the first-team before leaving when the Reserves were disbanded. He followed Reserves' manager Neil Brown to Leek Town and then Abbey Hey. He was re-signed for Altrincham by Graham Heathcote in 2008 and made his debut as a substitute striker in a Setanta Shield match against Wrexham on 4th November 2008. A tall, versatile player who can operate on the left and up front, as well as in central defence or midfield, Danny has a strong left-foot shot. Prior to joining Altrincham Reserves, Danny had played in local South Manchester football for Fletcher Moss FC.\n\nDanny made his Alty league debut when he started the game at Barrow on 11 August 2009. After three starts and seven further sub appearances he was allowed to join New Mills in early October 2009, though his Conference registration remained at Moss Lane. Appearances for Altrincham: 3(+8) (0 goals).\n\nChris LANE (d.o.b. Liverpool, 24.5.1979)\n\nAltrincham signed Southport right-back Chris Lane on non-contract terms in late June 2007. Chris was born in Liverpool on 24th May 1979 and began his career, under the YTS Scheme, at Everton. In three years with the Toffees, he made 17 appearances for the reserve team. From Everton he moved, in 1998, to Hereford United in summer 1998 and made 57(+8) appearances for them. Southport's Mark Wright then acquired him for a fee of Â£12,000 in January 2001. After Southport had been relegated from the Conference in 2003, he moved up the coast to Morecambe in May, making his debut at Christie Park in August, 2003. The Shrimps released him in January 2004 and he next joined Leigh RMI, for two appearances, before moving on to Chester City in February 2004 as they went on to win the Conference title that season. He then went back to Leigh RMI in June 2004, making 40 appearances in 2004-05 before returning to Haig Avenue in May 2005, where he made 67(+4) appearances and was voted Port's Player of the Year last season.\n\nChris started the 2007-08 season against Exeter City on 11 August 2007 having already made 287 Conference appearances, the most of any current player at that time in the Blue Square Premier. After being an ever-present for Alty he moved to the bench for much of the second half of the 07-08 season but made important appearances playing in the hole in front of the back four. Chris is a very reliable defender with a strong will to win and he can also play at centre-back. He was released at the end of the 2008-09 season and joined Vauxhall Motors. Career appearances for Altrincham: 77+12, 3 goals.\n\nMark McGREGOR (d.o.b. Chester, 16.2.77, height 5ft 10ins)\n\nCentre-back Mark McGregor signed for Altrincham on 27 July 2008. Mark played for Port Vale last season and has more than 400 League appearances to his credit. It was for his first club, Wrexham, that he made the majority of those appearances (244), between 1995 and 2001. He then went on a free transfer in 2001 to Turf Moor but after 54 games for Burnley (2001-04), he moved to Blackpool (59 games between 2004 and 2006). Next, he played 66 times for Port Vale (2006-08). He joined Altrincham after a trial at Mansfield Town during the summer.\n\nMark was born at Chester on February 16, 1977. He made his debut for Altrincham in a friendly at Stalybridge on 25 July 2008 and his league debut on 9 August 2008 and established himself as a very reliable and efficient regular in the back-line. In the absence of the injured Robbie Lawton, Mark captained the side either side of Christmas 2008 and was ever-present until sidelined by injury in March 2009.\n\nOn the eve of the new season, Mark uexpectedly left to join GAP Connah's Quay, in the Welsh Premier, as player-manager on 28 July 2009. Career appearances for Altrincham: 49(+1), 1 goal.\n\nScott MOFFATT (d.o.b. 7 December 1990, in Openshaw, Manchester)\n\nAltrincham signed 18 year-old Manchester United reserve right-back Scott Moffatt on a month's loan on 31 August 2009 and he made his first start for Altrincham later that day, against Chester City. By coincidence, before signing Scott had only returned to action in a game played at Moss Lane the previous week. That game, for Manchester United Reserves, ended Scott's 18-month absence from the game due to knee surgery. In that game, he came on as a substitute and scored as United Reserves beat Bury Reserves 5-0. Scott signed as a scholar at MUFC in July 2007 and was a member of the United team which won the Champions' Youth Cup in 2007, and was also in the side which reached the FA Youth Cup final in 2006/07. However, Scott injured his thigh muscle in his second outing for Alty and was unable to play again before his loan expired. Appearances for Altrincham: 2, (0 goals)\n\nClive MOYO-MODISE (d.o.b. 22 September 1984, in London, height 5ft 10ins)\n\nAltrincham announced the signing of former Rochdale striker Clive Moyo-Modise on 12 February 2010. Clive had previously played in South Africa for Premier Soccer League club, Bidvest Wits, where he was deployed as a winger. He has played for South Africa under-23s and was included in training for South Africa's national team in early 2008. But he began his career at the Spotland club in 2005, for whom he made 2 + 26 first-team appearances. A pacey wide man, Clive asked to leave Altrincham to seek regular first-team football and was released in mid-March 2010. He briefly returned in pre-season 2010-11 but was not taken on again. Appearances for Altrincham: 0(+4), 0 goals. Picture courtesy of John Cawthorne.\n\nWarren PEYTON (d.o.b. Manchester, 13 December, 1979, Manchester)\n\nWarren is a tall left-sided midfielder/defender, signed by Altrincham on 11 November 2005 after a spell out of the game. He had previously been with Leigh RMI and before that he had experience at Rochdale, Bury, Doncaster Rovers and Nuneaton Borough. Whilst at Nuneaton, he was in the England semi-pro team. Warren made his Alty debut in central midfield on 12 November 2005 against Exeter City but was then suspended after a sending off at Forest Green. Warren has a fierce shot and is a useful taker of free-kicks and corners. For much of his Alty career he has played at left-back rather than his preferred position in left midfield. In 2007-08 he occasionally played in central midfield as well as on the left. Warren, a bricklayer by trade, built the 2007 turnstile block at the Golf Road End at Moss Lane. He is one of the fittest players at the club and, despite losing his place as new players arrived for the start of 2008-09, he deservedly regained it early in the campaign, only to be an irregular starter once more by the latter part of the campaign. Warren was released at the end of the 08/09 season and joined Stalybridge Celtic. Career appearances for Altrincham: 149+27, 8 goals"
