Watch soccer today on NBC Sports, Peacock Premium, Fubo and Sling Blue, among others.\n\nWatch the Premier League on Fubo:\n\nOur Pick:\n\nIncludes: Premier League, Liga MX, Ligue 1, + 84 Sports Channels 7-Day Free Trial\n\nPremier League TV schedule\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nOther than the Premier League schedule, we also have TV listings for Premiership clubs playing in the Champions League and Europa League, summer friendlies, domestic competitions such as the FA Cup and League Cup, and games featuring the England national team. Bookmark this Premier League TV schedule page and return to it often. You’ll find the latest schedule of TV games, in many cases posted before the information is released publicly.\n\nThis page continues to be the most reliable and accurate source for Premier League TV schedules in the United States. We have been providing this information for free since 2005. Our goal at World Soccer Talk is to help make it easier for soccer fans to watch games on TV and online.\n\nHow to watch the Premier League\n\nThe English Premier League schedule heavily revolves around three options options. Those are USA Network, NBC and Peacock. USA Network is available on most cable and satellite providers, and it generally has four or five games each matchday. NBC is the over-the-air channel. While it is also available on most TV packages, you can also access this channel with just an antenna NBC tends to have just one game each weekend, and that is Saturday at 12:30 p.m. ET. Finally, Peacock will carry the remaining games in the Premier League. Therefore, expect about five games exclusive to Peacock.\n\nIn terms of streaming, there are many benefits to having Peacock. There is a 24/7 Premier League channel with interviews and daily reports, and you can watch Goal Rush. This is the Premier League whiparound show that shows highlights as they happen during simultaneous kickoffs. Cord-cutters can also take advantage of Fubo. The streaming platform has both USA Network and NBC, and a Fubo free trial can give viewers a taste of watching each game that is not on Peacock.\n\nThe ideal combination for Premier League fans in the United States is using Peacock and Fubo, as these two services will join to open up every game of the season. Peacock is essential, as several games each week or weekend are on NBC’s streaming platform. Fubo can be an affordable option for the other two channels. Plus, it has 4K channel capability and the other channels that may feature on Championship Sunday, like CNBC.\n\nHistory of the Premier League\n\nOne of the most prominent and extensively watched Football Leagues in the world is the Premier League, often known as the English Premier League (EPL). It is the top division in English soccer.\n\nThe exciting contests, all-star rosters, and fierce competition have won over many new followers. But the Premier League we know today did not just develop suddenly; it has a rich and complex history that spans over three decades.\n\nStructure and rules\n\nTwenty teams compete in this league, which is directly affiliated with the English Football League (EFL) and uses a promotion and relegation system. The three worst-performing Premier League clubs are sent down, while the three best-performing EFL League One clubs are promoted to the Premier League.\n\nEvery club plays 38 games throughout the season, which normally runs from August to May. Saturday and Sunday afternoons are the most common playing times, with some weeknight games sprinkled throughout.\n\nDuring the course of a Premier League season, each club will play each other club twice. The victors get three points toward their overall rankings while the losers receive nothing. Because there are no playoffs in the Premier League, the club that finishes with the most points wins the title.\n\nEach year, the best four clubs in terms of points total enter the UEFA Champions League competition the following year. It is a yearly competition amongst the continent’s top soccer clubs, each of which is based on domestic achievement.\n\nOrigins and poor state of league\n\nThe league is new, having been conceived in the late 1980s in reaction to the decline of the sport in the UK. English club soccer had been struggling prior to the advent of the Premier League. Low attendance was not the only reason, the league also had a bad reputation for hooligans.\n\nDue to a lack of agreement, the 1985-86 season began without television coverage for the league. Major teams in the nation at the time were talking about forming their own league.\n\nAfter the tragedy at the 1985 European Cup Tournament at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, venues were neglected and English soccer teams were barred from competing in Europe.\n\nThe new league would not be affiliated with the Football League. Nonetheless, it would remain a component of the league structure, with the worst-finishing Premier League clubs relegated to the second level and the best teams from the second level being promoted to the top division.\n\nIn the early 1990s, there was a turning point for English soccer as the national team reached the semi-finals in the 1990 World Cup. Additionally, UEFA lifted the five-year ban on European competitions during the same year. Since then, the English game has experienced significant growth and is now considered the most-watched sports leagues worldwide.\n\nEnglish Premier League teams in the early 1990s felt the sport of soccer required a major overhaul for the sport’s long-term success. Thus, on 17 July 1991, the Founder Members Agreement was signed, formalizing the foundational ideas upon which the Premier League would be built.\n\nThe 22 teams of the First Division collectively withdrew from the Football League on February 20, 1992. On May 27, 1992, the Premier League was incorporated as a limited liability company.\n\nNew league to save English soccer\n\nIn light of the game’s potential success, new deals were struck with television networks. Sky was awarded the broadcasting rights, and they promptly made the show a five-hour event. The idea was heavily inspired by the American National Football League’s TV broadcasts, which included the introduction of Monday Night Soccer.\n\nEven though signing the initial TV agreement with pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB was a bold choice at the time, Sky has been there every step of the way and has been instrumental in taking the Premier League to where it is now. The first season of the Premier League kicked off on Saturday, August 15, 1992, with 22 teams.\n\nInaugural season and 90s action\n\nArsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon were the 22 founding clubs of the new Premier League.\n\nSix of these teams—Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur—have never missed a season in the Premier League.\n\nIn the first 1992-93 EPL season, Manchester United won the championship under the direction of manager Sir Alex Ferguson. The Red Devils’ supremacy would continue to grow from here, with this triumph serving as the catalyst for a string of subsequent championships.\n\nThe Premier League was always intended to be comprised of just 20 teams. In the 1994-95 season, four teams were demoted and two had been promoted, trimming the number of teams.\n\nThe new league wasted little time in upgrading stadium amenities, securing rich broadcast and sponsorship agreements, and luring some of the best players and coaches in the world.\n\nRise of “Big Four”\n\nAfter Liverpool and Arsenal’s ascent to serious competition in the 2000s, Chelsea won the Premier League in 2004-05 to break the duopoly. As a result of their consistent domination, the “Big Four” clubs—Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United—spent most of the decade at or near the top of the league standings and automatically qualified for the UEFA Champions League.\n\nDuring this time, just three more clubs qualified for the tournament. Arsenal earned the moniker “The Invincibles” during the 2003-04 season when the team became the first and, to this day, the only club to go the whole Premier League season unbeaten.\n\n“Big Four” turning into “Big Six”\n\nBy consistently cracking the top four, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City turned the “Big Four” into the “Big Six” in the years after 2009. After Everton had done so five years earlier, Tottenham finally made it into the top four in the 2009-10 season.\n\nHowever, the disparity between the “super clubs” and the rest of the Premier League has been criticized for continuing to widen as those teams have become more financially stable and successful. Since Blackburn Rovers in 1994-95, no team outside of the “Big Four” won the league until Manchester City in 2011-12. Leicester City in 2016 is the only smaller club other than Blackburn to win the EPL.\n\nThe “Big Six” teams have substantial wealth and influence off the field. They have argued that they are entitled to a larger cut of the pie because of the higher worldwide prominence of their clubs and the beautiful soccer they strive to play. Other clubs say the league’s future prosperity depends on the current revenue-sharing system, which serves to keep the league competitive.\n\nTV rights and financial power\n\nThe Premier League has the largest potential television viewership of any sports league, at 4.7 billion people worldwide. It is televised in 212 countries to 643 million households. The Premier League’s worldwide popularity is largely due to the league’s financial might.\n\nThe league’s local and international TV rights agreements have routinely set new highs, providing teams with a reliable revenue stream. Since the Premier League teams are so well-off, they are able to compete for the best players in the world.\n\nAs of 2023, the Premier League is placed first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on results in European tournaments over the preceding five seasons, ahead of Spain’s La Liga. Six English teams have won a record fifteen European championships. This makes the English Premier League the second most successful in terms of producing European Cup / UEFA winners.\n\nInclusion of other British clubs\n\nThere have been some non-English teams that have had significant impacts in this competition throughout the years. The Premier League has benefited greatly from the addition of these foreign teams, who have brought with them their own distinct playing styles, excellent players, and devoted fan bases.\n\nSwansea City’s elevation to the EPL in 2011 was the first time a Welsh team has played in the English top flight. On August 20, 2011, Swansea City hosted Wigan Athletic at the Liberty Stadium, making it the first Premier League game played outside of England.\n\nThe presence of Welsh clubs in the Premier League grew to two during the 2013-14 season with the inclusion of Cardiff City. However, following Cardiff City’s relegation after the 2018-19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.\n\nSome Scottish and Irish teams have sometimes been considered for promotion to the Premier League, although this has never come to fruition. In 1998, Wimbledon almost succeeded in moving to Dublin, Ireland, after receiving permission from the Premier League to do so, but the effort was thwarted by the Football Association of Ireland.\n\nEPL schedule: More resources\n\nWe offer several free resources to help you keep up with EPL games today and all current events.\n\nFirstly, download a complimentary copy of The Ultimate Soccer TV And Streaming Guide.
