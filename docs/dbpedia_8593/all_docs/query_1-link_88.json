        "text": "After a long summer break, 32 of the best soccer teams from across Europe begin their quest to be crowned continental kings when the group stage of the 2009-10 UEFA Champions League kicks off this week.\n\nDefending champions FC Barcelona, nine-time tournament winners Real Madrid, English powerhouse Manchester United, Italian giants Inter Milan and a host of usual suspects will all be trying to survive the opening round and progress through the knockout stage in order to earn a spot in the final next May at Madrid's Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nLast year, Barcelona won its third crown in team history, overpowering Manchester United in the final in Rome.\n\nWho will it be this year?\n\nCBC Sports commentators Nigel Reed and Jason de Vos, and CBCSports.ca soccer expert John F. Molinaro offer their analysis and predictions of Groups E, F, G and H. To read about Groups A, B, C and D, click here.\n\nGROUP E: Debrecen (Hungary), Fiorentina (Italy), Liverpool (England), Olympique Lyon (France)\n\nNigel Reed: Despite a somewhat uncertain start to the domestic season and a perceived lack of summer investment, Liverpool should be regarded as genuine contenders in Europe. I've long believed the Reds are more comfortable performing in the Champions League than they are in the hurly-burly of a typical English campaign.\n\nRafa Benitez' team should have few problems progressing as Group E winners, and the battle to join them will surely be a straight fight between Lyon and Fiorentina. The Frenchmen, finally deposed as domestic champions, have replaced Benzema with Argentine striker Lisandro Lopez, while the Italians may struggle having lost Brazilian star Felipe Melo to Juventus.\n\nDebrecen has the distinction of becoming the first Hungarian club in 14 years to qualify for the Champions League group stage. I fear they are in for a bumpy ride.\n\nPrediction: 1) Liverpool, 2) Fiorentina, 3) Olympique Lyon, 4) Debrecen\n\nJason de Vos: Liverpool lost Xabi Alonso this summer, and that might prove to be costly for the Scousers. Alberto Aquilani has been drafted in as his replacement, but the measure of how far Liverpool can go in this tournament will once again be determined by its two stars: Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres. It will be interesting to see how Benitez manages their playing time in the Premier League in order to maximize their benefit in Europe.\n\nThe loss of Benzema is a huge blow to the fortunes of Lyon. However, they have started their league campaign off in fine style, and they will once again prove to be difficult opposition both domestically and in Champions League play. They have brought in Lopez from FC Porto as Benzema's replacement, and the pressure will be on him to lead the line for the Lyonnais.\n\nIf Adrian Mutu can block out his financial woes (he was ordered to repay former club Chelsea a sum in excess of $25 million for breach of contract) and continue his fine goal-scoring form, Fiorentina could challenge for second place. Rising star Stevan Jovetic will be called on to support Adrian Mutu and Alberto Gilardino in attack.\n\nDebrecen are Hungary's first Champions League representative to reach the group stage in 14 years, and I'm afraid that this is where their campaign will end. Despite winning their domestic league in four of the last five seasons, they are unlikely to repeat such success against the big boys of Europe.\n\nPrediction: 1) Liverpool, 2) Lyon, 3) Fiorentina, 4) Debrecen\n\nJohn F. Molinaro: The addition of Glen Johnson was a good piece of business by Liverpool, as was Italian playmaker Aquilani, who will have his hands full trying to replace Alonso. My fear is that if they lose Gerrard or Torres for any length of time due to injury, the Reds will be in big trouble. They should win the group easily, though.\n\nWatch out for Fiorentina, because they have a solid team with veterans Mutu and Gilardino supported by an exciting crop of youngsters, especially Jovetic of Montenegro and Riccardo Montolivo.\n\nLopez has been firing bullets since joining Lyon in the off-season, but they have an aging and slow defence that can't be relied upon - what does it say when Jean-Alain Boumsong is one of your key starters?\n\nDebrecen did well to get to this stage of the tournament, but this is when they will be given their lovely parting gifts.\n\nPrediction: 1) Liverpool, 2) Fiorentina, 3) Lyon, 4) Debrecen\n\nGROUP F: FC Barcelona (Spain), Dynamo Kiev (Ukraine), Inter Milan (Italy), Rubin Kazan (Russia)\n\nReed: Of all the eight groups, this is the simplest section from which to predict the qualifiers. The Spanish and defending European champions will progress with the Italian champions - the only question is which will top the group and that will be decided following their head to head meetings.\n\nInter have the first opportunity to stake their claim when they host Barcelona on Matchday 1 and much will depend on how Samuel Eto'o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic perform against their former clubs.\n\nThe respective champions of Russia and the Ukraine will engage in a private battle to finish third and move into the Europa League, but will not pose a threat to either Barca or Inter.\n\nPrediction: 1) Barcelona, 2) Inter Milan, 3) Dynamo Kiev, 4) Rubin Kazan\n\nDe Vos: Barcelona won last year's tournament, and they go into this season as one of the favourites. No one has ever repeated as champions of this competition since it was switched to its current format, but don't let that dissuade you. Barca has a fantastic team full of the world's best players, and they will easily reach the next round.\n\nInter will join them in advancing, and I think it is just a question of who finishes in first place. Jose Mourinho will be desperate to beat Barcelona, if only to give his ego some more fuel. I can't wait to hear some of his comments in the lead up and aftermath of those two games - he is so arrogant it is truly amusing. Eto'o is a deadly finisher, and I wonder if Barcelona's decision to trade to Inter for Ibrahimovic will prove to be a mistake.\n\nBoth Russia's Rubin Kazan and the Ukraine's Dynamo Kiev will be battling it out for third place, and if I had to go for one of them it would be Kiev. Andriy Shevchenko has returned to his homeland after a number of poor seasons, and he will look to ignite a partnership up front with Artem Milevskiy. If they can come together as a pairing, Kiev could just nip the Russians for the bronze.\n\nPrediction: 1) Barcelona, 2) Inter Milan, 3) Dynamo Kiev, 4) Rubin Kazan\n\nMolinaro: This is a pretty straight forward group to predict.\n\nBarcelona are the defending champions and significantly strengthened their roster when they traded for Ibrahimovic, sending Inter Eto'o in the other direction to complete the trade deal. The Catalans boast the best player in the world (Lionel Messi), a star-studded midfield (Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Yaya Toure) and one of the most dangerous attacking fullbacks in the game in Dani Alves.\n\nThe pressure is on Mourinho after Inter bowed out in the second round last year. The Portuguese tactician was hired specifically to win this competition, so failing to qualify for the group stage is not an option. Lucky for him he can call upon players such as Diego Milito, Douglas Maicon and Thiago Motta.\n\nNot even the return of the prodigal son, Shevchenko, will be enough to help Kiev into the second round. Good luck to Kazan, because they're going to need it.\n\nPrediction: 1) Barcelona, 2) Inter Milan, 3) Dynamo Kiev, 4) Rubin Kazan\n\nGROUP G: Rangers (Scotland), Sevilla (Spain), Stuttgart (Germany), Unirea Urziceni (Romania)\n\nReed: Perennially overshadowed by the Spanish powerhouses of Real Madrid and Barcelona, Sevilla appear to be the class act in Group G. Any team which boasts Brazilian Luis Fabiano and veteran Freddy Kanoute in its ranks is going to be a handful for opponents. It's also worth noting Sevilla were second only to Barcelona in goals against during last season's La Liga campaign.\n\nFormer Liverpool defender Markus Babbel is in his first full season of management and after leading Stuttgart to third place in the Bundesliga, I fancy the typical German efficiency to edge out Rangers for the runners-up spot since the Scottish champions generally do not travel well in Europe.\n\nFormer Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu has performed a minor miracle with Champions League debutants Unirea Urziceni, but their inexperience at this level will surely be exposed.\n\nPrediction: 1) Sevilla, 2) Stuttgart, 3) Rangers, 4) Unirea Urziceni\n\nDe Vos: Signing Barcelona midfielder Alexandre Hleb on loan for a season was a good move for Stuttgart. If Hleb can rediscover the form he exhibited at Arsenal, he is a real asset to any team. The Germans also snapped up Pavel Progrebnyak from Zenit St. Petersburg, and he will be relied upon to stick the ball in the back of the net.\n\nSevilla finished third in La Liga last year, trailing the two traditional powerhouses of Spain, Barcelona and Real Madrid. They don't have any players who jump off the page at you, although Negredo was a good pick up from Madrid after scoring 19 goals for Almeria last year while there on loan. The weakness of this group should help them advance.\n\nRangers got rid of Barry Ferguson (finally!) this summer, and long-term I think that will be a good move for the club. They have no money, though, and haven't really signed anyone of note. When their backline is bossed by a 39-year-old in David Weir, you have to wonder whether they can really compete. Home field advantage will be the key for them, as Ibrox is not an easy place to get a result.\n\nUnirea Urziceni is another of those teams who go into the group stages with nothing to lose. People won't expect them to advance, so there is no real pressure on them. Working against them is the fact that their stadium is too small for UEFA's standards, so they will play their home games in Steaua Bucharest's stadium.\n\nPrediction: 1) Sevilla, 2) Stuttgart, 3) Rangers, 4) Unirea Urziceni\n\nMolinaro: After years of under-achievement, Sevilla have emerged as one of the top teams in Spain the past few seasons, and it's not hard to understand why. Los Rojiblancos play a direct, fast-paced and attacking brand of soccer, and have wonderfully skilled players such as Fabiano, Kanoute and Jesus Navas.\n\nStuttgart are a solid, well-organized team who improved significantly with the off-season additions of Hleb and Progrebnyak. They'll finish second.\n\nRangers don't have the quality or depth to compete in Europe's top club competition, while the Romanians are in for a rough ride.\n\nPrediction: 1) Sevilla, 2) Stuttgart, 3) Rangers, 4) Unirea Urziceni\n\nGROUP H: Arsenal (England), AZ Alkmaar (Netherlands), Olympiakos (Greece), Standard Liege (Belgium)\n\nReed: There are plenty of cynics in the U.K. who believe this will be the last season Arsenal gets to mix it up with Europe's elite. If they're right, the Gunners should at least enjoy a relatively easy passage into the knock out stages.\n\nArsene Wenger's side has been falling off the EPL pace for some years now but with the skills of Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Andrei Arshavin and Theo Walcott at his disposal, the French coach still has many potential match winners on his roster.\n\nAs regards second place, I'm taking Olympiakos to progress with Arsenal, based principally on the hostile Greek environment awaiting visiting teams, allied to the fact that neither the Dutch nor Belgian champions have any recent pedigree in the Champions League.\n\nPrediction: 1) Arsenal, 2) Olympiakos, 3) AZ Alkmaar, 4) Standard Liege\n\nDe Vos: Arsenal have arguably the easiest group, and I expect them finish in first place. The losses of Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure to nouveau-riche Manchester City is a blow, but with Fabregas back to full fitness, I expect a rejuvenated Arsenal to have a strong season. Arshavin is a tricky customer, and he and Van Persie will need to pick up the slack left by Adebayor's departure.\n\nAZ Alkmaar pulled off a minor miracle last season, topping the Dutch league ahead of traditional powerhouses PSV, Ajax and Feyenoord. They lost manager Louis Van Gaal to Bayern Munich in the summer, but his replacement, Ronald Koeman, has plenty of experience with which to cope.\n\nStandard Liege lost American defender Oguchi Onyewu to Milan in the off-season after the U.S. international performed exceptionally well at the Confederations Cup. Liege are led by 21-year-old Stefan Defour, a player who has the potential to play for one of Europe's big clubs.\n\nFormer Newcastle midfielder Temuri Ketsbaia is currently managing Olympiakos. If he manages anything like he played, his team will be unpredictable and hot-tempered. Despite reaching the group stages on 11 previous occasions, Olympiakos have never reached the next round. I don't expect that trend to change.\n\nPrediction: 1) Arsenal, 2) AZ Alkmaar, 3) Olympiakos, 4) Standard Liege\n\nMolinaro: After missing out for Arsenal in last season's Champions League, Arshavin will be chomping at the bit this time around. The Russian is one of the elite playmaking scorers in the game, and I have no doubt that he will easily guide the Gunners into the next round with the help of the inspirational Fabregas.\n\nSecond place is up for grabs between the other teams in this group, but I think it'll be AZ who emerge. Paraguayan defender Celso Ortiz and goalkeeper Sergio Romero of Argentina give the Dutch champions stability at the back, while Moroccan forward Mounir El Hamdaoui is a real live wire.\n\nLike a lot of Greek teams, Olympiakos finds it very difficult to pick up points away from home in this competition. Standard Liege's lack of quality players who can change the course of a game in an instant will be their undoing."
