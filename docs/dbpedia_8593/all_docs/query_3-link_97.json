        "text": "Eight of the best soccer teams from across Europe continue their quest to be crowned continental kings when the quarter-finals of the 2009-10 UEFA Champions League kicks off this week.\n\nReigning European champions FC Barcelona, English title holders Manchester United, and Italian giants Inter Milan will all be trying to progress through to the final four in order to earn a spot in the final at Madrid's Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nCBC Sports commentators Nigel Reed and Jason de Vos, and CBCSports.ca soccer expert John F. Molinaro offer their analysis and predictions for the first leg of the quarter-finals.\n\nBayern Munich (Germany) vs. Manchester United (England)\n\nNigel Reed: Can anyone stop Wayne Rooney? The golden boy of English football is enjoying the season of his life, which is good for club and optimistic for country ahead of the World Cup. He was an unknown 13 year old when United beat Bayern to claim the crown in 1999. Now Rooney is the star attraction.\n\nBayern have been getting back to their best this season but occasional inconsistency, highlighted by Saturday's home loss to Stuttgart, will not help their confidence. Their best, and probably only, hope of making the final four is to win on home soil and defend for their lives in the decider at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Germans can certainly cause problems with Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben on the flanks and United will have to neutralise that threat to keep Munich at bay. At the other end, Rooney's supporting cast of Dmitar Berbatov, Antonio Valencia, Nani and Ryan Giggs has too much combined ammunition to keep them off the score sheet.\n\nPrediction: Manchester United wins 2-1\n\nJason de Vos: Manchester United won their round of 16 series against AC Milan in the first leg, where a 3-2 victory on the road gave them a stranglehold on the series. That they then went on to win the home leg 4-0 only rubbed salt in the wounds of the Rossoneri.\n\nBayern Munich will be wary of a similar fate, and they will need to bounce back from a loss at home against Stuttgart on the weekend.\n\nIt is generally considered a bad idea to taunt your opponents prior to a big match, especially if those opponents happen to be one of the best teams in the world. Arjen Robben's assertion that Manchester United is a one-man team - that Wayne Rooney is the only reason they are successful right now - is ridiculous. He had better hope that Sir Alex Ferguson has an off day, as the wily Scot is likely to use Robben's claims to good effect in his pre-game talk.\n\nMunich should go into this game feeling confident, despite stumbling of late in the league. Robben is in fine form, and as we have seen from him recently, he is capable of producing sublime finishes.\n\nMiroslav Klose is a clinical goal scorer, and Manchester United defenders Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic will have their hands full containing the German international. Thomas Muller could be on the plane to South Africa this summer alongside Klose, and he is another player who United would be wise to shackle in the opening game.\n\nPrediction: 2-2 draw\n\nJohn F. Molinaro: Bayern is facing a crisis of confidence after losing their last two games in the German league, allowing Schalke to overtake them for the Bundesliga lead. What's more, Schalke hosts Bayern on Saturday in a key game in the title race, so expect Bayern's attention to be somewhat split coming into Tuesday's match with United.\n\nDutch winger Arjen Robben has been Bayern's bets player this season, but he's nursing an ankle injury and might not play in Tuesday's encounter. That would be a huge loss for the Germans, as Robben is the club's best attacking player and desperately needs him on the field to pull the creative string and score goals. Also, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger will be unavailable due to suspension.\n\nThe news isn't all bad for the German, though. Striker Mario Gomez and defender Martin Demichelis return from injury.\n\nBut the bad news is they have to play a United side that is flying high, both in Europe and in the Premier League. Wayne Rooney may just be the best striker in the world right now, and the Bayern defence will have all it can handle with him.\n\nFar from a one-man team, as Robben suggested, United is a well-constructed side with plenty of offensive weapons and depth in midfield. Darren Fletcher has especially been brilliant for the Reds, so look for him to pick apart the Germans with his defence-splitting passes.\n\nPrediction: Manchester United wins 2-0\n\nLyon (France) vs. Bordeaux (France)\n\nReed: It is a mark of the progression of the game in France that its two best teams have reached the quarter-finals. In one respect it's a shame Lyon and Bordeaux have been drawn together but it does guarantee French representation in the semifinals for the first time since Monaco in 2004.\n\nBoth teams will be in buoyant mood. Lyon is unbeaten at home in the Champions League and memorably accounted for Real Madrid's All-Stars exiting in the round of 16. Bordeaux, meanwhile, has won seven straight games home and away after drawing the opening group match at Juventus last September.\n\nLyon cruised past bottom club Grenoble on the weekend while the visitors must bounce back from their French League Cup loss to Marseilles. Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc had his wish granted to avoid Barcelona in the draw and will take heart that his team won on its last trip to Lyon in December.\n\nPrediction: 1-1 draw\n\nDe Vos: There will be at least one French team in the Champions League quarter-finals, but choosing which one will advance is a little bit like splitting hairs.\n\nJust two points separate Ligue 1 leaders Bordeaux from fourth-place Lyon, so there is little to choose between them. Lyon had the more difficult route to the quarter-finals, scoring a 75th minute equalizer away to Real Madrid, after winning the home leg of the tie by a score of 1-0. Their 2-1 aggregate victory was a shock to most people, who expected Cristiano Ronaldo and company to make it past the French side.\n\nBordeaux, on the other hand, saw off the challenge of Greek side Olympiacos who, it has to be said, are not in the class of Real Madrid.\n\nThat is how they got here, but who strikes first blood in this two-legged tie could determine the eventual winner. Bordeaux won their only league meeting this year, a 1-0 triumph in Lyon, so Laurent Blanc's men will not be overwhelmed by the task at hand.\n\nBordeaux lost the French Cup final 3-1 to Marseille this past weekend, and it is noteworthy that Blanc chose to shake up his line-up a little. That decision did not work in the Cup, but we will see if it pays dividends in the Champions League.\n\nPrediction: 1-1 draw\n\nMolinaro: As a long-time follower of French football, this is the quarter-final match-up that I'm looking forward to the most.\n\nLyon and Bordeaux are great rivals, always produce entertaining and dramatic games whenever they face off, and both sides are brimming with quality players.\n\nBordeaux has been the best team in this year's Champions League, going undefeated through the tournament thus far and winning their last seven games in the competition. But the Stade Gerland, Lyon's home, can be an intimidating place to play, so Laurent Blanc's men face a stern test.\n\nLyon has plenty of motivation heading into this match. They've been replaced by Bordeaux as the top French team in recent years, not to mention the fact that even though they knocked out Real Madrid in the previous round, they are still being overshadowed by their league rivals.\n\nLyon boasts a very effective attacking trio in playmaker Miralem Pjanic, the club's top scorer in the Champions League with four goals, Argentine forward Lisandro Lopez and Brazilian winger Michel Bastos. But Bordeaux has only conceded three goals in the tournament, so Lyon will not find the going easy at all.\n\nBoth teams will be missing players for Tuesday's match. Bordeaux will be without captain Alou Diarra (suspended) and Marc Planus (injury). Lyon center-back Jean-Alain Boumsong, who injured his calf in the second leg against Real Madrid, is doubtful.\n\nIn the end, playmaker Yoann Gourcuff and forward Marouane Chamakh will provide the difference for Bordeaux, giving them a key victory on the road and the advantage going into the second leg.\n\nPrediction: Bordeaux wins 1-0\n\nArsenal (England) vs. FC Barcelona (Spain)\n\nReed: Can anyone stop Lionel Messi? Someone had to draw the short straw in the quarter-finals and Arsene Wenger's heart must have sunk when Arsenal was paired with the reigning European champions. The Argentine wizard can win games by himself and Barca is in no mood to give up their crown.\n\nThe Gunners, though, are no mugs and amply demonstrated their strength at home by embarrassing Porto in the round of 16. They won't expect to beat Barcelona by such a margin but Wenger's men must build a platform to defend in the decider. In Cesc Fabregas, Arsenal has a potential match winner.\n\nThe Spaniard, consistently linked with a return to Barcelona where he learned his trade as a teenager, has scored 18 goals this season from midfield. His creativity is the key to unlocking the visitors defence. The pace of Andrei Arshavin can also upset them as the Gunners seek revenge for the 2006 final.\n\nPrediction: Arsenal wins 2-1\n\nDe Vos: Two words: Lionel Messi.\n\nWhile Wayne Rooney is having an incredible season for Manchester United, Lionel Messi is still the best player in the world.\n\nCapable of wriggling his way out of the stickiest of situations, Messi is scoring goals at will of late. There is no doubt that there will have been a few sleepless nights for Arsenal's back line leading up to the opening leg of their quarter-final with Barcelona.\n\nThe thought of having to contain Messi right now must be frightening for Arsenal, whose defenders, it has to be said, can sometimes be less than stellar.\n\nThat being said, Arsenal have demonstrated a steely determination of late, and they are still hanging in there in the race for the Premier League title, despite most people's early season expectations that they would fall by the wayside. If Fabregas and Arshavin are on form, they might have just enough to cause Barcelona some concern of their own.\n\nPrediction: 1-1 draw\n\nMolinaro: It's not all about Lionel Messi with Barcelona.\n\nYes, the Argentine whiz kid is the best player on the planet and capable of single-handedly deciding games on his own. But the Catalans also have a full roster of world-class players that can hurt you, including Xavi Hernandez, Thierry Henry, Dani Alves, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and a host of others.\n\nOne player who won't be in London is Andres Iniesta. The talented Spaniard is nursing a hamstring injury and Barca doesn't want to risk him. The Gunners catch a bit of break, but not much, because Messi is in top form lately, I suspect that he and Henry, returning to his old club, will run circles around the Arsenal defence.\n\nThat's not to suggest Arsenal doesn't have outstanding stars themselves. Andrei Arshavin is one of the most dangerous players in the Premier League and in Cesc Fabregas, the Gunners possess one of the best playmaking midfielders in the world. Fabregas will be looking to shine against the team with whom he learned his trade, but that alone won't be enough to propel the Gunners to victory.\n\nBarca is the best team in the world and too hot right now for any club to handle. The only side that can stop Barcelona is Barcelona itself.\n\nPrediction: Barcelona wins 2-0\n\nInter Milan vs. CSKA Moscow (Russia)\n\nReed: The Special One weaved his magic to eliminate Chelsea and has been rewarded with a straightforward route to the semifinals. Inter manager Jose Mourinho came up with a tactical master class in the previous round and now it's full steam ahead to the final four.\n\nThat must be how it seems to the Inter fans but they would do well to remember the Russian's resilience which overcame Sevilla in the round of 16. If the mark of a good team is how it responds to defeat, we will see just how good Inter are following their crucial Serie A loss to title rivals Roma on the weekend.\n\nInter, at their best, can kill this tie stone dead after the first leg and Mourinho's men have been impeccable of late on home soil. CSKA's adventurous tactics worked in Spain but the task will be much tougher in Italy. Russian goalie Igor Akinfeev will be under siege and sooner or later the cracks will appear.\n\nPrediction: Inter Milan wins 2-0\n\nDe Vos: I love Jose Mourinho. For pure entertainment value, there is no better manager in world football.\n\nBut he is not just a series of brash statements and bold predictions. His tactical awareness is superb, and he has shown that time and time again, he is capable of outthinking his counterpart in the opposing dugout.\n\nInter surprised many people by seeing off Chelsea, and they must guard against complacency against the underdogs from Russia.\n\nCSKA also pulled off a surprise in the previous round, as it was expected that Sevilla would get the job done against the Russians on home soil. It wasn't to be though, and CSKA now find themselves up against an even better opponent in Inter Milan.\n\nI expect them to be outplayed on the pitch, and outthought in the dugout.\n\nPrediction: Inter Milan wins 2-0\n\nMolinaro: I foolishly wrote off CSKA in the previous round, only to see them stun Sevilla and book their place in the quarter-finals. I won't make the mistake of underestimating the Russians so quickly this time around, especially with Inter facing a series of problems.\n\nFor starters, the team's confidence is lagging after suffering a 2-1 loss to AS Roma on Saturday, a result that allowed the capital city club to climb within a point of front-runners Inter.\n\nFurthermore, the Nerazzurri will be without three key players for Wednesday's home tilt against CSKA: exciting left-back Davide Santon is injured, while centre-back Lucio and influential midfielder Tiago Motta are both suspended.\n\nCSKA, meanwhile, will have be able to make use of a full-strength side in Italy. Chilean winger Mark Gonzalez, Japanese midfielder Keisuke Honda and Czech striker Tomas Necid form the nuclease of an attacking Moscow club that will put pressure on an under-fire Inter defence, especially on without Lucio, who was brilliant in the previous round against Chelsea.\n\nStill, I think Inter have more depth and quality players than their opponents. They're also hungrier, and I suspect that coach Jose Mourinho will once again rely on his tactical guile to lead the Italians to victory in this one.\n\nPrediction: Inter Milan wins 1-0"
