        "text": "Manchester City could be stripped off their Premier League titles if they are deemed to have breached Financial Fair Play Restrictions.\n\nAn extraordinary statement from the Premier League announced the club have been charged with allegedly breaching financial fair play regulations in the seasons beginning in the 2009/10 campaign all the way up to the 2017/18 season. They are under suspicion of more than 100 alleged breaches.\n\nCity could be handed a hefty points penalty and could even be expelled from the Premier League entirely. During this period, City won three Premier League titles.\n\nRead More: How Premier League table will look if Man City are docked same points as Juventus\n\nThey won their first title in the top division in the 2011/12 season, before lifting the trophy again in 2014 and 2018. Fierce rivals Manchester United were runners-up to the sky blues in 2012 and 2018, while Liverpool here pipped to the title by Manuel Pellegrini’s side in 2014.\n\nHowever, if City are to be stripped off these titles, their accolades will not be handed down to Liverpool and United. As was the case when Juventus were stripped off their 2004/05 and 2005/06 Serie A titles, in the wake of the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal, the Premier League would not hand the titles to the club in second.\n\nInstead, the campaigns would be classed as having no victors at all. City have responded to the Premier League statement detailing the rules they are alleged to have broken.\n\nThe Citizens stated they were “surprised” by the allegations and are determined to fight the charges. “Manchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with,” a firm statement from the club read.\n\n“The Club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent Commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.\n\n“As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.”\n\nRead Next:"
