        "text": "The Premier League has charged Manchester City with several alleged breaches of its financial rules after a four-year investigation.\n\nIt announced the extraordinary news on Monday in a 735-word statement that set out the 100-plus alleged breaches.\n\nThe statement â published without fanfare on the Premier League's website and listed below articles on Harry Kane, Sean Dyche and FPL tips â said City have been âreferred to an independent commissionâ over the alleged rule-breaking.\n\nBut what is the commission? What are the rules City are alleged to have broken? And what happens next?\n\nThe Premier League's statement was packed full of detail but was difficult for anybody not familiar with legalese to break down. We've done exactly that and you can find an annotated version below.\n\nYou can read the Premier League's full statement without our annotations here.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1, the Premier League confirms that it has today referred a number of alleged breaches of the Premier League Rules by Manchester City Football Club (Club) to a Commission under Premier League Rule W.3.4.\n\nAt the beginning of its statement, the Premier League confirms it has charged Manchester City with âa numberâ (at least 100) breaches of its financial rules.\n\nRule W.82.1 stipulates that the Premier League will make disciplinary proceedings public in the event of them being referred to an independent commission. Rule W.3.4 simply states that the Premier League's board has the authority to refer issues to a commission in the first place.\n\nThe chair of the independent Premier League judicial panel is Murray Rosen KC, who was appointed in 2020.\n\nThe Premier League published its statement on Monday (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSection one\n\nDetails of the Premier League Rules that the Club is alleged to have breached are as follows:\n\n1. In respect of each of Seasons 2009/10 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those seasons that required provision by a member club to the Premier League, in the utmost good faith, of accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club's financial position, in particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2009/10, Premier League Rules B.13, C.71, C.72, C.75 (amended to C.79 from 10 September 2009 for the remainder of Season 2009/10) and C.80;\n\nCity finished the 2009-10 season fifth in the Premier League and qualified for the Europa League play-offs. They sacked manager Mark Hughes in December 2009, replacing him with Roberto Mancini. They signed Carlos Tevez, Emanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Gareth Barry among others.\n\nRule B.13 relates to City having acted towards the league and other clubs âin the utmost good faithâ. It will be referenced again in the statement's later sections.\n\nRules C.71 and C.72 relate to the submission of City's accounts (to the registrar of companies), while C.75 is regarding their projected profit and loss accounts in their application for a UEFA club licence to play European football. Premier League clubs are obligated to submit their accounts for auditing every year.\n\nRule C.80, meanwhile, refers to City's provision of tickets to visiting clubs to their stadium (then-named City of Manchester Stadium, now called the Etihad Stadium).\n\n(b) for Season 2010/11, Premier League Rules B.13, C.78, C.79, C.86 and C.87;\n\nIn 2010-11, City won the FA Cup, finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the Champions League. Their signings that year included James Milner, David Silva, Yaya Toure and Edin Dzeko. The City of Manchester Stadium also became the Etihad Stadium.\n\nRules C.78 and C.79 again refer to the club's accounts from the previous financial year, specifically to their profit and loss report and revenue streams.\n\nRules C.86 and C.87 relate to their âfuture financial informationâ, also including profit and loss accounts, as well as cash flows and balance sheets.\n\n(c) for Season 2011/12, Premier League Rules B.13, E.3, 4, E.11 and E.12;\n\nDuring this season, City claimed their first Premier League title with Mancini at the helm. Their signings included Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Sergio Aguero.\n\nSection E of the Premier League rulebook for the 2011-12 season refers to the rules regarding fixtures â from 2012-13 onwards, they instead refer to club accounts and finances, as detailed below.\n\n(d) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules 16, E.3, E.4, E.11 and E.12;\n\nThe 2012-13 campaign saw City finish second in the Premier League. Jack Rodwell, Javi Garcia and Maicon were among the notable additions to the playing squad. Mancini was sacked at the end of the season.\n\nRules E.3 and E.4 relate to the submission of the club's most recent annual accounts, including a balance sheet, a breakdown of profit and loss and revenue streams.\n\nRules E.11 and E.12, meanwhile, refer to the club's financial projections, again including profit and loss, cash flow and balance sheets.\n\n(e) for Season 2013/14, Premier League Rules 15, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.49;\n\nCity won the Premier League title in 2013-14 with Manuel Pelligrini at the helm. They also reached the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time.\n\nCity bought Fernandinho, Jesus Navas, Stevan Jovetic and Alvaro Negredo.\n\nRule E.49 states that a club must inform the Premier League if any of their accounts or financial projections are likely to change, adversely or otherwise, from their previous statements.\n\n(f) for Season 2014/15, Premier League Rules 16, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.50;\n\nCity finished second in the Premier League in the 2014-15 season and again reached the last 16 of the Champions League. Eliaquim Mangala, Wilfried Bony and Bacary Sagna were their standout additions.\n\nRule E.50 is the same as Rule E.49 above.\n\n(g) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules 16, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.50;\n\nThe 2015-16 season was Pelligrini's last in charge of City and saw them finish fourth in the Premier League while reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. They also won the League Cup.\n\nCity's transfer business included signing Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Nicolas Otamendi.\n\n(h) for Season 2016/17, Premier League Rules16, E.3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.51; and\n\nPep Guardiola took over at City ahead of the 2016-17 season and guided the club to a third-placed finish in the Premier League. John Stones, Leroy Sane, Ilkay Gundogan and Gabriel Jesus headlined their summer arrivals.\n\nRule E.51 is the same as Rules E.50 and E.49 above.\n\n(i) for Season 2017/18, Premier League Rules B.16, 3, E.4, E.11, E.12 and E.51.\n\nCity won the Premier League and League Cup in 2017-18. Their transfer expenditure reached new levels, with Ederson, Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker joining during the summer and Aymeric Laporte signing in January.\n\nRule B.16 again refers to acting in âthe utmost good faithâ in matters between City, the Premier League and other clubs.\n\nManchester City won the title in 2017-18 (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSection two\n\n2. In respect of:\n\n(a) each of Seasons 2009/10 to 2012/13 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to include full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager, namely:\n\n(1) for Seasons 2009/10 to 2011/12 inclusive, Premier League Rules Q.7 and Q.8; and\n\n(2) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules P.7 and P.8; and\n\n(b) each of Seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to include full details of player remuneration in its relevant contracts with its players, namely:\n\n(1) for Seasons 2010/11 and 2011/12, Premier League Rules K.12 and K.20;\n\n(2) for Season 2012/13, Premier League Rules T.12 and T.20;\n\n(3) for Seasons 2013/14 and 2014/15, Premier League Rules T.12 and T.19; and\n\n(4) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules T.13 and T.20.\n\nThe second set of alleged breaches also refers to requirements for a club to include full details of player remuneration within the relevant contracts, for the seasons 2010-11 to 2015-16.\n\nFurther alleged breaches relate to rules requiring full details of manager remuneration between the 2009-10 and 2012-13 seasons, when Roberto Mancini was in charge.\n\nRules Q.7 and Q.8 (and then Rules P.7 and P.8) refer to clubs' contracts with their managers. Specifically, that the terms of the contract are clearly written out and registered with the Premier League.\n\nRule T.12 states that the full details of players' salaries and bonuses are set out in their contracts. Rules T.12 and T.20 are the same as Rules K.12 and K.20, respectively.\n\nManchester City CEO Khaldoon Al Mubarak with Guardiola (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSection three\n\n3. In respect of each of Seasons 2013/14 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons requiring a member club to comply with UEFA's regulations, including UEFA's Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2013/14, Premier League Rule B.14.6; and\n\n(b) for Seasons 2014/15 to 2017/18 inclusive, Premier League Rule B.15.6.\n\nThe third section of the statement deals with alleged breaches of Premier League rules requiring clubs to comply with UEFA financial fair play (FFP) regulations, which were in place between 2013-14 to 2017-18.\n\nIn February 2020, Manchester City were banned from European competitions for two years by UEFA for alleged breaches of its FFP regulations. But this punishment was eventually overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nSection four\n\n4. In respect of each of the Seasons 2015/16 to 2017/18 inclusive, the Premier League Rules applicable in those Seasons on Profitability and Sustainability, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2015/16, Premier League Rules E.52 to E.60; and\n\n(b) for Seasons 2016/17 and 2017/18, Premier League Rules E.53 to E.60.\n\nThe fourth set of alleged breaches relates to the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules from seasons 2015-16 to 2017-18.\n\nThese are similar to UEFA's FFP rules, albeit more lenient, and make clear exactly how clubs are permitted to spend their income.\n\nThe Premier League has charged Manchester City with breaching these rules in 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18.\n\nUEFA wanted to ban City from European competition (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSection five\n\n5. In respect of the period from December 2018 to date, the Premier League Rules applicable in the relevant Seasons requiring a member club to cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations, including by providing documents and information to the Premier League in the utmost good faith, namely:\n\n(a) for Season 2018/19, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;\n\n(b) for Season 2019/20, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;\n\n(c) for Season 2020/21, Premier League Rules B.16, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12 and W.13;\n\n(d) for Season 2021/22, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16; and\n\n(e) for Season 2022/23, Premier League Rules B.15, B.18, W.1, W.2, W.15 and W.16.\n\nManchester City won the Premier League title in three of the above five seasons. They came second in 2019-20, behind Liverpool. This season, they sit in second behind Arsenal.\n\nDuring that period, they signed 19 first-team players for more than Â£550m.\n\nTen Premier League rules are referenced in the fifth section of the statement: rules B.15, B.16, B.18, B.19, W.1, W.2, W.12, W.13, W.15 and W.16.\n\nSection B of the Premier League's rulebook relates to the âgovernanceâ of the league. The rules above specifically relate to clubs interacting with the Premier League âwith the utmost good faithâ.\n\nSection W deals with the Premier League's âdisciplinary and dispute resolutionâ process. As touched on above, the sections make clear the Premier League board has the authority to deal with these issues, as well as request confidential information from clubs where necessary.\n\nConclusion\n\nCommissions are independent of the Premier League and member clubs. The members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel, in accordance with Premier League Rules W.19, W.20 and W.26.\n\nThe proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission's final award will be published on the Premier League's website.\n\nThis confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1. The Premier League will be making no further comment in respect of this matter until further notice.\n\nThe final part of the Premier League's statement is easier to understand and outlines the next steps.\n\nThe statement makes clear the members of the commission will be appointed by the Premier League's judicial panel â which has 15 members and an appeal panel of six members, to adjudicate disciplinary cases referred to it.\n\nRules W.19, W.20 and W.26. are again referred to. The latter refers to the chair of the judicial panel being expected to appoint a commission to hear the complaint âas soon as reasonably practicalâ.\n\nThe statement ends by saying the Premier League will not be commenting on the issue. The Athletic contacted the Premier League before publishing this article and, true to its word, it declined to provide any additional information.\n\nCity say they are âsurprisedâ by the charges (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nManchester City's response\n\nâManchester City FC is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.\n\nâThe club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position.\n\nâAs such, we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.â\n\n(Photo: Getty Images; contents from The Athletic)"
