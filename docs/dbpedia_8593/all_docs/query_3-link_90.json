        "text": "Arsenal’s loss at Nottingham Forest on Saturday ensured that Manchester City will end the season as Premier League champions. This title, the third in a row for City, looked unlikely at one stage but a three-month unbeaten run has catapulted them to the top of the table.\n\nThis year’s title is Manchester City’s seventh Premier League triumph, their fifth under the guidance of Pep Guardiola. The City boss has now won five titles in the last six seasons, in addition to his incredible trophy haul from Barcelona and Bayern Munich.\n\nAcross his 14 seasons as a manager, Guardiola has won the league on 11 occasions.\n\nHere’s how Guardiola’s league titles as a manager break down:\n\nBarcelona, La Liga: 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11\n\nBayern Munich, Bundesliga: 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16\n\nManchester City, Premier League: 2017/18, 2018/19, 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23\n\nGuardiola gets a hat trick of hat tricks\n\nIn winning the title again this season, Manchester City become just the fifth club in English football history to be crowned champions in three consecutive seasons. Here’s the other sides to have achieved that feat:\n\nHuddersfield Town: 1923/24, 1924/25, 1925/26\n\nArsenal: 1932/33, 1933/34, 1934/35\n\nLiverpool: 1981/82, 1982/83, 1983/84\n\nManchester United: 1998/99, 1999/2000, 2000/01 and 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09\n\nGuardiola has now secured a hat trick of league titles at all three of the teams that he has managed. What makes that achievement even more incredible is that he only managed at Barcelona for four seasons and Bayern for just three.\n\nGuardiola guns for a second treble\n\nThe Spanish coach’s crowning achievement of his managerial career to date widely considered to be the treble he won in his first season as a coach. After taking over Barcelona in 2008 he swept aside all competition to win the treble of LaLiga, Copa del Rey and Champions League.\n\nHe followed that up with a double (LaLiga and Champions League) in 2010/11 but he has not tasted continental success since then. He reached the semi-final stage with Bayern Munich and lost in the final in 2021 with City, but is yet to win the Champions League since leaving Barça.\n\nHowever this season he stands on the brink of another Champions League triumph after a resounding victory over Real Madrid in the semi-final. His side face Inter Milan in the final and are strong favourites to be crowned European champions.\n\nThe weekend before that final in Istanbul, City will face Manchester United in the FA Cup final.\n\nNow that the league is secured, Guardiola’s side have two cup finals to cement their place in history."
