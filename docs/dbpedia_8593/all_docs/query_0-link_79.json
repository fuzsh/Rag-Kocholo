        "text": "The Premier League have charged Manchester City with dozens of breaches of financial rules. It follows a four-year investigation into the club's financial status, and the charges in total date from the 2009/10 season to this season.\n\nCity are alleged to have breached league rules requiring provision “in utmost good faith” of “accurate financial information that gives a true and fair view of the club’s financial position”. The league says the accurate financial information required related to “revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs”.\n\nSome of the alleged breaches are related to rules which require clubs to co-operate and assist the Premier League with their investigations.\n\nREAD MORE:City issue response to Premier League allegations\n\nPremier League rule W.51 covers the sanctioning powers available to commissions should alleged breaches of league rules be found proven.\n\nThese range from a reprimand, through the deduction of points up to a recommendation to the league to expel a club from the competition. The commission has the power to make such sanctions conditional on defined actions being taken within a fixed time period, and respondents have a right of appeal.\n\nThe club have always vehemently denied any breaches of financial rules and have issued a statement which says: \"\"Manchester City Football Club is surprised by the issuing of these alleged breaches of the Premier League rules, particularly given the extensive engagement and vast amount of detailed materials that the EPL has been provided with.\n\n\"The club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent Commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position. As such we look forward to this matter being put to rest once and for all.\"\n\nThe second set of breaches listed refers to the alleged breaking of rules “requiring a member club to include full details of manager remuneration in its relevant contracts with its manager” related to seasons 2009-10 to 2012-13 inclusive. The club’s manager between December 2009 and May 2013 was current Italy boss Roberto Mancini.\n\nThe second set of alleged breaches also refers to requirements for a club to include full details of player remuneration within the relevant contracts, for the seasons 2010-11 to 2015-16 inclusive.\n\nThe third section deals with alleged breaches of Premier League rules requiring clubs to comply with UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations, between 2013-14 to 2017-18.\n\nCity were banned from UEFA competitions for two years by European football’s governing body for alleged breaches of its FFP regulations in February 2020, but the sanction was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in July of the same year.\n\nThe fourth set of alleged breaches relates to the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules in seasons 2015-16 to 2017-18 inclusive.\n\nFinally, the club are alleged to have breached league rules requiring member clubs to co-operate with and assist the Premier League with its investigations, from December 2018 to date.\n\nThe Premier League statement concluded: “The proceedings before the Commission will, in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82, be confidential and heard in private. Under Premier League Rule W.82.2, the Commission’s final award will be published on the Premier League’s website.\n\n“This confirmation is made in accordance with Premier League Rule W.82.1.
