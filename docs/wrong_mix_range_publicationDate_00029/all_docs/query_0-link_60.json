        "text": "Ben Lincoln\n\nI'm a professional security consultant/penetration tester.\n\nI've worked in the technology industry since 1994, when I was in high school and got a job doing Macromedia Director work for a small company in my hometown which produced multimedia CDs.\n\nI've also worked as a UI developer at an internet startup before they were called \"dot-coms\" (Intermind), a systems admin for a student newspaper at Simon Fraser University (where I studied electronic music composition), and a systems engineer at a retail corporation in Seattle. In 2011 I moved into information security, and in less than a year decided I wanted to specialize in penetration testing. In the summer of 2015 I earned an Offensive Security Certified Professional certificate, and I highly recommend the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux course which leads up to it.\n\nA few months later, I also obtained GXPN (GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester) certification. I recommend SANS SEC660 (the course which covers the material in the exam), especially if you can take the course as taught by Stephen Sims. I had to let the GXPN cert lapse in 2019 because the total cost to renew it would have been too much for me to pay out of pocket :/.\n\nAside from my duties as a computer nerd, I like to explore the real world, which you can read about in the Drives section. I enjoy a lot of music - particularly industrial, darkwave, and metal.\n\nI have four tattoos - a barcode on my right forearm, Kain's clan symbol (from the Legacy of Kain series) on my left upper arm, Schr√∂edinger's wavefunction equation on my left forearm, and the symbol I designed for myself on my right upper arm. I think of them as reminders to myself and advertisements to others of particularly strong aspects of my personality - I am very interested in science (and particularly the eerie aspects of quantum physics), I am clearly particularly fond of Legacy of Kain, and was strongly influenced by cyberpunk fiction like Neuromancer and Blade Runner."
