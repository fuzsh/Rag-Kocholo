        "text": "I'm so excited! We have Book Two in the Gothic Gwyn Mysteries series! I can hardly wait to read Let No Clan Put Asunder by the talented Judith Sterling. In the meantime, I thought you'd enjoy a look at this new cozy mystery. This time around, there's a Scottish vibe to the story. Really, what more could we ask for?\n\n“It was no small thing to marry into the Donnachaidh clan, and there was nowhere to hide from its past.\n\nSo states the tagline of the gothic mystery Gwyneth Camm discovers out of place—not once, but twice—inside her newly inherited Salem home. Her deceased Aunt Ethel seems determined she read the book, and once again, Gwyn finds herself sucked into a gothic romance, inhabiting the body of its heroine.\n\nThis time, she’s a young bride in 1970 on her way to a clifftop castle that harbors secrets, Scottish legacies, hidden malice, and…a vampire? Only by learning the truth can she return to her own life, where yet another puzzle awaits.\n\nExcerpt\n\nJust before midnight, I tiptoed across the darkened drawing room. Anyone might be hiding in the shadows, including the black obscurities high on the vaulted ceiling. Those in particular could cloak something inhuman.\n\nA shiver trickled down my spine, and I paused. Do I really want to do this? The bottom line: I had to if I wanted to further the plot and solve the mystery of Alistair’s disappearance.\n\nI continued to the chapel. Once inside, I reached for the brass light switch on the wall to my right—the same switch Fiona used while playing tour guide—and flicked it. Nothing happened. Darkness reigned supreme, apart from two small flames in a votive candle stand near the altar.\n\nHad the lightbulbs burned out? Did the circuit breaker trip?\n\nNo. Someone planned it.\n\nNot a comforting thought. I dared not dwell on it, or I’d lose my nerve. Determined, I hurried to the arched portal that led to the crypt and tried the light switch Garrett had used earlier. It, too, refused to work.\n\nAn unbridled shudder ran through me. There was something creepy about a church at night, especially one flooded by darkness. Donnachaidh’s chapel was no exception. The absence of light seemed to twist the sacred into the profane and awaken primal fears. What manner of evil, arcane and unseen, slithered along the stone and woodwork of this lonely place?\n\nAll right. That’s enough. I squared my shoulders. The lights don’t work? Fine. I’ll use a candle.\n\nI hastened to the votive stand. I wouldn’t take either of the lit candles; not only did they represent someone’s prayers, but the glass vessels were likely too hot to hold. I grabbed a fresh candle, held the wick to one of the flames, and put it into an unused vessel. Light in hand, I returned to the archway and padded down the spiral stairs.\n\nI hesitated at the bottom. Beyond the limited scope of my candle, the crypt was pitch-black. The air was charged with an ominous silence.\n\nNerves aflutter, I cleared my throat. The sound seemed as loud as an avalanche. “Is anyone here?”\n\nA silly question, really. If someone were there, they’d let me know it. Unless they wanted to scare me.\n\nOr harm me. I swallowed hard and crept forward.\n\nDavid Robertson’s tomb. The thought popped into my head and wouldn’t be denied. Intuition or something more? Whatever the case, I obeyed, veering to the right. As I neared the tomb, I halted. The black bouquet was still there, but someone had altered it. Every last petal had been plucked and strewn around the base of the sarcophagus. I inched closer.\n\nNo, not plucked. Torn from the stems and ripped to shreds.​​\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJudith Sterling is an award-winning author whose love of history and passion for the paranormal infuse everything she writes. Through gothic cozy mystery (The Gothic Gwyn Mysteries), medieval/time travel romance (The Novels of Ravenwood), and young adult paranormal fantasy (the Guardians of Erin series), she loves to whisk readers away from their troubles and remind them of the hidden magic all around us.\n\n​\n\nHer nonfiction books, written under Judith Marshall, have been translated into multiple languages. She has an MA in linguistics and a BA in history, with a minor in British Studies. Born in that sauna called Florida, she craved cooler climes, and once the travel bug bit, she lived in England, Scotland, Sweden, Wisconsin, Virginia, and on the island of Nantucket. She currently lives in Salem, Massachusetts with her husband and their identical twin sons.\n\nFYI: The first book of the Gothic Gwyn Mysteries series Trip the Light Phantasmic (so good) is on sale at moment! 99 cents! Both books are available on KU.\n\n​Don't miss!\n\nBuy Links -- Trip the Light Phantasmic\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon UK\n\nAmazon CA\n\nAmazon AU\n\nGoodreads\n\nBookBub\n\nMedieval Monday -- way more fun than the average, run-of-the-mill Monday!\n\nWhile researching medieval diaries, I discovered an extraordinary website.\n\nEpistolae: Medieval Women's Letters\n\nProfessor Joan M. Ferrante, Professor Emeritus of Columbia University, has collected hundreds of letters to and from medieval women, 4th to 13th centuries, and translated them from the original Latin. There are 83 pages of links on the website at present. For each letter, Professor Ferrante provides her English translation, followed by the original Latin text, a brief explanation of the letter, and her source(s). If so inclined, you can search for letters by both sender and receiver.\n\nI stopped at page 15 or so, having found the following letter from the year 1104. It's from Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, to Matilda of Scotland, Queen of the English. He is maaad. He and Queen Matilda's husband, Henry I, had some serious differences of opinion. You will note that at the end of his epistle, he prays for the queen and her children -- not the king!\n\nI realized only after reading the letters and doing a little more research that Matilda of Scotland was Good Queen Maud and that Archbishop Anselm was eventually canonized. They are both fascinating figures.\n\nHere's the letter, copied from the website:\n\nTo his reverend lady, his dearest daughter Matilda, by the grace of God queen of the English: Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, sending his faithful service, his prayers and the blessing of God and his own, if it is worth anything. I give boundless thanks to your Highness by loving and praying for you for the magnitude of your holy love towards my humble self which I perceived in your letter.(1) In it you clearly displayed with what affection you love me when you received and treated my parchment in the way you describe. Your dignity raised my spirits so much by declaring that what nature denies me your grace bestows, that those who are mine by kinship are yours by adoption and love.(2) By trying to soften the heart of my lord the King towards me because of your desire for my return I perceive that you are doing what is fitting for you and advantageous for him. For if he has any bitterness of heart towards me I am not aware of ever having deserved it in any way at all, as far as I can see. If at any time I served him he knows it, and I think he will not consign it to oblivion. If in some respects he dislikes me without cause it would be advantageous for him to drive this rancor away from him lest he sin before God. You promise me that the King will in future grant me better and more abundant access to our revenues, of which at present he allows me a small amount.(3) I should not be ungrateful to your benevolence because you are doing this, as far as you are able through your goodwill. But it should not be necessary to make me such a promise because no confiscation or decrease of them should take place against my will. Whoever advised him to appropriate any of these revenues advised him to commit a sin which is no slight one, nor one that should ever be tolerated. For whoever despoils a bishop of his goods can in no way be reconciled to God unless he restores to him all his goods intact. You should know that however small a part of these goods I am deprived of, it is as if I were deprived of everything. I do not say this for love of money but for the love of God's justice. Your kindness prays me not to take my love away from my lord the King but to intercede for him, for yourself, for your offspring and for your realm. I have always done this up to now. But as to the future I commit myself to the providence of God, with whom \"the son does not bear the iniquity of the father\"(4) nor the wife that of her husband. I hope in God that I may not harbor any rancor against anybody in my heart which could separate me from God. May almighty God guard you and your offspring(5) forever in his grace.(6)\n\n​Epistolae is a wonderful resource. Many thanks to Professor Ferrante, her colleagues, and Columbia University for making it available to the public. If you visit the website, along with the letters, you will find a few short, excellent videos with the professor. She is enthusiastic, generous, and clearly loves what she does.\n\nAmazing.\n\nI'm delighted to welcome one very interesting lady today! Meryl Brown Tobin, multi-published, multi-genre author, launched her beautiful romance Broome Enigma back in November. I was unable to host her then, so I am especially thrilled to be able to share her work with you now. But first, let's get better acquainted with this talented author.\n\nWelcome, Meryl!\n\n1) What sort of books did you enjoy reading as a child? Did you have a favorite book or series?\n\nI was an Enid Blyton girl and read every book of hers I could. I especially loved the Famous Five series.\n\n2) What sort of books do you enjoy reading nowadays?\n\nI read a variety of books including ones about First Nations people and books by them. ‘The Dark Emu’ by Bruce Pascoe and ‘Talking to My Country’ by Stan Grant are two I found illuminating. I also like Australian historical fiction, especially books by Chrissie Michaels.\n\nAs I have a lot of writer friends I try to support, I read whatever they write, which includes poetry, short stories and novels in various genres.\n\n3) Around what age did you realize that you liked to write? And when did you know that you wanted to write books?\n\nIn early primary school, I started to write. When I was about eight, I joined several children’s clubs attached to newspapers and contributed to them. In my mid-twenties, I wrote my first novel. While the theme was noble, the writing was very amateurish. When I was about 50, I was keen to try again but couldn’t get in the mood until I could see a long stretch of time in front of me. Then I was offered a voluntary redundancy package from my day job and saw that as my chance.\n\nBravo!\n\n4) What’s the first thing you wrote that you remember being proud of?\n\nWhen I was 11, I wrote a short item for a short story journal to which my mother subscribed. I described our family’s visit to a nature sanctuary.\n\n5) Tell us about the creative force within you. What inspires you to write, to create?\n\nI write because I have a mind made up of jigsaw pieces of thoughts and memories. Every now and again the pieces fit together and insist I write them into a story, a poem or some other piece of writing – even a cartoon.\n\n6) What’s your writing space like?\n\nWhen I first started writing, my writing space was the end of our kitchen/dining room table. Because it was very frustrating clearing away my typewriter (in those days) and relevant paperwork at mealtimes, I yearned to have my own den. Eventually I got a small one which I soon filled with filing cabinets and magazines and other publications which had published my writings. Once our children left home, I spread into one of their bedrooms. That’s now full of writing paraphernalia including a desk, computer and printer, boxes of magazines containing my published pieces, boxes of travel material, notes and papers I might need for my writing one day.\n\nIt sounds like a great space!\n\n7) Do you have a favorite time of day to write? Any habits or little rituals that put you in a writing mindset?\n\nAfter doing what else I have to do for the day, I write. At night I prefer to watch TV though. I do two mornings of exercises a week and try to do an early morning walk the other days if I am not going out or doing heavy housework. If the weather is bad, I do a half-hour exercise session on TV at 8.30 am. Then the day is clear for my writing apart from regular breaks from the computer.\n\n8) Time to talk about your latest release (rubbing hands together). First, how did you come up with the idea for Broome Enigma? Are there any interesting tidbits you’d care to share with us?\n\nMy family and I love travelling around Australia, and Broome, an Outback cosmopolitan town in Western Australia is one of our favourite places. On one trip we met a handsome young man working in a caravan park. Dressed in only jeans and sandals, he had a tanned torso with muscles showing and looked as though he had just stepped off a film set for a surfing movie. However, he had a damped-down personality that didn’t match his looks. I played the What If? game to try to come up with a reason as to how he came to be working in the caravan park. After some years a story started to formulate and develop.\n\nFascinating! The man that day became one of your characters!\n\n9) Now let’s hear more about Broome Enigma!\n\nBroome Enigma came out on November 20, 2023. It’s on sale on at least 33 websites in at least 16 countries including Australia, Austria(?), Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India(?), Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, The Netherlands, Switzerland, UK and USA.\n\nMany people have now read my book and many comment on the setting, Broome in 1986, and\n\nhow it brings back memories of their visits there or how it has inspired them to want to go and\n\nvisit. For individual readers’ comments, see https://sites.google.com/site/merylbrowntobin -\n\nNOVELS.\n\nAction in the novel also takes place between Broome and Perth. As I am also a travel writer and\n\nwrote ‘Exploring Outback Australia’ for which my husband, Hartley Tobin, did the photographs\n\nand maps, and we have travelled the route a number of times, writing accurately about the areas\n\ncovered was relatively easy.\n\n10) I comprehend that you’ve just recently published a book. Still, I can’t help but ask – do you have anything waiting in the wings?\n\nYes, more novels.\n\nMy publisher, The Wild Rose Press, goes out of its way to help writers. Thanks to Val Mathews, TWRP editor who first encouraged me, and Ally Robertson who helped me ‘get over the hump’, I was able to rewrite ‘Broome Enigma’ in a style favored by them. With the publication of the book and numerous comments from readers, I now know what works with them. Now I shall apply all I have learned and rewrite all my other novels so they ‘get over the hump’.\n\nI agree. I love The Wild Rose Press. It's a wonderful publishing house.\n\n11) Is there anything else you’d like to share with us?\n\nAlthough ‘Broome Enigma’ is my first published novel, I have been writing for most of my life and have published fiction for adults and children, non-fiction, especially travel, poetry and educational puzzles.\n\nI have had 21 other books published, including two poetry books with other poets. My published books also include puzzle/activity books, black-line masters books of educational puzzles, work books for primary students, a travel book, a children’s picture storybook, a poetry collection. In total nearly 300,000 copies of my first four puzzle books were sold in Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\n\nHundreds of my poems and puzzles, scores of my short stories and travel and other articles, and some cartoons have appeared in more than 150 magazines, newspapers and anthologies in Australia and elsewhere, including the US.\n\nFor more details see https://sites.google.com/view/merylbrowntobin-author.\n\nIt's been an honor hosting you, Meryl. Thank you for sharing your time with us. Congratulations on Broome Enigma!\n\nOn a working holiday in Australia's cosmopolitan Outback town of Broome in 1986, Jodie, a young book designer and artist is open to romance and adventure.\n\nAt the holiday village where she is staying, she meets Joe, a young man who works there. Despite the strong attraction between them, the many unknowns about his earlier life keep them apart. To try to uncover his mysterious past, they travel to Perth and back to Broome and are drawn into not only bizarre but also dangerous situations.\n\n​\n\nIs Joe the person she thinks he is, or is he some alter ego? Can Jodie and Joe stop their relationship from developing until they have answers and know if he is free to love her?\n\nExcerpt\n\nA big gust of wind rocked the van and flung Jodie hard against Joe. He pushed her off.\n\n“Joe, it’s me, Jodie! Wake up, wake up!”\n\n“Jodie, is that you?” He threw his arms around her and buried his head in her chest.\n\nShe brushed his hair back from his sweating face.\n\n“Take it easy, Joe. Take deep breaths. It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.”\n\nHe stopped shaking and pulled back from her.\n\n“What’s happening?”\n\n“It’s the cyclone. Don’t you remember?”\n\nAnother huge gust shook the van and sent Jodie sprawling on Joe’s bunk and into the wall.\n\n“Ow, that hurt!” She picked herself up and rubbed her head. The van rocked violently again. Joe and Jodie grabbed for handholds.\n\n“Quick, come into my bed with me, Joe. It will be safer there.” Tripping and feeling their way along the wall, the two made their way to the double bed and clambered in.\n\nHer breathing coming in short spasms, she lay on her back and took deep breaths. The storm whined and screeched about her, and the roof creaked and scraped.\n\n“Oh, my god, the roof’s going to take off any minute!”\n\nJoe’s arms enveloped her. “Hush, everything will be all right. But will you be okay if we have to make a run for it?”\n\n“Yes.” She let out a sob. “But I like our chances better in here than out there.”\n\nJoe kissed her forehead. He pulled her closer and they lay locked against each other while the storm\n\nraged around them.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMeryl Brown Tobin is an Australian writer of short and long fiction for adults and children, non-fiction, especially travel, poetry and educational puzzles.\n\nShe has had 21 books published.

I'm back just in time to celebrate with my dear friend Mary Morgan! Steinar, her latest Viking romance and third book in the Wolves of Clan Sutherland series, launches this week!\n\nGorgeous, delicious... I'll let Mary tell you more! Plus, she has gifted us with a SNEAK PREVIEW!\n\nCongratulations and welcome, Lady Mary!\n\nHello Anastasia! I’m delighted to be on your lovely blog for Medieval Monday! With my new release of Steinar a couple days away, I’d like to talk about an important secondary character in the book—Snorri Sturluson. His fascination with Steinar became apparent the moment they met on the ship. As writers, we know how important these characters are in adding depth, humor, and support to the main protagonists.\n\nLet me share a wee bit of historical information about the real Snorri, the Icelander. While during my Viking and Norse research, I came across an important historical person by the name of Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241). Born in western Iceland, Snorri was the son of an Icelandic chieftain. Snorri ascended to become Iceland’s richest and powerful leader. He has long been assumed to be the author of medieval Iceland’s greatest works, including the Prose Edda, which is one of Scandinavia’s vast source for Norse mythology, and the Heimskringla Saga about the history of Norway’s kings.\n\nI could think of no one better qualified to pen the fictional tale of the Pirate Wolf than Snorri Sturluson.\n\nTo save the wolf, she must renounce her love for the man.\n\n​Descended from the mighty Somerled, Lord of the Isles, Steinar MacDougall’s supremacy over the seas is fierce. On a quest for King William, he is captured by the enemy and presented with a favorable opportunity. Yet Steinar soon realizes his greatest threat comes from the woman who hides behind the mask of a warrior, and the quest for control might send them hurdling into the abyss of the sea.\n\nAs leader of the Serpents, Inga the Ruthless travels beyond the isles bartering for goods with her brothers. After rescuing the feared Pirate Wolf during a storm, she surrenders her trust to the man and his inner wolf in order to claim the lost treasure of Odin. Though the journey is fraught with dangers, Inga fears her heart might be the one in peril, leading her to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nWill the sea be their salvation or doom them to a watery grave?\n\nA Sneak Preview from STEINAR ~\n\nSteinar raised a brow in amused contempt with the beginnings of a smile tipping the corners of his lips.\n\n“I find nae humor in this.” She pointed a warning finger at the man. “Nor should you.”\n\nHe raised the jug near his mouth. “For Inga the Ruthless who has maintained a life around men, I find your response…interesting.” He then took a long draw of mead.\n\nStunned into silence, Inga gaped at him. Then her eyes narrowed to shards of fury. Her fingers sought the brooch fastened at the top of her cloak and undid the clasp. Removing the cloak from her body, she tossed both brooch and cloak onto a nearby stool.\n\n“How wrong you were in your earlier criticism of my skills as a woman. At Rangvald’s table I was simply Inga, daughter of Olaf.” She gestured to her gown. “Can you honestly tell me I look like a woman who is a leader of men on the seas?”\n\nSteinar’s expression stilled. He wiped the back of his hand leisurely across his mouth. “Nae,” he rasped out.\n\nThere she witnessed the invitation in the smoldering depths of his eyes—dark with desire luring her forward.\n\nHer heart hammered against her chest. Inga’s mind ordered her to leave—escape the temptation to feel his arms around her. But her body betrayed and overrode all thought. Slowly, Inga removed the jug from his hand and pressed it against her lips. Tilting it back, she drank deeply of what remained. After tossing aside the jug onto the ground, she smiled fully. “Then I am correct.”\n\nSteinar pushed away from the wall. “You think to claim victory?”\n\nHer breath rose heavily with each rise and fall. When did she become the prey and he the predator?\n\n“Always,” she whispered, determined to grasp any shard of control or sanity.\n\nIn one swift move, Steinar clasped his hands around her waist and turned her around with her back against the wall. His body towered over her, trapping Inga. Escape not an option.\n\nShe gasped. Fight or surrender?\n\nFor the first time, Inga lessened the strings binding her to an oath moons ago.\n\nAn oath to never let a man control her.\n\nAn oath to never let a man touch her.\n\nOaths be damned! She craved to have this man kiss her.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nMary Morgan is an international best-selling author of award-winning historical fantasy and paranormal romance novels. During her research travels with her knight in shining armor to England, Ireland, and Scotland, she left a part of her soul in one of these countries and vows to return.\n\nHer passion for books started at an early age along with an overactive imagination. Inspired by her love for history and ancient Celtic and Norse mythology, Mary's tales are filled with powerful warriors, brave women, magic, and romance.\n\nIf you enjoy history, tortured heroes, and a wee bit of fantasy, then journey back in time within the pages of her books.\n\nI'm thrilled to welcome Author Kim Janine Ligon! She is the sort of person who sends hugs when she thinks you need them (and you do) and has a kind word for everyone. Today, we're celebrating the birthday of her first cozy mystery/romantic suspense, Polly's List, which is a wonderful read, as well as her new book, Landing On Her Feet. Before we get to her latest, I thought it would be fun to learn a bit more about Kim.\n\n1) What sort of books did you enjoy reading as a child? Did you have a favorite book or series?\n\nI loved biographies. I read all the little blue books they had in our library at school. I adored the books from The Five Little Peppers series probably because I had five little sisters for a long time. I always enjoyed historical fiction too.\n\n2) What sort of books do you enjoy reading nowadays?\n\nMy reading has expanded since coming to Wild Rose Press. I've always read classics and quite a bit of contemporary fiction but now I do paranormal and time travel and some sci-fi. I've been introduced to a whole new group of truly talented authors.\n\nI have met so many talented writers and wonderful people through The Wild Rose Press -- including you, Kim! :)\n\n3) Around what age did you realize that you liked to write?\n\nI started writing poetry and short stories at ten or eleven. And when did you know that you wanted to write books? By thirteen I wrote my first novella.\n\n4) What’s the first thing you wrote that you remember being proud of?\n\nI always liked to share my stuff but was most proud when my work garnered A pluses in high school and college creative writing classes.\n\n5) Tell us about the creative force within you. What inspires you to write, to create?\n\nThat's a great question. I think that I had to lean heavily on the detailed organized part of my brain in my career and my creative side had pent up demand for exercise. For years I've been making notes About my observations of behavior, great names, locations made for a story. Now those notes seem to be coming together. And I started other first time creative endeavors when I retired from my first career including getting a Spinning wheel and loom and learning how to use both. I set up my blog five years ago and slowly began to build a following. I've found doing anything creative helps stimulate my creativity in all areas.\n\n​\n\n6) What’s your writing space like?\n\nIt's my writing, Spinning, reading, weaving space. It might seem a little chaotic to the untrained eye but I'm very comfortable and productive there. I've included some pictures for you. One of the writing side and one of the spinning side. I have two plaques. One says, \"The joy of the journey is in the ride.\" The other says, \"Life is too short to be anything but happy.\" I have lots of photographs of family and friends, bookcases, some of my favorite artwork and a view from my spinning wheel of the front yard and our cul de sac.\n\nWhat a wonderfully creative space! I love the sayings, too. Thank you for sharing them with us.\n\n7) Do you have a favorite time of day to write? Any habits or little rituals that put you in a writing mindset?\n\nI'm best in the morning after a couple cups of coffee. I'm out of steam usually by early afternoon. I'm not super disciplined about it. If I'm in mid-story I might have dreamt about something I need to get on paper or I'm Spinning and looking out the window and an idea pops up that has to go on paper or the computer before I lose it. I'm a little streaky. When I'm on a roll, I write every day. When I'm letting a plot marinate,I may not write a word for a whole week.\n\n8) Let's talk about Landing On Her Feet (rubbing hands together)! But first, how did you come up with the idea for the series? Are there any interesting tidbits you’d care to share with us?\n\nLANDING ON HER FEET is my second novel. It is set in the small town of Lansdale, Wisconsin. It's a rated G mystery with a generous splash of faith. My debut novel, POLLY'S LIST, was also set in the same place and there are some characters who will be familiar but both books are standalone and may be read in any order. I actual wrote Landing first but Polly made it to print first. Some of my family and high school classmates have found the similarities between Lansdale and the small town I grew up in, also in rural Wisconsin.\n\n9) I comprehend that you’ve just recently published a book. Still, I can’t help but ask – do you have anything waiting in the wings?\n\nI've submitted my third manuscript and synopsis to TWRP. It's another Lansdale mystery with some familiar faces and some brand new ones. I have some other non-Lansdale based stories outlined and two fairly complete but definitely not ready for prime time yet. I'll be happy if I can continue to publish a new book each year.\n\n10) Is there anything else you’d like to share with us?\n\nI'm excited because today is POLLY'S LIST'S first book birthday. It is still a little surreal to me that it has been a year since my dream of being a published author came true and now she has a little sister in LANDING ON HER FEET. I am forever grateful to The Wild Rose Press for giving me this opportunity. I am especially thankful for my editor, Dianne Rich. She saw potential in my first book and worked tirelessly to coax the best book possible out of me and then did it again. She is a gem! We make a great team!\n\nHappy Birthday to Polly's List! Kim, thank you for allowing us to celebrate with you, and congratulations on your new release! We look forward to reading more of your books in the future! Hugs! Wishing you all the best!\n\nAnd now, Landing On Her Feet!​\n\nKat Russell narrowly escaped death at Dirk Crowe’s hands six years ago. He’s out of prison. To protect her family, she must flee Philadelphia—the only home she’s ever known—with her five-year-old son, Timmy. Is Wisconsin far enough away to escape evil?\n\nChase Merrick, father of Timmy’s new best friend, wants to help. What is Kat hiding? Why does she insist she must face whatever it is alone?\n\nWhen Can Kat stop constantly looking back over her shoulder? Will secrets and shame stop her from accepting Chase’s protection? Or unite them in the face of danger to keep their sons safe?\n\nExcerpt from Landing On Her Feet\n\nThe unmistakable roar of a motorcycle echoed through the diner. Kat stopped where she stood. Her lungs wouldn’t refill. She gripped the counter to steady her trembling legs. Out the front window she saw a red- helmeted rider atop a motorcycle pull out of a space in front of the diner and drive away.\n\n​\n\nImpossible. Not here. He couldn’t know she’s gone. Not yet. Other people with red helmets ride motorcycles. Get a grip, girl! People are staring. Stop scowling. She wiped away the tear that slipped down her cheek, plastered on what she hoped was a pleasant smile, and resumed pouring coffee. She needed to make a good impression. She had to keep this job.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKim Ligon has been writing stories for most of her life—some on paper and some only in her head. She has lots of source material growing up as the oldest child in a large family in a small town in Wisconsin. Her father was a veterinarian so there were not only lots of children around, but all manner of house pets and farm animals too. Her love of reading comes from her mother who was seldom seen sitting down without a book in her hand. After a demanding career in healthcare information technology, she is now getting to do all the creative things she loves which includes writing her stories to share with you. She lives with her chief encourager and personal romantic hero, her husband of almost forever, in Alabama. Please follow her further adventures at www.spinningromance.com\n\n​Amazon Goodreads"
