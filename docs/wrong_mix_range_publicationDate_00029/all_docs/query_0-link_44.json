(Thanks, Rose!)\n\n\"A gorgeous cover promises high fantasy, but what's inside is as much political as mystical. The battles here are not (precisely) between good and evil but rather between laws and lawlessness. Hone your context-ignorer on some C.S. Lewis and then dive in to wallow in the fabulously lyrical prose and meticulous characterization that earned McKillip her World Fantasy Award.\"\n\nBORDERLANDS PRESS BOOT CAMP FOR WRITERS\n\nFor the second year, Borderlands Press will be offering their \"boot camp for writers\" workshop in two categories -- Short fiction (instructors are Elizabeth Massie, David Morrell, F.

An amateur spelunker and scuba enthusiast, he holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine from the University of Missouri. He currently lives and writes in Sacramento, California. His newest novel, MAP OF BONES, is a gripping and explosive novel of an ancient conspiracy to create a terrifying new world order out of the ashes of modern civilization. . . From the jacket: \"The crime is inhumanly cruel with horrific consequences both unthinkable and inevitable. During a service at a cathedral in Cologne, Germany, a band of armed intruders dressed in monks' robes unleash a nightmare of blood and terror, ruthlessly gunning down worshippers and clergy alike. The killers haven't come for the church's gold and valuable artwork, but for a priceless treasure secreted within: the preserved bones of the Three Magi who once came to pay homage to a newborn savior. As they flee the carnage they have wrought, they carry a prize that could reshape the world.\"\n\nBorderlands event policy - all events are free of charge. You are welcome to bring copies of an author's books purchased elsewhere to be autographed (but we do appreciate it if you purchase something while at the event), except for some special events.

Lansdale (Night Shade Books, Hardcover, $25.00) - Finally this often hard to find title is available in a reasonably priced trade edition. This weird western has everything -- zombies, gun slinging preachers, and giant spiders. What's not to love?\n\nTHE BOAR by Joe R. Lansdale (Night Shade Books, Hardcover, $25.00) - Only published once previously in a very small print run, THE BOAR is an outstanding coming of age story set in Texas which revolves around a young man's hunt of the meanest wild boar in the history of the country. Landsdale's sense of setting and tone really shines in this novella. Recommended by Alan.\n\nLETTERS FROM NEW YORK - LOVECRAFT LETTERS VOL. 2 by H.P.

Though unlike his later work (PERDIDO STREET STATION, THE SCAR, and IRON COUNCIL) in it's setting and tone, KING RAT is a well-crafted, dark urban fantasy revolving around the long standing feud between the King of the Rats and the Pied Piper. Not a story for children.\n\nTHE DEVIL DELIVERED by Steven Erikson (PS, Signed Limited Hardcover (400 copies), $45.00 or Limited Trade Paperback (500 copies), $18.00 - \"Mind the Hole. In a world of ozone depletion, toxic deadzones, internicine brew-ups and lifeless oceans, nothing has changed. Or so it seems, but in the break-away Lakota Nation, in the heart of a land blistered beneath an ozone hole the size of the Great Plains of North America, something is happening. Tracked by a growing global audience of online subversives and electronic muckers, a lone anthropologist wanders the deadlands, recording observations that threaten to bring the world's powers to their knees. Past and future; restless ghosts and rogue corporations; rad-shielded cities and unprotected peripheral populations; all now face each other, across a chasm once wide but growing ever narrower. Mother Earth is poisoned beyond any hope of resuscitation. Humanity beyond any hope of redemption -- but one last lesson of life awaits... When Nature starts losing the game, Nature changes the rules. We've turned paradise into Hell, and in Hell, the Devil Delivers...\" - From the publisher's web site.\n\nLITTLE MACHINES by Paul McAuley (PS, Signed Limited Slipcased Hardcover (200 copies), $90.00 or Limited Hardcover (500 copies), $50.00)\n\nHORRIBLE IMAGININGS by Fritz Leiber (Midnight House, Limited Hardcover (500 copies), $45.00)\n\nMOON OF SKULLS: THE WEIRD WORKS OF ROBERT E.

If you haven't read Morgan's first novel, ALTERED CARBON, make sure you start there before reading this newest installment.

LEARY VOL. 4 by David Drake (Baen, Hardcover, $25.00) - Drake does it again by producing a rip roaring space opera in the classic style that still has a touch of the darker edge for which he's rightly known. This is the kind of writing that got me started on SF. Pure entertainment delivered in a concise, almost clipped style that reminds me of Dashiell Hammett's fast moving narration. Fans of everything from Honor Harrington to Horatio Hornblower should give this series a try. Recommended by Alan.\n\nMIDNIGHT LAMP by Gwyneth Jones (Gollancz, Mass Market, $14.78)\n\nTHE BRADBURY CHRONICLES - THE LIFE OF RAY BRADBURY by Sam Weller (William Morrow, Hardcover, $26.95)\n\nTHREE HANDS FOR SCORPIO by Andre Norton (Tor, Hardcover, $23.95)\n\nGUARDIAN OF THE FREEDOM - MERLIN’S DESCENDANTS VOL. 5 by Irene Radford (DAW , Hardcover, $24.95)\n\nIRONCROWN MOON - BOREAL MOON VOL. 2 by Julian May (Ace, Hardcover, $24.95)\n\nLORDS OF GRASS AND THUNDER by Curt Benjamin (DAW , Hardcover, $24.95)\n\nONCE UPON A SUMMER DAY - FAERY VOL. 2 by Dennis L.

Lee Martinez (Tor, Hardcover, $24.95 or Trade Paperback, $12.95) - So, a werewolf and a vampire walk into a diner . . . sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, doesn't it? Though funny, GIL'S ALL FRIGHT DINER isn't bad at all. It's a very amusing romp with a number of laugh-out-loud scenes, many of them involving the main story of two mismatched (think THE ODD COUPLE) supernatural creatures dealing with a seemingly possessed diner.

This is also the night prophecied for the return of Emperor Kellanved, missing these last years. As factions within the Empire battle over the Imperial throne, the Shadow Moon summons a far more ancient and alien presence for an all-out assault upon the island, one that will determine the fate of the Malaz, and the entire world\n\nPOSTSCRIPTS #3 edited by Peter Crowther\n\nAlso in two states - Limited Hardcover (150 copies) $80\n\nNews-stand Paperback $10\n\nPublication Date May, 2005\n\nContents:\n\n• Chaz Brenchley, 'Dragon Kings Play Songs of Love'\n\n• Gene Wolfe, 'Comber'\n\n• Jayme Lyn Blaschke, Interview with Lois M Bujold\n\n• Stephen Volk, 'Curious Green Colours Sleep Furiously'\n\n• David Herter, 'black and green and gold'\n\n• Jack Dann, 'Dreaming With the Angels'\n\n• Richard Bowes, 'Circle Dance'\n\n• Paul Di Filippo & Barry Malzberg, 'Beyond Mao'\n\n• Adam Roberts, 'And Future King'\n\n• Brian A.
