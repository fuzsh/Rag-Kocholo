        "text": "“Johnny Mnemonic” is a short story by Nebula Award-winning author William Gibson that was originally published in 1981 in the science fiction magazine Omni.\n\nPlug in, flip the switch, and let’s get this review started!\n\nThe Story: Running Through The Streets Of Nighttown\n\nJohnny is a special kind of courier, whose head is used to store corporate data (usually stolen) in an “idiot-savant” mode. His job is to run the data from Point A to Point B without getting caught, but he finds himself in trouble with the Yakuza, or Japanese-style Mafia, and ends up befriending a strange young woman by the name of Molly Millions. They partner up on this mad quest to get the latest data out of Johnny’s head and get rid of the deadly cloned ninja assassin sent by the Yakuza to silence Johnny.\n\nThe Cast: A Little Technical With Just The Right Amount Of Crude\n\nJohnny is the narrator, protagonist, and main character of this little tale, which makes sense when you consider that the data locked in his head is the big prize in his race against the Yakuza. Molly Millions–who had a similar but larger role in Gibson’s novel Neuromancer–makes a great appearance here, popping up out of nowhere and proving more sympathetic to Johnny’s cause than she does elsewhere. She also gets a fantastic scene near the end of the story to demonstrate just how deadly a fighter she can be, even when going up against cloned ninja assassins with razor-wire hidden in their thumbs.\n\nThere’s also a dolphin-turned-supergenius who helps Johnny and Molly figure out the code to unlocking the data in Johnny’s head. It’s a surreal addition to the plot, but it makes sense in context: the dolphin is a veteran of a military experiment to give dolphins cybernetic upgrades in naval operations. Oh, and the dolphin is also addicted to narcotics and needs his fix every so often, just in case you thought this character couldn’t get even more bizarre.\n\nThe Tone: Jumping Headfirst Into The Madhouse\n\nGibson goes for more color and oddities in this story than he does in his novel Neuromancer, which has a somewhat similar plot and cast. This is the kind of story where squatters live up in the rafters over a hi-tech-driven city, where dolphins need cybernetics and smack, and where a smiling salaryman might turn out to be an utterly ruthless Yakuza hit man. It’s fast, furious, and fun to watch unfold.\n\nFinal Verdict: A Quick Fix Of Pure Punk\n\nEssentially, “Johnny Mnemonic” is a precursor to the plot and cast of Gibson’s bestselling novel, Neuromancer. It jumps like a frog in a dynamite pond (a line I stole from The Rum Diary, by Hunter S. Thompson) and isn’t afraid to explore the fictional setting of Nighttown and its mad residents. It’s a great way to start off this anthology, and while I haven’t finished the collection yet, I’ve no doubt that “Mnemonic” is going to be one of my all-time favorite stories.\n\n—\n\nBibliography: Gibson, William. “Johnny Mnemonic.” Burning Chrome. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1986.\n\nIn Neuromancer, he gave us a data heist by hackers and mercenaries. In Count Zero, he gave us a new generation of hackers, mercenaries, and art dealers trying to unravel a corporate conspiracy. And in the final book of his “Sprawl trilogy,” William Gibson gives us yet another ragtag band as they resolve the intricate plots of new corporate conspirators and a few AI, some of whom may be the virtual ghosts of actual human beings.\n\nConfused? Don’t worry, it’s just the hip and happening cyberpunk world of Mona Lisa Overdrive.\n\nJust as in Count Zero, where there were three storylines to follow, in Mona Lisa, we get four different storylines, all bound together by select individuals and occurrences and all of which converge by the end. The storylines are based around the following characters and events:\n\nKumiko Yanaka, the young daughter of an oyabun, or Japanese mob boss, who is sent to England for her protection, where she encounters a mercenary named Sally Shears, later revealed to be Molly Millions from the first story.\n\nSlick Henry, an ex-convict living in an abandoned factory in the middle of nowhere who’s given the responsibility of looking after an older Bobby Newmark, now plugged into his own simulacrum of reality.\n\nAngie Mitchell, a former victim-turned-Sense/Net celebrity who suffers from visions from the “loa” and finds herself at the center of a conspiracy by Lady 3Jane, the last descendent of the decrepit Tessier-Ashpool clan.\n\nMona, a sixteen-year-old girl and occasional drug addict who’s just trying to get by, but gets caught up in the same conspiracy as her idol, Angie Mitchell.\n\nThe story jumps fast through these storylines, and one really has to pay close attention to catch everything that’s being said and done. But I found that, despite my initial skepticism, these storylines do link together far more closely than they seemed to in Count Zero. And since this is the last book of a trilogy, the plot threads of previous stories–like Mitchell’s biochip visions and the merger of two AI in Neuromancer–are given some resolution.\n\nI know some readers might call the whole book a mind screw and I don’t mean to spoil things when I say that the end involves some of the cast “ascending” to a new life inside cyberspace, but the whole process is well set-up and comes off beautifully at the end. It is a story of romance and maturity, of intrigue and revenge, of ghosts that never die and scars that never fade. It is raw with blood, tears, and silicon, but it is wonderful all the same.\n\n—\n\nBibliography: Gibson, William. Mona Lisa Overdrive. New York: Bantam Books, 1988.\n\nA handful of rebel hackers and mercenaries fighting sinister corporate oligarchies. It’s a formula that we’ve seen countless times in modern sci-fi, but it was the work of William Gibson that set down the standards in the first place. And nowhere it is more evident than in the second book of his “Sprawl trilogy,” Count Zero.\n\nSet a few years after the events of Neuromancer, the story follows three different plot threads, all of which intersect in a curious way at the end. One thread deals with a corporate mercenary named Turner who’s trying to help the inventor of the “biochip” defect from his company, while trying to determine just what this biochip is and what it means for the future. Then there’s Marly Krushkova, a scandalized art dealer in Paris who’s hired to locate a mysterious art collection at the request of the exceptionally wealthy but dangerous tycoon Josef Virek. And then there’s poor Bobby Newmark, a wannabe console cowboy whose first ride through cyberspace lands him in the middle of a major corporate mess that only a handful of determined voodoo practitioners can get him out of.\n\nI’ve got to admit that I was a little confused when reading this story. I love the way Gibson writes, but I found it a little difficult to juggle three different storylines, even though they all connect by the end. And I do like how he managed to keep his fictional world of “the Sprawl” intact, letting a new series of characters have some adventures instead of just relying on old ones like Case and Molly. I also felt deeply for all three of the main characters just as much as I did for Case in Neuromancer, although it was easier in the case of the latter, as there was only the one protagonist to follow. But if I had to rank or compare the three major storylines, I would say that Turner’s is the most action-packed, Marly’s is the most unusual, and Bobby’s is the easiest with connect with.\n\nRegardless, Count Zero is an excellent sequel to Neuromancer, both in expanding our view of Gibson’s fictional setting and following up on the impact of the events in the previous story. And because of that success, I’m very interested in seeing where he takes us in the last book of the trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive.\n\n—\n\nBibliography: Gibson, William. Count Zero. New York: Ace Books, 1986.\n\nThere was a time when science fiction was an inherently optimistic genre, all about the Wonders of the Future and the problems that’d be solved through advances in technology and the unquenchable spirit of human beings. Then along came a downward shift, as sci-fi became grittier, the future became bleaker and there was a nostalgic grasping for the past.\n\nEnter the new genre of cyberpunk. Its herald? None other than the novel Neuromancer by William Gibson.\n\nNeuromancer is the first story of what would become known as Gibson’s “Sprawl trilogy,” a series of works set in a futuristic society ruled by cyberspace, genetic engineering, and Japanese culture. Our protagonist in the first novel is Case, a “console cowboy” (read: hacker) who’s seen better days. When he encounters a “street samurai” (read: mercenary) named Molly and a mysterious war veteran named Armitage, Case finds himself on a very dangerous job involving an AI that could cost him not only his life but his sanity.\n\nThis is one of those stories that eerily captures a good snapshot of the future. It was Gibson who coined the term “cyberspace” and whose “matrix” predates the real-life World Wide Web. And while Case’s methods of hacking are far more visual than its real-world equivalent, it’s fascinating to read about his efforts to cut through corporate “ice” and wander through a simulacrum of his own reality. So much in those sequences alone are an excellent set-up for future works like The Matrix.\n\nI will admit that there are a few sequences that are a bit mind-screwy, especially once we start getting more involvement from the AI called Wintermute in the second half of the novel. At times, there are so many switches of perspective and setting for Case that the reader can get lost if he’s not careful. But I’ll say that such scenes are still enjoyable, and they do in fact fit in with Gibson’s universe, as technology’s effects change everything we do and perceive.\n\nMr. Gibson deserves a lot of credit for creating his own slang in this story and consistently sticking to it, as it helps immerse the reader into his world. The language itself is dark and sensual, as fast-paced and nervous as our main cast. It is a thrill for the mind, a shock for the senses, and a thoroughly modern adventure.\n\nOne more thing: Neuromancer is the first book of Mr. Gibson’s Sprawl trilogy, but each novel is a separate and unique story, so I will be reviewing the next two installments at a later date.\n\n—\n\nBibliography: Gibson, William.
