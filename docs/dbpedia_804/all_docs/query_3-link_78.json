        "text": "This may be the most unnecessary spoiler alert ever given the fact that Thelma & Louise premiered in 1991 and has perhaps the most famous surprise ending of any film in history, but here goes anyway:\n\nSpoilers follow.\n\nAfter a snap decision by Susan Sarandon‘s Louise early in the film cascades into a full-on crime spree — Thelma (Geena Davis) holds up a convenience store, they blow up a tanker truck, etc. — the whole thing goes off a cliff with agency, control and a lot of gusto. Becky Aikman’s new book Off the Cliff: How the Making of ‘Thelma & Louise’ Drove Hollywood to the Edge, which is just out from Penguin Press, is an entertaining and surprising history of the film’s production.\n\nCan you imagine Jodie Foster and Michelle Pfeiffer? It nearly happened.\n\nDecider recently caught up with the Off the Cliff author by phone from Dallas where she had just recorded an interview for NPR and was getting ready for an book event. We talked about the behind-the-scenes story of Thelma & Louise, the film’s impact, and how the future prospects look for a more representational era in film.\n\nDECIDER: When do you first see Thelma & Louise?\n\nBECKY AIKMAN: I saw it on opening day in 1991.\n\nThe movie moves through a lot of different modes. There’s some Urban Cowboy, some Easy Rider, some 9 to 5. Does the film have particular visual influences?\n\nI don’t think it was all that influenced by other movies. Ridley Scott is from England and was mostly working abroad at that time, and Callie Khouri was a first-time screenwriter. Ridley and the art director and location supervisor drove across the country — Nashville, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma — and built the look of the film out of that trip. They shot the bar scene at an actual country-western bar near Los Angeles with local extras.\n\nThat’s such a strange scene with everyone line dancing.\n\nThe dance was called the Tush Push. [Laughs.] Patsy Swayze — Patrick Swayze’s mother — had a dance studio and was the choreographer. The line dance was basically what the locals were doing at the time, and Ridley Scott had seen them doing it. He set the cameras up and down the line handheld to capture it. They didn’t rehearse it. He wanted it look look sort of ragged like real locals dancing.\n\nRidley Scott directed the film, but he hadn’t originally planned to. What were the discussions around Callie Khouri directing?\n\nRidley loved the script, but he didn’t initially feel comfortable directing it. He thought it was a women’s story and wasn’t sure he got the characters enough to be the director. He looked at a lot of different directors but never seriously consider Callie. His production company made pretty clear they were looking for an experienced director.\n\nRidley Scott comes off in the book as an accidental feminist. He’s a little sheepish about directing Thelma & Louise, and he’s very nonchalant about the fact that he cast a woman in the Apple “1984” commercial and Sigourney Weaver in Alien. How did he think about women’s representation on film?\n\nI think you put it well that he was an accidental feminist. Ridley is a workaholic, he loves his work and he doesn’t think much about the bigger issues. He didn’t consciously think about something like feminism, which made for an interesting clash of perspectives on the film. That can create something exciting, and I think it did here.\n\nJodie Foster and Michelle Pfeiffer were the original actors signed to the project. How did they wind up not in the film?\n\nCallie Khouri had signed with a young agent named Diane Cairns at ICM, and Jodie Foster and Michelle Pfeiffer were both ICM clients. Studios shied away from women’s films and Thelma & Louise had such an unconventional ending that packaging two big stars gave it a better chance of getting made. Diane Cairns went to their agents, and they both signed on right away. There was a long delay while Ridley Scott met with different directors, and Foster and Pfeiffer eventually both moved on when they got other offers.\n\nGeena Davis and Susan Sarandon had both been nominated for Oscars for smaller films before Thelma & Louise. Was there any sense going in the production that it would be a prestige film?\n\nEvery woman in Hollywood wanted one of those two parts. It was so difficult for women to get complex, substantial roles at that time, and everybody wanted them. The studio wanted box office stars — Cher, Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn — but Ridley Scott was never crazy about having big-name stars. He wanted people to see the roles and not the actors, and he went after actors who he felt could embody those characters. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon were admired, but they weren’t big box-office stars.\n\nThe movie was made in the early 1990s, but it feels more like a ’70s movie in a lot of ways — indie, outdoors, earth tones. Was there some intentionality on the part of the filmmakers that this would not feel like other films that were coming out at the time?\n\nRidley Scott and Callie Khouri came from a completely different sensibility than a glossier film like Pretty Woman. This was Callie Khouri’s first screenplay, and she wrote the kind of movie she wasn’t to see rather than what she thought could get made. She wanted to make a movie that was entertaining, that had action and humor — not some weepy melodrama. And Ridley Scott is incapable of making a sentimental movie; he gave Thelma & Louise a rough edge.\n\nTV was considered the second tier at the time, but that’s not where the heat is now. Callie Khouri has Nashville, and Susan Sarandon has an Emmy nomination for Feud: Betty and Joan and will be on the next season of Ray Donovan.\n\nMovies were more prestigious and had more cultural clout relative to TV at that time. TV was more packaged and conventional, and now it’s movies that are more packaged and conventional. The innovation has certainly shifted toward TV.\n\nDid most people who saw the movie in theaters know how it was going to end? Was that part of the marketing?\n\nThe ending was a total shock to people who saw Thelma & Louise in theaters. For one thing, the studio didn’t have much money to market the film. When I saw the film, I didn’t know anything about it. I saw a rave review in the newspaper that day, but I hadn’t heard anything else about it. The movie blew my mind because it was so completely different than anything else out there, and it wasn’t just about the ending. The women were the main characters, but it wasn’t sentimental or slick, and the characters’ concerns grew out of real-life concerns.\n\nI’m not sure you could do that ending today. There are twists in movies, but “they drive off a cliff at the end” is easy to spoil and would definitely color the experience of seeing the movie for the first time.\n\nI think it would be hard, but people still go nuts about the ending. We’ve shown the film at some events for the book, and it’s still shocking. It’s a powerful and moving finish even when you know it’s coming. It’s one of the all-time great cathartic moments in a movie.\n\nDid Thelma & Louise help create more space for those kinds of movies in the years immediately after?\n\nIt doesn’t seem to have. There certainly weren’t more realistic, tough movies about women.\n\nI don’t read the ending as punishing two anti-heroes, but I could certainly see some people viewing it that way. Do you hear that sentiment?\n\nOh, of course. A lot of people think it sends a terrible message for women that the only way you can win is to lose. Callie Khouri and Ridley Scott never intended the ending to be taken all that literally. They both saw it as a metaphorical choice for freedom, and Ridley doesn’t show them in a pile at the bottom of the cliff. There’s a majesty and grandeur to the scene that, as Ridley put it, has them entering the realm of myth.\n\nThe movie is a dark comedy, or at least parts of it are, and you say in the book that Ridley Scott considered it a comedy.\n\nHe definitely did. He found it funny from the first time he read the script.\n\nHow much do you think Wonder Woman changes the stakes for women as writers and directors?\n\nI’m trying to be realistic about it. Wonder Woman has made a lot of money, and money talks in the industry. I’m hesitant to say “problem solved” because we’ve been through this before. There have been successful movies with female protagonists or writers or directors that didn’t change things all that much. The percentages of movies about women, written by women and directed by women today are about the same as in the Thelma & Louise era.\n\nOne thing you say in the book that makes me optimistic about that is: “Wherever diversity in the workplace is an issue, as it certainly was and is in the movie industry, it’s essential that some white guy stick his neck out to start to set things right.” There are more progressive, well-intentioned white guys in positions of authority in Hollywood than any previous time in history.\n\nThere are certainly some. Judd Apatow is a great example. I hope so. I hate to call women — more than half the population — a niche audience, but I just feel like the movie industry has to recognize that there are people out there interested in seeing films where their lives are represented in some way. You don’t have to hit the broadest possible audience with every film.\n\nIn a more fractured film and TV world, there will be more opportunities for that.\n\nI hope you’re right. TV has certainly benefited from that attitude, and maybe films will too. The downside is that the international box office has become very important, and there’s a mindset in Hollywood that the only movies that will succeed in the international market are guy-oriented action movies. I’m hoping Wonder Woman and Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel will help change that attitude.\n\nScott Porch writes about the streaming-media industry for Decider and is also a contributing writer for Playboy.
