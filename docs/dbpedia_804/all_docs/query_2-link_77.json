Mr. Jackson is present with the students throughout the entire program. This 4-month program focuses on the timeless art of filmmaking. Close attention is given to filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky, Terrence Malick, and Mel Gibson: true “poets of cinema.” A minimum of five guest lectures are included to introduce the students to experts in their field. The Theoria program is unique in its approach, focus, and content. We focus on empowering the artistic and spiritual nature of the student by studying the timeless art of filmmaking.​\n\nSchedule\n\nEarly Bird Application: January 15th, 2024 (priority acceptance rate)\n\nThe next cohort starts May 21, 2024.\n\nThe optional residency will take place in September 2024.\n\nStudents meet two nights a week online for the whole four months. For homework, two to three films a week will be assigned plus a written reflection.\n\n​Previous Guest Speakers\n\nClare Bowen\n\nBethany Joy Lenz\n\nScott Teems\n\nRichard Lee Jackson\n\nSteve Burton\n\nAnthony Geary\n\nTimothy Patitsas, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor Tobias Pontara, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor Roger Stritmatter, Ph.D.\n\nRichard Ramsey\n\nPeter Strayer\n\nMichael Grant\n\nStephanie-Katherine Grant\n\nAnna Cumacheva\n\nLisa Vultaggio Jackson\n\n​Location\n\nThe entire program is online. For 2024, we are not offering an in-person program. The optional residency will take place in the Nashville area.\n\nCourses\n\nMr. Jackson teaches all courses. Each course includes at least one guest instructor.\n\n​“Approaching the Mystery of Art”\n\n“Acting in the Spirit”\n\n“Parables of Light, Part One: The Art of Screenwriting”\n\n“Parables of Light, Part Two: The Art of Directing and Filmmaking”\n\n“The Mystery of Music in Film”\n\n​“Approaching the Mystery of Art” is a course on the spiritual vision of the Artist. This course is not focused on details of craft, but rather the orientation of the soul towards Beauty, Goodness and Truth. Once the student’s heart and mind are opened to the Mystery of Art, they can assimilate knowledge-of-craft, without diminishing Beauty or succumbing to vainglory.\n\n“Acting in the Spirit” focuses on the art of acting as a spiritual vocation. In this course, students will learn all the basic skills an actor needs to pursue his or her career in this field. Students will learn through lectures, scene studies, watching great performances on film—as well as shared personal stories and experiences from Emmy Award winner, Jonathan Jackson.\n\n​“The Art of Screenwriting” surveys the writing of a life-changing screenplay. Before light is captured and a film is made—the dream is written on paper. In this course, students will study some of the most influential screenplays and also walk through the process of creating their own parable of Light and Dark.\n\n​“The Art of Filmmaking” is a series on the craft and poetry of film. This course focuses on the art of directing—the spiritual vision of filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky, Mel Gibson and Terrence Malick. Students will be immersed in the power of film as an artistic medium capable of transforming the lives of those who witness true works of art. This course will take future filmmakers from the page of a screenplay to the screen—where they will experience the vast landscape of what it takes to make a life-changing film.\n\n​“The Mystery of Music in Film” evaluates the role of music in film. Students will study some of the best original scores and learn how these compositions enhance the visual journey of a film. “The Mystery of Music in Film” explores themes of Silence, Anticipation and Transcendence.\n\n​\n\nFinances\n\nThe total cost of the program for a traditional student is $4,900. There are 18 spots available.\n\nWe also offer an “audit” option for $1,500. Auditing allows access to the live sessions and recordings but does not include live interaction with Jonathan and the students. Asynchronous Q&A takes place outside of class time through messaging and email.\n\nThe optional residency, with only seven spots available, is $2,000. These seven spots are only available to students. The seven spots are not available to auditors.\n\n​Tuition Payment Schedule\n\nOnce accepted, a $1,000 non-refundable deposit is required within ten days.\n\nThe remaining balance of is due by April 21st. If accepted on or after April 21st, the remaining payment is due within five days.\n\nHousing\n\nHousing (double occupancy) and food is provided during the optional residency. Single occupancy, if available, will require a surcharge.\n\n​\n\nFAQ\n\nABOUT\n\nDoes The World Need Another Film Program?\n\nThe answer to this question is “no” and “yes”. The world does not need another generic film program. There are many available throughout the world. However, there are no film programs (that I am aware of) with the central vision and purpose being the artistic and spiritual empowerment of its students; and certainly, none with an Orthodox, Patristic Vision of Art and Man’s relationship with Beauty.\n\nThe vision of Theoria Institute of Filmmaking is to equip, inspire, and prepare a generation of actors, writers and directors to create profound works of art for the life of the world. The great Russian novelist Dostoevsky said, “Beauty Will Save the World”. What is this beauty? Is it not the Mercy of the Great Physician? The Suffering of the Most Excellent Artist? The Mysteries of the Eternal Poet? The Revelations of the Master of Story? In the Mystery of the Holy Trinity, the artist discovers the Story of the Divine-Martyr, the Hero of Heroes, the Suffering-Victory of the Logos. Walking the same path of self-emptying love for the world, the artist begins to experience synergy with the Holy Spirit and create genuine works of art.\n\nWe are not preparing our students to preach, but to reveal; not to be polemical filmmakers—but poets of cinema. Theoria Institute is a place where craft and spirit meet and work hand in hand. Our dream is to equip young filmmakers with the vision, courage, faith and skill to make works of art in the tradition of Andrei Tarkovsky, Terrence Malick, Mel Gibson and Christopher Nolan.\n\nIt has been said that “Theology cannot be taught—it can only be caught”. The same is true with art. Ultimately, it has to be “caught” and experienced personally, as a revelation. Therefore, Theoria’s primary goal is to create an atmosphere where this mystery can be glimpsed, caught and personalized in the lives of each student.\n\nSaint Porphyrios says, “For a person to become a Christian, he must have a poetic soul. He must become a poet.” The world cannot see Christ through ideology or intellectualism—but it can experience Him through poetry, parable and revelation. More than ever, the world needs Artists who possess an authentic vision and experience of Beauty. Is it not the same in our times, as it was in Christ’s? The world needs the Grace of Parables.\n\nTheoria Institute of Filmmaking is committed to the timeless vision of Beauty, Goodness, and Truth.\n\n​~ Jonathan Jackson​\n\n​\n\n​History"
