The movie she could watch a million times is Elia Kazan'sA Face in the Crowd .\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn when she first saw A Face in the Crowd\n\n\"I first saw this movie, I guess I was in my early 20s. I'd never heard of it and somebody told me about it, and I watched it and was just completely jaw-droppingly shocked at how current it was.\"\n\nOn why she could watch the movie over and over again\n\n\"The thing that I love about the movie is that it shows that absolute power will always undo itself. And there's something about the feeling of goodness triumphing, and I think that's a really powerful, beautiful message. It gives me hope.\"\n\nCopyright 2020 NPR.
