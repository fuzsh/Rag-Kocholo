        "text": "Some serious drama will go down (of course) during the season finale of CMT's \"Nashville\" — but Thursday's episode will also have a lighter musical moment, courtesy of Kacey Musgraves.\n\nThe country star will appear on the final episode of season 5, and while the show hasn't shared any details on her role, it looks like she'll be palling around in the studio with Maddie and Daphne Conrad (played by Lennon and Maisy Stella).\n\nHow'd Musgraves make the connection with \"Nashville?\" Well, fans of both got to watch it all unfold on Twitter.\n\nIn April, Musgraves tweeted that she was now \"obsessed\" with the show, five years after it first came to TV. Soon, \"Nashville's\" creator/executive producer Callie Khouri responded, inviting her to be on the show. \"We'd LOVE to have you,\" she wrote.\n\nMusgraves' late discovery of \"Nashville\" is particularly amusing, considering she was one of the show's first contributing songwriters. The show's second episode featured the original song \"Undermine,\" co-written by Musgraves and Trent Dabbs.\n\nFor the first time, \"Nashville\" is ending a season with the confidence that the story will continue. In April, CMT announced it had renewed the show for a sixth season comprised of 16 episodes.\n\nMore: 'Nashville' renewed as CMT calls show 'biggest hit'\n\nSeason 6 is set to premiere in \"early\" 2018. This will be “Nashville’s” second season with CMT, which picked up the series last year after its former network, ABC, dropped it from its prime time lineup."
