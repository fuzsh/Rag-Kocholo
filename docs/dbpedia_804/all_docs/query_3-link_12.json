        "text": "NASHVILLE\n\nTHE Bluebird Cafe doesn’t look like much in the daylight, especially if you’re just driving by. It’s a storefront in a nondescript strip mall, wedged between Helen’s Children’s Shop and the Patio Hair Salon. You might, if you’re looking for it, notice the blue canvas awning. Little else would catch your eye.\n\nBut at night it glows from within, white lights twinkling through the window, a neon bluebird above the tiny stage, which is crowded with singers and musicians, some of them famous, most of them not, playing to a tightly packed 100-seat house. No one in the audience checks smartphones when music is being played. No one dares interrupt the songs.\n\nIt’s a place that matters to Callie Khouri, the Academy Award-winning writer of “Thelma & Louise” who lived in Nashville from 1978 to 1982 and who is making her first foray into network series television as creator and writer of the new ABC drama “Nashville.” She says this little room, where music is sacred and the people who play it are revered, contains the essence of what makes Nashville unique, as much if not more than the suburban Grand Ole Opry Entertainment Complex or the venerable downtown Ryman Auditorium, the longtime former home of the Opry. That all three places use church pews for seats is hardly a coincidence.\n\n“Whenever I’ve seen shows or films set here, they just don’t feel like the real Nashville to me,” Ms. Khouri said, echoing a common local complaint that the city’s metro area, with more than 1.6 million residents and a booming diverse economy (ranked by Forbes as one of the fastest-growing job markets in the country) is too often portrayed as a hillbilly Hollywood, populated by charlatans and rubes, slick talent managers and whiskey-guzzling fools."
