        "text": "You probably knew that the girls who play Daphne and Maddie Conrad are sisters in real life, too, but Canadian actresses Maisy and Lennon Stella were already pretty well-known before Nashville hit the air—their cover of Robyn's \"Call Your Girlfriend\" went viral in 2012, leading to their first appearance on Good Morning America. The video now has almost 28 million views, and their YouTube channel, as a whole, currently has over 85 million views.\n\nNo voice doubles (or Auto-Tune) here—those are the actors' real singing voices you're hearing on the show, and they're all really playing guitar, too. In fact, Connie Britton, who plays Rayna James, once told Jimmy Kimmel that she feels guilty about her country music success, saying \"I walk around Nashville just apologizing to all the amazing country singers. I'm like, 'I'm sorry, guys! Want a place on my album? You can have it! I'm really sorry.'\" (The original songs on the show are all written by Nashville-based singer-songwriters.)\n\nAs for Hayden Panettiere, who stars as Juliette Barnes, the actress flirted with a pop music career in 2008, when she released her first single, \"Wake Up Call.\"\n\nIf you're a fan of Whose Line Is It Anyway? you might know Charles Esten by his nickname, Chip. He was a regular on the improv show from 1999 to 2005, where he was obviously pretty great at the musical games. He also appeared as Jim Halpert's Stamford branch boss, Josh Portner (a.k.a. the poor man's Michael Scott), on NBC's The Office.\n\nOkay, maybe you knew this one if you're from Tennessee, but for the show's faux record labels, showrunners took inspiration from the city of Nashville. Interstate 65 cuts right through the heart of Nashville, hence Rayna's Highway 65 label, and Edgehill is a neighborhood and street in the city near Music Row, inspiring the name of Edgehill Records."
