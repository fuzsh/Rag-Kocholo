        "text": "Season Five of Nashville premiered on CMT on January 5, 2017 after it was cancelled by ABC on May 12, 2016. As a gift to fans who campaigned to bring it back, it was announced that the first half of the 2-hour season premiere would air on December 15, 2016. This is the last season to feature Connie Britton as a main cast member and she appears in the first half of the season.\n\nPicking up three weeks after the events of the Season Four finale, the season focuses on the aftermath of the plane crash which left Juliette Barnes as the sole survivor. The crash leaves her confined to a wheelchair and she meets the woman who saved her life. Elsewhere, Maddie tries to re-adjust to life at home with her parents and Daphne.\n\nScarlett and Gunnar split up following the former becoming attracted to video director Damien George. She later falls pregnant with the latter's baby but loses it following a miscarriage. Will also splits from Kevin after refusing to live with him.\n\nRayna faces more financial problems with Highway 65 and also finds herself the victim of a stalker while The Exes try to get their career off the ground once more. Rayna also ends up in a car crash and succumbs to her injuries.\n\nThe second half of the season picks up 10 weeks following her death with Daphne finding it hard to cope with the loss of her mother and beginning a friendship with a homeless girl named Liv. Deacon has to deal with the responsibility of being a single father to both Daphne and Maddie, who is seeing her own music career take off. Meanwhile, Will starts a relationship with entrepreneur Zach Welles, who is determined to make Highway 65 a success even if it means making big changes.\n\nCast[]\n\nMain Cast[]\n\nConnie Britton as Rayna Jaymes (11/22)\n\nHayden Panettiere as Juliette Barnes (21/22)\n\nClare Bowen as Scarlett O'Connor (21/22)\n\nCharles Esten as Deacon Claybourne (22/22)\n\nJonathan Jackson as Avery Barkley (19/22)\n\nSam Palladio as Gunnar Scott (21/22)\n\nChris Carmack as Will Lexington (15/22)\n\nLennon Stella as Maddie Conrad (20/22)\n\nMaisy Stella as Daphne Conrad (20/22)\n\nCameron Scoggins as Zach Welles (17/22)\n\nKaitlin Doubleday as Jessie Caine (7/22)\n\nCo-Stars[]\n\nDavid Alford as Bucky Dawes (13/22)\n\nEd Amatrudo as Glenn Goodman (7/22)\n\nKourtney Hansen as Emily (8/22)\n\nRecurring Cast[]\n\nRhiannon Giddens as Hallie Jordan (8/22)\n\nKyle Dean Massey as Kevin Bicks (2/22)\n\nJen Richards as Allyson Del Lago (3/22)\n\nJordan Woods-Robinson as Randall St. Claire (5/22)\n\nJoseph David-Jones as Clayton Carter (10/22)\n\nJoanie Stewart as Sheila Goldfarb (2/22)\n\nChristian Coulson as Damien George (6/22)\n\nLinds Edwards as Carl Hockney (4/22)\n\nOdessa Adlon as Liv (4/22)\n\nRachel Bilson as Alyssa Greene (4/22)\n\nJeffrey Nordling as Brad Maitland (3/22)\n\nMurray Bartlett as Jakob Fine (2/22)\n\nKatrina Norman as Polly (2/22)\n\nGuest Stars[]\n\nWill Chase as Luke Wheeler (1/22)\n\nJudith Hoag as Tandy Hampton (1/22)\n\nEric Close as Teddy Conrad (1/22)\n\nJ.D.
