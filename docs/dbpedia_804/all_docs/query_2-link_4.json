        "text": "When Academy Award Winner Callie Khouri created the TV musical drama Nashville, her goal was to portray Music City “in a way that everybody who lives here would find completely realistic,” she told the New York Times.\n\nThree years and 70 episodes after the show’s primetime debut on ABC, Khouri’s series - complete with an ever-expanding universe of fictitious stars, entertainment executives and feuds - has made an indelible mark on the city, to be sure. But, how realistic is the weekly series?\n\nMost entertainment executives I spoke with agree it rings pretty true from a business perspective - at least a majority of the time. Nashville does an impressive job of weaving in real artists, events, ABC news programs and venues to help lend to the show’s authenticity. A handful of the celebrities who’ve made guest appearances as themselves on the hit show include Steven Tyler, Florida Georgia Line, Carrie Underwood, Katie Couric and Brad Paisley, among literally dozens more. A multiple-episode story arc in 2014 integrated Nashville with CMA Awards property: a dramatized version of the CMA Awards appeared in the series (shot on the actual awards set, of course), and Nashville stars served as presenters during the primetime awards.\n\nNashville’s cast members have also infiltrated the real-life country music scene, with everything from hit records and radio singles to concert tours and sold-out shows at the Grand Ole Opry. They can be seen promoting the city on billboards and in promotional videos, and even on the cover of Tennessee’s official state tourism guide.\n\n“The Nashville show has had a tremendous impact for this city on many levels,” says Butch Spyridon, President and CEO of the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. “It has been huge as a marketing asset, it has put an important spotlight on our songwriter community and the cast members have been incredible advocates for us as well.\"\n\nA tourism study last year found nearly 1 in 5 Nashville visitors who were viewers of the show cited the show as a motivating factor in their decision to vacation in Music City. Viewers also reportedly stayed longer and spent 23% more money while in town. With several Nashville-themed tours and activity guides - including a four-day, three-night tour package dreamed up by ABC’s parent company Disney - it’s not difficult for TV fans to immerse themselves in the world of Rayna Jaymes, Deacon Claybourne and Juliette Barnes.\n\nReal-life businesses are certainly feeling the impact. Erika Woolam Nichols, COO/GM of The Bluebird Cafe (a frequent backdrop for Nashville scenes), says \"We have had a lot more interest in the venue from the general public; not just music fans as in the past but a greater cross-section of the population. Now our shows sell out in minutes rather than a few days.\" She also notes the venue \"now gets lots of people who just want to have their picture taken in front of the club.\"\n\nA recent syndication deal with AXS TV will help keep Nashville top of mind for domestic TV viewers, and international interest is at an all-time high, too. Nashville is “carrying the Music City message around the world, airing in over 85 countries,” Spyridon says. According to an October 2015 TripAdvisor report, Nashville is the fastest-growing American city searched by International TripAdvisor users, with queries up 38% annually. The report is great news for the city which, together with the state of Tennessee and private donors, has secured millions in funding, incentives, and tax breaks to keep the production filming in Nashville. Four seasons into the show's existence, it has reportedly received more than $45 million in production incentives.\n\nBeyond the tourism impact, the show is directly responsible for millions of dollars in revenue for those in and around the music industry. Nashville has released almost 200 original songs from the show (totaling hundreds of thousands of cumulative track downloads and physical album sales), most of which were written by songwriters in Music City. It has spurred popular coast-to-coast concert tours and helped Nashville actors and actresses break into the music industry. (Stay tuned for reviews of actors' upcoming real-life releases in coming months.)\n\nGetting back to Khouri's original goal: is the drama realistic? Forgiving the fact that it's set in a hyper-heightened reality where everyone eventually becomes a love interest of everyone else or dies a tragic, sudden death - the answer is yes, for the most part.\n\nIn a new weekly column, I'll recap each new episode and offer an insider's perspective on the business aspects of each show. I'll mix in interviews with actors, songwriters and industry executives - and perhaps occasionally even some anonymous gossip. After all, what fun would a Nashville column be without a little drama?\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE:\n\nWhy did Forbes deem me qualified to offer analysis? In addition to being a superfan of the show, I've spent the past 15 years working in the music industry, including tenures in country radio, at record companies of various sizes and at an entertainment advertising agency. Five years ago I founded ZinePak, an entertainment company that has helped dozens of artists - including country superstars Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert, Kenny Chesney, George Strait and Florida Georgia Line - sell millions of records.\n\nDo you have burning questions about Nashville?
