        "text": "By: Lynette Carrington\n\nIt can be said that in the entertainment industry there really is no such thing as an overnight success. But, Actor Derek Krantz hit it fairly close. Every actor starts somewhere and some are talented enough and persevere in one of the most cut-throat industries on the planet. With a winsome attitude, blazing blue eyes and a commanding, yet approachable presence, Krantz has become a fixture on “Nashville,” which is consistently a top 10 ratings winner for ABC.\n\n“Nashville” airs Wednesdays on ABC.\n\nUnlike so many actors, Krantz hasn’t had to pay dues in Hollywood for 20 years before finding his success. The 20-something actor has studied his craft and been following his love of acting through the rigors of school, acting training and the normal processes that one has to go through in the industry. Along the way, he has learned the business as an intimate insider and counts himself lucky to be a part of the talented and dynamic ensemble cast of “Nashville,” which stars Connie Britton, Hayden Panettiere, Clare Bowen and a steady stream of hi-profile guest stars.\n\nBut, to get a sense of where Krantz’s career has taken him, it’s fun to take a peek and see where he’s been. “The earliest thing that I remember is a musical when I was in first grade. I was in a choir and we did a live-action history of America where I played Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark. We had this big musical number about Lewis and Clark and I remember doing that thinking it was the most fun thing ever,” Krantz explains. “Now I have a musical theatre degree from the University of Michigan and I’m a good singer. But as a kid, I wasn’t a good singer. I got cast because I was loud enough to be heard by the audience. Here I was this loud, extroverted kid. I was just interested in telling a story.” It may have also helped that Krantz’s dad was a “maniac” with the video camera… From a very young age, the fledgling actor knew that when that video camera was on, he should be telling a story.\n\nActor, Derek Krantz.

There are things we were taught in school about how to get the job. But then after you get the job, there’s only one way to learn how all that works and that is to do it,” Krantz states. “It’s nice to do soap operas because there’s going to be someone there to hold your hand through the process.” Production assistants and first assistant directors were valuable in helping to show Krantz the ropes.\n\nGoing through the job process includes agents that negotiate a quote for the acting work, getting and memorizing the script, then script revisions, costume fittings, call time, rehearsals and navigating a call sheet, among other things. All these are basic tasks any working actor learns. “Then you start to learn there are all these liaisons and point people that tell you, ‘This is your dressing room,’ and then their job is over,” laughs Krantz. “You learn very quickly who the people are you can rely on and who you need to ask these questions to. Obviously, you don’t walk up to a director and say, ‘Hey, what’s my call time?’”\n\n“Soaps move very quickly and don’t offer much room for mistakes. Soap operas are what they are because they shoot that way,” notes Krantz. The soap opera acting process pretty much provides for one rehearsal take and then the real take before moving on to the next scene. “Then it’s out there in the film and t.v. universe for all time.” A soap opera might film seven or eight episodes in a week, versus a show like “Nashville” that films one episode in seven or eight days.\n\n“Nashville” still with (L-R) Chris Carmack, Derek Krantz and Director, Mario Van Peebles.

Of note, Krantz has a manager and agent in L.A. and an agent in North Carolina. “I feel like this is a secret that not very many actors know. If there’s a way that you can work in a region as a local hire, you should have a representative or agent in that area, because they are looking to cast ‘local hires’ that L.A. and New York won’t get breakdowns for,” Krantz explains. Right now, the southeast gets many roles for shows such as “Sleepy Hollow,” “Vampire Diaries,” “Drop Dead Diva,” “The Originals,” “Necessary Roughness,” and more. Many roles on these shows are only available regionally.\n\nHe called an agency based in the southeast, sent in headshot and demo reel and received a phone call the next day that they wanted to work with him. He got two auditions which he was able to film himself in his house. “My third audition was for a recurring role on ‘Nashville,’” Krantz states. The audition pool narrowed and Krantz was chosen for the prime role by the creative team and “Nashville”’s creator, Callie Khouri. From there, he still had to get additional approvals from ABC and the studio. After appearing at the end of season one, Krantz was a natural fit for the role of Brent McKinney and is now a regular cast member of the hit show.\n\nSo, although he booked the role through an opportunity in the southeast, as the role grew, Krantz’s L.A. representation got involved with his further contract negotiations. “I don’t think a role has been cast locally this way and continued to grow in this same manner. It’s kind of new territory,” says Krantz.\n\nGetting to Know the Character of Brent McKinney\n\nKrantz’s character of Brent McKinney is tied to Oliver Hudson’s character, Jeff Fordham. “Jeff and Brent come from LA. We were running a film studio and we’ve been approached to run the record label,” Krantz explains. As Fordham’s right-hand man, McKinney is a publicity and marketing guru bringing a lot of new talent to the fictional record label on “Nashville.” “The twist of my character is that I have a personal relationship with one of the main characters who is a man. So my character is gay and is the only openly gay character on the show,” the actor explains. Making things more interesting is the fact that as McKinney, he has to bolster singer Will Lexington’s macho image as a “ladies man,” while at the same time, harboring a romantic back-and-forth with the singer. The dichotomy between McKinney’s job and his personal feelings for Lexington make for some interesting personal battles.\n\nThe role of McKinney also brings to light the real world pressures and expectations that are placed on high-profile individuals who are forced or coerced into projecting a certain image that is perhaps not true to who they actually are. Think about how scandalous it would have been if back in Rock Hudson’s heyday he had openly come out as a gay man. It would have completely derailed his career. Although the climate for open sexuality has changed for the better, many big stars remain closeted to protect their careers and earnings. Although Krantz is not gay, he does get a chance to bring light to this very unique issue that has very much been a part of entertainment landscape for decades.\n\nOn the “Nashville” Set\n\nPrior to landing the role of Brent McKinney on “Nashville,” Krantz was doing a lot of indie film and film work. What he likes about the role of McKinney is that he can inject a lot of his own flavor and mannerisms into the role. “It is your job to serve the script and it has its own challenges, but it’s liberating at the same time,” Krantz states. “This production is significantly bigger than anything I’ve ever worked on.” Often there are 50-100 crew members on set for any given take.\n\n“Everyone working on ‘Nashville’ is so good at their job…so professional,” he says. He appreciates that the cast and crew is so prepared and it all runs like a well-oiled machine since Krantz himself shows up for work ready for business each day. “For being on this show as long as I have been, it’s nice to feel like I have authorship over the role. I get a lot of say in what goes on.”\n\nThe Cast Of ABC’s “Nashville” tweets live while aboard a custom tour bus on October 23, 2013 in Nashville, Tennessee. Top Row: Tessa Carr, Steve Buchanan and Geoffrey Colo. Second Row: Patty Puskar, Judith Hoag, Christina Chang, Meredith Lavendar and Aubrey Peeples. Bottom Row: Charles Esten, Chris Carmack, Hayden Panettiere, Derek Krantz, Eric Close and Keri Close.\n\nBriefly leaving his “Nashville” family, Krantz also recently guest-starred on the show, “Two Broke Girls.” “Part of the reason I’m drawn to this industry is because of how quickly you make ‘family,’” Krantz notes. “You step on set and everyone sort has to be ok with each other, or it doesn’t work.” He particularly liked being able to be a part of the “Two Broke Girls” family for a moment.\n\nAlthough the character of McKinney is an important part of the bigger “Nashville” story, Krantz knows that eventually every role will end. He sees himself continuing in television and film. “On any given show, unless you’re shooting a soap opera, you have a hiatus. There are six months or so where you’re not working and everybody tries to go off and do films or do another t.v. show at that point if they’re not contract,” Krantz states. “I think a lot of t.v. networks like AMC, FX and Showtime are shooting what I feel are like long-form films; network t.v., not so much. At this point, I’m happy to do work and I would love to have a big role on episodic t.v. and also be shooting film on my downtime.”\n\nSinger/Songwriter Mandy Allen and Derek Krantz at the 2013 Country Music Awards"
