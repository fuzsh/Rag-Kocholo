        "text": "Now that popular television series Nashville has a new home, fans want to know what Season 5 will bring. Nashville creator Callie Khouri spoke on Saturday (June 25) at the Tennessee Screenwriting Association Seminar, and while she didn't give away any spoilers, she did reveal that she has hired a new writing staff.\n\n“They are very interested in telling the same kinds of stories that I am, which is more emotional but less soapy,” she says (quote via CMT). “You still have to have things that hook you emotionally. People have to feel involved.”\n\nSeason 4 of the show ended with a cliffhanger, but Khouri didn't address that specifically. She did, however, reveal that Season 5 will bring some major issues within the music industry to light.\n\n“One thing I would like to deal with is the collapse of the music business and just how hard it is,” she shares. “This stuff is really hard. You can’t just put out a record and suddenly it’s No. 1 and all of a sudden they’re big stars. That’s not how it happens. So, I think we are going to deal more with the struggle of it. I think that’s a truer representation of what’s really going on. And I think the public should be aware of the fact that what’s common practice out in the universe paying for Spotify or Pandora is bankrupting the music industry.”\n\nWhile Nashville fans often wonder if certain plot lines are about specific real-life country artists, Khouri also put that rumor to rest.\n\n“I love it when somebody tells me something juicy about something that’s really happened,” she adds. “But the writers are all in L.A. They’re not in touch with what really goes on. But anybody who wants to tell me something, please don’t hold back.\"\n\nIt was recently revealed that Will Chase and Aubrey Peeples will not return for Season 5, which is expected to begin airing this fall on CMT.\n\nWhat's Next for Aubrey Peeples and the Cast of Nashville?"
