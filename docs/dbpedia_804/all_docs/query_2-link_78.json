        "text": "Abigail Rose is a teen country music singer, songwriter, and musician who lives in Nashville and travels around the USA performing. We love chatting with teen musicians, both guy and gal singers, pop, R&B stars, or country. Chloe and I are so blown away with Abigail Rose's talent that we had to introduce her to you. She's playing some big arenas in Nasvhille and some cool spaces around the country, so if you're lucky enough to have her in your town, don't miss the chance to see her!\n\nAge: 16 Always has: a song stuck in my head. Proudest of: opening for Sara Evans Is thankful for: supportive family Wants to: inspire people with my music Is afraid of: sharks Believes everyone should: visit as many new places as you can Is embarrassed by: her messy closet My style is: hobo chic but I love anything vintage! Pet peeve: lemon seeds in a drink\n\nhttp://youtu.be/i70Y5zoZaRU Tour schedule and more videos in the links below.\n\nHow did you get started in music? I just had an interest in it and started having all these ideas that I wanted to tell people so when I got my first guitar, I started putting my ideas with music and songwriting just came really naturally to me. There was no stopping me after that. At what point did singing become more than a hobby? I think when I started home schooling, I knew there was no turning back. I knew before then that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life, but when I made the decision to leave regular school and dedicate my time to music, I think that is when it really sunk in. Is the Nashville music scene anything like the show “Nashville”?! Yes! Callie Khouri, the writer of the show, has done a great job showing different aspects of the industry, not just the country side. I really love how Nashville is becoming well-known and respected. It’s fun to see local places on the show. Your career is skyrocketing… do you have time for school and activities besides singing and songwriting? I do. I’m very much a kid at heart. I hang out with my friends, go shopping, watch my favorite shows like Suits, The Carrie Diaries and Pretty Little Liars. Living in Nashville gives me so many opportunities to be around music, which is what I love, so when I have free time I still choose to be around music and go hear other people play.\n\nWhen did you realize you had a true gift for music? How about your parents? I always knew I wanted to perform but when I got my first guitar when I turned 11 I realized that I wanted to be a songwriter and performing artist. I started writing songs and playing out a little bit and fell in love! My parents supported me from the beginning and were behind me for whatever I wanted to try. I am eternally grateful for that. I think they knew I was committed when I decided to be homeschooled so I could really focus on music. What would you recommend for other singers / songwriters (ie, how do you know if singing is a hobby or a career)? When you can’t go a day without writing and you need to be around music to feel complete. Another way I knew is because I am never happier or more myself than when I am on stage performing! Who are your biggest musical influences? Well I get a lot of my inspiration from tons of different artists, not all in country music. Someone I look up to and hope people compare me to one day would be Sheryl Crow. How do you write songs and from where do you draw your inspiration? Usually I get ideas from everyday life. I write down lines or ideas all the time and I never know when something will hit me. I pull a lot of my song ideas from my experiences, but I also get ideas from my friends and family…or a tv show or movie. When will you say “Wow, I’ve made it!” That is such a hard question! I mean, playing at the Grand Ole Opry and the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville are two places that you dream of playing at when you are a country music singer. That will be a defining point for my career. But when I say, “wow I’ve made it,” I think that will be later in life…. What’s up in immediate future and where can we see you perform? I am focusing on writing right now. A lot. I try and write every day. I am also in the recording studio a lot now…working on defining my sound and getting comfortable with the sound I want to produce as an artist. You can always find out where my next show is on my website at AbigailRoseMusic.com and my videos are on YouTube. I'm also on Twitter and Facebook!\n\nI have a huge Girl Crush on Karla Reed, who is not only super fashionable with a mix of trendy and classic looks, but her styles are typically thrift store shopping finds! I follow her on Instagram @karlareed and her Instagram store @chicthrifty to see what amazing pieces she's found, and how she styles them. And yeah, I'm only 1 of the more than 9,000 followers who are probably crushing on her and adore her flair for the amazing finds, but with most of her daily looks totaling under $50, I bet I'm not the only one she's inspired to thrift more often! Karla Reed is the quintessential gal proving you don't have to spend a million to look like a million, and she was sweet enough to answer tons of questions (I could chat all day with her!) about herself and her thrifting. Enjoy! ~Chloe\n\nWhere do you find your fashion inspiration? I mostly find inspiration on Pinterest and through TV and movies. I like the idea of pulling one element from a look or style and coming up with a way to make it my own. I don't read magazines or follow designers. I guess in a way I don't like being told what is trendy. Lol. I try to avoid trends, unless they really speak to me.\n\nWere you stylish in high school? Ummm, I'm not really sure...I tend to think no. Lol. I lived in a very small town and the closest mall was at least 30 minutes away. I've always loved clothes but I'm pretty sure I was clueless when it came to fashion. It wasn't until I went to college in Chicago that started to become more aware of it.\n\nWhat is your favorite store? I'm not sure I have one in particular. I have different stores I like for different things. But if money wasn't an object, I'd say J Crew.\n\nWhat item would you grab from your closet if there was a fire? (heaven forbid) Oh man! Tragic! Ummm, I guess I'd grab my vintage Coach bags ...because they would be the hardest to replace. Hopefully it won't ever come to that;)\n\nWhat do you love about fashion? Seeing as it's my preferred art form:)... I love that it gives me a voice and a way to express myself. I also love the ability it has to make people look and feel beautiful.\n\nWhat is your favorite season for fashion? I guess it's a tie between spring and fall:) There's always an overwhelming need for change. And I love how in both seasons there is the ability to layer. It makes outfits much more interesting and complex.\n\nWhat is your favorite trend right now? Two trends I'm loving for spring are graphic black and white prints with a pop of color and pastels with a pop of neon. Is it spring yet?!\n\nWhat is your biggest fashion faux pas? I don't really think there is a \"wrong\" when it comes to fashion...but I will say, ill fitting clothes really kill an outfit.\n\nIf you could have dinner with any designer, who would it be? Ralph Lauren, no question. He has managed to consistently make beautiful clothes for over 40 years all while staying true to himself. He is such an inspiration.\n\nThrift Specific Questions\n\nWhen did you start thrifting? I remember my mom thrifting even when I was young. So I guess I can say all my life... but I didn't get serious about it until around 4 years ago.\n\nWhy did you start thrifting? I guess the main reason was because I love clothes and I don't have the money to support my addiction;) Thrifting gave me freedom to try any style I wanted with out the guilt of spending a lot. That's when I really came into my own and was able to developed my own personal style.\n\nHow often do you go thrifting? I go a lot:) Mostly because I've opened an Instagram shop where I sell some of my thrift finds. It's become a part time job for me, which I love:) But on a normal week, I probably go 3-5 times.\n\nWhat is your favorite thrift store? Any place I find a treasure:) Here in Salt Lake there are about 10 stores that I go to on a regular basis.\n\nDo you go thrifting with something specific in mind or are you open to anything? I think it's best to go in with an open mind. After all, you have no control over what will be at any given store. But I always have somewhat of a list in my head of things I'm \"hunting\" for.\n\nWhat is your signature style, because you wear a range of different styles? I most relate to a classic/preppy style. But I love the idea of mixing other styles with my preppy roots:)\n\nWhat items do you avoid buying thrifted? I only buy things that seem fairly new and are in good condition. I stay away from things that would take too much time and effort to clean or need tailoring to make work."
