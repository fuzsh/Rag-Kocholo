        "text": "Juliette's plane crashed in a field right outside of Nashville and she is the only survivor. A nearby citizen who witnessed the crash stays with her until help arrives. Avery is informed and goes to see her. Three weeks after the crash, Juliette is in rehab recovering, since two of her vertebrae were shattered, she has a broken leg and is paralyzed. While talking to Rayna, she says that she caused what happened to her because she has messed up everything in her life. Highway 65 has hit some bumps in the road financially, which concerns Rayna. She agrees to play at a private event in Silicon Valley hosted by an app developer named Zach Wells (who is a fanboy of hers) as a way to bring in money. She has an anxiety attack during her flight because of what happened to Juliette, and she is feeling anxiousness about flying home. Later that night, Deacon flies out to California, so he can be with her on the plane back to Nashville. She declines and would rather drive back alone, so she can think. Maddie is having a hard time coming up with a chorus for a song she wrote. Daphne wants to help, but Maddie harshly turns her down. After a talk with Scarlett, Maddie accepts Daphne's input. Avery confesses his love to Juliette, but she responds, \"We'll see how you feel in a few weeks.\" On the way back from visiting the crash site, she comes across a church where she finds the \"angel\" who was with her the night of the crash.\n\nSongs: \"God Shall Wipe All Tears Away\" (sung by Hallie); \"You're Best\" (sung by Maddie and Daphne); \"Already Gone\" (sung by Rayna); \"The Wayfaring Stranger\" (sung by Blind Man and Rayna)\n\nRayna wants her next album to be about her and Deacon's story but Deacon and Bucky aren't so sure. Autumn Chase texts Gunnar and wants him to open up for her again which doesn't sit well with Scarlett. At a meeting with the label Rayna tells them what their new single is which leads to Scarlett getting in a tizzy when she can't figure out who Gunnar wrote the song about. She worries about their past instead of enjoying what they have now. While out celebrating his birthday Will meets Jakob Fine, a menswear designer. He invites Will to a trunk show. Kevin encourages Will to go to the party where Jakob hits on him. Before Jakob has the chance to kiss him, Will stops him and says that he is in a relationship. Juliette is frustrated that she is a \"cripple\" and also doesn't want the public to see her like this. Emily drives Juliette out to the church where she saw the woman who saved her. The pastor says that her name is Hallie but he doesn't give her any personal details since Hallie doesn't want any media attention. Juliette wants him to give her her thanks and cell number. He assures her that God has a plan for her. Zach Welles calls Rayna saying he is on his way to Nashville; he wants to \"hack her cloud\". Later on, as Rayna walks into work, someone watches her as they listen to her music.\n\nSongs: \"All of Me\" (sung by Scarlett and Gunnar); \"Simple as That\" (sung by Deacon); \"Spinning Revolver\" (sung by Will and Kevin)\n\nJuliette continues to feel sensation in her legs and wants to try to speed up her recovery. She has not been taking her pain pills because she is afraid she will get hooked on them like the last time. Will and Kevin go house hunting. Rayna looks for a music video director for The Exes, but they don't have the budget for one. Zach wants to go into business with Rayna. She and Deacon aren't so sure of it, but she needs the money. In return he wants 20% of Highway 65. Rayna discovers a mysterious package with no stamp at her door that is filled with a letter and rose petals. Juliette goes back to the church and asks God why she is the only one who survived the crash. When Kevin finds the application for the condo he and Will were looking at in the trash, he asks Will if he wants to move in together. Will tells him no and they eventually break up.\n\nSongs: \"Burn to Dark\" (sung by Will)\n\nRayna has put a restraining order out on her stalker, and beefs up security at her house. Maddie thinks that her parents hate Clay because he's black, and their opinion about him would be different if he was white. They say no, they just don't like how he's seven years older than her, and it's not about race. Maddie admits to Clay that she is a little afraid of him. Luke has put Wheelin' Dealin' Records up for sale, and Zach wants Highway 65 to acquire it. They go to his show to give him an offer, he accepts. Juliette invites Hallie over for dinner where she then invites Juliette to her church. She also invites her to the East Nashville Community Center, where Juliette discovers that Hallie is in a music group, the Nashville Chocolate Drops. Being inspired after going to church, Juliette says that she wants to make a gospel album after Rayna asks if she wants to go back to Highway 65. She also continues to improve with her recovery, and is now able to use crutches. Scarlett sits in on the editing for The Exes music video. Rayna's stalker surprises Daphne at school.\n\nSongs: \"Won't Back Down\" (sung by Avery); \"His Eye Is On the Sparrow\" (sung by Hallie); \"Sourwood Mountain\" (sung by Hallie); \"Can't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus\" (sung by Hallie); \"Wide Open\" (sung by Luke)\n\nTo help promote Rayna, Zach sends a camera man to film Rayna and Deacon going about their day. Rayna isn't too comfortable with this. Clay says that he doesn't want to fall for Maddie, but she tells him he already has. The Exes and Damien appear on Kathie Lee & Hoda to premiere their music video. While Rayna and Deacon are writing their story, Gene the cameraman is irritating them because he won't leave them alone. Deacon takes Rayna out of the house to take a break from Gene, and while they are away Maddie invites Clay over. Rayna gets a call saying there was a fire at the house. Maddie had baked a cake but forgot about it while she was upstairs with Clay. When they get home the firemen inform them that the fire was small and there was no damage. Rayna is not happy with Maddie that she had invited Clay over while being home alone with Daphne. Scarlett and Damien get past their differences with each other, and he steals a kiss from her.\n\nSongs: \"My Favorite Hurricane\" (sung by Deacon and Rayna)\n\nJuilette tells Hallie about her plans for making an Gospel album leaving Hallie confused. She questions why since that genre really isn't her thing but accepts it. Scarlett and Damien get closer, and she breaks up with Gunnar. Wayne Hockney, Rayna's stalker taunts the Jaymes/Claybourne household by going as far as he's allowed with his restraining order. This drives them crazy, turning their lives around, and Deacon wants to confront him. The police advise not to do that. They want him arrested but can't since his hasn't done anything he's not supposed to. When Juliette tells the choir at church her idea and says that she wants them to sing on the album with her as partners, there are mixed reactions. She gets in a pretty heated argument with one woman. The next day she goes back to church to apologize, give her reasons for making the album and they all agree to it. Rayna hears Clay sing and wants him to come down to Highway 65 to talk about his future. Wayne violates his restraining order by surprising her at work. He holes up in her office where they talk, and when she is able to get free he catches her and holds a knife up to her. After pleas from Rayna and the police he lets her go and is arrested. The police take her home, and as she is on the phone with Deacon to tell him what happened, a pickup truck crashes into them.\n\nSongs: \"Close to the Fire\" (sung by Clay); \"Eye of the Storm\" (sung by Avery)\n\nRayna has a shattered pelvis and hip from the crash, and has to have four hours worth of surgery. Seeing her mom lying in the hospital bed, on meds, waiting for surgery, makes Maddie sick. Juliette being Juliette goes against orders from the desk nurse and sees Rayna. Daphne doesn't want to go to her concert at school because Rayna can't go now, and says that Rayna is the only one who cares about her. Juilette is having problems of her own, with her leg bothering her. Laying in her hospital bed, Rayna sees her dead mother, and is talking to her. This freaks Deacon out and worries him because he knows people experience stuff like this before they pass away. The doctor tells him not to worry. Daphne's choir comes to the hospital to support her, and they all sing for Rayna. During this, she crashes and is sent to the ICU. Her organs are failing, and her outcome isn't too promising. She can't hold on any longer, and dies with everyone at her side.\n\nSongs: \"A Life That's Good\" (sung by Maddie, Daphne, and Deacon); \"East Iris\" (sung by Daphne); \"Make You Feel My Love\" (sung by Daphne)\n\nTen weeks later, Juliette is at the album release party for her gospel album, and every single review pans her album.

Daphne is with the homeless teens when they are stealing from a lumber yard, when they get caught and Liv gets hurt while trying to escape.

Deacon heads out to Juliette's performance. Bucky leaves for good, saying it was his idea to quit, and he tells Deacon to be careful as he thinks he is only the first.

Disappointed in the demos that she was sent, she asks if she has to write the whole record herself. When she gets bumped from performing on Jimmy Kimmel Live it determines her to get her career back on track. Deacon is called to perform at the Bluebird though he is hesitant to do so. Bucky gives him some convincing words that Rayna might say. He agrees. When Deacon gets home he tells Daphne that Liv can't live with forever. Later on at the Bluebird he reconnects with an old Bluebird singer, Jessie Caine.

Fortunately neither one of them are charged. The video ends up leaking online, and makes its way to the press. Clay decides to break up with her, tells her that they live in two different worlds, he gets why she stood up for him but tells her he could have got shot. When Juilette meets with a producer named Travis Stroud, he wants her to give Maddie a demo to listen to. She is tempted to keep it herself after listening to it, she wants to do the right thing and give it to Maddie but temptation gets the best of her.

He warns her that the industry can be unforgiving. Juliette tells her that she shouldn't be afraid of a little controversy. Meanwhile Highway 65 meets their new marketing director, Alyssa Greene who knows nothing about the music industry or country music. Alyssa gives the idea of brand partnership. Juliette is unimpressed, Will is open to it, and Gunnar isn't sure. Juliette sets up a gig for Hallie at the Bluebird so everyone can hear her. Everyone is left impressed, and the label is interested in her. Hallie has some reservations on signing since the label only wants her and not her band too. Maddie goes to Clay's and they end up breaking up. Daphne helps Maddie make a video as a way to apologize about the ordeal with police.
