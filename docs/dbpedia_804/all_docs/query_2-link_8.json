The pilot was made available on Hulu, iTunes, and ABC.com before it premiered on television.\n\nThe pilot episode received critical acclaim, specifically praising Callie Khouri's writing, casting, and the performances of Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere.[2][3][4] At the 70th Golden Globe Awards, Britton was nominated for Best Actress and Panettiere was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, while the series was nominated for Favorite New TV Drama at the 39th People's Choice Awards and Best New Series at the 65th Writers Guild of America Awards; Britton was also nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series at the Primetime Emmy Awards.

Khouri lived in Nashville from 1978 to 1982.[7] In interview for The New York Times she said “This is a place that can be mocked and made fun of, and sometimes it deserves it, like any place. But it also is an incredibly beautiful, cosmopolitan city, and I wanted to show that to the world. I want to represent it in a way that everybody who lives here would find completely realistic.”[7] Nashville was the first television series in Khouri' career, who worked two decades as film writer and director creating strong female characters.[8]\n\nThe production began in 2011. On October 2011, ABC bought the original concept from Khouri.[1] Documentary filmmaker R. J.
