        "text": "Nashville's strength resides not just in what happens in it, but in how it happens. The story matters, but it's the way its characters evolve that really makes the difference.\n\nFull Review | Nov 4, 2023\n\nEven if you're not into country music, give Nashville a shot. The large, talented cast is top-notch, the drama will pull you in, and the music only helps to set each scene perfectly.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8.5/10 | Oct 10, 2012\n\nThe supporting cast is uniformly terrific, a series of political and personal dilemmas are depicted with thoughtful nuance, and this show isn't so much about country music as it is about a desire to communicate, be loved and be heard.\n\nFull Review | Oct 10, 2012\n\nAt its core, Nashville is an intriguing story about accepting harsh realities but not settling for them.\n\nFull Review | Oct 10, 2012\n\nOne of the great pleasures of Nashville is that it arrived fully formed, with a sure sense of what it wants to accomplish dramatically, and with a masterful command of atmosphere and setting.\n\nFull Review | Oct 10, 2012\n\nNo matter what stories you tell, if you don't have truly interesting characters, nobody is going to care. Fortunately, Nashville has created a number of them in just the one hour of its pilot.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Oct 10, 2012\n\nHere's the TV series that speaks to the economic worry and pain this country is feeling without being heavy-handed about it.\n\nFull Review | Oct 10, 2012\n\nIn almost every way, Nashville moves like a show that knows what it wants to be, and even if not everything's in place just yet, that has to inspire confidence.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B+ | Oct 10, 2012\n\nNashville is at once a city and an idea, and what's most impressive about the pilot for the TV Nashville is that it's willing to consider both.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B+ | Oct 10, 2012"
