        "text": "One of the most anticipated new shows of the fall television season is a scripted series called “Nashville.” The premise sounds familiar; aging country music legend competes with a young up-and-comer. The same plot was used in the popular movies “Crazy Heart” and “Country Strong.” “Nashville” stars Connie Britton of “Friday Night Lights” and “American Horror Story.” She plays a middle-age star whose career is threatened by a young and hungry rival, played by Hayden Panettiere (“Heroes”).\n\nThe series will air on ABC beginning Oct. 10. Shot in Nashville, many of the scenes take place in hang-outs like the Bluebird Café, Ryman Auditorium and the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nThe show was created by Callie Khouri, the same person who wrote the movie “Thelma and Louise.” Her husband is legendary producer T. Bone Burnett. Burnett is in charge of selecting the show’s music, as well as coaching the stars on how to look and act the part of country star. He gave all of the actors iPods loaded with songs their characters may have listened to at various stages of their life.\n\nJohn Paul White, one half of the husband/wife Grammy-winning country duo Civil Wars, has written most of the songs that will be featured during the series.\n\nABC television is putting a lot of stock in country music this season. They will be airing the very popular ratings generator, the Country Music Awards, Nov. 1, and using that to propel another new fall series which stars Reba McEntire. McEntire, who’s self titled “Reba” was one of the biggest hits ever on the WB network, takes another crack at the small screen with a comedy called “Malibu Country.”\n\nABC’s official synopsis of the series reads:\n\nWhen Reba Gallagher (Reba) discovers her husband, Bobby, (Jeffrey Nordling) a country music legend, has a cheatin’ heart, her world is turned upside down. Reba dreamt of becoming a country star herself, but put her career on hold to raise a family.\n\nNow she’s questioning all of that, big-time. With the ink on her divorce barely dry, Reba packs up her sharp-tongued mother, Lillie May (Lily Tomlin), her two kids and the U-Haul and heads for sunny California to begin a new chapter. Still, with the support of her family she sets about finding her voice, jump-starting her music career with the help of her new music agent, Geoffrey (Jai Rodriguez), and embracing this chance to begin again.\n\n“Malibu Country” will air Friday nights on ABC."
