        "text": "The highs and lows of glitzy stardom. Political intrigue. Compelling characters with fabulous back stories. Addictive music. Nashville, created by Callie Khouri, has all this and more—and the critics have responded in kind, praising it as the best-written new series of the season. Though the rivalry between the established country music star Rayna Jaymes (TV’s favorite wife Connie Britton) and teen queen Juliette Barnes (\"Save the Cheerleader\" Hayden Panettiere) is “the engine that drives the story” (per Time's James Poniewozik), fans of the show are equally passionate about the supporting players who make up the chassis. Will budding singer-songwriter Scarlett find happiness with good guy Gunnar or return to bad boy Avery? Stay tuned.\n\nJoin the #PaleyFest conversation on Twitter:\n\nTweets about \"PaleyFest\""
