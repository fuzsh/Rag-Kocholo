        "text": "NASHVILLE\n\nSeason One Soundtrack - Available Now!\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER\n\nThe official NASHVILLE soundtrack is now available on Big Machine Records. The project features new music from the cast – Connie Britton, Hayden Panettiere, Charles Esten, Jonathan Jackson, Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio – who perform in each episode. Award-winning producers T Bone Burnett, Dann Huff and Michael Knox have worked together to showcase the original content on both the show and soundtrack, respectively.\n\nTRACKLISTING:\n\nBuried Under\n\nPerformed by Connie Britton/ Written by Chris Destefano, Natalie Hemby\n\nIf I Didn't Know Better\n\nPerformed by Sam Palladio, Clare Bowen / Written by Arum Rae, John Paul White\n\nUndermine\n\nPerformed by Hayden Panettiere, Charles Esten / Written by Trent Dabbs, Kacey Musgraves\n\nSideshow\n\nPerformed by Charles Esten / Written by Aaron Scherz, Brad Tursi\n\nWrong Song\n\nPerformed by Connie Britton, Hayden Panettiere / Written by Marv Green, Sonya Isaacs, Jimmy Yeary\n\nNo One Will Ever Love You\n\nPerformed by Connie Britton, Charles Esten / Written by Steve McEwan, John Paul White\n\nTwist Of Barbwire\n\nPerformed by Jonathan Jackson / Written by Elvis Costello\n\nLove Like Mine\n\nPerformed by Hayden Panettiere / Written by Kelly Archer, Emily Shackleton, Justin Weaver\n\nTelescope\n\nPerformed by Lennon Stella, Maisy Stella / Written by Cary Barlowe, Hillary Lindsay\n\nWhen The Right One Comes Along\n\nPerformed by Clare Bowen, Sam Palladio / Written by Georgia Middleman, Justin Davis, Sarah Zimmermann\n\nTelescope (Radio Mix)\n\nPerformed by Hayden Panettiere / Written by Cary Barlowe, Hillary Lindsay\n\nChart-topping Rayna James (Connie Britton) is a country legend who's had a career any singer would envy, though lately her popularity is starting to wane. Fans still line up to get her autograph, but she's not packing the arenas like she used to. Rayna's record label thinks a concert tour, opening for up-and-comer Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere), the young and sexy future of country music, is just what Rayna needs. But scheming Juliette can't wait to steal Rayna's spotlight. Sharing a stage with that disrespectful, untalented, little vixen is the last thing Rayna wants to do, which sets up a power struggle for popularity. Could the undiscovered songwriting talent of Scarlett O'Connor (Clare Bowen) be the key to helping Rayna resurrect her career?\n\nComplicating matters, Rayna's wealthy but estranged father, Lamar Hampton (Powers Boothe), is a powerful force in business, Tennessee politics, and the lives of his two grown daughters. His drive for power results in a scheme to back Rayna's handsome husband, Teddy, in a run for Mayor of Nashville, against Rayna's wishes.\n\nNashville stars Connie Britton (Friday Night Lights, American Horror Story) as Rayna, Hayden Panettiere (Heroes) as Juliette, Powers Boothe (MacGruber, 24) as Lamar, Charles Esten (Enlightened, Big Love) as Deacon, Eric Close (Chaos, Without a Trace) as Teddy, Clare Bowen as Scarlett, Jonathan Jackson (General Hospital) as Avery, Sam Palladio as Gunnar and Robert Wisdom as Coleman.\n\nNashville was written by Callie Khouri (Thelma & Louise) who is an executive producer along with R.J. Cutler (The September Issue, The War Room, A Perfect Candidate) and Steve Buchanan. The pilot for Nashville was directed by R.J. Cutler. The series is produced by Lionsgate, ABC Studios and Gaylord Entertainment."
