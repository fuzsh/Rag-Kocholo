        "text": "Although a watched pot never boils, a watched potboiler usually does. That’s why ABC is so high on its new series Nashville. Created by Callie Khouri, best known for writing Thelma & Louise, this saga of battling singers, battling families, and battling power brokers looks to be one of the fall’s juiciest—and most popular—shows.\n\nConnie Britton stars as Rayna Jaymes, the queen of country music, who, after two decades at the top, is approaching what the industry thinks is her sell-by date. To her horror and humiliation, her record company asks her to go on tour with—indeed, open for—Juliette Barnes, a sexed-up little demon of ambition who turns out earworm hits that Rayna calls “crap.” Played with conniving relish by Hayden Panettiere, Juliette (who has her own problems) wants it all. Not only does this cocky upstart treat Rayna with all the respect a Hummer shows a squirrel, she even hopes to poach Rayna’s songwriting sidekick—and longtime adorer—Deacon Claybourne (Charles Eston).\n\nIf a musical catfight was all the show had to offer, it would be merely a network version of the 2010 movie Country Strong, in which Gwyneth Paltrow and Leighton Meester played country-and-western rivals who tugged at **Garrett Hedlund’**s handsome troubadour as if he were a wishbone. Khouri’s obviously going for something more expansive—something more like Robert Altman’s influential (if hugely overrated) Nashville, which sought to paint a portrait of an entire culture. So in addition to the hustling Juliette, Rayna also has to deal with her father (Powers Boothe), a bullying mogul who gets her weakly ineffectual husband (Eric Close) to run for mayor, even though she’s promised her support to the sitting mayor (a terrific Robert Wisdom). Further thickening the roux, Khouri dishes up a fetching plot about a pair of struggling singer-songwriters (well played by Sam Palladio and Clare Bowen) who, like nearly everyone cast as heartland Americans on TV these days, actually come from abroad—he’s British, she’s Australian.\n\nAfter a single episode, one never really knows where a series will go, but unlike, say, Elementary and The Mob Doctor, which seemed to exhaust their main ideas in their pilots, Nashville is bursting with interesting possibilities. Not only is the action intelligently steeped in the C&W world—the music, of which there’s plenty, is handled by T Bone Burnett—but Khouri also has a real feel for showing the complexity of women’s lives. The show’s subject is how its heroine, Rayna, manages to deal with a life in which everything that appeared solid now appears to be melting away.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a more perfect person for the role than Britton, who, as she showed in Friday Night Lights and American Horror Story, possesses an easy, twangy, down-to-earth warmth that makes her not just real, but inviting. Unafraid to play her age, she’s a genuinely great TV actress. There was a time when such a description might have been an insult, but television is not merely better than ever but, unlike today’s movies, it’s a medium that respects women and actively woos them (just think of all those hunky actors in True Blood and Game of Thrones and, yes, Nashville). Anchored by a star the audience finds it impossible not to root for, Nashville has the chance to become one of the strangest hybrids ever—All About Eve meets The Good Wife meets a Music City version of Treme. I mean this, by the way, as a compliment.\n\nThe first episode of Nashville airs Wednesday, October 10, at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT on ABC."
