        "text": "The season five finale of “Nashville” on CMT aired on Thursday night, August 10, and featured a first in the appearance of Texas country music sensation, Kacey Musgraves, making her debut. The musical drama focuses on characters Alyssa and Zach (a social-media guru and a billionaire, respectively) at odds with Deacon over the Highway 65 record label, which has been in Deacon’s capable hands since the passing of his wife, character Rayna Jaymes.\n\nIn April of this year, Musgraves tweeted the following about the show: “Here I am 5 yrs ‘late to the party’ [pun intended] and I’ll admit I’m now OBSESSED with the show Nashville. It’s a sick addiction now.” Using the title of a track from her “Pageant Material” LP (hence the “pun”) within the tweet, she caught the attention of Callie Khouri, “Nashville” series creator, who responded in a tweet shortly thereafter, saying, “Then come be on the show. We’d LOVE to have you!” In this finale episode of its fifth season, one of the brighter moments (in light of the storyline conflict) comes as Musgraves walks into the studio at Highway 65, and sits in on an impromptu jam with Daphne and Maddie (characters played by Maisy and Lennon Stella)."
