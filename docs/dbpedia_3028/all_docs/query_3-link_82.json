        "text": "The Post’s theater columnist, Michael Riedel, knows all the juiciest stories about the backstage shenanigans that make up Broadway’s history. Here, in an excerpt from his new book, “Razzle Dazzle,” he explains how “A Chorus Line” changed the world. The show opened in 1975 and went on to become one of the longest-running productions on the Great White Way, winning nine Tonys, including Best Musical, Best Score and Best Direction of a Musical. That last one went to Michael Bennett, who had the idea to create a show about show folk — a musical that would make him Broadway’s top director.\n\nHe was born Michael “Mickey” Bennett DiFiglia on April 8, 1943 in Buffalo, New York. His mother, Helen, was a secretary for Sears; his father, Salvatore, a machinist at a Chevrolet plant, and a gambler often in hock to low-level members of the Magaddino crime family. The Bennett household was an unhappy one, strapped for cash due to Salvatore’s gambling debts. At age 2, Bennett found his escape. He began “to dance around the living room,” as a line from “A Chorus Line” goes, to the music on the radio.\n\nBy 10, he began earning money dancing at bar mitzvahs, weddings, even street corners. When he wasn’t dancing, he was choreographing, using his brother Frank’s marbles as dancers and creating patterns for routines.\n\nThough Salvatore derided his son’s pirouetting, he liked the extra income. He pocketed most of it, losing it at the track and the card tables. The searing event of Bennett’s childhood — one that haunted him throughout his life — took place one day in their kitchen. Salvatore, heavily in debt, had a plan: He would sell his son’s talent to the Mafia.\n\nHe invited two mobsters to the house and ordered Michael to dance. He said his kid was going to make serious money as a dancer one day, and offered them a percentage of his future income. The mobsters passed. They dealt in gambling, prostitution, racketeering, and extortion — not sissy boys who knew every step to the dream ballet from “Oklahoma!”\n\nA few years later, at 16, Bennett heard that Jerome Robbins was auditioning dancers for a European company of “West Side Story.”\n\n“I got on a bus to New York and said, ‘I am not coming back.’ ”\n\nHe began making the rounds as a Broadway “gypsy,” the name for chorus kids who float from show to show. Along the way Bennett was picking up dancers he would use in shows he would choreograph one day (including Stephen Sondheim’s “Company” and “Follies”). But what he really wanted to do was direct. After making his bones on the play “Twigs” and the slick musical comedy “Seesaw,” in January 1974, Bennett interviewed dancers for the show that would make him the most powerful director on Broadway. To do that, he joined forces with the most powerful man Off Broadway.\n\nJoseph Papp, the energetic and mercurial head of the Public Theater, disdained Broadway. He often said, “Broadway is s - - t” — mainstream, safe, commercial.\n\nBernard Gersten, Papp’s second-in-command, didn’t hate Broadway and kept on top of its shows and gossip. He thought Bennett would be a good choice to overhaul a musical that was in trouble at the Public — “More Than You Deserve,” which featured a performer named Meat Loaf. Bennett had another idea, however, and wondered if he might come down to the Public and pitch it.\n\nHe arrived at Papp’s office carrying a reel-to-reel tape recorder. He had nearly 24 hours of interviews with Broadway dancers and thought there might be a show in it. After listening to the recordings for 45 minutes, Papp said, “OK, let’s do it.”\n\nAt the beginning of the first tape, Bennett says, “I really want to talk about us. I think we’re all pretty interesting . . . and I think maybe there is a show in there somewhere, which would be called ‘A Chorus Line.’ ”\n\nThose tapes had been recorded around midnight, Jan. 18, 1974, at the Nickolaus Exercise Centers on East 23rd Street. It was late at night because most of the dancers Bennett corralled were working and couldn’t meet until after their shows. Bennett provided food and wine — “very cheap red wine,” said Donna McKechnie, who later played Cassie in the show (and also married Bennett).\n\n“We wanted the biggest cross section possible so that we could try to find what the common experience was,” choreographer Tony Stevens was quoted as saying in Ken Mandelbaum’s “ ‘A Chorus Line’ and the Musicals of Michael Bennett.” “And Michael wanted some enemies in the room, so there were rivals there, people who had histories that were not so great.”\n\nWith Bennett asking most of the questions, and fueled by wine, the dancers told their stories. Many, like Bennett, had grown up in unhappy households. Some talked about alcoholic parents. Others spoke about philandering fathers and broken marriages. Many of the men talked about their sexuality, and the consequences of hiding it from friends and family. Nicholas Dante recalled his experiences as a teenager working at night as a drag queen in a tawdry club. His story would inspire what would become the show’s climax — the character Paul’s monologue about meeting his parents, unexpectedly, at the stage door of a drag club where he worked.\n\nOne dancer talked about her weak singing voice and how it hurt her auditions (“Sing!”). Another spoke about her father’s string of infidelities and how she found solace at ballet class (“At the Ballet”). The session lasted 12 hours, and was so fruitful, that Bennett decided to hold another.\n\nWhen Bennett told his lawyer, John Breglio, about the tapes and his plan to make a show from them, Breglio blanched. “Wait a minute. You can’t have all these people sitting around telling you their life stories for a show. You’re going to have 20 authors — and 20 lawsuits. You’ve got to get them to sign a release.”\n\nIn the end, the dancers who took part in the tapings waived their right to their life stories for a dollar each — and the stipulation that if their stories were used, their names would be changed. When the show became a hit, Bennett had Breglio draw up a contract that gave a share of his royalties to the dancers. At the height of its popularity, “A Chorus Line” earned close to $10,000 a year for each dancer. That, of course, was nothing compared to the millions it earned Bennett. And many of the original dancers would later complain that they had sold their lives for a pittance. But nobody had any idea that two tape sessions would become the basis for the biggest hit in Broadway history.\n\nTo write the music, Bennett turned to Marvin Hamlisch, who’d won Oscars for “The Way We Were” and “The Sting.” He was one of the most sought-after composers in Hollywood, and stood to earn millions scoring movies. But Hamlisch had dreamed since childhood of writing a Broadway musical. His agent wasn’t happy: Papp was paying everyone who worked on “A Chorus Line” a hundred dollars a week.\n\nHamlisch said the collaboration was the most exciting and enjoyable of his career in show business. There was little bickering. The one big fight was over the show’s anthem, “What I Did for Love.” Papp loathed it.\n\n“Joe wanted to cut it,” recalled Gersten. “He thought it was ‘just a Broadway number.’ It was pandering to the Broadway audience.”\n\nBut Hamlisch wanted a hit song from the show. And Bennett knew the show needed its tear-jerker.\n\n“Fine,” said Papp, and walked out of the rehearsal room.\n\nAnybody who was at the Newman Theater at the Public on April 16, 1975, for that first preview will never forget the experience. At the end of the opening number — “I Hope I Get It” — the audience of 299 stood and cheered and cried. In theater circles that night, phones rang off the hook with the news that the Public Theater had a massive hit.\n\n“I don’t think there was a ticket left the next day,” said Gersten. “Celebrities started sitting on the steps to watch the show.” At any given performance, you could see\n\n​​Liza Minnelli, Diana Ross, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Shirley MacLaine, David Geffen or Cher on the stairs of the Newman.\n\n“Fire laws were ignored,” Breglio said. “You hear today about people trying to get tickets to ‘Book of Mormon.’ It was 20 times that. People would do anything to get in.”\n\nWith the critics on board, “A Chorus Line” was headed to Broadway. The Public Theater would be the sole producer. Bennett wanted 15 percent of the profits plus 5 percent of the weekly box office gross. “We didn’t say no,” Gersten recalled. That deal would make Bennett the richest director in the history of Broadway.\n\nA few hurdles remained. “You have one problem,” Robert McDonald, head of the stagehands union, told Philip J. Smith of the Shubert Organization. “The mirror scene. You have all these people moving mirrors, and they’re actors. On Broadway, they’re going to have to be stagehands.”\n\nSmith reported back to Shubert Organization president Bernard Jacobs, who called McDonald and exploded. “We cannot pay four or five stagehands for one scene in the show — absolutely not.”\n\nMcDonald replied, “I have a suggestion. Fly the mirrors in. One man is all you need.”\n\nAnd that’s the way it was done, mirrors on wires, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nOver the course of its run in New York and around the world, the show earned $40 million for the Public Theater, making it, as Helen Epstein writes in her book, “Joe Papp: An American Life,” “the most affluent institutional theater in America.” Papp poured the money back into the Public, giving a home to actors, writers and directors — Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Larry Kramer, Tony Kushner. Papp himself was affected by the success of “A Chorus Line.”\n\nThe man who once called Broadway “s - - t” started dressing like a Broadway producer, with a long coat draped over his shoulders and a cigar in his mouth. He even appeared in ads for “A Chorus Line” on the sides of telephone booths. “Nothing’s more New York than a Broadway curtain call,” the ads read, picturing Papp wearing a tuxedo and flowing white scarf. “Joe took to being a Broadway producer like catnip,” said Gersten.\n\nBennett was now the most sought-after director in the world. And Broadway itself reaped rewards from “A Chorus Line.” In 1974, attendance was 6.6 million. The next year, when “A Chorus Line” opened, it shot up to 7.2 million.\n\nThe show ran 15 years at the Shubert. Decades later, Smith, now chairman of the board of the Shubert Organization, said: “Before ‘A Chorus Line,’ there was no money. After ‘A Chorus Line,’ there was nothing but money.”"
