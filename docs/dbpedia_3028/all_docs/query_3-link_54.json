The plot centres around Broadway dancers auditioning for places in a chorus line, with the entire musical set on the bare stage of a Broadway theatre during auditions. A Chorus Line provides a glimpse into the personalities of individual performers and the production&rsquo;s choreographer as they describe the events which have shaped their lives and decisions to dance professionally.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6012px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6012px;\">&nbsp;</span><br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6012px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6012px;\">Following several workshops and a highly successful off-Broadway production, A Chorus Line opened on Broadway in ]uly 1975, directed and choreographed by Michael Bennett.
