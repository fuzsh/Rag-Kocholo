He founded Chorus Films to create an agile turnkey production company with reach across creative disciplines. A talented multi-hyphenate who knows the process intimately from both sides of the camera, Troy brings a wealth of experience and quiet confidence to all of his projects. On set; he runs a tight ship while keeping it fun. In person: he’s a sincere, affable fellow who brings out the best in everyone from celebrities to first-time on-camera talent.

Combine that with over a decade of deep improvisational comedy training, teaching, and performance, and you’ve got a very well equipped, instinctual artist. He loves to collaborate, he’s a good listener, and he strives to make on-set experiences fun and positive for crew members and clients. Speaking of clients, his list of past collaborations is lengthy and respectable, but name-dropping is boring so if you’d like to hear more about it, just reach out. You can also check out Tom at his very own chomppictures.com\n\nView Tom’s Work\n\nMEAGAN MASSA\n\nProducer\n\nPerhaps no one at Chorus Films wears more hats than Meagan.

Meagan is also a gifted writer, emerging director, and a self-described movie nerd. Between commercial projects, she wrote and directed a short film, and is currently focusing her creative efforts on two feature screenplays.\n\nView Meagan’s Work\n\nJORDAN PILGRIM\n\nDP / Editor\n\nJordan Pilgrim is a gifted cinematographer, colorist, and shooter with a decade of experience working in commercial, documentary, and narrative disciplines. He is also one of the most well-read people you’ll meet, and great to bang ideas around with over an IPA. The oldest of six brothers and a co-founder of the company, Jordan’s quiet confidence and unflappable work ethic on set are an asset to every production he’s on.\n\nView Jordan’s Work\n\nNATHAN BOWHALL\n\nEditor / GRFX\n\nThere from the very beginning, Editor and all around creative savant Nathan Bowhall co-founded Chorus to continue serving his dedicated agency clients while expanding his range of storytelling and GRFX skills across multiple disciplines.

A talented designer, visual artist, and VR creator – Jim is often a part of our team. He also throws in on all our original science experiments ;).\n\nMICHAEL ANTHONY\n\nWriter / Actor / Artist / OG\n\nA talented multi-hyphenate, Mike has been there from the beginning as an inspiring force and trusted collaborator whose gotten his hands dirty on a number of Chorus projects.
