        "text": "A new HD version of Sir Paul McCartney’s We All Stand Together will soon be released, coinciding the centenary of Rupert the Bear in 2022. We All Stand Together, which is also known as ‘The Frog Song’, first appeared in 1984 animated short Rupert and the Frog Song, when the titular Bear stumbles across a host of multicoloured frogs who congregate to sing. The award-winning film (directed by Geoff Dunbar) is being re-released in a 4K restoration, featuring a new audio mix and introduction by the director.\n\nYou access the video using the password below here\n\nPassword: faberXRuper7_Wm\n\nA choral-orchestral version of Rupert and the Frog Song is available to hire for concert performances of the 1984 hit. Scored for SAATB choir and orchestra, with optional actors/narrators and film projection, the 13-minute presentation is ideal for programming in family and holiday concerts. The optional accompanying film is available through MPL Communications Ltd. The first performance of this version, orchestrated by George Martin, was given in December 2019 by the Bath Philharmonia conducted by Jason Thornton."
