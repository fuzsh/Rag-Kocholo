        "text": "1. Before Sunrise\n\n2. Safe\n\n3. Showgirls\n\nDebated between Heat and Showgirls, I do fucking love Heat, but Showgirls is such a bold and complex film. It's genuinely dark in ways that a lot of films described that way pale in comparison to. Obviously Heat is an all-timer, but this was a really good year because you can't beat Before Sunrise or Safe either. I've posted about Welcome II the Terrordome before, a politically radical Afrofuturist sci-fi film, the first theatrically distributed British feature by a black woman, and the kind of movie that doesn't really get to exist anymore in the dominance of Disney in most genre films now. Billy Madison and Crimson Tide are Hollywood studio films that hit every note pretty well. I'm a Higher Learning fan, John Singleton is always worth watching as the ideas in his films are often prescient (the scene where Ice Cube asks Omar Epps how he'll feel and what he'll do as a black man when, at his first game, they play the National Anthem). Scorsese's Casino is really, really strong, just a testament to how good he is that I don't consider it among his best. Kids was a big moment for my friend group when we rented it and watched it at a sleepover one night when we were 15 or 16. And Kicking and Screaming was the first Baumbach I think I ever saw. What a great year.\n\n1. Before Sunrise\n\n2. Ghost in the Shell\n\n3. A Close Shave\n\nBefore Sunrise is just beautiful storytelling, done with wonderful simplicity, that looks easy, but considering the number of bad Before Sunrise knock-offs, it really isn't. By the looks of it, it's going to win this year at a canter.\n\nGhost in the Shell is a visually stunning, puzzling animation, that packs a huge amount of conceptual stuff in 80 minutes, but still finds time for robot crabs with machine guns. It's fascinating as the middle point between it's influences (Akira, Tetsuo, Blade Runner etc) and what it influenced (The Matrix most obviously, but most other sci-fi that came after). My controversial (maybe?) opinion is that I think that the live action reboot with Scarlett Johansson was actually fairly decent.\n\nA Close Shave is the third Wallace and Gromit short, this one a very silly pastiche of bits of British Hammer Horror stuff, meeting The Terminator. I remember being genuinely quite scared of Preston, the robot dog, and the climax is still pretty terrifying. Beautiful stuff.\n\nHonourable mentions include another batch of very formative and important films to me when I started watching films more seriously; La Haine, Casino, Se7en, The Usual Suspects, Heat & Twelve Monkeys.\n\nWe have Wong Kar Wai's Fallen Angels, which was originally intended as the third story in Chungking Express, and has that hazy melancholic air to it that nobody does better than him, albeit with much more violence.\n\nI really like Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man, a curious film about William Blake traversing through the Wild West and at some point (but it's not clear exactly when...) dying, in what feels like a state between life and death, the dream world and the waking one.\n\nA couple of good ones from India, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, which is a massive smash hit blockbuster romance starring Shah Rukh Khan. My knowledge of Bollywood cinema is very minimal, but I enjoyed this. It's also been playing in a theatre in Mumbai ever since it's been released. For something different from India, I like Naseem, a socially realist slice of life, set during times of upheaval in Mumbai about schoolgirl Naseem and her family.\n\nKen Loach's Land and Freedom is another good one from this year, about the civil war in Spain, about about failed and splintered revolutionaries. Reminded me a lot of Loach's masterpiece The Wind That Shakes the Barley, with Loach's depiction of the moral complexity and ambiguity of a revolution.\n\nWe have the first entry in Takashi Miike's yakuza Black Society Trilogy this year, Shinjuku Triad Society, which is good.\n\nToy Story is great too, of course."
