        "text": "\"The characters portrayed in A CHORUS LINE are, for the most part, based upon the lives of Broadway dancers. This show is dedicated to anyone who has ever danced in a chorus or marched in step...anywhere.\"\n\nThe opening night for this production is occasionally erroneously listed as October 19, 1975. When A Chorus Line transferred from the Public to Broadway on July 25, 1975 (the off-Broadway run having only closed on July 13), the production opted not to be re-reviewed until September 28 (a full two months later – which would have been an extraordinarily long preview period for the time). The performances during this time were not counted as previews – its weekly grosses were reported in Variety that summer as performances. Variety noted on July 23, 1975 that A Chorus Line was opening that Friday, and the following week again noted that it had opened when reporting the production’s grosses. However, the September 28 review date was pushed back to October 19 due to the Local 802 strike of 1975; A Chorus Line was dark September 18 – October 12. Variety, in its October 22, 1975 edition, says the production “had its so-called ‘press opening’ last Sunday night (19),” noting it was not recognized as its official opening. Additionally, there is a plaque in the lobby of the Shubert Theatre noting the opening night as July 25.\n\nOn September 29, 1983, this production celebrated its 3,389th performance, surpassing Grease as the longest-running show in Broadway history at the time. For this performance, over 300 performers from various companies (Broadway, touring, international) of A Chorus Line performed in the show’s finale “One.” Performers who only appeared in the Broadway production on this date are noted as such on the ‘replacement’ tab."
