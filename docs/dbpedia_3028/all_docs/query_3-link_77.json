        "text": "Queer Runners Society triumphing cheers over tragedy\n\nThe Queer Runners Society (QRS), like many creative ideas, was born out of a social happy hour. Following connections established at the 2022 US Trail Running Conference, four LGBTQ+ advocates, Mikah Meyer, Jake Federoski, Patti Flynn, and Michael Clemens, brainstormed actionable for LGBTQ+ inclusion in the running community, which led to the hosting of an impromptu happy hour at the 2023 Running USA Industry Conference.\n\nPrior to the Running USA conference, the four advocates had reached out to the organizers to offer their expertise on LGBTQ+ inclusion, a topic the conference had not been included in the schedule. They gave suggestions for how to include the LGBTQ+ community at the conference better, but their ideas were denied. Meyer describes their difficulties in working with Running USA and creative solution to provide space for LGBTQ+ conversation at the conference with a happy hour, “We were looking at schedules for the Running USA conference and noticed there were happy hours celebrating women’s, BIPOC, disabled runners, and other types of diversity but none for the LGBTQ+ community. We reached out to Running USA and were told there was no space in the schedule to include anything, let alone a small happy hour for our community. It was strange, and after a few Zoom calls with the organizers, it seemed that the conference was not just uninterested in our ideas but actively against them. We decided to host our own guerrilla LGBTQ+ happy hour at a time during the schedule that was blank, inviting all of our contacts at the conference and in the area.”\n\nThe happy hour was a huge success. Meyer, Federoski, Flynn, and Clemmons spoke on why the running community should include and market to the LGBTQ+ community. The overwhelmingly positive response to their ideas led to the creation of the Queer Running Society (QRS, cleverly pronounced queers) in 2023.\n\nWhat is QRS?\n\nQRS was founded on the mission to elevate the queer running experience in the running industry. Their website provides queer running-related news, as well as lists of coaches, clubs, and other resources for both trail and road athletes, brands, and event organizers. The society is currently in the process of becoming 501(c)(3), which will further the ability of the organization to provide expert guidance on how to promote and celebrate the LGBTQ+ community best. Meyer, who has since become the organization’s Director of Partnerships, explains their main objectives in further detail, “Our goal with QRS is to model the Running Industry Diversity Council, who is focused on racial inclusion and provides brands and runners with access to expert consultants in this field—creating a ‘one stop shop’ for all their needs. Similarly, we want to be the place where the running community can go to find specialists on best practices involving queer inclusion.”\n\nSince its inception, QRS has gained popularity in the media and expanded its membership. QRS hosted a booth at the 2023 The Running Event (TRE) conference, and the society’s founding members have all increased their advocacy efforts in LGBTQ+ inclusion. Federoski published an “Open Letter To the Trail and Ultrarunning Community” (read more here), Clemons was named the Running USA Director of Operations, Flynn took on the role of QRS director of education (read Flynn’s backstory here), and Meyer has become a Community Leader for the popular outdoor apparel brand Eddie Bauer. Little did Meyer know at the time of his promotion, but Eddie Bauer would further their support of his career by creating a film, Canyon Chorus, on his life. Meyer can now add “movie star” to his extensive list of occupations!\n\nCanyon Chorus explores universal themes of parental loss and mentorship\n\nMeyer’s incredible three-year adventure to visit all 419 National Parks Service sites (read more about Meyer’s backstory and National Parks project here) put him on many people’s radar as one of the first prominently gay adventure athletes. He became the first openly gay man to be featured in an outdoor advertisement, and he hosted over 200 live shows about LGBTQ+ inclusion for events with Amazon and Road Runners Club of America. He has also been featured on NRP and The Today Show. Despite his extensive media coverage, there’s much more to his life story Meyer has always hoped to tell.\n\nAs is customary for Eddie Bauer’s Community Leaders, the brand offered resources to create a film about Meyer’s life choices. Reflecting on his journey to the National Parks Service sites, Meyer decided to focus on a major theme of inspiration behind this adventure that he feels has largely been untold: the loss of his father and connection with his music teacher, who became a father figure in his life. Meyer speaks on the themes of the film, “The best thing about this film is that it’s universal. No matter the gender identity, sexual orientation, political party, or any differences, there is something powerful about losing a parent that we can all understand. I lost my father at 19, and at the exact time he was dying, I was auditioning for college music programs. Larry, my future music teacher who awarded me a scholarship, was also my father’s name. So, over the same months, my dad was in the hospice, I was losing one Larry and meeting another Larry who was stepping into this role as a father figure.”\n\nThe film also documents Meyer’s runs through Minnesota, Nebraska, and Mississippi and situates the film on an adventurous rafting trip with his music teacher.\n\nThe Five Points Film Festival, an outdoor sports-themed film festival focused on five pillars— humility, purpose, respect, balance, and commitment— debuted Meyer’s film during the festival, which was held April 24 to 28, 2024, in Carbondale, CO. Following the showing, in Meyer’s impromptu style, was a surprise musical performance by Meyer and cast members of the film for the live audience. Watch the film at the link here.\n\nMeyer states about the film, “I’m so excited that our audiences have taken so much out of this film already. It’s fun to share my story with others and see people relate to it in so many different ways. It’s one of those films where you’ll get things out of it that you wouldn’t expect!”\n\nIn addition to promoting his film, Meyer’s main goals for 2024 are to continue growing the Queer Running Society and to organize a trail race. Meyer, not a race director himself, hopes to connect with experts in this field who would support his vision of a “gay-themed” race open to all participants. Meyer shares his brainstorming on this idea so far, “I’d like this to be a race for the LGBTQ+ community, by the LGBTQ+ community, but open to everyone. There’s a trail along the remote North Rim of the Grand Canyon called Rainbow Rim that would be perfect to fit our race theme. I’m just looking for the right partnership to help make this race a reality.”\n\nReach out at [email protected] if you’d like to connect with Meyer and support his trail race dream!\n\nAll photos used in this article have been generously provided by Mikah Meyer."
