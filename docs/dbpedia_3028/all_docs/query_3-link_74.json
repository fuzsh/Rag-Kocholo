Núñez realized that staying connected and continuing to sing during the pandemic was essential. He embarked on a collaborative journey with illustrious composers, asking each to create a \"round,\" a musical term for a simple song with a repeating phrase, designed to be easily sung by the children over Zoom and on their phones. Showcasing nearly 600 children ages eight to 18, the film's 15 vignettes chronicle this singular challenge, conveying the children's isolation, yearning, and ultimately joy.\n\nThe project initially debuted as an art exhibit in Manhattan's Chelsea district to support students' mental health during COVID-19. Núñez then enlisted social impact filmmaker Ansley Sawyer to create a feature film documenting the personal stories of the choristers and the composers' profound exploration of resilience and hope.\n\n\"I am incredibly honored that the film was selected and that the voices and perspectives of our youth will be shared with audiences at the Manhattan Film Festival,\" said Núñez, the choir's founder and artistic director who also served as co-director and producer of the film.\n\n\"These young people's stories were so strikingly vivid and raw, I knew they needed to be connected to and interwoven with these 15 new compositions, fusing a multiplicity of perspectives, thoughts and feelings about this moment of crisis into one quilt of community experience.\n\n\"Contrary to misconceptions at the time, the impact of the pandemic on children's mental health cannot be overestimated,\" noted Núñez. \"The film serves as a visual testament to these composers' and young artists' struggles and triumphs: from the depths of isolation to their gradual reemergence into a changed world. Through the lens of the camera, we witness the resilience of 600 children, finding solace in music and sharing their voices with the world.\"\n\nThe Manhattan Film Festival has become one of the largest, truly independent film festivals in the world. MFF has a 17-year history of fearless programming. The 18th annual Manhattan Film Festival will be hosted at Cinema Village, just steps from Union Square.\n\nThis Time Round's U.S. premiere will take place Friday, June 21 at 5 p.m. Tickets can be purchased for $12 at https://www.manhattanff.com/view-screening/1848.\n\nASSETS AVAILABLE: Press Screeners, Exclusive Clips, High Resolution Still Images, Production Notes available upon request\n\nWebsite: https://ypcfilms.org/thistimeroundfilm/\n\nView Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JwAktFYqQw\n\nFor more information about YPC, please visit YPC.org.\n\nAbout This Time Round\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a pandemic-stricken New York City, witness the unwavering passion and determination of a youth chorus as they strive to keep their art alive against all odds.
