        "text": "⭐ A CHORUS LINE REIMAGINED – SHORT FILM RELEASED TO RAISE MONEY FOR THEATRES ⭐\n\nChoreographer Taylor Walker has created a special short film, to help raise awareness & money for theatres, entitled – A Chorus Line Reimagined.\n\nCOVID-19 has created an emptiness around the arts sector. The theatre community attracts more than 34M visitors a year, and generates more than £1.28bn a year for the British economy.\n\nWalker, seeing first-hand the impact this was having on theatres across the country decided to gather a small team of creatives to create something magic. That magic was put to a backdrop of the 1985 motion-picture of A Chorus Line, focused on seventeen Broadway dancers auditioning for spots on a chorus line, and Bob Fosse’s Sing, Sing, Sing.\n\nThe project’s collaborators include renowned choreographers Stephen Mear, Matt Cole and Jane McMurtrie, as well as 20 leading and upcoming West End performers.\n\nThe result is a short film that aims to help raise awareness around our struggling theatres, with all funds raised from the film going towards The Kings Theatre in Portsmouth and the Actor’s Benevolent Fund; two companies who continue to give back to the community through the hardest of times.\n\nTo make a donation, go to the JustGiving page here – https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/savingour-theatres\n\nWhat a wonderful thing! ! !\n\nThoughts? X x x\n\nWatch the short film – A Chorus Line Reimagined below."
