Exploring the inner lives and bittersweet ambitions of professional Broadway performers, the show features one powerhouse number after another. Memorable musical numbers include “What I Did for Love”, “One”, “I Can Do That”, “At the Ballet” , “The Music and the Mirror”, and “ Hope I Get It.” A brilliantly complex fusion of song, dance, and compellingly authentic drama, A Chorus Line was instantly recognized as a classic.\n\nPerformance details\n\nThe roles of Zach and Cassie are double cast and we have understudies who will be performing on the following dates:\n\nWednesday November 13th at 19:30\n\nCassie will be played by Justyna Borowiecka\n\nZach will be played by Brian Ligthart\n\nBebe will be played by Yara Khalil\n\nJudy will be played by Rhijja Jansen\n\nThursday November 14th at 19:30\n\nCassie will be played by Eva Kilian\n\nZach will be played by Michael Schilder\n\nMaggie will be played by Alissa Kos\n\nSheila will be played by Cheryl Hart\n\nJudy will be played by Brigid Boyle\n\nFriday November 15th at 19:30\n\nCassie will be played by Justyna Borowiecka\n\nZach will be played by Brian Ligthart\n\nDiana will be played by Joanna Lucas\n\nJudy will be played by Rhijja Jansen\n\nSaturday November 16th at 19:30\n\nCassie will be played by Eva Kilian\n\nZach will be played by Michael Schilder\n\nJudy will be played by Brigid Boyle\n\nSunday November 17th at 14:00\n\nCassie will be played by Justyna Borowiecka\n\nZach will be played by Brian Ligthart\n\nJudy will be played by Rhijja Jansen\n\nVal will be played by Alissa Kos\n\nSunday November 17th at 19:00\n\nCassie will be played by Eva Kilian\n\nZach will be played by Michael Schilder\n\nJudy will be played by Brigid Boyle\n\nAL\n\nYorgos is a Leo, so please excuse the self indulgence that’s about to follow. He studied Architecture, yet he doesn’t consider himself technical enough to be an Architect. During those years, he also completed his studies in classical singing but soon realised he doesn’t take himself seriously enough to be an Opera singer. Originally from Greece, he moved to the Netherlands a few years ago after an early mid-life crisis, to bring some sass and drama to Amsterdam(a). Now that he has finally settled here, he is using his singing talents to work on an electronic music project, a big departure from his operatic background. Outside his artistic endeavors, he is a Creative Content Designer for a perfume company, so despite the sweat during the dance rehearsals, he will always smell nice. A Chorus Line will mark his debut in the Dutch musical scene, although he was a fierce Catherine of Aragon in the HEA musical bootcamp of SIX - or at least, that’s what he thinks.\n\nBEBE\n\nMahila is a twenty-two year old actor, singer and performer. Originally from Luxembourg, she graduated from a Performing Arts Bachelors in England, before moving to Amsterdam and work as a freelance performer. You might have seen Mahila in past HEA's productions: Mona in \"Chicago\", or Chloe in \"Be More Chill\". Mahila has also been releasing her own music \"Mæhila\" and plays shows in Amsterdam. Interested in following her career? check out her instagram: @m88hila\n\nBEBE U/S\n\nYara is a Neuroscientist who spends pretty much all her out of office time working on her big bold, and, small simple dreams (which are both equally important and fun). So instead of listing shows she has done she’d like to take this space and encourage you to take a moment and think of your own big or small dreams and go take action on them. Enjoy the ride and be kind, that’s all.\n\nBOBBY\n\nAntonio is Portuguese born in Brazil and has been on stage since he was 4.
