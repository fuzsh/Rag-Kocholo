        "text": "What if I told you that I know the outcome of your life and where you will end up before you even know it? Wouldn’t you be scared? See for a regular person who has a supporting family around them this question will almost feel almost like a death sentence. Nobody wants anyone to judge them before they even go through life on what they will end up being.\n\nThe movie, Glory, tells a story of the 54th regiment of Massachusetts journey in the Civil War. The 54th regiment was the first group of freed African Americans who volunteered to fight in the Union army. The film describes the journey of these brave men as they face prejudice to fight in the Union army and how they sacrificed their lives to fight for the cause of freedom. The film captures the heroic acts of the 54th regiment of black soldiers and their leader Colonel Robert Shaw.\n\nSinging in the Rain and A Clockwork Orange are both Classical Hollywood films. However, singing in the Rain closely follows what classical Hollywood film is supposed to be and A Clockwork Orange definitely tests the idea. Classical Hollywood Cinema is a type of traditional studio based style of making films in both the sound and silent periods. The directors of these types of films want you to simply watch and not worry about why the characters are doing what they’re doing. They want you to enjoy what you’re watching. They are also filmed with a sort of structure in the beginning the characters are all introduced to the viewers. There are then complications or conflict added to the plot. Then the resolution occurs where the conflict of the film has a confrontation and the protagonist ways his or her options. Finally, all major conflicts and issues in the film are resolved and generally the protagonist lives happily ever after. While the protagonists live happily ever after the antagonists of the films are punished from their actions throughout the film.\n\nNathanial Ayers portrayed the “textbook” diagnosis of schizophrenia appropriately throughout the movie. During The Soloist, Nathanial experienced hallucinations and delusions. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia can experience symptoms. Nathanial would hear voices inside of his mind, telling him he was not talented enough to perform at Julliard. Nathanial also had delusional thoughts about his family trying to poison and kill him. There are positive and negative symptoms related to schizophrenia (Reed, 2014). Nathanial displayed signs of more positive symptoms of schizophrenia rather than negative symptoms. Nathanial would get overly excited about Beethoven and classical music. When Nathanial talked about\n\nChoosing the soundtrack for a movie is another difficult task that a director has to do because they have to find a perfect song or an instrumental track that will fit or compliment the scene that they are editing. The soundtrack of a movie is also a guaranteed way of effecting the emotions of the audience members. As a result, directors spend a great deal of time in choosing the right soundtrack for the movie. They want to make sure that they target the correct emotions for each scene. The sequence of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” featured many different sounds; such as, speech, music and sound effects.\n\nWhen thinking of a specific type of dance, the vast majorities of the time people generally relate and direct the art form to a certain type of culture or race. As times develop and cultures start to merge, people tend to try and get to understand other diversities. This happens especially when we look at various forms of dance, where the people of origin are no longer the only ones who strictly perform it. Shown in the movies “Save the Last Dance” and “Take the Lead” both show a great deal of racial status and stereotypes involving dance, where the minorities try their best to fit in. Proving themselves by showing how they can adapt to other cultures by the flow and movement of their bodies. Both show a great understanding on how people of different races can be brought together by something most people can relate to, dance. To what extent does race inform the dancing as portrayed in the films “Save the Last Dance” (2001) and “Take the Lead” (2006)? To support the following argument stated above, there are several sources that will be implemented throughout the essay found within the dance community (journals, articles and books).\n\nRichard Linklater’s Boyhood leaves the audience questioning, asking, and wanting more. The entirety of the film is a recollection of memories and experiences throughout the course of Mason’s childhood. Overall Boyhood is like an unsolved puzzle with missing pieces that aren’t enough to solve the puzzle. The entire movie is questionable and has so many gaps in-between each memory that there really is no plot. Since there isn’t a plot it makes you question if it is really about boyhood, about family, maybe Mason’s childhood, or girlhood. Certain questions begin to formulate like, why doesn’t Linklater use the typical format of storytelling during Mason’s childhood? How come we never know what happened between Oliva and Mason Sr? Why doesn’t\n\nThe musical film has always held a special place for me. From my time as a drama student in high school, my eyes have been opened to the amazing world of the musical and especially the musical film. The musical film is a film genre in which the characters sing songs that are integrated into the overall story. Since musicals first began in theaters, musical films usually contain similar elements. These elements often simulate that there is a live audience watching. In a sense, the film viewers become the audience members, at a theater production, as the actor performs directly to them. Due to the popularity of musicals in the theater, the style was quickly brought over into film. In 1927, the musical film genre began\n\nMusic plays a critical role in the narrative films as it is important technique that filmmakers use to support the narrative and influence the way that the viewer interacts, responds and interprets the events as they unfold. The godfather, which is one of all time Hollywood movies, represents a good use of music that succeeded in supporting the dramatic events that take place in the movie. Moreover, both diegetic and non-diegetic music in the godfather movie are used to achieve the overall purpose by using the different principles and functions of film music that range from setting the mood of the viewer to providing continuity within the movie. In this essay, we will take part of the godfather movie in which we can observe and analyse the\n\nIn the movies, there are a number of factors that will impact the quality of the film and the story. This is because producers and directors are using different techniques that will enhance their ability to entertain. The Sound of Music is taking numerous ideas and is integrating them together. To fully understand what is happening, there will be an examination of the film and various concepts. This will be accomplished by focusing on: the storytelling, acting, cinematography, editing, sound, style / directing, impact of the film on society / vice versa, genre, application of at least one approach and overall textual themes. Together, these elements will highlight the effects of the film and how it has influenced others inside the industry.\n\nA musical film is a genre of movie where songs sung by characters are added into the storyline, occasionally complemented by choreography. The musical numbers in these films do not always develop the plot and characters, but they do give the films a more exciting quality. The primary difference between musical theatre and film musicals is the use of extravagant scenery that would be extraordinarily unreasonable for a stage performance. While making movies, the individuals involved have the luxury of being able to shoot multiple takes and have the time to move backgrounds around or change their entire location. Stage performances, on the other hand, must have scenery that can be easily and efficiently moved on and offstage when it is needed. In order to be able to thoroughly comprehend this relatively recent- in the grand scheme of things- form of entertainment, one should understand the history behind these musical films, be aware of some of the “big names” that are well-known, and recognize major titles that revolutionized musical film forever (Scaruffi, P., 2005).\n\nA Bollywood movie is incomplete without music. They are quite different from Hollywood movies when it comes to introduction of music in a movie. In most Hollywood movies, the songs are played in the background to bring out the intensity of the situation presented. Music, in Hollywood, is seen as a catalyst to the emotions that the scene is intended to evoke. However, in Bollywood, music’s to facilities the plot line of the movie. It is not seen\n\nThe importance of music in movies is highly regarded for manipulating the viewer’s emotions and helping them immerse into the story. Music is one of the prime elements in cinema. Without it a movie would feel dull and unexciting. There are three elements in a movie: one is acting, the second is picture, and the third one is music. It is a holy trinity; if incomplete, there would be a lack of sensation and excitement. Both acting and picture can stand independently from one another, but music is the one that makes the movie memorable."
