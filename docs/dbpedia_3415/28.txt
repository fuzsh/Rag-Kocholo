Laugh Now, Cry Later is Ice Cube's first album since from 2000. In the meantime a CD of his group , but it sometimes seemed that Ice Cube paid more attention to his acting career than to making music. Laugh Now, Cry Later can therefore safely be called a comeback album. And the rapper who managed to shock America in the late eighties with the group NWA and solo albums such as (1990) and (1991)â€¦ proves that it has lost none of its strength. Ice Cube still manages to let the anger and energy in his raps flow, he spits the lyrics into his microphone. In addition, he always knows how to give the well-known gangsta rap subjects a political connotation, which distinguishes him from most of his colleagues. Ice Cube has not lost its status yet.
