        "text": "Just a few weeks after unloading their new joint album, The Voice of the Heroes, Lil Baby has announced plans to hit the road with Lil Durk.\n\nOn Monday (June 21), Lil Baby announced The Back Outside Tour, a 23-date tour that will see Durkio appear as the special guest. The trek is all set to begin on Sept. 1 before ending on Oct. 15. With sizable solo catalogs and the chance to perform tracks from their new joint album, the Lil Baby and Lil Durk tour should be exactly what their fans were looking for.\n\nThe Back Outside Tour seems like an extra-appropriate tour on a variety of fronts. On one level, Lil Baby has seen his stock shoot through the roof over the last year-and-a-half, with his guest verses being highly sought after and his solo drops being special events for fans everywhere. His most recent album, My Turn, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart when it was released in February 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Durkio has seen a massive career resurgence. His most recent solo album, The Voice, has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Meanwhile, his 2020 guest appearance on Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later” earned him the No. 5 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, giving him his highest chart appearance to date.\n\nOn another level, of course, the tour feels welcomed because, after months of being held captive by the COVID-19 pandemic, fans can finally go outside and enjoy live events like plays, sports and…concerts like the ones Lil Baby and Durk will be putting up this coming fall. With all that in mind, it’s hard to think of a more spot-on title.
