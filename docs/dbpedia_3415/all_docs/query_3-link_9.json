        "text": "Lil Durk and J. Cole have finally dropped their collab “All My Life.” This is the first time the two rappers have been on a song together. Durk admitted that Cole bodied him on the song, which is a rarity with his features.\n\n“He smoked my a– on that one, for one — barely,” Smurk said when asked about his experience working with the Dreamville boss, per Complex. “That barely happens. But shout out to J. Cole, shout out to [Dr.] Luke, we made it happen.”\n\nLeading up to the record, Durkio sat down with XXL about how his first collab with Cole came about.\n\n“We were just trying to figure out, like, what’s the right person to put on it,” Durk said of the Dr. Luke-produced track. “‘Cause it’s one of those songs where if it’s not the right person to do the second verse… I feel like Cole can bring the energy that I’m looking for to it. So, if it wasn’t J. Cole, it’d be [Kanye], but Ye, he tucked away somewhere.”\n\nRELATED: Lil Durk Says He's Been Blackballed\n\nThe song will be on Durk’s upcoming album Almost Healed (The Chicago rapper has since changed the title of his LP from The Voice 2.0). He explained the reason behind the name change in a recent interview.\n\n“At first it was The Voice 2.0 and I just figured that going through a lot of stuff and people thinking they know me, thinking I’m going through a lot of that that I wasn’t going through and I was just having a basic conversation…[and] I’m like, ‘Man, I’m almost healed for me just to come back outside,” he said per HipHopDX.\n\n“You could be almost healed from any situation which from a broken heart, a broken arm, a broken leg, anything. You know what I’m saying? So that name alone, it just ring bells. It’s self-explanatory. It’s just like, everything you’ve been through is you can see it, you can feel it, you can hear it.”\n\nThe album is expected to arrive at the end of the month (May 26).\n\n“Almost healed the album may26th ahhhhh haaaaaaaaaa [black heart emoji],” he wrote in the caption on Instagram revealing the cover art of him bandaged and bloody.\n\nWatch the video to “All My Life” below:\n\nLil Durk: 12 Of His Best Songs Ranked\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
