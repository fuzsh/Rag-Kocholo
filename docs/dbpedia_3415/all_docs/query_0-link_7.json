Haven't heard Lil' Jon's yet. Some actually seem engaged and even knowledgeable about chart facts as well as the music, while others barely seem to know or care what they're talking about.\n\nThat said, this is the third of the last four weeks when AT40's been guest hosted, which is a bit much. Not sure what confluence of events in Ryan's life or schedule are resulting in this (American Idol auditions? Vacation? Sick day?) but I hope he's back next week.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nalso i think this is the first time i've heard the robot lady or whatever say \"number 40\" lol. i don't think i've ever heard that before\n\nThey used to do that every week when I discovered the show in 2015, but they got rid of it in March 2016. (I still vividly remember being confused as hell the week they got rid of it because back then I listened to the entire show every week lol.)\n\nPost by Fire on\n\n@nonameneeded said:\n\nalso i think this is the first time i've heard the robot lady or whatever say \"number 40\" lol. i don't think i've ever heard that before\n\nThey used to do that every week when I discovered the show in 2015, but they got rid of it in March 2016.
