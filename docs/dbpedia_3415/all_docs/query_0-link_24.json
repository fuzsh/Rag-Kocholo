        "text": "Ice Cube’s biography reads like a blueprint for success in music and film. Born O’Shea Jackson on June 15, 1969, in Los Angeles, California, Ice Cube rose from the streets of South Central to become a defining force in the hip-hop industry with seminal albums like AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted and The Predator. His transition to the screen included standout roles in Boyz n the Hood and the Friday series, further cementing his legacy as a multifaceted entertainer.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn O’Shea Jackson on June 15, 1969, in Los Angeles, Ice Cube grew up in a household nurtured by his parents, Doris, a hospital clerk, and Hosea Jackson, a machinist who also worked as a UCLA groundskeeper. He shared his childhood with an older brother and a half-sister, who tragically lost her life when Cube was just 12 years old. Notably, Cube is related to fellow rappers Del tha Funky Homosapien and Kam, marking a family tree with deep musical roots. He was raised on Van Wick Street in the Westmont section of South Los Angeles, a neighborhood that would heavily influence his artistic voice.\n\nAttending George Washington Preparatory High School, Ice Cube began to craft his skills in rap in the ninth grade, inspired by a challenge from a friend named Kiddo during a typewriting class—a contest Cube won convincingly. During this period, he acquired his iconic stage name; his brother once humorously threatened to freeze him into an “ice cube,” a nickname that evidently stuck.\n\nDon’t worry about being a star, worry about doing good work, and all that will come to you.\n\nIce Cube\n\nCube’s education continued at William Howard Taft High School in the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles, where he faced a daily 40-mile bus journey from his high-crime neighborhood. This commute marked a significant transition period in his life, juxtaposing his home environment with his educational aspirations.\n\nIn the fall of 1987, following the success of his early rap songs with N.W.A., Cube moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to attend the Phoenix Institute of Technology. There, he earned a diploma in architectural drafting in 1988. Returning to Los Angeles with new skills, he rejoined N.W.A. but maintained his architectural drafting as a backup career option. This dual focus showcased his pragmatic approach to his burgeoning music career, grounding his artistic ambitions with practical skills.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly Career\n\nIn 1986, at just 16 years old, Ice Cube began to make his mark in the music world, starting with the trio C.I.A. His talents quickly propelled him into the spotlight, and he soon became a founding member of the influential rap group N.W.A. Ice Cube was not only N.W.A‘s lead rapper but also served as the main ghostwriter for their seminal 1988 album, Straight Outta Compton. Despite his success with the group, a financial disagreement led to his departure at the dawn of 1990.\n\n1990 was pivotal for Ice Cube as he released his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted. This album showcased his lyrical prowess and featured collaborations with the rap group Da Lench Mob, highlighting his role as a leader in the rap community. Additionally, Ice Cube played a significant role in mentoring and developing the rapper Yo Yo, further establishing his influence in the hip-hop industry.\n\n1986: C.I.A.\n\nIn 1986, a young Ice Cube teamed up with his friend Sir Jinx to form the rap group C.I.A., making a name for themselves performing at lively parties hosted by Dr. Dre. By this time, Dr. Dre was already well-established in the music scene as a member of the World Class Wreckin’ Cru since 1984, known for their electro rap performances and recordings. Recognizing Cube’s writing talent, Dre enlisted his help to pen the Wreckin’ Cru’s hit track Cabbage Patch. Their collaboration extended beyond C.I.A., as Cube and Dre formed a duo called Stereo Crew, releasing the 12-inch record She’s a Skag on Epic Records in 1986.\n\nThe following year, C.I.A.’s presence in the rap scene grew with the release of the Dr. Dre-produced single My Posse. Around the same time, the Wreckin’ Cru drew crowds at the Eve After Dark nightclub just outside Compton in Los Angeles County. Here, Dr. Dre showcased his DJ skills while Ice Cube took the microphone, often delivering parodic versions of popular songs. Notably, Cube’s parody of Run-DMC’s My Adidas with his rendition called My Penis stirred controversy, leading nightclub co-owner and Wreckin’ leader Alonzo Williams to intervene, concerned about the impact on the venue’s reputation. This early phase of Cube’s career was marked by a blend of humor and creativity and the beginnings of a distinctive voice defining his music and influence.\n\n1986–1989: Early Music Career with N.W.A\n\nIn the dynamic world of hip-hop during the mid-1980s, a young Ice Cube began to make his mark. At 16, Cube penned his first song, selling it to Eric Wright, better known as Eazy-E. Eazy-E was in the process of establishing Ruthless Records and forming the iconic group N.W.A. in Compton, California. Although Cube hails from South Central Los Angeles, he became the only core member of N.W.A. not originally from Compton.\n\nThe group hit the ground running with the song “Boyz-n-the-Hood,” which Cube wrote. Produced by Dr. Dre and performed by Eazy-E, the track was pivotal in defining the gangsta rap genre in California. As N.W.A. began to rise in fame, Eazy-E focused on expanding the group, which soon included MC Ren. Cube’s lyrical prowess was instrumental in N.W.A’s debut album, Straight Outta Compton, released in August 1988, where he wrote a significant portion of Dre’s and nearly all of Eazy’s lyrics.\n\nHowever, by late 1989, disputes over financial compensation arose. Cube was particularly concerned about his earnings and Jerry Heller’s management style. Despite his significant contributions, including writing most of the lyrics for Eazy-E’s debut album Eazy-Duz-It, Cube felt under-compensated, receiving $32,000. When a contract presented by Heller in 1989 failed to confirm his official status as an N.W.A. member, Cube decided to leave the group and its label in December of that year. This led to a lawsuit against Heller, which was eventually settled out of court.\n\nThe departure was not without controversy. Members of N.W.A. expressed their displeasure through their music, targeting Cube in tracks on the 1990 EP 100 Miles and Runnin’ and on their 1991 album Niggaz4Life.\n\n1989–1993: Launching a Solo Career\n\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube began his solo career by recording his debut album AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted in New York, collaborating with Public Enemy’s production powerhouse, the Bomb Squad. Released in May 1990, the album quickly became a hit, significantly boosting rap’s profile in mainstream music. Despite its success, the album was not without controversy, drawing criticism for its themes of misogyny and racism. Nonetheless, it marked a bold assertion of black nationalism and delved deep into the ideology of black struggle.\n\nIce Cube also made significant strides in the industry by appointing Yo-Yo, a prominent female rapper featured on the album, as the head of his record label. He produced her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. In 1990, Cube also released the EP Kill At Will, which earned critical acclaim and became rap’s first EP to achieve Platinum status.\n\nHis next album, Death Certificate, released in 1991, was known for its incisive focus and heightened controversy. The album, accused of promoting anti-white, antisemitic, and misogynist sentiments, was divided into two parts: the Death Side, depicting current societal conditions, and the Life Side, proposing a vision for the future. One of the tracks, “No Vaseline,” directly responded to insults from N.W.A.‘s recent releases and included contentious lyrics about the group’s manager, Jerry Heller. Despite the disputes it sparked, Death Certificate expanded Cube’s audience further, and in 1992, he joined the Lollapalooza tour, broadening his influence.\n\nCube’s third studio album, The Predator, was released in November 1992 amidst the backdrop of the Los Angeles riots. The album, which opened with the track “Wicked,” referencing the riots, achieved an unprecedented feat by debuting at No. 1 on both the R&B/hip-hop and pop charts. Hits like “It Was a Good Day” and “Check Yo Self” became anthems of the era, with their interconnected music videos capturing widespread attention. Despite its commercial success, with over three million copies sold in the US, The Predator marked the peak of Cube’s rap career, as his subsequent works never quite reached the heights of his early albums.\n\nDuring this prolific period, Cube also featured on various artists’ tracks. In 1992, he appeared on Del the Funky Homosapien’s debut album, I Wish My Brother George Was Here, and produced Da Lench Mob’s Guerillas in tha Mist. He continued his collaborative efforts in 1993, working with Kam and joining forces with Ice-T on the track “Last Wordz” from 2Pac’s album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.. These collaborations underscored his role as a central figure in the evolution of hip-hop during the early 90s.\n\n1993-1998: Lethal Injection and Exploring New Sounds\n\nIn late 1993, Ice Cube released his fourth studio album, Lethal Injection. The album saw Cube experiment with the G-funk style, a trend spearheaded by Dr. Dre. While Lethal Injection did not garner critical acclaim, it produced successful singles such as “Really Doe,” “Bop Gun (One Nation),” “You Know How We Do It,” and “What Can I Do?” Despite the hits, this album marked a turning point in which Ice Cube began to lose his core rap audience.\n\nPost-Lethal Injection, Cube shifted his focus towards films and producing music for other artists, including Da Lench Mob, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, and Kausion. In 1994, he reunited musically with former N.W.A groupmate, Dr. Dre, for the first time since leaving the group, dissolved after Dre’s departure in 1991. Their collaboration resulted in the track “Natural Born Killaz,” featured on the Murder Was The Case soundtrack released by Dre’s then-new label, Death Row Records.\n\nIn 1995, feeling marginalized by the East Coast-dominated media amid rap’s bicoastal rivalry, Ice Cube formed the trio Westside Connection with Mack 10 and WC. Their debut album, Bow Down (1996), encapsulated the group’s aim to celebrate West Coast pride and address their underrepresentation. Hits like “Bow Down” and “Gangstas Make the World Go ‘Round” echoed their regional allegiance, earning the album a Platinum certification by the end of the year. The Westside Connection found themselves briefly embroiled in a feud with rapper Common over perceived slights against West Coast rap in his song “I Used to Love H.E.R.,” but the dispute was resolved amicably in 1997.\n\nDuring this period, Ice Cube also ventured beyond rap. In 1997, he collaborated with rock icons David Bowie and Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor on a remix of Bowie’s “I’m Afraid of Americans.” The following year, Cube was featured on Korn’s song “Children of the Korn” and participated in their Family Values Tour 1998, further broadening his artistic range and audience.\n\n1998-2006: Musical Evolution and Collaboration\n\nIn November 1998, Ice Cube released War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc), his fifth solo album, marking a significant moment in his music career. This was followed by the sixth album, War & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc), in 2000. These albums were notable for featuring collaborations with members of Westside Connection as well as a reunion with his former N.W.A colleague, Dr. Dre and MC Ren. Additionally, the band Korn, returning a favor, appeared on the track “Fuck Dying” from Vol. 1. Despite the star-studded collaborations, many fans felt that these albums did not quite live up to the quality of his earlier work.\n\nIn 2000, Cube joined a major hip-hop tour, Up in Smoke, alongside prominent artists Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Snoop Dogg. The tour showcased a powerhouse of rap talent across venues.\n\nCube’s collaborations continued into the new millennium; in 2002, he contributed to British DJ Paul Oakenfold’s solo debut album, Bunkka, on the track “Get Em Up.” The following year, Westside Connection released their second album, Terrorist Threats, in 2003. The album received favorable critical reviews and included the hit single “Gangsta Nation,” featuring Nate Dogg, which became popular on radio. Despite the success, internal conflicts arose, mainly related to Cube’s growing focus on his film career, which limited the group’s touring schedule. This tension led to the disbandment of Westside Connection in 2005.\n\nIn 2004, Cube was featured on the track “Real Nigga Roll Call” by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, leaders of the crunk subgenre at the time. This collaboration highlighted Cube’s adaptability and willingness to explore different styles within the hip-hop genre, maintaining his relevance in the rapidly evolving music landscape.\n\nIn 2006, Ice Cube launched his seventh solo album, Laugh Now, Cry Later, which saw impressive sales, with 144,000 units moved in its opening week. The album featured the lead single “Why We Thugs,” produced by Lil Jon and Scott Storch. That October, Cube was celebrated at VH1’s Annual Hip Hop Honors, performing “Why We Thugs” and “Go to Church.” He then embarked on the global Straight Outta Compton Tour with rapper WC from Westside Connection, captivating audiences across America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.\n\nIn September 2007, Cube’s influence on film soundtracks was highlighted in the compilation album In the Movies. The following year, Cube released his eighth studio album, Raw Footage, which included hits like “Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It” and “Do Ya Thang.” 2008 also saw him contribute to Tech N9ne’s “Blackboy” and The Game’s “State of Emergency.”\n\nA passionate fan of the NFL’s Raiders, Cube expressed his support musically by releasing the tribute song “Raider Nation” in October 2009. He also graced the stage at the Gathering of the Juggalos in 2009 and returned for the 2011 event.\n\nTruth is the ultimate power. When the truth comes around, all the lies have to run and hide.\n\nIce Cube\n\nSeptember 28, 2010, marked the arrival of his ninth studio album, I Am the West. This album, which Cube described as taking a different direction from his previous work, was shaped by West Coast music stalwarts like DJ Quik, Dr. Dre, and E-A-Ski, as well as a reunion with Sir Jinx, his early collaborator from C.I.A. The album, featuring the single “I Rep That West,” debuted at number 22 on the Billboard 200, selling 22,000 copies in its first week. That same year, Cube signed new artist 7Tre The Ghost, showcasing his commitment to nurturing new talent.\n\nCube’s collaborations continued in 2011 with features on Daz Dillinger’s “Iz You Ready to Die” and DJ Quik’s “Boogie Till You Conk Out.” In 2012, he added a verse to a remix of Insane Clown Posse’s “Chris Benoit,” appearing on the album Mike E. Clark’s Extra Pop Emporium.\n\nFinally, in September 2012, during Pepsi’s NFL Anthems campaign, Cube released his second Raiders tribute, “Come and Get It,” further solidifying his status as a multi-faceted artist and avid sports fan.\n\n2012–Present: A New Era\n\nIn November 2012, Ice Cube tantalized fans with details about his tenth studio album, Everythang’s Corrupt. Coinciding with the 2012 elections, he released the politically charged title track, signaling a thematic focus aimed at political aficionados. However, the album’s journey to release was fraught with delays. A single from the album, “Sic Them Youngins on ‘Em,” appeared on iTunes on February 10, 2014, followed by a music video the next day. Despite releasing a few more songs, the album’s launch was postponed further, even beyond Cube’s involvement in the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton. Initially projected for a 2017 release, Everythang’s Corrupt finally debuted on December 7, 2018.\n\nIn 2014, Ice Cube collaborated with MC Ren on the remix “Rebel Music,” marking their first musical reunion since the N.W.A. get-together in 2000.\n\nBy 2020, Ice Cube had embarked on another significant venture, joining forces with fellow rappers Snoop Dogg, E-40, and Too Short to form the supergroup Mt. Westmore. The ensemble’s highly anticipated debut album was released on June 7, 2022, adding an exciting new chapter to Cube’s illustrious career.\n\nLooking forward, Ice Cube is set to captivate audiences in Canada with his Straight Into Canada tour, scheduled for early 2024. This tour represents another milestone in his enduring influence in the music industry, continuing to engage fans with his dynamic performances and enduring charisma.\n\nFilm and Television Career\n\nSince 1991, Ice Cube has showcased his acting talents in nearly 40 films, crossing genres from thrillers and action comedies to family-oriented series. Films like the 1992 thriller Trespass and the 1999 war comedy Three Kings have highlighted his range, blending intense action with sharp comedy. However, Ice Cube is perhaps best known for his roles in comedies, starring in the adult-oriented Friday franchise and family favorites like the Barbershop series.\n\nNarrative\n\nHis debut was in John Singleton’s pivotal 1991 film Boyz n the Hood, where he played the character Doughboy—a role that established him as a formidable actor. Following this, Cube appeared alongside Ice-T and Bill Paxton in the 1992 film Trespass and Charles Burnett’s 1995 drama The Glass Shield. Despite declining a role opposite Janet Jackson in Singleton’s 1993 romance Poetic Justice, which went to Tupac Shakur, Cube’s film career flourished.\n\nIn Singleton’s 1995 film Higher Learning, Cube played university student Fudge, a role that came with encouragement from Singleton himself, who believed Cube’s writing skills could translate well into filmmaking. This belief was proven correct when Cube co-wrote and starred in the 1995 comedy Friday. Friday was a commercial success, produced on a modest budget of $3.5 million, grossing $28 million worldwide and spawning two sequels, Next Friday and Friday After Next, released in 2000 and 2002, respectively.\n\nCube’s ventures into writing and directing emerged with his 1998 debut in The Players Club. He continued to take on diverse roles, starring in the critically acclaimed war comedy Three Kings in 1999 and action and comedy films like All About the Benjamins and Barbershop in the early 2000s.\n\nHis role in the film industry expanded with appearances in Barbershop 2, Torque, and the family comedy Are We There Yet?, along with its sequel. Ice Cube also replaced Vin Diesel in the action-packed XXX: State of the Union and later joined Diesel in the 2017 installment XXX: Return of Xander Cage. His comedic flair was displayed in the successful pairings with Kevin Hart for Ride Along and its sequel. In 2016, he returned for the third installment of the Barbershop series and starred in the comedy Fist Fight in 2017.\n\nIn recent events, Ice Cube was set to co-star with Jack Black in the comedy Stepdude, originally titled Oh Hell No. However, he exited the project in October 2021 after declining to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, a decision that reportedly cost him a $9 million payday. This move underscores Cube’s firm stance on personal and professional choices, regardless of financial implications.\n\nDocumentary and Television Production\n\nIn the realm of documentary filmmaking, Ice Cube has made significant contributions. In late 2005, he co-created the six-part documentary series Black. White., which aired on the cable network FX. The series explored racial perceptions and realities in America through an innovative social experiment, offering viewers a profound look at the complexities of race relations.\n\nIce Cube’s interest in blending cultural narratives with entertainment continued as he teamed up with basketball superstar LeBron James to pitch a one-hour special to ABC, focusing on James’s life. This project highlighted Cube’s knack for merging storytelling with the powerful backstories of other prominent figures.\n\nOn May 11, 2010, ESPN showcased Ice Cube’s directed documentary Straight Outta L.A.. This film delved into the cultural interplay among Los Angeles sociopolitics, the hip-hop scene, and the Raiders football team during the transformative 1980s and 1990s, reflecting Cube’s ongoing engagement with themes of identity and community within the urban cultural landscape.\n\nTransitioning to serial television, Ice Cube’s Are We There Yet? premiered on TBS on June 2, 2010. The series, featuring Terry Crews, centers on a family adjusting to life with a new stepfather. Its relatable premise and engaging humor led to the show’s renewal on August 16 for an additional 90 episodes, amounting to six seasons in total. Ice Cube has acknowledged the influence of Tyler Perry in paving the way for his successful transition to television comedy.\n\nAdditionally, demonstrating his versatility and broad appeal, Ice Cube appeared as a guest on the PBS children’s show Sesame Street in 2014, interacting with the beloved character Elmo. This appearance underscored his ability to connect with audiences of all ages, reinforcing his status as a versatile and culturally influential entertainer.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nReligion and Beliefs\n\nSince the early days of his career, Ice Cube’s life off-stage has been as impactful as his music. In 1990, a musical associate from Public Enemy introduced him to the Nation of Islam (NOI). Although he converted to Islam, Cube has clarified that he is not a member of the NOI despite aligning with some of its principles. One is black nationalism—a concept that resonates within the hip-hop community. Over the years, he has described his faith as guided by a personal conscience, calling himself a “natural Muslim” who values a direct relationship with God. His spiritual journey has been eclectic, expressing openness to various beliefs, and in 2012, he publicly supported same-sex marriage. By 2017, Cube articulated a fluid perspective on religion, suggesting he might explore different faiths throughout his life.\n\nFamily\n\nIce Cube has shared his life with Kimberly Woodruff since they married on April 26, 1992. The couple has five children, and their oldest son, O’Shea Jackson Jr., portrayed Ice Cube in the biographical film Straight Outta Compton. Cube has spoken about balancing his provocative musical persona with fatherhood, emphasizing the importance of teaching his children to critically assess violence in media. His family role expanded as he became a grandfather through his son O’Shea.\n\nPassion for Sports\n\nBeyond music and film, Ice Cube has indulged his passion for sports, launching the Big3 in 2017, a 3-on-3 basketball league featuring former NBA players. He is a fervent supporter of the Las Vegas Raiders, a loyalty that dates back to their time in Los Angeles, and a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Lakers. His affinity for these teams has been a constant in his public persona, intertwining with his cultural influence in promoting the Raiders’ image within hip-hop.\n\nControversies\n\nIce Cube’s career has not been without controversy, particularly concerning accusations of antisemitism and racism. In 1991, he faced criticism for endorsing The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, a book promoting contentious claims about the Atlantic slave trade. His album Death Certificate featured the track “No Vaseline,” which was criticized for its harsh language directed at former N.W.A member and their manager, Jerry Heller, used terms that sparked allegations of racism and antisemitism. Cube has consistently defended himself against these accusations, asserting that his focus is on being “pro-black” rather than anti-anyone else. In 2015, he regretted specific lyrics in “No Vaseline” that targeted Heller’s Jewish identity, clarifying that his critique was directed at Heller individually, not the Jewish community.\n\nIn 2020, Ice Cube came under fire again for sharing controversial content related to Louis Farrakhan and various antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media. He responded to the backlash by emphasizing his intent to be pro-black and dismissing the criticisms as “hype,” reiterating that he was merely expressing his truth. This ongoing dialogue around Ice Cube’s public statements and beliefs continues to evoke strong reactions and discussions about the intersection of celebrity, activism, and personal ideology.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio Albums\n\nAmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted (1990)\n\nDeath Certificate (1991)\n\nThe Predator (1992)\n\nLethal Injection (1993)\n\nWar & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc) (1998)\n\nWar & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc) (2000)\n\nLaugh Now, Cry Later (2006)\n\nRaw Footage (2008)\n\nI Am the West (2010)\n\nEverythang’s Corrupt (2018)\n\nFinal Reflections\n\nThe success story of Ice Cube is not just about a prolific music and acting career; it’s also a reflection of his ability to influence and reshape the cultural landscape.
