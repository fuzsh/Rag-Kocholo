        "text": "O'Shea Jackson (born June 15, 1969), better known by his stage name Ice Cube, is an American rapper, actor, and filmmaker. His lyrics on N.W.A's 1988 album Straight Outta Compton contributed to gangsta rap's widespread popularity. His solo albums of 1990 and 1991 consist of political rap. In 1991 and 1995, entering film, he starred in Boyz n the Hood and cocreated Friday.\n\nHe formed his first rap group called C.I.A. in 1986. In 1987, with Eazy-E and Dr. Dre, he formed a pioneering gangsta rap group, N.W.A. As its lead rapper, he wrote some of Dre's and most of Eazy's lyrics on Straight Outta Compton. A landmark that shaped West Coast rap's first identity apart from East Coast rap, this album introduced lyrics extremely violent, threatening to attack abusive police and innocent civilians alike, lyrics that redrew boundaries. Leaving N.W.A in late 1989 via monetary dispute with its management by Eazy-E and Jerry Heller, Cube teamed with New York artists and launched a solo rap career. His first two solo albums, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted in 1990 and Death Certificate in 1991, were critically acclaimed.\n\nHe entered cinema by playing Doughboy in director John Singleton's feature debut Boyz n the Hood, a 1991 drama, namesake of an 1987 rap song that Cube wrote. Cube cowrote and starred in the 1995 comedy film Friday, \"coarse and ribald,\" premising Friday sequels, reshaping his persona into friendly movie star. His directorial debut was a 1998 film, The Player's Club. By 2020, his acting roles include about 40 films, like the 1999 war comedy Three Kings, family comedies like the Barbershop series begun in 2002, and the Ride Along comedies near 2015. He was an executive producer of some of these, and of the 2015 biopic Straight Outta Compton, on N.W.A's story.\n\nIn 2010, while his family film Are We There Yet? was spun into a sitcom, sports network ESPN televised his documentary Straight Outta L.A., analyzing the sociopolitical backstory of gangsta rap's emergence and its finding early symbolism in Raiders football. In business, he launched a clothing line, Solo by Cube, and a 3-on-3 basketball league, Big3, mainly featuring retired NBA players.\n\nPersonal life and side ventures[]\n\nIce Cube as a senior in high school, 1987 Ice Cube was born on June 15, 1969, in Baldwin Hills, South Central Los Angeles, to Doris, a hospital clerk and custodian, and Hosea Jackson, a machinist and UCLA groundskeeper. He has an older brother, and they had a half-sister who was murdered when Cube was 12. He grew up on Van Wick Street in South Central.\n\nIn ninth grade at George Washington Preparatory High School, in Los Angeles, Cube began writing raps once challenged by a friend to do so in typewriting class. \"Kiddo\" lost. Explaining his own stage name, Cube implicates his own elder brother: \"He threatened to slam me into a freezer and pull me out when I was an ice cube. I just started using that name, and it just caught on.\"\n\nCube also attended William Howard Taft High School, in Woodland Hills, California. Soon after he wrote and recorded a few locally successful rap songs with N.W.A, he left for Arizona to enroll in the Phoenix Institute of Technology in the fall 1987 semester. In 1988, with a diploma in architectural drafting, he returned to the Los Angeles area and rejoined N.W.A, but kept a career in architecture drafting as a backup plan.\n\nIn 1990, he formed his own record label, Street Knowledge, whereby a musical associate via the rap group Public Enemy introduced him to the Nation of Islam (NOI). Ice Cube converted to Islam. Although denying membership in the NOI, whose ideology often rebukes whites and especially Jews, he readily adopted its ideology of black nationalism, familiar to the rap community. Still, he has claimed to heed his own conscience as a \"natural Muslim, 'cause it's just me and God.\" Questioned in 2017, he said, in part, that he thinks \"religion is stupid.\" He estimated, \"I'm gonna live a long life, and I might change religions three or four times before I die. I'm on the Islam tip—but I'm on the Christian tip, too. I'm on the Buddhist tip as well. Everyone has something to offer to the world.\"\n\nYet in 2020, he was accused of a \"long, disturbing history of anti-Semitism.\" This traces to his 1991 song \"No Vaseline,\" which calls N.W.A's members slurs of blacks and calls N.W.A's manager Jerry Heller a \"white man,\" \"white boy,\" \"Jew,\" \"devil,\" \"white Jew,\" and \"cracker.\" In 2015, Ice Cube expressed regret at including the word Jew, as the attacks are on Heller, not \"the whole Jewish race.\" That same year, he was sued for—but has denied—ordering a rabbi's assault. And in June 2020, some of Ice Cube's Twitter posts—promoting NOI leader Louis Farrakhan, an allegedly antisemitic mural, and associated conspiracy theories—triggered wide accusations of antisemitism. Suggesting himself \"just pro-Black,\" not \"anti anybody,\" Cube dismissed \"the hype,\" and professed \"telling my truth.\"\n\nOn April 26, 1992, Ice Cube married Kimberly Woodruff, born September 1970. As of 2017, they have four children together. In 2005, asked about the balance between his music and his parenting, Cube discussed counseling his children to appraise the violence depicted in all media, not just in music lyrics. In the 2015 biopic Straight Outta Compton, his own son, O'Shea Jr., portrayed him. In a 2016 interview, he offered his favorite movie as the 1975 film Jaws, and his favorite among his own songs as \"It Was a Good Day.\" Commercially, Cube has endorsed Coors Light beer and St. Ides malt liquor, and licensed a clothing line, Solo by Cube. And in 2017, he launched Big3, a 3-on-3 basketball league starring former NBA players. Its first season started that June with eight teams, an eight-week regular season, playoffs, and a championship game.\n\nMusic career[]\n\nIn 1986 at age 16, Ice Cube began rapping in the trio C.I.A., but soon joined the newly formed rap group N.W.A. He was N.W.A's lead rapper and main ghostwriter on its official debut album, 1988's Straight Outta Compton. Via financial dispute, he left by the start of 1990. During 1990, his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, found him also leading a featured rap group, Da Lench Mob.\n\nMeanwhile, he helped develop the rapper Yo Yo. After Cube's fourth solo album, Lethal Injection in 1993, he focused on films and producing albums of other rappers, including Da Lench Mob, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, and Kausion. In 1996, Cube joined Mack 10 and WC in a side trio, the Westside Connection. Interpreting rapper Common's song \"I Used to Love H.E.R.\" as a diss of West Coast rap, Cube briefly feuded with him, but they resolved amicably in 1997.\n\nIce Cube's rap audience never regained the prominence of his first three albums. Yet amid his many features and brief collaborations, September 2007 brought In the Movies, a compilation album of Ice Cube songs on soundtracks. Also, as a fan of the NFL football team the Raiders, Cube released in October 2009 a tribute song, \"Raider Nation.\" And in September 2012, in Pepsi's NFL Anthems campaign, Cube released his second Raiders anthem, \"Come and Get It.\"\n\nC.I.A. (circa 1986)[]\n\nWith friend Sir Jinx, Ice Cube formed the rap group C.I.A., and performed at parties hosted by Dr. Dre. Since 1984, Dre was a member of a popular DJ crew, the World Class Wreckin' Cru, which by 1985 was also performing and recording electro rap. Dre had Cube help write the Wreckin Cru's hit song \"Cabbage Patch.\" Dre also joined Cube on a side project, a duo called Stereo Crew, which made a 12-inch record, \"She's a Skag,\" released on Epic Records in 1986.\n\nIn 1987, C.I.A. released the Dr. Dre-produced single \"My Posse.\" Meanwhile, the Wreckin' Cru's home base was the Eve After Dark nightclub, about a quarter of a mile outside of the city Compton in Los Angeles county. While Dre was on the turntable, Ice Cube would rap, often parodying other artists' songs. In one instance, Cube's rendition was \"My Penis,\" parodying Run-DMC's \"My Adidas.\" In 2015, the nightclub's co-owner and Wreckin' leader Alonzo Williams would recall feeling his reputation damaged by this and asking it not to be repeated.\n\nN.W.A (1986–1989)[]\n\nMain article: N.W.A Poster for one of N.W.A's first concerts at a Compton skating rink, 1988 At 16, Cube sold his first song to Eric Wright, soon dubbed Eazy-E, who was forming Ruthless Records and the musical team N.W.A, based in Compton, California. Himself from South Central Los Angeles, Cube would be N.W.A's only core member not born in Compton.\n\nUpon the success of the song \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\"—written by Cube, produced by Dre, and rapped by Eazy-E, helping establish gangsta rap in California—Eazy focused on developing N.W.A, which soon gained MC Ren. Cube wrote some of Dre's and nearly all of Eazy's lyrics on N.W.A's official debut album, Straight Outta Compton, released in August 1988. Yet by late 1989, Cube questioned his compensation and N.W.A's management by Jerry Heller.\n\nCube had also written much of Eazy-E's debut album, Eazy-Duz-It. He had received total pay of $32,000, and the contract that Heller presented in 1989 did not confirm that he was officially an N.W.A member. After leaving the group and its label, Cube sued Heller, and the lawsuit was later settled out of court. In response, N.W.A members attacked Cube on the 1990 EP 100 Miles and Runnin', and on N.W.A's next and final album, Ni*gaz4Life, in 1991.\n\nCube solo (1990–)[]\n\nAmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (1990)[]\n\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, in New York with iconic rap group Public Enemy's production team, the Bomb Squad. Arriving in May 1990, it was an instant hit, further swelling rap's mainstream integration. Controversial nonetheless, it drew accusations of misogyny and racism. The album introduces Ice Cube's affirmation of black nationalism and ideology of black struggle.\n\nCube appointed Yo-Yo, a female rapper and guest on the album, to the head his record label, and helped produce her debut album, Make Way for the Motherlode. Also in 1990, Cube followed up with an EP—Kill At Will—critically acclaimed, and rap's first EP certified Platinum.\n\nDeath Certificate (1991)[]\n\nHis second album Death Certificate was released in 1991. The album thought to as more focused, yet even more controversial, triggering accusations of anti-white, antisemitic, and misogynist content. The album was split into two themes: the Death Side, \"a vision of where we are today,\" and the Life Side, \"a vision of where we need to go.\" The track \"No Vaseline\" scathingly retorts insults directed at him by N.W.A's 1990 EP and 1991 album, which call him a traitor. But besides calling for hanging Eazy-E as a \"house ni*ga,\" the track blames N.W.A's manager Jerry Heller for exploiting the group, mentions that he is a Jew, and calls for his murder. Ice Cube contended that he mentioned Heller's ethnicity merely incidentally, not to premise attack, but as news media mention nonwhite assailants' races. The track \"Black Korea,\" also deemed racist, was also thought foresee the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Broadening his audience, though, Cube toured with Lollapalooza in 1992. A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska\n\nThe Predator (1992)[]\n\nCube's third album, The Predator, arrived in November 1992. Referring to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, the \"Wicked\" sing opens, \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel.\" The Predator was the first album ever to debut at No. 1 on both the R&B/hip-hop and pop charts. Singles include \"It Was a Good Day\" and \"Check Yo Self,\" songs having a \"two-part\" music video. Generally drawing critical praise, the album is his most successful commercially, over three million copies sold in the US. After this album, Cube's rap audience severely diminished.\n\nLethal Injection (1993)[]\n\nCube's fourth album, Lethal Injection, came out in late 1993. Here, Cube borrows from the G-Funk sound then led by Dr. Dre's album The Chronic, itself released in December 1992. Although not received well by critics, the album brought successful singles, including \"Really Doe\", \"Bop Gun (One Nation)\", \"You Know How We Do It,\" and \"What Can I Do?\" After this album, Ice Cube effectively lost his rap audience.\n\nWar & Peace Vol. 1 & 2 (1998 & 2000)[]\n\nIn 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc). The delayed sixth album, Volume 2, arrived in 2000. These albums feature the Westside Connection and a reunion with his old N.W.A members Dr. Dre and MC Ren. Many fans maintained that these two albums, especially the second, were below his earlier work. In 2000, Cube also joined Dr. Dre, Eminem & Snoop Dogg for the Up in Smoke Tour.\n\nLaugh Now, Cry Later (2006)[]\n\nIn 2006, Cube released his seventh solo album, Laugh Now, Cry Later, selling 144,000 units in the first week. Lil Jon and Scott Storch produced the lead single, \"Why We Thugs.\" In October, Ice Cube was honored at VH1's Annual Hip Hop Honors, and performed it and also the track \"Go to Church.\" Cube soon toured globally in the Straight Outta Compton Tour—accompanied by rapper WC from the Westside Connection—playing in America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.\n\n[]\n\nCube's eighth studio album, Raw Footage, arrived on August 19, 2008, yielding the singles \"Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It\" and \"Do Ya Thang\".\n\nI Am the West (2010)[]\n\nOn September 28, 2010, his ninth solo album, I Am the West, arrived with, Cube says, a direction different from any one of his other albums. Its producers include West Coast veterans like DJ Quik, Dr. Dre, E-A-Ski, and, after nearly 20 years, again Cube's onetime C.I.A groupmate Sir Jinx. Offering the single \"I Rep That West,\" the album debuted at #22 on the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200, and sold 22,000 copies in its first week.\n\nEverythang's Corrupt (2012–2018)[]\n\nIn 2012, Cube released more details on his forthcoming, tenth studio album, Everythang's Corrupt. Releasing its title track near the 2012 elections, he added, \"You know, this record is for the political heads.\" But the album's release was delayed. On February 10, 2014, iTunes brought another single from it, \"Sic Them Youngins on 'Em,\" and a music video followed the next day. Despite a couple of more song releases, the album release was delayed even beyond Cube's work on the 2015 film Straight Outta Compton. After a statement setting release to 2017, the album finally arrived on December 7, 2018.\n\nWestside Connection (1996–2007)[]\n\nIn 1996, Ice Cube formed with rappers Mack 10 and WC a trio. Feeling neglected by East Coast media, a longstanding issue in rap's bicoastal rivalry, the group aimed to reinforce West pride and resonate with the undervalued.\n\nThe Westside Connection's first album, Bow Down, has tracks like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" that reflect the group's objectives. The album was certified Platinum by year's end.\n\nReleased in 2003, the group's second album, Terrorist Threats, fared well critically, but saw lesser sales. \"Gangsta Nation,\" featuring Nate Dogg, the only single released, was a radio hit.\n\nAfter a rift between Cube and Mack 10 about Cube's film work minimizing the group's touring, the Westwide Connection disbanded.\n\nFeatures & collaborations (1992–)[]\n\nAmid Cube's numerous features on other artists' songs, an early one, along with Ice-T, is on 2Pac's 1993 album Strictly 4 My N.I.*.G.A.Z., its track \"Last Wordz.\" In 1994, Cube teamed with onetime N.W.A groupmate Dr. Dre, who was then leading rap's G-funk subgenre, for the first time since Cube had left the group, and which had disbanded upon Dre's 1991 departure. The result was the Cube and Dre song \"Natural Born Killaz,\" on the Murder Was The Case soundtrack, released by Dre's then new label, Death Row Records. In 2004, Cube featured on the song \"Real Ni*ga Roll Call\" by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, then the leaders of rap's crunk subgenre. And in 2008, Cube was on The Game's 2008 song \"State of Emergency.\" And in 2014, Cube appeared on MC Ren's remix \"Rebel Music,\" their first collaboration since the N.W.A reunion in 2000.\n\nIn 2010, Cube had signed up-and-coming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, deemed likely to be either skipped or given the cookie-cutter treatment by most record companies. Otherwise, over the years, Cube himself has collaborated outside the rap genre. He worked with David Bowie and Trent Reznor, the Nine Inch Nails singer, for a remix of Bowie's \"I'm Afraid of Americans.\" Cube is on the band Korn's song \"Children of the Korn,\" joined them on the Family Values Tour 1998, and received a return favor, \"Fuck Dying,\" on his own fifth album. Cube is found on British DJ Paul Oakenfold's solo debut album, Bunkka, the track \"Get Em Up.\" In 2012, Ice Cube recorded a verse for a remix of the Insane Clown Posse song \"Chris Benoit\", from ICP's The Mighty Death Pop! album, appearing on the album Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium. In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and returned to perform at the 2011 festival. Ice Cube performing live in Metro City Concert Club on October 29, 2010\n\nFilm & television[]\n\nStarting in 1991, Ice Cube had acted in nearly 40 films by 2018, including several highly regarded. Some of them, such as the 1992 thriller Trespass and the 1999 war comedy Three Kings, highlight action. Yet most are comedies, including a few adult-oriented ones, like the Friday franchise, whereas most of these are family-friendly, like the Barbershop franchise.\n\nNarrative[]\n\nJohn Singleton's seminal film Boyz n the Hood, released in July 1991, debuted the actor Ice Cube, playing Doughboy, a persona that Cube played convincingly. Later, Cube starred with Ice-T and Bill Paxton in Walter Hill's 1992 thriller film Trespass, and in Charles Burnett's 1995 film The Glass Shield. Meanwhile, Cube declined to costar with Janet Jackson in Singleton's 1993 romance Poetic Justice, a role that Tupac Shakur then played.\n\nCube did star as the university student Fudge in Singleton's 1995 film Higher Learning. Singleton, encouraging Cube, had reportedly told him, \"If you can write a record, you can write a movie.\" Cube cowrote the screenplay for the 1995 comedy Friday, based on adult themes, and starred in it with comedian Chris Tucker. Made with $3.5 million, Friday drew $28 million worldwide. Two sequels, Next Friday and Friday After Next, arrived in 2000 and 2002.\n\nIn 1997, playing a South African exiled to America who returns 15 years later, Cube stars in the action thriller Dangerous Ground, and has a supporting role in Anaconda. In 1998, writing again, the director Ice Cube debuted in The Players Club. In 1999, he starred alongside George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg as a staff sergeant in Three Kings, set in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf War, whereby the United States attacked Iraq in 1990, an \"intelligent\" war comedy critically acclaimed. In 2002, Cube starred in Kevin Bray's All About the Benjamins, and in Tim Story's comedy film Barbershop.\n\nIn 2004, Cube played in Barbershop 2, and in Torque. The next year, he replaced Vin Diesel in the second installment of the XXX film series and also appeared in the family comedy Are We There Yet?, which premised his role in its 2007 sequel, Are We Done Yet?. In 2012, Cube acted in 21 Jump Street. He acted in its sequel, 22 Jump Street, in 2014. That year, and then to return in 2016, he played alongside comedian Kevin Hart in two more Tim Story films, Ride Along and Ride Along 2. Also in 2016, Cube returned for the third entry in the Barbershop series. And in 2017, Cube starred with Charlie Day in the comedy Fist Fight.\n\nDocumentary[]\n\nIn late 2005, Ice Cube and R. J. Cutler co-created the six-part documentary series Black. White., carried by cable network FX.\n\nIce Cube and basketball star LeBron James paired up to pitch a one-hour special to ABC based on James's life.\n\nOn May 11, 2010, ESPN aired Cube's directed documentary Straight Outta L.A., examining the interplay of Los Angeles sociopolitics, hip hop, and the Raiders during the 1980s into the 1990s.\n\nSerial television[]\n\nIce Cube's Are We There Yet? series premiered on TBS on June 2, 2010. It revolves around a family adjusting to the matriarch's new husband, played by Terry Crews. On August 16, the show was renewed for 90 more episodes, amounting to six seasons. Cube also credits Tyler Perry for his entrée to TBS. In front of the television cameras, rather, Cube appeared with Elmo as a 2014 guest on the PBS children's show Sesame Street.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Ice Cube discography\n\nSee also: N.W.A discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nAmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (1990)\n\nDeath Certificate (1991)\n\nThe Predator (1992)\n\nLethal Injection (1993)\n\nWar & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc) (1998)\n\nWar & Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc) (2000)\n\nLaugh Now, Cry Later (2006)\n\nRaw Footage (2008)\n\nI Am the West (2010)\n\nEverythang's Corrupt (2018)\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilms[]\n\nYear Film Functioned as Role Director Producer Screenwriter Actor 1991 Boyz n the Hood Darin \"Doughboy\" Baker 1992 Trespass Savon 1993 CB4 Himself (cameo) 1994 The Glass Shield Teddy Woods 1995 Higher Learning Fudge Friday Craig Jones 1997 Dangerous Ground Vusi Madlazi Anaconda Danny Rich 1998 The Players Club Reggie I Got the Hook Up Gun runner 1999 Three Kings Sgt.
