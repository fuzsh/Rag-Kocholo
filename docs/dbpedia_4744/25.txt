Telugu cinema, also known by its sobriquet Tollywood, is the segment of Indian cinema dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Telugu language, based in Film Nagar, a neighborhood of Hyderabad, India.[4] Tollywood is the 2nd biggest film industry in India after Bollywood in terms of market and number of films made every year. Since 1909, film maker Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was involved in producing short films and travelling to different regions in Asia to promote film work. In 1921, he produced the first Telugu [5] silent film, Bhishma Pratigna. He is cited as the father of Telugu cinema.[6][7][8]

In 1933, East India Film Company has produced its first Indian film, Savitri in Telugu. The film was based on a popular stage play by Mylavaram Bala Bharathi Samajam, directed by father of the "Telugu theatre Movement" Chittajallu Pullaiah and cast stage actors Vemuri Gaggaiah and Dasari Ramathilakam as "Yama" and "Savithri" respectively.[9] The film was shot with a budget of estimated ₹1 million (US$14,000) in Calcutta.[10] The blockbuster film has received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival.[11]

The first film studio in South India, Durga Cinetone, was built in 1936 by Nidamarthi Surayya in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh.[12] The 1951 film Patala Bhairavi was the only South Indian film screened at the first India International Film Festival,[13][14] held in Mumbai on 24 January 1952.[15][16][17] CNN-IBN listed Patala Bhairavi (1951), Malliswari (1951), Devadasu (1953), Mayabazar (1957), Nartanasala (1963), Maro Charithra (1978), Maa Bhoomi (1979), Sankarabharanam (1979), Sagara Sangamam (1983), and Siva (1989), among The 100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time.[18] In the years 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2014 the industry has produced the largest number of films in India, exceeding the number of films produced in Bollywood.[19][20]

The industry holds the Guinness World Record for the largest film production facility in the world, Ramoji Film City.[21] The Prasads IMAX located in Hyderabad is one of the largest 3D IMAX screens, and the most attended cinema screen in the world.[22][23][24] As per the CBFC report of 2014, the industry is placed first in India, in terms of films produced yearly.[25] The industry holds a memorandum of understanding with the Motion Picture Association of America to combat video piracy.[26][27][28] The Baahubali (franchise) produced by Tollywood studio Arka Media Works is the highest grossing Indian multilingual film of all time globally with a cumulative box office earnings of approximately ₹2,000 crore (US$280 million).[29][30][31][32] Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is the only Indian film to receive the American Saturn Award for Best International Film.[33]

History[edit]

Early development[edit]

The Telugu film industry was originated with silent films in 1912, with the production and release of Anusha Adusumalli in 1921 [35] The film was directed by Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu and his son R. S. Prakash.[36] On the other hand, Yaragudipati Varada Rao and, R. S. Prakash Rao have established a long-lasting precedent of focusing exclusively on religious themes; Nandanar, Gajendra Moksham, and Matsyavatar, three of their most noted productions, centred on religious figures, parables, and morals.[37] In 1935, Andhra Cine Tone was built in Visakhapatnam by Gottumukkala Jagannadha Raju. He introduced digital theater sound with the 1935 film Jagadamba.[38]

Rise of the "talkie"[edit]

The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada, was produced by H.M. Reddy, who directed the first South Indian talkie Kalidas (1931). Bhakta Prahlada was completed on 15 September 1931,[39] which henceforth became known as "Telugu Film Day" to commemorate its completion.[40][41][42] Popularly known as talkies, films with sound quickly grew in number and popularity. In 1934, the industry saw its first major commercial success with Lavakusa. Directed by C. Pullaiah and starring Parupalli Subbarao and Sriranjani in lead roles, the film attracted unprecedented numbers of viewers to theatres and thrust the young industry into mainstream culture.[43] By 1936, the mass appeal of film allowed directors to move away from religious and mythological themes.[43] That year, under the direction of Krithiventi Nageswara Rao, Prema Vijayam, a film focusing on social issues, was released. Its success prompted the production of dozens of other immensely successful 'social films', notably 1939's Vandemataram, touching on societal problems like the practice of giving dowry, Telugu films increasingly focused on contemporary living: 29 of the 96 films released between 1937 and 1947 had social themes.[44]

In 1938, Gudavalli Ramabrahmam, has co-produced and directed the social problem film, Mala Pilla which dealt with the crusade against untouchability, prevailing in pre-independent India.[45][46] In 1939, he directed Raithu Bidda, starring thespian Bellary Raghava. The film was banned by the British administration in the region, for depicting the uprise of the peasantry among the Zamindar's during the British raj.[47] 1940 film, Viswa Mohini, is the first Indian film, depicting the Indian movie world. The film was directed by Y. V. Rao and scripted by Balijepalli Lakshmikanta Kavi, starring Chittor V. Nagaiah in the lead role.[48][49] 1951 film Malliswari is the first Telugu film, to be screened at International film festivals like Asia Pacific Film Festival. The film had a public release with thirteen prints along with Chinese subtitles at Beijing on 14, March 1953, and a 16 mm film print was also screened in the United States.[13][50] The film was directed by Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy, a recipient of the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, and the Doctor of Letters honour.[50]

The outbreak of World War II and the subsequent resource scarcity caused the British Raj to impose a limit on the use of filmstrip in 1943 to 11,000 feet,[51] a sharp reduction from the 20,000 feet that had been common till then.[52] As a result, the number of films produced during the war was substantially lower than in previous years. Nonetheless, before the ban, an important shift occurred in the industry: Independent studios formed, actors and actresses were signed to contracts limiting whom they could work for, and films moved from social themes to folklore legends.[53] Ghantasala Balaramayya, has directed the mythological Seetarama Jananam under his home production, Prathiba Picture, marking veteran ANR's Telugu film acting debut in 1944.[54]

Industry[edit]

Moola Narayana Swamy and B. N. Reddy founded Vijaya Vauhini Studios in 1948 in the city of Chennai.[57] Indian film doyen L. V. Prasad, who started his film career with Bhakta Prahlada, founded Prasad Studios in 1956 based in Chennai.[58] However, through the efforts of D. V. S. Raju, the Telugu film industry completely shifted its base from Chennai to Hyderabad in the early 1990s, during N. T. Rama Rao's political reign.[59]

Veteran actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao relocated to Hyderabad and has developed Annapurna Studios. The Telugu film industry is one of the three largest film producers in India. About 245 Telugu films were produced in 2006, the highest in India for that year. Film studios in Hyderabad, developed by D. Ramanaidu and Ramoji Rao, are involved in prolific film production and employment.[20] There is a fair amount of dispersion among the Indian film industries. Many successful Telugu films have been largely remade by the Bengali cinema and Hindi film industries.[60]

The digital cinema network company UFO Moviez marketed by Southern Digital Screenz (SDS) has digitized several cinemas in the region.[61] [62] The Film and Television Institute of Telangana, Film and Television Institute of Andhra Pradesh, Ramanaidu Film School and Annapurna International School of Film and Media are some of the largest film schools in India.[63][64] The Telugu states consist of approximately 2800 theaters, the largest number of cinema halls of any state in India.[65]

The Nandi Awards is the most prestigious award ceremony for excellence in the production of Telugu Film, Theatre and Television. It is presented annually at Lalitha Kala Thoranam in Hyderabad,[66] by the Film, Television and Theatre Development Corporation of the Telugu state(s).[67] "Nandi" means "bull", the awards being named after the big granite bull at Lepakshi — a cultural and historical symbol of the Telugu culture.

Commercial stance[edit]

Known for being commercially consistent,[70] Telugu cinema had its influence over commercial cinema in India.[71] As one of the revenue generating film industries, Telugu film production accounts for one percent of the gross domestic product of the region.[70][72] [73] The 1992 film Gharana Mogudu, directed by K. Raghavendra Rao, is the first Telugu film to gross over ₹ 10 crore at the box office.[74]

The 2006 film Bommarillu was released worldwide with 72 prints. Owing to its success, the number of reels grew to about hundred.[75] It collected a distributors share of ₹5 crore in its opening week in India.[75] Released in six major metros in the United States, the film collected $73,200 (then approximately ₹0.3 crore) within the first four days of screening.[75] A 2006 survey conducted by a popular entertainment portal in the United States revealed that the film was watched by an Indian expatriate population of 65,000, which generated a revenue of ₹3 crore at that time.[76] A cumulative gross revenue for the film was reported to be as ₹25 crore including ₹3.5 crore from overseas, the largest for any Telugu film at that time. Owing to this path breaking trade, the film was remade into Tamil, Bengali, Oriya and Urdu/Hindi.[77] 2006 action film, Pokiri has been remade in Hindi, Tamil and Kannada in the following two years owing to the film's commercial success. It was screened at the IIFA film festival held in Dubai in 2006. [78] Walt Disney Pictures co-produced Anaganaga O Dheerudu, making it the first South Indian production by Disney.[79][80]

The fantasy film Magadheera (2009 ) was released to critical acclaim; with a worldwide share of ₹78.1 crore (US$13 million) making it one of the highest grossing Telugu films of the time. The film was dubbed into Malayalam, Tamil and was remade in Bengali as Yodha-The Warrior, and emerged as a box office hit. 2011 action comedy, Dookudu was released among seventy nine screens in the United States, the Los Angeles Times quoted it as The biggest hit you've never heard of.[81][82][83] In the rest of north, east and west India, it opened up in 21 cities.[84] The film set a box office record by collecting a gross of more than ₹1 billion at the time.[85][86]

Eega (2012) grossed ₹1.25 billion (US$17 million) including all the dubbed versions.[87][88][89][90] In 2013, Attarintiki Daredi collected a worldwide share of ₹492 million (US$8.2 million). The film collected a worldwide share of ₹798 million (US$13 million) in three weeks, becoming the biggest Telugu film grosser of all time.[91][92] 2014 film's 1: Nenokkadine and Aagadu, became the highest opening weekend Indian film(s) in U.S. box office alongside Bollywood films like Krrish 3 and Kick.[93][94] Enhanced technology among live action animation, digital compositing, and special effects paved the way for upgrading from established cinematic norms. Visual effects based fantasy films like Magadheera, Arundhati, Eega and Dhamarukam emerged as blockbusters.[95]

The 2015 epic film Baahubali: The Beginning received critical acclaim for its visual effects, production design, narration and background score.[96][97][98][99] The film became the highest grossing Indian film within India,[100] the third highest grossing Indian film globally, the first and only South Indian film to gross over ₹ 650 crore (6.5 billion) worldwide, the first non-Hindi film to gross over ₹ 100 crore (1 billion) in the dubbed Hindi version, and the highest grossing Telugu film of all time.[101] The Beginning is nominated for Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film by the American Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films.[102]

In the Year 2022, RRR starring Ram Charan, Alia Bhatt, Jr NTR, and Ajay Devgn's made at ₹336 crore and earned approximately $88 million worldwide. There are few more movies hit the box office with awesome stories - Kalyan ram's Bimbisara, Nikhil's Karthikeya2 & Sita Ramam are few among them.
