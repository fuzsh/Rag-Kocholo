The Telugu film industry, also known as Tollywood, began in the early 20th century with the production of silent films in India. The first Telugu \"talkie\" or film with audible dialogue was released in 1932. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Telugu films transitioned away from religious themes and began focusing more on social issues and contemporary stories. By the late 1940s, Telugu cinema had become firmly established with many popular films being produced annually in the Telugu language.",
