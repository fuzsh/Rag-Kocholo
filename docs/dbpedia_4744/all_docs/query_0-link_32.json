        "text": "By P. Kesava Kumar. Kesava Kumar is a Professor of Philosophy at Delhi University. Translations by A. Suneetha and Gautham Reddy. Suneetha and Gautham are members of the Maidaanam Editorial Collective.\n\nEditor’s Note: Gummadi Vittal Rao (1949-2023), or Gaddar as he is more popularly known, was a historical phenomenon. He was unprecedented and little understood. Generations have grown up with his songs – some drawn by his earthy poetics, others by his gentle dances or theatrical stage performances, fiery politics, or some combination of these elements. He is perhaps the only Indian performer and political thinker who was capable of attracting hundreds of thousands of people to public meetings for decades.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say Gaddar was the reason many people were inspired to join the great political struggles for justice in the Telugu regions. The general decline of revolutionary left politics after the ’90s, along with his own differences with Communist leaders, saw Gaddar’s reach and influence in party circles decline. Yet he reinvented himself, finding new audiences and fans in the campaign for a separate Telangana State, an increasingly assertive Telugu Dalit and Bahujan movement, and a booming new Telugu media industry. Gaddar’s recent passing in August has led many to revisit and comment on the legacy and significance of his life.\n\nIn light of this moment, we present this essay by Kesava Kumar on the evolution of Gaddar’s politics and poetics along with select translations of his songs by A. Suneetha and Gautham Reddy.\n\nThe songs of Gaddar are legendary in the Telugu parts of southern India. Drawing on popular Telangana folk genres, such as Oggu Katha, Veedhi Bhaagavatham, and Yellamma Kathalu, they are powerful expressions of leftist ideas and revolutionary fervor.\n\nGaddar’s career as a cultural activist spanned over fifty years and consistently focused on the experiences of the poor and the oppressed. His songs reflect a deep engagement with different ideological strands of the Indian left and their evolution. During the 1970s, Gaddar joined the militant Maoist-Naxalite movement and served as a leading figure in the influential revolutionary theater troupe, Jana Natya Mandali (JNM). During this time he achieved widespread popularity for songs that celebrated the martyrs of the armed movement.\n\nOver the next decade, during the emergence of the Telugu Dalit and Feminist movements, his songs displaya notable change in focus. Where they earlier focused on more general experiences of “farmers” (raitulu) and “laborers” (cooleelu), they now spoke to the pain and resistance of specific Dalit communities (Mala, Madiga) and women. During the ’90s Gaddar became an outspoken critic of globalization and increasing religious nationalism. Toward the end of his life, he came out of the Maoist-Naxalite movement and played an important role in the campaign to create a separate Telangana state. Gaddar’s songs, with their dynamic range of themes and tremendous popularity, are an unforgettable monument to the great struggles for dignity and justice that have shaped postcolonial India.\n\nBhaarata Desam Bhaagya Seema Raa! Singing Realism into Political Action\n\nGaddar first rose to notice in the mid-1970s during his association with the Maoist-Naxalite movement. His songs from this time reflect Maoist understandings of Indian society as “semi-feudal” and “semi-colonial.” They center on the problems of the masses and were sung in the name of the peasant and the farm laborer (raitu-cooleelu). The crux of these songs focus on their courageous battle to escape social and economic oppression.\n\nHis song, India is a Land of Plenty – Bhaarata Desam Bhaagya Seema Raa depicts this inequality and exposes the fundamental contradiction of the Indian society – though the country is rich in resources, its people remain poor:\n\nభారతదేశం భాగ్యసీమరా\n\nసకలసంపదలకు కొదవలేదురా\n\nబంగారుపంటల భూములున్నయి\n\nచావులేని మరి జీవ నదులురా\n\nసకలసంపదలు గల దేశంలో\n\nదరిద్రమెట్లుందిరో నాయనా?\n\nbhaarata desam bhaagya seema raa\n\nsakala sampadalaku kodava ledu raa\n\nbangaaru pantala bhumulunnaayi\n\nchaavuleni mari jeeva nadulu raa\n\nsakala sampadalu gala desamlo\n\ndaridram etlundiro naayana?\n\nIndia is a land of plenty, raa\n\nThere is no dearth of any wealth, raa\n\nIts lands are gold with ripened grain\n\nIts rivers brim with endless life, raa\n\nIn a land with all kinds of wealth\n\nHow can there be poverty, my child?\n\nIn a similar tone, Gaddar described the fate of productive classes/castes. He highlighted the plight of traditional occupations taken by particular caste groups and how they were alienated from the fruits of their own labor. In fact, as the verse below ingeniously shows, this alienation follows them even into their death.\n\nకమ్మోరోని ఇంట్లబుట్టి\n\nకత్తిపీట సుత్తిలేక\n\nకుమ్మరోని ఇంట్లబట్టి\n\nపిండాకూడు కుండలేక\n\nవడ్లోని ఇంట్ల బుట్టి\n\nఉలి సేకు పిడి లేక\n\nశాలోళ్ల ఇంట్ల బుట్టి\n\nచావుబట్ట కొనలేక\n\nkammaroni intla butti\n\nkatti peeta sutti leka\n\nkummaroni intla butti\n\npindaa kudu kunda leka\n\nvodloni intla butti\n\nvuli seku pidileka\n\nshaalolla intla butti\n\nchaavubatta konaleka\n\nBorn in a blacksmith’s family\n\nNo hammer No cutting board\n\nBorn in a potter’s family\n\nNo pot to offer rice for the dead\n\nBorn in a carpenter’s family\n\nNo chisel No clamp\n\nBorn in a weaver’s family\n\nCan’t even buy a funeral shroud\n\nDuring the political crisis of the Emergency (1975-77), Indian society experienced a severe shock due to inflation. The price of basic commodities increased sharply. The JNM had a song on this topic, which remains popular to this day:\n\nఏం కొనేడట్టు లేదు\n\nఏం తినేడట్టు లేదు\n\nనాగులో నాగన్న!\n\nధరలిట్ల పెరుగవట్టె\n\nనాగులో నాగన్న\n\nem kone dattu ledu\n\nemi tine dattu ledu\n\nnaagulo naaganna!\n\ndharal itla perugavatte\n\nnaagulo naaganna!\n\nHow can we buy anything\n\nHow can we eat anything\n\nNaagulo Naaganna!\n\nWhen prices keep going up\n\nNaagulo Naaganna!\n\nAnother popular JNM song, We Have Smashed Mountains – Kondalu Pagalesinaam strikingly evokes the exploitation of labor. The undercurrent of all these songs is that even though the working class toils day and night, they do not see any changes in their lives. Gaddar’s songs ask – Why do the productive classes have to starve? Why do the landlord, the capitalist, the nation grow richer? Such songs are a direct expression of the Marxist analysis of surplus in clear and simple terms, appealing directly to the experience of the worker. The idea is that wealth/surplus is always generated through exploitation at the expense of the laborer.\n\nIt is important to note that Gaddar did not limit his songs to pitiful descriptions of the exploitation and oppression of the masses. He also sought to inspire a confident spirit of resistance in his audiences. His songs essentially urge the masses to question and revolt against the dominant system. Take for example the song by Guda Anjaiah, that Gaddar popularized with his voice, This is Our Village – Vooru Manadi Raa:\n\nఈ వూరు మనదిరా, ఈ వాడ మనదిరా\n\nప్రతి పనికి మనంరా\n\nసుత్తి మనది, కట్టి మనది\n\nదొర ఏందిరో? వాడి పీకుడేందిరో?\n\nee vooru manadi raa, ee vaada manadi raa\n\nprati paniki manam raa\n\nsutti manadi katti manadi\n\ndora yendiro? vadi peekud endiro?\n\nThis is our village, raa\n\nThis is our neighborhood, raa\n\nWe do all the work, raa\n\nThe hammer is ours\n\nThe knife is ours\n\nWho is this landlord?\n\nWhy do we suffer his oppression?\n\nLike any Marxist, Gaddar believed that social relations are always in a dynamic state. For him, the working class would never stay silent and would inevitably revolt for a better life. Consequently, we see that change is an underlying theme of his songs. Gaddar firmly believed that this change would only be brought through the organization of the working masses under a revolutionary Marxist party. In the song, It Won’t Stop, Won’t Stop, Won’t Stop – Aagadu, Aagadu, Aagadu he shared his belief that the ordinary folk who starve are the ones who will band together and lead the armed struggle against injustice:\n\nఆగదు, ఆగదు ఆగదు\n\nఈ ఆకలి పోరు ఆగదు\n\nఈ దోపిడీ పాలన అంతం వరకు\n\nఈ సాయుధ పోరు ఆగదు\n\nచీమల దండులు కదిలినయి\n\nపాముల గుండెలు అదిరినయి\n\nఆవుల మందలు కదిలినయి\n\nపులులు పరుగులు తీసినయి\n\naagadu aagadu aagadu\n\nee aakali poru aagadu\n\nee dopidi paalana antham varaku\n\nee saayudha poru aagadu\n\ncheemala dandulu kadilinai\n\npaamula gundelu adirinai\n\naavula mandalu kadilinai\n\npululu parugulu teesinai\n\nIt won’t stop, won’t stop, won’t stop\n\nThis fight against hunger won’t stop\n\nUntil the rule of the oppressor ends\n\nThis armed struggle won’t stop\n\nThe swarms of ants are marching\n\nThe hearts of snakes are trembling\n\nThe herds of cattle are marching\n\nThe tigers are fleeing\n\nThis song draws on popular children’s animal tales to colorfully depict the growing energy and courage of mass working class movements against their predators – landlords and capitalists.\n\nGaddar had a clear vision of what comprised class in the Indian social context. In order to mobilize the people under a revolutionary party, he composed songs that called to all types of Indian workers. His songs often single out and specifically name different workers – railway workers (gangollamandi), stone quarry workers (vadderollamandi), porters (hamalilu), rikshaw pullers (rikshaawala), female farm laborers (sirimalle chettukinda lachumammo), beedi workers (mogolla notlo beedilai), coal mine workers (singareni ghani kaarmikulu, banda kinda batukulu, singareni ceeti vini), RTC public bus drivers (draiver anna). At the same time, Gaddar also sought to unite these diverse groups of laborers under the broader category of the “working class.” Take for example the famous song, Raheem the Rikshaw Puller – Rikshaa Tokke Raheem, where he called upon various workers as his brothers (anna):\n\nరిక్షా తొక్కే రహీమ్ అన్నా!\n\nరాళ్లు కొట్టే రామన్నా!\n\nడ్రైవర్మల్లన్నా!\n\nనీకున్న ఆస్తంతా\n\nరెండు రెక్కలు అన్నా!\n\nrikshaa tokke raheem anna!\n\nraallu kotte raamanna!\n\ndraiver mallanna!\n\nneek unna aastanta\n\nrendu rekkale, anna!\n\nRikshaw puller, Rahim anna!\n\nStonecutter, Ramu anna!\n\nDriver Malla anna!\n\nAll you own\n\nAre your two hands, anna!\n\nIn this way, Gaddar’s songs translated Marxist understandings of “class” into the concrete realities of Indian society. His songs appealed directly to the concerned groups. They owned his songs as the truth of their lives.\n\nRaktamto Naduputaanu! The Body in Anticapitalist Struggle\n\nGaddar composed countless songs on feudal oppression and the ongoing struggles against landlords. However, one of his unique features was that he also gave special importance to the precarious situation of workers suffering the transition from feudalism to capitalism. His songs observed that capitalism relies on the extensive use of machines for the production of goods in large scale. They suggest that its ultimate goal is to generate profit by expanding its markets. Capitalism commodifies everything and reduces human relations to the value of utility. Under this systeem, life becomes mechanical.\n\nIn his song, Constantly Turning – Tirugutoovundante, Gaddar reflected on the industrial process of commodity production by machines and how it drains the blood of the worker. In this, he captured the essence of how capitalist exploitation. In another popular song, he describes a figure who was once very common in Indian cities: the rikshaw puller. His song The Rikshaw Puller –Rikshaawala is set in the voice of a Rikshaw puller and not only illustrates his miseries but also ridicules capitalism in a subtle form:\n\nరక్తంతో నడుపుతాను రిక్షాను\n\nనా రక్తమే నా రిక్షాకు పెట్రోలు\n\nraktamto naduputaanu rikshaanu\n\nnaa raktame naa rikshaaku petrolu\n\nMy blood powers this rikshaw\n\nMy blood is its sole fuel\n\nGaddar was also extremely critical of the Indian state. He believed that, following the Maoist party’s analysis, the postcolonial Indian government’s social and political structures reflected a semi-feudal and semi-colonial character. The ruling hegemonic bloc were composed of a motely mix of feudal landlords, capitalist industrialists, and an elitist urban bourgeois class. His songs sought to name and target the exploitation committed by these groups:\n\nటాటా, బిర్లా, భూస్వాములు\n\nపెత్తనాన్ని పాతి పెట్టి\n\nడప్పుతో దండోరా వేయన్నా\n\nరైతన్నా నీవు\n\nఆయుధాలకు పూజ సేయన్నా\n\nముందు ముందు కాలం నీదేనన్నా\n\ntaataa, biralaa, bhooswaamulu\n\npettanaani paati petti\n\ndapputo dandoraa veyanna\n\nrait anna neevu\n\naayudhaaluku pooja seyanna\n\nmundu mundu kaalam needen anna\n\nBury the Tata-Birla-landlord rule!\n\nRaise the battle cry of your dappu drum, anna!\n\nFarmer anna!\n\nConsecrate your weapons, anna!\n\nThe future is yours, anna!\n\nIn several songs such as these, Gaddar drew direct links between the village landlord, the industrial baron, and the imperialist powers of the Cold War. For example, in one of his Dakhini/Urdu songs, Rise up – Jaago Re he sings:\n\njaago re!\n\njaago re jaago jaago!\n\nduniya mein majuduro\n\nekvo-ekvo\n\nduniya ka dushman hain amerika rashiya\n\nun kee dalal hain taataa birla\n\nun kee gulaam hai desh kee netha\n\nun kee chenche hai gav kee jaalim\n\ninse ladana hai jaago re!\n\nRise up!\n\nRise up, rise up, rise up!\n\nWorkers of the world\n\nAmerica and Russia are enemies of the world\n\nTata and Birla are their brokers\n\nOur nation’s leaders are their slaves\n\nOur village crooks toe their line\n\nRise up to fight them!\n\nA note on the form of this song should be made. Gaddar experimentally took the tune of an African song and introduced humming to great effect. Musically, as he condemns the imperialism of the great powers, he also builds connections with other communities exploited by them around the world.\n\nGaddar considered most third world nations fundamentally agrarian. He felt a solidarity with the working peoples of those countries. Artists and writers in those contexts borrowed many of the folk and popular melodies from the lives of their local productive classes. He believed that the selection of these kinds of tunes would translate well across third world nations and build a sort of third-world internationalism and global worker solidarity.\n\nSree Raamuni Sirasu Chitaka! Hindutva and Communal Violence\n\nThe late eighties also saw the spread of Hindutva, right-wing Hindu nationalism, and a related spike in communal violence targeting Muslims and other religious minorities. Organizations such as the RSS mobilized around the destruction of the Babri masjid in Ayodhya, a historic medieval mosque, and the construction of a new Rama temple on its location. Gaddar condemned the spread of such atrocities in the name of religion as in his song May they Crush Lord Rama’s Head – Sree Raamuni Sirasu Chitaka:\n\nశ్రీరాముని శిరసు చితక, ఆల్లకు అగ్గి తగల\n\nనా ముక్కు చెవులు కొస్తిరో, మతం ముండాకొడకా\n\nనా గుడిసెకు నిప్పెడితిరో, మతం ముండాకొడకా\n\nsree raamuni sirasu chitaka! aallaku aggi tagala!\n\nnaa mukku chevulu kostiro, matam mundaakodaka!\n\nnaa gudiseku nippedtiro, matam mundaakodaka!\n\nDalita Pululu Amma! Dalit Self Respect and Resistance against Landlords\n\nDuring this period, Gaddar also encountered the growth of new Telugu Dalit and Feminist movements. These movements, first emerging in literary and cultural spaces, criticized the Communist party and its associated groups for their limited focus on class. Dalit and Feminist intellectuals brought a radical new understanding of the intersection of class with caste and patriarchy. Strikingly, they made no exception for the armed Naxalite struggle. Their critiques led to a major debate in the left on the significance of caste and gender in imagining emancipation and liberation.\n\nThis atmosphere inspired Gaddar to focus more directly on the tangible experiences of India’s oppressed. Born into a family of Dalit laborers, Gaddar became an important internal critic of the Maoist-Naxalite movement on the topic of caste. At the same time, nurtured by the Maoist armed struggle, he also expressed criticism of the Dalit movement’s strategies around engaging the Indian government and bourgeois society.\n\nGaddar emerged as a unique bridge between the Naxalite party and the Dalit movement. He was not only a singer but also a a committed theorist. In comparison to the abstract political rhetoric of Marxist intellectuals, his earthy language and concrete descriptions came much closer to the lived experiences of the toiling masses. Against the backdrop of an emerging Dalit movement, he shifted his language from identifying “the people” by terms such as “coolie” and “laborer” to the specific Telugu Dalit communities who worked in these roles such as Malas and Madigas.\n\nThis transformation can be seen when comparing his songs from the ’70s that called out to “coolee anna” (coolie brother) to his songs of ’80s that hailed them as “Dalita pululu” (Dalit tigers). At the same time, it is important to recognize that Gaddar’s earlier repertoire was not completely silent on caste. Songs such as Oh, these Maadiga Lives – Yelaro Ee Maadiga Batukulu and Seize the Government, Maala Anna – Raajya Adhikaaraniki, Maala Anna come to mind. However, these songs generally did not treat Dalit struggles for dignity as distinct from the larger Maoist-Naxalite struggle for the working class. In Seize the Government, Maala Anna – Raajya Adhikaaraniki, Maala Anna, Gaddar claimed that there would be no real change in the lives of Dalits unless and until they obtain state political power through revolution.\n\nబాంచన్ బాంచనంటు\n\nగులాపాన్ని దొర అంటు\n\nఎన్నాళ్ళు బతుకుతావు మాలన్నా\n\nఎదురు తిరగవేమిరో మాదిగన్నా\n\nనువ్వు మతం మార్చుకున్నా\n\nనీ బతుకు మారదన్నా\n\nనీవు కులం మార్చుకున్నా\n\nనీకు కూడు దొరకదన్నా\n\nనీవు రాజ్య మేలకుండా\n\nనీ రాత మారదన్నా\n\nరాజ్యాధికారానికి, మాలన్నా\n\nనీవు రైఫిలందుకోవరో, మాదిగన్నా\n\nbaanchan baanchan antu\n\ngulaapaanni dora antu\n\nennaallu batukutaavu maala anna?\n\neduru tiragavemiroo maadiga anna?\n\nnuvvu matam maarchukunnaa\n\nnee batuku maaradu anna\n\nneevu kulam maarchukunnaa\n\nneeku kuda dorakadu anna\n\nneevu raajyam elakundaa\n\nnee raata maaradu anna\n\nraajya adhikaaraaniki, maala anna!\n\nneevu raiphil andukovaro, maadiga anna!\n\n“Master, I am at your service”\n\n“I am your slave! I am your slave!”\n\nHow long will you grovel, Maala Anna!\n\nWhy won’t you revolt, Maadiga Anna!\n\nYou can change your religion\n\nBut your life won’t change\n\nYou can change your caste\n\nBut you’ll still be hungry\n\nYour fate won’t change\n\nUntil you’re in charge\n\nSeize the Government, Maala Anna!\n\nPick up the rifle, Maadiga Anna!\n\nThrough songs like these, Gaddar specifically appealed to the Dalit communities of Andhra, especially Mala and Madiga caste groups, to join the working class struggle. Departing from Ambedkarite thinking, he believed that even if Dalits changed their religion, they would still see no substantial changes in their lives. For Gaddar, armed struggle was the only way to achieve lasting change.\n\nThe ’90s saw Gaddar become more involved in the Dalit struggles of Andhra. He began to rework his literary frame from a class-centered discourse to a caste-centered one. With this shift he began to acquire a wider base beyond the direct ambit of Marxist–Leninist political organizations.\n\nOne exaple of this is his increasing impact on the festive Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations introduced in Andhra Pradesh at this time. Although the state government made efforts to resist his presence at government-sponsored functions, the Dalit masses, including those who disagreed with his commitment to the Naxalite movement, welcomed Gaddar as a performer and brother. He became an icon of Dalit Bahujan organizing.\n\nA watershed moment in Dalit organizing in the Telugu states occurred with the brutal Karamchedu massacre of 1985. The massacre was spurred by a Madiga boy who objected to a Kamma boy washing a buffalo near the Dalit water tank and dirtying his community’s drinking water. The incident provoked a strong backlash from the dominant Kamma caste who was the primary support caste base for the Telugu Desam Party that governed Andhra Pradesh at this time. The growing self-respect and political assertion of Telugu Dalits was understood as a threat to the social and political dominance of Kamma landlords. This growing tension led to a confrontation between both communities that resulted in the murder of 6 Madiga youths, injuries for many more, rape, and the displacement of hundreds of Dalit people from their homes.\n\nThe Dalit response to this tragedy was unprecedented. There was a large-scale mobilization of Dalit people from across the state to support the victims. Caste suddenly became a topic of open discussion and the word “Dalit” acquired new prominence through the organization of Malas and Madigas under the banner of the Dalit Maha Sabha. Unlike earlier times, the Dalits of Karamchedu stood against the upper castes and demanded respect. With this rising consciousness among Dalits, they decided they would no longer surrender themselves to upper caste hegemony. On this critical moment, Gaddar sang the song Dalit Tigers, Amma – Dalita Pululu, Amma in a manner that echoed older heroic folk ballads in Telugu:\n\nదళిత పులులమ్మా, దళిత పులులమ్మా\n\nకారంచేడు భూస్వాములతోని\n\nకలబడి నిలబడి పోరు చేసిన\n\nదళిత పులులమ్మా\n\ndalita pululu, amma, dalita pululu amma\n\nkaaramchedu bhooswaamulatoni\n\nkalabadi nilabadi poru chesina\n\ndalita pululu amma\n\nDalit tigers, Amma! Dalit tigers, Amma!\n\nThey joined together, They rose up,\n\nThey battled the landlords of Karamchedu!\n\nAmma, they were Dalit tigers!\n\nThe brutal massacre at Karamchedu was followed several years later by yet another atrocity, the 1991 Chunduru massacre. In this incident, a young Dalit college student’s feet accidentally touched an upper caste Reddy woman’s feet in a cinema hall. This led to the murder of 8 Dalits from the Mala community and a devastating economic boycott by Reddy landlords who employed Mala laborers as daily wage workers. Relating to this tragedy, Gaddar had the song Come, My Chundooru Dalit Brothers – Chundooru Dalit Anna, Randiro and called for the overthrow of the Chunduru Reddy landlords:\n\nచుండూరు దళితన్నా\n\nరండిరో దళితన్నా\n\nదండు కట్టుదాము\n\nచుండూరు భూస్వాముల\n\nగోరి కట్టుదాము\n\nchundooru dalita anna\n\nrandiro dalita anna\n\ndandu kattudaamu\n\nchundooru bhooswaamula\n\ngori kattudaamu\n\nChunduru Dalit Anna!\n\nCome, Oh Dalit Anna!\n\nLet’s band together\n\nLet’s bury the Chunduru Landlords\n\nGaddar believed that the liberation of Dalits was firmly linked to a struggle for land and economic security. He emphasized the need to unite the struggles against caste exploitation and class exploitation as in the song Brothers, My Dalit Brothers – Annalaara, Dalita Annalaara:\n\nఅన్నలారా, దళితన్నలారా, మాయన్న పోరన్నలారా\n\nఅడిగి చూడు ఆదిలాబాదు కరీంనగరులో కష్టజీవులు\n\nభూమికోసం భుక్తి కోసం\n\nబరిసెలెత్తినారు, బాకులెత్తినారు\n\nదళితజీవుల విముక్తి పోరు భూమిపోరుతో ముడిపడివుంది\n\nకులపోరు, వర్గ పోరు కల్సి పోరాడుదాం\n\nభూపోరుతో మన పోరు మొదలు పెట్టుదాం\n\nannalaara, dalita annalaara, maa yanna porannalaara\n\nadigi choodu aadilaabaadu kareemnagarulo kashta jeevulu\n\nbhoomi kosam bhukti kosam\n\nbariselettinaaru, baakulettinaaru\n\ndalita jeevula vimukti poru bhoomi poruto mudipadivundi\n\nkulaporu, varga poru kalsi poraadudaam\n\nbhooporuto mana poru modalu pettudaam\n\nBrothers, My Dalit brothers!\n\nBrothers, My Fighting brothers!\n\nAsk the hardworking people of Adilabad and Karimnagar\n\nFor land, for food\n\nThey raised spears, they raised knives\n\nThe fight for the liberation of Dalit lives\n\nIs tied to the struggle for land\n\nLet’s unite the struggles against caste and class\n\nLet’s begin our fight with the for land!\n\nO Laccha Gummadi: Women’s Life under Patriarchy\n\nAs with caste, Gaddar’s songs also displayed a new consciousness of gender in the 1980s. Many of his songs showed the influence of growing exposure to and influence by the Feminist movement in Telugu society. Prior to this time, Gaddar had depicted the oppression of women as a feature of class oppression. Songs of this type include Lacchamma under the Jasmine – Sirimalle Chettu Kinda Lacchammo, Come See me My Love – Bavayyo Vokkasaari Chusipovaa, The Bonalu Festival in Full Swing –Laskar Bonaalanta, and Sister You’ve Fixed Your Sari End on Your Waist – Kongu Nadumuki Chuttaave Chellamma.\n\nOne of the reasons for this might be that there were initially few women in Naxalite movement. From the 90s on however, a considerable number of women joined the revolutionary struggle. Learning from the Feminist movement, Gaddar composed many songs that highlighted patriarchy and the specific problems faced by women in Indian society. Some examples of these songs include: Oh Darling Laccha – O Lachagummadi, Women’s Lives – Aadolla Batuku, Mother I won’t Go – Amma Nenu Pone (on the anti-liquor movement), We are the Fire of the Beedi Cigarettes in Men’s Mouths – Mogolla Nollallo Beedilai Kaaletollam (on Beedi workers). Here is a verse from the widely beloved song, Oh Darling Laccha – O Lacchaagummaadi:\n\nనిండు అమావాస్య నాడు ఓ లచ్చా గుమ్మాడి\n\nఆడ పిల్ల పుట్టినదే ఓ లచ్చాగుమ్మాడి\n\nఅత్తా తొంగి సూడలేదు ఓ లచ్చాగుమ్మాడి\n\nమొగుడు ముద్దాడరాలేదే ఓ లచ్చాగుమ్మాడి\n\nnindu amaavaasya naadu o lacchaagummaadi\n\naada pilla puttinade o lacchaagummaadi\n\nattaa tongi soodaledu o lacchaagummaadi\n\nmogudu muddaadaraalede o lacchaagumaadi\n\nOn the deepest darkest moonless night, Ah darling laccha\n\nA girl child is born, Ah darling laccha\n\nThe mother-in-law did come to see her, Ah darling laccha\n\nThe husband did not kiss her, Ah darling laccha\n\nThis song movingly describes the despair of a mother over the birth of her daughter. The moonless night, a popular symbol of inauspiciousness, is brought in to highlight the social preference for male children. The mother-in-law and husband are figures of patriarchal authority. In this, Gaddar evoked the painful burden of patriarchy on a women, dehumanized from the very moment of their birth.\n\nDayyam Battindiro Naa Pendlaam Poralaku: Life after Globalization\n\nFrom independence until the early nineties, the Indian state was oriented – at least in principle – toward socialist ideals. However, the fall of the Soviet Union and a realignment of the global order saw India adopt a neoliberal orientation. The government began privatizing the public sector, pursuing the development of a market-based economy, and actively pursued a policy of globalization.\n\nMultinational companies in collaboration with transnational companies and Indian industrialists spread in Indian society in a powerful way. These transformations had a detrimental impact on the lives, cultures, and value systems of the people of third world countries, including India.\n\nDrawing attention to the neo-imperial dominance of the United States, Gaddar sang:\n\nఅదుగదుగో అదుగో సూడు\n\nఅమెరికో దోస్తుండు\n\nజపాన్ జెర్మనీ తోడు\n\nఅమెరికో దోస్తుండు\n\nబాంబుల సంచులతోని\n\nబందూకులు లోడు చేసి\n\nతల్లీ భారతి ఎదల మీద\n\nపాదాలు మోపిండు సూడు\n\nadugadugo! adugo soodu!\n\nameriko dostundu\n\njapaan jermanee todu\n\nameriko dostundu\n\nbaambula sanchulatoni\n\nbandookulu lodu chesi\n\ntallee bhaarati edala meeda\n\npaadaalu mopindu soodu!\n\nOver there! Look over there!\n\nLook at America plundering\n\nWith its cronies Japan and Germany!\n\nLook at America plundering!\n\nThey come with their bombs and bags\n\nThey’ve loaded their guns\n\nThey have stamped their feet\n\nOn the heart of Mother India, Look!\n\nThe American imperialist forcefully entered all spheres of life in third world nations. Consumerism became a new fact of life. In the early morning he came in the form of tooth paste, in the afternoon as Coca Cola, and in the evening as rum and whisky. To poison the consciousness of the masses, he broadcasted himself 24/7 in the form of Star TV and other forms of mass media. In Gaddar’s song, A Demon has Possessed My Wife and Kids – Dayyam Battindiro Naa Pendlaam Poralaku, he commented on the dangerous seductions of color television:\n\nకయ్యం బెట్టిందిరో\n\nకలర్ టివి ఇంట్లకొచ్చి\n\nదయ్యం బట్టిందిరో\n\nనా పెండ్లాం పోరలకు\n\nఈ టివి, జీ టివి, సన్ టివి\n\nస్టార్ టివి, టాటా టివి, బిర్లా టివి\n\nఅమెరికా, జపానోని\n\nఅందమైన టివి ననుకుంట\n\nఆడిస్తుంది ఇల్లునంత\n\nkayyam bettindiro\n\nkalar tivi intlakocchi\n\ndayyam battindiro\n\nnaa pendlaam poralaku\n\nee tivi, jee tivi, san tivi\n\nstaar tivi, taataa tivi, birlaa tivi\n\namerikaa, japaanoni\n\nandamaina tivi nanukunta\n\naadistundi illunanta\n\nColor TV entered our home\n\nAnd created a ruckus\n\nA demon has possessed\n\nMy wife and kids\n\nE tv, Zee TV, Sun TV\n\nStar TV, Tata TV, Birla TV\n\nPosing as the beautiful TVs\n\nOf America and Japan\n\nThe demon makes us all dance to its tune\n\nThe immediate effects of globalization were seen by the sudden rise of suicides among farmers and handloom workers. Gaddar’s song, The Paddy Fields Asked – Vori Selu Adiginayi, on the suicides of farmers is well known:\n\nవొరి సేలు అడిగినయ్\n\nనీరు బోసే రైతేడని\n\nపత్తి సేలు అడిగినయ్\n\nనెత్తురు జల్లే రైతేడని\n\nఅవి పట్టుకొని ఏడుస్తున్నయో ఎందుకో ఏమోగని\n\nఅవి పొర్లి పొర్లి ఏడుస్తున్నయో ఎందుకో ఏమోగని\n\nvori selu adiginayi\n\nneeru bose raitu eda ani\n\npatti selu adiginayi\n\nnetturu jalle raitu eda ani\n\navi pattukoni edustunnayo enduko emogani\n\navi porli porli edustunnayo enduko emogani\n\nThe paddy fields asked\n\nWhere is the farmer who waters me?\n\nThe cotton fields asked\n\nWhere is the farmer who sprinkles his blood?\n\nFor some reason, they grab me and weep\n\nFor some reason, they shudder and weep\n\nMatti Chetulu: Gaddar’s Social and Political Legacy\n\nGaddar’s songs have evolved in relation to the struggles of Indian, and specifically Telugu, society. Yet they have always remained popular and incisive. The image of “Muddy Hands” (Matti Chetulu) that he evokes in many of his songs is a fitting metaphor for the essence of his thought. These muddy hands are the source of all production and social existence. The image combines Marxist and Ambedkarite approaches to emancipation by centering “muddy people” (matti manushulu) – those who are treated as “dirty” due to their productive labor as well as the hierarchy of caste. These are the Dalits, Bahujans, and Adivasis of Indian society. They have been alienated from their very being through social institutions of class, caste, patriarchy, and the state.\n\nGaddar’s songs critique all existing social institutions. For him, the family is a mogoni raajyam (Man’s kingdom). Caste is a braahmana raajyam (Brahmin’s kingdom). The Indian state is an agrakula dopidi raajyam (Kingdom of upper caste exploitation).\n\nAlthough he began as a wandering performer in the model of older Telugu folk performers, Gaddar recognized the power of mass media. His songs spread far beyond his performances through the production of thousands upon thousands of lyric booklets, cassette tapes, and cds. In his later years, he began performing in Telugu cinema and appearing on cable news channels after globalization. More recently, Gaddar has been memorialized through social media platforms such as YouTube. Through his active engagement with mass media, his imagery, language, and songs and their radical messages have became known to new generations of Telugu speakers as well as wider middle-class audiences.\n\nGaddar intended his songs for working people and they were claimed as their collective wisdom. He has said that he took his songs from the life and cultural traditions of the people and was returning it to them by playing the role of effective communicator. His songs provide rich resource material of the struggles and culture of people who are left out of the official historical record. Gaddar’s life and his songs are a social and artistic document of revolution and resistance."
