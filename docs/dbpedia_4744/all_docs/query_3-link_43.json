So, SP advises his uncle to send him to his house so that he could mould him in a proper way. As per his advice, Srikumar and his close friend, who was also his car driver Yerrababu (Sunil) reach SP's house. A new girl Satyabhama (Sangeetha) joins the hostel and loses her heart to SP. Srikumar also loves Sandhya at first sight, which is against the wishes of SP. later, SP brings Sandhya to his home to keep her in safe custody in his house and throws out Srikumar and Yerrababu to the guesthouse. However, SP realises that Sandhya is also in love with Srikumar and accepts their love.

Then SP transfers his entire property in her name and tries to convince Srikumar's parents. When Srikumar's mother insists about the back history of Sandhya, he reveals that she is none other than his stepsister. During the engagement of Sandhya, Bhavani again surfaces and takes Satyabhama away from the function. But Bhama escapes from her house with the help of Srikumar.\n\nKhushi Khushigaa\n\nAt this juncture, Srikumar, Bhama and Yerrababu wanted to know why SP hates women, because there should be some strong story behind his hate on woman. They ask Maidanam (Dharmavarapu Subrahmanyam), who is staying with SP for some 20 years. They realise that SP and Bhavani were good friends and loved each other long ago. But some family disputes arise after Bhavani's father Neelakantham (Devan) cheated Rayudu (Bhanuchander), father of SP. He grabs their entire property, which SP was able to get back after a prolonged legal battle. Bhavani believes that her cousin brother was killed by Rayudu, but did not know the truth that Neelakantham himself killed him to take revenge on Rayudu. In fact, Rayudu has two wives. Sekhar (Bhanuchander) and Sandhya are the kids of his first wife, while SP and another daughter are the children of legal wife. Rayudu disowns his first wife fearing loss of prestige and Sekhar bores grudge against the entire family and leaves the house. SP's stepmother admits Sandhya in an orphanage and dies. From then onwards, SP starts looking after Sandhya's welfare. When Srikumar's parents were about to fix muhurat, Sekhar enters the scene and takes away Sandhya. As SP transfers his entire property on Sandhya's name, Sekhar throws away SP from his office at the behest of Sandhya. At the same time, he fixes her marriage against the latter's wishes. But SP, who was the well-wisher of Sandhya decides to get her married to Srikumar as per her choice and succeeds in his attempt. He finally teaches a lesson to Neelakantham and brings out the fact that his father is innocent and Neelakantham is the real culprit. Bhavani attempts suicide, but realises that SP remained a chronic bachelor because of his love towards her and joins him which forms the climax of the film.\n\nRelease Date: 22nd April 2004\n\nBanner: Nithya Movies\n\nPresenter: Vemireddy Venkata Reddy\n\nDirection: Relangi Narasimha Rao\n\nMusic: Koti\n\nStory: Relangi Kiran\n\nScreenplay: Relangi Narasimha Rao\n\nDialogues: Sankaramanchi Parthasarathi\n\nCinematography: V Jayaram\n\nProducer: K Yadagiri Reddy\n\nCast:\n\nAditya Om,\n\nRekha,\n\nVijay Sai,\n\nRevathi,\n\nJeeva,\n\nMS Narayana,\n\nBrahmanandam,\n\nAli,\n\nRaghu Babu,\n\nMallikharjuna Rao,\n\nVenu Madhav,\n\nAVS,\n\nGundu Hanumantha rao,\n\nKrishna Bhagawan,\n\nJenny and Telangana\n\nSakuntalaStory: Kanthamma (Telangana Sakuntala) is the grandmother of Swapna (Rekha) and Sundari\n\n(Revathy).

He has a younger look-a-like brother Satya Murthy (Nag again) in Hyderabad completing his engineering in computer science. Satya Murthy has a non-Telugu-speaking girl friend Sri (Shehnaz). Satya Murthy has a worrying factor now. His elder brother Surya Murthy has decided not to marry in his life. Hence Satya Murthy starts looking for a suitable bride for his elder brother. There he meets Vasundhara (Soundarya) at a temple and decides that she is the right choice for his elder brother. He approaches Vasundhara and asks her hand for marrying his elder brother. Later on, Vasundhara happen to observe the heroism and goodness in Surya Murthy when he comes to Hyderabad to meet Satya Murthy. Later on Vasundhara comes to know that Surya Murthy and Satya Murthy are the younger brothers of the man who married his elder sister Yamuna. Yamuna tells Vasundhara that Surya Murthy played a villain role in their life and he was instrumental in her husband dying after prolonged boozing due the compounding problems. She also tells that after her husband's demise, Surya Murthy forcibly took away her daughter Vaani. After coming to know about her elder sisters flashback, Vasundhara decides to take revenge by marrying Surya Murthy and then slowly destroy the entire family. She accepts the proposal of Satya Murthy to marry his brother Surya Murthy. Then they start doing a drama by making Vasundhara stay in the village of Satya Murthy and creating situations where Vasundhara saves Vaani from the perils. After the repetitive requests from his family members and Vaani, Surya Murthy marries Vasundhara. First step of Vasundhara after marriage was to postpone the first night by 22 days by bribing the priest. Then she transfers the money and jewelry to his sister's house with the help of a petty thief. But that thief runs away without giving jewelry to her sister and gets caught by the police. Meantime, Satya Murthy realizes the intentions of his bhabhi Vasundhara and explains her the flashback of Vaani and tells her that it was Yamuna who was a characterless lady. By the time Vasundhara realizes the fault of her, the thief was presented in the house of Surya Murthy and was interrogated about who give him jewelry. To save his bhabhi, Satya Murthy behaves in a strange manner and tells Surya Murthy that he wants his partnership in the property. He tells that he stolen the jewelry and want the thief to sell that off so that he can start his software business (all college passouts can get some ideas about putting a startup after watching this film). With that incident, the brothers split. The rest of the film is about how the brothers get united and decimate the villain gang."
