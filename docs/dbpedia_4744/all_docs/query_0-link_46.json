Sarma 265 Names and Addresses 413 Foreword v Foreword A country larger than the continent of Europe and with more ethnic, religious and linguistic diversities is bound to have problems staying together as one unit. Right from the day we achieved independence, foreign observers have been forecast- ing that India would soon break up into many sovereign states. When the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, which had fewer races, religions and languages, splintered into smaller states, doomsayers predicted that India would follow suit. Nothing of the sort has happened. Some fissiparous movements that started in the North Eastern states of Nagaland and Mizoram, and the demand for Khalistan, fizzled out. We have fought four wars with our neigh- bours. No attempt was made by any Indian group to take advan- tage of our military engagements with China or Pakistan to break loose from the Indian Union. On the contrary, with every confron- tation with a foreign power we reaffirmed our Indianness. We may be Adivasis, Mongoloid, Semitic, Dravidian or Aryan, but we are also Indian. We may not be able to converse with each other because we speak 18 different languages and more than 350 dialects, and our only common means of communication remains English spoken by no more than 2 % of the popula- tion, but we still remain Indian. Above all, though we often quarrel amongst ourselves, should any outsider pick up an issue with any one of us and threaten us with violence, we come to each other’s assistance, we feel that every Indian must stand by his countrymen. Despite our experiences over the last fifty years, fears of the country breaking up continue to haunt us. Periodically, noble-minded patriots like Baba Amte and others tour the country on foot or on bicycle to knit India together. Periodically, the National Integration Council comprising of the Prime Ministers, Chief Minister and leading intellectuals of the country meets in Delhi to take stock of the situation and chalks out programmes to combat forces which threaten our integrity. When the danger is past, people relax and the National Integration Council goes into deep slumber. Sivasankari’s venture to knit India through knowledge of each other’s literary heritage is bound to have a more lasting impact. Through her compilation readers will realise how much we share in common with our scriptures, classics of our many languages and, above all, how concerned writers and poets of today are, faced with the problems that beset our country: poverty, ignorance, caste, class and gender discrimination, challenges of modernity, resurgence of religious fundamentalism, bigotry, superstition, intolerance of other people’s beliefs, disrespect for the law, erosion of Gandhian values and proneness to violence. Sivasankari’s attempt to knit India is based on her conviction that novelists, short story writers and poets can and do change the way of thinking of an entire people. It is in pursuance of her faith in this vi Knit India Through Literature: The South mission that she invited me to write this foreword to the volume on South Indian literatures. I do not know any of these languages and only have superficial acquaintance, through English translations, with the works of some of the men and women listed by her. I learnt much from her probing interviews and feel that what had been as alien to me as Greek, is now well within my grasp. Telugu The geographical location of Andhra Pradesh has given its language Telugu some unique characteris- tics. Not only is Andhra in the heart of India, with its northern borders shared by Marathi, Hindi and Oriya speaking people, but its southern borders comprise states speaking Dravidian languages of which Telugu itself is one. Besides, for many centuries it was mled over by Muslim dynasties which patron- ised Urdu and Persian. In and around Hyderabad, the language of the common people is Dakhani Urdu. A good example of this hybrid culture is the poet C. Narayana Reddy. Mr. Reddy comes from a well-to-do agriculturist’s family. He is an educationist and was Vice- Chancellor of the Telugu University. He has also been the recipient of the Sahitya Akademi, the Jnanpith and Soviet Land awards. His first love in life has been, and is, poetry. “Poetry is my life’s breath”, he affirms. He has no strong views against composing songs for films because it is through these songs that he has gained wide acceptance among common people. Currently he is engaged in writing a poem of epic proportions on the holy Ganga, tracing it from its birth in the snowy Himalaya down to its end in the Bay of Bengal. By contrast, Ravuri Bharadwaja was bom and bred in poverty and received no formal education. From his boyhood he had to earn his own living doing odd jobs as a coolie, a shop assistant, a gate- keeper at a cinema house and, for many years, as an employee in the brothels of Guntur. Prostitutes gave him food, clothing and shelter. And when his eyesight began to fail, they gave him five rupees to have his glasses made. When receiving the Sahitya Akademi award, with its cheque of many thou- sands, he was asked whether this was the highest award he had got. He replied candidly, “No, it is this pair of spectacles the prostitutes bought for me. They are the epitomes of motherhood. Honestly, I want to be bom as Lakshmi’s (his chief patroness) son in my next birth.” As would be expected, Bharadwaja’s stories are based on his experiences of stark poverty, which he recalls with tears of nostalgia. A few have been made into films. He has a down-to-earth attitude towards life. He was working for All India Radio when Mrs. Gandhi imposed the Emergency. Though he strongly disapproved of it, he praised it. “What to do. Madam?” he told Sivasankari, “Posing as a dog, one has to bark. I had accepted to play the role of Ravana.” Bharadwaja was an atheist. His poetry won many admirers, including a well-to-do businessman, who gave him his daughter in marriage. It was a happy union which gave Bharadwaja four sons and a daughter. On his wife’s death he turned to religion for solace. He rues the degeneration of values in Indian life. The whole country has become one big slum. “Our legislative assemblies and Parliament are but political slums, our universities are educational slums and our government an administration slum.” This is the theme of his next novtl, Market Place. “I sell my sons, I buy my sons-in-law,” he says. His motto in life is, “Lack of money is not poverty; lack of love and sympathy is the worst kind of poverty.” Seshendra Sharma comes from a prosperous farming family and his wife, Indira Devi, is the daugh- ter of Raja Dhanraj Girji of Hyderabad. His passion is poetry and the Indianness of India which he calls Foreword vii “Indianity”. He was Municipal Commissioner for many years and regularly visited the slums of the city. In one area he found poor children scavenging for left-over food thrown out by a hotel: they were like flies on a garbage dump. That experience became the theme of his writing. His major work is My Country, My People. He translates his books into English himself and is quite happy with the outcome. He has had his share of troubles with his readers; some of them took him to court in charges of obscen- ity. The case was dismissed. Bhaghavatula Sadasiva Sankara Sastri who writes under the name ‘ Amdra’ lived through the Razakar agitation and the integration of Hyderabad into India. He narrates an incident that took place on a railway journey when the Razakars were on the rampage. A woman passenger suddenly stood up and took off all her clothes. When the men told her not to expose herself so shamelessly, she rebuked them for being unmanly. She had been stripped naked and molested by Razakar hoodlums. What kind of men were they? The message went home and remained imprinted in Amdra’s memory. It became the theme of his novel Thvamevaham. Like many other poets, Arudra composes lyrics and songs for films. Hardly any Telugu writer can make his ends meet by creative writing of his own choice. Malati Chendur was only six months old when she lost her father. She was taught by her mother. When she was 16, as was the custom, she was given in marriage to her mother’s brother. The couple lived for many years in Chennai, where she taught herself Tamil, Hindi and English. She rues the baneful effect of films and the hankering after money that has overtaken the present generation. Vasireddi Seetha Devi, author of forty novels, recipient of literary awards, including the Sahitya Akademi Award, and honorary doctorates from universities, stands apart from other Telugu writers. She was bom in a tiny hamlet in an orthodox Hindu family which did not believe in educating girls or letting them out of the home till they were married off. Seetha Devi rebelled against all that, left home to pursue her studies and refused to get married. She did her M.A. in Madras, became a teacher and started writing in Hindi and Telugu. On the formation of Andhra Pradesh, she shifted to Hyderabad where she lives today — still a spinster. Like most Telugu writers, Seetha Devi sympathised with the Naxalites. Her novel Marichika was banned till the High Court lifted the ban in 1982. Seetha Devi, like other creative artists, is obsessed with the passage of time and death. Since the age of seven she has been thinking about it. “What is death? What happens to a person after he dies? What is life? Where does it come from? Where does it go?” she asks. “Many of them may not have answers; but that is alright. I am happy that my thoughts grew along these lines.” Kannada The six writers Sivasankari has chosen from modem day Kannada literature have only two things in common: all were bom and raised in Karnataka and all of them achieved recognition by way of awards. Their backgrounds, however, are as different as could be: some come from affluent Brahmin families, others were bom in poverty-stricken families of low castes. What is remarkable is that whatever labels, like ‘progressive’ and ‘romantic’ are affixed to them, and no matter what castes they belong to, their anguish at the injustices done to fellow citizens of lower castes comes out strongly in their writings. Unfortunately very few of them have been translated into English and most of us who cannot read vlii Knit India Through Literature: The South Kannada are only familiar with the works of men like Girish Kamad (not included in this anthology) and U.R. Anantha Murthy. All we know of the others are their names because of the honours bestowed on them by the Sahitya Akademi or because they have been recipients of the Jnanpith Award. The 97-year-old Sivaram Karanth who had both the Sahitya Akademi and the Jnanpith awards conferred on him, has made an enormous contribution to Kannada literature through encyclopaedias for children and his operatic stage plays Yakshagana which convey his message through- impromptu dia- logue, song and dance. “Communication is the essence of literature,” he told Sivasankari. “When a writer communicates with his readers through his literature, he writes to tell him that which he knows and also that which he does not know.” Karanth is a Gandhian and, like Gandhi, draws inspiration from the Gita and is committed to telling the tmth. “It is only when the pen writes the truth that it is mightier than the sword. The pen today seems to spit only poison. It is grossly misused,” he says. When asked “Do you believe in God?”, this patriarch coming to the end of his days replied candidly that at one time he did, but “now, there is nothing. Life is akin to light. The light should be such that it sheds brightness not just for us but others too. A life that is not prepared to learn is without essence, without meaning. Life continues to teach us till the very end”. Sivasankari describes her dialogue with U.R. Anantha Murthy as being “like reading soulful poetry”. He and Kamad are the two Kannadigas best known to the English-speaking world. Anantha Murthy is known through his novel Samskara which is available in English and he is the Chairman of the Sahitya Akademi. Samskara is clear evidence that the wretched lot of the Harijans caused as much anguish to Brahmins like Anantha Murthy as it did to those who suffered. For him the entire concept of untouchability is a monstrous perversion. “Touch is a means of sensitive contact between two people,” he told Sivasankari. “If the touch is not blessed by understanding and care, it has no meaning. Touch and sex are like religion. They have the capacity to create as well as destroy. Life is like that.” Subramanya Raja Urs, who writes under the pseudonym ‘Chaturanga’ is the son of a prosperous Brahmin farmer. By way of contrast„Devanoor Mahadeva is the son of a Harijan police constable who had three wives and children through all of them. When Devanoor failed his school exam, his father locked him in a cell to force him to study. Instead, the boy wrote his first short story. He also believes that the prime duty of a writer is to communicate. “A writer is a creator. If a creator has to explain his creation, then why write?” Perhaps the most colourful of the Kannada writers is S.L. Bhyrappa. He calls his father a vagabond. He inherited his genes from him. Almost the entire family was wiped out in an epidemic of bubonic plague. When he was only 14 he had to carry the corpse of his seven-year-old brother and cremate it. He had to beg for his food, work as gatekeeper at a cinema, travel without a ticket, work as a cook’s assistant, teach himself cooking, act in small plays until he reached Bombay where he cooked food for tongawalas. Then he joined a band of sadhus and ultimately returned to Mysore to resume his studies, paying his fees by selling joss sticks. He topped in his class but was denied a scholarship because he was a Brahmin. Boys from backward castes who wore gold watches and visited prostitutes got State stipends. His experience did not embitter him. He went on to get a doctorate for his thesis on Truth and Beauty. He fell in love with a Christian girl but did not marry her because her parents insisted on his converting to Christianity. This became the theme of his xiowoLDharmasree. With justification he claims, My writings are bom of in depth experience. They reflect the tmth. There is no drama.” Foreword ix Malayalam Kerala claims one hundred per cent literacy; it is a long way ahead of any other State in wiping out ignorance amongst its people. Understandably, it also has the largest readership. Malayalam journals have huge circulations. Its top authors enjoy enormous prestige and earn more in royalties in sale of their books than writers or poets from any other part of India. Sivasankari has interviewed seven of its outstanding men and women of letters. The doyen of Malayalam writers is Thakazhi Sivasankaran Pillai, old, silver-haired and somewhat hard of hearing. He lives with his family in the village in which he was bom. Endowed with a dozen literary awards and honorary doctorates, he refuses to convey messages in his writings. “A writer should also be an artist ... it will automatically shape his readers’ thinking,” he says. “Study life to observe life. Live with life and do justice to life,” he tells young writers. As a young man he was a Marxist and a rationalist. “I denied God,” but now, “I don’t disbelieve in God,” he admits. He is a man fulfilled. “I truly do not have any regrets,” he affirms. To the English-speaking world perhaps the best known Malayali writer is Madhavi Kutty, better known by her nom de plume, Kamala Das. “I speak three languages, write in two and dream in one,” she says in her usually enigmatic style. “The language I speak is mine.” She shocked prudes by her explicit portrayal of sexuality. She admits, “I have sketched my two dimensional nudity on the sheets of weeklies, monthlies and quarterlies.” Kamala Das had poetry in her genes, her mother being an acknowledged poet. While non-Malayalis know her as a writer of fiction, she is better known in Kerala as a poet. Despite the success that has come to her, she retains a chip on her shoulder when it comes to men. “They are predisposed to hating me because I am a woman,” she asserts. Widely read and enjoying a wide readership himself is M.T. Vasudevan Nair. He has his roots firmly embedded in the soil of his village. “I have heard about mighty oceans — but I am closer to the stream that flows through my village,” he says. He wanted nothing else than to be a writer and has been writing since he was 14. “A writer should have an obsession to write,” he affirms. “He must have the magnet- ism and the magic. When these two combine, good work will come out of it.” He thinks that Malayalam has produced as good literature as any language of the world. A highly respected name in modem Malayali writing is that of Vaikkom Mohammed Basheer. His life has been as colourful as his writing. Bom in poverty, bred as a vagabond, he joined a band of naked Digambar Jain sadhus as well as the Communists. He was jailed seven times. He took to drinking heavily and had to be hospitalised. He wrote of his experiences, baring his soul to his readers. Like many creative artists he had an obsession with death. With difficulty he kicked his addiction to alcohol: “Refinement is very important for a writer. Alcohol opens one door only, that of destmction.” It is all there in his novel. The World Of The Mad. Thirtyfive-year-old Balachandran Chullikad and Vijaya Lakshmi are a husband-and-wife team of poets. Perhaps it was poetry that brought them together. He feels passionately about it. “Poetry was religion to the older poets, their first and last God.” He feels the present generation of poets are not as dedicated to their craft; they do not work hard enough. There has to be a lot of ground- work done before a good poem takes shape. “If you want a coconut tree of your own, you have to plant the seedling six years ahead,” he says. Young Sethu has an interesting observation on why Malayali writing is different from that of the languages of northern India. “In Kerala, writers were not exposed to turbulent situations, unlike writers Knit India Through Literature: The South in Bengal and Punjab, who faced traumatic situations like invasions and communal wars after inde- pendence.” When asked, “Does turbulence help a writer to express himself?” he replied “Of course; otherwise you are creating things out of artificial situations, out of a vacuum.” Sethu believes that a writer should be true to himself and not pander to popular tastes. He should influence his readers, not the readers influence him. Sugatha Kumari is the only other woman in Sivasankari’s compilation. She is a poet. Her father gave away most of what he had to the freedom movement and the family survived on her mother’s salary as a teacher. Sugatha involved herself in movements to preserve the environment, notably the agitation over Silent Valley. “A creative writer can achieve much more than an academic in moulding public opinion,” she says. Because of her writings, hundreds of small environmental groups came up all over the state. She has strong views about writing for popular amusement. ‘Entertaining writing is on the increase. We call it pulp writing.” She also shares Kamala Das’s apprehension about the status of women in Indian society. “We women are scared of society. We are all immersed in our family prob- lems, and ourselves. We don’t have the time. And we don’t dare to write. We are cowards.” She strongly believes in Gandhism and is convinced it has all the answers to problems of population and degradation of the environment. Tamil Tamil enjoys the unique distinction of being the oldest indigenous language of India, as old if not older than Sanskrit, with a literary heritage going back more than 2000 years. It is spoken by over 60 million Indians and by the Tamils of Sri Lanka and Singapore where they run radio and TV services of their own, and by Tamilian communities in West Africa, Great Britain, Canada and the United States. Tamil language newspapers and journals have large circulations, and so do some weeklies like Ananda Yikatan and Kumudam. They provide established writers and those in the making an opputrtunity to make contact with the masses. There are many Tamil publishing houses which give poets, novelists and short-story writers the opportunity of offering their work to discerning readers. Tamilians were also exposed to external influences earlier than the other Indians. The English set up their first base in Tamil Nadu. So did the French, who retained their conclave in Pondicherry till Inde- pendence. Both French and English poets and writers were widely read by educated Tamils. And all through the centuries friendly, and at times not-so-friendly, rivalry continued between champions of Sanskrit and those of Tamil. Sanskrit was regarded as the language of the Brahmins and of Aryan origin; Tamil as the language of non-Brahmins, Dravidas and lower castes of Dra vidian origin. It was Namaskar versus Vanakkam. At times the controversy became so fierce that it crossed the limits of civilised debate. But it has to be conceded that if the attempt to impose Hindi as the national language of India failed, it was only due to the dogged opposition of the Tamilians. Tamil Nadu has given India many poets, novelists and journalists who made their mark in their own mother-tongue as well as in Indo-Anglian literature. They are too many to be enumerated here. Tamil happens to be the first language of the compiler of the ‘Knit India ’ series. Sivasankari also belongs to this small band of Tamilians who made her name as a writer in Tamil as she did with her books in English. She has made a niche for herself in the Hall of Fame of Tamilian literati as well as the common people through her highly-rated chat shows on radio and television. She has chosen seven Foreword xi leading Tamilian writers to interview. Six of them are recipients of awards from the Sahitya Akademi and other literary bodies and all are widely read. Her questions elicit their views on important literary trends, the role of women writers, Dalit literature and future prospects. Abdul Rahman, bom in 1937 in the holy city of Madurai, was an academic. After 29 years of teaching in a college, he took to writing as a full-time occupation. His father taught Urdu and Persian in a school. Rahman picked up these languages at home and translated leading Urdu poets, like Allama Iqbal, and ghazals from Urdu into Tamil. He has also composed haikus in Tamil. He concedes that Tamil writing was spurred by racial pride in its conflict with Aryan brahminical Sanskrit. Tamil was more receptive to Prakrit and Pali than it was to Sanskrit. During Mughal dominance it also imbibed Persian influences and vocabulary. The acclaim Rahman won in literary circles shows that there is nothing rigid in the Tamilian’s approach to outside influences. Rahman is candid in admitting that in every human being there are two persons in perpetual conflict. “There are two men within me,” he writes, “one a singer, the other a lunatic ... the two don’t see eye to eye, they are poles apart.” Samuthiram (b. 1944) comes from a tiny hamlet at the southernmost end of Tamil Nadu, close to Kanniyakumari. He was the posthumous child of a poor farmer and spent his childhood in extreme poverty watching his young, widowed mother being maltreated by her mother-in-law and other rela- tions. He went through school and college and became headmaster of a primary and then a higher secondary school. He went on to become a supervisor of co-operatives and then an officer of Panchayats. He is today Joint Director in the Tamil Nadu Government’s Directorate of Advertising. Samuthiram began his literary career by writing poetry. Then he went on to write short stories and novels. He is distressed by the baneful effects of T.V. and cinema on the younger generation. His early writing was about family relationships. Over the last five years he has been writing about the problems of Tamilians and Tamil Nadu. “The Tamilian has become like a fly which tastes cinema which is like honey and now he has fallen into it. Its wings are honey-soaked and it can no longer fly.” Indeed, one has to visit Tamil Nadu and see for oneself how cinema- and filmstar-obsessed the Tamilian masses have become. Prapanchan was born and brought up in Pondicherry. At Karandai college he was invested with the title of Pandit. He has been both a teacher and a journalist. He now lives in Chennai. His works have been translated in European languages. Despite his early years in a French colony and being the son of a toddy merchant, Prapanchan imbibed very little from French literature, apart from Maupassant, or from the writings of Sri Aurobindo who lived most of his life there. He was emotionally more affected by ‘Suya Mariyathai lyakkam’, The Self Respect Movement against the Brahmin domination. It was initially led by the Mudaliars and financed by the Chettiars, but soon embraced all Dravidas. Periyar gave it a Marxist and anti-religious slant. Prappnchan’s entry into the world of letters was amusing. He was enamoured of a girl and wrote a love letter to her. The letter fell into his father’s hands. Far from reprimanding his son for having amorous designs on the girl, he ticked him off for clumsy writing. Prapanchan converted the incident into a short story which was published in Deepam. He was then only 14 years old. Prapanchan is an ambitious man. “I would like to do something that the would make the world sit up and take notice. I have plans to write a few novels. I am thinking of writing a book which would fully portray this century, its degradation in values and their redemption,” he says. Ponneelan (b. 1940) works in the Directorate of School Education. He has written travelogues, short stories, biographies and has translated English novels into Tamil. He describes himself as a progressive xii Knit India Through Literature: The South and a Marxist. To appreciate something beautiful you have to have the faculty to see its beauty. “Man’s inner self is as large as the Universe,” he maintains. “Everything that is present in the universe is present in miniature in every individual. We express only that which is externally present. One cannot express that which is not present in the universe. Hence, that which is external blossoms into the internal. Marxian aesthetics aim at creating such a view.” There must have been a spectacular turnaround in Ponneelan’s life. He comes from a family of temple priests. Though moderately educated in Tamil, his mother taught herself Hindi, English and Malayalam and encouraged her son to become a writer. He is a prolific writer. His prize- winning novel Pudhiya Darisanangal runs to 2000 pages. Indira Parthasarathy was bom in Kumbakonam in 1930. He has been a teacher and has lived in Delhi, Poland and Canada. He maintains that the concept of Dravidianism is of British origin. After the Germans introduced Sanskrit to Europe, the English dubbed South Indian languages as Dravidian. Indira Parthasarathy comes from a prosperous land-owning family conforming to orthodox Vaishnavism. His father was a Sanskrit scholar. He explains why he took on the feminine name Indira. His real name is Ranganathan. His wife was bedridden. In order to cheer her up, he wrote a short story under her name. It was published in Ananda Vikatan. The name Indira stuck to him like a good-luck charm. Parthasarathy is a motivated writer. “My purpose in writing is to create an awareness among people about social problems and inequalities,” he writes. And adds, “That does not mean I should also serve as a physician and prescribe a cure.” His first novel was about the decadence of social life in Delhi. He did not bother to prescribe means to improve it. He defines the aim of literature as something “which creates an impact on man’s mind, that which improves his thinking”. Rajam Krishnan was bom in a small town, Musiri, in 1925. She did not get much formal education but showed interest in literature. She did not write about what she learnt but about what she experi- enced in life. She believes that a writer should analyse the ills of society and suggest cures for them. Inevitably, discrimination practised against women in a male-dominated society provides her with her themes as much as caste-discrimination which triggered off the Dravida Movement. Rajam Krishnan is one of the six children of her father who was a mathematics teacher. She was married off at 15. Her first story to be published was written in English. Rajam Krishnan is a card-bearing member of the Communist Party. Through her writings she aims to reach women, who form the majority of her readers in Tamil Nadu. “Written words should be like a broom that sweeps dirt away,” she says, quoting Malayali poet Sugatha Kumari. The celebrated writer and intellectual Jayakanthan is considered one of the all-time greats among Tamil short story writers. Bom in 1934 in Cuddalore, Jayakanthan has not had much of a formal education and can best be described as a self-made personality. A very well-read man, Jayakanthan’s writing has been shaped largely by his own personal experiences and his extensive reading of some of the world’s best literature. “The belief that no stories of literary quality can be read in Tamil magazines was wiped out by me. The readers and the editors duly acknowledged that. During the first half of the century many writers by their stories elevated Tamil literature and themselves to the level of world literature. I am one among them,” Jayakanthan says. Yet he feels compelled to add, “While literature can be a good companion to man, he cannot depend on it for everything”. The purpose of literature, according to Jayakanthan, should be to create a oneness among human beings and allow them to live in unity amidst their various differences. Foteword xiii Sivasankari’s efforts do not end with the South Indian languages There is more to come There are compilations of her interviews with writers from the languages of the North, East and West. If the present effort is any indication, the books to come will prove just as illuminating and exhaustive with their m-depth analysis of the subject matter at hand Every section of the book is reflective of Sivasankan’s painstaking effort and her deep commitment to the project As she has said in her preface, it is a tragedy that we Indians are largely unaware of the literary treasures found in the vanous languages of our country, even as we dwell at length on the ments and dements of foreign literature Apart from introducing readers to the cultures and traditions of their fellow-citizens and promoting a sense of oneness, this effort is bound to go a long way in furthering their knowledge of literature too Sivasankan has said in her preface that she would not be so presumptuous as to imagine that national integration can be achieved by her project alone And yet she should not discount the immense contri- bution that her ‘Knit India through Literature’ project is certain to make to the cause Her aspiration certainly deserves to be lauded as the first step she is taking in her effort to cement the unity and integrity of our nation The journey is long, but, then, she is a seasoned traveller I wish her all the best in her passage down this long, winding path and am confident that she will achieve her objective with great success Kliushwant Singh New Delhi June 1997. xiv Knit India Through Literature: The South Preface A s a young girl, I had often heard my mother narrate this little tale: Once upon a time there was a kind-hearted girl who lived in a small village. The girl was a poor orphan, but she always wanted to help people around her. While saying her prayers one night, she wished for a money-bearing tree that would allow her to help a lot more people. When she woke up the next morning, she found a huge tree near her little hut. Instead of fruits, the tree bore gold coins. Passers-by wondered who had sown the seed from which the tree had sprouted. The girl had no answer to the question, but she continued to pluck the coins and distribute them to people around. As a result, poverty was removed from her land. Thinking back on this story, I feel that the latter half of it in particular describes my own situation quite accurately. I do not know who sowed in me the seed that has today grown into the ‘Knit India through Literature’ project. But, blessed with the right type of soil, water and fertiliser, the seed has grown into a huge tree that abounds with fragrant flowers and luscious fruit. Yet, I do not want to enjoy them all by myself; but I would rather share this bounty with my countrymen. Even as I sit down with pen in hand to write this preface, I beget memories of bygone times. About ten years ago I was in Mysore, to participate in a literary meet that attempted to analyse a novel written by a Black American woman writer. Around twenty writers from different parts of the country had gathered there to analyse the work in minute detail. Dwelling on the discussions on my journey back, I was suddenly struck by the incongmity or irony of the whole situation. While we had sufficient knowl- edge of world literature — Black, Latin- American or European — to be able to thoroughly analyse it, we were woefully unaware of our very own literary treasures. Let alone the people, even our learned writers do not have much of a knowledge of the literary works in Indian languages other than their own! What could be the reason for this? The fact that there had not been much effort to translate literary works into other languages could be a possible reason. Was it this thought that sowed the seed for the ‘Knit India through Literature’ project in me? Thinking back, I believe that may well be the case. On yet another occasion, when I was in Sikkim for a writers’ meet, I found that the writers who had congregated there had heard about Tamil Nadu’s idli/sambar (a traditional breakfast food) and her silks but knew next to nothing about her literature. This had quite an impact on me. There is also Preface xv another aspect to this issue. While it is true that others do not know much about us, isn’t, it also a fact that we know hardly anything about them? Calcutta is synonymous with rasagullas, Rajasthan with marble and Kerala with coir. How much do we Indians know about the literature created in States other than our own, and what sort of an effort have we made to get to know their traditions, their customs, their joys and sorrows? I am not saying that there haven’t been any cultural exchanges amongst us at all. A dweller of Kasi (Varanasi) may name his son ‘Ramnath’ after the presiding deity in the southern temple town of Rameswaram. Or a Tamil girl could be named ‘Vaishnavi’ after the goddess who dwells in the foothills of the Himalayan ranges. Meera Bhajans are sung in the South and Kathakali is performed in Delhi. Religious, cultural or even political links have been established over time. But are they sufficient to strengthen the unity and integrity of our nation? What is the role of literature in this effort to ‘knit’ people together? Very many years ago our former President Dr. S. Radhakrishnan said that while it may be written in different languages, Indian litera- ture is one. Does his belief hold good today? How many Indians know of the Assamese writer Birendra Bhattacharya, Karnataka’s Sivaram Karanth or West Bengal’s Mahasweta Devi who are till today engaged in efforts to enrich their people’s thought processes? Should not language function as a bridge to introduce people to their treasured heritage? It is probably these questions and thoughts that have nurtured the seed of the ‘ICnit India’ project within me. Plagued by all these questions, I continuously wondered if I could do something about it. India is an ancient land We are its citizens United we will all live Divided we will all fall Inspired by these words of the turban-clad Tamil poet Bharati, I began work on the ‘Knit India through Literature’ project four years ago.This literary tree, that this volume is the first part of, is what grew from the seed, I began nurturing from that time. The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 18 languages official languages. This project’s goal has been to learn more about the culture, history and literature of the people of each state and introduce them to their fellow Indians through the works of a few writers selected from each of these languages. The ultimate aim is to publish the analysis in four volumes. When I attempted to implement my plans I was beset by several doubts. Would it be possible for a single woman to go alone to Manipur and Kashmir to meet writers? How could I anange the finance required for the project? Would it be possible for a lone individual to function on three planes simulta- neously — could I, while engaged in the preparations for one language, I travel for another language and also translate yet another language? Before long I became thoroughly demoralised when both the Central Government and other organisations that claimed to support the cause of national integration turned down my request for financial assistance. While they praised my project, saying that it was unique and innovative, they also said that their rules did not permit them to support my efforts finan- cially. I also had to contend with the indifference of some writers, who did not respond to repeated letters, and literary organisations which did not provide me with information I needed. But somehow the ‘plant’ within me continued to grow. XVI Knit India Through Literature: The South If today this first volume of Knit India through Literature is in your hands, it is entirely due to the grace of God and the good wishes of many kind souls. And even as I write these lines, the second volume, on the eastern languages, is just about ready to go to print and I have started meeting the writers of the western languages for the third volume.. Since I felt that it would distract my attention from the ‘Knit India’ project, I have put my fiction writing on hold. I am not sad about this. For the awareness and knowledge I have gained from my experiences over the last four years, meeting with the writers in ten languages and journey through their states, to get to know the people and their traditions, has been tmly amazing. I sometimes wonder at my good fortune and I am increasingly eager to share with my fellow Indians the knowledge I have gained. I think I should elaborate here on the ways and means by which I went about choosing suitable writers in each language. First, I wrote to literary associations and leading magazines asking them to identify prominent writers in each language. From the replies, I picked out the common names, corre- sponded with them and followed this up with personal interviews. I can assure you that this literary bridge, built with the help of worthy litterateurs, is truly strong. As far as possible, I have tried to include the views of the younger generation as well. Some of the writers I have met for this project are quite old. And yet their memory, commitment and clarity of thought and speech amazed me. If I had the required facilities, I would have video-taped all the interviews. As of now, I have confined myself to photographs and audio tapes. The interview I had with the renowned Malayalam writer Vaikkom Mohammed Basheer needs special mention. He was stricken by illness but still maintained a cheerful countenance and readily obliged with a fairly long interview. Just months later, he passed away. When I think of this I really regret not having been able to video tape my interviews with these ‘walking encyclopaedias’ . I have attempted to use the writers’ very own words when recording their responses to my questions. If there are no answers to some questions, it is because the writers in those instancedid not allot time for me despite my repeated requests. I have included a short travelogue of each State before going on to the interviews with the writers of the language of the State. Since the objective of this work is to introduce Indians, to their fellow Indians living in other States, I have included these essays as bait to draw them into the literary experience. If even just a few of my readers become desirous of knowing more about the people, the language and the literature of any of these States after reading my interviews, I will be extremely happy at having achieved my objective. There is a Tamil saying about an entire village coming together to draw the temple chariot. I think this project is a perfect example of that. Although I functioned as an individual, if I had not had the support of my fellow writers and many others, my dream of knitting Indians through literature would not be a reality today. Many of you might wonder if national integration can be fostered merely by publishing these four volumes. No, I certainly don’t have any such Utopian ideas. I am aware that we have miles to go before we reach our goal and only wish that this effort helps us cover at least the first few miles of our long journey. I quote an incident from the Ramayana here. All of you, I am sure, know about the contribution made by the squirrels when Rama was building the Sethu bridge to get to Lanka. Each squirrel dipped its body in the ocean, came back to roll on the sands, went back to the site where the bridge was being built and to shook the sand off its body. Thus Preface xvn was accumulated enough sand for the badge to be built Although their efforts cannot compare with that of those mighty Hanuman, they did contnbute. I wish to be like the squirrel and chip in with my own effort ‘Knit India through Literature’ — to help preserve the unity and integrity of our great country This IS the land of my forefathers Where they lived and loved happily This IS the ancient land where Our forefathers have lived for thousands of years This IS the land in which they flourished With their diverse and rich thoughts Keeping this in mind How can I not praise my land.

then threw his axe which fell into the sea and Kerala, a land shaped like the axe, was born Hence the name ‘Parasurama Kshetram Another version ol the origin of Kerala is that it was the land of Emperor Mahabali whowas lespon- sible for Loid Vishnu taking the Vamana avatar When Lord Vishnu in his Vamuna avatar asked Mahabali to grant him three feet of land, he took the visvarupam and covered the earth and the skies in two strides When he demanded the third length of land, Mahabali requested the Loid to place it on his head Appreciating his piety and aware of his populaiity with the people, the Lord granted him a boon to visit his land once a year It is MahabalTs visit every year that is celebrated as Onam There aie many who take pride in this particular story of their land Histonans point out that Kerala, as it is known today, had close links with toieign lands 900 years before the birth of Christ When King Solomon’s palace m Babylon had to be decorated, ivory ts said to have been exported from here Also, when Queen Sheba moved into Jerusalem, the .vpices and .san- dalwood that she took with her came from the ‘Spice Coast’, now known as Kerala Since pepper was used

shillings in 1599, the Bntish formed the East India Company m protest It has even been mentioned m jest that it was a small peppercorn which changed the fate of the vast Indian subcontinent If we take a look at the history of the land, without considering the foreign influence, we will find that Kerala was ruled by the Cheras for a long time It is believed that since it was the land of the Cheras it was called ‘Cheralam’, a name that was later modified to ‘Keralam’ sfc sjv I was SIX years old when I first visited Kerala A good friend of my father’s lived m a place called Aluva I cannot ever forget the wonderful times we had in the month we spent in his house as a part of the family It was a bungalow with a tiled roof All around there were trees laden with jack fruit, coconut and betelnut Mango trees stood here and there The thick green leaves of the jack fruit trees formed a tent of sorts and allowed hardly a glimpse of the sky when we looked up The steps in the backyard led to a gurgling over In the morning, we would apply oil to our heads and go down to the river as a group The older people would immerse themselves neck-deep m the water and indulge in chitchat or would sing songs We children would pretend to learn swimming and paddle our hands and legs m the water. After the two hour long bath we would eat red nee, native to Kerala, with papads, a curry made of green bananas and yam, and banana and j ack fruit chips Even as we finished our lunch, we would be ready for our siesta By the time we woke up in the evening, we would be ready to bathe m the nver again Once in two days, we would get into a boat and visit nearby places like Kaladi and Ambalapuzha When I recall the thnU I felt as I first stepped on Kaladi soil, the home of the great seer and saint Adi Sankara, and the divine taste of the Ambalapuzha pal payasam (a custard-like sweet), I still feel a deep sense of contentment. Recently I undertook trips to several parts of Kerala I had not visited earlier, for the ‘Knit India through Literature’ project and I am greatly relieved to note that, apart from a big town or two, the small towns and villages retain the same fertility and simplicity I had seen before Less than a kilometre outside any town m Kerala, you are enclosed in verdant greenery provided by mango orchards, cashew plantations, jack fruit, coconut and betelnut groves and teak farms Glowing red hibiscus flowers grow alongside paddy fields laid out like green velvet carpets Little streams flow by the side of the road Houses capped with sloping red tiled roofs nestle close together with tiny tea shops that sell coffee and tea besides varieties of banana The Malayahs walk with umbrellas tucked under their arms. All these scenes, so typical of Kerala, often remind me of a painting' Of course, the stamp of prosperity that the state has gained after a section of its people went to West Asia to return with large sums of money, eannot be massed either The green, blue or p ink coloured bungalows that stand out like sore thumbs among the verdant surroundings are irritants When my writer fnend remarked “Dubai money” on seemg these bungalows, I could sense his di staste much hke a discordant note struck m the middle of a melodious music concert. Travelling through Kerala 3 Kerala was originally a part of the Madras Presidency. After the linguistic division of states in 1956, it was formed by combining the North Malabar, Cochin and Travancore provinces and ‘princely states’ . The Kovalam beach, 1 1 km from Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital, is listed among the ten most beautiful beaches in the world. The Padmanabhaswamy temple and the Sri Chitra Tirunal Art Gallery are my favourite places in Thiruvananthapuram. It is believed that this ancient temple was built at the beginning of Kaliyug! I was also informed that since the presiding deity at the temple is made of 1001 saligramams (stones), apart from mustard seeds and jaggery, no ablutions are performed for the idol. The paintings displayed at the Chitra Tirunal Art Gallery are exquisite. And yet it was quite disap- pointing to see the way the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma were stuffed into the various rooms. What a contrast to the beautiful way that the painting of Mona Lisa is displayed, complete with correctly angled lighting, at the Louvre in Paris. If only Ravi Varma’s paintings were similarly displayed, I am sure these paintings would attain greater fame worldwide. The town of Thirur (Thiruragandi) is 75km from Kozhikode, in Malapuram District. There is a monument here to the memory of Ezhuthachan, considered to be the father of Malay alam language. I had the opportunity to visit this place three times in the last four years. The first time was when the famous writer M.T. Vasudevan Nair, on learning that I was about to begin my work in Kerala for the ‘Knit India’ project, asked me to first seek the blessings of Ezhuthachan and, in fact, took me there himself. The monument which was nothing more than a mandapams or rooms, is in a place called ‘Thmjaiiparambu\\ When I held the narayam the stylus or the iron writing instrument used by Ezhuthachan, I felt an indescribable thrill. Last year, several writers were invited to participate in the anniversary celebrations of Ezhuthachan and I was one among them. I was amazed to see the develop- ment that has taken place at the memorial now that it is functioning under the chairmanship of Vasudevan Nair. At present it has a large library building, a hall for holding seminars and rooms to accommodate those writers who wish to stay there and continue with their literary work. The three days I stayed in Thirur helped me gain a new perspective of Kerala. I believe that at every annual Dassara celebration, Akshambhyasam (the pooja performed when children are first taught to write) is performed for about 3000 children! The fact that the entire village gathered around to celebrate the festival of the father of the language, just as they would celebrate a marriage in the family, is remarkable. The different varie- ties of Kerala food, that the villagers themselves cooked and served the writers with much love and concern, are sufficient proof of the d?ep interest the people have in the development of literature. The crowds that gathered to listen to the poetry or oratory of writers in other languages were also proof of the respect of the people for writers. As far as I have seen, this is a unique quality of Keralites. I was deeply impressed by the native and regional flavour in the celebration of most functions and festivals. It hardly matters if they are film or literary functions or those organised by associations like the Rotary Club. The coconut frond festoons, the rangoli drawings with flowers, rice grains filled in an ethnically carved wooden vessel with coconut flowers placed on top, and the presence of the panchavadyas (the five traditional musical instmments) form an essential part of any auspicious func- tion organised in Kerala. On the whole, the Keralites are a simple people. Their appearance, their traditions and practices also reflect this tradition of simplicity. Their appearance and their habits are indicative of the bounty of Mother Nature. It is common to see women belonging even to the wealthiest families clothed in a simple mundu (a white length of cloth tied around the waist) with their wet hair loosely knotted, their foreheads marked with sandalwood paste. Their only jewellery would be a pair of gold ear rings and a 4 Knit India Through Literature: The South thin chain around their necks. The men too dress simply in a dhoti and shirt. Some wear dhotis withzun work. They sport thick moustaches and smoke beedis. Palakkad District, which was once a part of Madras Presidency, has a high percentage of people of Tamil origin. If we move south from Palakkad, we reach Thrissur, the cultural capital of Kerala. The Sahitya, Sangeeta and the Lalit Kala Academis function from here. The locals are proud of the fact that one of the Thrissur rulers, Appan Thamburan, gave his own palace to store priceless literary works. The pilgrim centre Guruvayur, is 40 km from this town. The idol of Krishna as a child, the Lord who was sung to by Narayana Namboodiri, is a sight to behold by the light shed by hundreds of oil lamps. The temples in Kerala are all very clean and it is to be appreciated that artificial lights are present only in the outer corridors and the darshan of the Lord in the sanctum sanctorum can be had only in the light of oil lamps. Kalamandalam, set up by the well known poet Vallathol Narayana ‘Kavi’, is 25 km away from Thrissur. High quality training in Kathakali, Mohiniattam and other traditional dances and also train- ing in traditional instruments of defence and music are provided at this institute. There is an observation that the reason Kerala has the highest literacy and family planning rates is because they followed (even now to some extent) the matriarchal system or marumakka thayam. The system is known as taravad and is a practice of the Nair community. Among the Namboodiris, a high caste group, the eldest son is expected to marry a Namboodiri girl; the other sons are allowed to have relationships with Nair girls. When a Namboodiri male comes to the house of a Nair girl, he leaves his sword or footwear outside the house to indicate his presence inside. If the Nair woman wishes to end the relationship, she merely has to throw the footwear into the court- yard. The children bom out of such an association stay with the mother and this was how the taravad and the matriarchal system, came into practice. Goddess worship, or offering prayers to Devi, has an important place among Keralite rituals. Crowds throng the temples of female deities like Kodungallur Bhagavati, Chengannur Bhagavati and Chottanikara Bhagavati. The history of the Kodungallur Amman temple links it with Tamil Nadu. It is said that the mler Cheran Chenguttuvan had a temple built in Kodungallur for Kannagi after her death. Kannagi is a symbol of chastity for the Tamils. Her fury over her husband’s killing is said to have burnt the city of Madurai. Others believe that a Buddhist monastery had existed on this site earlier and that the temple was built after the Buddhists were driven out of the place. They cite the practice of singing obscene songs on the third day of the ‘Bharanipattu’ festival celebrated at this temple even now as proof of verity of their argument. Even today, there exists the belief that Goddess Chengannur Bhagavati goes through her menstmal period, or theriputhu, once a year. During this time the temple is kept closed. Devotees fervently be- lieve that it is very auspicious to keep in their homes the cloth used by the deity, during this time. And so there is much scrambling among them to procure a piece of this cloth. When I visited the Chottanikara temple, I found huge iron nails driven into the trunk of a tree there. I was told that if mentally deranged people are brought here and made to drive a nail into the tree with their heads, their madness will be cured. The Jumma Masjid in Methala near Kodungallur is the first mosque to have been built in India. It is said that when King Cheran Pemman went on a pilgrimage to the Arab countries he met with the Holy Prophet Mohammed and was converted to Islam. He changed his name to Tajudeen, married the sister Travelling through Kerala 5 of the king of Jeddah and settled there. After his death, his successor came to Kerala and the then ruler of Kodungallur offered to help him build a mosque. People belonging to several communities gather here every year to celebrate Ramzan and Bakrid. Kottayam, referred to as the ‘rubber country’, and its surroundings have a high population of Syrian Christians. Many Christian festivals are celebrated with greater fervour here than in other parts of the state. The St Dominic Syrian Church in Aluva and the St Joseph Syrian Church in Meppadi are impor- tant places of worship. Boat races are conducted in Kerala around Onam. Puram, the elephant procession, is also organised at the same time in Thrissur. These are events that attract a number of tourists from both within and outside the country. I had the good fortune once to witness the traditional Kathakali performance at Thrissur. It was held on a stage that had no artificial lights. The whole performance was conducted by the light of two huge brass lamps kept on either side of stage. The musicians sat with their instruments at one end. The artistes took hours to don the make-up that would transform them into the various epic characters. The play staged that day was Hiranyavadam, the story of the Narasimha avatar of Lord Vishnu. The performance began at around ten in the night and went on till about five the next morning. It was an unforgettable experience watching the performance while seated on the sand. The places I visited in Kerala and the experiences I had there are many. The animal sanctuaries, the small towns I visited travelling by boat in the backwater canals, the port city of Kochi and its twin city Emakulam, Kottakkal which is famous for its Ayurveda treatment, Kollam with its rich cashew planta- tions... I can go on and on. Truly is it said that one grain is proof of the quality of the rice in the pot; similarly these glimpses of Kerala throw light on the riches of the State. Keralites can take pride in the fact that their land is blessed by the bounty of Mother Nature (are not 44 rivers riches indeed?) and that, despite the advances in civilisation, they continue to retain their native heritage and culture. 6 Knit India Through Literature: The South M.T. Vasudevan Nair T have heard about the mighty oceans, and I have a been overwhelmed by them. But more than that, I JL am closer to the stream that flows through my village — that is far more precious to me. ” This is what M.T. Vasudevan Nair said when I met him for the first time in 1989 during the Kavirathiri programme organised by the Agni Trust. We met several times after that, exchanged views and conversed for hours. We became close friends. Each time 1 met him 1 was frankly overawed by his intellect. His dhoti trails on the ground, and the gold chain around his neck is clearly visible through the carelessly donned half-open shirt. His hair is dishevelled, and he always car- ries a packet of beedis and a matchbox in his left hand. He is slightly reserved, but when he begins to speak, it is with depth and passion, and they are words of wisdom about the panorama of life. We travelled together to many places to meet the writer Mohammed Basheer, to the memo- rial of Perunthachan, the father of Malayalam literature, and to his village. The river Bharathapuzha flowing through the village Kuddallur was witness to my interview with him and to our soulful conversations on knitting India through literature. He was thrice the recipient of the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award, Central Sahitya Akademi Award, Vayalar Award, all of them the highest honours for literature. “M.T.”, as he is popu- larly called was awarded the National Award four times for the best film script, and he received the Kerala State Award fourteen times for the best screenplay. A walking encyclopaedia, he has world literature at his fingertips. # Research indicates that among the South Indian languages, there is a close relationship between the languages Tamil and Malayalam. Can you explain this and also elaborate on the birth and growth of Malayalam? According to scholars, the Malayalam language as it is spoken today came into being about 700 years ago. In comparison with Tamil, it is somewhat young. The Ramacharitam written in the 12th Century, based on the epic Ramayana, is one of the oldest written works in Malayalam. It is true that there are close links between Tamil and Malayalam. Parts of today’s Kerala state were once part of Tamil Nadu. So, what was referred to in the ‘Sangam’ period as ‘Pazhanthamizh’ was spoken there too. Not only that, scholars like Neelakanta Sastri point out that Keralite festivals like Onam have found mention in the literature of the Sangam period Wt Madurai Kanchi. While speaking M. T. Vasudevan Nair 7 of the growth of Malay alam language, the ‘Manipravala’ age when Malayalam had a liberal mixture of Sanskrit words, can be described as a significant period. In the period of ‘Bhakti literature’ that fol- lowed, the writer Thunjathu Ezhuthachan who lived in the 16th Century deserves mention. Though bom into a family belonging to the oppressed class, Ezhuthachan grew to be a scholar in the Vedas and Upanishads. To him goes the credit of simplifying and translating the epics Vk&Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavatam into Malayalam. He also deserves credit for simplifying Malayalam language, which until then bore strong influences of Sanskrit, and for making the Malayalam literature comprehensible to the common man. The 20th Century marked the evolution of modem Malayalam literature. • Tell us something about the novels, short stories and poetry of this century. Kunniraman Nayanar’s Vasanavikriti, written in 1881, is the first Malayalam short story. The first Malayalam novel is Chandu Menon’s Indulekha which was published in 1889. Three literary giants, Vallathol, Kumaran Asan and Ulloor, who lived in the first decade of this century and produced won- derful poetry, were referred to as the ‘Trinity’. Following in the footsteps of Sri Narayana Guru, who brought about social reformation through his poetry, Kumaran Asan also wrote poetry on untouchability and other similar topics. Vallathol can be described as a poet with a nationalist outlook. On the whole, the time when these three lived can be described as the period which brought about a renaissance in Malayalam literature. Chandu Menon’s Indulekha is avidly read and is very popular even today. In one of the chapters, the characters are shown to be engaged in a highly intellectual conversation, spouting the theories of Darwin, Huxley and Pablo. Considering all this, I would say that modem Malayalam literature had evolved even in Chandu Menon’s time. • How would you classify the works of writers like Thakazhi Sivasankaran Pillai, Vaikkom Mohammed Basheer, Karoor Neelakanta Pillai and S.K. Pottekat? The literary works that they created after 1930 were built as works that brought about a renaissance in Malayalam literature. Although I believe that there is no need to make such classifications as mod- ernism or postmodernism, in each period, writers have undertaken to create experimental works. • Apart from Tamil and Sanskrit, which other languages have had an impact on Malayalam? English. In 1921 when Vallathol’s good friend Nalapadu Narayana Menon published a translation of Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables, it had a tremendous impact on the writers of that period. I would say that this work inspired us to think differently in terms of the subject, craft and the format of the novels. Malayalam readers deserve praise. Since they have always welcomed translated works from other languages, they have developed a good appreciation of other language literature. As long as this healthy trend is perceived among readers, writers will also continue to think from new angles and look in new places for inspiration. • Tell me about your first few years of writing. I was bom and brought up in a remote village without any electricity. Newspapers and magazines were rare. It was only occasionally that we came across a magazine, but somehow I have never aspired to be anything else but a writer. I used to gaze at photographs of famous writers who inspired me. Changampuzha was a great influence on Malayalam poetry in his day. He died prematurely in 1948 when he was only 33 or 34. Many poets were influenced by Changampuzha. My first work was published when I was only 14. 1 was interested in poetry and won prizes in school competitions. I wrote an article, a story and a poem under three different names for a new magazine, 8 Knit India Through Literature- The South and they all were published. Later my problem was the area to concentrate upon. It was my ambition to become a poet but I got the feeling that something was lacking and that I had not got a grip on the medium, though the poems I wrote were published. The feeling that this was not really my forte per- sisted, and I gradually began writing short stories. • Did you keep writing whilst you were in college? Yes, I wrote short stories, but never let the magazines know I was a commerce student! I used to get ten rupees for each story. It was only after two years that my friends in college discovered that I was a writer. As a consequence they insisted I should stand for the college elections in the final year. Though all my contributions were published, I was highly critical of them. I used to reject them myself! • Which magazines were in circulation when you began writing? There were Mathrubhoomi and Jayabharath to which Basheer and Changampuzha contributed, besides several others. There was no dearth of magazines really. I widened my horizon by writing partly of my own experiences, using childhood memories as well. I delved into my characters and allowed them to express themselves. If you have to find out about a man, you cannot go by his outward appearance or his words, which might be a facade. In order to unmask him, you have to peep into his mind, and I was trying to do this. I wandered into the interiors of the minds of my characters. This was my method. It was distinctively different from the kind of writing which existed at the time. • Which of the writers influenced you? My favourite writer was S.K. Pottekat. He was a highly romantic writer. As a small boy I used to read all the magazines in which his stories appeared. When I was in the ninth standard, I got a scholar- ship of Rs.72 for the previous year. My brothers and sisters advised me not to disclose this to our mother, and we spent the money on books — S.K. Pottekat and all the masters. I was familiar with the writings of all of them. Changampuzha and Shankara Kurup reigned supreme in those days. I had great admiration for B asheer — for his style and manner of presentation. Despite my admira- tion, I have not consciously or unconsciously followed anyone’s style of writing. My themes were different, I was fond of my village idiom which came to be used in my style of writing. • Who were the masters in western literature that inspired you? I liked all of them. In time I was introduced to the works of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky. I have read Hardy, Turgenev, all the short stories of Anton Chekhov, the Russian masters, Maupassant’s stories, Sartre and others as well. • Which novel had a lasting impact on you? The Brothers Karamazov is one of the greatest works the world has ever seen. I have also enjoyed reading Sherlock Holmes, and much later Agatha Christie. • Since you have been nurtured in the village milieu, would you call yourself a rustic writer? Rustic, in the sense of the village, yes. Even today, 70% of my writings stem from my village experiences. • What were your first novels about? Padhi Raagam Pagal Vilucchu was based on a Hindu-Muslim love story. Naalu Kettu was my first M.T. Vasudevan Nair 9 novel. Naalu Kettu was planned in my mind, so also my short stories. I can even visualise the para- graphs in certain areas. The mental process has to be perfect in order to write. I was happy with Naalu Kettu, and the work I had done for it. • What is your method of writing from the moment of conceptualisation? How do you function as a writer, and how long do you take to complete writing? I usually have two or three themes lying dormant in my mind. When the right mood comes, I take them out and toy with them, the way a boy does with the marbles in his pocket. I linger over them, turning and twisting them in my mind, and if nothing comes of it I push them back till the inspiration floods me again. I can write when I have peace of mind. The problem lies in distraction. If I am working on a short story, I prefer to write in one stretch. The most enjoyable part is rewriting, editing, pruning, polishing and honing it to perfection. I have always written my articles and stories this way. Sometimes it takes more than two drafts. • How do you conceive of a theme — a theme that should serve to attract? The writer’s problem is to identify a moment. If that automatically strikes you, you need not search for stories. In the routine course of events, something happens, and your inner voice will say, “There, there, that was a moment, preserve it.” • Do you write consistently? No. I may not write for one or two years, then suddenly when I feel the urge, I may just disappear to some place to write, where I can write at one stretch without any distraction. This is true even if it is a lengthy novel. • Even if it has taken you 7 or 8 years to write a novel, it is only the thought process that has taken so long... Yes. I finish the novel in a month or two, maybe a little longer. I completed Randamoozham's first draft in one and a half months. • Sitting here in your village house, I’d like you to tell me of some of the vibrations and currents that you experience. Perhaps if you tell me about the story of Naalu Kettu...7 The novel is set at a time when the matriarchial system is disintegrating. I have traced the story of a boy — with his pain and anxieties, going through his youth and manhood, who has left his village after he was chased out of the place. His mother was excommunicated from the village. He returns as a mature man to Naalu Kettu (typical architecture of old Kerala houses). I portrayed a changed social order. • Naalu Kettu reflects the prevailing pattern in certain communities of society. Literature does reflect society. Yes. So long as you are part of a society, whatever you write reflects the norms, problems and feelings of that society. In my second nowd Asuravithu it was the same. It was the story of communal tension, of existing social problems. • In some of your short stories, your own experiences have come through. One of them, Birthday for instance portrays your childhood struggle. Thanks to litigation, the family was fractured. The little money which came in had to be shared by 10 Knit India Through Literature: The South several family members. Often there was very little food, and I never had a decent birthday celebration. Even on that day there was no rice and scarcely any food. I was angry with my mother, and she bor- rowed paddy from a rich neighbour. By the time she made lunch it was 3 p.m. By then I had lost my appetite and my excitement, and just left the house. • Do you think that the insults and pain suffered by you were instrumental in shaping you as a writer? Did you feel you had to come back with a vengeance as in Naalu Kattu^i Critics say that it was the prevailing mood in my stories. Looking back dispassionately, I did not nurse any grudge as I grew older, and I did grow into a mature person in my twenties. I did not mean to seek vendetta. Only these incidents have provided good material for my stories later. • What makes a great writer click? A writer should have an obsession to write. He must have plenty of material before him. This apart he must have magnetism and magic. When these two fuse together, good work will come out of it. There are no criteria for good work. It is like a mountain chff overlooking a deep valley. When you gaze down at the valley, you see many things. You read new meanings into them. It has sometimes the sadness of the vast desert, sometimes it murmurs like a forest. Great work conveys many things to you. You realise you are not alone in the universe. You pass through several situations in hfe, but realise that it happens not just to you but to several individuals all over the world. Indirectly it forces you to reconcile, and to accept them. It makes one understand oneself better, the people around one, the society one lives in, and the time frame. For instance, I read Brothers Karamazov about twenty years ago. I read it again last year and it unfolded new meanings, new dimensions. I approach things again and again at every turn of my life and appreciate them differently according to my maturity. • Although you have mentioned it before, I would like you to elaborate. There are some classifications given by some of the critics like modernism, new modernism, surrealism etc. Are such classifications reasonable? You cannot compartmentalise them. Some of the ancient masters were modem. For the sake of convenience, historians classify periods into ancient, modem and postmodern. Modernism is not a label, it is for everyone. Every writer has to be modem, it is the spirit and the ability to reach beyond. • It is the vision... Yes. If you want to cut across words and reach beyond, you may be deviating from already explored paths. You axe in thematic flight. If you want to go beyond, you have to take a new route to explore new vistas. When a creative person searches for something new, it is off the beaten track. It involves the- matic development, presentation and a vision. The new writers project reality, and at first the readers are shocked, but later realise that it is a representation of life. • Could you give me a picture of contemporary writing? Better writing appears in magazines. Some writing is serialised in popular magazines and caters to a particular section of readers. Certain magazines will serialise serious writing, and for others the target audience is different. I find that many of the serials that go into these magazines do not appear in book form at all. M.T. Vasudevan Nair 11 • When popular magazines publish 4 or 5 serial episodes every week, why don’t they reserve 4 or 5 pages for some serious writing as well? Their readership might be different, or the management policies might be at variance. They have to study the market, and note circulation trends. I do not condemn a magazine because its circulation is 1 0 or 12 lakhs, I do not condemn the readers either. When readers acquire a taste for good writing, they will discard repetitive inane writing, and through this a discriminating readership will evolve. Out of hundreds of titles in a railway bookstall there are some which are light and can be gone through quickly, just to while away your time. Out of these only two or three may be serious writers. You cannot expect a uniformly high level of literary perception, because it calls for a specialised taste. It evolves over a period of time, through the years. How many people can appreciate poetry? Even in advanced countries like America the first edition of poetry published runs only to some 3000 copies. • And prose? Only when serious writers win awards like the Pulitzer prize are they read widely. A dedicated writer has to be true to himself and his creativity, and not worry whether the book will sell 1 000, 10000 or one lakh copies. If it does sell, he should be happy. • How do you rate Malayalam literature as compared to other languages in India? Contemporary Malayalam literature is on par with the literature of any language, even excelling some I believe. In the fifties and sixties, Thakazhi and Basheer were writing, and when harsh realities were thrust before a reader as in Basheer’s Sabdangal it was shocking fare that the conventional reader could not absorb. • Could you give me the gist of Sabdangall It is a soliloquy by a man who has witnessed the monstrosities of life and his experiences during the war, which included homosexuality, eunuchs and much else. The puritans were shocked, but Thakazhi and others continued to open up subjects that were taboo. Theirs were fine pieces of writing. It certainly took time for readers to accept this, but in time they did. We writers have to present the good as well as the seamy side of life. Some of the masters were influenced by the naturalism of French literature. • In one of the profiles on you, I read that you made your entry when progressive writing was on the decline, and realism with a touch of idealism got established. When they say progressive writers they were referring to my forerunners the great masters. They were writing about social problems and concerned with surrogates. In those writings the stomach was speaking more, not the heart. • Is there a definition of good and bad literature? What would be your interpretation of the word ‘literature’? If there is a good theme or content it is good literature. If the written word goes into the readers’ hearts, that I would say is a part of literature. • So you believe that communication has to be perfect... It has to be imprinted on the mind. As a writer I would be giving the written word a new rhythm, a new pattern and a new meaning. If it is literature you can write it with a wide space between two words, and yet convey a world of meaning. It is like a piece of music, an orchestra where between two pieces there is a silence full of significance. 12 Knit India Through Literature: The South • Has Malayalam literature been influenced by politics at various stages? Yes. The Marxist group during Thakazhi’s time. Gandhian philosophy did not have much influence here. People joined political parties. Conditions were so bad and everyone sympathised with the exist- ing poverty of land labourers. The writers got involved and it was reflected in their literature. It was a spontaneous offshoot of the time. • I want to know about M.T. the film maker. In 1 963 a producer friend of mine wanted to make a film and approached me for a particular story of mine which he said had potential. I tried to persuade them to go to a professional script writer, but he insisted that I should try my hand at it. I began to read books on film making, and on the great masters, and I wrote the screenplay leisurely, and rewrote it in Madras. The director Mr. Vincent, and the pro- ducer Mr. Paramasivam liked it. The shooting took place at Calicut. I watched the film shooting and editing, and once filled in for the director. I gained vital experience and went on reading up all aspects of films. From 1963 to 1972, 1 wrote scripts, then I decided to do a film on my own. This wa&Nirmalyam which won the President’s gold medal. • You have been writing for 43 years from the age of 15. And you have been called a person who has brought poetry and romanticism into prose. I do not write poetry deliberately. I use a lot of the village idiom with rustic images. I have intro- duced village lore and imagery into my writing. I am conscious of the rhythm of words, as all building material creates a rhythm. The architect builds brick by brick and I build word by word. Every person is as much a romanticist as I am. — December 1992 M.T. Vasudevan Nair ; Little Earthquakes 13 Little Earthquakes M,T, Vasudevan Nair L isten. I must tell you something. It is really interesting. How fearfully they talk about her, how scared they sound. I don’t always understand what they say but... even I believe them sometimes. ‘She’ll pierce you with htr damshtra, that fierce canine tooth of hers and grrr.... she’ll suck all your blood in one go. And your bones? She’ll chew them up with her giant molars and spit them out.’ And who is this she? Why, it is poor Kunjathaal, th&yakshi. They say she comes twice everyday: At ucchakkaanam, and once again at midnight. They say, you can see her walking on the upper slope of the parambu, Ucchakkaanam is that time of day which begins when Amma lies down in the kitchen for a nap after she’s handed out the nctkanji to the servants and ends when Valiamma, my mother’s elder sister, gets up to make the afternoon tea. It is called ucchakkaanam in our home. God knows what language that is ! It is at that time that Akkara Mutthashi — the grandmother who has come from the hamlet across the river to live with us in her old age — goes for a stroll in the parambu. She picks leaves and roots. Mutthashi alone knows which are medicinal. Before she dies she must pass on the secret to a little girl in the family, the kutty she likes best. Who else but me! When Mutthashi became bedridden I started going alone to the parambu, when there was no one around to stop me. Amma and Valiamma say that it must have been then that some evil spirit possessed me. And there is this Thekkukaran Ravunni Nair to fan the flame. ‘All this trouble started when this cursed old hag came here,’ he says, putting the blame squarely on Mutthashi. But when I go out I only see this other witch who walks stealthily through the parambu. No one knows about her, but me. She is none other than Valiamma’s precious daughter. Sarojini Edathi. People don’t know about her ‘celestial’ lover either, the gandharvan who waits for her on the steps of the Nambudiri’s outer pond, fishing with line and tackle. At ucchakkaanam every day I also see the one who stands at the wooden grille in the western wing of the house, all excited, gesticulating to Nanikutty who wanders into the parambu on the pretext of grazing her goats. It’s my brother. If you ask me, Ettan is the one who’s possessed. But who’ll believe me? And she who sits drying her hair in the inner courtyard... she drives me away as soon as she sees me. She won’t let me even peep into the large books filled with photographs of cinema stars that she devours every day. That woman thinks she’s something great. She’s just three years older than me, and my own sister too. But what’s the use? She has no time for me. One day, at ucchakkaanam, I was taking a stroll in the parambu. And... there was someone under the mango tree. At once, I knew that this was the yakshi they’d been talking about. I wanted to run but my feet wouldn’t move. I wanted to scream but no sound would come out of me. I closed my eyes tight and chanted ‘Arjunan, Phalgunan, Arjunanphalgu... ’ I heard a soft voice. ‘Janakikutty’. 14 Knit India Through Literature: The South It had a strange fondness in it. I liked the way she called me by my full name. Others call me Jatti. I opened my eyes slowly. Kunjathaal was standing next to me. You’ve seen the Athemmar girl, haven’t you, she who was married off to that Kunnamkulam boy? Well, Kunjathaal looked exactly like that. A white mundu with the traditional kam and kuri; a white blouse; a white cloth around her shoulder. She had a red spot of chaandu on her forehead. Studs in her ears. A necklace of sovereigns around the neck. ‘Why has Janakikutty come alone?’ she asked. I kept quiet. ‘Why doesn’t Janakikutty’s Mutthashi come nowadays?’ I couldn’t take my eyes off her mouth as she talked. I told myself that I should not show her that I’m frightened. So I asked her as if I was not at all scared, ‘Where is your damshtraT The Athemmarkutty burst into laughter. Ah, what pretty teeth! She said, ‘The damshtra grows big only when we have a prey. But it scares everyone away. That’s why we have no one to play with.’ In the rear slopes of the parambu there is a dilapidated outhouse. A servant used to stay there. Around it is a thicket of palm trees. Yakshi went and sat there, took out betel leaves and nuts from the folds of her mundu, tucked them between her molars and started chewing. I looked longingly at her. Yakshi glanced at me as she said, ‘Small children shouldn’t chew betel’ I collected seven small smooth pebbles. We sat there and played my favourite game, kothengkallu. You should see Yakshi playing! How easily she scooped up four, five stones at each throw. Naturally, it was Kunjathaal who won. That is what Yakshi likes me to call her. ‘Tomorrow, Janakikutty, you win.’ She smiled. What if I lose? At least I have someone to play with. Yakshis are so true to their word. If my Edathi says, ‘I’ll give it to you tomorrow,’ it means she’s putting me off. She won’t give it to me. But yakshis are not like that. And the next day, it was I who won. Every day at dusk, Mutthashi teaches me to say my prayers. This has started recently, after she heard my mother say, ‘At least this much good can come from this good-for-nothing hag.’ I have not see my real Mutthashi, that is, Amma’s and Valiamma’s mother. She died years ago. This Akkara Mutthashi is my real Mutthashi’s younger sister. Amma and Valiamma, when talking about this Mutthashi, always say, ‘It is due to this hag’s character that her children didn’t look after her. Etta!’ Etta is their own language of abuse. And when this Mutthashi was laid up in bed Amma moaned: ‘What problems ! Now I have to wait on this wretched old hag.’ That evening I told Mutthashi about Yakshi and how I played kothengkallu with her. ‘Shhh... don’t tell this to anyone,’ Mutthashi warned. ‘I know these yafo/izs. None of them will harm you, kutty,’ she whispered in my ears. When we got bored with kothengkallu, Yakshi and I would roam all over the parambu. It was then that I saw Karineeli.* You know thoXparapoodam* that comes dancing in the Velakali temple festival. And you must have seen Kali who comes to sweep our courtyard and collect the cowdung. Kali looks just like the parapoodam and this Karineeli is a younger version of our Kali. Karineeli wears no blouse; only necklaces made of stones and beads. Her teeth are black. That may be because she chews betel. Karineeli was standing beneath the kanjira tree. I didn’t know who she was. Kunjathaal was angry. ^Karineeli d^niparapoodam: are the spirits of lower caste people. M.T. Vasudevcm Nair : Little Earthquakes 15 She muttered, ‘Hmm.... ! That Karineeli!’ Yakshi and Karineeli stood glaring at each other. I have seen Amma and Valiamma staring at each other like that. This was much more frightening. I feared war. But nothing happened. ‘Why does thampuratti* not let me join her game?’ Neeli asked. My friend Kunjathaal grimaced, then nodded her head. ‘Okay. Come.’ Karineeli drew a game board on the ground. She brought broken tiles. And the three of us sat there and played vattu. When I told all this to Mutthashi that evening she patted me and said, ‘Nothing wrong with you, kutty. No evil will befall you.’ One day when we were walking through the compound Kunjathaal showed me ihehrahmarakshas/^'* It was standing on that dilapidated platform on which we had played kothengkallu. You' ve seen Kunju Nambudiri who died, haven’t you? Imagine Kunju Nambudiri grown three times as tall. The brcihma- rakshas was exactly like that. ‘If we don’t go near it, not even for a friendly chat, it won’t do us any harm,’ Kunjathaal said. As a matter of fact it did not even look at us. Unlike those other friends of Neeli — Parakutty, Karikutty and Kallaadimutthan who always hid in the thicket and peeped at us. Sometimes they dared to inch towards us but one stare from Kunjathaal would make them scurry back into their holes ! One day, a poisonous thorn pierced my foot. The wound was deep. Neeli got angry and started abusing Kallaadimutthan. ‘If the wound turns septic and Kutty suffers I’ll.... You ’ Next day there was not even the pain of an ant bite. These people are so true to their word. I used to sleep with my Mutthashi but now I sleep at the foot of Amma’s bed, next to my sister. Edathi doesn’t like this. She goes to sleep early, except on those days when Sarojini Edathi joins us. Then they jabber away till Amma comes. I don’t sleep well these nights. It’s not a sickness like these people say. The reason is a secret. Shall I tell you why? It is jealousy. Envy of Kunjathaal and Neeli who could wander around and play even at night. Once I saw them walking through the plantain grove munching something. I went to the window and called out softly. ‘Kunjathaal... Neeli!’ But they didn’t hear me at all. What friends! It was then that my mother woke up and what an earthquake there was I She lit the lamps. Everyone came mnning. Mutthashi also came, dragging her frail frame, grabbling the walls for support. Amma shrieked, ‘We have enough troubles, you old hag! Don’t add to them. If you should fall down, col- lapse... Maaranam.’ Paniker was sent for. He was a clever man. He arranged cowries on the floor, studied the indications and told them all about my playing with Kunjathaal and Neeli — at least that’s what they told me. But shall I tell you how they were fooled by him? When he said that Thekkanchovva was also with us, these people believed him at once. That’s where Paniker made a mistake. Panikar sent a hundred and one rupees through Ravunni Nair. An offering to the goddess Anakkara Bhagavati. Good. May Bhagavati enjoy the gift. But, believe me, Thekkanchovva has never come to play with us. Or Vadakkanchovva. Even if they come, we shall not ask them to join us. How do we know what kind of people they are? At times Amma would feel sad. Sometimes she’d be angry. I’ve heard her mutter so many times, *thampuratti: literally means queen. All upper class women were addressed thus. ’^^brahmarakshas: is the spirit of a Brahmin. 16 Knit India Through Literature: The South ‘What if somebody falls ill? What if somebody dies?

He says if they bring in even one basket of tea leaves that are not tender enough, Achhan rejects the whole lot. Even while processing the leaves Achhan has to be there. If Achhan doesn’t supervise these things then complaints will pour in from shopkeepers — Ts this tea or is it dust?’ And the customers will grumble, This tea tastes like tamarind water’ . It was when he recruited a woman on the pretext of needing an extra hand on the estate that Achhan lost his head. That is what Amma says. If this urvashi tries any of her tricks on Achhan, I will tell Kunjathaal.
