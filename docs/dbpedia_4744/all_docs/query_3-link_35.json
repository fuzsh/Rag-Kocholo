PREFACE I wrote this dictionary ad usum delphini when my son was sent to me as Assistant Collector, I publish it in the hope it may be useful to other Assistant Collectors, young officials, missionaries, and business men, and to Telugu boys learning English. There is no other Telugu dictionary in the least like it. I have for one thing used Roman characters, and for another left out all words that are not in common use. I do not conceal from myself that a common verdict of the Telugus will be: ‘Idi ye dicshanari? dicshanari, gicshanari’ ; that is, this is no dictionary at all. It is perfectly true that it is not a dictionary in the ordinary sense, but rather a manual for young people learning Telugu or English, and it aims at educating, edifying, or even amusing them when they look up words.

There is a most serious estrangement between spoken and written Telugu; at one time it threatened at least a decree nisi , till the necessity of earning his daily rice compelled the educated Telugu to write in a manner intelligible to more than one in a hundred of his countrymen. Even now the leading articles of every newspaper and the more pretentious works of the learned are mere gibberish to half the number of literate Telugus and mean nothing at all to the illiterate. But the news is reported in colloquial language, and magazines are published in which stories told with simple force jostle poems and articles enervated by pedantry. The pedantry of 'grammatical’ Telugu is tragically absurd. Beginning with the false premiss that grammatical correctness and elegance of diction must be based on the usage of past centuries, and continuing with mistaken formulations of that usage, the pundits had reached a stage when every one of them found the style of every other one con- taminated and abominable, before a few sensible scholars were at last found to -explode their whole theory and practice. The new school pointed out that grammar is not a fixed unchanging scheme but a body of rules deduced from usage; as usage changes, so must grammar change; and when you have the perfect, perpetual, immutable grammar, the language is dead. A new approach to writing was demanded. Instead of paralysing elegances and affected intricacies of style, which made the writing of Telugu an exercise of mystification and the reading of it the solution of innumerable puzzles, to the joy of the pundits and the scorn of their adversaries, there was to be the natural, easy, nervous expression of the writer’s meaning in the words and the constructions which the writer would use in conversation with his friends. Though the pundits denounced the vulgarity, the 'village’ origin, of the new vocabulary and the new grammar, these were bound to prevail if any- body had any meaning he really wished to express. They have not yet conquered all along the front, but they have established themselves in modem Telugu prose. It now remains to see what can be made of the new prose. So far it has lacked a great exponent. The most eminent figure in modem Telugu literature halted midway between the camps. In many of his X INTRODUCTION works he used the gramyamu , the common dialect, freely and un- ashamedly, and the popular appeal of his village comedies was enormously increased by their adaptation to the popular ear. But in his more exalted flights he entered the kingdom of the pundits and wandered in ' the cloudy realm of Sanskrit compounds and archaic survivals. In many of his works you may observe the remarkable (but still not uncommon) practice of explaining the ‘Telugu’ word by an English word. The English word is used in ordinary parlance ; but it would be blasphemy in the pundit not to prefer the Sanskrit compound, newly coined and „ wholly incomprehensible to alb save himself and the very few of the elect. The vicious practice of drawing upon Sanskrit for new com- pounds, even when another word is in common use, seems almost in- eradicable. It is one of the causes of the needless obscurity of newspaper leaders, scientific articles, and treatises on matters removed from every- day life; even though the writer makes no display of grammatical elegance and writes as it were in conversational vein he will be thwarted in his attempt to make his meaning clear if he refuses to use the words in which he frames his thoughts. Now it may be a pity, but it is a fact, that on nearly all matters except those of domestic and personal concern the educated Telugu learns to think and to express himself, not in Telugu, but in English. The abstract terms which he can really handle are English. Whether he is talking of politics, of economics, of medicine, of agricultural science, of law, of education, the odds are that he has imbibed his information in English, that his concepts are founded on the English words, and that he could express himself with greater accuracy, fluency, and force in English than in the vernacular. This state of affairs, be its causes and its defects what they may, has a curious dominance in modem Telugu. It brings it about that a writer, so soon as he leaves the spheres in which he is accustomed to use the vernacular as his daily medium of expression, begins as it were to translate his thoughts into Telugu rather than to compose in Telugu. All who have had occasion to study the official translations of Government publications and of Acts of the legislature will know the consequence that generally follows : the language is thrown out of its stride and becomes a curious hybrid, with no style of any kind. Just, as the English schoolboy writes dog-Latin in trying to put English into Latin without reconstructing the meaning in a Latin form, so does the Telugu graduate write dog-Telugu because his thought was bom in English and resists transmigration. When he tries to reincarnate it in a language not even his own, that is in the Sanskritized and INTRODUCTION xi obsolescent dialect of the pundits, the infant becomes a monster. Nobody who knows English at all will ever make use of the versions prepared by Government translators — better a foreign language than a distortion of language. It does not follow that English is in any way likely to oust Telugu. Telugu is a living language because millions speak it in the villages, and the Telugu of the villages will go its own course in spite of the graduates. It is very hospitable to the foreign word : in time past it adopted Urdu t words to supplement its own stock where it w T as poor; from time im- memorial to this day it has been taking Sanskrit words to its bosom with various degrees of change ; and it has no difficulty in entertaining the English word. Roddu has practically supplanted all other words in talking of highways: polisu , steshanu , suparindentu , mdtiu, motdru , relu, and many others are good modern Telugu words for which there are no substitutes. Men of education import words and the villager uses them without question. When his betters use such phrases as nd watch slogd v’undi , i lain marc chesi , instrument level ledn , actupdss aznadi — and would be hard put to it to express the same meaning in words of indigenous growth — it is no wonder that the villager, when he has to do with the things of a novel civilization, borrows the terms of an unknown language. It is obvious that a nation’s vocabulary reflects a nation’s life : translators constantly find themselves stumped by words denoting things familiar to one people but not found at all amongst the other; and this dictionary in explaining words has incidentally become a manual of practices and manners. As the life of a Madras village begins to embrace the novelties of the brave inventive new world the village language picks up counters to pass current for them. Since English is now the language of the administration, the courts, the marts, and the colleges — in short, of every manifestation of the new activity — the vernacular naturally enriches itself from the English. But should the period of English dominance end to-morrow and the Andhras form their own government, they must make an attempt to conduct their own affairs in their own language. There can never be any hope of changing the language of the mass of the people, and a nation’s government, however despotic, cannot use a foreigner’s tongue with a gpod grace. It is, however, hardly conceivable that Telugu as it now h can meet the future demands of the Andhra people. The colloquial Telugu of to-day is a simple tongue, sufficient for the wants of a simple life. But as a people comes to maturity, and its range of thought and feeling widens, words must be found to express the whole gamut of meaning. At the xii INTRODUCTION same time political organization proceeds ; the village gives place to the district and the district to the province as the microcosm of communal life; and the province calls for a standard speech. Telugu as the tongue of an independent and advancing people must be enriched and modelled to a form which can everywhere prevail over discrepant dialects. At present there is a great difference between the Telugu of different districts. In the schools a certain uniformity of pronunciation and grammar has been compassed, but so far is this from being carried into current speech that an experiment which was made at Madras of, allowing the candidates for certain examinations to write in the colloquial vernacular of their own region failed because the examiners could not cope with the immense variety of vocabulary thus let loose. Indeed Telugu is now in the condition attributed to the 'lingua del sf by Dante in his treatise De Vulgari Eloquio. If history should only repeat itself, it may develop as that language in its many dialects developed, and achieving a greater uniformity, dignity, and harmony, truly earn the title of 'the Italian of the East 7 . As yet it hardly deserves the title. Some pronunciations of Telugu are in the highest degree clear, mellifluous, harmonious. On the stage, when actors give each vowel a precise sound and each consonant its true character, Telugu can be a fascinating language. In the bazaars, where counterfeit too often passes current and clipped coin is the rule, Telugu can be as strident, raucous, and mumble-mouthed as any language in the world, and can in no way compare with the Italian of provincial piazzas. The consonants are generally slovenly. Hard d for one requires too much effort for the mechanic herd; in such words as ddutaru it becomes very like r (drtaru) and elsewhere is barely distinguish- able from English*/. The distinction between s, s, and sh is neglected. The Sanskrit aspirates lose their aspiration. The sounds ts and ch , dz andy, are confounded — sometimes, however, to advantage, as when the sibilant tsutsutsu is improved into tsuchutu and so into the usual form tsdstu. m Vowels are very unstable. Short a is as often as not indefinite, approxi- mating sometimes to e rather than to a. Long a varies with its piaffe in the word and the stress upon it. Such words as ‘Dastard are pronounced vastdrd because the stress is on the first and last syllables. Short a varies according to the sounds preceding and following; it sometimes approximates to o, sometimes to a. Final short u is hardly ever pro- nounced at all, so that though written Telugu is full of u y spOKfcn T elugu is dominated by i and a . Other final vowels are either elided or quietly dropped whenever possible. The same fate befalls many a whole final INTRODUCTION xiii syllable, especially the inflected endings of verbs: ?iu,vu t dU)du,?mi,ru,z-i y ri are all apt to vanish away. Ikkadde for ikkada ledn is normal; for nuvvu po , nenu vastdnu you may hear nuppd, ne vastd . From plays in * the colloquial dialect may be culled such mutilations as d ?ndtac\"oste for a mdtacu vaste , yaracca for yerugaca , ndc'em cdz'dli for ndcu yemi cdvalayunu , sacchdn rd for tsachchindnu rd , appanitrd for appanu yetlu rd , lacco for laguco , tiscochchanu for tisuconi •vachchindnu . Yet in these literary productions a limit is set to vulgarisms; the speech of ryots , and shopkeepers is even harsher and more curtailed. It is not altogether at fault, since Telugu words are unduly long; but as the mutilations have not yet been reduced to rule, and as different contractions are in vogue in different districts, the colloquial forms are not all suited to a universal literary language. First a norm must be set up on the foun- dation of some chosen usage. As every district with equal vehemence maintains its own title to be the home of the true, the ancient, the perfect Telugu, the choice is invidious. The opinion of the learned is not entirely agreed. Some favour the region of Guntur and Nellore and some the region of Godavari and Kistna. The author of this dictionary is among the latter ; the vocabulary he has compiled consists of the words in common use from Cocanada to Bezwada. In so defining his limits and purging his language he has taken one step towards the King’s Telugu. Greater steps remain for Telugu writers to take. A foreigner may be permitted to point out a vocabulary suited to the reformed language of the future : but who is to create a literature in it ? The literary languages of modern Europe owe their foundation to some man or group of men. When Luther translated the Bible into pure and simple German he made it a model for the generations to come. The Elizabethans gave English a norm. Italian owns Dante as a foster-father. Yet Dante was in some degree a pedant and had the same exaggerated respect for Latin that Telugu pundits have for Sanskrit and Sanskritized Telugu. The first book of his Convito might well be cited on either side of the controversy between pundits and reformers. Dante would not use Latin for that work from two sets of motives. The first is worthy of the pundits : Latin was too noble, excellent, and beautiful for a com- mentary on verses in the vulgar tongue ; too noble, because r eternal and incorruptible ; too excellent, as expressing concepts more perfectly than Italian; too beautiful, as following art instead of usage in its harmony and construction. The reply to Dante and the pundits is the same. Neither Latin nor Sanskrit nor Sanskritized Telugu is eternal and XIV INTRODUCTION incorruptible; Dante’s own Latin was very different from Cicero’s and equally different from that of Erasmus; the pundit’s Telugu fails by its own canons. Neither Latin nor Sanskrit nor Sanskritized Telugu is better adapted to expressing thought than a modern tongue used with genius or even with skill. Neither Latin nor Sanskrit nor Sanskritized Telugu is freer from usage or more capable of art than their living derivatives. The notion that the Latin gloss might have been too good for the Italian verses was purely fantastical. The verses still live. So will Telugu verses in the colloquial. Dante’s other set of motives ^yas first, liberality, and second, love of his native speech. In order to make largess of his knowledge to the multitude of his countrymen, he must use their language; nor was he averse, because he had a natural affection for it. These are exactly the motives of the reformers. But from among them has arisen as yet no Dante, There is now no figure in the Telugu literary world so out- standing as the late Veerasalingam Pantulu ; and even that giant of the last generation was not of so great a stature. His works exploded the notion that elegance and beauty in Telugu prose consisted of over- wrought descriptions of natural and erotic scenes composed throughout of indigestible Sanskrit epithets and unpronounceable Sanskrit nouns. But he left no work meet to thrill the millions and open their eyes to the imaginative universe. Among other peoples and in other eras the great ages of literature have begun with song. The Andhra nation sings naturally, constantly, melodiously — though the matter of the songs that cartmen and porters sing as they move in file down the road is not always worthy of their singing. But Telugu literature has ignored and despised Telugu song; it has imported an alien prosody, in which the language moves uneasily, as though constricted by borrowed garments. The author of this dictionary holds the opinion that a quantitative prosody on the Greek pattern would best suit the genius of the language and has rendered two verses of Homer ( Od . xv. 54-5) into very passable Telugu hexa- meters . Gnyapti y ’ athidd mart y ’ untunnadi rozulu, y ’ anni Satcaram Sri Raja samastam chesina y’andu. The experiment might be worth continuing ; anyhow it is for the modern Telugu to fashion himself a measure in which he can readily wield his own language and be understood by the many. A Telugu poem of to-day is understood only by the learned ; the words, the constructions, the inflectional forms are all strange and incomprehensible to the vulgar! INTRODUCTION xv Poetical diction has run so wild that the common word is wholly in- admissible; prosodical necessity is so overbearing that every word is distorted. Other nations have won beauty out of imported forms: Latin poets enslaved themselves to Greek to their profit : English poetry adapted the Italian verse and gained sweetness. But to all seeming Telugu verse is now only a kind of jig-saw puzzle, and the picture that emerges is too often cheap and nasty. Vicious canons of composition have made shoddy panegyrics and erotic rhapsodies the common matter of poetry; such things are not worthy of a self-respecting people. It might appear that Telugu is not naturally a poetical language. It is somewhat deficient in metaphorical expressions and shy even of similes. It avoids epithet and is richer in nouns than in adjectives. It is remarkably concrete in expression: the figurative and the abstract are rare in comparison with the bald statement of sensible fact (or nonsensical superstition). But all this might have been said of Latin when Ennius began to wield it and even after Lucretius had carved philosophy into poetry with it. Vires acquirit eundo. A language is a great poet’s garden, and the flowers spring up as he goes about it. Not otherwise the great orator and the great thinker develop a lan- guage in wielding it. The Greek of Solon and the Latin of the Gracchi were hardly richer than modern Telugu. They too loved the concrete expression, fled the abstract; they too were terse rather than florid; they too preferred the personal turn and the active mood. The work of the dramatists, the historians, the orators, the poets, the philosophers, from Aeschylus to Plato, gave Greek every instrument it lacked, till it could discourse on everything in earth and heaven. Lucretius and Virgil and Cicero between them did the same service for Latin. The old words were enriched with new shades, new depths, new discrimina- tions, new subtleties of meaning. New words were minted as they were wanted. There was little need to borrow; the old speech was capable of both variety and precision in the hands of the masters. So is Telugu. For oratory in particular it is eminently suited. Its precise structure, giving weight to the essential words and emphasis to words abnormally placed, has the same advantages as Latin’s. Its inflectional nature affords every opportunity for ellipse, balance, and symmetry; its very want of conjunctions forces on it the rhetorical devices of the ancients. The peculiar Dravidian form of the relative clause tightens the texture of the sentence. If the Andhra orators only , studied the proverbs of their people and imitated their compact energetic expression, their speeches might engender conviction by their very xvi INTRODUCTION form. The turgid longevity of the sentences they are wont to deliver may fascinate the unfortunate listener but lets the point escape. In the narrative style a similar fault prevails. The old principle, the longer a sentence the better, still has many adherents. The flowing spineless sentences have no relation to the articulations of the sense. It is not so in common speech, where the sentences are in comparison as live kraits to dead pythons. In truth the illiterate villager often has more sense of style than the product of the colleges : the common petition- writer sometimes has a sure touch in ordering his facts and putting them out in few and telling words, though his writing is often more intelligible than legible. He has indeed to cope with an unmanageable alphabet. It is less absurd than the Tamil, Kanarese, and Malayalam, but not by much. It is syllabic and consequently difficult to read even in print. Where the last vowel of a word is elided, that word undeservedly gets saddled with the first vowel of the next, which equally undeservedly loses its head. The letters are pretty, but untidy in combination. In cursive writing the untidiness becomes a welter. The claim that the alphabet is strictly phonetic is not well founded. One letter does duty for the two sounds ts and ch , another for both z and /, and a third for both aspirate ph and /. There are entirely unnecessary symbols for a hard r and hard n which are never used in speech. In some books an obsolete symbol still appears for an imaginary nasal sound of indeterminate character alleged to be present in many words. The same sound ts is sometimes written as one letter and sometimes as two. The six long vowels, six short vowels, and two diphthongs for which there are characters by no means exhaust the range of vowel sounds used in speaking. For instance, the modified long a in such contractions as pilchdru or such borrowed words as bancu has to be represented by the same symbol as ordinary long a . Modified long e is found in the usual pronunciation of such words as leca , met a, but is not to be distinguished in writing. A Telugu can apparently discriminate between the various pronunciations oflong a in gunda when it represents (i) gunda-fc-a, (2) gundi-{-d y (3) gundu+a, (4) gunde^a, and in cold when it represents (1) cota+d, (2) cdtu+a , (3) cdti+a, or of short u in mec'undi according as it is (1) meca undi , and (2) mecu undi. But the difference does not appear in writing. The Telugus are proud of their alphabet in spite of its defects; but the author of this dictionary may be excused for thinking that his work will both be easier to read and more phonetically correct in its dress of Roman letters with appropriate' diacritical marks. INTRODUCTION xvii The International Phonetic Alphabet would in some ways be even better, but Its correctness does not compensate for its unfamiliarity to any but trained phoneticians. The professors of phonetics have hitherto neglected Telugu; yet there is much to interest them in a language whose system of vowel harmony has a natural origin in the speech habits of the people and a completeness very remarkable in so natural a growth. In inflected forms the vowel modification extends even to a change from u to i or from a to u, while in all words the common pronunciation assimilates neighbouring vowels as far as possible to each other or modifies them to go with neighbouring consonants. Even the use of the euphonic interpellatives v and y is phonetically regular. The phoneticians have the advantage that their principles require them to study the prevailing usage ; the dictionary spelling has for them no unassailable sanctity. The author of this dictionary has to reckon with the bogey of India, mamul , established custom, in the form of recognized spellings, though he can add notes on the usual pronuncia- tion‘ Telugu spelling is fortunately very sound in the main. It is in accidence and syntax that the opinion of the learned and the practice of the vulgar are at loggerheads. A reconciliation is to be effected by discarding obsolete doctrine and examining the speech of educated men all over the Andhra country to see what usages are admissible and what must be regarded as solecisms. So may be compiled a Dictionary of Modern Telugu Usage which will do for grammar what this work attempts for vocabulary, establishing a norm and encouraging the men of genius to use the tools most fitted for their work. Perhaps inspiration will be lacking while the Telugu nation is in tutelage; but when the noble and puissant nation mews its mighty youth, wnen the full tide of inspiration begins to flood the land, it is surely the common people, the people of the villages, who should hear and applaud. It is their language that must be used ; therefore to its study this work is devoted. R. GALDETTI. TELUGU DICTIONARY A No equivalent suffix. ‘Oh’ or' • ‘My 5 prefixed.
