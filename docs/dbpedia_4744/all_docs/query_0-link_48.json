        "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will emerge as single largest party in the 2014 General Elections, an opinion polls survey conducted by Headlines Today reported. According to this Survey, BJP will bag 188 seats alone and with its alliance the number may increase upto 230+. However BJP will fall short of the magic figure of 272 to form the government in the Center.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress party in the upcoming elections will definitely face the heat of public opined the survey. 98-108 seats will be Congress's number in Lok Sabha polls and interestingly, the Regional parties will become crucial in forming a government at national level as 223-233 seats will be bagged by them.\n\nIn a surprise, Aam Aadmi Party would win 4 to 6 seats in Delhi and BJP may get 1-3 seats said the survey. This report shocked the Congress party as not even single seat was reported to them.\n\nBJP is set to win good number of seats in Uttar Pradesh reported the survey. CNN - IBN said BJP may get 41-49 and ABP News - Nielsen poll gave the saffron party 35 seats. The Congress may confined to below 20 seats this time and an average the Congress may get 10 seats. Uttar Pradesh is very crucial for any party because it the most number of Lok Sabha seats (80) than any state in the country. Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will be confined between 10-15 seats said the survey.\n\nIn Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, BJP will show a good improvement as the survey reported 21, 22 and 22 seats respectively. Compared to 2009, BJP has a gained a lot in these three states and in Bihar the Nitish Kumar led JD (U) will be confined to single digit survey told.\n\nDown the South BJP impact may be lesser but in Karnataka, it will give a tough fight to Congress party which is in government in the state. The India today reported the BJP will get 13 seats whereas Congress will get 12. And in Andhra Pradesh, both the National parties will be get only single digit as Regional parties will clash the sentiment factor.\n\nOverall, BJP is set to mark a good performance compared to 2009 and Narendra Modi factor will definitely work in favor of them. The Congress party knew that Modi is waving all over the country but it is still in dilemma over its Prime Ministerial candidate. Though Rahul Gandhi is claimed as unofficial PM candidate, the Congress is feared to announce him as if it losses the polls, the Rahul will be seen down graded. Despite all the odds, Congress led UPA government is confident of coming into power for the third successive time.\n\nThe 16th Lok Sabha elections are due by May.\n\nAnuhya a software techie from Andhra Pradesh went missing on January 4. She had gone to her hometown Machilipatnam for Christmas and was returning to resume her work in Mumbai. She had boarded the Visakhapatnam - Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) Express on January 4 in Vijayawada at 6.35 AM. Anuhya got down from the train at the Lokmanya Tilak Terminus around 4.45 AM on January 5. She said to her father that she would call him after reaching the hostel where she resides but did not. Worried parents tried calling her mobile but it was reported as switched off. His younger brother Arun Kumar went to the station and found that the train had already arrived. He then approached Kurla Government Railway Police (GRP) to lodge a missing complaint. GRP refused to launch a search for Esther, and suggested that she may have eloped. So they approached the Vijayawada GRP.\n\nWith no information and improvement in case, Anuhya's parents went back to Vijayawada and there they registered a complaint. The Vijayawada Railway superintendent of police Shyam Prasad reported on preliminary investigation, it was confirmed that Anuhya had reached Mumbai. A co-passenger, Dondapati Hari Babu, informed that Anuhya was present when he had alighted the train in Pune. Another co-passenger, Raghunath, said she was present when he got down at the Mumbai station. But her mysterious missing suspense continued as she was found traceable. Yet no traces of Anuhya, so parents of her along with relative and a team of Vijayawada Police started searching for her. They tracked the signals of her mobile and the last call from her mobile came from Kanjurmarg place. With the help of local people, they searched the place every bit and finally found her dead body decomposed and burnt.\n\nPost Mortem Report\n\nAnuhya's parents were shocked on hearing the postmortem report. TP Lahane, Dean of the JJ Hospital, examined the body and said injuries found on her body were caused by a big object and she was subjected to sexual assault. To destroy the evidence, the culprits poured chemicals on her body and burnt her.\n\nMumbai Police Investigation:\n\nThe Vijayawada GRP SP transferred the case to Mumbai Police and in their preliminary investigation, Anuhya hired a a cab to Andheri West where she used to reside. But the driver took her in wrong direction and after a few minutes, three more persons got into the cab. Anuhya tired to call her parents when she realized things are getting worse. But the culprits snatched the phone from her and switched it off. Later they took her to a house near Kamatipura, Mumbai’s notorious red light area where she was beaten up and raped. On January 8th night, the accused thrashed her brutally after she resisted their attempts to sexually assault her. She fell unconscious and remained so for the next day too. That was when the accused took her to an isolated place near Kanjurmarg and murdered her by pouring chemicals and setting her on fire.\n\nAnuhya Father's Argument\n\nMeanwhile Anuhya's father Mr. S Jonathan Prasad thrashed the report of Mumbai police. In their report, it was said Anuhya got down of the train at 5:30 AM but it is false. Mr. Prasad claimed that Anuhya landed in the station at 4:45 AM. Also the Mumbai police claimed to have recovered a blanket, slippers and other materials from a house in Kamatipura. However, the blanket doesn't belong to Anuhya. On Friday, Mr. Prasad met Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde for seeking justice into the case. He alleged the Mumbai Police are falsifying the facts.\n\nFew questions unanswered:\n\nWhy did Mumbai Police did not show interest in Anuhya's case?\n\nMumbai police recorded statement from LTT Staff that Anuhya got down of the train at 5:30 where as her father claims she got down at 4:45 AM. Why is there a time gap. Did LTT Staff gave false information or Anuhya's father was wrong ?\n\nMumbai claimed to recover belongings of Anuhya but they did not mention the place from where they recovered.\n\nWhy is there a need for Anuhya's father Mr. Prasad to meet Sushil Kumar Shinde, despite Mumbai Police are investigating the case ?\n\nOn January 9th outgoing calls from Anuhya's mobile were made, who made those calls and to whom did they call ?\n\nHumanity & Support:\n\nIndia is place where woman is compared with goddess but are actually treated as sex toys. Overall the past five years, crime on woman are increasing and most of them are rape attempts. Are men in the country become sex starved and why are they behaving so brutally with women? Moreover, India is becoming like the West, worried about making money and forgetting relations and human values. At leaset, Mumbai TCS employees did not protest on behalf of Anuhya who is an employer there. Anuhya's parents hardly got support from anyone of the them. Just because Anuhya is a non-local, her co-workers did not bother about her. Then what if Andhra and Telangana divide? Do women of both regions face the same situation?\n\nMedia should also feel responsible in cases specially in the attacks over woman. Nirbhaya case took a storm only when there was a uproar from public and later media carried it. Not all time Media need public supports. It has all the guts to show whatever they want despite being controversial.\n\nThe change in society comes only when everyone joins hands together to fight against all odds. The culprits in Anuhya's case should be punished severely. May be a new law or constitution should be made to stop the discrimination on women. Its seriously an emergency time to wake up and fight for a safer environment to live.\n\nExactly thirty days back rewriting the history, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal was sworn-in has Delhi's seventh and youngest chief minister. From the day one of Kejriwal work began, AAP and its government is all over the media in each and every issue. They started the governance with good decisions such has slashing of electricity prices and offering extra litres of water to the people of Delhi. However, the cabins for homeless people and few other promises are yet to be delivered despite getting a grant from the government. But from then on things really turned to worst as their Law Minister caught involved in a controversy and like any other party rebels did hit AAP.\n\nRebel MLA Binny\n\nVinod Kumar Binny was in the news from the day Kejriwal announced his first list of group of minister. Binny was upset for not including his name in the group of minister but later was pacified. Now Binny is revolting against the party, he even went for a hunger strike yesterday however it lasted for only five hours. AAP suspended Binny from party the day before his hunger strike. Binny even withdrew his support to AAP.\n\nLaw Minister fight with Delhi Police:\n\nAAP's Law Minister Somnath Bharti was caught involved in a controversy with the Delhi Police. Somnath Bharti was accused of attacking women with his followers. He asked the police to conduct a raid in the Kirkee Extension area of Delhi as localites complained that area is infected with prostitution and drug trafficking. Somnath repeatedly asked the police to act on it, but they refused to do so, which lead Somnath Bharti argument with police. Opposite politicians and some media claims that Bharti along with his followers molested accused African women but even though there were 4 media cameras,none able to prove it. But videos taken by AAP showing packs of condoms, women hiding white substance, presence of women constable, which police originally refused as a reason for not taking action. The women alleged that they were threatened and even molested by a group and forced to give urine samples by mob. The tests conducted at AIIMS did not find any drug traces in their samples. The AAP called the allegations false, and the chief minister Kejriwal protested for suspension of the police officers who refused to conduct the raid. The party supported Bharti, stating that his actions were not racist.\n\nDanish woman Rape:\n\nKejriwal was also angered by the Danish woman rape incident. He accused the Delhi Police have links with Prostitution and drug gangs. His 36 hours of protest at Rail Bhavan was talk of the nation. Atlast Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde sent the accused Police officers on leave.\n\nThe above two issues were troubling the AAP government like anything but despite all the odds, Kejriwal and his government is managing to continue its work. Sources say that AAP will introduce Jan Lokpal Bill in February and for this they are likely to hold special Assembly sessions. The Jan Lokpal bill is the most crucial promise of AAP and wants to pass it in the Assembly at any cost. On the whole the coming days are going to be even more tougher, as AAP is looking forward to contest in Lok Sabha elections. Already the pre-poll survey are pretty much in favor of AAP and so they are targetting to win all the seven Lok Sabha seats.\n\nBut one can say, Kejriwal clearly fighted for the real common man's problems but the opportunist politicians took every advantage of their inexperience. Still a long way to go!!\n\nAre you being fleeced?\n\nHow often have you gone to a restaurant and shelled out extra cash on the so-called service tax, service charge and value added tax (VAT) on your original food bill? Restaurant bill in India is highly misleading and if you are someone who frequently eat out, you possibly know how these eateries fleece naïve customers of extra money in the name of taxes and charges. And then, there is also the “tip”. What more, if you carefully glean through all the restaurant bills, you will be shocked to see the disparity in the rate of these taxes. Now that leaves us with the big question: Is your restaurant cheating you by over charging than the price marked on the menu? Most probably yes. Find out how and question it next time. After all it is your hard earned money!\n\nTaxes and charges on seemingly simple stuffs like food and drinks are one such thing where customers are taken for granted. Hence, we made a conscious effort of digging into the nuances of various taxes so that we know where exactly is your money going.\n\nBusting the Terminologies - Difference between Service Tax and Service Charge\n\nTo begin with let's first understand what the various tax related terminologies stand for.\n\nService charge and service tax are two most commonly used terms which are very different from each other. Service charge is the charge levied on the services provided apart from the basic charge of the food. The service charge is not levied by govt. but collected by the restaurants themselves.\n\nWhen we go to a restaurant we do not just have food, but we also avail services of the waitress and kitchen staff. Hence the service charges. Although there is no fixed amount for the service charge ,many restaurants charge it in the range of 5% to 10%. Service charges are mandatory to be paid if proper disclosures are made on the menu card otherwise it is the choice of customer.\n\nNow coming to service tax, it is the tax levied by the Govt. of India on services provided in India. Many service providers collect this tax from its customers and give it back to government. This is fixed by the central govt. In case of restaurants, they collect the tax from its customers for the service provided.\n\nWishesh Takes The Onus Of Bringing The Truth Out\n\nOur Wishesh team checked into various restaurants in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad and came up with startling finds. The field reporters were shocked to see dubious bill stating different service charges for different restaurants, which compelled us to probe deeper into the matter to know the crux of the matter. We present a few bill copies below (restaurant names have been kept under wraps for various reason):\n\nWhen our reporters tried to get in touch with the managers of the respective restaurants to find more about the disparity in the service charges, surprisingly, none of them were available at that point of time.\n\nJahgo Grahak Jago - Customer versus Service Tax\n\nKnow Customers - for every penny you are cheated off at these restaurants, you can claim a redressal. Here is how a woman from Chennai fought and won an extraordinary compensation of Rs 12,000 over a paltry tax of Rs 71, 170 times more than the amount duped.\n\nIt so happened that a restaurant in Chennai called Dhaba Express in city's Anna Nagar area charged one Miss Uma Parameshwari with such faulty tax in 2012. One look at her bill, and she knew she had been served with an excess bill than called for. In a bill of Rs 1,225, which included both the service tax and VAT, she was charged a total tax of on the entire food bill rather than the prescribed tax where in the the restaurant was to charge her 12.36% of 30% of the food bill on the premise that 30% of the bill is for services provided and 70% for the items sold.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, she was to have been charged Rs 30, but Rs 71.79 extra was collected as service tax. She served a legal notice on the restaurant, seeking a refund of the extra sum collected along with Rs 25,000 as compensation. But the restaurant neither replied nor complied with the demand.\n\nUma Parameshwari then moved the district consumer court, which directed the restaurant \"not to resort to this kind of unfair trade practices,\" the bench directed it to pay Rs 10,000 as compensation and Rs 2,000 as case cost.\n\nHow is the service tax applied on the food served at restaurants?\n\nIt is not always that we visit a restaurant for the service, sometimes it’s only for the food. To distinguish this situation of availing service or food the Govt. has laid down certain rules for the application of the service tax.\n\nFirst rule is that only air conditioned restaurants need to pay service tax. Earlier for the service tax to be applicable the restaurant needed to be AC and serve liquor however in budget 2013 Honorable Finance Minister Mr. Chidambaram announced that service tax is applicable to all the restaurants with AC even though they are not serving liquor.\n\nThe charge what is applied on the food we are served at restaurants consists of both food and service charges. Hence, the service tax cannot be applied on the entire food charge. But it is difficult to distinguish what amount is for food and what is for service.\n\nHence, to make this bifurcation Govt. has made a rule where the service tax is applicable on the 40% of the food bill at restaurants. Currently service tax is 12.36%. This is applicable on the 40% on the food bill. Therefore is ‘X’ is the bill amount 12.36% (40% (X)) is the service tax and the next effective service tax is 4.95% (X) at the rate of 4.95%.\n\nVAT is another thing to be known about. VAT - Value Added Tax is applicable to any item being sold. At a restaurant food is being sold hence VAT is applicable. VAT is levied by the state govt. Different state Governments have different rates for VAT. VAT also differs for alcoholic beverages and food items.\n\nYou must be thinking that VAT is for the items sold then it must be for 60% of the food bill as the other 40% is for service. However according to the VAT rule it is specified that VAT rate is applicable on the entire amount of the food bill.\n\nHere is an example that will help you understand, Consider your total food bill is Rs. 1000/-\n\nGovernment Explains...\n\nThe next question is why do our government allow such high taxation in things like food and recreation? When these high taxes are introduced in India, typically Govt. Cites higher taxation in foreign countries of Europe or other places. But they forget that the standard of living in those countries are way higher and better than a developing country like India.\n\nThat brings us to our next important question: Do the government use large sum of tax accumulated to fund their personal interest and political ambitions? Or is it because of the country's informal economic structure, inefficient tax administration and unevenly distributed income that compels government to take the path of least resistance, developing tax systems that allow them to exploit whatever options are available rather than establishing rational, modern, and efficient tax systems.\n\nIMPACT OF THESE HIGH TAXES?\n\nThese high service taxes and charges hurts the commoners like us in diferent ways. The sky-rockettin taxes on bills do nothing, but make one feel more poorer and unless we earn a lavish paycheck, eating in restaurants seems like a luxury that most can't afford.\n\nThese incoherent and confusing implementations force everyone to have more cash in hand - breads corruption, blackmailing, high inflation or failure of businesses.\n\nGoing forward before you pay your bill - make sure you are paying right amount of taxes not more and also don’t hesitate to file a case with the District Consumer Forum in Hyderabad. Here is the address:\n\n9th Floor, Chandra Vihar, Nampally, Nampally, Chandra Vihar, Kattel Mandi, Abids, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh 500001\n\n040 2474 6001\n\n(AW: Suchorita Choudhury)\n\nA trip to remember!\n\nThey say that a night in Bangkok is a night well-spent, a night that you will remember as long as you live!

Enjoy the sin!\n\n(AW: Suchorita Choudhury)\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party has been trying its level best to elevate Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the future Prime Minister of India and has been actively campaigning on his behalf. The new campaign Chai Pe Charcha (discussion over tea) is currently abuzz of the state of Gujarat. The tea stalls owned by party workers and others are now re-naming their stalls with Narendra Modi as “NaMo Tea Stall.”\n\nThe BJP party workers are independently re-branding their own tea stall. On the other hand, interestingly the first among this renamed tea stall belongs to a muslim who lives in Odhav area. The 40 year old Zubair Shaikh was approached by the BJP activists and have asked whether he has any objection, if his tea stall is renamed after Narendra Modi. What can Zubair do if doesn't like? Nothing right! So without any other choice, Zubair said No and BJP workers brought a new hoarding to the tea stall and renamed it as “NaMo Tea Stall.”This tea stall is three kilometers away from Naroda Patiya area, where 97 Muslims were killed in 10 hours during the 2002 riots. When asked Zubair about this words on the hoarding, he said,”we can't keep carrying the past with us. What has happened is happened and its time to move on. I did not rise any objection regarding the re-naming of the tea stall and I did not pay from my pocket to the hoarding. Infact the hoarding also acts like a publicity for my tea stall.” With a small smile on this face, he ended the conversation.\n\nHowever the public are quite upset and angry over this and called it merely a publicity stunt. The residents of Naroda Patiya criticized this publicity and disapproved with the re-naming of tea stalls. One of the resident said, why only one muslim tea stall was asked rename in Odhav area when there are hundreds of tea stalls. The past may be past but the riots mark will remain in Gujarat state history as long as the city lives. Adding to this, seeking peoples votes one should earn respect. There are even allegations that BJP workers are forcing few of them to change the name of tea stall and while quite a few are outrightly rejecting the proposal.\n\nTill now over 100 tea stalls have been renamed after Narendra Modi and soon they are planning to launch this campaign in Ahmedabad also. Bharatiya Yuva Janata Morcha leader Prakash Gurjar is taking care of this campaign and has been actively moving his men. But when asked about the allegations that came, he dismissed them. “The first tea stall we renamed belongs to muslim community person. We asked him whether he has any objection or not, he voluntarily agreed. We don't threaten anyone and we have few people who have obstructed our campaign. So we have moved to another,” added Gurjar.\n\n(AW: Vamshi)\n\nThe Telangana tangle has reached the climax episode and with the bill getting placed in Lok Sabha tomorrow all eyes are on the Seemandhra MPs and Union Ministers. So far no one of Seemandhra region leaders compromised with Congress high command and few MPs have threatened to take bold steps if Congress decides to go ahead with its plans.\n\nSeemandhra MPs\n\nAnakapalli MP Sabbam Hari made sensational statements that he would burn himself in the Lok Sabha during the time of tabling the Telangana Bill and also claimed that two more MPs would do the same. While Rayapati Sambasiva Rao has said unexpected things may happen if T-bill is tabled. With the Congress expelling the six MPs who gave no confidence motion, MPs got more freedom to protest in the Lok Sabha. Well nobody has a clear idea of what will happen tomorrow but surely one can say that things might slip out of situation.\n\nUnion Ministers\n\nLike the MPs, Seemandhra Central ministers for the first time protested in Lok Sabha today causing interruption to the Railway budget. KS Rao who has been in the party over four decades said that he would quit to his ministry post but would remain the Congress men while Tourism minister Chiranjeevi has requested the Congress high command to re-think its decision on the creation of Telangana. Another Minister Daggubati Purandeshwari has said she would quit the post and to the Congress party if Congress is likely to table the Telangana bill. Pallam Raju too expressed his displeasure that Center did not consider their recommendations and may vote against the Telangana bill.\n\nCM Kiran to resign\n\nAndhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy is likely to resign tomorrow and reports say that he say already sent this resignation to AP Governor ESL Narasimhan. As CM Kiran challenged the Center if the same Bill sent to AP Assembly is placed in the Parliament that he would resign, CM Kiran seems to be firm on the decision. Followed by more than 60 MLAs and State ministers are expected to resign to create a political crisis in the state. CM Kiran has been defying the bifurcation since beginning and is likely establish a new party after resignation.\n\nOverall developments in the Delhi and Andhra Pradesh seems to be out of the hand and Congress may pay huge price for going ahead with the bifurcation process. Meanwhile BJP is also concerned about the Seemandhra demands and said it would support the Telangana bill only when the concerns of the Seemandhra people are cleared. With no clue whats going to happen tomorrow, the coming 24 hours are going to be very crucial.\n\n(AW: Vamshi)\n\nWith betting and spot fixing allegations Indian Premier League [IPL] reputation has degraded and many opine that Franchise owners itself are the real fixers and everything goes according to the plan of BCCI. But all these are just allegations and as these claims are hurting Board of Control for Cricket in India [BCCI] and IPL, it has stepped in to prove that IPL is free of corruption and other allegations. BCCI will launch a campaign called Clean IPL and Sachin Tendulkar and Sourva Ganguly will be actively campaign for this.\n\nBCCI is also putting efforts to present this campaign available in most of the important Indian languages. Sachin will present this Clean IPL campaign in Marati while Dada in Bengali. The Clean IPL campaign will kick start in March and wants to ensure fans that IPL is an authentic game before the start of this year edition.\n\nThe 2013 edition of IPL was hit by spot fixing allegations and cricketer Sreeshanth has been banned for life from playing cricket. And days back the Justice Mudgal Committee reported the Chennai Super Kings former principal Gurunath Meiyappan [Son-in-law of BCCI President N Srinivasan] was found guilty. This Committee also submitted a sealed cover report the two current Indian players were involved in fixing however the names weren't disclosed. Sources say that Indian captain MS Dhoni name is rumored to reported but have not been made public as it would shake the entire nation.\n\nGiven the reputation of Sachin and Ganguly who played fairly and brought more fame to the country, richness to cricket, BCCI wants to end all the speculation of fixing on IPL. This is a good move but Sachin and Ganguly have retired from Cricket now. How can these players say that the boys of IPL teams are not involved in fixing ? Campaign may only act like an advertisement which only shows the good. The bad and ugly will be kept under the mat for sure.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Mudgal Committee report hearing is on March 7 and if the apex court still keeps the submitted report confidential then speculations will get more strong. If the reports are true then will BCCI axe Chennai Super Kings from IPL and MS Dhoni from Cricket ? Well we don't have answers for these questions as long as N Srinivasan chairs the President role. We have seen how stubborn Srinivasan is from stepping down of the post despite the Supreme Court's directions in the past. And moreover banning MS Dhoni from cricket would the biggest controversy ever as Dhoni is also the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award winner [India's highest award from sportsmen].\n\nTo completely eradicate corruption and fixing allegations some bold steps are seriously need to be taken for the future of Indian cricket.\n\n(AW: Vamshi)\n\nThe day Arvind Kejriwal promised as the Chief Minister of Delhi, the common man in India smiled and everyone thought it would change the politics in the nation. However, with Kejriwal resigning to the post on Friday over the Jan Lokpal Bill not getting approval, the common man again went into back into same position who could do nothing rather to wait for elections.\n\nKejriwal's 49 days of rule in Delhi was much talked all over the country as there are many ups and downs. Despite loads of criticism AAP managed to take some key decision which stressed the need of common man. Here is the good, bad and ugly of AAP.\n\nGood:\n\nKejriwal banned the red beacons and also refused to Z category security. He also turned down to take a special bunglow for the chief minister and as assured he would lead a normal life even after chairing the CM post he did. But initially he accepted to move to spacious and luxury three bedroom flat, later he declined as many cried foul over it. Then came the promises that he made. Kejriwal announced 700 litres of water to the people with regular water connection and 50% power subsidy for those consuming up to 400 units. Kejriwal took a bold decision by ordering CAG audit over the power discoms. A Helpline to crub corruption was announced on January 8th and it was launched on 13th of the same month. SIT probe against 1984 riots and Commomwealth Games’ street light project were also ordered by AAP government.\n\nBad: [Controversy]\n\nDelhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti was involved in a controversy of conducting raids where the African women are reportedly harassed by AAP activists. Somnath also fought with the Delhi Police who refused to conduct raids on his orders. Ironically Delhi Police filed cases against Law Minister Somnath Bharti and his supporters. Kejriwal backed Somnath in every move and claimed there was nothing wrong in Somnath's raids. He staged a dharna at Rail Bhavan over Delhi Police and demanded the Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde to suspend them immediately. However, Sushil just sent them on a holiday and Kejriwal too withdrew his protest. His protest lasted for 36 hours, Kejriwal slept on the road being the Chief Minister.\n\nUgly: [Rebel MLA]\n\nVinod Kumar Binny was most controversial candidate ever placed by AAP. He expressed his displeasure the day he was not made part of the council of cabinet. However the issue was sorted out within hours and Vinod too compromised. Later on January 26th Vinod Kumar Binny was expelled from Party for doing anti- works against the AAP government. On this Vinod went on protest but did not catch the public attention. Vinod threatened to withdraw support but said he would the government if the Jan Lokpal bill is placed.\n\nApart from this, Kejriwal ordered the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) to file an FIR against India's business tycoon Mukesh Ambani, Oil minister Veerappa Moily Milind Deora for increasing the price of natural gas produced in India. On February 3rd the AAP cabinet cleared the Jan Lokpal bill which the party's agenda for the elections. On 12th of the same, cabinet gave approval for holding special meeting to discuss about the Jan Lokpal bill. Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung told the Delhi Assembly speaker not to table the Jan Lokpal Bill, but the government did it. On February 13th the Jan Lokpal bill was deferred by 27-47 in the assembly as a result Arvind Kejriwal and all the ministers of AAP resigned to their respective post citing BJP and Congress disruption.\n\nSignificantly nothing was achieved by AAP government to bring smile on the common man face. They might have stayed in power as there is ample of time to take on the Jan Lokpal Bill. Everything won't happen over night so AAP would have stayed in power. But owing to their promise an honest decision was taken by AAP. Kejriwal suggested for dissolution of Assembly to Lieutenant Governor but he rejected and imposed the President's Rule. The assembly will stay in animation mode till any party claims the majority. Now as things ran out of AAP hand, the party has focused on Lok Sabha elections due this May. AAP is likely to gain in this showing the nature of political parties over the Lokpal bill issue. AAP will contest in 350 seats in LS polls but how many does it will win the elections matters a lot.\n\n(AW: Vamshi)\n\nYes the 60 years struggle of Telangana has come to an end now. Telangana is a reality and thanks to the students, leader and most importantly the people of Telangana who stood up to the self respect slogan. We all know the history but here we are providing glimpses of it.\n\nIt all started in the year 1948, when Indian Army in the name of “Operation Polo” tried to get inside the Hyderabad state [in which Telangana is also a part] for the dissolution of it in India. However, quite a few districts from Hyderabad state got mixed with Maharashtra, Karnataka and only the Ten districts of Telangana was left out in Hyderabad state. In 1952, elections were held for the first time in Hyderabad state and Burgula Ramakrishna Rao became the first chief minister of the state. 1956 according to the Linguistic basis, Andhra Pradesh formed with merging of Telangana with Andhra state which got separated from Madras state. Telangana people weren't happy with the decision ever since then. However the issue was always over looked by the Prime Ministers of India. In 1969, Telangana agitations reached peak level. The moment turned violent also, around 300 students were shot in the police firing. Marri Chenna Reddy a prominent leader of Hyderabad took up the agitations and again the moment gained importance in the year 1972. He established Telangana Praja Samithi and won 11 Parliament seats. However Chenna Reddy preferred Chief Minister post and Governor post offered by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and cooled the Telangana agitations.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party again took up the issue in the year 1997. They went into 1999 General Elections with one vote and two states slogan. Nevertheless, this time Telangana statehood was rested as BJP had an alliance with Telugu Desam Party which is dead opposite against it. In the year 2001 K Chandrasekhar Rao from walked out of Telugu Desam Party as he was denied ministry post. He established Telangana Rashtra samithi [TRS ] party. TRS party again brought hope for the Telangana region and Indian National Congress shortly known as Congress party under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi agreed for the separate state of Telangana. In 2004 general elections, TRS and Congress together went for elections and won established government in both Andhra Pradesh as well as at the national capital. In 2006, TRS Chief K Chandrasekhar Rao claimed Sonia Gandhi was in favor of announcing separate state but due to unknown reasons it got stalled.\n\nIn 2009 elections though Congress was in favor of Telangana, it was the Chief Minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy who stood against the bifurcation and luckily he won the elections. YS was completely against the bifurcation and Congress too did not give much importance to the issue as it won elections again. Then a huge turn took with YS death, the political situation in state was completely down. KCR went for a hunger strike and on December 9, 2009 P Chidambaram announced that creation of Telangana was initiated. But the Seemandhra region [rest of AP] leaders did not accept this and resigned in huge numbers. From then on agitations became part and parcel of Andhra Pradesh with pro and anti Telangana issue.\n\nIn 2013 Congress Working Committe gave green signal to creation of Telangana. On October 3rd same year the Union Cabinet cleared the Telangana note. On December 12th President of India has sent the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Bill to the AP Assembly to say its opinion on the T-Bill. But as the Chief Minister of AP hails from Seemandhra region, Kiran Kumar Reddy tried all his efforts to stall the process. The Assembly even rejected the Reorganization Bill sent by President of India. However the Central government went ahead with bifurcation process. Finally today on February 18th, the 15th Lok Sabha cleared the Telangana Bill.\n\n(AW: Vamshi)\n\nKiran Kumar Reddy has crowned the Chief Minister post without any experience. When he was selected by the Congress High Command, many criticized the decision with lack of experience in handling the minister post but Kiran took up the challenge right away. His tenure had loads of hurdles like the Telangana issue, YS Jagan factor etc. Kiran promised as the 16th chief minister of Andhra Pradesh on November 25th 2010.\n\nComing to the Telangana issue, Kiran initially clarified that he would abide the decision of the Congress party and so he made sure all the Telangana supporters withdrew their respective agitations like the Sakala Janula Samme. Events like Million March turned violent but Kiran handled them tactically. But when the Congress high command took a decision on Telangana creation, Kiran was silent for first two weeks. However as the oppositions and people started agitating, Kiran for first in his political career spoke against the Party's decision. From then on Kiran has making all the statements and fought every bit to stop the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nKiran was the sole reason for APNGOs indefinite strike, they held an united Andhra Pradesh meeting in Hyderabad. With this Kiran sent strong signals to Congress high command but things did not run smoothly for him. He waited patiently for Telangana bill to arrive from the President of India. As the Assembly Affair minister being from Telangana region the bill was introduced without the concern of Kiran. This irked him and without wasting any time, Kiran changed the Assembly Affair portfolio to the Seemandhra region minister. As the debate on Telangana started, Kiran waited for his turn. He did lot of research to attack the Telangana MLAs. With appropriate figures and study on Controversial matters, Kiran's speech on Telangana in Assembly drew huge appreciation from the all regions of crowd. Then Kiran made a move by issuing notice of rejecting the Telangana bill in Assembly which embarrassed his own Party.\n\nKiran further challenged that if the Telangana bill is placed in Parliament, he dared that would quit the post. On February 4th Kiran staged a protest in the National Capital against the bifurcation where the national media and all political parties fired at Congress for not controlling their partymen. Finally Kiran resigned to the post of Chief Minister sticking to his words. In his last speech as Chief Minister, Kiran accused even BJP for joining hands with Congress in dividing the state.\n\nKiran has lead the United Andhra Pradesh from the front. Unlike other politicians who wait for the right time to bag the Chief Minister post like cunning fox [including Chiranjeevi], Kiran has stood by his words and proved a true warrior who fought for keeping Andhra Pradesh united. What next in Kiran's agenda, will he float a party is something AP is eagerly waiting to know.\n\n(AW: Vamshi)\n\nHere is summary of leaders who expressed their views on Telangana Bill in Rajya Sabha yesterday.\n\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh: amidst protest Manmohan Singh started his speech on the Telangana Bill. He assured that Seemandhra region will be given Special Status for five years and Hyderabad will remain as joint capital for 10 years. Manmohan proposed a six point formula for the development of Seemandhra region.\n\nBJP Leader Venkaiah Naidu: We are in favor in creation of Telangana but at the same time all the demands of Seemandhra region should be solved to remove their concerns. Seemandhra will fall in financial problems by losing Hyderabad as it was the capital, so the central government should allocate special package for Seemandhra region. Also a special railway zone for Seemandhra region, Uttarandhra and Rayalaseema should be identified as backward zones. Congress party could not control their own leaders and their CM has resigned to the party against bifurcation and still there is no action against its members. This shows Congress double stand on Telangana. Our party forced the government for amendments but they are in no mood to take up those.\n\nChiranjeevi: Being a Congressmen it is unfortunate that my party is going ahead with bifurcation. Though I’m against the division of Andhra Pradesh, I will abide by Congress party decision. If bifurcation is unavoidable then I demand for Union Territory status to Hyderabad. All the development happened around Hyderabad as it has been the capital of Andhra Pradesh for the past 60 years. Chandrababu Naidu’s party could not take any decision on Telangana and their party members are divided over the issue.\n\nBSP Chief Mayawati: I support the creation of Telangana as it is a long standing wish of the people of the region. As father of Constitution Ambedkar said, better governance with smaller states, BSP supports the creation of Telangana. Special package was announced only to Seemandhra but I demand a special package for Telangana region too as many leaders in house agreed that Telangana is backward region too. At the same time, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly moved a resolution to divide the state when BSP was in government but sadly the Center government did not bother about the division of Uttar Pradesh. When divisions of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh happened the newly formed states were announced the new capitals right away so BSP demands the central government should make official the new capital of Seemandhra right away.\n\nSitaram Yechuri: our party is completely against the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. At this moment I remember the great lines of Gurajada Apparao “Deshamante Matti Kadoyi, Deshamante Manushulu”. As we are against the division of Andhra Pradesh we don’t want to recommend any amendments in the Bill.\n\nParties, Trinamul Congress, Shiv Sena, Samajwadi Party, DMK, CPM and BJD members opposed the Bill. Seemandhra TDP and Congress MPs protested near the Speaker’s podium throughout the debate on Telangana Bill, MP KVP Ramchander Rao collapsed in house because of back ache. Speaker directed the Parliament Affairs minister Kamal Nath to take KVP to hospital. But KVP refused to take medication and continued his agitation sitting down on the floor. TDP MP CM Ramesh rejected the bill.\n\nParties NCP, CPI, RJD, LJP along with Congress MPs MA Khan, V Hanumantha Rao, TDP MPs Devender Goud, Gundu Sudha Rani and Sujana Choudary supported the bifurcation of Telangana. TDP Sujana demanded that the bill should take the opinion of Attorney General as it has the legal issues.\n\nThe amendments proposed by BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu were turned down in a dramatic way. All the government amendments were accepted with ease and in the last CPM party demanded for a voting in the Bill. But speaker rejected the proposal as MPs were protesting at his podium. So CPM walked out in protest. With Voice Vote, Telangana Bill got passed in Rajya Sabha effortlessly.\n\n(AW: Vamshi)"
