        "text": "The available literature on the Telangana movement offers historical, political, and economic perspectives that define Telangana as a ‘back- ward’ region and the movement as an offshoot to this backwardness. The backwardness generally discussed pertains to the economic standing of the people of Telangana. From the vantage point of a fresh perspective, this chapter uses regional culture to understand the emergence of the mass movement. It explores the context in which the idea of statehood for Telangana took shape and discusses how the movement can be understood as a new social movement.The chapter also attempts to understand the contours of the movement’s history in terms of how the culture of Telangana was marginalized, and how Telangana activists, especially employees and students, mobilized against the dominant Andhra culture, leading ultimately to widespread, robust cultural assertion.\n\nPolitics in the state of Telangana are akin to politics in post-colonial nations. Where the party that spearheads demand for statehood enjoys massive support and becomes the natural heir of the movement and the throne. This however also is coupled with enormous burden and expectations of the people to lift them from social and economic backwardness and poverty. So far the natural heir of the separate Telangana movement, TRS(Telangana Rashtra Samiti) has successfully and deftly managed the politics of the state meeting many expectations of the people. However, the state politics happens in the context of weak opposition and weak civil society to provide robust criticism of the development politics pursued by the TRS. Secondly the politics in the state is characterized by high stakes on symbolic capital and what is often glibly called as 'Telangana sentiment'. While the TRS government has so far met sufficient symbolic and emotional needs of the people, the real burden of raising the standards of living of the people and meeting the concrete expectations of the people, depends on going beyond mobilizing symbolic politics and translating the prolific promises made to people into reality. The state of Telangana is basically a small farmer dominated agricultural state with only marginal industrialization; and extreme prevalence of tertiary sector. In such developmental contexts it will be interesting to see how far the government of TRS can realize the promises it made to the people. Major challenges are lifting the standards and quality of life of agriculture based population, and developing manufacturing industry, which can divert educated younger population from agriculture to industry. These are the two concrete challenges that are going to test the limits of symbolic and identity politics of the present TRS government; though one can see that the government is definitely moving in the direction of meeting the above said needs.\n\nThe paper explores the demand for separate Telangana State out of Andhra Pradesh. In the process an effort is made to find out the legitimacy of the claims made by the supporters of Telangana state. Recent India has witnessed an upsurge in the demand for the creation of new states. Though such demands has not been new one as the history of India shows ample of such examples where the regions have been demanding separate statehood. The change that has surfaced now is the shift in the nature of these demands. Earlier the reorganization was insisted on the basis of language and ethnicity but now the claims are made more on the grounds of administrative efficiency and economic development. The unequal development of regions, unequal access to political power and introduction of economic reforms has all led to the demands for the creation of new states.\n\nThe paper, based on secondary literature, makes an effort to historically trace the Left politics within the region of Telangana. While tracing this trajectory it confronts the politics of anti-colonial struggles, internal social conflicts in the local societies and struggles for class/caste supremacy in the region. It locates the formation of the famous Telangana struggle of the 1940s within the complex world of these conflicts and tries to understand the commitment of the Left politics to wage a struggle for the downtrodden of the area. In the process of framing a politics of resistance the Left has been historically not only waging a war against the dominant hegemonic forces but also within its own politics trying to grapple with the socio-economic realities on the ground and the political strategies to be devised. The paper while trying to understand this also reflects on the limitations of the Left politics. This allows the paper to come down to the later post-independence period and make sense of the fragmentation of the Left in the region and locate some of the reasons for it. It concludes that despite so much internal debate leading to splits and mergers the Left still fails to command the kind of support that it should have given the conditions of impoverishment and deprivation in the area.\n\nTelugu Desam Party (TDP) started its maiden political venture in united Andhra Pradesh under the slogan of linguistic identity's pride. Surprisingly, in a record time after its establishment, TDP captured impressive victory and formed a government in 1983. Though TDP based its political slogan and agenda on mastering Telugu people's pride, in reality, it had succinct hidden challenges to face and address. One such prominent challenge was in the Telangana region, now called Telangana State (TS). The present paper highlights, based on what factors, the TDP was politically successful. Furthermore, based on what kind of other factors the TDP faced almost vanquished position in the subsequent times in TS. Methodologically, the paper engages in qualitative and secondary electoral data synthesis. Moreover, the paper constructs about 35 years of TDP's political lineage from 'consolidation to fragmentation' in Telangana.\n\nand Keywords The available literature on the Telangana movement offers historical, political, and economic perspectives that define Telangana as a 'backward' region and the movement as an offshoot to this backwardness. The backwardness generally discussed pertains to the economic standing of the people of Telangana. From the vantage point of a fresh perspective, this chapter uses regional culture as a vantage point to understand the emergence of the mass movement. It explores the context in which the idea of separate statehood for Telangana took shape and discusses how the movement can be understood as a new social movement. The chapter also attempts to understand the contours of the movement's history in terms of how the culture of Telangana was marginalized and how Telangana activists, especially employees and students, mobilized against the dominant Andhra culture, leading ultimately to widespread, robust cultural assertion."
