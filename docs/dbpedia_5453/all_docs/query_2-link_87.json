        "text": "David Crockett was a pioneer, soldier, and politician. He was born near the town of Limestone, Tenn. in 1786. David Crockett Birthplace State Park commemorates the birthplace of this famous Tennessean. In 1817, he moved to Lawrence County. While serving in Congress, he fought for his people’s right to keep land they had settled on in the new frontier of West Tennessee. Crockett died at the Alamo Mission in March of 1836 while aiding the Texans in their fight for independence from Mexico. David Crockett Birthplace State Park became a state park in 1973.\n\nThe mission of Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park is to interpret the life of David Crockett, the historical setting of his birth, and the impact he had on our developing nation’s history through historically accurate displays, events and programs."
