        "text": "David Crockett State Park was dedicated in May of 1959, in honor of one of Tennessee's most famous native sons.\n\nHistory\n\nDavid Crockett was a pioneer, soldier, politician, industrialist and was born near the little town of Limestone in northeast Tennessee in 1786. In 1817, he moved to Lawrence County and served as a justice of the peace, a colonel of the militia, and as state representative. Along the banks of Shoal Creek, in what is now his namesake park, he established a diversified industry consisting of a powdermill, a gristmill and a distillery. All three operations were washed away in a flood in September, 1821. Financial difficulties from this loss caused Crockett to move to West Tennessee where he was elected to Congress. While in Washington, he fought for his people's right to keep land they had settled on the new frontier of West Tennessee. Crockett died at the Alamo Mission in March of 1836 while aiding the Texans in their fight for independence from Mexico.\n\nBiking\n\nA paved bicycle trail carries you through the woods where you may see deer, squirrels, rabbits and turkey in addition to a lot of feathered friends. You can stop at the environmental classroom overlook shelter and view the area where Crocketts' industrial operations were located on Shoal Creek below Crockett Falls. You finish your ride at the swimming pool parking lot. You can return by the same route or ride on the main park road leading from the front of the park restaurant.\n\nBoating\n\nThe park does operate a boat rental area.
