        "text": "1955\n\n//////////\n\nRobert Manley MPA writes, “Having incorporated the Center for Global Responsibility, a small think tank, in 2009, I’m working to finish two books, one focusing on the concept of and dimensions of global responsibility, the other on aspects of my background relevant to the GR orientation.”\n\n1963\n\n//////////\n\nStephen Sloane MPA, who, after a career as a naval officer now serves on the faculty at Saint Mary’s College of California, has been awarded the Best Ethnographic Symposium Best Paper Award by the University of Liverpool for his paper “The Inspired Maverick: Dirty Harry Lives on the Edge.”\n\n1966 / 50th Reunion\n\n//////////\n\n1967\n\n//////////\n\nHarry Harris MC/MPA says retirement continues to elude him. After a long career in government and academia, he remains as founder and president of HealthCare California. Entering the 11th year, the company maintains its position as the largest home health agency in central California. With the Affordable Care Act and a dynamic health care industry, the company’s achievements abound. At the same time, Harry is an inveterate global traveler enjoying the pleasures of new adventures and establishing friendships along with occasional consultancies.\n\n1970\n\n//////////\n\nGeoff Dutton MCRP continues to work as a technical writer/editor and enjoys writing articles and stories on many topics. “Find a selection at cowbird.com. My work in software and IT for a long time made me innovation-averse, and so I’m working on a book describing how digital technologies are fundamentally changing humanity and what drives these changes. In October I’ll present a paper at the Digital Earth Summit summarizing my work in the field of discrete global grids that I began at a fecund lab in the GSD that just had a 50th birthday party!\n\n1971 / 45th Reunion\n\n//////////\n\nGibbs Kinderman MC/MPA writes, “I read with unease the description in the latest HKS Magazine of the new HKS behemoth under construction. Has the school developed an edifice complex? In the first MPP class (1969–70) we had one room in Littauer and a stellar cast of teachers. An epigram defined an ideal college as ‘Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other.’ We had that amazing chemistry in the baby MPP program. Are spontaneity and personhood surviving in the new mega-Kennedy School?”\n\n1972\n\n//////////\n\nHenry “Duke” Ryan MC/MPA writes, “My book, Turning Points: Stories of Crime, Love, and Faith, became available last November. It consists of four short novels that have been called ‘a mature mixture of realism, romance, and thrills . . . Immensely entertaining and at the same time thought-provoking’ (BookWire). The stories ask, ‘What is evil, what is sin, what is the power of love and its loss?’ These questions can force themselves upon us, making everything else insignificant, as they do with the characters in these four stories.”\n\n1974\n\n//////////\n\nJay Urwitz MPP has been named deputy general counsel of the U.S. Department of Education, after 32 years at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. After receiving his MPP and law degrees, he clerked for a federal appeals court judge. He was then the legislative assistant for domestic policy for Senator Edward Kennedy. At WilmerHale, he practiced education law and was on the executive committee. Prior to joining the government, Jay was a trustee of Teachers College, Columbia University and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. He has written for a number of publications.\n\n1976 / 40th Reunion\n\n//////////\n\nSheila Burns MCRP writes, “Armed with my notable degree from HKS, I am fortunate to have made a contribution to my community in the field of public transportation and public policy. I am thankful for my many blessings, including a thriving logistics business, great friends, and most importantly, a loving and supportive family, which now includes my boy/girl twin grandbabies. Here’s hoping the next decade brings continued blessings!!”\n\nWendy Gray MPP writes, “Classmates and I mourn the recent death of our dear friend Laurie Miller MPP after a yearlong battle with brain cancer. After graduation, Laurie served as special assistant to Secretary Joseph Califano and deputy commissioner of the Administration for Children, Youth and Families at HEW. She attended Yale Law School. Upon graduating in 1988, Laurie clerked for Justice Byron White and then became a trial lawyer, focusing on government investigations and white-collar defense. Active in numerous professional organizations, Laurie loved and supported the arts and mentored students. We will remember her insatiable, passionate love of learning and fun.”\n\nShalom Saar MC/MPA says the past few years have been very exciting. “Serving as a full-time professor of leadership at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing. CKGSB is a leading business school in China and has just established a partnership with HKS. My book, Leading With Conviction, published by Wiley, is doing very well and will be going through a second edition. I am currently working on my book on China, comparing Western with Chinese executives’ ways of thinking. I also worked as a strategic advisor to Moshe Kahlon, who is now serving as the minister of finance in Israel.”\n\n1977\n\n//////////\n\nBill Ballenger MC/MPA writes, “Two years ago I sold my subscription newsletter, Inside Michigan Politics, which I founded in 1987, but I’m still writing for it. Also continuing my TV and radio stuff as well as a lot of public speaking to trade groups, PACs, and professional associations.”\n\nAlfred Marcus PhD, professor of strategy and technological leadership at the University of Minnesota, has published Innovations in Sustainability: Fuel and Food (Cambridge University Press).\n\nMichael Phillips MCRP was recognized by the FDIC board of directors with the Douglas H. Jones Award for outstanding legal counsel at the FDIC. He has served in the FDIC’s Legal Division since 1989 and has been active in the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n1979\n\n//////////\n\nRina Spence MC/MPA has been named the honorary consul for Monaco in Boston, covering the New England states.\n\n1980\n\n//////////\n\nAlexandra Schweitzer MPP recently joined an amazing start-up, Iora Health, founded by Rushika Fernandopulle MPP 1994 to transform health care. “My job is to help bridge the work and cultures between our health plan sponsors (lots of rules and regulations) and our practice operations (built to break the rules and put patients first, always). Very energizing and inspiring to be so close to the front lines of bringing humanity to health care.”\n\n1981 / 35th Reunion\n\n//////////\n\nEdward Edelson MC/MPA is running for his third term as the chief elected official of Southbury, Connecticut. “As the only Democrat to ever be reelected, I have had strong and vocal opposition from local Republicans since my reelection in 2013. They have brought frivolous lawsuits against me and accused me of many ridiculous and untrue things. Sound familiar? However, I still feel it is a rewarding position where I can use my skills and background to improve the quality of life for this town. Governance at any level is hard work.”\n\nRichard Paton MC/MPA published his second management book. He will be teaching an MPA course, at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, on leadership in nonprofit organizations. His book is Leading Business Associations: Making Successful Transitions.\n\n1982\n\n//////////\n\nAhmad Chowdhury MC/MPA writes, “Hi, my classmates, I would love to know your present status and continue our connections. An email from you would be welcome.”\n\nGuy de Fontgalland MC/MPA is launching an NGO dedicated to providing assistance to remote and deprived rural schools in developing countries — providing financial assistance mainly for repair and enhancement of physical facilities as well as building new low-cost schools in remote areas. “We plan to work in cooperation with ministries of education in each target country. We also plan to leverage our assistance program to build community-focused education programs as part of our strategy to assist schools in nation building — peace, economic development, and social cohesion among rural communities. Wish to be connected with interested HKS alumni and students.”\n\nElliot Gordon MPP writes, “After a 30-year litigation career, I have become a full-time arbitrator and mediator in Los Angeles, with a primary focus on health care, employment, and complex litigation matters.”\n\n1983\n\n//////////\n\nNed Daly MCRP reports that his short video Pastiche Vol1 No1 (2014) was an official selection of the 2015 Arlington International Film Festival (held last October) and was selected for screening at the Bideodromo 2015 in Bilbao, Spain. A French-language version was released in 2015.\n\nDenise Fort HKSEE writes, “I’m working on climate change mitigation, as so many of us are. In particular, trying to reduce the use of coal by electric utilities and supporting the control of methane (a potent greenhouse gas) by the oil and gas industry. Glad to collaborate with others in the field.”\n\nKay Goss HKSEE was elected U.S. president of The International Emergency Management Society and selected as 2015 Distinguished Alum of the Year at the University of Arkansas.\n\nVerna McDaniel MC/MPA writes, “Greetings, class of 1983! After a long career in public service, I retired in May of 2015. I am back on contract until they find a new county administrator for Washtenaw County, Michigan. Go to ewashtenaw.org.”\n\nMuhammad Siddiqi MC/MPA has been teaching in the management school of a public university since his retirement from civil service in 2002. “Discussing the governance issues, I give a reference to what is happening in the United States and other developed and developing countries. Fortunately, I have visited more than 40 countries on official visits, and acquired a global perspective. I enjoy sharing this knowledge with MPA students. My association with HKS is a feather in my cap — Harvard certainly has a unique distinction in the academic world. I am promoting the cause of education in so many ways!”\n\n1984\n\n//////////\n\nDavid Barol MPP recently published The Long Green Tunnel, an adventure book that also explores relationships, communities, and dreams.\n\nMichael Cichon MC/MPA, after 27 years in the UN system (i.e., the International Labour Office), was elected president of the International Council on Social Welfare in 2012 (mandate expires in 2016) and appointed professor of social protection at the Graduate School of Governance at the United Nations University in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in 2013.\n\nCarol Landsman MPP writes, “After 30 years as a transportation planner — thank you Tony Gomez-Ibañez — I shuttered my consulting practice last year and retired. I am loving it. Doing political activism work, Palestinian solidarity and police accountability, volunteer work with women entering or reentering the job market, traveling — I held a baby orangutan in my arms — playing tennis and weight lifting. I can bench 285. Life is good.”\n\nNam Pham MPA was appointed assistant secretary for business development and international trade by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker in January 2015. Nam oversees the Massachusetts Office of Business Development, Office of Travel and Tourism, Office of International Trade, Film Office, and Sport Marketing Office.\n\n1985\n\n//////////\n\nTessie Catsambas MPP founded EnCompass LLC in 1999 with Laverne Webb MPA 1984. “We work in leadership development, training and e-learning, and evaluation. A recent evaluation of Brazil’s Early Childhood Development Initiative brought me to Harvard, where I interviewed Ron Heifetz, whose adaptive leadership model is part of the Initiative. What a joy to circle back to HKS! Now, with the 30th HKS reunion, the MPP 1985 class has been reconnecting, and it is great to see all the good things everyone is doing! From cyber security to the U.S. Congress, from social service to defense. Yeah MPPs ’85!”\n\nKen Davies MC/MPA has just moved to Jinja, Uganda, upon retirement from the UN, after 26 years in Africa, Asia, and World Food Programme headquarters in Rome. “Old friends welcome for a visit and would love to hear from you. Greetings to all.”\n\nFrances Fabian MPP was promoted to associate professor in management at the Fogelman College of Business and Economics at the University of Memphis. She devotes her time to multiple research projects, PhD mentoring, and class teaching, concentrating on entrepreneurship.\n\nDarryl Garrett HKSEE has been selected as the senior coach for Washington Mayor Bowser’s FitDC initiative, a city-wide effort to improve the health and fitness of DC citizens. He also has been appointed as a docent for the CIA Museum. In September he received his certificate in health coaching from Georgetown University. He continues to serve on the boards of Hitachi Data Systems Federal and AvePoint Public Sector, and as a consultant within the intelligence community.\n\nGabriela Romanow MC/MPA writes, “Life took us on an unwelcome turn in 2014 when our then 20-year-old son was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a rare auto-immune disease of the central nervous system. Since then, I’ve retooled my time to focus on raising money to find treatments and a cure.” See diningfornmo.org.\n\n1986 / 30th Reunion\n\n//////////\n\nDavid Boghossian MC/MPA writes, “Enterprise Innovation Partners continues apace advising growth-stage companies including AthenaHealth, BigBelly Solar, K-School start-up OpportunitySpace, and others. Formed a partnership with Arjuna Capital to invest in ‘for benefit’ companies and other mission-driven impact investments that yield competitive financial returns and solve societal problems. We’re about halfway to the target $40 million fund. Elizabeth and I enjoy hosting alumni board members Bob Ferri, Wendy Pangburn (chair!), and David Rosenberg when they come to Cambridge and usually can gather the usual suspects — Steve Singer, Jim Corcoran, the Harvey/Griesemers (Bryan Harvey and J. Griesemer), all MC/MPA 1986, and others for the customary frivolity. Join in!”\n\nCasey Corr MC/MPA is living in Yakima, Washington, and editing an international magazine that covers the tree fruit and wine grape industries.\n\nDaniel Forster MC/MPA recently published an eBook titled The Winter Bird, a novel about Alaska. “The book mixes my own actual experience as planning director for the world’s largest municipality, Inuit history and legends, arctic living, with a bit of horror added for drama. The story covers a broad swath reaching back to ancient Egypt, prejudice, climate concerns, oil and gas development, voracity of the press, and staying true to one’s core values and maintaining cultural values in changing times.”\n\nJohn Irany MC/MPA argues in his recently published book, Before 1492: The Portuguese Discovery of America, that Portuguese mariners, who were the preeminent European explorers in the last half of the 15th century, stumbled upon the New World at least a decade before Columbus set sail from Spain on his historic voyage. The evidence — in a map now on permanent display in the Library of Congress and in pre-Columbian European artifacts left behind in America — is abundantly clear if we discard the fixed notions drilled into us since the third grade. The book is refreshingly not-taught-at-Harvard nautical history.\n\nFelisa Tibbitts MPP writes, “Bonjour! I’ve relocated to Brussels to head up research for Education International (www.ei-ie.org), the world’s largest federation of unions, representing over 30 million educational personnel worldwide. The advocacy work of EI dovetails well with my passion for human rights and education, and I’m enjoying being based in Europe again. Friends, let me know if you will be passing through Brussels. We can enjoy together some of the city’s legendary food and beer!”\n\n1987\n\n//////////\n\nLuise Druke Crousillat MC/MPA was elected cochair of the Inter University Committee on International Migration at MIT. As a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School and fellow of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, she published her last book on innovations for refugee protection in January 2014, which was presented at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School and Law School. Luise married Michel Crousillat from southern France in a beautiful ceremony at Harvard Memorial Church in April 2015, which can all be viewed at youtube.com/user/luisedruke. Michel will be coteaching European politics and modern French literature at Harvard (HILR) with Luise. “Greetings to all!”\n\nNadine Hack MC/MPA was awarded Mentor of the Year by the Association of Professional Coaches, Trainers & Consultants. The award was presented in London at an international ceremony.\n\nJim Klocke MPA has been appointed chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network, a 750-member statewide association.\n\nIan McAuley MC/MPA writes, “For me, the enduring take-home message from HKS was Herman Leonard’s aphorism ‘The hard jobs are left to the public sector.’ Drawing on his inspiration, with a colleague, Miriam Lyons, I wrote a book about the good work of government. Governomics: Can We Afford Small Government, was published by Melbourne University Press last year. Our finding: ‘small government’ comes at a cost — lost opportunities to contribute to the collective good, corrosive inequality, and the need to pay more for privatized services than we save in taxes.”\n\nJoyce Murphy MC/MPA, executive vice chancellor of UMass Medical School’s Commonwealth Medicine division, was appointed to the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare board of directors in October. “The Schwartz Center is critical to improving the current health care delivery system, which must work to construct a better framework to support enhanced compassion in the delivery of care.”\n\nJosef Reum MC/MPA reports that the board of trustees at George Washington University awarded him professor emeritus status. Josef has returned to full-time consulting with private sector organizations, NGOs, higher ed, and philanthropies. His more than a decade of public service, 20+ years in the academy (14 in a decanal role), and commitment to organizational development and leadership “in the moment” all coalesce to make this next step remarkable.\n\nTorsten Thiele MPA writes, “After returning to Harvard for a wonderful year as 2014 Advanced Leadership Fellow, I am back in London, promoting ocean governance through a not-for-profit, the Global Ocean Trust.\n\n1988\n\n//////////\n\nMichael Becker MC/MPA writes, “Just to say hello. Life is good.”\n\nBob Levy MC/MPA recently received his credentials from the International Public Management Association as a certified professional in human resources. “Still (26 years) town manager of Pembroke Park, Florida, and an elected city council member (12 years) of Plantation, Florida.”\n\nAlan Loeb MC/MPA presented “Rocket 88: The Music and the Machine” at the Business History Conference in June. The paper shows how General Motors helped introduce rock and roll, and how that ultimately led to the Clean Air Act of 1970. “(True story!)”\n\n1989\n\n//////////\n\nJames Brett MC/MPA has been reappointed by President Obama to the President’s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. He also was appointed chairman of the Governor’s Commission on Intellectual Disability by Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker.\n\nShari Davis MPP is now serving as codirector of the Santa Monica College Public Policy Institute, a unique California community college–based program giving diverse students pathways to associate’s degrees and certificates in public policy, while providing community forums on a variety of issues.\n\nRussell Hawkins MC/MPA recently returned from a business trip to Korea. “I’ve completed my 10th year with the Korea Trade and Investment Promotion Agency and 20th year in South Africa. Seems like only yesterday. Other activities include Harvard Alumni Association SA and Young African Leadership Institute. Life’s good.”\n\nJunki Kim MPP was recently appointed as director of Korea’s National Assembly Budget Office, an equivalent of the Congressional Budget Office in the U.S. He was dean of the Graduate School of Public Administration, Seoul National University prior to his appointment.\n\nJanice Saragoni MC/MPA writes, “Still toiling away at Saragoni & Company, the Boston-based public affairs and media relations firm I launched in 1997. I’ve been living in Cambridge since 1990 but am moving “across the river” to North Allston in early winter. Have been spending as much time as possible in Greece, where I have a little cottage on the island of Hydra. Would love to hear from classmates near and far.”\n\n1990\n\n//////////\n\nMark Francis MPP, over the past four years, has been leading teams at Intel to reimagine personal computing and develop breakthrough experiences enabled by technology. As a result of these efforts, Mark was recently awarded a patent by the U.S. Patent Office. He and his team at Intel have pushed innovation in the design, usability, product definition, and core technologies for the wearable computing and “internet of things” markets. The first released product resulting from these efforts is the MICA bracelet, introduced at Fashion Week — New York, codesigned by Opening Ceremonies, and sold through Barney’s New York.\n\nMark Levin HKSEE has retired as city administrator of Maryland Heights, Missouri, a position he had held since the city incorporated in 1985. Mark is now a clinical associate professor in the School of Public & Environmental Affairs at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he is teaching graduate courses in urban management and government budgeting.\n\nJay Madigan MC/MPA writes, “My wife, Marta, and I are living and working in Orlando, Florida.

Prugh Lecture in Military Legal History at the Army Judge Advocate General’s School in Charlottesville, VA. I spoke on the history of appellate review of courts-martial in the United States. I am a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in Washington, DC.”\n\nJeff Thinnes MC/MPA writes, “Was great seeing so many old (in both ways) friends at the reunion in May. Wow, 25 flew by fast. Reminded me what a unique and special place HKS is. Traveling to 12 countries in next few months for anti-corruption training. Had some fun with the FIFA issue and role of corporate sponsors.”\n\n1991 / 25th Reunion\n\n//////////\n\nFabiana Feld MPA, chief investment officer with International Finance Corporation, is managing relationships with multinationals such as Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Unilever to develop solutions in the food supply space and finance resilient supple chains in emerging nations and fragile states.\n\nMike Scott MC/MPA attended the 2015 Harvard commencement for daughter Tiffany, who received her undergraduate degree. “This is the first formal event attended since leaving K-School. Saw renovation under way at school and thought about the 25th reunion this year. I’m looking forward to working on the planning committee for reunion.”\n\nWill Shafroth MC/MPA is the president and CEO of the National Park Foundation, the official charity of the National Park Service. After four-and-a-half years working for the secretary of the interior, he leads a campaign to mark the 100th anniversary of the world’s leading national park system in 2016.\n\nDiane Stollenwerk MPP leads the team at StollenWerks Inc., a strategic consulting firm focused on health policy. Based in Baltimore, her company works with national agencies and organizations in DC and with state and private sector groups across the country. She spends time with her wife, Delegate Maggie McIntosh, at their homes in Maryland and on the Delaware coast, one of which is an historic church built in 1882 that they restored and transformed into a lovely home. Together they enjoy longtime friends, adventurous travel, and projects that make the world a better place.\n\n1992\n\n//////////\n\nJoyce Anagnos MPP has been a senior attorney with the city of Toledo, Ohio, since 2006, handling both transactional and litigation responsibilities regarding local government and utility matters.

Joyce is also an elected member of the Lucas County Bar Association’s executive committee.\n\nJuan Garcia MPP writes, “It’s been a privilege to serve in the Obama administration for 6.5 years, and an honor to help lead the magnificent Navy/Marine Corps team as the assistant secretary of the Navy. But in June I left DC to take a position at Amazon HQ in Seattle. Will commute back and forth while Denise stays with the kids until the twins finish high school. Amazon’s work culture is a little different from the Pentagon: jeans & T-shirts, dogs in the office, and first names, but whip-smart people and cool, challenging work.”\n\nTaegan Goddard MPP and classmate Chris Riback MPP run Good Guys Media Ventures, which helps companies and nonprofits create branded digital media properties — connecting actionable ideas and insights with key audiences to increase client engagement and remain top of mind in highly competitive landscapes.

Industries include private equity, health care, energy, education, defense, and more.\n\nFirdaus Kharas HKSEE was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, “in recognition of his innovative contributions to the advancement of public health and children’s rights in a global context.”\n\nChris Riback MPP and classmate Taegan Goddard MPP run Good Guys Media Ventures, which helps companies and nonprofits create branded digital media properties — connecting actionable ideas and insights with key audiences to increase client engagement and remain top of mind in highly competitive landscapes.

Finally, I decided to retire from the European Commission in July 2014. However, I continue to travel and give advice to NGOs and local authorities in El Salvador and the Dominican Republic.”\n\n1995\n\n//////////\n\nMichael Feiner MC/MPA writes, “Currently at the end of my term as German ambassador to Niger (if in doubt as to the exact location, please check a map). About to be reposted, at time of going to press no reliable information as to when and where, though.”\n\nLorene Flaming MPP writes, “Since February 2015, I’ve been working in Nepal on a food security project with Winrock International.
