David was a local realtor and was known as the “Hawaiian Shirt Guy”. He graduated from Wilson High School in 1957 and was a member of the Outcast Car Club and Scarabs Fraternity. In 1959, he enlisted in the US Air Force. During his service, he was a part of the evaluation team that oversaw calibrations facilities for the Air Force. During his military career, he traveled throughout Europe, the Middle East and Far East. During this time he earned a BS degree at the University of Maryland and was awarded a Meritorious Service Award. After his retirement from the service in 1979, he began his career with Rockwell International where he supervised the calibrations laboratory. Before his retirement in 1989 from Rockwell, he considered his greatest accomplishment, his participation in the Star Wars Satellite Defense System. He then pursued a career in real estate with El Dorado Realty in Long Beach. He soon opened his own consulting business specializing in assisting companies to become ISO certified. David is survived by wife, Vicki; daughter, Dara Perez (Raymond); son, Michael (Kameron); grandchildren, Ted dy and Kaylin; and sister, Linda Strong. Graveside services will be on Monday, April 11, 2005 at 1:30 pm at Riverside National Cemetery, Staging Area 3. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his name to the American Cancer Society."
