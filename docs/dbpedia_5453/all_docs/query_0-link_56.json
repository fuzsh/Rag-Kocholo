There is only a plan, and a whole lot of learning, followed by a new and better plan.” Juliette helps us understand the “adaptive recovery” of this global pandemic and reminds us regularly that our “now normal” will be a new, different one.\n\nFil Menczer is a distinguished professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University, Bloomington, and Director of the Observatory on Social Media.
