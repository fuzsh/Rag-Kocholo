        "text": "05-05-2021\n\nFrom ABTonne:\n\nMy story at Parks AFB began in 1952 when my dad, Captain Alvin B. Tonne, was relieved of flight duties at Davis Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona (at his request because of recurrent nightmares reliving two crashes he had survived, bailing out of B-50s over the mountains of Arizona and in the water off of Goose Bay, Labrador) and assigned duties as Provost Marshal and later (when he was promoted to Major) Squadron Commander of a basic training squadron at Parks. I was 5 years old at the time and worshipped my father. I am the first born of we four siblings. A sister and brother (Cynthia and John) joined our family in Arizona and my baby sister (Judy) was born at the hospital/clinic at Parks AFB in August of 1956.\n\nMy earliest memories of Parks revolve around Saturday excursions to the base with my dad in the Jeep he had been issued to help carry out his duties as Provost. Saturday was the day he would finalize paperwork from the previous week or just check on any Friday night mayhem that may have taken place in his absence. We lived in Hayward which is about 11 miles from the base. I loved that old Jeep, partially because I felt like I was in the military when I rode in it, but mainly because on the days when my dad would come home in the Jeep he always made sure to leave a small box (the two piece size) of Chiclets gum under the seat for me to discover. As Squadron Commander, on occasion he would inspect the troops on a Saturday morning and he would take me along so I could watch the inspection. He was strict, but never unfair in his inspection review. I think at that young age I was already forming a decision of what my avocation would be. I enlisted in the Air Force in 1968 and spent the next 22 years serving our country, retiring as a MSgt in 1990. But, I digress.\n\nAnother activity that was especially memorable and fun for my sister and me was the auction that my parents enjoyed attending in the area. Cant remember where exactly it was located, but I do remember a huge red barn where the auction was conducted. My parents let us kids play with other children whose parents were at the auction and we had a blast playing all the games so popular with kids back then; tag, hide and seek, etc... I recall also motorcycle hill climbs that took place, somewhere near the base, off the road that came from Hayward to the base. It seemed impossible to me that anyone could climb the side of a dirt hill, that was at least 100 feet high and straight up, on a motorcycle without killing themselves. Actually the hill was probably only about 30 feet high at probably a 45 degree angle. Still, it was exciting to see the riders attempt the climb and sometimes succeed, as we drove by.\n\nI have many more memories of our life in Hayward that were all a direct result of dads being stationed at Parks AFB; endless afternoons playing street ball with the kids on our street; numerous trips over the Oakland Bay Bridge, through Oakland to San Francisco where we were treated to lunch at #9 Fishermans Wharf; attending the East West Shrine Bowl game (just dad and me); attending the 10th Anniversary meeting of the United Nations Assembly in San Francisco, June 1955; seeing the Grand National Rodeo with my dad at the Cow Palace in San Francisco 1955 with head liner Rex Allen and his talented horse Koko. Then there was the infamous incident in early 1956 on a Wednesday evening at First Baptist Church in Hayward. The church was having new sewer lines installed and the ditch was at the front edge of the parking lot next to the building. I was teasing my sister, Cindy, which caused her to try to retaliate against me. She was chasing me and I tried to jump over the dirt pile along the edge of the sewer line ditch. I misjudged the height of the dirt pile, tripped and fell head first on the sharp edge of the front bumper of one of the cars. My forehead had a one inch gash and I was bleeding profusely. I ran into the church trying to locate my mother who scooped me up, yelled for my dad and hurried to our 1954 two tone blue and white Dodge station wagon. Fifteen minutes later I was in the emergency room of the Parks AFB clinic where it was determined I would survive and two butterfly bandaids were applied to my gashed forehead. I remember being so relieved I did not have to get stitches. My last memory of Parks AFB was the series of vaccinations we had to receive before we rotated to dads next assignment as Personnel officer for the 18th Tac Fighter Wing at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa in the fall of 1956. I was 9 years old when we made that move. The nurse giving us our shots was a WWII veteran who served in the overseas theater for a period of time during the war, which meant she was an old Army nurse who had been in the service for awhile. She had a memorable technique for giving shots to dependent children. Now, remember those were the days when syringe needles were sterilized and used over and over again. Knowing full well that any given needle might not be as sharp as it once was, she had me look away from her. Then she hit me in the arm with her fist and almost simultaneously gave the injection. Never felt the shots.\n\nI am sure other memories of my time associated with dads tour at Parks AFB are hiding somewhere deep in the recesses of my soon to be 75 year old mind. If they should come forth, I will gladly share those with you too. Have a blessed day.\n\n12-22-2020\n\nFrom Traci Kjelshus:\n\nHello, I have been looking for pictures of my father. I know your email is for stories from people who were at Parks, but I was hoping you might be able to help me. My father has passed away and I am looking for any military picture I can find of him. (I have none). He was part of the Air Police Course from July 1956 to November 1956. I don't know what flight or anything he was a part of. His name was Alvin Challstrom. If you can't help that is fine, I am just trying any possible source to see if there is a class picture out there with him in it.\n\nThank you\n\nTraci Kjelshus\n\n12-21-2020\n\nA message from James Hill:\n\nI arrived Nov.1954 the last class for the year was underway.so I had to wait till after the year for a new class.so I just hung around the training area and watched the class that was underway.I got to know the instructors .I spent a lot of time ate the USO in Hayward an was invited to have Christmas dinnner with a family i CastroVallley needless to say I have fond memories of my stay in CA. a se note I went to France from Parks\n\n06-25-2019\n\nFrom Hugh D. Frye\n\nIn 1956 I attended the Air Base Defense course. I also practiced with Parks AF B rifle drill team (Screaming Eagles). On St Patrick's Day, 1956, we marched the parade from the wharf to City Hall bare bayonets, In forgetable.\n\nHugh D. Frye.\n\nMSgt retired\n\n06-07-2018\n\nFrom Leonard Granger:\n\nWhen the Army drafted me in 1952 I went to DesMoines Iowa to take the physical and all. Came home and told my parents I was going to join the Air Force. Mom said you are in Army and they will call you up in a week. I said i am going to pray all the way to the the Air Force recruiters office I took my college degree and spoke a few minutes to the Air Force man and he said just how soon do you want to go in the Air force. I said right away, so I went with a group by train to Parks AFB just two days later. While going through Basic Training in about the 3 rd week, I was called to the Commanders office. He said, How did you get in the Air Force as the Army says they want you to report to Ft Ord here in California ASAP I told them I enlisted in Iowa and the recruiter never asked about the Army so I said nothing. Commander asked do you still want to stay in AF? I said yes so he and 1stSgt went into a room and talked. When they returned commander said if you want to stay AF tear a corner of this TWX, so I did, then 1stSgt tore off another and then the commander waded the TWX up and tossed in the trash can. Said go back to the training group.. YOU ARE AIR FORCE. AND I STAYED AF FOR 22 YEARS, retired as M/SGT.\n\nWhen I was going through basic training 1952 at Parks AFB, CA we had a gathering in a large hanger building and the Base Commander spoke to all of us about the importance of our training. As he spoke a pigeon from up in the top pf the hanger building flew down and drop his poop on the hat of the commander, Do one laughed and commander did not notice what had happened. as he had more decorations on his hat. Later the Air Police removed all the pigeons out of the hanger areas .\n\nAfter finishing Basic Training I was made permanent party. I had just got married and the next month was assigned the Supply Sgt in you will not believe???? YES====, the WAF Squadron and only man assigned that squadron. When M/Sgt Spernyak, the Base Commanders inspection Team Leader, visited the WAF he was surprised to see me. assigned there. He returned and rescued me to the Base Finance Office where I worked till re=enlistment. I was accepted for the Air Force Band as Base Drummer, and a Command Inspection Team But reenlisted to fill a AF space in Greece assigned to the US Embassy and Airport. Got to greet many as they arrived in Greece. Recall greeting Gomer Pyle and asked him if he had any breakfast. He said no , so I took him to breakfast. I also greeted Marylin Mansfield with hug. and the tour of duty will always be remembered. However, my wife came down with POLIO and was sent to Germany for treatments for over 4 months, I would catch a AF passenger flight every other week to visit her. On my last flight they said no AF this week so have to take a Navy plane to Naples, Italy and refuel and on to Germany. At Naples I was bumped off the flight by someone with a higher priority. That plane took off a C-47 and crashed killing everyone and I at the time with a wife and 2 children.\n\n02-14-2017\n\nFrom DeWayne Bremer\n\nPortland OR\n\nWe were Oregon boys fresh out of High School Myself, Doug Watkins, and Darth Miller.
