        "text": "Did you get \"Mooned\" in Dayton?\n\nTag your eclipse photos with #DaytonEclipse, and we might feature them on our social media!\n\nBe sure to also check out our photo gallery.\n\nDayton, Ohio was in the path of totality for the 2024 Great North American Eclipse, on Monday, April 8, experiencing 2 minutes and 43 seconds of total darkness, beginning at 3:09 p.m.\n\nWhen the moon passes directly in front of the sun, creating a total solar eclipse, it is a truly awe-inspiring sight! The sky darkens, stars and planets become visible, and the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, is revealed. This rare celestial rendezvous will leave you speechless.\n\nThe Great North American Eclipse will be a celestial spectacle stretching from Mexico to Canada, and passing through 14 states in the U.S. While most of the country will experience some degree of darkness, the path of totality (the time that the sun is entirely blocked by the moon) will cross multiple states, beginning in southern Texas and arching across Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New York, and Vermont (along with portions of neighboring states).\n\nMake Your Eclipse Plans\n\nUSA TODAY named Dayton one of the 12 best places in the country to see the eclipse! Conveniently located just minutes south of the Interstate 70/Interstate 75 interchange, Dayton is easily accessible from many parts of the country.\n\nWhere to See the Eclipse in Dayton\n\nThe Dayton Convention & Visitors Bureau is planning for a variety of events and activities surrounding the eclipse, and the grounds of the free National Museum of the U.S. Air Force™ will serve as a primary viewing location for the eclipse in the Dayton area! The museum offers ample free parking and viewing space, as well as access to the museum’s world-renowned collection, featuring 19 indoor acres of exhibits and more than 360 aerospace vehicles!
