        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the William J. Clinton Presidential History Project and we’re very happy that you consented to spend some time today with us going over your recollections of the administration. The first thing I need to do is an administrative matter and that is to get everybody to say a couple of words into the microphone, partly to test the level but more to identify to the transcriptionist who the voices are. I’m Russell Riley, a research professor at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. My primary responsibility is with the Presidential Oral History Program.\n\nGilmour\n\nI’m John Gilmour from the College of William and Mary.\n\nPolsby\n\nI’m Nelson Polsby from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPanetta\n\nAnd I’m Leon Panetta, subject of the interview and Director of the Panetta Institute here at California State University, Monterey Bay.\n\nRiley\n\nGreat. There are a couple of things I want to say on the record before we begin with the first question. One is to note for anybody who may be using this transcript in the future that you already have two very valuable interviews on the record that we’ve included in the briefing book. One was conducted by PBS Frontline, which reviewed a good part of the administration and dealt with some of the questions we would typically deal with. The other is an interview done by the Institute of International Studies at Berkeley that dealt more with your own personal history and I would encourage—\n\nGilmour\n\nHarry Kreisler, you remember that?\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGilmour\n\nHe did one of me too, it was fun.\n\nPanetta\n\nI think I was up speaking at the law school and we did the morning interview.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, those are both very valuable additions to the public record, so anybody who is using this particular transcript would probably want to cross reference those to pick up some things we might not be dealing with here.\n\nThe other thing I want to say is sort of on a personal note. For those of us who live in Charlottesville, we’re fond of saying that if you want to understand the mind of Mr. [Thomas] Jefferson, you really have to come to Charlottesville and look at Monticello and the University of Virginia. I think it is true for anybody in the future who wants to understand Leon Panetta that it would be a very valuable experience to come to Monterey. I think it helps make a lot of sense of various aspects of your public career.\n\nI came in after dark on Wednesday night and was reading parts of the briefing book, one passage of which indicated that virtually every weekend when you were in the House of Representatives, you flew back to your home here. I put an exclamation mark by that. I found that incredible until the sun came up the next morning and I had a chance to get out and walk around a little bit and see what it is that would draw somebody back. So I think it would be a valuable field trip for any scholar in the future who wants to know something more.\n\nPanetta\n\nI think that’s true. I’ve often said that when you’re from this area, the beauty and diversity of this area—It was important for me to come back as often as I did because it not only got me out of the beltway, which I think is important for anybody involved in public life, just to be able to be in touch with the rest of the country, but it also refreshed my compass to be able to go back. My wife and I decided early on—when I was elected in ’76 there were not that many members of Congress from California who were doing it on a regular basis. I think most of the time they were doing it maybe once every couple of months or three months. Somebody like [Bernice] Bernie Sisk from the Valley would probably do it once or twice a year. When the ’74 and ’76 classes came into the Congress, one of the things that began was a more regular commute back to the districts. Norm Mineta was one of those, John Krebs from the Valley was another one. We began the whole process of commuting back to our districts.\n\nFamily was out here. My wife ran my offices in the district. The other aspect was that this was really my home. This was where I was born and raised and Washington was where I worked, and I never wanted to confuse the two. It worked for us. I think it worked very well. It was a long commute, but on the other hand I really looked forward to it. I missed it. When I became Director of OMB [Office of Management and Budget] and then Chief of Staff I missed being able to come back to California.\n\nWhen I was offered the job as Chief of Staff, I said that I would take the President through the reelection but then I wanted to come back to California, and we did that. I think we moved back to California within a few days after the inauguration for the second term. I’ve often said that I can be accused of an awful lot in politics, but one thing I can’t be accused of is having a bad sense of timing, when to get the hell out of Washington.\n\nRiley\n\nWe’ll definitely want to come back to that. John, you want to start us?\n\nGilmour\n\nWe wanted to ask you some questions about your early political career. We can begin by asking how it was you came to be a Republican.\n\nPanetta\n\nWell, that really relates to the tradition in California. I was, as I said, born and raised in Monterey. My parents were immigrants from Italy. They weren’t politically involved in any way. They were Democrats but, like a lot of immigrants, as time went by they became more conservative in their thinking and generally tended to vote Republican even though they were registered as Democrats.\n\nI was raised in a progressive Republicanism that used to be the case in California. It began with Hiram Johnson. It was a tradition that was carried on by people like Earl Warren and Tom Kuchel, whom I worked for, and Goodwin Knight and others. Because of cross filing, because of the traditions of California.\n\nSo when I grew up, I had a great deal of respect for people like Earl Warren and Tom Kuchel. As a result it seemed to fit what I believed in to become what was then a progressive, or moderate, Republican. When I went to work with Tom Kuchel in Washington that confirmed my views, because he was someone who believed in civil rights, believed in labor issues, was very liberal in terms of social issues but conservative with regard to fiscal issues, and that was where I was too, so it fit pretty well.\n\nThen Tom Kuchel lost to Max Rafferty in the primary in ’68, to a right-wing Republican in California. I guess as a result of getting rid of cross filing, the party began to move more and more to the extreme and, particularly after my experience at the Office for Civil Rights, I decided that there was a bigger roof in the Democratic Party. The Republicans were beginning to exclude the Tom Kuchels and Jacob Javits and Clifford Cases of the world, who represented what I thought Republicanism ought to represent.\n\nGilmour\n\nCan you explain how you joined the [Richard M.] Nixon administration?\n\nPanetta\n\nYes. After I got out of the Army, I had the chance to go back and work for Senator Kuchel as a legislative assistant. It was not because I’d been very involved in party politics. I had gone through undergrad and law school and then was serving two years in the Army so I was coming out—My parents certainly were not in any way involved in politics. I had written to Washington and had a chance to go back. I actually wrote a guy named Joe Califano, and the reason I wrote him is not because I knew him but because he was Italian and so was I, so I thought he probably could be helpful. He set up some interviews for me back in Washington, when I was still in the Army. So I went back and I interviewed—\n\nGilmour\n\nWhere was Califano at that point?\n\nPanetta\n\nCalifano was in the White House. He was an assistant to Lyndon Johnson.\n\nPolsby\n\nWorking for Johnson—\n\nPanetta\n\nHe set up a set of interviews for me in Washington. To his credit. I sent him my résumé, but he really didn’t have to do it. But he actually called and set up some interviews. So I went back, interviewed at Justice, interviewed at Defense, interviewed at a number of departments and then took the time to go up to Capitol Hill because I was interested in Capitol Hill. I walked into Kuchel’s office because I had a lot of respect for him as Senator, and they were in the process of looking for a legislative assistant. I got the job, I think in part because I was an attorney but also because of my military background. I think Tom Kuchel had a lot of respect for that.\n\nSo I was able to get the job and my wife and I drove back to Washington in a Volkswagen with two kids in diapers. I began work for him as a legislative assistant, and worked from him from April of ’66 and through the ’68 election when he lost the primary. We had to move on.\n\nI was offered several jobs on Capitol Hill. Ed Brooke had offered me a job to work for him, and some others had offered a job. Then what happened is that Jack Veneman, who was an assemblyman here in California and of the same stripe of Republicanism that I was and Tom Kuchel was, a moderate Republican—That actually was the case in the state legislature for a long time. There were a lot of real good guys who were involved in California politics at that level who were also friends of Kuchel. Jack Veneman was asked to come back by Bob Finch to help organize his work at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). Jack Veneman knew that I had worked on those issues when I was with Kuchel, so he asked me to come down and help him organize the approach and the briefings for Bob Finch. I did that, and then was asked to join the Secretary as a special, I think Assistant to the Secretary was the first job I had at the old Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\n\nThen, within a few months, I had to concentrate on civil rights because that was such a controversial issue, and because of my background—I’d worked on civil rights legislation for Tom Kuchel—within a matter of a few months I was asked to become Director of the Office of Civil Rights at HEW.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were asked by?\n\nPanetta\n\nI was asked by Bob Finch.\n\nPolsby\n\nWho didn’t last very long, as I recall.\n\nPanetta\n\nThat’s correct. He had a rough time while he was there trying to fight—largely to protect the issues that I talked about on the Republican side. He was for civil rights enforcement. He was for a lot of the progressive issues that Health, Education and Welfare was all about, and he ran into problems with a lot of the conservative aides that the President had in the White House, as I did as Director of the Office for Civil Rights.\n\nGilmour\n\nWas there any precipitating event while you were in the Nixon administration that prompted you to become a Democrat?\n\nPanetta\n\nIt was really a series of things that happened. It began, I think, with Max Rafferty’s defeat of Tom Kuchel. You could clearly see that the Republican Party was moving further to the right.\n\nRiley\n\nDid the [Ronald] Reagan election before that—is that a part of that same swing that you’re identifying or not? He was elected Governor in ’66.\n\nPanetta\n\nTom Kuchel had basically taken a position where he did not support Ronald Reagan when he was running. He supported [Edmund] Pat Brown because he had to—Again, this is a reflection of the kind of politics that I’m talking about. He had much more in common with a Pat Brown in terms of what Pat was trying to do for the state, and so supported Pat Brown in that election. That was part of Kuchel’s problem obviously, when he ran, particularly on the Republican side. But I think there was a change beginning to take place in California in terms of Republican politics that’s still there, it’s still happening, that moved the party further and further to the right. People like Kuchel just couldn’t get past the primary. They could win in November. Tom Kuchel would have won in November had he gotten past the primary. It’s obvious, because [Alan] Cranston beat Max Rafferty, and I think there was no question Cranston did not believe he had a chance if Kuchel won the primary.\n\nSo I could see the beginnings of that then. Just to round out the picture, in the United States Senate, when I went back as a legislative assistant to Tom Kuchel, it was not only Tom Kuchel, it was Jacob Javits, it was Clifford Case, it was George Aiken, it was Hugh Scott, it was Mark Hatfield, it was Ed Brooke. It was a large group of what I would call moderate progressive Republicans who were part of the United States Senate. And it was a comfortable place to be because they not only represented what I thought was the right philosophy in terms of the country, but they could implement it. They were working with Democrats to basically implement policy and they worked together, whether it was on the environment or education or civil rights. Even Everett Dirksen, who was much more conservative, worked with Lyndon Johnson to pass civil rights legislation.\n\nSo that was the tradition, that’s where I was coming from. Gradually that began to erode over the years. Even when Nixon came in and Spiro Agnew was Vice President, Spiro Agnew actually campaigned against a guy named Charlie Goodell in New York who was a moderate Republican.\n\nPolsby\n\nElected Jim Buckley, wasn’t it?\n\nPanetta\n\nAnd elected Jim Buckley as a result of that. So that, plus I could see what was happening with civil rights, that a commitment had been made on the southern strategy.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you tell us, I don’t want to get into too much on this, but I’m interested because there is some revisionism out there—\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, there is. I saw the George Shultz piece in the New York Times was a piece of revisionist history.\n\nRiley\n\nI’d like to get you on the record on this about your own—\n\nPanetta\n\nIt was obvious from people I talked to both in the White House and outside the White House that a deal had been made in the election in ’68 that—It was the southern strategy essentially that, in exchange for the support of the South in the nomination race against [Nelson] Rockefeller, the South would unify in support of Richard Nixon. But they would do it on the basis that he would back off of strong desegregation efforts in the South. He wouldn’t push efforts at busing and the controversial issues that had begun ever since Brown v. Board of Education passed the Supreme Court but, more importantly, were implemented during the Johnson years, particularly with the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which began to put money into districts. Basically what the Office of Civil Rights could do, as a result of the Civil Rights Act, Title IX, was to say to a district, if you don’t get rid of the dual school system, if you don’t break it down, you’ll lose your federal money. Prior to the passage of ESEA there were no teeth in the law. With the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the amount of federal money that went into districts around the country, you began to get teeth in the law.\n\nSo the leverage I had as Director of the Office for Civil Rights was essentially to say to a district, Because you’ve been a segregated school district, you’ve got to desegregate and you’ve got to present a desegregation plan. We could easily make the case, because for close to 200 years most of those districts had been segregated by law. So you could make the case. If they presented a good desegregation plan, they maintained their federal dollars. If they didn’t, we would sometimes take action to cut off those dollars.\n\nI remember I told Bob Finch when he became Secretary and then when he asked me to become Director of the Office for Civil Rights that I had helped pass many of the laws on Capitol Hill, working with Tom Kuchel on civil rights, and that I was committed to enforcing the law. He indicated that he was equally committed to enforcing those laws, we were not going to go backwards, that we were not going to retreat from the commitment to implement equal rights in education.\n\nBut it was obvious, as time went on, as we began to take enforcement efforts, that there were still some very tough districts to deal with. And there were still some hard districts, particularly in states like Mississippi, Georgia. Pressure began to come in politically, through the White House, to essentially slow down and back off.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were getting calls from—\n\nPanetta\n\nOh, yes, I got calls from John Ehrlichman, got calls from the fellow who handled their congressional affairs, the little guy from—I’ll think of his name, I can’t remember it right now. But from him, the calls were coming sometimes through the Secretary’s office, to try to slow down, back off, give them more time. And there was a group of districts that essentially we said, We’ve got to proceed. They were moving in the right direction actually, because, I think, many in the South had recognized that they had reached the point where they couldn’t dodge it anymore, they had to move forward. There were a lot of school superintendents who basically put their heads on the line. We lost a lot of school superintendents in those days who lost their jobs because of what they were doing. But because of the courts and because of the enforcement at the Office for Civil Rights, there was a sense that they had to move in that direction.\n\nSuddenly, the politicians in those states were beginning to put pressure on the White House, and the White House was beginning to send signals that they didn’t have to move. A lot of these cases went into the courts because they were refusing—And the courts in those days, all the way up to the Supreme Court, were still very strong about ensuring that the law would be enforced. The courts then drew the line.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there was a large Supreme Court decision in Mississippi, on a group of states, that made very clear they would not back off on desegregation. I thought when the Court made the decision that was very helpful. My position was that we shouldn’t back off, we should keep the pressure on, especially at this point in time when we’ve had so many who have finally come to recognize that they had to move forward. So what I heard out of the White House was that they were very angry at the Court for having ruled that way. Somebody had basically suggested at a White House meeting—I wasn’t there, but I’d gotten a report from somebody who was there who said there were some arguments not to abide by the Supreme Court’s decision, which I thought was outrageous, but ultimately I think they rejected that advice and knew that they had to go with the decision.\n\nBased on that I continued to try to push forward. It was in Washington that a fellow from Mississippi brought in a group of politicians who said to me, No, the President made a commitment to us that he would not push on desegregation. I said, Look, the President also is sworn to uphold the law and this is the law. And yes, I was enough of a politician to understand. I said, Look, I’m willing to sit down, I’m willing to negotiate, I’m willing to work it through, but I’m not willing to back off of the ultimate commitment that has to be done here. But there are ways to do this. Anytime you have to desegregate, I understand, you try to do it in a way that at least doesn’t create an explosion within these areas. I recognize the importance of doing that.\n\nPolsby\n\nWhen did you decide you’d basically lost and gave up on him? I guess because there was a transition, you went to work for John Lindsay.\n\nPanetta\n\nI could recognize each day, as I was getting more and more pressure, that I was coming to a point where I had to make an internal decision. Either I was going to continue to enforce the law, based on what I believed was right, or I was going to capitulate and back off. I was Director of the Office for Civil Rights. I probably could have gotten other positions in the administration as a result of that. I was pretty young, I think I was in my late 20s, early 30s at the time I was Director of the Office for Civil Rights.\n\nI just made the fundamental decision that I had to do what I believed was right. I can’t say that there was any bolt of lightning out of the sky. I had been recognized as somebody who was trying to push this forward and do the right thing, and I felt it was important to continue that effort. I also believed it was in the political interests of the administration to get this behind him, as opposed to making it something that could undermine their credibility when they’re trying to deal with other issues.\n\nSo I believed not only was it good in the sense of upholding the law, but it was good politically. Then there was increasing pressure on the administration to move me out, particularly from Strom Thurmond’s office and some of the people associated with Thurmond in South Carolina. I had heard that Jack Veneman and Bob Finch had said to the White House, You’ll get our resignations if you try to force Panetta out or fire him.\n\nThere began a period where I began to get more and more of the rumors that there was pressure for me to leave. Then one day there was a report in the Washington Post that indicated I had resigned from my position. I went into the office and everybody was asking about it. I called the Secretary, Bob Finch, and said, There’s a report and there have been other reports and I assume we’ll deny it. And he said, Yes, deny it as you have. So we did. But later that morning in the President’s press briefing with the—who was the guy who was his press secretary?\n\nGilmour\n\nRon Ziegler?\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, Ziegler did a press briefing, and at the briefing he confirmed that I had resigned.\n\nGilmour\n\nOh, my.\n\nPolsby\n\nThat’s how they communicate in Washington.\n\nPanetta\n\nSo I immediately went over to the Secretary’s office and Bob Finch said, Yes, look, they’ve confirmed that you’ve resigned. I know it’s tough. I said, I’m not going to put you in a spot, you’ve supported me. I’ll go ahead and submit my resignation. Which I did.\n\nPolsby\n\nBack dated.\n\nPanetta\n\nBack dated before the press conference. Essentially I was fired from that job. Then I took a few months to work on a book that we did on our experience, Peter Gall and I. Peter Gall had worked with me in Kuchel’s office and worked at the Office for Civil Rights. We wrote the book and then got the offer from John Lindsay’s office, because there was somebody in Lindsay’s office who had worked with Jacob Javits and knew me from Capitol Hill, a guy named Dick Aurelio, who was a deputy mayor to John Lindsay. He asked if I would come to work for Lindsay.\n\nAs I began to work with Lindsay—and as you know Lindsay ultimately made the same decision I did, to become a Democrat—I saw that those who were supporting me on the civil rights battle, and there were a lot of good members in the House who had fought for these laws, were getting hit as well from the administration. So the support I had received was beginning to evaporate on the Republican side. It was a combination of all of that, but in particular when Agnew campaigned against Goodell, that offended me more than anything else.\n\nPolsby\n\nSo you were never in elective politics out here, as a Republican.\n\nPanetta\n\nThat’s correct.\n\nPolsby\n\nBecause it simply occurred to me that the people who have the toughest time changing parties are the people who have local ties with one party, and you didn’t have that problem.\n\nPanetta\n\nThat’s right. Actually, when I ran for Congress I had the best of both worlds, because I’d worked for Tom Kuchel, who was pretty well respected. This district here, the central coast, was essentially a moderate area. There are extremes from Santa Cruz down to Paso Robles, that was the district I represented at the time. But generally I think it continued to be much more in line with the politics I was raised with. So it actually became a very good fit, not only because I was born and raised in this area, but the fact that I had worked for Kuchel got me a lot of support on the Republican side. And the fact that I was a Democrat obviously appealed to what was becoming a growing number of Democrats in this area. It was a good combination to take into the election in ’76.\n\nRiley\n\nI know you both have questions about the period in the House.\n\nGilmour\n\nYou were a budget expert in the House of Representatives.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes.\n\nGilmour\n\nWere you interested in the budget right from the start or did you develop an interest after you got there?\n\nPanetta\n\nWell, when I was working as a legislative assistant for Kuchel, in those days a U.S. Senator usually had two aides, one covering foreign affairs and defense and one covering domestic issues and financial issues. So in Kuchel’s office there was one fellow who did basically defense and foreign affairs, and I became the legislative assistant for all of the domestic area. Kuchel was on the Appropriations Committee. I became familiar with appropriations and I became familiar with the aspect that ultimately, the power to deal with money is the power to deliver for the people you represent. Not only that, but the debate that takes place usually does so in the context of either the budget or the appropriations process.\n\nI had learned that during the time I was there and continued to have that interest. When I went back to the Congress in ’76, actually went in in ’77, the budget process had just been adopted in the Congress. They had passed the Budget Empowerment Act. It had passed in ’74, I believe, so it was very new and the Budget Committee was very new in implementing that. I became very interested in the budget process for a couple of reasons. Number one, because almost the first thing you had to do in the Congress was pass a budget resolution—\n\nPolsby\n\nDid you go directly to the Budget Committee when you got—\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, I was on the Agriculture Committee—\n\nPolsby\n\nAgriculture, I thought so, yes.\n\nPanetta\n\nMainly because of my district—\n\nPolsby\n\nSure.\n\nPanetta\n\nBecause it was largely agriculture. Then I was in House administration. But I began, in my first two years, to work on budget issues. Bob Giaimo was chairman of the Budget Committee and we developed a close relationship—\n\nPolsby\n\nGreat guy, he’s a friend of mine.\n\nPanetta\n\nWonderful guy. And we developed a very close relationship. I’d first known him when I was Director of the Office for Civil Rights. I introduced legislation to create a two-year budget process. One of the first pieces of legislation I put in was to establish a two-year budget cycle, because I could see the constant battles that were going on just to pass one budget and then, no sooner do you pass one budget than you’re in the battle for the next year. So I really thought we ought to extend this period in some way to make more sense out of it. He actually had hearings on it and gave us a chance to talk about it. It was strongly opposed by the appropriators, but there was a lot of attention on it.\n\nAt the beginning of my second term, I was elected to the Budget Committee. So from that second term I was always involved with the Budget Committee in some capacity. I liked it because the budget gave you the opportunity to look at the entire spectrum of federal responsibility and to set priorities and to make judgments about where funds ought to be placed. What are your priorities, where should you put federal dollars? And also it raised, from the very beginning, the whole aspect of how do you discipline federal spending, all of which appealed to me. Fiscal discipline appealed to the Republican side of me, and I had always had that basic ethic. But how to set priorities appealed to the more moderate progressive side of me that said you’ve got to make investments. And the context for doing that is the budget. Yes, ultimately you fight it out in Appropriations and you fight it out elsewhere, but establishing those larger priorities and what you care about as a party, as an institution in the Congress, that battle takes place in the context of the budget resolution. That’s why I enjoyed it.\n\nGilmour\n\nIn ’81 you were head of the Reconciliation Task Force on the Budget Committee—\n\nPanetta\n\nYes.\n\nGilmour\n\nI interviewed you in 1981 when I was working on my dissertation. You don’t remember it I’m sure, it was in the immediate aftermath of the big reconciliation bill that year.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGilmour\n\nDid you seek that out or did Bob Giaimo ask you to take it on?\n\nPanetta\n\nYes to both of those. What happened with reconciliation is, of course, the enforcement process that was built into the Budget Act said that ultimately, if you really want to force savings, when it comes to entitlements or taxes, there is this process whereby you can, in a reconciliation bill, pass it through both the House and the Senate and adopt those savings into law. Needless to say, the budget process has always been immersed in the politics of the appropriators and the chairmen, who never particularly like the budget process.\n\nDon’t forget that the reason the Budget Act passed was not because they wanted to pass a budget, but because they wanted to control the impoundment process that Richard Nixon was in charge of. This had nothing to do with the budget. They wanted to stop Richard Nixon stopping them from spending money through the impoundment process. But they also understood that they couldn’t just slap the President down, because the President was already starting to accuse the Congress of being big spenders. They knew the only cover they could have to get at the impoundment process was to adopt a congressional budget process. And there were some, like Dick Boland from Missouri, who legitimately felt that was the right thing to do. But in the process, they had to cut deals and ultimately everybody thought, Well, the budget thing will be a nice little game for a few members, but it’s not going to change the way Congress behaves.\n\nSo for the first few years, nobody ever raised the aspect that you would pass a reconciliation act to achieve saving. But Bob Giaimo always said, We ought to at least start a process of trying to urge members to achieve savings, to try to find areas where savings can be achieved, either by getting rid of programs that don’t work or cutting back on programs that were pork projects to begin with. He really believed that, and he then established this Reconciliation Task Force in Budget and asked me to chair it.\n\nI think this must have been my first term on the Budget Committee, so I was just a second-term member of Congress. This was a time when senior members of the Congress still ran the place to a large extent, and Ralph Regula, who was a Republican, was my ranking member on that Reconciliation Task Force. So the basic message we got from Bob was, Do what you can to cajole committee chairmen to try to achieve savings.\n\nI can remember, as Chairman of the Reconciliation Committee, going before Billy Ford, who was a member from Michigan—\n\nPolsby\n\nTough little guy.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, tough little guy, and he was head of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, things that no longer exist. One of the things we focused on is how we could achieve savings in the retirement plans for postal employees, and I urged him to do it. I got guffawed—\n\nRiley\n\nWhy would they do that?\n\nPolsby\n\nLook, one of the things that interests professors is the fact that the House of Representatives is not really appreciated to the extent it might be as a school for members. That is to say, you weren’t born a budget expert—\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, exactly.\n\nPolsby\n\n—but the House gave you the opportunity to specialize, to become a true expert, one of the people in Washington who really knew.\n\nPanetta\n\nOne of the things you learn in the House, more so than the Senate because of the numbers of members, is that your ability to become an expert in an area is power. That’s how you develop a power base in the House, through your expertise in a particular area. Those who try to spread themselves out too far and get into everything are recognized as the demagogues who try to play every issue, but they aren’t experts. And in the House, if you’re willing to learn, if you’re willing to focus on it, you can become a power not only in the House, you can become a power in the Senate when you go into conferences, because Senators don’t take the time to focus as much on a particular area. So it represents power and it’s a place where you can learn. And the member who understands that is the member who gets ahead.\n\nGilmour\n\nAt what point did it occur to you that specializing in reconciliation in the budget process might be a useful career tool?\n\nPanetta\n\nAs I said, we were going through this process of cajoling, and look at the time. In those days, the deficit was a huge $25 billion, which seemed enormous at the time. So [Jimmy] Carter was very concerned about doing what he could to bring that deficit down. Carter actually sat down with the Democrats on Capitol Hill, perhaps the first real budget summit, sat down with the chairmen from Appropriations, Ways and Means, Finance, some key members. Bob Giaimo asked Dick Gephardt and me to sit in and be a member of that summit, and that was really, again—\n\nPolsby\n\nGephardt from Ways and Means presumably.\n\nPanetta\n\nGephardt was over in Ways and Means but he was also on the Budget Committee with me. So we sat in and became a part of that summit. It was totally on the Democratic side, and they ultimately took the first steps to try to develop a balanced budget, to get rid of that $25 billion deficit. At that time it was clear that the ways they had adopted to try to do it were never going to be implemented, but everybody could take credit for trying to do a balanced budget—\n\nGilmour\n\nAnd that was the birth of the reconciliation process.\n\nPanetta\n\nExactly. Well, it was the first time everybody recognized that you needed reconciliation in order to make this work, otherwise nothing would happen. That was the first step. But the point at which reconciliation became recognized for the powerful tool that it is was when Ronald Reagan came in and presented his budget. He wanted to pass this tax cut, but they also knew they had to do some fiscal discipline in the process. They were able to get their budget through. As you recall it was a fiasco in that the Republicans combined with a few Democrats were able to defeat the rule, they were able to pass their budget, the Reagan budget. Then when reconciliation came—and we went through a large reconciliation to implement the Reagan budget—it came to the House side. Democrats had basically tried to develop a reconciliation approach, recognizing that their budget had passed, but we tried to do it in a way that would not have a serious impact on a lot of the programs we cared about.\n\nSo I had refashioned it. We built a Democratic reconciliation bill. We lost the rule on that reconciliation bill. That was significant in terms of the history of the House, because suddenly Tip O’Neill and the Democrats lost control of a major issue. We lost the rule and as a result of that the Republicans had a chance to develop a reconciliation bill. [David] Stockman wrote it out, I remember there were little notes on the side, and everybody was laughing about what was taking place. But I suddenly realized reconciliation gave them the opportunity to go after every aspect of federal spending, entitlements, taxes, changing laws, every aspect, and put it into reconciliation. Suddenly I think every member realized what a huge, powerful tool it was.\n\nNow, that passed. There were a lot of weaknesses that the press and others pointed out. The Senate—that’s where Pete Domenici and I developed our friendship—and Howard Baker was here because the Republicans had won the Senate, worked to modify that. So I, as head of the reconciliation task force, was working to try to modify that. The Senate passed a much more reasonable version of reconciliation, we modified it in conference, and ultimately we got that passed. But it was significant. When that happened, it was recognized that reconciliation was an extremely powerful tool, particularly on the Senate side, recognizing that you could use it to avoid a filibuster on the Senate side. And it was suddenly realized that you could get things done without—\n\nGilmour\n\nAnd nobody had really planned that.\n\nPanetta\n\nNobody, that’s right. Nobody had really looked at it. You can see it even now anytime anybody talks about the tax cut, they’re talking about using reconciliation as the tool to pass it because it avoids the filibuster on the Senate side.\n\nRiley\n\nWho in the Reagan administration was orchestrating this?\n\nPanetta\n\nStockman basically was, he was Director of OMB.\n\nRiley\n\nHe would have been the one who saw the big picture and understood that this was the way it could work?\n\nPanetta\n\nStockman recognized the importance of the budget process, recognized the importance of reconciliation, that it was a positive tool. What Stockman was concerned about, interestingly enough, if we now look at it some 30 years later, was that the tax cut passed as part of that process was going to increase deficits as far as the eye could see. So everything we had done on reconciliation in the budget process to some extent was undermined by what had happened on the tax cut, because while we were trying to control spending on one side, the doors were being opened up by virtue of the tax cut. So that was the one-two that happened.\n\nThe politics wasn’t working with us, but ultimately the deficit became so large that finally even Ronald Reagan recognized he had to do something about it, in ’86, particularly when the stock market crashed. That’s when we had the first real summit between Democrats and Republicans to develop an approach and use the reconciliation tool.\n\nGilmour\n\nIn 1981, first the Republicans won on the budget resolution. That must have put you in an awkward position. And after that you were fighting to get the committees to comply with a reconciliation instruction, it was really a Republican instruction.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes.\n\nGilmour\n\nDid you get a lot of pressure from your colleagues to sabotage it or to let them sabotage it?\n\nPanetta\n\nYes. There were many who really did not want to cooperate with that effort in any way. I remember going to the Education and Labor Committee. In the reconciliation process you have savings that have to be achieved in different areas, and there was a level of savings that had to be achieved out of the Education and Labor Committee. I think there were recommendations in reconciliation as to how it was to be done, but under the budget proposal, the Committee makes the final decision. They have to hit the target on savings, but they can decide how it is done. So my argument to the Education and Labor Committee, and don’t forget, as I said, it was Phil Burton, it was a fellow from Kentucky—\n\nMultiple\n\nCarl Perkins.\n\nPanetta\n\nCarl Perkins. Billy Ford was on there. These were people who were the fathers of many of the programs that had been developed in Education and Labor for 15, 20 years. I remember saying to them, Look, we are obligated under this process to come up with a level of savings. If you don’t do this, and if you don’t exercise some judgment where those savings could be achieved in a way that minimizes the impact on the people you care about, then make no mistake about it, the Committee is going to do it. And the Committee will bring to the floor an amendment that will do this in which you won’t have control, as we saw on reconciliation and as we saw on the budget.\n\nBecause in those days, Phil Gramm and a few others were basically giving the Republicans the votes they needed to get it through. So I said, You’re going to lose it and you really will damage the programs you care about. You have the opportunity to do it. And Carl Perkins said, I don’t want to do any of this, I am not going to do it. If they want to do it, let them dirty their hands. And Phil Burton, a little more practical minded, said, Wait a minute, wait a minute. If we walk away from this, they’ll basically decide this. So I had a lot of those arguments with a lot of chairmen. Again, I approached it on the basis of, This has to be done and it’s going to be done one way or another. You can either play a part in designing it, even though I know it concerns you— because these guys never believe in cutting anything— But if you do that, if you walk away from it, the very programs that you care about are going to get emasculated. That was the argument I used in a lot of the committees.\n\nWays and Means was always much more willing to do it. People like [Dan] Rostenkowski said, This needs to be done. And there were some who believed that we had to do this, and particularly they understood that in dealing with the Senate, they had some Senate chairmen who were sympathetic to those programs. Let’s not forget that in those days the Senate, with people like Howard Baker and Bob Dole and others, was not as extreme as the administration in terms of politics. It was much more moderate. So they realized that if they could work with the Senate and their Senate counterpart, they could probably develop a package that, while they didn’t like cutting any spending, at the very least would minimize the impact. So when they understood that, when they saw that light, I think that’s when we were able to design reconciliation and make some sense out of it. It was still a tough package.\n\nI became kind of the reconciliation expert. Jim Jones was actually Chairman of the Budget Committee, but he basically said, You’ve got to cut this deal. I can remember working with Howard Baker and Bob Dole and others—and Pete Domenici and I developed a close partnership at that time—trying to get it through.\n\nGilmour\n\nThis was when you were a third-term Congressman, I guess.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes. There were moments when I stood back and said, I’m in the middle of developing some pretty significant policy for the country and having a real impact. That basically confirmed in me that the budget was clearly the most powerful tool in the Congress at that point in time. Then, when you looked at Gramm-Rudman, don’t forget we went through the debate on Gramm-Rudman and cutting across the board. We went through the debate on other ways to try to do this. Appropriators began more and more to hate this process because they knew it was limiting their ability to spend money. But it also taught me that in the end, because of the politics, because of the discipline, it gave me a very powerful tool to deal with my colleagues.\n\nPolsby\n\nCan I switch gears just a little bit?\n\nPanetta\n\nSure.\n\nPolsby\n\nYou had an assignment that interested me very much. The House doesn’t get many contested elections. Now, talk a little bit about that. One of the things I’m interested in is how you got handed that dead fish, whether it compromised your capacity to deal with Republicans on other issues. Just talk a little bit about that. That was a very unusual event.\n\nPanetta\n\nWhen I first got into Congress I became a member of the House Administration Committee. And the House Administration Committee had traditionally been this cozy place that determined where parking places were located. Who was the Congressman from Ohio that I think—\n\nPolsby\n\nWayne Hays.\n\nPanetta\n\nHe had converted it into real power because he used it as leverage against individual members who gave him any problem. They’d wind up sitting in front of their office with no office. He used it that way, and then Wayne Hays had his own problems at the time and he got booted out. He was not there when I went to the Committee. The most important thing the House Administration Committee did was set budgets for the individual committees early in the year. That was a significant power, a significant tool to try to influence the different chairmen.\n\nBut it was also engaged in election reform, and when Mo Udall came up with the whole proposal to have public financing for elections, the whole thing that led to the decision in Buckley v. Valeo, we had worked on that legislation in House Administration, and I was on that subcommittee. I enjoyed working on that. I was very interested in election reform.\n\nOne of the jobs of the committee was to deal with close elections. Well, for a long time there weren’t many close elections. Democrats won by big margins and Republicans won by big margins. There weren’t a lot of close elections. I think Ab Mikva had probably some of the closest elections, but even his were maybe 500 to 1,000 votes. But they were getting closer and closer in some of these districts, and this one district in Indiana came in and it was within just a few votes, so it became a contested election.\n\nThe rule is that contested elections are basically handled by a committee that is established in House Administration. So Bill Thomas and I were appointed as chairs to go into this election—\n\nRiley\n\nThis would have been in what year?\n\nPolsby\n\nI’m bad on years.\n\nGilmour\n\nEither the ’84 or ’86 election.\n\nPanetta\n\nThis is in the ’80s, I can’t remember.\n\nGilmour\n\nI would guess probably ’84, but it might have been ’86.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, it was early, Newt Gingrich was arriving in full blossom at that time. Probably one of the things that if you track the change within the institution—\n\nGilmour\n\nWas this [Richard D.] McIntyre versus McIntosh? Were those—\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, it wasn’t McIntosh, it was McIntyre versus the Democrat.\n\nPolsby\n\nWho prevailed.\n\nPanetta\n\nWho prevailed.\n\nPolsby\n\nIt was one of the precipitating things that changed the atmosphere—\n\nPanetta\n\nIt was, if you’re looking at the history.\n\nRiley\n\nExactly.\n\nPanetta\n\nThe bank scandal is probably one of those. Some of the things that happened, the abortion policy, the social policy divisions.\n\nPolsby\n\nThe pay raise.\n\nPanetta\n\nThe pay raise issue, the changes that were beginning to take place in the media, money raising, elections, PACs [political action committees], etc. Put all of that into a test tube and—\n\nPolsby\n\nBut you were in the middle of this particular—\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, this was part of it, and out popped Newt Gingrich. So the Speaker asked me with the chairman to handle this. We had the GAO [General Accounting Office] participate in the actual count. It went pretty well for a while, we developed common rules for how we would count—I watched Florida and chads and all of that, and it actually went back to that process.\n\nWe had to develop rules as to how we would do the recount, what would count, what would not count. We went through that process. Went to Indiana. I suddenly realized Indiana is not this pristine place that abides by all the rules. We found ballots in trashcans, ballots in all kinds of places, depending on what precinct you went to.\n\nSo we had to take all the ballots, they were all paper ballots and we had to count them all, and we went through the process with the GAO. Then we brought it down to the few that were disputed ballots and we had to go through those. As we went through those it came down to about, I think it was a three- or four-count difference. I thought to myself, the last thing that I want is for this thing to come down to three or four votes, hopefully it’s 25 or 30 or 50 votes. And it comes down to four votes.\n\nAt that time Thomas was raising all kinds of objections to it and I said, Look, I’ll ask the guy from GAO. Do you confirm that this is a four-vote margin or not? And he said, No, no, it’s a four-vote margin, it’s down to that. I said, That’s it. And we took it. So, because of GAO’s position, thank God, that’s what I took to the floor. But the Republicans always viewed it as a disputed election. We basically had the Democrats win.\n\nWe took it to the floor. Republicans, I remember, walked out. Newt Gingrich led them out but, thank God, the member who was elected then won by a fairly good margin the next election, so it was pretty clear that he was able to hold that seat.\n\nWhat that did is it started to increase the friction between Republicans and Democrats. And that was one of the factors that, as I said, ultimately led to the divisiveness that you see today in the institution.\n\nRiley\n\nOn what grounds were the Republicans challenging the GAO? Just because it was so close they felt surely there must be—\n\nPolsby\n\nThey wanted to have a new election. And when that did not prevail, they fought it out on the floor.\n\nPanetta\n\nThat’s right, yes, they basically said, We want a new election. And I said, Well, yes, but we went through a process, we came to the count, and yes, it’s three or four votes. I wish it had been more, but the GAO confirms that.\n\nPolsby\n\nThere were disputed ballots. I remember your statement was a remarkably good one. There were some ballots that were questionable, and you said, You simply don’t want to have an election turn on illegal ballots.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, questionable ballots. But the answer to your question is, I earned my political stripes. I had been pretty independent in the way I voted. I voted against pay raises, I voted against a lot of things that I didn’t believe in and had developed a pretty independent reputation. And leading the reconciliation effort. And in terms of Tip O’Neill and the Democratic leadership—\n\nPolsby\n\nGot all the chairmen mad at you.\n\nPanetta\n\nGot a lot of the chairmen mad at me. But having done that, again they said, Okay, this guy came down, and even though it was tough, did what he had to do. Ultimately, that probably helped get me elected Chairman of the Budget Committee.\n\nPolsby\n\nBut there’s a history of the Budget Committee. Basically, the Chairman of the Budget Committee, which is a limited term, they leave, they don’t hang around. There’s something about being on the Budget Committee that uses up your—\n\nGilmour\n\nThat’s true, Giaimo, [James R.] Jones, [William H.] Gray, all left after their chairmanships.\n\nPolsby\n\nYes.\n\nPanetta\n\nWell, there is a term limitation.\n\nGilmour\n\nI mean they left the House.\n\nPanetta\n\nOh, yes, interestingly enough, that’s right.\n\nPolsby\n\nThat’s the point I was trying to reach for.\n\nPanetta\n\nLook, if you do that job right, you’re going to piss a lot of people off. [laughter]\n\nGilmour\n\nSo in the election contest, you solidified your ties with Democratic leaders. Did you at the same time burn bridges with your friends in the Republican Party?\n\nPanetta\n\nWhat I had always done, on the Agriculture Committee for example, Bill Emerson who was my ranking on the Nutrition Subcommittee, was somebody who worked closely with me on food stamps and that never was—Frankly there was a recognition that Bill Thomas was to some extent a hothead and that he didn’t necessarily represent the Republicans that I got along with. So my relationship with people at my ranking on Budget, Bill, from Minnesota—\n\nPolsby/Gilmour\n\n[William Eldridge] Frenzel.\n\nPolsby\n\nLovely fellow.\n\nPanetta\n\nNice guy. Bill Frenzel and I continue to work together, [Robert] Michel and I continued to get along, so I continued to get along with at least the heart and soul of the Republican leadership. But those newer members who were coming in at that time were much more ideological. There were more of those beginning to develop who took the hard-line view. I wasn’t going to crack them, no matter what the hell I did.\n\nRiley\n\nI don’t know whether you’ve got more questions—\n\nGilmour\n\nMaybe we should move on to the Clinton administration.\n\nRiley\n\nActually, I want to intervene on one point before we get there, because we’re running simultaneously interview projects on the two administrations prior to the Clinton administration, and we get a lot of testimony on the record about the 1990 budget agreement, but from the administration’s side, and you were on the negotiating team.\n\nPanetta\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nI’d like to hear your account of what happened in the development of the 1990 budget accord.\n\nPanetta\n\nIt actually goes back to the election of George Bush the first. He gets elected, he makes this pledge, Read my lips, no new taxes. In the period between the time of the election and the time he takes office, [G.V.] Sonny Montgomery, who is a close friend, Congressman from Mississippi, says, Would you come up to the President-elect’s house and talk about budget issues so he understands what has to be done in terms of the budget? So with Tom Foley and some Republican members, I can’t remember everybody who was there, but it was probably about five or six members, we sat down to talk to George Bush. I can remember saying to him at the time, Mr. President-elect, if you don’t confront this issue— Don’t forget, we’re at $200 billion deficits, and you look out there and you can see nothing but going to $300 billion deficits and $400 billion deficits. And the estimate was we were going to hit $600 billion by the time we got into the new century.\n\nSo I said, I recognize what you said in the campaign, but ultimately, the only way you can deal with deficits of this size is to deal with both spending cuts and revenue increases. You have to deal with both, there is no other way to do this. And if you don’t do it, if you try to tiptoe past this problem, ultimately what will happen is you will not have any resources to commit to whatever you want to establish as your legacy as President. You won’t. You’ll be working along the edges here and you’ll try to move a few dollars here and a few dollars there, but the reality is you will not have the resources to commit to priorities, because the deficits will eat it up. And you’ll never have a strong economy, because as long as those high deficits are out there, they’re going to impact. I said the same thing to Bill Clinton four years later.\n\nAt the time Bush said, I understand what you’re saying, but I’ve made this pledge. Give me some time to do some of the things I have to do and maybe there will come a point in time where we will have to sit down and do this.\n\nRiley\n\nDid he have his staff members there too? Was Dick Darman there?\n\nPanetta\n\nI think Darman was there. Yes, I’m pretty sure Darman was there at the time.\n\nRiley\n\nNick Brady maybe?\n\nPanetta\n\nI think Brady was too. Later on I developed a pretty good relationship with Dick Darman. We were fighting our way through several of the early budgets and not getting very far and having a lot of disputes, and Darman kept saying, Look, there will come a point at which we will try to do what we have to do to try to control this problem.\n\nWe finally get into the ’90 year, and I think it becomes clear that if they don’t deal with it, the election is going to come and they’re going to have a horrendous deficit on their hands. I think part of it was looking ahead to that. But as I recall, Darman kept saying, We’ve got to find the right chemistry to bring this together and do the negotiation that has to be done on the grand solution to this problem.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you getting signals from anybody else in the administration in this direction or do you have conversations with John Sununu, or is it—\n\nPanetta\n\nIt’s basically Darman. So we pass a budget resolution, I think we pass it in the House. And the Senate has a harder time passing a budget resolution and finally, because of the dispute over the ability to do that it ultimately forces—and then Bush calls for a conference. We have a lot of preliminary discussions, and they ultimately lead to the sessions we have at Andrews Air Force Base. During that discussion, what I could see happening was that Darman and OMB were working very closely with us to get the pieces put together, but there was also the politics of what goes first, you do spending, you do taxes. You had to do the spending stuff first in order to give them some cover, because it was always made clear that ultimately you’re not going to put this package together, going into all of these spending cuts on Medicare, Medicaid, farm programs and other things, unless ultimately you come around on the revenue side. And they said, We want to see you put that on the table first. So we went through that process. It was clear even going through there that people like Newt Gingrich who were participating were not buying into this process.\n\nGilmour\n\nBut he later led a revolt against the agreement when it came to the House.\n\nPanetta\n\nThat’s right.\n\nGilmour\n\nDid he make it clear during the meetings that he wasn’t buying it and that he was going to fight it, or was it a surprise?\n\nPanetta\n\nWell, he’s sitting there, but he’s also reading the newspaper and you don’t get the sense he’s really engaged.\n\nPolsby\n\nThe first time through you didn’t get Democratic support in the House either, wasn’t that right?\n\nPanetta\n\nNo. Democrats didn’t like the level of Medicare cuts—\n\nRiley\n\nThis was after the summit—\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, this is after the summit. Don’t forget, we go through the summit, we put some of these pieces together. We’re working on a whole set of enforcement, reconciliation—the whole idea of caps on discretionary, plus pay as you go, all of that is being worked out as part of the enforcement tool on budget. We work out a lot of the spending stuff and then we start on the revenue stuff, and it’s obvious the administration is dicey about that.\n\nRiley\n\nWere you trying to help them?\n\nPanetta\n\nNo. Rostenkowski, to his credit, is trying to do whatever he can to get them to come along. George Mitchell, to some extent, is a little more political because he knows that he’s got Bush where he wants him.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is the impression that we get from the Republicans. His name is not well regarded among people—\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, Mitchell always understood that this was the moment when Bush moves his lips, and the ultimate political attack becomes very real. On the other hand, I think everybody recognized there was going to be a point—We went through fees, we went through other things, but to make this thing work, you had to go into tax increases. So that’s the point at which it becomes that much tougher to bring those pieces together and that’s where there is an agreement to adjourn to Foley’s office and work there. In that meeting you’ve got Darman, Nick Brady—\n\nRiley\n\nSununu?\n\nPanetta\n\nI’m trying to think if Sununu is present, I think he is. Then you’ve got Foley, Gephardt, Mitchell, can’t remember who else. Domenici and I are basically working on the outside, but giving them the information they need to go through the pieces. But most of that discussion is on the tax side.\n\nPolsby\n\nWhat was Darman like to negotiate with?\n\nPanetta\n\nDarman’s in there too, by the way.\n\nPolsby\n\nWhat was Darman like to negotiate with? I keep picking up stuff that people don’t trust Darman.\n\nPanetta\n\nI always thought Darman’s heart was in the right place in terms of what he wanted to do. Darman’s problem—I’m not so sure it just began with the summit, I think it probably began before that, as he was trying to get other things through at OMB. I don’t know all the inside, but I picked up that there had been friction between Darman and economists in the White House and Brady going back a long time. Suddenly, at this point, I take Darman at his word. Darman is basically saying, We’ve got to get this done.\n\nI think they understand that this is not going to happen without George Bush having to agree to taxes, but their hope is that you put enough spending cuts on the table to soften the blow. I think that was the whole politics of this whole thing. Ultimately, we put the package together, we’re struggling on the Democratic side to hold Democratic votes on Medicare, because there are some pretty large Medicare cuts. We think we’ve pretty much got the Democrats, if we can pick up some of the Republicans, because that was always the key, you had to have that. I can remember going over to the Senate side, the Republicans are caucusing, Democrats have pretty much agreed to go with this package.\n\nRiley\n\nBut this is after the President has made his announcement.\n\nPanetta\n\nThat’s correct. We’ve gone down to the White House. Incidentally, when we go to the White House, it’s pretty clear Newt Gingrich is not there at the White House. We’re losing Gingrich and we lose a couple of other members. I think Lloyd Bentsen may have been concerned about it. Can’t remember.\n\nPolsby\n\nGingrich is not there because Gingrich doesn’t want to be there? Or because the White House doesn’t want him?\n\nPanetta\n\nCombination of both. But I think Gingrich didn’t want to be there, he did not want to bless this thing. I think at that point we all knew that we were going to have some real problems with the Gingrich wing of the Republican Party.\n\nWe go back to the Hill. This is a large package now. Don’t forget we’re talking about not only a budget resolution, we’re talking about reconciliation and we’re talking about appropriations, all in one package. This is the largest package. Everything, to some extent, for the entire year is wrapped up in this one package. I don’t think that’s ever happened since. So it is a very big package. We go back to the Hill and we have our caucuses and they’re some tough caucuses, but I think generally it is our sense that we can probably get the Democratic votes we need if the Republicans will show up and provide some votes. And Frenzel and I, as I said, working very closely with Frenzel and our friend from Illinois—\n\nPolsby\n\nBob Michel—\n\nPanetta\n\nBob Michel is really working at it. So we’re all over in Mitchell’s office and the Republicans are in caucus and they’re not coming out. I can remember Frenzel coming over and saying, We’re having some problems. And I’m saying, Wait a minute, we’ve got the President of the United States, we’ve got the leadership, we’re ready to go. What do you mean? He says, Hey, we’re having some real problems.\n\nIt goes on and on, there’s this long delay and finally we make the decision that—I think we passed it on the Senate side if I’m not mistaken. I’m trying to remember the sequence.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s easy enough to check.\n\nPanetta\n\nYou can check and see, but I think we tried to pass it on the Senate side first in order to create some pressure on the House. That’s my recollection, but you have to check. In any event, it comes to the House floor and it goes down. And the Republicans, there are a few moderates that still stick with it, but they lose it. So immediately we’re in a situation where we can’t get this through. And we suddenly come together and I think the Democrats make the fundamental decision, wait a minute, in order to pick up the Democrats we need to make up for these Republicans who are taking a walk, we’ve got to reduce the amount of the Medicare cut and increase the amount of taxes.\n\nThat picks us up some additional Democratic votes and ultimately that’s how we pass it. So we finally get it through, and the Republicans sign off, the Senate signs off, and the administration finally says they don’t like it but they know it’s the only way. Hell, at that point the whole damn session hinges on whether or not—You’ve got to pass this stuff or nothing else is going to happen. Because of that, we’re able to finally get it through and get the bill signed.\n\nI have always said, and I said to President Bush, that it was a very courageous thing to do. It was also a very important step. The passage of those enforcement tools, caps on discretionary spending, pay as you go was very helpful to a budget chair trying to enforce discipline, probably the most important tools. I don’t think we would have gotten a balanced budget without those tools.\n\nIn addition, although there was some immediate impact, I think the most important thing in the ’90 budget agreement is that it was a five-year path. It was a five-year deficit-reduction path and it produced some significant savings in the long run that in large measure helped us. It helped move us toward a balanced budget. I thought the President should have taken credit for that instead of later on apologizing for having done it. I understand his concern about the politics, but I think there’s a point at which you have to say, I’ve done the right thing. I’ve done the right thing for the country. And I think he would have come across a hell of a lot better than somebody apologizing for what was frankly good policy.\n\nRiley\n\nJohn, do you have any follow-ups on that?\n\nPolsby\n\nWell, later that same year, the government shut down for a day.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes. It was actually in the middle of that because we were all operating on a CR [Continuing Resolution]. I think there was a weekend where the CR—\n\nPolsby\n\nIt was October 6th, my daughter was born that day.\n\nPanetta\n\nYou would remember.\n\nPolsby\n\nMy son was born the day Nixon left office.\n\nRiley\n\nNothing happened on the day my son was born.\n\nGilmour\n\nYou’ll never forget those days.\n\nPanetta\n\nThe first time the federal government is shut down it happens over a weekend. I remember, we’re in these negotiations, and I’m walking to the meeting on the weekend, and tourists are out there and they’re not able to go in and they’re literally yelling at us as we’re going in, because they can’t go into the monuments—\n\nPolsby\n\nOh, it’s just like a faculty meeting at the University of California.\n\nPanetta\n\nI’ll never forget, four years later and we’re in the shutdown with the Gingrich people, and we’re in the Oval Office and I remember Bob Dole saying, You know, you could shut the government down maybe one or two days, but you go beyond that they come looking for you. Those are his quotes, I’ll never forget. I’m sure we were thinking of that time because he was right. We were able to get by on a weekend because you’re dealing with a few tourists in Washington, but man, you shut down the federal government for longer than that—If that was any indication—what the tourists were doing to us going in—you knew you were going to have a blow-up on your hands.\n\nGilmour\n\nBut can you recall what other kinds of lessons you might have learned from that experience? Because then you do have the shutdown again in ’95—\n\nPanetta\n\nYes.\n\nGilmour\n\nAnd I think people must have been shaping subsequent strategies from what they learned in ’90. One thing, later on the Republicans concluded that George Bush lost because of that, and so they were concluding perhaps that Clinton would lose. Was there anything about that experience that would justify that kind of conclusion in your mind?\n\nPanetta\n\nOn the Republican side?\n\nGilmour\n\nYes, and why they would have believed that.\n\nPanetta\n\nNo. Remember this was a revolution, and there were revolutionaries who had been elected based on the Contract for America. I honestly think that deep down Newt Gingrich understood that this was probably the wrong thing to do. But I think to a large extent his hands were tied because he had created this group of members who really believed that their mission in life was to get their budget adopted, to get their contract adopted. And because they had been elected on that basis, they would lose the momentum if they capitulated at this point. So I think they deeply believed that they were going to show to the country just how deeply they believed they were right by shutting down the government. And also I think this is not a group of members that ultimately believes in the role of federal government anyway. To some extent, yes, shutting down the federal government, so what?\n\nPolsby\n\nNewt’s a theoretical thinker, and I think he actually believed that it would hurt Clinton. You’re asking whether there was any justification for it, and the most likely thing is the precedent that that kind of thing hurt Bush.\n\nPanetta\n\nBut I also think deep down Newt Gingrich felt that ultimately Bill Clinton would cave in.\n\nPolsby\n\nRight, right.\n\nPanetta\n\nThey really thought that as long as they held tough, and to some extent—Even Bill Clinton sent signals that we could do something here, because Clinton’s basic instincts were always to cut a deal, try to resolve it. I think he may have given them some sense that if they pushed hard enough he would come their way.\n\nRiley\n\nWe’ll want to deal with this—\n\nPanetta\n\nBut I think that was part of their thinking as well. On the other hand, I have to tell you, Bob Dole thought this was all nuts.\n\nGilmour\n\nWell, since he thought that after a day or two they’d come after you, he learned the right lesson.\n\nPanetta\n\nExactly. But also at that point Dole was running for President. He knew he needed the Newt Gingriches and right wing of the world to get through the primaries. So to some extent his hands were tied to do it, until you had the series of shutdowns and then Bob Dole finally said, Enough is enough.\n\nPolsby\n\nYou’re one of the right people for me to ask this question. It has always seemed to me that Bob Dole is an example of radical misperception led by inaccurate news media coverage. That is to say, they always had Dole down as a dour, inflexible, stuck in the mud—\n\nPanetta\n\nWrong, wrong.\n\nPolsby\n\nAnd it’s always seemed to me that that was completely wrong.\n\nPanetta\n\nAbsolutely. I was in the U.S. Senate as a legislative assistant when Bob Dole was first elected, and Bob Dole came out of Kansas as someone nobody particularly viewed as a right wing—\n\nPolsby\n\nHe was born of a Democratic family. He had an interesting history.\n\nPanetta\n\nHe came there and he immediately got involved, of course, in agricultural issues. I actually got involved with Bob Dole in a couple of issues when I was on the Agriculture Committee on food stamp legislation. Bob Dole was very helpful on food stamp legislation. He was very supportive, and he worked with us to try to get food stamp legislation through. Secondly, I moved some legislation to provide Medicare coverage for hospice services. I was always proud of that, but I introduced the first bill on the House side. Bob Dole introduced the same bill on the Senate side. So on Medicare and issues like that Bob Dole was always very good.\n\nI remember negotiating with him on reconciliation. Bob Dole was very helpful at trying to negotiate some of this stuff out. I never viewed him as an ideologue. I viewed him always as somebody who was trying to do things based on what he thought was in the public interest. I have a great deal of respect for him.\n\nOne of my great joys was always to watch people—a Tom Foley and a Bob Dole sitting down at a conference, they could cut a deal in ten seconds. They thought alike, they had the same sense of what was right for the country, and it was always a joy. It was what you always hoped others would learn that makes the best of our process when that happens. I always thought, frankly, that Dole in the end might be able to persuade Gingrich to come around.\n\nI think what happened is at that point Bob was worried about his own—This is the beginning of the election year.\n\nRiley\n\nWhy don’t we take about a five-minute break and come back and move into ’92?\n\nPolsby\n\nWe’re covering a lot of history here.\n\nRiley\n\nIt’s fascinating for us, we talk for days about this. What we will try to do is march ahead. Did you have a declared preference for a presidential candidate going into 1992? Had you endorsed someone in the primary season?\n\nPanetta\n\nI don’t think so. The one time I worked for anybody was Dick Gephardt when he ran, but I think that was in ’88.\n\nPolsby\n\n’88 would have been his strongest year. That’s when he won Iowa and then got aced out of it by bad publicity, the focus on the Republican, on Pat Robertson overwhelming Bush in the straw poll and that nominated [Michael] Dukakis.\n\nPanetta\n\nExactly, so I had supported Dick. Then four years later there were a few out there, but I think the answer to your question is, I had not endorsed anybody.\n\nRiley\n\nSome of the evidence in the briefing book indicates you had written something or spoken publicly in a critical way about President Clinton’s economic package. I got the sense that was in the spring or the summer of ’92. I’m wondering if you could reconstruct for us the circumstances that led you to take a public position on this and what evidence you were basing your conclusions on, what you had to say.\n\nPanetta\n\nI think what had happened is that their campaign had issued a plan for trying to deal with the deficit, and I was chair of the Budget Committee at the time. We analyzed it and they had made some assumptions on some of the potential savings that we thought just were not credible. I didn’t disagree with the priorities in it, I didn’t disagree with the description of what he thought was the problem, but to try to do what they had done in terms of achieving some of the savings that they had—\n\nPolsby\n\nWho did the analysis for you? Talk a little bit about the people who worked for you.\n\nPanetta\n\nOn the Budget Committee we had our chief economist, a fellow named Joe Minarik, a fellow who worked on the analysis, John Angell, who was my director for the committee. We had some of the key people from not only there but also on Ways and Means who looked at some of the tax stuff for us as well. We did our regular analysis of any proposal that would come in.\n\nI don’t think I went out of my way to put anything out that would in any way undercut it, but I think the press called and asked, What are the reactions? I said I thought their heart was in the right place, they were trying to do the right thing, but that some of their assumptions about what the savings would be were not credible.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you recall, were you basing this on their published plan?\n\nPanetta\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have any communications, did anybody from the campaign call you after that and—\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, they never called and they never really came by to lay out what their proposal was about. I think we just got a copy of the plan that the campaign had put out and analyzed that.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you go to the convention in ’92?\n\nPanetta\n\nWent to the convention in ’92, New York City. I was a delegate from California. I think as you know, members of Congress—\n\nRiley\n\nSuper-delegate.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, we had the super-delegates in those days. So went there and I’m not sure—was it there or Atlanta?—I was asked to speak on the budget issues and what have you, and I think I spoke. Yes, I remember I spoke and it was close to the day when Clinton was going to appear. I remember, in New York, I had spoken and I was down in the green room area below the platform, and rushing through were Clinton and George Stephanopoulos, whom I had worked with when he was an aide on the floor to Dick Gephardt. I had worked pretty closely with him during all of the ’90 budget stuff and a lot of the budget summits. I remember saying hello to him at that time and he was like 40 feet off the ground because it was all moving in the right direction for these guys.\n\nThen Clinton spoke and I think it was soon after we really had a sense that Clinton and [Al] Gore just might put this together and be able to win.\n\nRiley\n\nYou had not had that sense before?\n\nPanetta\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us what your perceptions of Clinton were coming through the primary season.\n\nPanetta\n\nI did not know him personally. I’d met him a couple of times. He came up when he was head of the Governors and they were doing a proposal on education. He was asking to put a lot of money into education and was arguing how important it was. I remember when he made the presentation, I said, We’re dealing with some pretty healthy deficits, I think it would probably help your plan if you could figure out how to pay for this. Basically what I was saying to everybody. I think he said something like, Can’t you just get this out of Defense? or Can’t you get it out of something like that? And I said, You know, there are probably a lot of areas, but I think it would help the credibility of your plan and the Governors’ plan, if you really want the Congress to pay serious attention to it, to point to some areas where you think the funding could be achieved to get it done.\n\nSo it was clear that he was very bright and very capable and committed. I ran into him a couple of times later. I had to do a presentation where Hillary [Rodham Clinton] was present. I think it was actually a Governors’ conference, and his wife was there and I was speaking on the budget and what was happening on the Hill at that time, so I met her then. My sense was that he was positioned in the right place as a southern Governor and was bright and obviously capable, that he was positioned in the right place, but you still had to believe that a President who came out of the Persian Gulf war, and was an incumbent, that the advantage still was with Bush. That was what I generally sensed.\n\nBut as the campaign went on and as Ross Perot got into it and the whole debate began to heat up, and also because you had the sense that, particularly on the economic issues, Bush was not—There just was not the sense that something had to be done in dealing with the economy and there were too many divisions going on. He was beginning to lose some steam. I don’t think I really thought it was possible until he got on the bus with Gore and they began those bus trips and you began to see the public’s reaction. When that happens, you know there’s something magic in the air.\n\nRiley\n\nHow well did you know Gore?\n\nPanetta\n\nVery well. We were elected in the same class in ’76 and—\n\nPolsby\n\nIs it true he was a loner in Congress?\n\nPanetta\n\nGore, actually—\n\nRiley\n\nHe nodded yes, just for the record.\n\nPanetta\n\nFor the record. Yes, he was. When I was legislative assistant on the Senate side, his father was still in the Senate. I remember his father well and the price he paid with regards to the Vietnam war when he was defeated. I don’t know that I ever met him. It’s possible I may have met him when I was over in the Senate as legislative assistant.\n\nWe developed a relationship soon after he was elected. Both he and his wife were very pleasant and bright and able people, but clearly as we continued he was the kind of guy who liked to work his own issues, do his own thing, develop his own press. It was not like he would build coalitions or try to work his way into building bonds with the rest of the Congress. He was focused on his issues, his agenda, and doing his public relations thing.\n\nHaving said that, we used to have a group in the House that played basketball in the gym. It was both Republicans and Democrats and we would go down to the gym if there was a long debate, in the afternoon or the evening. And we would play games down there and we played games to about, I think the net was low enough that you could fit in four or five games. He would come down and be part of that. So we developed a relationship based on that and then Tom Downey, who was one of these players, developed a close relationship with him as well.\n\nLater on, Tom Downey would have dinners and he would invite Al, even after he got elected on the Senate side, to participate in those dinners. So we developed a close personal relationship.\n\nRiley\n\nHow good a basketball player was he?\n\nPanetta\n\nHe was a very good outside shooter, which might even reflect his politics.\n\nPolsby\n\nDo you know the political scientist Alan Ware played basketball with Clinton at Oxford, and he said Clinton was definitely second-string material.\n\nGilmour\n\nWould Gore pass the ball?\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, Clinton was not good. Gore did not pass the ball very much, basically he was a huge outside shooter, outside the circle. He’s what you call a three-point shooter.\n\nPolsby\n\nDidn’t have three points in those days.\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, we didn’t have three points.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd Leon Panetta’s strengths on the basketball court were?\n\nPanetta\n\nI passed the ball a lot. [laughter] I had a good shot from the corner, that was my claim to fame. He had a two-handed shot from the back court, and he and Norm Dicks from—\n\nPolsby\n\nWashington.\n\nPanetta\n\n—Washington.\n\nPolsby\n\nGreat guy.\n\nPanetta\n\nNorm Dicks, every time he’d make a shot he’d yell Husky!\n\nPolsby\n\nHis son’s at our law school.\n\nPanetta\n\nIs he?\n\nGilmour\n\nWhen you interviewed with Clinton in late ’92, was it clear that you were up for OMB only or were you being considered for other positions as well?\n\nRiley\n\nIf I could ask one question before we get to that. Did you do anything in the campaign for the—\n\nPanetta\n\nNot very much. I remember I got some calls from Gene Sperling—\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nPanetta\n\nDuring the campaign, as they were preparing for some of the debates—\n\nPolsby\n\nHad you known him before? I mean, is there a budget Mafia somehow that exists?\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, but I think both Sperling and Bob Reich were working the economic side for him. I remember getting some calls from them asking, Are we on the right track? What do you think? They knew that their whole deficit issue was being exposed to a lot of national attention, so they were asking What are some of the pitfalls here that we have to avoid? Particularly with Perot back in the campaign and Perot basically emphasizing the deficit issue. That was his strong point.\n\nRiley\n\nElaborate on that.\n\nPanetta\n\nI think that’s one of those campaigns, frankly, where if Ross Perot hadn’t gone off the deep end, both getting out and then getting in and then having this screwball for a Vice President, I think Perot probably could have been a much stronger force. But he was effective. I give him a lot of credit because he was effective at bringing the deficit issue to the front burner, and a lot of people focused on it as a result.\n\nRiley\n\nHe brought a lot of people down to consult with him. Did he ever call you? Did you talk with Ross Perot?\n\nPanetta\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nI guess John’s question about your original meeting—\n\nPanetta\n\nI think the first thing is that Bob Reich comes by the office.\n\nPolsby\n\nHe was doing the recruiting on the economic side. He recruited Laura Tyson, I know that.\n\nPanetta\n\nI didn’t know that. Bob Reich came by and it’s that Robert Redford scene like, What the hell are we supposed to do now? And he says, Now we’ve got this huge deficit issue and we’ve got to deal with budgets, and it’s suddenly an academic coming-to-Jesus and seeing what really had to happen here. He came in and said, We’ve got this huge challenge. I remember talking to him, saying, You’ve got to confront, first thing that’s out of the box is the budget, that’s the thing you have to focus on. That will define you as an administration and it will tell the country whether you’re serious about dealing with it or whether you want to continue the same dance that Bush was engaged in.\n\nPolsby\n\nBut he didn’t agree with you.\n\nPanetta\n\nReich?\n\nPolsby\n\nMaybe I’m wrong about this, but it seemed to me that you and Bob Rubin were one gang in there but Bob Reich was definitely not on that side.\n\nPanetta\n\nBob Reich was more interested, obviously, in how to develop funding for the priorities that the President needed to care about. He was much more attuned to that. But for the purposes of that first meeting, he also recognized that it was developing the gut awareness that you suddenly develop when you have this huge responsibility of, How do you get to where he wants to go? Even a Bob Reich knew that for him to get there, he had to walk through the deficit fire.\n\nRiley\n\nThis meeting took place in Washington?\n\nPanetta\n\nYes, it took place in my office in Washington.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you remember how soon after the election this took place?\n\nPanetta\n\nIt wasn’t that long, it was within a few weeks of the election. The next visit was Warren Christopher coming by—\n\nRiley\n\nIn Washington.\n\nPanetta\n\n—in Washington. He came by the office and basically said, Look, we’re trying to talk about names for the economic team, what are some names?\n\nPolsby\n\nThat’s right, he ran the transition.\n\nPanetta\n\nExactly. He’s the one running the transition, and he’s basically developing the names for the Cabinet. I had known Warren Christopher from the Carter administration. He’s asking for names for Secretary of the Treasury, and he’s asking about OMB, and I think he may have even asked about Commerce. So we’re talking through some names. I said, You really have to get people who are credible and are going to give you the best information possible. I don’t honestly remember from that meeting that there was any discussion about whether I would be interested in OMB. I think it was more, What are the names you can come up with to talk about?\n\nSo we go through those two meetings and then the next thing I know, we’re in a congressional break after the election. I think I was pruning apricot trees and my wife calls from the house that Warren Christopher is on the phone. Christopher says, Can you come down to Little Rock to talk with the President-elect about economic policy and just have a conversation with him? Now, by that time you begin to get rumors that the press is starting to speculate on names for the different Cabinet positions, but on OMB my name is at least beginning to be circulated in the press as a possibility.\n\nSo I go down to Little Rock. Because of the press attention, when you got to the airport they’d put you into I think it was an SUV that had darkened windows so the press didn’t know who the hell was going in to see Clinton. I can remember going in the back of one of these darkened vehicles, and obviously the press is out there with the cameras. They know these vehicles are holding all these individuals who are going in to talk to the President. They take me into the mansion and let me off and I go in. They ask me to wait, and I remember Hillary Clinton came in. She came up and introduced herself and talked to me and we exchanged some nice words. Then I was asked to go up and speak to the President.\n\nSo I went upstairs in the mansion and went in a room. He came in and he was very interested in not only talking about how you deal with the deficit, but he was particularly asking, What is the process for getting this done? What will I have to go through here? What am I facing?\n\nBecause of my own experience on the budget, I said, This is what you have to do. Your first challenge is going to be to put a budget together. You’ll have to make revisions on the Bush budget, and then you’ll have to put your own budget together and it’s in that budget that you will essentially set the path for your administration. You’ll have to confront the deficit issue, you’ll have to decide what your priorities are. That budget will be THE document that defines you as an administration. He asked, Then what happens?\n\nI said, You’ve got to pass a budget by April 15th. We’ll get your budget through. I continued to be Chairman of the Budget Committee at that point. I said, We’ll get your budget through and then you have to implement it. Probably the next biggest step is reconciliation because whatever you put in that budget, the way we will implement it— Don’t forget, we had a Democratic House, Democratic Senate—\n\nGilmour\n\nWas he familiar with any of the process?\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, he was not that familiar with it. Again, with a mind like Clinton’s it’s amazing, he grabs this stuff very quickly. But it was, What is reconciliation? To some extent he was still Governor of Arkansas dealing with how a Governor deals with a budget. For him, developing a budget was a line item by line item process. He understood what you had to do to go over to the legislature and get it passed, but these were all foreign processes now. Reconciliation was a whole different ballgame.\n\nSo we talked through reconciliation. Because that’s the key, I said. If you’re going to cut spending, if you’re going to raise taxes, you’ve got to do it through reconciliation. That’s a very important vehicle. And I told him why it was very effective on the Senate side, because you could avoid a filibuster. So we talked through that and I said, You do reconciliation and then you do the appropriations process, and it was like Budget 101. I said, The appropriations process you’re going to have to get spending, that’s where you really have to concentrate to make sure that the priorities you care about—whether it’s education, job training, research, whatever your priorities are going to be—it’s the appropriations process that you’ll have to go through. And that’s probably more in line with what you had to do in the state to make sure you get the funding you want for those programs.\n\nIn essence, I painted the picture of what you as President of the United States have to do to take your priorities, take your agenda, and get it accomplished through the legislative process.\n\nRiley\n\nBut at that point you weren’t talking about the priorities, you were just talking about the process.\n\nPanetta\n\nWe were really talking process. And he was asking a lot of questions. This meeting went on for about an hour and a half. It was a long meeting. I think we might have been interrupted by one phone call, but it was a long, very in-depth meeting about, What is this process that I’ve got to go through? I was being very frank saying, You can’t get this done any other way. You’ve got to walk through these hoops.\n\nGilmour\n\nWas he sounding you out at all about your level of interest in being in the administration?\n\nPanetta\n\nNot really. Throughout this conversation it was all very substantive and very much devoted to the budget process, reconciliation, how do you piece these things together, what do you do to deal with the deficit, what do you recommend, what are your thoughts on that. It was all very substantive. At the very end he said, Do you have any interest in the Office of Management and Budget?\n\nAt that time I said, Look, I’m Chairman of the Budget Committee on the House side. I know the process up there. I may be able to help you better in that position. But any way I can help you as President, this is the one opportunity where, for the first time in a long time we have a chance, with you as President, a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, to set an agenda here that not only confronts the deficit issue, but really does lay out these priorities. To a large extent, you don’t want to undermine your team on Capitol Hill.\n\nI said, I come from a district that isn’t necessarily Democratic. Although I’d won it, I was at that time winning by 75 or 80%. I said, It’s no guarantee. What you don’t want to do is try to get somebody who ultimately can’t protect a safe district for you. That was my first reaction.\n\nRiley\n\nIf I can ask a question here. On your own career path at that time, had you reached the conclusion that you were going to stay in the House of Representatives and make a career out of that? Were you thinking about coming back and running for state politics, were you looking at the Senate?\n\nPanetta\n\nGoing back to my days with Kuchel, I had always looked at politics as a day-to-day thing. I always felt that, having seen it in the time that I served both as legislative assistant and as member of the House, the best thing you can do as a member is do the very best in what you’re doing and if other opportunities come along, fine. But I had seen this in too many friends who had run for other offices, that if they make a decision that they’re going to run for President or Senate or whatever it is, they start to cut corners just instinctively. I never wanted to be in that box. I always wanted to say, I’m going to have to make tough decisions on votes, especially in the budget process. The budget process is not exactly a stepping stone.\n\nRiley\n\nSo when the invitation to join the administration comes, that’s not interrupting a very well-established plan—\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, no. It actually plays pretty much into my view of playing politics on a day-to-day basis. It was an opportunity. It did mean I had to take the time to say, Where do I think I can have the greatest impact?\n\nThe year before, I had developed in the House a ten-year plan to try to balance the budget. I sat down with Republicans and we put it together and published it. We said, If you really want to get to a balanced budget— I remember John Kasich and others, we really spent some time on the Budget Committee working it through. But as I went through that process, I knew deep down that unless you had a President who was committed to getting it done, it would be very difficult to do. And you’re almost stuck in fighting this out, battle by battle. But if you have a President who’s really serious about dealing with this, and a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, you could for the first time put together something that could make a real difference in terms of reversing the deficit path we were on.\n\nRiley\n\nYou didn’t give him an answer at that meeting.\n\nPanetta\n\nI told him what I told you, that my value on the Hill, what I could do, was my knowledge of the budget process. I would be working closely with the Senator from Tennessee who was Chairman, Jim Sasser, on the Senate side. We had a good relationship and could get a package put through, and he had to recognize the value of that. But I think I did say, Look, you’re President of the United States. Any way I can serve you effectively in that process I would consider.\n\nRiley\n\nSo the announcement is made December 9th or 10th, as I remember, early in December.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes. I had gone to one of those Kennedy functions where they’re honoring the Kennedy awardees, it usually happens in December—\n\nPolsby\n\nThe show business ones, the ones at the Kennedy Center?\n\nPanetta\n\nHonors, I think is what they call it. I was there, in my tuxedo, sitting in the orchestra, and they’re going through the honors. At that point it was playing out in the press, there were rumors because everybody was waiting to see what the new President was going to do. I get a note handed to me that I’ve got a call from Warren Christopher. So I get up and go out to a pay phone and Christopher is on the line saying, The President would like to have you come down to Little Rock. He wants to announce your appointment as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nI said, Well, I’m honored. I’m right in the middle of the Kennedy Honors, so I’ll call you back later. So I called my wife and talked with her, and we made the decision that this would be an interesting challenge to take on. I’ve done that most of my life. I think they had a plane go down from Washington to Little Rock, and we went down together for that, and at that time they were announcing the economic team.\n\nThe one thing I can’t remember, I think it was in a phone conversation and it may have been when I called Warren Christopher that he asked, Would you have any problem having Alice Rivlin as your deputy? Because Rivlin was being mentioned for Director of OMB.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nPanetta\n\nI had worked with Alice when she was at CBO [Congressional Budget Office], and I had a great deal of respect for her. So I said, No, I don’t think so, that would be fine. So they said, Well, if we could do that, that would help us a lot.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you interpret that in any particular way at the time?\n\nPanetta\n\nWell, I figured that this was what they were offering Alice as a sop to having me become Director of OMB. Also I had heard that Tom Foley, Gephardt, I think, and Mitchell had made a very strong argument—They had gone down to visit with the President because they were the leadership, and they had made a very strong argument that for OMB Director they wanted me because I had worked with them. I think they were a little nervous about Alice because Alice, as CBO Director, had been pretty independent.\n\nPolsby\n\nShe’s not very political.\n\nPanetta\n\nYes.\n\nPolsby\n\nShe’s a wonderful economist. I’ve known Alice for 40 years. She’s a wonderful economist, she’s a straight shooter, but she doesn’t think politically.\n\nPanetta\n\nNo, I think she thinks substantively what’s right for the country, it ain’t gonna happen—\n\nPolsby\n\nAnd that will never do.\n\nPanetta\n\nI think that’s what made the leadership nervous about it. I’d heard that they had made these arguments, and there was more and more picking up on that front. So I can’t tell you that I was completely surprised when I got the call.\n\nSo we go down and they’re announcing the economic team. I’m trying to remember if they had made any other announcements. I don’t think so. I think this was probably the first big announcement that they were making.\n\nRiley\n\nMy recollection is that you’re correct.\n\nPanetta\n\nAlthough they maybe announced Mack McLarty as Chief of Staff.\n\nRiley\n\nI don’t think so. There’s a fair amount of your own commentary later on when you become Chief of Staff about the desirability during the transitions of getting the White House staff put together.\n\nPolsby\n\nFirst.\n\nRiley\n\nYes, first, and my recollection is that part of the holdup here, and we’ve got some testimony to this effect, is that they had offered McLarty the position but it was sort of on hold. He wasn’t ready at that point to make up his mind.\n\nPanetta\n\nIt seemed to me that at least the format for their announcements had been established. They were doing this out of an older building there, they knew where they were going, we all had tags on the floor. I don’t know whether they had made any other announcement or not.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s easy enough to check.\n\nPanetta\n\nClearly this was the first major announcement of a group to come in. As I recall, they were announcing Ron Brown as Secretary of Commerce, Lloyd Bentsen as Secretary of the Treasury, me as Director of OMB, Alice Rivlin, and I believe Bob Reich, although I’m not sure.\n\nRiley\n\nWas Bob Rubin?\n\nPanetta\n\nI’m sorry, Bob Rubin, that’s right.\n\nPolsby\n\nAnd not Laura.\n\nPanetta\n\nI don’t think Reich and I don’t think Laura.\n\nPolsby\n\nNow, your prior relations with this group—\n\nPanetta\n\nI knew everybody there. Worked with Lloyd Bentsen a great deal when he became Chairman of the Finance Committee, so we had a long relationship. Knew Ron Brown from politics really because Brown had headed up the Democratic Party and I had worked with him in that capacity. Knew Bob Rubin because we had a number of conversations with Rubin and other people from Wall Street to talk through deficit problems, budget problems, etc. He was pretty active and he would come to dinners and participate with the Democratic leadership. And of course I knew Alice. So I knew most of the team. I think you’re right. I don’t think Laura Tyson was announced at that time. And I don’t think Bob Reich was announced at that time.\n\nPolsby\n\nTalk a little more about Rubin, who was characterized early on as a laid-back person and one who did not attempt to put his stamp on conversations and things of that sort.\n\nPanetta\n\nBob Rubin’s style is very interesting. His basic style is to be very self-effacing in the sense of saying, I’m from Wall Street, ask me about securities, ask me about bonds, ask me about that, I know that. But when it comes to politics and Washington and all of this, I don’t really know a lot. The reality is that he does have some strong opinions about what he thinks is the right policy. But his approach is always to stay back and not immediately drop in. In the end Bob Rubin has, I think, some very strong views about what has to be done with the deficit, what has to be done with the budget, and is very effective in helping to argue that we’ve got to stay on path with regard to putting together a tough economic plan, because that’s the first major challenge we face.\n\nI’m asked soon after the announcement to come back to Arkansas and participate in a discussion about how we put this first economic plan together. What’s happening in terms of the economy? So we put together a presentation that becomes the beginning point for the discussions. At that point there’s a lot of serious discussion about if you take on—It was the arguments I’d heard for years but all being played out again. You do serious spending cuts, you do serious tax increases. You’re taking on some heavy political heat. At the same time there was concern about whether you create a drag on the economy and how long it will take for that to turn around, so you begin to see the rewa"
