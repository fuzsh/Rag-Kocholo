        "text": "Development of the Democratic Person, Research/Practice Agenda\n\nDevelopment of the democratic person through research and practice is the theme of the Texas HBCU Conference Series, Democracy Schools, Year Three. A major objective of the year three conference is to help participants develop strategies that enable them to contribute to the state of knowledge and practice in the field (development of the democratic person).\n\nThe Democratic Person. The democratic person is not an individual, but a culture marked by practices of strong meaningful citizenship. The domain (development of democratic person) is a process field as much as substance with insights for just about everything a people do or might do. Strong meaningful citizenship infuses the way the democratic person generally behaves. How would a biologist, for example, who is also culturally a strong meaningful citizen, do biology, and what would new knowledge in the field (a “democratic biology” let’s say) look like? How would an entrepreneur, who is also a strong meaningful citizen do business? Imagine similar impacts and outcomes in student affairs programming, urban planning, music, accounting, etc.\n\nHBCU Leadership and Legacy, Rosenwald Schools. Democratic personhood is closely linked to the concept of human flourishing in philosophy and, in traditions of personalism as developed at Morehouse College in particular. A traditional leader in philosophy among America’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Morehouse was a significant center for development of personalist philosophy and theology in the US. Howard Thurman, Martin Luther King, and many of the leaders of the Black freedom movement were educated at Morehouse. Personalism holds that the flourishing of the personality is the premise of a good society. Personalist philosophy and theology at Morehouse stressed “the sacred or otherwise inviolable dignity of persons…[and] promoted an educational process that activated the potential of individuals within and across diverse communities,” as the historian Kipten E. Jensen stated. Personalism was a major foundation for nonviolent philosophy and a strong cultural view of democracy and citizenship.\n\nThe thousands of Rosenwald schools that Black communities created across the American South (including Texas) during Jim Crow are a powerful example of strong meaningful citizenship infused with ideas of human flourishing from personalism. The movement had direct links to America’s HBCUs. The network of educators closely linked to Rosenwald schools, called Jeanes Teachers, were schooled in HBCUs.\n\nThe larger American society’s failure to recognize the immensely valuable educational and civic history of the Rosenwald schools, and the Jeans Teachers, was a loss to American democracy after Brown v. Board of Education as mainstream school systems failed to hire the bulk of Black teachers who worked in Rosenwald Schools.\n\nDiverse Contributions. Manifold contributions from across disciplines and fields are needed to explore the roots of strong meaningful citizenship in our time and to develop its practices. The visions of the common good and human flourishing and the beliefs and values in practices of strong meaningful citizenship need public discussion and consideration if they are to grow and spread. Cultures emerge when values and beliefs people share lead to ways of doing things and visions of the future that people embrace.\n\nConference Year Three. The year three conference supports this effort. The conference will explore pedagogical personalism’s possibilities as a resource and a guide for developing processes and outcomes in diverse disciplines and domains that reflect and promote practices of strong meaningful citizenship – the values and beliefs, and vision of the common good and of human flourishing therein. The conference will also help scholars and practitioners become better acquainted with the leadership of HBCUs in developing pedagogical personalism and its current possibilities.\n\nAdditionally, conference goers will continue the important conversation (began in year one of the conference and furthered in year two) about higher education policy in Texas and the need to adequately fund Texas HBCUs, both public and private, in manner that is commensurate with the role the Texas HBCU plays in building a shared Texas future. “What now” in the policy discussion is the question that lies ahead after the year two conference.\n\nDuring the year two conference students and stakeholders received training and then visited the Texas State Capitol to share the conference’s desire that Texas lawmakers form a bipartisan Texas HBCU Legislative Caucus. The caucus would be a vehicle for sustaining an ongoing conversation among stakeholders over time about support for Texas HBCUs in Texas higher education policy. Lawmakers were supportive of the idea of the caucus and moreover, of the role of students as important stakeholders in the process. State Representative. Ron Reynold held a public press conference from the Speaker’s Conference Room at the State Capitol to announce his support of the initiative. The press conference was attended by students, State Representative Yolanda Jones, and leaders from the Texas Industrial Areas Foundation network of organizations from Austin and Huston. Formation of a bipartisan Texas HBCU Legislative Caucus requires growing the statewide network of stakeholders in support of HBCUs both public and private in Texas higher education policy. Students and stakeholders are energized by the prospects.\n\nStrong meaningful citizenship. Strong meaningful citizenship is the way of life of the democratic person. It is the leadership that is possible when people, working together in and through community traditions and institutions, across differences of class and race/ethnicity that typically divide constituencies, come together to build a better world. People assemble great power working together this way. Strong meaningful citizenship is locally embedded, directed, and resourced; the leadership practice is inclusive and ideas-oriented, eliciting great passion and energy.\n\nDemocracy schools. Democracy schools nurture strong meaningful citizenship. They are centers of empowerment, community life, and citizenship education where personalist pedagogy affirming the potential of each child can be put into practice across a wide scale. Texas’ and America’s HBCUs are an important example of the commitment (to citizenship development and democracy schools as a model). They are perhaps the quintessential example of approach in American society.\n\nThe third-year conference highlights the historic role of democracy schools in an American democratic renewal. The power of the approach, the leadership of HBCUs, and the astounding practical example of the Rosenwald schools, and more will be featured."
