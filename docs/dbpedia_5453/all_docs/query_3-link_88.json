        "text": "​The new US Disciplinary Barracks was completed in 2002 and is now a 515-bed facility which is considerably smaller than the original one which at one time housed more than 1,000 inmates. The USDB has operated since 1875.\n\nThe USDB is the US Military's only maximum security prison that houses male service members convicted at court-martial for violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The USDB is staffed by the 15th Military Brigade.\n\nFemale prisoners from all branches of the US Military are typically housed in the Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar, CA.\n\n​Fort Leavenworth retains no military personnel records. When a person leaves the post, their records go with them or go to the National Personnel Records Center (address below):\n\nTo request information about a family member, you will need:\n\nfull name, military serial number, and branch of service\n\ndate of birth (and place of birth, if possible)\n\ndate of entry into military service, discharge from military service (DD Form 214) and social security number.\n\nThe facility does not give public tours.\n\nUnited States Disciplinary Barracks\n\n1301 N Warehouse Rd.\n\nFort Leavenworth, KS 66027\n\nPhone: (913) 758-3649 or 3646"
