        "text": "A veterans and military service members coalition will tour Ohio next week, with a stop in the Mahoning Valley, touting the accomplishments of U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown.\n\nCalled “Veterans and Servicemembers for Sherrod,” the group will start in Dayton and make stops in Youngstown, Toledo, Columbus, Cincinnati and Mansfield for Brown, D-Cleveland, who is seeking reelection Nov. 5.\n\nOhio’s U.S. Senate race between Brown, who is running for his fourth six-year term, and Republican Bernie Moreno, a businessman, is considered one of the most-competitive senatorial races in the country along with Montana and likely will determine which political party has the majority in the upper chamber.\n\n“This election is about whose side you are on and I’ll always stand on the side of Ohio’s veterans, sexrvice members and their families by fighting to ensure they receive the resources, benefits and recognition they deserve,” Brown said.\n\nHe added: “We have an obligation to serve our veterans and service members during their service and as veterans, and I am honored to have their support this year.”\n\nBrown wrote and helped pass the Sgt. First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 to secure health care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxins and burn pits during their military service.\n\nHe backed the bipartisan Keep Military Families Together Act to permit service members’ spouses and children to be buried in national cemeteries as well as the Mark Our Place Act to memorialize all Medal of Honor recipients.\n\nThe latter bill passed the Senate, but not the House.\n\nBrown has also introduced a number of other bills to help service members and veterans, and was instrumental in helping the Youngstown Air Reserve Station in Vienna secure eight new C-130J-30 Super Hercules aircrafts. The first one arrived July 16 with Brown speaking at the event.\n\n“Sherrod has led efforts to tackle veteran homelessness, cut red tape to get veterans the health care they deserve and passed legislation that honors our nation’s Medal of Honor recipients,” said Melissa Rodriguez, the committee’s co-chair and a retired Air Force veteran. “Ohio veterans know the stakes of Sherrod’s election. He has our backs and now it’s time to have his.”"
