        "text": "The David F. Bolger name graces buildings, community centers, hospital wings and libraries, which stand as monuments to his \"extraordinary\" generosity and support of local causes.\n\nBolger, who donated close to $100 million to local causes, died at his home Dec. 29 and was laid to rest Friday. The Ridgewood developer was 86.\n\nHe was chairman of Bolger & Company real estate development and investment firm in Ridgewood for 40 years.\n\nBolger, born Aug. 12, 1932, in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, to immigrant parents from The Netherlands, graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1954. He served in the U.S. Air Force and retired as a first lieutenant. He began his career in the steel mills of Pennsylvania, before founding Bolger & Company, Inc., in 1966, according to his obituary\n\nHe founded the Bolger Foundation, which donated millions to social, medical and cultural institutions in Bergen County and the region. Those who knew or met him, said he was not only generous with his money, but his time as well.\n\nRidgewood Library Director Nancy Greene, who accepted financial donations from the foundation on behalf of the library, said Bolger was spontaneous and his actions were also personal.\n\n\"I was debating adopting a child as a single parent at age 50,\" Greene said. \"He was very supportive of adoption, and when he learned this he went across the street to a sport shop and bought the biggest jogging stroller they had and rolled it across the street, into the library and into my office,\" Greene said. \"This was his way of saying 'it's time to go get that baby'.\"\n\nThe Ridgewood Library, Greene said, was one of Bolger's favorite projects.\n\n\"He liked doing things for the library because he felt it was for everyone,\" said Greene. \"He would stop by from time to time and would point out things he thought we should have. He wanted everything just so.\"\n\nIn May, the village celebrated Bolger's $1.5 million renovation of the George L. Pease Memorial Library in Garber Square west of the Ridgewood railroad station.\n\n\"We now lease the building for office use,\" said Greene. \"David had vision. He could see the value in something. He was a wonderful friend to the library.\"\n\nGreene said Bolger's donations were often spontaneous. During one visit he looked to the parking lot and expressed his wish to line it with plantings.\n\n\"He told me to find out what it would cost, and he did it,\" Greene said.\n\nThe Valley Hospital in Ridgewood was another of Bolger's favorites.\n\nIn August the hospital launched its fundraising campaign for the construction of its new Paramus hospital. One of the first donations, for $15 million, was made by the Bolger Foundation.\n\nTen years earlier, the foundation donated $30 million to the hospital, which at the time was believed to be the largest single donation ever made to a hospital in New Jersey.\n\nThe David F. Bolger Medical Arts Building on Linwood Avenue in the former Community Blood Services building off Route 17 in Paramus is also named in his honor.\n\n“We were saddened by the passing of David Bolger, a longtime friend and generous lifetime benefactor to Valley,” said Audrey Meyers, president and CEO of The Valley Hospital and Valley Health System.\n\n“David's extraordinary commitment to helping those in need is well known throughout our area and beyond, and his impact at Valley will be felt for generations to come,\" Meyers said.\n\nHOSPITAL DONATION: New Valley Hospital gets $35 million in donations for Paramus construction\n\nPEASE LIBRARY: The Pease building originally was the Ridgewood Library\n\nIn October 2015, The Children's Therapy Center for special needs children and their families broke ground on the David F. Bolger Campus in Oakland. The CTC used a $5 million matching grant from Bolger and the Foundation to open the new campus. In return, Bolger asked the nonprofit to raise $2.5 million toward the project, a challenge he often issued to the organizations he assisted.\n\n\"He was a visionary,\" said Audra Hoffman, director of development for the CTC. \"He challenged his organizations. He challenged us to better ourselves. He had a view of what we could be we didn't have ourselves.\"\n\nHoffman said the Center holds a David Bolger Day the second week of July each year to celebrate his contribution.\n\n\"It's always an ice cream party because he loved ice cream,\" said Hoffman. \"This year we will plant a tree in his honor.\"\n\nBolger lived on Brautigam Lane in Midland Park before moving to Ridgewood, and made several contributions to the borough. The first was for the conversion of a barn on Dairy Street to what is now the DePhillips Center recreational facility next to the Johnny Vander Meer ballfield.\n\n\"I've known David Bolger about half my life as a police officer and friend,\" said Mayor Harry Shortway. \"He's done so much for Midland Park, for the PBAs. He's not just there for David Bolger. He's there for everybody.\"\n\nIn Midland Park, Bolger donated to other projects, including lights for the junior ballfield, a fence around United Methodist Church, and $1.7 million toward the 2013 renovation of a 100-year-old, two-story barn on Godwin Avenue to house the borough's ambulance corps.\n\n\"We in Midland Park would like to express our deepest gratitude to David Bolger for his contributions,\" said Council President Nancy Peet. \"David Bolger will always be remembered in Midland Park for his kindness, support and encouragement.\"\n\nBolger also contributed to the improvements to Lester Stable in Ridgewood, which now serves as headquarters for the Ridgewood Parks and Recreation Department.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend David F. Bolger,\" said Ridgewood Mayor Ramon M. Hache Sr. \"He was one of Ridgewood’s most impactful residents through his selfless actions and service. His immeasurable philanthropy focused on improving the quality of life of so many people.'\n\nWyckoff Republican Assemblyman Kevin Rooney said he first met Bolger in 1981 while working for a local tree care firm at his home in Ridgewood.\n\n\"Even then I could recognize the kindness and giving in him,\" said Rooney. \"Everyone who has had the honor to know this great man has seen first hand his kindness and generosity, he will be missed by all that knew him and all that knew of him.\"\n\nChris DePhillips, Republican assemblyman from Wyckoff, said Bolger’s contributions were \"immense,\" and called him \"an inspiring veteran, business leader, and philanthropist who gave his time and talents to numerous community causes.”\n\nAlong with his generous nature, Bolger also enjoyed a good joke, according to his obituary. He was known for the occasional giraffe in the front yard, rat in a desk, and other gags.\n\nWest Bergen Mental Health, The Valley Hospital and The Women’s Club of Ridgewood were named in Bolger's obituary as causes to be supported.\n\nThe David F. Bolger Foundation also supported a number of national causes, including a college in Iowa, the Ringling Museum in Florida, Christian Health Care Center in Wyckoff and made a $10 million donation to Northfield Mount Hermon School in Northfield, Mass., to be used for scholarships and to pay for an educator."
