        "text": "Meeting was called to order by Chairman Noh at 1:45 p.m.\n\nSteve Allred, Director, Department of Environmental Quality, informed\n\nthe Committee the department originated about thirty years ago, but\n\nbecame a state agency July 1, 2001. He noted the department is the\n\ntwentieth state agency and the last one as the state constitution provides\n\nfor a limit of twenty. The department is guided by a seven member board.\n\nTwo members of the board have been reappointed by the Governor and\n\nwill be considered by the Senate this session. The department is divided\n\nbetween two Senate Committees: the Health and Welfare Committee, and\n\nthe Resources and Environment Committee.\n\nAllred stated the department budget is performance criteria based under a\n\ncost control process. He proudly noted the department’s overhead is\n\nfifteen percent of its budget. Last year’s departmental backlog of air\n\nquality permits has been addressed and there is not a backlog at this time.\n\nThe department is on schedule with the TMDLs. He stated state water\n\nquality has improved substantially because of volunteer citizen efforts for\n\nimplementation. Twin Falls Canal Company and North Side Canal\n\nCompany are two examples of good voluntary effort. Public health is the\n\nhighest priority of the department.\n\nSome specific areas of interest are: Pit 9 at INEEL remains a controversial\n\nissue with the definition of what is to be removed under the formal\n\nagreement to be determined by the courts. Some of the problem at INEEL\n\nis complicated by national security issues. Upon inquiry, Allred noted\n\nthere is some plutonium movement, but is infrequent and is barely\n\ntraceable. However, it is being monitored and tracked closely.\n\nThe Coeur d’Alene Basin is not anticipated to be a controversial issue this\n\nsession. Relationship with EPA remains challenging. In relation to\n\nground water issues, there are twenty-five areas in the state with\n\nsignificant contaminated drinking water, mostly nitrogen. Two sources of\n\ncontamination are septic systems and too much fertilizer applied at the\n\nwrong time of year. The deterioration of the ground water will take\n\napproximately twenty years to turn around. He noted the problem cannot\n\nbe solved by regulations alone and changing citizen practices is necessary.\n\nThe environmental problems at the FMC plant in Pocatello are\n\nproblematic because some of the involved real property is tribal lands\n\nwhile the remainder is non-tribal. He noted FMC has been cooperative\n\nand has a good commitment to environmental concerns in the ponds on\n\nprivate lands. The slag piles will be covered and planted with vegetation.\n\nAllred stated there has been a significant improvement in air quality. In\n\nconnection with air quality, dairy odor management is a significant issue.\n\nIn an effort to avoid duplication of state monitoring, the Department of\n\nAgriculture is the lead agency for dairy odor management. He\n\ncomplimented the Department of Agriculture for their good working\n\nrelationship.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Allred stated the department’s budget\n\nis a status quo budget. Public health is the first and highest priority of the\n\ndepartment. Within environmental protection a determination is made\n\nwhether a budget reduction would affect the TMDL agreement or similar\n\nissues. The next priority group was evaluated for long-term impacts,\n\ntrends, and deferment. Additionally, there were some things the\n\ndepartment was not required to do specifically. He noted the department\n\nis doing less monitoring in the TMDL process which will make it more\n\ndifficult to delist. The new 303d list will be released this spring.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Allred noted there is an effort among\n\nstate agencies not to duplicate work. The department has memorandum of\n\nunderstanding agreements with the Department of Agriculture and\n\nDepartment of Water Resources in an attempt to eliminate duplication. He\n\nnoted DEQ does not deal with odors; that has been delegated to the\n\nDepartment of Agriculture, but maintain full authorities under EPA and\n\nthe Clean Air Act.\n\nDavid Mabe, Administrator, Division of Water Quality, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Quality, indicated there would be proposed legislation\n\nforthcoming this session to address necessary changes regarding the\n\nTMDL program. A court decision in North Idaho held TMDLs were to be\n\npromulgated as rules. A solution has been reached with involved parties\n\nthat TMDL are plans, not rules. He noted one group feels that TMDLs\n\nshould be enforceable as rules. The TMDL (plans) would be enforced\n\nthrough the different agencies and entities for water quality. Additionally,\n\nthe director should have the authority be able to develop a TMDL using\n\ndownstream state standards such as in the Brownlee/Hells Canyon\n\ncomplex and the Lower Snake River/Columbia River complex. Those\n\nwater bodies are shared with border states under the Clean Water Act and\n\nthe State of Idaho will be able to develop a TMDL that will meet that\n\nreceiving state water standards. Negotiations are underway with EPA for\n\nthe adoption of the TMDLs so the state would not have to promulgate an\n\nalternate state standard. Another issue is the allocation between watershed\n\nadvisory groups in regard to upstream nutrients. He noted the Boise River\n\ndoes not indicate any significant impairment by nutrients, but it does\n\ncontribute a significant nutrient load to the Hells Canyon complex. The\n\ndepartment is attempting to clarify the upstream load application through\n\nthe appropriate watershed advisory groups. He anticipates the issues will\n\nbe resolved to the satisfaction of all parties and proposed legislation will\n\nbe brought to the Legislature this session.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Mabe stated pollution trading is a tool\n\nthe department has been working on for the implementation of TMDLs.\n\nThis has been done on the Boise River with the establishment of a\n\nmanagement group with a pollution trading process. A market system\n\nshould enable workability for the trading process. The final step to be\n\nsettled is the permit allowing the permit holder to trade without being\n\nliable for a violation. Mabe stated the first trade should be completed on\n\nthe Mid-Snake River this spring. There is a possibility of legislation to\n\nallow the pollution trading plans to be adopted by reference in the rules.\n\nThere being no further matters to come before the Committee, the meeting\n\nwas adjourned at 3:05 p.m.\n\nThe meeting was called to order by Chairman Noh at 1:35 p.m.\n\nScott Turlington of the Governor’s Office informed the Committee he is\n\nthe legislative liaison for environmental issues for the Department of Fish\n\nand Game, Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Species\n\nConservation, Idaho Public Utilities Commission, Department of Lands,\n\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation and Department of Agriculture. He\n\nand members of his office will be most happy to assist the legislative in\n\nwhatever capacity they may.\n\nShe noted in Montana the state management plan is proceeding, but in\n\nWyoming assistance is needed. The position of Director for Wyoming’s\n\nFish and Game is vacant which complicates and delays the issue. The ICA\n\nwill continue its endeavors and resources to secure full federal funding for\n\nstate management.\n\nCaswell further informed the Committee of OSC has a plan towards\n\ndelisting with the state management plan becoming the actual guiding\n\nrequirements. The draft will be available within the coming weeks which\n\nhe will bring to the Committee.\n\nJim Caswell, Office of Species Conservation, informed the Committee of\n\nactivities of his offices since the last legislative session. He noted their\n\noffices are now fully staffed with the addition of Policy Advisor: Jeff Allen\n\nLegal Counsel: David Hensley, and Environmental Liaison: Nate Fisher.\n\nHe stated the office’s proposed budget is frugal and he has been able to\n\npay ahead on fixed costs and utilize available federal funding. The role of\n\nthe Office of Species Conservation was to provide a one-stop shopping for\n\nenvironmental issues and for the coordination with all state departments,\n\nagencies and commissions.\n\nGreg Schildwachter, policy advisor, Office of Species Conservation,\n\ninformed the Committee on the status of the wolf reintroduction/delisting\n\nprocess. He noted the growth of the population has been significant with\n\nan estimation of over 400 wolves in Idaho now. He stated there is\n\nprobably thirty actual packs in Idaho now. The state needs the ability to\n\nhave control to ensure a balanced ecological system. The effect on big\n\ngame herds had not been adequately addressed and discussed. Remedy to\n\ndepredation was to relocate a wolf, but this is not always possible. The\n\nlong term solution is for state management of wolves through the\n\nDepartment of Fish and Game. He noted Idaho has a good plan and is\n\nready for the management task. Delisting will be a long process because\n\nof the status of the state management plans in Montana and Wyoming.\n\nClarification of funding needs to be addressed; as well as statutory\n\nchanges to the Idaho Code to allow the Department of Fish and Game to\n\nbe involved in the program.\n\nSara Braasch, Idaho Cattle Association, reported ranchers throughout the\n\nreintroduction area have the same concerns along with requiring federal\n\nfunding for state management. She noted the association has a good\n\nworking relationship with OSC and appreciates the exchange of\n\ninformation. During a telephone conference call today on the issue of\n\nwolves, she senses the ranchers feel the same in connection with wolves\n\nand the problems created. The solution is believed to be state\n\nmanagement. However, states cannot afford to bear the costs of the\n\nmanagement.\n\nStan Boyd, Idaho Wool Growers Association, reported, as a member of the\n\ncommittee drafting the state wolf management plan, there has been no\n\nactivity by the committee since the adoption of the plan last legislative\n\nsession. He expressed concern about the delay in delisting and the\n\nresultant problems experienced within the state.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Schildwachter stated the three state ten\n\npack each is not a rule or a federal regulation, but could be the basis for\n\nlitigation because it is in the federal recovery. One of the confusing areas\n\nof the Endangered Species Act is there is no section in the law that\n\nspecifically sets out recovery and getting species off the list. The recovery\n\nplans are written but with the knowledge they might not have the force and\n\neffect of federal regulation. When the plan was written in 1987 it sets\n\nforth the 10-10-10 in three states as the recovery goal. As the technical\n\nunderstanding of wolves has developed, the recovery goal was changed to\n\nreflect thirty within the three states. Today there are ten or more official\n\npacks in each of the three states. OSC intends to have as many of the\n\npossible issues resolved before litigation to minimize the legal delay. The\n\nobject is to meet all the possible scenarios proposed by the environmental\n\ngroups in the delisting process. He informed the Committee the last\n\noriginal wolf to be reintroduced in the Yellowstone project has been killed\n\nby the other wolves, probably his own offspring. Some people in the\n\nenvironmental industry realize the overall benefit, for the credibility of\n\nESA and the effectiveness of wolf conservation, that delisting must take\n\nplace. Commitment delays by the National Fish and Wildlife Service and\n\nthe Department of Interior to delist is centered on the biological aspects.\n\nThey cannot propose delisting until Montana and Wyoming have their\n\nregulatory mechanisms in place. The official proposal to delist was\n\nscheduled for this year, but will be delayed because of the situations in\n\nMontana and Wyoming. The decision on when Idaho would have a\n\nregulated hunting season on wolves will be made based on biological and\n\nprofessional information. He noted the difficulty will be in counting\n\nwolves. Additionally, there is not a model depicting the interaction\n\nbetween wolves and ungulates will be so the target harvest will be an\n\nunknown. The decision will be difficult, but will be made the same as\n\nwith any other hunted species. Wolf harvest will need to be part of the\n\nequation.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Sarah Bigger, representating Senator\n\nMike Crapo, reassured the committee the state has been quite vocal in the\n\nrequest for management funding because of the fiscal impacts to the states\n\nbecause of the Endangered Species Act. The wolf appropriation had\n\nproceeded through the Senate and is now awaiting the processing of the\n\nOmnibus Bill. Senator Crapo is chairman of the federal subcommittee on\n\nfisheries, wildlife and water and will endeavor to make changes to ESA.\n\nThe economic impact to the rural communities has been significant.\n\nSchildwachter stated the federal request is for $2.4 million. $l.3 million to\n\nthe Department of Agriculture for wildlife services and $1.1 million to on\n\nthe ground management of wolves in cooperative programs with the\n\nfederal government and Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nSteve Huffaker, Director, Department of Fish and Game, stated the\n\nWyoming Director of Fish and Game is now the Executive Director of the\n\nInternational Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies in Washington,\n\nD.C. He noted an interim director has been appointed during the national\n\nsearch. The search has been completed, but there is now a change in\n\nGovernors and there will be two new Fish and Game Commissioners.\n\nAdditionally, Wyoming Legislature would have an affect on this scenario.\n\nHe stated the Commission and Department are very concerned about the\n\nimpact of wolves on big game. Some of the outfitters have reported the\n\nsituation is better than in previous years. Biologically the wolves are\n\npreying predominately on calf elk. National wolf experts report that\n\nwolves are naturally lazy and will take the easiest animal to catch. Winter\n\nconditions also affect what animals are taken by the wolves. The orderly\n\ntransition to state management is necessary to assure the management of\n\nwolves in the back country. The intent of the reintroduction program was\n\ngame in the wilderness were there to provide forage for the reintroduced\n\nwolf population.\n\nSchildwachter reported the Governor has issued an invitation to Chairman\n\nPenney of the Nez Perce Tribe to facilitate the transition to state\n\nmanagement of the wolves and what significant role would be the Tribe’s.\n\nThe Tribe is currently under contract with the federal government and\n\nhave hired staff, acquired equipment and knowledge. They hope to\n\ncontinue to participate in the management. Negotiations are in the\n\npreliminary stages.\n\nChairman Noh inquired of the status of the $300,000 contract for killing\n\ncoyotes. Huffaker reported the signed copy of the contract was sent to\n\nJohn Graham, the successful bidder on the project, on December 18.\n\nGraham now indicates he does not intend to sign the contract. He has\n\ndecided the controversy and several technical issues were of concern to\n\nhim and would affect the successful completion of the project. The State\n\nPurchasing Division has informed the Commission of subsequent\n\nprocedures: awarding the same contract to the second bidder; cancel the\n\ncontract; or renegotiate a new contract of a similar nature. The\n\nCommission make its decision shortly.\n\nUpon inquiry from Senator Cameron, Huffaker stated Graham’s list of\n\nconcerns was extensive. One item was the disposition of coyotes and\n\nwhether the carcasses would need to be hauled into Idaho Falls during\n\nbusiness hours. Huffaker stated they could negotiate minor points such as\n\nthe carcass disposal. However, there were a number of other issues\n\ninvolving the public, news media and department regarding the project.\n\nGraham indicated he did not want to work in that kind of public scrutiny.\n\nMinor points of the contract are negotiable as long as it did not change the\n\nnature of the contract.\n\nSenator Schroeder noted there has been a significant increase in the price\n\nof coyote pelts over the past year.\n\nSenator Cameron inquired about specifics of the contract. Huffaker stated\n\nthe contract required bidders to provide the carcasses to the Department\n\nfor disposal in facilities provided by the Department. The intent was to\n\nascertain a body count on number of killed coyotes and the time of year\n\nthat they were taken. Additionally, the Department would dispose of them\n\nin an area out of public view. Senator Cameron expressed concern the\n\nrequirement would cause more problems than benefit and should be a\n\nbetter way for the Department to determine how many coyotes were killed\n\nand allow the trapper to maintain the carcass and reduce the price in the\n\ncontract and not create a public spectacle. He asked why the Department\n\nchose to follow that line. Huffaker at the time the specifications for the\n\ncontract were released, the Department was getting sharp and direct\n\ncriticism with a demand for accountability for the expenditure of funds for\n\nkilling coyotes, along with environmental, conservation concerns. Once\n\nthe specifications for the contract were released, State Purchasing Rules\n\nprohibit changing the contract. Huffaker stated Graham brought his\n\nconcerns forward in the final phase of the contract process. Graham was\n\ninformed by State Purchasing that the contract could not be changed at\n\nthat time. Graham then accepted the contract as had been specified.\n\nSenator Cameron stated a number of the Commissioners intended on\n\nremoving turning in the carcasses as a provision of the contract. Huffaker\n\nstated he was not satisfied with the way the whole process has transpired.\n\nChairman Noh stated the Committee was fortunate that JFAC chose not to\n\nbring the $300,000 major policy issue to the Committee before JFAC\n\nmade the decision to go forward with the contract.\n\nSenator Burtenshaw stated his concern the length of time for contract\n\nnegotiations. Huffaker stated if the Commission chooses to issue new\n\nspecifications it should not take a year, but would be dependent upon those\n\ninterested in doing the project. Huffaker stated he did not know about the\n\nprovision in the budget until he heard it read in JFAC meeting.\n\nImmediately upon hearing about it, he contact Senator Hawkins. He\n\ninformed Senator Hawkins it would be much easier to accomplish this\n\ntype of a project if the Department had the ability to hire a trapper and pay\n\nhis expenses instead of a contract. He noted the state contracting process\n\nis tedious and specific. Once the decision was made that it had to be a\n\ncontract, the Department and Commission did not have much choice.\n\nSenator Burtenshaw stated several Senators have been trying to get that\n\nthing going for five or six years for the Department to do this project and\n\ngot called out every time. Huffaker stated he was not aware that was what\n\nwas specifically desired. His knowledge of the proposed project started\n\nlast February.\n\nSenator Burtenshaw commented the Department had studies on fish and\n\nwildlife, but cannot seem to get this. Around the Idaho Falls area was the\n\narea to prove that this thing could work. Some Senators went up and saw\n\nwhat Graham does and reported it works. They felt if they could get one\n\ntime; one program they could evaluate the program. He stated the\n\nprogram was important as the wolf program, because the deer population\n\nthere has virtually disappeared.\n\nThere being no further matters to come before the Committee, the meeting\n\nwas adjourned at 2:55 p.m.\n\nThe meeting was called to order by Chairman Noh at 1:35 p.m.\n\nMotion by Senator Pearce to approve the minutes of January 8, 2003, and\n\nJanuary 13, 2003; seconded by Senator Schroeder. Motion carried.\n\nAlex Irby, Chairman, Idaho Fish and Game Commission, introduced the\n\nmembers of the Commission in attendance: John Burns, Dr. Fred Wood,\n\nMarcus Gibbs, Nancy Hadley, John Watts; Director Steve Huffaker, and\n\nRoger Fuhrman.\n\nMarcus Gibbs stated he was proud to be reappointed to the Commission.\n\nHe informed the Committee of his personal background and operation of a\n\nseed potato farm with his son, the third generation. Gibbs is appreciative\n\nof his family’s support and assistance in order for him to be active in the\n\ncommunity and state. He stated the Department is in the best shape it has\n\nbeen in the past three and one-half years. He noted the director’s\n\nknowledge and abilities have improved the Department’s operations and\n\nhelped to curtail controversy.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Gibbs stated he does not favor dam\n\nbreaching. There are ways to restore the salmon and still have fish runs\n\nwith the dams intact.\n\nUpon further inquiry, Gibbs stated he considered himself an independent\n\nand does not truly belong to any political party. He stated in his area if he\n\nwere to run for political office he would register as a Republican in order\n\nto win. He noted he has been approached by the Democratic and\n\nRepublican party to run for County Commissioner. His Mother still has a\n\n“Church for Idaho” sign on her mailbox. Politically he supports individuals from both parties.\n\nUpon motion, seconded and carried during the Committee\n\nmeeting of Friday, February 7, 2003, the following excerpt\n\nis inserted into the committee minutes.\n\nVerbatim transcript from Senate Resources and\n\nEnvironment Committee meeting of January 17, 2003,\n\nRoom 433.\n\nExcerpt from testimony of Marcus Gibbs reappointment\n\nappearance before the Committee for confirmation:\n\nSenator Williams: I see you are an independent on your\n\npiece of paper. Is that still intact?\n\nChairman Noh: Yes, Chairman, that’s the party affiliation\n\nor lack thereof.\n\nGibbs: Senator Williams, I was asked that question three\n\nyears ago. I am slightly more prepared today to answer\n\ntoday than I was three years go. I am probably still and\n\nindependent. I am also a realist and know if I am seeking\n\noffice in Caribou County or in Legislative District 31, I\n\nwould probably run as a republican, if I had to chose. In\n\nthe last general election before I was appointed to this\n\nposition, I was approached by both the Democratic party\n\nand the Republican party to run for county commissioner.\n\nAnd I still have the good fortune of having a Mother who\n\nlives next door to me and she still has a “Church for Idaho”\n\nsign on her mailbox. So…. (Laughter.) I will testify to that.\n\nPolitically, I have supported people from both parties.\n\nSenator Schroeder noted in Latah County there are several meat cutters,\n\nwho cut the meat from deer and elk carcasses. He expressed concern\n\nwhether hunters from other states, especially Washington, would be able\n\nto bring their game into Idaho to be processed by meat cutters. Gibbs\n\nstated the Commission has implemented an information brochure on\n\nchronic wasting disease. The Commission’s recommendation is to leave\n\nas much of the carcass as possible where it is shot. There is a standing ban\n\non importation of live animals to Idaho. Hunters are allowed to transport\n\ngame to and from the neighboring states. He noted it was not an\n\ninsurmountable problem as long as the those carcasses are properly\n\ndisposed of by meat processors. He noted the regulation is not restrictive\n\nat this time.\n\nSenator Kennedy stated that some of the deer and elk in Elmore County\n\nare being fed in the winter time by the Department and should this be\n\ndone? Gibbs responded he supports feeding deer and elk in emergencies.\n\nThe Commission has a policy statement which does not support feeding\n\nexcept in emergency situations. The long term solution is winter habitat\n\nand winter range. One of the problems is the encroachment of housing\n\ndevelopments on winter range. Upon further inquiry, Gibbs stated that\n\nwhen people move into these areas, they should adjust their lifestyles to\n\naccommodate the game animals as the animals were there before the\n\nencroachment. Gibbs stated winter feeding should be used as a one time\n\nsolution. Alternatives would be relocation and harvest. He noted there are\n\nanimals traveling over two and three management zones from winter to\n\nsummer range so there is not necessarily a direct correlation between range\n\nand wintering. He thinks the policy of the Commission should remain\n\nintact and the Department have the opportunity to feed under extreme\n\nemergency conditions as outlined in the policy. He stated if animals are\n\nfed three consecutive years in a given area, a feed cycle begins and\n\nongoing feeding would be necessary. Not all districts in the state have a\n\nwinter feeding advisory Committee. Upon inquiry, Gibbs stated some\n\nmembership on the winter feeding advisory Committee should be local.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee should be comprised of people with diverse\n\ninterests so there is a broad prospective.\n\nSenator Kennedy inquired about a monthly publication entitled “Contact.”\n\nContact is a publication of the Department of Fish and Game. On page\n\nthree of the November 15, 2002, issue states: “Fish and Game will also\n\nwork towards eliminating the feeding of wild deer and elk because\n\nconcentration of animals could cause the spread of undetected chronic\n\nwasting disease. Winter feeding operations tend to draw animals together\n\nfrom more than one herd area allowing diseases to be carried back into\n\nwidely scattered populations that would otherwise rarely mix.” Gibbs\n\nstated the quote is consistent with the policy criteria of the Commission.\n\nSenator Kennedy requested Committee time be set aside to delve into\n\nthese matters more specifically.\n\nUpon inquiry from Senator Pearce, Gibbs stated the Commission has a\n\npredator policy developed about one and one-half years ago. The policy\n\naddresses predator-prey relationships. Currently the deer herd in eastern\n\nIdaho is suffering dramatically. The Department and sportsmen are\n\ncurrently conducting meetings, gathering recommendations. The\n\ncommission will review the policy based on the information gathered.\n\nIn response to an inquiry, Gibbs stated that he was an independent to\n\nSenator Stennett’s inquiry if there was an attachment to the official oath\n\nrequesting a declaration of political affiliation. He supports Democrats\n\nand Republicans, but consider himself an independent.\n\nUpon inquiry of proposed legislation pending in the Idaho House of\n\nRepresentatives prohibiting landowners from feeding wildlife, Gibbs\n\nstated he had no knowledge of the legislation. He stated one of the\n\nproblems faced by the Commission is the unauthorized feeding of game\n\nanimals in the winter. Gibbs stated that from a management standpoint, he\n\nis opposed to allowing the feeding of game on private ground, but from an\n\nenforcement standpoint, the issue is private property rights. He noted the\n\nproblem is very difficult for the Department to handle.\n\nUpon inquiry from Senator Stennett, Gibbs stated the Department of Fish\n\nand Game does not control private elk ranches; that is under the\n\njurisdiction of the Idaho Department of Agriculture. Currently the director\n\nof the Department has a policy prohibiting the importation of deer or elk\n\ninto Idaho because the chronic waste disease. He noted private deer/elk\n\nranches in Idaho are monitored for the disease. The Commission does not\n\ncurrently have a policy statement, regulation or projected costs on chronic\n\nwaste disease. He noted Wyoming and Colorado have been addressing\n\nthis problem since the early 1960’s and they still have deer hunting\n\nopportunities where the disease has been diagnosed. Those states still sell\n\nall the hunting permits available. Chronic waste disease at this time is a\n\nmanagement problem.\n\nSenator Cameron noted Idaho representatives to the Northwest Power\n\nPlanning Council were recently able to negotiate reducing the amount of\n\nwater sent down stream. Gibbs stated the Commission has not addressed\n\nthis issue, but as a member of the Last Chance Canal Company, he is not\n\nsupportive of water leaving the state unless on the basis of willing buyer-willing seller and not adversely affecting the water rights within the state.\n\nSarah Braasch, Idaho Cattle Association, noted the organization’s support\n\nof Gibbs’ reappointment to the Fish and Game Commission. He brings the\n\nperspective of a landowner to the Commission and understands the\n\nwildlife habitat provided by farmers and ranchers.\n\nJim Hagedorn, Viola, Idaho, a member of Concerned Sportsmen of Idaho,\n\nurged the Committee’s endorsement of Gibbs because he is very open and\n\ngood to communicate with.\n\nJohn Watts, putting his lobbyist identification badge in his pocket,\n\ninformed the Committee of his background. He has a long family history\n\nof hunting and respect for the land, wildlife and hunting ethics. His\n\nbiographic statement sets out his membership and activities with many\n\norganizations. He noted the activities have been most informative and\n\neducational. His educational background is set forth in the attached\n\nbiographical statement. He has made it a career to be involved in the\n\npublic sector on human service, natural resource and education issues. He\n\nnoted he is a partner in a private governmental affairs- political consulting,\n\nphilanthropic fund raising firm in Boise. One of these areas is lobbying.\n\nHe no longer represents the Outfitters and Guides Association because of\n\nthe potential for a conflict of interest with his membership on the Fish and\n\nGame Commission. He stated it is a privilege and honor to be asked to\n\nserve on the Commission. He now represents the Idaho School Board\n\nAssociation and the Library Association and does not anticipate a conflict\n\nof interest.\n\nChairman Noh noted his conversations with Watts about conflicts of\n\ninterest and found Watts to be willing to handle conflicts of interest openly\n\nand responsibly. Watts stated all lobbyists are required to register with the\n\nSecretary of State and must register for each and every one of their clients.\n\nHe is registered and has been registered since he began his lobbying\n\ncareer. He noted a booklet will be available part way through the session\n\nlisting all the lobbyists. Additionally, the information is available through\n\nthe Secretary of State’s web site.\n\nUpon inquiry from Senator Williams, Watts replied the Commission\n\npolicy is for the rivers to remain in their natural state as much as possible.\n\nEach of the rivers are reviewed and assessed on an individual basis. The\n\nCommission relies upon individuals who have the knowledge and\n\nexpertise of various aspects of the impacts. More specifically, Watts\n\nstated he supports the Commission’s position and attempts to find ways to\n\naugment the return of fish. Habitat improvement, catch ratios,\n\ntransportation alternatives and river flow augmentation. He is open to\n\nalternatives that would keep everyone whole and supports the willing\n\nbuyer – willing seller program. The program must take into consideration\n\nthe farmers, individual water rights and public rights.\n\nUpon inquiry, Watts reported he had a great deal of respect for Idaho’s\n\nmembers on the NWPPC, Danielson and Kempton, and appreciates their\n\nflexibility in making their determinations to keep everyone whole. He\n\nsupports Idaho’s effort to protect its water. Upon additional inquiry, Watts\n\nexpressed concern about access to private and public lands for\n\nhunting/fishing opportunities. He supports a proposal to purchase access.\n\nIt is very difficult for farmers to make a living. As the lands disappear or\n\nare closed for hunting or fishing, the Commission needs to be working for\n\nways to gain access. The Landowner Relationship program is an avenue\n\nto be developed by the Commission. There should be some way to enter\n\ninto an agreement with landowners to purchase access opportunities for\n\nthe general public. Another problem is the purchase of hunting\n\nopportunities through a private and exclusive arrangement, locking out the\n\ngeneral public. There is more pressure on landowners, especially in this\n\narea, because of the population growth resulting in less land, habitat and\n\nmore pressure on the game animals. Watts stated predator control is one\n\nof many tools that must be considered for wildlife. The balance must be\n\ncarefully identified, scientifically and responsibly. He noted, as a\n\npassionate bird hunter, that foxes, skunks, coyotes and feral cats are a\n\nproblem on game birds, but there are other factors, such as the\n\ndiminishment of land, that must be considered.\n\nButch Olson, Middleton, chairman, winter feeding, urged the Committee\n\nto support the appointment of Watts to the Idaho Fish and Game\n\nCommission.\n\nKip Bryson, Pheasants Forever, urged the Committee to support the\n\nappointment of Watts to the Idaho Fish and Game Commission.\n\nHerb Meyr, Mountain Home, urged the Committee’s support of Watts’\n\nappointment.\n\nSteve Goddard, Mountain Home, also asked the Committee’s support of\n\nWatts’ appointment.\n\nJeff Barney, Boise, supports Watts’ appointment to the Commission.\n\nJane Gorsuch, Intermountain Forest Association, recommends the\n\nconfirmation of Watts to the Idaho Fish and Game Commission.\n\nSarah Braasch, Idaho Cattle Association, supports Watts’ appointment.\n\nStan Boyd, Idaho Wool Growers Association, supports Watts’\n\nappointment.\n\nLauren McLean, Idaho Conservation League, recommended the\n\nCommittee support Watts’ confirmation to the Idaho Fish and Game\n\nCommission.\n\nSenator Stennett expressed concern regarding the legality of the Oath of\n\nOffice signed by members of the Fish and Game Commission meeting the\n\nspecifications of the Idaho Code. Additionally, he would like to have a list\n\nof Commission members and their declared political party. This\n\ninformation will be obtained and provided from the Governor’s office.\n\nThere being nothing further to come before the Committee, the meeting\n\nwas adjourned at 3:00 p.m.\n\nThe meeting was called to order by Chairman Noh at 1:35 p.m.\n\nAt the request of Senator Stennett unanimous consent for the gubernatorial\n\nappointments of Marcus Gibbs and John Watts will be held until Wednesday’s\n\nmeeting in order to obtain political affiliation information of the members of\n\nthe Idaho Fish and Game Commission and to correct the Oath of Office by the\n\npending appointees to include political affiliation as provided in the Idaho\n\nCode.\n\nJeff Youtz, Supervisor, Budget and Policy Analysis, Legislative Services\n\nOffice, provided to the Committee, a general fund comparison information\n\nsheet along with a comparison of all funds. The Committee was provided a\n\ncopy of the Legislative Budget Book for the 2003 Session for the Natural\n\nResources Section. These provide the data on two years of actual\n\nexpenditures, the current year appropriations, the 2004 Governor’s\n\nrecommendation, and the change in the Governor’s recommendation for\n\nchanges in 2003 which sets out what the percent change represents. Overall\n\nthe Governor’s general fund budget recommendation is a 2.9 percent increase\n\nover the current year appropriation. There is a temporary hold back, which\n\nhas just expired, which will reduce the 2003 appropriation and general fund by\n\n3.5 percent. In 2003, there would be an actual budget reduction for the current\n\nyear. In 2004, the Governor has also recommended the 3.5 percent reduction\n\nbecome a permanent base reduction for 2004 for affected state agencies.\n\nYoutz noted that K-12 and higher education are exempt from the current year\n\nhold back and from the 2004 base reduction.\n\nYoutz explained the Department of Parks and Recreation budget as set forth\n\non page 4-51 in the Natural Resources Budget book. There are three major\n\nappropriated programs in DPR. There were four, but there was a\n\nreorganization process last year. About twenty-five to thirty percent of\n\ngeneral funds are DPR’s budget. The negative supplemental (the budget\n\nreduction), is $301,800 for DPR. He noted there is some flexibility to allow\n\nfor transfers between programs. Vehicle replacement is an ongoing\n\nreplacement expenditure. He noted the Department of Fish and Game has a\n\ndifferent situation because of the fleet management system they initiated in\n\nrecent years. Upon inquiry, Youtz noted the $400,000 is for the acquisition of\n\nBillingsley Creek State Park along with $80,000 from the University of Idaho,\n\nwhich is the total bonding cost of $480,000. There is a cooperative\n\nunderstanding between the University of Idaho and the Department of Parks\n\nand Recreation for this project. After determining the base budget,\n\ninflationary figures are added. This year there is an estimated fourteen percent\n\ninflation for personnel costs, mostly health insurance. The Governor has\n\nrecommended covering both the employee and employer portion of the health\n\ninsurance increase. The Governor is recommending this in lieu of salary\n\nincreases as he does not want state employee salaries to go backwards because\n\nof the increase in health insurance costs. Last year not enough was budgeted\n\nso the benefit package was modified. The fourteen percent increase is only an\n\nestimate. The contract will not be signed with Blue Shield until April.\n\nThe inflationary adjustments allowed state agencies to request an inflationary\n\nincrease of 2.4 percent. The Governor did not include inflationary amounts\n\nfor state agency budgets other Medicaid and higher education budgets.\n\nReplacement items are the reinstatement of equipment needs. DPR has\n\nmaintenance projects reflected in replacement items. Youtz noted last year\n\nthere were no funds for replacement items. The Governor has recommended\n\nspending authority for DPR’s dedicated funds which contains $2,300,000 for\n\nequipment replacement and park maintenance projects.\n\nFTP represents full time personnel. Seasonal positions are not reflected in\n\nFTP, unless there are permanent part-time positions which are shown within\n\nthe FTP figure. He noted seasonal positions do not show as FTP. Seasonal\n\npositions are shown in the personnel costs amount. There are 158.25 FTP for\n\nDPR. The budget for DPR was reduced five percent in FTPs last year. There\n\nwill be an additional 3.5 percent reduction this year, which is reflected by\n\n17,000 seasonal man hours. Collignon noted seasonal employees each work\n\napproximately 500 hours per year. Youtz noted the elderly volunteers are\n\ngenerally camp ground hosts. Collignon noted generally DPR hires about 300\n\nseasonal employees. The volunteer program contains 3,500 hours.\n\nThe Governor does recommend DPR’s line item budget for the Eagle Island\n\nState Park. Negotiations with the City of Eagle for the operation of the park\n\nwere unsuccessful because the city did not have the resources. He noted the\n\nEagle Island budget item is the only general fund enhancement in DPR\n\nbudget.\n\nYoutz noted the DPR Board has made a conscious effort that capital\n\ninvestments be revenue generating. The yurt program and small cabin\n\nprogram are two successful examples.\n\nYoutz stated JFAC will be looking at further reductions depending upon the\n\noutcome of the Governor’s proposed sales tax increase. Most of the sales tax\n\nproposal replaces the $190,000,000 (one-time general funds) supporting the\n\nbudget this year which will not be available for 2004. The proposed effective\n\ndate of the sales tax increase is May 1, 2003. It is projected to raise\n\n$18,000,000 for the current fiscal year. Therefore, the budget stabilization\n\nfund would not need to be used. The negative supplemental will be needed\n\nregardless of the sales tax increase. The state is required to have a balanced\n\nbudget by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nRay Houston, Analyst, Budget and Policy Analysis, Legislative Services\n\nOffice, explained the Department of Environmental Quality’s budget as\n\nreflected in the attached information. He noted the DEQ’s budget is forty\n\npercent general funds, twenty percent federal funds, and twenty percent\n\ndedicated with five different programs. His oral presentation reflected the\n\ninformation set out in the Idaho Legislative Budget Book. Non-cognizable\n\nfunding is a state statute requiring the funds were not known at the time the\n\nbudget was set by the Legislature and the funds are not state funds.\n\nUpon inquiry, Steve Allred, Director, Department of Environmental Quality,\n\nsaid there are funds in DEQ’s budget for ongoing water pollution control\n\nwhich comes from $4,500,000 sales tax funds to the water pollution control\n\nfund.\n\nHouston further explained DEQ’s budget noting the Department has been\n\nreorganized and is requesting an additional 2 FTPs for programming. The\n\nnew organizational chart is shown on page 4-9. The well-defined details of\n\nthe budget are set forth in the attached Legislative Budget Book.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Allred stated the Department is in a status\n\nquo position and will be able to continue providing its statutory\n\nresponsibilities.\n\nThere being no further matters to come before the Committee, the meeting\n\nwas adjourned at 3:00 P.M.\n\nMotion by Senator Burtenshaw to confirm the gubernatorial reappointment\n\nof Marcus Gibbs to the Fish and Game Commission; seconded by Senator\n\nWilliams.\n\nSubstitute motion by Senator Stennett to not confirm the gubernatorial\n\nreappointment of Marcus Gibbs to the Fish and Game Commission\n\nbecause of the Idaho Code unique requirement for Fish and Game\n\nCommissioners to declare a political party on their Oath of Office\n\nstatement; seconded by Senator Kennedy. He noted Gibbs is doing a fine\n\njob, but he is serving illegally on the Commission. The Secretary of\n\nState’s office reported the political parties in the state of Idaho are:\n\nRepublican, Democratic, Constitutional, National Law, and Libertarian.\n\nThere is not an independent party recognized in the state of Idaho. There\n\nare now four Republicans sitting on the Commission and three\n\nindependents. He stated the independents violate the code requirements.\n\nCommittee discussion noted the intention of the initiative establishing the\n\nCommission was not to disenfranchise the majority of the citizens of\n\nIdaho, who don’t belong to any political party, from representing those\n\ninterests on the Commission. One way to avoid the problem would be the\n\ndrafting of a different oath with different language setting forth\n\nmembership in a specific political party or have no party affiliation.\n\nSenator Stennett requested a roll call vote on the substitute motion.\n\nRoll call vote on substitute motion:\n\nAyes: Kennedy and Stennett\n\nNays: Brandt, Burtenshaw, Cameron, Little, Pearce, Schroeder, Williams\n\nand Noh\n\nSubstitution motion failed.\n\nRoll call vote on original motion:\n\nAyes: Brandt, Burtenshaw, Cameron, Little, Pearce, Schroeder, Williams\n\nand Noh\n\nNays: Kennedy and Stennett\n\nOriginal motion carried.\n\nMotion by Senator Schroeder to approve the gubernatorial appointment of\n\nJohn Watts to the Fish and Game Commission; seconded by Senator\n\nStennett. Motion carried on voice vote.\n\nPro Tem Geddes will be floor sponsor for Gibbs and Senator Little will be\n\nfloor sponsor for Watts.\n\nChairman Noh informed the Committee concerning a letter sent to the\n\nBureau of Reclamation last spring concerning the relicensing of the Lucky\n\nPeak Reservoir and the establishment of a minimum stream flow on that\n\nreach of the Boise River. The Director of DPR has requested the letter be\n\nofficially withdrawn from the record.\n\nRick Collignon, Director, Department of Parks and Recreation, provided\n\nhandouts to the Committee (attached) setting forth an overview of the\n\nstatus of projects and programs. An additional handout (attached)\n\nprovided the Committee with statistics pertaining to the Department’s\n\nvarious programs along with budget information. He noted the Legislative\n\nIntent for the Department was very broad which has resulted in a wide\n\nvariety of projects and programs. The Old Mission State Park, which sets\n\non Trust Land under management of the Department of Interior along with\n\nthe Nez Perce and Coeur d’Alene Tribes. Mesa Falls is a cooperative\n\nproject with the U.S. Forest Service. Lucky Peak is a heavily used boating\n\nand recreational park. Hells Gate on the Lower Snake River and Harriman\n\nState Park are two additional parks. The Department is involved in\n\nsnowmobile trails, public campsites, trails on public lands, lakes and\n\nrivers, especially boatable waters. The focus of the Department is to\n\noperation a state-wide system of programs which focus on expanding\n\nopportunities for the citizens. He noted the Department is governed by a\n\nsix-member Board appointed by the Governor. There are two trusts under\n\nthe Department: a trust for outdoor recreation camping, which is an\n\nunfunded trust, but established under Governor Batt’s administration to\n\nenable the Department to work with local, state and federal entities. The\n\nother trust is a park land trust which is comprised of revenues from timber\n\nmanagement, grazing or resource management. These funds are\n\nreinvested in resource management or additional lands. He noted the\n\nDepartment administers the Safe Boating Act through the counties known\n\nas the State Vessel Registration Account. Additionally, the recreational\n\nvehicle program is under the Department and generates about $3,000,000\n\nannually. The Sawtooth National Recreational Area mountain goat license\n\nplate supports improvements in that recreational area. Last year the\n\nLegislature created a new program, the cut-throat trout license plate,\n\nwhich addresses a non-motoring program for anglers, which is coordinated\n\nwith the Department of Fish and Game. Collignon noted the Park n’Ski\n\nprogram which provides parking for cross country skiers. The funds are\n\nutilized by county and state highways transportation programs to remove\n\nthe snow for parking. He noted the Department is also responsible for the\n\nmanagement of endangered plants. There is proposed legislation this\n\nsession for changes in that responsibility. The Department also manages\n\nthree federal programs: the Land, Water, Conservation Fund, which brings\n\nseveral million dollars of federal funds into the state for projects by state\n\nand local governments; the Coast Guard Boating Safety Act is an\n\nreimbursement for federal gas taxes; and the Recreational Trails, a federal\n\nprogram, with funds also from federal gas taxes.\n\nCollignon noted Idaho, with a tremendous amount of public land, has\n\nmany active partners in parks and recreation services and facilities. The\n\nDepartment attempts to focus on public access for recreational interests.\n\nSome of the trends in Idaho are reflected by the population growth with\n\ninterests in the state’s recreational opportunities. The recreational usage\n\nindicates heavy use by families. Additionally, the education of all citizens\n\non the values and responsible use of the lands is an important program of\n\nthe Department. Economic development is vital to the rural economies in\n\nthe shifts from resource based economy to recreation and tourism. The\n\nrural area community leaders are seeking assistance from the Department\n\nin their economic development endeavors.\n\nCollignon noted the 27 state parks are managed under partnership\n\nagreements with the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management,\n\nForest Service, Corps of Engineers, Department of Lands, Department of\n\nFish and Game, and counties and cities. There are 8,000 public campsites\n\nin the state. This was a record year for use of the state parks. It was a\n\ntough year on the budget, but there was good public use. The registration\n\nof recreational toys is a significant part of the Department’s activities.\n\nOne out of every three voters in the state has some kind of recreational\n\ntoy. This does not take into account other recreational items that do not\n\nrequire registration. The general funds to the Department help in\n\nmaintaining the base line accountability so the facilities are available for\n\nall citizens. He noted there are nine fund sources: general revenue fund,\n\nparks and recreation fund, recreational fuels fund, parks and recreation\n\nregistration fund, public recreation fund, petroleum price violation fund,\n\npark and recreation expendable trust fund, federal grants and indirect cost\n\nrecoveries.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Collignon stated 36 additional camp\n\ncabins will be added, which will generate additional revenue. These\n\ncabins have no restrooms, showers or kitchen facilities, but are sleeping\n\nrooms only. The Department is not going into the resort or hotel/motel\n\nbusiness. There is some competition with private campgrounds, but the\n\nDepartment takes the economic area into consideration. The yurts are\n\nlocated in back country areas with the exception of some at Winchester\n\nand Ponderosa. The income from yurt rentals pays for the costs associated\n\nwith the cross country ski program. The only concessionaire in the park\n\nsystem now is jet ski rentals at Spring Shores at Lucky Peak. He noted\n\nthere is a proposal for a marina at Lake Cascade, but will not be supported\n\nunless there can be sustained revenue from the investment.\n\nUpon inquiry about ATV’s, Collignon stated there is no difference in the\n\nregistration of a motor bike and trail bike which makes tracking difficult.\n\nAs of December 1, there is 29,448 ATVs in Idaho, which is a growth of\n\nseventeen percent in the past year. However, the sales tax figures for\n\nATVs indicate 44,000 sold by dealers in the state. The enforcement in\n\nconnection with ATVs has required the Department to re-evaluate its role.\n\nIn the past when there has been a concentration of use, more trail heads\n\nwere created to disperse the use which enables self-governing actions.\n\nThe problem is when there is a concentration of use in one area without\n\nthe ability to develop additional areas. Then the solution becomes a\n\nmanagement issue.\n\nChairman Noh noted there will a joint committee hearing on Tuesday,\n\nJanuary 28, at 6:30 p.m. in the Gold Room on this issue. Invitations have\n\nbeen sent to all the state and federal agencies involved in this process and\n\nto the known organizations. Chairman Noh asked if there were any others\n\nthat should be contacted and encouraged the invitation of others.\n\nUpon inquiry, Collignon stated there is not an state park in eastern Idaho\n\nbetween Harriman and Bear Lake. Because of the population in that area,\n\nthe department is looking for a site. The budget expenditure request is to\n\nset aside some funds for that purpose.\n\nRay Houston, Analyst, Budget and Policy Analysis, Legislative Services,\n\ncontinued his review of natural resource budgets, focusing on the\n\nDepartment of Water Resources. He recapped the information set out in\n\nthe 2003 Legislative Budget Book for the Natural Resources Section. A\n\ncopy is attached to the minutes of the past three committee meetings. He\n\nnoted the department is divided in five major budget programs. The hold\n\nback for the Department includes $118,100 from Planning and Technical\n\nServices, $150,600 from Water Management and $83,400 from the Snake\n\nRiver Basin Adjudication. $83,400 was transferred to the adjudication\n\naccount from the Water Pollution Control fund to free general fund costs.\n\nHe noted there is federal funding available for flood plain mapping. The\n\ndepartment is successfully continuing a multi-year project to adjust the\n\ncalibration the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer model because of conjunctive\n\nmanagement issues in surface and ground water. This project is\n\nundertaken in conjunction with the University of Idaho. Water District #1,\n\nand the U.S. Geological Survey Department. Funding is through the state\n\ngeneral fund, as well as U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Reclamation,\n\nNASA, and Idaho Power.\n\nThere are four instream flow water rights yet to be adjudicated in the\n\nSRBA. State general fund support for the SRBA is reduced by $96,500\n\nvia a fund shift resulting in a net general fund request of $512,000. The\n\nGovernor has recommended $608,500 be funded with Water Pollution\n\nControl Funds rather than state general funds. The organizational chart of\n\nthe Department is included in the budget booklet. There are currently no\n\nshared time (group) positions within the Department.\n\nUpon inquiry, Dreher explained the projected costs of the SRBA have\n\nchanged significantly since the program was undertaken. The Department\n\nis continuing to pursue legislation in respect to payment of federal claim\n\nfees as a matter of equity.\n\nIn regard to the Silver Creek violation, Dreher stated the water users and\n\nthe water master, not in his official capacity, but as an agent for the water\n\nusers, incorrectly assumed that a permit was no longer needed. Areas\n\nalong a leaking dike were filled in which resulted in draining thousands of\n\nacres of wetlands along Silver Creek. Dreher and Clive Strong, Deputy\n\nAttorney General, attempted to intervene in the situation. Negotiations\n\nwith the federal attorney, Mark Ryan, for EPA resulted in having the water\n\nusers voluntarily resolve by doing the restoration work. The voluntary\n\nrestoration work was to be used as leverage for the reduction of the\n\npenalty. However, the voluntary efforts were contingent upon an\n\nagreement that there would be no penalty. EPA could not do that and the\n\nend result was that the water users had to do the work anyway and still\n\nmay face a $l40,000 penalty fee.\n\nDreher noted there was a similar situation in connection with the Great\n\nFeeder, a channel of the South Fork of the Snake River in the upper reach\n\nof the Snake River Basin, used to convey irrigation water. The violation\n\nin that area was by channeling a quarter mile of the river and dumped all\n\nthe soil into the wetlands. He noted this was a significant violation.\n\nBoth of these violations are tied to budget reductions in connection with\n\nthe Stream Channel Protection Act along with cooperative work with the\n\nCorps of Engineers and other wet lands programs.\n\nThere are a total of 206 employees within the Department. Twenty-six\n\nemployees are temporary part-time employees which are hired on a\n\nseasonal basis to do field work. The 26 are not included in the total.\n\nAdditionally, there are two positions on the Governor’s staff, which are\n\nnot included in the total count. The 8 Water Resource Board members are\n\nincluded in the 206 FTPs. He noted the Water Resources Board for DWR\n\nis within the Department budget, but not the governing entity for the\n\nDepartment. Dreher stated there are 170 positions filled with 11 vacant.\n\nSenator Stennett inquired why the stream channel protection program was\n\neliminated over the alternative fuel program. Dreher noted the alternative\n\nfuel program is almost totally funded by federal funds that must be used\n\nfor energy conservation, alternative fuel efforts or from funds through the\n\nNorthwest Energy Alliance, which have to be used for energy\n\nconservation. The stream channel protection program is important, but is\n\na small part of the work of DWR.\n\nSenator Schroeder inquired as to the status of the Palouse aquifer study of\n\nNorth Idaho. It was not included in the budget, but it is on the list of\n\npriority aquifer studies. He noted the Palouse and Rathdrum studies are\n\ntied in terms of importance. Dreher stated that applying for a water right\n\nis different from actually obtaining a water right.\n\nThe meeting was called to order by Chairman Noh at 1:40 p.m.\n\nChairman Noh introduced Dick Smith, Forest Supervisor, Boise National\n\nForest to the Committee. Smith then introduced to the Committee, the\n\nDeputy Forest Supervisor Suzanne Rainville, who has been Acting\n\nSupervisor until Smith’s arrival last Monday. Smith informed the\n\nCommittee of his educational and professional background, noting he\n\nreceived his master’s in forest ecology from the University of Idaho. He\n\ncomes to the Boise National Forest from the Washington, D. C. office for\n\npolicy analysis for the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nDue to the decline in timber sales, Senator Larry Craig’s legislation\n\nproposing payment stabilization to counties has provided the counties with\n\ntwo payment options. He noted Idaho counties have chosen the new\n\nsystem of payment based on the high three year payment average.\n\nSmith noted the establishment of a fifteen-member advisory committee\n\ncomposed of five representatives from user groups, five representatives\n\nfrom political entities, and five representatives from environmental groups.\n\nHe noted the Southwest Idaho group is now operating and working\n\ntowards a consensus agreements.\n\nThe proposed changes in the National Fire Plan will affect all aspects and\n\nall users. Smith said the State of Idaho is faced with the same changes and\n\naffects.\n\nThe Boise National Forest Management Plan revision should be completed\n\nin July, as the plan is currently in the consulting process with other federal\n\nregulatory agencies.\n\nUpon Senator Williams inquiry concerning the fuel loads in the forests,\n\nSmith stated management of the fuels needs to be done by all parties. The\n\nchallenge is the determination of how, when and where, but there is a\n\nconsensus concerning the problem. Senator Williams stated his area of\n\nthe state is experiencing more and more problems in regards to the use of\n\nall terrain vehicles on public and private lands. Chairman Noh noted there\n\nwill be a hearing by the Senate and House Resource Committees on\n\nTuesday, January 28, 6:30 p.m. on this issue. Smith stated that two\n\nprimary issues in the west are the fuels issue and access to public lands.\n\nSenator Little expressed concern for the loss of 320 jobs in his area\n\nbecause of lumber mill closures. He noted there is not a sawmill adjacent\n\nto the Boise National Forest. Senator Little inquired if the new forest plan\n\nprovides for reasonable allowable cuts to enable a sawmill to open.\n\nSmith stated he had not had an opportunity to review the Boise National\n\nForest’s new plan. He did note the plan does provide for active\n\nmanagement with timber and grazing components. The levels are not the\n\nsame as they were fifteen years ago. He noted only one-third of forest\n\nlands are being cut now compared to l989. The Chief of the Forest\n\nService states that where it is appropriate, trees should be cut. Senator\n\nLittle noted the loggers are gone now and the income production for\n\nschools has decreased. Little inquired about who is representing the\n\ntimber industry now that the loggers are gone? Little urged Smith, in his\n\nreview of the Boise National Forest plan, to ascertain that timber and\n\ngrazing components are carefully considered.\n\nRay Houston, Analyst, Budget and Policy Analysis, Legislative Services\n\nOffice, continued his presentation to the Committee on budgets. He noted\n\nthe Department of Lands budget begins on page 4-35 of the Natural\n\nResources Section. Seventy-two percent of the 2003 appropriation is\n\ndedicated funds; fourteen percent general funds; and fourteen percent\n\nfederal funds. In the federal funds for 2003, there is a big increase to\n\n$4,500,000, a $3,000,000 increase, which represents funds provided to the\n\nDepartment by JFAC for spending authority for federal fire grants.\n\nAdditionally, the $23,700,000 is comprised of endowment funds. Six\n\nmillion, two hundred thousand dollars is fire suppression costs from last\n\nyear, and $6,900,000 comes from other dedicated funds. He noted group\n\nFull Time Personnel (FTP) funds of $3,600,000; twenty-one percent of the\n\npersonnel costs are group FTPs (seasonal and part-time employees), these\n\nare not included in the Department’s FTP count. In regard to the tussock\n\nmoth control items, it is a supplemental which has been approved by\n\nJFAC. He noted there is $600,000 in federal funds for the tussock moth\n\ncontrol in the Moscow Mountain area. The fire suppression supplemental\n\nhas also been approved for $5,850,000. $3,800,00 is for the general fund.\n\nThese funds were approved as requested. A budget reduction of $166,800\n\nfrom the general fund represents 3.5 percent of the original appropriation.\n\nThe largest part is for fire preparedness.\n\nHe noted there are some provisions for pickup trucks, field equipment and\n\ncomputers, which were recommended by the Governor. In the\n\nnonstandard adjustments, $428,900 is for Attorney General fees. This is\n\nan increase from $162,800 to $598,700. The increase is due to\n\nendangered species issues, environmental, and endowment land issues\n\nwhich the Department must address. He noted the Department has two\n\nattorneys on staff and are requiring additional assistance from the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s office as well.\n\nUpon inquiry, Houston stated most of the costs for attorney fees is covered\n\nby the endowment fund, as well as some by the general fund. These are\n\ngenerally endangered species issues and endowment land issues.\n\nWinston Wiggins, Director, Department of Lands, noted the Department\n\nhas received notices from environmental groups regarding compliance\n\nwith the Endangered Species Act. No litigation has been filed, but there is\n\na considerable amount of staff time and legal staff time.\n\nHouston further stated the Commercial Leasing Program has an\n\nenhancement for $291,000 which will be from endowment earnings to pay\n\nfor property maintenance; as well as $60,000 for commercial property in\n\nBoise and $35,000 for contractual obligations for appraisal of the Priest\n\nLake cottage sites.\n\nHouston noted the endowment earnings fund includes the public schools,\n\nagricultural college, charitable institutions, normal school, penitentiary,\n\nschool of science, mental hospital and the University of Idaho.\n\nThe Department’s budget reflects spending authority for cumulative\n\nwatershed effects analysis on forested watersheds and in regard to national\n\nfire plan activities. $l,000,000 is included for the national fire plan grants\n\nfor the ongoing reduction of hazardous levels of fuel on private lands in\n\nIdaho.\n\nA department reorganization has shifted personnel to field offices so\n\nequipment is needed in order for them to complete their duties. The\n\nhazardous materials division requires funding for contract engineers to\n\ninvestigate the nature, origin, and extent of potential contaminants on state\n\nendowment lands.\n\nThe new organizational chart of the Department is set forth in the Natural\n\nResources Section of the Legislative Budget Book. A copy of which is\n\nattached.\n\nThe budge book also contains graphic illustrations of the funding history\n\nfor the Department, as well as endowment contributions and expenditures.\n\nUpon inquiry, Houston noted the Mine Closure Fund has an annual\n\nappropriation of $140,000 with a fund balance of $712,800. Houston\n\nreported the distribution of the mine license tax has been changed in recent\n\nyears.\n\nIn regard to fires, Houston reported in 2002 there were 308 fires covering\n\n1,670 acres for state lands, but for the entire state 4,600 acres were\n\neffected. The ten year average indicates 400 fire a year with 13,000 acres\n\nburned with over $3,000,000 of general fund expenditures. There are\n\n6,200,000 acres which the state is responsible to protect. This is mixed\n\nownership land because of agreements with various landowners. Houston\n\nnoted the costs are only after the fire started. The pre-fire suppression\n\ncosts of $6,800,000 must be included. He noted pending legislation in the\n\nHouse to increase the property tax for fire suppression from $.45 per acre\n\nto $.60 per acre.\n\nWiggins further informed the Committee, there were 300 temporary\n\nemployees last season with varied times of employment based on\n\nrespective projects. The primary employment is in connection with fires,\n\nwith the balance of temporary employees preparing timber sales for\n\nauction. He noted the average cost per acre is more efficient on larger\n\nfires than smaller ones. The bigger the fire the higher the total costs but\n\nthe costs are lower per acre.\n\nWiggins noted the Endangered Species Act is a significant issue on state\n\nlands. The Department will attempt to achieve some level of assurance\n\nfrom the US Fish and Wildlife Service for the state’s endeavors on state\n\nlands. Additionally, Wiggins stated there is a need for investment and\n\nasset planning for the endowments to ensure maximizing revenue. Land\n\nexchange, acquisition and disposal is important because some state lands\n\nthat do not contribute adequately to financial returns. Creative ways are\n\nneeded to enhance state land ownership to increase the asset value while\n\nincreasing the revenues for the endowments.\n\nUpon inquiry, Wiggins stated there has not been a challenge to any of the\n\ngrazing leases in the past year. The Sand Noble Springs parcel, which is\n\nhabitat for the Columbian spotted frog, was awarded despite a challenge to\n\nclassification of the lands. The Court ruled the state should have held a\n\ncontested case hearing, which will be held in the near future. This is a\n\nquasi-judicial proceeding with sworn testimony before a hearing officer.\n\nThe hearing officer will determine the facts of the case which will be\n\nreturned to the Land Board for consideration. Upon further inquiry,\n\nWiggins noted the grazing lease was not challenged, but there was a\n\nrequest for reclassification of the land from grazing to conservation. The\n\nother issue pending is a challenge on a lease on the Lewis-Clark Trail. He\n\nnoted the land is timber land with grazing as a secondary use. The Land\n\nBoard elected to award the lease to the next higher bidder. The highest\n\nbidder challenged the Board’s decision. The Court has ruled that a\n\ncontested case hearing should be held. The hearing has been stayed at the\n\nrequest of the Department because the lessee has not performed in\n\naccordance with the lease terms. The Land Board will hear this issue in\n\nthe next couple of months. The Board will either grant the lease to the\n\nhighest bidder or continue with the lessee and have a contested case\n\nhearing. He stated grazing land is a very steady income source, despite\n\nnot being high.\n\nThe status of the timber export law has been modified as the result of Land\n\nBoard action. The application of the Act in different parts of the state has\n\nchanged even though the Act has not changed.\n\nUpon inquiry, Chairman Noh informed the Committee will be addressing\n\nthe WestRock Project by way of legislation pending in House State\n\nAffairs. The House committee will be the guests of WestRock for viewing\n\nthe site and area involved in this project next Saturday. He noted this\n\ncommittee has always handled this type of legislation so the legislation\n\nwill be forthcoming. There are twenty commercial parcels individually\n\nlisted in the Idaho Code. The current lease was signed for ten years with\n\nthe option to renew four times. The issue is whether the lease should be\n\nextended to a forty-nine year lease.\n\nUpon inquiry from Senator Stennett as to the location of the Southwest\n\nOffice, which is listed as Twin Falls, Wiggins noted that is in error; the\n\noffice is located in Gooding. He noted the Gooding office staff have been\n\nexpanded so new facilities will be needed.\n\nThere being no further matters to come before the Committee, the meeting\n\nwas adjourned at 3:00 p.m.\n\nThe public hearing was called to order by Co-Chairman Noh. He noted the\n\nhearing is a follow-up to a hearing conducted by the Senate committee last year\n\nattempting to gain publicity regarding the concerns expressed about serious\n\nconflicts with ATV use, the state. Chairman Noh displayed a copy of the\n\nmagazine “Dirt Wheels” containing photographs depicting riders’ misuse of\n\nlands. One picture has the statement “Instant gratification is not soon enough.”\n\nAnother picture, depicting numerous riders on a ridge, states “Only those who\n\nwill risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.” He noted\n\nthese do not represent the attitude of many people engaged in such activities.\n\nOn April 22, 2002, the lead story on the front page of the Wall Street Journal,\n\n“Off Road Vehicles Now Fly the Waters of SW Texas” noted large four-wheel\n\ndrive vehicles, not ATVs, had discovered that the beds of rivers and streams\n\nbelong to the public. He noted many dozens were gathering to course up and\n\ndown the river beds. Additionally, he noted an article in the Salt Lake City\n\nnewspaper about the Mayor of Salt Lake City on a helicopter tour trying to find\n\nerrant ATVs who were tearing up the front. The focus of the hearing is to try\n\nand find ways to deal with the problems so that responsible people can\n\ncontinue to enjoy their outdoor activities and recreation without damage to the\n\nresources and without imposing unnecessarily on the other users of the\n\nresources.\n\nCo-chairman Noh specifically thanked Representative Butch Otter, 1st\n\nCongressional District, and his staff for providing a copy of legislation (H\n\n3808) introduced by Representative Scott McGinnis in the subcommittee on\n\nForest Health Committee. The proposed legislation endeavors to establish\n\nuniform enforcement and penalty standards for all of the federal agencies\n\ndealing with land management. The status and support of the legislation are\n\nunknown at this time.\n\nCo-chairman Stevenson expressed his concern of the abuses connected with\n\nATV users which effect the use by responsible ATV users. He noted the need\n\nfor better education as to the rules and regulations that apply to the respective\n\nlands. The hearing will allow the agencies and public to express their ideas\n\nand concerns.\n\nCo-Chairman Noh noted the Department of Parks and Recreation and the\n\nBoard of Parks and Recreation have been accumulating constructive proposals\n\nand ideas on how to improve this program. The Idaho Fish and Game\n\nDepartment recently completed a pilot project and experiment in management\n\nin connection with hunting. Additionally, there is representation from the U.\n\nS. Forest Service Ogden Regional Office and Supervisors from National\n\nForests within the state. He noted the Supervisor for the Boise National Forest\n\nis the liaison with the Legislature for forest issues. Additionally, the Bureau of\n\nLand Management, Idaho office, is represented at the hearing, as well as\n\nrepresentations from state agencies. He noted various organizations and\n\nindividual interests are also represented.\n\nRick Collignon, Director, Department of Parks and Recreation, remarked of the\n\nsignificant growth in off road vehicle registration and ownerships in Idaho and\n\nthe nation. The issue of off road vehicles encompasses the Department in park\n\nand recreation, land management and wildlife, as well as conservation issues.\n\nThe issue of off road vehicle use, because of the growth, has overwhelmed\n\nmanagement strategies. Additionally, there is an absence of a clear\n\nunderstanding of the values of management of off road vehicles. The affected\n\nagencies do not have a clear understanding of the activity and its use. There\n\nare several types of users: hunters, recreationalist, private landowners, and\n\nother multiple use recreational interests.\n\nThere are 68,521 registered ATVs and trail bikes in Idaho. In 1992, there were\n\n14,383 registered. Sixty percent of the currently registered machines are ATVs\n\nand forty percent are trail bikes. In 2001, the industry reported the sale of\n\n10,817 ATVs and trail bikes in Idaho. New models of ATVs are too wide for\n\nexisting ATV trails and this could lead to pressure for major costs to widen\n\ntrails. In 2002, the industry reported 15,804 sold; representing a forty-four\n\npercent increase in the state. Every region of the state has been impacted.\n\nCollignon displayed a chart showing the variance of growth throughout the\n\nstate, noting a 121 percent growth in eastern Idaho in the last five years, the\n\nhighest region. Another chart displayed by Collignon showed the twenty-nine\n\nyear growth in registrations in the state. The land management agencies and\n\nthe recreation agencies have been unable to adjust to the growth. There is one\n\nATV registered for every ten households in the state. He noted there are more\n\nATVs sold in the United States than highway motorcycles and off highways\n\nmotorcycles combined. This is a significant recreational group looking for\n\nopportunities to use these vehicles on public lands.\n\nA survey of hunters conducted in Idaho by the Forest Service, Bureau of Land\n\nManagement, Department of Fish and Game, and the Department of Parks and\n\nRecreation, indicated that 53 percent of all hunters own ATVs, 47 percent of\n\nthose are actively used in hunting. A similar survey conducted in 1988 showed\n\nfigures of 17 percent for deer hunters and 3 percent for elk hunters. Today\n\nthose figures are 47 percent of hunters. Another question in the survey asked\n\nhunters, if they encountered an off highway motorized vehicle, was the\n\nhunting experience diminished. Eighty-six percent of deer hunters said yes; 84\n\npercent of elk hunters said yes. The same survey asked about encountering\n\nother hunters, 71 percent of elk hunters said the hunting experience diminished\n\nand 67 percent of deer hunters said their hunting experience was diminished.\n\nIn the same survey, 68 percent of all hunters felt that the hunting experience\n\nwas compromised when they saw another motorized vehicle on a road or trail.\n\nHe noted the population growth has doubled in the past twenty years in the\n\nstate. The 46,000,000 acre public land base now has twice as many people\n\nusing the same lands. Idaho struggles with a multiple use tolerance of other\n\nusers on our public lands.\n\nThe baby boomer generation is the largest portion of the population segment to\n\napproach retirement age. This same group have been active recreationalist\n\ntheir entire lives and financially comfortable. The recreation time is very\n\nimportant to this age group. He noted this group also has more knee, neck, and\n\nback surgeries. Because ATVs are considered environmentally friendly and a\n\nmethod of transportation to continue their outdoor recreation , they are very\n\npopular.\n\nCollignon noted a year ago, BLM, US Forest Service, Department of Fish and\n\nGame and Department of Parks and Recreation, discussed this issue. As a\n\nresult of that meeting, the concept of a single state wide management strategy\n\nfor off road vehicles on public lands was developed. The four agencies agreed\n\ncurrent ATV restrictions need to be adequately signed and enforced.\n\nEnforcement by these four agencies is limited. Additionally, it was determined\n\nmore or newer restrictions needed to be developed through the public hearings.\n\nThe hearing process would provide further education and implement\n\nrestrictions. Developing trail systems to meet the legitimate user needs of the\n\ngrowing number of citizens is also basic. There is a state-wide coordinating\n\nwork group to bring a uniform approach to the issue. He explained a\n\ndemonstration project in Custer, Butte and Lemhi counties to develop a\n\ndesignated trail system, even in sensitive areas. In beginning their\n\ndemonstration project, they found thirteen of the twenty-three most popular\n\nmodels of ATVs do not even meet the legal definition according to the Idaho\n\nCode. The industry and manufacturing has changed significantly. Discussion\n\nwith a manufacturer in Florida centers on pounds per square inch under tires\n\nand turning radius for a new machine designed to carry two riders. The\n\nindustry is going to a “friendly” recreation mode. A new definition in the\n\nIdaho Code for ATVs will be in proposed legislation this session. He noted the\n\nmany federal and state agencies with some degree of enforcement\n\nresponsibilities in regard to ATVs needs to be coordinated for responsible use.\n\nChairman Noh acknowledged Senator Little for providing a specific area for\n\nATV usage on his lands.\n\nErnest Lombard, Chairman, Parks and Recreation Board, stated the good thing\n\nabout an ATV is that anyone can ride one and likewise, the bad thing about an\n\nATV is anyone can ride one. He noted the Paiute ATV trail system brochure\n\nwhich he provided to the Committee. (Copy attached.) He noted originally the\n\ntrail area was in an economically depressed area. Local recreationalist at\n\nRichfield, Utah developed a trail system for ATVs. Through negotiations with\n\nfederal, state, county and city entities, they developed trails connecting\n\ncommunities. There are now eighteen towns connected by the trail system with\n\nservices such as gas, motels, and even a private ATV camping site. The initial\n\nsystem was a 230 mile loop system, which is now 1200 to 1500 miles of trails\n\nthat all connect through the use of existing trails and roads. ATVs can be a\n\nproblem, but they can also be an opportunity for economic development in\n\nrural areas within the state. He noted the roads and trails are available within\n\nIdaho for such a system. An ATV trail project, attempted in the\n\nChallis/Mackay area, is an excellent example of possible economic projects for\n\nthe rural areas of Idaho, as well as meeting the needs of the users.\n\nSteve Huffaker, Director, Department of Fish and Game, stated the Department\n\nand Commission’s interest and support to address the concerns. He stated the\n\nDepartment would like to address the issue as a hunting issue. ATV usage was\n\na non-issue in the Department ten years ago, but is today the number one issue\n\nfrom officers in the field. The jurisdictional questions need to be resolved. As\n\nthe frustrations have grown, the Commission has struggled for several years\n\ntrying to address the problem. He noted there has been success on the Targee\n\nNational Forest with joint patrols by the Forest Service and the Department of\n\nFish and Game. There has been success working with private landowners\n\nduring antler pickup in the spring. At the last Commission meeting, the\n\nrestriction was lifted on antler pickup. He noted the Commission has defined\n\nsome traditional weapons and prohibited the use of motor vehicles in those\n\nkinds of hunts. The program was well accepted by the traditional weapon\n\nhunters. Last year the Commission designated Unit 47 and prohibited ATV\n\nusage for the entire hunting season. The acceptance by the hunters and private\n\nland owners has been good and is working. He anticipates the Commission\n\nwill propose some additional areas with some restrictions on ATV use during\n\nthe hunting season.\n\nLin Hintze, Chairman, Custer County Commissioner, explained the\n\ncoordination between the counties of Butte, Custer and Lemhi and the cities\n\nwithin the counties, along with federal and state agencies, agreeing on the\n\ndevelopment of a trail system. He provided a copy of a map of Custer county\n\ndepicting the federal, state, county and private landowners. The area\n\nencompasses over 3,000,000 acres with 96 percent owned by the federal\n\ngovernment. Ninety percent of the trail system is already in existence by the\n\nuse of mining roads and logging roads. He noted there are ghost towns and old\n\nmill sites along the trail site. There could be significant benefit to the rural\n\neconomies through the trail system.\n\nDick Smith, Supervisor, Boise National Forest, stated he is new to the position\n\nand welcomes the opportunity to listen and learn.\n\nLiz Close, Region 4, U.S. Forest Service, Deputy Regional Director of\n\nRecreation for the Intermountain Region of the Forest Service, stated the\n\nnational recreation strategy contains strong wording about the management of\n\noff road vehicle use. The use is a legitimate use of forest lands. The Forest\n\nService is working with the off road vehicle community to assure quality\n\nmotorized opportunities along with quality experiences while minimize\n\nenvironmental impacts. The Forest Service will designate user trails and areas\n\non a site by site basis through the forest planning system. A monitoring\n\nprocess will also be implemented. She compliment the efforts within the state\n\nto address the ATV usage issue. She noted the issue must be worked through\n\nall federal, state, county and city entities to involve and educate the public.\n\nEnforcement issues must be clarified and implemented without boundaries\n\nJerry Rees, Supervisor, Caribou-Targee National Forest, stated the travel\n\naccess and noise were the issues to be clarified. He noted his forests have had\n\nthis under consideration for approximately seven years. There are more\n\ncomplaints about irresponsible off trail, cross county, in meadows, uphill use\n\nby ATVs. The forest has gone to a designated trail system and eliminated the\n\ncross country, off trail use. He noted with a designated trail system there needs\n\nto be enough trails for use. There are 2600 miles of trails in the Targee-Caribou Forest of which 55 percent are for motorized use. A significant\n\nnumber of trails were not designed for the width required by ATVs. The\n\ndefining of an ATV trail system is highly debatable. The forest is working\n\nwith users to design a system, but he anticipates a lot of discussion, work and\n\ninvestment. He noted the grant program in the State through the Department of\n\nParks and Recreation has helped significantly in this regard.\n\nRees noted education and enforcement are other issues. He stated common\n\nbrochures providing education to the public in proper and responsible use is\n\nvery important. He encouraged a statewide program with common standards.\n\nThe enforcement through joint patrols by state and counties has been most\n\neffective.\n\nSusan Giannettino, Deputy State Director, Resources and Planning Division,\n\nBureau of Land Management, stated she was representing K. Lynn Bennett, the\n\nnew State Director, who is unable to attend. She stated the growth has\n\nexceeded expectations and they are unable to cope with the growth. She noted\n\nBLM lands are ideal opportunities for ATV recreation, an appropriate\n\nopportunity in proper places and in proper ways. She encourages the\n\ncoordinated enforcement that has been taking place. She acknowledged the\n\nleadership provided by the Department of Parks and Recreation in this\n\nprogram. Using existing roads and trails, a ATV trail system can be\n\nimplemented that provides a recreational opportunity for all interests. The\n\nefforts in Custer, Lemhi and Butte counties are an excellent opportunity to\n\npursue.\n\nAdditionally, access information needs to be available to ATV users. She\n\nnoted a web based site is under consideration to provide the ongoing changes\n\nin information. Giannettino stated law enforcement issues also need to be\n\nconsidered. Partnership with the user community and education/information\n\nsharing is critical. She stated another aspect is land management planning.\n\nThe older BLM land management plans provide the public the opportunity to\n\ngo almost anywhere they want. It will take some time for BLM to bring these\n\nplans up-to-date. BLM has been working with the Department of Fish and\n\nGame to develop strategies regarding ATV usage during the hunting season.\n\nShe noted BLM has a new position, an off road vehicle coordinator, which will\n\ncoordinate agency participation and efforts. BLM is committed to providing\n\nquality opportunities to off road vehicle users throughout the state. She again\n\nnoted that signing and enforcement are the biggest issues.\n\nWayne Weiner, Island Park/Twin Falls, stated his experiences in the Island\n\nPark area over the past few years. Hikers, bikers, motorcycles and ATVs have\n\neroded the trails in that area to the point where they are no longer useable in\n\ncertain areas. With the speed and reckless use by ATV users, it has become\n\nalmost impossible for others to use the trails and area. He noted there is not an\n\nATV organization in that area to assist in solving this problem. Someone or\n\nsome agency needs to take on the responsibility. He suggested the\n\nimplementation of a state-wide sticker with the fees going to resolving the\n\nproblem. Idaho is a beautiful state and he hates to see it ruined by just a few.\n\nBill Jones, President, Idaho A.T.V. Association, Boise, speaking in behalf of\n\nthe organization, stated that with the increase in off road vehicles, along with\n\nthe increasing population within the state, it is inevitable to have irresponsible\n\nand thoughtless riders. The association was established because of that\n\nproblem and the possibility of losing the opportunity to ride on open roads and\n\ntrails. He seeks to keep the roads and trails open for all to enjoy responsible.\n\nThe association has received several grants from DPR for the development of\n\nbrochures to provide education and information. Jones noted Senator Little has\n\nallowed an ATV park in the Emmett area on fence land set aside for that\n\nspecific purpose. He noted the members of the Association use their own\n\nequipment for the maintenance of roads and trails for ATV use in southern\n\nIdaho. Additionally, trail signs were placed at every intersection on 86 miles\n\nof the Idaho Centennial Trail from the Nevada state line to Glenns Ferry. He\n\ndisplayed a sample of the sign erected throughout the trail. Volunteers from\n\nseveral ATV organizations participated in the project. He informed the\n\nCommittee of the other volunteer efforts by many ATV organizations in the\n\nsouthern Idaho area. He noted volunteer effort results in a feeling of ownership\n\nand pride in the project or area. Riders must be better educated on the rules\n\nand regulations. Likewise, they should have input on the enforcement. He\n\nproposes all ATV, trail machine, mountain bike, and snow machines be\n\nassessed an additional $2 per machine per year for a designated fund for law\n\nenforcement and search and rescue for specified areas of the state.\n\nRobert Nelson, Twin Falls, stated his comments are the same as previous\n\nspeakers.\n\nRon Stricklin, Idaho ATV Assn., Past President, related his positive personal\n\nexperiences as a result ATV riding. He stated the complaints are caused by a\n\nsmall number of people as with other sports. He questioned whether new laws\n\nwere needed or if better enforcement and better funding was necessary. He\n\nstated cross country travel is not needed. The Mountain Home Ranger District\n\nhas created a demonstration project near Anderson Ranch Dam with a trail\n\nsystem to help control abuses during hunting season. He noted the project is a\n\ngood example of what can be accomplished for recreation riders. He would\n\nlike to encourage and strive for the positive aspects of the activity.\n\nSteve Gunderson, President, Idaho Trails Council, stated their organization is a\n\ncomposite of all trail user groups to promote the protection and improvement\n\nof Idaho trails. The council supports efforts to improve the ATV experience as\n\nindicated in the brochures by the Department of Parks and Recreation. He\n\nnoted the council supports the proper use of ATVs.\n\nTom Judge, Idaho Bowhunters, provided a handout to the Committee\n\ncontaining their recommendations to the outdoor recreation community,\n\nlegislative committees, state agencies, law enforcement and the courts and\n\npossible legislation for the imposition of penalties, creation of an off road\n\nvehicle account, funds of the account usage, and law enforcement\n\nresponsibilities. (A copy is attached.)\n\nBrent Madron, President, Treasure Valley Trail Machine Association, urged\n\nthe development of a state wide trail system on public land. His two wheel off\n\nroad vehicle users support ATV usage for recreation, but would urge\n\nconsideration of a separate system for two wheel off road vehicles from ATVs.\n\nHe complimented the Department of Parks and Recreation for their efforts to\n\ndate, noting there is a definite public need for education and good information.\n\nBrett Nelson, Ada County Green Party, urged the Committee to not overlook\n\nthe environmental impacts through ATV usage in deliberations of the issues.\n\nJack Fisher, President, Idaho Wildlife Federation, inquired why the issue was\n\nof concern as ninety percent of ATV users are responsible. He noted the ten\n\npercent causing the problems should be handled through enforcement of\n\nexisting rules and regulations. He stated his organization supports efforts to\n\nresolve the issue.\n\nPhil Homer, Boise, relinquished his time as his concerns had been spoken to by\n\nprevious speakers.\n\nClark Collins, Blue Ribbon Coalition, Executive Director, Recreation Division,\n\nurged the Committee to keep in mind national funding for off highway vehicle\n\nrecreational use. He noted the increased number of registered ATVs and the\n\nnumber of well organized user groups who are all willing to assist in solving\n\nthe problems.\n\nTed Howard, Shoshone-Paiute Tribe, Idaho Resources Advisory Council,\n\nreminded the Committee people come to Idaho because of what Idaho has to\n\noffer. He urged the Committee to remember any decisions and actions must\n\nconsider the environmental impacts and the legacy of the state. He urges\n\ncontrol of ATVs in designated areas and enforcement of rules and regulations\n\nas the resource is not renewable and impacts can be irreversible.\n\nMike Ihli, Manager, Hewlett Farms, stated the Owyhee area has significant use\n\nby off road vehicles and strict enforcement of rules and regulations is needed.\n\nThe damage to the Owyhee front is extensive.\n\nLauren McLean, Idaho Conservation League, noted their organization supports\n\nthe appropriate and responsible use of off road vehicles in designated areas.\n\nShe noted the destruction of vegetation and the spread of noxious weeds. She\n\nurged the Committee to not convert single track trails to accommodate ATV\n\nusage. ICL urges enforcement of regulations in the existing designated areas.\n\nRuss Thurow stated he represents himself and other elk and deer hunters and is\n\nconcerned that unrestricted off road vehicle usage is destroying hunting. The\n\nusage destroys habitat and drives game animals away from the hunting area.\n\nHe urged better management and enforcement of existing laws. He stated there\n\nwere too many existing trails affecting hunting.\n\nJim Juker said he was representing himself. He has been riding ATVs for a\n\nnumber of years. He said ATV users can be and are the extra eyes and ears, as\n\nresponsible citizens, of public land usage. He urged better information on\n\ndesignated area for usage.\n\nThere being no further matters to come before the joint committee; the meeting\n\nwas adjourned at 9:30 p.m.\n\nThe meeting was called to order by Chairman Noh at 1:40 p.m.\n\nSenator Pearce, subcommittee chairman of the rules assigned to the\n\nCommittee, stated there are only a few rules to be addressed by the whole\n\nCommittee. There are two rules of the Outfitters and Guides Board which\n\nthe House Resources and Conservation Committee has rejected. These\n\nwill come before this Committee through a concurrent resolution. One\n\nrule pertains to the requirement of personal possession of a first aid card.\n\nThe other rule addressing the definition of “term.” Another rule to be\n\nconsidered by the Committee is from the Department of Environmental\n\nQuality concerning underground storage tanks, specifically the\n\nspecifications for the leakage valve. The rejected rule concerning\n\nreasonable access pertaining to sewage tanks will be handled by the Health\n\nand Welfare Committee.\n\nChairman Noh introduced Aaron Miles, representing the Nez Perce Tribe.\n\nChairman Noh informed the Committee of a joint meeting with the House\n\nResources and Conservation Committee on Wednesday, February 5, at\n\n1:30 PM in the Gold Room will pertain to the Governor’s strategy for\n\ndealing with the wolf issue by Jim Caswell and Greg Schildwachter,\n\nOffice of Species Conservation, and Steve Huffaker, Director, Department\n\nof Fish and Game.\n\nSteve Huffaker, Director, Department of Fish and Game, and Dr. Bob\n\nHillman, Department of Agriculture, presented information on Chronic\n\nWaste Disease to the Committee. Huffaker explained the disease is caused\n\nby an agent called a prion which is a unique misfolded, small protein.\n\nHow the disease is transmitted has not been determined, but it is\n\ntransmittable. CWD was first discovered in Colorado/Wyoming about\n\nthirty years ago. CWD was relatively unknown until twenty years ago it\n\nappeared in the upper mid-west in white tail deer in Wisconsin. The\n\nWisconsin herd was concentrated in a small area with approximately fifty\n\ndeer per square mile. They were being fed artificially which is believed to\n\nhave contributed to the development of the disease in the herd.\n\nA national strategy was then developed for dealing with CWD in wildlife\n\nand domestic animals. He noted the communication between DPR and\n\nDFG has been excellent in addressing the concerns about CWD. CWD is\n\nnot present in Idaho at the present time. Efforts have been exerted to keep\n\nCWD out of the state. DA has done a good job of controlling the situation\n\nin relation to captive cervidae and DFG is responsible for CWD in\n\nwildlife. He noted the attempts to increase awareness and better public\n\neducation. The Commission, rather than create regulatory mechanisms, is\n\nproviding information to hunters. The disease exists primarily in the brain\n\ntissue and spinal column of infected animals. He noted some states have\n\npermitted transportation across state boundaries of only boned-out meat.\n\nDFG urges hunters in CWD areas to leave the meat in the field where the\n\nanimal falls.\n\nUpon inquiry from the Committee, Huffaker stated the disease is\n\nspreading geographically because it is no longer just around the Colorado-Wyoming border. CWD has spread throughout Colorado and is found in\n\ncaptive cervidae facilities. The only known method of containment is the\n\neliminate the source. All animals within a designated area are destroyed to\n\nprevent the spread of the disease. He stated the past year, Wisconsin\n\nattempted to kill all the deer in a 300 square mile area because of CWD.\n\nWisconsin biologist estimate a ten percent kill because it is heavily\n\nwooded farm country. White tail deer are very secretive animals. He\n\nnoted it might be possible to have a “scorched earth” policy in specific\n\nareas in the state. He noted the herds in Idaho are very migratory. He\n\nprovided to the Committee a copy of the action plan. (Copy attached.)\n\nThe main focus is to keep CWD out of the state. He noted there is not a\n\nlive animal test available. CWD has an eighteen month incubation. An\n\nanimal can be contaminated long before CWD is manifested. It is\n\nsuspected that the disease has been around for some time, but has been\n\nmanifested in wild game experiencing severe feed and overcrowded\n\nconditions.\n\nDr. Bob Hillman, Department of Agriculture, informed the Committee that\n\nmad cow disease is not transmittable to deer and elk. The outbreak in the\n\nUnited Kingdom was from consumption by cattle of material containing\n\nbrain and spinal cord. In many foreign countries, those products are\n\nconsumed by humans, which is a mode of transmission. The UK imposed\n\na ban on utilization of those kinds of products intended for human\n\nconsumption as a means to stop the spread of the disease in humans. He\n\nnoted the material responsible for transmission to cattle was improperly\n\nrendered product. The product was partial rendered, not fully rendered.\n\nAnother theory in the UK is that the disease just evolved and has been\n\naround for sometime, but at low levels. Another theory about CWD is that\n\nthe disease was transmitted from sheep to wildlife. The exact cause of\n\nCWD is unknown, but the disease has been present since 1967 in wild\n\ngame.\n\nChairman Noh stated in the sheep industry, the central nervous system\n\ntissue has been banned for some time from going into ruminate livestock\n\nfeed. Dr. Hillman stated FDA has also banned cervidae material in feed\n\nproducts. He noted that any animal that is slaughtered undergoes a post-mortem inspection. Any animal showing any evidence of central nervous\n\nsystem disease is not slaughtered and does not go into the human food\n\nchain. Most of the cervidae are processed at custom plants.\n\nDr. Hillman stated the Department was not aware of any problems, but is\n\naware that Food Safety Inspection Service is reviewing procedures used\n\non cervidae. The sampling in Idaho has not indicated a presence of the\n\ndisease. USDA and the Department of Interior are working to establish a\n\nsurveillance plan which would sample many thousands of deer and elk\n\nthrough the coming hunting season. There are a small number of\n\nlaboratories that have been approved to do CWD testing. He anticipates it\n\nwill take some time for testing results. Additionally, he stated the disease\n\nwill probably be found in more areas than anticipated. The risks of the\n\ndisease has not been a deterrent for hunters in Colorado and Wyoming.\n\nSenator Schroeder inquired as to the disposition of animal heads after\n\nslaughter. Dr. Hillman stated under the FDA rendered, ruminate protein\n\ncannot be put into products for human consumption. The product may be\n\nput into feed for chickens or pet food. The past twelve years’ experience\n\nin the US through extensive testing has not shown any indication of the\n\ndisease. Additionally, Dr. Hillman noted that there is no evidence that\n\nmuscle tissue or milk is a source of the disease. He stated that the spinal\n\ncord and all related structures are not permissible in food for human\n\nconsumption. Hillman noted the ongoing research over the past five and\n\none-half years in cattle regarding CWD . The cattle were put in a pen with\n\ncervidae infected with CWD and after a time there has been no evidence\n\nof transmission to cattle. There is a similar study with sheep that shows no\n\nevidence of transmission over the past three and one-half years.\n\nAdditionally there has been a cattle study wherein the cattle were injected\n\nin the brain with the disease. A long term study has indicated that two or\n\nthree of the cattle did have brain lesions consistent with a similar disease.\n\nIn the sheep study, two of the sheep have died or been destroyed; one\n\nsheep had lesions consistent with CWD. Under natural conditions, there is\n\nno evidence of transmission of CWD to cattle or sheep.\n\nHuffaker stated the concern of the Department is the transmission between\n\nungulates. The plan of the Department will continue and surveillance will\n\nincrease. Additionally, the Department will continue participating in the\n\nnational program. He noted field personnel and officers have been trained\n\nin what to look for in the wild. The Department will attempt to keep up a\n\ngood source of scientific data and information for hunters.\n\nThere being no further matters to come before the Committee, the meeting\n\nwas adjourned at 3:00 p.m.\n\nThe meeting was called to order by Chairman Noh at 1:40 p.m.\n\nMotion by Senator Brandt to approve the minutes of January 31, 2003;\n\nseconded by Senator Schroeder. Motion carried.\n\nMotion by Senator Schroeder to approve the gubernatorial appointment of\n\nJim Kempton to the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation\n\nPlanning Council; seconded by Senator Cameron. Motion carried.\n\nDavid Mabe, Administrator of Water Quality Programs, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Quality, introduced RS 12894 regarding the powers and\n\nduties associated with pollutant trading requirements. The purpose of the\n\nchange in the statute is to assure that Water Quality Standards don’t grow\n\nunnecessarily, but that a process is maintained for Legislative oversight of\n\nthe rules and regulations to be adopted. In regard to pollution trading,\n\nDepartment of Environmental Quality, along with local input, develops\n\nbasin reports to try and determine how trading should take place in the\n\nbasin. On the Boise River and the Mid-Snake River, trading programs\n\nhave been developed to enable local interests to operate a trading program.\n\nThis could also provide assistance to individuals to comply with permit\n\nlimits or Total Maximum Daily Load limits when necessary. He\n\nexpressed concern about having to adopt the extensive plans into the rules,\n\nverbatim, Department of Environmental Quality would prefer to use a\n\nprocess where they would be adopted by reference. This would save\n\nprinting and would require one page stating the reference. This makes the\n\nreference a part of the rules; they are processed through the rule making\n\nprocess. Publication and public comment and considerations of the rule by\n\nthe Legislature along with a copy of the repor"
