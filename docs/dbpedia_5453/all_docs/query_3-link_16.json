        "text": "Country retreat of the US president\n\nFor the negotiations leading to the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, see Camp David Accords. For the summit in 2000, see 2000 Camp David Summit. For trilateral summit in 2023, see Camp David Principles.\n\nCamp David is a 125-acre (51 ha) country retreat for the president of the United States. It is located in the wooded hills of Catoctin Mountain Park, in Frederick County, Maryland, near the towns of Thurmont and Emmitsburg, about 62 miles (100 km) north-northwest of the national capital city of Washington, D.C.[1][2][3] It is code named Naval Support Facility Thurmont. Technically a military installation, its staffing is primarily provided by the Seabees, Civil Engineer Corps (CEC), the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps. Naval construction battalions are tasked with Camp David construction and send detachments as needed.\n\nOriginally known as Hi-Catoctin, Camp David was built as a retreat for federal government agents and their families by the Works Progress Administration.[4] Construction started in 1935 and was completed in 1938.[5] In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt converted it to a presidential retreat and renamed it \"Shangri-La\", after the fictional Himalayan paradise.[4] Camp David received its present name in 1953 from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in honor of his father and his grandson, both named David.[6]\n\nThe Catoctin Mountain Park does not indicate the location of Camp David on park maps due to privacy and security concerns,[3] although it can be seen through the use of publicly accessible satellite images.\n\nPresidential use\n\n[edit]\n\nCamp David has been used to host private diplomatic meetings with foreign leaders and heads of state since at least World War II. Franklin D. Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill at Shangri-La in May 1943, during World War II.[7] Dwight Eisenhower held his first cabinet meeting there on November 22, 1955, following hospitalization and convalescence he required after a heart attack suffered in Denver, Colorado, on September 24.[8] Eisenhower met Nikita Khrushchev there for two days of discussions in September 1959.[9]\n\nJohn F. Kennedy and his family often enjoyed riding and other recreational activities there, and Kennedy often allowed White House staff and Cabinet members to use the retreat when he or his family were not there.[10] Lyndon B. Johnson met with advisors in this setting and hosted both Australian prime minister Harold Holt and Canadian prime minister Lester B. Pearson there.[11] Richard Nixon was a frequent visitor. He personally directed the construction of a swimming pool and other improvements to Aspen Lodge.[12] Gerald Ford hosted Indonesian president Suharto at Camp David.[13]\n\nJimmy Carter initially favored closing Camp David in order to save money, but once he visited the retreat, he decided to keep it.[14] Carter brokered the Camp David Accords there in September 1978 between Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin.[7] Ronald Reagan visited the retreat more than any other president.[15] In 1984, Reagan hosted British prime minister Margaret Thatcher.[16] Reagan restored the nature trails that Nixon paved over so he could horseback ride at Camp David.[17] George H. W. Bush's daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch, was married there in 1992, in the first wedding held at Camp David.[18] During his tenure as president, Bill Clinton spent every Thanksgiving at Camp David with his family. In July 2000, he hosted the 2000 Camp David Summit negotiations between Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat there.[20][21]\n\nIn February 2001, George W. Bush held his first meeting with a European leader, UK prime minister Tony Blair, at Camp David, to discuss missile defense, Iraq, and NATO.[22] After the September 11 attacks, Bush held a Cabinet meeting at Camp David to prepare the United States invasion of Afghanistan.[23] During his two terms in office, Bush visited Camp David 149 times, for a total of 487 days, for hosting foreign visitors as well as a personal retreat. He met Blair there four times. Among the numerous other foreign leaders he hosted at Camp David were Russian president Vladimir Putin[25][26] and President Musharraf of Pakistan in 2003,[27] Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in June 2006,[20] and British prime minister Gordon Brown in 2007.[28]\n\nBarack Obama chose Camp David to host the 38th G8 summit in 2012.[29] President Obama also hosted Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev at Camp David,[30] as well as the GCC Summit there in 2015.[31]\n\nDonald Trump hosted Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan at Camp David while the Republican Party prepared to defend both houses of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections.[32] The 46th G7 summit was to be held at Camp David on June 10–12, 2020, but was cancelled due to health concerns during what was at the time considered the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.[33]\n\nJoe Biden hosted the U.S.–Japan–Korea Summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David in August 2023, resulting in the declaration of the Camp David Principles on trilateral relations between the U.S., Japan, and South Korea.[34]\n\nCount of visits by each president\n\n[edit]\n\nPresidential visits to Camp David[15] President No. of visits Years in office Roosevelt Unknown 1933–1945 Truman 10 1945–1953 Eisenhower 45 1953–1961 Kennedy 19 1961–1963 Johnson 30 1963–1969 Nixon 160 1969–1974 Ford 29 1974–1977 Carter 99 1977–1981 Reagan 189 1981–1989 G.

Bush 150 2001–2009 Obama 39 2009–2017 Trump 15 2017–2021 Biden 36 2021–present\n\nPractice golf facility\n\n[edit]\n\nTo be able to play his favorite sport, President Eisenhower had golf course architect Robert Trent Jones design a practice golf facility at Camp David. Around 1954, Jones built one golf hole—a par 3—with four different tees; Eisenhower added a 250-yard (230 m) driving range near the helicopter landing zone.[35]\n\nSecurity incidents\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 2, 2011, an F-15 intercepted a civilian aircraft approximately 6 miles (10 km) from Camp David, when President Obama was in the residence. The two-seater, which was out of radio communication, was escorted to nearby Hagerstown, Maryland, without incident.[36]\n\nOn July 10, 2011, an F-15 intercepted another small plane near Camp David when Obama was again in the residence; a total of three were intercepted that weekend.[37]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States portal\n\nMaryland portal\n\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\n\nBlair House, another official White House lodging for guests\n\nCamp Misty Mount Historic District and Camp Greentop Historic District, built at the same time in Catoctin Mountain Park as Camps 1 and 2\n\nChequers, the country house of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n\nHarrington Lake, the retreat of the Prime Minister of Canada\n\nNight of Camp David, a 1965 novel (political thriller)\n\nOfficial residence\n\nOrange One, a U.S. Navy-operated facility underneath Camp David\n\nPresidential Townhouse, the official guest house for former U.S. presidents\n\nRapidan Camp, the predecessor of Camp David from 1929 to 1933\n\nSite R, bunker and communications center near Camp David\n\nTrowbridge House, adjacent to Blair House and the guest house for former presidents\n\nWhite House, official residence of the president of the United States since 1800\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nWorks cited\n\n[edit]"
