        "text": "In honor of Justin Akins, Navy - Served in the Gulf War\n\nHometown: Ely (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Karen Voli)\n\nJustin, my grandson, enlisted in the Navy while still in High School. He served in the Gulf from Jan 07 to Sept. 07. He starts his 2nd (unknown) tour of duty again this January. This tour will be hard for him because since his last tour he and his wife have had a baby. Brayden is 2 months old. I know Justin is thinking about all of the accomplishments that Brayden will make while he's gone & going to miss: that first tooth, seeing him sit up for the first time. . . simply watching him grow. I just hope he knows how very proud we all are of him and how anxious I am to hold that new baby.\n\nIn honor of Sergeant First Class E-7 Rex Allen, Army\n\nHometown: Barbourville, KY (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Teanna Allen)\n\nRex has been my husband for five years now and I have watched him grow through his years in the service.

My thoughts remind me of Art Altman, who enjoyed the harvest, running machines and all that goes with it. Art is no longer with us, a member of the \"great generation\" called upon to serve our country in times of great peril. He participated in the D-day invasion. Art never said much about those times, except to mention the close calls he had survived. I picked up my button at Farm Fest. I wear it proudly In honor of Art. He enabled me to wear it. This election is of utmost importance, and each vote counts. One vote decided to give the Nazi party leadership to Adolf Hitler. I wear my button humbly, proudly, respectfully, and ask the readers to VOTE. Regards.

He enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in the Far East, storming the shores of Peleliu, and Guam.

He never received a purple heart for his wound, the witnesses are all deceased. He says serving and fighting in WWII is one of the things he is most proud of that he has done in his life. When he returned from serving almost four years overseas he arrived in San Francisco and called home. He then found out that his father had passed away two weeks before. This was very difficult.

The best thing I can say about him is he loved the Navy and his country. He was a strong believer in our way of life. He was a 20 year man.

My dad was in the tank corps, but he started his training on horses in North Carolina because there were no tanks available for training yet. Once overseas he was part of the D Day invasion. It was literally a case of 'bringing coals to Newcastle,' as he grew up on the northeast coast of Britain (near Newcastle!). His father, a shipbuilder, moved the family to New York in 1931 during the Great Depression looking for work. There wasn't any. My dad spent some time with General Patton and survived. Patton was notorious for the way he used his tank corps hard. My dad won a Bronze Star for his actions in the taking of Hitler's Eagles Nest, the Berchtesgaden. He was also part of the second unit to find the Dachau Concentration Camp. He never talked about either of these events or much about the war at all, although we did get a few stories about D-day. My dad passed in 2000 at the age of 82, taking most of his stories with him. But after his service he always voted too.

They still tear up when they talk about the thank you people have given them for their services both here in Minnesota and abroad. The love and care they have for each other has extended to their fellow comrades. I'm proud to call them SONS.\n\nIn honor of Sergeant David Bonnifield, Army National Guard - Served in the Iraq War\n\nHometown: New Ulm (Submitted September 15, 2010 by Kathy Bonnifield)\n\nThis year my vote honors my niece, who just started kindergarten. Sweetie, I wish you wouldn’t have cried when you saw my little brother talking to his friend, who was in a National Guard uniform. It doesn’t mean they are taking him away for a fourth deployment. We now realize how much these wars have affected you. This year I will vote In honor of you. I will vote with hope for your future. I know that you are not officially a vet, but you stand in the shadow my little brother, Sgt David Bonnifield.\n\nIn honor of Chief Petty Officer (Ret. ) Richard Borkovec, Navy - Served in Vietnam\n\nHometown: Chicago, IL (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Robert Borkovec)\n\nFor my Dad, a man I did not get to know very well growing up, because he was away on deployment all the time.

He was proud of his service to the country, and a proud Democrat. My father took me to vote when he did, back when it was a curtained machine where you pulled levers to make your selection. I remember him holding me up and telling me which levers to pull and he let me pull the final lever that registered his vote. These days, I'm an election judge and I think of my father every time I see someone bringing their child in to show them how to vote. And every time I vote, I think of my father.\n\nIn honor of Evan Busse, Navy - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Louisville (Submitted September 8, 2008 by Heather Saliba)\n\nIn honor of Evan William Busse, who spent his time defending our country on the U.

He idolized Dad's kid brother, my uncle Frank, who joined the Navy in 1935 and served his entire tour on the USS Arizona, dying at Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941. Marvin, a ND farm boy, entered the Army about 1940 and became a commissioned officer, serving in the Pacific, ending the war as part of the provisional government in a prefecture of Japan.

I believe the military has helped mold him into the man he is today. He holds his family, church and community close to his heart. He believes America is a wealthy country and offers many opportunities, not just monetary gain. He has lived through the great depression and knows heartache and loss, but this experience made him stronger. He lives with dignity, respect and honor. My father is a wise man with strong values and does not force his beliefs on others. Veterans are the backbone of America and too many take their freedom for granted. I am proud that my dad is just a small thread of what makes America strong.\n\nIn honor of Corporal Kenneth Carpenter, US Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Bellingham, MN (Submitted August 25, 2008 by Kat Benjamin)\n\nThis tribute is to my father and all other veterans of WW II.

He had a big heart and a generous spirit. He served with others from the New Mexico area and was shipped to the Philippine Islands and Clark Air Force base leaving the US on September 8, 1941. Clark Air Force Base was attacked the day after Pearl Harbor and my Dad’s unit was responsible for covering the retreat of the Northern Luzon Force into Bataan. As the war situation deteriorated his regiment surrendered to the Japanese and he survived the atrocities of the 65-mile “Death March” to be held prisoner for over 3 years. David was never bitter but believed we all “had a job to do” and held strong values about exercising our right to vote. As he told us often “I didn’t go over there for nothing. ” He believed he served so that we could live in a free country and especially so that we could get out and vote.

As a child growing up I looked forward to those times he was home on leave so I could hear about the country of Vietnam and see the interesting items he brought home as gifts. As time went on and I grew older my time with Uncle Tom became less and less, especially since he moved to Washington State. In 1995 at a family reunion we were together after almost 15 years. He was still very proud of his country and his service to the people of the US. However, he beat me for the championship trophy in horseshoes. I asked him where he learned to play so well and he said in the service they would play horseshoes to pass the time and forget about the chaos around them for a brief period of time. I never forgave him for beating me but will always be proud of him and honored by what he did.\n\nIn honor of Ken Covington, Air Force - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Crystal (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Rebecca Covington)\n\nMy vote honors my grandfather, Ken Covington, who served as a bombardier in the European theater during WWII.\n\nIn honor of Bobbe Cox, US Army - Served in the Vietnam War\n\nHometown: Detroit Lakes, MN (Submitted September 15, 2008 by Kay Hartness)\n\nBobbe is my brother.

It was planned that our crew would be flown back to Lakehurst in a day or two by heavier-than-air craft. After a full day of sitting around, our captain called us together and told us we'd been ordered to ferry an old blimp back to Lakehurst for teardown. He was very upset and gave us our liberty cards, telling us whatever we did that night in town was all right with him. We later learned he'd argued all day against flying this old ship. We went to the closest beer hall and tried to drink as much beer as we could. About the time we were full we met a chief petty officer that, when told we were the crew ferrying the old ship the next day, took us in his car to his own secret bar. Somewhat after closing time he dumped us back at the base bunk room. We were rousted out for flight well before daylight. On the East coast the hours around dawn are usually the quietest and safest for blimp launches. When we saw the ship in the hangar we collectively gasped. I had never seen such a decrepit flying machine in my life. Paint was missing from the car and there was an emergency landing wheel rigged to the bottom of the car with nylon strapping. One propeller was different. We quickly learned that the ship had made a bad carrier landing some weeks previously and tore the landing gear off while wiping out a prop on the carrier's flight deck. The destroyed prop had been replaced by a WWII vintage fixed pitch prop salvaged from a junked transport plane and that the bag or envelope was two years overage for legal flight. A blimp's bag is made of multiple plies of rubberized fabric and is supposed to be taken out of service after a certain number of months of inflation, all adjusted and governed by the amount of sunlight it received while in service. The ship was underinflated to reduce the strain on the fabric and we were warned to not exceed 50 knots airspeed. Blimps of that type were normally limited to 65 knots airspeed redline. We and our chow box were placed on the ship and the entire base ground crew maneuvered us out of the hangar by hand. We started our engines and were airborne. We had no sooner got airborne than we shut down the engine that had the improper prop. The makeshift prop was causing severe engine vibration. We then established a course for Lakehurst and about 9:00 AM the pilot got on the intercom and asked our rigger to check the food box. He said, \"Lets see if those bastards sent us off on this mission with nothing but crackers and water too. \" The rigger soon called back and said that the food box was filled with bread, onions, butter and steaks. The pilot said, \"Lets just have a steak smothered in onions on bread for a starter. \" The navigator and the co-pilot were too hungover to want to eat so the rigger and I had the second and third steaks. As a matter of fact there were enough steaks that we ate them all the way to Lakehurst, fried in butter and smothered in onions fried in butter. We encountered some head winds while moving up the coast and with our airspeed limit of 50 knots occasionally could only make good about 15-20 knots ground speed. We arrived at Lakehurst in a dead calm about 9:00 PM and carefully made a long straight-in approach. The ship was rolled into the tear-down hanger and secured and we went home for some well-earned rest. During that same night, the ship's bag split lengthwise and the car crashed to the hanger floor. Our luck had carried us just far enough. Blimps have gone down with huge rips in them and with the bag full of machine gun holes and always sank slowly enough to save the crew but none had ever split full length before.\n\nIn honor of James Crossley, US Army - Served in World War II\n\n(Submitted August 22, 2008 by Colleen Crossley)\n\nDad: Thanks to you and so many others for your sacrifices.

My dad was just an ordinary hard-working guy who dedicated his life to first serving his country, then providing for his family, being the neighborhood \"handy-helper,\" and enjoying his favorite pastime of fishing for \"lunkers.” Although he was reluctant to talk about his experiences in the South Pacific during WWII, he often talked about the freedoms & obligations we have as Americans. He valued the freedoms we enjoy-of speech & dissent, of the press, of religion, and to choose the school for his child. He also understood the obligations we have - of charity to the less fortunate, being a good neighbor, staying informed on current events & voting in elections. He knew the high cost of our American values & democracy. His military service was his way of preserving these for future generations. I miss him every day since his death in 1986.

Thanks is not enough!\n\nIn honor of John Faughender, Air Force - Served in World War II\n\n(Submitted November 4, 2008 by Paula Faughender)\n\nI'm voting this year In honor of my Dad. He taught us to vote for the person, not the party. And, he would have been thrilled to see the Democratic candidate for President this year - a black man running for President was Dad's goal for our country, and true equal rights for all of us, even though he was a white guy from South Dakota. He would say \"I won't see it in my lifetime, but hopefully you'll see it in yours\". So Dad, this year I'm voting for the candidate of your dreams. I love you. Paula\n\nIn honor of Specialist Shane Flodeen, Army National Guard, Serving in GWAT\n\nHometown: Cannon Falls (Submitted October 1, 2008 by Sue Maher)\n\nI am so proud of my son, Shane Flodeen, seeing him support his country and do what he believes in. It has definitely been a life experience that will never be forgotten. But it gives me honor to watch him grow as a man and as a soldier.\n\nIn honor of Specialist Stephen Flodeen, Army National Guard - Serving in GWAT\n\nHometown: Cannon Falls (Submitted October 1, 2008 by Sue Ellen Maher)\n\nI want to thank my son, Stephen Flodeen, for all that he has done for his country.

S. Marine Corps. He was wounded on Guam and awarded a Purple Heart. As did so many, he suffered in some ways for the rest of his life as a consequence of the War. But he never complained and remained convinced that he had done the right thing in securing peace and security for others, at home and abroad.\n\nIn honor of Dale Forsman, Marine Corps - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Ely (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Brandy Forsman)\n\nWhen I wonder if I should hurry to make it to the polls on Tuesday, I will think of my grandfather, Dale Forsman. If he could land on Iwo Jima and dare to take each step across that beach, I can do the much easier job of voting well. How hard is reading about candidates and stopping by the polling place compared to his service? I want to know that I have chosen smart, caring people who will think hard about when and where they send our service members.\n\nIn honor of E7 Justin Fuchs, Air Force - Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: Lake City (Submitted September 15, 2008 by Barb Simon)\n\nJustin is a fine young man who came back from an 8 month tour in Iraq and has been a stable support in helping our family through a personal crisis. The Air Force not only trained Justin and his comrades to be good soldiers, but they educated them on how to help others who are victims of crimes. Justin supported our family in doing the tough work of confronting injustice and helped by giving ongoing positive support and advice.\n\nIn honor of Robert Gabrielson, Navy - Served in Vietnam\n\nHometown: Hibbing (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Sarah Gabrielson)\n\nMy dad, who served in Vietnam, never let me forget my responsibility to vote.

OOHRAH AND SEMPER FI\n\nIn honor of Walter Gaschott, US Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Whitestone, New York (Submitted August 21, 2008 by Nancy Gaschott)\n\nMy dad served during World War II with the Army's \"Big Red One.”Although he rarely talked about his service, our summer vacations were spent exclusively visiting one army buddy or other throughout the northeast. They fought in North Africa and Italy before preparing in England for the D-Day invasion. My dad's unit landed at Omaha Beach at 6:30 on the morning of D-Day. He remembered taking cover behind sand dunes and later how difficult the hedgerows of Normandy were to navigate around. He spent the last phases of the war in Belgium and finally Czechoslovakia. When he came home he married a neighborhood girl who had loved him since they were children and settled into factory work, fishing on weekends and raising a family -- a kind, generous, gentle man: my hero.\n\nIn honor of Sergeant John Gathje, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Wayne, NE (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Jon Gathje)\n\nMy grandpa.\n\nIn honor of Dick Gelbmann, US Army - Served in World War II\n\n(Submitted August 11, 2008 by Jim Gelbmann)\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, December 7, 1941, Dick Gelbmann and his high school friends were playing cards when they heard about the attack on Pearl Harbor. Although only 17-years-old, these young men decided that they would drop out of school and enlist in the Army the following morning. With his Grandparent's permission (his legal guardians), Dick arrived at the Army offices in St. Paul early Monday morning. Dick eventually was sent to Europe to fight under the command of General Patton. Although he saw significant combat during the Battle of the Bulge and was holed up for weeks at a time in fox holes on the front lines, Dick rarely talked about his combat experiences. Instead he focused on the more humane experiences, such as the ride across the Atlantic in a captured Italian freighter - where each man was allowed to spend only 15 minutes each day on deck breathing fresh air. He raved about the quality of the Army food - one of the few soldiers who actually liked the food. And he spoke about the ride back to the states on the Queen Mary after Germany surrendered. It was only after my dad's death in 2003 that I discovered his Army medals - including a bronze star, awarded to soldiers who distinguished themselves by heroic or meritorious achievement or service. My dad answered the call to service, but was one of many soldiers who opted to not share the horrific experiences of war with his family.\n\nIn honor of Matthew Giersdorf, US Army - Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: Moose Lake (Submitted September 18, 2008 by Carla Giersdorf)\n\nMy son, Matthew, served in Iraq for 15 months as a field medic. He returned home in June, 2008. It was at that time that we realized the stress we had been under. Many people said \"you must be so happy\". . . however, it was not happy that we were feeling, but instead relieved. Not happy, because other parents still have sons and daughters there. We are so very proud and honored that our son chose to serve our country! We want to thank ALL veterans from ALL wars. . . Thank You! God Bless our Country and our Freedom!\n\nIn honor of Sgt George Griffin, US Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: St. Paul (Submitted September 29, 2008 by Mary Hamilton)\n\nGeorge was 31, married with 2 children when he was drafted. He served with pride and when he came home, and for the rest of his life, he was a proud American and always had a flag raised high in the front yard.\n\nIn honor of Travis Grimm, Marine Corps\n\n(Submitted October 31, 2008 by Peg Chemberlin)\n\nAs Travis gets ready for his third tour of duty in Iraq we will vote, in order that democracy is never taken for granted and we will vote that this soldier's service is also not taken for granted.\n\nIn honor of TSgt.

Walker)\n\nGary served in the Navy Mobile Riverine forces in Vietnam for two years. He served with honor and distinction as an officer and holds that time with his friends there very dear. He and all service people who defended our country when called upon deserve our gratitude and praise. It was especially difficult for all those who served in Vietnam because there was no welcome when they got home. They came home to a nation that had not only turned against the war, but the men who were sent to fight it. They were treated with disdain and for that alone we need to honor all our Vietnam veterans. Gary is a great Minnesotan, and a great man.\n\nIn honor of Staff Sergeant Vernon Haben, Air Force - Served in Vietnam\n\nHometown: Circle Pines, MN (Submitted October 3, 2008 by James Haben)\n\nVernon Haben was a proud American. He believed in serving his country and giving back to those who gave so much to him. He believed in family first and was a very caring and strong man. He believed that every person deserved a good life and he gave his life based on these beliefs. He is loved and cherished by his wife, Marlys and his children, Michelle, James, Tim and Rita. He is greatly missed and for this we honor him during this election.\n\nIn honor of E5 Jeremy Hadfield, US Navy\n\nHometown: Monticello, MN (Submitted October 20, 2008 by Nick Hadfield)\n\nJeremy, you enrolled in the Navy for the difficult duty of defending our country during the past several years.

He served in the Asiatic-Pacific Theatre, Eniwetok, Saipan, and the Marshall Islands. He received the Bronze Star with Valor for his actions that helped save his fellow soldiers during WWII.\n\nIn honor of SSG Ryan Hallberg, US Army -Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: Andover (Submitted September 15, 2008 by Cheryl Berg)\n\nRyan Hallberg was deployed to Iraq in 2005. His job was to provide communications within the \"Green Zone\", however, when he heard of a fellow soldier who had a wife and two children back home and whose job was to be running convoy missions, he volunteered to take that soldier's place so that his fellow soldier had a better chance at returning home unharmed. As a result of his choice, Ryan was hit by an IED and lost a leg. He is truly an American hero.\n\nIn honor of Jarrett Halverson, US Army - Serving in Iraq\n\n(Submitted October 31, 2008 by Carol Just)\n\nDearest Jarrett.

Well Done!\n\nIn honor of Tech Sergeant Phillip Hanger, Air Force - Served in Desert Storm\n\nHometown: Glendale (Submitted November 1, 2009 by Mary Hanger)\n\nAlthough Phillip was stationed in Alamogordo, New Mexico at Holloman AFB, he and his squadron supported the war through their technical skills and knowledge. They were on call twenty four hours a day, seven days a week to support their mission. My husband and every other serviceman's commitment to that war was as valuable as those who were on the front line. My husband volunteered three times to go to Iraq but due to a respiratory illness he was denied. My husband was ready to give up his life for his country and those that served in the United States Air Forces because he believed in freedom. Thank you for your time.\n\nIn honor of PFC Daniel Hanson, Army National Guard - Serving in Iraq\n\nHometown: Detroit Lakes (Submitted September 15, 2008 by Steve Hanson)\n\nI couldn't be prouder of my son who chose to serve his Country by serving in the Armed Forces.\n\nIn honor of Captain Jim Hanson, Army National Guard - Served in Kosova\n\nHometown: Dodge Center (Submitted September 25, 2008 by Derek Skillman)\n\nCAPTAIN HANSON HAS BEEN SERVING THIS GREAT NATION FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES.

He landed D-Day Plus 60. He followed the armies that worked their way through Northern Europe--leap frogging from village to village, as the infantry took town by town. He ended up in Copenhagen, Denmark in December, 1945.\n\nIn honor of Corporal Ross Hardt, Army - Served in the Vietnam War\n\nHometown: Richfield, MN (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Paul Hardt)\n\nRoss was a mechanic with the 1st Air Cav in Viet Nam. He died in a helicopter accident in 1970. He was riding in a helicopter that was flying out to fix a copter that had gone down. He was married and he had a son on the way. He loved baseball. As Ross' brother, I feel fortunate that I have been able to experience so much of life that Ross was not able to experience, such as voting in this election.\n\nIn honor of David F.

He was one of the very first 112 soldiers of the 82nd Airborne who were sent over to Iraq during Desert Storm. With God at his side, he did his duty and returned home safely.\n\nIn honor of Major Bill Hecker, US Army - Served in Operation Iraqi Freedom\n\n(Submitted September 29, 2008 by Jack Scharrett)\n\nBill was an incredible person and leader. He was a classmate of mine in college and I had the privilege of getting to know him very well and spending great times with him, even though he was a Cardinals fan. After school, Bill went on to lead, mentor and inspire troops as a Field Artillery officer. While he grew as a professional, he grew as a family man increasing both his family at home with 3 children, but being ever more responsible to his professional family: the units he led. In January 2006, that all ended with an IED in Ramadi. Don't let his death be in vain. Let's win in Iraq and Afghanistan to honor those who have given their lives supporting those efforts.\n\nIn honor of Pfc Edward Herrgott, Army - Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: Shakopee, Minnesota (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Jessica Herrgott)\n\nI wish to honor Army Pfc.

Higgins. Originally from Mitchell, South Dakota, he was one of the many farm boys who served during World War II. He did several years of duty in the Navy aboard an LSM in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. I always thought it ironic that a man who did not particularly care for water or like to swim would choose to be a sailor, surrounded by salty seas so different from his much-loved Dakota prairies. But I think that shows how he was able to overcome any fears and do what he thought was right. He cherishes the years he spent in the Navy. In his own quiet way he was proud of being able to help his family back home while honoring his commitment to the United States. He thought the world of his fellow shipmates and the ships’ commanding officers. My dad’s personal qualities and unassuming character -- ingenuity, patience, openness, natural intelligence and his dry, subtle wit – were much appreciated by all. And still are to this day. Dad, I love you so very much. Thank you for all you have done for our family.\n\nIn honor of Alex Hill, Marine Corps - Served 2 tours in Iraq\n\nHometown: Embarrass (Submitted October 20, 2008 by Sarah Snyder)\n\nI am voting this year to honor my boyfriend, Alex.

I am also voting in memory of my brother Specialist Noah Pierce, Army. Noah served 2 tours in Iraq before taking his own life due to PSTD. Alex and Noah deserve this tribute as do ALL of our veterans.\n\nIn honor of Pvt.

Bryan does not take the freedoms we enjoy in our country for granted and is a living and loving example to us of the many brave men and women in our armed forces who serve valiantly. Our heartfelt thanks and love to you Bryan: Dad, Mom, Jenny, Kylah, Jon, Steve, Angela and Brittany\n\nIn honor of Earl Huber, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Saint Paul (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Natalie DeWitt)\n\nI vote this year in memory of my grandfather. He left us just about a year ago, but has gone to a better place. A brave and honest man, who stood for his country, and his family, in any time of need.

Joseph was at Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack, but was killed 9 months later on the USS San Francisco while saving another soldier. It was very hard for my father to accept the death of his brother.\n\nIn honor of CPL Rachael Hugo, Army Reserve - Served in Iraq\n\n(Submitted October 20, 2008)\n\nI am honoring Rachael L. Hugo. Rachael was a medic in the 79th Military Police Company, Rochester. MN. Rachael was deployed to Iraq in the fall of 2006 and while she was there she became known as \"Combat Barbie\". On October 5. 2007 Rachael was killed by in IED in Bayji, Iraq. We miss you Rachael and we will never forget you!!\n\nIn honor of Earl Ingebretsen, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Rural Felton, MN (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Loren Ingebretsen)\n\nEarl was my Dad. He passed away 1 year ago on Oct. 25. He served in the South Pacific during WWII. He was attached to a chemical warfare group. One of the jobs he did was drive his C. O. around. When they were in the Philippine Islands, they were camped in a farmers field and the C. O. made arrangements for compensating the person who owned the land for the use of it. When I was reading Dad's memoirs that he had been writing when he died, I found an entry that gave me an insight into the heart of my Dad. He talked about having met people who worked for that land owner and noticed how poorly nourished they were. He found someone who was harvesting brown rice and bought a bag of it for that family. I often wondered when I was young why we got letters at Christmas from a family in the Philippines. Dad just said they were friends, but I guess when you are hungry in a war torn country and a young man who has only the amount a soldier saves buys food to keep your family alive, maybe that is the reason. Later in his memoirs he talks about being asked to come to their home. Wars are won in many ways. Dad and his generation fought to save the world and in the process cemented friendships that they carried with them to their graves! God Bless the boys and girls that went and came home as men and women - who quietly went back to work, to build lives and rebuild a nation! Dad your son is so proud of you!\n\nIn honor of Captain Walter Jacobsen, US Navy\n\nHometown: St. Paul (Submitted August 29, 2008 by Judy Wertheimer)\n\nMy Dad and 6 others on board a plane were testing\n\nmaneuvers before a mission. They all lost their lives. I honor what my father stood for every day he lived and the pride and honor he passed on to his children. Thank you Dad for helping keep us safe.\n\nIn honor of Sergeant Shannon Janisewski, US Army - Served in Afghanistan - Operation Enduring Freedom\n\n(Submitted September 25, 2008 by Sarah Janisewski)\n\nShannon: Your service to country meant leaving your family behind, but knowing that freedom, hope and dreams for those who are oppressed would result.

Spending a year in Vietnam in a Tank makes me realize how easy I have it in the Air Force even when I am deployed.\n\nIn honor of E4 Charles Johnson, Army - Served in the Vietnam War\n\nHometown: Deer River (Submitted April 2, 2009 by Timothy Wasut)\n\nCharles Johnson has been an inspiration in my life. Spending a year in Vietnam in a Tank makes me realize how easy I have it in the Air Force when I am deployed.\n\nIn honor of Sergeant Harold Johnson, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Randolph, Minnesota (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Laurie Johnson)\n\nMy father is a WWII veteran. He fought in the First Special Service Force (a/k/a \"The Devil's Brigade\"), an American-Canadian unit. This group climbed up the back side of Mt. la Difensa which had been a German stronghold. From what I understand, allies had been trying to take this mountain for several weeks and suffered many casualties. My father's group took it in a few hours. However, while on top of the mountain, my father was hit in the chest and upper arms by shrapnel. Since his lungs would fill up with blood if he laid down, he had to walk down the mountain to get to an aide station (about a 5-6 hour walk down a goat trail). After the war, he returned home to Minnesota, married my mother and they raised 9 children and helped raise 16 grandchildren. The First Special Service Force has an annual reunion to this day. There have been a few in St. Paul and Minneapolis. In 2004, it was held in Minnetonka with a memorial service at the Airborne Circle at Fort Snelling and again in 2008.\n\nIn honor of PFC Kenneth Johnson, US Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Duluth, MN (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Jack Johnson)\n\nMy vote today was a salute to my father. He died many years ago, but no day passes without a thought of him, however fleeting. He was a member of the “greatest generation” and except for the years spent overseas during World War Two, he lived his entire life in Duluth—the only place he ever wanted to live. He landed at Normandy, fought his way through the fields and hedgerows of France with the 90th Division, and got a Purple Heart before returning to Duluth in the fall of 1945. One of my earliest memories is the night we waited for him to “come home from the war\" and when he finally came in the door he was wearing his uniform. He lifted me over his head, swung me around, hugged me tight, and held me on his lap for the longest time. I was 2-1/2. When he finally got home, Dad’s goal was to put the war behind him and get on with his life—which he did. But he had experienced terrible things and the war never really left him. In that respect he was like millions of other veterans. Thanks, dad, for all you gave and thanks, too, to all our veterans whose sacrifices made it possible for me and my younger sister to cast our votes today.\n\nIn honor of Nate Johnson, Army - Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: St. James (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Lee Carlson)\n\nI am happy to vote In honor of Nate Johnson, a former student and player of mine at SJHS. We were able to talk before he left and corresponded during his stay. His courage while serving his country was admirable but equally admirable was the service he showed to his host country and he worked to provide benefits to Iraqi schoolchildren. Upon returning to the States after his stint he looked for ways to serve his country back stateside. He is a great example of why we need to support all of our youth in school and extracurricular activities as he used these opportunities to protect and serve our country while leading others.\n\nIn honor of Reuben Johnson, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Minneapolis, MN (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Lauri Svedberg)\n\nMy grandfather, Reuben F. Johnson, served our country in WWI and was a proud lifelong member/officer of the American Legion. He was part of a \"tontine\"---a group of soldiers who bought a bottle of wine upon discharge and pledged to save it until the last man was alive. Six decades later, when Grampa and one other buddy were left, they decided to hold a ceremony to share the bottle. It was a touching tribute to the lasting friendships formed in the military.\n\nIn honor of Reuben F Johnson, Army\n\nHometown: Chisago City, MN (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Jane Svedberg-Ballard)\n\nMy grandfather was a brave man who served his country well.

After living in a center for children in Holland for two years, he and his family made it to America. Upon completion of high school in the US, he joined the Army and went back to Europe to fight the Nazis. He was a paratrooper and landed in a glider behind enemy lines less than a mile from his hometown in Borken Germany. He went back to Borken to find it had been bombed. His old neighbors recognized him and wanted to know why the allies had bombed their churches! He earned 2 purple hearts and a bronze star.\n\nIn honor of Jerry Jorgenson, US Army - Served in Viet Nam\n\nHometown: Fairmont (Submitted November 11, 2008 by Alyson Strobel)\n\nAlways remembered!

I'm waiting and praying. I'm on pins & needles. I toss and turn all night. He's my last thought before I finally fall asleep at night; my first when I wake each morning. I'm a Soldier’s Mom - but do not weep for me. I hear his words. I see his face and his posture as he says, \"Mom. I'm ready to go. I'm prepared to go. It's my job to go. I'll volunteer to go. I need to get my mind set to go\" I'm a Soldier's Mom ~ but do not weep for me. For me For you For our children and our children's children. For our Country For their Country. I'm a Soldier's Mom ~ but do not weep for me. I'm proud of my son's Patriotism, Inner strength, Vision, Dreams, Desire, Willingness. I'm proud to be an American. I'm proud to be Free. Yes ~ I'm a Soldier's Mom ~ but do not weep for me. I will be voting In honor of all our sons and daughters who have and continue to serve our Country.\n\nIn honor of John Kelly, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Minneapolis (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Kathleen Kelly)\n\nThis year I pledge my vote In honor of my late father. Dad, your generation's lives were forever changed by two cataclysmic events - the Great Depression and WWII. You handled both with grace and honor. Thank you so much for your service and for instilling in me your sense of fairness and love of country.\n\nIn honor of John Kelly, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Minneapolis, MN (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Terry Kilian)\n\nWhat a privilege it is to write a tribute to my dad, John M. Kelly, a WW II veteran. He really did not say to much about the war. He said \"the heroes are the ones buried over there\". He was on a ship to Australia. Most of the food on the ship was spoiled, even the bread was moldy. He was stationed in Iran, called Persia at that time. He was a supply sergeant. He told us they would buy a goat from the locals and roast it on a Saturday night. When my sister and I were going through some of his pictures we found one that showed whole streets with bodies hanging from gallows. He did not come home from the war until I was almost 4 years old. He was a stranger to me then, but he is a hero to me now. My election day will be filled with his memory.\n\nIn honor of Corporal Kareem Rashad Sulton Khan, Army, Served in Iraq\n\nHometown: Manahawkin, New Jersey (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Gene Christensen)\n\nThere are so many of my peers I could honor. My father is a Silver and Bronze Star decorated WWII vet. My recently deceased uncle, also a WWII vet. But I choose to honor this person I have only met through Colin Powell. A Muslim who gave his life for our country in part to teach us that Muslims too are patriotic Americans.\n\nIn honor of Marcellus Kilian, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: St. Michael (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Debby Dahlheimer)\n\nI would like to pay tribute to my father who instilled in me a love of my country. He served in World War II and truly is one of the greatest generation. He was willing to give all for his country. He and I have loyalties to different parties and disagree on different issues, but I will always remember he was part of the reason I am able to vote and live freely. Thanks Dad.\n\nIn honor of John Kissel, Navy - Served in World War II and Korea\n\nHometown: Minneapolis (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Dianne Sonstelie)\n\nTo John, a fine citizen, who served his country at a very early age. Disappointed that he could not enlist with the army because of flat feet, he was eager to join the U. S. Navy that did not have that criteria. He told me of going to all the offices, anxious to join and help with the war effort. With the U. S. Navy during World War II, he was a gunner aboard ships in the Atlantic and Pacific. During siege, he saw fellow sailors lose their lives. I wish I could remember and that he was alive to tell me more of the events. Their ships were in many ports around the world. After the war, he re-enlisted and served more years. He served as an aircraft mechanic in several naval stations and ended his career as a recruiter. He daily flew the U. S. flag at his home and many events. He was a wonderful father. He was our dad!\n\nIn honor of John Kissel, Navy\n\nHometown: Minneapolis (Submitted December 12, 2009 by Paulette Kissel-Shreve)\n\nI know that each member of my family has their own memories of my Father. His first career was 20 years in the Navy. When I refer to him in the time since he has passed, my thoughts go to something that I read. I could find no author it belongs to. But, for me it had special significance. \"It is the VETERAN, not the preacher, who has given us freedom of religion. It is the VETERAN, not the reporter, who has given us freedom of the press. It is the VETERAN, not the poet, who has given us freedom of speech. It is the VETERAN, not the campus organizer, who has given us freedom to assemble. It is the VETERAN, not the lawyer, who has given us the right to a fair trial. It is the VETERAN, not the politician, who has given us the right to vote. It is the VETERAN, who salutes the flag. “ I would add that my Father was this, and so much more. He was a loving man of great faith and strong convictions. He was not a perfect man who accepted imperfections in others. I think if I could choose the most important aspect that I loved about him, it would be his willingness to help everyone that he came in contact with. He had a wonderful voice, a gentle heart, loved dogs and always had a smile when he heard the laughter of his grandchildren. On birthdays and Christmas I will always miss the call from him with a special song. Love you Dad.\n\nIn honor of HM1 Donald Kleinfelder, Navy - Serving in Iraq\n\nHometown: Bellevue, WA (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Jim & Dianne Kleinfelder)\n\nAn 18 year man, with a family, Donald is serving his country with honor. Currently serving in Iraq, we could not be prouder of him and his dedication to duty.\n\nIn honor of James Kleinfelder, Navy - Served in Vietnam War\n\nHometown: Moorhead, MN (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Dianne Kleinfelder)\n\nMy husband served his country for 25 years, traveling the world in service of his country, including in-country in Vietnam from 1967-1968 with the Seabees. He is proud not only of his service, but that of his sister's son and step-son, and all those who are proud of their service.\n\nIn honor of Bernard Klejeski, Army - Served in Vietnam\n\nHometown: Barnum, MN (Submitted November 4, 2008 by Sue Powell)\n\nThis tribute is for my dad and all the other men and women who have sacrificed for my right to vote!\n\nIn honor of Lt. Cmdr. Gordon Kobernat, Navy - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Cloquet (Submitted March 2, 2010 by Richard Kobernat)\n\nTo my Dad for serving our country in WWII in the US Navy. I followed him in the navy in Vietnam. Thanks!!!\n\nIn honor of James Kost, US Army - Served in Vietnam\n\nHometown: St. Cloud (Submitted October 1, 2008 by Sara Kost)\n\nI never got to meet my Grandfather, James Kost. Sadly, he committed suicide before I was born. My family doesn't talk about it much, but from what I can gather, he had PTSD from what he saw in Vietnam. His experiences led to his depression and eventually the taking of his own life. I want to honor my grandpa this year by voting against this war and for improved Veterans' care. I don't want to see more men and women follow my grandpa's footsteps into depression.\n\nIn honor of Specialist Joshua Kulzer, Army National Guard - Serving in Iraq\n\nHometown: Shakopee (Submitted September 15, 2008 by Richard G. Evans)\n\nBesides spending a several extra months in Iraq, my friend Joshua had actually re-enlisted knowing he very well might be sent over as a result. He had already served his active time and had no obligation to do so. Because of his example and that of his family, I have learned much about the military (being a civilian myself) and am now a part of a group called Vets for Freedom as a result. God bless Josh, Liz and Mallory!\n\nIn honor of Robert Kumor, Army - Served in World War II\n\nHometown: Chicopeed, MA (Submitted October 31, 2008 by Chris Channing)\n\nMy grandfather served this"
