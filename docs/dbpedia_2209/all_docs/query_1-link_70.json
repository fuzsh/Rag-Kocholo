        "text": "LONDON -- Paul Lawrie's surprising victory in the British Open suddenly turned the anonymous Scotsman into one of the most high-profile athletes in Britain, where champions have become few and far between in recent times.\n\nHe made the European Ryder Cup team and jumped 111 places in the world rankings with his Open victory over the tough Carnoustie course.\n\nAnd along the way he became the first qualifier to win the Open since exemptions were introduced and the first Scot to win in Scotland since 1910.\n\nThe morning after winning a four-hole, three-way playoff, the 30-year-old Lawrie -- who had won only twice in a pro career stretching back to 1986 -- was the toast of Britain.\n\n\"There were a lot of people at the house this morning and everything is just about sinking in,\" he told a press conference on Monday. \"The Claret Jug is there and my name's engraved on it.\"\n\n\"Obviously now I've realized that, yes, I have won the Open.\"\n\nLawrie was pictured on the front or back page of every national British newspaper Monday either holding the famous trophy aloft or kissing the silverware.\n\n\"I won't change, not one little bit. But financially, things will change a lot,\" said Lawrie during the media conference at his Aberdeen home.\n\nHe's planning to buy a Ferrari and a new home with the $553,000 winners' purse. With endorsements and sponsorships sure to follow, Lawrie says his family is \"set up for life.\"\n\nJean Van de Velde's last-hole debacle at the 18th -- when he squandered a three-stroke lead with a triple bogey -- made Lawrie's stunning win possible.\n\nWith a final round 4-under-par 67, which left him 6-over for the tournament, Lawrie played his part in erasing the 10-stroke advantage Van de Velde held over him going into Sunday's round.\n\n\"Great Scot\" read a typical headline. Monday's Daily Mail described Lawrie's win with the one-word headline \"Unbelievable,\" while the tabloid Mirror said: \"Lawrie Runs Van Off The Road.\"\n\nOther media described the win as \"The Homecoming.\"\n\nLawrie lives with his wife and two sons in Aberdeen, barely a one-hour drive from the Carnoustie course.\n\nHe became the first Scot to win the Open since Sandy Lyle in 1985, although Lyle, who won at Sandwich, was born in England of Scottish parents.\n\nSo the home of golf has a new champion.\n\nLawrie jumped from 28th to No. 2 in the European Ryder Cup standings and now has enough points to virtually guarantee a spot in Europe's 10-man team for the September showdown against the United States.\n\n\"I am really looking forward to it,\" said Lawrie of his pending Ryder Cup debut. \"I cannot wait to get there.\"\n\nHe sits behind six-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie and in front of Darren Clarke and Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal in the Ryder Cup standings.\n\nWhen the latest world rankings were released Monday, Lawrie had cruised from 159th into 48th place in the standings.\n\nThe rewards, apart from the fast car, will follow.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to everyone,\" he said referring to a flood of calls from potential sponsors."
