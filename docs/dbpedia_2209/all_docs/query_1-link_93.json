        "text": "NFGF 2014\n\nOn Tuesday the 20th of May 2014, friends and family gathered to pay their respects at Neil’s funeral at Aberdeen Crematorium\n\nNeil’s body was transported home from the USA kindly by many whom he had been working with during his time there and people he had met\n\nThere was a contribution at Neil’s service where £1800 was raised, this money was presented to The Paul Lawrie Foundation and asked to be used to help fund and nourish young raw talent in the North East of Scotland in the hope that someone may be able to follow in Neil’s footsteps and succeed in the USA\n\nThe Neil Fyfe Golf Foundation was created by The Fyfe Family to honour Neil’s memory\n\nOn the 6th of October 2014 a group of friends whom Neil was suppose to join on a golfing holiday to Portugal decided not to cancel and make it all about Neil. A trophy was made and the 6 friends battled it out over 5 days to see who would claim the first shield\n\nGeorge and Steve Milne were the worthy winners but it was a mixed bag of emotions due to the loss of such a great friend and the reality of it all once the competition ended\n\nWhat did come out of the holiday was the need to continue the great gesture by the Fyfe family to make sure Neil’s name would be remembered for the right reasons and not the manner he was killed.\n\nThe foundations were laid by taking this trophy “The Neil Fyfe Memorial Cup” and feelings generated by the Original Six home to Scotland, where we would organise a annual golf outing and all proceeds would be contributed to the Neil Fyfe Golf Foundation.\n\nAt the end of 2014 Steve Fyfe received some very comforting news that the annual caddy competition at the Golden Bears Club would be in Neil’s Honour, putting the flags at half mast and all players wearing a blue and white ribbon in Neil’s memory and a touch of class to where he was born.\n\nThis competition is an annual event and contributes to Neil’s memory in the sport he loved, a lovely gesture from all Neil’s co-workers and the whole Golden Bear Franchise.\n\n4\n\n5\n\nPAUL LAWRIE GOLF CENTRE\n\nPAUL LAWRIE\n\nCONTACT\n\nPAUL LAWRIE FOUNDATION\n\nSouth Deeside Road\n\nAberdeen\n\nAB12 5YN\n\nGOLF CENTRE PAUL LAWRIE"
