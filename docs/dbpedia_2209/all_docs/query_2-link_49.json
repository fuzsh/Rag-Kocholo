        "text": "Whichever way you look at it, United Kingdom golf is in decent shape.\n\nAfter Paul Lawrie's Open win of 1999, external began a period of 11 years without a UK major winner, home players (more specifically, those from Northern Ireland) have claimed four of the last 11.\n\nIn that time, three men from the UK - Rory McIlroy, Luke Donald and Lee Westwood, external - have perched on top of the world rankings, while the likes of Justin Rose, Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell are regularly in and around the top 10.\n\nThere is, however, one last frontier for the UK pack to rule over: the Masters.\n\nThe 2013 tournament marks 25 years since Sandy Lyle became the first UK golfer to win at Augusta,, external a win that was followed by three more home wins in as many years - two by Nick Faldo and one by Ian Woosnam.\n\nHowever, since Faldo won in 1996,, external no player has bought a Green Jacket back to the British Isles.\n\nWith the help of Peter Alliss and Ken Brown, BBC Sport assesses the UK challenge.\n\nAge: 23 World ranking: 2\n\nMasters history: Led for three rounds in 2011 before a catastrophic final-day 80, external saw him slide to a tie for 15th, his best finish in four trips down Magnolia Lane.\n\nThe other majors: Bounced back from the Augusta disappointment to destroy the US Open field two months later. Followed that up with another dominant performance at last year's US PGA to become the youngest double major-winner since Seve Ballesteros.\n\nForm: Struggled in the aftermath of a high-profile equipment change in January, a controversial withdrawal at The Honda Classic part of a poor run that saw him replaced as world number one by Tiger Woods. A late decision to play in the Texas Open paid dividends, though, with a second-placed finish sending the Northern Irishman to Georgia in better touch.\n\nAlliss's verdict: \"After all the furore about changing clubs and equipment I think he's managed to adjust remarkably well. Finishing second last week was just the right sort of tune-up. He is so powerful, not a big man, but hits the ball miles. Very exciting to watch, and stands out head and shoulders above the rest.\"\n\nAge: 32 World ranking: 3\n\nMasters history: Has not missed the cut in seven trips to Augusta. Was only one off the lead before the final round in 2007,, external but ended up in a tie for fifth, while a late charge last time took Rose into the top 10.\n\nThe other majors: Has only managed five top-10 finishes, including his breakthrough performance at the 1998 Open when, as an amateur, he shared the lead with Woods before finishing fourth.\n\nForm: Consistent. Four top-10 finishes in 2013 have seen the Hampshire native climb to a career-high third in the world., external\n\nAlliss's verdict: \"He must be in with a chance because he's played well here in the past. His professional career started so slowly and miserably and people wondered whether he was going to make it and then suddenly, with the same sort of game, he's become a very proficient player. He's long enough, seems to have good nerves and manages the course pretty well.\"\n\nAge: 39 World ranking: 13\n\nMasters history: Knows what it is like to lead a Masters final round, only to be denied by an inspired Phil Mickelson in 2010., external Led again after day one last year, eventually finishing tied third when some better putting would have probably been enough for at least a place in the play-off.\n\nThe other majors: Perhaps vying with Colin Montgomerie for the tag of 'best UK golfer not to have won a major'. Of course, Westwood will have more chances, but after nine top-five major finishes, he must wonder if the big prize will ever come.\n\nForm: A move to Florida and a new adjustable, long-handled putter are yet to produce consistently good results, but there were some encouraging signs at the Houston Open before a final-round falter.\n\nBrown's verdict: \"Westwood has made a massive decision to move from Worksop to live in Florida, solely with the purpose of trying to win majors. The big attribute is he can practice 365 days a year. He's had chances to win here, he's been out in the last group, and he knows he can win here. For him, the question is whether his putting is sound. In recent weeks he's done OK with a new putter, so he's got every chance.\"\n\nAge: 33 World ranking: 17\n\nMasters history: Showed signs last year that he was getting to grips with the Augusta National in what was his fifth trip to Georgia. A strong final day saw the Northern Irishman break into the top 15 for the first time.\n\nThe other majors: With an ice-cool nerve that would later win the Ryder Cup for Europe, McDowell ended the UK's 11-year wait for a major champion with a one-shot victory at the 2010 US Open., external\n\nForm: Has looked in good touch, particularly at the WGC event at Doral when a final-day fade ended his challenge to Woods, but was disappointing last time out at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.\n\nAlliss's verdict: \"He's a mercurial, flashy player and gutsy. Can I see him winning around here? He doesn't stand out, but having said that over the years we have had people like Mike Weir or Angel Cabrera, wonderful ball strikers who have had good fortune here and a bit of bad luck for others there.\"\n\nAge: 35 World ranking: 4\n\nMasters history: Has enjoyed the Masters more than any other major, notching up three top-10 finishes. Finished third to be top European in 2005, external and was in the pack that was eventually trumped by Charl Schwartzel in 2011.\n\nThe other majors: Has only managed four top-five finishes away from Augusta, including the 2006 US PGA,, external where the Englishman led for three rounds before falling away at the last.\n\nForm: Currently lacking the consistency that saw him regularly ranked as number one in the world until August last year. Looked to be running into some form with a fourth-placed finish in Tampa Bay only to miss his first cut in 119 European Tour events in Malaysia a week later.\n\nAlliss's verdict: \"I love watching him play. He goes about his business quietly and he's well balanced. Whether he is just powerful enough, I don't know. They talk about big hitters winning here but, over the years, many players have won this that have not been monster hitters - it's always been a mixture of bits and pieces.\"\n\nAge: 44 World ranking: 34\n\nMasters history: Poor. On six trips to Augusta, Lawrie has missed the cut on three occasions, with a tie for 15th his best finish.\n\nThe other majors: Has only ever recorded two top-10 major finishes, but one of those was the glory of the 1999 Open at Carnoustie., external Beginning the final round 10 shots back, Lawrie took advantage of Jean van de Velde's meltdown to win a play-off and complete the biggest come-from-behind win in Open history.\n\nForm: Little to speak of, but has been hampered by injuries. Finished in a tie for seventh at the Volvo Golf Champions event in January, but has since failed to break the top 50 in three other strokeplay tournaments.\n\nAlliss's verdict: \"One of the most underrated players for years, though some of that is down to him. He's realised what a good ball striker he is and he's stopped complaining to himself and got on with it. He's getting rid of that self doubt.\"\n\nDavid Lynn (England) - makes his first Masters appearance, external as a result of his surprise second-place finish behind McIlroy at last year's US PGA Championship.\n\nAlan Dunbar (Northern Ireland) - the 22-year-old won last year's British Amateur Championship and could turn professional after his maiden outing at Augusta.\n\nMartin Laird (Scotland) - returns for a third successive Masters as the final man to qualify thanks to his Texas Open victory last weekend.\n\nJamie Donaldson (Wales) - the world number 33 arrives for his Masters bow on the back of the biggest win of his career at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship in January.\n\nSandy Lyle (Scotland) and Ian Woosnam (Wales) - the men that all other UK players in the field are looking to emulate. The veterans return to Augusta as past winners of the Green Jacket: Lyle, in 1988, the first UK winner of the Masters; Woosnam following three years later, external after back-to-back Nick Faldo triumphs."
