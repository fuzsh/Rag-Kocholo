        "text": "Aberdeen Asset Management is delighted to announce the winner of its competition to ‘Design a Board’ at the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open, held at Castle Stuart Golf Links, 11 – 14 July 2013.\n\nJamie Walker, aged 13 from Kilchuimen Academy, Fort Augustus, has won the competition after his artwork was selected from hundreds of entries by Scottish golfer and Aberdeen Asset Management ambassador, Paul Lawrie.\n\nJamie said: \"I'm really thrilled to have won this prize and I'm looking forward to seeing the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open with my family. It's an honour for the school as well, but I think it's my dad who is the most excited of all!\"\n\nChildren aged under 16 at schools and golf clubs in the Highlands and Islands area were invited to submit a piece of artwork depicting ‘Golf in the Highlands’, which will be turned into a 2.4m x 1m on-course board, on display throughout the four day tournament.\n\nThe board is currently in production and will be seen by some of the best professional golfers in the world as they compete in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open, as well as thousands of spectators and a global TV audience.\n\nIn addition to having his artwork turned into a course board the tournament, Jamie and his family have been invited to the Aberdeen Asset Management Pavilion for afternoon tea during the tournament. £1,000 of junior golf equipment will also be donated to Kilchuimen Academy.\n\nMaria Gibbons, Head Teacher of Kilchuimen Academy, said: \"It was a great pleasure for all at Kilchuimen Academy to hear that Jamie's entry had been chosen as the winning design. I would like to offer sincere thanks to the sponsors and organisers of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open. A national event like this provides sporting inspiration for young people and it becomes an even more powerful force for good when it also encourages talent in other fields.\"\n\nRunner-up, Kieran Maclean, aged 10 from Portree Primary School, will receive five tickets to the tournament, an Aberdeen golf pack, and £250 in junior golf equipment for his school.\n\nA prize will be awarded to Matilda McKiggan, aged 9, also of Portree Primary School, for the best artwork by a child aged under 10. Matilda wins an Aberdeen golf pack and £250 in junior golf equipment donated to her school.\n\nPaul Lawrie said: “I was very impressed by the high standard of entries and I enjoyed seeing how children from the Highlands area depicted ‘Golf in the Highlands’. Some of the entries were exceptionally creative and detailed, and some were very quirky and made me laugh. I look forward to seeing Jamie’s colourful artwork in amongst the traditional advertising boards on the course when I am playing in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.”"
