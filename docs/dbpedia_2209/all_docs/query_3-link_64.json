        "text": "August is here, and I’ve already started to see Halloween decorations popping up. So, when it is too early to get ready for Halloween? Frankly, the moment we hit mid-July, I started to see Halloween displays start to go up at stores, along with back-to-school supplies. Before we know it, stores will sell Christmas trees in July, and not because of “Christmas in July.”\n\nIs It Too Early to Get Ready for Halloween in August?\n\nIf there’s one indication of the Halloween season officially starting on Aug. 1, it’s the fact that Spirit Halloween opens its stores on that date. So, if you’re driving around your area, don’t be surprised if you see a Spirit Halloween suddenly pop up in an abandoned warehouse or other retail building. I’ve already seen a Spirit Halloween near me, but as much as I love Halloween, it just feels too early to get ready for Halloween right now.\n\nSpirit Halloween is actually the largest Halloween retailer in North America. “With 1,525 seasonal locations opening soon in strip centers and malls across North America, Spirit is the one-stop destination for all things Halloween,” they explain. “For more than four decades, Spirit has created immersive and interactive experiences for shoppers, complete with a unique and vast assortment of costumes and accessories for infants, toddlers, children, ‘tweens, teens, and adults, along with exclusive décor and animatronics you won’t find anywhere else.”\n\nWe’re having 90 degree temperatures right now where I live. I love the idea of celebrating all of the major holidays for three months, with Halloween being in August, September and October and Christmas being in November, December and, yes, January. Don’t judge. But, trying on Halloween costumes when it’s 95 degrees outside just doesn’t feel right to me. So, why do Halloween decorations and costumes start going up so early? There’s the idea in retail that if you get customers to purchase holiday items early, they’ll purchase more overall. I totally feel this is true. I remember buying a Halloween costume that I loved in early September, but then by the time Halloween rolled around, I wanted to be something else, so I ended up buying two costumes that year.\n\nSo, is it too early to get ready for Halloween in August? I say, do whatever makes you happy. The stores are open, and the displays are up. Some of my friends even like decor with skulls and bones year-round, so this is the perfect time for them to stock up. Halloween is just supposed to be fun, so enjoy it. Contact me with your thoughts, and happy “Summerween.” Check out one of my favorite Halloween costumes below.\n\nAnne Erickson started her radio career shortly after graduating from Michigan State University and has worked on-air in Detroit, Flint, Toledo, Lansing and beyond.
