        "text": "Each player will start at the 1st tee and will have 36 shots to see how far they can get around the course. Once they have completed 36 shots a ‘flag’ is dropped at the finishing position. The top four players who have reached the furthest hole will get to represent the club at the Regional event.\n\nIn 2021, over 1,000 juniors competed in the Junior Flag Challenge from across Scotland, and Saline Golf Club won the trophy and were crowned the Scottish Junior Flag Champions!\n\nSteven Miller, Junior Convener, Saline Golf Club said: “We are so proud of the boys and their achievement in this competition. Saline Juniors only started up in April this year, and already the kids are playing in major competitions and bringing back trophies. Thanks, has to go to Scottish Golf for providing clubs in Scotland with a platform to encourage the next generation into golf.”\n\nGregg Somerville, Junior Golf Scotland said: “I first met the teams from Saline Golf Club at Dunfermline Golf Club for their regional final in early August. The boys were enthusiastic and keen to have fun out on the course, which is what these events were all about. They managed to get through the regional final successfully fending off 8 other teams and earning their spot at the National Final at Gleneagles. The final at Gleneagles it was much the same story, they were there to enjoy themselves and have a good day. Being the second game out, it was up to them to set the target to beat and what a target they set! It was a close-run event with the team from Carnoustie Golf Links and Royal Dornoch just a handful of points behind! In the end the juniors from Saline were victorious over the 13 regional winners. To find out that Saline Golf Club have only recently started working on a junior section makes their victory all the more impressive. Well done to all at Saline Golf Club and I look forward to seeing them next year to defend their title!”\n\nIn 2020 Scottish Golf announced a new series of events in partnership with the Stephen Gallacher Foundation, Paul Lawrie Foundation and The Junior Flag Challenge. The first ever Scottish Junior Flag Championship will see all three organisations work together with golf clubs to increase the provision of Flag Golf Events for junior golfers across the country.\n\nTaking place in all regions of Scotland, the Championship is designed to create playing opportunities for golfers in the early stages of their development while also supporting golf clubs to retain more junior members. This will be achieved by introducing golfers, who are under the age of 12 and without a handicap, to competitive golf in a fun and friendly environment."
