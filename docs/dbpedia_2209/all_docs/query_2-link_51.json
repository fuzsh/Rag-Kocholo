        "text": "GENERAL COMPETITION RULES\n\nHOME NATIONS INTER-CLUB CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL 2023 - 24\n\n​\n\nJUNIOR TEAM GOLF PROMOTES:-\n\nTEAMWORK\n\nRESPECT\n\nENJOYMENT\n\nDISCIPLINE\n\nSPORTSMANSHIP\n\nAt all our events\n\n1. AGE\n\nThe R&A definition of “junior” applies, i.e. a junior golfer is an amateur golfer who had not reached his/her 18th birthday prior to the 1st January 2023.\n\n2. HANDICAPS\n\n2.1 The maximum WHS handicap index for all players is 20.4 for both boys and girls, though those with higher handicaps may of course still play, but off the maximum handicap index. Participating clubs must ensure that every player has a handicap index that reflects his or her true ability.\n\n2.2 Full names of all players together with age, birthday, WHS number, and current handicap index must be submitted to JTG prior to 18.03.24\n\n2.3 All players must be registered with WHS and have a current handicap index when they are presented by the Team Manager to play in JTGHN Final.\n\n2.4 Prior to the JTGHN Final. all players must have participated in at least ten qualifying rounds in the twelve months to 18.03.24. The Organisers may relax this rule if there are exceptional circumstances such as prolonged medically certified illness or absence through the prior claims of international representation. In any such cases, JTG must receive a letter signed by the club secretary/manager, and countersigned by the Club Captain, stating that the player’s handicap index is a true reflection of his/her current playing ability, and that he/she is a bona fide member of the Club.\n\n2.5 Players individual handicap indices will not change during the JTGHN Final. This is a Matchplay only event.\n\n2.6 Boys will play off the WHITE tees and girls will play off the RED tees.\n\n3. TEAM SELECTION\n\n3.1 Teams will consist of squads of up to ten players drawn from players who have participated in qualifying rounds for the Home Nations Championships Finals (including National Finals). See Rule 2.4 above.\n\n3.2 The nominated squad of eight to play in round 1 of competition on Day 2 must be submitted to the Championship Director immediately after the practice rounds or prior to 16.00 on the practice day, (Day 1), whichever is the earlier.\n\n3.3 The nominated squad of eight to play in round 2 of competition on Day 2 must be submitted to the Championship Director prior to 12.00 on the day, (Day 2).\n\n3.4 The nominated squad of eight to play in round 3 of competition on Day 3 must be submitted to the Championship Director prior to 18.00 on Day 2.\n\n4. COMPETITION FORMAT DAYS 2 & 3 – MATCH PLAY\n\n(‘Rubber’ is any two ball between two players: ‘Match’ refers to all eight rubbers between two teams).\n\n4.1 The 4 participating teams will be termed teams A, B, C & D by random draw to be undertaken as teams register prior to their practice rounds.\n\n4.2 In round 1, morning of Day 2, Team A will play against Team B and Team C will play against Team D.\n\nEach match will consist of 8 rubbers which will be played in 4 x 4-Balls. The 4-Balls will alternate on the tee. AvB(i) followed by CvD(i) followed by AvB(ii) and so on.\n\n4.3 In round 2, afternoon of Day 2, the winner of AvB will play against the loser of CvD and the winner of CvD will play against the loser of AvB. Again each match will consist of 8 rubbers which will be played in 4 x 4-Balls. The 4-Balls will alternate on the tee as in the morning round.\n\nIn the event of two teams playing a tie in Round 1, for the purposes of determining “who plays who” in Round 2 “a notional winner” shall be determined as follows:-\n\nThe winning / losing margin i.e. the number of holes not played in each rubber will be credited or debited to each of the teams, as appropriate.\n\nThe team with, in total, more credit than debit holes will proceed as the “winner”. If the teams are still tied a coin will be tossed by the Competition Director between the two team captains.\n\n4.4 In round 3, morning of Day 3, the teams which have not yet played against each other will play against each other. Each match will consist of 8 rubbers which will be played as 8 x 2-Balls. Unlike rounds 1 and 2 (see §4.2 and §4.3), each match will be played in consecutive rubbers, with a gap between to allow the camera team to reset. The order of play for Day 3 will be announced after Day 2 play is completed.\n\n4.5 On Day 2, rubbers shall be played until a result is determined and the players will then stop playing and leave the course. A rubber which is all square after 18 holes will be deemed a draw.\n\nOn Day 3, all rubbers will continue to the 18th hole. This will ensure that all players may be filmed by the camera crew and/or interviewed. Additionally if there is a tie between teams when considering the match results, then the scores in all 8 rubbers after 18 holes will be used as a tie break.\n\n4.6 The winning team in each match will be awarded 3 points. If a match is tied, both teams will receive 1 point. The championship league table will be updated on completion of each round\n\n4.7 Ties\n\nIf there is a tie in the league table after completion of round 3, then tiebreaks will be applied in the following order until a championship result is reached.\n\n1. Points for Day 3 will be re-allocated according to the results after 18 holes.\n\n2. The differential of total rubbers won and lost in matches played between the tied teams over all 3 rounds will be added together, with the tied team with the greatest differential being the winner.\n\n​ 3. The championship will be deemed a tie.\n\n5. DISTANCE MEASURING DEVICES, CADDIES / BAG CARRIERS / TROLLEY PULLERS\n\n5.1 DMD’s are permitted to be used as long as they are not used for any purpose other than distance measurement, as per R & A rule 4-3a(1).\n\n5.2 Players may use an electric or pull trolley. Caddies / bag carriers / trolley pullers are not allowed.\n\n5.3 It is a condition of the JTG competition that mobile telephones are not to be used on the course other than in an emergency.\n\n6. SLOW PLAY\n\n6.1 Slow play will not be tolerated. Players will be expected to keep up behind the match in front. Particularly slow play by an individual will result in a verbal warning.\n\n6.2 The Championship Referee will reserve the right to enforce, under R & A rule 5.6(a), the following penalties:\n\n1st offence, Verbal Warning\n\n2nd offence, General Penalty – loss of hole\n\n3rd offence, Disqualification.\n\nA Verbal Warning and General Penalty will carry forward and apply throughout the event.\n\nAny player disqualified in a match will not be available for selection in their team’s next match of the competition.\n\n7. PLAYING KIT – TELEVISION REQUIREMENT\n\n7.1 Team Playing kit on all three days will conform to normal golf competition standards.\n\n7.2 Each team should have at least two different coloured playing uniforms available for competition rounds.\n\n7.3 Please note that at the request of the TV production unit, teams may be asked to switch to their alternative playing colours if team colours are deemed to clash.\n\n8. SUPPORTERS\n\n8.1 Supporters must keep to the edges of the fairways and off the greens, and remain at least 25 metres from the players throughout play unless helping find a ‘lost ball’ (see below). Spectator Buggies (if the conditions permit) must stay off the fairways at all times.\n\n8.2 No advice on rulings, coaching or otherwise, may be given to the players on the course. However, supporters are encouraged to ball-spot and help look for lost balls for all players. (Please observe Parental Guidance Notice).\n\n8.3 Rules queries will only be dealt with by the Championship Referees. Neither Junior Organisers/Convenors nor any walking scorers are permitted to act as rules officials in any way shape or form. In addition, whilst walking between green and tee, team managers may enquire about the individual match position or convey news about overall match positions etc.\n\n8.4 It is a player’s responsibility to report during, or immediately after the round, to the Referee or Championship Director, any “communication” with his or her opponent by a supporter, other than is indicated above as being acceptable.\n\nAny breach of this rule may lead to the application of penalties as indicated in §6.2. The organisers reserve the right to disqualify individuals, or the whole team, for persistent transgression of this rule.\n\n9. BEHAVIOUR\n\nThe organisers reserve the right to apply severe future sanctions on any club whose team members behave unacceptably, on or off the course. It is the responsibility of the Chef de Missions and the Team Managers to ensure that the behaviour of their team members including players, officials and supporters does not breach acceptable standards (see Appendix 2).\n\n10. TROPHIES\n\nIn addition to the Trophy, prizes awarded to the winning team, runners up and third place teams plus rolls of honour and sponsors prize presented to all teams, there will be trophies for individual performances (see Appendix 1 for details).\n\nIt is the obligation of the Winners of any Team Trophies, including the Nigel Dolton Trophy and the Alex Hay Trophy, to return their awards a minimum of 4 weeks before the end of 2024. (ie 30.11.2024)\n\n11. BAD WEATHER PROVISION - play is suspended or abandoned\n\n11.1 If for whatever reason, a round of matches is cancelled in advance of play commencing or during play, every effort will be made to reorganise/continue the round of matches at a mutually convenient time if possible.\n\nIf it is not possible to achieve in good time prior to the next round, the result shall be deemed to be a tie, unless §11.2 can be applied (see below).\n\n11.2 If play has to be abandoned during the course of a round, the following procedure will be adopted in order to determine the winning team in each match:\n\nWhere less than four rubbers in a match have completed a minimum of six holes at the time of abandonment, the match, will be deemed abandoned and §11.1 shall apply in respect of that match.\n\nNote: The relevant hole, referred to below as the “base” hole(s), will be the last hole completed, prior to the abandonment by players in the last match play groups, as appropriate, at the back of the field, i.e. who teed off last. The base hole must be the sixth or greater.\n\nWhere rubbers have not been fully completed when the match is abandoned, the position in each individual rubber, taken at the same “base” hole, will be deemed to be the result. Any rubbers which have not completed six holes will be declared tied, irrespective of the actual position at the abandonment.\n\nWhere rubbers have been completed i.e. a winner has been identified in advance of the 18th hole the result of that rubber will stand irrespective of whether some of the rubbers in the match have not been completed and are determined by reference back to the position at the relevant base hole.\n\nThe result of the match will be determined in the normal way as though all eight matches have registered “completed rounds”.\n\n12. DISCLAIMER\n\nBy agreeing to play at any Junior Team Golf event, participating Clubs agree to accept full responsibility for any illness or injury that may occur to any team member or official, and release and indemnify the event organisers from any actions, costs, damages, expenses or liability.\n\nBy agreeing to participate in the JTG Home Nations Championship Final, members of the Junior Team Golf “group” agree to abide by all Nefyn Golf Club protocols.\n\nIt is understood that all spectators other than Club Officials will be attending the event at their own risk.\n\nIn order to fulfil the requirements of Television and other media, Clubs agree for individual players/member of the official party to be photographed for print media and filmed for television.\n\nJunior Team Golf agrees, that they shall not use this visual material to promote anything other than the event itself, without parental or individual’s permission, as appropriate.\n\n13.
