        "text": "Ideal vs. Real: Searching for Perfection in an Imperfect Universe\n\nPLEASE NOTE JUNE’S LECTURE WILL begin at 6pm.\n\nJack Forster, Global Editorial Director, The 1916 Company (New York, New York)\n\nThe world of horology, of timekeeping and calendar reckoning, is based on the assumption that in the world around us, there are orders that can be reflected in watches and clocks. This includes everything from the simplest precision timekeepers, which rely on the stability of mechanical, electromechanical, and quantum oscillators, to highly complex calendars and calendar systems that reflect cycles in the physical universe, including the motion of astronomical bodies. Beginning from an examination of the simplest ideal classical oscillator – a pendulum with a massless rod, swinging in a vacuum on a frictionless bearing – this lecture will look at the gaps between ideal systems and their physical manifestations.\n\nAt the June lecture of the Horological Society of New York (HSNY), Jack Forster, Global Editorial Director of The 1916 Company, will look at factors affecting the stability of oscillators and also at the behavior of longer natural cycles that determine the structure of calendars. In both cases, the great challenge is for horologists to understand that it is fundamentally and axiomatically impossible to ever duplicate the behavior of idealized systems – but the challenge is to get as close as you can. What connects the simplest and the most complex horological mechanisms, is their attempt to capture the ideal – whether an ideal oscillator or a perfectly harmonious calendar – in a mechanical form.\n\n*Doors open at 5:30 PM ET, lecture to begin at 6 PM ET. RSVP is required.\n\n** The lecture video will be available to members immediately, and to the general public following a two-month delay.\n\nPLEASE NOTE JUNE’S LECTURE WILL begin at 6pm.\n\nAbout Jack Forster\n\nJack Forster has been interested in watches, clocks, and the problems involved in precision timekeeping for many years. He has written for numerous publications, including The 1916 Company, Hodinkee, Forbes, Vanity Fair, and many others. He is the author of several books, including Cartier: Time Art; Accutron: From The Space Age To The Digital Age; Watches: A Guide By Hodinkee (contributor and editor); MING: The Quest For All Positions; and an upcoming history of the first 100 years of the Citizen watch company.\n\nView Event →\n\nJapanese Sense of Aesthetics: The Preservation and Evolution of Grand Seiko Design (with Special Guest)\n\nPLEASE NOTE MAY’S LECTURE WILL TAKE PLACE ON WED, MAY 15.\n\nJoseph Kirk, Brand Curator and Director of Marketing, Grand Seiko Corporation of America (New York, New York)\n\nGrand Seiko design adopts its ethos from Japan itself, embodying elements of nature, light, and shadow, and even from architectural design to bring to life a unique sensibility in the watch industry. While Grand Seiko established its design code in 1967, the design traits of the brand have continued to evolve over time.\n\nAt the May lecture of the Horological Society of New York (HSNY), Grand Seiko Brand Curator and Director of Marketing Joseph Kirk, along with special guest Junichi Kamata, Grand Seiko Design Director, will discuss how the brand has mastered its manufacturing and craftsmanship, attained through years of experience and today defined by its unique dials, Zaratsu polishing, and even movement designs that reflect the natural beauty surrounding the studios where the watches themselves are made.\n\n*Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture to begin at 7PM ET. RSVP is required.\n\n** The lecture video will be available to members immediately, and to the general public following a two-month delay.\n\nAbout Joseph Kirk\n\nJoseph Kirk is the Brand Curator and Director of Marketing for Grand Seiko Corporation of America. Kirk has worked in the watch industry for over 18 years, in retail, media and educational formats. His knowledge of timepieces was gained through hands-on experience and time; along with the help of many watchmakers, engineers and designers from the industry overall, as well as the brand itself.\n\nSpecial Guest: Junichi Kamata, Grand Seiko Design Director. Kamata began his current role as Design Director in 2019. Finding beauty in the natural world and changing of the seasons, he and his team evoke the brand’s philosophy of “The Nature of Time.”\n\nView Event →\n\nWatches as Expressions of Culture: Making the Link Between Decades in Fashion and Collecting / Design\n\nMalaika Crawford, Style Editor, Hodinkee (New York, New York)\n\nMany see high-end watches as a token of forever, but view fashion as a fleeting fad. Malaika Crawford, Style Editor at Hodinkee, argues that both are fundamentally expressions of personal style. The gap between the two comes down to a dichotomy of permanence and obsolescence. But, ultimately, fashion and pop culture both do influence watch design - as well as the way we collect, consume, and wear watches.\n\nAt the March lecture of the Horological Society of New York (HSNY), Crawford will explore the intersection of fashion and watches by looking at the design links between them through decades past. The use of black as a symbol of extreme modernity, or the similarities between Yves Saint Laurent and Gérald Genta, for example. In examining the parallels, we can better understand the impact and significance of fashion on the world of horology.\n\n*Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture to begin at 7PM ET. RSVP is required.\n\n** The lecture video will be available to members immediately, and to the general public following a two-month delay.\n\nAbout Malaika Crawford\n\nMalaika Crawford is the Style Editor at Hodinkee, focusing primarily on style-related content in hopes of broadening the watch space and converging fashion and watch audiences. Malaika is also a Wardrobe Stylist who has previously worked with celebrities such as Rihanna. Prior to her position at Hodinkee she was the Watch and Jewelry editor at Highsnobiety and Fashion Editor at Interview Magazine. Malaika co-hosts a watch and pop culture podcast called “Killing Time.”\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Making of History: Behind the Scenes at ZENITH’s Heritage Department\n\nLaurence Bodenmann, Head of Heritage at ZENITH (Le Locle, Switzerland)\n\nHistory is not stationary. It is the ever-evolving result of research based on existing material, made alive by continuous questioning.

But how can one start practicing hand engraving and what is the process?\n\nAt the January lecture of the Horological Society of New York (HSNY), Artur Akmaev, founder of his eponymous watch brand, will share his experience working with different hand-engraving styles and techniques that he has learned and applied to his watches, culminating in his recent collection complete with fully engraved dials showcasing craftsmanship at its finest.\n\n*Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture to begin at 7PM ET. RSVP is required.\n\n** The lecture video will be available to members immediately, and to the general public following a two-month delay.\n\nAbout Artur Akmaev\n\nArtur Akmaev is a Russian-born craftsman and a wristwatch designer who moved to America seven years ago. He currently resides in Santa Monica, California, working part-time for fellow HSNY alum Josh Shapiro, and runs his own business — Artur Akmaev — crafting unique timepieces using his skills of hand engraving, enameling, and high-end finishing.\n\nAt a very early age, Akmaev’s parents exposed him to museums and art galleries and bought him books with images of art pieces from a wide range of cultural eras. By the time he started middle school, Akmaev exhibited a strong ability to paint and draw with decorative stencils. After a few tryouts, he was invited to join an evening school for the Arts, and though attending two schools at once could feel overwhelming at times, immersion in the disciplines of sculpturing, painting, architecture, and art history was very exciting.\n\nYears later, Akmaev went to a college of Arts and Crafts named after Carl Fabergé where he took jewelry design and fabrication classes. In the final year of college, he arrived at the discipline of fine hand engraving using very traditional sets of tools, some of which Akmaev learned to make from scratch.\n\nAfter college, Akmaev continued his education at the University of Applied Arts in Moscow and took a part-time job at the local watch repair shop — his introduction to movements and the operations of basic cleaning and restoration. On occasion, the shop had high-end watches with hand engraving and it was there that Akmaev became fascinated by the meticulous engraving and how it influenced the design.\n\nThis was a huge inspiration to bring his skills to the level where Akmaev would start his eponymous brand, designing with engraving movements and fabricating original dials and hands.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Value of Time: Branding and Effective Storytelling in Watchmaking\n\nFernanda Zapata, Founder of Gigantem (New York, NY)\n\nNote from the lecturer: Bring a watch with emotional significance to you!\n\nA fine watch, unlike many other luxury items, often carries with it a strong emotional significance to its owner. Steeped in history and craftsmanship, watches are both utilitarian and artistic, useful, and decorative. Watch companies, in turn, understand this, and use these values to their advantage when selling their timepieces.\n\nUsing organic storytelling, brands can effectively connect and communicate with potential clients — all without resulting to the marketing \"fluff\" to which modern consumers are sensitive to. At the December lecture of the Horological Society of New York (HSNY), Fernanda Zapata, founder of Gigantem — an agency that specializes in public relations and events for brands such as Parmigiani Fleurier, H. Moser, Zenith and Girard-Perregaux — will discuss how watch companies engage in marketing using their history and ethos to connect with customers based on shared interests and values.\n\n*Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture to begin at 7PM ET.

Lange & Söhne and Its Very Own Way of Watchmaking\n\nWilhelm Schmid, Chief Executive Officer, A. Lange & Söhne (Glashütte, Germany)\n\nAt the October lecture of the Horological Society of New York, Wilhelm Schmid, CEO of A. Lange & Söhne, will explain how the vision of Dresden watchmaker Ferdinand Adolph Lange, who laid the cornerstone of Saxony's precision watchmaking industry when he established his manufacture in 1845, still defines the philosophy of A. Lange & Söhne today. After his great-grandson Walter Lange had the courage to relaunch the brand together with the industry expert Günter Blümlein in 1990, A. Lange & Söhne quickly worked its way up to the top of the watchmaking world again.\n\nSince its new foundation, developing and producing movements has been the Saxon manufacture’s special expertise. Every timepiece that bears the brand’s logo is equipped with a manufacture movement crafted in-house. Over the years, this has resulted in 71 distinctive masterpieces in a relatively short time. Each one combines traditional elements with groundbreaking innovations and is distinguished by an extremely high level of craftsmanship. Discover what factors have contributed to this extraordinary achievement and what future strategies A. Lange & Söhne is pursuing.\n\n*Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture to begin at 7PM ET.

However, his contributions were discounted until one of his patented watches was found in 2012 which prompted renewed research. The trail amazingly led to George Washington and the time of his death on December 14, 1799, when his last breath was preserved for eternity on the dial of a colonial-made chamber clock.\n\nAt the September lecture of the Horological Society of New York, antiquarian horologist Richard Newman will discuss Leslie’s legacy as the greatest American clock and watchmaker of the 18th century.\n\n*Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture to begin at 7PM ET.

Dr. Paul Lawrie’s research asks if time is indeed relative — as something born of specific historical contingencies — then how do different peoples experience time differently? Moreover, how does the lived experience of time create or reinforce racial inequality within cities? Time and race intersected to inform the landscape of modern urban America in a number of ways: from curfews and commutes to time work management and timekeeping itself.\n\nAt the June lecture of the Horological Society of New York, Dr. Paul Lawrie, Associate Professor, Department of History, York University, will examine the remarkable life of one Peter J. Huffstead — Harlem's self-described \"master clockmaker\" — and one of the earliest Black members of the Horological Society of New York. An analysis of Huffstead's career reveals key insights into the racialized nature of expertise, migration, the politics of respectability and the making of urban community in early 20th century America. Positing time as a past, present and future agent of urban development and racial identity, this lecture presents new perspectives into the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban race relations from the assembly line to the city streets.\n\n*Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture to begin at 7PM ET.

The iridescent colors some feathers generate are the result of the refraction of light. A bird's feathers weigh more combined than its skeleton. A bird is capable of singing two notes simultaneously. Mankind has attempted for centuries to emulate their song and their beauty. The mechanical singing-bird tabatière was born during the late 18th century and continues to enchant today.\n\nAt the May lecture of the Horological Society of New York, Brittany Nicole Cox will examine the history behind the lineage of the mechanical singing-bird along with a case study.\n\nSpecial thank you to the Toledo Museum of Art for allowing Brittany Nicole Cox to share this talk.

Shapiro Watches LLC (Los Angeles, California)\n\nAmerican watchmaking had a meteoric rise in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The U.S. made millions of highly precise and beautiful timepieces. The means of producing these timepieces heavily influenced manufacturing techniques within watchmaking and industry at large. However, within a relatively short time period after World War II, mechanical movement watch companies would disappear completely from America. Now the U.S. is experiencing a resurgence of American watchmaking.\n\nAt the January 2023 lecture of the Horological Society of New York, Joshua Shapiro, CEO of J.N.

Doors open at 6PM ET, lecture and Zoom livestream to begin at 7PM ET.\n\nEarly modern clock and watch dials mirrored changes in the wider intellectual and cultural context of which they were inextricably a part. At the October 2022 lecture of the Horological Society of New York, Dr. Jane Desborough, Keeper of Science Collections at the Science Museum in London, will chart the significant changes that dials underwent in the period from 1550 to 1770, highlighting the many factors that eventually led to a more-or-less uniform design being adopted by 1770. This 220-year journey of development was a fascinating one in which different attributes of dial design were introduced to meet a particular user demand, such as the touch-pins which were added to help partially-sighted users and which were then discarded once alternative aids became available. It is, therefore, the discarded elements that did not secure a place on the uniform design that are the most interesting.\n\nMultiple forms of lunar calendar and astronomical symbols, for example, were highly significant to both makers and users during the late-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but eventually either disappeared entirely or survived on only rare examples. Comparing dials with contemporary texts and diagrams enables us to identify the influences that led to these changes. Clock and watch makers of the past were after all inextricably part of the wider context of experiment, knowledge formation and exchange which characterised the early modern period. Highly literate, highly skilled and an integral part of wide-ranging & highly-connected networks, early modern clock and watch makers played an active role in disseminating, validating and discrediting ideas and practices. This was evident in their dial designs.\n\nAbout Dr. Jane Desborough\n\nDr. Jane Desborough is Keeper of Science Collections at the Science Museum in London where she is responsible for the Museum’s Time Measurement Collection. She is author of The Changing Face of Early Modern Time, 1550-1770, based on her Ph.D. research, and co-author of Science City: Craft, Commerce & Curiosity in London 1550-1800.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Quartz Crisis: A Tragic Decade for Swiss Watchmaking, by Hyla Ames Bauer\n\nHyla Ames Bauer, Watch and Jewelry Writer (New York, New York)\n\nNote from the lecturer: Wear a Swatch if you have one!\n\nIn the early and mid-20th century, the Swiss watchmaking industry was booming — until the quartz crisis happened in the 1970s and shook it to its core.\n\nAt the September 2022 lecture of the Horological Society of New York (HSNY), watch and jewelry writer Hyla Ames Bauer will discuss the quartz crisis, beginning with what a quartz watch is, and why it's called a quartz watch and not a battery watch (or some other name). The lecture will also include an overview of how successful Swiss watchmaking was prior to the crisis, and how important it was to the Swiss economy. Bauer will describe the rapid development of quartz timepieces in Japan, at a time when the Swiss were just dipping their toes into quartz technology. Ultimately, in the mid-1970s, quartz watches became an inexpensive novelty that attracted millions of buyers. At that time, Swiss brands could not produce quartz watches at lower prices and the industry faltered. How many job losses occurred, and how many brands closed for good? Join us on September 7 as Bauer shares the facts on how Swiss brands were impacted and got back on their feet!\n\nAbout Hyla Ames Bauer\n\nHyla Ames Bauer began her career as a fashion editor at Conde Nast Publications. After stints at GQ and Vogue, she became the Executive Fashion Editor of Conde Nast Traveler. Hyla fell in love with watches on her first trip to Basel while at Traveler.

Some of these principles were essentially functional, and Laurent Ferrier, mindful of his heritage, would work to improve them. Others were restricted by the limited technical means of their era.\n\nSuch was the case with the natural escapement. In 1802, Abraham-Louis Breguet completed his first watch using the ultra efficient escapement. Unfortunately, Breguet was unable to ensure its reliability because of the manufacturing techniques and materials available at the time. Two hundred years later, Laurent Ferrier gave the natural escapement a new lease on life. At the October 2021 meeting of the Horological Society of New York, Laurent and Christian Ferrier will discuss the principles of the natural escapement and how they succeeded in manufacturing it.\n\nAbout Laurent Ferrier\n\nThe son and grandson of watchmakers, Laurent Ferrier, the emblematic figure of the brand that bears his name, is profoundly attached to the excellence of traditional watchmaking crafts. His lengthy experience in the fields of horological design, technical research and watch design demonstrates his inventive nature.\n\nLaurent Ferrier develops his own watches, from conception through to production. After 37 years of working for the same firm, the Geneva-based watchmaker decided in 2009 to found a brand dedicated to fine watchmaking. He develops his own watches, from conception through to production and in doing so is backed by his son Christian, a guarantee of continuity.\n\nAbout Christian Ferrier\n\nAfter a training in mechanics, Christian Ferrier started his career in a research lab specialized in aerospace. Soon enough, his passion for watchmaking took over and he left the aerospace industry. When Laurent Ferrier decide to launch his new venture, he immediately asks his own son to join the team. Since the beginning, Christian Ferrier managed the technical design of the very first movement ever made by the brand. He now works with his father in the creation department, perpetuating the family tradition.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe History of the Tourbillon; Its Theory and Modern Evolution, by Emmanuel Breguet and Jeffrey Kingston\n\nEmmanuel Breguet, Vice President, Head of Patrimony at Montres Breguet, Paris, France; Vallée de Joux, Switzerland\n\nJeffrey Kingston, Editor-in-Chief of Le Quai de l’Horloge, Sun Valley, Idaho\n\nPatented in 1801 by Abraham-Louis Breguet, the tourbillon is one of the most revered and enduring horological inventions of all time. The story behind the invention is fascinating and leads to many questions. What were Breguet’s insights that led him to create it? What were the significant timepieces featuring his invention that left the Quai de l’Horloge workshop during his lifetime?
