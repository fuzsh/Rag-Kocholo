        "text": "Irish professional golfer (born 1966)\n\nPaul Noel McGinley (born 16 December 1966) is an Irish professional golfer who has won four events on the European Tour. At the 2002 Ryder Cup, he famously holed a ten-foot putt on the 18th hole in his match against Jim Furyk at The Belfry which won the Ryder Cup for Europe.[2] He was the winning captain of Europe in the 2014 Ryder Cup and the first Irishman to captain Europe's Ryder Cup side.[3]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nMcGinley was raised in Rathfarnham and was educated at St Mary's BNS and Coláiste Éanna. His father Mick – who is from Dunfanaghy – played Gaelic football for Donegal, while his mother Julia comes from Rathmullan.[4] McGinley himself was born in Dublin and studied at Dublin Institute of Technology. After his knee injury McGinley turned his full attention to golf.[5] McGinley later said that when he played golf as part of a team it helped to raise his game to another level. He credited his experience of Gaelic football for his passion for team sports and suggested it played a part in why he was appointed European captain for the 2014 Ryder Cup.[6] He later attended the United States International University in San Diego on a golf scholarship, where he gained a master's degree in marketing.[7]\n\nMcGinley won the 1989 Irish Amateur Close Championship and the 1991 South of Ireland Championship at Lahinch Golf Club. He was selected for the 1991 Britain & Ireland Walker Cup team at Portmarnock Golf Club, just north of Dublin, where a strong American team that included Phil Mickelson beat Britain & Ireland 14–10.[8]\n\nProfessional career\n\n[edit]\n\nMcGinley turned professional in late 1991 and joined the European Tour in 1992, aged 25. In 1993, he lost a playoff to Costantino Rocca in the French Open.[9] In 1994, McGinley lost a playoff to José María Olazábal in the Open Mediterrania.[10]\n\nMcGinley eventually won his first title on the European Tour at the 1996 Hohe Brücke Open (formerly known as the Austrian Open). In 1997 he won the World Cup of Golf for Ireland with Pádraig Harrington (who attended the same secondary school, Coláiste Éanna, as McGinley).\n\nAt the 2001 Celtic Manor Resort Wales Open, McGinley won the tournament on the fifth extra hole of a playoff in an event that was so badly disrupted by torrential rain that it was reduced to just 36 holes. After his victory, McGinley quipped: \"Goran Ivanišević said God sent the rain for him at Wimbledon and maybe he sent it for me too!\"[11]\n\nMcGinley's best finish in one of the four major championships is a tie for 6th place in the 2004 PGA Championship. He has featured in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Ranking. His best season on the European Tour was in 2005, when he finished third on the Order of Merit. He made the cut in 21 out of 23 events that year and gained his fourth and, to date, last European Tour victory in the season-ending Volvo Masters at the Valderrama Golf Club in Spain. McGinley started his final round four shots off the lead. He shot a final round of 67 for the biggest individual tournament win of his career, finishing two strokes ahead of Spain's Sergio García.[12]\n\nBefore his victory in the 2005 Volvo Masters, McGinley had three runner-up finishes in tournaments that year, finishing second to Ángel Cabrera in the BMW Championship at Wentworth and losing in the final of the HSBC World Match Play Championship at the same venue to New Zealander Michael Campbell (2 & 1). In an absorbing contest, Campbell clinched the title with a half on the penultimate hole after McGinley had driven wildly into the trees on the previous two holes. McGinley later said he was \"hurt like you can't imagine\" after losing in the final. He said: \"I fought as hard as I could and I'm bitterly disappointed.\"[13]\n\nAt the 2005 TCL Classic, McGinley shot a final round of 63 to force a sudden-death playoff with Paul Casey. However, on the second extra hole Casey holed a 25-foot birdie putt from the back of the green to win the title.[14]\n\nAt the 2008 KLM Open played in the Netherlands, McGinley shot a final round of 64 to finish runner-up in the tournament, behind Darren Clarke.[15]\n\nRyder Cup\n\n[edit]\n\nMcGinley made three consecutive Ryder Cup appearances in 2002, 2004 and 2006, with Europe being victorious each time. In the 2002 Ryder Cup, his ten-foot putt on the 18th hole in his match against Jim Furyk secured the ½ point Europe needed for victory; the team eventually won 15½ to 12½. In the 2006 Ryder Cup at The K Club in Ireland, McGinley offered a handshake and conceded a 20-foot putt for a half to J. J. Henry on the 18th green of his last day singles match because he feared his opponent might have been put off when a streaker ran across the green.[16]\n\nIn the 2010 and 2012 matches, McGinley served as one of the European vice-captains to Colin Montgomerie and José María Olazábal respectively. On 15 January 2013, he was named the Europe team captain for the 2014 Ryder Cup.[17][18][19]\n\nIn May 2013, McGinley gave European player Sergio García his backing following a public feud that the Spaniard had with Tiger Woods and a controversial \"fried chicken\" remark that García made about Woods. In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, McGinley said: \"I think there's a personality clash and they don't particularly like each other's company. For me, it's no big deal. He apologised for it and, as far as I'm concerned, we move on. People make mistakes and say things all the time that they regret and didn't mean.\"[20] Garcia would eventually qualify for McGinley’s European squad, ahead of the Ryder Cup in September 2014.\n\nAt the 2014 Ryder Cup in Scotland, McGinley’s European team defeated the American team captained by Tom Watson with a winning margin of 161⁄2 to 111⁄2.[21]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMcGinley met his wife, Allison Shapcott, who played golf for England and on the Ladies European Tour, when they were both at United States International University in San Diego. They married in 1996 and have three children.[22]\n\nMcGinley is an executive fellow of the Leadership Institute at the London Business School.[23]\n\nAmateur wins\n\n[edit]\n\n1988 Irish Youths Championship, Scottish Youths Championship\n\n1989 Irish Amateur Close Championship\n\n1991 South of Ireland Championship\n\nProfessional wins (10)\n\n[edit]\n\nEuropean Tour wins (4)\n\n[edit]\n\nLegend Tour Championships (1) Other European Tour (3)\n\nNo. Date Tournament Winning score Margin of\n\nvictory Runner(s)-up 1 11 Aug 1996 Hohe Brücke Open −19 (73-66-68-62=269) 1 stroke David Lynn, Juan Carlos Piñero 2 26 Oct 1997 Oki Pro-Am −22 (66-67-64-69=266) 4 strokes Iain Pyman 3 12 Aug 2001 Celtic Manor Resort Wales Open −6 (67-71=138)* Playoff Paul Lawrie, Daren Lee 4 30 Oct 2005 Volvo Masters −10 (74-68-65-67=274) 2 strokes Sergio García\n\n*Note: The 2001 Celtic Manor Resort Wales Open was shortened to 36 holes due to rain.\n\nEuropean Tour playoff record (1–3)\n\nNo. Year Tournament Opponent(s) Result 1 1993 Peugeot Open de France Costantino Rocca Lost to bogey on first extra hole 2 1994 Turespaña Open Mediterrania José María Olazábal Lost to birdie on second extra hole 3 2001 Celtic Manor Resort Wales Open Paul Lawrie, Daren Lee Won with par on fifth extra hole\n\nLawrie eliminated by par on second hole 4 2005 TCL Classic Paul Casey Lost to birdie on second extra hole\n\nOther wins (6)\n\n[edit]\n\nNo. Date Tournament Winning score Margin of\n\nvictory Runner(s)-up 1 13 Oct 1991 UAP European Under-25 Championship −5 (70-69-74-70=283) 1 stroke Paul Affleck, René Michelsen 2 13 Oct 1997 Smurfit Irish PGA Championship −3 (70-66-75-74=285) 3 strokes Stephen Hamill, David Higgins,\n\nJohn McHenry 3 23 Nov 1997 World Cup of Golf\n\n(with Pádraig Harrington) −31 (137-137-136-135=545) 5 strokes Scotland – Colin Montgomerie and Raymond Russell 4 8 Oct 2000 Smurfit Irish PGA Championship (2) −18 (67-67-67-69=270) 4 strokes Eamonn Darcy 5 27 Apr 2002 Smurfit Irish PGA Championship (3) −6 (76-72-65=213) 3 strokes John Dwyer 6 7 Sep 2003 Smurfit Irish PGA Championship (4) −8 (71-68-69-72=280) 5 strokes Gary Murphy\n\nResults in major championships\n\n[edit]\n\nTournament 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 Masters Tournament U.S. Open CUT The Open Championship CUT CUT CUT T14 T66 CUT CUT PGA Championship\n\nTournament 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Masters Tournament T18 CUT U.S. Open CUT T42 CUT The Open Championship T20 T54 CUT T28 T57 T41 CUT 19 T43 PGA Championship CUT T22 CUT CUT T6 T23 T60\n\nTournament 2010 2011 2012 2013 Masters Tournament U.S. Open The Open Championship PGA Championship CUT\n\nTop 10\n\nDid not play\n\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\n\n\"T\" = tied\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nTournament Wins 2nd 3rd Top-5 Top-10 Top-25 Events Cuts made Masters Tournament 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 U.S. Open 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 The Open Championship 0 0 0 0 0 3 16 9 PGA Championship 0 0 0 0 1 3 8 4 Totals 0 0 0 0 1 7 30 15\n\nMost consecutive cuts made – 5 (2004 Open Championship – 2005 PGA)\n\nLongest streak of top-10s – 1 (twice)\n\nResults in The Players Championship\n\n[edit]\n\nTournament 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 The Players Championship CUT CUT\n\nDid not play\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\n\nResults in World Golf Championships\n\n[edit]\n\nTournament 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Match Play R64 R32 R64 Championship T35 NT1 T28 T35 Invitational 23 26 67 T58 T46 T3 T66 T39 T27\n\n1Cancelled due to 9/11\n\nTop 10\n\nDid not play\n\nQF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play\n\n\"T\" = Tied\n\nNT = No tournament\n\nTeam appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nAmateur\n\nWalker Cup (representing Great Britain & Ireland): 1991\n\nEuropean Amateur Team Championship (representing Ireland): 1991\n\nProfessional\n\nAlfred Dunhill Cup (representing Ireland): 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000\n\nWorld Cup (representing Ireland): 1993, 1994, 1997 (winners), 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008\n\nRyder Cup (representing Europe): 2002 (winners), 2004 (winners), 2006 (winners), 2014 (non-playing captain, winners)\n\nRecord: 9 matches, 4.5 points (50% Point Percentage)\n\nAll formats (W–L–H): 2–2–5 = 4.5pts\n\nSingles: 1–0–2 = 2pts\n\nFoursomes: 1–2–1 = 1.5pts\n\nFourballs: 0–0–2 = 1pt\n\nSeve Trophy (representing Great Britain & Ireland): 2002 (winners), 2005 (winners), 2009 (winners, non-playing captain), 2011 (winners, non-playing captain)\n\nRoyal Trophy (representing Europe): 2006 (winners), 2007 (winners), 2009\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of people on the postage stamps of Ireland\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
