        "text": "William Adams Delano was born in New York City on January 21, 1874. His father, Eugene Delano, was a partner in the banking firm Brown Brothers & Company; his mother, the former Susan Magoun Adams, was the daughter of the Reverend Mr. William Adams. In 1887, William Adams Delano entered the Lawrenceville School, from which he graduated in 1891. In the fall of that year he enrolled in Yale College, obtaining his A.B. In 1895. After graduation from Yale, Delano spent two years in the Columbia University School of Architecture and two years as a draftsman in the architectural office of Hastings Carr√®re. He then went to Paris to study at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, from which he received a diploma in 1902. In 1901 Delano had been awarded the Jean Leclaire Prize, an honor bestowed by the Institut de France upon the member of the First Class who receives the greatest number of values. This had been a particularly meaningful award to Delano, since this was the first time the prize had been given to other than a Frenchman. After over five years in Paris he returned to New York where, in 1903, he and Chester H. Aldrich founded the firm of Delano and Aldrich. Until 1910, Delano also served as a professor of design at Columbia University's School of Architecture.\n\nIn 1924, Delano was appointed for a four year term to the National Commission of Fine Arts by President Coolidge. In 1927 Secretary Mellon appointed him a member of the Board of Architectural Consultants of the United States Treasury Department, a position Delano held for six years. In 1929, by president Hoover's request, Delano became the architectural representative on the National Park and Planning Commission, being re-appointed by succeeding Presidents and serving in his capacity until 1946 when he resigned.\n\nIn 1908, Delano was awarded the degree of B.F.A., and in 1939 he received an honorary M.A. -- both from Yale. He became, in 1930, a corresponding member of the Academic des Beaux Arts Institut de France, having served as President of the Society of Beaux Arts Architects from 1927 to 1929; also in 1930, Delano became an officer in the Legion d'Honneur. He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and from 1928 to 1930 he served as president of the New York Chapter; in 1953 Delano received the Institute's Gold Medal for excellence in Architecture. A member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, he had received their Gold Medal for architecture in 1940. Delano also belonged to the Architectural League of New York, the National Academy of Design, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was a trustee of the New York Orthopaedic Dispensary and the New York Public Library; he was vice president of the Grenfell Association of America and the New York Hotocultural Society. He was a member of the Century Association, the Coffee House, India House, The Brook, and the Yale University Knickerbocker, and Piping Rock Clubs in New York; he was also a member of the Metropolitan Club in Washington and the Graduates Club in New Haven.\n\nDuring his architectural career, Delano designed many buildings of note. Among them at Yale were Wright Hall, Sterling Chemical Laboratory, and the Divinity School. His buildings at Washington include the Japanese Embassy, the Post Office Building and Circular Plaza. In New York City, Delano designed the University Club and the Brook, and LaGuardia and Idlewild Airports. A commission which had given Delano particular professional satisfaction was the American Embassy on the Place de la Concorde in Paris. At West Point Delano succeeded in winning the contract for the enlargement of the United States Military Academy. However, Delano is probably best known for his work on the renovation of the White House, including the balcony addition he designed.\n\nA member of that stylistic persuasion in architecture called the \"Beaux Arts School,\" Delano's designs are today often unfavorably criticized and largely ignored. However, in his time, many thought very highly of his architectural artistry. President Truman, for one, expressed his admiration in this note he sent Delano: \"On all sides we find noble works whose artistic merits reflect the fine taste and judgment which you have exercised.\"\n\nWilliam Delano died on January 12, 1960 in New York City at the age of 85.\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL NOTE\n\n1874 Born, New York City, on January 21\n\n1887-1891 Lawrenceville School\n\n1895 A.B.
