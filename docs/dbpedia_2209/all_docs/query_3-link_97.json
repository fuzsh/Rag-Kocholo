        "text": "Darren Clarke will take a step back from his hectic schedule as European Ryder Cup captain next week with a diary free of official business. Yet while on the face of it there will be some calm before the dramatic storm of the resumption of golfing rivalries with the US at the end of the month in Minnesota, it is doubtful the Irishman will be sleeping any easier.\n\nNo-one should underestimate the importance of next Tuesday in the golfing life of Darren Clarke, because it is then that he will have to reveal his hand.\n\nPaul Dunne is hoping history can repeat itself with the rookie pro looking to follow in the footsteps of Rory McIlroy by securing his European Tour card at this week&rsquo;s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.\n\nDustin Johnson&rsquo;s supporters say that what gets overlooked when you focus on the ending to his 2010 PGA Championship is how well he played to charge into the lead.&nbsp;\n\nTiger Woods was in contention for his first PGA Tour win in two years as he lay in joint third after his second round of the Quicken Loans National.\n\nDustin Johnson did not manage 18 holes but he showed enough in a second round cut short by fading light to stay just out in front in The 144th Open Championship last night at St Andrews.\n\nThey are playing the same course side by side, but if Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth are going to continue their majors duel into the last round of the 144th Open Championship, then the American rivals will get there by contrasting routes.\n\nEuropean Ryder Cup heroes Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson and Miguel Angel Jimenez have become the latest stars to confirm their plans to play Royal Co Down in two weeks as the entry deadline closed for this year&rsquo;s Dubai Duty Free Irish Open.\n\nEuropean Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley had a sense US Open champion Martin Kaymer was on the verge of producing something special and believes the “low maintenance” German will make an ideal team member at Gleneagles.\n\nGraeme McDowell has withdrawn from next week&rsquo;s BMW PGA Championship to be with his wife, Kristin, who is expecting their first child later this summer.\n\nPaul McGinley has vowed not to cash in on his stint as Ryder Cup captain by writing a book detailing what goes on behind the scenes at Gleneagles.\n\nPaul McGinley has vowed not to cash in on his stint as Ryder Cup captain by writing a book detailing what goes on behind the scenes at Gleneagles.\n\nYes, yes, I know it’s nearly November and the leading golfers in the world are out east chasing dollars, dirhams and yuan — there’s gold in them thar (Mission) Hills, eh, Rory! — but it has actually been quite a good week for the Irish Open.\n\nGreat Britain and Ireland’s Simon Khan had to pull out of the Seve Trophy on Sunday with a back injury, with Thomas Bjorn volunteering to step aside for the Continental Europe team at St Nom La Breteche.\n\nReigning Irish Open champion Paul Casey continues to stake his claim for a return to Ryder Cup action next year after another impressive display on day two of the Seve Trophy in France.\n\nPaul McGinley declared he would be taking a backseat role but there was no hiding the enthusiasm of the European Ryder Cup captain on the opening day of the Seve Trophy near Versailles.\n\nOne of the richest tournaments on the European Tour schedule, the $5m (€3.7m) Dunhill Links, is on this week over three outstanding links courses on the east coast of Scotland — but just three members of the 2012 European Ryder Cup team are competing.\n\nPaul McGinley continues to make it clear that he will be his own man when attempting to mastermind Europe’s Ryder Cup defence at Gleneagles next year.\n\nPaul McGinley has strongly hinted his three European Team wildcard picks could very well go to those who play well this weekend at Gleneagles, the host venue for this week’s Johnnie Walker Championship.\n\nThe age old adage that you should be careful what you wish for is certainly holding true for Darren Clarke, just eight months after what was described as an “unseemly” politicking for the Ryder Cup captaincy.\n\nThe days when membership of the European Tour was considered a gateway to riches and a luxurious lifestyle would appear to be a thing of the past judging by the lack of activity at a time of year when it should be at its busiest."
