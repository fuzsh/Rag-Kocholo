        "text": "Paul Lawrie admits he’ll still be fully focused on playing when he features in this week's inaugural Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Match Play, live on Sky Sports.\n\nThe event will be part of the Race to Dubai for the next three years and will see 64 players, including some of the European Tour’s leading names, battle it out in straight knockout over four days.\n\nWhile Lawrie has played a key role in organizing the tournament and is excited to host a tour event for the first time, the 46-year-old is still keen to build on his recent upturn in form when he tees off in Aberdeen on Thursday.\n\n“As soon as the tournament kicks off, my involvement will be 100% as a player in the field,” Lawrie told Sky Sports. “Once I get on the tee I’ll be 100% committed to try to win.\n\n“It’s great to drive in to a venue and see a tournament taking shape. Normally we just arrive and everything is done, but I’ve been over a few times and it’s quite exciting to see all the tents going up and everything being set up.\n\n“There’s still going to be a few bits and pieces for me to do this week, but it’s important I’m there as a player and not just a tournament host.\"\n\nAll four days will be broadcast live on Sky Sports 4, with the draw for the first round being made live on Tuesday afternoon on Sky Sports News HQ.\n\nIt's the first time the European Tour has returned to the town since Royal Aberdeen hosted last year's Scottish Open, with Murcar Links GC providing the venue for this week's event.\n\n“It’s a fantastic course for a matchplay format; there’s a lot of risk-reward out there,” Lawrie added. “With a lot of shortish holes we’re hoping the guys will make quite a few birdies and make it entertaining for spectators to come along and see.\n\n“I’m born and bred in Aberdeen, as is Mike Loggie from Saltire Energy who has played a huge part in making the tournament happen, so it was important our first year was held here.\n\n“There aren’t really many matchplay competitions in the schedule so we wanted to lay one on for the regular guys on the European Tour. It’s a format I’ve always enjoyed and the guys will too.”\n\nMarc Warren and Richie Ramsay lead the home interest in the field this week, which also includes former Ryder Cup players Edoardo Molinari and Nicolas Colsaerts and several of this year's winners on the European Tour.\n\nJames Morrison, Chris Wood and Kiradech Aphibarnrat will all feature in the €1 million event, while former Open champion John Daly is back in action having featured at St Andrews earlier this month.\n\n“John (Daly) is exactly the type of character we wanted to try and attract, and he’s going to be brilliant for the tournament. He’s aggressive, exciting to watch and goes for a lot of shots, so if I was a golf fan who lived near Aberdeen I certainly wouldn’t be missing it.\n\n“The field is shaping up pretty good. The week before two weeks in America is obviously not ideal for those playing in the WGC and at Whistling Straits, but it’s quite difficult to fit a tournament in the schedule and this is the first date we can get.\n\n\"Matchplay’s always exciting, with 32 matches on an intense first day and then a big crowd watching four people on the Sunday. That's mega cool and I can’t wait.\""
