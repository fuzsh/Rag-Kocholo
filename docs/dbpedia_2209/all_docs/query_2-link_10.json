        "text": "Congratulations to the anonymous commenter on the Guardian sports blog who took the time out to remark blithely that Paul Lawrie was the \"third worst\" major champion in history; you have helped create if not a monster then certainly a man with a mission.\n\nLike most top-class professional golfers Lawrie, who won the 1999 Open Championship by birdieing Carnoustie's notorious 18th, the final hole of a play-off, has deep reserves of self-belief but he is no different to anyone else in that he cares about what others think of him. \"That comment isn't the reason I started to play well but it really shocked me. That's a pretty silly thing for anyone to write but you want people think of you with some respect. Not much respect there, was there?\" he says. \"So I think it is fair to say that comment got me highly motivated to prove to some people they have got the wrong idea about me.\"\n\nThat comment appeared on the opening day of the Dubai World Championship last December which saw Lawrie finish at the top of a very strong leaderboard. From there his small but devoted army of sceptics no doubt expected him to fall like the proverbial brick. Duly motivated the Scot did nothing of the sort, playing beautifully over the next three days to finish the tournament in second place behind Alvaro Quir√≥s.\n\nBetter was to come when he returned to the Middle East for January's Qatar Masters, where another strong field had assembled. Once again the 43-year-old Lawrie started well but this time he pushed on, eventually winning the tournament by four shots. The victory saw him return after an absence of more than eight years to the world's top 50 (he currently stands 43), a self-perpetuating elite which is granted automatic entry to the majors and world golf championships, where world ranking points are most abundantly available.\n\nLawrie will have a chance to improve his ranking on Wednesday in Tucson, where he will face Justin Rose in the first round of the Accenture World Match Play. Another good week and inevitably there will be talk of another Ryder Cup appearance for the Scot who played brilliantly the only other time he was involved against the United States, in the notorious contest at Brookline in 1999. Lawrie has always been a good matchplay competitor, as he proved that week in winning three and a half points.\n\n\"I'm really not thinking about the Ryder Cup or anything like that. There's a long way to go and I've been around long enough to know what golf can do to you, that as soon as you think you have got it cracked it'll sort you out,\" he says.\n\nYet if Lawrie refuses to look forward to the 2012 Ryder Cup he is happy to look back to the peripheral role he played in the 2010 edition and how it helped his return to form after his world ranking had fallen to 242.\n\n\"At Celtic Manor Sky asked me to do a bit of commentating and as much as I enjoyed it, and as much as everyone at Sky was really good to me, I thought this is not what I want to do with my life right now. I just didn't want to give up playing,\" he says.\n\nHis ambition reinvigorated, he took himself into the gym, where he lost a stone and a half, and returned to the driving range with renewed purpose. \"I've never hit so many golf balls in my life,\" he says.\n\nBut for all that better conditioning and concentrated practice underpins Lawrie's revival, nothing has mattered so much as events in his private life, not least the death of his long-time coach and friend Adam Hunter last year. The pair had worked together for more than a decade, bound together by the experiences they shared as European Tour players and by that memorable day in Carnoustie, where Hunter followed his charge's progress from outside the ropes, as nervous as an expectant father.\n\n\"I think about Adam a 100 times a day. On the golf course if I find myself in a tricky situation or if something hasn't gone quite right I ask myself: 'What would his advice be?'\" he says. \"It's a huge motivation for me knowing that Adam's wife, Caroline, and his girls will be looking out for my scores and following my progress. I feel a real responsibility and would take a real pride if I can do everything I can to keep their father's memory in the public's mind.\"\n\nAs for his own family, Lawrie has two teenage sons, Michael and Craig, both of whom are keen (as well as low-handicap) golfers. Their unlimited enthusiasm for the sport has dragged their old man out on the course far more often than was previously the case. \"I used to be more of a practiser when I was home but now that the boys are at an age when they know what the game is about, and you can teach them a little bit, I play a lot more rather than just standing there on the range slashing balls all day. And that has been a great help, I think,\" he says.\n\nA great help, perhaps, but also a great humbler. It has been two years since Lawrie suffered the most significant defeat of his life but he remembers it as if it happened yesterday.\n\n\"We were playing the short nine-hole course at Deeside when it dawned on me playing the last that Craig was two shots ahead of me. I tried to put him off with a bit of gamesmanship going down the last but, fair play to him, he held it together and holed a five-footer for bogey to win,\" he recalls. \"I don't mind saying I was shocked. I was thinking: 'Hey I'm a tour pro and here I am being beaten by a 14-year-old. That's not very good, is it?'\"\n\nThere have been plenty of other games since then, and a few defeats for the tour professional. But if Craig, now a scratch player, and Michael, who plays off five, have celebrated their moments of familial glory they should take even greater joy from the contribution they have made to the career comeback of their dad. \"I can't tell you how much I love going out and playing golf with my boys, and teaching them about the game,\" Lawrie says. \"And I can't tell you how much that has helped my own golf.\""
