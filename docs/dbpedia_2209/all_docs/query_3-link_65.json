I would like to think that I would be even more competitive and a better player,\" the world number 28 said ahead of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.\n\n\"I am certainly going to be in all the top events for the next little while, so if I keep the performances up that I have had I am going to have a fair chance of getting in that team.\n\n\"If I don't it certainly won't be for the lack of trying. To play in your home country in a Ryder Cup would be pretty special, so I will still be trying my hardest.\"\n\nLawrie's name has also been thrown into the hat as a potential successor to captain Jose Maria Olazabal, 46, after the Spaniard said he would not consider leading the team again.\n\nThe other strong candidates are Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke, 44, and 45-year-old Irishman Paul McGinley, both of whom have played in the Ryder Cup and served as vice-captains for Olazabal in Chicago.\n\nThe European Tour's tournament committee will name the Gleneagles captain after a meeting in Abu Dhabi in January.\n\n\"I would like to think that the committee would know I want to play in that team,\" said Lawrie, adding that the captaincy had enormous appeal.\n\n\"But if they do offer it to me, which I don't think they will, then that would be a huge decision I would have to make. Not many people would knock it back.\""
