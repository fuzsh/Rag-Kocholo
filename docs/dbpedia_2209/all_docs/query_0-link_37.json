Her current research interests interrogate knowledge production and circulation between Mexico and India; medical professionals and social movements; and science and development projects in the twentieth century. Her first book Jungle Laboratories: Mexican Peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill won the Robert K. Merton Best Book prize in Science, Knowledge, and Technology Studies from the American Sociological Association. In Jungle Laboratories she explored how the first viable commercial oral contraceptive, and three hundred other patent medications, were produced using wild yams picked by Mexican peasants who delivered the tubers to representatives of international pharmaceutical companies. The book is an examination of both the global quest for plants that heal and the local impact of this commercial search as well as an exploration of where science can be performed and by whom. She is completing two book manuscripts: one on doctors as agents of social unrest and her third book examines agricultural science exchange between India and Mexico. She is a current editor of The Bulletin of the History of Medicine, and has held numerous grants, including those from the Ford, Mellon, Fulbright, DAAD, Santander, and Gerda Henkel Foundations.

She is currently working on a book manuscript about the pictorial legibility of outer space over the course of the Cold War.\n\nDIBNER RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY\n\nHannah Anderson, Fellow, History, University of Toronto\n\nTopic: Lived Botany: Settlers and Natural History in the Early British Atlantic\n\nHannah Anderson is a historian of early America. She investigates the intersecting histories of science, gender, and environments. She holds a Ph.D. in history from the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, Dr. Anderson was the University College Fellow in Early American History at the University of Toronto. Her work has been supported by many institutions, including the McNeil Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the American Philosophical Society, the Consortium for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the John Carter Brown Library, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the American Antiquarian Society, and the New England Regional Fellowship Consortium. Dr. Anderson also has a background in public history. Her book manuscript, Lived Botany: Settlers and Natural History in the Early British Atlantic, examines colonial settlers’ logics and practices of plant identification, description, and analysis. These practices shaped efforts to settle and harness the resources of North American colonies while also generating problems of classification and typology that influenced the development of the science of natural history.\n\nDIBNER RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY\n\nSean Silver, Associate Professor, English, Rutgers\n\nTopic: The Motley Emblem: Tristram Shandy and the Empire of Color\n\nSean Silver is associate professor of English at Rutgers University. He has held positions at UCLA, the University of Michigan, and Universität Basel, the last two with tenure. His first book, The Mind Is a Collection, is the exhibit catalogue of a born-digital museum of eighteenth-century cognitive models. Visit at mindisacollection.org; admission is always free. He has articles forthcoming in ELH, Novel, and Critical Inquiry, each of which differently traces the eighteenth-century tradition of complex systems analysis. While at The Huntington, he will be working on a project called The Motley Emblem. Beginning with a historical reconstruction of its iconic marbled page, this project begins by positioning Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy (1759-68) in the global networks of manufacture and technical innovation that made that book possible. His immediate ambition is a reading of Sterne's book, which places it in the messy, contingent world of its production. But his wider goal is to align three historical \"rise\" theses: the rise of the British native design tradition, including the rise of the novel, the modernization of commercial and industrial chemistry, and the emergence of the British Empire. He aims to make sense of empire not through its economic impact or is demographic effects, nor even its public arts like history painting or grand histories, but in the complex experience of making and reading a book. Some discussion of technical aspects of this project is available at motleyemblem.org.\n\nDANA AND DAVID DORNSIFE FELLOW\n\nBernadette Pérez, Assistant Professor, History, University of California - Berkeley\n\nTopic: The Violence of American Sugar\n\nBernadette Pérez is an assistant professor of U.S. history at UC Berkeley.

She specializes in the history of Latinx and Indigenous peoples and situates her work at the intersection of multiple subfields, from race and environment to labor, migration, and colonialism. She is currently completing her first book, The Violence of American Sugar, a labor and environmental history of Colorado’s sugar industry. The book centers environmental injustice in movements for land, sovereignty, and rights in Indigenous, Mexican, Japanese, and white American communities in the twentieth-century U.S. West and illuminates why agricultural workers never saw collective justice in Colorado.\n\nFLETCHER JONES FOUNDATION FELLOW\n\nHilary Buxton, Assistant Professor, History, Kenyon College\n\nTopic: Disabled Empire: Race, Care and the First World War in Imperial Britain\n\nHilary Buxton is an Assistant Professor of History at Kenyon College. She is a historian of modern imperial Britain, focusing on histories of colonial intimacy and the production of knowledge. At the Huntington, she is working on the completion of her book manuscript, Disabled Empire: Race, Care, and the First World War in Imperial Britain. The project examines the experiences of wounded and disabled British colonial servicemen, their relationship with caregivers and the imperial state, and the lasting medical inequities produced out of this transcolonial encounter. Her articles have appeared in Past & Present and the British Journal for the History of Science. She earned her PhD in History at Rutgers University, and was a Past & Present Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Historical Research at the University of London before joining Kenyon.\n\nKEMBLE FELLOW IN MARITIME HISTORY\n\nHayley Cotter, Lecturer, English, University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nTopic: From Shipboard to Book Board: A Material History of Early Modern Maritime Law\n\nHayley Cotter is a lecturer in the English Department and Writing Program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is a scholar of early modern literature and culture, with a particular interest in the maritime law of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

She is the author of Home Rule: Households, Manhood, and National Expansion on the Eighteenth-Century Kentucky Frontier (Yale University Press, 2015). She is currently writing a multigenerational history of an enslaved family that sued for freedom claiming Indigenous ancestry. Currently titled, \"The Book of Judith: A Story of Law, Family, and Mixed-Race Ancestry in Slavery and Freedom,\" the book reconstructs the legal and personal stories of family that claimed descent from an Apalachee woman taken captive in Florida and trafficked to South Carolina and Virginia. Generations of this family sued for freedom in jurisdictions throughout Virginia, Kentucky Tennessee, and Mississippi, cultivating their legal strategies and sharing genealogical knowledge through family and community networks across the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\n\nMOLINA FELLOW IN THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE & ALLIED SCIENCES\n\nShannon McHugh, Associate Professor, Romance Languages & Literatures, University of Massachusetts Boston\n\nTopic: Women’s Reproductive Lives in Renaissance French and Italian Lyric Poetry\n\nShannon McHugh is Associate Professor of French and Italian at University of Massachusetts Boston. Her research focuses on early modern literature and gender, with emphases including lyric poetry, the Counter-Reformation, and the history of participatory fan culture. Her new book, Petrarch and the Making of Gender in Renaissance Italy (Amsterdam University Press, 2023), examines how men and women of the Italian Renaissance used poetry to construct new, fluid, and sometimes radical gendered possibilities. She has co-edited the volumes Vittoria Colonna: Poetry, Religion, Art, Impact (with Virginia Cox, 2021) and Innovation in the Italian Counter-Reformation (with Anna Wainwright, 2020) and co-translated Writings on the Sisters of San Luca and Their Miraculous Madonna (with Danielle Callegari, 2015). Her Huntington project studies the history of women’s reproductive bodies by comparing early modern medical texts’ depictions of childbearing, pregnancy loss, birth, and nursing with those found in poetry by men and women from Italy and France.\n\nNEH FELLOW\n\nErika Pérez, Associate Professor, History, University of Arizona\n\nTopic: Knowing Her Place: Gender Regimes, Sexual Cultures, and Regulation in Nineteenth-Century California\n\nErika Pérez is an Associate Professor of History at the University of Arizona where she teaches U.S. women’s history, Mexican American history, North American borderlands, and U.S. sports history. She is currently working on her second book project, tentatively titled Knowing Her Place: Gender Regimes, Sexual Cultures, and Regulation in Nineteenth-Century California. In it, she examines evolving sexual and gender regimes in the aftermath of the U.S.-Mexico War. She looks at diverse ethnic and racial groups and how they contested and shaped gender and sexual ideals and popular discourse. Her research focuses on vice and underground economies, courtship and premarital sex, child brides and elopements, seduction and breach of marriage, age of consent law, the sensationalistic press and popular culture, and moral reform. Pérez is the author of Colonial Intimacies: Interethnic Kinship, Sexuality, and Marriage in Southern California, 1769-1885 (University of Oklahoma Press, 2018). She has published articles in the Pacific Historical Review, California History, and Early American Studies.\n\nNEH FELLOW\n\nAbigail Swingen, Associate Professor, History, Texas Tech University\n\nTopic: The Financial Revolution and the Politics of Moral Crisis in Early Modern Britain\n\nAbigail Swingen is an Associate Professor of history at Texas Tech University. Her research interests include the origins of the British empire, ideas of political economy, and the cultural and political consequences of economic change. Her first book, Competing Visions of Empire: Labor, Slavery, and the Origins of the British Atlantic Empire (Yale University Press, 2015), explores how English politics and ideas of political economy influenced the development of African slavery and other forms of coerced labor in England's West Indies colonies during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Her current book, “The Financial Revolution and the Politics of Moral Crisis in Early Modern Britain” focuses on moments of political and cultural crisis from the mid-1600s to the mid-1700s to explore how and why a revolution in finance occurred and how contemporaries understood and responded to it. It will argue that changes associated with Britain’s Financial Revolution must be understood as integrally connected to violence in terms of the growth of the fiscal-military state, Britain’s imperial conquests and participation in the transatlantic slave trade, as well as in relation to political and social upheaval and popular politics. This project has received financial support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Summer Stipend Program, the Huntington Library UK Travel Grant, as well as an NEH Award for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (2024-25). She has previously had fellowships at the Huntington Library and the Beinecke Library at Yale, and serves as a general editor for the Politics, Society and Culture in Early Modern Britain Series at Manchester University Press.\n\nBARBARA THOM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW\n\nJennifer Saracino, Assistant Professor, History of Art/Architecture, University of Arizona\n\nTopic: The Uppsala Map (c. 1541): Indigenous Visions of Mexico-Tenochtitlan\n\nDr. Jennifer Saracino is an assistant professor of Art History at the University of Arizona. Her research focuses on Indigenous cartographic traditions of Central Mexico, cross-cultural interactions between mendicant friars and Indigenous communities, and the impact of these exchanges on the visual culture of early colonial Mexico. Her works also investigates Nahua relationships to the natural and built environment as reflected in the visual culture of early colonial Mexico. Her work has appeared in the journals Imago Mundi and Artl@s Bulletin as well as the edited volume Mapping Nature Across the Americas (University of Chicago, 2020) and the forthcoming Collective Creativity and Artistic Agency in Colonial Latin America (University of Florida, 2022.) Her current book project focuses on the Uppsala Map of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, the earliest known map of Mexico City painted by Indigenous artists after Spanish Conquest. Her research and scholarship have been supported with fellowships from the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library & Collection, the Newberry Library, the American Society for Environmental History, and the John Carter Brown Library. Dr. Saracino received her joint PhD in Art History and Latin American studies from Tulane University.\n\nBARBARA THOM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW\n\nJessica Beckman, Assistant Professor, English, Dartmouth College\n\nTopic: The Kinetic Text: A Poetics of Movement in the Age of Print\n\nJessica Beckman is an Assistant Professor of English at Dartmouth College, specializing in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century poetics and material texts. At the Huntington, she will focus on revising her first book manuscript, entitled The Kinetic Text, which offers a new account of early modern poetics that incorporates the tactile, spatial, and discontinuous ways that early readers engaged their books. The project not only explores how these readers embraced the expressive potential of early print, but also how emerging forms such as the sonnet sequence and the prose fiction demanded dynamic and variable reading to produce poetic effects. Her research has appeared or is forthcoming in The Spenser Review, Spenser Studies, and Exemplaria, and has been supported by grants and fellowships from the Leslie Center for the Humanities, the Huntington Library, and the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, among other institutions. Her next project, Unstable Character in the English Renaissance, explores the materiality of literary character before the rise of narrative realism.\n\nBARBARA THOM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW\n\nKristina Borrman, Assistant Professor, School of Design and Construction, Washington State University\n\nTopic: Banking by Design: Paul Revere Williams and the Architectures of Financial Activism\n\nKristina Borrman is the Assistant Professor of Social Justice in the Built Environment at the School of Design and Construction at Washington State University. Broadly speaking, Borrman’s scholarship focuses on the relationship between the built environment and the instantiation of social identity in the modern world. By approaching 20th-century world history within the context of architecture, she examines everyday life—the ethics of ordinary choices— to reveal ways in which race, class, and space are mutually constitutive. At the Huntington, she will research her book manuscript. “Banking by Design: Paul Revere Williams and the Architectures of Financial Activism” explores the legacy of Williams and Black-owned banks in Los Angeles, where they not only countered the discriminatory practice of redlining but also established tourist attractions in bank lobbies and cafeterias that celebrated Black wealth and heritage. This study of Paul Revere Williams reveals for the first time how the architect pursued financial equity during his long career, providing insight into one architect’s fight against redlining. The story of Williams helps us better understand the growth of Black wealth in Los Angeles where people fought for their right to the city by challenging the mainstream financial infrastructure that unevenly distributed capital and business opportunities.\n\nFLETCHER JONES FOUNDATION FELLOW IN THE HUNTINGTON-UC PROGRAM FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE HUMANITIES\n\nSavannah Esquivel, Assistant Professor, Art History, University of California - Riverside\n\nTopic: The Sights and Sounds of the Colonial Mexican Monastery\n\nSavannah Esquivel is the 2023-2024 Fletcher Jones Foundation Fellow in The Huntington-UC Program for the Advancement of the Humanities, an innovative partnership designed to advance the humanities at public universities. She specializes in the art and material culture of the Hispanic Americas, with a particular emphasis on Mexico. Her research focuses on the artistic and sociopolitical interventions made by Nahua communities within Catholic built spaces in colonial Mexico. Current article-length projects investigate the soundscape of Franciscan convent churches, landscape mural painting, and the ecological impacts of settler-colonialism in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, and discourses of Indigenous presence and absence in Spanish colonial sources and art historical methodologies.
