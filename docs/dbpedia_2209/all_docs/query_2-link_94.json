        "text": "When Phil Mickelson won the Masters last April, it ended his reign as The Best Player Never to Win a Major. Frustrated Phil wore the green jacket like a royal vestment, and in doing so he discarded his dubious title. Now, someone else has to bear the burden, to wear the unwanted mantle of the best 'never' man. No one is better suited to it than Sergio García.\n\nOn 9 January García turned 25 and has embarked upon his seventh season as a professional. In his first tournament of the year he finished tied for tenth at the Mercedes Championship in Hawaii. At a tender age he has been around long enough to be considered a seasoned pro. Will this be the season that García breaks through to win his first major despite the fact that no European has won one of the big four since Paul Lawrie won the Open at Carnoustie in 1999?\n\nThe Spaniard, then only 19 and a pro rookie, tantalised us so when he battled Tiger Woods down to the wire in the 1999 USPGA Championship. He finished second but captured the hearts and minds of the golf world with his aggressive game and impish allure. That second-place finish stands as García's best in a major. He has fourth-place finishes at both the Masters and US Open and had three consecutive top 10s at the Open, a string that came to an end last year when he missed the cut at Royal Troon.\n\nThere are three players in the top 10 of the world rankings without a major - Padraig Harrington, Stewart Cink and García. Of those three, García has the best overall performance in majors, has been in the heat of battle more often for the game's most coveted trophies. In other words, he has earned the title of Best Player Never to Win a Major, and there is a certain honour in that achievement.\n\n'I'm 24, almost 25, and they're putting me on that list already,' said García at the Mercedes Championship. 'But it's a good thing because they consider you a good golfer, a good player. But, you know, it's something that you can't rush. You have to keep giving yourself chances.'\n\nGarcía had a strong year in 2004 with two PGA Tour victories and one European Tour win in Mallorca. He had a fourth place in the Masters and twentieth at the US Open, but missed the cuts at the Open and the USPGA Championship. He has now played nearly two full seasons with a retooled swing (gone are the infinite waggles, the overswing) and he's now waiting for his putting to catch-up with his long game. 'The long game, it was great, the best of my career,' says García of his 2004 season. 'Unfortunately my putting, it wasn't nearly as close to being as good as my long game. If I had been putting a little bit better, I probably would have had four easy, good chances of winning more tournaments last year.'\n\nIt won't come as a surprise to Retief Goosen if García wins a major, and soon. 'Sergio is starting to mature quite a bit on the course,' says Goosen, the defending US Open champion. 'In the past he was maybe too anxious, got too down on himself. He's worked a lot on his temperament and I think that will go a long way for him. He hits the ball very well, has a great short game. He's not a bad putter and, if makes a few, he might make a lot. He's got the tools to win a major.'\n\nGarcía's first-round partner at the Mercedes was seasoned PGA Tour pro Joey Sindelar, an astute observer of players and the game. 'He's a gamer,' says Sindelar. 'He's out for blood. He's looking for a piece of meat to chew on and, when he gets it, he's good at it. There was a point in the middle of the round where he wasn't firing on all cylinders, but he hung in there. That's what the great guys do. The more I've been out here, the more I understand that they are the guys who get it up and down from everywhere, who hang, hang, hang and then at the end of the week they are hanging on to the trophy.'\n\nThe Mercedes was a good start to the year where García finished at 11 under par. As a consequence of his membership of both the PGA Tour and European Tour, and by a quirk of scheduling, García's first round on European soil on the European tour this year will be at the Open at St Andrews. If his game is sharp and the luck of the links goes his way, it could also be his first major championship.\n\n'As soon as the first one comes, it should be a bit easier,' says García with a smile."
