At WSU, Conley played center on Coach Jack Friel's championship basketball team of 1950, and he pitched for Coach Buck Bailey's 1950 Cougar team that won the Northern Division and District Eight and finished second in the College World Series.\n\nIKE DEETER (1978)\n\nIssac Ferguson \"Ike\" Deeter provided inspiration, leadership and first class instruction to WSU students and Cougar boxing teams for more than three decades beginning in 1930. His teams won eight Pacific Coast titles and 53 individual crowns. The 1937 Cougars were National Intercollegiate Champions and Deeter had 14 individual national champs over the years. An outstanding middleweight, Deeter won two Coast titles and the Northwest Golden Gloves for the Cougars as an undergraduate. Born in Hartline, Deeter entered WSU from North Central High School of Spokane where he was an outstanding football Athlete.\n\nCARL DIETZ (2012)\n\nWho is the greatest athlete in the history of Washington State Athletics? Would Carl Dietz come to mind? Dietz played football from 1912-15, and was captain of the team as a senior. He was a standout on the track and field team, competing in the shot put, javelin, long jump (broad jump), 440-yard dash and as a member of the school's record setting mile relay team. Dietz was the star of WSC's first Rose Bowl team (1915 season) and in WSC's 14-0 Rose Bowl win over Brown University, rushed for 105 yards and scored one of the team's two touchdowns, in addition to handling punting and kicking duties. While no MVP was selected following the Rose Bowl, the tournament of Roses Committee later named him the most valuable player of the game. He also was selected to the 1915 All-Northwest team. Following his playing career at WSC, Dietz remained at the school, serving as a football assistant coach. Dietz then enlisted with the Marines and received his captain's commission at Quantico, Virginia, where he also met his future wife. In 1919 he returned to WSC, where he was a football assistant coach in the fall and a freshman basketball coach in the winter. He also began helping with the track team. He passed away, Oct. 5, 1924. In its story on his passing, The Evergreen, stated Dietz was the greatest athlete in the history of the State College of Washington.\n\n\"LONE STAR\" DIETZ (1983)\n\nTruly a legend in his own time, Dietz had a fantastic career as WSU's football coach from 1915 through 1917, winning 17, losing only two, with one tie. His teams shut out 15 of 19 opponents in those three seasons. In his very first season he guided WSU to the Rose Bowl and a 14-0 shutout of Ivy League foe Brown. That team won seven straight and allowed just one touchdown and one field goal all year. They had five shutouts. A year later WSU was 4-2 and in 1917 he finished his career with the Cougars at 6-0-1. In 1919, as coach of the Mare Island (Calif.) Marines, he returned to the Rose Bowl against the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. Dietz was a teammate at Carlisle College of the immortal Jim Thorpe and was coached by Glenn \"Pop\" Warner.\n\nJOHN DIVINE (2012)\n\nJohn Divine can be credited with propelling the Washington State College track and field distance program to national prominence long before the spikes of Gerry Lindgren and Henry Rono graced the hills and dales of the Palouse. Divine was WSC's first collegiate distance champion, winning the NCAA title in the two-mile run in 1925 as just a sophomore and only two years removed from Spokane's Lewis and Clark High. The lone Cougar at the '25 national championships, Divine set the school record time of 9-minutes, 22.8 seconds at the NCAA meet in Chicago. That same year he had won all four dual meets he entered and placed fourth in the Pacific Coast Conference before winning the national collegiate title. During his junior season Divine had three dual wins in the two-mile and finished third at the PCC meet. As a senior on the 1927 Cougar track team, dubbed a \"weak sister\" by the Chinook yearbook, Divine was second in the mile and third in the two-mile at the Northern Division meet. The Chinook also described Divine as \"infallible\" and his induction as a Pioneer into the WSU Athletics Hall of Fame is certainly well-deserved.\n\nJAMES DONALDSON (2006)\n\nThis 7-foot-2 center from Sacramento, Calif., had an outstanding career with the Cougar basketball squad, 1976-79, played 14 seasons in the NBA and now owns Donaldson Fitness and Physical Therapy, with four offices in the Seattle business area.

Doornink, 31, was a star on the gridiron and also in the classroom, posting a 3.6 grade-point-average while earning football honors as well. He was a Pacific-8 Conference scholar-athlete winner, received the WSU YMCA sponsored Athletic Director award and was an academic All-America second team pick.

Doornink has graduated from the University of Washington Medical School this past June with honors.\n\nPETE DUNCAN (2012)\n\nBorn Sept. 7, 1948 in Victoria, British Columbia, Peter James Duncan became the first Canadian named to the NCAA All-American team when he was selected as a third baseman in 1970. That season, he led the Pac-8 with a .423 batting average in conference games and a .379 mark overall while tying a then-WSU record for hits with 58. Duncan was named Pac-8 and NCAA District 8 First Team in 1970. The Cougars won the Pac-8 in 1970, and Duncan was honored as the team's Most Inspirational Player. He made seven relief appearances in his Cougar career and, after spending one season at third base in the Kansas City Royals' organization, he was converted to a full-time pitcher. He spent four seasons in the minor leagues as a hurler where he was 28-18 with a 2.54 ERA in 407 innings.\n\nHUBERT DUNN (2006)\n\nHubert \"Hubie\" Dunn became WSU's first full time gymnastics coach in 1947 after earning four varsity letters in the sport from Southern Illinois University. Considered by many as \"the father of Northwest gymnastics\", Dunn led his Cougar teams to three Pacific Northwest College Championships and three Pacific Northwest AAU titles. Following his last WSU season, Dunn was named Outstanding Coach of the Western Area of the United States. From 1967-68, Dunn served as president of the National Gymnastics Coaches Association and was inducted into the Helms Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1973.

She scored 1,967 points during her four-year career, more than any Cougar before or since, male or female. The former Walla Walla High All-American set the WSU javelin record as a sophomore and the mark still stands, the oldest record on the books. After pacing WSU in just about every statistical category during her freshman and sophomore basketball seasons, Eggart took a year off from hoops and turned her attention to track in an attempt to make the USA Olympic Team. Her efforts almost paid off when she finished fourth at the 1980 Olympic Trials, missing third place on the team on the last throw of competition. One of WSU's most dominant basketball Athletes of all time, she was an All-Northwest Basketball League pick four times and three times was selected to the Kodak Region IX all-star team. She was an all-academic pick boasting a 3.4 grade point average and was three times named the Inland Empire's Female Athlete of the Year. The former Clarkston High coach is now girls' basketball and track coach at Mead High in Spokane. Married to Mike Helfer.\n\nCRAIG EHLO (2009)\n\nWhen the name Craig Ehlo comes up around the water cooler, several images come to mind, including floppy blond hair and long arms that always seemed to be in the opponent's passing lanes. Great teams were also a trademark during the two years Ehlo played for head coach George Raveling, 1982 and 1983. In his senior season he paced WSU to the NCAA regionals at Boise, where the Cougars beat Weber State and lost to No. 1 seed Virginia. Most Cougar fans remember his 91 steals in two years, or 135 assists, including 135 as a senior when he spent most of his time at point guard. He was, in addition, a talented offensive player who shot a school record 55 percent from the field during conference games in 1983. Twice Ehlo received the Jud Heathcote Award for inspiration before embarking on a 14-year NBA career with stops in Houston, Cleveland, Atlanta and Seattle. A frequent visitor to WSU games from his home near Spokane, Ehlo moved into the broadcast booth several years ago, providing color commentary for local universities and the NBA. He also spent a stint coaching basketball in the high school ranks.\n\nCLEM EISCHEN (1983)\n\nEischen was a standout trackster in the middle distances during his high school and collegiate careers. He won the state mile title in 1944 for Vancouver High and the 880 title a year later. As a freshman at WSU he was fifth in the NCAA 1500. Clem was sixth in the event in 1948 Games in 1948 and then second in the USA Olympic Trials. He competed in the 1948 Games in London in the 1500 finals. In 1951 he was second at the NCAA meet in the 880. After leaving WSU he taught at Fort Vancouver High and his 1961 Trapper track team won the state team title. Clem entered the physical therapy business in 1962 and has been in the field since then in the Portland-Vancouver area.\n\nCARL ELLINGSEN (1980)\n\nCarl \"Tuffy\" Ellingsen was a four-sport star at WSU in 1929-31.

He coached at John Rogers High in Spokane from 1938 until his retirement in 1971 and also served as athletic director. He won five football titles in 13 years and his 1950 club was state runnerup.\n\nDON ELLINGSEN (1984)\n\nAn outstanding wide receiver for the Cougars, few remember the track exploits of Don Ellingsen, including a school pole vault record of 14-3 1/2 in 1958. He still ranks seventh on the WSU career reception list with 86 for 1,166 yards and seven touchdowns. His junior year of \"57 he grabbed 45 passes for 559 yards, leading the PCC and ranking third in the nation in total receptions. He earned All-PCC, AP All-West Coast first team honors, third team AP All-American recognition. He is probably best remembered for his 89-yard kickoff return for a touchdown at USC in 1957 in a 13-12 WSU victory. In 1957 named Inland Empire Athlete of the Year, and in 1958-59 WSU's Athlete of the Year. His father Carl \"Tuffy\" Ellingsen, was inducted into the WSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\nJACK ELWAY (2012)\n\nJack Elway, now considered as one of the primary innovators of the passing game, came to Washington State as a quarterback and later returned as an assistant coach for Jim Sweeney's Cougars from 1972-75. During his time as an assistant on the Palouse, Elway helped guide the Cougs to post a pair of wins over Washington and Oregon. He left WSU to take over the Cal State Northridge program and went 20-11-1 in three seasons before taking the San Jose State job and posting a 35-20-1 record in his five seasons, earning PCAA Coach of the Year honors in 1980-81.

His baseball teams won 664 games, 11 conference titles and 18 league and regional championships. The NWAACC championship trophy is named in his honor.\n\nDICK FARMAN (1990)\n\nTo say Dick Farman's football career at Washington State University had a bizarre start might be an understatement, but to say he went on to a great football career collegiately and professionally and then an even greater career merchandising pickles is in no way an understatement. The 1940 Cougar graduate played his first collegiate game for the Crimson and Gray after sneaking on the team train to Los Angeles and dressing for the WSU-USC game in 1936. Not authorized to make the LA trip, Farman showed up, dressed, played well and earned a spot for the rest of the season on coach Babe Hollingbery's 1936 club. As they say, the rest is history. Truly an \"iron man\" for the Cougars, Farman played guard for 589 minutes out of a possible 600 minutes during the 1938 season. Co-Captain of the WSU squad as a senior, he completed his collegiate career by playing in the East-West Shrine Game. A year later found the Iowa native and Kent (Wash.) High graduate playing professional football with the Washington Redskins. An All-Pro pick, Farman played on three divisional title teams and one World Championship club, 1942. In 1944, Farman and his brother Fred formed the Farman Pickle Company, adopting the nickname, \"The Pickle People.\" While pickles have been his game since then, Farman also had a short coaching stint with WSU. During the middle of the 1945 season, he responded to Athletic Director Dr. Fred Bohler's plea to help coach the line. His short season of coaching resulted in a 4-0-1 record. Farman Pickles was sold in 1987 to Curtis-Burns Foods, but Farman was not ready to retire. He continues to serve as president and CEO of the Farman Division. He also has been active in many area civic organizations, including Rotary and the YMCA. Ladies and gentlemen, Dick Farman.\n\nDOUG FLANSBURG (2012)\n\nA member of the \"Cardiac Kids,\" local product Doug Flansburg arrived on campus in 1964 and during his four years developed into one of the finest receivers in program history. In just his third game during the 1965 season, Flansburg caught a five-yard touchdown pass from Tom Roth at Indiana. The subsequent two-point conversion lifted the Cougars to an 8-7 victory; with the last two plays being run after time had expired. That season Flansburg led WSU with 46 receptions for 578 yards. During his junior campaign he caught a career-high 54 passes, including a WSU-record 12 receptions against Houston. That mark stands today as the single-game record for the Cougars and helped Flansburg to First Team All-West Coast and All-Pacific Coast Conference honors. He led the team in receptions for the third-straight season as a senior and capped the year by participating in the 1968 Hula Bowl. He finished his career second to Hugh Campbell in career receptions with 139 and third in receiving yards with 1,652. An agriculture major at WSU, he continues to run the Flansburg farming operation in Palouse.\n\nDALE FORD (1983)\n\nKnown as \"The Whale\", Ford is one of WSU's greatest all-around athletes, but baseball was where he excelled. He played in the early and mid-1960's, graduating in 1966. Ford won eight varsity letters in three sports during an era when freshmen couldn't play varsity sports. Dale was a quarterback for two years, won three basketball letters, and was an NCAA record-setting home run hitter in baseball for three years. In 1966 he set an NCAA mark with 17 home runs and at one time held WSU records for home runs in a season, career batting average (.365) and season slugging percentage (.857). He played with the Cub and Angel organizations before knee injuries ended his career. Ford is now a business executive in the Seattle area.\n\nEARL FOSTER (1979)\n\nOften called \"The Man who built WSU's Athletic plant - best of its era\" - Earl V. Foster served Graduate Manager at Washington State University from 1925 to 1946. Foster was an undergraduate in 1919-23 and lettered three years in baseball for the Cougars. As Graduate Manager he was instrumental in the construction of Bohler Gymnasium, Hollingbery field and the university golf course, and in the enlargement of the football stadium. Foster hired coaches Babe Hollingbery, Buck Bailey, Jack Friel and others, and helped pioneer sports broadcasting over KWSU. He also introduced Dads' Day to the WSU calendar.\n\nWES FOSTER (1982)\n\nWes Foster was the first great black sprinter at Washington State University and one of the first of his race to win national attention for the Pacific Northwest in track. Set a world high school record of 5.3 seconds in the 50-yard dash and State records of 9.8 in the 100 and 21.7 in the 220 on the same day in 1925. Also set a World, American and Collegiate record for 175 yards at 16.6 in 1928.\n\nJACK FRIEL (1978)\n\nHead Basketball Coach at WSU from 1928 to 1958. Born in Waterville and played basketball and baseball at WSU. Returned to his Alma Mater as head coach after successful years at Colville and (North Central) Spokane. Developed \"platoon\" system in basketball and instigated one-and-one bonus free throw rule. His 1941 team won Western title and was runnerup for NCAA crown. Coached baseball in war years and was first Commissioner of Big Sky Conference, 1967-71. Member of Helms College Basketball Hall of Fame and winner of the \"Metropolitan Award\" from nation's collegiate basketball coaches in 1977 for contributions to the game.\n\nDAN FRISELLA (2012)\n\nBorn March 4, 1946 in San Francisco, Daniel Vincent Frisella was a 1963 graduate of Serra High School in San Mateo, Calif. After attending the College of San Mateo, Frisella transferred to Washington State where he was a key member of the Cougar pitching staff in 1965 and 1966. His 0.743 WHIP in 1965 is second-best in school history and his 108 strikeouts in 1966 are a Washington State record for the wood bat era. Frisella recorded five shutouts in his Cougar career, one shy of the Washington State record. He was part of the 1965 team that won the Pac-8 Northern Division and NCAA District 8 titles on its way to the College World Series. He was 17-1 in his Cougar career and helped Washington State win the 1966 Pac-8 Northern Division crown. A third round selection by the New York Mets in the June Secondary Phase of the 1966 MLB Draft, Frisella was with the Mets by 1967. He played for the Mets from 1967-72, then spent the next four seasons pitching for four-different big league clubs. He made 351 appearances in MLB, won 34 games and registered 57 saves.\n\nRICHARD FRY (2009)\n\nThe numbers of Cougar football faithful who have not read articles by Richard Fry over the past 50-plus years are few and far between. Fry, who trekked north from his native California in the late 1940's to work for United Press International and then ended up at WSC in 1952, has been writing game program stories almost from the start of his Cougar career. After five years of writing alumni news, Fry moved into the sports information director role in 1957, then in 1970 took over as director of news and information services for the school. However, his love of sports and ability to weave together sports stories you can't stop reading didn't end when he left athletics. He has continued to author stories in just about every WSU game day program printed. All the aforementioned volume of work takes a back seat to what he did after officially retiring in 1985. Within a matter of years he embarked on a three-year project to produce a coffee table book of stories about hundreds of Cougar legends. The Crimson and The Gray - 100 years with the WSU Cougars, was one of three books produced for WSU's 100-year anniversary, and by far the most popular, thanks to Richard Fry's enthralling ability to spin a yarn.\n\nBOB GAMBOLD (1988)\n\nBob Gambold has seen it all during his illustrious football career. He has gone from a junior varsity quarterback as a freshman at WSU to the Super Bowl, with success and fond memories throughout. Gambold was a two sport star for the Cougars from 1948 through 1951, quarterbacking WSU football teams and directing Jack Friel coached basketball teams. As a junior, he quarterbacked Phil Sarboe's final Cougar team, then as a senior Forest Evashevski's first WSU team. A fine all-around athlete, Gambold showed his versatility as a senior, throwing for over 700 yards, catching five passes, punting six times and even returning kickoffs. He then switched uniforms and was picked to the Northern Division basketball team after leading WSU in scoring. The previous season, he was a starter as WSU won the Northern Division title. After graduating in 1952, the Longview native and R.A. Long High graduate entered the coaching ranks, first at Everett JC. He returned to the Cougars in the late 1950's for Jim Sutherland, then went on to Oregon State and Stanford before joining John Ralston with the Denver Broncos. His Bronco stint included the 1977 Super Bowl. Gambold spent five years with the Houston Oilers and has been on the Illinois staff since 1983.\n\nDIXIE GARNER (2012)\n\nDixon John \"Dixie\" Garner was a man who had worldly ambitions. Born in Seattle, Garner prepped at Lincoln High before heading east to Pullman. He lettered in track and field at Washington State College in 1938, '39 and '40, running for highly successful Cougar coach Karl Schlademan, who is also a 2011 WSU Hall of Fame Pioneer Inductee. While at WSC, Garner became one of the nation's top two-milers, setting the American, collegiate and world records in a time when training encompassed only five months a year. In 1939 he ran a two-mile time of 9-minutes, 7.9 seconds at the San Francisco World's Fair, defeating Miklos Szabo of Hungary, who was the reigning world record holder. Team captain as a senior, Garner was the Northern Division champion and NCAA runner-up in the two-mile race and also ran on the Cougar two-mile relay team that set indoor collegiate and world records with a time of 8:01.4. He was considered a sure bet to make 1942 US Olympic team but the Games were cancelled by World War II. Garner graduated from WSC in 1941 with a degree in physical education but became a Navy flight instructor aiding in the war efforts. He died in 1984.\n\nBOB GARY (1989)\n\nRobert R. \"Bob\" Gary, who prepped at Seattle's Garfield High in the late 1940's, was one of the greatest sprinters ever at Washington State. He won two city sprint titles as a senior at Garfield High in Seattle, had served one year as class president and participated in three sports, football, basketball and track. During his Cougar tenure he captured four Northern Division titles over 100 yards and three 220-yard titles. He captured four Pacific Coast Conference championships, two each in the sprint events. At the NCAA Championships, he was runnerup in the 220 and third in the 100. A year later he placed fourth in the 220. Gary totally dominated the sprint events against Northwest opponents. As a junior and senior, he never lost a sprint race to Oregon, Washington, OSU or Idaho. As a junior Gary won the Northern Division sprint titles at 100 and 220 yards and the PCC title at 220. The next season he came back to capture both events in both the ND and PCC Championships. Gary completed his military duty in 1958 and returned to Garfield High as a teacher, coach and finally an administrator. In 1968 he joined the Renton School District, then in 1970 began a long and distinguished career with the Seattle School District. The noted administrator also has been extremely active in Seattle community affairs.\n\nBILL GASKINS (1990)\n\nBill Gaskins has not been one to stray far from home, proving you can stay local and still achieve greatness. A 1962 graduate of Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, Gaskins made the journey to Pullman and, with the exception of some professional football in Canada, hasn't left the golden wheat land of the Palouse. Gaskins was a member of Jim Sutherland's final WSU team in 1963 and then played his final two seasons for Bert Clark. Gaskins truly made safety play poetry in motion while at the same time seeing duty as a kick return specialist and occasionally as a running back. He picked off five passes as a senior, the second most ever by a Cougar, and finished his career with seven in an era when teams played fewer games and threw less. Gaskins was recognized for his senior-season exploits by being named to the United Press International and Newspaper Enterprise Association All-America second teams, along with All-West Coast honors by Associated Press and the Pacific-8 Conference coaches. He also was honored with the WSU Bohler Award, given annually to a member of the Cougar team who exhibits the inspiration of former athletic leader J. Fred Bohler. Also a hurdler for the Cougar track team during his collegiate career, Gaskins spent two years with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League before returning to Pullman to pursue his pharmacy career. An active member of Pullman Rotary and past member of the Pullman City Council, Gaskins joined the staff of the Pullman Memorial Hospital in 1970 as pharmacy manager. While maintaining that position, he also has served as an instructor of clinical pharmacy since 1970. A starter at Cougar track meets and other area track events, Gaskins also serves as a football official in the Pacific-10 Conference. Tonight Bill is in Tempe, Arizona, where he is preparing to officiate tomorrow's Arizona State football game. Accepting on his behalf is his wife, Felicia Gaskins.\n\nED GAYDA (1983)\n\nOut of Hoquiam, Gayda was the big man in Jack Friel's program in the late 1940's. He earned four varsity letters and as a senior in 1950 led WSU to the Northern Division crown and later won the Bill Rusch Memorial Inspirational Award. He was all-Northern Division as a junior and senior and his 643 conference points was a school record. Gayda scored 1,061 career points and was drafted by the Tri-City Blackhawks, later to be the Atlanta Hawks. He played part of a season, then entered private business. Ed is now retired and living at Ocean Shores, Wash.\n\nDALE GENTRY (1988)\n\nDale Gentry was at home on the gridiron, on the hardwood court and on the diamond. He earned eight varsity letters between 1937 and 1941, then went on to play professional football before moving into the coaching ranks, also with WSU. He is, however, best remembered as a first team All-American end during the fall of 1941. His gridiron exploits earned him All-America recognition as well as a spot on the All-West Coast team and a position on the East-West Shrine game. Another highlight of Gentry's career came in 1941 when he was a starter on WSU's basketball team that battled to the NCAA finals before falling to Wisconsin. Gentry was the number five scorer on that club. His success was not limited to athletics. Gentry was selected one of the top 10 seniors at WSU in 1941-42. He entered the Navy during World War II and served aboard the USS Orca, 1944-45, earning five battle stars during eight invasion. He went on to star with the Los Angeles Dons of the American Football League in the late 1940s, earning All-Pro honors twice. After leaving professional ball, the Walla Walla High graduate was in private business and also spent four years on Al Kircher's WSU staff, 1952-55. Gentry died in 1968 in Portland, Oregon.\n\nDOUG GIBB (2012)\n\nDoug Gibb's impact at Washington State University is felt every day by the current student-athletes at WSU, who practice and compete in the facility that bears his name. For more than three decades Gibb served the program as a student-athlete and coach. In recognition of his services, the swimming facility at WSU is named Gibb Pool. He swam at WSC from 1940-41, and during his senior season at Washington State, Gibb was the team point leader while swimming the 100, 200 and 440-yard freestyle events. He took over coaching duties of the program in 1942 and in that season the Cougars won the Pacific Coast Conference Northern Division title. Gibb served as head coach at Washington State for 32 years, until 1974, earning the distinction of dean of the PCC and Pac-8 coaches and was the recipient of numerous coaching honors. His son, Paul, also swam for WSU.\n\nBOYD GITTINS (2012)\n\nFor a man who rose from obscurity to being a member of the USA Olympic team in one season, Boyd Gittins took much longer to relinquish the WSU intermediate hurdles record. An incredible 41 years, to be exact. Gittins' athletic history was as remarkable for its brevity as it was for its sterling performances. Gittins aspired to be a miler and arrived at WSU having only run the 400m hurdles twice. Yet, under the tutelage of Cougar coach Jack Mooberry, in 1968 Gittins finished third in the Pac-8 Championships, second at the NCAA meet, and qualified for the U.S. Olympic team by tying an existing world record in the intermediate hurdles of 49.1 seconds. In Los Angeles to qualify for the Olympic Trials, officials released a flock of pigeons during his event and Gittins was hit in the eye with bird-droppings, dislodging a contact. He finished fifth, not a qualifier, but later won a consolation race to earn spot on the team. A pre-trip vaccine caused muscle stiffness and Gittins pulled a hamstring, keeping him from competing in 1968 Mexico City Games and hampering his 1969 performances. At the '69 NCAA meet, Gittins contracted food poisoning the night before his race but he recovered only to break a bone in his foot on the first hurdle, finishing fifth.\n\nGORDON GLADSON (2012)\n\nGordon Gladson, nicknamed the \"Rock\", was just that for the Cougars from 1952-55. Gladson was a two-sport star in football and as a boxer for the Cougs. The Bremerton, Wash., native was a three-time NCAA boxing champion, winning the titles in 1952 (178 lbs), 1954 (165 lbs) and 1955 (178 lbs) including a perfect 13-0 mark in 1954. In 1955, Gladson capped his WSC career with a 9-2 mark along with his third-consecutive NCAA title. As a Coug, he claimed three PCI boxing titles, putting him second on WSC's PCI title list behind Jack Melson's four. Gladson went on to teach and coach in Western Washington for a number of years and later in Palmer, Alaska.\n\nED GODDARD (1978)\n\nNamed to All-American teams in all three Varsity seasons (1934-36) at WSU. A triple-threat back, nick-named \"The Escondido Express\" (for hometown of Escondido, Calif.). Goddard was picked for Liberty Magazine's All-Athletes' All-American in his sophomore season and again as a junior. Selections were based on the percentage of votes a Athlete received from opponents. Goddard received the largest percentage of any Athlete on the All-American team. He was a first team UPI selection at quarterback in his senior season of 1936 and played in the East-West Shrine game.\n\nHARRY GOLDSWORTHY (1993)\n\nFrom his days as an iron man football Athlete for the Washington Agricultural College to managing the family farm in the rolling Palouse Hills to serving in the Washington legislature, Harry Goldsworthy did it all during his illustrious career. Goldsworthy enrolled at WSU (then WAC) in 1904 out of Oakesdale High and for the next four falls was a prominent member of Cougar grid teams. Normally an end and occasionally a center, he captained WSU's undefeated team of 1906 that never allowed an opponent to score while winning all six games. A year later, his senior year, WSU won seven of eight games and five were shutouts. The Cougars allowed just 18 points in 1907.During his collegiate career and before graduating in 1908, Goldsworthy served as president of the associated students (1907-08), was president of his Sigma Nu fraternity, editor-in-chief of the Chinook yearbook and a member of college debate and glee clubs. He graduated a member of the Phi Kappa Phi honor society prior to receiving his degree in vocational agriculture. Following graduation from WSU, Goldsworthy had short stints as a teacher and coach at Davenport High and Eastern Washington University (then Cheney State Normal), then managed a large corporate farm in Alberta for three years. He then returned home to operate the family farm near Rosalia. WSU continued to be a very important part of his life. A strong advocate for the university during his Washington Legislature tenure, 1923-31, Goldsworthy was a member of the WSU Board of Regents, 1942-47, and served one stint as president, 1944-45. In 1961 the university honored Harry Goldsworthy by naming a student residence Goldsworthy Hall. He died in the spring of 1970 at age 86.\n\nCAROL GORDON (2004)\n\nA long-time leader nationally in women's athletics, Dr. Carol Gordon served as chair of the WSU Department of Physical Education for Women from 1962 until retiring in 1983. She also coached Cougar field hockey and tennis teams from her arrival until 1966. Gordon taught psychology of sport classes in addition to her coaching and administrative duties at WSU. She served as president of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIWA) in 1973-74, and was a member of the AIWA/NCAA Joint Committee and the NCAA Long Range Planning Committee. She has been honored as the recipient of the WSU Faculty Women of the Year Award and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Association of Collegiate Women Athletic Administrators. A native of Goffstown, N.H., Gordon attended Goffstown High and then Oberlin College in Ohio. She coached and taught at the University of New Hampshire and the University of Utah before joining the WSU faculty in 1962.\n\nJENNIFER GRAY (2012)\n\nA native of Puyallup, Wash., Jennifer Gray earned four varsity letters with Cougars and still stands as one of the greatest rebounders in school history. Her 22 rebounds against Western Washington and Boise State, both in 1975, still stand at the top of the WSU single-game leader chart, as she holds the single-season rebounding records with 294 rebounds and 14.7 rebounds per game during her senior season. She holds the school record with a career mark of 9.6 rebounds per game and ranks 22nd in the WSU career record books with 822 points and eighth with a .480 field goal percentage, which at the time was a school record. She also ranks sixth with a career average of 13.3 points per game, also a school record at the time. During her freshman season, the Cougars went on to compete in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) Championships, the first national basketball championship held for women. As both a junior and senior, Gray led her Cougar teams to second place in the NCWSA, notching a 9-2 mark in 1973-74 and a 10-4 league mark in 1974-75.\n\nKATIE GRAY (2012)\n\nOne of Washington State's best all-around athletes of the 1970s, Katie Gray earned four letters in basketball, excelled in track as a jumper and played volleyball and tennis. Gray finished her career with 207 steals, then the second-best mark in school history, while it now ranks tied for fifth. She scored 587 points, averaging 7.6 per game, while grabbing 2.7 steals per game over her four-year career with the women's basketball team. As a senior in 1976-77, Gray averaged 9.3 points per game, shooting at a .594 clip (92-for-238). That season she grabbed 86 steals, eighth-best in a single-season by a Cougar. As a senior, she scored in double-figures 10 times, including a career best 21 points against Alaska-Fairbanks. In her first two seasons, the Cougars were a combined 25-10 and placed second in the NCWSA in each of the respective years.\n\nPAT HALEY (2012)\n\nPat Haley never met a sprint distance he didn't like, let alone conquer, even if hurdles were placed in the lanes. Haley, competing during the World War II years, had four WSC track and field coaches in four years. Haley ran the national freshman record time in the 100-yard dash of 9.5 seconds in 1941. He won the Pacific Coast Conference sprint titles at 100 yards, 220 yards, 110 yard hurdles and was a three-time 220 yard low hurdles champion. In spite of his dominating performances in the sprints and hurdles, Haley did not have the opportunity to compete in the NCAA Championships because of suspension of the national collegiate meets during the war years of 1942-44. Haley went on to earn a degree in electrical engineering.\n\nDICK HANLEY (1986)\n\nDick Hanley quarterbacked Washington State to the 1916 Rose Bowl and a 14-0 win over Brown, played in the Rose Bowl the next year for the Mare Island Marines, and later was a very successful Big Ten head coach at Northwestern. During his four years at WSU the Cougars were 22-4-1. The captain of the 1919 WSU team played a major role in the inception of the famous College All-Star Game in Chicago, staging the first game in 1933. Hanley coached at Pendleton (Oregon) High for two years, then became head coach at Haskell Indian Institute for four years, 1922-26. From there he moved to Northwestern, where he turned the Wildcat program around and won two league titles. He was head coach or assistant coach in 11 East-West Shrine Games. He had a 74-33-8 record at Northwestern and Haskell and a 112-38-8 career mark, including a stint coaching the U.S. Marines at El Toro.

He was accorded Helms' Foundation All-America recognition and earned All-PCC honor in 1945. During his career he set single season records for points and field goals and career marks for field goals (460) and points (1153). His collegiate career also included two varsity letters in baseball as a first baseman and two in track, where he was a high jumper. Hanson coached at North Kitsap High for a year after graduating from WSU in 1948, then played with the Goodyear Wingfoots out of Akron, Ohio, in the old AAU league. He returned to the Northwest in 1950 and worked with Goodyear for several years before entering the insurance business. Born in Austin, Minnesota, Hanson attended Lincoln High in Tacoma.\n\nMARV HARSHMAN (1986)\n\nThree colleges, including Washington State, were the benefactors of long coaching stints by Marv Harshman. The Pacific Lutheran graduate started his career at his alma mater, moved to WSU after 13 years and then on to Washington to finish his 40-year coaching career after 13 seasons as head coach for the Cougar basketball program. He retired in 1985, the winningest active NCAA Division I coach, with a 642-488 career record. Harshman was at PLU, 1946-58, before taking over the Cougar program from the legendary Jack Friel. He guided the Cougars to three Pacific-I Conference runnerup finishes in the days when only the championship club moved on to the NCAA playoffs. He finished at WSU fourth on the school's career win list, 155-181. Harshman then went cross-state to complete a 14-year stint as Washington's head coach. He guided the Huskies to five tournament appearances, two Pac-10 titles, and in 1984 was the NCAA Division I Coach-of-the-Year. Harshman graduated from PLU in 1942. Born in Eau Clair, Wisconsin, Harshman attended Lake Stevens (Wash.) High.\n\nDICK HANNULA (2006)\n\nMany WSU graduates have gone on to enjoy outstanding coaching careers, but it is doubtful any could match the coaching success of Dick Hannula, a 1951 graduate in business. To say Hannula's teams dominated swimming would be an understatement. He began his coaching career at Tacoma's Lincoln High in 1951, winning State titles in 1953 and 1955. In 1958 he moved to the newly constructed Wilson High and from 1960 until his coaching retirement in 1983, teams lined up to see who could finish second to Wilson. The Rams ran off 24 straight State championships and \"The Streak\" was the longest in the history of the National Federation of State High School Association. Wilson teams won 323 consecutive victories in dual, relay, regional and state meets. He has received the WSU Alumni Achievement Award, is a member of the NISCA and International Swimming Halls of Fame and has received just about every national award presented in his sport. Hannula, who resides in Tacoma, also has been manager of two USA Olympic teams and several other national teams.\n\nJANET HARMAN (2006)\n\nTwo-sport athlete Janet Harman graduated from WSU in 1952 with a degree in physical education, then combined a brilliant sports career with teaching. As a Cougar she competed in field hockey, but bowling, was where she really excelled. She was a member of WSU's first women's bowling team, undoubtedly the team anchor. She was a polished bowler when she arrived at WSU, spending much of her childhood in her father's bowling center in Walla Walla. At age 15 Harman set the all-time women's league record in Walla Walla. Later she bowled a WIBC record 792 series. A member of Chi Omega sorority at WSU, she served as vice-president of the WRA and was a member of the ICC. Harman was inducted into the prestigious women's International Bowling Congress Hall of Fame in 1985 and is a member of several other halls of fame. During her career she won numerous bowling titles, set several records, was Southern California Bowler of the year in 1962 and 1964 and was named Oregon Female Athlete of the Year in 1956. Harman died at age 61 while living in California.\n\nJUD HEATHCOTE (1990)\n\nWhen Jud Heathcote guided the 1979 Michigan State Spartan basketball team to the NCAA championship, few people associated with the Cougars were surprised with his success as a coach. First, Heathcote's Spartan squad dismantled a very good Cougar team at the Far West Classic on their way to the NCAA title, and second, the Washington State graduate of 1950 proved his coaching credentials as a seven-year assistant for then WSU head coach Marv Harshman. Heathcote lettered two years under his Cougar mentor, Jack Friel while pursuing his degree in physical education. In his senior year, the Cougars finished 21-9. A North Dakota native and 1945 graduate of South Kitsap High, he spent 14 seasons at West Valley High in Spokane before joining Harshman at WSU. His West Valley teams won or shared five Greater Spokane League titles. He spent five of his seven years with Harshman as Cougar freshman coach, posting a 99-9 mark. Heathcote took over the basketball program at Montana in 1971 and in five seasons coached the Grizzlies into the NCAA regionals. His 1975 club won the Big Sky title, finished 21-8, and came within three points of upsetting eventual NCAA champion UCLA in the regional title game. The next year, 1976, found Heathcote at Michigan State, and there he still resides, stalking the Preslin Students Events Center while coaching MSU basketball teams. His victory over Ohio State last year made him the winningest hoop coach in MSU history. The former USA assistant coach in the 1975 Pan Am Games also coached the Spartans to a school record 28-6 mark in 1990, with MSU winning the Big 10 title and advancing to the NCAA tourney's Sweet 16 round.\n\nMEL HEIN (1979)\n\nConsensus pick as the greatest center in football.

On the gridiron he was a starter at fullback and at guard. On the mat, he captured the 191-pound Pacific Coast Conference wrestling title as both a junior and a senior. He was voted WSC Athlete of the Year for 1956. Hitchcock served as head wrestling coach and assistant football coach at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo for 23 years (1962-85), compiling a 355-112-4 wrestling dual meet record.

He and his bride of 54 years, Patricia, reside in San Luis Obispo.\n\nBABE HOLLINGBERY (1978)\n\nHead Football Coach at WSU for 17 seasons between 1926 and 1942, during which he compiled an outstanding win-loss record and developed many of the finest Athletes in the school's history. An outstanding athlete and coach in the San Francisco Bay area for many years, Hollingbery organized the first East-West Shrine football game and served as the West coach for 19 years, compiling an 11-4-4 record in that capacity. He served the classic 45 years as coach and director of coach and Athlete selection. Led WSU to Rose Bowl in 1930. Member of Helms College Football Hall of Fame. Continued interest in and service to WSU athletics until his death in Yakima in 1974.\n\nALBERT \"PETE\" HOOPER (1984)\n\nFrom 1937-39, WSU's basketball teams posted a 66-29 record, due largely to the efforts of Albert \"Pete\" Hooper. He scored 605 career points, third best total in the decade of the 30's at WSU, and at the time was sixth on WSU's career list. WSU was 24-8 his sophomore year of 1937, losing to Stanford in the PCC playoffs. The next season he was an All-Conference pick, and capped his career in 1939 by helping WSU to a 23-10 record and earning All-Northern Division honors while leading the club in scoring. Also a baseball Athlete, he hit .351 in 1939 to lead the team and finished with a .294 career average. He also coached the freshman basketball team in 1940 and '41 after completing his eligibility.

He doubled the organization's membership and tripled funding in four years, then became Nagel's successor in July of 1976. Jankovich left an indelible mark on Cougar Athletics, undertaking the monumental project to push the Martin Stadium capacity from 27,500 to 40,000. His forward looking facility improvements, including the lowering of the stadium floor 14 feet and the reworking of WSU's football schedule, allowed the Cougars to play key games in Pullman and impacted future football successes for many years. The Butte, Mont., native and University of Montana graduate championed the creation of the WSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1978, pushed for other facility improvements and expanded staff areas focusing on student support. In 1984 Jankovich was named athletic director at Miami (FL) and in 1991 he became general manager of the New England Patriots. He now resides in Hayden Lake, Idaho.\n\nELDON JENNE (1978)\n\nWashington State University's first Olympic Games representative. Jenne made the U.S. team in the pole vault in 1920 and participated in the Games at Antwerp, Belgium, after completing his junior year at the university. He won Pacific Coast pole vault titles in 1919, 1920 and 1921, earned four Varsity letters in track at WSU and also participated in baseball. A native of Coupeville, he entered WSU from Mount Vernon High School. Had a distinguished career as teacher, coach and administrator in athletic and recreation programs in the state of Oregon. Retired in San Diego, Calif.\n\nBRIAN KELLY (1989)\n\nFew people realized when Brian Robert Kelly graduated from WSU in 1978 his best football days were ahead, that he would become one of the great receivers in Canadian Football League history. When he finished his career at WSU following the 1977 season, the 5-9 Arcadia (Calif.) native ranked fourth on the all-time reception list with 116 catches and third in yardage with 1,792 yards. He wore number 44, caught 44 passes as a junior and scored 44 points, then caught 44 again as a senior. Kelly won the J. Fred Bohler Award for inspiration as a senior, and is best remembered for a pair of touchdown catches at Nebraska in WSU's 1977 upset. Following his WSU career, Kelly signed on as a free agent with Edmonton of the CFL. He didn't play in 1978 because of an ankle injury, but Edmonton coach and WSU graduate Hugh Campbell signed him to anther contract. In the next nine years, before his retirement in 1987, Kelly rewrote the team and CFL record book. He caught 575 career passes for 11,169 yards and 97 touchdowns. He set CFL records for reception yardage and touchdown receptions and also established, among others, these CFL records: touchdown receptions in 71 games, six 1000-yard seasons and 41 100-yard games. Kelly continues to live in Edmonton, where he owns a Hyundia dealership.\n\nBOB KENNEDY (1988)\n\nRobert Kennedy, who rewrote just about every rushing record listed in the WSU record book during his career in the early 1940's, has the distinction of having played in two East-West Shrine Games. Kennedy completed his illustrious career as a Cougar fullback by playing in the 1943 East-West Shrine game, then came back two years later to make a repeat performance representing March Field Air Force Base. The Sandpoint (Idaho) High graduate started at WSU in 1939 and during his three varsity seasons rushed for 1217 yards on 343 carries, scored 18 touchdowns, including 15 by rushing, and scored 111 points, all Cougar career marks.

Kennedy's single season records included 813 yards rushing, 11 touchdowns and 69 points. His 171 yards rushing against Montana, including an 81-yarder, were single game marks. After World War II, Kennedy played professional football with the New York Yankees of the American Football Conference from 1946 through 1950. He is now semi-retired in Scottsdale, Arizona after a successful land developing career.\n\nKERI KILLEBREW (2009)\n\nTo say Keri Killebrew was a trend setter at Washington State may indeed be an understatement. Her list of accomplishments reads like \"Who's Who of College volleyball,\" which she was. After transferring from Weber State and sitting out the 1989 season, she burst onto the Cougar scene and over the next three years set numerous WSU match, season and career records. During her junior season, she led the Cougars to their first-ever NCAA Championship tournament appearance while ranking seventh nationally in assists. Her finale came as a senior in 1992 when she became WSU's first player to receive All-America status. She again led WSU into postseason, where the Cougars captured the National Invitational Volleyball Championship while becoming the first school in tournament history to sweep through the tournament without losing a game - victorious in 18 straight games. The NIVC Championship MVP winner concluded her career with 5,848 assists, the eighth-best mark in NCAA D-I history. Her three-year WSU total was a school record 4,553 assists. Killebrew coached in the college ranks for several years, then moved into the real estate business in Milwaukee, Wis.\n\nPETER KOECH (2009)\n\nThe Long Crimson Line includes some of the world's greatest distance runners of all time, including world record holder Peter Koech, who was one of the dominant collegians of his era before graduating from WSU in 1986 with a social science degree. When he concluded his career, Koech had earned 11 All-America certificates, captured five Pacific-10 Conference crowns and two NCAA Championships. His conference titles include three wins at 10,000 meters, one at 5,000m and a fifth at 1,500m which came in 1985 and was a rare feat as he doubled with a win in the 10,000m at the same meet. In 1984 he won his first NCAA title, a 3,000m victory, and then in 1985 he concluded his Cougar career by winning the NCAA steeplechase, a relatively new event for the talented Kenyan runner. In 1988 Koech captured the Silver Medal in the steeplechase at the Seoul Olympic Games, only to come back a year later to establish the event's World Record in a time of 8:05.35, bettering the second oldest track record in the record book and taking the steeple title away from Cougar great Henry Rono. Koech and his family now live in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nJULIUS KORIR (2004)\n\nOne of WSU's most honored distance runners, Julius Korir captured the 1984 Olympic Gold Medal in the steeplechase and went on to become one of the greatest distance runners in Cougar history. Korir first stepped foot on the WSU campus in the winter of 1983 and immediately made a statement, capturing the Pacific-10 Conference steeple title as a freshman and was runner-up at the NCAA meet in the steeple and fifth over 5,000 meters. In the spring of 1984 Korir won every steeple race he entered until the final of the NCAA meet, where he finished second. He had even greater success that season in the 5,000m, winning every collegiate race, including the Pac-10 and NCAA titles. Later in the summer, at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Korir blitzed the steeple field in taking home Kenya's only Gold Medal. His winning time in the final ranked him second on the WSU, Pac-10 and collegiate list behind former Cougar and countryman Henry Rono. Korir attended Kaptumo Secondary School in Kapsabet, Kenya.\n\nBERNARD (Kip) LAGAT (2009)\n\nTo say Bernard (Kip) Lagat dominated Pacific-10 Conference middle distance running in the mid-1990's would be a huge understatement. From 1997-1999 he won 11 races against Pac-10 and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation competition, including a historic three titles over 800m, the mile and 3,000m at the 1999 MPSF meet. He won that meet's MVP honors three times and the Pac-10 outdoor meet MVP title once. At the NCAA level, Lagat earned 11 NCAA All-America certificates and was MVP of the 1999 indoor championships with wins in the mile and 3,000m. Also included in his resume are four NCAA titles, including a World Record in 1989 indoor meet as a member of the distance medley relay team. Lagat's success continues today with his ranking as one of the world's best. He has Silver and Bronze Olympic Games Medals to his credit and four World titles, including a historic 1,500m-5,000m double at the 2007 World Championships. The 2000 WSU graduate with a two degrees (Management Information Systems and Decision Science/Econometrics), became an American citizen in 2004 and now makes Tucson, Arizona, his home, when not on the international track circuit or setting American records (two so far).\n\nLAURA LAVINE (2006)\n\nLaura Lavine left Issaquah High School as a two-time state discus champion (1983 and 1984) and her best toss (154-1) still ranks in the top 25 in the state of Washington. As a Cougar, Lavine placed fifth in the discus at the 1986 NCAA Championships, earning her first of three All-America honors. In 1987, she won the first of two Pac-10 discus titles and became WSU's first woman NCAA Outdoor Track & Field champion. Lavine proved her first national title wasn't a fluke by repeating as the NCAA discus champion the following year, clinching the title with her clutch final throw of the 1988 competition. Lavine's lifetime-best discus throw of 189-feet, 8 inches, tossed June 11, 1988, in Tucson, Ariz., still stands as the school record. After earning four letters as a discus and shot put thrower, Lavine continued competing, placing seventh in the discus at the 1988 US Olympic Trials and competing at the 1992 Olympic Trials. In 1996, Lavine was selected WSU's Woman Athlete of the Decade as part of the Pac-10's celebration of 10 years of women's athletics. She resides in Chandler, Ariz., where she works as a retail manager.\n\nMIKE LEVENSELLER (1993)\n\nFew records stand the test of time and those that do and those who set them are to be cherished. Such is the case with Washington State University's Mike Levenseller. Currently an assistant coach with the Cougars, Levenseller set records during his playing days that still stand 17 years later. Recruited to WSU out of Tacoma's Curtis High in 1974, Levenseller rocketed into prominence in 1976 when he caught 67 passes for 1,124 yards. A year later with 43 receptions he pushed his career total to 121 passes caught for 2,061 yards and 10 touchdowns. No receiver in Cougar history has ever caught more passes in a single season than the 6-1 native of Bremerton. In addition, his reception yardage of 1,124 yards still ranks as the most ever by any receiver to play in the Pacific-10 Conference (not including bowl games). Levenseller becomes the third member of the Cougars' vaunted pitch and catch combo of the mid-1970's to be inducted into the hall of fame. The quarterback in those record-setting days was Jack Thompson (1987 inductee) and his chief targets were Levenseller and Brian Kelly (1989 inductee). Selected to several All-America, All-West Coast and All-Pac-8 Conference teams following the 1976 and 1977 seasons, Levenseller went on to play in the 1978 Challenge Bowl and Hula Bowl all-star games. Drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the sixth round of the 1978 National Football League draft, Levenseller spent eight years as a Athlete in the NFL and Canadian Football League, then turned to coaching. During his CFL coaching tenure, Levenseller tutored receivers for the British Columbia Lions and Toronto Argonauts, including two years with the latter when he coached Raghib \"The Rocket\" Ismail. In 1992 Levenseller returned to his alma mater as wide receiver coach.\n\nKEITH LINCOLN (1979)\n\nKeith Lincoln - the old \"Moose of the Palouse\" - may be remembered best by football fans across the nation as the Golden Boy of the San Diego Chargers in the early 1960's, but Cougar fans never will forget the great triple-threat back of the 1958-60 seasons at WSU. Lincoln ran, passed and kicked for Coach Jim Sutherland's Cougars. He set a school career rushing record (1,501 yards); a single season punting average record (43.4), and a career punting average record (40.3), and was an All-West Coast selection at halfback in 1959. He was the Most Valuable Athlete in the American Football League championship game in 1963 and MVP of the AFL All-Star game following the '63 season.\n\nPAUL LINDEMANN (1980)\n\nAs a 6-7 center for the Cougars, Paul Lindemann won All-America honors on the WSU team that won the Northern Division, Pacific Coast and Western Regional NCAA titles and finished second in the NCAA finals under coach Jack Friel in 1941. He was the second-leading scorer for WSU in the decade of the 30s with 668 points. Lindemann also earned All-Coast and All-Northern Division honors during the '41 season. He joined Phillips Petroleum after leaving WSU and played on four national championship teams with the AAU 66'ers. He was an AAU All-America pick in 1945. His teams were 176-25 those five years.

While a student at John Rogers High School in Spokane, Lindgren set 11 prep distance marks and won a spot on the 1964 U.S. Olympic team for the Games at Tokyo. He was the first American to beat the Russians in a distance race, accomplishing this feat at Los Angeles in 1964 in the U.S./Russia dual meet in the 10,000 meters.\n\nDUBI LUFI (1989)\n\nDubi Lufi can, without question, be called the greatest gymnast to ever compete for WSU. The native of Israel completed his WSU education in three years and one semester, earned Phi Beta Kappa honors with a 3.5 grade point average and earned All-America status as a junior and senior. He is the Cougars' only All-American in gymnastics and throughout his WSU career he was entirely self-supporting. Lufi earned his bachelor's degree from WSU in 1975, a Master's from Idaho a year later and his PhD from WSU in 1978. As a senior, Lufi was WSU's conference medal winner as the top scholar-athlete. In the fall of 1983 Lufi had to return home for the Six-Day War. He returned in February after traveling 30 hours, registered and competed against Washington, leading WSU to its first win over the Huskies in 10 years. Lufi was a member of Israel's Olympic team in 1980 and 1984, six times competed in the World Games, won all-around national titles in 1968-69-70-71-81, and in 1984 retired as the oldest (35) competing gymnast in international competition.

He also serves as clinical psychologist at a regional mental health center and specializes in work with adolescents and family problems.\n\nDAN LYNCH (2006)\n\nA four-year letter winner at Washington State, Dan Lynch quickly moved up the Cougar ranks. As a redshirt junior, Lynch started all 11 games for the Cougars and helped to anchor an offensive line that boosted WSU to second in rushing among Pac-10 teams. In his final season, Lynch was a unanimous selection to the All-Pac-10 first team for two consecutive seasons and the unanimous recipient of the Pac-10 Morris Trophy winner for his work as an offensive lineman. Lynch earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from WSU and was named the Outstanding Senior of the Year in 1984. In the early 1990s, Lynch settled in the Czech Republic and has worked with numerous companies all over Eastern Europe. In 2004, he was awarded the \"Golden Egg Award\" as philanthropist of the year for his work with local Czech charities and children's organizations. Since 2000, Lynch has been with 3TS Capital Partners, a central European private equity fund, where he is currently the managing partner and direct coordinator for investment structuring, negotiations and syndicated transactions.\n\nROBERT McGUIRE (2012)\n\nRobert Charles McGuire was born Dec. 2, 1927. He attended Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Wash. McGuire was a three-time all-conference selection as an outfielder. He was selected to the 1950 NCAA All-District team while leading Washington State to a national runner-up finish. While overall statistics are not available for McGuire's time at Washington State, he batted .304, .377 and .364 for a career average of .353 in conference play.

He also played halfback for the Cougar football team (1947-49) and was inducted into the Tacoma-Pierce Sports Hall of Fame in 1971.\n\nJOE McINTOSH (1987)\n\nFew pitchers ever achieve the success Joe McIntosh enjoyed during a brilliant Cougar career, either on the field, or in the classroom. The Billings, Montana native came out of Billings High in 1969 known as an infielder, but Cougar coach Bobo Brayton saw the makings of a great pitcher his first year on campus and quickly sent him to the mound. In the next three years McIntosh established nine career records and six Pacific-8 Conference marks, plus a host of other records. In addition, the pre-med major was picked to the CoSIDA Academic All-America first team three straight years. He received his Master of Law (L.L.M.) degree in tax from New York University in 1981 and is now a lawyer in Seattle. The 6-2 right hander won all 10 games as a sophomore in 1971, winning the first of three straight Buck Bailey Awards as WSU's top pitcher. He posted a 10-5 mark in 1972, then finished off his career with a 13-3 mark in 1973. He tossed back to back no-hitters that season six days apart, beating Whitworth 8-0 and then Puget Sound 6-0. McIntosh was a member of the USA team that competed in the World Amateur Tournament in the fall of 1972, striking out 21 in 21.1 innings. He shut out Germany, Brazil and El Salvador for a 3-0 mark. Drafted in the 13th round by San Diego, McIntosh's pro career was cut short by an arm injury after being traded to Houston in 1975.\n\nED McKINNON (1978)\n\nRanked by Coach Ike Deeter as the finest WSU boxer in the 40 years Deeter was associated with the Cougar program. McKinnon was the National 155-pound champion in 1937 and was Pacific Coast middleweight titlist in both 1935 and 1937. Won the Far Western Diamond Belt Championship at Portland, Ore., in 1935 and 1936, was Pacific Coast AAU middleweight champion in 1936 and won the Post Intelligencer (Seattle) Golden Gloves title two years.

High.\n\nFRANK MATAYA (1989)\n\nTo call Frank Mataya versatile during his WSU career is an understatement. From his enrollment in 1946 until graduation in 1951 with a physical education degree, the Roslyn native earned 12 varsity letters in four sports. Mataya was a left-handed quarterback and defensive specialist on the gridiron for coach Phil Sarboe. He played basketball for coach Jack Friel for three years, 1949-50-51. During the spring each year, Mataya was a mainstay for Jack Mooberry's track team, competing in the shot put (he was the state high school record holder), discus and javelin. He captured third in the discus at the Northern Division Championships one year, won the shot put title as a sophomore and a year later took fifth at the Pacific Coast Conference meet.

In 1985 he retired from teaching and coaching duties.\n\nRUEBEN MAYES (1993)\n\nRueben Mayes was once described by his Washington State University football coach as a \"playful colt.\" Perhaps Jim Walden knew then, in 1982, that Mayes would soon be considered a stallion among collegiate running backs. By the end of his distinguished four-year Cougar career Mayes held numerous WSU rushing records and several Pacific-10 Conference and NCAA marks. Twice Mayes was honored by the Pac-10 coaches as the conference's outstanding offensive Athlete. As a junior he came out of nowhere to finish tenth in the Heisman Trophy balloting. Mayes burst onto the national scene in 1984. In back-to-back games he rushed for 216 yards at Stanford and then an NCAA, Pac-10 and WSU record 357 yards at Oregon. His two-game total of 573 yards also set NCAA, Pac-10 and WSU records. The Stanford game is one of the most memorable in Cougar history. Mayes scored a school-record five times in aiding a WSU comeback that had the Cougars down 28 points, 42-14, late in the third quarter. WSU won 49-42. Mayes earned numerous All-America honors his final two seasons at WSU and in the process set more than a dozen records, including 3,519 rushing yards, 23 career touchdowns rushing and 26 in all, 13 games with more than 100 yards rushing, and 4,418 all-purpose yards.

The peak came in 1937 when, coached by legendary Cougar Ike Deeter, WSC captured the NCAA Championship. Nine years later, Jack Melson entered WSC and etched his name alongside the great of Cougar boxing. A Seattle native who attended Seattle Prep, Melson immediately made an impact on the program as he captured the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate title at 130 pounds as a freshman in 1947. The next year he repeated as the PCI champion, only this time it came in the 127-pound division, followed by another title in 1949 at 125 pounds. Melson capped his Cougar career with a fourth-straight title in 1951, the only boxer in Cougar history with four PCI championships.
