        "text": "Nick Price (born January 28, 1957, Durban, South Africa) is a South African-born golfer who was one of the sport’s leading players in the early 1990s.\n\nPrice’s family moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he began playing golf at age eight. At age 17 he traveled to the United States and won the Junior World tournament in San Diego, California. Price spent the next year (1975) playing on the South African and European tours as an amateur. He served two years in the Rhodesian air force as a pilot and then rejoined the European Tour as a professional in 1977.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nHe joined the Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA) Tour full-time in 1983 and showed great promise, winning the World Series of Golf that year by four strokes over Jack Nicklaus. In the years that followed, Price was hailed by his peers as one of the best, and most likable, golfers on the tour. After winning the World Series, however, he did not capture another PGA Tour event for eight years.\n\nIn 1982 Price narrowly missed winning the Open Championship (British Open). He held a three-stroke lead with six holes left to play, but then he faltered, and Tom Watson beat him by one stroke. Finally, in 1991, Price won two PGA events, the Byron Nelson Classic and the Canadian Open. The following year he finished first at the PGA Championship, which began an incredible 24-month run in which he won 16 times and finished in the top 10 in 37 of 59 tournaments. The 15th win came in July 1994 at the Open Championship, where Price avenged his 1982 heartbreak by sinking a spectacular 18-metre (60-foot) putt for an eagle on the second-to-last hole, a shot that clinched his victory. Then, in August at the PGA Championship, he shot an 11-under-par 269 to win and become the seventh golfer to capture back-to-back majors. Less than a month later he won the Bell Canadian Open."
