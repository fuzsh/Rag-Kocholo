        "text": "Zac Brown’s announcement that he and his soon-to-be ex-wife Kelly Yazdi were divorcing just four months after their August 31 wedding was sad to hear about. However, in the entertainment industry, divorce is very common.\n\nLong-lasting marriages in country music like Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, and Dolly Parton and her husband of over fifty years Carl Dean are wonderful but rare in the music industry.\n\nGossip site TMZ recently revealed the news of Brown’s pending divorce, and the couple stated to TMZ, “We are in the process of divorce. Our mutual respect for one another remains. We wish each other the best and will always appreciate our time together. As we navigate this personal matter, we simply request privacy during this time.”\n\nYazdi, a model/actress, recently disappeared from Instagram, and when she returned to the social media platform, she took Brown’s name off her bio and stopped following Zac on Instagram. She even took down every single post and photo that included him.\n\nIt wasn’t until November of 2023 that the couple confirmed their marriage. This was Brown’s second marriage. He was previously married to Shelly Brown for 12 years until 2018, and the couple share five kids. Zac and Kelly have no children together.\n\nCountry music’s most recent short-lived marriage before Zac’s was the union between country stars Carly Pearce and Michael Ray. Her album 29: Written In Stone addressed the divorce, and she told us in early 2023 that she was excited to share the next chapter of her music.\n\nPearce said, “Obviously, I learned a lot sonically about where I want to continue to push myself into the rootsier side of my music. But I think more importantly, I just learned that fans they just wanna hear what I’m going through and what my perspective is, and how I see the world in that period of time in my life. And so, I’m thankful that I don’t have to write about a divorce anymore.”\n\nShe added, “This phase of my life, while it is very exciting and fulfilling and fun and upbeat, there are still struggles that come with that, and I think I’m just really excited. I feel like, in a lot of ways, I’ve become a little bit more private with my personal life, to the point that maybe people don’t even know what this music is gonna be like, and that’s fun for me. I like the mysterious side of that.”"
