        "text": "Golf champion. Born in Aberdeen and raised in Kemnay, he was educated at Kemnay Academy and began playing golf in his youth. Lawrie came to public attention in 1999 when he spectacularly won the Open Championship at Carnoustie, coming from ten shots behind. He had won the Qatar Masters earlier in the year and went on to win the Dunhill Links Championship in St. Andrews in 2001. Thereafter followed several years of disappointment, but his form returned and he won the Qatar Masters for a second time in 2012. Later the same year he won the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles and significantly contributed to Europe's win in the Ryder Cup in the USA. He served as a Vice-Captain for the European Ryder Cup team in 2016.\n\nLawrie runs his own Golf Academy at Ardoe (Aberdeenshire), and helps develop young golfers through the Paul Lawrie Foundation, which he founded in 2001."
