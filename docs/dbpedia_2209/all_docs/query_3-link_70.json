        "text": "Due to issues with entry via PLF Website, to enter please email info@paullawriefoundation.co.uk\n\nNo handicap is necessary for FLAG competitions. Paul Lawrie Foundation FLAG competitions are designed to introduce juniors aged 12 and under (under 12 at 1st Jan 2024 & under 10 on 1st Jan 2024 to be eligible for the U10s section) to competitive, fun golf played over shortened courses (holes typically between 100yds-250yds long). Normally we’ll play over 9 holes. Competitors have 36 shots to get as far around the lay-out as possible. A flag colour-coded to their age-group and section is placed in the ground where the 36th stroke comes to rest.\n\nChildren must be accompanied by an adult/responsible person to assist with safety. No prior knowledge of golf or the rules is necessary for either the child or accompanying adult. In most circumstances, children will have to handle their own equipment (no caddies!) though, for example, if it’s very wet/cold it is acceptable for some assistance in keeping clubs as dry as possible and children warm/dry.\n\nModified rules of golf are used, based upon R&A/USGA Rules of Golf, allowing kids to navigate their way around the courses we play.\n\nbunkers – after three failed attempts to escape from a bunker a competitor may throw their ball out of the bunker (but only the three failed strokes will count)\n\nmaximum strokes per hole – not more than 10 strokes may be taken at any hole, including a maximum of 4 putts on any green. If a competitor reaches the maximum number of shots (or putts) for that hole, they progress to the next hole and continue to play until they reach their 36 shots\n\nwater/penalty area – if the ball is in water and the competitor decides to take a penalty drop out of the area, they may do so by dropping nearer the hole to prevent having to play over/across the penalty area again\n\nball unplayable – in addition to the normal options available, players may take relief by dropping from the unplayable spot on to an area of shorter grass (even though this may mean dropping more than the normally permitted dropping area)\n\nRESULTS\n\nBoys Under 10’s\n\n1st – Luke Duncan\n\n2nd – Calum Innes\n\n3rd – Lyall MacMillan\n\nBoys Under 12’s\n\n1st – Jack Strachan\n\n2nd – Charlie Largue\n\n3rd – Michael Miller\n\nDRAW/TEE TIMES – SUNDAY 12th MAY – PLGC\n\n1.30 – Harrison Baird, Jack Strachan\n\n1.40 – Oliver Wilkinson, Luke Duncan, Robbie Buchanan\n\n1.50 – Harper Lamont, Charlie Largue, Jamie McCarry, Gerven McHardy\n\n2.00 – Michael Miller, Matthew Petrie, Lyall MacMillan, Daniel Thomson\n\n2.10 – Graeme Innes, Calum Innes, Dylan Plant, Theo Plant"
