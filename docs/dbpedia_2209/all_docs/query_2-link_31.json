Children completed a questionnaire that assessed supplement use, food choices, diet-related attitudes, and physical activity; height and weight were measured.\n\nSetting\n\nSchool classrooms.\n\nParticipants\n\nRepresentative sample of fourth-grade students in Texas (n = 5967; mean age = 9.7 years standard error of the mean [SEM] = .03 years, 46% Hispanic, 11% African-American).\n\nMain Outcome Measures\n\nPrevious day vitamin supplement consumption, diet- and body size-related attitudes, food choices, demographic factors, and physical activity.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMultivariable logistic regression models, P < .05.\n\nResults\n\nThe prevalence of supplement use was 29%. Supplement intake was associated with physical activity. Girls who used supplements were more likely to report positive body image and greater interest in trying new food. Relative to nonusers, supplement users were less likely to perceive that they always ate healthful food, although supplement use was associated with more healthful food choices in boys and girls (P < .001).\n\nConclusions and Implications\n\nThe widespread use of supplements and clustering of supplement use with healthful diet and greater physical activity in fourth graders suggest that supplement use be closely investigated in studies of diet–disease precursor relations and lifestyle factors in children.\n\nKeywords: vitamin supplement use, elementary schoolchild, food choices, diet-related attitudes, multiethnic, probability-based sample, physical activity\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDietary behavior during childhood impacts optimal growth and development and influences age-associated risk of chronic diseases/conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, and obesity.1,2 Dietary patterns of children can include food choices, breakfast and meal patterns, school meal participation,1 dieting,3 and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements.4\n\nPrevious research indicates that vitamin supplement use is associated with healthful food choices among infants/toddlers,5,6 preschoolers,7 early elementary school-aged children,8 and adolescents.9–11 However, to the authors’ knowledge, no information exists on the relation between vitamin supplement use and food choices in population-based samples of older elementary schoolchildren in the United States, especially those populations with significant Latino and African-American representation.\n\nSince vitamin supplements are purchased and offered to elementary schoolchildren by their parents, consumption of vitamin supplements by children can be viewed as part of the dietary and/or health environment for that child. Prior research has shown that vitamin supplement use in adults is associated with better food intake, increased physical activity, and better body image and dietary habits,4,12 but it is not known if this association is seen in elementary schoolchildren as well.\n\nThe purpose of the current study was to examine diet- and body size-related attitudes and behaviors associated with vitamin supplement use in a representative sample of fourth-grade elementary schoolchildren in Texas. With this research it can be determined if vitamin supplement use is associated with other environmental and intrapersonal factors, or if supplement use can be viewed as a separate construct. The conceptual framework for this article examines constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior13 and the Social Ecological Model,14 such as intrapersonal behavioral (diet, physical activity), attitudinal (body image satisfaction, perceived healthfulness of diet, interest in trying new food), and sociodemographic (gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, overweight status) factors related to vitamin supplement use in children. We acknowledge that parental/environmental variables (role modeling of behaviors considered to be healthful, gate keeping regarding purchasing and offering vitamins to children, menu planning and shopping practices determining availability of healthful food, norms for taking vitamins) may also constitute important determinants of elementary schoolchildren’s vitamin supplement use, diet-related attitudes, and food choices, as posited by the Social Ecological model.14 However, in this study, the authors focused on selected intrapersonal factors that may be related to vitamin supplement use in elementary schoolchildren.\n\nMETHODS\n\nStudy Design and Data Collection\n\nThe data used were cross-sectional data from the 2000–2002 School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) study, a 3-stage, probability-based sample of Texas schoolchildren.15 The first stage of sampling included the 11 Texas public health regions, with school districts and schools composing stages 2 and 3 of the sampling plan, respectively. The sampling frame consisted of all public schools, excluding charter, special education, and alternative schools, in Texas. Schools were selected from urban center, urban/suburban, and rural school districts from each public health region.16\n\nThe school district classification as rural, suburban, or urban was based on Texas Education Agency designations and population sizes of the surrounding area. Economic disadvantage for schools was defined as the percentage of students eligible for the federal free and reduced-price school lunch program.17 Since most were neighborhood schools, the economically disadvantaged classification for the school was assigned to all children in that school.\n\nSchool administrators were contacted for permission to collect data in schools identified, based on the sampling plan. All fourth graders in sampled schools were given the opportunity to participate in the study. During the classroom measurement session, an overview of the study and protocol-related instructions were provided to students. Research staff measured heights and weights of students. Administering the survey and measuring heights and weights took 45–60 minutes per 50 students.\n\nParticipants\n\nInstitutional Review Boards at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Department of State Health Services, as well as the participating school districts and individual schools, approved study protocols and questionnaires. Active or passive parental consent was obtained from the students depending on school district policy. Children completed assent forms prior to completing the questionnaire.\n\nInstruments and Measures\n\nThe SPAN study questionnaire\n\nThe SPAN questionnaire, based on the School-Based Nutrition Monitoring (SBNM) student questionnaire,18–20 was used to obtain information regarding demographic factors, vitamin and mineral supplement use, physical activity, diet- and body weight-related attitudes, and food choices. Vitamin supplement use, physical activity, television viewing, and food choices were assessed based on previous day information to minimize difficulties faced by young children in recollecting and summarizing data related to extended time periods.19,21\n\nThis instrument has been tested for cognitive understanding among elementary schoolchildren and was determined to be age appropriate.18 The questionnaire was available in English and Spanish; 93 surveys (1.5%) were administered in Spanish. Both English and Spanish versions had pictures to promote recall and recognition of items by children.19 Questionnaire data entry included quality control measures, such as examining for stray marks and perforations, prior to scanning. Missing data and ambiguous responses did not exceed 1%.15\n\nVitamin and mineral supplement use was assessed by questioning participants about previous day vitamin pill consumption. Two-hour test-retest reliability among fourth grade students demonstrated excellent stability for responses to the vitamin question (percentage agreement = 93.6%, κ = 0.87) (19). Focus group testing and cognitive interviews in a separate convenience sample of fourth graders indicated that at this grade level, children think of vitamin/mineral pills also as “vitamin pills.”18 The scope of the term supplement in this paper is vitamin/mineral supplement and does not include other dietary supplements, such as herbal or alternative supplements.\n\nPhysical activity was estimated by querying whether during the previous day the child had engaged in any exercise that made his/her heart beat fast and that made breathing harder for at least 20 minutes (eg, basketball, jogging, swimming, fast bicycling, tennis). Reproducibility coefficients for this question were superior (percentage agreement = 92.3%, κ = 0.71).19 Television (TV) viewing was assessed according to the number of hours the student had watched TV or video movies the previous day (0, 1, 2, 3 or more hours) (percentage agreement = 87.3%, κ = 0.82).19 For purposes of analysis, previous day TV viewing was divided into 2 reported categories: 0–1 hour of TV and 2–3 hours or more.\n\nDiet- and body weight-related attitudes evaluated included self-perceptions of body weight, willingness to try new food, and self-perceptions of healthful diet. The percentage agreement for diet-related attitudes ranged from 72.6% for the “will try new food” question to 80.3% for the “I eat healthfully” question; κ values extended from 0.38 for the “I eat healthfully” question to 0.46 for the “will try new food.”19 The relatively low κ values for these questions may be a result of learning effects during the 2-week interval between repeat administrations of the attitude questions in the reproducibility study.19\n\nThe instrument also measured food choices during the previous day as reported by the student. Twenty marker food items, identified as being in greatest need of surveillance,18,19 were assessed. Marker food items included both healthful (fruit, milk, cheese, beans, vegetables) and un-healthful food items (hamburger meat, hot dogs, sausage [chorizo], candy, soft drinks). The response options for the food choice questions were 0, 1, 2, or ≥ 3 times. A semiquantitative food frequency approach was used in preference to the more labor- and time-intensive,22 albeit potentially more accurate, 24-hour dietary recall method,21 because of the ease of administration and entry of food items for the large sample of over 5000 Texas elementary schoolchildren. Interpretation of the SPAN instrument is appropriate as a method for ranking the food intake of a population,18 examining relations between diet and other variables,19 and discriminating among individuals or subpopulations with regard to higher versus lower intakes. The food items included on the instrument have been identified as contributing significantly to intakes of energy, energy-yielding macronutrients, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in young children.23\n\nReproducibility of the food choice questions was tested in 322 ethnically diverse Texas fourth graders by repeat administrations of the questionnaire 2 hours apart. The range for percentage agreement was 70.3% for fruit to 94.0% for gravy; κ values ranged from 0.51 for bread/bun/bagels to 0.80 for hamburgers/hot dogs/sausage (chorizo).19 Validity of the food items on the SPAN questionnaire was measured against data from a concurrently completed 24-hour recall in 121 fourth-grade students and was found to be adequate (κ values exceeded 0.30 for the majority of questions).20\n\nHealthful marker food items composite score\n\nA healthful marker food items composite score was calculated using reported consumption of healthy food items on the questionnaire. Food categories in the composite score included vegetables, beans, nuts, fruit, fruit juice, milk, yogurt, and cheese. The food categories used in the score computation were consistent with certain food items included in other indices of diet quality24,25 or were purported to have healthful effects.26 The healthful food items composite score calculation reflects the current understanding in nutrition that focus on dietary patterns is preferable to an individual food items approach.27,28 For each food category in the index, students received a score of 0–3 based on consumption frequency the previous day. The range of possible total scores for the index was 0–24. The scoring rationale for the healthful marker food items composite score is consistent with the finding that diet quality and healthful dietary patterns are related to the counts of healthful food items consumed.29\n\nAnthropometrics\n\nTrained research staff measured heights and weights of students. Using a portable stadiometer, staff measured height to the nearest 0.1 cm. Students were requested to remove hair accessories or undo hair styles that would interfere with accurate measurement of height. Weight was assessed to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale (Tanita BWB-800S, Tanita Corporation of America, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) that had been calibrated with standardized weights before the measurement session. Students were weighed in light clothing, and 5% of students in each class were remeasured for quality control purposes. The Pearson correlations between repeat anthropometric measurements exceeded 0.99.15\n\nBody mass index (BMI) was calculated as kg/m2, and students were placed in weight categories based on gender- and age-specific growth charts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.30\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nData were analyzed using STATA (Stata Statistical Software, release 8.2, StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, 2003). All analyses incorporated the SPAN probability weights and complex survey design characteristics to generate statewide representative estimates.\n\nChi-square analyses were used to determine the significance of associations between the use of supplements and demographic and physical activity characteristics, reported as proportions. Independent samples t tests were used to assess differences between supplement users and nonusers for continuous variables, such as BMI.\n\nMultivariable logistic regression models stratified by gender and adjusted for race/ethnicity, district population size (ie, urban, suburban, rural), school socioeconomic status, BMI, and physical activity were used to examine relationships between supplement intakes and diet-related attitudes and food choices. Covariates included in logistic regression models to adjust for potential confounding were selected to be consistent with previous studies on supplement intakes and dietary behavior.4,11,31 Supplement nonusers were the referent category for the logistic regression models. Results of statistical tests were significant at P < .05.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe overall response rate (incorporating rates of student assent and parental passive or active consent) among fourth graders in the 2000–2002 SPAN survey was 76%. For school districts that required active consent, the response rate was based on the proportion of students given the active consent form who returned the forms with signatures of their parents or guardians indicating the parents’ willingness to let their child participate in the study. For school districts that had passive consent, the response rate was based on the proportion of total students who did not return forms signed by parents, declining their child’s participation in the study.\n\nOf the 6235 fourth graders who participated in the SPAN study, 5967 (95.7%) had complete data on vitamin supplement use. Responders and nonresponders to the vitamin supplement question did not differ by gender, BMI, race/ethnicity, district population size, or school socioeconomic status. The results reported herein are based on the 5967 fourth graders (2952 boys and 3015 girls) who had complete data on the vitamin supplement question. The SPAN sample was weighted to represent fourth-grade students in the state of Texas, and all percentages and means reported in subsequent sections of this paper are weighted estimates.\n\nshows supplement use by demographic and physical activity characteristics. Overall, participants (n = 5967) were multiethnic, with a mean age of 9.7 years (standard error of the mean [SEM] = 0.03 years), and 43% were at risk of being overweight or were overweight. The 1-day prevalence of supplement use was 30.7% in boys and 27.2% in girls. Supplement use did not vary by race/ethnicity, BMI, or school socioeconomic characteristics. Compared with nonusers, supplement users were more likely to live in urban or suburban than in rural school districts (P < .05). Also, previous day vitamin supplement consumption was associated with physical activity of more vigorous intensity and reduced TV viewing in the overall sample and in girls.\n\nTable 1\n\nOverall (n = 5967)Boys (n = 2952)Girls (n = 3015)Supplement\n\nNonusersSupplement\n\nUsersP\n\nValueSupplement\n\nNonusersSupplement\n\nUsers\n\n%P\n\nValueSupplement\n\nNonusersSupplement\n\nUsersP\n\nValueRace/ Ethnicitya African-American12.39.2.51412.88.9.15711.79.7.821 Hispanic45.844.646.842.044.847.7 White/Other41.946.240.449.143.542.6District population sizea Urban36.746.1.039*36.749.7.029*36.741.7.344 Suburban51.744.851.641.551.748.8 Rural11.69.211.78.911.69.5Physical activitya Yes81.786.6.040*82.487.2.21281.085.8.045* No18.313.517.612.919.014.2Television viewinga 0–1 Hour yesterday50.958.1.022*48.253.7.29253.763.3.003** 2–3 or more49.141.951.846.346.336.7 Hours yesterdayMeansBody mass indexb20.219.9.46720.520.2.66020.019.7.412% School level SESb58.758.8.98359.360.0.89158.057.3.770\n\nshows adjusted odds ratios for associations between supplement use and diet- and body weight-related attitudes.

In the overall sample, supplement use was associated positively with any intake of rice, pasta, vegetables, beans, fruit juice, milk, or yogurt (P < .01) and negatively with consumption of soft drinks (P < .05). Also, supplement use was associated with a greater likelihood of being in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of the healthful marker food items composite score.

The findings that supplement use was related to greater amounts of physical activity and lower TV viewing in this sample of fourth-grade students are consistent with results observed among adolescents in the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) trial11 and in adults.12,32 At the present time, vitamin supplement use seems to be associated with other behaviors and behavioral constructs widely acknowledged to be related to health, including physical activity.\n\nThe overall 1-day prevalence of supplement use (29%) in Texas fourth graders was similar to the percentage reported for use of supplements in the past 30 days in 9–13 year old children from the 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (28.9%),33 but higher than “usual” vitamin supplement use percentages reported for eighth (mean age = 14.1 years) (20.1%)10 and twelfth (mean age = 18 years) (25%)11 grade adolescents from the CATCH tracking study. Variations in prevalence estimates may be attributed to differences in the ages of the populations studied, time frames for which supplement intakes were assessed, or temporal variations in vitamin intake patterns.\n\nAlthough it appeared that African-American fourth graders in Texas public schools were less likely than other ethnic groups to take supplements, this result was not statistically significant. The null association between supplement intake and race/ethnicity in Texas public school fourth graders in the present study is similar to the null relation between supplement use and race/ethnicity reported in a national sample of infants and toddlers.6 However, researchers have reported ethnic differences in supplement use among adolescents.10,11\n\nThe girls who used supplements had more positive perceptions of body weight than nonusers. Understanding the relationship between body size self-perception and supplement use in children is important because body image dissatisfaction has been shown to be prevalent even among young elementary schoolchildren and may be a precursor to eating disorders and associated with poor eating habits.34,35 Also, girls who used supplements were more likely to report always trying new food. Willingness to try new food has been associated with superior diet quality and greater dietary variety in children.36,37 Girls who used supplements were less likely than those who did not to report that they always ate healthful food. Perceptions of inadequate diets have also been associated with supplement use in adolescent girls38 and women.39\n\nThe authors found, however, that food choices of supplement users were more healthful than those of nonusers. This result is consistent with previous findings across multiple age groups, including toddlers,6 5- to 7-year-olds,8 adolescents,9–11 and adults.4,31 The association of supplement use with healthful food choices is similar to the clustering of behaviors perceived as healthful in other populations.40,41\n\nIn general, vitamin or mineral supplements have been associated with positive health outcomes, especially in suboptimally nourished42 or growth-stunted children43 and in those with human immunodeficiency virus44 or cystic fibrosis.45 However, in some studies, doses of specific vitamin or mineral, or both, supplements have been associated with adverse46 or null47,48 effects on clinical indices and health outcomes. Also, excessive reliance on supplements to meet vitamin and mineral dietary requirements may deny supplement users the benefits of the interactions of nutrients with non-nutrient substances in whole food items.49 Furthermore, children today may receive such additional nutrients as iron, vitamin A, zinc, and folate6,50,51 from the fortification of food51 like cereal, milk and fruit juice.\n\nA study limitation is the single day of vitamin use recall, which may introduce misclassification bias relative to assessment of habitual vitamin supplement intake. However, the focus on previous day intakes was to reduce memory recall effects and cognitive difficulties that young children encounter in aggregating data relating to expansive periods of time.19,21,22\n\nStrengths of this study include the large multiethnic and representative sample of fourth-grade Texas children and the concurrent assessment of vitamin supplement use, physical activity, food choices, and diet-related attitudes. Potential future directions for this research include examining the role of parents in the association of supplement intakes and healthful food choices in elementary schoolchildren and exploring ethnic differences in the relation between supplement use and food choices. Qualitative studies may assess in greater detail the differences in diet-related attitudes between child supplement users and nonusers.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE\n\nA substantial proportion (29%) of students in this multiethnic representative sample of Texas fourth graders reported previous day consumption of a vitamin or mineral supplement. Vitamin or mineral supplement use was associated with more healthful food choices and greater physical activity, suggesting that the use of vitamin or mineral supplements may serve as a marker for healthful lifestyle behaviors, even in elementary school-aged children. Fourth-grade boys and girls with poorer dietary profiles were less likely to report vitamin or mineral supplement consumption. This finding raises the interesting question of whether students who might benefit most from use of a vitamin pill are actually taking these supplements. Further research is needed to validate the need for and long-term effects of widespread supplement use in children, especially in those who are healthy and well nourished. In addition, attention should be focused on elucidating the parental constructs that contribute to vitamin supplement intake, as well as other health-related behaviors in this age group.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was funded primarily by grant #U58/CCU619293-01 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity and National Cancer Institute training grant #2R25CA57712.
