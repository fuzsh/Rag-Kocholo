        "text": "Ronnie McDonald, the professional at Kemnay Golf Club 10 miles from Aberdeen, was, like most of the golfing fraternity in the north-east of Scotland, in a \"state of shock\" following Paul Lawrie's victory in the Open at Carnoustie after a play-off on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm still trying to digest it,\" he said yesterday. \"This is fairytale stuff. It's like the old film Geordie - the skinny boy from Scotland who dreamed of glory and grew up to win the shot putt at the Olympic Games. And just to think, I played 10 holes with him five weeks ago at Kemnay and we finished all square.\"\n\nLawrie was born in Kemnay 30 years ago and was on the course as soon as he could swing a club. He certainly had dreams but for him there was no \"boy wonder\" reputation - not like Sandy Lyle, Ben Hogan, Peter Thomson, Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus and so on. He played off a handicap of four and had no amateur pedigree when he turned professional. But like these greats he has captured golf's biggest prize.\n\nI recall 13 years ago playing a round with the late Doug Smart, the professional at Banchory Golf Club, who took Paul under his wing. After finishing we went to the practice range and there was Lawrie.\n\n\"Believe me,\" said Doug, \"that boy is made of the right stuff to have a great future. I have had boys turn professional with me with far better amateur records but there is something different about him. I have that feeling.\"\n\nOne of the saddest things, as Lawrie emotionally pointed out yesterday, was that Smart did not see his prophecy come true. Six years ago he took his own life after suffering deep depression after giving up his post at Banchory and then being diagnosed as having lip cancer.\n\nLawrie, who lives with his wife Marian and two young boys in a smart detached bungalow in Kingswells, a suburb of Aberdeen, has no immediate plans to move. But his new super status may see him purchase another base further south for commuting purposes.\n\nHe may have plans to spend some of his Â£350,000 prizemoney on a new Ferrari, but it is hard to see him changing his persona.\n\n\"Remember me when you're a millionaire,\" he often heard in fun from the members at Newmachar, the club to which he is attached as touring professional, when he returned from a European tournament.\n\nBy the end of this week he will, in all probability, be a millionaire a couple of times over under the guidance of Mark McCormack's IMG organisation, but that is unlikely to alter him. He has always made a point of remembering people, always ready to give advice to members when asked.\n\nPeter Smith, the head professional at Newmachar, gave a further insight into the new Open champion. \"I remember when he turned professional with Doug Smart. He used to lock up the shop - and then go and practise until it was dark.\n\n\"He has always possessed this tremendous self-belief. He would work on weights to develop what he believed was the perfect physique for golf and was never off the practice range.\n\n\"He always felt that there was scope for improvement. He decided on a change of course and employed Adam Hunter as his coach, and look at the outcome. Now he still practises hard, but all on the right things.\n\n\"While I don't know what his immediate reaction will be, I'm certain that in the long term he will stake his claim as one of the world's top golfers. Such is his strength of character.\"\n\nLawrie, after a day of \"onslaught\" from the media, celebrated last night at his club in Aberdeen, where he is almost certain to follow the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and be given the freedom of the city.\n\nHis victory has secured a Ryder Cup spot in September, a place in the US Masters next April and 10-year exemptions on both the USPGA and European circuits. And that is for starters.\n\n\"He will probably now earn a big fee every time he goes to the toilet,\" said McDonald. \"But I bet he will still come out and have a 'bounce' game with me when time permits. After all, we did finish all square last time and no cash changed hands.\""
