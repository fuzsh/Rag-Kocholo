        "text": "Paul Lawrie and Carnoustie Golf Links have formed a new partnership which will see the 1999 Open Champion represent the venue as its attached Touring Professional, and becoming an ambassador for the Angus venue.\n\nLawrie, 51, who is now competing on the Staysure Tour, said: “I’m really thrilled to be able to wear the Carnoustie Golf Links logo on my chest and to promote such an historic and wonderful venue when I play events all around the world.\n\n“Obviously, my own career is inextricably linked with Carnoustie, because it is the scene of what is my greatest success as a golfer. I love this place anyway, because of my history with it, but the ongoing investments by the Links over the past several years, in their facilities and golf development programmes, has stepped-it-up to another level altogether. The fantastic new Links House is what you’d expect of a world class complex and the three courses here are all excellent, not just the Championship Course which we know best.”\n\nHe added: “Junior development is also extremely close to my heart. My Foundation was born, largely, off the back of my Open success and to see the brilliant work being done by Carnoustie on this front is exciting. I look forward to being able to contribute to their great work within the local community around the inclusive golf development programmes, lending my own experience and insights to assist PGA Head Professional Keir McNicoll and his coaching team to help nurture future talent from the Carnoustie area. ”\n\nSpeaking about the relationship, Michael Wells, Chief Executive of Carnoustie Golf Links said: “We are delighted to partner with Paul Lawrie, as Carnoustie Golf Links Touring professional. At Carnoustie we want to be considered as a flagship for the modernisation of the game. By joining forces with Paul, we can work together and unify our collective commitment to innovation and golf development, and we look forward to working together to create maximum benefit for all.”"
