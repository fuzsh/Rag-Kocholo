        "text": "Mark Hensby’s golf career has been marked by resilience. Faced with a difficult road to success in professional golf, Hensby persevered and has managed to make a career for himself. What few people know about the Australian, though, is that his resiliency was forged through a difficult upbringing, one that he refused to let define him.\n\n“My dad was both mentally and physically abusive,” Hensby said. “It was to an extreme that people wouldn't understand. To go home every afternoon thinking something bad is probably going to happen is a hard way to live as a kid. I took it upon myself to make sure I wasn't home very often.”\n\nHensby’s life with his father was so volatile, in fact, that his daily routine included leaving the house before his father – who worked nights – got home. His usual escape from what is supposed to be one’s safe place started each morning at 4:45 a.m., just prior to his father’s 5 a.m. return home. At the other end of each long day, with one exception, Hensby would not return home for the night until his father had left for work.\n\n“I was 12 years old when I first played golf,” Hensby said. “Me and a kid up the street I played rugby with one day said, ‘Let's go play nine holes of golf’. We both laughed, like, ‘Play what?’. But we did it – we went and played nine holes. And that’s where it all started.”\n\n“Now that I look back in time, I see that, yes, it definitely was (an escape),” Hensby said of his childhood home with his father. “But, in saying that, I had become obsessed with golf, too. So, I think it was a perfect storm. I didn't want to be at home, and I was obsessed with golf.”\n\n“That was a funny one, because I didn't do it every night, just Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights,” he recalled. “I then got a second job as a postman, delivering mail. Thursdays and Fridays were a little tough, because I worked until 2 a.m. at the restaurant, then had to be up at 5 a.m., just a few hours later, to go to the post office.”\n\nCollege would have provided him the chance to further, both, his education and golf game. More than anything else, though, it would have provided him somewhere to possibly find the peace he never was never afforded at home.\n\n“When you grow up, let’s say you have Tiger Woods on one hand, whose dad always told him he was going to be great and well…” Hensby said. “But, then there’s the kid who is always being told he’s wasting his time and will never amount to anything. You get told that a million times and it’s definitely going to be a harder road.”\n\nHensby said that playing golf in college was always in his mind. His concern, though, was that not many people knew about him because of where he lived. It wasn’t a major city which, Hensby said, is a big kind of handicap in Australia. He never did receive a scholarship.\n\nThrough a mutual friend of Marks, Hensby was offered a move to America in 1994; specifically, Chicago. If willing to relocate to the Windy City, he was told, this mutual friend offered free lodging and even practice facility access at the famed Cog Hill. Hensby wasted little time making his decision of which way to go at that life intersection.\n\n“That has been exaggerated over the years,” Hensby insisted. “I didn't do it for three months (as reported). It was just that, at times, there was nowhere for me to stay. The people I’d come over to stay with left and I had nowhere to go.”\n\nAs often as he could, Hensby would sneak into the upstairs of the clubhouse, where some of the staff stayed, in an effort to possibly find an unclaimed bed. Most nights, though, he was out of luck and ended up sleeping in his car in the Cog Hill parking lot.\n\n“When it got to wintertime, it got quite cold, so I'd have to drive around to warm the car up for a little bit,” Hensby said. “The range manager found me one really cold morning. My feet were almost frozen, so people helped me along the way and found me somewhere to stay. That was very nice.”\n\nBy that point, Hensby had covered a lot of ground, personally, professionally and emotionally. With each passing day, his resolve grew tougher. He drew as much strength and focus from the things that didn’t work out as he did from those that did. Having risen above the trials and tribulations of his childhood resulted in a resilient and patient player.\n\nAt the BMW Championship on the PGA TOUR on the Fourth of July in 2004, Hensby finished T3, three strokes behind winner Stephen Ames. A week after that 2004 top-5 finish in Chicago, Hensby took what he hoped to be good momentum to Silvis, Illinois for the John Deere Classic. After making an ace on the third hole in round one at TPC Deere Run, Hensby overcame a 4-stroke deficit beginning the final round with a 5-under 66 to finish at 16-under 268 and tied with John Morgan after 72 holes.\n\nOn the second playoff hole, the kid from a small town outside of New South Wales who had picked up the game as a means of self-preservation emerged victorious. In addition to being quite a handsome payday, the validation for all his years of tireless, perhaps even stubborn, work had finally reached fruition.\n\n“He's a great kid,” Hensby said. “He's a love of my life. He's intelligent and has come a long way from where he was five years ago with all the help. All kids are special, but I think kids on the spectrum of autism are so special.”\n\n“It's sad that they get treated differently because my boy is in a normal school,” Hensby said. “He has issues that other kids don't, but we wanted him to be in that school. He's having a really hard time now, so it's been tough.”\n\n“Everything was re-evaluated with my wife over Christmas,” he said. “With Caden on the spectrum, she has to deal with a lot more than most parents. That was part of the reason I was going to call it quits. I just couldn't give them enough time.”\n\n“Kim has had to deal with a lot on her own, mentally and physically,” Hensby said. “But, she sees what I'm about and why I still want to pursue this. I want to make his life easier. I want to make her life easier. So, that talk around Christmas was tough, but it was good.”\n\n“It's going to make it easier to keep my card for sure this year,” Hensby said of his PGA TOUR Champions playing prospects and scheduling ability. “Any time you have good finishes, it breeds confidence. You can act confident, but until you have some success, it's pretty much just in your head. Morocco helped with the year going forward and, hopefully, created some momentum.”\n\n“Financially, you want to be able to supply the best resources for your kid, especially my little boy,” Hensby said. “People think you just make that sort of money in a week, but there's so much more prep and lead-up work. There’s so much more that people don't see. So, yes, this all definitely validates what Kim and I talked about and where we want to go for the next few years… for our boy.”\n\n“The way my dad was to me is scarring, because I know how I am to my kids,” Hensby said. “I never heard ‘I love you.’ There just wasn’t ever anything positive, even towards the end of his life. I never got any of that. It’s really hard for a kid. There are still times, actually a few times a week, when I think about it. It never leaves you. It’s with you for life.”\n\nHensby admitted that before having kids of his own, he never knew for sure exactly how he would fare as a father, especially after having endured the relentless pain and sadness brought on by his own father.\n\n“It didn’t take long for my kids to realize I was going to be a great dad,” Hensby said, fighting back tears. “I never wanted to be like my dad. I made a 360 turn straight away. I hug Caden and tell him I love him every day.”\n\n“At that, I said, ‘Well, all I know is not to treat my kids the way you treated us’, said Hensby. “In that way, he made me a better dad for sure.”\n\n“I think what I’m most proud of now is what I am for my kids,” Hensby said. “I know my kids will always be able to look at me and say with confidence ‘He was a great dad’. I would like to be remembered as someone who was a hard worker. I think a lot of people misunderstand me as a person, but they don’t see a lot of the things I’ve dealt with in my life. But, more than anything, I’d most like for my kids to know their dad loves them, that he would do anything for them and that he will be there for them forever and ever.”"
