        "text": "(Reuters) - Former British Open champion Paul Lawrie hopes the potential qualification of his son Craig for the tournament would make up for his own withdrawal due to injuries.\n\nCraig was one of the nine players to make the cut for the final qualifying stage which will take place at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian next Tuesday.\n\n\"To see him peg it up at an Open would be one of the proudest things ever,\" Paul Lawrie told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"He has a chance. He's only 23, but he's progressing nicely. It'll be great to see him get through.\"\n\nThe 49-year-old, who won the British Open in 1999, will not make a return to its 147th edition due to persistent foot and back problems.\n\n\"It was obviously a difficult decision to make but I just thought a few weeks ago, 'man, I can't do this anymore',\" Lawrie added.\n\n\"My body just won't let me do what my mind wants. I just feel frustrated that I can't play and hit balls the way I want to and I can't get into positions I want to get into.\"\n\nThe Open begins on July 19 at the Carnoustie Golf Links.\n\n(Reporting By Arnab Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)"
