        "text": "Ye Wo-cheng is set to become the European Tour’s youngest competitor tomorrow when he tees up in the Volvo China Open aged just 12 years and 242 days.\n\nThe Chinese child-star will take almost a full year off the previous record, held by Masters best-placed amateur Guan Tian-lang.\n\n“I’m very happy to be the youngest player on The European Tour, and also a little nervous at the same time,” said Wo-cheng, who gained his place in the field thanks to a good finish in the Western China qualifier.\n\n“I’m looking forward to the tournament, and hopefully I can play well. My main aim this week is just to go out there and enjoy it; I don’t really want to think too much about the result.\n\n“It’s very helpful that I have my coach here this week, he’s taught me a lot about how to play in the wind. This course is very long, and it will play even longer in the wind, but it gives me confidence to know that he is here to give me tips and advice on how to cope in the conditions. I’m excited about getting started tomorrow.”\n\nWo-cheng will also be joined by 15-year-old Bai Zheng-kai and 16-year-old Dou Ze-cheng, in an event that has made a history of providing youngsters their first tour starts.\n\nPlenty of players in the field are older than the combined age of the three Chinese youngsters, including Ryder Cup star Paul Lawrie and 2014 captain Paul McGinley.\n\n16-year-old Ze-cheng added: “I think the main reason for the success of young Chinese players is that we pick up the game at an early age, and we practice really hard. Hopefully that practice can pay off this week.\n\n“I always wear my lucky hat out on the course, because it helps me shoot lower. I played really well the first time I wore it, and have worn it ever since. Hopefully the luck continues this week.”\n\nDefending champion Branden Grace admitted in his pre-tournament press conference that he was curious to see how a 12-year-old fares in a field containing no fewer than eight past and present Ryder Cup stars. “It’s amazing,” said the South African.\n\n“I only started playing the game at 11, so I wouldn’t like to think what handicap I was playing off when I was 12! I spoke to his coach yesterday, and he told me he’s been winning almost every amateur tournament he’s played in this year. So I’ll be looking out for his results here this week, as I’m sure will most other people."
