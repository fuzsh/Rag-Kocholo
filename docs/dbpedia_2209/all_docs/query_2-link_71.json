        "text": "IN the sandhills of Royal St. George's, golf's newest name, S. K. Ho, was up there on the British Open leader board yesterday when Ernie Els was asked what he knew about Ho, a 29-year-old South Korean pro.\n\n''Just,'' Els said with a smile, ''that he has a shorter surname than me.''\n\nHo also has a better 36-hole score than anybody else except Davis Love III, the leader at one under par going into the third round today. Only two strokes back with Thomas Bjorn, the Danish Ryder Cupper, after a 73 yesterday, Ho maintained the British Open's tradition of introducing previously little-known golfers to the world stage, especially to American television viewers.\n\nSo say hello to the golfer known here as Mr. Ho, not to be confused with Mr. Lu.\n\nIf you don't remember Mr. Lu, Lee Trevino will never forget him. When Trevino won the British Open in 1971 at Royal Birkdale, Lu Liang Huan, a Taiwanese pro in a porkpie hat, finished one stroke behind, but never again surfaced on the leader board of a major tournament.\n\nOver the years, other names have suddenly appeared in the last groups on the weekend at the British Open, but some seemed to disappear just as quickly.\n\nLike Simon Owen of New Zealand, who finished second to Jack Nicklaus in 1978 at St. Andrews. Or Gordon Brand of England, second to Greg Norman in 1986 at Turnberry. Or Mike Harwood of Australia, second to Ian Baker-Finch in 1991 at Royal Birkdale.\n\nFor that matter, Baker-Finch soon disappeared, too. He is one of ABC's television announcers here.\n\nThen there's Jan Van de Velde, the Frenchman whose water-splashed triple-bogey 7 on Carnoustie's final hole in 1999 dropped him into a four-hole playoff with Paul Lawrie and Justin Leonard that Lawrie won. Van de Velde is a BBC Television guest analyst here.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
