        "text": "This page lists and links to every article published in the 3rd ser. of the William and Mary Quarterly (1944-present)\n\nWhen David Waldstreicher and I began doing the research for the article that would eventually become “Revolution in the Quarterly?: A Historiographical Analysis”, we soon discovered that there was no single ‘at a glance’ listing of the articles that have been published in the journal. To expedite our research, we asked a research assistant to put a spreadsheet together of the articles, and are now happy to share this work in the hope that it will help further historiographical research and teaching and access to the Quarterly essays. Note that the links are to the stable J-Stor citations for the articles. You will need access to an appropriate J-Stor subscription to access the full-text version of most of these articles.\n\nOur article was part of a special joint issue of the WMQ and the Journal of the Early Republic called \"Writing to and from the Revolution.\" The entire issue of the WMQ, along with our article - which includes a note on our method in an Appendix - is now freely available on the OI Reader app.\n\nFor some reflections on the creation of this list, and ideas about how to use it in the classroom, see the blog entry at The Panorama: Expansive Views from the Journal of the Early Republic. The blogsite also contains other posts about the joint special issue on the American Revolution."
