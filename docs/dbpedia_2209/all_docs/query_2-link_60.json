        "text": "David Jones (UK Golf Guy): One observation is that, at first glance, the list looks a bit boring because nothing in the top 10 actually changed! Why do you think that was, and do you think itâ€™s set now?\n\nChris Bertram: It takes a lot for something to move even just one place in the top 10, so I think itâ€™s fair to say that itâ€™s quite settled now. I don't really see the top three changing too much; they feel like they're a little bit separate from the rest to me. But I could see someone putting pressure on the lower places like North Berwick, and letâ€™s see what the Birkdale changes are like - they might be good or indifferent, so it could move either way. Portrush is getting consistently good reviews these days so I wouldnâ€™t be amazed if that threatens the top four.\n\nI certainly never think â€˜do we need to sex this up a bit?â€™ if there isnâ€™t big movement; quite the oppositeâ€¦ I canâ€™t wait to see lots of â€˜no movementâ€™ arrows and up/down 1 place arrows on your graphic!\n\nDJ: Obviously, the eye goes to the big moves. Three of the biggest come in Ireland. Adare Manor (up 12 to 43), Tralee (up 11 to 61), and Portstewart (up 15 to 84) are all big risers. Is it just a coincidence that the big movers come in Ireland?\n\nCB: Pure coincidence, other than the fact three have done a lot of work lately, which has now settled down, and more people have seen them. A good number of the panellists have been to Adare now and solidified what everyone else has said. There's not one person who has gone there and not enjoyed it, or not thought that it is an incredible improvement. It genuinely feels like a different course.\n\nIn fact, I've never known a course to change in character so much. Before Fazioâ€™s work, the rough was brutal and the fairways were narrow, and now, famously, there's no rough whatsoever. There was nothing to write home about regarding the green complexes before, and obviously, now they are very entertaining, to say the least.\n\nDJ: Tralee is another one. I remember when the last ranking came out, some Irish people were complaining it was ranked too low and saying you didnâ€™t know what you were talking about. Have you put it higher up the rankings just to shut them up?! What was the thinking, and what were the panellists telling you about it?\n\nCB: You're absolutely right, and those same people will probably still think it's way too low. Again, though, the work they have done there has been excellent. Beforehand there was famously one nine that was spectacular and the other not so much. Now they're much more evenly balanced. In fact, I would say now that if you asked people who came in blind which was the better nine, I think you would get a 50/50 split. That definitely wasn't the case before, and that's the reason it's gone up. If it was threatening the top 50, I don't think it would be madness.\n\nPortstewart was another example of a course that had suffered before with inconsistency; one explosive nine and one more sedate. In the six weeks or so leading up to the list being finalised, we had people firing off all over the country. We were trying to make sure we got to places that we felt were either possibly too low or too high - or should come in or drop out - by getting there right before the ranking was finalised. Portstewart was one we really looked at; we had three people at Portstewart in three or four weeks. The feedback was universally good. Credit to European Golf Design for the work they have done there; I very much doubt its upward journey is finished.\n\nDJ: And staying in Ireland, there was a notable rise again for St Patrickâ€™s Links at Rosapenna. Itâ€™s broken into the GB&I Top 20 but not the Irish top 5. Do you think it can one day?\n\nCB: A five-place jump at that end of the ranking is really significant. But I repeat what I said when I first went when it opened, which is that I feel ranking it excessively highly at this stage is actually doing it a disservice because of the expectations that come with a course, say, ranked in the World top 40. Such a new course is never going to be the finished article and I think it's still got a way to go, which is an exciting thing to say, because itâ€™s in the GB&I top 20 already. I don't think it's crazy to say it's got 20% of improvement still to come as nature runs its course and it matures. They will continue to refine it and tinker too. But then again, we had a panellist come over especially from America to play it - it is on everyoneâ€™s radar, which is clearly not a bad thing. I just worry that some people will view it as too raw and that detracts from what I think is a phenomenal design and setting. I think it will end up No.3 in Ireland.\n\nDJ: Another really notable rise was for the Addington (up 15 to 73). I've actually held off visiting it because every time I think I will, I read about what is coming next, so I hold off. You have been, what do you think of what youâ€™ve seen?\n\nCB: I was exactly the same, and left it pretty much to the last minute to go and see it - I think I went a week before the absolute final deadline for the same reason. They're about halfway through the work, and itâ€™s already transformed the course. I think a lot of the heavy lifting has been done, but theyâ€™ve still got a good way to go. By its nature, doing that kind of work can be a little scarring, but as it matures and develops over time. I wouldnâ€™t be at all surprised if it went up the same again after another two years of work and two years of bedding in. I absolutely loved it; itâ€™s just fun, memorable hole after fun, memorable hole. Credit to the owner Ryan Noades and his architects Clayton, DeVries and Pont.\n\nDJ: Often we see courses that drop out gone forever, but two courses came back in this time, Royal Ashdown Forest and Southerness. What led to that?\n\nCB: Previously, with Royal Ashdown Forest, there had been a little bit of a conditioning issue on the West course, and I think that had reflected on the Old too. There was just a bit of a negative vibe, but I admit that was a move that was probably a bit harsh.\n\nAs for Southerness, itâ€™s my â€˜localâ€™ top 100 course, so I'm always careful of seeming biased with it, but we played it for our Scottish panel get-together two weeks before the list was finished, and I've never seen it in better condition. They've really done some first-class work there. It's a very welcoming club these days and it didn't always used to be. When I was growing upâ€”it was very insular. But now they do a really good job making it a place you want to play.\n\nDJ: I was surprised to see that Wallasey had never been in the top 100, but the panel was obviously impressed with what they saw.\n\nCB: People probably wonâ€™t be surprised to see it coming in as you hear a lot on social media about how good it is now. So I was wondering if it really was that good. It is. Iâ€™d played it twice before, but probably not for seven years, and I was really impressed.\n\nThe head greenkeeper, a local guy called John McLoughlin, is a very good golfer and really knows his stuff. When the job came up, he realised it had the potential to be something really special. And it is - it is in the list to stay. You certainly shouldn't ever go to that part of the world now and play Hoylake and not Wallasey.\n\nThe 10th is a great example - it used to have deciduous trees down both sides, and you were just chipping it down trying to avoid trouble, then you played up to a tabletop green. It was probably the worst hole there, not befitting a Top 100 course. Now itâ€™s one of the best holes thereâ€”theyâ€™ve opened it up to make a great, scenic risk and reward hole.\n\nHindhead is the other new entry. I hadn't played there until recently and was thoroughly impressed. There are some incredible valley holes made by glaciers on the front nine that are truly spectacular. Then, on the back nine, it becomes a little bit less dramatic but maybe more strategic. Itâ€™s a great contrast, and I wouldnâ€™t like to say which nine I preferred. It's something a bit different from the Surrey-Berkshire heathlands but doesn't feel like a whimsical choice; they all feel like entries that are here to stay.\n\nDJ: Of course, for every rise, there is a fall, and if one course goes up a lot of places, it will push a lot of courses down. Pennard (down 9 to 70) and Brora (down 11 to 88) have both dropped significantly, and Royal Worlington and Newmarket and Royal North Devon have left the list completely. Is there a theme here that slightly quirky courses have been punished this time around?\n\nCB: The difficulty in producing these lists is trying to create a ranking that speaks to all types of golfers because not everyone's the same. Not everyone wants a strategic, nuanced, quirky links. Some people want more dramatic scenery. Some people want a lot of water or an amazingly manicured course, for example.\n\nI think that during Covid we were in an echo chamber, and maybe the list after that promoted certain types of courses a little too much. We were just talking to your friends and not being out there playing golf with and hearing views from a wide cross-section of golfers.I think at that point we got a little too much towards the nuanced, quirky courses. They are my personal preference, but they are not for everyone.\n\nSome will criticise us for the falls for those courses but Iâ€™d just say we arenâ€™t creating lists for one certain type of golfer. We are trying to include the best courses of all types and for all tastes - that is by far the hardest part of what I do. When a ranking is more focused, such as the â€˜X Factorâ€™ ones where itâ€™s all about scenery, drama, it is so much easier. And finally, there are still plenty of nuance, and strategic courses doing well - in fact, Iâ€™d say more now than at any other time other than the 2022 list.\n\nPennard feels a little bit low to me personally, but I understand why it's trending in that direction. I absolutely love it, and I think it's actually close to being the number two in Wales. But we possibly did just get a bit giddy with it previously. It's great, but it's not for everyone, and maybe we just went a little too far last time.\n\nDJ: What about Royal Worlington and Newmarket going out of the list completely?\n\nCB: I think that's just a nine-hole thing. The quality is so ridiculously high now that it's really hard to see a nine-hole course in there - it would have to be absolutely extraordinary. If you look at the end of the list now, they are just superb courses - and that continues right the way into the Next 100.\n\nIf someone said to me the course at No.112 is as good as the course at number 90, it would be hard to argue with them. The margins are so fine. Itâ€™s therefore very hard for a nine-hole course to break in because, obviously, you only have half the holes.\n\nDJ: You talk in the magazine about conditioning being the main reason for West Sussexâ€™s drop (down 16 to 58). Can you expand on that a bit?\n\nCB: It pains me as it had been on an upward trajectory into the 40s, and I really love it there, but it has suffered with conditioning issues. We have three members of West Sussex as panellists. It's probably the best-represented course on the panel, and the feedback from at least one of them was that they would have it significantly lower. They adore the golf course, they adore the golf club, but they're saying it's just not quite right. Which I really admire from them and which people should consider when they suggest we are biased or canâ€™t be objective.\n\nI know that they're addressing it, and by the time this list actually comes out, they'll be on the road to rectifying it. And Iâ€™d love to see it rise next time.\n\nDJ: The list is obviously a product of a panel of raters which you chair. But if it was just up to you, which three courses would you have higher, and which three courses would you have lower?\n\nCB: I would have St Patrick's higher; as I say, itâ€™s still a little bit raw for some people, but that doesnâ€™t bother me as much. Then Iâ€™d have Swinley and Prestwick higher too.\n\nI probably wouldnâ€™t have Ballyliffin Glashedy as high as it is, and I wouldnâ€™t have The European as high either. Pat Ruddy will have even less affection for me now. As to the last one, if it was just me, I would probably have Lytham a bit lower.\n\nDJ: And any courses you think were unlucky to just miss out?\n\nCB: We have the full list of 101-200 in the magazine. Itâ€™s a really arbitrary cut-off; you could go all the way down to 130, and any of those courses are worthy of inclusion. I absolutely mean that.\n\nObviously the ones that dropped out were right in the mix and losing Sherwood Forest pains me; I kind of feel that is an easy one to leave out. That is a course that will never be anything other than 95-105 for me.\n\nAnyway, Narin and Portnoo was very close for me. They have done a lot of work which I really liked, but it isnâ€™t universally popular, which surprised me. But they are definitely knocking on the door. There are plenty more like it that are so close to being a top 100 course.\n\nHayling is another one. Thatâ€™s gone from being in the lower end of the England list to knocking on the GB&I door.\n\nPanmure and Dunbar are two more; Iâ€™d love those in to be honest and Iâ€™ll happily admit I think they are as good as anything in the 90s.\n\nThe role is not without responsibility. The lists Chris produces can put courses on the map, but if a course drops significantly down a list, then golf club committees are likely to start asking questions. I spoke to him recently to find out more about the process for putting these lists together. Hopefully you find it interesting. And yes, I asked him if he gets offered bribes!\n\nUK Golf Guy (UKGG): Tell me a little bit about how you got into the business of ranking golf courses?\n\nChris Bertram (CB): I initially worked on Golf World (and Todayâ€™s Golfer) as a sub-editor and the first issue I worked on happened to be the biennial GB&I Top 100. I didnâ€™t have anything to do with the ranking, but I did all the features.\n\nIn those days there was just the GB&I and Continental Europe rankings really, every two years, but then we added England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales lists and I worked on those in collaboration with the legendary Jock Howard.\n\nSomehow I was given the Continental European list to pull together by myself - in 2011 I think. I'd played about 23 of the 100 and I just hated it because my knowledge was so sketchy, meaning I was asking the opinions of someone in Portugal, someone in France, someone in Spain, someone in Italy and I was melding them together. While no ranking is ever a scientific process, that just felt especially random.\n\nIâ€™d played probably 80 of the GB&I Top 100 at that point - mainly from 2002 to 2009 - but my continental knowledge was poor and thatâ€™s when I started getting really serious about it. I never wanted to be â€˜guessingâ€™ ever again, and I havenâ€™t. The list got much better as a result I think, changing a *lot* from the 2011 one. From â€˜guessingâ€™ - by which I mean relying largely on the views of others - in 2011, to when I finalise the 2023 list,, I am pretty sure Iâ€™ll have played all 100, from Norway to Turkey and France to Slovakia. Iâ€™m on 92 at the moment\n\nUKGG: Tell me a little bit about the process for how you put a Top 100 list together.\n\nCB: What I donâ€™t do is just start a ranking at the beginning of a magazine cycle then finish it on deadline day. Itâ€™s a constantly ongoing process; researching courses (playing them!), liaising with panellists, recruiting panellists, speaking to architects, setting panellists tasks, planning features, and of course actually writing the descriptions.\n\nTake the new England list. Itâ€™s been two years since the last one came out and a month hasnâ€™t gone past when Iâ€™ve not been thinking about it. The fact it is that a Top 200 rather than 100 only intensified that task.\n\nUKGG: The panel you put together must be a key part of the process. How do you go about putting it together?\n\nCB: It absolutely is. I chair the panel and clearly play a key role in pulling all the views and marks together - and I think it is essential someone who has played most of the courses under consideration does this and is almost a little autocratic. But the panel are crucial, ensuring no stone is left unturned. In some lists, such as the continental courses and resorts one, I dominate a bit more compared to, say, Scotland or Ireland or GB&I, but Iâ€™ve never published a list where I wasnâ€™t incredibly thankful for my panel.\n\nIt is really important not to just surround yourself with people who think the same way about courses as you do. Otherwise it becomes an echo chamber - and I admit that during Covid especially that happened a bit.\n\nThe number one thing is I'm looking for someone who's played widely, that's absolutely crucial. I don't want someone who gives me great insight about 18 courses of the 130 under consideration. Panel members should have played 70 percent of the list at a minimum, 80%+ usually. I just think it's absolutely crucial to be able to compare widely. I know others have different views on that, but I think it's absolutely vital.\n\nUKGG: And do you think it matters what standard of golfers are on the panel?\n\nCB: No, I don't. People read the magazine of all handicaps, so itâ€™s important we represent everyone - the average handicap in Britain is more than 18! Most panellists are probably off 18 and under and there are a lot of us in the 9, 10, 11, 12 bracket. In 2023 we will be doing a ranking specifically by low-handicaps, which will be interesting.\n\nUKGG: You tend not to have professionals on your panels. Why is that?\n\nCB: I was involved when Nick Faldo was on the Golf World panel and I don't think itâ€™s giving too much away to say that he wasn't slaving over the list for hours on end like the rest of us. He would say that he preferred Muirfield to The Old Course and things like that, which was useful but he just hadnâ€™t played enough courses, as mad as that sounds, to contribute fully. He will have played the Sauntons of this world as an amateur but just hadn't played widely enough to really help and thatâ€™s the case with most touring pros. Iâ€™m not saying I know more about courses than a tour pro, Iâ€™m saying I know about more courses than most tour pros.\n\nBut itâ€™s not always the case. Ronan Rafferty has played very widely and is just brilliant on the subject. Heâ€™s been on some panels before and I would love him to be on all of them. But heâ€™s got lots on so isnâ€™t always able to contribute.\n\nUKGG: So the panel is a vital part about it. What about the criteria you use to score the courses? That must have a huge influence on the output? (The criteria Golf World uses are - Design 40 marks, Setting 15, Memorability 15, Playability 10, Consistency 10, Presentation 10)\n\nCB: It has a massive impact. I decided the categories, in consultation with a few people, and the weighting is also crucial. You're never going to get people agreeing on the criteria but I look at it now and I think it's about right. Some people think that presentation is too low at 10% and would have that higher, but I think itâ€™s about right. We don't always play the course when itâ€™s in perfect condition - sometimes we play in the winter or when thereâ€™s been hollow tining the week before for example - and I think it's unfair to mark a course down because of that. Places that are a bit more raw - letâ€™s say Askernish - lose a mark or two and places like Ferndown or Carnoustie that are exceptionally presented gain one, and one mark is crucial.\n\nWe print all the criteria marks and that immediately alerts the reader to a course which may have great design but the conditioning isn't always quite there. Printing the breakdown helps them know a bit more about what to expect when theyâ€™re deciding where to go. I donâ€™t think we could be more transparent about who decides the ranking and on what basis.\n\nUKGG: It's fair to say your criteria, unlike some others out there, is all about the course. So you don't take into account onsite facilities or the practice facilities or the quality of the clubhouse. Why is that?\n\nCB: I want these rankings to be all about the course. It's hard enough ranking just the course anyway, never mind adding in other variables! As Rafferty said to me once, I don't want to know what the tea and scones are like!\n\nUKGG: It's only the last 20 years that rankings have had such a profile. What do you see as the value in them? What's the end benefit?\n\nCB: Weâ€™ll produce 13 different lists next year, covering a whole variety of areas and also budgets. I truly believe they help people make choices about where to go on a golf break and what to expect when they get there. If they've got a certain budget, for example, our lists will help them find four courses reasonably close to each other for under Â£60 or even under Â£35. No-one can surely say we arenâ€™t bringing courses to peopleâ€™s attention they might not have heard of.\n\nOf course not everyoneâ€™s going to agree with the order - probably everyone on every panel would disagree with the final list. But I'm confident that we're identifying, say, 90 of the Top 100 in an area, country or price point. Thereâ€™s never going to be a definitive list, but Iâ€™m confident we are getting most things right and that the rankings more accurately reflect whatâ€™s out there than ever before, simply because we are so much more aware ourselves of what is out there.\n\nWe're busting myths at times. That might sound a little bit arrogant, but we're not just going along with what's always been thought about places. If we don't think somewhere is quite as good as it is made out to be, then the list will change accordingly.\n\nI had Turnberry at 15 in GB&I a few years ago and everyone thought I was a clueless. I thought it was living off the past frankly - the Duel in the Sun and its amazing setting. So we're not scared to go against received wisdom but we arenâ€™t going to be contrarian for the sake of it. And because I left to work elsewhere for two years and the lists all went in a different direction during that period, there have been some big movement in the lists since then - that will settle down and I look forward to smaller â€˜up and downâ€™ numbers on your graphicsâ€¦!\n\nUKGG: Thereâ€™s always going to be criticism of lists like this. Especially the high profile ones. Do you have to have a really thick skin or does every comment cut you to the quick?\n\nCB: Some comments hurt, the nonsense ones when people claim a certain course must have been ranked that high because money changed hands or there was a nice burger eaten or nonsense like that. Or we are just making it up.\n\nBut if someone says, â€˜I don't understand how course X can be below Course Y and here are my reasons whyâ€™ then I really like to hear that. Often there is absolutely nothing between the two courses and Iâ€™ll accept their points.\n\nI donâ€™t think I, or we, know it all. And there is no right or wrong - I give myself about three places â€˜slackâ€™ for courses in the top 10 (in other words we have them in their rightful place within about three spots), about seven in the top 25, at least 10 in the rest of the top 50 and then in the second 50, anything within about 20 spots.\n\nThat â€˜slackâ€™ doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™d be better off grouping in my view, because with grouping you still obviously have cut-offs that would grate.\n\nUKGG: If someone comments on Instagram or Twitter about a course that you haven't been to or you don't think the panel have seen, do you make a point of getting there before the next list is out?\n\nCB: Absolutely. That doesn't happen often though because we have a lot of crazily well-travelled panellists. Take Scotland - we've got three people that have played every course in the country and a fourth whoâ€™s about six short. So we're not just guessing.\n\nBut in the continent, for example, if someone says â€˜have you seenâ€¦?â€™ I could not be more interested.\n\nUKGG: Clearly you work for a commercial organisation, youâ€™re not just doing this for fun and your publisher wants to make money. When the magazine comes out you presumably have an advertising sales team who are looking to bring in revenue. What role does that play in terms of how that ranking looks?\n\nCB: It plays zero role in the order of the actual list itself. Clubs have tried to catch me out before, and asked if they pay their way to get higher up the ranking. Itâ€™s always a categorical â€˜no, that's not how we do itâ€™.\n\nThe one thing that I do is often reward anyone whoâ€™s supporting us with an advert with a bigger entry - a few more words for the listing or a bigger picture. Some people might dislike that tactic, but we need to get some support from clubs to keep the whole thing going. Without them there is no ranking and, without a rankingâ€¦ Well OK, most people probably wouldn't lose any sleep over it, but I genuinely believe we are helping to lift the lid on a lot of these places.\n\nUKGG: What's your personal coverage like across the big lists.\n\nCB: Iâ€™ve played all the Top 100 in GB&I and then Iâ€™m in the 90s in most of the other big ones - Continental European courses, Continental European resorts, GB&I Resorts - and certainly Scotland and England. In Ireland Iâ€™m only at about 50 - the top 50 - but I have a very good Irish panel. Kevin Markham, who's played every course in Ireland, chairs that for me. Wales Iâ€™m on about 30, and weâ€™ve just expanded that to a whopping 75 after I unearthed an incredible panel.\n\nGB&I Links Iâ€™m missing Askernish and thatâ€™s it.\n\nMiddle East & Africa Iâ€™m missing the trio in Kuwait, Saudi, Bahrain and the Atlantic coast courses in Morocco.\n\nAs I said, I think it's absolutely crucial the person who's putting it all together has played the vast majority of courses. I know others donâ€™t view it that way but I think itâ€™s key.\n\nUKGG: Do you get much feedback from the clubs, either positive or critical?\n\nCB: Ha, you barely hear from someone when it's gone well, but that's just human nature, isn't it? Itâ€™s like golf itself - you tend to remember your bad shots more than the good ones, annoyingly.\n\nBut yes, I do hear sometimes and it can be scathing.\n\nThe nice comments - and its usually from a mid-ranking course that appreciates that we are encouraging people to go on golf breaks by publishing the lists - keep you going.\n\nUKGG: What kind of negative comments have you had?\n\nCB: That I'm an idiot, have no idea what I'm doing, I just make it up, that another ranking is the â€˜officialâ€™ one, that Iâ€™m creating a list for a few people who drink Kummel, that to get on the panel you've got to wear plus-fours and play in The President's Putter. The last suggestion is complete nonsense! Total nonsense. It would be fair to say that panellists are generally well off because they've had the means to play all these courses. But we are not a cabal of minor aristocracy.\n\nUKGG: Do any clubs ask for constructive criticism and what they can do to improve?\n\nCB: Some do. And honestly the vicious ones are fewer than 10%. You'll then get 40% that ask questions of clarity, then youâ€™ll get some who genuinely want to know what they need to do to feature.\n\nTake Villa Padierna in Malaga. The marketing person emailed me to say that she couldnâ€™t believe they werenâ€™t on the Continental resorts list. She suggested I come down to experience it for myself and if they still didnâ€™t make it in after that then, fair enough.\n\nNow, there are two things about that. One, in my job I probably should have known about Villa Padierna. But two, itâ€™s horrific for them and their marketing that I had never heard about it and no-one else had ever mentioned it to me! So, long story short, I went down, and the hotel is absolutely wonderful. I held my hands up and said â€˜it is my faultâ€™ and it went into the resorts list straight at number 26.\n\nThere's one in England, which is Bearwood Lakes, that will go up a lot in the next list because itâ€™d been marked down too severely in some areas - year-round condition, design cleverness - and if I have anything about me, one thing is that I'm always open about saying if we get it wrong.\n\nUKGG: Two of the lists you've done in the last couple years, which seem to have resonated a lot with people are the Under Â£60 and Â£35 lists.\n\nCB: They're perhaps the best examples of what I was saying about the worth of the lists. They highlight clubs that many, many people have never heard about. You can use those lists to put together an itinerary that isn't eye-wateringly expensive. Or mix and match the GB&I superstars in with some of the Under Â£60 or Â£35 ones. I do think that is a good service for golfers, and that is the whole point of the rankings - to help people make the best possible choices when theyâ€™re planning away days and breaks. Those price-point lists also stop and makes you think whether other courses should be quite as expensive as they are.\n\nUKGG: Do you think rating lists like these have actually fuelled green fee increases at the top end?\n\nCB: No, I don't think they do. I've literally never thought of that and I don't think they do. A lot of the increase in green fees is clubs trying to get on the overseas bandwagon.\n\nThere are a lot of elite clubs in the Â£170-Â£300 which I totally understand. It's a lot of money but I understand why people, especially from overseas, are willing to pay that.\n\nWhat I don't really like are the clubs just down the road from them that are expensive purely so that overseas golfers looking at them assume the high price means they must be great too.\n\nThe effect of that is that a fourball from Birmingham can't go up to the Highlands and play Course X because it's just too expensive for them. And I really donâ€™t like that.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how can Dunaverty present a course in the perfectly adequate condition it is, while another course in the same country with the same costs says they have to charge three times as much - and it's not a better golf course or in wildly better condition. I don't understand that. How can they do it?\n\nUKGG: Whatâ€™s the favourite list you do?\n\nCB: Continental Europe is still the one. Itâ€™s so different from so many of the others. The GB&I list in some ways is my least favourite because probably 75% of the courses, well, anyone could probably name them. But for the continent of Europe weâ€™ve discovered so many new places. I've been to so many different cool places and seen so many different courses.\n\nItâ€™s enhanced my education of architecture enormously because I've seen some of the classics by the great architects, the golden age architects in Europe, they just seem to come alive on the continent. And I love sorting the good modern ones from theâ€¦ well, trash. People spend a lot of money going abroad to play golf and I like trying to play a part in showing where the really good courses are.\n\nUKGG: And I guess for something like that your judgment is really important? So take for example, Lofoten which I probably hadn't heard of until it came up really high in one of your rankings and then I looked at some other rankings and it was in a much lower position. Do you doubt yourself sometimes when you make a big call like that?\n\nCB: Yeah, thatâ€™s a great example. Lots of people had seen pictures of it, but until you get there, you don't know if it's actually a good golf course or if it's just nice to look at.\n\nBut after spending time there I was confident about it. But it was a bit of a gamble. No-one had it ranked anywhere. It was my judgement and mine alone. Now itâ€™s in World Top 100 lists, not just mine.\n\nEqually, some people might go to Lofoten, card and pencil golfers, and maybe won't love it to be honest. So, while I was confident, I did still agonise. You could make yourself look like a real idiot if you got carried away with the setting and midnight golf.\n\nSo when you went there I was watching on Twitter to see if you were enjoying it. If you'd come away thinking â€˜I kind of get it, but not reallyâ€™ then I'd be worried Iâ€™d over-egged it. So I'm happy to take the pressure of the judgment, but I absolutely agonise over the big calls like that. I went too strong on Trump Aberdeen initially and you canâ€™t afford too many random calls or you start to lose any trust that you have. I do like to be bold, but not reckless.\n\nUKGG: So what courses do you want to see next?\n\nCB: Maybe I'm talking too much about the European list but this year that's the big one and itâ€™s also the one where I am bringing most new names to peopleâ€™s attention. I'm aiming to play all 100 on that list so I have a few to do. Denmark and Madrid are important places for me to get to.\n\nUKGG: And then they keep on building more and so it just keeps on going.\n\nCB: Yes, Comporta is the big new one to see. It's always fantastic when there's a really good new course to talk about in a ranking - and Iâ€™m expecting big things from that. I find it hard to believe it wonâ€™t be top 20 minimum. It's exciting when no-one's seen it before and the chances are I've been before anyone else. So you're actually doing some journalism there rather than just being Judith Chalmers!"
