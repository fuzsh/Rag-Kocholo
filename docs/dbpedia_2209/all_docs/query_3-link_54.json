        "text": "While we’re still in the middle of summer, some people are already getting cozy for fall. Even though fall drinks and treats haven’t officially landed yet, someone has leaked Starbucks’ fall menu.\n\nThe information comes from @Markie_Devo on Instagram, who is known for revealing fast-food menu items before they’re officially announced. This year’s fall lineup features the Pumpkin Spice Latte in various forms like iced, hot, or frappuccino. There’s also a new Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai and Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew. For pastries, there’s a Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin.\n\nStarbucks Fall Menu\n\nReactions to the leaked menu have been mixed. One person shared, “Wish they’d incorporate more caramel drinks, not everyone loves pumpkin [crying emoji].” Another chimed in, “Pumpkin cream cold brew is legit the best and I don’t even like pumpkin spice lattes.” And someone else excitedly declared, “Chiiiiiiile that pumpkin cream cheese muffin [heart emoji].”\n\n@Markie_Devo has previously leaked information about Taco Bell’s Mountain Dew Baja Blast Gelato before its official release. The Instagram post read, “It’s finally happening!! Taco Bell is bringing the MTN DEW Baja Blast Gelato nationwide. This is in highlight of Baja Blast 20th ‘BAJAVERSARY’.” Taco Bell later confirmed the news with a press release and additional celebrations.\n\nIn addition to pumpkin-themed items, Starbucks is also introducing other fall products, such as an Iced Apple Crisp Cream Chai and a Salted Pecan Cream Cold Foam. There will be a Baked Apple Croissant, Oat Milk Iced Apple Crisp Shaken Espresso, Oat Milk Apple Crisp Macchiato, and a new Iced Oat Milk Pecan Crunch Latte. The fall menu also includes themed treats like the Mummy Cookie and Raccoon Cake Pop (vanilla flavored).\n\nIf last year’s timeline is any indication, these fall items could be available around August 22. The Pumpkin Spice Latte launched on August 24 last year, so expect similar timing for these new offerings. However, the Iced Oat Milk Pecan Crunch Latte, Salted Pecan Cream Cold Foam, and the Mummy Cookie may be released later, around September 19.\n\nIn May, Starbucks launched their new Summer-Berry Starbucks Refreshers beverages, featuring a trio of drinks with a layer of popping raspberry-flavored pearls for an added burst of flavor.\n\nThey also brought back the popular White Chocolate Macadamia Cold Brew and introduced two new treats: the Orange Cream Cake Pop and Pineapple Cloud Cake. Additionally, Starbucks unveiled a summer drinkware collection, which includes an exclusive Stanley x Starbucks Quencher, along with cold cups, keychains, and more.\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
