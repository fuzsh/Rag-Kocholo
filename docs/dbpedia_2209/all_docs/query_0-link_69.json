        "text": "Widely considered as one of the greatest stage and screen actors of his generation both in his native Scotland and internationally, David Tennant was born David John McDonald in West Lothian, Scotland, to Essdale Helen (McLeod) and Sandy McDonald, who was a Presbyterian minister. He is of Scottish and Ulster-Scots descent. When he was about 3 or 4 years old, he decided to become an actor, inspired by his love of Doctor Who (1963).\n\nHe was brought up in Bathgate, West Lothian and Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland and was a huge fan of the band The Proclaimers. He attended Paisley Grammar school and while there he wrote about how he wanted to become a professional actor and play the role of the Doctor in Doctor Who (1963).\n\nHe made his first television appearance (which was also his first professional acting job) when he was 16, after his father sent some photos of him to a casting director at Scottish television. He also attended a youth theatre group at weekends run by the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now renamed the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland). When he was 16 he auditioned for and won a place at the academy; the youngest student to ever do so, and started as a full time drama student when he was 17.\n\nHe worked regularly in theatre and TV after leaving drama school, and his first big break came in 1994 when he was cast in a lead role in the Scottish drama Takin' Over the Asylum (1994). He then moved to London where his career thrived. Among other significant factors of his prolific artistic course, he spent several years as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and became famous from his lead roles in TV dramas Blackpool (2004) and Casanova (2005).\n\nIn 2005, his childhood wish came true. David was cast to play the role of the Doctor in Doctor Who (2005) alongside Billie Piper, after Christopher Eccleston decided to leave. Playing the Doctor made him a household name and a sex symbol, being voted \"Sexiest Man in the Universe\" by readers of The Pink Paper and 16th Sexiest Man in the World by a Cosmopolitan survey. Since leaving the series in 2010 his career has continued to rise, with lead roles in films, TV series and theatre.\n\nPeter Davison was born as Peter Malcolm Gordon Moffett on 13 April 1951 in Streatham, London. A decade later, he and his family - his parents, Sheila and Claude (an electrical engineer who hailed from British Guiana), and his sisters, Barbara, Pamela and Shirley, moved to Knaphill, Woking, Surrey, where Davison was educated at the Winston Churchill School. It was here that he first became interested in acting, taking parts in a number of school plays, and this eventually led to him joining an amateur dramatic society, the Byfleet Players.\n\nUpon leaving school at the age of sixteen, having achieved only modest academic success with three O Levels of undistinguished grades, he took a variety of short-lived jobs ranging from hospital porter to Hoffman press operator. He was still keen to pursue an acting career, however, and so applied for a place at drama school.\n\nDavison was accepted into the Central School of Speech and Drama and stayed there for three years. His first professional acting work came in 1972 when, after leaving drama school in the July of that year, he secured a small role in a run of \"Love's Labour's Lost\" at the Nottingham Playhouse. This marked the start of a three-year period in which he worked in a variety of different repertory companies around Great Britain, often in Shakespearean roles. He then made his television debut, playing a blond-wigged space cowboy character called Elmer in \"A Man for Emily\", a three-part story in the Thames TV children's series The Tomorrow People (1973) (April 1975). Appearing alongside him in this production was his future wife, American actress Sandra Dickinson, whom he had first met during a run of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" in Edinburgh. They married on 26 December 1978 in Dickinson's home town of Rockville, Maryland, USA.\n\nDavison spent the following eighteen months working as a file clerk at Twickenham tax office. He also took the opportunity to pursue an interest in singing and songwriting, which led him to record several singles with his wife. He later provided the theme tunes for a number of TV series, including Mixed Blessings (1978) and Button Moon (1980). Davison played the romantic lead, Tom Holland in Liebe zu Lydia (1977), a London Weekend Television (LWT) period drama serial transmitted in 1977.\n\nDavison's greatest acting breakthrough came when he played Tristan in the BBC's Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978), based on the books of country vet James Herriot. It was a highly successful series, which ran initially for three seasons between 1978-1980. His success in Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978) brought him many other offers of TV work. Among those that he took up were lead roles in two sitcoms: LWT's Holding the Fort (1980), in which he played Russell Milburn, and the BBC's Sink or Swim (1980), in which he played Brian Webber. Three seasons of each were transmitted between 1980-82, consolidating Davison's position as a well-known and popular television actor.\n\nIn 1980, Doctor Who (1963) producer John Nathan-Turner, who had worked with Davison as the production unit manager on Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978), cast him as the Fifth Doctor in the series. Taking over from Tom Baker, who had been in the role for an unprecedented seven years, Davison was seen as a huge departure as he was by far the youngest actor to date. Davison announced he was taking the lead role in Doctor Who (1963) on the BBC's lunchtime magazine program Pebble Mill at One (1972) on 3 December 1980, when he discussed with the presenter a number of costume ideas sent in by viewers and was particularly impressed by a suggestion from one of a panel of young fans assembled in the studio that the new Doctor should be \"like Tristan Farnon, but with bravery and intellect\".\n\nHis appearance in Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis (1981), was recorded on 19 December 1980 and transmitted on 2 February 1981, by which time the viewing public were well aware that he would soon be taking over the lead role in Doctor Who. There was in fact only a month to go before he would make his on-screen debut in the series - albeit a brief one, in the regeneration sequence at the end of Logopolis: Part Four (1981).\n\nHis first full story was in Castrovalva: Part One (1982), the first story of season nineteen transmitted on 4 January 1982. Another significant change for the series was that it was taken off Saturdays for the first time, instead being broadcast on Mondays and Tuesdays. Davison was an immediate hit as the Doctor, with ratings picking up considerably from Tom Baker's final season. Several episodes from Davison's first season achieved over 10 million viewers, which would be the last time these numbers would be achieved in the original run of Doctor Who (1963). One particular success from Davison's first season was the stylish return of the Cybermen in Earthshock: Part One (1982), which became the most popular Cybermen story since the 1960s.\n\nAs the incumbent Doctor, Davison took part in the major celebrations of the 20th anniversary of Doctor Who (1963) in 1983, which included the multi-Doctor special The Five Doctors (1983). Nevertheless, Davison found himself dissatisfied with his second season on Doctor Who (1963), feeling that the writing, directing, budgets and tight recording schedules in the studio were frequently letting it down. With this in mind and fearing typecasting, he finished his tenure at the end of his third season in The Caves of Androzani: Part Four (1984). He left on a high, as it has been repeatedly voted one of the best stories ever by fans.\n\nDavison became a father when, on December 25, 1984 (one day before the couple's sixth wedding anniversary), Dickinson gave birth to a daughter, Georgia Elizabeth, at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London. Ten years later, however, the marriage broke down and they separated and later divorced. Most of Davison's work since then has been in the medium for which he is best known: television.\n\nHis credits include regular stints as Henry Myers in Anna of the Five Towns (1985), as Dr. Stephen Daker in A Very Peculiar Practice (1986), as Albert Campion in Albert Campion (1989) and as Clive Quigley in Ain't Misbehavin (1994) all for the BBC, and as Ralph in Yorkshire TV's Fiddlers Three (1991). In addition, he has reprized his popular role of Tristan Farnon on a number of occasions for one-off specials and revival seasons of Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978).\n\nDavison has returned several times to the world of Doctor Who (1963). In 1993 he appeared as the Fifth Doctor in Doctor Who: Dimensions in Time (1993), a brief two-part skit transmitted as part of the BBC's annual Children in Need Charity appeal, and in 1985 he narrated an abridged novelization of the season twenty-one story \"Warriors of the Deep\" for BBC Worldwide's Doctor Who audio book series. In addition, he has appeared in a number of video dramas produced by Bill Baggs Video. In 2003 and 2004 he appeared as quiet and unassuming detective \"Dangerous Davies\" in The Last Detective (2003), the Meridian TV adaptations of Leslie Thomas's novels.\n\nOne of Britain's most recognizable (and most larger-than-life) character actors, Tom Baker is best known for his record-setting seven-year stint as the Fourth Doctor in Doctor Who (1963). He was born in 1934 in Liverpool, to Mary Jane (Fleming) and John Stewart Baker. His father was of English and Scottish descent, while his mother's family was originally from Ireland. Tom, along with his younger sister, Lulu, and younger brother, John, was raised in a poor Catholic community by his mother, a house-cleaner and barmaid, who was a devout Catholic, and his father, a sailor, who was rarely at home.\n\nAt age fifteen, Baker left school to become a monk with the Brothers of Ploermel on the island of Jersey. Six years later, he abandoned the monastic life and performed his National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps., where he became interested in acting. Baker then served on the Queen Mary for seven months as a sailor in the Merchant Navy before attending Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama in Kent, England, on scholarship.\n\nBaker acted in repertory theaters around Britain until the late 1960s when he joined up with the National Theatre, where he performed with such respected actors as Maggie Smith, Anthony Hopkins and Laurence Olivier, who helped him get his first prominent film role as Rasputin in Nikolaus und Alexandra (1971). His performance in this film earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations, one for best actor in a supporting role and another for best new star of the year. A couple of years earlier, Baker had made his theatrical film debut in The Winter's Tale (1967).\n\nDespite appearances in a spate of films, including Pasolinis tolldreiste Geschichten (1972), In der Schlinge des Teufels (1973), Sindbads gefährliche Abenteuer (1973) and Das Labor des Grauens - The Freakmaker (1974), Baker found himself in a career lull and working as a labourer at a building site. However, the BBC's Head of Serials, William Slater, who had directed Baker in BBC Play of the Month (1965), recommended him to producer Barry Letts, who was looking for a replacement for Jon Pertwee as the Fourth Doctor in Doctor Who (1963). Baker's performance in Sindbads gefährliche Abenteuer (1973) convinced Letts that he was right for it. It brought Baker international fame and popularity. He played the role for seven years, longer than any actor before or since.\n\nAfter leaving Doctor Who (1963) in 1981, Baker returned to theatre and made occasional television and film appearances, playing Sherlock Holmes in Der Hund von Baskerville (1982), Puddleglum in The Chronicles of Narnia story Der silberne Sessel (1990) and Hallvarth, Clan Leader of the Hunter Elves, in Dungeons & Dragons (2000).\n\nOne of stage, screen and TV's finest transatlantic talents, slight, gravel-voiced John Vincent Hurt was born on January 22, 1940, in Shirebrook, a coal mining village, in Derbyshire, England. The youngest child of Phyllis (Massey), an engineer and one-time actress, and Reverend Arnould Herbert Hurt, an Anglican clergyman and mathematician, his quiet shyness betrayed an early passion for acting. First enrolled at the Grimsby Art School and St. Martin's School of Art, his focus invariably turned from painting to acting.\n\nAccepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1960, John made his stage debut in \"Infanticide in the House of Fred Ginger\" followed by \"The Dwarfs.\" Elsewhere, he continued to build upon his 60's theatrical career with theatre roles in \"Chips with Everything\" at the Vaudeville, the title role in \"Hamp\" at the Edinburgh Festival, \"Inadmissible Evidence\" at Wyndham's and \"Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs\" at the Garrick. His movie debut occurred that same year with a supporting role in the \"angry young man\" British drama The Wild and the Willing (1962), followed by small roles in Appuntamento in Riviera (1962), Ein Mann zu jeder Jahreszeit (1966) and [link\n\nHurt found his more compelling early work in offbeat theatrical characterizations with notable roles such as Malcolm in \"Macbeth\" (1967), Octavius in \"Man and Superman\" (1969), Peter in \"Ride a Cock Horse\" (1972), Mike in '\"The Caretaker\" (1972) and Ben in \"The Dumb Waiter\" (1973). At the same time he gained more prominence in a spray of film and support roles such as a junior officer in Bevor der Winter kommt (1968), the title highwayman in Dave - zuhaus in allen Betten (1969), a morose little brother in In Search of Gregory (1969), a dim, murderous truck driver in John Christie, der Frauenwürger von London (1971), a skirt-chasing, penguin-studying biologist in Mr. Forbush and the Penguins (1971), the unappetizing son of a baron in Der Rattenfänger von Hameln (1972) and a repeat of his title stage role as Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1974).\n\nHurt shot to international stardom, however, on TV where he was allowed to display his true, fearless range. He reaped widespread acclaim for his embodiment of the tormented gay writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp in the landmark television play Wie man sein Leben lebt (1975), adapted from Crisp's autobiography. Hurt's bold, unabashed approach on the flamboyant and controversial gent who dared to be different was rewarded with the BAFTA (British TV Award). This triumph led to the equally fascinating success as the cruel and crazed Roman emperor Caligula in the epic television masterpiece Ich, Claudius, Kaiser & Gott (1976), followed by another compelling interpretation as murderous student Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment (1979).\n\nA resurgence occurred on film as a result. Among other unsurpassed portraits on his unique pallet, the chameleon in him displayed a polar side as the gentle, pathetically disfigured title role in Der Elefantenmensch (1980), and as a tortured Turkish prison inmate who befriends Brad Davis in the intense drama 12 Uhr nachts - Midnight Express (1978) earning Oscar nominations for both. Mainstream box-office films were offered as well as art films. He made the most of his role as a crew member whose body becomes host to an unearthly predator in Alien: Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt (1979). With this new rush of fame came a few misguided ventures as well that were generally unworthy of his talent. Such brilliant work as his steeple chase jockey in Sein größter Sieg (1984) or kidnapper in The Hit - Die Profi-Killer (1984) was occasionally offset by such drivel as the comedy misfire Zwei irre Typen auf heißer Spur (1982) with Ryan O'Neal in which Hurt looked enervated and embarrassed. For the most part, the craggy-faced actor continued to draw extraordinary notices. Tops on the list includes his prurient governmental gadfly who triggers the Christine Keeler political sex scandal in the aptly-titled Scandal (1989); the cultivated gay writer aroused and obsessed with struggling \"pretty-boy\" actor Jason Priestley in Leben und Tod auf Long Island (1997); and the Catholic priest embroiled in the Rwanda atrocities in Shooting Dogs (2005).\n\nLatter parts of memorable interpretations included Dr. Iannis in Corellis Mandoline (2001), the recurring role of the benign wand-maker Mr. Ollivander in Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen (2001) and Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010), the tyrannical dictator Adam Sutler in V wie Vendetta (2005) and the voice of The Dragon in Merlin - Die neuen Abenteuer (2008). Among Hurt's final film appearances were as a terminally ill screenwriter in That Good Night (2017) and a lesser role in the mystery thriller Die Damaskus Verschwörung - Spion zwischen den Fronten (2017). Hurt's voice was also tapped into animated features and documentaries, often serving as narrator. He also returned to the theatre performing in such shows as \"The Seagull\", \"A Month in the Country\" (1994), \"Afterplay\" (2002) and \"Krapp's Last Tape\", the latter for which he received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award.\n\nA recovered alcoholic who married four times, Hurt was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Queen in 2004, and Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in 2015. That same year (2015) he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In July of 2016, he was forced to bow out of the father role of Billy Rice in a then-upcoming London stage production of \"The Entertainer\" opposite Kenneth Branagh due to ill health that he described as an \"intestinal ailment\". Hurt died several months later at his home in Cromer, Norfolk, England on January 15, 2017, three days after his 77th birthday."
