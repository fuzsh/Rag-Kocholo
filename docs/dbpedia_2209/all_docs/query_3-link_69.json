        "text": "September 24, 2018\n\nThe book was very polar.\n\nOn one hand, the main thesis of the book is wonderful and liberating: putt based on your intuition and feel while have a sound technical base (e.g., green reading as foundation). You yourself will make you successful.\n\nOn another hand, the book was written and finalized in sloppy fashion especially on two fronts: 1st) The ‚Äùafterwords‚Äù in each chapter felt like commercials that were glued on top and added negative value to the experience as they took away from the main messages (e.g., Trackmann + Odyssey pieces); 2nd) The Kindle version page layout was not working (e.g., unformatted titles for sub-chapters).\n\nAs a final note, you get better experience by listening Karl Morris on ‚ÄùOn the Mark‚Äù PGA Tour podcast, published 22nd of August 2018. All the content without the extra‚Äôs that dilute the messages.\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nFascinating\n\nI heartily recommend this book to any golfer who is not happy with his/her putting results. The authors showed me what to focus on, how to manage myself and correctly channel my reactions to missed putts. Their two questions posed throughout the book are excellent thoughts to consider in the early stages of planning the journey the ball makes to the hole. Well done guys!\n\nAugust 29, 2018\n\nA great read - that makes a lot of sense\n\nI like the sectional approach building the themes / principles in a logical order. when put all together feels like a fantastic tool kit to have and flipped quite a bit of my thinking / approach to my putting on its head. I‚Äôm looking forward to starting putting them in to practice tomorrow. üòÄ\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\nExcellent book on putting!\n\nThis is the most wholistic book I have read on putting. It deals with the mental side, green reading, equipment, and practice. It doesn‚Äôt talk a lot about stroke because the authors believe the stroke is personal and less important to making putts. Great book!\n\nJuly 26, 2018\n\nA brilliant brilliant book\n\nQuite simply one of the best books I've ever read on golf. It will make you fall in love with putting. The importance of pace, breathing, visualisation, how to read a putt: it's all in here, but completely accessible. It's a masterpiece.\n\nMarch 10, 2020\n\nOne opinion\n\nWhile visualization is important before making the putt or any other stroke it‚Äôs absolutely imperative that the golfer understand where the face of the club is pointing. Without that element of control, visualization itself is useless.\n\nJune 29, 2020\n\nAs a scratch golfer I give it 3 stars as no earth shattering insights, It‚Äôs more a compilation of Karl Morris coaching. Although imaging the pace of the golf ball rolling into the hole has really helped my putt-Mark ratio!\n\nJuly 6, 2021\n\nGreat book for concepts in putting\n\nLoved the book. Gives great insights on the mental aspect of putting along with great pointers in what‚Äôs important when it comes to getting a putt to go into the hole.\n\nJanuary 16, 2022\n\nWords of Wisdom\n\nThe emphasis on emotions, visualization and\n\nright brain thinking in all aspects of golf has not only improved my score but more importantly my enjoyment of the game.\n\nJanuary 4, 2019\n\nGood read\n\nSome really nice ideas in this short book, there isn‚Äôt a load of padding in it either, I‚Äôll be trying 5-6 of them on the practice green later.\n\nOctober 16, 2019\n\nGreat, fresh perspective\n\nReally nice to have a new way of looking at putting, and remove a lot of the stress and tension that I have felt.\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nHow to putt by letting go and not getting in your own way\n\nFebruary 2, 2020\n\nSimple yet effective\n\nSome good insight on how to stay positive and a few simple & practical ideas to take onto the course\n\nMay 25, 2020\n\nBest book on putting!\n\nThis is an outstanding book. I went from a streaky putter with little confidence to now i putt with confidence. Highly recommend!\n\nJune 18, 2020\n\nGreat\n\nGreat book, interesting thoughts and techniques. Good for any golfer from screech to high ha i copes looking to help their game.\n\nJune 24, 2020\n\nThere's some good content from Gary and Karl but I thought they are shamelessly advertising certain products from companies like Trackman\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nGreat book on putting. Addresses the mental aspect of putting, as well as the art of finding the best line and pace and reading greens.\n\nJanuary 13, 2020\n\nA few good key ideas but a lot of data which is useless for the reader. Nevertheless it made a difference in my putting. Lots of publicity at the end of each chapter."
