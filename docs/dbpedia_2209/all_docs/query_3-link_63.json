        "text": "Optical Express has announced a new professional golf tour for male and female golfers and invited elite Scottish Amateurs. The first of the six Scottish events begin at Stranaer on 5 May 2011, with the events continuing until the December international final at Son Gual course in Mallorca.\n\nThe tour is the brain child of professional golfers Alan Tait and Nigel Scott-Smith who felt the lack of playing opportunities for golf professionals in Scotland, especially the younger, less experienced ones, was holding back the potential growth of some of Scotland’s most talented players. It’s fully supported by Optical Express and leading European golf professionals: Padraig Harrington, Retief Goosen, Paul Lawrie and Andrew Coltart.\n\nOptical Express Chairman and CEO, David Moulsdale said: “As soon as Alan and Nigel brought the idea to me I saw a new opportunity that will develop Scottish talent and wanted to get involved. I think it is important for there to be opportunities for enthusiastic male and female players in the Scottish calendar.”\n\nThere is a guaranteed minimum prize fund of £8,000 at each Scottish event and £10,000 in Mallorca for the season’s leading 24 players.\n\nPast Ryder Cup player Andrew Coltart comments: “I was lucky enough to be able to take advantage of an offer to go to America to develop my game where there were a lot more competitive golf events to keep me driven. Golf can be difficult, especially if things are not going great and it’s important to keep your focus. The addition of the Optical Express Pro Golf Tour to the Scottish golfing calendar will provide that added incentive to our golfers to stay driven and push them to get the most out of their game.”\n\nFormer US Open Champion Retief Goosen said: “The Optical Express Pro Golf Tour is a chance for aspiring professionals to gain valuable competitive tour experience as part of their ongoing development. Competing with glasses and contact lenses really affected my game and a fellow golfer suggested I consider laser eye surgery. The difference to my game has been phenomenal. I fully believe that the commitment to be the best from both professional golfers and Optical Express will combine to make the Optical Express Pro Golf Tour a truly memorable addition to the Scottish golf calendar.”\n\nPaul Lawrie, who won The Open Championship in 1999, said: “The whole ethos behind the Optical Express Pro Golf Tour is the continuing development of talented golfing professionals in Scotland, pure and simple. Although vital to the growth of any professional golfer in Scotland, it can be a costly business travelling to similar events in England or Europe and a lot of our golfing talent is unable to sustain this kind of expense. We need this tour to continue to produce world class golfers by giving our home grown golf professionals the opportunity to develop their competitive game, in Scotland.”\n\nOptical Express launched the tour to encourage new Scottish talent and highlight how everyone’s game can be improved with laser eye surgery and healthy eyesight. Golf is a sport where clear vision is vital, Optical Express provides their customers with vision correction through laser eye surgery, glasses, contact lenses and IOL treatments."
