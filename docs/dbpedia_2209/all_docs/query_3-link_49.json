        "text": "If you’ve been keeping up with the 2024 Summer Olympics, you’ve probably spotted a lot of Snoop Dogg. And it seems his Olympic appearance came with quite the payday.\n\nSnoop Dogg has become a major player in NBC’s coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics, delivering can’t-miss commentary and interviews throughout the summer games. Reportedly, he’s earning half a million dollars a day plus expenses. On Sunday (Aug. 4), Henry McNamara, a general partner at Great Oaks Venture Capital, shared a tweet that quickly went viral.\n\n“Sat next to an NBC exec at dinner, he said Snoop gets paid $500k a day plus expenses to be here promoting Olympics,” his post reads. “From Gin and Juice to a few million to be a celebrity at the Olympics – what a world.”\n\nThis news sparked a wide range of reactions on social media. Some people on X left comments such as, “Worth every penny,” and “He is worth 2X that amount. Snoop is America.”\n\nOne fan mentioned that “He’s going to be a coach on the upcoming season of The Voice, so NBC probably considers it marketing.”\n\nHowever, not everyone is impressed. “He didn’t make me want to watch,” one person commented. “Then they wonder why the host loses money on every Olympic Games,” another added.\n\nSnoop Dogg has had several viral moments during the games that have circulated on social media. Even before the Games began, X was buzzing when Snoop lit up the Olympic torch during the opening ceremonies.\n\nIn a video from the women’s gymnastics qualification on Sunday (July 28), Simone Biles noticed someone in the crowd and suddenly started dancing with her teammate Jordan Chiles. As the NBC announcers tried to make sense of the spontaneous dance break, the camera revealed Snoop Dogg sitting in the stands, sparking the impromptu dance party.\n\nSnoop also caught up with Michael Phelps to get some swimming tips from the 23-time gold medalist in a video shared by NBC Sports on Monday (July 29). “Now MP, how does one get fast in the pool?” Snoop asked. Phelps pointed out a few key factors: “Wingspan, lung power.”\n\nSnoop responded with a grin, saying, “You said wingspan, lung power — I definitely have lung power,” Snoop Dogg joked. “Our bodies are similar, Mike, we could be twins!”\n\nAccording to Front Office Sports, NBC is expected to generate $1.25 billion in ad revenue from airing the Olympic Games. If Snoop is indeed earning $500,000 a day, he stands to make $8 million for 16 days of coverage.\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
