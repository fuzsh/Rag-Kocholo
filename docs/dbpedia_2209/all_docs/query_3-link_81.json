        "text": "The Open Championship is a treasure trove of memories for Ryder Cup legend Paul Lawrie, especially recalling Jan van de Velde's infamous final-hole collapse.\n\nAs the golfers battled the elements during the opening round at Royal Troon on Thursday, Bob MacIntyre set his sights on becoming the first Scot to clinch The Open since Lawrie's legendary win in 1999. Hailing from Aberdeen, Lawrie was ten shots adrift as the last round kicked off.\n\nHe methodically narrowed the gap, piling the pressure on Van de Velde, who ultimately crumbled on Carnoustie's 18th. Van de Velde's hopes evaporated on the 72nd hole with a catastrophic triple-bogey, handing over the victory he had nearly grasped. The subsequent four-hole playoff saw Lawrie outshine both the Frenchman and American Justin Leonard.\n\nREAD MORE: Skip Bayless sends fresh retirement plea to Tiger Woods after The Open 'embarrassment'\n\nREAD MORE: Rory McIlroy shows true colors with reaction to missing The Open Championship cut\n\nWith birdies on the concluding two holes, Lawrie sealed the most remarkable turnaround in major tournament history and became the first Scotsman since Tommy Armour in 1931 to win The Open on home soil.\n\nIn a risky move that backfired, Van de Velde opted for a driver on the tee at the 72nd, leading to a sequence of mishaps and ultimately, the major title eluded him.\n\nReflecting on the fateful choice, Van de Velde remarked, \"I didn't go for glory. That wasn't something mad I was trying to do. But it came out a nightmare.\"\n\nVan de Velde's collapse is considered one of the most dramatic in golf history. On the 18th hole, he opted for a driver off the tee and then, instead of playing it safe, he decided to go for the green on his second shot.\n\nThe ball veered right, hit the grandstand railings, and bounced back 50 yards into thick rough. On his third stroke, Van de Velde - who was hoping to be the first French player since 1907 to win a major - mishit the ball into a water hazard due to the club getting caught in the rough.\n\nAfter taking a penalty drop, Van de Velde's fifth shot landed in a bunker near the green before he finally made it in for seven - a triple-bogey that gave Lawrie and Leonard a chance. The Scottish player seized the opportunity, securing his only major title."
