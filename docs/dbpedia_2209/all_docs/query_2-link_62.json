        "text": "Europe awoke this morning a little bleary-eyed wondering if it had all been a dream. Poulter performed, Kaymer was courageous and Seve was our saviour. Never before has a team performed with so much passion with the building of momentum with every shot. With so many fantastic moments contributing to Europe’s success it is a difficult to pick just a few – needless to say the highlight reel will be heavily weighted to Sunday.\n\n– Ryder Cup Talisman – a point from the front\n\nArguably the toughest and most important point for Europe to claim, Luke Donald’s victory over Bubba Watson in the singles was crucial to setting the tone of the day. If Donald lost this would’ve undoubtedly rippled back down to his following Europeans and perhaps all would’ve been lost.\n\n– The comeback kid (well man)\n\nPaul Lawrie has been a revelation in recent years, having found himself in the golfing wilderness, he struck form and secured his spot on the 2012 Ryder Cup team following his last appearance in the 1999 matches at Brookline. After an indifferent start to the 2012 event, Lawrie went on to an imperious victory against the form horse of world golf, Brandt Snedeker. His 5&3 win was another crucial point for Europe and was 5 from 5 in the first singles matches.\n\n– An English Rose blooms\n\nJustin Rose has a remarkable golfing pedigree, performing well above his age to achieve records across county, national and international golf before turning pro following a stunning showing at the Open Championship in Birkdale. Despite a few knocks along the way, he has blossomed into a steely competitor who performs time and time again at the highest echelons of world golf. His victory against USA’s most experienced Ryder Cup player, Phil Mickelson, with a birdie-birdie finish was one of the best on Sunday given the pressure of the occasion and the standard of golf being played – Mickelson would’ve no doubt walked off with a victory playing any other player on Sunday.\n\n– Poulter’s passion\n\nIan Poulter finished the 2012 Ryder Cup with 4 points from 4 to cement his position as one of the most impressive matchplay golfers of his generation. His performance with McIlroy to secure a vital point in Saturday’s fourballs including a 5-birdie finish (incidently he also birdied the 1st in the singles on Sunday), was without doubt one of the finest displays of performing under pressure that we are likely to experience. Wearing his heart on his sleeve, Poulter played with gusto and flair which many will now aspire to when walking on the fairways across the globe.\n\n– Producing under pressure – Kaymer\n\nWe have all been there, a sneaky breaking putt for the match, you look it up and down and make a stroke…whilst we might not always get the result we were after, Martin Kaymer produced the perfect putt under pressure which few can ever imagine. His putt never looked like missing and to perform such a shot under than pressure is without doubt one of the greatest moments in golf."
