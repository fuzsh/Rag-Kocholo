        "text": "Flavor Flav is taking his support for Olympians in Paris to the next level. Entertainment Weekly reported that he’s covered Olympian Veronica Fraley’s rent in full this month.\n\nThe discus thrower shared on X (formerly Twitter) that she was struggling to make the rent payment. “I compete in the Olympic Games TOMORROW and can’t even pay my rent,” she wrote. “My school only sent about 75% of my rent while they pay football players (who haven’t won anything [laughing emoji]) enough to buy new cars and houses [three thumbs down emojis].”\n\nAfter seeing her post, Flavor Flav wasted no time jumping in to help. “I gotchu,,, DM me and I’ll send payment TODAY so you don’t have to worry bout it TOMORROW,” he replied. “And imma be rooting for ya tomorrow LETZ GO,!!!”\n\nReddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian also joined the effort and paid Fraley’s rent for the rest of the year. He quickly teamed up with Flavor Flav, responding, “C’mon now! I’ll split it with @flavorfav.”\n\nFlavor Flav later shared a screenshot of what seems to be a transaction sent to Fraley at 6:18 p.m. “Man of word,” he captioned the image. “And Imma try and come by and support you in person tomorrow ,,, LMK what time.”\n\nOhanian also posted a screenshot of a $7,760 payment (his tech company is called Seven Seven Six, so that was a reference to his company) to Fraley with a description that simply said “MURICA.” He added, “Update! It is done.”\n\nIn another post, Fraley clarified that her frustration wasn’t with her school but with the “rules that bar me from making the amount I’m WORTH as a collegiate athlete such as NIL which favors popularity over performance.” She continued, “That’s all I’m sayin. Wish me luck tm!”\n\nFraley isn’t the only Team USA athlete that Flavor Flav has backed during these Olympics. Last month, the USA Water Polo announced that he had signed a five-year sponsorship deal with the Women’s and Men’s national water polo teams and would serve as their official hype man.\n\nAs part of the deal, Flavor Flav has made an undisclosed financial contribution to the 2024 USA Women’s Water Polo Olympic Team, according to the release. He’s also set to make appearances throughout the year at Water Polo events and collaborate with the teams on social media.\n\n“Supporting USA Water Polo teams is an honor,” Flavor Flav said in the release. “As a girl dad and a champion of all sports, I’m excited to bring my energy and voice to this incredible sport. Niche sports often don’t get the spotlight they deserve, but they are packed with incredible talent and heart. Together, we’re going to make some serious waves!”\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
