        "text": "Scotland's Paul Lawrie begins the day 10 shots off the lead and finishes it 22 holes later with a British Open crown.\n\nThe cruelty of Carnoustie yielded to craziness at the end.\n\nThe Scottish gallery sat in stunned silence as the greatest collapse in golf unfolded before their eyes. A little more than an hour later, they sang and swayed, celebrating the greatest comeback in major-championship history by one of their own.\n\nPaul Lawrie became the first Scotsman since Tommy Armour in 1931 to win the Claret Jug on his native soil, an unremarkable champion in an unforgettable British Open.\n\n\"It's a huge thing to win an Open, no matter where it is, Lawrie said. \"But obviously here it is extra special being so close to home.\"\n\nIt was a horror story for Jean Van de Velde, the Frenchman who wanted to win in style and wound up losing in a shocking display of self-destruction.\n\n\"Don't be sad,\" he said. \"I made plenty of friends because a Scottish man won. At least that's something.\"\n\nAfter a week of whipping winds and bitter complaints about the harshness of Carnoustie Golf Links, Lawrie won the 128th Open in a four-hole playoff over Van de Velde and Justin Leonard with birdies on the last two holes.\n\nLawrie started the final round 10 strokes out of the lead. More than an hour after he had finished, he stood on the practice green as Van de Velde marched to the 18th tee with a three-stroke lead. His only hope was the nuance of British golf.\n\n\"Strange things happen, especially around here,\" he said.\n\nNeeding only double bogey on the final hole to become the first Frenchman in 92 years to win the British Open, Van de Velde made triple bogey and sneaked into the playoff.\n\n\"I thought \"No way,' \" Lawrie said when asked if he ever imagined a playoff. \"Incredible.\"\n\nThe biggest comeback in a major until Sunday was by Jackie Burke Jr., who was eight strokes behind amateur Ken Venturi in the 1956 Masters. Van de Velde was no amateur. The 33-year-old just played like one on the final hole when he tried to be a hero and lost a chance to be a champion.\n\n\"Maybe next time I'll hit the wedge,\" he said. \"And maybe you will all forgive me.\"\n\nLeonard, the 1997 Open champion, made bogey out of Barry's Burn on the 72nd hole and thought he lost his chance to win. He hit into the same brook, made the same score and knew he lost it the second time around in a playoff.\n\n\"I certainly figured out that Paul was Scottish,\" Leonard said.\n\nAs for Van de Velde, he was the first player to lose a five-stroke lead in the final round of an Open since Jose Jurado at Carnoustie in 1931.\n\nLawrie, par over the playoff holes, closed with 4-under 67, tied for the best score of the tournament on the toughest links golf course in the world.\n\nThat put him at 290, the first time over par has won an Open in 14 years. Leonard had 72, and Van de Velde staggered home to 77.\n\nNot since John Daly won the PGA Championship in 1991 had a player come out of nowhere to win a major championship. Lawrie has won twice on the European PGA Tour, including the Qatar Masters, but he was a mere 159th in the world. Daly was 168th when he won at Crooked Stick.\n\nLawrie became the first qualifier to win the Open since it started giving exemptions in 1963. Before that, everyone _ even Ben Hogan _ had to qualify.\n\nThe last Scotsman to win the British Open was Sandy Lyle, who did it in 1985.\n\nLawrie becomes an exception to the established champions Carnoustie has produced _ Armour, Henry Cotton, Hogan, Gary Player and Tom Watson.\n\nHolding the Claret Jug as darkness and rain fell around the 18th green, Lawrie, who grew up about an hour's drive from Carnoustie, thanked his wife and \"everyone who knows me _ which is a lot of you now.\n\n\"I wasn't wishing ill on Jean, but he obviously made a couple of mistakes coming in and I played lovely in the playoff,\" Lawrie said. \"To birdie the last two holes in the playoff and to win here obviously is a fairy story.\"\n\nEveryone is more likely to remember Van de Velde.\n\n\"There are worse things in life,\" he said. \"Some terrible things are happening to other people. This is only a golf tournament. Yes, I blew it on 18. All it proves is I was capable of being three ahead of the best players in the world on 18.\"\n\nFor a while, it looked like Leonard and Lawrie were affected by their improbable playoff. Both missed the first two greens, both took bogey. Lawrie separated himself with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th.\n\n\"(The playoff) was just a circus,\" Lawrie said. \"Everyone was inside the ropes and everyone was shouting out your name. It is really hard to focus on one shot at a time.\"\n\nLeonard and Lawrie were in the fairway on No. 18, but Leonard hit first and came up short into the brook for the second time. Lawrie hit to 3 feet and became perhaps the most undistinguished Open champion in its 139-year history.\n\n\"I lost the British Open twice in one day, which is twice as hard to take,\" Leonard said.\n\nBut ...\n\n\"As bad as I feel, he feels worse,\" Leonard said, referring to Van de Velde. \"That's tough to go through.\"\n\nThe winning score must have been equally difficult for Tiger Woods. Ultimately, all he needed was 1-under 70 to get into the playoff, not too much to ask on a relatively tranquil day at Carnoustie.\n\nWoods followed 11 straight pars with double bogey. He finally ended his 35-hole birdie drought on the par-5 14th, but it was much too late. A bogey at the 18th gave him 74 for 294, and a tie for seventh with Davis Love III (69) and David Frost (74).\n\nAngel Cabrera (70) and Craig Parry (73) finished one stroke out of the playoff at 291. Parry led with seven holes to play but made triple bogey on No. 12.\n\nGreg Norman had 72 and finished sixth, giving him 15 top 10s in the majors this decade _ but only one title.\n\nU.S. Open champion Payne Stewart and David Duval were among the 44 who failed to break 300, the score some thought might be a winner at the beginning of last week.\n\nLost in the hysteria of the final hole was a brilliant putting display by Van de Velde. Asked on the eve of the final round whether his putter was unusual, Van de Velde replied, \"Yes. Because they go in.\"\n\nDid they ever.\n\nHis final putt gave him 101 putts for the tournament.\n\nWHO IS\n\nPAUL LAWRIE?\n\nBORN: Jan. 1, 1969.\n\nRESIDENCE: Aberdeen, Scotland.\n\nPERSONAL: Married wife Marian in 1991; son Craig Robert was born in 1995.\n\nCAREER: Worked as an assistant under the late Doug Smart at Banchory, near Aberdeen, after leaving school at 17.
