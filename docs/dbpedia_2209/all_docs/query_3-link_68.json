        "text": "CLAN Cancer Support patron Paul Lawrie is preparing to welcome the charity to the world of professional golf as the countdown continues to the European Tour’s newest event.\n\nThe Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Matchplay championship takes place at Murcar Links from July 30 to August 2.\n\nAs part of the host’s commitment to north-east charities, CLAN has been invited to attend the tournament and will have a team of representatives raising funds and awareness throughout the competition.\n\nSusan Crighton, CLAN’s fundraising manager, said: “We can’t thank Paul enough for inviting us to be part of the event and we’re looking forward to being at Murcar. Our team will be taking along the Mini which we are raffling this year and that always draws a lot of attention.\n\n“Paul has always been a great support to CLAN and became a patron in recent years in recognition of the work he has done on our behalf. This is another great example of that relationship and we are delighted to be involved.”\n\nLarge crowds are expected at Murcar Links for the European Tour event, which is part of the prestigious Race to Dubai.\n\nPaul Lawrie said: “I’m proud to be bringing the event to the north-east and pleased that the tournament will be helping a number of charities. In addition to CLAN’s welcome presence, Befriend a Child and the Paul Lawrie Foundation are the official charities of the event and I’m sure all of those represented will receive generous support from those who attend.\n\n“CLAN does fantastic work throughout the areas it serves, from Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire up to Shetland and Orkney. It is an honour to serve as a patron.”\n\nThe Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Matchplay event is not CLAN’s only golfing venture of the summer. The CNR International Young Pro-Am will take place at Insch Golf Club on Friday, August 21, and will see 18 teams battle it out in the 18-hole tournament.\n\nThe event, which will raise funds for CLAN and Insch Golf Club, will see teams of three partnered with a PGA Young Professional with prizes for nearest the pin and longest drive on the day also on offer. Teams of three for the day cost £375. For more information or to register a team, please contact Steph Dowling on 01224 647000 or email steph.dowling@clanhouse.org.\n\nCLAN Cancer Support is an independent charity which provides comfort support and information, free of charge, for anyone, of any age, affected by any type of cancer.
