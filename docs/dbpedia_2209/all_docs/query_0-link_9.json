        "text": "Introduction\n\nAberdonian Paul Lawrie was considered to be just another very promising professional until the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie.\n\nHe burnt up the course on the last day coming from 10 strokes behind to catch the leaders.\n\nHe forced a play-off against Justin Leonard and Frenchman Jean Van de Velde, who'd bombed earlier out when his ball went in a ditch.\n\nLawrie was immediately propelled into the elite band of golfers that have claimed golf's oldest major championship.\n\nThe Scotsman has been a professional golfer since he was 17 years-old.\n\nAnd his famous win shows, hard work and dedication to your sport will eventually pay off."
