        "text": "If you’re like me, you’ve been watching the 2024 Paris Olympics and marveling at all of the talent. I’m also in awe of the surfers. Watching the surfing competition in Tahiti makes me want to go to Tahiti, so I decided to do some research into what it takes to get there and what to know before you go. The area looks absolutely stunning and like a paradise.\n\nWhat to Know if You Want to Go to Tahiti\n\nTahiti, part of French Polynesia, is to the south of Hawaii, located between California and Australia. It’s also in the same time zone as Hawaii. “The destination also known as The Islands of Tahiti is spread over a surface as big as Europe and consists of 118 islands, of which 76 are inhabited,” according to Tahititourisme.com. They add that the Islands of Tahiti consist of the Society Islands, the Tuamotu Islands, the Gambier Islands, the Marquesas Islands and the Austral Islands.\n\nSo, how do you get to Tahiti? It’s not close to the U.S. If you look at Tahiti on a map, it literally looks like it’s in the middle of the ocean. That makes me want to go even more. But, a good number of airlines fly to French Polynesia from various major cities, including Los Angeles, Paris, Seattle, San Francisco, Honolulu, Tokyo, Auchland and Rarotonga. International flights that come into French Polynesia land at Tahiti-Faa’a International Airport (PPT). The area also has two domestic airlines: Air Tahiti and Air Moana.’\n\nHow long it takes to get to Tahiti obviously depends on from where you’re traveling. For example, from Seattle, it’s 10 hours to Papeete, but from Paris, it’s 22 hours. I looked at how far is it from Detroit, and it’s about 16 hours. It must be so long because it involves multiple flights. Once you’re there, “you can get a taxi to your accommodations from Tahiti-Faa’a International Airport, or you can arrange to be collected on arrival with your travel agent or accommodations.” If you want to go to the other islands, you’ll have to snag a domestic flight. As for where to stay, many people opt to enjoy the French Polynesian resorts, which Reneeroaming.com says “usually have everything a visitor would need including restaurants, tour options, a pool, shuttles to/from the airport, etc. In fact, a great place to look for a resort is TripAdvisor as you will be able to see reviews, prices, availability, etc.”\n\nRemember that you have to get a passport to go to Tahiti, since it’s part of French Polynesia. If you have any tips on how to go to Tahiti, please contact me and let me know. It’s on my bucket-list of places to visit one day.\n\nAnne Erickson started her radio career shortly after graduating from Michigan State University and has worked on-air in Detroit, Flint, Toledo, Lansing and beyond.
