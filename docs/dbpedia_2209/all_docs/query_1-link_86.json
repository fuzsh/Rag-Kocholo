        "text": "Through a salty film of tears Paul Lawrie looked back on a glorious career while warm words of praise from golf’s greatest legend filled the room.\n\nAnd filled his heart with pride.\n\nThirty one years ago the 17-year-old kid from Kemnay, Aberdeenshire, could never have imagined such a scene when he turned professional playing off a handicap of four.\n\nThat one day there he’d be standing on a stage in front of 600 people in a Glasgow hotel, looking awe-struck at the massive screens above him as the great - no, make that The Greatest - Jack Nicklaus told him exactly why he should be darned proud of himself.\n\nIt would have been special enough surely had the video tributes stopped at Sir Alex Ferguson, the most iconic manager in the history of his beloved Aberdeen Football Club.\n\nBut Nicklaus? The man who within a fortnight of Lawrie turning pro was knocking off his 18th and last Major title at the 1986 Masters in what is still celebrated among the best loved moments in golf history?\n\nIf you can judge a man by the company he keeps then those messages of goodwill, as Lawrie accepted a Lifetime Achievement award at the Sunday Mail sportscotland Scottish Sports Awards, speaks volumes about his standing among the pantheon of sporting heroes.\n\nYet it could have been so different were it not for one Sliding Doors moment that thankfully didn’t slam shut in front of his face.\n\nIt was in 1995 when Lawrie and his wife Marian had just become parents for the first time but their joy in the home was not matched by much happiness on the golf course that season\n\nStruggling in his fourth season on the European Tour and well down the order of merit with a handful of events remaining, the stark reality began to loom large. If he lost his card he’d need to consider packing it all in and getting “a real job.”\n\nDespite being luckier than most young pros to have the backing of fantastic sponsors from his home city, the financial pressures of feeding and sheltering a young family would almost certainly force him to confront some tough decisions.\n\nBut just as the going got tough, Lawrie got going and produced a typically steely, determined response that salvaged the situation. From there on the rest is a history celebrated in lavish style last Thursday night in Glasgow’s Double Tree by Hilton Hotel.\n\nLawrie said: “We’d just had Craig, our first born, and I was really struggling with my game.\n\n“I was way down the order of merit but we’d moved to a nice house and things were pretty tight.\n\n“I did think at the time if I lose my card what am I going to do? Marian and I spoke about whether I would pack it in and have to sell the house. It was a worrying time.\n\n“But then I had two top 10s in my last three events to finish something like 107th out of the 115 places that automatically keep their card. So it was a proper rescue job.\n\n“What would have happened if I’d lost my card? I honestly don’t know, but I knuckled down over that winter after that scare.\n\n“I came out and won my first Tour event the following March 1996 and then I was off and running. I never felt that way again.\n\n“I know how lucky I am to be doing the job I have and earning a good living - but you appreciate it all the more when you’ve come through a spell like that where you think ‘oh my God that was nearly taken away from me. What I’ve always wanted to do was nearly taken aw\n\n“To then kick on to win the Open and play two Ryder Cups it makes you thankful when look back and think ‘man, I nearly never had the chance to do all that.”\n\nBut what would he have done? Gone back to where it all began as an assistant professional at Banchory Golf Club, hoovering the pro shop and selling Mars bars to the members? Probably\n\nAnd, despite the glamour and globe trotting adventures he has enjoyed on tour, he insists that humble existence would have suited him just fine because the harsh truth is that he never expected anything more.\n\nHe added: “I could have gone back to being a PGA pro. The reason I went through my PGA training in th first place was because I couldn’t do anything else at the time, I wasn’t good enough to play.\n\n“So I always had that qualification behind me and I’ve always said if that was going to be my life I would have been more than happy being a PGA pro - because that’s what I thought it was going to be anyway.\n\n“I never thought I’d be on tour, I never thought I’d be good enough, so all of that was a bonu\n\n“If it was taken away I’m not sure it would have been the disaster that you might think. I would have quite happily been a PGA pro for the rest of my life, no problem at all.”\n\nBut fate had plotted a much bigger path for Lawrie, leading him to the crowning glory of the Open Championship triumph at Carnoustie in 1999, seven other European Tour titles and two Ryder Cups.\n\nThe tantalising prospect of adding further success to that list beckons when his 50th birthday in just over a year’s time opens the door to the seniors tour.\n\nBut were it to stop right now he already has a CV to be proud of, not to mention the priceless work of his junior golf foundation that has given more than 25,000 kids in the north east of Scotland the opportunity to take up the sport.\n\nThat earned special praise from Nicklaus in his message, but on a night where hundreds got on their feet to honour him, Lawrie humbly sought to share the plaudits with the four pillars on which his illustrious career was built.\n\nHe added: “Within the space of a year I met four people who have been the biggest influence on what I’ve done and how I’ve done it.\n\n“The first is Marian, obviously. Another is Stewart Spence - the businessman who by sheer chance got in the back of my dad’s taxi in Aberdeen and, after hearing him talk about his son the golfer, became a sponsor and tireless supporter for the rest of my career.\n\n“Then there’s a guy called Colin Fraser - a fish merchant who was my first ever sponsor and still one of my best mates to this day.\n\n“It was actually Colin who nicknamed me Chippy. I would regularly hit only five or six greens in 18 holes but still shoot one-under because my short game was mustard.\n\n“So one night we were out playing at Banchory together and I played terrible from tee to green and he said ‘all you do is chip, I’m just going to call you Chippy.’ The nickname has stuck ever since.\n\n“And of course the fourth person was Adam Hunter.\n\n“Before he became my coach he was a pro too and of the Scots boys on tour he was always the fun one. The one who if he missed the cut would hang around for a drink on the Friday night and not go home til the Saturday.\n\n“I’ll never forget the night we were all stuck in Heathrow airport so we were sitting in the bar and there’s a piano over in the corner. After a few drinks Adam said ‘I’ll go over and give you a song, I’ll give you Great Balls of Fire’.\n\n“So we’re all thinking ‘jeez, I didn’t know the wee man can play the piano.’ Of course he couldn’t play a note.\n\n“Well he got up and just started banging this thing, his feet were up on it and everything. Brilliant fun.\n\n“When I hooked up with Adam as my coach the main reason he came out with me on tour as much as he did wasn’t to coach me, it was because he was great to be around. I was going to America quite a lot, I didn’t know anybody over there so to go for dinner with him and spend time with him was great as opposed to the coaching side of it.\n\n“It’s not great to be coached at tournaments, that’s work you put in at home. So he was a travelling companion more than anything else on competitive weeks.”\n\nIt was at Carnoustie where the influence of Hunter - tragically lost to leukaemia in 2011 - most famously came to the fore.\n\nUshering his client to go warm up on the practice range while the rest of the world watched stunned as Open leader Jean Van de Velde imploded on the 72nd hole, by the time it got to the play-off Lawrie was in the zone.\n\nReady to wrap his hands around the Claret Jug with a stunning approach to the 18th green that closed out victory. One majestic sweep of his four iron from 221 yards out lasered his ball over the fearsome Barry Burn to rest just four feet from the hole.\n\nIt’s the iconic shot that compelled Nicklaus to seek him out at the USPGA three weeks later to compliment Lawrie on one of the best shots he had ever seen executed under pressure. Again, Nicklaus made a point of highlighting that in his touching message on Thursday.\n\nHigh praise indeed when it’s coming from the guy who knows more than anyone what it takes to close out a Major victory.\n\nRespect from his peers means a great deal to any sportsman, but when it comes from the man who towers head and shoulders above the rest? No wonder the emotions poured out on a special night when Scotland stood to honour one of its best."
