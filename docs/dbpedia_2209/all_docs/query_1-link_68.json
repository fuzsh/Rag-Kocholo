        "text": "Paul Lawrie played through an emotional pain barrier after the death of Adam Hunter, the man who coached him to victory in golf’s oldest Major the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie.\n\nHunter, who was just 48 years old, passed away on Friday night after losing his battle with leukaemia.\n\nRather than return home to comfort Hunter’s wife, Caroline he was encouaged by her to ‘play as hard as he could’ in Portugal where he carded a third round 69 to move to 12-under par in the Portugal Masters.\n\n“It wasn’t easy out there today but it wasn’t as hard for me as it was for Caroline and their two girls as they are going to have a terrible time for a while which is very sad,” said Lawrie.\n\n“Caroline remarked that I should go out and play as hard as I could for him.”\n\nPlayers will have the opportunity to wear black ribbons on the final day in Portugal as a mark of respect for Hunter.\n\nLawrie first began working with Hunter at the end of 1998 when Hunter lost his European Tour card in finishing 139th on the money list.\n\nBut rather than try to regain his card at the Tour’s Q-School, Hunter contacted Lawrie outlining how he could improve his game.\n\nLawrie agreed to work with Hunter and within three months the Aberdonian captured his second European Tour title in winning the 1999 Qatar Masters in Doha.\n\nSix months later Lawrie sang Hunter’s praise when he became the first Scot in 68 years ito win the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie.\n\nThe following article was written by colleague Martin Dempster of the Scotsman and was placed on the European Tour website – www.europeantour.com\n\nHunter died in the Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow where he was visited earlier in the week by Douglas Connon, chairman of the Scottish Golf Union.\n\nJust under a year ago, Hunter was appointed as the head coach of the Scottish Under-16s by the SGU, having spent six years prior to that as a Scottish Golf Academy coach.\n\nLast night Connon paid tribute to Hunter, saying: “Adam was a consistent and straight man who set us all an example by his personal behaviour and how to live life. I am heartbroken as he was my friend. Our thoughts are with his lovely, caring wife Caroline and his family.”\n\nNews of Hunter’s death was broken to Lawrie after he had just finished his second round in the Portugal Masters.\n\nHe said: “I have said many times over the years Adam Hunter was magnificent for me right from the first day we hooked up together way back in 1998.\n\n“His work rate and dedication to my golf was unbelievable. He was always there for me and I will miss him so much.\n\n“It would be impossible to tell you how much he meant to me. Nothing was too much trouble. He travelled with me for months after The Open in 1999 as much as my mate as coach. I learned so much from him.”\n\nHunter, who beat Open champion Darren Clarke in play-off to win the 1995 Portuguese Open at Penha Longa, started to feel unwell with an ear ache at the end of 2009 and was subsequently diagnosed with leukaemia.\n\nDespite the illness, he remained devoted to his job and was still sending emails from his hospital bed over the past few weeks.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, he played for Scotland at boys’ and youths’ level before heading to America, where he had a spell at Virginia College.\n\nAfter turning professional in 1984, he cut his teeth on the Tartan Tour, winning the Northern Open at Royal Aberdeen in 1987, when he was attached to Sandyhills.\n\nOn the European Tour, he failed to hold on to his card as a rookie in 1985 but went back to the Qualifying School and secured his card again.\n\nHe then lost it again and didn’t return until 1990, after which he produced a string of consistent performances, culminating in his victory over Clarke in Portugal. that helped him finish a career-best 63rd on the European Tour Order of Merit.\n\nAfter coming off the Tour, Hunter quickly established a reputation as a top coach, enjoying his finest hour in the company of Lawrie at Carnoustie 12 years ago.\n\nHunter established his own Golf School at Newton Mearns on the outside of Glasgow but used Kingsfield near Linlithgow more recently to work with Lawrie and his other pupils.\n\nGeorge O’Grady, Chief Executive of The European Tour, added: “It is desperately sad to lose, at such a young age, a great European Tour Member and Champion as well as an inspirational coach. We will remember the exceptional and brave example that Adam set to us all.”"
