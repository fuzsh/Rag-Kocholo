        "text": "Summary:\n\nMy current SSHRC (Insight Grant) funded project The Color of Hours: Race, Time and the Making of Urban America links African American, Labour and Urban histories to the emerging field of time studies to chart the temporal geographies of race in postwar Detroit. Time –much like race- possesses an ostensible ‘naturalism’ which often obscures the various historical factors which went into its making. How peoples and societies choose to mark time –via the rhythms of nature or the rigidity of the clock- varies across historical contexts. My research asks if time is indeed relative –as something born of specific historical contingencies- than how do different peoples experience time differently? Moreover, how does the experience of time create racial inequality within cities? Time and race intersected to shape the landscape of postwar Detroit in a number of ways: from vagrancy statues to curfews, time work management and transit. Positing time as a past, present and future agent of racial identity, reveals new insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban race relations from the assembly line to the city streets. This project draws on a myriad of primary sources from transit schedules, curfew/vagrancy statutes, municipal housing authorities and industrial management literature to define the temporal geographies of race in postwar Detroit.\n\nProject Type: Funded\n\nFunders:\n\nSSHRC"
