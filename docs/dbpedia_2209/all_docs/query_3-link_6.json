        "text": "From Carson to Paris: The Olympic Journey of Rugby Player Marcus Tupuola\n\nIn Paris, I interviewed Marcus Tupuola, a 28-year-old rugby player from Carson, California, who made his Olympic debut for the USA men’s rugby team this year. Marcus, a Notre Dame alum, started playing rugby at the young age of 13 and has been dedicated to the sport ever since.\n\nWhen I asked Marcus about how it felt to make his Olympic debut, he described it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience that exceeded all of his expectations. “I’ve been working towards this for my whole life, so it’s the fruits of my labors being here now,” he told me with a smile.\n\nMarcus explained that his journey to the world stage began when he committed to playing rugby at Notre Dame. It was then that he knew he had to dedicate himself fully to the sport in order to reach his ultimate goal of competing in the Olympics. “When I was 17 or 18, that’s when I decided: I can do this,” he said. He admitted that the road to the Olympics wasn’t easy and often felt like “a lonely path.” He had to rid himself of distractions and stay focused on his ultimate goal of turning his passion into a career. But, ten years later, at 28, he was finally achieving his dream.\n\nMarcus shared with me his love for the Olympic experience for athletes. He proudly displayed pins from different countries on his bag, given to him by athletes staying in the Olympic village with him. “It’s a small circle.” “It’s good to see other countries and other teams so we just chat and talk and build more bonds and relationships.” To me, his experience shows how friendships can exist among athletes from all around the world, even at the highest level of competition.\n\nWhen I asked Marcus about the success of the women’s rugby team, he was full of praise. “It’s good for them to show the world what they’ve been working on,” he said. “We train at the same facility day in and day out, so I get to see what they’re trying to put forward, especially in women’s awareness in sports. It didn’t happen overnight, but they did it.”\n\nWith his team having completed the competition, Marcus said he looks forward to exploring the city. “I’m in Paris, so I’m just having fun right now, and just enjoying myself and my time here.” He also plans to attend other events during the next few days."
