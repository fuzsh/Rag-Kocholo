Now the Legends Tour moves to Italy, to the Argentario Golf & Wellness Resort in Porto Ercole, where the Italian Senior Open will be staged from 14 to 16 October.

For Scotsman Paul Lawrie, this is his third career success on the circuit, his second this season, which adds to a rich palmar√®s, which also includes the 1999 Open Championship. Paul Lawrie (born 1 January 1969 in Aberdeen) is a Scottish European Tour professional golfer.

He briefly gained worldwide attention with his Major win at the Open Championship in 1999. Lawrie joined the European Tour in 1992 and for the first few years played unobtrusively but well enough to hold his own. His first tournament victory came in 1996 in Spain and in the 1999 season his hour came.

First winning the prestigious Qatar Masters and then the absolute pinnacle of his career at Carnoustie in July. After a splendid final round, Lawrie was able to qualify for a necessary play-off over 4 holes for the Open Championship and won the Claret Jug against his comrades-in-arms Jean Van de Velde (France) and Justin Leonard from the USA.

Going into the finals day, Lawrie was 10 shots down, the widest by any eventual majors winner. However, he also benefited from serious mistakes by Van de Velde, because the Frenchman had previously lost a lead of three strokes at the last hole and only then made the play-off necessary.

After that, Lawrie's game got a boost, but not enough for absolute world class. He tried unsuccessfully on the North American PGA Tour - which he had to leave again in 2004 - and then struggled with his form for a few years before having two tournament successes in 2011 and 2012 before disappearing again.
