He was strongly influenced both by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and by composers of the Italian Baroque. In turn, Handel's music forms one of the peaks of the \"high baroque\" style, bringing Italian opera to its highest development, creating the genres of English oratorio and organ concerto, and introducing a new style into English church music. He is consistently recognized as one of the greatest composers of his age.\n\nEdmund Husserl\n\nBorn in\n\nCzech Republic\n\nYears\n\n1859-1938 (aged 79)\n\nOccupations\n\nuniversity teacherphilosophermathematician\n\nBiography\n\nEdmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl was an Austrian-German philosopher and mathematician who established the school of phenomenology.\n\nGeorg Cantor\n\nBorn in\n\nRussia\n\nYears\n\n1845-1918 (aged 73)\n\nOccupations\n\nuniversity teacherphilosophermathematician\n\nBiography\n\nGeorg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor was a mathematician who played a pivotal role in the creation of set theory, which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics.
