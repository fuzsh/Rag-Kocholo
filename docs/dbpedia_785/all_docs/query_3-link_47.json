        "text": "By Wong May\n\nLike all great rivers\n\nThe Elbe is familiar at first sight.\n\nThe barges\n\nspic & span as the front parlors\n\nOf model homes in Saxony —\n\nThe steam paddle-wheelers & other\n\nvessels,\n\nNo less impeccable — all run\n\nWith a near soporific efficiency.\n\nYou lean out\n\n& the land starts up:\n\nThe parcels of pastures & castles\n\nBearing with them trees & cows & cattle-grids\n\nthe crowned heads of daisies\n\nLittle knots of human habitations,\n\nCigarette factory & garrisons\n\nFloodplains, sheet pilings\n\nRun\n\nAll run,\n\nAs if by an engine,\n\nSome cement breaker from under the river\n\ntorn turfs all\n\nBob up & down,\n\nBrown\n\nlike bears in bear gardens\n\nThe cupolas, cavaliers\n\nTheir ruinous sandstone reflections alongside.\n\nWhether this is the famous effect\n\nOf the Balcony of Europe\n\nCork coasters chasing gilt coronets\n\nMaps loosely adrift on a map\n\nSo many teacups clicking,\n\nLarge balconies colliding\n\nBreaking up into smaller ones\n\nValley & vineyards\n\nMines, bridges, sugar-beet fields, villas,\n\nMuseum corridors\n\nA Procession of Princes\n\nChimera of Chinese porcelain palaces\n\nCargoes of homeland & meadows,\n\nOther\n\nMunicipalities, the beer & beer mats,\n\nCoal, forestry,\n\nHistory atop Geography atop History\n\nFlags roll unroll — coalesce\n\nBlack — red — yellow\n\nYellow Black\n\nRed\n\nRuns\n\nWhite\n\nSunk trains with passengers\n\nTrains sunk\n\nApril ’45 Bergen-Belsen\n\nRun Elbe Run\n\nI pulled away.\n\nI have come this day to the bank of the Elbe\n\nTo write a few postcards\n\nIn a tearoom.\n\nOn the steps up\n\nFrom street level to the Old Albertinum Museum\n\nsome way from the tearoom\n\nA man too is minding his business\n\nOn his lap a glass case\n\nFor keyboard\n\n2 rows of colored sand in test tubes\n\nRaspberry /burnt sienna /turquoise /Prussian blue /lavender /ochre\n\nOr neutral — just sand.\n\nInto a beer bottle he tips a little color\n\n& before you know\n\nOur man has tossed one up in the air like a baby\n\n& caught it roundly by the heels too,\n\nLe voilà, not one grain escapes\n\nIt is shockproof, waterproof,\n\nA world like a Swiss watch,\n\n& time-proof —\n\nYou count three camels\n\nIt looks like 4, — any number could have been packed in the bottle\n\nWhich, when turned slowly in the palm\n\nAn orderly procession,\n\n: Camels against a horizon of low sun\n\nAn irradiated sky,\n\nPalm tree, undulating dunes\n\nA strata of deep watermelon subsiding to honey halva\n\nThe silhouette of a tent, hint of\n\nA sandstorm in the air.\n\nGrit under eyelids\n\n& should you prefer\n\nFrom the array of bottles you could take home one with\n\nA full sun, an Egyptian sun-disk\n\n& you have his word, — no fear,\n\neach hermetically sealed,\n\nWill travel.\n\nAs if to say not all the grains\n\nAre sand, our man also works\n\nWith rice.\n\nHe’s a jeweler.\n\nHe will encrypt\n\nOn a grain of rice\n\na word,\n\nEnclosed in a colored phial of water\n\nagain hermetically\n\nFor all time\n\nLike the camels.\n\nA jewel, he said,\n\nThe word\n\na ruby, an emerald\n\nOf water\n\nShould you forget, here his English broke off\n\nBut you understand\n\nYes, there is closure.\n\nAs I watched, a lady at my elbow\n\nLike one at a séance, asked\n\nFor the name “Christine,” her grand daughter, she said.\n\n& he, our scribe, answered he was from Iran,\n\n— not that anyone inquired.\n\nIranian, then\n\n— Hence the camels\n\nThough here in Dresden\n\nHe had looked Mexican\n\nA second before.\n\nI looked again & saw that he could be from anywhere,\n\nIt depends on where you stand.\n\nThis man has for good or ill\n\nthe face of the world,\n\nWhich he bears sadly\n\nWith some mirth.\n\nI pulled away.\n\nAnother moment I would have\n\nTo come up with a name, a word,\n\nAnother world.\n\nI was happy with my purchase of camels\n\nOn the Elbe.\n\nBack home it holds Dresden & the Elbe for me in a bottle.\n\nIt runs\n\nfor so long as anyone would care to look,\n\nNot a drop more.\n\nI would have liked to write a card to the bottler\n\nAddressing sands\n\nsands of the world thereof\n\nMy migrant,\n\nerrant friend\n\nI wish you all the grains\n\nwhatever you had set out for,\n\n& always\n\nSands enough to take you,\n\njust where you stand\n\nWaiting for your No. 28 sunsets, No. 20,\n\nThe watermelon sunrise\n\n& no end of camels.\n\nSource: Poetry (November 2013)"
