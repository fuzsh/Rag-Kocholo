She studied biology in Halle and literature at the Johannes R. Becher Institute for Literature in Leipzig. In 1965, she married the writer Rainer Kirsch. She protested against East Germany's expulsion of Wolf Biermann in 1976, which led to her exclusion from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). One year later she left the country herself, nevertheless being critical of the west as well. She is mainly known for her poetry, but she also writes prose and has translated children's books into German. In 1976 Sarah Kirsch was awarded the German international literary Petrarca-Preis prize.\n\nShe is considered one of the most luminous figures on the reunited German poetic horizon. Her poems have been translated even into Japanese.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nEvents\n\nDeath by Disease 5 May 2013\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nSource Notes\n\nArno Muller, vol 3\n\nCategories"
