        "text": "Some footnotes, as any academic knows, take as long to write as whole chapters. The edition of Ulrichs’ Latin-language newspaper I’m working on has myriad footnotes, and since I’ve had to do some extensive research recently for just one of them, I might as well share it. There will be Lutherans aplenty, Prussians galore, even a glimpse of Napoleon Bonaparte, but at the heart of it, once again, will be an accomplished Latin poem from a source I once, in my foolishness, never imagined, the late nineteenth century.\n\nBut let us orientate ourselves.\n\nPforta, or Schulpforta, is a prestigious, and historically firmly Lutheran, school founded in 1543, during the Reformation, on the site of a former Cistercian monastery. It is located near Naumburg in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, and its geographical position has given it a chequered history extending into recent times. Its eminent former pupils include Nietzsche, Möbius, Wilamowitz and the less famous Bernhard Rogge and Ernst Eck, to both of whom we shall turn shortly.\n\nIn 1893 Pforta celebrated its 350th anniversary, holding a series of events at the school on May 24-26th the memory of which was preserved for posterity in Hans Witte, Pförtner Jubeltage (Rostock, 1893), which provides an account of the celebration and gathers together poetry written to mark the event. Included on pp. 33-4 is a Latin poem in alcaics, a Horatian metre, and elsewhere on pp. 14-16 Witte describes the central role that this poem had played in proceedings. On the morning of Thursday, May 25th the chief ceremony had taken place in the school chapel. There were speeches from the great and good, and the gift was marked from former pupils of three stained-glass windows at the eastern end of the chapel, the choir, behind the altar (shown in the photo at the top). This is where the Latin poem came in, a celebration of the new windows delivered by Hofprediger (“Court Chaplain”) Dr. Bernard Rogge, a Lutheran cleric and theologian who had been a pupil of the school from 1843 to 1850, his arrival at the age of 11 or 12 having coincided, coincidentally or not, with the school’s tercentenary 50 years beforehand.\n\nRogge (1831-1919) recited the poem, but he wasn’t its author. In Pförtner Jubeltage the poem is rather pointedly unattributed, unlike the other poems it records, but it was republished in Das Humanistische Gymnasium 5 (1894), organ of the Deutscher Gymnasialverein (an association of traditional secondary schools), within a larger report (pp. 127-9) on poetic responses to the anniversary at Pforta, in Greek and German too. Here the author of our poem is clearly identified as Ernst Eck (1838-1901), another product of Pforta (1851-57) who was a Professor at the University of Berlin specialising in Roman and German civil law. Pförtner Jubeltage records everyone in attendance at the celebrations of 1893, and Eck was there to hear the delivery of his own poem.\n\nI’m intrigued that Eck didn’t deliver his own composition. The choice of Rogge to do so was clearly purposeful, and we can maybe start to see why. Ordained in 1856, he had made his career as a military chaplain, a profession that in the Prussian army was of higher status than the British equivalent. He was on the staff of a whole division, not just a regiment, and in that role took part in the conflict of 1866 that brought Germany under Prussian control after the latter’s defeat of Austria, and in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. A sign of his status is that when the German Empire was proclaimed after the defeat of France, in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles on January 18, 1871, a moment captured in the image at the bottom, the religious service that preceded the proclamation was led by Rogge, and he delivered a sermon on the occasion that he himself recorded in his later memoir of the Franco-Prussian War. In general he illustrates very well the thorough intertwining of Lutheranism and Prussian militarism, but his role here combined the Lutheranism and Prussian nationalism with a talent for rousing public utterance. He was also a well-published author of works that celebrated Prussia, in effect (I think) a talented propagandist for the regime.\n\nHere’s the poem, with a rough translation (I welcome corrections, as always), and I’ve added some notes below it.\n\nAlumni and Extranei were the two categories of pupils at Pforta, the former far outnumbering the latter and the latter, who lodged in masters’ houses, paying considerably more for their education at the school.\n\nThe school originated as an abbey, suppressed in 1540 by the Protestant Duke Henry of Saxony. With the proceeds of suppressed foundations (in similar fashion to the foundation of many English grammar schools) Henry’s son Duke Maurice (Moritz) founded Pforta in 1543 along with two other Fürstenschulen, “princely schools”, at Meissen and Merseburg (the latter school later relocated to Grimma) to serve Saxony.\n\nThe curriculum at Pforta was a traditional diet of humanistic liberal arts, with Latin and Greek prominent (including Latin verse composition), always framed by Lutheran Christian worship.\n\nTeutonia and the later Teutonicus mean “Germany” and “German”, but “Teutonic” is a term that I think tugs Germany toward the Prussian east, if we think of the medieval Teutonic Order and its territory in Prussia. Prussia was the dominant force in the German Empire, the German Emperor or Kaiser also being the king of Prussia, and Pforta had fallen within Prussia ever since this part of the kingdom of Saxony had been given to Prussia at the Congress of Vienna after the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe poem works through a list of professions that a product of Pforta might pursue, as writers/thinkers, government officials, soldiers, or businessmen, styling them all beneficial to the state.\n\nIt is at first sight odd that a decoration of a Christian chapel should be described with the Latin word lucifer, but in his lectures on Isaiah, at 14.12, Luther had insisted that “Lucifer” was not a name of Satan, as the Papacy falsely held, but simply of the Morning Star. This therefore looks like a Lutheran in-joke.\n\nThe central window represented the scene of Jacob’s dream, his vision of a ladder leading to the gate of heaven. An association between Pforta, Latinised as Porta, and the porta caeli, “gate of heaven”, seen by the Patriarch Jacob was well established even before the establishment of the school, and regularly evoked in relation to the school. Genesis 29.17 in the Vulgate reads: pavensque quam terribilis inquit est locus iste non est hic aliud nisi domus Dei et porta caeli; and in the King James: “And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”\n\nThe two great figures at the origin of Lutheranism, Martin Luther himself (1483-1546) and the scholarly Philip Melanchthon (1497-1560), primary author of the Augsburg Confession, the Lutheran confession of faith. Both were German, and both attached to the University of Wittenberg to the N-E of Naumburg, but the specification of Melanchthon as “German” is I think another touch of humour. Melanchthon was born Philipp Schwartzerdt, his adopted humanist surname a Greek version of “Blackearth”. But he was, the poem insists, despite appearances, a German.\n\nThis is Friedrich Wilhelm III, who was king of Prussia when most of Saxony, including Naumburg, was ceded to Prussia after the Napoleonic Wars. There were significant administrative reforms when Pforta came under Prussian jurisdiction, backed by generous investment in its facilities, and an expansion of its curriculum into maths and the sciences, but to claim the Prussian king as a second founder (and the terms of the poem certainly reflect the message of the window, Maurice and the king balancing each other on either side) is an interesting overstatement of the role of Prussia in its history. The images of the monarchs are not visible on the photograph at the top, but you can see one of them at least, Friedrich Wilhelm I think, here.\n\nThe essence of the Lutheran faith is rather brilliantly encapsulated in a single alcaic line — both the “material principle” or core doctrine of Lutheranism, Article IV of the Augsburg Confession, that faith alone “justifies” a person (makes them righteous in the eyes of God), since our fallen state precludes our earning the forgiveness of our sins in any way by our own efforts; and the “true” virtue, as opposed to traditional, originally pagan, ideas of virtue learned by habituation, that can only follow from that absolute submission to God’s grace.\n\nPforta has a very pretty setting, by all accounts, but also one that placed it in the way of historical events. It suffered badly in the Thirty Years War, as did much of Germany, and from the campaigns of Frederick the Great in the eighteenth century, while in 1813 Napoleon Bonaparte himself stopped at the gates of the school and enquired about it on his way to the battle of Lützen. The school had already been close enough to the battle of Jena in 1806 that the sounds of battle were audible. Eck could have anticipated that his confidently stated hopes for the school’s future in 1893 were in fact optimistic, but not perhaps the form that the twentieth century gave to its crises.\n\nBetween the publication of Witte’s Pförtner Jubeltage and R. Konetzny & P. Dorfmüller, Schulpforta 1543-1993. Ein Lesebuch a century later on the 450th anniversary, there had been a lot of history. The Nazi regime turned Pforta into a Napola, a school essentially designed to inculcate Nazi values of racial superiority and military preparedness. The school theoretically preserved its Classical specialisms, but as Helen Roche describes in “‘Wanderer, kommst du nach Pforta…’: the tension between Classical tradition and the demands of a Nazi elite-school education at Schulpforta and Ilfeld, 1934–45,” European Review of History/Revue européenne d’histoire 20.4 (2013), 581-609, study of Greece and Rome was flattened into simple assertions of Aryan racial and cultural supremacy. How the windows fared during this period I do not know. After the war Pforta found itself in the Soviet-controlled part of Germany, and while it finally became co-educational at this point, connections with the Federal Republic were severed and it struggled to maintain its character against the ideological demands of the GDR’s educational policies. It is now, after Reunification, a public boarding school for gifted children serving Saxony-Anhalt, so an equilibrium has been restored.\n\nOur poem is not perhaps as convincing a recreation of Horace’s lyric as James Peddie Steele’s remarkable celebration of an international medical conference and Rome’s first modern hospital, written at a similar time, but it isn’t aiming to emulate the Roman model in the same way, and it achieves clarity, elegance and not a little wit within a challenging poetic form. It offers a poetic counterpart of the colourful new windows to the extent even, Allan Hands suggests to me below, of paralleling the lyric stanzas with window panels. We can note, as I am wont to do, the alertness here to the “alcaic effect”, the special emphasis potentially lent to words at the centre of every third line of a stanza: iussu in the third stanza and caelique in the seventh are well served by their placement, for instance.\n\nWhatever the merits of this Latin poem, in any case, it’s an interesting historical document from the fin de siècle."
