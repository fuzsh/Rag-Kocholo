        "text": "How does her present German homeland honor this great woman? In 2010, they renamed Agnes\n\nMiegel Street in St. Arnold to Anne-Frank-street. Suddenly, a world renowned German poet is\n\n\"controversial\" according to Germany's \"Culture Committee\". The \"Court of Culture\" met and\n\ndecided to rename the street where she lived because \"of the Nazi glorification by Miegel\" and\n\nunanimously awarded the street the new name, \"Anne-Frank-Straße\". Miegel was guilty merely by\n\nassociation, collectively guilty. We might bear in mind that in Rostock, Germany today there still\n\nexists an \"Ilya Ehrenberg Street\" named in honor of the vile communist propagandist who inspired\n\nthe Red Army to mercilessly rape and torture female German civilians at war's end. That is\n\napparently not \"controversial\" in today's Germany.\n\nShe was an author, journalist, and poet and she received the Kleist Prize for lyric in 1913, the Herder\n\nPrize in 1936, the Goethe Prize of the City of Frankfurt in 1940, the literature prize of the Bavarian\n\nAcademy of Art (Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie der Künste) in 1959 and the West\n\nPrussian Cultural Prize in 1962. She was a member of the German Academy of Poetry (Deutsche\n\nAkademie der Dichtung) and an honorary doctorate of the University of Königsberg.\n\nGentle woman Agnes Miegel (1879-1964) has been described as the Mother of East Prussia. A\n\npoetess of intense feeling, above all others, Miegel put the foremost poetic face of the human\n\nsuffering of ethnic Germans expelled from their homes after World War Two. Her classic ballads\n\noften describe her deep love of her East Prussian homeland but her deep, spiritual poetry speaks to\n\nand for all of the Expellees.\n\n\"Once there was this land—we loved this land—yet horror fell upon it just as\n\ndunes of sand. As elks in marsh and meadow vanished, so the trace of man\n\nand beast is lost. They froze in snow, they scorched in flames, how miserably\n\nthey wasted in the hands of strangers. Deep under the Baltic waves they lie,\n\ntheir bones awash in bays and straits, they sleep on Jutland's sandy bosom,\n\nand we, the lone survivors, wander homelessly, like seaweed strewn about\n\nafter the storms, like autumn leaves that drift and sob.\n\nAlone You, Our Father, You do know What this our desolation means.\"\n\nKollwitz lived in the old Berlin district called \"Prenzlauer Berg\", formerly known as the \"Feldmark\"\n\nat the corner of Knaackstrasse and Weissenburger Strasse (later Kollwitzstrasse) until her house was\n\ndestroyed by Allied bombs in 1943. On the same night, the entire Weissenburger/Belforter/\n\nStrassburger/Metzer roads area went up in flames from the attack. After 1945, the Russian secret\n\nservice kept one of its huge detention facility on the Prenzlauer Avenue, which from the start\n\nrounded up not simply ringleaders and \"war criminals\", but anyone they regarded as uttering\n\n\"anti-soviet expressions\". These detention centers developed quickly as part of the repressive Soviet\n\nsystem. The detention cellar in the Prenzlauer avenue was taken over by the Ministry for public\n\nsecurity of the GDR in 1950 and remained in use until at least 1956.\n\nKollwitz was a native of East Prussia, a land that is no more. Few locations saw as much human\n\nsuffering in wartime as the inhabitants of East Prussia, particularly the women and children. Greatly\n\ndamaged in World War One after being severed by the victorious Allies from its cultural and ethnic\n\nroots in greater Germany, many citizens relocated in the post war years. For those who stayed in\n\ntheir homeland, World War Two brought horrendous violence and cruelty from the invading Red\n\nArmy, including the biggest mass rape in history.\n\nKäthe Schmidt knew heartache and agony. She was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, the daughter\n\nof a well to do mason. She attended The Berlin School of Art in 1884 and later studied in Munich.\n\nAfter her marriage to Dr. Karl Kollwitz in 1891, the couple settled in Berlin, living in a poor section\n\nof the city where her husband set up his practise, and they had two sons.\n\nSoon after the start of the First World War, her son, Peter joined the German Army. He was killed\n\non October 22, 1914 at Diksmuide on the Western Front. During the Second World War, her\n\ngrandson was killed while fighting for the German Army on the Eastern Front. Käthe Kollwitz lived\n\nand worked for more than 50 years in Berlin. On her flight from Allied bomb attacks, which\n\ndestroyed her home and most of her life's work in 1943, she was invited by Prince Ernst Heinrich of\n\nSaxony to Moritzburg, a short distance from Dresden, which was also soon levelled in another series\n\nof devastating fire bombings."
