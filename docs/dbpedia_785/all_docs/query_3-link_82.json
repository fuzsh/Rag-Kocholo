        "text": "Novalis Biography\n\nGeorg Friedrich Philipp von Hardenburg (wrote under the pen name of Novalis) was born in Oberwiederstedt, Prussian Saxony, into a family of Protestant Lower Saxon nobility. His father was a director of a salt mine. At the age of ten Novalis was sent to a religious school but he did not adjust to its strict discipline. For some time Novalis lived with his uncle, grandseigneur, who opened him doors to French rationalism and culture. He then went to Weissenfels, where his father moved, and entered the Eisleben gymnasium. In 1790-91 he studied law at the University of Jena, where he met Friedrich von Schiller and Friedrich Schlegel. Novalis completed his studies at Wittenberg in 1793. The ideas of the French Revolution spread through Germany and Novalis dreamt of time when the \"walls of Jericho\" tumble down. Goethe's book Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship, which he read in 1795, influenced his deeply; he considered it the Bible for the \"new age.\" In 1795-96 he studied the works of Johann Gottlieb Fichte. At the age of 21 he moved to Tennstädt and took up job in civil sevice. In 1798 Novalis published a series of philosophical fragments, FRAGMENTEN. Novalis' only finished collection of poems, HYMNEN AN DIE NACHT (1800), was dedicated to his first great love Sophie von Kühn, who died in 1797. The death of his young fiancé, Sophie von Kühn, led him to write Hymnen an die Nacht (Hymns to the Night), a set of six prose and verse lyrics first published in 1800 in Athenaeum, a literary magazine edited by August Wilhelm Schlegel and his brother Friedrich Schlegel. Seven months after the publication of Hymns to the Night, Novalis died of tuberculosis, the same disease that had claimed his fiancé.)\n\nThe Best Poem Of Novalis\n\nHymns To The Night : 6 : Longing For Death\n\nLonging for Death\n\nInto the bosom of the earth,\n\nOut of the Light's dominion,\n\nDeath's pains are but a bursting forth,\n\nSign of glad departure.\n\nSwift in the narrow little boat,\n\nSwift to the heavenly shore we float.\n\nBlessed be the everlasting Night,\n\nAnd blessed the endless slumber.\n\nWe are heated by the day too bright,\n\nAnd withered up with care.\n\nWe're weary of a life abroad,\n\nAnd we now want our Father's home.\n\nWhat in this world should we all\n\nDo with love and with faith?\n\nThat which is old is set aside,\n\nAnd the new may perish also.\n\nAlone he stands and sore downcast\n\nWho loves with pious warmth the Past.\n\nThe Past where the light of the senses\n\nIn lofty flames did rise;\n\nWhere the Father's face and hand\n\nAll men did recognize;\n\nAnd, with high sense, in simplicity\n\nMany still fit the original pattern.\n\nThe Past wherein, still rich in bloom,\n\nMan's strain did burgeon glorious,\n\nAnd children, for the world to come,\n\nSought pain and death victorious,\n\nAnd, through both life and pleasure spake,\n\nYet many a heart for love did break.\n\nThe Past, where to the flow of youth\n\nGod still showed himself,\n\nAnd truly to an early death\n\nDid commit his sweet life.\n\nFear and torture patiently he bore\n\nSo that he would be loved forever.\n\nWith anxious yearning now we see\n\nThat Past in darkness drenched,\n\nWith this world's water never we\n\nShall find our hot thirst quenched.\n\nTo our old home we have to go\n\nThat blessed time again to know.\n\nWhat yet doth hinder our return\n\nTo loved ones long reposed?\n\nTheir grave limits our lives.\n\nWe are all sad and afraid.\n\nWe can search for nothing more --\n\nThe heart is full, the world is void.\n\nInfinite and mysterious,\n\nThrills through us a sweet trembling --\n\nAs if from far there echoed thus\n\nA sigh, our grief resembling.\n\nOur loved ones yearn as well as we,\n\nAnd sent to us this longing breeze.\n\nDown to the sweet bride, and away\n\nTo the beloved Jesus.\n\nHave courage, evening shades grow gray\n\nTo those who love and grieve.\n\nA dream will dash our chains apart,\n\nAnd lay us in the Father's lap."
