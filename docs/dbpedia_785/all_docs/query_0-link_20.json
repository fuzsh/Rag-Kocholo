His books include The English Constitution (1867), Physics and Politics (1872), and Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (1873).

Her work has been exhibited in New York City, Provincetown, New Haven, Philadelphia, Berlin, and elsewhere, and she has been an artist-in-residence at the Millay Colony.
