Smith\n\nThe will to see oneself as\n\nfragile, fallible,\n\nliable to fail.\n\nTo consider a stranger and\n\nhear, in the mind’s ear,\n\none’s true voice\n\ninsisting: I must change.\n\nOrdinary people do this\n\nPatient urgent work\n\nalone and together\n\nday upon day upon day.\n\nLike my mother, once,\n\nleading her ailing mother\n\nback through the maze\n\nof our suburban scrawl,\n\npast ache, past haze,\n\npast confusion and rage\n\ntoward a neat room\n\nwhere waited prayer,\n\nfear, forgiveness,\n\ngrief, grace. This\n\nis a poem about kin\n\nand neighbors and nations\n\nadrift, in error, under siege.\n\nThis is a ceasefire poem.\n\n© 2023 by Tracy K.

There are few details of his life known from 1600, when he first arrived in London, to 1606, when he completed his first literary works Fame’s Memorial and Honour Triumphant. In 1601, he was residing at the Middle Temple, a complex of buildings which is one of the Inns of Court, the four associations of the barristers of England and Wales, but it is not known if Ford was studying for the bar, or was a just gentleman boarder. Financial difficulties got him expelled from the Middle Temple between 1606 and 1608, when he was readmitted. From 1620 onward, he concentrated on writing plays, and is best known for his 1633 tragedy ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore, a family drama with brother-sister incest. Ford’s date of death is unknown, but is believed to have been in 1639.\n\nDawn\n\nby John Ford\n\nFly hence, shadows, that do keep\n\nWatchful sorrows charm’d in sleep!\n\nTho’ the eyes be overtaken,\n\nYet the heart doth ever waken\n\nThoughts chain’d up in busy snares\n\nOf continual woes and cares;\n\nLove and griefs are so exprest\n\nAs they rather sigh than rest.\n\nFly hence, shadows, that do keep\n\nWatchful sorrows charm’d in sleep!\n\n______________________________\n\nApril 18\n\n______________________________\n\n1925 – Bob Kaufman born as Robert Garnell Kaufman in New Orleans, Louisiana; American Beat poet, jazz performance artist, and satirist.

In 1959, along with poet Allen Ginsberg and others, he was a co-founder and one of the editors of Beatitude poetry magazine. He was primarily a spoken word poet, and many of his poems would have been lost if his second wife Eileen Singe had not gathered up the scraps of paper he often used, or written them down as he worked them out aloud. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Kaufman took a Buddhist vow of silence that lasted until the end of the Vietnam War in 1973. He finally broke his silence by reciting his poem “All Those Ships that Never Sailed.” After some of his poetry was published in French translation, he was hailed in France as the Black American Rimbaud. He died of emphysema at age 60 in January 1986.
