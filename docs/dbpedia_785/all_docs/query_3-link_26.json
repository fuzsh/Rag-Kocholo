        "text": "The centuries-long path to German industrialization must be understood as a gradual institutional evolution in response to new circumstances, new opportunities, and new scarcities. Efforts to identify a single deus ex machina—whether Napoleon, Prussian reformers, or some other exogenous driver—do not lead to convincing results. Gradualism offers a plausible account of how a market economy and capitalism took root in German society. Only those German regions that had successfully launched gradual institutional reforms in the eighteenth century were well situated, by the early years of the nineteenth century, to move quickly to an identifiable market economy. Against this background we discuss the role of Prussia and Napoleon in modernizing the institutional framework of the German economy. The Prussian model of agrarian reforms and economic freedom represents a profound event in the history of economic development. A comparable strategic approach was absent in all French-controlled territories before or after 1815. Prussian reformers were the first in history to embrace a multi-sectoral strategy of rural development, enabling them to successfully combine growth with equity.\n\n10 Sean A.

Hagen, “Village Life in East-Elbian Germany and Poland, 1400 – 1800,” both in The Peasantries of Europe: From the Fourteenth to the Eighteenth Centuries, ed. Tom Scott (London: Longman, 1998), respectively 111 – 42 and 145 – 89; Michael Kopsidis, Agrarentwicklung. Historische Agrarrevolutionen und Entwicklungsökonomie (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2006); Michael Kopsidis and Klaus-Joachim Lorenzen-Schmidt, “North-West Germany, 1000 – 1750,” in The Agro-Food Market: Production, Distribution and Consumption, ed. Leen Van Molle and Yves Segers (Turnhout: Brepols, 2013), 261 – 91; Robisheaux, “The Peasantries of Western Germany,” 142, states that for western Germany, “a renewal of seigneurial authority would have been almost impossible by 1750.”\n\n11 Eddie, Freedom’s Price, 85 and 110. Around 1700, the majority of Prussian peasants were serfs and peasants (Lassiten) with very weak property rights to their farms and a minimal personal status. Serfdom mostly vanished over the course of the eighteenth century. While variable short-term tenancy (Zeitpacht) increased somewhat, hereditary long-term leaseholds (Erbpacht), which granted peasants good but not full property rights to their farms, became more popular. According to Eddie, existing evidence suggests that “a majority, possibly the vast majority, of peasant farms were held under a pretty secure form of tenure.”\n\n37 Barbara Vogel, “Einleitung. Die preussischen Reformen als Gegenstand und Problem der Forschung,” in Preussische Reformen, 1807 – 1820, ed. Barbara Vogel (Königstein im Taunus: Verlagsgruppe Athenäum, Hain, Scriptor, Hanstein, 1980), 1 – 27, here p. 17; Vogel, Allgemeine Gewerbefreiheit. Die Reformpolitik des preussischen Staatskanzlers Hardenberg (1810 – 1820) (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1983), 31 and 48 – 72; Paul Nolte, Staatsbildung als Gesellschaftsreform. Politische Reformen in Preussen und den süddeutschen Staaten, 1800 – 1820 (Frankfurt am Main: Campus Verlag, 1990), 26 – 28 and 39 – 42; Fehrenbach, Vom Ancien Régime zum Wiener Kongress. While all the reformers in the bureaucracy were disgusted by the “bloody excesses” of the French Revolution, they welcomed this event as the “point of no return” that had opened the possibility for Germany to develop according to Enlightenment principles. They wanted a “good revolution” carried out through reforms not mass executions: Vogel, “Einleitung,” 15.\n\n43 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, as the Prussian Staatsphilosoph (state philosopher), would later transform this concept into his philosophy of history. The idea of “world spirit” (Weltgeist), and the interpretation of the Prussian state as its highest incarnation, was not Hegel’s alone. Anticipating Hegel, Prussia’s reforming bureaucrats saw themselves as the avant-garde of world history, intent on making Prussia a model state: Koselleck, Preussen zwischen Reform und Revolution, 169.\n\n53 During the entire eighteenth century, the pursuit and maintenance of great power status had stimulated intense debates within the ruling Prussian circles on internal modernization reforms in accordance with Enlightenment principles. According to Brendan Simms, “Reform in Britain and Prussia, 1797 – 1815: (Confessional) Fiscal-Military State and Military-Agrarian Complex,” in Reform in Great Britain and Germany, 1750 – 1850, ed. T. C. W. Blanning and Peter Wende (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 79 – 100, here p. 87: “this shows the essential continuities between seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Prussian reform absolutism and the reform era of the early nineteenth century.”\n\n130 The extraordinary economic, political, social, and demographic dynamics of Germany throughout the decades before the industrial take-off do not support the idea of a long recovery period after 1815. It must be recalled that “unlike the twentieth-century world wars, the Napoleonic wars were not marked by large-scale physical destruction; though the productive potential of some towns and districts suffered from military operations or civil disturbances, such destruction was quite limited in space and time.” Crouzet, “Wars, Blockade, and Economic Change,” 567.\n\n133 According to Crouzet, “Wars, Blockade, and Economic Change,” 567 and 588, by abolishing most tariff barriers on the European continent, the ending of Kleinstaaterei (dominance of petty states) through Napoleon’s “large scale redrafting of Europe’s political map” was crucial to deflecting Europe’s trade from seaborne Atlantic routes to domestic ones. This was especially true for Germany and Italy: “larger economic units had been created and there was a clear tendency of Berg and Saxony industrialists to increase their sales on the German markets, especially in the eastern parts of Germany. Later on, the creation of large national markets through the Zollverein and Italian unity was, of course, to strengthen this trend. With a few exceptions … Continental industries were to work mostly for their own national markets.”"
