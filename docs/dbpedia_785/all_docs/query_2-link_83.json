Starting out, it was a small operation with one truck and has now grown to have several full-time crews.\n\nMichael was born and raised in Oshkosh, WI. He attended Oshkosh Lourdes High School and the University of WI-Oshkosh. He is married to Sarah and they have two daughters.\n\nHis love for the outdoors began at a young age and is where his interest in landscaping blossomed. He continued to work in the trade during college, where he was able to gain even more experience and would later pair with the Business degree he earned."
