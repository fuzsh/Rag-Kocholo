        "text": "Sarah Kirsch: T\n\nSarah Kirsch died in 2013. Born Ingrid Bernstein in what later became East Germany, she changed her name to Sarah in protest against Nazi anti-semitism. Later political protest caused her to leave for the West.\n\nSarah Kirsch's pamphlet, the poem sequence T, with a parallel English translation by Wendy Mulford and Anthony Vivis, was published by Reality Street in 1995. It's a beautiful little item, physically quite unlike the rest of Reality Street's output, with a dust jacket featuring a painting by Sarah. Sadly, it's long out of print, but we are told it will be included in a future edition from another press â€“ more information to come.\n\n1995, 1-874400-05-9 , 28pp, OUT OF PRINT"
