        "text": "Born in 1966 in Frankfurt, Susanne Kirsch lives and works in Rodenbach. Her career leads her to new projects and challenges - in life as well as in art. Studying color painting from 2017 with Professor Jerry Zeniuk and Ingrid Floß at the Art Academy in Kolbermoor and Bad Reichenhall, Susanne has provided her work groundbreaking accents. Through the interplay of colors, she skillfully creates the illusion of spatial depth in her multi-layered compositions. She became known at exhibitions and art fairs as well as through publications in two international art books. Today, Susanne is represented in private collections worldwide.\n\nHow did you get into art?\n\nArt has always accompanied me. In a stressful phase of my life I bought a canvas and paint and just started and never stopped.\n\nHow would you describe your style? What makes your work special?\n\nI don't worry about that. I paint what comes to mind, what goes through my head ... I think I work very unconventionally, with the water slider, besom, hand brush, to list just a few. I like to experiment, I have a head full of ideas, I don't like to follow rules and I don't like to be pigeonholed... Maybe it's the combination of all these things that makes my work special.\n\nHow do you go about developing your work?\n\nMy works are multilayered. The actual composition is often created within a very short time. Then I go into depth. I like blobs, splashes of color, paint running across the painting, anything that serves to bring it to life.\n\nWho or what influences you?\n\nI'm certainly influenced by my environment, and artists like Helen Frankenthaler and Lee Krasner, whose work I really appreciate.\n\nMake us curious. What is planned next?\n\nI will paint mannequins, lead courses as a docent at an Art Academy in Vienna, realize projects with new partners, but I can not talk about that yet..."
