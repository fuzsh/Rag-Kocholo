        "text": "I think about the first of our species (or an ancestral species) to vocalize in a melodic manner, the first to vocalize with another human to make harmony – consonant or dissonant. I think about the first union of music and language. I think about why, after so long, we are still compelled, on such a primal level, to sing… Especially together.\n\nStrangely, so many of us are afraid to sing. Our voices are so tied to our identities: it’s when we feel safe that they can truly open. I approach singing as a meditation, a ritual in some ways. It can be a sonic balm to soothe us from the inside out and back again. It is a tangible realization of our bodies as unique instruments worthy of sounding.\n\nMy philosophy is shaped as much by Pauline Oliveros as its is by Johann Sebastian Bach: to listen deeply, comprehensively and to know that the greatest things come from tuning into one another.\n\nAs Coreen (Coreen Douglas from The Kettle) and I were talking about The Kettle Society and its choir, a new momentum began whirling in me. It’s not just excitement. It’s an ache to make real sound with real people who live real lives. We know how healing sound is. A fundamental part of my current research and practice is testing the ability of collaborative sound making to help us reconnect with our own essential resonance as much as each other's. I feel like the Kettle Choir is a really perfect place to get to do that.\n\nI have a 10 year old grey cat with a pink nose and white mitts and boots. He was just a wee kitten when we found each other. I had this idea that he should pick his own name, so I sat with him on the floor of my apartment and went through all my old language text books. He didn’t respond to anything from the French or German ones, but he cooed like a pigeon when I got to ‘Giacomo.’ A few days later, the song rolodex of my mind popped his name into the chorus of ‘Iko Iko’ (one of my childhood faves) and his last name became Finane. If you’ve never heard the Dixie Cups’ version, go find it right now."
