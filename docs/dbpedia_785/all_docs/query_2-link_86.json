An essential component of that is creating an environment of friendship, camaraderie and well-being among residents and between residents and faculty. While the demands of residency can be intense at times, residents are always pleasantly surprised to discover that life does not need to stop during their training. There are many social activities for housestaff as well as their partners, families, and friends to enjoy around New York. These include seeing shows on Broadway, exploring different boroughs and neighborhoods, sampling the endless restaurants, going to sports games (Yankees, Mets, Knicks, Nets, Liberty, Rangers, Jets, Giants), meeting for karaoke and bowling nights, and attending \"Switch\" parties at the end of each block, the Annual Winter Holiday party, and the Graduation party at the end of the year.\n\nHousestaff Council\n\nThe Department of Medicine Housestaff Council is a peer-elected body composed of house officers that serve as advocates for the residents. The council meets on a monthly basis to discuss resident-related issues regarding work environment, education and morale. The Housestaff Council collaborates with the program director, the administration and the chief residents on numerous projects throughout the year. In addition, the Housestaff Council assists and organizes social events including happy hours and orientation events for incoming residents. The Department of Medicine Housestaff Council sends representatives to the interdepartmental housestaff council to discuss hospital-wide concerns.\n\nHousing\n\nMount Sinai owns several apartment buildings in the vicinity of the hospital which are used for professional housing. Household size is a factor in determining housing assignments. Accommodations include furnished bedrooms in shared suites in the Residence Hall, as well as studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments. All are located in proximity to the hospital. Incoming residents are eligible to apply for Mount Sinai housing. Housing offers are based on a lottery system in which applications are divided into three categories: incoming families, incoming couples, and incoming singles. All applicants will receive a housing offer based on their randomly assigned lottery number and top 10 choices.\n\nLiving in New York City\n\nAs one of the most influential and iconic cities in the world, New York offers nearly anything that you can possibly imagine. Whether you are interested in the post-modern collections at the Museum of Modern Art, the newest Broadway hit, the latest fashion trend or the independent film industry, New York boasts an array of culture every night. And for the adventuresome foodie or indie rocker, the city bursts with a new crop of restaurants and musical acts on nearly a weekly basis. Each neighborhood offers a different flavor and feel and if you grow tired of Manhattan, the outer boroughs can provide a year’s worth of activities.
