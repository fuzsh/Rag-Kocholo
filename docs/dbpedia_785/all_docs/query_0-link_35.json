The primary objective of the course is to give students the opportunity to explore language as it is embedded in the culture. Students will explore mostly contemporary but also historical aspects of the cultures of the German-speaking countries through a journey through the Stationen (stations) of which each stands for a major city in Austria, Germany, or Switzerland and the region that it represents. Testing is done in increments, with chapter quizzes instead of mid-terms or a traditional final exam. Students complete writing and reading assessments, all with a take-home component. There are two oral projects (not traditional exams). During the second half of the semester students will have the opportunity to sign up for a mini seminar of their choice. These weeklong seminars substitute for regular class meetings and permit students to explore specific interests in German language, linguistics, literature, and culture/history.

This course will survey immigration (and to a lesser extent, emigration) in various historical periods as well as the present, and consider the reasons, the consequences—for cultures, the language(s), the economy, and so on of these regions—of migration. We will touch on the experience of immigrants and the receiving population as they adjust to their changing culture.\n\nThis is a course in the tradition of liberal arts education. This course particularly encourages students to expand their knowledge of human cultures as they relate to the physical and natural world. In acquiring this knowledge, we will practice a range of 21st-century skills, including: inquiry and analysis; critical and creative thinking; written and oral communication; intercultural knowledge and competence; and ethical reasoning.\n\nThe topic of how migration interacts with the culture of the Netherlands involves many angles. Students are invited write a paper and make a brief presentation in class on a topic that relates to their major academic interests.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Jolanda Vanderwal Taylor: jvtaylor@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 249 – Intermediate German: Speak And Listen\n\n(3 credits)\n\nSection 001: MWF 9:55-10:45 am 499 Van Hise Hall\n\nSection 002: MWF 11:00-11:50 am 583 Van Hise Hall\n\nSection 003: MWF 1:20-2:10 pm 495 Van Hise Hall\n\nPrerequisites: German 204 or appropriate score on the UW-System German placement test or consent of instructor. This course can be taken subsequent to, prior to, or concurrent with German 262, German 258, and German 274/284. Open to first-year students.\n\nLanguage of Instruction: German\n\nDrawing mainly on contemporary audio and video materials from German-speaking countries, including podcasts, video clips from German-language television, and two contemporary films (“Das Wunder von Bern” and “Vitus”), this course is intended to deepen students’ appreciation of German as a spoken language by making them more aware of how native speakers adapt their German to fit the contexts in which they use it. The main objectives of the course are:\n\nto improve students’ comprehension and production of spoken German via exposure to the language in use in audio and video formats;\n\nto promote students’ awareness of how spoken German varies according to speech situation and region, mainly in terms of sound structures (pronunciation) and vocabulary;\n\nto enhance students’ understanding of contemporary German-speaking cultures in Europe and beyond and the central role that language plays in shaping these cultures.\n\nRequired Work and Grading:\n\nOn Fridays students will receive a Wochenplan outlining required work for the coming week that will include in-class activities and homework assignments. A main component of these Wochenpläne will be tasks to promote development of effective pre- and post-listening/viewing strategies for the various audio and video clips we will work with. Since an important aspect of the course is making students not only more aware of how native speakers pronounce German, but also the ways in which their pronunciation may differ from native norms, they will be recording themselves for most homework assignments using the free software Audacity. We will also work quite a bit with phonetic transcriptions of German to understand better how spoken German corresponds to or deviates from the written language. Finally, in order to expand their vocabulary and heighten their awareness of variation in spoken German, students will be required to create a “personal dictionary” over the course of the semester. Most weeks they will be asked to write down at least 10 new words and phrases they learn and note information about pronunciation and usage. Students will be asked to submit their personal dictionary installments to their instructor on Fridays. In-class work will be centered on activities spelled out in the Wochenpläne and sometimes supplemented by audio-visual materials, but it is expected that students will access these materials (on multiple occasions) mostly outside of class. All audio-visual materials will be accessible electronically over the 249 Learn@UW Web site, Learning Support Services, or online. In terms of cultural content, we will be working with sources that address topics such as the impact of the World War II and post-war eras; East/West differences and reunification; language use in Austria and Switzerland; and youth speech and popular culture\n\nThe final grade for the course will be determined as follows: 4 quizzes @ 10% = 40% 12 homework exercises @ 2.5% = 30% 10 personal dictionary installments 10% final pronunciation assignment 5% preparation before and participation during class 5% five-minute oral presentation (Referat) 10%.\n\nThere is no required textbook for this course; all materials will be accessible over Learn@UW.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Mark L.

This course can be taken subsequent to, prior to, or concurrent with German 249 and German 262. Open to Freshman.\n\nLanguage of instruction: German\n\nCourse Description and Learning Goals: This course is designed to acquaint students with German literary, cultural, and historical texts and provide an overview of cultural developments in German-speaking countries. An important goal of this course is to offer explicit instruction on reading strategies to help students improve their comprehension of a range of texts.\n\nIn German 258, students will:\n\nrecognize different genres, reading styles, and strategies;\n\nimplement critical reading skills for reading and comprehending different types of texts;\n\ndemonstrate the ability to read autonomously;\n\nidentify, define, and implement vocabulary related to the topics covered in class.\n\nRequired Work and Grading: Much of the required work for this course will involve tasks to promote the development of effective reading strategies for the diverse texts and genres with which we will work. Students will keep a prepare weekly graded assignments on Canvas and keep a reading journal. These assignments consist of in-depth activities that guide students through the readings. Students are expected to prepare readings and accompanying exercises in advance of class and to participate fully in whole-class discussions and small-group/partner work. Class discussions will be conducted in German.\n\nThe final grade for the course will be determined by weekly assignments, two tests, one final reading exam, two self-directed reading assignments, and active class participation.\n\nRequired texts:\n\nA photocopied course reader.\n\nFriedrich Dürrenmatt, Die Physiker (The Physicists, drama)\n\nThomas Brussig, Am kürzeren Ende der Sonnenallee (novel)\n\nAll assignments will be available to download via Canvas.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Jeanne Schueller: jmschuel@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 262 – Intermediate German-Writing\n\n(3 credits)\n\nSection 001: TR 9:30-10:45 am 159 Van Hise Hall\n\nSection 003: TR 1:00-2:15 pm 495 Van Hise Hall\n\nPrerequisites: German 204 or appropriate UW-System Placement Test score or consent of instructor. This course can be taken subsequent to, prior to, or concurrent with German 249 and German 258.\n\nLanguages of instruction: German and English.\n\nCourse description and learning goals:\n\nThis course focuses on developing students’ ability to analyze and produce a range of genres (text types) in contemporary written German. Examples of genres covered extend from poetry to short fiction and drama to various kinds of nonfiction (reports, synopses, etc.). Special attention will be paid to reviewing key points of grammar and expanding vocabulary. In this course it is hoped that students will:\n\nbecome more aware of the grammatical, lexical, and pragmatic features of various genres of German as a written language;\n\nlearn how to use existing written texts (real German texts) as models for one’s own writing;\n\nexplore how different genres of written language emulate or deviate from norms of spoken language or can be performed as oral language (e.g., recitals, storytelling, dramatic performances, comic strips, instruction manuals, narratives);\n\nshare with others in the writing processes through collaborative writing, reader response, portfolio management, and performing/reading aloud another’s work;\n\nlearn to appreciate the relevance of grammatical accuracy, lexical precision, proper discourse organization, and voice/expressiveness in communicating shared and individual experiences across language and cultural boundaries.\n\nRequired work and grading:\n\nThis course emphasizes the use of writing models and an appreciation of genre (text type). It strikes a balance between individual and collaborative writing and between teacher- and student-guided writing activities. Students will develop and pursue individualized goals, for example, working toward accuracy in specific grammatical features or enhancing specific thematic vocabulary. The overarching goals will be (a) to gain an understanding of the conventions of different genres of German writing; (b) to improve stylistic abilities through expanded vocabulary and writing models (real German texts), from which we will learn about important features of written language, such as relative pronouns, zu-infinitives, passives, simple past and past perfect tenses, and subjunctives; and (c) to take linguistic risks. We are not aiming for 100% grammatical accuracy but improved accuracy in basic features such as subject-verb agreement and case assignment together with experimenting with “more difficult” features, even if they do not always turn out perfectly. Students will be encouraged to identify areas in which they need to improve and then focus on these in their writing. By the end of the semester, each student’s work should resemble a managed portfolio, with the last assignment asking students to reflect on their writing development. In-class work will consist of collaborative writing activities (including planning and feedback), discussions, and explication of text features (based on real German texts), vocabulary expansion with a particular focus on synonyms Common class meetings will be suspended for a brief period of time so as to accommodate individual writing conferences with the instructor. There is no traditional final exam.\n\nRequired texts:\n\nDurrell, Martin (any edition and format). Using German Synonyms. Cambridge University Press.\n\nIn-class materials for each day (listed under the date), to be downloaded from CANVAS.\n\nAt-home materials for each day (listed under the date), to be downloaded from CANVAS.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Monika Chavez: mmchavez@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 267/JEWISH 267 – Yiddish Song And The Jewish Experience\n\nMatthew Greene (3-4 credits)\n\nSection 001: M 1:20-2:10 pm (plenary session) 3250 Helen C. White Hall\n\nDiscussion 301: W 1:20-2:10 pm and F 1:20-2:10 pm (optional Comm-B sections)\n\nPrerequisites: None. Open to Freshmen.\n\nFulfills Ethnic Studies requirement, Comm-B option available. Does not fulfill foreign language requirement and cannot be applied towards German major but may be counted toward the major as cognate course.\n\nLanguage of instruction: English\n\nThe format of this course is blended: students will work through on-line modules and discussion forums on their own and meet once a week for in-class activities in the multifunctional WisCEL classroom. Those who opt for Comm-B will attend an additional section once a week and receive 4 credits. Using the medium of Yiddish song to explore the culture and history of Jews in the diaspora, we will focus on their experience as a minority first in Europe and then in the United States. Facing discrimination, oppression, and marginalization on both sides of the Atlantic, Jews used Yiddish song as a vehicle to express their pain as well as their pride. The goals of this course are to increase students’ capacity to value the unique qualities of Yiddish song as a reflection of the Jewish experience by appreciating the depth of expression conveyed in its sounds and its lyrics, as well as to gain insight into the process of immigration and acculturation in the United States from the perspective of a persecuted group, the challenges it faced in confrontation with new forms of discrimination and marginalization, and the outlet this group found in the performing arts for documenting their struggles and for finding a creative niche in their new surroundings.\n\nCourse requirements differ depending on whether students take the Comm-B option or not.\n\nThere is no text required for purchase for this course.\n\nGERMAN 278 – Topics in German Culture: Horror\n\nTR 1:00-2:15 pm 4322 Sewell Social Sciences Adam Stern (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: Open to Freshman.\n\nThis class will examine the idea and representation of “horror” in film, literature, philosophy, and history. Particular attention will be paid to differences with other well-known concepts, such as fear, anxiety, and terror. The question of horror will also serve as a vehicle for the investigation of contemporary political issues surrounding race and gender. Does not fulfill foreign language requirement and cannot be applied towards German major. Repeatable for credit with different topic (taught in English).\n\nGERMAN 311 – First Semester Dutch (For Graduate Students)\n\nMTWR 9:55-10:45 am 491 Van Hise Hall Prof. Jolanda Vanderwal Taylor (4 credits)\n\nFace-to-face but with substantial multimedia component online.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\n(This course is also offered for undergraduate students as German 111.)\n\nOne of the advantages of studying at the UW is being able to take courses in Dutch.

The texts we consider will approach these questions from various perspectives and vantage points.\n\nWe will look at the techniques, devices, methods and structures that writers employ to entertain, amuse and educate the reader, to provide an aesthetic experience, to challenge the reader, and to allow readers to consider the “big questions” such as:\n\n*What is success in life? What is the good life? What matters?\n\n*How do we present ourselves to others, and to ourselves?\n\n*What is important: outward appearances? A middle-class lifestyle?\n\n*What does it mean to be honest about oneself, or with oneself? (“Fake news” is an occupation in Dutch cultural life these days). How does a lack of self-reflection or honesty affect the narration of a novel? (–the unreliable narrator)\n\n*Why do characters choose different values than those I aspire to?\n\n*Why do writers decide to select heroes or anti-heroes, winners or losers as the characters in their fiction?\n\n*What questions should readers ask themselves and each other?\n\nThis course invites its participants to read attentively, to think carefully, and to discuss thoughtfully and vigorously, based on a fascinating body of texts.\n\nStudents who enroll in German 325 will do their reading and writing in Dutch, and speak Dutch during the weekly discussion. During TR 2:30 PM – 3:45 PM, we will meet with the students in LitTrans 326, and speak English.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Jolanda Vanderwal Taylor: jvtaylor@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 337 – Advanced Composition and Conversation\n\nTR 4:00-5:15 pm 387 Van Hise Hall Sonja Klocke (3 credits)\n\nGerman 337 will summarize, synthesize, and build upon the content and skills from previous German coursework with specific aims to enhance and improve students’ speaking, listening, reading, and writing of German. Course content will cover a range of topics related to contemporary German society and culture along with grammar review.\n\nIn German 337, students will:\n\nimplement strategies for enhanced listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills (including translation);\n\nidentify and develop elements of grammar needed to improve accuracy in speaking and writing;\n\ndifferentiate and apply vocabulary for discussion of topics spanning across genres and registers;\n\nexamine and analyze cultural perspectives and products of the German-speaking areas.\n\nRequired Work and Grading: Coursework includes regular homework assignments; active preparation and participation for class discussions and group work; an individual oral presentation; writing assignments (short weekly assignments and two essays); a readers’ response journal; and two exams (mid-term and final).

The focus in the first half of the course will be mainly on the sounds of German: how they are produced and how we transcribe them. We then consider how these sounds have changed over the history of German as reflected in both the standard language and modern dialects. This section will wrap up with a discussion of where German personal, family, and place names come from.\n\nIn the second half of the course we will look at a number of productive processes involved with forming German words. Many of the examples we will consider are words that have entered the language in the last twenty years. We will then look at how words are combined to form phrases and sentences in German. The course will conclude by examining topics broadly dealing with contact between the German and English languages, including youth speech, what is popularly known as “Denglisch“ (English-influenced German), and German varieties spoken in the United States.\n\nGerman 372 – Topics In German Culture: Deutscher Film Und Deutsche Kultur\n\nMWF 11:00-11:50 am 575 Van Hise Hall Jeanne Schueller (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: German 249, 258, and 262; or 249 and 274 or 284; or consent of instructor.\n\nLanguage of instruction: German\n\nThe primary goal of this course is to broaden your knowledge of German culture through the analysis and interpretation of film. This November, Germany will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. We will address this important topic in German cultural history by exploring representations of the Wall and East and West Germany in seven feature films. Contemporary films serve as a springboard for our discussions and assignments. We will consider the historical and cultural contexts of each film and read thematically related fiction and non-fiction texts. Film-specific terminology will be introduced to facilitate our discussion and analysis of the films. The films also provide ample authentic language to help you improve your comprehension of spoken German in various contexts and registers.\n\nUpon completion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nrecognize, recall, and summarize details and filmic elements of films and texts;\n\nidentify and describe themes associated with the Wende;\n\ndescribe, discuss, interpret, and critique films; and\n\nsupport ideas and opinions in speaking and writing with level-appropriate fluency and accuracy.\n\nCourse evaluation will include in-class discussion, participation, and preparation; a film analysis assignment (“Filmtagebuch”) for each film; two tests; a film review; a short in-class presentation, and one paper. Partner, small-group, and whole-class discussions will be in German. Class materials (assignments and readings) will be available for download from Canvas. Films will be viewed outside of class. All films will be available to stream on any device via the UW course management system.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Jeanne Schueller: jmschuel@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 372 –Topics In German Culture: Deutsch als soziale Sprache\n\nTR 1:00-2:15 pm 159 Van Hise Hall Monika Chavez (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: Successful completion of (GERMAN 249, 258, and 262) or (GERMAN 249 and 274) or (GERMAN 249 and 284) or (GERMAN 249 and 285) or consent of instructor.\n\nVirtually all college students of German are familiar with the concepts of grammatical, lexical, and phonological accuracy – and, relatedly, the consequences of inaccuracy. For example, your grade may suffer if you choose the wrong case or word or somebody might not understand you if you mispronounce a word.\n\nHowever, beyond accuracy, there is the notion of appropriateness. What if you use the correct verb endings but choose an inappropriate form of address and are too formal or too informal? What can you put in an email to a professor versus to a friend? What are you supposed to do and talk about at a work-related dinner? When you listen as somebody is talking to you, are you supposed to make sounds or say things, like ‘interessant’? What words are ‘bad’ and in what contexts? Just how bad is it to swear? Why do even the most staid of staid German-speaking TV presenters casually report on Shitstorms? What subtle social messages does your ‘accent’ when you speak German signal to those who listen? What does the lack of a regional accent or dialect – a lack that is common among non-native speakers – mean for you when you try to fit in?\n\nAs children grow into adults, they encounter implicit and explicit ‘regulations’ of how to behave appropriately in their native language. When people learn a foreign language, such as German, much of the language training focuses on grammatical, lexical, and phonological accuracy – even as in a German-speaking environment, it’s in/appropriate behaviors, not only the in/correct choice of case, that can influence a speaker’s social standing. To complicate matters, different from rules that govern grammatical case, it is rare to find absolute consensus on what is and is not appropriate. Often, the ‘rules’ that describe appropriateness are not explicit, neither in speakers’ minds nor in the form of reference works. And ‘rules’ vary according to context and social group.\n\nIn this course, we will explore issues of appropriateness that may affect your participation in German as a social language. We will use research articles, newspaper and magazine articles, published behavior codes (such as the famous ‘Knigge’), videos, advice manuals, and public discourse (such as blogs and comments) to investigate what social ‘rules’ outline appropriateness for native speakers of German and what specific expectations may be held of you, as a non-native speaker. We will also delve into the disagreements and uncertainties that emerge. Most readings will be in German; a minority of (especially research-related) readings will be in English.\n\nWe will combine a meta-approach (exploring and talking about social conventions) with a practice & hands-on approach (practicing and discussing situational behaviors) and also engage in reflection on how social aspects of language use figure into our regular interactions.\n\nAssignments will include regular homework (preparing readings for discussion & for practice in class); small projects (research, interviews, videos, preparing manuals); and reflection (journaling, analytic comparisons, descriptions of diverging and contradictory views.\n\nThere will be no sit-down final exam. Attendance is mandatory, with two absences (the equivalent of one week of classes) allowed without penalty (religious holidays exempted from the attendance requirement, if arranged at the beginning of the semester).\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Monika Chavez: mmchavez@wisc.edu\n\nGerman 391 – German for Graduate Reading Knowledge\n\nTR 9:30-10:45 am 495 Van Hise Hall Salvatore Calomino (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: No previous knowledge of German required. Open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates.\n\nTaught in English\n\nRegular attendance is expected (or contact via email or telephone if attendance not possible)\n\nPlease note the following guidelines on academic honesty:\n\nhttp://students.wisc.edu/saja/misconduct/UWS14.html#points\n\nThis course is intended for those who wish to develop primarily reading skills in German. A thorough presentation of German grammar will be coupled, from the start, with regular practice in reading and translation. Various levels of academic prose will be covered with a twofold goal: participants will develop skills at comprehension in reading expository German in general; individuals will have the opportunity to begin reading German in their own research areas as well.\n\nRequired:\n\nJannach, Hubert and Richard A.

This course will survey immigration (and to a lesser extent, emigration) in various historical periods as well as the present, and consider the reasons, the consequences—for cultures, the language(s), the economy, and so on of these regions—of migration. We will touch on the experience of immigrants and the receiving population as they adjust to their changing culture.\n\nThis is a course in the tradition of liberal arts education. This course particularly encourages students to expand their knowledge of human cultures as they relate to the physical and natural world. In acquiring this knowledge, we will practice a range of 21st-century skills, including: inquiry and analysis; critical and creative thinking; written and oral communication; intercultural knowledge and competence; and ethical reasoning.\n\nThe topic of how migration interacts with the culture of the Netherlands involves many angles. Students are invited write a paper and make a brief presentation in class on a topic that relates to their major academic interests.\n\nStudents who enroll in German 445 will do their reading and writing in Dutch and speak Dutch during the weekly discussion. During TR 1:00-2:15 pm we will meet with the students in German 245 and speak English.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Jolanda Vanderwal Taylor: jvtaylor@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 625 – Letterkunde Der Lage Landen: Winnaars En Verliezers\n\nProf. Jolanda Vanderwal Taylor (4 credits)\n\nSection 001: TR 2:30-3:45 pm 379 Van Hise Hall\n\nDiscussion 301: W 2:25-3:15 pm 479 Van Hise Hall\n\nTaught face-to-face in English (TR 2:30-3:45 pm) and in Dutch (DIS)\n\nParticipants in this course will consider a variety of fascinating texts in English translation selected from Dutch—language literary offerings that take questions about success in life, heroes and anti-heroes, as their topic. The texts we consider will approach these questions from various perspectives and vantage points.\n\nWe will look at the techniques, devices, methods and structures that writers employ to entertain, amuse and educate the reader, to provide an aesthetic experience, to challenge the reader, and to allow readers to consider the “big questions” such as:\n\n*What is success in life? What is the good life? What matters?\n\n*How do we present ourselves to others, and to ourselves?\n\n*What is important: outward appearances? A middle-class lifestyle?\n\n*What does it mean to be honest about oneself, or with oneself? (“Fake news” is an occupation in Dutch cultural life these days). How does a lack of self-reflection or honesty affect the narration of a novel? (–the unreliable narrator)\n\n*Why do characters choose different values than those I aspire to?\n\n*Why do writers decide to select heroes or anti-heroes, winners or losers as the characters in their fiction?\n\n*What questions should readers ask themselves and each other?\n\nThis course invites its participants to read attentively, to think carefully, and to discuss thoughtfully and vigorously, based on a fascinating body of texts.\n\nStudents who enroll in German 625 will do their reading and writing in Dutch and speak Dutch during the weekly discussion.

It examines the Indo-European origin and the subsequent development of the German language in changing cultural and social settings. We examine the origin of standard varieties of German at different periods as well as their relationship to non-standard or regional varieties. In addition, the course provides an introduction to historical linguistics and to various areas of scholarly activities in the field, as well as familiarizing students with basic research methods and bibliographical resources.\n\nStudents will learn:\n\nTo trace the history of words through application of sound laws from Proto-Indo-European to New High German.\n\nTo understand the development of the German morphological and syntactic systems from PIE to NHG.\n\nTo identify dialects of German at each stage in its history.\n\nTo understand the cultural context that has led to the nature of the German language at each stage in its development.\n\nGERMAN 676 (Seminar)/GERMAN 683 (Honors Seminar) – Was ist Deutsch?\n\nT 3:30-6:00 pm 355 Van Hise Hall Hannah Eldridge (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: German 337 & 2 additional advanced German courses or consent of instructor.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, the soccer player Mesut Özil quit the German National Team, citing disrespect and racism and noting that to his critics, “I am German when we win but I am an immigrant when we lose.” To those unfamiliar with Germany’s immigration discussion, this statement is puzzling: how can Özil be an “immigrant” in Germany when he was born in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia? But Özil’s words highlight the complex nature of what it means to be German, as well as the question of who decides which individuals count as German and how. These issues have become especially present in the contemporary so-called refugee crisis, but in fact the question of what it means to be German stretches back into the eighteenth century and before, and it has shaped German language, literature, history, and art. In this course, we will follow the question of what it means to be German in all of those places, including what Germanness was compared to (when being German meant being not-French, or being German rather than Bavarian or Swabian, or German rather than East or West German), both before and after Germany’s founding as a nation in 1871. We will examine moments of intercultural contact, differentiation, conflict, and exchange in poems, novels, short stories, television shows, films, news media, and social media. Students will also reflect on what it means to study German in the U.S. and other locations of so-called Auslands-Germanistik (German Studies abroad), analyze how we understand German “heritage” in the U.S. and elsewhere, and consider their own cultural and linguistic identities.\n\nCourse language (discussion, texts, assignments) is German. All texts will be made available via Canvas.\n\nAuthors include: Yoko Tawada, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Rafik Schami, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, May Ayim, Johann Gottfried Herder, Emine Sevgi Özdamar, Anton Wilhelm Eno, Johann Gottfried Herder, and others.\n\nAssignments and grading:\n\nIn-class participation: 10%\n\nReading response posts: 15%\n\nIn-class presentation: 20%\n\nPaper 1 (historical comparison): 25%\n\nFinal Paper (open topic): 30%\n\nStudents enrolled in German 683 (Honors) will work with the instructor to develop a project that fits their interests and enhances the learning of their classmates.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Hannah Eldridge: heldridge@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 727 – Topics In Applied Linguistics: The Foreign Language Teacher\n\nTR 11:00 am-12:15 pm 495 Van Hise Hall Monika Chavez (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: Graduate/professional standing.\n\nLanguage of instruction: English\n\nThe ‘foreign language teacher’ is the conceptual counterpart to the ‘foreign language student’ both in research and in common thinking. In the context of pedagogy, the two have been linked in a putative cause (‘teacher’s teaching’) – effect (‘student’s learning’) pairing. In this course, we will explore critically the assumptions that follow.\n\nWe will begin with the notion of ‘expertise’ – what it is (or imagined to be) constituted of – relative to the often poorly or contradictorily conceived ‘objectives of teaching’; how it is thought to be delivered, gained, and demonstrated; how it presents in actual individuals; and how it is perceived by students. We will examine what it really is – or can be – that teachers ‘effect’ in their students and, conversely and just as importantly, what students ‘effect’ in their teachers. What is more, we will compare how research has approached the ‘student’ and the ‘teacher’, respectively, as objects of study. For example, the idea that students deserve attention as social individuals and beyond their cognitive processes, is firmly established in contemporary research. In contrast, research has focused on teachers as ‘cognition machines’ that gain, digest, and deliver ‘information’ or ‘skills’; to be trained and placed into professional hierarchies; and among whom individual variation may be perceived as professional deviance. In short, teachers are embedded into normative processes in which they participate willingly or with some degree of resistance; with varying outcomes; and in which their personal and social attributes matter – like it or not – to different stakeholders, including teacher trainers, supervisors, language programs, university structures, professional organizations, and students. In fact, it is not clear what exactly teachers are expected – and capable – of ‘teaching.’ Is it ‘language’ as an abstract concept; ‘communicative skills’ as a rather diffuse idea; ‘mindsets’ – with the goal of ‘producing’ broad-minded trans-/inter-cultural learners; or ‘attitudes’ and ‘motivations’ that induce learners to continue their language studies?\n\nWe will explore these questions & concerns via a survey of available research; the identification of gaps in research & professional debates; the design of research studies that contribute toward filling the gap; and an assessment of assumptions and ideologies that inform how ‘the language teacher’ is constructed in pedagogical training, the curriculum, and in broader social contexts. Assignments include regular readings & class discussions; a pilot research study to outline future research agenda; a conference abstract; a basic design of a future research study; and future graduate course proposals. The class will be conducted in English and students with expertise in all languages are welcome.\n\nFor questions regarding this course please contact Monika Chavez: mmchavez@wisc.edu\n\nGERMAN 755 – Old Germanic Languages: Gothic\n\nR 3:30-6:00 pm 479 Van Hise Hall Katerina Somers (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: Consent of instructor or German 651.\n\nThis course introduces students to the earliest extensively attested Germanic language, Gothic.\n\nCourse objectives include:\n\nStudents will be able to read and translate Gothic texts into English or German.\n\nStudents will develop detailed knowledge of Gothic phonology, morphology and lexicon.\n\nStudents will be able to compare Gothic to other early Germanic languages\n\nStudents will become acquainted with the most important tools for research in Gothic.\n\nStudents will identify the most outstanding research questions in Gothic scholarship.\n\nOur main extant textual evidence for Gothic derives from the translations of the New Testament and fragments of the Old Testament by the bishop Wulfila (ca. 311- ca. 383) which are preserved for us in manuscripts originating during the period of Ostrogothic rule of Italy (493-554). Because of the early geographic separation of the Goths from the Germanic homeland and the archaic origin of our texts, Gothic provides us with much valuable information about the structure of early Germanic. The course will therefore be highly comparative in nature, constantly contrasting Gothic with other early Germanic languages (Old High German, Old Saxon, Old English, Old Norse). Students will be expected to gain proficiency in translating Gothic texts, to learn to decipher the Gothic script, and to acquire knowledge of the external history of the Goths.\n\nThis course assumes no prior knowledge of early Germanic languages, though some familiarity with the history of Germanic will prove useful.\n\nGERMAN 755 – Readings in Middle High German (1180-1300)\n\nTR 1:00-2:15 pm 575 Van Hise Hall Salvatore Calomino (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: Consent of instructor or German 651. Open to graduate students and qualifying seniors.\n\nKnowledge of an older German dialect helpful.\n\nTaught in English with optional work in modern German.\n\nRegular attendance is expected (or contact via email or telephone if attendance not possible)\n\nPlease note the following guidelines on academic honesty:\n\nhttp://students.wisc.edu/saja/misconduct/UWS14.html#points\n\nThis course is devoted to reading and discussion of major literary works from the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries in Middle High German. Selections will feature the following works: Hartmann von Aue, Iwein; Wolfram von Eschenbach, Parzival; Gottfried von Strassburg Tristan; an example of Dietrichepik; pertinent selections from Minnesang. Class time will be spent on discussion, interpretation, and stylistic analysis of passages from each work.

Venkat Mani (3 credits)\n\nPrerequisites: Graduate/professional standing.\n\nSee description for German 947.\n\nGERMAN 947 (Seminar) – Exiles, Migrants, & Refugees: Text and Contexts\n\nMeets with German 804/History 804/Political Science 804\n\nT 3:30-6:00 pm 378 Van Hise Hall B. Venkat Mani (3 credits)\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION\n\nIn 2018, the UHCR reported 68.5 million forcibly displaced persons worldwide, of which 40 million are internally displaced people, 25 million refugees, and 3 million asylum seekers. The waves of willful and forced migrations caused due to religious conflicts, wars, and climate change among others, and the widely different reactions of the widely different reaction of the international community on the so-called “refugee crisis” since 2015 are manifestations of tumultuous events of twenty-first century. The worldwide resurgence of populism and nationalism, the rhetoric of walls and barbed wires on national borders are manifestations of a much longer history of divisive and discriminatory rhetoric, with roots in European colonialism, ideological divisions of the Cold War, and connected with international power politics, a slow, incessant pressure on natural resources which has led to acknowledgment of the current climate crisis.\n\nFrom the current vantage point, in this seminar we will try to understand the historical contexts that led to the creation of exiles, migrants, and refugees. The aim of the seminar is threefold. First, by engaging with conceptual histories of the terms “exiles,” “migrants,” and “refugees,” we will develop a differentiated understanding of “willful” and “forced” migrations. Second, by refracting German/European examples with those from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, we will try to cultivate a global framework of literary and historical comparison. And third, by locating migrants, refugees, and exiles at the intersection of “world literature” and “global history”—two terms that have gained traction in the twenty-first century scholarship—we will foster a wider and deeper understanding of fault lines of race, ethnicity, sexuality, language, and religion.\n\nReadings for the seminar include texts by thinkers such as Hannah Arendt, Urvashi Butalia, Seyla Benhabib and Edward Said; historians such as Rita Chin, Ayesha Jalal, Mark Mazower, Sebastian Conrad; literary theorists such Debjani Ganguly, Aamir Mufti, Lital Levy; and authors such as Arif Anwar, Jenny Erpenbeck, Sayed Kashua, and Viet Thanh Ngyuen. By reading historical and theoretical texts along with a variety of literary texts: memoirs, poetry, plays, and the novel, we will explore how authors and artists engage with historical events, and subvert, resist, or challenge dominant official narratives by providing alternative, “unauthorized” accounts.\n\nGRADING\n\nThe final grade will be based on the following factors:\n\nAttendance: 20%\n\nActive Participation in the Seminar (Reading/ Viewing texts/films before the class session, and taking part in plenary and small group discussions in the classroom based on completion of prompts posted online): 15%\n\nShort Presentation: 5%\n\nBook Review: Of a literary/ creative non-fiction or a scholarly work on topics covered in the course published in the last five years: 5%\n\nConference abstract: 5%\n\nMid-Term Paper (8 Pages double spaced, 12-point font Times New Roman, in German + One page of Bibliography): 25%\n\nFinal Paper (12 Pages double spaced, 12-point font Times New Roman, in German + One page of Bibliography): 25%\n\nREQUIRED TEXTBOOK, SOFTWARE & OTHER COURSE MATERIALS\n\nRequired Texts (Available for purchase at the University Bookstore AND on reserve at College Library):\n\nAnwar, Arif.
