        "text": "I discovered American poet Hayden Carruth on subrosa here. The poem Sigrun posted was so poignant that I ordered one of Carruth’s collections Scrambled Eggs & Whiskey. I haven’t finished the collection yet and I can’t say that every poem speaks to me but some are stunning.\n\nCalifornia is a poem he dedicated to Adrienne Rich. I particularly liked the third stanza. The poem was probably written in the 90s but what he expresses is just as valid today. Maybe even more so.\n\nCALIFORNIA by Hayden Carruth\n\nfor Adrienne Rich\n\nTo come again into the place of revolutionary\n\nthought after years in the wilderness\n\nof complacency and hard-eyed greed\n\nand brutality\n\nis extraordinary. A’s kitchen\n\nin Santa Cruz\n\nisn’t greatly different from her kitchen in\n\nWest Barnet in the old days,\n\nsmall interesting ornaments here and there,\n\nmany good things to eat—\n\nand how ideas flew from stove to table,\n\nfrom corner to corner. In Santa Cruz\n\nafter twenty-odd years it was the same. Tolstoi said\n\nthe purpose of poetry is to provoke\n\nfeeling in the reader, to “infect” the reader,\n\nhe said,—and so to induce a change,\n\na change of conscience\n\nthat may lead to a change in the world, that will\n\nlead to a change in the world!\n\nHow can poetry be written by people who want no change?\n\nTo be reconciled after so long,\n\nin sunshine, among Latino voices. A. showed me\n\nwhere earthquake two years ago had changed Santa Cruz\n\nand how the people were rebuilding, making it better. Had she\n\nbeen frightened? Of course. Would she move away?\n\nNever. Here earth itself gives us the paradigm.\n\nAnd the great ocean hurling its might always thunderously against\n\nthe land at Half Moon Bay is our measure\n\nof flux and courage\n\nand eternity.\n\nWe drove among hills, redwood and eucalyptus,\n\ndense growth, the richness and ramifying intricacy\n\nof the world’s loveliness, and asked\n\nwhat would be left\n\nfor our grandchildren, already born, when they are\n\nas old as we? No longer do we\n\nneed an insane president to end us\n\nby pushing a button. People\n\nneed only go on living as they are, without change,\n\nthe complacent and hard-eyed\n\neverywhere. At the airport\n\nafter dark\n\namong hard lights\n\nwith the massive proportions of human energy\n\nsurrounding them, two old people\n\nembraced in love of the injured and poor, of poetry,\n\nof the world in its still remaining remote possibilities,\n\nwhich were themselves.\n\nSarah Kirsch, born Ingrid Bernstein, in 1935, in Prussian Saxony was a German poet and artist. She was widely known and appreciated in Germany and received numerous prestigious prices. Quite a lot of her books, like the poetry collection Catlives, have also been translated into English. Sarah Kirsch died in May this year. Taking the name Sarah was a deliberate choice to annoy her father who was an anti-Semite.\n\nAt first I wanted to join Danielle in her Christa Wolf project. She’s reading One Day a Year, Christa Wolf’s diary, for GLM. While looking for the book on my shelves, I came across Sarah Kirsch’s Regenkatze (Raincat), a diary of the years 2003/2004 and started reading it right away. Such a lovely book. But imagine how surprised I was when I found two diary entries dedicated to Christa Wolf’s One Day a Year, which came out in 2003. Obviously they knew each other as they were writers in the former Democratic Republic of Germany, a secluded space, in which everyone was monitored and spied on. According to those diary entries, Wolf wrote about Sarah Kirsch in her diary. Kirsch doesn’t say too much but she’s not keen on Wolf’s book and abandons it after a while saying that she distorted the truth.\n\nRegenkatze is a wonderful book. It has been written by a woman who loved life and enjoyed every moment of it. But she could also be very critical and ironic. She hated anything fake and phony and loved nothing better than reading, writing, cats and nature.\n\nKirsch lived in the country, in a house on her own and occasionally with her son. Her days are quiet and filled with observations of the weather, the trees and plants, her cats. Highlights are book deliveries and plunging into the work of new authors. In 2003 she goes through a Murakami phase and re-reads Proust’s books. But she also enjoys Harry Potter, watches crime on TV and snuggles up with the cat.\n\nI hadn’t read any of her poems before but the way she wrote this diary told me I should. She wrote Regenkatze in a very peculiar way, inventing new words, writing in metaphor’s, breaking up the structure of sentences, adding dialect and spoken language.\n\nIt’s a very engaging book. Her enthusiasm and joy is infectious and I will certainly read more of her.\n\nI leave you with two of her poems from Catlives:\n\nThe Housing\n\nIt is dark in the house water curtains\n\nFlow in front of the windows until Epiphany\n\nWe put up with the Christmas tree\n\nFlames flicker on candle stubs\n\nWind presses the linenfold water\n\nClose to the panes bulbous plants\n\nFlower white blue and pink\n\nDarkness tumbles from corners\n\nSteels over sills creeps into\n\nItself and under the beds\n\nSilence wells up from cupboards and coffers\n\nAnd in the warm and tangible gloom\n\nThrough which I pass as it closes behind me\n\nThat hangs about like violet velvet\n\nRolls itself up and swells and sits in each pot\n\nThe one I love suddenly treats the piano\n\nTo pieces that move me to tears\n\nThe cat treads on her favourite chair\n\nThe drainpipes leak at the\n\nPredetermined spots the carpenter’s\n\nDrunken soul is clattering in the rafters\n\nSnow\n\nHow before our practices eyes\n\nEverything changes the village flies\n\nCenturies back in the snow\n\nAll we need are a couple of crows\n\nPollard willows along the way oldfashioned dogs\n\nLove and faithfulness count you pull me\n\nOver ditches carry my stole little\n\nBundle of wood into the evening\n\nLiving smoke wraps up roofs.\n\nCarol Ann Duffy’s seventh collection is a book-length love poem, and a moving act of personal testimony; but what sets these poems apart is Duffy’s refusal to simplify the contradictions and transformations of love – infatuation, longing, passion, commitment, rancour, separation and grief. Instead, Rapture is a map of real love, in all its churning complexity, showing us that a song can be made of even the most painful episodes in our lives. These are poems that will find deep rhymes in the experience of most readers and will, ultimately, prove that poetry can and should speak for us all.\n\nI like poetry and try to read a poem here and there as often as possible but it’s relatively rare that I read a whole collection in one go. British poet Carol Ann Duffy’s collection Rapture was an exception that’s why I decided to write about it.\n\nI often hear people say they would love to read poetry but feel they need special guidance, an instruction, an interpretation to be able to make the most of a poem. While I certainly like some of the poets which are not so accessible, I thought it was a pleasure to find someone like Carol Ann Duffy who is so readable and whose poems almost read like short stories. Reading her would be a perfect starting point for someone less familiar with reading poetry.\n\nRapture is meant to be read from beginning to end as it does, to some extent, tell a love story, beginning with the early enchanted moments of falling in love and ending with the break-up and loss of the loved person.\n\nWhat appealed to me in Duffy’s poems is the combination of strong imagery and ideas. The words she chooses create pictures in the mind, are very sensual but at the same time they lead to intellectual discoveries. Another element which seems typical for her and makes her so accessible, is the combination of the mundane with lyrical descriptions of nature. Love in these poems is rooted in daily life but also experienced as pure beauty and enchantment. Duffy writes a lot of almost magical poems describing exalted states but she doesn’t shy away from writing about the sudden importance of text messages.\n\nI haven’t read any others of her collections so far but it seems every book has a theme which runs through it. The themes are different from one book to the next, but images return and weave a world of their own.\n\nThe collection I bought, is the Picador collection which you can see above. The cover is very pretty, it’s not as red as on the photo. The picture of the branch of a fig tree, with leaves and fruits, is embossed on it.\n\nI find it very hard to review a poetry collection and think it might be better to let the poems speak for themselves. Here are three of my favourite poems of this collection:\n\nName\n\nWhen did your name\n\nchange from a proper noun\n\nto a charm?\n\nRiver\n\nDown by the river, under the trees, love waits for me\n\nto walk from the journeying years of my time and arrive.\n\nI part the leaves and they toss me a blessing of rain.\n\nThe river stirs and turns consoling and fondling itself\n\nwith watery hands, its clear limbs parting and closing.\n\nGrey as a secret, the heron bows its head on the bank.\n\nI drop my past on the grass and open my arms, which ache\n\nas though they held up this heavy sky, or had pressed\n\nagainst window glass all night as my eyes sieved the stars;\n\nopen my mouth, wordless at last meeting love at last, dry\n\nfrom travelling so long, shy of a prayer. You step from the shade,\n\nand I feel love come to my arms and cover my mouth, feel\n\nmy soul swoop and ease itself into my skin, like a bird\n\nthreading a river. Then I can look love full in the face, see\n\nwho you are I have come this far to find, the love of my life.\n\nTea\n\nI like pouring your tea, lifting\n\nthe heavy pot, and tipping it up,\n\nso the fragrant liquid streams in your china cup.\n\nOr when you’re away, or at work,\n\nI like to think of your cupped hands as you sip,\n\nas you sip, of the faint half-smile of your lips.\n\nI like the questions – sugar? – milk? –\n\nand the answers I don’t know by heart, yet,\n\nfor I see your soul in your eyes, and I forget.\n\nJasmine, Gunpowder, Assam, Earl Grey, Ceylon,\n\nI love tea’s names. Which tea would you like? I say\n\nbut it’s any tea for you, please, any time of day,\n\nas the women harvest the slopes\n\nfor the sweetest leaves, on Mount Wu-Yi,\n\nand I am your lover, smitten, straining your tea.\n\nWhile browsing the internet to do a bit of research on this collection I found an interesting article by Jeanette Winterson from 2005 in which she deplores that Carol Ann Duffy is not poet laureate. I’m sure Jeanette Winterson is pleased that this has changed. Carol Ann Duffy holds the title since 2009.\n\nDo you have a favourite poem or poet?"
