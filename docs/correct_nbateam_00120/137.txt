The Sacramento Kings are only a few months removed from nearly moving to Anaheim, but they have had a reprieve as the city of Sacramento works to help resolve their arena situation. In the meantime, the Kings enter the soon to be truncated 2011 NBA offseason looking to fill some holes in free agency and figure out what is going to happen with center Samuel Dalembert.

The Kings have five free agents this offseason with one of them restricted and four unrestricted:

Restricted: Marcus Thornton

Unrestricted: Samuel Dalembert, Marquis Daniels, Darnell Jackson, Pooh Jeter

Under restricted free agency, offer sheets signed by these players can be matched by the incumbent team. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with whatever team has the salary cap space or exception to do so.

The Kings are expected to do what it takes to lock up Thornton, and his restricted status makes that significantly easier. Dalembert on the other head is reportedly interested in taking his talents to South Beach. He was a solid rebounder for the Kings, but the team has solid young talent in the front court and probably will not get into any bidding for Dalembert. The team will look for contributions across the board, but DeMarcus Cousins will be relied on heavily in the paint.
