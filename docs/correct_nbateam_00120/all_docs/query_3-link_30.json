The 6-foot-11 center averaged 8.1 points and 8.3 rebounds over eight seasons. He was unhappy with his role and asked for a trade last year.\n\nNocioni, a 6-foot-7 forward, averaged 8.5 points for the Kings last season. He was suspended two games in March after pleading no contest in California to drunken driving.\n\nHawes, a 7-foot-1 center, averaged 10 points and 6.1 rebounds last season. He was Sacramento's first-round draft pick in 2007.\n\nNocioni and Hawes join a rebuilding team that missed the playoffs last season and has the No. 2 overall pick in next week's draft.\n\nDalembert was scheduled to earn nearly $13 million in the final year of his contract. He has a 15 percent trade kicker in his deal. That clause made it difficult for the Sixers to trade him sooner."
