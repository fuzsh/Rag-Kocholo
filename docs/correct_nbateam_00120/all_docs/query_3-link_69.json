        "text": "Samuel Dalembert, a longtime NBA player and Seton Hall star, is facing two counts of battery.\n\nThe incident began late Sunday night with a 911 call. Dispatch said a woman who sounded out of breath said her toddler accidentally dialed 911.\n\nPolice responded to Dalembert's home in Boca Raton.\n\nA probable cause affidavit from the Boca Raton Police Department says Dalembert got into an argument with his girlfriend and her cousin. The girlfriend told police he became physically and verbally abusive toward her when she wanted to take their children to Orlando. The woman told police she was in fear of her life due to Dalembert's size. Her cousin told officers Dalembert choked him and shoved the girlfriend to the couch\n\nThe arresting officer also noticed an abrasion, swollen lip and bruise on the woman's forehead. She told officers she and Dalembert fell while walking into their house after drinking.\n\nThe officer also made note of the front door which had been smashed in. The girlfriend told the officer she didn't want to tell what happened because she'd get into trouble. Dalembert told officers he noticed the door damaged after waking up from a nap. He told the officer the door \"was old\" and probably damaged \"by the weather.\"\n\nDeputies with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office booked Dalembert early Monday. He appeared in court hours later.\n\nDalembert, a 6'11\" 255 lb. center, played for six teams after being drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers in 2001."
