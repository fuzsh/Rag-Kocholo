        "text": "Dalembert is also entering the last season of his contract, placing almost no pressure on the front office to hope he performs wellâ€”they could just let him walk next summer and find themselves sitting on almost $13 million in cap room.\n\nToo bad this isn't an article for the Kings.\n\nThe 76ers, namely Ed Stefanski, have shown me that they are in no way trying to bring a winning product to this city and only strengthen that with such a puzzling trade.\n\nWhile Hawes has shown his flashes of being a serviceable big man, he all-too-often finds himself being bullied in the post. This will become a huge problem in the Eastern Conference as he must face the likes of Dwight Howard or Kendrick Perkins.\n\nThe real surprise here is the contract of Nocioni and the baggage it brings along. The 30-year-old small forward is still owed roughly $21 million over the next three years with the third year being a team option.\n\nThis isn't a team that will be competing for a championship next season, so why not sit on Dalembert's contract for one more season and then have yourself, as I said before, $13 million in room to work with under the cap rather than taking on another bad contract?\n\nIt's all a blur at this point, but it should come full circle come draft night where the 76ers could take a turn for the better with the number two overall pick, or find themselves traveling down a long dark road to another set of disappointing seasons."
