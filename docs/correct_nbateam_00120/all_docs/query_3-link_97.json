        "text": "The New York Knicks are \"actively trying\" to trade center Samuel Dalembert, according to Marc Stein of ESPN.\n\nDalembert was traded to the Knicks in June, along with Jose Calderon and Shane Larkin, in the deal that sent Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton to the Dallas Mavericks. He opened the season as the Knicks' starting center, but has since fallen out of the rotation and is averaging 4.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 17.0 minutes per game.\n\nOnly $1.85 million of his $3.8 million deal for this season is guaranteed, and non-guaranteed NBA contracts become fully guaranteed on Saturday. According to the New York Post, that stipulation applies to Dalembert. If he was waived before Saturday, the Knicks would save the non-guaranteed $2 million and open up a roster spot.\n\n• Amar'e Stoudemire on losses: 'It's beyond imagination'\n\nDalembert has sat out the Knicks' last four games due to a sprained ankle, though he was reportedly ready to play before Sunday's 95-82 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Cole Aldrich has been starting in his place and has scored in double-digits in six of his last seven games.\n\n\"I love the team we have,\" Dalembert said, according to NorthJersey.com. \"Unfortunately, we're going through what we are going through. Great organization. … I would love for my career to be over here and finish here. But it's business. A lot of the time it's beyond your control — what can happen. So we'll see what's going on. Do the best you can do and see what happens.\"\n\n• Power Rankings: Hawks soar, Raptors take tumble\n\nThe Knicks (5-31) have lost 11 straight, continuing the worst start in franchise history. They will play the Grizzlies in Memphis on Monday.\n\n- Mike Fiammetta"
