Would Denver consider Dalambert as a cheap replacement for Mosgov to give them a bit of veteran depth?\n\nDallas are supposedly chasing JO so could they resign Big Sam?\n\nReal left field suggestion is Philly claim him off waivers. They need to get the cap level up or pay the difference so maybe resign a bit of a franchise legend to help use up a bit of cap space. I’m sure the Philly fans still like Sam and he’d be a useful veteran presence on a very young roster.\n\nCavs might make an offer but they have just signed Mosgov.

I’m sure the Philly fans still like Sam and he’d be a useful veteran presence on a very young roster.\n\nWith Larry Sanders’ future in flux with the Bucks, I could see them having some interest since he played with them a few years back. They’re in the playoff hunt in the East, and they’ve done a good job hanging on with Parker going out, but having another big guy on the bench always helps later in the season.\n\nI think he could give better minutes than Johnny O’Bryant too.\n\nWith Larry Sanders’ future in flux with the Bucks, I could see them having some interest since he played with them a few years back.
