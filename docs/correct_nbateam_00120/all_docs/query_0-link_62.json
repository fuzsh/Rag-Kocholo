        "text": "Many were the nights over the last two seasons when I prayed for a deal--any deal--to rid the Philadelphia 76ers of Samuel Dalembert, the seven-footer who had manned the middle for the team for the better part of the last decade. After the '07-'08 season, where he averaged a double-double and looked like a key (if still highly flawed) piece of the Sixers' suddenly playoff-bound future, he steadily proved to any remaining doubters that he was simply not a starting pivot on a legitimately quality NBA team.\n\nHe couldn't handle really physical big men in the post or keep up with speedy guards on help defense. His rebounding was skilled but highly erratic, grabbing 16 boards one game and four the next. He sulked when he didn't get his offensive touches, and constantly reinforced why his teammates should have avoided feeding him the ball at all costs when he did--an utter lack of a polished offensive game, an awkward shooting stroke, an inability to finish at the rim, a poor passing instinct and general low basketball IQ, and worst of all, a complete unwillingness to recognize his deficits in any of these areas.\n\nYes, I think it's safe to say that none of us wanted to see the Haitian Sensation in this season's starting lineup. But I'm not sure we wanted his departure to come in the circumstances that they ultimately have.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings, for whatever reason, have been coveting Dalembert's steely presence at center for some time now--it might just come down to that rumored Willie Green quote about Sam, \"Well, at least he's tall\"--and it appears they have finally gotten their wish. Today, Dalembert was sent to Sacramento in exchange for gritty swingman Andres Nocioni and skilled big man Spencer Hawes. Nocioni, who wanted out of Sac-town himself, is known for his physical defense and nice three-point touch, (shooting 39% from deep last season), while Hawes has a solid inside-out game for a seven-footer. On the surface, this would at the least seem a cosmetic upgrade from the inconsistent and clunky Dalembert.\n\nBut as we alluded to earlier here, there are ramifications to the deal, starting with the swap in salaries. As unwieldy as Dalembert's cap hit was going to be this season (a hefty $12.2 mil, plus a few more going to the Kings in a trade kicker), it was to be his last season as a Liberty Baller, giving the team some sweet relief in the off-season, as well as a valuable trade chip should the Sixers (unlikely as it may seem) be anywhere near contention at the deadline. Noc, on the other hand, is signed through '12 at an overpriced mean of near $7 mil a year, essentially clogging the cap for another year, and eliminating any real chance they had of making a big move before the '11-12 season.\n\nAnd for what, exactly? Nocioni is a nice complementary player, and he'll give the team some needed toughness to help fill the gaping void left last off-season by the departure of Reggie Evans, but he's no game-breaker, and he shot just 40% from the field last year coming off the bench for a terrible Sacramento team. And while it's nice to get a look at a young talent like Hawes (still just 22, and only under contract for one year and a reasonable $3 mil), his rebounding and defensive stats are fairly soft for a seven-footer, and it doesn't speak particularly highly of your usefulness when your original team gives up on you after three years in exchange for an overpriced toothpick that plays the same position that you do. Any expectations heaped on these two noobs should be taken with a couple shakers' worth of salt.\n\nBut the real consequences of the deal will come at draft night. The arrival of Nocioni now gives the team a glut of wing players and, unless the team believes Hawes to be the Sixers' center of the future (and possibly even if they do), a sudden pressing need for big men. This could mean one of two things regarding the Sixers' #2 pick. One is that they might be planning to take Georgia Tech big man Derrick Favors (technically a PF, but with measurements similar to Dwight Howard's) with the #2 pick over consensus choice Evan Turner. The other is that they never planned on holding onto the pick, and are considering dealing it to a team like Minnesota in exchange for a slightly lower pick where other bigs like DeMarcus Cousins, Al-Farouq Aminu or Greg Monroe might still be available, or an athletic wing like Wesley Johnson if they wanted to go that route.\n\nIs this a bad thing? Not necessarily. The talk on Favors is still very high, and most pundits list his upside as being higher than Turner's (though few doubt that the latter will be more of a contributor from day one). It's possible that ifi the team is truly in rebuilding mode, that Favors might be the prudent long-term pick anyway--or that a deal for another young piece like either of the Wolves' young big men (Kevin Love or Al Jefferson), combined with some possible cap relief, might ultimately be the smartest option.\n\nBut I'm still not sold on the simplest move--just taking Turner and letting the pieces sort themselves out--not being the right one here. Favors gives the team a ton in terms of long-term potential, but he doesn't give the team much in terms of first-option scoring and on-the-floor leadership--the two things the team most badly lacks, and the two most seem to believe that Turner will be able to provide the team, almost right away. Favors might get there eventually, but he might not, and if he comes in with the high expectations of the #2 pick and (understandably) takes some time to adjust, who knows what his development will end up being like?\n\nThis is a debate with no easy answer, and one we'll likely continue to have for the week leading up to the June 24th draft. But I just hope that a deal as relatively inconsequential as this--unless Hawes exceeds his very best-case scenario, it's unlikely that this trade will mean as much as a five-game swing one way or the other for the team in the next year or two--doesn't end up being the deciding factor in taking Favors over Turner, or in trading the pick down, a potentially franchise-altering move that could quickly end up defining the next decade of Sixers basketball.\n\nAnd while we're here, I may as well acknowledge the fact that as infuriated as Sammy D made me on a semi-nightly basis, there were some times that were good. He went on a surge midway through the last season--around the time of the Haiti earthquake, though certainly not as a direct result of that--that saw him play about as well as any big in the league, posting double-digit rebounds in 16 games out of 17, including two 20-plus board efforts. Plus, he was always fairly decent at finishing alley-oops, he was usually good for a couple blocks a game, and for a seven-footer, he was surprisingly solid from the free-throw line, shooting over 70% the last five years. And by all accounts, he was also a genuinely good guy. So as flawed as Sammy was, and as cringe-worthy as he could be at times, he wasn't a player so toxic that we should unreservedly celebrate his departure regardless of context.\n\nIt's not a terrible trade, certainly, and there's a good chance that Nocioni and Hawes could end up being real pieces for this team over the next season or two. But I just hope that Stefanski and Collins don't see this as the first domino in a series of moves that will come to define the next era in Sixers history, because it isn't and it shouldn't be. It's difficult to put your trust in a team that's made as many questionable decisions as this team has made the past few years, but we don't have much choice but to have a little faith that this team is going to know what they're doing come June 24th, and possibly beyond.\n\nIn the meantime, though, a mildly fond farewell to one Samuel Dalembert, and the 582 games he played in a Sixers uni. Take a moment, why not, to relive the good...\n\n..and the bad...\n\nSo long, sweet (Port-Au-)Prince."
