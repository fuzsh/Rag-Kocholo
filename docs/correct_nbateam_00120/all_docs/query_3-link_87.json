        "text": "Samuel Dalembert was the only Maverick who didn’t play Saturday night, but he was the last to leave the locker room.\n\nWhile his teammates showered, dressed and left American Airlines Center after the decisive home win over Milwaukee, Dalembert stayed and got in a workout.\n\nWhile his teammates were given Sunday off, Dalembert planned to return to AAC to get in another workout. Rather than sulk, this was 32-year-old veteran center Dalembert’s response to losing playing time.\n\n“I come in early, I practice hard and I keep on working and working,” he said. “I’m just going to have to keep doing more.”\n\nSaturday’s return of Brandan Wright from a shoulder injury means the Mavericks for the first time this season have their full complement of centers and power forwards.\n\nWright backs up both positions. His 19-point, six-rebound performance against Milwaukee served notice that he’ll be taking minutes that were delegated elsewhere during the season’s first 23 games.\n\nDirk Nowitzki was out with an illness Saturday, so many of Wright’s 19 minutes came at power forward. But if last season is an indication, most of his future minutes will come at center, where, six games ago, Dalembert lost his starting spot to DeJuan Blair.\n\nDalembert said he was surprised he didn’t play at all against the Bucks, but as he quietly dressed in the otherwise empty locker room, he said, “I’m so happy for Brandan to come back. That’s going to be a good addition for us.”\n\nDalembert signed a two-year, $7.5 million deal during the summer. At the time, he talked about how excited he was to come to a franchise that wanted him and gave him a clear understanding of his role.\n\nTwo weeks before training camp, he pulled one of his hamstrings. He fell during training camp and hurt his back. Coach Rick Carlisle noted that Dalembert was out of shape but finished the preseason strong. Through 13 games averaged a solid 9.2 points and 7.8 rebounds.\n\nAt that point, he was playing through bruised ribs, largely because the Mavericks were short-handed in the middle. In his last 10 games, Dalembert is averaging 4.7 points and 4.8 rebounds. He said in hindsight perhaps he should have sat out a couple of games.\n\n“It’s like being on 1½ wheels, you know?” he said.\n\nHe said his ribs are fine now. Though he’s been taking medication after tightness returned in his lower back, he said he is moving well and expected to play against Memphis after a lengthy post-practice talk with Carlisle on Friday.\n\nAsked whether communication has been good with Carlisle, Dalembert said, “This, today, was unexpected. We had good communication before about certain things that he wanted. I started to do them in games. Then certain things he asked in the beginning, he switched back and said, ‘OK, this is what I want now.’\n\n“You know, communication is kind of there. It’s just that sometimes you’re kind of confused.”\n\nCarlisle missed the Milwaukee game because of illness. Monte Mathis, who took over head coaching duties against the Bucks, said he intended to use Dalembert, but Blair, Wright and Bernard James played well. Mathis didn’t think it was right to insert Dalembert in the fourth quarter of a blowout.\n\nDalembert said he has been in the NBA long enough to know that there are peaks and valleys. While he and Carlisle try to figure out why his performance has dropped, Dalembert will continue getting in extra workouts and watching videotape.\n\n“When things are not working out and I’m not doing something to the satisfaction of the coach, I just keep on going back and doing it harder,” he said.\n\nFollow Brad Townsend on Twitter at @Townbrad"
