        "text": "Rocky Widner/Getty Images\n\nDuring the 2013 NBA offseason, the Dallas Mavericks signed center Samuel Dalembert to a two-year deal worth roughly $7.5 million. At the time, the popular theory was that the Mavericks were attempting to find a replacement for departed center Tyson Chandlerâ€”a move more than two years in the making.\n\nThe question is: why can't the Mavericks rely on Dalembert in 2013-14?\n\nDalembert is a 12-year veteran who has spent time with the Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Sacramento Kings. In that time, he's developed a reputation as one of the more reliable big men in the NBA, albeit without the flash of a star.\n\nThus far during his tenure in Dallas, he hasn't been reliable. Instead, Dalembert has failed to live up to the standards set for him.\n\nDalembert is averaging 21.1 minutes per contest. Through two full months of basketball, he's seen his playing time progressively decrease.\n\nIt's become clear that the Mavericks and head coach Rick Carlisle are having a difficult time trusting the veteran big man. What's gone wrong thus far?\n\nDefining Necessary Role\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images\n\nWhen the Mavericks won the 2011 NBA championship, the key to their success was a mixture of three-point shooting and interior defensive prowess. Since losing Tyson Chandler via free agency, however, Dallas has struggled to protect the rim.\n\nChandler was a defensive anchor for Dallas in 2010-11, but Dallas has spent the 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons with the New York Knicks. In that time, Dallas has been unable to replace Chandler with an adequate starting 5.\n\nThis past summer, the Mavericks attempted to find Chandler lite in Dalembert.\n\nChris Kaman had the ability to be that player, but injuries plagued that experiment in 2012-13.\n\nDalembert has made a career out of crashing the boards, protecting the rim and serving as a reliable source of offense. He was never a star offensive player, but he has a career average of 7.9 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks on 52.1 percent shooting from the field and 70.6 percent from the charity stripe.\n\nHis numbers have been relatively strong in 2013-14, but he hasn't been the player that Dallas needs him to be.\n\nThe Mavericks need Dalembert to be a shot-blocker who protects the rim with proficiency, provides quality complementary offense and crashes the boards on both ends. He's long been able to do just that, but the value just hasn't been on display against Dallas.\n\nIt all starts with his inability to protect the rim.\n\nFailing to Protect the Rim\n\nAs previously alluded to, Dalembert's purpose in Dallas is to be a rim-protecting big man. Thus far, he's failed to live up to the hype, despite receiving a number of different opportunities to prove his worth.\n\nJust check the numbers.\n\nAccording to NBA.com, Dalembert is allowing opponents to shoot 52.8 percent when he meets them at the rim. That's especially concerning considering Dalembert faces 6.9 of such attempts per game.\n\nUntil he improves, the Mavericks will continue to be exploited defensively.\n\nBrandan Wright is a very strong player, but the Mavericks are relatively thin when it comes to interior defense. DeJuan Blair is a 6'7\" power forward who spends time at center, Dirk Nowitzki has never been known for his defense and Bernard James receives limited playing time.\n\nFor that reason, Dallas needs to be able to trust Dalembert with roughly 25 minutes per contest. As a team in the postseason hunt, that need greatly improves.\n\nIt all starts with the 32-year-old developing more consistency in protecting the rim. A shot-blocker is a valuable thing to have, but Dalembert must improve to the point of allowing opponents to shoot 45.0 percent or worse at the rim.\n\nUntil then, the Mavericks are in a dangerous position.\n\nPatience is Key\n\nBefore fans label Dalembert as a player who can't help this team win games, it's important to display patience. Wright may overtake him as the full-time starter, but Dalembert still deserves significant playing time for Dallas as the season progresses.\n\nIf for no other reason, the Mavericks lack an adequate replacement.\n\nAs previously alluded to, every other big man on the roster has their own faults defensively. Wright has proved capable of posting highly-efficient minutes, but when it comes to providing size and defensive prowess down low, Dalembert has the strongest track record.\n\nDalembert is currently averaging 6.2 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 21.1 minutes. He's shooting 56.5 percent from the floor and 78.2 percent from the free-throw line, helping to create a positive Player Efficiency Rating of 15.93."
