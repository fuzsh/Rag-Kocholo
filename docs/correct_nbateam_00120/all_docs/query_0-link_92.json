        "text": "Thu, Jun 17, 2010 at 7:05pm\n\nDALEMBERT FOR HAWES, NOCIONI\n\nThe Sacramento Kings acquired center Samuel Dalembert from the Philadelphia 76ers for center Spencer Hawes and forward Andres Nocioni.\n\nWhat does it give the Sacramento Kings\n\nThe Kings have been looking to get tougher under the basket for awhile now, and to that end Dalembert is exactly what they need. A big, bruising defensive power player who can dominate with boards and blocks, he should start for them in the middle. They take on some added salary for next season but also get rid of Nocioni's big deal (which has one year more on it than Dalembert's) and find a taker for the talented young Hawes, who had fallen out of favor.\n\nWhat does it give the Philadelphia 76ers\n\nHawes has the most raw talent of the three players in this deal, so potentially could be a steal here for Philly. The expensive Dalembert wanted a bigger role and gets it in Sacto, and while Hawes is more of a finesse center he has the goods to eventually be an All-Star. He lost focus last season but is still very young, and should push for rotation minutes right away with the Sixers (although may not start anytime soon due to the team's big-man depth). Nocioni brings veteran grit, clutch play, and the ability to score and rebound well off the bench--all qualities Philly's young team can use more of."
