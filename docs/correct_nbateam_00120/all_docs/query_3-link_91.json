        "text": "Samuel Dalembert had 18 points and 20 rebounds, and Andre Miller and Andre Iguodala also had double-doubles to lead the 76ers to a 99-94 win over the Indiana Pacers last night in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Sixers won only hours after they learned power forward Elton Brand needed season-ending surgery on his right shoulder. The Sixers improved to 11-8 this season without Brand, an encouraging sign their playoff push will continue without their $80 million man.\n\nMore games like this one will help. All five starters reached double-digits in scoring by the fourth quarter and the 76ers held off the pesky Pacers to avoid a third straight fourth-quarter meltdown.\n\nMiller had 13 points and 12 assists, while Iguodala had 20 points and 11 assists to help the Sixers snap a two-game losing streak.\n\nMike Dunleavy led the Pacers with 21 points, and Danny Granger and Jarret Jack each scored 18 as Indiana dropped its third straight.\n\nThe Sixers wanted a strong showing on their seven-game homestand to throw them in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race. They opened with a win, then lost in two of the most agonizing ways any team can lose. They missed their final 18 shots from the floor and coughed up a fourth-quarter lead in a loss against New Jersey. Then they led the entire fourth against the NBA-best Celtics until Ray Allen won it with a 3-pointer with five-tenths of a second left.\n\nPhiladelphia nearly blew it again against Indiana.\n\nThe Sixers opened the fourth with an 11-point lead and watched it quickly whittle away. Troy Murphy scored on a driving layup and Dunleavy followed with a 3-pointer to pull Indiana within two.\n\nDalembert, though, went up strong under the basket for a basket and Miller added a layup to make it a six-point game and give the Sixers some breathing room down the stretch. The often-erratic Dalembert abused Indiana down low and was only two rebounds shy of his career high.\n\nAll the Sixers needed out of Dalembert with Brand around was for him to block shots and rebound. Now they really need him to score and he delivered a bruising 6-for-13 effort from the floor and 6-for-6 from the free-throw line.\n\nThe Sixers seemed to put the disappointment of losing Brand, who’s having surgery Monday, behind them. All the Sixers got in the first year of a five-year, $80 million contract from Brand was 13.8 points and 8.8 rebounds in only 29 games.\n\nElsewhere in the NBA – Orlando traded shooting guard Keith Bogans to Milwaukee for point guard Tyronn Lue after the Southeast Division-leading Magic lost All-Star Jameer Nelson to a serious shoulder injury.\n\nThe Bucks, who also got cash in the deal, are without top scorer Michael Redd for the rest of the season after he tore ligaments in his left knee in a win against Sacramento on Jan. 24.\n\nForward Chris Bosh (sprained right knee) will travel with the Toronto Raptors to New Orleans but is listed as doubtful for tonight’s game against the Hornets."
