        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. — Sacramento Kings centre Samuel Dalembert could be out for six weeks with a strained left groin muscle, likely forcing him to miss his first regular-season game in five years.\n\nDalembert underwent an MRI on Tuesday, and the Kings said their off-season acquisition will be out four to six weeks.\n\nDalembert, who hails from Montreal, has played in 354 consecutive games, the NBA’s third-longest active streak. He spent his first eight NBA seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nDalembert still hasn’t played in the pre-season for the Kings, who acquired him last June in a trade for Andres Nocioni and Spencer Hawes.\n\nDalembert’s injury could create more playing time for rookie DeMarcus Cousins, the Kings’ selection with the fifth pick in the draft."
