        "text": "The news media always misinterpreted George H. W. Bush. During the 1988 Presidential campaign, many commentators mistook his preppy appearance and goofy manner for weakness. Newsweek ran a cover story called “Fighting the Wimp Factor.” Even people inside Bush’s campaign took this perception seriously. I covered the campaign, and I remember watching Bush prepare for a televised debate and witnessing the late Roger Ailes tell him to stop waving his hands around, because it made him look like “a pansy.”\n\nThis was someone who, during the Second World War, enlisted in the U.S. Navy and trained as a pilot. Flying in a torpedo bomber from the decks of an aircraft carrier, he flew fifty-eight combat missions over the Pacific, and during one of them he was shot down. For his service, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. To label him a wimp was ridiculous.\n\nNow, in death, Bush is being misrepresented again (especially on cable television) as a saintly figure and as one of the truly great U.S. Presidents. He was neither. Running for Senate in 1964, he opposed the Civil Rights Act. In the 1988 Presidential race, when he defeated Michael Dukakis, his campaign, under the direction of Lee Atwater, pioneered many of the slash-and-burn tactics that disfigure modern elections. (The racist Willie Horton ad was but one of many misleading attacks that the Bush campaign launched.)\n\nNo saint, then, but in recent days many have argued that he was the right President at the right time. With the Soviet Union imploding, the primary challenge facing the country was foreign policy, which was Bush’s strength. When he took office, he had already served as Vice-President, head of the C.I.A., U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and chief of the U.S. Liaison’s Office in China. Between 1989 and 1991, he presided artfully over the end of the Cold War. The defining characteristic of his political career, however, was good fortune rather than greatness.\n\nHe was lucky to be born into a wealthy political dynasty. Bush’s grandfather, Samuel Prescott Bush, was a successful Ohio industrialist who did business with the Rockefellers and the Harrimans. His father, Prescott Sheldon Bush, was a Republican senator from Connecticut. From Greenwich Country Day School, to Andover, to Yale (where he followed his father into the Skull & Bones society), Bush led a life of privilege and access. Or, as the Texan Democrat Ann Richards famously remarked, at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, “he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.”\n\nHe was also lucky that Ronald Reagan selected him as his running mate, in 1980. After a hard-fought primary campaign, relations between the two were fraught. “Among Reagan’s advisers, [Lynn] Nofziger and [William] Casey viewed Bush as a liberal, and others were almost unanimously against him, some even contemptuous,” Richard Allen, another adviser to Reagan, recalled in an article from 2000. Going into the G.O.P. Convention, Reagan’s team was negotiating with Gerald Ford, the former President, to form a “dream ticket.” Only after negotiations with Ford broke down did Reagan change his mind. On the third night of the Convention, still needing someone to share his ticket, he called Bush and asked if he would publicly endorse his entire program. Despite having described Reagan’s signature tax-cut program as “voodoo economics,” Bush agreed.\n\nAs President, perhaps his biggest achievement in office was his role in the reunification of Germany, which some U.S. allies, including Britain and France, originally opposed. Acting in consultation with James Baker, his Secretary of State, Brent Scowcroft, his national-security adviser, and Condoleezza Rice, who headed the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe desk at the National Security Council, Bush broke with London and Paris. He made it clear that as long as the new Germany remained a member of NATO the United States wouldn’t oppose reunification. Over the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, paid him tribute, saying he “recognized and understood our desire for the unity of Germany.”\n\nStill, Bush’s role needs putting in perspective. It was clear at the time that the central player in the historic changes that swept Eastern Europe was Mikhail Gorbachev. Bush’s role was to welcome these changes and provide stable U.S. leadership as the old Communist adversary imploded. In 1990, he spoke in idealistic terms about a new world order in which “the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.” In practice, however, he believed in preserving U.S. global hegemony through U.S.-led alliances and international institutions, but also by force if necessary.\n\nWhen Saddam Hussein challenged the U.S.-backed oil monarchies of the Gulf by occupying Kuwait, Bush and Baker constructed a broad military alliance to confront him. In early 1991, after U.S.-led forces routed Saddam’s occupying army, Bush authorized devastating air attacks on the fleeing Iraqis, which killed thousands of troops who were heading back home. Later on, when the Kurds and the Shia inside Iraq rose up against Saddam, Bush initially left them to their bloody fate, which included attacks from the dictator’s helicopter gunships. In retrospect, the decision not to proceed to Baghdad was almost certainly the right one. But this was old-fashioned Realpolitik rather than the dawn of a new era.\n\nIn early 1991, Bush’s approval ratings were close to ninety per cent, but then his good fortune ran out as the focus shifted to domestic politics. Working with a Democratic-controlled Congress, he had signed some meaningful legislation, including the revision of the Clean Air Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. As the 1992 election approached, a weak economy and a vigorous primary challenge by Pat Buchanan undermined his popularity. Bill Clinton’s campaign portrayed him as out of touch with ordinary concerns, which wasn’t very hard to do, and a third-party candidate—Ross Perot—siphoned off Republican votes. To his credit, he accepted defeat gracefully. In later years, he became friendly with Clinton, as they coöperated on humanitarian projects, such as helping to rally support for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and the 2005 tsunami in Southeast Asia.\n\nEspecially compared with current occupant of the Oval Office, George H. W. Bush was a dignified figure who served his country steadfastly in war and peace. He represented a center-right, internationalist strain of Republicanism that barely exists today. But it doesn’t make sense to canonize him."
