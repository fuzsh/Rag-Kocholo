While discussing an upcoming documentary both women were eagerly anticipating, they briefly touched upon the film's theme — more specifically, the importance of living life to the fullest, facing your fears, and surrounding yourself with the ones who matter most.\n\nRELATED: All About Jenna Bush Hager's Beautiful Family with Husband Henry Chase Hager\n\nThis topic rang especially true for Hager, who began tearing up as she recalled one of her last moments with her grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush, who passed in 2018.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush's wise words to granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager\n\n\"It reminded me of this evening I spent with my grandpa, and he could barely speak and I was sitting between him and he leaned over to me and he's like, 'Don't forget to enjoy the game,'\" she said sweetly.\n\n\"And it was at the end of his life and at sort of the beginning of mine, relatively,\" Hager continued while tearing up. \"And to hear somebody that had done everything, be like, 'Don't forget to be in it,' to enjoy it, to be part of it, I'll never forget it.\"\n\nThe gravity of Hager's emotion wasn't lost on Kotb, who put everything into perspective for viewers watching at home.\n\n\"You're right,\" Kotb said. \"But what great advice from him because you always wonder at the end, 'What are you saying'? After you lived a whole life, what are you saying at the very end? And that was it.\"\n\nRELATED: Inside Jenna Hager Bush and Her Twin Barbara Bush's Super Sweet Sisterhood"
