        "text": "Object Details\n\nreferenced\n\nBush, George W.\n\nDescription\n\nThe 2004 presidential race was between the Republican incumbent President George W. Bush and his Democratic challenger John Kerry, senator from Massachusetts. Because Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz, was related to the Heinz family who founded a food processing company, a group of New York City Republicans started their own ketchup company to avoid eating Heinz ketchup. Using a label picturing George Washington, W Ketchup was introduced in 2004 with the advertising slogan “You don’t support Democrats. Why should your Ketchup?” (Teresa Heinz was not a majority stakeholder in the Heinz Company.) The product was distributed through internet sales and no proceeds were contributed to political campaigns. The W Ketchup company ceased production in 2015.\n\nID Number\n\n2004.0280.01\n\naccession number\n\n2004.0280\n\ncatalog number\n\n2004.0280.01\n\nObject Name\n\nBottle\n\nPhysical Description\n\nplastic (overall material)\n\nred; white (overall color)\n\nMeasurements\n\noverall: 8 in x 3 in x 1 1/4 in; 20.32 cm x 7.62 cm x 3.175 cm\n\nSee more items in\n\nPolitical History: Political History, Campaign Collection\n\nAmerican Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith\n\nExhibition\n\nAmerican Democracy\n\nExhibition Location\n\nNational Museum of American History\n\nNational Museum of American History\n\nreferenced\n\nPolitical Campaigns\n\nPresidents\n\nrelated event\n\nPresidential Campaign of 2004\n\nRecord ID\n\nnmah_1282718\n\nMetadata Usage (text)\n\nCC0\n\nGUID (Link to Original Record)\n\nhttp://n2t.net/ark:/65665/ng49ca746ab-9f50-704b-e053-15f76fa0b4fa"
