        "text": "News Desk\n\nThe Ghost of Bush v. Gore Haunts the Supreme Court’s Colorado Case\n\nIn 2000, the Court played an outsized role in the Presidential election. This year, in the fight over keeping Trump’s name on the ballot, that decision is a warning but not a precedent.\n\nDaily Comment\n\nAbortion Opponents Are Targeting a Signature G.O.P. Public-Health Initiative\n\nA program that funds H.I.V./AIDS treatment in more than fifty countries has been ensnared in the post-Roe abortion wars.\n\nLetter from Biden’s Washington\n\nThe G.O.P. and the Ghosts of Iraq\n\nUkraine shows that Republicans have moved a long way from the Party of George W. Bush.\n\nDaily Comment\n\nHow Colin Powell Saw His Role—and That of Another Famous Non-Quitter\n\nThe former Secretary of State, who is being honored at the National Cathedral, had a clear notion of “what serving this nation was all about.”\n\nThe Political Scene Podcast\n\nThe Complicated Legacy of Colin Powell\n\nThe former Secretary of State left behind a record of public service that extends far beyond the infamous role that he played in legitimizing the Iraq War.\n\nDaily Comment\n\nGeorge W. Bush Is Right About Trump, but Still Wrong About the World\n\nIt’s not useful to understand global affairs in the broadest possible terms, as a struggle between good and evil.\n\nSatire from The Borowitz Report\n\nTrump Calls Bush Ungrateful: “I Kept Him from Being the Worst President in History”\n\n“When he left office, he was at the bottom of the list of Presidents,” Trump said. “Then I got into office and changed all that.”\n\nOur Columnists\n\nHow Trump Brought Home the Endless War\n\nHaving come to power exploiting the fears spawned by perpetual war abroad, the President is defining the enemy of his war at home just as expansively.\n\nDaily Comment\n\nTrump’s Unprecedented Attacks on Our Public-Health System\n\nThe President’s refusal either to lead or to recognize the leadership of others has made it impossible to develop a national plan to combat the coronavirus.\n\nQ. & A.\n\nWhy Stuart Stevens Wants to Defeat Donald Trump\n\nThe longtime Republican strategist discusses his opposition to Donald Trump, his involvement in the Lincoln Project ad campaign, and why he thinks Mitt Romney would have made a great President.\n\nQ. & A.\n\nJeffrey Sachs on the Catastrophic American Response to the Coronavirus\n\nThe economist Jeffrey Sachs says that President Trump is the “worst political leader” he has seen in forty years of working with governments around the world.\n\nDaily Comment\n\nLessons to Be Learned from the Afghanistan Papers\n\nWhat George W. Bush seemed not to know, in September, 2001, is that a self-justifying drive to “rid the world of evil” can itself become evil’s incubator. Does America know that yet?\n\nDaily Comment\n\nTrump Clarification Syndrome\n\nAs perilous and unnerving as things are, any form of political despair at such a moment remains unforgivable."
