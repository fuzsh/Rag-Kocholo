        "text": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Former President George W. Bush, the former Rangers owner, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Texas plays the Arizona Diamondbacks in the World Series opener Friday night.\n\nThis will be Bush's fourth World Series ceremonial first pitch, but his first before an opener.\n\nBush, 77, headed the group that bought the Rangers from Eddie Chiles in 1988 and was general partner through November 1994, when he stepped down as he prepared to become Texas governor.\n\nBush was U.S. president from 2001 to 2009 and threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the 2001 World Series at Yankee Stadium between New York and Arizona. With heavy security following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Bush wore a bullet-proof vest.\n\nAs Bush warmed up beneath the stands of old Yankee Stadium, the Yankees' Derek Jeter told him, \"Don't bounce it, they will boo you,\" Bush later recalled.\n\nBush threw out ceremonial first pitches with his father, former President George H.W. Bush, before Game 4 of the 2010 World Series in Texas and before Game 5 of the 2017 World Series in Houston.\n\nGeorge W. Bush's group sold the Rangers in 1998 to Thomas Hicks, who sold the team in 2010 to the current ownership group headed by Ray Davis.\n\nRangers Hall of Fame catcher Iván Rodríguez will be behind the plate for Bush's pitch, Major League Baseball said Thursday.\n\nFormer Rangers star Adrián Beltré will throw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 to Rangers Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins.\n\nGrammy Award winner H.E.R. will perform the national anthem before the opener and Pearl Peterson, this year's Boys & Girls Clubs of America's national youth talent performer, will sing it before Game 2."
