        "text": "Business and Politics\n\nAfter leaving Yale in 1968 Bush returned to Texas, where he drifted through a number of towns, worked in a variety of jobs, and gained his first experience in politics. Soon after leaving college, he was accepted into the Texas Air National Guard as a pilot trainee, a post that made it unlikely that he would have to serve in the Vietnam War. In 1970 he was certified as a fighter pilot. That year he also worked as a campaign aide to his father, who unsuccessfully ran for the Senate, and applied for admission to the University of Texas law school but was rejected.\n\nDespite apparently missing at least eight months of duty between May 1972 and May 1973, Bush was granted an early discharge in the fall of 1973 to attend business school at Harvard University. After earning a master’s degree in 1975, Bush returned to his hometown of Midland, where he married Laura Welch, a former classmate from junior high school. Four years later they had twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.\n\nDetermined to make his own name as a businessman, Bush founded Bush Exploration, an oil and gas surveying company. In 1978, despite having achieved only modest success in the business world, he ran for an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Despite running a surprisingly strong campaign in a predominantly Democratic district, Bush lost the election.\n\nBusiness concerns occupied much of Bush’s attention in the following years. A sharp drop in oil prices in the early 1980s hurt his fledgling company. In 1984 Bush merged his company with another firm, Spectrum Corporation, but the downward spiral in the oil industry continued. Bush was forced to sell the failing oil company to Harken Energy Corporation in 1986. Bush received Harken stock, a job as a consultant to the company, and a seat on the company’s board of directors.\n\nThe failure of Spectrum Corporation had a profound impact on Bush. During the time of his business troubles, Bush met Christian evangelical preacher Billy Graham at the Bush family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine. Following that meeting, Bush—who was raised as an Episcopalian but converted to Methodism following his marriage—rededicated himself to Christianity. Known during his younger years for his fondness for partying and alcohol, Bush also resolved to quit drinking and devote himself more completely to his family life.\n\nIn 1987 Bush traveled to Washington, D.C., to work as a high-level adviser on his father’s campaign for the U.S. presidency. Following his father’s victory, Bush returned to Texas and settled in Dallas, where he received the largest break of his business career. In 1988 the owners of the Texas Rangers professional baseball team announced their intention to sell the team. Bush, a lifelong baseball fan, put together a coalition of local businessmen to purchase the team for 46 million dollars. While Bush himself contributed just over 600,000 dollars, his fellow investors named him managing partner of the Rangers.\n\nBush’s period with the Rangers provided him with his first unqualified business success. During his tenure, the Rangers became both a competitive team and a financial success. Moreover, Bush’s high-profile position as managing partner made him a prominent figure throughout Texas.\n\nNomination and Election\n\nBush easily won reelection as governor in 1998 with a record 69 percent of the vote. His landslide victory, coupled with his political successes as governor, made him an early front-runner in the 2000 presidential election. In 1999 Bush officially announced his candidacy for the Republican party’s nomination. Although he faced a stiff challenge from Senator John McCain of Arizona, Bush eventually emerged as the Republican candidate to oppose Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic party nominee, in the presidential election.\n\nDuring his campaign, Bush won praise from his supporters for attempting to expand the traditional base of the Republican party by emphasizing a message of political inclusion for minority Americans. He called for sizable tax cuts for families in an effort to appeal to a broader cross section of the population. To shore up support among the core constituency of the Republican party, Bush selected Dick Cheney as his vice-presidential candidate. Cheney, who served as secretary of defense during the administration of George Bush, Sr., was regarded as a talented politician with the type of impeccable conservative credentials needed to balance Bush’s more moderate views.\n\nIn the election of November 7, 2000, Bush won the popular vote in 30 states while Gore prevailed in 20 states and the District of Columbia. Bush swept the South and much of the Plains and Rocky Mountain regions, but Gore took the more populous states in the Northeast and on the West coast along with some key states in the Midwest, leading to a remarkably tight contest in the electoral college. Eventually the outcome of the election came to hinge on the state of Florida, with both candidates needing its 25 electoral votes to reach the threshold of 270 required to win.\n\nThe initial tally in Florida gave Bush a victory in the popular vote by about 1,800 votes out of some 6 million cast. An automatic machine recount, required by Florida law because of the narrow margin of victory, reduced Bush’s lead to fewer than 1,000 votes four days after the election. The closeness of the vote led to a protracted legal battle, with the Gore campaign requesting manual recounts in several heavily Democratic counties in which it was claimed that the use of outmoded machinery resulted in an exceptionally high number of disqualified ballots. Over the following weeks attorneys for both candidates argued before federal courts, the Florida Supreme Court, and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court, with the Gore team pressing for recounts and the Bush camp seeking to prevent them. During this period Bush’s lead fluctuated as a result of various recounts and the addition of absentee ballots. The first certification of the Florida vote, made one week after the election, gave Bush a 300-vote margin of victory; a revised certification two weeks later put Bush’s lead officially at 537 votes.\n\nAfter more than a month of legal wrangling, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a split decision that reversed a Florida Supreme Court ruling and halted the recounts, preserving Bush’s slight lead in the popular vote in Florida and in effect awarding him the state’s decisive electoral votes. As he took office in January 2001, Bush had before him the task of governing a country deeply divided in its opinions concerning the legitimacy of his victory.\n\nPresidency\n\nIn keeping with the selection of Dick Cheney as his vice president, Bush chose several of his father’s most trusted advisers for his Cabinet. Among these loyal Bush supporters were two of the country’s most distinguished African Americans, retired general Colin Powell and foreign policy expert Condoleezza Rice. Bush appointed Powell as secretary of state and Rice as national security adviser. Bush named Donald Rumsfeld as secretary of defense, a post Rumsfeld had held under President Gerald Ford. Bush’s most controversial Cabinet appointment was John Ashcroft as attorney general. Ashcroft was narrowly confirmed by the Senate after facing intensive questioning by Democrats regarding his civil rights record and views on such issues as abortion rights.\n\nAt the start of his presidency Bush enjoyed Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. He had an early legislative success in June 2001 when Congress passed a 1.35-trillion-dollar tax-cut bill, despite Democratic objections that it unfairly benefited the wealthy. In the same month, however, Democrats took control of the Senate when Vermont Senator James M. Jeffords left the Republican party and became an independent. Thereafter, the Senate put up significant resistance to many of Bush’s domestic initiatives.\n\nIn foreign affairs, the Bush Administration took steps that reduced the country’s international commitments. It opposed international measures to control global warming, withdrew from the 1972 treaty on antiballistic missiles, and rejected the jurisdiction of the new International Criminal Court.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Bush confronted a crisis that transformed his presidency. Terrorists hijacked four U.S. commercial airplanes, deliberately crashing two of them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and a third into the Department of Defense headquarters at the Pentagon building outside Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers rebelled against the hijackers. Fearful for the safety of the president, who was in Florida when the day began, the Secret Service flew him to Air Force bases in Louisiana and Nebraska. By the time Bush returned to the White House that night, the World Trade Center was in ruins, one side of the Pentagon was seriously damaged, and some 3,000 people had died.\n\nBush responded to the attacks by calling for a global war on terrorism. He worked to form an international coalition to combat terrorism using financial, legal, and political means as well as military force. In October 2001 Congress passed the administration’s USA Patriot Act, which gave the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law-enforcement agencies wide powers of search and surveillance in pursuing suspected terrorists, including great leeway in eavesdropping and detaining suspects. The act drew widespread criticism from civil liberties advocates. To coordinate efforts to protect the country against attacks, Bush created the Office of Homeland Security, which became a Cabinet-level department in 2003.\n\nThe Bush Administration blamed the September 11 attacks on al-Qaeda, an Islamic extremist group led by Osama bin Laden. On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces began bombing Afghanistan, whose Taliban government was accused of harboring bin Laden and his followers. U.S. special forces were later deployed on the ground. By the end of the year al-Qaeda had been routed and the Taliban forced from power, though bin Laden had not been found. (He was eventually killed in a raid by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011). Bush received high job-approval ratings among U.S. citizens for his response to the terrorist attacks and the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIn September 2002 Bush announced a new national security strategy that emphasized the need to defend against terrorists and “rogue states” that might threaten the country with “weapons of mass destruction”—biological, chemical, or nuclear arms. In a significant departure from past policy, the strategy declared that the country would take “preemptive” military action to prevent possible attacks. This position put the United States in conflict with much of the international community, especially most of Europe. Critics of the preventive “first-strike” policy argued that it advocated acts of war that could violate international law. They also warned that it set a dangerous precedent for countries that might invoke a perceived threat as justification for military aggression.\n\nBush signaled his intention to put the new strategy into practice by identifying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as a security threat. In late 2002 Bush accused the Iraqi government of possessing and developing weapons of mass destruction in violation of resolutions of the United Nations (UN) Security Council. In October 2002 the U.S. Congress passed a resolution authorizing Bush to use military force in Iraq. The administration then successfully lobbied the UN Security Council for a new resolution to send weapons inspectors to Iraq. In December, however, Bush declared that Saddam had failed to comply fully with the new resolution. The United States and its principal ally in the affair, the United Kingdom, tried unsuccessfully for several weeks to gain support from other Security Council members for a resolution that explicitly authorized military action against Iraq. Meanwhile, massive antiwar demonstrations were held in several major cities, especially in Europe.\n\nBush declared an end to diplomacy on March 17, 2003, giving Saddam 48 hours to step down and leave Iraq or face removal by force. After Saddam refused to leave, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq, which began on March 20 (Iraqi time). By mid-April a coalition of mainly U.S. and British forces had entered all major Iraqi cities and overthrown Saddam’s regime. Iraqi guerrilla attacks continued, however, and coalition forces but lost control of many areas of the country. Meanwhile, investigations failed to produce evidence to support the administration’s claims that Saddam had been developing weapons of mass destruction on a large scale.\n\nAs the war in Iraq persisted, the U.S. economy foundered. Financial markets suffered an extended decline, resulting in part from fears over war and terrorism, widespread corporate accounting scandals, and the bankruptcy of several large corporations. Unemployment rates surged, with the economy losing millions of jobs. A string of four consecutive years of budget surpluses ended in 2002, when the combination of military spending, tax cuts, and slow economic growth brought back deficits. In May 2003 Congress approved a second tax-cut package of 350 billion dollars, but it failed to revive the economy.\n\nIn his campaign for reelection in 2004, Bush de-emphasized the economy and instead focused on national security, often invoking the September 11 terrorist attacks. Although the president’s public approval rating hovered at only about 50 percent or less in the days leading up to the election, Bush and Cheney won both the popular and electoral votes. They received about 51 percent of the popular vote, while the Democratic candidates, Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, won about 48 percent. While Kerry and Edwards took the electoral votes on the West coast, in the Northeast, and in some of the Midwest, Bush and Cheney predominated throughout the South and Southwest and in most of the Midwest.\n\nThe debate over national security also played a role in the highest profile Cabinet changes at the start of Bush’s second term. Secretary of State Powell announced his resignation shortly after Bush’s reelection. A political moderate in an administration of hard-liners, Powell had seen his influence in the White House decline as he publicly admitted flaws in the administration’s rationale for the Iraq war. He was succeeded by National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, a staunch defender of the president’s policies. Attorney General John Ashcroft, widely criticized by civil liberties advocates for his zealous enforcement of the USA Patriot Act, resigned and was succeeded by Alberto Gonzales. In 2007 Gonzales too would resign amid criticism of his handling of the Justice Department.\n\nAfter embarking on an ambitious domestic and foreign policy agenda in his second term, Bush experienced a string of setbacks. His poll ratings were adversely affected by the slow progress and increasing unpopularity of the war in Iraq as well as by a number of legislative failures, most notably the collapse of the president’s plan to create private Social Security accounts. Bush also faced strong criticism on an array of other issues, from the sluggish federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 to revelations that after September 11, 2001, Bush had secretly authorized the National Security Agency to conduct warrantless domestic surveillance. The president was further hurt by a series of corruption scandals involving prominent Republican leaders and the indictment of a senior aide to the vice president on perjury charges.\n\nIn 2005 Bush nominated John G. Roberts, Jr., as chief justice of the Supreme Court, and Roberts was promptly confirmed. Bush suffered another setback, however, when his second nominee to fill a vacancy on the court—White House counsel Harriet Miers—was deemed unacceptable by conservative activists and withdrew. Bush then nominated Samuel Alito, Jr., who was confirmed in 2006.\n\nThe midterm elections of November 2006, in which the Republicans suffered heavy losses, were interpreted as a national referendum on the Bush Administration’s handling of the war in Iraq. Following the elections Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, who had been criticized for his handling of the war, resigned and was replaced by Robert M. Gates. In the last two years of his presidency Bush’s approval rating continued to decline, as the Iraq war continued to claim U.S. soldiers and the Taliban staged a resurgence in Afghanistan. A severe economic crisis in late 2008 led Congress to pass a controversial Bush Administration plan to rescue the financial industry with up to 700 billion dollars in government funds. The economy continued its freefall, however, and Bush’s popularity sank to new lows.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2008 Senator John McCain won the Republican nomination to succeed Bush. McCain’s association with the unpopular policies of the Bush Administration helped to propel Democrat Barack Obama to a resounding victory. Bush left office on January 20, 2009, and returned to private life in Texas."
