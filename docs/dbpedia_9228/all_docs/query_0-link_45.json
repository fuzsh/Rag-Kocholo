        "text": "This is a tough column for a liberal to write. You may recall that I spent eight years hammering President George W. Bush for just about everything he did (and he deserved it!), yet one more thing must be said: Bush started the single best policy of any president in my lifetime.\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Bush’s mammoth program to fight H.I.V. and AIDS. That turned the tide of the epidemic and has saved 25 million lives so far.\n\nThink of that: 25 million lives. That’s like saving every Australian. That’s more than all the Jews killed in the Holocaust and all the people killed in the genocides of Armenians, Cambodians, Rwandans, Bosnians, Darfuris and Rohingya; all the confirmed deaths from Covid worldwide; all the deaths of American troops in all wars in the country’s history back to 1776; all the gun deaths in the United States in the last half-century; and all the auto deaths in the United States in the last half-century — combined.\n\nBush’s initiative was called the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It paid for antiretroviral medicines for people with AIDS and for efforts to prevent the spread of the virus, including to newborns through childbirth. I knew how transformative PEPFAR had been when I interviewed coffin makers in Malawi and Lesotho and they fretted about the collapse of their business model: Because of Bush, many fewer people were dying.\n\n“Genius plan; pretty crap acronym,” Bono called it. He also described it as “the most eloquent expression of American values anyone can think of in recent times.”\n\nSigh. It’s awkward for liberals when an earnest Irishman thanks us for a program created by Bush! How is it that the leading humanitarian initiative of our lifetime was engineered not by a globalist progressive but rather by a guy with whom we disagree on almost everything?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
