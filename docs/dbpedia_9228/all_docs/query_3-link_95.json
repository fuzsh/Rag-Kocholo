        "text": "What running does:\n\nFirst, it helps me sleep at night. Second, it keeps me disciplined. For example, I'm a person who believes in punctuality. That's a discipline. I expect the White House staff to be on time and sharp and to exercise. And in my case, running helps me keep that discipline.\n\nRunning also breaks up my day and allows me to recharge my batteries. Running also enables me to set goals and push myself toward those goals. In essence, it keeps me young. A good run adds a little bounce to my step. I get a certain amount of self-esteem from it. Plus, I just look and feel better…\n\nIt's interesting that my times have become faster right after the war began. They were pretty fast all along, but since the war began, I have been running with a little more intensity. And I guess that's part of the stress relief I get from it. For me, the psychological benefit is enormous. You tend to forget everything's that going on in your mind, and just concentrate on the time, distance, or the sweat. It helps me to clear my mind.\n\nHis start in 1972:\n\nI was still very young, but I was so out of shape, a friend of mine played to my vanity to get me to start running. Back then, I was a man who was known to drink a beer or two. And over time, I'm convinced that running helped me quit drinking and smoking.\n\nAs a runner, I quickly realized what it felt like to be healthy, and I already knew what it felt like to be unhealthy. If you're drinking too much, and you're running to cure a hangover, pretty soon you have to make a choice. Do you want to keep getting a hangover, or do you want to feel the way you do after a run? Running is a way to heal people. Running is something that just makes you feel fantastic.\n\nHis current fitness program:\n\nI go to work a little before 7 a.m., and I expect everybody to show up on time when I have a meeting. I make time to run or exercise every day. There's never a question in my mind that I'll exercise. Even when I travel, there's always a treadmill in my room. I have a treadmill on Air Force One. On long trips-for example, when I went to Europe recently-I ran for 90 minutes on the flight over there. When I came back from China, I ran on the flight.\n\nUsually I run 6 days a week. When I don't run, I use an elliptical trainer, lift weights, and stretch. But when I run, I run hard. On Sundays, if I'm at Camp David, I'll go for a hard, morning run-these days about 20:30 to 20:45 for 3 miles on a tough course-and then I'll go walk 2 to 4 miles with Laura [the First Lady] afterward.\n\nI try to go for longer runs, but it's tough around here at the White House on the outdoor track. When I'm at my ranch in Crawford [Tex.], I can do longer runs. It's sad that I can't run longer. It's one of the saddest things about the presidency. There would be nothing better than to take off on a long run around the Mall, but I just can't. I really miss those long ones.\n\nMaking time to exercise:\n\nI believe anyone can make the time. As a matter of fact, I don't believe it-I know it. If the President of the United States can make the time, anyone can.\n\nExercise is so important that corporate America should help its employees make time. There should be flextime for families, and there should be flextime for exercise. A healthy work force is a more productive work force. We have got to do a better job of encouraging exercise in America.\n\nThe beauty of running:\n\nI ran in public this morning, because I am promoting exercise this week, but running is usually a private and personal thing for me. One of my favorite things to do at the ranch in Crawford is to get up early-I'm an early-morning guy-and just take off on this beautiful piece of property as the sun is coming up.\n\nOne of the great things about running-at least when I was free to do it on my own-was the ability to explore and see the natural world. My greatest runs have been those when I just get absorbed by the environment. When I was governor, I enjoyed running in Austin [Tex.] so much because I could run along some terrific trails.\n\nHis marathon in 1993:\n\nI was distraught after my dad was defeated in 1992, so I decided I was going to set a little project for myself. I wanted to run the White Rock Marathon in Dallas, so I began training intensely for it. I gave myself a month to train for it, and pushed myself incredibly hard as this was after-election therapy. But I got sick, and it was really a foolish attempt on my part. So I set my sights on Houston, which gave me some more time to train. I ran it in 3:44. I ran the first mile in 8:30 and the last mile in 8:30. It was one of the great experiences of my life. I learned that running can make you feel 10 years younger the day of the race and 10 years older the day after the race. I also learned not to be so compulsive.\n\nThe 100-Degree Club:\n\nIt started during the campaign. It was August and well over 100 degrees. We landed in Crawford, and I said that I had to go for a run. I knew if I didn't get it in then, I'd never do it. So as I recall there was a change of shift of the Secret Service agents. And I just told them that we should all go for a run right then. So both shifts of agents went right with me in the heat. And afterward, I had \"100-Degree Club\" T-shirts and certificates printed up and gave 'em away to everybody who went with me.\n\nAmerica's biggest health problems:\n\nTobacco, bad food, and lack of exercise. A lot of disease can be prevented. And I think you'll see the health-care systems will evolve toward encouraging prevention. Wise business insurers will work with physical fitness folks to encourage reasonable exercise. Statistic after statistic is beginning to sink into the consciousness of the American people that exercise is one of the keys to a healthy lifestyle."
