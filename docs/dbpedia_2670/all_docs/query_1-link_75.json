Past, present and future: successes and challenges in managing marine data – A celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) Delivered by Ward Appeltans (IOC/IODE) 8th May 2019, The Bluecoat, Liverpool City Centre\n\n2. Establishment of the first NODCs 1961 1963 1964 1965 1967 1968 1969 1971 USA Canada Australia India Russia Japan Germany Chile Spain UK France 66 NODCs 66 NODCs 30 Associate Data Units (continued renaming of OBIS nodes to ADUs) ! BODC was a Designated National Agency (DNA) before 1969\n\n3. Between 1980-1996 Iouri Oliounine was the head of the IOC Ocean Services Unit in charge of IGOSS, IODE, and Tsunami programmes In 1980s and 1990s, BODC was known as the main contributor to the formulation of data policy, data exchange formats, data management tools\n\n4. BODC in IODE • Three IODE Chairs: • John B. Tait (1964-1968) • Nick Flemming (1990-1996) • Lesley Rickards (2005-2009) • Several BODC staff actively engaged in IODE Projects: • Roy Lowry: Marine Environmental Data and Information Referral System (MEDI), and marine-XML, now under JCOMM/IODE ETDMP • Gwen Moncoiffe: OBIS-ENV-DATA, GE-BICH (The Group of Experts on Biological and Chemical Data Management and Exchange Practices) • Adam Leadbetter: OTGA-RDM training, ICAN, Data Publication/data citation project (SCOR,MBLWHOI,IODE) • BODC involved in 52 IODE documents\n\n5. Dr. Meirion Jones from UK is a Founding Director of the British Oceanographic data Centre. From 1979 to 1996 he was actively involved in developing the IODE system including the design of the IOC General Exchange Format. From 1985 to 2003 he was Chairman of the IOC Group of Experts on the Technical Aspects of Data Exchange and of the IOC/IHO GEBCO Sub- committee on Digital Bathymetry from 1983 to 2003. He coordinated the digitization of the GEBCO paper charts and led the publication of the Centenary Edition of the GEBCO Digital Atlas. Dr. Nicholas Flemming from UK was Director of the British national oceanographic data centre from 1980 till 1987 to take later the position of the chairman of the IODE Committee of the IOC which he occupied till1992. He was Director of EuroGOOS Office and Member of the GOOS Steering Group until 2001. Now he is a research fellow at the national oceanography centre in Southampton. Dr. Lesley Rickards from UK, Deputy Director of the British Oceanographic Data Centre has over 25 years experience in managing marine data. She was Chair of the IOC International Oceanographic Data and Information exchange Committee from 2003-2007 and represented IODE on the JCOMM Management Committee. She is currently a member of the International Council for Science World Data System Scientific committee and the governing body of the World Data System. In 2007 she was appointed Director of the Permanent Service for Mean sea Level which has close links with the Global Sea Level Observing System – GLOSS. For over 20 years she has been a member of the IOC/JCOMM Group of Experts on GLOSS. IOC 50th Anniversary Commemorative Medal\n\n6. IODE Achievement Awards 2013 Roy Lowry • General Format 3 (GF3) • Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Data Management Task Team • MarineXML, SeaVox • data publication and citation 2009 Lesley Rickards • IOC Strategic Plan for Oceanographic Data and Information Management First female chair of IODE\n\n7. Quality Management Framework: ensuring quality data flow in the network So far 9 NODCs have been accredited, and 1 ADU Belgium (x2), China, France, Iran, Ireland, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), United Kingdom and Malaysia (adu) IODE-XXV Tokyo, Japan, 20-22 February 2019 (BODC was accredited by IODE Officers, 23/8/2017) NODCs to establish organizational quality management systems for the delivery of oceanographic and related data, products and services.\n\n8.

In 1964 – under chairmanship of John Tait: IODE WG Report on the exchange of biological data: • Submit metadata of biological sampling along with physcial and chemical data. • Data on PP, Chl a, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthos biomass are acceptable • Eventually standardisation and intercallibration may make standard reporting possible • As methods improve, we may include other biological observations important in fishery oceanography\n\n22. • Established in 1999 as part of the Census of Marine Life • Adopted by IOC in 2009 • Secretariat moves to Ostend in 2011 • In numbers: ~ 30 regional and thematic nodes ~ 1,000 data providers ~ 2,900 datasets ~ 56,000,000 occurrence records ~ 124,000 accepted species\n\n23. OBIS-ENV-DATA Expanding OBIS beyond species occurrence data, with an extension for environmental data This 2-year pilot project aims to develop procedures and guidelines for managing and sharing mixed datasets, making sure that supporting measurements are curated and distributed alongside the species occurrence data. OBIS-ENV-DATA involved 11 institutions from 10 countries in North-America, South-America, Europe, Africa and Australia. In collaboration with\n\n24.

IOC Ocean Data and Information System The ODIS \"Catalogue of Sources\" aims to be an online browsable and searchable catalogue of existing ocean related web- based sources/systems of data and information as well as products and services. It will also provide information on products and visualize the landscape (entities and their connections) of ocean data and information sources. https://catalogue.odis.org/\n\n32.
