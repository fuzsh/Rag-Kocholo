The Met Office is active within the international marine meteorological community and plays an active role in World Meteorological Organisation programs for sharing and developing marine meteorological data and processes.\n\nThe Met Office is the DAC for marine meteorological (metocean) data and was established in 1854 as a small department within the Board of Trade and now, more than 150 years on, is the UK’s National Weather Service. In addition to weather forecasting, the Met Office’s Hadley Centre is one the world’s leading climate research centres. The Met Office operates as a Trading Fund within the government’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) and is required to meet targets as set by its Ministerial Owner.\n\nWithin the area of marine data the Met Office maintains a network of instrumented moored buoys and systems on light vessels, manages a fleet of around 200 Voluntary Observing Ships (some with automated systems on-board), manages the UK Argo programme and deploys drifting buoys in support of the European (E-SURFMAR) and international global drifter programme. The Met Office is active within the international World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) marine programs and DAC staff participate in WMO Task Teams for aspects of Marine Meteorology.\n\nThe Met Office Oracle climate database (MIDAS) currently contains over 230 million marine meteorological observations from ships, moored buoys, light vessels, coastal systems and rigs/platforms dating back to 1854 up to the present. Data received over the WMO Global Telecommunications System (GTS) are ingested daily, adding around 36,000 observations per day.\n\nIn addition the Hadley Centre maintain a number of key global marine climate datasets including: HadISST - Globally complete sea-ice and sea-surface temperature; HadSST4 - Uninterpolated sea-surface temperature; HadNMAT2 - Uninterpolated night marine air temperature; EN4 - Sub-surface temperature and salinity profiles and analyses; HadIOD - Surface and sub-surface temperature and salinity observations.\n\nAlso, a wide range of Met Office ocean model datasets (including the high resolution OSTIA global SST products) are made available via the Met Office Website as well as the Copernicus Marine Service.\n\nDATA ACCESSIBILITY\n\nAll ship and buoy data are exchanged internationally via the WMO GTS and are available through the International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere DataSet (ICOADS).\n\nReal-time data (previous 24 hours) from the Met Office moored buoys, light vessels and coastal stations around the UK are available via the Met Office web-site.\n\nAll UK Argo float data are archived by BODC and are available through the two Global Argo Data Assembly Centres (GDACS) in France (Coriolis) and USGODAE.\n\nGlobal marine climate datasets maintained by the Met Office Hadley Centre are made available for download free of charge for scientific research and private study.\n\nMost data are publicly available although some third party datasets may require approval from the original data owner before data can be released. A charge may apply to cover distribution costs and any additional work required. See the Met Office terms of use.\n\nDATA USE\n\nMarine meteorological data from the Met Office is utilised by a diverse range of users including public, commercial and academic organisations for a wide variety of applications.
