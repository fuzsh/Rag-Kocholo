        "text": "I mentioned at the end of last week’s post that I’d like to try time lapse photography. This week, I’ve been doing a bit more research. We’ve got a couple of Canon DSLRs at work so I had a look on the Canon website for more information on time lapse photography. There are four tutorial videos by award-wining photographer and “Canon Explorer of Light” Vincent Laforet.\n\nFrom the website:\n\n“Vincent Laforet introduces basic time lapse concepts including what to look for when searching for the ideal time lapse subjects, how to ensure smooth movement during playback, and other useful tips to get started.”\n\nI found the videos really informative and now think I could probably have a go at shooting a time lapse movie. Here’s a photo that might give a bit of a clue as to what I’d like to film…\n\nThe only slight issue is that I don’t think we have any of the lenses that Vincent recommends in his tutorial videos. I had a quick look online and they all seem to cost about £1500! I’ll have to see if I can do it with a cheaper wide-angle lens instead…\n\nThis week, a few of us attended an introductory course on filming and editing at Futureworks in Manchester. We spent four days learning how to plan, shoot and edit a short film.\n\nDay one was spent learning how our video camera works, how to shoot video using DSLR cameras and the basic principles of lighting. On the morning of day two we learned how to plan and storyboard a shoot; in the afternoon we went to Manchester Art Gallery (on location, as I believe it’s called!) to film a short piece about a couple of the current exhibitions there.\n\nDay three was spent in the editing suite where we learned how to import our clips, rearrange them, edit them and create a timeline. Day four was all about adding the finishing touches, audio, effects, titles, etc.\n\nHaving just completed the course, I feel we can now produce a short film by ourselves on our project for JISC. We’re all bursting with ideas about exciting content. I’m hoping we can get an intervalometer so we can do some time-lapse filming…\n\nMost of the earliest sea level data records come from commercial or military ports. Having a record of the tide was important for ship navigation. Sea level records were also important tools in the establishment of a national datum, or zero level, to which heights on maps would be referred.\n\nSome of the earliest tide gauges (which have given us some of longest sea level records in the world) were housed in specially designed huts. Because of their age, a lot of these buildings are of unique and interesting design. Below are a few examples.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n“The Kronstadt sea-gauge with the tide gauge pavilion is a zero-level of the Baltic system depths and heights. All depths and altitudes (even the heights of the flight spacecraft) in Russia and some other countries (former Russian Empire) are measured from the level of Kronstadt sea gauge. Yuri Gagarin, the first spaceman in the World, ironically said in 1967 that this is it the Hub of the Universe.”\n\nThe sea level has been measured at Kronstadt (although not always at the same location) since 1777, making it one of longest sea level records in the world.\n\nSome more tide gauge buildings:\n\nThe Tidal Observatory was established to determine the mean sea level used as the starting point for levelling in the UK. A brass bolt on the site is the benchmark for the whole of the United Kingdom. All Ordnance Survey map heights are referenced to this point.\n\nThe height of the benchmark was established over a six-year period from 1915 to 1921. Visual observations of water level on a tide staff were made every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. From the data collected over this period, mean sea level was caculated and this vertical level marked with the bolt.\n\nThe National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, holds a weekly seminar every Wednesday during university term time. Though the lab specialises in shelf sea and sea level science, the seminar series is broad in scope, covering all aspects of oceanography, climate science and geophysical fluid dynamics. Seminars are attended by Ph.D. students, researchers and senior scientists from NOC and the University of Liverpool.\n\nNext week, I will be giving the seminar, the title of which is “Marine Data Management: Past, Present and Future”.\n\nRead the abstract: http://noc.ac.uk/seminars/liverpool/marine-data-management-past-present-future\n\nThe first section of the talk will focus on data archaeology and I hope to explain the importance of recovering, quality controlling and distributing historic data. I’ll be discussing the JISC Sea level project as an example. It will also help raise awareness of this project within the lab and at other organisations and let people know there will be more data available soon."
