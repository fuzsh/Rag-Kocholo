        "text": "The International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) of the IOC was established in 1961 with an aim to “enhance marine research, exploitation and development, by facilitating the exchange of oceanographic data and information between participating Member States, and by meeting the needs of users for data and information products.” This is underpinned by a number of objectives, including supporting the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), developing best practice for management of data and narrowing the ‘digital divide’ between developing and developed countries.\n\nThe UK has been a very active participant in IODE, particularly via the Marine Enivornmental Data and Information Network (MEDIN), the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) and the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO), contributing both to its implementation and strategic development. The UK has also Chaired the IODE, through Dr Nicholas Flemming (1990, 1992) and Dr Lesley Rickards (2005, 2007).\n\nThe governance of the IOC IODE is set out as:\n\nIOC Committee on IODE: UK representative at the 26th IOC Committee on IODE Session was Dr Lesley Rickards (BODC at NOC)\n\nIODE Management Group: UK representative is Simon Good (Met Office)\n\nIODE Network for the coordination of data and information management at the national level (described below)\n\nIODE Steering Groups for various projects (Table below)\n\nIODE Network Structure\n\nThe IODE structure has two levels. The first is the coordination of data and information management (e.g. data centres). The second is the programme structural elements.\n\n1. IODE Data & Information Centres\n\nGlobal Data Assembly Centres (GDACs)\n\nGDACs will be formed to work alongside the Marine Climate Data System (MCDS) and will focus on receiving and assembling both marine meteorological data and oceanographic data, ensuring the data are consistent and compliant to meeting international standards under the IOC and WMO.\n\nUK involvement: No GDACs currently exist according to the 25th IODE Session in 2019 with recent updates from the 26th IODE Session in 2021 reporting uncertainty of GDACs moving forward\n\nNational Oceanographic Data Centres (NODC)\n\nThe mission of an NODC is to provide access and stewardship for the national resource of oceanographic data. This effort requires the gathering, quality control, processing, summarization, dissemination, and preservation of data generated by national and international agencies.\n\nUK involvement: The British Oceanographic Data Centre is one of only nine IODE-accredited NODCs, out of 58 NODCs. Furthermore, the accrediation procedure and criteria was built on the MEDIN accrediation critera.\n\nThe UK contact for data management is Ian Moores, Head of BODC.\n\nThe UK contact for information management is Head of Library and Information Services at the National Oceanographic Library, TBC.\n\nAssociate Data Unit (ADU)\n\nThe ADU brings in wider ocean research and observation communities as key stakeholders of the IODE network. It allows these sectors to share, provide access to and preserve ocean research data.\n\nUK involvement: There are 34 ADUs, only one (in Malaysia) is accredited. The UK has four ADUs: SCAR – Anton Van de Putte, DASSH (at the MBA) – Dan Lear, Cefas – Laura Hanley and MEDIN - Clare Postlethwaite. DASSH and Cefas are both accredited MEDIN Data Archive Centres (DAC).\n\nWorld Data System (WDS)\n\nThe WDS aims to bring together previously stand-alone World Data Centres to form a global, interoperable distributed data system. IODE became a network member of the WDS in 2013. Through this, all NODCs are linked to the WDS\n\nUK involvement: Only the World Data Centre – Oceanography exists under the WDS and this is based in the USA.\n\nAssociate Information Unit (AIU)\n\nThe AIU forms a network of the marine library community, whereby AIUs must carry out marine information management functions or provide marine information services\n\nUK involvement: Only five currently exist, the UK has not formed one.\n\n2.
