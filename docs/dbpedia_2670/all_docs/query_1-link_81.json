        "text": "Global ocean & land terrain models\n\nGEBCO’s current gridded bathymetric data set, the GEBCO_2024 Grid, is a global terrain model for ocean and land, providing elevation data, in meters, on a 15 arc-second interval grid. It is accompanied by a Type Identifier (TID) Grid that gives information on the types of source data that the GEBCO_2024 Grid is based on.\n\nThis release includes a version of the grid with under-ice topography/bathymetry information for Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nDownload global coverage grids\n\nDownload data for user-defined areas\n\nMore information about the grid, its terms of use and attribution. Provide feedback, tell us how you are using the grid.\n\nGEBCO releases a new global grid every year, generally in late June. Find out more about the grid generation process.\n\nDownload global coverage grids\n\nThe GEBCO_2023 Grid and TID Grid can be download as global files in netCDF format or a set of 8 tiles (each with an area of 90° x 90°), giving global coverage, in Esri ASCII raster and data GeoTiff formats. The data filea are included in a zip file along with the data set documentation.\n\nGEBCO_2024 Grid\n\n(ice surface elevation) netCDF\n\n(4 Gbytes, 7.5 Gbytes uncompressed) Data GeoTiff\n\n(4 Gbytes, 8 Gbytes uncompressed) Esri ASCII raster\n\n(5 Gbytes, 20 Gbytes uncompressed) GEBCO_2024 Grid\n\n(sub-ice topo/bathy) netCDF\n\n(4 Gbytes, 7.5 Gbytes uncompressed) Data GeoTiff\n\n(4 Gbytes, 8 Gbytes uncompressed) Esri ASCII raster\n\n(5 Gbytes, 20 Gbytes uncompressed) GEBCO_2024 TID Grid netCDF\n\n90 Mbytes, 4 Gbytes uncompressed) Data GeoTiff\n\n(96 Mbytes, 7 Gbytes uncompressed) Esri ASCII raster\n\n(108 Mbytes, 9.5 Gbytes uncompressed)\n\nPlease note that the size of the uncompressed files.\n\nDownload data for user-defined areas\n\nUse our application to select and download data in netCDF, Esri ASCII raster and data GeoTiff formats.\n\nData set attribution for GEBCO_2024 Grid\n\nIf the data sets are used in a presentation or publication then we ask that you acknowledge the source.This should be of the form:\n\nGEBCO Compilation Group (2024) GEBCO 2024 Grid (doi:10.5285/1c44ce99-0a0d-5f4f-e063-7086abc0ea0f)\n\nTerms of use\n\nThe GEBCO Grid is placed in the public domain and may be used free of charge. Use of the GEBCO Grid indicates that the user accepts the conditions of use and disclaimer information.\n\nData set errata and known issues\n\nAlthough every care is taken during the development of the GEBCO bathymetric grids, errors can occasionally occur, and can be reported to the Seabed 2030 Global Centre ( ). Known issues can be viewed on our errata pages.\n\nType Identifier (TID) Grid\n\nThe TID grid identifies the type of source data that the corresponding grid cells in the GEBCO Grid are based on. Further information about the TID codes can be found in the accompanying documentation.\n\nFind out more about the TID grid from our StoryMap.\n\nNote on vertical datum and GEBCO's grids\n\nGEBCO's global elevation models are generated by the assimilation of heterogeneous data types assuming all of them to be referred to mean sea level. However, in some shallow water areas, the grids include data from sources having a vertical datum other than mean sea level. We are working to understand how best to fully assimilate these data.\n\nWeb Map Services (WMS)\n\nGEBCO's grids are available as a WMS.\n\nLayers are available for GEBCO's grids as a shaded relief images or 'flat' map images. These layers can be viewed in a web browser or Geographic Information System (GIS) and incorporated in your own web application.\n\nPlease note that WMS layers for the GEBCO_2024 Grid are not currently available.\n\nWMS layers for previous releases of the GEBCO grid are also available.\n\nProvide feedback\n\nTo help us improve our products and services, use our form to provide feedback on the GEBCO grid.\n\nFind out more"
