We are a national research organization, delivering integrated marine science and technology from the coast to the deep ocean and one of the top five institutions of its kind in the world.\n\nThe NOC has entered a truly exciting time, moving to independent & charitable status as of 1 November 2019.\n\nWe are made up of a dynamic and vibrant community of staff covering a range of specialist fields, backgrounds and experience. Each employee is committed to advancing the frontiers of scientific knowledge. All of us directly or indirectly support scientific research and by sharing that knowledge the NOC aims to contribute to the health of the ocean with a focus on improving the world in which we all live. Our work is balanced by our strong sense of purpose, values and behaviors and an unwavering commitment to a ‘one NOC’ approach.\n\nAbout the role\n\nBODC leads the UK effort in managing oceanographic data, providing open access to over 100,000 datasets while managing and delivering in excess of 450 different oceanographic variables.\n\nThe Head of BODC is accountable for our three main areas of activity: data management, software development, and Science Engagement & Enablement (SEE). While the first area is overseen by the Lead Data Manager, the Head of BODC will supervise both software development, and SEE; providing leadership and technical oversight of software projects, alongside setting measurable goals and KPIs for activities such as proposal writing, income generation, collaborative projects, conference attendance, and other engagement activities.\n\nFor more information please see our website.\n\nAbout you\n\nWe’re looking for an innovative leader with substantial experience in the data management sector.

We support opportunities for further training and development.\n\nOur commitment as an employer\n\nThe NOC is an equal opportunities employer and welcomes applications from all sections of the community. There is a guaranteed interview scheme for suitable candidates with a disability and we welcome applications from ethnic minorities currently under-represented. The NOC is an Investors in People organization and has signed up to the Athena SWAN charter principles to take action to address gender equality.\n\nHow to apply\n\nPlease click ‘Apply for this job’ and submit an up-to-date CV and cover letter.
