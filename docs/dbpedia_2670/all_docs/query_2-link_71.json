Its purpose is to enhance marine research, exploitation and development, by facilitating the exchange of oceanographic data and information between participating Member States, and by meeting the needs of users for data and information products.\n\nEMODnet Seabed Mapping\n\nThe European Commission, represented for the purposes of this project by the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG MARE), has concluded service contracts for creating pilot components of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). The overall objective is to create pilots to migrate fragmented and inaccessible marine data into interoperable, continuous and publicly available data streams for complete maritime basins. The results will help to define processes, best technology and approximate costs of a final operational European Marine Observation and Data Network.\n\nODIP\n\nThe ODIP project is a Coordination and Support Action of the Research Infrastructures programme within EU FP7. The contract number is 312492. It has a duration of 36 months from 1st October 2012 till 31st September 2015.\n\nOcean and marine data are recognised as valuable resources which have a high cost of acquisition and as such should be well managed and made as widely available to end users as possible for a variety of uses including scientific research, marine management and planning, policy and decision making, and economic activities."
