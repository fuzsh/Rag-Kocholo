        "text": "The British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), part of the National Oceanography Centre, manages UK ocean science data through a sophisticated network of software systems, designed and developed by our team of in-house research software engineers.\n\nWe also support many European & international projects, amongst which is MOCCA – Monitoring the Oceans and Climate Change with Argo – a 5 year project to deploy 150 Argo floats at locations around the globe that will monitor sea temperature and salinity.\n\nTo help us meet the MOCCA project deliverables, we’re looking for a software developer with strong Python skills to join the team for 12 months, the primary goal being development of a Python quality-control tool for Argo float data, based on existing MATLAB code.\n\nAs the role is fixed term for 12 months, we’re looking for a candidate who’s able to learn quickly, and not afraid to ask plenty of questions, but don’t worry, you won’t be on your own; there will be support and guidance from the BODC software development team, as well as the Argo team who are based onsite.\n\nStrong skills in Python, are essential to the post, and some knowledge of MATLAB will also be necessary, as building the Argo data quality-control tool will involve reviewing existing code, and understanding how it works."
