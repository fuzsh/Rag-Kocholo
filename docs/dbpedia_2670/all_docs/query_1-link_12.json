Some thought provoking discussions reflecting on where we've come from, where we are now and where we'd like to be in the future!\n\nThe BODC Published Data Library (PDL) is a catalogue of datasets which have been assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). We work with scientists to create a data management plan at the beginning of a project and agree which data will have a DOI. Assigning DOI's makes the data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR). Not all data held at BODC have been allocated DOIs. The data within a DOI are freely available.

Currently, there is no repository for marine rock samples collected by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded scientists and research ships so a Rock Store Working Group, involving the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), the British Geological Survey, the British Antarctic Survey, the University of Southampton, University of Strathclyde, The University of Edinburgh and The University of Manchester are inviting the UK‚Äôs marine science community to complete a survey which will help define the future requirements for marine dredge rock and ROV rock samples facilities. Results will be provided to the NOC Association of Marine Science National Capability Beneficiaries to consider next steps. The survey is open to UKRI-NERC funded scientists and the closing date for responses is 18 December 2024.
