        "text": "Data submission\n\nThis page provides information to UK Shelf Sea Biogeochemistry (SSB) programme members on how to submit data to the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC).\n\nAll data arising from the programme should be submitted to BODC upon data acquisition in accordance with the SSB-specific data policy. The types of data submitted to BODC include field-based observations, field experiments, laboratory experiments (using field-based samples), selected model output, data syntheses, data-model syntheses, model codes and information on actual samples. Data are considered to be acquired when definitive values have been established. This may be when observations are directly made (for real-time, underway data) or when samples have been analysed. After you have submitted your data, BODC will archive a copy, assign data access conditions and assemble the data set into a relational database, so that spatial and temporal links to all data within the programme and within BODC can be maintained. BODC will then take responsibility for distributing the data to programme members and the wider community.\n\nHow to submit data\n\nObservational data and data arising from physical samples\n\nData submitted to BODC (to be included in a relational database) should be fully-calibrated, quality-controlled and supplied with enough information about methods, parameters and calibrations that data sets can stand alone without the need refer back to you (for more information see ‘Notes on submitting data’ below). Where possible, please format your data according to NERC good practice criteria detailed in the 'Guidance on providing data to BODC for Shelf Sea Biogeochemistry' (173KB) except in cases where we have previously agreed data delivery formats with you (which will also conform to these specifications).\n\nData can be submitted directly to the SSB data managers via email to Louise Darroch or copied onto CD, DVD or Zip disk and sent by post to:\n\nDr Louise Darroch,\n\nBritish Oceanographic Data Centre,\n\nJoseph Proudman Building,\n\n6 Brownlow Street,\n\nLiverpool,\n\nL3 5DA,\n\nUnited Kingdom.\n\nFTP server transfer can be arranged where files of larger size are to be submitted. Please email Louise Darroch for arrangements. Alternatively, data may be uploaded to our secure file area. When submitting data, please inform BODC of:\n\nThe data access conditions to be applied (see the SSB-specific data policy for more information)\n\nWhether the data will also be published in the Published Data Library (PDL) and require data citation through a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)\n\nNumerical model data\n\nPlease refer to the BODC numerical modelling submission pages.\n\nNotes on submitting data\n\nMetadata and documentation\n\nMetadata are a crucial part of any data archive since they ensure that the data can be made discoverable and understood at later date. All data should be submitted to BODC with enough supporting metadata to ensure that they are stand alone and without further need to refer back to the originator.\n\nIn general, metadata should include details about how (with which instrument or technique), when and where the data have been collected, by whom (including the affiliation and contact address or telephone number) and in the framework of which SSB project.\n\nFor all submitted data, BODC needs to know how the values were arrived at. The derivation process must be stated: all processing and calibration steps should be described and calibration values supplied. The nature and units of the recorded variables are essential, as well as the grid or reference system. As much information as possible about fieldwork instrumentation should also be included (e.g. serial number, copies of manufacturer’s calibration sheets, and recent calibrations).\n\nData quality\n\nThe quality of data submitted to BODC must be of a high standard, so that it is ready to be analysed without the need for further processing. This is essential to facilitate the exchange of data between programme members and to incorporate the data into models.\n\nIn general, all data submitted to BODC should be fully calibrated and quality-controlled. Data should be checked for quality and pre-edited or flagged for erroneous values. All relevant processing steps, calibrations and unit conversions should be applied to the data. The level of processing applied to datasets submitted to BODC is usually enough for the data to be directly analysed or repackaged to ‘add-value’ (usually termed the ‘base’ or ‘cruise’ dataset).\n\nRaw data\n\nIn specific cases, it may be appropriate to submit corresponding raw files, such as, where only a subset of the raw data is exploited or in cases where changes in processing method are likely to occur after the project has ended. In these cases both raw and processed data should be archived at BODC. It must be stressed that BODC does not have the resource to process raw data without specific agreement. Unprocessed data cannot readily be incorporated into the relational database system and its distribution is limited to copies of the original files via a data set inventory."
