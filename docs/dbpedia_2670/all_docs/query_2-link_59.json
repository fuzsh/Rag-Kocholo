        "text": "The Environmental Data Service (EDS) provides a focal point for scientific data and information spanning all environmental science domains: atmosphere and climate, earth observation, polar and cryosphere, marine, terrestrial and freshwater, geoscience, solar and space physics.\n\nThe EDS is made up of a network of distributed data centres, with domain specific expertise:\n\nBritish Oceanographic Data Centre (Marine)\n\nCentre for Environmental Data Analysis (Atmospheric, Earth Observation, and Solar and space physics)\n\nEnvironmental Information Data Centre (Terrestrial and freshwater)\n\nNational Geoscience Data Centre (Geoscience)\n\nUK Polar Data Centre (Polar and cryosphere)\n\nWhilst the data centres have individual discipline specific expertise, we pull together decades of experience to provide an integrated shared service that works across all domains.\n\nCore Trust Seal\n\nCoreTrustSeal is a certification based on requirements established by the World Data Systems (WDS) and the Data Seal of Approval (DSA). They reflect the core characteristics of trustworthy data repositories.\n\nFour of the individual data centres that make up the NERC EDS have been assessed against the CoreTrustSeal requirements and have been certified as trustworthy repositories. We were required to provide evidence that we operate in a sustainable and trustworthy fashion. The evidence was subsequently reviewed and approved by community peers. Certification helps us to review and improve the quality and transparency of our processes.\n\nOur people\n\nEDS staff are experts in the collection of scientific information, state-of-the-art data management, preservation techniques and application development, resulting in a high quality and important national asset available to all.\n\nPolicies & Guidance"
