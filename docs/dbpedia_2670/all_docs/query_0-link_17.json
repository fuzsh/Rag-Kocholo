Through decades of hard-won experience at the forefront of ocean measure­ment, the lessons learned carry forward to each generation of ocean-going platforms and sensors.\n\nPublic Benefit\n\nThe NOC contributes to the advancement of scientific knowledge of the ocean, as part of a global endeavour. This is both a public good in its own right, which can lead to applications that result directly or indirectly in public benefit."
