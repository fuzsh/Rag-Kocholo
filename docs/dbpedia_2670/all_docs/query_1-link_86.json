The GEBCO_08 Grid is largely based on a database of ship-track soundings with interpolation between soundings guided by satellite-derived gravity data. In some areas, data from existing grids are included. The GEBCO_08 Grid does not contain detailed information in shallower water areas, and information concerning the generation of the grid can be found on GEBCO website at www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/. The GEBCO_08 Grid is accompanied by a Source Identifier (SID) Grid, which indicates which cells in the GEBCO_08 Grid are based on soundings or existing grids and which have been interpolated. The latest version of both grids and accompanying documentation is available to download, on behalf of GEBCO, from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) website at www.bodc.ac.uk/data/hosted_data_systems/gebco_gridded_bathymetry_data/. The names of the IHO (International Hydrographic Organization), IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission), GEBCO (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans), NERC (Natural Environment Research Council) or BODC (British Oceanographic Data Centre) may not be used in any way to imply, directly or otherwise, endorsement or support of either the Licensee or their mapping system."
