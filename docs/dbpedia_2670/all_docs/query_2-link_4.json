Developed by HR Wallingford for the Marine Environmental Data and Information Network (MEDIN), this tool supports MEDIN's mission to enhance the accessibility and sharing of marine data within the UK. Metadata Maestro 3.1 enables users to generate metadata records that adhere to the MEDIN Discovery Metadata Standard v3.1. The MEDIN standard guarantees that metadata is consistent, comprehensive, and effective for discovering and understanding marine datasets. With its user-friendly interface, Metadata Maestro simplifies the process of creating metadata in a format that can be easily shared and integrated with other data management systems. Key Features: ðŸ”¹User-Friendly Interface: The tool organises metadata elements into category tabs making it easy for users to navigate and fill out the required information. ðŸ”¹Compliance Checking: The tool uses a color-coded system to ensure metadata records comply with the MEDIN standard (Red for mandatory, green for conditional, white for optional). ðŸ”¹Multi-Standard Compliance: Metadata Maestro supports the creation of metadata compliant with MEDIN v3.1, GEMINI 2.3, and ISO19115: 2003 discovery metadata standards. ðŸ”¹Tooltip Assistance: Hovering over field titles provides descriptions and requirement rules, guiding users through the process of creating compliant metadata. ðŸ”¹Pre-Populated Controlled Vocabularies: Metadata Maestro comes with built-in controlled vocabularies to help populate key metadata elements accurately and consistently. ðŸ”¹Controlled Vocabulary Caching: Users can easily integrate additional controlled vocabularies from the NERC Vocabulary Server into the tool, enhancing metadata description capabilities. ðŸ”¹Templating: Users can create customisable metadata record templates by prepopulating selected metadata fields, making it easy to efficiently generate multiple related metadata records. Metadata Maestro v3.1. is available for download from the MEDIN GitHub.
