        "text": "FAQ\n\nThe following is a set of frequently asked questions (FAQ) sent into BODC. For further enquiries please contact the BODC Enquiries Officer.\n\n1. What data sets do you hold?\n\nTry where to find data for information on our data holdings and links to catalogues and inventories of data sets.\n\nTry products for information on our marine data products and collaborative data products.\n\nIf you still can't find what you want, or are not really sure what it is you need, please contact the BODC Enquiries Officer.\n\n2. I want to use some data for commercial purposes. What are the restrictions on use and will there be a charge?\n\nDetails of restrictions on use (given in the commercial data licence agreement) and charges can be obtained from the BODC Enquiries Officer. Currently charges only apply for commercial use of wave and current meter data, for tide gauge data less than three months old and for some CDROM products.\n\n3. I want a job. Who do I send my CV to?\n\nInformation on current vacancies can be found here.\n\n4. How good are these data I have just received from BODC?\n\nIt very much depends on what they are and when and how they were collected. Detailed information on data quality is given in quality control flags and supporting documentation. Find out about the data processing work carried out at BODC.\n\n5. I know what types of data I want but they don't seem to be there for the location and/or time I want. What do I do?\n\nMost of our data comes from specific research projects that run for a limited time. You may need to consider using modelled or remotely sensed data. For more information contact the BODC Enquiries Officer.\n\n6. Where do the data come from?\n\nThe data we hold come from a variety of sources\n\nscientific research and monitoring by academic and commercial bodies\n\nlong and short-term monitoring stations\n\ncoastal, shelf-sea and deep-sea measurements\n\nsurface sampling, water column and sea-floor measurements\n\nmultidisciplinary research projects collecting a variety of data types such as biological, chemical, physical and geophysical data.\n\n7. How are the data distributed?\n\nWe strive to make our data holdings accessible via our web site. We are currently enhancing our web-based data and metadata delivery capability. However not all of our holdings are accessible at present. We currently have a number of data delivery mechanisms.\n\nOnline delivery — access to some data sets via the web\n\nInformation and inventories — search various inventories, directories or catalogues to find information describing data sets either held by BODC or known to us\n\nData products — distribution of data (usually project data sets) on CDROM\n\n8. What do you do with the data?\n\nWe are the designated marine data centre for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Our approach to marine data management involves the careful storage, quality control and archiving of data so they are unaffected by changes in technology and will be available into the future. We distribute the data to scientists, educational establishments, industry and the public.\n\nOur tasks include\n\ncollecting data sets from different sources\n\narchiving the original data files\n\nprocessing data into a standard format\n\nquality controlling data\n\ncalibrating data where appropriate\n\nintegrating the data into relational databases\n\nfor future use, documenting each data set to provide crucial information about\n\ndata collection and analysis\n\nthe context of the data set\n\nthe data originator\n\nBODC processing and quality control\n\nredistributing the data"
