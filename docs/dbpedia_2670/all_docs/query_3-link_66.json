        "text": "In March 2009, Google purchased the Summa Mill from the Finnish paper company Stora Enso in order to convert it to a data center. In the first phase of the project, which was completed in September 2011, Google invested an initial â¬200 million. During this phase, more than 2,000 individuals from 50 different companies contributed to the project, including many local Finnish companies. Since 2009, we have invested â¬2 billion in the Hamina data center and related network infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to being a significant driver of economic growth and opportunity, we seek to fuel progress sustainably. We aim to run our business entirely on carbon-free energy, at all times, everywhere, by 2030. Our Hamina data center is at the forefront of this ambition, and we continue to innovate and improve our approach to sustainability and energy efficiency. A case in point is our technologically advanced, first-of-its-kind cooling system that uses seawater from the Bay of Finland, which reduces energy use.\n\nWeâre proud to call Hamina home and honored to be part of the local community.\n\nWhere do I get more information?\n\nFor community-related questions, please email\n\ngooglehaminadc@google.com.\n\nMembers of the media, please email\n\npress@google.com.\n\nFor answers to frequently asked questions, see our FAQ.\n\nRelated sites\n\nSustainability\n\nLearn more about Google's environmental initiatives and our quest to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy, everywhere, by 2030.\n\nPodcast: Where the Internet Lives\n\nLearn about the fascinating world of data centers in this podcast that explores the technology, people, and places that make the internet run.\n\nStories from Finland\n\nWatch community members share why it's good to have Google in their neighborhood.\n\nThe magic behind the cloud\n\nSee how Google Data Centers keep the internet up and running while supporting our communities.\n\nCelebrating 10 years in Hamina\n\nWatch people share how in 10 years, Google has become part of Hamina, and Hamina has become part of Google.\n\nEconomic impact report\n\nRead how Google Data Centers support the economy."
