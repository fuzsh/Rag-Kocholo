        "text": "The General Bathymetric Chart of the Ocean (GEBCO) aims to provide the most authoritative publicly-available bathymetry of the world's oceans. It operates under the joint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the IOC.\n\nBathymetric charts have been in existence since the 16th century, but only during the early 1900s were charts starting to become standardised. Since then, 5 editions of the GEBCO chart series have been published and in 1994 the first GEBCO digital atlas (GDA) was created via CD-ROM. The GDA is now available to download online.\n\nIn 2017 a new initiative, Seabed 2030 was launched by GEBCO and the Nippon Foundation with the ambitious aim “of producing the definitive, high-resolution bathymetric map of the entire World Ocean”.\n\nUK Contributions\n\nThe UK is heavily involved in bathymetric mapping and the GEBCO organisation through indviduals and organisations such as the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO), the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the British Geological Society (BGS):\n\nDr Helen Snaith (BODC at NOC) is Head of the Seabed 2030 Global Centre\n\nJamie McMichael-Phillips (UKHO representative in Singapore) is the Director of Seabed 2030\n\nPauline Weatherall (BODC at NOC) is the GEBCO Digital Atlas Manager\n\nData has been provided by BAS (UK Contact: Robert Larter), BODC and NOC (UK Contact: Pauline Weatherall) and the UKHO (UK Contact: Samuel Harper)\n\nSeabed 2030 funded Crowdsourced Bathymetry pilot programme is being developed in collaboration with the UKHO (UK Contact: Andrew Talbot)\n\nData has been submitted to EMODnet Digital Bathymetry via the NOC, BODC and BGS\n\nGEBCO has a number of groups, an overview of these and UK participation is found in the table below."
