        "text": "We research, teach and carry out impact activities to improve understanding and stewardship of our changing planetary life-support system. Our community of staff and students are tackling key societal challenges from forecasting impacts of future climate variability to the sustainable exploitation of Earth's resources.\n\nfor Earth and marine sciences, geology and geophysics\n\nWaterfront campus\n\nUnique location with outstanding facilities including world-leading analytical geochemical laboratories and our own research vessel\n\nof our research rated world-leading or internationally excellent\n\nAbout us\n\nThe School of Ocean and Earth Science is based at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. This is where we conduct our research-informed teaching. It's also the location of our 6 research groups:\n\nGeochemistry\n\nGeology and Geophysics\n\nMarine Biogeochemistry\n\nMarine Biology and Ecology\n\nPalaeoceanography and Palaeoclimate\n\nPhysical Oceanography\n\nOur scholars and educators join us from all over the world. They carry out fundamental research to explore the Earth’s natural support systems.\n\nThe impact of our work includes identifying and implementing nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change impacts. Other examples include sequestering atmospheric CO₂ in marine and terrestrial rock formations and through enhanced rock weathering.\n\nWe're educating the next generation of Earth and ocean scientists who’ll be taking on key global challenges. Our suite of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees includes supervision of around 150 PhD students. The School’s educational activities are underpinned with a UK top 10 position in the QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2023.\n\nOur Waterfront Campus is supported by a wide range of scientific facilities and equipment including a research catamaran equipped for coastal and shelf research.\n\nWe hold the UK's only Regius Professorship in Ocean Sciences, cementing our position as leaders in ocean science and maritime systems.\n\nResearch culture\n\nOur research aims to develop a deep understanding of the whole Earth system. We then apply new findings to secure our planet's future sustainability.\n\nOur top research priorities are:\n\nreducing uncertainty in knowledge of the climate system and climate variability\n\ndeveloping and testing solutions for greenhouse gas emission reduction and atmospheric removal\n\nevaluating the sustainability of natural resources on land and in the oceans\n\ninvestigating the impacts of natural change and anthropogenic stressors on marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles\n\ninvestigating connections between plate tectonics, mantle dynamics and natural hazards\n\ntranslating environmental data to knowledge\n\nWe transfer our knowledge to industry, public bodies and the third sector through the work of our Stakeholder Advisory Board which includes representatives from:\n\nthe Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science\n\nEDF UK\n\nthe Marine Management Organisation\n\nthe Defence Science and Technology Laboratory\n\nFugro GB Marine\n\nthe British Geological Survey\n\nAt the heart of our research activities is interdisciplinarity. It is woven into our 6 research groups, partnerships with the National Oceanography Centre and multi-disciplinary PhD supervisory teams and training activities. This drives the postgraduate research programmes offered by the:\n\nNational Oceanography Centre Southampton's graduate school\n\nUniversity of Southampton's doctoral college\n\nschool-led doctoral training partnerships\n\nFacilities and equipment\n\nOur home at the Waterfront Campus is shared with the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. Our many facilities include:\n\ngeochemical analysis facilities\n\nenvironmental sequencing facility\n\nresearch aquarium\n\nWe also maintain our own research vessel to support the School's education and research activities.\n\nLearn more about our extensive facilities and campus with our video tour.\n\nWaterfront Campus tour\n\nExplore facilities and equipment in our 8-minute YouTube video.\n\nFellowships\n\nWe welcome research fellows who want to play a key role in our research across ocean and Earth science. We tackle the most pressing scientific and societal challenges in the natural environment.\n\nEligible schemes\n\nOur support package helps researchers develop competitive fellowship applications to a wide range of schemes, including the following. Contact us for advice about schemes not listed here:\n\nThe Royal Society University Research Fellowship\n\nThe Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship\n\nNatural Environment Research Council Independent Research Fellowship\n\nEuropean Research Council Starting Grant\n\nSupport for applicants\n\nWe match applicants with a departmental host, who will provide:\n\nhelp with applications, including support letters and costings\n\nintroductions to potential collaborators\n\nintroductions to existing fellows\n\na tour of our department and facilities\n\nSupport for research fellows\n\nSuccessful applicants enter our formal fellowship scheme, which offers:\n\ntraining\n\naccess to the latest equipment\n\nprotected time away from teaching and administrative duties\n\nopportunities to enterPhD studentship and research grant competitions\n\nopportunities to move into a permanent academic role\n\nMoving into a permanent role when a fellowship ends (proleptic appointments)\n\nSometimes a research fellow will wish to move into a permanent academic role with us when their fellowship ends. This is called a proleptic appointment.\n\nHow research fellows move to a permanent role\n\nDuring the fellowship, we'll set the objectives the research fellow must meet to move to a permanent role.\n\nAfter 18 months, the school will review progress against objectives.\n\nIf the research fellow meets their objectives, they can apply for a permanent role.\n\nAs part of the application process, we'll ask them to give a research talk to colleagues, complete a teaching exercise, and undergo a panel interview.\n\nGet in touch to discuss a fellowship application\n\nWhatever stage you're at with your application, we'd love to hear from you.\n\nEmail our Deputy Head of School (Research), Professor Maeve Lohan: m.lohan@soton.ac.uk\n\nEquality, diversity and inclusion (EDI)\n\nWe're committed to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment where everyone is treated equally and fairly. Our Athena SWAN Bronze award recognised this commitment to gender equality in higher education.\n\nWe offer a broad and diverse teaching, research and support community with opportunities to tackle barriers to inclusion. Representatives from the School are actively involved in developing and implementing the Faculty of Environmental and Life Sciences and University EDI policies. Our staff also chair the faculty’s EDI committee.\n\nOur key priority is to consult with our School community to identify our equality and diversity priorities.\n\nVisit our EDI pages to learn more about our:\n\nEDI committee\n\npolicies and support\n\ngrants and awards supporting flexible working and diversity\n\nmentoring\n\nEDI resources and training\n\nOur courses\n\nContribute to the field of research in ocean and Earth science by completing a postgraduate research degree.\n\nPeople\n\nThe quality of staff and facilities at our unique waterfront campus, based at the National Oceanography Centre Southampton, enable us to make world-leading contributions in the fields of Earth and Marine Science.\n\nHead of School\n\nOur staff’s international research profile addresses the most pressing scientific and societal challenges in the natural environment.\n\nProfessor of Marine Chemistry\n\nOur skilled staff apply their research to a wide range of enterprise activities through effective collaborations with industry, government and charities. Many of these activities are focused on supporting the low carbon economy.\n\nProfessor in Marine Geology & Geophysics\n\nOur diversity of programmes equips our graduates with the skills, abilities and experiences to change the world.\n\nProfessor of Evolutionary Ecology\n\nWork with us\n\nJobs at Southampton\n\nWe’re recruiting.
