        "text": "The Mayor Sadiq Khan wants to tackle London’s housing crisis and is working with local councils, housing associations and developers to build the homes Londoners need.\n\nThat’s why he’s launched Homes for Londoners.\n\nThe Mayor has secured more than £4.8 billion from Government to help start building 116,000 genuinely affordable homes by 2022, both for sale and for rent. The Mayor has been using the funding to support a range of affordable homes, in particular:\n\nhomes based on social rent levels - for people on low incomes\n\nLondon Living Rent homes - helping Londoners on average incomes save for a deposit to buy their first home\n\nLondon Shared Ownership homes - for people who want to buy but cannot afford to do so on the open market.\n\nThe Mayor's aim is for half of all new homes in London to be genuinely affordable. He is working with partners to get more affordable homes built on empty public land.\n\nHe’s also earmarked up to £50m to deliver move-on accommodation for people leaving hostels and refuges.\n\nAims\n\nHomes for Londoners is building more homes by:\n\nmaking sure the right policies and funding are in place to support developers, investors, housing associations and councils\n\nusing all land and planning powers to support public and private development, unlocking development sites and bringing forward surplus public land\n\nexploring and promoting innovative construction methods, and working with the construction sector to develop the skilled workforce required to build thousands of new homes for Londoners.\n\nThe Homes for Londoners board, chaired by the Mayor, is overseeing and guiding all of this work.\n\nBelow you can find out more about the programme and use our Homes for Londoners search tools to find about available property to rent or buy in your area."
