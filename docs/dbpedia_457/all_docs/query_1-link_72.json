A plethora of animal models of various neurological disorders has been introduced and used to delineate the mechanisms of cell death and highlight potential targets for neuroprotective or neurorestorative intervention strategies. With great enthusiasm, the complete deciphering of the human genome and the genetic information of various other species has been announced and raised the hope of a final victory over many fatal human diseases. Findings about the genetic or molecular causes of human disorders that were reproduced in animals and positive results from experimental therapies were generalized for human patients, and new experimental treatments were quickly transferred to clinics, sometimes speeded up by high expectations of the public as well as managers from pharmaceutical companies. However, by the same token, many clinical studies which were introduced on the basis of positive data with new pharmacological substances or effective procedures in animal models did not show positive results in humans, and several trials had to be stopped, due to adverse effects which led to a significant deterioration in some patients. From a multitude of substances tested in basic research models, only few have reached clinical testing in patients thus far. Among those substances are neurotrophic factors, mitochondria-stabilizing agents, anti-oxidants, anti-toxins, antibiotics, glutamate receptor and calcium channel blockers as well as caspase-inhibitors (Kermer and Bhr, 2002). However, none of them has so far led to a substantial breakthrough in neurological or psychiatric therapy. Thus, one has to ask why so many promising drugs with positive effects in basic research models failed in the clinic. This is not easy to understand, and there is certainly not a single answer. However, some general aspects can be mentioned which are discussed in more detail in the various chapters of this book: First of all, in animal models, the modes of application, the delay between onset of a pathology and therapy and many side effects are completely different to the human situation. Thus, a substance may show a profound effect after intraparenchymal or intraventricular application minutes after onset of ischemia in animals, but the systemic application hours after onset of a stroke in humans does Neuroprotection.

Secondly, as mentioned earlier, in standardized animal models, mostly young and otherwise healthy rodents are used. In contrast, patients with neurological disorders, e. g. stroke, are often old with a substantial co-morbidity, which may result in many cross-reactions of a new drug with existing medications and adverse effects that can not be anticipated in young and healthy animals. Finally, the time of onset, the course and the outcome of a given insult vary substantially in patients and, depending on the selection criteria for clinical studies, a potentially effective drug may be given to patients where there is nothing left to rescue at all, or the criteria which are used in animals to demonstrate efficacy are not available for patients (e. g. histological measure of cell survival rates or tissue preservations in animal models which can not be applied in human patients). As a consequence, the whole concept of developing or introducing new drugs on the basis of animal (model) data was challenged, and many big pharmaceutical companies stopped or significantly reduced their efforts to develop new “neuroprotective” substances in their basic research departments. Thus, it appears to be timely to present a comprehensive review on our current knowledge in the field to analyse the potential as well as the limitations of the available model systems for many highly relevant neurological disorders such as stroke, trauma, neurodegenerative disorders or inflammatory diseases of the CNS. Furthermore, it seems to be necessary to have a closer look at some general problems that evolve when data from animals, mostly young and healthy rodents, are to be translated into clinical settings in order to learn from the errors for our future planning of neuroprotective or neurorestorative therapies. Finally, new results from basic as well as applied research need to be presented and evaluated which may open completely new avenues for future therapy concepts. To that end, internationally recognized outstanding experts in their respective fields from several countries have contributed to this first edition of Neuroprotection – Models – Mechanisms – Therapies. We hope that this book provides a guideline for non-experts for a better understanding of the complexity of data that are generated in basic research experiments and the pitfalls of translational research on the one hand and a detailed overview and basis for discussions and future developments in the field for academics involved in basic research or applied neurosciences on the other.

Among these, in vitro models with primary cultures of cerebral cells permit stroke pathophysiology to be examined on a molecular level, while animal models (mainly mouse and rat) are used to evaluate medical intervention. There is a highly complex sequence of events leading to the eventual ischemic cerebral damage that follows a well-defined spatio-temporal pattern. Overwhelming excitotoxicity leads to early necrotic cell death in what is to become the core of the infarction, while the tissue damage in the surrounding zone called penumbra happens on a longer time scale. The excitotoxic or inflammatory mechanisms are milder, bearing the biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. The brain cells, challenged by such a large-scale assault, activate endogenous protective programs. These have been studied by experimentally inducing ischemic tolerance (i. e. ischemic preconditioning). Importantly, cerebral ischemia not only affects the brain, but also impacts other systems. For example, stroke induces dramatic immunodepression through over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system. As a result, severe bacterial infections such as pneumonia occur. The complex signaling cascades not only decide over cell survival in the brain and the neurological deficit, but also over mortality after stroke from extracerebral complications. Their ability to govern not only the maturation of the eventual infarction but also the immune system make them a promising target for intervention and the development of neuroprotective drugs.\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the US more than 600,000 people per year suffer from strokes, and among acutely hospitalized neurological patients stroke patients make up the largest share – about 50 %. Currently, there are about 4 million stroke survivors [1] in Neuroprotection. Models, Mechanisms and Therapies. Edited by Mathias Bhr Copyright c 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim ISBN 3-527-30816-4\n\n4\n\n1 Stroke\n\nthe US. Mortality from stroke is an estimated 25 %, which makes it the third major cause of death in industrialized countries. Due to the high rate of severe permanent disability, stroke is a burden not only for the affected patients and their families, but also for national economies: In the US, it is estimated that the annual costs caused by strokes ranges between 30 and 40 billon dollars [2, 3]. In the UK, the cost of one individual patient amounts to £ 30,000 over 5 years [4]. The term stroke accommodates a variety of different conditions. About 85 % of all strokes are caused by cerebral ischemia due to vessel occlusion. Primary cerebral bleeding is rare in comparison –15 %. Of the ischemic strokes, 75 % are caused by emboli, of either arterial or cardial origin, while microvascular occlusion, i. e. hyalinosis or in-situ thrombosis is responsible for 20 % of cases. Hemodynamic ischemia, caused by stenoses of brain-supplying arteries, account for less than 5 % of ischemic strokes [5, 6]. The prospective risk of suffering an ischemic stroke is partially a function of social and behavioral (nutrition, tobacco use, stress) factors and longstanding disorders like hypertension, diabetes, disorders of cholesterol and lipid metabolism, and obesity. Atherosclerosis is not only the main underlying condition in ischemic stroke, but also in coronary heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. Moreover, the genetic background of affected individuals is coming under increasing scientific scrutiny, as might be expected for familial stroke conditions like CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucencephalopathy), which is characterized by relapsing subcortical ischemia. The condition is caused by a mutation in the notch3-gene on chromosome 19 [7, 8]. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactate acidosis, stroke-like episodes) is another rare familial stroke disorder, characterized by migraine, grand-mal seizures, and recurrent cortical infarctions. The condition is caused by a range of mutations in the mitochondrial genome, which explains its maternal inheritance. The severity of the phenotype depends mainly on the mutation locus and on the proportion of mutated mitochondrial genomes in the cerebral mosaic (for review see [9]). However, family and twin studies suggest that genetic factors are likely to be involved in common types of ischemic stroke, not just in rare and well defined familial stroke disorders [10–13]. A locus on chromosome 5q12 described for the Icelandic population seemed to increase stroke susceptibility significantly [14]. The responsible gene has been identified as phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D). The risk-conveying polymorphisms are located in the gene-regulatory part. This hints at a defect in the regulation of the encoded cAMP degrading protein [15]. Phosphodiesterase 4D belongs to a group of proteins that are drug targets in the treatment of asthma, erectile dysfunction and inflammation. Symptoms of focal cerebral ischemia depend on the individual affected vessel with its typical supply territory. Table 1 summarizes the frequency of affection [16] and the typical clinical syndromes for the main brain arteries. Stroke mortality is rated between 20 and 30 %. Unfavorable prognostic factors are old age, initial coma, papillary asymmetry, coronary heart disease and heart failure. Pyrexia and infections (pneumonia in particular) deteriorate the prognosis particularly during\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nthe initial phase (see below). Of the surviving patients, one third improves within a week, 40 % remain unchanged in their disability, and 20 % deteriorate further during the first week [17].\n\nTable 1.1\n\nTerritorial stroke syndromes.\n\nAnterior territory MCA\n\n(z60 %)\n\nACA AchA\n\n(4 %) (8 %)\n\nPosterior territory VA/BA (10 %) Cerebellum (PICA/ AICA) PCA\n\nhemiparesis mainly arm, hemihypaesthesia, hemianopia, dysphasia or neglect hemiparesis mainly leg, urinary incontinence, apraxia hemiparesis, hemihypaesthesia, hemianopia\n\n(7 %)\n\nvertigo, diplopia, bilateral hypaesthesia and paresis, crossed syndromes, amaurosis, ataxia, headache, coma headache, ataxia, vertigo, gaze palsy, facial weakness, deafness\n\n(9 %)\n\nhemianopia, dyslexia, visual agnosia\n\nA great deal of our knowledge about the pathophysiology of stroke comes from experimental research. The experimental animal models follow two main paradigms: One is the model of focal cerebral ischemia as a model of ischemic stroke. The other is the model of global cerebral ischemia as model of circulatory arrest. For obvious reasons, we will focus mainly at studies of focal cerebral ischemia. The bulk of experimental studies has been carried out with rats and mice, although some primates have been used. In rodents, ischemia is mostly induced by intravascular occlusion of the MCA, using a monofilament just exceeding the critical vessel diameter. Depending on the duration of occlusion, we distinguish permanent from transient ischemia models. The latter are also used as models for spontaneous reperfusion or for the state after successful lysis therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in humans, respectively. In models of cerebral ischemia perfusion to the brain is impeded by some form of manipulation. Since the essence of ischemic stroke is vascular occlusion, it is not surprising that in these models the extent of the eventual infarction can be predicted quite accurately from the degree of reduction in regional cerebral blood (rCBF) flow. Thus, if the rCBF is reduced to less than 25 % of normal the likelihood of infarction in a given volume of brain tissue greater than 95 %. In contrast, the likelihood of infarction is less than 5 % if rCBF does not fall below 50 % of normal. These thresholds have been established in comparative human PET and MRI studies [18] and correspond with experimental data from animal models [19]. Thus, the initial reduced rCBF determines the extent of the anticipated infarction. This, however, holds only with the provision that a spontaneous or therapeutic reperfusion does not take place. We now look at ischemic infarction as the result of a complex and prolonged process of infarct maturation rather than a simple result of reduced regional perfu-\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1 Stroke\n\nsion. As brain tissue has a high demand for oxygen and glucose, a disruption of perfusion leads to substrate depletion within few minutes, while toxic metabolites accumulate. The ensuing cellular energy deficit leads to a collapse of the established ion gradients and the membrane potential. Neurons and glial cells depolarize. Depending on the extent and the duration of this energy deficiency, the cells will suffer not only a functional but also a structural breakdown. The highly complex sequence of events within the ischemic area follows a fairly well defined stereotypic spatio-temporal pattern, which we will discuss below in more detail. The concept of the ischemic penumbra is crucial to the understanding of these mechanisms. The cascade of ischemic damage begins with excitotoxicity, the formation of reactive oxygen free radicals, the increasing tissue acidosis and the occurrence of periinfarct-depolarizations. It is followed by the stages of inflammation and programmed cell death (apoptosis). This is associated with DNA damage that, in turn, induces DNA repair programs. Although the process is not yet fully understood, we know that chromatin re-modeling, i. e. epigenetic mechanisms, and the activation of transcription factors induce complex gene programs. These changes initiate the expression of destructive proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis, as well as a host of protective genes that help repair the ischemic damage. It is the activation of these protective genes that builds up ischemic tolerance. Among the many newly discovered protective mechanisms, endogenous and exogenous cell replacement have met with a lot of interest. Apart from these autochthonous mechanisms of the brain tissue, there are other mechanisms on a systemic scale, which bear important clinical significance. For instance, the phenomenon of stroke-induced immunodepression can help to understand why stroke patients are at such high risk of contracting serious bacterial infections. Neuroprotective treatment must be based on an understanding of these mechanisms.\n\n1.2\n\nThe Penumbra Concept\n\nIn the ischemic brain, we commonly distinguish two tissue volumes – the core of the infarction and the surrounding zone, known as ischemic penumbra [20] – the underperfused and metabolically compromised margin surrounding the irrevocably damaged core. Core and penumbra are characterized by two different kinds of cell death: necrosis and apoptosis (which is also called programmed cell death or delayed neuronal cell death). The severe perfusion deficit in the core causes a breakdown of metabolic processes, cellular energy supply and ion homeostasis, which causes the cells to lose their integrity within minutes. Thus, acute necrosis of cell and tissue prevails in the core. In the penumbra, some residual perfusion is maintained by collateral vessels, which may be unable to maintain the full functional metabolism, but prevents immediate structural disintegration. However, over time, the alteration of cellular homeostasis causes more and more cells to die, and the volume of the infarction increases. The penumbra has thus to be considered as tissue at risk during the maturation of the infarct. In this region,\n\n1.4 Oxygen Free Radicals\n\napoptosis and inflammatory signaling cascades play an important role. It may initially constitute 50 % of the volume that will end up as infarction. The mechanisms that lead to delayed cell death within the penumbra are the subject of intense research, as they provide targets for a specific neuroprotective therapy in brain regions challenged by ischemia, but which are still viable (for a review see [19, 21]).\n\n1.3\n\nExcitotoxicity\n\nThe depolarization of neurons and glia due to local energy deficit causes the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and the release of excitatory amino acids into the extracellular space. Glutamate in particular, which, under normal cellular energy conditions, would be immediately taken up pre-synaptically or through astrocytes, now remains in the extracellular space where it accumulates dramatically. Through the activation of glutamate receptors NMDA and AMPA, the intracellular Ca2þ level rises. Furthermore, metabotropic glutamate receptors are activated through the induction of phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol triphosphate (IP3), and calcium is mobilized from intracellular stores. Furthermore, the over-activation of AMPA receptors causes a rise of sodium and chloride concentrations. Altogether, the result is a massive disturbance of ion homeostasis, accompanied by passive water influx and cell edema. Ultimately, these massive changes in cell volume account for osmotic cell lysis. This lytic type of cell death, also referred to as necrosis, is primarily observed in the core of the infarction. Cells that escape this most dramatic form of disintegration, as they can not found in the core but in the penumbra where excitotoxicity may be an initiator of molecular events that lead to apoptosis and inflammation (for an overview see [21, 22]).\n\n1.4\n\nOxygen Free Radicals\n\nAs a consequence of ischemia and particularly of reperfusion, reactive oxygen free radicals such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals are generated. Nitric oxide is generated via the activation of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS); it reacts with superoxide radicals and forms thus the highly reactive peroxy-nitrite radical. Further sources of oxygen free radicals in the damaged brain tissue are the breakdown products of the adenosine phosphates, which contribute to radical production via xanthine oxidase and the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction. The many different radical species that are thus formed can react with virtually any cellular components (carbohydrates, amino acids, DNA, phospholipids) and damage them. The peroxidation of membrane lipids releases further radicals – and further glutamate. Oxygen free radicals gain even more\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1 Stroke\n\nsignificance when new oxygen reaches the damaged tissue by virtue of reperfusion, or in the penumbra where oxygen supply has not ceased entirely (overview in [21, 22]). Hypoxia itself as well as the elevated intracellular concentration of calcium ions and free radicals disrupt the function of neuronal mitochondria. Consequently, a so-called mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT) in the mitochondrial membrane may form. Besides impeding ATP production through loss of mitochondrial potential, the MPT leads to mitochondrial swelling, a burst of free oxygen radicals, and the release of pro-apoptotic molecules. Thus a vicious cycle of further disintegration is fuelled (see below, for review [21, 23]). This vicious cycle is counterbalanced in part by anti-oxidative enzymes like the manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and the cytosolic forms of the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD). These may prevent the breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane and, thus, the release of cytochrome C, which would be the trigger of apoptosis (see below and for review [24]).\n\n1.5\n\nTissue Acidosis\n\nIn the context of stroke pathophysiology, the proton balance is intimately linked with the glucose metabolism. With reduced oxygen availability, anaerobic glycolysis as only remaining source of ATP production leads to tissue acidosis. It has long been assumed that this acidosis was one of the main noxious mechanisms in ischemic stroke. This so-called ‘lactate-acidosis-hypothesis’ is often quoted as explanation for the “glucose paradox” of cerebral ischemia. This paradox refers to the observation that excessive supply of glucose, the most important source of energy of the brain, during focal cerebral ischemia does not reduce tissue damage as one should think but, instead, augments it [25]. However, by which mechanism this happens and, in fact, whether levels of acidosis reached in brain ischemia can generate brain tissue damage at all is still far from being clear. Possibly, the pH dependent transition of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and the release of iron from molecular storages lead to a facilitation of the Haber-Weiss reaction that forms toxic free oxygen radical species (see above). Besides the production of different species of oxygen free radicals, acidosis also interferes with intracellular protein synthesis. However, the lactate-acidosis-hypothesis is not unchallenged. Particularly the fact that acidosis blocks the NMDA-receptor and thus has an anti-excitotoxic effect indicates the complexity of the role that acidosis plays in cerebral ischemia (for a review [21]). A similarly hotly debated topic are the findings on hyperglycemia during stroke. Experimental data from animal models show a detrimental effect of hyperglycemia during focal cerebral ischemia [26–28]. Clinical data also suggest that hyperglycemia during the acute phase of stroke worsens prognosis [29–31]. Persisting hyperglycemia beyond the acute phase is also an independent prognostic factor for larger infarct volume and poorer functional outcome in stroke patients [32]. It is a matter of debate whether these observations are due to a causal relationship or if hypergly-\n\n1.6 Peri-infarct Depolarizations\n\ncemia is a mere epiphenomenon, possibly due to a stress reaction (i. e. an effect of concomitant catecholamine and glucocorticoid release proportional to initial tissue damage) [34, 34]. The controversial role of an associated lactate-acidosis has already been discussed. An alternative concept is the glucocorticoid hypothesis [35]. It suggests that hyperglycemia enhances the release of glucocorticoids, which are also released during ischemia in the sense of a stress reaction. Glucocorticoids have been shown to have a direct cytotoxic effect [36] and the blockade of glucocorticoid receptors does reduce the damaging effect of hyperglycemia [35]. On the other hand hyperglycemia and acidosis have a protective effect in vitro [37, 38], and some experimental studies demonstrate that hyperglycemia can also have a beneficial effect under special circumstances [39, 40]. However, a recent study on humans seems to shed light on this controversy. Perfusion and diffusion MR imaging and MR spectroscopy shows that stroke patients with hyperglycemia have a higher lactate accumulation in the penumbra. While the perfusion-diffusion-mismatch (as a measure of the size relation of penumbra and core) was similar in the normoglycemic and hyperglycemic groups, the eventual infarct size and disability scores were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group [41]. While it could still be argued that initially hyperglycemic patients were also likely to be longstanding or latent diabetics with an overall worse microvascular state, we take this study- which links in with much of the experimental animal data – as strong indicator for the vulnerability of the penumbra to hyperglycemia. Indirectly, it also corroborates the lactacidosis theory, which, however, still lacks direct proof.\n\n1.6\n\nPeri-infarct Depolarizations\n\nThe anoxic as well as excitotoxic depolarization of neurons and glia increases the concentration of glutamate and potassium in the ischemic core. These diffuse into the penumbral zone where they induce the electrochemical depolarization of more neuronal and glial cells that are “just managing” under the circumstances of oligemia. Depolarization in this context is not to be confused with short-lived action potentials, but means sustained depolarization of the entire cell membrane, a breakdown of the membrane potential that has to be actively rectified. Depolarization also causes a further significant increase in extracellular glutamate and potassium. Thus, waves of sustained electrochemical depolarization spread from the core of infarction into the penumbra, bearing similarity with Leao’s spreading depression. These waves are called peri-infarct depolarizations [42–44]. Peri-infarct depolarizations occur with a frequency of 1–4 per hour and have been detected by functional MRI [45] and near infrared spectroscopy [46]. Since active rectification of the membrane potential requires energy, these peri-infarct depolarizations contribute further to the metabolic compromise and each wave turns a larger area of the penumbra towards irrevocable infarction [43, 44, 47, 48]. In addition, periinfarct depolarizations seem to compromise the impaired microcirculation within\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1 Stroke\n\nthe penumbra even further [49]. Peri-infarct depolarizations have been detected in patients with head trauma [50].\n\n1.7\n\nInflammation\n\nThe early stage of inflammation, which starts a few hours after the onset of ischemia, is characterized by the expression of adhesion molecules in the vascular endothelium as well as on circulating leukocytes. Thus, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium and transmigrate from the blood into the brain parenchyma, which is of decisive importance for stroke induced brain inflammation (for review see [51–53]). Newly expressed endothelial adhesion molecules like ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 facilitate the interaction between endothelium and leucocytes as first step of transmigration of white blood cells from blood into the tissue. They interact with the b2 -integrins CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) and CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) that are, in turn, expressed on leucocytes [54–56]. Neutrophil granulocytes accumulate in the capillaries of the penumbra and interfere with the already impaired microcirculation [57]. Blocking this interaction with CD18, CD11, or ICAM-1 antibodies reduces not only the number of leucocytes but also the size of infarction [58–60]. ICAM-1 knockouts have also smaller infarcts than wild type mice [61]. Next to the b2 -integrins, other integrins that are more specific for lymphocytes like VLA-4(a4 b1) come into action, too. Consequently, blocking the a4 -component reduces also the volume of infarction [62]. A major part in inflammation is ascribed to the population of microglial cells. These cells are the primary immunoeffectors of the CNS and make up about 20 % of the entire glial mass, about the same proportion as neurons. Activation of microglia is a striking feature in the penumbra. The cells change their shape from highly ramified cells to a more plump and amoeba like form, and they proliferate. They also express a number of characteristic surface molecules (for instance MHC I and MHC II) and are capable of antigen presentation [63–66]. Similar to leukocytes, activated microglia cells are able to produce a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines (but also cytotoxic metabolites (especially oxygen free radicals such as peroxy-nitrite and superoxide) and enzymes (for instance cathepsins). In addition, microglia is phagocytically active. The inhibition of microglial activation turns out to be protective in experimental stroke models [67]. On the other hand, activated microglia have also been shown to release anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as TGF-b1) and growth factors [68]. Because of the Janus-faced nature of microglial products (destructive, e. g. free radicals, vs. protective, e. g. growth factors) the overall role of microglia in cerebral ischemia is not clear at present. It is very likely that microglia play different roles at different times, with protective or regenerative activities occurring days or even weeks after the onset of ischemia. Activated leukocytes (granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes) as well as neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, microglia) produce cytokines and che-\n\n1.7 Inflammation\n\nmokines [69, 70]. In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNFa, IL-1 and IL-6 play a major role as mediators of the inflammatory response. They are responsible for the transition from the early, excitotoxic phase to the inflammation phase (for a review: [51–53, 71]. Their regulation depends on transcription factors like NFkB, which, in turn, are activated by oxygen free radicals [72, 73]. CytokinemRNA and also the protein of TNFa and IL-1 can be detected only few hours after induction of an experimental focal ischemia [71]. Expression of IL-6 follows only after about 24 hours [74]. These cytokines are mainly released by microglial cells and macrophages [69, 70]. In stroke patients, it could be shown that the intrathecal concentration of IL-1 and IL-6 correlated with the infarct size [75]. Cytokine receptor antagonists reduce the infarct volume in animal models. For example, blockade of TNFa by TNF-binding proteins reduces brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia [76]. The role of TNFa is not entirely clear, however, as mice lacking the TNFa-receptor (TNFR2) have larger infarctions [77]. In part, these contrasting results may reflect a difference in signal transduction cascades activated by the two TNFa-receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 [78]. It is also arguable that an increased IL-6 induction may be responsible, since IL-6 knockouts do not have smaller infarctions than their litter mates [79]. Further to the induction of adhesion molecules, the above-mentioned cytokines also render the blood brain barrier more permeable and induce pro-thrombotic functions of the endothelium (for a review [80]). Not only can the pro-inflammatory cytokines be observed, but anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-1b or IL-10 also induced. By down-regulating the inflammation, these cytokines have a protective effect in the context of cerebral ischemia [81–84]. The neuroprotective action of TGF-b1 is well known (for review see [85]). Interestingly, this cytokine seems to play an important part in immunological tolerance. As in ischemic tolerance (see below), it is possible to induce a tolerant state towards ischemia. This protection is induced by immunogenetic proteins (for instance myelin basic protein, MBP) and mediated by a certain lymphocyte population expressing TGF-b1 [86–88]. In contrast to ischemic tolerance, immunological tolerance is longer lasting. Protection lasts for months, whereas in ischemic tolerance it lasts no longer than 7 days. Apart from cytokines, there are two other proteins that dominate the inflammatory phase: the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2). Focal cerebral ischemia models have shown that iNOS is induced on the mRNA as well as on the protein level [89]. Protein expression reaches its height after 24 hrs. By inhibiting the expression of iNOS the size of experimental infarcts can be reduced by about 30 %, even if treatment is undertaken only 24 hours after the onset of ischemia [90, 91]. Nitric oxide (NO), which is produced in much greater amounts by iNOS than by the constitutional NO synthases, acts via the formation of peroxynitrite highly cytotoxic [92]. NO triggers apoptosis not only through peroxynitrite but also via the induction of p53, which probably causes direct DNA damage [93]. COX-2 is mainly generated in the penumbra [94]. The enzyme has a destructive effect on the penumbral tissue, mainly through producing oxygen free radicals and toxic prostanoids (for review see [51, 53]). This seems a likely hypothesis, as both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 have\n\n11\n\n12\n\n1 Stroke\n\na protective effect [95, 96]. COX-2 as well as iNOS are promising targets for the treatment of stroke patients because blocking them is still effective even 6 to 24 hours after ischemia [91, 96]. Not only the activated residual microglia, but also monocytes from the circulating blood migrate into the affected brain tissue. This transmigration is mediated by a chemokine, the monocyte-attractant protein 1 (MCP-1), which is induced 1 to 2 days after ischemia and causes immigration of monocytes [97]. Moreover, about a third of these transmigrated cells differentiate within 14 days post stroke into microglial cells – virtually indistinguishable from autochthonous microglia [98]. A trans-differentiation into astrocytes has also been observed [99, 100], but our group has not been able to reproduce this finding [101]. Irrespective of that, the important role of astrocytes during inflammation has been recognized; producing both pro-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective factors such as erythropoietin (EPO), TGF-b1, or metallothionein 2 [85, 102, 103]. In general, much further study needs to be conducted before the complex role of inflammation in cerebral ischemia is sufficiently understood to be able to specifically block the damaging proteins and foster protective elements during the inflammation process in stroke.\n\n1.8\n\nDamage to the Blood–Brain-Barrier\n\nThe function of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) depends on the integrity of its cellular matrix which consists of endothelial cells, basal lamina, and astrocytes. Cerebral ischemia causes damage to this matrix and its intercellular signal exchange. Central to these damaging processes are proteases like cathepsins, plasminogen activators (PA), and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). The action of the MMPs, a group of more than 20 zinc-endopeptidases, has been extensively studied. Proteolytic destruction of the basal membrane by the MMPs permits the immigration of leukocytes and promotes vasogenic edema. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are expressed within 1 to 3 hours after cerebral ischemia; the level of their expression correlates with the level of BBB-breakdown, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation and the extent of eventual neuronal damage [104–106]. Pharmacological inhibition of the MMPs prevents this breakdown and reduces stroke volumes. Mice with target disruption of MMP9 are partly protected from the effects of ischemia [107, 108]. Of the plasminogen activators, tPA is best known. In the brain, tPA is expressed mainly in neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Studies of mainly primary cortex neurons have shown that tPA acts also as neurotoxin [109], and experiments on tPAknockouts have produced conflicting data [110, 111]. Since recombinant tPA is the sole licensed drug for thrombolytic therapy, these findings reflect also on current therapeutic practice. tPA has furthermore been shown to induce MMP-9 and, thus, – at least indirectly – damaging the BBB [112]. The same holds probably for the recombinant tPA. This may explain why such a high number of secondary hemorrhages have been observed after thrombolytic stroke therapy [106, 113,\n\n1.9 Programmed Cell Death and Apoptosis\n\n114]. Animal experiments showed that delayed rtPA treatment – mimicking reallife delays in treatment – lead to significantly greater damage to the BBB and a major increase in mortality The pharmacological inhibition of MMPs can reverse this effect of rtPA [115]. In addition, tPA enhances NMDA-mediated calcium signaling and subsequent excitotoxic neuronal injury [116]. It is a matter of controversy, whether this detrimental effect is due to a cleavage of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor by tPA [117]. The example of rtPA demonstrates once again that in order to refine treatment of ischemia, a thorough understanding of the complex mechanisms is indispensable. The development of effective and low-risk thrombolytic treatment is, of course, still one of the main objectives of pharmacological stroke research [113]. One promising approach is the development of novel plasminogen activators, such as recombinant desmodus rotundus salivary plasminogen activator (DSPA-a1; Desmoteplase). Experimental evidence indicates that Desmoteplase has pharmacological and toxicological properties superior to rtPA [118].\n\n1.9\n\nProgrammed Cell Death and Apoptosis\n\nApoptosis follows a similar time schedule as inflammation. It sets in after a few hours and continues over days. It is the commonest form of cell damage in the penumbra and is very distinct from the rapid neuronal and glial death in the adjacent ischemic core, where pan-necrosis is complete within few hours. In necrosis, it is the cellular edema that leads to osmolysis (see above). The released cell contents are a potent inflammatory stimulus as discussed above. Caspases, a group of proteases, has a pivotal role in apoptosis. They facilitate the “orderly” destruction of the cell, which is characterized by a condensation of both nucleus and the cell as a whole. The cell contents are fragmented into so-called apoptotic bodies. Endonucleases fragment the cell’s DNA into typical strands of 180 bp length. Other morphologic criteria of apoptosis are membrane blebbing and shrunk cytoplasm with morphologically intact organelles. While the terms “delayed neuronal death” (DND) and “programmed cell death” (PCD) are often used synonymously with “apoptosis”, the two former may well occur without the typical features of the latter. Although most experimental studies show some biochemical evidence for apoptosis to have taken place, histological features are often missing to substantiate the claim. This has led some researchers to question apoptosis as an actual feature of ischemia. A number of reviews have dealt extensively with the significance of apoptosis in the pathophysiology of ischemia (for example [21, 22, 119–122]). This is why we shall focus here on some of its mechanistic aspects in this context. Essentially, apoptosis can be triggered in two ways, by intrinsic (i. e. basically mitochondrial) or extrinsic activation. Binding to the Fas-receptor, for example by TNF-a, triggers the extrinsic pathway. Intrinsic triggers of apoptosis in the context of ischemia are elevated concentrations of intracellular calcium, reactive oxy-\n\n13\n\n14\n\n1 Stroke\n\ngen species, and glutamate as well as increased DNA damage. Through damage to the mitochondrial membranes, both pathways directly or indirectly lead to the activation of caspases. The caspases are a hierarchic group of at least 14 cysteine-dependent and aspartate-specific proteases. Their inactive precursor proteins exist in every cell and can be activated through cleavage. Apoptosis is essentially an active and in itself energy dependent cellular deconstruction process. In cerebral ischemia, the caspases 1, 3, 8, and 9 are involved, of which the caspases 8 and 9 are the initiators of a signal cascade that activates the so-called execution caspase 3. Caspase 1 is predominantly engaged in cytokine activation (for review see [119, 121]). Caspase 3 is of predominant importance not only in the context of cerebral ischemia [122], and its genetic or pharmacological inhibition is not only in this context neuroprotective [124, 125]. The substrates degraded by caspase 3 are DNA repair enzymes like poly-(ADPribose)-polymerase (PARP) and the DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). The latter is important for the repair of double strand breaks. PARP recognizes single strand disruptions and mediates self-repair of the DNA through swift auto-modification with synthesis of highly negatively charged, long and branched ADP-ribose molecules. This process utilizes ATP and thus taps the cellular energy pool. Although not universally accepted, this ATP consumption by PARP is widely believed to be in itself cytotoxic. PARP is also capable of inducing caspase-independent cell suicide via the so-called apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF; see below; [126]). This helps to explain also the partial failure of caspase inhibitors in some models of cerebral ischemia. The genetic or pharmacological blockade of PARP has, however, been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke [127–129]. Of significance is the cleavage by caspase 3 of the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD). ICAD is thus activated and causes the characteristic feature of “laddering” that has been described in all stroke models (for review see [130]). The term laddering draws on the regular appearance of those DNA-fragments as ladder-like bands on a gel electrophoretic separation. The length of the resulting DNA fragments reflects the complex structure of eukaryotic genetic information in the chromatin. Chromatin is a structure, in which most of the DNA is enclosed by specific proteins, the histones (see epigenetics), leaving only few positions accessible for endonucleases. Complete apoptotic laddering leaves DNA-oligomers of about 140 to 180 base pairs in length, which do no longer contain any useful genetic information. Apart from destroying genetic information, caspases also degrade structure proteins of the nucleus and cell, such as laminin, actin, and gelsolin (for a review [120]). Cytochrome C is not only an essential part of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain and hence for the energy production in the cell, but also a crucial mediator in the caspase activation cascade [131, 132]. On the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, stimulation of the Fas-receptor leads to the formation of the “death-inducing signaling complex” (DISC). DISC activates caspase 8 from its precursor protein, which, in turn, activates “Bid”, a pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family (see below). Bid then induces the liberation of cytochrome C from the mitochondrial membrane. Other members of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family are Bad and Bax, im-\n\n1.10 Ischemia-induced DNA Damage, DNA Repair\n\nportant on the intrinsic pathway. Their activation leads to their translocation into the outer mitochondrial membrane and to the establishment of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), leading to the release of cytochrome C. Another way of its release from mitochondria is obviously direct membrane damage by free radicals (for review see [130, 132]). Cytochrome C, together with the cytosolic protein Apaf-1, forms the caspase precursor protein, and, using ATP, the so-called apoptosome. The apoptosome activates caspase 9 through cleavage from its precursor [133]. Whether cytochrome C is eventually released depends, however, on the balance of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family like Bid, Bax, Bad, and Bag and their anti-apoptotic counterparts Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (for review see [134]). Prevailing expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL results in clearly smaller infarction after focal cerebral ischemia [135–137]. Treatment with a Bcl-xL fusion protein containing the TAT domain of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for cell penetration acts also neuroprotectively in models of ischemia [138, 139]. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL seem to have a stabilizing effect on the mitochondrial membrane; they prevent the formation of MPTP, the ensuing cytochrome C liberation, and the formation of AIF (for review see [132]). Not only the reinforcement of antiapoptotic factors but also the attenuation of pro-apoptotic proteins may be neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia. For instance, the phosphorylation of Bad leads to its sequestration by the protein 14-3-3 and thereby to its inactivation [140]. The PI3K/Akt-pathway, utilized by many neurotrophic factors such as erythropoietin (see below: endogenous neuroprotection), plays an essential role in this [102, 141]. It has been reported that Akt has been activated during cerebral ischemia [142]. Whether this has a functional impact in stroke remains unclear at the moment. Another important protein group involved in stroke are the members of the IAPgroup (inhibitors of apoptosis proteins). The over-expression of the X-chromosomelinked IAP (XIAP) has been shown to be protective in stroke models [143]. IAPs act either indirectly by inhibiting the apoptosome or directly inhibiting caspase 3 (for review see [132]), but can themselves be blocked by other proteins such as DIABLO (in mice, the human homologue is Smac) that is physiologically localized in mitochondria. DIABLO is released after focal ischemia and binds to XIAP. It is yet unclear what its function is during focal ischemia [144]. The data discussed show, however, that apoptosis underlies a complex regulation process which is controlled at many levels.\n\n1.10\n\nIschemia-induced DNA Damage, DNA Repair, and p53 as Genotoxic Sensor\n\nThe emergence of DNA damage and its repair functions in the context of focal cerebral ischemia are particularly interesting. DNA damage is caused by oxygen free radicals (see above). Particularly the interaction of hydroxyl radicals with DNA results in strand breaks and base alterations. Hydroxyl radicals have a very short half-life – with the exception of peroxynitrite, formed from NO and super-\n\n15\n\n16\n\n1 Stroke\n\noxide – and are unlikely to reach the nuclear DNA from outside the cell. They are more likely to be produced in close proximity to the nucleus as a homolytic cleavage product of peroxynitrite, which has the ability to diffuse over longer distances. Under physiological circumstances, DNA lesions are generated with a frequency of about 10,000 events each day [145]. They are recognized and repaired efficiently, provided the repair enzymes are intact and not overloaded. In the wake of ischemia and reperfusion, the tissue is flooded with oxygen free radicals causing abundant DNA damage. Alterations that are typically caused by free radicals [146] have been found in the mouse model of transient focal ischemia, where a massive increase in DNA damage was observed 10 to 20 minutes after reperfusion. Foremost, 8-hydroxy-deoxy guanosine becomes much more prevalent in both nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA after ischemia [147–150]. These alterations are repaired partially within 4 to 6 hours, and the increase in repair activity is proportional to the degree of DNA damage [148, 151]. There are three basic DNA repair mechanisms – base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and what is known as mismatch repair. BER seems to be of particular significance in ischemia. During BER, DNA glycosylases excise damaged or modified bases. The thus generated purine and pyrimidine-free sites (AP-sites) are eliminated from the damaged DNA strand by AP-endonucleases (apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases) and replaced by DNA-polymerase b and DNA-ligase with a short strand of 1 to 4 nucleotides [147] based on the complementary blueprint of the remaining undamaged strand. Apart from oxidative DNA damage, deamination of cytosine may produce uracil. In BER, such alterations are sorted out by uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG). We found that knockout mice deficient in UDG have substantially larger infarctions than the wild-type controls (Endres, Meisel, Dirnagl, Jaenisch et al. unpublished). DNA repair is neither inexhaustible nor infallible. Persisting mutations are the result of erroneous DNA repair. In models of transient focal ischemia, a dramatic increase in the frequency of mutations has been observed. Half of them were transitions and transversions. The other half were deletions and occasional insertions, mostly resulting in a frame shift (frame shift mutations) of the open reading frame (ORF). It seems that not only the exhaustion of the repair capacity, but also an impaired proofreading ability in the exonuclease-negative DNA polymerase b expressed in the brain is to blame for these mutations. The major role of DNA repair is to ensure transcription of mRNA from intact genes. An obvious consequence of mutations is instability of the genetic information that may lead to faulty proteins, eventually resulting in either cellular malfunction, disintegration, or spawning of tumors [147, 150]. The maintenance of swift and effective DNA repair is therefore essential in postmitotic cells like neurons. In order to adapt to an increased demand, a cell may try to increase its repair efficiency [151]. Apoptosis is another way of avoiding erroneous protein synthesis and the potential emergence of tumors (see above). Both mechanisms are found in focal cerebral ischemia, and it seems to be the extent of the damage that determines which scenario will prevail [147, 149].\n\n1.11 Epigenetics\n\nWe have several reasons to believe that the tumor suppressor protein p53 represents the molecular switch on the crossroads of attempted repair and apoptosis [152]. (1) p53 is mainly induced by DNA damage. (2) p53 can halt the cell cycle, and thus prevent the division of non-neuronal cells before complete repair. (3) p53 can induce apoptosis if the damage is extensive [153]. In most models of ischemia, it could be shown that p53 had been induced. [154, 155]. The fact that p53 knockouts have significantly lower infarct volumes accords with p53’s pro-apoptotic function. However, it seems paradoxical that heterozygous p53þ/– mice show even smaller infarctions [156]. An attenuated expression of p53 seems to give better neuroprotection than a total lack of it, which hints at the dual function of the gene. It would be interesting to find out if longer-term neoplasias could be the downside of this short-term effect.\n\n1.11\n\nEpigenetics\n\nExperimental work of the last years has shown that, apart from DNA repair, epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation and histone modification play also an important role in ischemic stroke. The transcriptional gene expression is not only regulated by transcription factors, but depends also on epigenetic mechanisms that mainly modify the chromatin structure. In the mammalian genome, DNA methylation is a covalent, postreplicative modification at the carbon 5 position of the pyrimidine ring of cytosine bases (m5C); it typically occurs in CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b). The main function of DNA methylation lies in the regulation of gene transcription. Methylated genes are barred from expression in a process called “gene silencing” (for a review [157]. First of all, many transcription activators are unable to bind to methylated loci at all. Furthermore, there is a group of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBD [158]) that form a complex with histone deacetylases (HDAC), which, in turn, by deacetylation of histones, cause the chromatin structure to condense. Through this condensation, the gene regulatory loci become inaccessible for transcription factors. Five proteins of the MBD family are known to date: MBD1 through 4 and MeCP2. HDACs deacetylate predominantly histones H3 and H4. Conversely, acetylated histones, open up the chromatin structure, permitting the gene regulatory regions (promoters, enhancers) to become active again, and, ultimately, enabling gene transcription through binding of transcriptional activator proteins. While the state of deacetylation or acetylation of a CpG hypomethylated promoter or enhancer region is comparatively volatile, DNA hypermethylation of these regulatory regions results in a more stable repression [159, 160]. Initially, DNA methylation was thought to be of biological significance only for fundamental phenomena of cell biology like embryogenesis and differentiation, in X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and in several neoplastic diseases. In more recent years, its pathophysiological role in a number of further con-\n\n17\n\n18\n\n1 Stroke\n\nditions has been recognized, such as fragile-X-syndrome, ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromere instability, Facial anomalies) syndrome, or Rett syndrome (for a review [157, 161]). For the first time, we were able to detect the involvement of DNA methyltransferase 1 and DNA methylation in an acute disease, such as ischemic stroke [162– 164]. In addition, a complex pattern of an alterated expression of MBD-family proteins has been described in a model of transient cerebral ischemia [165]. The inhibition of DNA methylation had a protective effect, as had manipulations to the acetylation state of histones. Pharmacological inhibition of a histone acetyltransferase with trichostatin A (TSA) caused enhanced histone acetylation in vitro as well as in vivo and proved to be neuroprotective ([162, Meisel et al. unpublished results). A similar effect was shown recently in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease [166]. Thus, the epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation may provide yet another axis of neuroprotective therapeutic intervention.\n\n1.12\n\nGene Expression\n\nThe role of transcription factors such as AP-1, HIF-1 and NF-kB in the context of cerebral ischemia has been recognized for much longer [167–169]. They initiate the transcriptional activation of complex programs of gene expression (for a review [170, 171]). The whole hierarchical system of such programs has been unraveled over more than 15 years. Within few hours the transcription of immediate early genes such as c-fos is activated. Some of these, in turn, form transcription factors such as AP-1. They induce a variety of genes that may have protective or destructive effects. Cells that survive the ensuing biochemical negotiation finally express genes that contribute to a structural re-organization and thus to greater plasticity. A great many of the genes involved have been subject to pathophysiological studies in stroke. Their functional significance has been studied either in descriptive ways, i. e. by describing candidate genes on RNA or protein level or using transgenic technology. Especially knockout mice have been extremely useful for this approach. The genetic elimination of specific proteins in mice used for these experiments has been particularly enlightening for the untangling of the signaling cascades involved in and after stroke. In recent years, the advent of genetic screening methods has allowed for the systematic investigation of complex gene expression programs that are initiated by cerebral ischemia. In contrast to candidate-gene research, they permit a more unbiased approach. They are based on the assumption that focal cerebral ischemia does incite complex changes of gene expression. Not just a single, specifically targeted gene is examined for its role in the scenario of stroke but – ideally – all genes. For this new research paradigm terms have been coined like discovery science, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and cellomics. So-called high throughput technologies as well as a highly evolved bioinformatic methodology are a prerequisite for acquiring and managing the vast bulk of information involved. DNA micro\n\n1.13 Cell Replacement\n\narrays or SAGE technology facilitate the examination of global changes in gene expression on mRNA level (transcriptomics). Global changes on the level of protein synthesis can be described with a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identification techniques (proteomics). The first results of a number of studies using these techniques in the context of cerebral ischemia are now available [103, 172–174]. What do these results imply? First of all, they confirm that the assumption of the existence of complex stroke-induced programs of gene expression is correct. Secondly, they demonstrate that they follow a robust temporal and spatial pattern. Not only do the expression patterns differ between core and penumbra, but also within the penumbra, there are many spatial and temporal differentiations. This has even given rise to a concept of “multiple penumbras” [175]. Thirdly, this approach has not only confirmed many findings of candidate gene research but also underpinned our pathophysiological understanding. Thus, a number of heat shock proteins, anti-oxidative enzymes, growth factors, and pro- as well as anti-inflammatory proteins have been detected. Not just transcription factors, but a variety of proteins have been have been found to play essential roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA. Finally, proteins that contribute to structural and functional reorganization [103, 176–178] are thought to establish the molecular base of the functional healing potential after strokes. Not surprisingly, a number of hitherto unidentified genes have been brought forth by discovery science. Although the results of these screening methods give a great boost to stroke research and open doors to new insights, a full functional characterization of the differentially expressed genes will take many more years. Our understanding of the emerging network of gene expression increasingly depends on not only biological but also mathematical models. However, there are things we do know already; for instance that protein modifications are of great functional importance. Thus, the functional value of numerous proteins depends on their phosphorylation state. For example, the specific phosphorylation of the usually pro-apoptotic protein Bad prevents apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra. The differential function equals thus not simply differential gene expression, and genetic screening methods will never be sufficient to paint the full picture of stroke-induced molecular pathways. The same holds for proteomics, which, just like transcriptomics, neglects the functional importance of RNAs that do not code for proteins. These molecular pathways, however, potentially lead to new, neuroprotective therapies and open up new perspectives for fundamental issues like neuronal plasticity and stem cell research.\n\n1.13\n\nCell Replacement\n\nIn recent years, it has been shown in different models that ischemic brain injury induces neuron formation from neuronal stem cells. Such cells reside in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, in the subventricular zone below the lateral\n\n19\n\n20\n\n1 Stroke\n\nventricles, and periventricularly in the hippocampus. They can migrate into parts of ischemic lesions within the striatum, the dentate nucleus, and the hippocampal CA1 region [179]. It is still a matter of debate to what extent a similar neuroneogenesis also takes place within the penumbra in cortical regions. Neither is it entirely understood to what extent these migrating cells, that doubtlessly express neuronal markers, become functional. Observations so far indicate that it is not a very effective process and that most of the migrating cells perish. However, if these neuronal cells could be enabled or encouraged to assume the function of damaged neurons, this would imply another new therapeutic paradigm (for a review [180, 181]). Indeed, intrathecal infusion of growth factors like FGF-2 and EGF after global cerebral ischemia did not only stimulate the migration and the survival of these cells but resulted also in improved functional results both on cellular and on neurobehavioral level [182]. Astrocytes are newly formed in a similar fashion [183]. For future therapeutic evaluation, it should be kept in mind not only that growth factors such as erythropoietin, FGF-2, EGF, VEGF, SCF, and BDNF have this beneficial effect [182, 184, 185], but also that their expression depends on the stimulation of the NMDA receptor by glutamate [186]. A pharmacological blockade of this receptor with the intention of inducing neuroprotection could interfere with this effect and thus be counterproductive. This is yet another example of an incomplete understanding of the signaling mechanisms, leading to a paradox in the interpretation of our neuroprotective data. Bearing this in mind, it is needless to say that the ongoing experimental studies of cell replacement are still far from clinical implementation. However, the available experimental observations are very exciting: For instance, neural and also haematopoietic pluripotent cells differentiate into neuronal and glial cells when injected into infarction sites (for a review [187]). On the other hand, this potentially helpful strategy may have detrimental effects too. In a mouse model of stroke, for example, murine embryonic stem cells did not migrate into the damaged tissue, but produced highly malignant teratocarcinomas at the site of implantation, independent of whether or not they had been predifferentiated in vitro into neural progenitor cells [188]. As far as safety is concerned, an endogenous pathway of cell regeneration may be more promising. Bone-marrow-derived cells (BMDC) introduced into the brain possess a differentiation potential capable not only of forming microglia (see above; [98]), but also neurons. This apparent plasticity has been attributed to transdifferentiation [189]. However, more recent data suggest in the case of neurons that BMDCs not differentiate into but rather fuse with Purkinje cells in the brain. These observations suggest that cell fusion contributes to the maintenance of neurons [190]. One potential use for haematopoietic cells migrating from blood into ischemic brain tissue could be the therapeutic transfer of protective gene products such as growth factors [98].\n\n1.14 Endogenous Neuroprotection – Ischemic Tolerance\n\n1.14\n\nEndogenous Neuroprotection – Ischemic Tolerance\n\nIn the wake of ischemic stroke, not only cascades of destruction are induced, but also endogenous protective mechanisms are activated. These mechanisms are currently studied intensively. Central to this research are models of ischemic preconditioning. The idea behind ischemic preconditioning is to achieve a protected state of a cell, tissue, or whole organism by subliminal exposure to a noxious stimulus (trigger), which is applied just below the level at which damage would occur. The stimulus induces a protective state against insults that would normally be lethal. Subliminal ischemia (‘ischemic tolerance’), hypoxia, reactive oxygen free radicals, inflammation, etc. can serve as tolerance-inducing stimuli. After induction, there are two time windows within which ischemic tolerance can be observed. Early tolerance occurs after about 5 to 120 minutes following stimulation (classical preconditioning), while delayed preconditioning sets in after a latency of about 24 to 72 hours. Seven days after induction, the state of protection is no longer detectable [191, 192]. Studies of patients who had transient ischemic attacks (TIA) before suffering a persistent stroke indicate that ischemic tolerance may also exist in humans. Subsequent to a TIA, brain infarcts were smaller in comparison with patients without preceding TIA. As a TIA, by definition, does not lead to infarction, it may thus be considered as a stimulus that induces tolerance [193, 194]. Unlike severe ischemia, leading to stroke, a preconditioning stimulus induces exclusively protective, but not destructive signaling cascades. There are basically three stages of protective signaling that can be distinguished in delayed preconditioning. In the induction phase molecular sensors (mostly receptors, channels and regulators) are activated by transcription factors. During the transduction phase certain protein kinases, transcription factors and paracrine and autocrine mediators, such as growth factors, amplify the signal and thereby prepare the effector phase. In this phase, proteins with a direct protective impact (anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative) are switched on. These mechanisms are the molecular basis for ischemic tolerance and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (for a review [191–193]). Here, we want to give only a brief outline of the concept. On the basis of animal models in mice and rats as well as cell culture experiments, we were able to describe the following signaling cascade: In astrocytes, a tolerance-inducing hypoxic stimulus induces the transcription factor HIF-1 (hypoxia-induciblefactor-1). HIF-1 is one of the central sensors of hypoxia and induces the expression of erythropoietin (EPO; [102, 168, 196]). Erythropoietin is released by astrocytes and binds to the neuronal EPO-receptor. Via the activation of a protein kinase cascade, in particular phosphoinositol-3 kinase, the pro-apoptotic protein BAD becomes phosphorylated and thus inactivated [102]. This neuroprotective signaling cascade mediates approximately 50 % of the protection observed in our model [197]. The remaining 50 % of protection it does not account for suggest the presence of further mechanisms in ischemic preconditioning. As a matter of fact, beside this paracrine cascade, which is mediated by astrocytes and neurons, a number of\n\n21\n\n22\n\n1 Stroke\n\nother mechanisms have been described. A host of anti-excitotoxic, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, including programs for regeneration and repair, have been implicated so far (for a review [191–193]). Understanding these mechanisms may enable us in the future to induce or boost endogenous protection in patients as a novel strategy to safeguard the brain against hypoxic/ischemic damage. For example, EPO is a promising drug in stroke therapy. There is solid evidence that exogenously applied EPO is neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro models of cerebral ischemia [102, 198, 199]. Clinical phase I and II trials suggest that EPO is not only safe, but also beneficial in the therapy for acute stroke [200]. In addition, pharmacological inducers of ischemic tolerance in brain could become a promising tool in circumstances when ischemia can be anticipated, e. g. before cardiac or carotid surgery. For example, desferrioxamine, an approved drug for the treatment of hemosiderosis, induces robust ischemic tolerance by inducing erythropoietin in a HIF-1 dependent manner [197]. Combined, the above-mentioned results demonstrate that brain cells are not only challenged by deleterious mechanisms, but also activate innate programs to protect themselves from ischemia. However, cerebral ischemia does not only affect the brain parenchyma, but also other vital organs, in particular the immune system.\n\n1.15\n\nStroke Induced Immune Depression (SIDS)\n\nWithin three days after stroke, up to 61 % of the stroke patients develop fever [201– 205]. Findings from animal experiments show that pyrexia of more than 1hC does not only lead to a dramatic increase of the cytotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate [206], but also to a significantly larger volume of the infarction [207, 208]. Clinical trials demonstrated that both mortality and morbidity rise with the occurrence of fever in stroke [209, 210]. The most common cause of fever in the acute course of stroke is infection [201, 205, 211–213]. Infectious complications occur in 21 to 65 % of stroke patients [214]. Pneumonia is the most frequent infection in stroke patients [215] and a major mortality risk factor [216, 217]. Stroke patients have a much higher risk of developing severe bacterial infections. It is obvious that factors such as immobilization, reduced bulbar reflexes, drowsiness and, subsequently, a higher risk of aspiration promote pulmonary infections. Although these are risk factors for bacterial infection, they cannot fully explain the high risk of infection observed. A large meta-analysis showed that other factors had to be equally important. In particular, a reduced function of the immune system was postulated [218–220]. Very recently, we were able to prove that immunodepression following stroke causes severe bacterial infections [221]. In a mouse model we demonstrated that, three days after stroke, severe bacterial infections (mostly pneumonia and sepsis) develop spontaneously. Stroke induces an over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system and leads to a rapid, severe, and sustained lymphopenia as well as to a disturbed function of lympho-\n\n1.16 Conclusion\n\ncytes and monocytes. Interestingly, there is also evidence for an over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system within the first two days after stroke in humans [222]. Furthermore, we were able to show that a disturbed secretion of interferon-g from T cells and NK cells is central to these severe infections. Both a cellular reconstitution of the immune system and the application of interferon-g prevented infections. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system with the b-receptor-blocker propranolol not only prevented infections, but also dramatically reduced the high rate of mortality in this model [221]. Our studies are the first to provide a mechanistic explanation for the clinical phenomenon of increased susceptibility to infections after stroke [223]. Approaches to prevent infection after stroke seem to be desirable. Preventive anti-infective therapy is expected to reduce a number of negative prognostic factors such as fever, infection-induced arterial hypotension, and the systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, with the prevention of severe infections, an earlier mobilization and rehabilitation becomes feasible. In an experimental stroke model, we were able to demonstrate that preventive anti-infective therapy with an antibiotic after focal cerebral ischemia not only reduces mortality and the infarct sizes, but also decreases the functional deficit [224]. These experimental results lead to the initiation of a Phase IIb trial for preventive antibacterial shortterm therapy in patients with acute ischemic media-infarction (Preventive ANti-infective THERapy In Stroke; PANTHERIS, Berlin). Other groups initiated similar trials (A. Chamorro, Spain; M. Hennerici, Germany; personal communications).\n\n1.16\n\nConclusion\n\nDue to intensive experimental and clinical research, our pathophysiological understanding of cerebral ischemia has greatly improved over the last 15 years. Complex pathways involving excitotoxicity, oxidative and nitrosative stress, peri-infarct depolarizations, inflammation, and apoptosis-like mechanisms have been described in cell culture as well as animal models of cerebral ischemia. Despite impressive results in animal experiments on neuroprotection, the transfer of preclinical results into human stroke therapy has been so far been unsuccessful. Possible reasons for this dilemma include problems with the models used, the design of the clinical trials as well as the drugs, and they have been discussed intensively [21, 225, 226]. However, we believe that although we have often not been able to transfer our experimental results into human stroke therapy, some cautious optimism is justified. More and more experimental data demonstrate that the division of molecular mechanisms in “good” and “bad guys” is an improper simplification, and we need to gather more data in order to identify more suitable molecular targets. Since in stroke there are multiple pathways that cause cell death, it seems reasonable to develop combination therapies targeting all these mechanisms. In addition, the advances in understanding endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms provide new therapeutic options to improve tissue survival after stroke. Targeting systemic com-\n\n23\n\n24\n\n1 Stroke\n\nplications like severe bacterial infections in a preventive manner may also improve outcome. Thus, an ever more refined understanding of complex damaging cascades as well as the development of more complex therapeutic strategies will continue to be the basis for more successful therapies of stroke in the future.\n\nReferences 1 2 3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nSacco RL, Neurology 1997, 49:S39–44.
