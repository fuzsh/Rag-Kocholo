        "text": "Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDimachkie, Mazen M.; Barohn, Richard J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a group of rare disorders including polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and autoimmune necrotizing myopathies (NMs). The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies share many similarities. They present acutely, subacutely, or chronically with marked proximal and symmetric muscle weakness, except for associated distal and asymmetric weakness in inclusion body myositis. The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies also share a variable degree of creatine kinase (CK) elevation and a nonspecifically abnormal electromyogram demonstrating an irritative myopathy. The muscle pathology demonstrates inflammatory exudates of variable distribution within the muscle fascicle. Despite these similarities, the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a heterogeneous group. The overlap syndrome (OS) refers to the association of PM, DM, or NM with connective tissue disease, such as scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition to elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA), patients with OS may be weaker in the proximal arms than the legs mimicking the pattern seen in some muscular dystrophies. In this review, we focus on DM, PM, and NM and examine current and promising therapies.

During the past few years, the classification of inflammatory myopathy subtypes has been revisited progressively on the basis of correlations between clinical phenotypes, autoantibodies and histological data. Several syndromic entities are now more clearly defined, and the aim of the present review is to clarify the contribution of muscle biopsy in a setting of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies overlapping with systemic diseases. PMID:29154752\n\nIdiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarohn, Richard J.; Amato, Anthony\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) consist of rare heterogenous autoimmune disorders that present with marked proximal and symmetric muscle weakness, except for distal and asymmetric weakness in inclusion body myositis (IBM). Besides frequent creatine kinase (CK) elevation, the electromyogram confirms the presence of an irritative myopathy. Extramuscular involvement affects a significant number of cases with interstitial lung disease (ILD), cutaneous in dermatomyositis (DM), systemic or joint manifestations and increased risk of malignancy especially in DM. Myositis specific autoantibodies influence phenotype of the IIM. Jo-1 antibodies are frequently associated with ILD and the newly described HMG-CoA reductase antibodies are characteristic of autoimmune necrotizing myopathy (NM). Muscle pathology ranges from inflammatory exudates of variable distribution, to intact muscle fiber invasion, necrosis, phagocytosis and in the case of IBM rimmed vacuoles and protein deposits. Despite many similarities, the IIM are a quite heterogeneous from the histopathological and pathogenetic standpoints in addition to some clinical and treatment-response difference. The field has witnessed significant advances in our understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of these rare disorders. In this review, we focus on DM, polymyositis (PM) and NM and examine current and promising therapies. The reader interested in more details on IBM is referred to the corresponding chapter in this issue.

In this review the leading published studies related to the use of biological therapy in patients with myositis are analysed; mainly those with high methodological standards, that means randomized and controlled studies. Methodological drawbacks due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these complex diseases are also addressed. Up to now is not possible to ascertain the biologics as a recommended therapy in patients with myositis, at least based in the current evidence-based knowledge, although it can not be neglected as a therapeutic option in some clinical situations, taking into account the scarce of effective treatments in those patients, especially in refractory myositis. Future studies probably will help to better define the role of biological therapies in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

Other organs are frequently involved supporting that these are systemic inflammatory diseases. The IIMs can be sub-grouped into dermatomyositis, polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. The myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) identify other and often more distinct clinical phenotypes, such as the anti-synthetase syndrome with antisynthetase autoantibodies and frequent interstitial lung disease (ILD) and anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR autoantibodies that identify necrotizing myopathy. The MSAs are important both to support myositis diagnosis and to identify subgroups with different patterns of extramuscular organ involvement such as ILD. Another cornerstone in the diagnostic procedure is muscle biopsy to identify inflammation and to exclude non-inflammatory myopathies. Treatment effect and prognosis varies by subgroup. To develop new and better therapies, validated classification criteria that identify distinct subgroups of myositis are critical.. The lack of such criteria was the main rationale for the development of new classification criteria for inflammatory myopathies, which are summarized in this review, along with an historical background on previous diagnostic and classification criteria. As these are rare diseases with a prevalence of 10 in 100 000 individuals an international collaboration was essential, as was the interdisciplinary effort including adult and paediatric experts in rheumatology, neurology, dermatology and epidemiology. The new criteria have been developed based on data from more than 1 500 patients from 47 centers world-wide and are based on clinically easily available variables.

Beneficial effects of exercise have been reported on muscle performance, aerobic capacity and health in chronic polymyositis and dermatomyositis, as well as in active disease and inclusion body myositis to some extent. Importantly, randomized controlled trials indicate that improved health and decreased clinical disease activity could be mediated through increased aerobic capacity. Recently, reports seeking pathomechanisms of the underlying effects of exercise on skeletal muscle indicate increased aerobic capacity (i.e. increased mitochondrial capacity and capillary density, reduced lactate levels), activation of genes of aerobic phenotype and muscle growth programs and down regulation of genes related to inflammation. Exercise contributes to both systemic and within-muscle adaptations demonstrating that it is fundamental for improving muscle performance and health in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. There is a need for randomized controlled trials to study the effects of exercise in patients with active disease and inclusion body myositis. Orv.

The most common types are dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM), and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM). Patients typically present with sub-acute to chronic onset of proximal weakness manifested by difficulty with rising from a chair, climbing stairs, lifting objects, and combing hair. They are uniquely identified by their clinical presentation consisting of muscular and extramuscular manifestations. Laboratory investigations, including increased serum creatine kinase (CK) and myositis specific antibodies (MSA) may help in differentiating clinical phenotype and to confirm the diagnosis. However, muscle biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. These disorders are potentially treatable with proper diagnosis and initiation of therapy. Goals of treatment are to eliminate inflammation, restore muscle performance, reduce morbidity, and improve quality of life. This review aims to provide a basic diagnostic approach to patients with suspected IIM, summarize current therapeutic strategies, and provide an insight into future prospective therapies.

In follow-up to our study defining the major clinical subgroup phenotypes of JIIM, we compared demographics, clinical features, laboratory measures, and outcomes among myositis-specific autoantibody (MSA) subgroups, as well as with published data on adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients enrolled in a separate natural history study. In the present study, of 430 patients enrolled in a nationwide registry study who had serum tested for myositis autoantibodies, 374 had either a single specific MSA (n = 253) or no identified MSA (n = 121) and were the subject of the present report.

Other MSAs, including anti-synthetase, anti-signal recognition particle (SRP), and anti-Mi-2, were present in only 10% of JIIM patients. Features that characterized the anti-p155/140 autoantibody subgroup included Gottron papules, malar rash, \"shawl-sign\" rash, photosensitivity, cuticular overgrowth, lowest creatine kinase (CK) levels, and a predominantly chronic illness course.

Glucocorticoid-sparing agents are often given concomitantly with other immunosuppressive agents, particularly in patients with moderate or severe disease. As treatment of refractory cases of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies has been challenging, there is growing interest in evaluating newer therapies including biologics that target various pathways involved in the pathogenesis of IIMs. In a large clinical trial of rituximab in adult and juvenile myositis, the primary outcome was not met, but the definition of improvement was met by most of this refractory group of myositis patients. Rituximab use was also associated with a significant glucocorticoid-sparing effect. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) can be used for refractory IIMs or those with severe dysphagia or concomitant infections. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) utility in IIMs is generally limited by previous negative studies along with recent reports suggesting their potential for inducing myositis. Further research is required to assess the role of new therapies such as tocilizumab (anti-IL6), ACTH gel, sifalimumab (anti-IFNÎ±), and abatacept (inhibition of T cell co-stimulation) given their biological plausibility and encouraging small case series results. Other potential novel therapies include alemtuzumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody which binds CD52 on B and T lymphocytes), fingolimod (a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that traps T lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs), eculizumab, and basiliximab. The future investigations in IIMs will depend on well-designed controlled clinical trials using validated consensus core set measures and improvements in myositis classification schemes based on serologic and histopathologic features.

This review details and updates the pathogenesis and emerging importance of myositis-specific antibodies in the development of IIMs. An increase in the understanding of how these myositis-specific antibodies play a role in IIMs has led to the further categorization of IIMs from the traditional polymyositis versus dermatomyositis, to additional subcategories of IIMs such as necrotizing autoimmune myositis (NAM). The diagnosis of IIMs, including manual muscle testing, laboratory studies, and non-invasive imaging have become important in classifying IIM subtypes and for identifying disease severity. Treatment has evolved from an era where glucocorticoid therapy was the only option to a time now that includes traditional steroid-sparing agents along with immunoglobulin therapy and biologics, such as rituximab. PMID:28524083\n\nA Comprehensive Overview on Myositis-Specific Antibodies: New and Old Biomarkers in Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSatoh, Minoru; Tanaka, Shin; Ceribelli, Angela; Calise, S. John; Chan, Edward K. L.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAutoantibodies specific for idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs)) are clinically useful biomarkers to help the diagnosis of polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM). Many of these are also associated with a unique clinical subset of PM/DM, making them useful in predicting and monitoring certain clinical manifestations. Classic MSAs known for over 30 years include antibodies to Jo-1 (histidyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase) and other aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS), anti-Mi-2, and anti-signal recognition particle (SRP). Anti-Jo-1 is the first autoantibodies to ARS detected in 15â25 % of patients. In addition to anti-Jo-1, antibodies to seven other aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) have been reported with prevalence, usually 1â5 % or lower. Patients with any antiARS antibodies are associated with anti-synthetase syndrome characterized by myositis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), arthritis, Raynaudâs phenomenon, and others. Several recent studies suggested heterogeneity in clinical features among different anti-ARS antibody-positive patients and anti-ARS may also be found in idiopathic ILD without myositis. Anti-Mi-2 is a classic marker for DM and associated with good response to steroid treatment and good prognosis. Anti-SRP is specific for PM and associated with treatment-resistant myopathy histologically characterized as necrotizing myopathy. In addition to classic MSAs, several new autoantibodies with strong clinical significance have been described in DM. Antibodies to transcription intermediary factor 1Î³/Î± (TIF1Î³/Î±, p155/140) are frequently found in DM associated with malignancy while anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; CADM140) are associated with clinically amyopathic DM (CADM) complicated by rapidly progressive ILD. Also, anti-MJ/nuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP-2) and anti-small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1) activating enzyme (SAE) are recognized as new DM-specific autoantibodies.

Homogeneous groups present with similar symptoms. The response to therapy and prognosis could be facilitated by myositis-specific autoantibodies, and in this way, give rise to immunoserological classification. The myositis-specific autoantibodies are directed against specific proteins found in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of the cells. To date, literature suggests the rarity of the co-existence of two myositis-specific autoantibodies. In this study the authors highlight rare associations of myositis-specific autoantibodies. Three hundred and thirty-seven Hungarian patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis were studied. Their clinical findings were noted retrospectively. Specific blood tests identified six patients with the rare co-existence of myositis-specific autoantibodies, anti-Jo-1 and anti-SRP, anti-Jo-1 and anti-Mi-2, anti-Mi-2 and anti-PL-12, anti-Mi-2 and anti-SRP, and anti-SRP and anti-PL-7, respectively. This case review aims to identify the clinical importance of these rare associations and their place within the immunoserological classification.\n\nLocalized scleroderma and regional inflammatory myopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nZivkoviÄ, SaÅ¡a A; Freiberg, William; Lacomis, David; Domsic, Robyn T; Medsger, Thomas A\n\n2014-05-01\n\nInflammatory myopathy is rare in localized scleroderma. We report 2 new cases of regional inflammatory myopathy associated with localized scleroderma and review 10 reported cases of localized scleroderma associated with an inflammatory myopathy with regional muscle involvement, more often in the upper extremities. Serum creatine kinase was mildly elevated or normal. Histopathology often showed perimysial inflammation and plasma cell infiltration. These cases demonstrate that inflammatory myopathy should be considered in patients with localized scleroderma and regional muscle weakness, pain or atrophy. Muscle biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of myositis, which if identified, will require anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive therapy.

JIIM broadly includes three major clinicopathologic groups: juvenile dermatomyositis, juvenile polymyositis, and overlap myositis. A growing spectrum of clinicopathologic groups and serologic phenotypes defined by the presence of myositis-specific or myositis-associated autoantibodies are now recognized, each with differing demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and prognoses. With the first multi-center collaborative studies and controlled trials using standardized preliminarily validated outcome measures, the therapy of juvenile myositis has advanced. Although daily oral corticosteroids remain the backbone of treatment, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are almost always used as adjunctive therapy. Methotrexate is the conventional DMARD for the initial therapy, either alone or combined with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin for patients with moderate to severe disease. Cyclosporine may be added to these or serve as an alternative to methotrexate. Other drugs and biologic therapies, including mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and infliximab, might benefit selected patients with recalcitrant disease, unacceptable steroid toxicity, or patients with risk factors for poor prognosis. The treatment of cutaneous disease, calcinosis, and the role for rehabilitation are also discussed.

The major clinical and autoantibody phenotypes in children have many features similar to those in adults, and each has distinct demographic and clinical features and associated outcomes. The most common myositis autoantibodies in JIIM patients are anti-p155/140, anti-MJ, and anti-MDA5. Higher mortality has been associated with overlap myositis as well as with the presence of anti-synthetase and anti-MDA5 autoantibodies; a chronic illness course and lipodystrophy have been associated with anti-p155/140 autoantibodies; and calcinosis has been associated with anti-MJ autoantibodies. Histologic abnormalities of JIIMs detectable on muscle biopsy have also been correlated with myositis-specific autoantibodies; for example, patients with anti-MDA5 show low levels of inflammatory infiltrate and muscle damage on biopsy. The first genome-wide association study of adult and juvenile dermatomyositis revealed three novel genetic associations, BLK, PLCL1, and CCL21, and confirmed that the human leukocyte antigen region is the primary risk region for juvenile dermatomyositis. Here we review the well-established pathogenic processes in JIIMs, including the type 1 interferon and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. Several novel JIIM-associated inflammatory mediators, such as the innate immune system proteins, myeloid-related peptide 8/14, galectin 9, and eotaxin, have emerged as promising biomarkers of disease. Advances in our understanding of the phenotypes and pathophysiology of the JIIMs are leading to better tools to help clinicians stratify and treat these heterogeneous disorders.

Nailfold video microscopy (x300 magnification) was performed on 24 patients with IIM and 35 healthy controls. Capillary density and dimensions (total width and apical width) were quantified. Patients were clinically assessed and disease activity recorded using the Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool. Disease severity and physical function were assessed using the myositis damage index and Stanford HAQ, respectively. Findings were analysed using linear and logistic regression, adjusted for age and sex. In a subgroup of 16 patients with IIM and 27 controls, the process was repeated 6-12 months later and the results were analysed using Student's t-test. Capillary density was lower and dimensions were higher in patients with IIM compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001 for all). Anti-Jo-1 antibody was associated with reduced capillary density. In the longitudinal cohort, the mean change in capillary density was -1.4 in patients vs -0.4 in controls (P = 0.07). Mean change in capillary dimensions did not differ between patients and controls, but some patients demonstrated pronounced changes in capillary morphology over time. Reduced capillary density and increased dimensions in patients with IIM can be quantified using nailfold capillaroscopy, suggesting that nailfold capillaroscopy may be useful as an outcome measure of microvascular disease in studies of IIM.\n\nThe role of magnetic resonance imaging techniques in evaluation and management of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.\n\nPubMed\n\nDay, Jessica; Patel, Sandy; Limaye, Vidya\n\n2017-04-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool in the evaluation of neuromuscular disorders. MRI accurately demonstrates muscle oedema, atrophy, subcutaneous pathology and fatty infiltration and also highlights the distribution of muscle involvement. This review examines the role of MRI in evaluation of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), a heterogeneous group of autoimmune conditions characterised by muscle inflammation and a variety of extra-muscular manifestations. MRI has a clear role in aiding diagnosis of these conditions, guiding muscle biopsy, differentiating subtypes of IIM using a pattern-based approach, and monitoring disease activity in a longitudinal fashion. Whole body MRI is an emerging technique that offers several advantages over regional MRI, but is not currently widely available. We will also consider newer MRI techniques which provide detailed information regarding the metabolism, function and structure of muscle, although their use is restricted to research purposes at present.

Recently, European Neuromuscular Center (ENMC) formulated criteria to identify subgroups of IIMs. To compare the two diagnostic criteria in adult IIMs. This was a retrospective review of case records of histologically confirmed IIMs in adults between January 2014 and May 2015. Both the Bohan and Peter, and ENMC 2004 criteria were applied in the same group of patients to subgroup the IIMs. Muscle biopsy was evaluated in all the four domains: muscle fiber, inflammatory, connective tissue, and vascular, with the basic panel of histological stains. Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) was diagnosed using ENMC IBM diagnostic research criteria 2011. During the study period, 69 patients fulfilled the ENMC criteria for IIMs including 16 patients with s-IBM. The subgrouping as per the ENMC criteria (53) was: dermatomyositis (DM) in 30; polymyositis (PM) in 2; immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) in 9; and nonspecific myositis (NM) in 12 patients, whereas subgrouping by the Bohan and Peter criteria was DM in 9 and PM with and without connective tissue disease (CTD) in 26 patients only. There was underdiagnosis of DM, as perifascicular atrophy is not recognized as a diagnostic histological feature, and overdiagnosis of PM with and without CTD due to poor characterization of histological features in PM by the Bohan and Peter criteria. Systematic evaluation of muscle biopsy according to the ENMC criteria with basic panel of histochemical stains improved the diagnostic yield of IIM significantly when compared to the Bohan and Peter criteria.\n\nMagnetic resonance measurement of muscle T2, fat-corrected T2 and fat fraction in the assessment of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYao, Lawrence; Yip, Adrienne L.; Shrader, Joseph A.; Mesdaghinia, Sepehr; Volochayev, Rita; Jansen, Anna V.; Miller, Frederick W.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective. This study examines the utility of MRI, including T2 maps and T2 maps corrected for muscle fat content, in evaluating patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Methods. A total of 44 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, 18 of whom were evaluated after treatment with rituximab, underwent MRI of the thighs and detailed clinical assessment. T2, fat fraction (FF) and fat corrected T2 (fc-T2) maps were generated from standardized MRI scans, and compared with semi-quantitative scoring of short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1-weighted sequences, as well as various myositis disease metrics, including the Physician Global Activity, the modified Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale and the muscle domain of the Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool-muscle (MDAAT-muscle). Results. Mean T2 and mean fc-T2 correlated similarly with STIR scores (Spearman rs = 0.64 and 0.64, P < 0.01), while mean FF correlated with T1 damage scores (rs = 0.69, P < 0.001). Baseline T2, fc-T2 and STIR scores correlated significantly with the Physician Global Activity, modified Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale and MDAAT-muscle (rs range = 0.41â0.74, P < 0.01). The response of MRI measures to rituximab was variable, and did not significantly agree with a standardized clinical definition of improvement. Standardized response means for the MRI measures were similar. Conclusion. Muscle T2, fc-T2 and FF measurements exhibit content validity with reference to semi-quantitative scoring of STIR and T1 MRI, and also exhibit construct validity with reference to several myositis activity and damage measures. T2 was as responsive as fc-T2 and STIR scoring, although progression of muscle damage was negligible during the study.

The paediatric idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a group of rare chronic inflammatory disorders of childhood, affecting muscle, skin and other organs. There is a severe lack of evidence base for current treatment protocols in juvenile myositis. The rarity of these conditions means that multicentre collaboration is vital to facilitate studies of pathogenesis, treatment and disease outcomes. We have established a national registry and repository for childhood IIM, which aims to improve knowledge, facilitate research and clinical trials, and ultimately to improve outcomes for these patients. Methods. A UK-wide network of centres and research group was established to contribute to the study. Standardized patient assessment, data collection forms and sample protocols were agreed. The Biobank includes collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum, genomic DNA and biopsy material. An independent steering committee was established to oversee the use of data/samples. Centre training was provided for patient assessment, data collection and entry. Results. Ten years after inception, the study has recruited 285 children, of which 258 have JDM or juvenile PM; 86% of the cases have contributed the biological samples. Serial sampling linked directly to the clinical database makes this a highly valuable resource. The study has been a platform for 20 sub-studies and attracted considerable funding support. Assessment of children with myositis in contributing centres has changed through participation in this study. Conclusions. This establishment of a multicentre registry and Biobank has facilitated research and contributed to progress in the management of a complex group of rare muscloskeletal conditions.

In this paper, we outline key advances in diagnosis and histopathology, including the more recent identification of antibodies associated with immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Ongoing longitudinal observational cohorts allow further classification of these patients with IIM, their predicted clinical course and response to specific therapies. Registries have been developed worldwide for this purpose. A challenging aspect in IIM, a multisystem disease with multiple clinical subtypes, has been defining disease status and clinically relevant improvement. Tools for assessing activity and damage are now recognised to be important in determining disease activity and guiding therapeutic decision-making. The International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies (IMACS) group has developed such tools for use in research and clinical settings. There is limited evidence for specific treatment strategies in IIM. With significant development in the understanding of IIM and improved classification, longitudinal observational cohorts and trials using validated outcome measures are necessary, to provide important information for evidence-based care in the clinical setting.

In a retrospective study, patients attending a private practice rheumatology clinic in Lagos and fulfilling the Bohan and Peter's criteria for polymyositis and dermatomyositis were examined and common causes of proximal muscle weakness were excluded. Haematological, biochemical, serological and electromyographic studies were carried out. Patients were treated with standard drugs. Fourteen patients (F-13, M-1) were diagnosed with Polymyositis (PM) and Dermatomyositis (DM). Seven had probable PM, 4 with possible PM and 3 with probable DM. Mean age was 35 years (range 22-54) ESR was markedly raised mean 105/min (26-150). Muscle and liver enzymes were raised in all patients. Creatinine kinase median 1134 (29-10,166); lactic dehydrogenase median 477 (209-787); ALT 43 (19-233); AST 136 (25-725). Serology for ANF was positive in eight patients; Anti Jo1 in 1 out of 9 while Anti Mi2 was negative in all tested. EMG in 6 tested showed myopathic pattern. Inflammatory myopathies are rare among Nigerians but a heightened awareness is needed for diagnosis and management.\n\nThe Cutaneous Assessment Tool (CAT): Development and Reliability in Juvenile Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuber, Adam M.; Dugan, Elizabeth M.; Lachenbruch, Peter A.; Feldman, Brian M.; Perez, Maria D.; Zemel, Lawrence S.; Lindsley, Carol B.; Rennebohm, Robert M.; Wallace, Carol A.; Passo, Murray H.; Reed, Ann M.; Bowyer, Suzanne L.; Ballinger, Susan H.; Miller, Frederick W.; Rider, Lisa G.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nObjectives Clinical care and therapeutic trials in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) require accurate and consistent assessment of cutaneous involvement. The Cutaneous Assessment Tool (CAT) was designed to measure skin activity and damage in IIM. We describe the development and inter-rater reliability of the CAT, and the frequency of lesions endorsed in a large population of juvenile IIM patients. Methods The CAT includes 10 activity, 4 damage and 7 combined lesions. Thirty-two photographic slides depicting IIM skin lesions were assessed by 11 raters. One hundred and twenty three children were assessed by 11 pediatric rheumatologists at ten centers. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using simple agreements and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Results Simple agreements in recognizing lesions as present or absent were generally high (0.5 â 1.0). ICC's for CAT lesions were moderate (0.4 â 0.75) in both slides and real patients. ICC's for the CAT activity and damage scores were 0.71 and 0.81, respectively. CAT activity scores ranged from 0 â 44 (median 7, potential range 0 â 96) and CAT damage scores ranged from 0 â 13 (median 1, potential range 0 â 22). The most common cutaneous lesions endorsed were periungual capillary loop changes (63%), Gottron's papules/sign (53%), heliotrope rash (49%) and malar/facial erythema (49%). Conclusions Total CAT activity and damage scores have moderate to good reliability. Assessors generally agree on the presence of a variety of cutaneous lesions. The CAT is a promising, semi-quantitative tool to comprehensively assess skin disease activity and damage in IIM.

In IIM, ER stress is an important pathogenic process, but how it causes muscle dysfunction is unknown. We discuss relevant pathways modified in response to ER stress in IIM: reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and muscle cytokine (myokine) generation. First, ER stress pathway activation can induce changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics and ROS production. ROS can oxidize cellular components, causing muscle contractile dysfunction and energy deficits. Novel compounds targeting ROS generation and/or mitochondrial dysfunction can improve muscle function in several myopathologies. Second, recent research has demonstrated that skeletal muscle produces multiple myokines. It is suggested that these play a role in causing muscle weakness. Myokines are capable of immune cell recruitment, thus contributing to perturbed muscle function. A characterization of myokines in IIM would clarify their pathogenic role, and so identify new therapeutic targets. ER stress pathway activation is clearly of etiological relevance in IIM. Research to better understand mechanisms of weakness downstream of ER stress is now required, and which may discover new therapeutic targets for nonimmune cell-mediated weakness.\n\nInflammatory myopathy as the initial presentation of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrÃ­guez-PÃ©rez, Noelia; RodrÃ­guez-Navedo, Yerania; Font, Yvonne M; VilÃ¡, Luis M\n\n2013-06-03\n\nCryoglobulinaemic vasculitis is characterised by immunoglobulin deposition at low temperatures.

Clinicoserologic classifications do not take muscle histology into account to distinguish the subsets of IIM. Our objective was to determine the pathologic features of each serologic subset of IIM and to correlate muscle biopsy results with the clinicoserologic classification defined by Troyanov et al, and with the final diagnoses. We retrospectively studied a cohort of 178 patients with clinicopathologic features suggestive of IIM with the exclusion of inclusion body myositis. At the end of follow-up, 156 of 178 cases were still categorized as IIM: pure dermatomyositis, n = 44; pure polymyositis, n = 14; overlap myositis, n = 68; necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, n = 8; cancer-associated myositis, n = 18; and unclassified IIM, n = 4. The diagnosis of IIM was ruled out in the 22 remaining cases. Pathologic dermatomyositis was the most frequent histologic picture in all serologic subsets of IIM, with the exception of patients with anti-Ku or anti-SRP autoantibodies, suggesting that it supports the histologic diagnosis of pure dermatomyositis, but also myositis of connective tissue diseases and cancer-associated myositis. Unspecified myositis was the second most frequent histologic pattern. It frequently correlated with overlap myositis, especially with anti-Ku or anti-PM-Scl autoantibodies. Pathologic polymyositis was rare and more frequently correlated with myositis mimickers than true polymyositis. The current study shows that clinicoserologic and pathologic data are complementary and must be taken into account when classifying patients with IIM patients. We propose guidelines for diagnosis according to both clinicoserologic and pathologic classifications, to be used in clinical practice.

Methods An international, multidisciplinary group of myositis experts produced a set of 93 potentially relevant variables to be tested for inclusion in the criteria. Rheumatology, dermatology, neurology and paediatric clinics worldwide collected data on 976 IIM cases (74% adults, 26% children) and 624 non-IIM comparator cases with mimicking conditions (82% adults, 18% children). The participating clinicians classified each case as IIM or non-IIM. Generally, the classification of any given patient was based on few variables, leaving remaining variables unmeasured. We investigated the strength of the association between all variables and between these and the disease status as determined by the physician. We considered three approaches: (1) a probability-score approach, (2) a sum-of-items approach criteria and (3) a classification-tree approach. Results The approaches yielded several candidate models that were scrutinised with respect to statistical performance and clinical relevance. The probability-score approach showed superior statistical performance and clinical practicability and was therefore preferred over the others. We developed a classification tree for subclassification of patients with IIM. A calculator for electronic devices, such as computers and smartphones, facilitates the use of the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria. Conclusions The new EULAR/ACR classification criteria provide a patientâs probability of having IIM for use in clinical and research settings. The probability is based on a score obtained by summing the weights associated with a set of criteria items.

This hinders clinicians and researchers in choosing the appropriate fitness- or muscle strength-related outcome measures for these patients. Through a Delphi survey, we aimed to identify a candidate core-set of fitness and strength tests for children and adults with IIM. METHODS Fifteen experts participated in a Delphi survey that consisted of five stages to achieve a consensus. Using an extensive search of published literature and through the expertise of the experts, a candidate core-set based on expert opinion and clinimetric properties was developed. Members of the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) were invited to review this candidate core-set during the final stage, which led to a final candidate core-set. RESULTS A core-set of fitness- and strength-related outcome measures was identified for children and adults with IIM. For both children and adults, different tests were identified and selected for maximal aerobic fitness, submaximal aerobic fitness, anaerobic fitness, muscle strength tests and muscle function tests. CONCLUSIONS The core-set of fitness and strength-related outcome measures provided by this expert consensus process will assist practitioners and researchers in deciding which tests to use in IIM patients. This will improve the uniformity of fitness and strength tests across studies, thereby facilitating the comparison of study results and therapeutic exercise program outcomes among patients with IIM.

Autoimmunity can be defined as a loss in self-tolerance and attack of autoantigens by the immune system. Self-tolerance is achieved by a group of immune mechanisms occurring in central and periphal lymphoid organs and tissues, called immune checkpoints, that work in synergy to protect the body from harmful immune reactions. Autoimmune disorders appear when immune checkpoints fail. In this review, the different immune checkpoint failures are discussed in DM, PM, IBM and IMNM. Exploring research contribution in each of these immune checkpoints might help to highlight research perspectives in the field and obtain a more complete picture of IM disease pathology.

Positive MHC-I staining is nonspecific but is widely used as a marker for inflammatory myopathy, whilst the role of MHC-II staining is not clearly defined. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of MHC-I and MHC-II immunostaining for the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy in a large group of biopsies from a single reference laboratory. Positive staining for MHC-I was found to have a high sensitivity in biopsies from patients with inflammatory myopathy but a very low specificity, as it was also common in other non-inflammatory myopathies and neurogenic disorders. On the other hand, MHC-II positivity had a much higher specificity in all major subgroups of inflammatory myopathy, especially inclusion body myositis. The findings indicate that the combination of MHC-I and MHC-II staining results in a higher degree of specificity for the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy and that in biopsies with inflammation, positive MHC-II staining strongly supports the diagnosis of an immune-mediated myopathy. We recommend that immunohistochemical staining for both MHC-I and MHC-II should be included routinely in the diagnostic evaluation of muscle biopsies from patients with suspected inflammatory myopathy. However, as the sensitivity and interpretation of MHC staining may depend on the technique used, further studies are needed to compare procedures in different centres and develop standardised protocols.

At OMERACT 11, a literature review of PROM used in the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) and other neuromuscular conditions was presented. The group examined in more detail 2 PROM more extensively evaluated in patients with IIM, the Myositis Activities Profile, and the McMaster-Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire, through the OMERACT filter of truth, discrimination, and feasibility. Preliminary results from a qualitative study of patients with myositis regarding their symptoms were discussed that emphasized the range of symptoms experienced: pain, physical tightness/stiffness, fatigue, disease effect on emotional life and relationships, and treatment-related side effects. Following discussion of these results and following additional discussions since OMERACT 11, a research agenda was developed. The next step in evaluating PROM in IIM will require additional focus groups with a spectrum of patients with different myositis disease phenotypes and manifestations across a range of disease activity, and from multiple international settings. The group will initially focus on dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults. Qualitative analysis will facilitate the identification of commonalities and divergent patient-relevant aspects of disease, insights that are critical given the heterogeneous manifestations of these diseases. Based on these qualitative studies, existing myositis PROM can be examined to more thoroughly assess content validity, and will be important to identify gaps in domain measurement that will be required to develop a preliminary core set of patient-relevant domains for IIM.\n\nAdvances in serological diagnostics of inflammatory myopathies.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenveniste, Olivier; Stenzel, Werner; Allenbach, Yves\n\n2016-10-01\n\nInflammatory myopathies are rare diseases. Their diagnosis criteria are historically based on their clinical phenotype (topography of the muscle weakness, presence of skin lesions and/or of extra-skin/muscle signs) and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates on muscle biopsy. However, the recent discovery of different myositis-specific antibodies (MSA) or myositis-associated antibodies (MAA) permitted to revisit these old classifications. This review covers recent findings in clinical and pathological phenotypes regarding prognosis, associated cancer and response to the treatment based on MSA/MAA categorization. Since the mid-1970s, about 20 MSA or MAA were discovered year after year (by immunoprecipitation). Now commercial kits (mainly dot line assays) permit their detection routinely which is clearly a help for the diagnosis but also give some key indications on clinical features, risk of associated cancers and response to the treatments. Overlap myositis is associated with antisynthetase antibodies (Abs) or those associated with sclerodermia (anti-RNP, Ku and PM-ScL). Dermatomyositis is associated with anti-Mi2, small ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme (SAE), nuclear matrix protein-2 (NXP2), TIF-1Î³ or melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) Abs. Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies are associated with anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) Abs. One third of inclusion body myositis' patients also presented anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) Abs. The risk of associated cancers is elevated with anti-TIF-1Î³, NXP2 or HMGCR Abs.\n\nNovel Assessment of Interstitial Lung Disease Using the \"Computer-Aided Lung Informatics for Pathology Evaluation and Rating\" (CALIPER) Software System in Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies.\n\nPubMed\n\nUngprasert, Patompong; Wilton, Katelynn M; Ernste, Floranne C; Kalra, Sanjay; Crowson, Cynthia S; Rajagopalan, Srinivasan; Bartholmai, Brian J\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo evaluate the correlation between measurements from quantitative thoracic high-resolution CT (HRCT) analysis with \"Computer-Aided Lung Informatics for Pathology Evaluation and Rating\" (CALIPER) software and measurements from pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD). A cohort of patients with IIM-associated ILD seen at Mayo Clinic was identified from medical record review. Retrospective analysis of HRCT data and PFTs at baseline and 1Â year was performed. The abnormalities in HRCT were quantified using CALIPER software. A total of 110 patients were identified. At baseline, total interstitial abnormalities as measured by CALIPER, both by absolute volume and by percentage of total lung volume, had a significant negative correlation with diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), total lung capacity (TLC), and oxygen saturation. Analysis by subtype of interstitial abnormality revealed significant negative correlations between ground glass opacities (GGO) and reticular density (RD) with DLCO and TLC. At one year, changes of total interstitial abnormalities compared with baseline had a significant negative correlation with changes of TLC and oxygen saturation. A negative correlation between changes of total interstitial abnormalities and DLCO was also observed, but it was not statistically significant. Analysis by subtype of interstitial abnormality revealed negative correlations between changes of GGO and RD and changes of DLCO, TLC, and oxygen saturation, but most of the correlations did not achieve statistical significance. CALIPER measurements correlate well with functional measurements in patients with IIM-associated ILD.\n\nA distinctive type of infantile inflammatory myopathy with abnormal myonuclei.\n\nPubMed\n\nSripathi, N; Karpati, G; Carpenter, S\n\n1996-03-01\n\nFour infants developed progressive muscle weakness after a normal initial postnatal development. All patients had a moderate elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) activity. Muscle biopsies revealed, in addition to myopathic features, endomysial and perivascular inflammation. Electron microscopy disclosed prominent myonuclear abnormalities. Corticosteroids in 3 patients were moderately beneficial. This appears to be a clinicopathologically distinct form of inflammatory myopathy of infants.\n\nHigher proportion of fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibres in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies - evident in chronic but not in untreated newly diagnosed patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoell, I; Helmers, S B; Dastmalchi, M; Alexanderson, H; Munters, L A; Nennesmo, I; Lindroos, E; Borg, K; Lundberg, I E; EsbjÃ¶rnsson, M\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPolymyositis and dermatomyositis are idiopathic, inflammatory myopathies characterized by proximal muscle fatigue. Conventional immunosuppressive treatment gives a variable response. Biopsies from chronic patients display a low proportion type I and a high proportion of type II muscle fibres. This raised a suspicion that the low proportion of type I fibres might play a role in the muscle fatigue. To investigate whether the muscle fibre attributes evident in chronic myositis are characteristic for the polymyositis and dermatomyosistis diseases themselves. Muscle biopsies were obtained from thigh muscle from untreated patients (n = 18), treated responders (n = 14) and non-responders (n = 6) and from healthy controls (n = 11), respectively. For clinical evaluations, creatine kinase, functional index of myositis and cumulative dose of cortisone were established. â Chronic patients had a lower proportion of type I fibres and a higher proportion of type II fibres compared to untreated myositis patients and healthy controls. Fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) did not differ between patients and healthy individuals but all women had a 20% smaller type II fibre CSA compared to men. Untreated polymyositis and dermatomyositis patients and healthy controls have a different fibre type composition than chronic polymyositis and dermatomyositis patients. Fibre CSA did not differ between healthy controls or any of the patient groups. A low proportion of oxidative muscle fibres can therefore be excluded as a contributing factor causing muscle fatigue at disease onset and the gender difference should be taken into consideration when evaluating fibre CSA in myositis.

Candidate variables were assembled from published criteria and expert opinion using consensus methodology. Data were collected from 47 rheumatology, dermatology, neurology and paediatric clinics worldwide. Several statistical methods were used to derive the classification criteria. Based on data from 976 IIM patients (74% adults; 26% children) and 624 non-IIM patients with mimicking conditions (82% adults; 18% children), new criteria were derived. Each item is assigned a weighted score. The total score corresponds to a probability of having IIM. Subclassification is performed using a classification tree. A probability cut-off of 55%, corresponding to a score of 5.5 (6.7 with muscle biopsy) 'probable IIM', had best sensitivity/specificity (87%/82% without biopsies, 93%/88% with biopsies) and is recommended as a minimum to classify a patient as having IIM. A probability of â¥90%, corresponding to a score of â¥7.5 (â¥8.7 with muscle biopsy), corresponds to 'definite IIM'. A probability of <50%, corresponding to a score of <5.3 (<6.5 with muscle biopsy), rules out IIM, leaving a probability of â¥50âto <55% as 'possible IIM'. The European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria for IIM have been endorsed by international rheumatology, dermatology, neurology and paediatric groups. They employ easily accessible and operationally defined elements, and have been partially validated. They allow classification of 'definite', 'probable' and 'possible' IIM, in addition to the major subgroups of IIM, including juvenile IIM. They generally perform better than existing criteria.

We describe a 46-year-old man with psoriasis vulgaris who presented with idiopathic upper and lower limb weakness and was eventually diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsy findings were compatible with mild inflammatory myopathy. He died of cardiopulmonary arrest, and an autopsy was performed. The autopsy revealed amyloid plaques immunopositive for AA (but not AL or transthyretin) in the perimysial, perivascular, and endomysial regions of the iliopsoas muscle. The final diagnosis was systemic AA amyloidosis with muscle amyloid angiopathy, possibly induced by psoriasis vulgaris. This is an extremely rare autopsy case of myopathy in a patient with systemic AA amyloidosis. The reason for the unusually large amount of amyloid deposition in muscle blood vessel walls remains unclear.

Myopathies in systemic disease results from several different disease processes including endocrine, inflammatory, paraneoplastic, infectious, drug- and toxin-induced, critical illness myopathy, metabolic, and myopathies with other systemic disorders. Patients with systemic myopathies often present acutely or sub acutely. On the other hand, familial myopathies or dystrophies generally present in a chronic fashion with exceptions of metabolic myopathies where symptoms on occasion can be precipitated acutely. Most of the inflammatory myopathies can have a chance association with malignant lesions; the incidence appears to be specifically increased only in patients with dermatomyositis. In dealing with myopathies associated with systemic illnesses, the focus will be on the acquired causes. Management is beyond the scope of this chapter. Prognosis is based upon the underlying cause and, most of the time, carries a good prognosis. In order to approach a patient with suspected myopathy from systemic disease, a stepwise approach is utilized.\n\nNew insights into the benefits of exercise for muscle health in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myositis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlemo Munters, Li; Alexanderson, Helene; Crofford, Leslie J; Lundberg, Ingrid E\n\n2014-07-01\n\nWith recommended treatment, a majority with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) develop muscle impairment and poor health. Beneficial effects of exercise have been reported on muscle performance, aerobic capacity and health in chronic polymyositis and dermatomyositis and to some extent in active disease and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Importantly, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that improved health and decreased clinical disease activity could be mediated through increased aerobic capacity. Recently, reports seeking mechanisms underlying effects of exercise in skeletal muscle indicate increased aerobic capacity (i.e. increased mitochondrial capacity and capillary density, reduced lactate levels), activation of genes in aerobic phenotype and muscle growth programs, and down regulation in genes related to inflammation. Altogether, exercise contributes to both systemic and within-muscle adaptations demonstrating that exercise is fundamental to improve muscle performance and health in IIM. There is a need for RCTs to study effects of exercise in active disease and IBM.\n\nIncidence and prevalence of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies among commercially insured, Medicare supplemental insured, and Medicaid enrolled populations: an administrative claims analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a rare group of autoimmune syndromes characterized by chronic muscle inflammation and muscle weakness with no known cause. Little is known about their incidence and prevalence. This study reports the incidence and prevalence of IIMs among commercially insured and Medicare and Medicaid enrolled populations in the US. Methods We retrospectively examined medical claims with an IIM diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 710.3 [dermatomyositis (DM)], 710.4 [polymyositis (PM)], 728.81[interstitial myositis]) in the MarketScanÂ® databases to identify age- and gender-adjusted annual IIM incidence and prevalence for 2004â2008. Sensitivity analysis was performed for evidence of a specialist visit (rheumatologist/ neurologist/dermatologist), systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressant use, or muscle biopsy. Results We identified 2,990 incident patients between 2004 and 2008 (67% female, 17% Medicaid enrollees, 27% aged â¥65âyears). Overall adjusted IIM incidence for 2004â2008 for commercial and Medicare supplemental groups combined were 4.27 cases (95% CI, 4.09-4.44) and for Medicaid, 5.23 (95% CI 4.74-5.72) per 100,000 person-years (py). Disease sub-type incidence rates per 100,000-py were 1.52 (95% CI 1.42-1.63) and 1.70 (1.42-1.97) for DM, 2.46 (2.33-2.59) and 3.53 (3.13-3.94) for PM, and 0.73 (0.66-0.81) and 0.78 (0.58-0.97) for interstitial myositis for the commercial/Medicare and Medicaid cohorts respectively. Annual incidence fluctuated over time with the base MarketScan populations. There were 7,155 prevalent patients, with annual prevalence ranging from 20.62 to 25.32 per 100,000 for commercial/Medicare (83% of prevalent cases) and from 15.35 to 32.74 for Medicaid. Conclusions We found higher IIM incidence than historically reported. Employer turnover, miscoding and misdiagnosing, care seeking behavior, and fluctuations in database membership over time can influence the results. Further studies are needed to confirm the\n\nValidation and clinical significance of the Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale for assessment of muscle function in the juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuber, Adam M; Feldman, Brian M; Rennebohm, Robert M; Hicks, Jeanne E; Lindsley, Carol B; Perez, Maria D; Zemel, Lawrence S; Wallace, Carol A; Ballinger, Susan H; Passo, Murray H; Reed, Ann M; Summers, Ronald M; White, Patience H; Katona, Ildy M; Miller, Frederick W; Lachenbruch, Peter A; Rider, Lisa G\n\n2004-05-01\n\nTo examine the measurement characteristics of the Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) in children with juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (juvenile IIM), and to obtain preliminary data on the clinical significance of CMAS scores. One hundred eight children with juvenile IIM were evaluated on 2 occasions, 7-9 months apart, using various measures of physical function, strength, and disease activity. Interrater reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness of the CMAS were examined. The minimum clinically important difference (MID) and CMAS scores corresponding to various degrees of physical disability were estimated. The intraclass correlation coefficient for 26 patients assessed by 2 examiners was 0.89, indicating very good interrater reliability. The CMAS score correlated highly with the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ) score and with findings on manual muscle testing (MMT) (r(s) = -0.73 and 0.73, respectively) and moderately with physician-assessed global disease activity and skin activity, parent-assessed global disease severity, and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (r(s) = -0.44 to -0.61), thereby demonstrating good construct validity. The standardized response mean was 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.53, 1.09) in patients with at least 0.8 cm improvement on a 10-cm visual analog scale for physician-assessed global disease activity, indicating strong responsiveness. In bivariate regression models predicting physician-assessed global disease activity, MMT remained significant in models containing the CMAS (P = 0.03) while the C-HAQ did not (P = 0.4). Estimates of the MID ranged from 1.5 to 3.0 points on a 0-52-point scale. CMAS scores corresponding to no, mild, mild-to-moderate, and moderate physical disability, respectively, were 48, 45, 39, and 30. The CMAS exhibits good reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness, and is therefore a valid instrument for the assessment of physical function, muscle strength, and\n\nIdiopathic orbital inflammatory disease successfully treated with rituximab.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchafranski, Marcelo Derbli\n\n2009-02-01\n\nWe report a case of a 66-year-old Caucasian female with a diagnosis of idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease (OID) refractory to azathioprine therapy. The coexistence of diabetes mellitus represented a relative contraindication to chronic prednisone use. After two infusions of rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20+ antibody, ophthalmic signs and symptoms remarkably improved. To our knowledge, this is the first case of idiopathic OID successfully treated with rituximab.\n\nInclusion Body Myositis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDimachkie, Mazen M.; Barohn, Richard J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a group of rare disorders that share many similarities. These include dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), necrotizing myopathy (NM), and sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM). Inclusion body myositis is the most common idiopathic inflammatory myopathy after age 50 and it presents with chronic proximal leg and distal arm asymmetric mucle weakness. Despite similarities with PM, it is likely that IBM is primarily a degenerative disorder rather than an inflammatory muscle disease. Inclusion body myositis is associated with a modest degree of creatine kinase (CK) elevation and an abnormal electromyogram demonstrating an irritative myopathy with some chronicity. The muscle histopathology demonstrates inflammatory exudates surrounding and invading nonnecrotic muscle fibers often times accompanied by rimmed vacuoles. In this chapter, we review sporadic IBM. We also examine past, essentially negative, clinical trials in IBM and review ongoing clinical trials. For further details on DM, PM, and NM, the reader is referred to the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies chapter.

Few cases of AQM with IIP have been reported in the literature. The HP progressed rapidly in our patient, but the high-dose steroid therapy was effective. The rehabilitative intervention comprised of passive range-of-motion exercise, functional training, and muscle strengthening. After the initial presentation with severe weakness, the AQM gradually improved and the patient regained full physical function in 8 months. The clinical course was almost identical to that of AQM patients with other lung diseases. Though unlikely to influence the improvement of muscle weakness in AQM patients, the lung diseases associated with AQM may require specific consideration in determining suitable rehabilitation programs and observing patients before and after full recovery from dysmobility.\n\nMyositis non-inflammatory mechanisms: An up-dated review.\n\nPubMed\n\nManole, Emilia; Bastian, Alexandra E; Butoianu, Niculina; Goebel, Hans H\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) represent a heterogeneous group of rare muscular diseases, with no clearly known causes. IIM frequently have an incomplete response to treatment due to the difficulty in distinguishing between IIM forms, and due to neglect their non-inflammatory causes. Important data concerning non-immune mechanisms in IIM pathology have been recently accumulated. There is a correlation between inflammatory and non-inflammatory mechanisms, but their involvement in IIM pathogenesis is still unknown. Here we review some of the most important data regarding the non-immune IIM pathology, highlighting possible future therapeutic targets: endoplasmic reticulum stress, ATP metabolism, ROS generation, autophagy, and microRNAs disturbances.\n\nAn epidemiological investigation of an idiopathic myopathy in hunting dogs in New Zealand.\n\nPubMed\n\nHunt, H; Cave, N J; Gartrell, B D; Cogger, N; Petersen, J A; Roe, W D\n\n2018-07-01\n\nTo conduct an epidemiological investigation of an idiopathic myopathy, known as \"Go Slow\" (GSM), which was initially recognised in dogs used for pig hunting. A secondary aim was to describe the hunting activities, diet and health of dogs used for pig hunting in New Zealand. A retrospective cohort study was conducted between June 2014-June 2017. Cases of GSM in dogs were diagnosed by veterinarians using a combination of clinical history, physical examination findings, serum biochemistry and/or skeletal muscle histology. A telephone interview was conducted with the owner or primary veterinarian to provide information regarding the dog's diet and exercise over the 7 days preceding the onset of clinical signs. In August 2015, a separate online survey of owners of dogs used for pig hunting was conducted to characterise the normal hunting activities, diet and health of these dogs. A total of 86 cases of GSM were recruited, of which 58 (67%) were pig hunting dogs, 16 (19%) pet dogs and 12 (14%) working farm dogs. Cases were most commonly reported in the upper North Island, and 65 (76 (95% CI=67-85)%) were from the Northland region. Processed commercial dog food had been fed to 93 (95% CI=88-98)% of affected dogs. Ingestion of raw, frozen or cooked wild pig in the preceding week was reported for 76 (88 (95% CI=82-95)%) dogs with the myopathy. In the survey of owners of healthy pig hunting dogs, 203 eligible responses were received; pig hunting was reported to most commonly occur in Northland (20.2%), Waikato (22.3%) and Bay of Plenty (23.2%) regions. Commercial dog food was fed to 172 (85 (95% CI=80-90)%) of the dogs included in this survey, and 55 (27 (95% CI=20-33)%) had eaten wild pig in the preceding week. The most common reported health problem in pig hunting dogs was traumatic wounds. Cases of GSM were most commonly recognised in dogs used for pig hunting, but also occurred in pet and working farm dogs. The disease was most frequently reported in the upper North\n\nInclusion body myositis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDimachkie, Mazen M; Barohn, Richard J\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are a group of rare disorders that share many similarities.

A retrospective longitudinal study was carried out in 467 consecutive patients with IIM, identified from 12 medical centers. Patients were classified as primary polymyositis, primary dermatomyositis (DM), overlap myositis, cancer-associated myositis (CAM), and juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. A total of 113 deaths occurred (24%) after a median follow-up time of 9.7Â years. In the overall cohort, the 2-, 5-, and 10-year survival probabilities were 91.9, 86.7, and 77%, respectively. Main causes of death were infections and cancer (24% each). Multivariate model revealed that CAM (HRÂ =Â 24.06), OM (HRÂ =Â 12.00), DM (HRÂ =Â 7.26), higher age at diagnosis (HRÂ =Â 1.02), severe infections (HRÂ =Â 3.66), interstitial lung disease (HRÂ =Â 1.61), and baseline elevation of acute phase reactants (HRÂ =Â 3.03) were associated with a worse prognosis, while edema of the hands (HRÂ =Â 0.39), female gender (HRÂ =Â 0.39), and longer disease duration (HRÂ =Â 0.73) were associated with a better prognosis. The standardized mortality ratio was 1.56 (95% CI 1.28-1.87) compared to the Spanish general population. Our findings indicate that IIM has a high long-term mortality, with an excess of mortality compared to the Spanish population. A more aggressive therapy may be required in IIM patients presenting with poor predictive factors.\n\nEvaluation of inflammatory biomarkers associated with oxidative stress and histological assessment of magnetic therapy on experimental myopathy in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nVignola, MarÃ­a BelÃ©n; DÃ¡vila, Soledad; Cremonezzi, David; Simes, Juan C; Palma, JosÃ© A; Campana, Vilma R\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy, also called magnetic therapy, upon inflammatory biomarkers associated with oxidative stress plasma fibrinogen, nitric oxide (NO), L-citrulline, carbonyl groups, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was evaluated through histological assessment, in rats with experimental myopathy. The groups studied were: (A) control (intact rats that received PEMF sham exposures); (B) rats with myopathy and sacrificed 24Â h later; (C) rats with myopathy; (D) rats with myopathy and treated with PEMF; and (E) intact rats treated with PEMF. Groups A, C, D, and E were sacrificed 8 days later. Myopathy was induced by injecting 50Â Î¼l of 1% carrageenan Î» (type IV) once sub-plantar. Treatment was carried out with PEMF emitting equipment with two flat solenoid disks for 8 consecutive days in groups D and E, at 20Â mT and 50Â Hz for 30Â min/day/rat. The biomarkers were determined by spectrophotometry. The muscles (5/8) were stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin and examined by optic microscopy. Quantitative variables were statistically analyzed by the Fisher test, and categorical applying Pearson's Chi Squared test at pÂ <Â 0.05 for all cases. In Groups B and C, the biomarkers were significantly increased compared to A, D, and E groups: fibrinogen (pÂ <Â 0.001); NO, L-citrulline and carbonyl groups (pÂ <Â 0.05); SOD (pÂ <Â 0.01) as well as the percentage of area with inflammatory infiltration (pÂ <Â 0.001). PEMF caused decreased levels of fibrinogen, L-citrulline, NO, SOD, and carbonyl groups and significant muscle recovery in rats with experimental myopathies.\n\nClinical Aspects of Idiopathic Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Review for Pathologists.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Hwajeong; Westerhoff, Maria; Shen, Bo; Liu, Xiuli\n\n2016-05-01\n\n-Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease manifests with different clinical phenotypes showing varying behavior and risk for neoplasia.

Understanding the clinical aspects of the dynamic disease process will enhance the role of pathology in optimizing the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. -To review clinical and surgical aspects of inflammatory bowel disease that are relevant to practicing pathologists. -The literature was reviewed. -Diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease require an integrated evaluation of clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, and pathologic features. Therefore, close interaction between clinicians and pathologists is crucial. Having this team approach improves understanding of the pertinent clinical and surgical aspects of the disease and assists in the recognition of unusual presentation of variants, as well as mimics of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, by pathologists.\n\n[Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease - advancements in surgical treatment].\n\nPubMed\n\nUlrych, J; KrÅ¡ka, Z\n\n2012-10-01\n\nTreatment of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease is constantly developing. Biological therapy has become a standard part of conservative treatment, and gene and cell therapy of these diseases is in preclinical phase. Surgical therapy also offers some progress in the treatment, such as the increasingly preferred laparoscopic approach offering the numerous benefits of minimally invasive surgery or a tendency to perform stapled anastomosis. A retrospective analysis of patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory bowel operated on at the First Department of Surgery, General University Hospital in the years 2007-2011 was performed. Within this period, 179 patients diagnosed with Crohns disease were operated on. 30 patients underwent acute operation and 149 patients were indicated for elective surgery. In the same period, 40 patients with ulcerative colitis were indicated for surgery, of whom 22 patients for acute surgery and 18 for elective surgery. Multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease is crucial and patients should be treated in specialized centres. New possibilities of conservative treatment and progress in surgical therapy mutually correlate, and thus the choice of a correct therapeutic procedure requires specific cooperation between the surgeon and the gastroenterologist.\n\nDense Genotyping of Immune-Related Loci in the Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies Confirms HLA alleles as Strongest Genetic Risk Factor and Suggests Different Genetic Background for Major Clinical Subgroups\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRothwell, Simon; Cooper, Robert G.; Lundberg, Ingrid E.; Miller, Frederick W.; Gregersen, Peter K.; Bowes, John; Vencovsky, Jiri; Danko, Katalin; Limaye, Vidya; Selva-OâCallaghan, Albert; Hanna, Michael G.; Machado, Pedro M.; Pachman, Lauren M.; Reed, Ann M.; Rider, Lisa G.; Cobb, Joanna; Platt, Hazel; Molberg, Ãyvind; Benveniste, Olivier; Mathiesen, Pernille; Radstake, Timothy; Doria, Andrea; De Bleecker, Jan; De Paepe, Boel; Maurer, Britta; Ollier, William E.; Padyukov, Leonid; OâHanlon, Terrance P.; Lee, Annette; Amos, Christopher I.; Gieger, Christian; Meitinger, Thomas; Winkelmann, Juliane; Wedderburn, Lucy R; Chinoy, Hector; Lamb, Janine A\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group of rare autoimmune diseases characterized by muscle weakness and extramuscular manifestations such as skin rashes and interstitial lung disease. We genotyped 2,566 IIM cases of Caucasian descent using the Immunochip; a custom array covering 186 established autoimmune susceptibility loci. The cohort was predominantly comprised of dermatomyositis (DM, n=879), juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM, n=481), polymyositis (PM, n=931) and inclusion body myositis (IBM, n=252) patients collected from 14 countries through the Myositis Genetics Consortium. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and PTPN22 regions reached genome-wide significance (p<5Ã10â8). Nine regions were associated at a significance level of p<2.25Ã10â5, including UBE2L3, CD28 and TRAF6, with evidence of independent effects within STAT4. Analysis of clinical subgroups revealed distinct differences between PM, and DM and JDM. PTPN22 was associated at genome-wide significance with PM, but not DM and JDM, suggesting this effect is driven by PM. Additional suggestive associations including IL18R1 and RGS1 in PM and GSDMB in DM were identified. HLA imputation confirmed that alleles HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-B*08:01 of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (8.1AH) are most strongly associated with IIM, and provides evidence that amino acids within the HLA, such as HLA-DQB1 position 57 in DM, may explain part of the risk in this locus. Associations with alleles outside the 8.1AH reveal differences between PM, DM, and JDM. This work represents the largest IIM genetic study to date, reveals new insights into the genetic architecture of these rare diseases and suggests different predominating pathophysiology in different clinical subgroups.

Several factors are involved in the inflammatory state that characterizes the different forms of IIMs which share features and mechanisms but are clearly different with respect to the involved sites and characteristics of the inflammation. Cellular and non-cellular mechanisms of both the immune and non-immune systems have been identified as key regulators of inflammation in polymyositis/dermatomyositis, particularly at different stages of disease, leading to the fibrotic state that characterizes the end stage. Among these, a special role is played by an interferon signature and complement cascade with different mechanisms in polymyositis and dermatomyositis; these differences can be identified also histologically in muscle biopsies. Numerous cellular components of the adaptive and innate immune response are present in the site of tissue inflammation, and the complexity of idiopathic inflammatory myositis is further supported by the involvement of non-immune mechanisms such as hypoxia and autophagy. The aim of this comprehensive review is to describe the major pathogenic mechanisms involved in the onset of idiopathic inflammatory myositis and to report on the major working hypothesis with therapeutic implications.\n\nInflammatory myopathies in childhood: correlation between nailfold capillaroscopy findings and clinical and laboratory data.\n\nPubMed\n\nNascif, Ana K S; Terreri, Maria T R A; Len, ClÃ¡udio A; Andrade, Luis E C; HilÃ¡rio, Maria O E\n\n2006-01-01\n\nNailfold capillaroscopy is an important tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with rheumatic diseases, in particular dermatomyositis and scleroderma. A relationship has been observed in adults between improved capillaroscopic findings and reduced disease activity. Our aim was to correlate disease activity (clinical and laboratory data) and nailfold capillaroscopy findings in 18 patients with inflammatory myopathies. This prospective study included 13 juvenile dermatomyositis patients (Bohan and Peter criteria) (mean age of 8.8 years) and five patients with overlap syndrome (mean age of 15.7 years). We evaluated disease activity (skin abnormalities and muscle weakness, muscle enzymes and acute phase reactants) and its correlation with nailfold capillaroscopy findings (dilatation of isolated loops, dropout of surrounding vessels and giant capillary loops). We used a microscope with special light and magnification of 10 to 16X. Eighteen patients underwent a total of 26 capillaroscopic examinations, seven of them on two or more occasions (13 were performed during the active disease phase and 13 during remission). Twelve of the 13 examinations performed during the active phase exhibited scleroderma pattern and 8 of the 13 examinations performed during remission were normal. Therefore, in 20 of the 26 examinations clinical and laboratory data and nailfold capillaroscopy findings correlated (p = 0.01). Nailfold capillaroscopy is a non-invasive examination that offers satisfactory correlation with disease activity and could be a useful tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory myopathies.\n\nDifferences in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy phenotypes and genotypes between Mesoamerican Mestizos and North American Caucasians: ethnogeographic influences in the genetics and clinical expression of myositis.\n\nPubMed\n\nShamim, Ejaz A; Rider, Lisa G; Pandey, Janardan P; O'Hanlon, Terrance P; Jara, Luis J; Samayoa, Eduardo A; Burgos-Vargas, Ruben; Vazquez-Mellado, Janitzia; Alcocer-Varela, Jorge; Salazar-Paramo, Mario; Kutzbach, Abraham Garcia; Malley, James D; Targoff, Ira N; Garcia-De la Torre, Ignacio; Miller, Frederick W\n\n2002-07-01\n\nAs part of a larger, worldwide study of the ethnogeography of myositis, we evaluated the clinical, serologic, and immunogenetic features of Mestizo (Mexican and Guatemalan) and North American Caucasian patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). Clinical manifestations, autoantibodies, HLA-DRB1 and DQA1 alleles, and immunoglobulin Gm/Km allotypes were compared between 138 Mestizos with IIM and 287 Caucasians with IIM, using the same classification criteria and standardized questionnaires. IIM in Mestizo patients was characterized by a higher proportion of dermatomyositis (69% of adult Mestizos versus 35% of adult Caucasians; P < 0.001) and anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (30% versus 7% of adults, respectively, and 32% versus 4% of children, respectively; P < 0.01). Genetic risk factors also differed in these populations. Whereas Mestizos had no HLA risk factors for IIM, HLA-DRB1*0301, the linked allele DQA1*0501, and DRB1 alleles sharing the first hypervariable region motif (9)EYSTS(13) were major risk factors in Caucasian patients with IIM. Furthermore, different HLA-DRB1 and DQA1 alleles were associated with anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (DRB1*04 and DQA1*03 in Mestizos and DRB1*07 and DQA1*02 in Caucasians). Immunoglobulin gamma-chain allotypes Gm(1), Gm(17) (odds ratio for both 11.3, P = 0.008), and Gm(21) (odds ratio 7.3, P = 0.005) and kappa-chain allotype Km(3) (odds ratio 7.3, P = 0.005) were risk factors for IIM in Mestizos; however, no Gm or Km allotypes were risk or protective factors in Caucasians. In addition, Gm and Km phenotypes were unique risk factors (Gm 1,3,17 5,13,21 and Gm 1,17 23 21 and Km 3,3) or protective factors (Km 1,1) for the development of myositis and anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (Gm 1,2,3,17 23 5,13,21) in adult Mestizos. IIM in Mesoamerican Mestizos differs from IIM in North American Caucasians in the frequency of phenotypic features and in the immune-response genes predisposing to and"
