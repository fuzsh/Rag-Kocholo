        "text": "From the first century a.d. to the late third there existed a group of soldiers known as the frumentarii. Centralized in the late first century, they became an increasingly important force throughout the second century until Diocletian abolished them at the end of the third. Modern scholarship has usually seen their purpose as encompassing three roles: couriers, military police and secret police, with the last attracting the most attention.\n\nThis research addresses two main questions. (1) How the Office of Agentes was bureaucratically structured? This is still a debated topic, and there is no consensus among scholars. This research tries to provide a new understanding that would overcome all the weaknesses of the current understandings. (2) What were the functions of the Agentes? At first glance, several scholars called them the messengers and the secret service of the later Roman empire. Being secret service meant that they strenuously spied on other officials ferreting out traitors and corrupted officials. In this regard, some scholars do not agree and have raised concerns about labelling them with the term secret service. The scholars in favour of calling them secret service are mostly from the earlier period, and they have presented their arguments extensively. In contrast, later scholars have raised concerns and put forward problems of the former interpretations, but no one has written comprehensively. Furthermore, the current available studies only focus on how the Agentes contributed to Roman peace keeping, and a comprehensive and extensive study on the office of the Agentes as an office in the later Roman empire has never been done. Therefore, by reducing the emphasis on its roles as the ‘secret service’ and focusing on its roles as an administrative tool, this study approaches the office of Agentes differently and tries to contribute some new findings.\n\nACCESO A NÚMERO COMPLETO: https://doi.org/10.14201/shha202139 RESUMEN: Este artículo ofrece una perspectiva poco explorada sobre las funciones y evolución de un cuerpo especial perteneciente al ejército romano, los frumentarii. Asociados a la categoría de principales, al abastecimiento y distribución de suministros, y especialmente de grano, como su nombre parece indicar, fueron prontamente encargados de una gran cantidad de actividades adicionales. Misiones para transportar materiales de lujo a Roma, «espionaje», vigilancia, servicio de policía, asesinatos, recogida de tributos y supervisión de la defensa en las provincias fueron algunos de los dispares, aunque esenciales, cometidos que la tropa llevó a cabo hasta finales del siglo III. Aunque al parecer su pésima reputación propició la disolución del cuerpo, durante muchos años fueron los ojos y oídos de los emperadores. Intentaremos explicar su desarrollo e importancia en la sociedad romana, haciendo hincapié en la pervivencia de sus habilidades militares. ABSTRACT: This article offers a fresh perspective about the role and evolution of one of the sections of the Roman army, the Frumentarii. Linked with the rank of principales, and with the supply and provisions, especially grain, as their name seems to indicate, this squad took at an early date a great deal of additional functions. Missions to drive and protect luxury stuff to Rome, «espionage», surveillance, police duties, murder, collecting taxes and provincial defense supervision, were some of the unalike but key functions carried by them until the end of Third Century. Although it seems as their infamous reputation fostered their disbandment, for long years they were the emperors’ ears and eyes. We will try to explain their development and importance in the Roman society, highlighting the survival of their military skills.\n\nThe article The Eyes and Ears:1) Provides a brief analysis of the several parallel security organizations of the two superpowers of antiquitywhen they were still at their prime; 2) Discusses both internal and external security matters; 3) Analyzes separately the military and civilian intelligence; 4) Examines the role of the religious organizations, ‘heresies’ and security; 5) Discusses briefly the ways in which the intelligence was obtained, analyzed, assessed and disseminated, and for what purpose; 6) Provides an overview of the successes and failures and of the limits of intelligence; 7) Demonstrates some similarities between modern and ancient practices\n\nRome was the most important state of the mediterranean world and she managed to keep wide territories under her control thanks to the power of her army and her administrative structure. Emerging as a tiny city state in the middle of Italy, Rome became the ruler of all the Mediterranean in the course of centuries and naturally she had to fight against all sorts of threats both internal and external. Intelligence activities come to the picture in this context. According to our extant ancient sources, the Romans benefited different kinds of methods and practices in order to provide internal security, to become aware of possible external threats or to keep track of enemy troops in times of war. In this paper I intend to show with the help of some examplary cases which methods the Romans used to collect intelligence both in times of war and peace for keeping internal order intact and for neutralizing the external threats throughout her history."
