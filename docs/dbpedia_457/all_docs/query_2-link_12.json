Burn J. 2022, 3(4), 533-779; https://doi.org/10.3390/ebj3040046\n\nSubmission received: 2 August 2022 / Accepted: 10 August 2022 / Published: 25 November 2022\n\nAbstract\n\n:\n\nAbstracts of the workshops, plenary sessions, oral and poster presentations of the 19th EBA Congress in Turin, Italy, 7–10 September 2022.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nDear friends and colleagues,\n\nIt is an honor to present the abstracts of the 19th EBA Congress, held in Turin in September 2022. Some of you were here in person, and some were online; some will read the abstracts of the presentations for the first time in this special issue of the European Burns Journal. during the last two years, the period defined as the Covid Era, we faced a very complex situation. Healthcare professionals dedicated their energies to caring for patients during the spread of a pandemic. In many cases, health professionals were also victims of the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it was an absolute pleasure to meet again in Turin. The 19th EBA Congress was comprehensive and articulated and provided us the opportunity to exchange experiences, ideas, and expectations in the field of burn care. The topic of “Identity” was developed during the Congress in Turin through a holistic and inclusive approach. Identity defines us as burn care professionals and guides us in treating burns and deciding the specific therapies needed, from lab examinations to wound healing to psychological support. It is Identity that our patients are looking for, after their traumas, for social reintegration purposes and to recover as individuals. Burn care professionals from different fields joined the Congress and looked at this crucial concept from different points of view. Experienced colleagues shared their knowledge in the various sessions, and the youngest professionals proposed new contributions. Technical and scientific advancements were presented, and humanistic disciplines, such as narrative medicine, arts, and social sciences, were included to provide a broader understanding of burn care. We are sure that, reading and studying this special issue of the EBJ, all of us will find a deeper conception of our everyday practice and a fresher motivation to develop further and research burn care.\n\n2. Workshops\n\nW.001\n\nMy Softest Scar: Tension Reducing Taping to Improve Scarring\n\nPeter Moortgat 1 and Danila Toscano 2\n\n1\n\nOSCARE, Antwerp, Belgium\n\n2\n\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation University, Orthopedic and Trauma, Center (CTO), Città della Salute e della Scienza, Turin, Italy\n\nBurn scars require a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to improving aesthetic and functional results. Tension-reducing taping showed beneficial effects in the post-acute rehabilitation phase of burns. This workshop allows you to meet physical therapists of two different European centers who integrate the use of taping into their multimodal approach to post burns care. They will share with you the theory behind their methods, their practical approaches toward physical scar management, and the demonstration of their specific tension-reducing taping techniques.\n\nW.002\n\nVisual Arts in Burn Surgery\n\nMark Fisher 1, Laura Pompermaier 2, Dacia Mastrantuono 3, Anna Marchisio 3 and Elisa Curestiuc 4\n\n1\n\nThe University of Iowa, USA\n\n2\n\nLinköping University, Sweden\n\n3\n\nArts High School, Turin, Italy\n\n4\n\nLanguage High Scool, Turin, Italy\n\nVisual arts introduce different ways of thinking and perceiving the identity and beauty of people.\n\nThe practice of visual arts, such as drawing, sculpture and photography, may be integrated into the burn reconstructive process, allowing professionals and patients to see, perceive and feel the self after injury.\n\nThe Workshop will include two parts: a didactic session reviewing the use of visual art tools in the planning of reconstructive burn surgery, and a practical charcoal studio drawing session with the guidance of art students and experienced instructors. Participants will draw a series of ‘virtual models’ with burn contractures and deformities. Through this experience we will develop our ability to burn reconstructive process.\n\nW.003\n\nOptimal Nutritional Therapy in Patients with Burns: From Theory to Practice\n\nYvonne Verweij-Tilleman 1, Frederiek G. Bosch 2 and Daren K. Heyland 3\n\n1\n\nBurn Centre Maasstad Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n\n2\n\nAssociation of Dutch Burn Centres and Burn Centre Groningen, Martini Hospital, The Netherlands\n\n3\n\nDepartment of Medicine, Queen’s University, Kingston, Canada\n\nNutritional therapy is an essential part of the multidisciplinary burn treatment.\n\nIn fact, burns induce a hypermetabolic, inflammatory and catabolic state, leading to increased nutritional demands. Suboptimal nutritional therapy, and immobilisation or lack of exercise further worsen nutritional status. Malnutrition in hospitalised patients is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, decreased wound healing, daily functioning, substantial longer in hospital stay, and increased costs.\n\nHowever, feeding patients with severe burns according to current guidelines can be a challenge.\n\nDuring this workshop, both theory and practice of delivering optimal nutritional therapy in patients with burns will be covered. Current state of the evidence, including current scientific knowledge gaps, practical experiences and opportunities for the optimisation of nutritional therapy will be shared and discussed with participants.\n\nW.004\n\nCosmetic Camouflage Make-Up for Restoring Burn Survivors’ Identity\n\nFranck Duteille 1, Stefania Anna Simone 2, Silvia Magi 3 and Antonella Lanzoni 4\n\n1\n\nCHU de Nantes, Service de Chirurgie Plastique Reconstructrice et Esthétique, Centre des Brûlés Adultes et Enfants, Faculté de Médecine de Nantes\n\n2\n\nUniversity Hospital, Graz, Austria University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland\n\n3\n\nOrthopedic and Trauma Center (CTO), Cittá Della Salute e Della Scienza, Turin, Italy\n\n4\n\nMunicipality of Turin, Italy\n\nVisible scars and skin irregularities, after burn injuries, alter a person’s body image, self-esteem and result in significant distress. Medical camouflage offers a way to color-match skin irregularities and reduces the visual attention to the scars from people around those affected. Camouflage is an important tool that gives those affected a choice over their appearance and a sense of control over how they want to look every day. during this workshop, you will have the opportunity to learn more about the application of camouflage techniques: starting with theoretical basics, turning over to practical examples and discussing tips based on personal experiences. Camouflage’s role in rebuilding confidence after burn injuries will be discussed in the panel afterwards.\n\n3.

When will we choose to intubate or ventilate our patient? Maybe will we perform a tracheostomy?\n\n4. Keynote Lectures\n\nK.001\n\nAcute Surgical Management in Austere Settings\n\nHabib Ur Rahman Qasim, Kabul, Afghanistan\n\nThe Burn Unit at Indira Gandhi Hospital (Kabul, Afghanistan) is the country’s sole children’s burn unit.\n\nThe Indira Gandhi Hospital is a 400 beds hospital located in Kabul, Afghanistan. The Burn Unit was established in 2013 and, thanks to the support of several international organizations (Kinderspistal Zurich, SDC, Interburns UK, and ECPB), nowadays have 36 beds for burns, serving around 1000 burn patients per year (mean TBSA 25%, mean age 6 years). The leading cause of burns is scalded (around 67%). The help of international organizations played a critical role in the development of staff capacity through coaching, mentoring, training, and exposure visits. These learning opportunities played a vital role in building capacities and upgrading the knowledge of the Indira Gandhi staff in burn care.\n\nK.002\n\nThe Use of Procalcitonin to Guide Antibiotic Therapy in Burns\n\nAmen Messadi, Intensive Burn Care Department, Trauma and Burn Center, Tunis, Tunisia\n\nIntroduction: The use of biomarkers, necessarily coupled with close clinical examination, may predict outcomes, and monitor the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, allowing faster de-escalation or stop. reducing the development of resistance and the financial cost. The objective of our study was to evaluate the interest of plasma procalcitonin (PCT) biomarker to guide the initiation, modification and discontinuation of antibiotics in septic burn patients. Methods: a prospective, observational study was conducted in a 20-bed Burn Intensive Care Unit in Tunisia, for 13 months (August 2018–September 2019). Burn patients admitted in ICU developed sepsis were included. Sepsis was retained according to the French Burn Association Criteria for the presence of infection. Patients who died or were discharged before day 3 of the protocol were excluded. Serum PCT was measured over the entire septic episode every 48 h until resolution of infection based on clinical signs and decrease of PCT about 80% compared to its of initial value. Patients were assigned to two groups depending on the clinical course and outcome: Group A = patients with favorable evolution; Group B = patients with unfavorable evolution. Results: A total of 120 septic patients admitted to the Burn ICU were included in our study. The mean age was 32 ± 17 years. TBSA was 32 ± 14%. UBS was 40 ± 25 and ABSI was 6 ± 2. Secondary transfer was reported in 55% of cases. They were mainly thermal burns in 79% of cases and electrical burns in 21%. Sepsis occurred at 3 days after burns. Initial PCT was positive (>0.69 ng/mL) in all patients with a median value of 12 ng/mL (maximum 200 ng/mL). Conclusion: monitoring PCT in septic burn patients allows to Predict effectiveness of sepsis treatment at day 3 when decreased by 30% or above compared to its initial value and lead to decrease the duration of antibiotic treatment with an average duration of treatment of 5 days reducing antibiotic exposure and selective pressure of multidrug resistance bacteria.\n\nK.003\n\nThe Importance of Data in Burn Care\n\nProf. Naiem Moiemen, Birmingham, United Kingdom\n\nNo abstract available.\n\nK.004\n\nEnzymatic Debridement: Indications, Technique and Complications\n\nMaurizio Governa, Verona, Italy\n\nEnzymatic debridement is a powerful tool for selective burn eschar removal as an alternative of early surgical debridement. We retrospectively analyze our experience with Nexobrid from 2017 to 2022: 136 patients were treated (mean age 54 y.o.), with deep second and third-degree burns involving a mean 27%TBSA. We revised the indications and the technique already approved by the European consensus and SIUST Italian consensus; clinical outcome is presented focusing and burns involving the hands and the face, subpopulations of pediatric and elderly patients, severe (<40%TBSA) burns. The procedure, if correctly performed in the first 72 h from trauma, proved to be a powerful tool to remove eschar, reducing blood loss and the need for autologous skin.\n\nK.005\n\nKeynote Lecture: From Basic Research to Clinical Practice\n\nTiziana Musso, Turin, Italy\n\nBacterial infections are a main factor in determining burn wound progression. The evolution of resistance to last-resort antibiotics, such as colistin (Col), in multidrug–resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, causes a relevant problem in the treatment of burn wound infections.\n\nProgress in nanomedicine has provided a chance to develop nanotherapeutics that efficiently prevent infections and facilitate healing of burn wounds. Currently nanostructures include liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (NPs), polymer nanodrugs, protein and metal-based NPs. These nanocarriers have been proposed for antibiotic delivery to increase drug at the infection sites and manage antimicrobial resistance. New delivery systems for Col, to be used both for topic and parental administration may improve bioavailability and toxicity. We developed a for mulation of chitosan-coated human albumin nanoparticles for the Col delivery (Col/haNPs) and evaluated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity as well as the biocompatibility. We next optimized a topical for mulation named “NANOFILM”, based on a film for ming spray (glycerol, etilacetate and the copolymer Plastoid® B) and Col/haNPs. The Col/haNPs showed size lower than 200 nm, high encapsulation efficiency and a prolonged in vitro release of Col. The safety of the nano for mulation was demonstrated by the absence of cytotoxicity on epithelial cells and human skin and hemolytic activity. Both Col/haNPs and the NANOFILM can reduce the MIC values respect to free Col, in both MDR Col resistant and Col susceptible strains. Moreover, the Col/haNPs displayed a potent biofilm inhibition and significantly reduced the biofilm at 1/2 MIC. By contrast, Col free is able to reduce biofilm only at higher concentrations. The antimicrobial effect of NANOFILM was also demonstrated in an ex vivo skin infection model using A. baumannii. Our findings suggest that Col/haNPs represent a promising nanocarrier for Col topical delivery with high antimicrobial activity on MDR GNB.\n\nK.006\n\nBurn Care Outcomes: An International Perspective\n\nLaura Pompermaier, Sweden\n\nMeasurable changes in the health status of an individual attributed to provided interventions are defined as health care outcomes, and they can be used to evaluate the quality of care, highlighting effective strategies. The ISBI seeks to a global standard of burn care but had not yet indicated burn care specific outcomes of global interest, which might contribute to increase transparency, guide quality improvement, and harmonize the standard of care. for this reason, in 2021 the ISBI-Burn Care Committee developed a survey to identify quality indicators for the specific need of burn care, based on scientific evidence, and distributed it among international burn care providers. Most of 124 responders were physicians from Americas and Europe, although responders included individuals from all WHO-regions and from all burn care professionals. More than 80% of responders indicated in-hospital mortality and incidence of severe infections as significant outcome-quality indicators. If on the one hand establishing mortality is indisputable, on the other hand assess severe infections is not as easy, since there is no professional consensus on a universal definition of infection. Development of pressure sores during the hospitalization was considered important by only 1% of responders, and this finding might mirror the low response rate of nursing staff (5%). Agreement on feasible outcome-indicators is a first step to achieve a global standard of care. However, since burn care is resource-intensive and dependent on resources availability, quality indicators of the structural and processual characteristics of settings in which burn care is provided should also be evaluated to contextualize and interpret the findings on outcomes.\n\nK.007\n\nToxicology in Burn Patients\n\nRomolo Villani, Naple, Italy\n\nThe number of intoxications among severe burns is underestimated in hospital cases since most of them die at the scene of the accident. Carbon monoxide and cyanide, generated by the combustion of organic and plastic products, are the main agents that through the inhalation route lead to intoxication of the burn victim. These substances interfere with blood transport and mitochondrial use of oxygen. We have tools that allow us to quickly and effectively identify monoxide in the blood of our patients, while unfortunately a specific and appropriate diagnosis for cyanide intoxication is not yet available. The latter should be suspected whenever carbon monoxide poisoning occurs, with high lactate values, especially if higher than 10 mmoL/L. Only immediate treatment, started already in the pre-hospital phase, can reduce the number of inhalation victims. Therefore, rescuers must have specific diagnostic equipment and everything needed for treatment: high concentration oxygen, high doses of Vit. B12, hyperbaric therapy. Burn patients who have inhaled even when they arrive at the hospital have a worse prognosis. With the same age and extent of burns, the risk of death is almost doubled. But monoxide and cyanide are not the only poisons with which the burned person can come into contact. Methemoglobinizing substances and many other chemicals can be involved in the poisoning of burn victims. Also in these cases, the speed of diagnosis and treatment is essential, through the use of all available antidotes.\n\nK.008\n\nKeynote Lecture: Principles of Burn Wound Closure\n\nJuan P. Barret, Spain\n\nNo abstract available.\n\nK009\n\nPrinciples of Scar Treatment in Rehabilitation\n\nPeter Moortgat, Oscare, Antwerp, Belgium\n\nRehabilitation is only one part of the multi-disciplinary approach of burn scar management, although it might be considered as the most time-intensive part. To obtain an optimal outcome 6 key principles should always be kept in mind. Know your patient. It is indispensable to know as much as possible about your patient by means of an intake for m. Examples of intake variables are age, gender, genetic predisposition, blood pressure, hormonal activity, occupation, etc… Listen to your patient. Nowadays patient empowerment has become increasingly important. PROMs are an important tool to know what is important to your patient. POSAS, EQ-5D, BSHS-B, SF-36 and DLQI are the most widely used PROMs in (burn) scar management. Measure. In scar assessment objective and subjective measurement tools are equally important and should be used both. Colour, thickness, pliability, texture and hydration are the most frequently measured scar characteristics. Choose the right treatment. The objective and subjective assessments for m a base to choose the right treatment. To date there exists a wide variety of treatment algorithms depending on the type of scar (e.g., hypertrophic, linear, burn, keloid). Know what you are doing inside that scar. Knowledge of the working mechanisms of different scar treatments is inevitable to obtain the best outcomes. Scientific literature can help us to increase our understanding of the mechanisms leading to scar remodelling. Re-evaluate and adjust treatment. Re-evaluation should be performed on a regular basis. The results of these assessments help us to evaluate the effectiveness of our treatment plan. According to the results adjustment of the treatment plan can be necessary. To optimize our outcomes, we have to raise awareness about treatment options, improve health literacy of the patient and educate specialized caregivers. Digital care pathways, informative websites and specialist search engines can be helpful tools to reach our goals.\n\nK.010\n\nBasic Principles of Burn Care in Children\n\nMartin Meuli, Switzerland\n\nNo abstract available.\n\nK.011\n\nThe EBA Verification Program\n\nClemens Schiestl, Switzerland\n\nNo abstract available.\n\nK.012\n\nReconstruction in Austere Settings: The Role of International Organizations\n\nEnrique Steiger, Switzerland\n\nNo abstract available.\n\nK.013\n\nHow COVID-19 Has Been Affecting Burn Care\n\nThomas Leclerc, Clamart, France\n\nSince 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented worldwide healthcare crisis. It has impacted almost all human activities including burn care. Burns epidemiology changed. Hospital admissions for burns decreased or remained stable, with differences among age groups. They were related to more severe burns, suggesting appropriate triage. Scalds increased in children and so did psychiatric disorders in adults. Many fire disasters occurred in hospitals. The organization of burn care also changed. Thanks to quick adaptation, despite shortages, burn care successfully went on. Burn treatment capacity often decreased. Many burn professionals helped manage COVID-19 patients. Before vaccines, COVID-19 positive burn patients had to be cohorted in dedicated isolation units, hence a need for complex triage. Infection control and prevention involved strictest zoning, hygiene and personal protective equipment procedures. Regional strategic planning, astute management of limited resources, preservation of burn care workforce, strict cohorting, and adaptation of treatment strategies were fundamental to tackle the crisis. Under pressure, telemedicine received a boost that will last. after vaccines, less severe outbreaks occurred. COVID-19 positive burn patients needed no more cohorting but still highest hygiene and safety precautions. Saturated ICUs had to triage not only COVID-19 patients but also other critical conditions including severe burns. Surgical procedures had to be delayed according to prioritization rules. Critically ill patients including those with severe burns also had to undergo prioritization for critical care. COVID-19 associated with burns posed specific medical challenges, but whether it worsened outcomes is unclear. ARDS was managed according to general recommendations with adjusted isolation precautions. Eligible patients received dexamethasone without burn specificity. On the whole, burn care providers hardly yet successfully met major organizational challenges during the crisis, but COVID-19 is not over. Further research is still highly needed.\n\nK.014\n\nMay We Prevent Burn Injuries? The EBA Activities\n\nMamta Shah, Manchester, United Kingdom\n\nBurn injuries are a global problem acknowledged by WHO (A WHO plan for burn prevention and care 2018). Apart from deaths, non-fatal burns are the leading cause of morbidity, disabilities and disfigurement with many man-h of work lost. Burn care is a huge burden to the health systems across the globe. Hence prevention has been the focus of health professionals in burn care for decades. Despite some inroads into prevention by legislative changes to themoregulation valves for hot water, building regulations, nightwear legislation as a few examples of success stories, we are far from achieving our goals particularly for children. It is time to revisit the history of prevention and understand the need to engage with a wide range of professionals, patients and carers to make an impact in preventing burn injuries. Prevention programmes should be tailored to the needs of the local populations in the areas and this requires an understanding of the key causes of burn injuries. Data collection is fundamental to measuring the impact of any prevention programme but awareness of how burns occur in the population, goes a long way in preventing the problem. Public engagement is key to success. The EBA is best placed to share best practises (education), support and promote data collection (burns awareness, share real life stories, public engagement), collaborate (research and development of products causing burn injury, engineering, geo-mapping of burn injuries) and advocacy (legislation, governments) and work with other non-governmental organisations to support the common cause of prevention of burns.\n\nK.015\n\nSmall Adults? Insights in Pediatric Burn Care\n\nNaiem Moiemen, United Kingdom\n\nNo abstract available.\n\nK.016\n\nInternational Humanitarian Organizations and Burn Care\n\nTom Potokar, Switzerland\n\nThe aim of any humanitarian organization working in burn care should be to reduce the incidence of burn injuries and to improve the outcomes. A simple enough aim in theory, but very difficult to put into practice in the complex environment of low resources, insecurity and competing demands. There is no one size fits all approach and individuals and organisations should be aware of their strengths and their limitations. Different organisations have different skill sets and modes of operation and emergency, conflict, and development work require different responses (for example NGO’s experienced in emergency response and adhering to WHO EMT minimum standards are appropriate to respond to a mass casualty burn event—professional associations are not—although they may have members who can deploy with a suitable NGO) There is a gradient from complete substitution to embedded support to distance based support, and different contexts will determine which of these is the most appropriate. However, whatever the approach there should be no ‘us ‘ and ‘them’ only ‘we’. Assessment must be comprehensive and look at assets as well as needs and the goal must be to achieve at least minimum standards of care. Education and training resources must be contextualized and tailored to the specific requirements and resources should be screened for quality and relevance. The final pathway to improvement is behavior change and motivation as well as an understanding of the knowledge to action pipeline, implementation science and health systems are as critical as purely clinical skills for creating sustainable impact. However, stainable change is ultimately a political, educational and socio-economic issue.\n\nK.017\n\nAntibiotic Stewardship in Burn Patients\n\nAthina Lavrentieva\n\nA-ICU, Burn ICU, Papanikolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nAntibiotic stewardship is a central component of approach to management of infectious complications in burn patients. Antibiotic stewardship has been defined as the coordinated interventions designed to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobials by promoting the selection of the optimal antimicrobial drug regimen, dose, duration of therapy, and route of administration. The key elements of antibiotic stewardship include: leadership, prospective audit and feedback, antibiotic reevaluation (time-out), rapid diagnostics and laboratory testing, clinical pathways, computerized decision support, infection control (preventive strategies that reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection). Implementing ASP in the burn unit environment is challenging, as no single measure alone will be successful. The three pivotal moments during an antibiotic therapy are: the initiation of the antibiotic treatment, the moments of re-evaluation during treatment also known as the antibiotic time-out, the de-escalation and discontinuation of an antibiotic treatment. Source control is an essential component in the management of burn would infection. Antibiotic use should be considered a core competency of burn practitioners; as one of the largest consumers of antibiotics in the hospital, Burn Unit is well situated to reap benefit from an implementation of effective practices of ASP: (1) Collect microbiological samples before starting antimicrobial therapy (2) De-escalate antibiotics (3) Reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy as much as possible (4) Do not administer antibiotics for burn wound infection without clinical indications of infection (5) Address source control as rapidly as possible (e.g., catheter removal, abscess drainage, wound excision-grafting) (6) Optimize antibiotic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) parameters (7) Monitor therapeutic drug concentration.\n\nK.018\n\nAnalyzing the Root Cause of Burn Scars: The Key to Designing Effective Prevention and Treatment\n\nMark Fisher, Iowa, USA\n\nEvery time we have a clinic encounter with a burn patient with scars and contractures, we are faced with the challenge of understanding the root cause of the problem before us. Principles of plastic surgery were perhaps more emphasized in previous generations and our approach to analysis and pedagogy would benefit by a return to principle-based practice. And yet there is also room for considerable elaboration of this concept. Our analysis of the burn scar and contracture needs to be informed by more than a physiologic analysis: we also need to understand the contracture in terms of the patients’ perspective and in the larger psychosocial context. during the present session we review multiple illustrative cases to explore root-cause analysis of the burn scar contracture in this light.\n\n5. Oral Presentations\n\nO.001\n\nA Prospective Multi-Centre Randomised Study for the Treatment of Burns with Dermis Grafts or Split-Thickness Skin Grafts\n\nAndrew Lindford 1, Sinan Dogan 2, Moustafa Elmasry 2, Folke Sjöberg 2, Esko Kankuri 3, Jyrki Vuola 1, Jussi Valtonen 1, Ahmed T.

Its limitations are well known and relate to donor-site morbidity and recipient-site aesthetic issues (mesh patterns, wound contracture, and scarring). The aim of this study was to investigate whether donor-site morbidity (healing time and cosmesis) could be reduced by a novel, modified STSG technique using only the dermal component. The secondary objective was to examine the effects of this pure dermis graft on the recipient site in comparison to a standard STSG.\n\nMethods: We report a prospective, randomised controlled, multi-centre, intra-individual comparison study. Twenty-one patients received a dermis graft and a regular STSG. Aesthetic and scar assessments were performed using The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and a Cutometer Dual MPA 580 on both donor and recipient sites. These were also examined histologically for remodelling and scar for mation.\n\nResults: Dermis and the STSG donor sites healed in 8 and 14 days, p < 0.005, respectively. Patient-reported POSAS showed better values for colour at all three time measurements (3, 6, and 12 months) and the observers rated both vascularity and pigmentation to be improved at these time points (p < 0.01). Scar for mation was seen at the dermis donor and recipient sites after 6 months as in the standard scar healing process.\n\nConclusions: The dermis graft reduced donor site morbidity, as it healed faster and with better cosmesis than the standard STSG. The overall long-term outcome favoured the dermis grafting technique. However, this needs to be further explored.\n\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT05189743).\n\nO.002\n\nMeek Micrografting for Burns; Review on its Outcomes. Searching for the Superior Skin Grafting Technique\n\nDanielle Rijpma 1,2, Karel Claes 3,4, Henk Hoeksema 3,4, Ignace de Decker 3,4, Jozef Verbelen 3,4, Stan Monstrey 3,4, Anouk Pijpe 1,2,5,6, Paul van Zuijlen 1,2,6,7,8 and Annebeth de Vries 1,8,9\n\n1\n\nBurn Centre of Red Cross Hospital\n\n2\n\nAmsterdam UMC Location Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery\n\n3\n\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, Ghent University Hospital\n\n4\n\nGhent Burn Center, Ghent University Hospital\n\n5\n\nAssociation of Dutch Burn Centres, Burn Centre, Red Cross Hospital Beverwijk\n\n6\n\nAmsterdam Movement Sciences Institute, Amsterdam UMC\n\n7\n\nDepartment of Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery, Red Cross Hospital\n\n8\n\nDepartment of Pediatric Surgery, Amsterdam UMC, location AMC\n\n9\n\nDepartment Surgery, Red Cross Hospital\n\nObjectives: Autologous split-thickness skin grafting is the standard of care for most deep dermal and full-thickness burns. Meshed grafting is most commonly used. Patients with extensive burn injuries have limited donor-site availability. Meek micrografting is a well-known technique to enable larger expansions. We conducted a review on the outcomes of micrografting.\n\nMethods: A literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted from the first report of micrografting in 1958 until February 2021, including the terms ‘burns’, ‘micrografting’ and/or ‘Meek’. Original papers reporting the outcomes of Meek micrografting were included.\n\nResults: In total, 1529 papers were identified, and 15 articles were included. Most studies were rated as poor study quality. Weighted averages could be calculated for three outcome parameters: 82 ± 7% for ‘graft take’, 51 ± 18 days for ‘time to wound healing’ and 53 ± 23 days for ‘length of hospital stay’. Scar quality was minimally described and often poorly assessed. Limited data were available on the outcomes’ donor-site size, bacterial load and rate of wound infection, number of operations and cost effectiveness.\n\nConclusions: Multiple outcomes of Meek micrografting from the 15 included studies were evaluated. The overall study quality was poor, and there is a specific lack of data on scar quality. Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions on the outcomes of Meek micrografting. To further investigate the performance of Meek micrografting, a randomized controlled trial is required.\n\nO.003\n\nHydrosurgical and Conventional Debridement of Burns: Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nNine Legemate 1,2, Kelly Kwa 3, Harold Goei 1, Anouk Pijpe 3, Esther Middelkoop 2,3, Paul van Zuijlen 2,3, Gerard Beerthuizen 4, Marianne Nieuwenhuis 4, Margriet van Baar 1, Kees van der Vlies 1 and the HyCon Study Group 1,2,3,4\n\n1\n\nBurn Centre, Maasstad Hospital\n\n2\n\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, AmsterdamUMC\n\n3\n\nBurn Centre, Red Cross Hospital\n\n4\n\nBurns Centre, Martini Hospital\n\nObjectives: Tangential excision of burned tissue followed by skin grafting is the cornerstone of burn surgery. Hydrosurgery has become popular for tangential excision, with the hypothesis that enhanced the preservation of vital dermal tissue reduces scarring. The aim of this trial was to compare scar quality after hydrosurgical versus conventional debridement before split-skin grafting.\n\nMethods: A double-blind randomized within-patient multicentre controlled trial was conducted in patients with burns that required split-skin grafting. One wound area was randomized to hydrosurgical debridement and the other to Weck knife debridement. The primary outcome was scar quality at 12 months, assessed with the observer part of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Secondary outcomes included complications, scar quality, colour, pliability, and histological dermal preservation.\n\nResults: Overall, 137 patients were randomized. At 12 months, scars of the hydrosurgically debrided wounds had a lower POSAS observer total item score (mean 2.42 (95 per cent c.i. 2.26 to 2.59) versus 2.54 (95 per cent c.i. 2.36 to 2.72; p = 0.023)) and overall opinion score (mean 3.08 (95 per cent c.i. 2.88 to 3.28) versus 3.30 (95 per cent c.i. 3.09–3.51); p = 0.006). Patient-reported scar quality and pliability measurements were significantly better for the hydrosurgically debrided wounds. Complication rates did not differ between both treatments. Histologically, significantly more dermis was preserved with hydrosurgery (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions: One year after surgery, scar quality and pliability were better for hydrosurgically debrided burns, probably owing to enhanced histological preservation of the dermis.\n\nO.004\n\nThe Timing of Surgery of Intermediate Depth Burns\n\nDenise Van Uden 1, Inge Spronk 1,2,3, Margriet E. van Baar 1,2, Anouk Pijpe 4,5,6,7, Annebeth Meij-de Vries 4,9, Marianne K.

Generally, there are two treatment strategies (1) early skin grafting (within 7 days postburn) or (2) conservative antimicrobial topical treatment with grafting after 14–21 days for the remaining defects, if needed. These strategies have pros and cons with little known about patient-relevant outcomes. It is important to take the patients’ preferences into consideration while making the treatment decision in addition to clinical necessity. Therefore, we aimed to gain insight into patient-relevant outcomes and (cost)effectiveness of both treatment strategies for patients with intermediate burn wounds.\n\nMethods: A core set of process indicators, outcomes and cost components (value-based healthcare (VBHC)-burns core set) will be developed. This will be conducted by identifying current process indicators and outcomes in a metadata catalogue, identifying important patient outcomes by questionnaires, and reaching a consensus by a modified Delphi Method finalizing the core set. Next, our current registries will be updated according to the VBHC-burns core set. Subsequently, the core set will be used in the cluster cross-over study, conducted in the three Dutch burn centres. during a period of nine months, patients with intermediate burns (i.e., wounds with an expected healing potential of 14–21 days, according to a laser Doppler image) receive conservative treatment with surgery if needed. during the following nine months, the treatment strategy in patients will be early skin grafting within 7 days. Outcomes of both strategies will be analysed and incorporated into a—to be developed—decision aid. An iterative process with patients and healthcare providers will finalize the decisions aid that aims at supporting shared decision-making in clinical practice.\n\nResults: We expect to include approximately 300 patients with intermediate burn wounds in each cluster of nine months. These patients will be followed for one year. The first cluster starts at 1 June 2022. The VBHC-burns core set will then be available to measure process indicators, outcomes and societal cost of both strategies. Primarily, short-term outcomes from cluster one will be presented.\n\nConclusions: This unique cluster cross-over study will provide insights into patient-relevant outcomes in the treatment decision of intermediate depth burns. The findings will inform patients and healthcare providers, serve as a practical guide to understand and prioritize the preferences and goals of patients, and support the involvement of patients in the treatment decision. Ultimately, this will lead to optimized person-centred acute burn care and improved patient-relevant outcomes while maintaining or lowering costs.\n\nO.005\n\nFunctional and Aesthetic Outcome of Acute III° Burn Injuries to the Dorsum of the Hand after Free Flap Transfer\n\nSimon Kuepper, Bernd Hartmann and Jenny E. Dornberger\n\nBG Unfallkrankenhaus\n\nObjective: Complex burns to the hand are challenging in terms of reconstructive coverage, because of the sophisticated anatomy of the upper extremity and the need to preserve as much function as possible. Special caution is required regarding sufficient debridement of devitalised tissue and a potentially increased risk of infection in the acute setting. We evaluate the outcome of seven patients over the last three years that needed acute free flap coverage. The research objectives were indication, timing, principles for flap selection, complications, flap survival rate and outcome.\n\nMethods: From January 2019 to January 2022, seven patients with deep burn wounds to the dorsum of the hand were admitted to the Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery of BG Trauma Center of Berlin, Germany. The affected patients included four males and three females, aged 2–58 years. Five of them had a work-related injury involving their dominant hand. Two patients sustained a high-voltage injury. after debridement, the defect size ranged between 3.0 cm × 2.5 cm and 9.0 cm × 6.0 cm. In three patients, thermal damage not only affected the skin, but at least one of the extensor tendons.\n\nResults: Reconstruction with cutaneous or fascia flaps within 3 weeks post-trauma was the preferred method. Defects were covered with fascia flaps in four cases, either serratus or temporal fascia. The remaining three received a free ALT flap combined with a tendon reconstruction and, if necessary, also reconstruction of the paratenon. All flaps survived; we observed one partial flap failure in a serratus fascia flap. after 6–12 weeks of focused occupational hand therapy during outpatient care, five out of seven patients showed a good-to-very-good hand function. The functionality of the hand was assessed before and after the 8 weeks of occupational therapy using the DASH questionnaire. Patients with tendon repair showed a lesser functional result. One patient had to be revised with arthrodesis in two PIP joints. All but one patient expressed satisfaction with the aesthetic result.\n\nConclusions: Our data suggest that early coverage of hand burns and even high-voltage injuries to the hand require custom-tailored reconstructive solutions for limb salvage und function preservation. Cases with required tendon repair are regarded as demanding extensive early reconstruction to preserve the best possible hand function. Fascia flaps and thin ALT-Flaps prove to have a good functional and aesthetic outcome and are reliable and suitable for the coverage of the dorsum of the hand.\n\nO.006\n\nThe Versatility of Perifascial Loose Areolar Tissue Grafting in Extremity Burns\n\nBurak Ozkan 1, Cagri A. Uysal 1 and Mehmet Haberal 2\n\n1\n\nDepartment of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, Baskent University Faculty of Medicine\n\n2\n\nDepartment of General Surgery and Burn Center, Baskent University Faculty of Medicine\n\nIntroduction: Perifascial areolar tissue (PAT) is an areolar layer over muscle fascia. It has been shown that PAT is resistant to ischemia and prone to survive even in ischemic conditions. PAT grafts provide a vascular tissue layer on necrotic bone and tendons where skin grafting cannot be possible. The effect of PAT grafting in burn reconstruction has not been reported yet. We aim to present our experience and discuss the role of PAT grafting in extremity burns.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Between January 2019 and December 2020, 16 PAT graftings were performed in 11 patients. All patients had deep full thickness burns in their upper and lower extremities with exposed bones or tendons. PAT grafts were harvested from the abdominal region. PAT grafts were utilized to the upper extremity in 7 patients and the lower extremity in 4 patients. Immediate skin grafting was performed during the same session.\n\nResults: The mean age of the patients was 50.7. The mean defect size was 3.3 × 3 cm2. The mean follow-up time was 11.8 months. The survival rates of PAT and skin grafts were 93.8 and 68.6%, respectively. Partial skin graft losses were encountered in 4 patients and total skin graft loss was seen in 1 patient.\n\nConclusions: PAT grafting is an alternative method to dermal substitutes and flap surgery in small-to-medium-sized defects with bone and tendon exposure in burn patients.\n\nO.007\n\nHow to Implement Aromatherapy on a Burn Centre\n\nAnneke Melissant and Helma Hofland\n\nMaasstadziekenhuis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n\nObjectives: Burn patients experience stress and pain during wound care despite pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological interventions such as breathing techniques, music, social talk, virtual reality, massage and aromatherapy are described to help the patient to relax and distract from pain during procedures, as well as for relaxation afterwards. These interventions can be used in combination or alone. The choice of intervention is determined by individual preferences and the situation. Many non-pharmacological interventions are used in burn care, but aromatherapy is not widely used. The aim is to identify the obstacles nurses might have when implementing this intervention.\n\nMethod: Aromatherapy is a treatment that uses scents and oils to enhance health and wellbeing. By stimulating the limbic system with soothing or uplifting scents, it initiates all kinds of processes to calm the body and mind. Essential elements in the implementation are training, obtaining material and willingness to use the intervention by the team members.\n\n1.\n\nTraining: A qualified course is necessary to implement and instruct colleagues how and when to start with aromatherapy on the ward. after the training the nurse can experiment, with patients’ consent, on the use of oils as inhalation or with massage.\n\n2.\n\nMaterial: Money from sponsors can be used to buy diffusers and oils to begin with. Once the organization realizes that aromatherapy is essential, money is budgeted to continue with this intervention. Blends of several oils can be made by the nurse depending on the needs of the patients (sleep, focus, gain control, relaxation, etc.).\n\n3.\n\nImplementation: In 2017 a dedicated nurse started a one-year training program. Actions to implement aromatherapy followed during this training, including instruction lessons on the ward to create awareness, folder with non-pharmacological interventions including demonstrations how to use aromatherapy. after the course in 2019 a small core team of interested nurses was initiated and trained by this nurse.\n\nResults: Since 2019, this intervention can be offered to patients on a regular base. All nurses on the ward are able to use diffusers. The enthusiastic core team is essential to guarantee continuity.\n\nTwo cases showing how aromatherapy was initiated into the daily routine in the burn centre will be discussed.\n\nConclusions: Aromatherapy gives a personal holistic care and can be used individually or in combination with other non-pharmacological interventions. Nurses need additional training and enthusiasm to implement aromatherapy into the daily routine of the burn centre.\n\nO.008\n\nWhich Were the Effects of Restrictive Visits during COVID Pandemic to Severely Burned Patients, Their Relatives and Medic Staff?\n\nMaluisa Pérez Del Prado, Pol Miguel Puigbarraca, Laura Garcia Gómez and Mònica Soler Rovira\n\nVall d’Hebron, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To create a research project to determine the effects of restrictive visits due to the COVID pandemic on severely burned patients, their relatives and medic staff to show off the drastic contingency plans applied during this pandemic. The imposition of restrictive visits represented a setback to the paternalistic paradigm, focused on physical and technification care, relegating dangerously psycho-emotional well-being to second place. These measures had direct consequences on the advances in quality care made by humanization in recent years. Severely burned patients had to face one of the greatest traumas that can occur, with significant physical and psychological suffering, while away from their relatives. In turn, their relatives had to cope with such an overwhelming situation, apart from their loved ones, and with increasing emotional desolation and delegation of the responsibility of the caregiving role to the health professionals.\n\nMethods: To develop a research project with quantitative and retrospective methodology at Vall d’Hebron’s Hospital Burns Unit in Barcelona that analyses how these restrictive measures affected severely burned patients, their relatives and medical staff, as well to consider the convenience and proportionality of these measures and determinate the risks and benefits that this caused in the short and medium term.\n\nResults: There are large publications that show off the reverse effects of the restrictive measures applied especially in intensive care units, but there is little information related to the burned patients. The publications recommend expanding research to determine the true scope of these measures, as well as to create visit protocols that integrate the specific needs of burned patients.\n\nConclusions: Being able to execute this research project will allow us to know how burned patients, their relatives and medical staff experienced such devastating events deprived of their loved ones, and it will help us spotlight the proportionality and convenience of the measures.\n\nO.009\n\nEvaluation of a Brief Burn-Specific Screening Instrument\n\nHelma Hofland 1,2, Anita Boekelaar 3, Anneke van de Steenoven 1 and Nancy van Loey 1,2\n\n1\n\nMaasstadhospital\n\n2\n\nAssociation of Dutch Burn Centres\n\n3\n\nRode Kruis Ziekenhuis\n\nObjectives: Burn survivors may face a variety of physical and psychological problems after their burn injury. As a consequence, supportive needs may differ across burn survivors. However, in outpatient settings, time constraints may hamper in-depth conversations to identify physical and particularly psychosocial concerns. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a screening instrument that may inform clinicians about supportive needs.\n\nMethods: Adult patients attending the outpatient clinic were asked to complete the instrument which comprises a distress thermometer (DT) and a burn-specific problem list (BS-PL). The BS-PL has 44 items divided into 9 domains: physical concerns, functional concerns, skin-therapy-related concerns, body-related concerns, stigmatization, intimacy and sexuality, psychological problems, social concerns and positive coping. Answers are scored yes/no. Additionally, burn survivors were asked whether they wanted to discuss their concerns. Correlational analyses were performed to test the adequacy of the items in relation to the level of distress. Acceptability to completers was qualitatively tested.\n\nResults: One hundred two adult patients visiting the outpatient clinic completed the DT and BS-PL. All items were used. The mean distress score was 3.92. Thirty-three burn survivors wanted to talk about their concerns with a professional; they reported higher distress scores (M = 5.97 versus M = 2.95 for those who did not want to) and they reported more frequent problems with pain, itch, fatigue and a range of psychological problems. Correlations between the DT and the BS-PL domains varied. No significant correlations between items of positive coping, skin-therapy-related concerns and social problems were observed. A cutoff point of ≥6 was suggested to indicate higher distress. Acceptability to burn survivors was high.\n\nConclusions: These preliminary results show that the DT and BS-PL are acceptable to burn survivors, contains relevant items and can be used as a screening instrument to detect possible supportive needs.\n\nO.010\n\nCompleting the Toolbox of Pain Measures: A Multicenter Clinimetric Study on Pain Measurement in Critically Ill Adults with Burns\n\nAlette De Jong 1, Wim Tuinebreijer 2, Helma Hofland 3, Jetty Meyer 4 and Nancy van Loey 3\n\n1\n\nRed Cross Hospital\n\n2\n\nErasmus MC, Trauma Research Unit\n\n3\n\nAssociation of Dutch Burn Centres, Maasstad Hospital\n\n4\n\nMartini Hospital\n\nObjectives: Pain measurement enables the evaluation of pain interventions and leads to the improvement of individualized pain treatment. There is a need for appropriate pain measurement instruments to assess pain in critically ill adults with burns who are unable to provide self-reports. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the Behaviour Pain Scale (BPS) and the Critical Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) are valid, reliable and clinical useful instruments to measure pain behaviour in critically ill adults with burns.\n\nMethods: We performed a multicentre observational cohort study with repeated measurements. Pain was assessed by BPS and CPOT, three times a day, once during wound care and twice during periods of rest, by two trained burns and/or ICU nurses who observed patients simultaneously. A questionnaire was used to survey clinical usefulness of the scales. Classical test theory according to the COSMIN guideline was applied to assess the clinimetric properties.\n\nResults: In total, 132 nurses rated 75 patients, which yielded a total of 1040 paired observations. The majority (63–87%) of nurses indicated that BPS and CPOT reflect background and procedural pain-specific features. Principal component factor analysis showed that all BPS and CPOT items were loaded on one latent factor (≥0.81). Spearman’s rho correlation between BPS and CPOT was 0.79 for background and 0.83 for procedural pain, meeting the criterion of ≥0.70. Internal consistency by Cronbach’s alpha met the criterion of ≥0.70 ≤0.95 for both types of pain, ventilated and non-ventilated patients, for both scales, except for non-ventilated patients observed by BPS (0.67). Cronbach’s alphas for CPOT were higher than for BPS. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of the total scores were sufficient (≥0.70) for both scales, but ICCs were insufficient in patients with facial burns (0.63–0.66). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed no statistically significant difference between background and procedural pain behaviour scores for both scales. The majority of the nurses indicated that the scales are short and easy to administer and are clear and easy to understand. Due to low median total scores, and thus a lack of data variation, but suggesting that pain seems well controlled, we were unable to calculate cut-off scores.\n\nConclusions: Both BPS and CPOT are valid and reliable scales for the measurement of pain in ICU patients with burns. They seem to measure one construct and show sufficient inter-rater agreement. The scales are, however, not able to distinguish background from procedural pain.\n\nO.011\n\nThe Role of Nurses in a Non-Profit Organization: Cute Project Experience\n\nEnzo Amelio, Daniele Bollero, Dorina Caldarescu, Martina Canata, Paola Curto, Alessia Desantis, Vincenzo Lo Vermi, Samantha Marocco, Eva Mesturino and Loredana Silvestro\n\nCute Project\n\nObjectives: Nurses are one of the key figures in the accomplishment of the Cute Project’s mission. The Cute Project is a non-profit organization that works at improving the quality of burn treatment and preventing burn injuries. Thanks to this program, nurses can express their potential both in Italy and through humanitarian aid.\n\nMethods: Nurses from the Cute Project teach about burn injuries and how to prevent them in Italian schools and in rural Congo, Uganda and Benin. In these countries, they offer high-quality assistance in the operating room, and they train members of the local staff in the care of adult and young patients. Furthermore, they collaborate with the doctors and surgeons of Cute Project, with the help of Sermig of Turin, in outpatient service, to ensure care to people who have difficulty accessing to the Italian Health Service.\n\nResults: Since 2016, 4042 children have taken part in that preventive program through interactive workshops in primary schools and kindergartens in Italy. Nurses have also led educational and preventive activities aimed at children in Congo, Uganda, and Benin. In these countries, the Cute Project’s scrub nurses have worked in the operating room, trained, and supervised the local scrub nurses and health workers and operated on up to 1000 patients from 2013 to 2019. They have also given theoretical lessons about nursing care to the local staff.\n\nWhen it comes to plastic surgery, in Turin, nurses and surgeons of the Cute Project examined 168 outpatients between 2014 and 2020.\n\nConclusions: Inside a non-profit organization, nurses can play a decisive role. The nature of their job (educational, technical, relational) makes them essential to the fulfillment of the mission. The Cute Project gives the opportunity to nurses to explore and develop their skills in every field possible.\n\nO.012\n\nSetting the Scene: Simulation Training for Burn Nurses\n\nSusan Molloy, Maria Wormmeester, Leo Bolhuis, Hans Eshuis, Tineke Kingma, Helma Kramer, Gerbrig Bijker, Marianne Nieuwenhuis and Aagtje Mekkering\n\nMartini Ziekenhuis\n\nObjectives: Admissions of patients with burns are acute, mostly infrequent, varying from small to life-threatening burns. This has ramifications for the expertise and proficiency of nursing staff. Long intervals can elapse between admission experiences, which in turn can cause stress. All our nurses have completed the Emergency Management of Severe Burns course; however, without follow-up, competency stagnates. To ensure their optimal admission response, we have, since 2013, introduced Simulation training. This training is an on-going process and one which demands our continuous attention. Retrospective evaluation of recorded simulations and instructors feedback revealed room for improvement. Can we improve it and if so, how? Additionally, how can we measure this improvement?\n\nMethods: Simulation training is held annually in the center’s admission room, involving all burn intensive care and general burn nurses. As per the training session, three to four nurses re-enact an acute admission according to the ABCDE method with a professional simulation actor and under the guidance of trained Crisis Resource Management (CRM) burn nurses. An extensive debriefing follows according to the CRM structure. Currently, preparation for the candidates consists of written and oral instruction. In aid thereof, we have created an instruction film of an exemplary simulation where both technical and non-technical aspects are clearly demonstrated, as proposed by Esher et al., [1]. Furthermore, the introduction of CRM to the training demanded a better scoring system than we were already using. A literature search did not provide a scoring system which fulfilled all our wishes. The closest was the TEAM scoring system Cooper et al., [2], which we adapted (TEAM Adapted to Burns (TATB)). Nurses will be shown the instruction film at the beginning of the simulation training day. All simulations are filmed and will consequently be assessed using the TATB for m.\n\nResults: Around 50 nurses participate annually. They exhibit a high competency in technical skills, but we see room for improvement, especially in: Leadership, Communication and Methodology. The effect of the simulation and impact of the addition of the instruction film will be evaluated.\n\nConclusions: We have learnt through literature studies, feedback and observation of the participants, to create an optimal learning environment and have adapted our training accordingly. Developing a Simulation training is a learning curve for all involved. We have taken many steps for ward since commencement nine years ago, and wish to share our experiences with more burn professionals.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nEscher, C.; Rystedt, H.; Creutzfeldt, J.; Meurling, L.; Nyström, S.; Dahlberg, J.; Edelbring, S.; Amorøe, T.N.; Hult, H.; Felländer-Tsai, L.; et al.

Nutritional impact symptoms were examined with two modified and content validated questionnaires, the eating symptom questionnaire (ESQ-burn), and disease-related appetite questionnaire (DRAQ-burn). Information on the burn injury and medical treatment including nutritional treatment and patients´ demographics were collected.\n\nResults: A total of 18 patients were recruited for the study. The mean age was 58.0 (SD 18.7) years, 10 male (56%) and 8 women (44%). The mean total burn surface area was 8.6% (SD 9.6) Six months after injury, the mean body weight change was +0.8 kg (SD 4.2). during the first two weeks post burn injury, nutritional treatment with parenteral nutrition (n = 2, 11%), enteral nutrition (n = 2, 11%), oral nutritional supplements (n = 9, 50%), and protein enrichment (n = 3, 17%) had been provided to participants. In total, 9 of the participants (50%) had contact with a dietitian after injury.\n\nIn ESQ, the majority of patients (n = 11, 61%) reported 1–4 mild to moderate symptoms of NIS, where “tiredness/fatigue affecting appetite” were the most commonly reported NIS (n = 7, 39%), followed by “pain or ache affecting my appetite” (n = 6, 33%), and thereafter “nausea” (n = 5, 28%) and “tiredness/fatigue preventing me from eating” (n = 5, 28%).\n\nIn DRAQ, some patients reported that the injury had affected their appetite (n = 6, 33%), and that they never or rarely felt hungry (n = 5, 28%). Some participants depended on someone else to prepare their meals because of the burn injury (n = 5, 28%).\n\nConclusions: We need to pay attention to NIS during follow-ups post burn injury. Considering that participants in this study have minor burns, surprisingly, many have reported nutritional impact symptoms 6 months after injury. If and how this effects nutritional intake and status and frequency of NIS after major burns warrants further investigation.\n\nO.014\n\nDo We Apply the Appropriate Measures to Prevent and Treat Delirium in Severely Burned Patients? Review of Actions Carried out by Nursing Staff to the Management of Delirium\n\nPol Miguel Puigbarraca, Marisa Pérez del Prado, Laura Garcia Gómez and Mònica Soler Rovira\n\nVall d’Hebron Hospital\n\nObjective: To carry out a bibliographic review on nursing measures applied in critical units to prevent and treat delirium and check if these are applied at Vall d’Hebron’s Burns Unit in Barcelona.\n\nMethod: Through a bibliographic review of quantitative and qualitative articles and systematic reviews to the last 5 years where strategies developed by nursing staff to the optimal management of delirium in patients older than 18 years in burn units and critical patient units are described.\n\nResults: The consulted bibliography identifies that the following strategies are the most accepted to prevent and treat delirium: assessment and stimulation of cognitive status, promotion of early mobilization, adaptation of audition and vision, promotion of night rest, maintenance of hydration and review of medication.\n\nConclusions: Generally, all the measures to prevent and treat delirium found in the bibliography consulted are applied by the nursing staff at Vall d’Hebron’s Burns Unit. Even so, there is currently no protocol at this unit to the standardization and register of these actions, a fact that would facilitate the early detection and treatment of this syndrome.\n\nO.015\n\nHigh-Voltage Electrical Injury: A 4-Year Retrospective Analysis of 145 Cases at a Burn Center in Tunisia\n\nAmel Mokline, Hana Fredj, Houdeifa Hermassi, Wala Brahmi, Manel Ben Saad, Bahija Gasri, Imen Jemi and Amen Allah Messadi\n\nIntensive Burn Care Department, Tunis, Tunisia\n\nObjective: High-voltage electrical (HVE) injuries cause significant morbidity and mortality despite relatively small burn sizes.\n\nThe objective of our study was to evaluate epidemiological profile, clinical data, and outcomes of electrical injuries at a major burn center in Tunisia.\n\nMethods: Retrospective descriptive study enrolled consecutive High-voltage electrical burn patients admitted to the burn center in Tunisia between March 2017 to December 2021.\n\nResults: during the study period, 1918 patients were admitted, among which 182 were victims of HVE injuries (9%). In total, 145 were included. The age of patients was 35 ± 12 years with a masculine predominance (97%). In our series, 15% were children (n = 21). Most burns occurred in industrial workers and electricians at work (67% of cases (n = 96), followed by or householders at home (25.4%). TBSA was 18 ± 1%. Rhabdomyolysis was noted in 87% of cases, with a level of CPK at 18243 U/L. Acute renal failure occurred in 13% of cases. Myocardial injury occurred in 100 patients (68%). Electrocardiogram was performed in half of the patients. Abnormalities were noted in 68 of cases: Sinus tachycardia (36%, n = 28) and atrial fibrillation de novo occurred in 2 cases. Compartment syndrome was noted in 35 patients (24%) requiring escharotomy. Excision of necrotic tissues was done in 40% of cases. Amputations were performed in 25% of cases. Venous thromboembolic complication was observed in 15% of cases. Sepsis occurred in 68 patients (46%). The average ICU stay of patients was 22 ± 3 days. Mortality was 17% (n = 25) due, essentially, to refractory septic shock.\n\nConclusions: High-voltage injuries were associated with more extensive burns, longer ICU stays, and more complications and amputations.\n\nO.016\n\nDoes Optimizing Prophylactic Anticoagulation in Burns Reduce Venous Thromboembolism Complications?\n\nAmel Mokline, Racha Ghabara, Hana Fredj, Manel Ben Saad, Imen Jemi, Bahija Gasri, Hana Ben Ali and Amen Allah Messadi\n\nIntensive Burn Care Department, Tunis, Tunisia\n\nObjective: Assess the impact of optimizing prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin in burn patients on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE).\n\nMethods: Prospective, evaluative, case–control study conducted in intensive burn care department in Tunisia for 24 months, (February 2018–February 2020). Patients were divided into two groups according to the prophylactic anticoagulation modalities:\n\n−\n\nG1 (Equation) receiving enoxaparin en mg/12H = 22.8 + (3.3 ×% SCB/10) + (1.89 × (weight in kg)/10));\n\n−\n\nG2 (No equation) receiving enoxaparin at a single dose of 1 mg/weight.\n\nThe goal of prophylactic antifactor Xa level was 0.2–0.4 IU/mL.\n\nResults: during the study period, 216 patients were included, divided into two groups: G1 (n = 108) et G2 (n = 108). The groups were comparable in terms of sex, age, weight, burned skin surface and VTE risk. Additionally, severity of the 2 groups was comparable regarding: smoke inhalation (p = 0.46), use of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.22), use of catecholamines within 48 h (p = 0.56) and rescue incision (p = 0.77). In the equation group, initial dose of enoxaparin was 0.42 ± 0.12 mg. Target anti Xa was reached at the 1st dosage in 55 patients 55 (50.9%). The median final dose of enoxaparin required to reach the anti Xa target was 52 mg every 12 h (range, 35–69 mg). No episodes of bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or heparin allergy were documented in either group.\n\nThe incidence of VTE complications was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (9% versus 4%; p = 0.001 with an OR = 1.6 and CI [0.47–1.03]). The length of ICU stay was longer for G2 with a significant difference (30 days vs. 22 days; p = 0.001). Mortality was the same for the two groups.\n\nConclusions: Optimizing thromboprophylaxis in severely burned patients with enoxaparin, using the enoxaparin dosing equation, allows to achieve prophylactic anti-Xa level and to reduce risk of VTE complications.\n\nO.017\n\nVasoactive and/or Inotropic Drugs in Initial Resuscitation of Burn Injuries: A Systematic Review\n\nKristine Knappskog 1,2, Nina Gjerde Andersen 3, Anne Berit Guttormsen 1,4, Henning Onarheim 1,4, Stian Kreken Almeland 1,2 and Sigrid Beitland 5\n\n1\n\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen\n\n2\n\nDepartment of Plastic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery, Norwegian National Burn Center, Haukeland University Hospital\n\n3\n\nDepartment of Anaesthesiology, Division of Emergencies and Critical Care, Oslo University Hospital\n\n4\n\nDepartment of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Haukeland University Hospital\n\n5\n\nSpecialised Health Care services, Quality and Clinical Pathways, Norwegian Directorate of Health\n\nObjectives: According to current guidelines, initial burn resuscitation should be performed with fluids alone. The aims of the study were to review the frequency of use of vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs in initial burn resuscitation and to assess the benefits and harms of adding such drugs to fluids.\n\nMethods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, UpToDate, and SveMed+ through 3 December 2021. The search included studies on critically ill burn patients receiving vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs in addition to fluids within 48 h after burn injury.\n\nResults: The literature search identified 1058 unique publications that were screened for inclusion. after assessing 115 publications in full text, only two retrospective cohort studies were included. One study found that 16 out of 52 (31%) patients received vasopressor(s). Factors associated with vasopressor use were increasing age, burn depth and% total body surface area (TBSA) burned. Another study observed that 20 out of 111 (18%) patients received vasopressor(s). Vasopressor use was associated with increasing age, Baux score and%TBSA burned in addition to more frequent dialysis treatment and increased mortality. Study quality assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was considered good in one study, but uncertain due to the limited description of methods in the other.\n\nConclusions: This systematic review revealed that there is a lack of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of using vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs in addition to fluids during early resuscitation of patients with major burns. There is a need for more data to decide whether vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs should be added to fluids or not. There seems to be a discrepancy between treatment guidelines suggesting use of fluid alone, and clinical practice studied in surveys indicating that vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs are frequently used.\n\nO.018\n\nUtility of Partial Pressure of Venous to Arterial Carbon Dioxide Gradient: Guide and Prognostic Value in Critically Burn Patients\n\nJavier Vejo Gutiérrez, Manuel Sánchez Sánchez, Irene Seises García, Alba López Fernández, Jesús Soto Gómez-Cambronero, Raquel Yébenes Calvo, Javier Rábano Alonso, Eva María Flores Cabeza, Pablo Millán Estañ and Carola Gutiérrez Melón\n\nHospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain\n\nObjectives: The aim of this study is to analyse the relation between hemodynamic parameters and analytic indicators of hypoperfusion such as Pv-aCO2 gap and lactate during early resuscitation in severely burn patients and to analyse its correlation with severity scores in order to evaluate its prognostic value according to standardized severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA score).\n\nMethods: We did a prospective observation in patients admitted to the Burn Intensive Care Unit from June 2018 to May 2021 with more than 30% of total body surface area (TBSA) burned. Pv-aCO2, lactate levels and hemodynamic measurements were performed during the period of admission and at least for 72 h during the initial resuscitation. APACHE II score was registered as well as SOFA score at the moment of admission and at h 24, 48 and 72 since burning time. We considered statistical significance with p < 0.05 and used Spearman’s test, simple regression, and Kruskal–Wallis test.\n\nResults: In the study period, a number of 27 patients were recruited, 23 of whom (83.2%) were men and 4 (14.8%) women. Mean age was 51 ± 16 years and TBSA 41.81 ± 18%. The main burning mechanism was flame (85%), and the mean Baux index was 92 ± 20. Mean Pv-aCO2 at h 12 and 16 were 12 ± 10 and 9 ± 5, respectively, and those were statistically different with mean Pv-aCO2 at hour 36 (7.6 ± 12). The correlation between cardiac index and lactate levels was r = −0.42 (p = <0.001) and between cardiac index and Pv-aCO2 was r = −0.32 (p = <0.001). Regarding severity scores, the correlation between Pv-aCO2 with Baux index, APACHE II and SOFA scores at h 24, 48 and 72 was not significant, whereas there is a tendency in correlation between Pv-aCO2 and SOFA scores at admission (r = 0.4.4, p = 0.1).\n\nConclusions: The Pv-aCO2 gap is modified in the early resuscitation of severely burn patients. Hemodynamic situation of this group of patients may be evaluated indistinctly with lactate levels or Pv-aCO2 gap because of their good correlation with the cardiac index in early resuscitation. The Pv-aCO2 gap shows scarce correlation with the SOFA score at admission. However, it is not a good severity indicator at admission, and it cannot be used as a prognostic value because of the lack of correlation with standardised severity scores.\n\nO.019\n\nInitial Albuminemia and Albumin Administration in Severely Burned Patients: Do They Matter?\n\nChristoph Ils 1, Mette M. Berger 2, Anthony De Buys Roessingh 1,3, Christelle Jung 3, Dan Carel 2 and Olivier Pantet 1,2\n\n1\n\nUniversity of Lausanne\n\n2\n\nService of Intensive Care Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital\n\n3\n\nChildren and Adolescent Surgery Service, Lausanne University Hospital\n\nObjectives: during burn shock, the early use of albumin has always been debated. We hypothesized that early hypoalbuminemia was an independent risk factor for mortality and that early albumin administration was associated with a decrease in mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis and fluid requirements.\n\nMethods: This was a retrospective, single-center study conducted in the burn intensive care unit of Lausanne University Hospital between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2018. The inclusion criteria were age ≥14 years and burns >20% total body surface area (TBSA). The exclusion criteria were admission >8h after burn accident, transfer in the first week to another burn unit or withdrawal of therapy during the first 72h. Data were presented as median (IQR) or number (%).\n\nResults: In total, 141 patients were included, with burns 35% (24% to 50%) TBSA, age 39 (26–56) years, 68.1% were male and 56.7% had inhalation injuries. The ABSI score was 8 (7–10). In total, 17 (12%) patients died. Minimal albuminemia in the first 24h was lower in non-survivors (15 (14–20) vs. 24 (19–31) g/L; p < 0.001) and was found to be an independent risk factor for mortality when adjusted for ABSI (p < 0.001) with a best cut-off of 22 g/L to predict mortality (sensitivity 63.6%; specificity 87.5%). In univariate analysis, albumin 20% was administered more often to non-survivors (12 (71%) vs. 30 (24%); p < 0.001), in increased quantities (47 (25–58) vs. 30 (10–40) g; p = 0.030) and earlier (9 (5–13) vs. 18 (14–20) h; p < 0.001). AKI was more frequent in albumin recipients (29 (69%) vs. 33 (33%); p < 0.001). The logistic regression model adjusted for ABSI found that albumin administration increased the risk of developing AKI in the first 7 days (OR 1.03 (95% CI 1.00–1.05); p = 0.035), without any significant effect on mortality or fluid requirements. Increased quantities of albumin administered in the first 7 days were associated with higher cumulated fluid balance, even after adjustment for TBSA.\n\nConclusions: Hypoalbuminemia <22 g/L in the first 24h was found to be an independent risk factor for mortality. Albumin administration was associated with an increase in AKI, without significant reduction in fluid requirement at 24h, but with an increase in fluid balance on day 7. Our study was underpowered to draw conclusions on mortality and dialysis. In the absence of a prospective study clearly demonstrating a benefit of albumin, its use should remain confined to extreme hypoalbuminemia\n\nO.020\n\nBurns Mortality Prediction Models Comparative Study in a Portuguese Burn Centre: 5-Year Study\n\nGonçalo Ferreira, José Miguel Azevedo, Dr. Dmitry Shelepenko, Inês Catalão and Luís Cabral\n\nPlastic, Reconstructive Surgery and Burns Unit Department, Coimbra Hospital and University Centre\n\nObjectives: This study aims to evaluate and compare different validated mortality prediction models performance in our burns unit (BU) and compare survivors’ and non-survivors’ associated characteristics.\n\nMethods: We have conducted a retrospective study of adult burn patients admitted to our BU between 2017 and 2021 (5-year period). Polytraumatized and toxic epidermal necrolysis patients were excluded. Mortality was assessed. Survivors’ and non-survivors’ clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed. The four models included were the Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI), Belgian Outcome in Burn Injury (BOBI), revised Baux and Ryan model. Predicted and observed mortality were compared with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the models’ goodness-of-fit, receiver operating curves (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) for discriminative performance evaluation.\n\nResults: A total of 641 patients were included and 58,2% were male. Patients’ median age was 62 years and the median total burned surface area (TBSA) was 8%. Third-degree burns were present in 71% and inhalation injury in 12.3%. The observed mortality rate was 9.4% (n = 60). Non-survivors were significantly older (73 vs. 60 years; p < 0.001), had a larger TBSA (27.75 vs. 7%; p < 0.001), higher frequency of third-degree burns (96.7 vs. 68.3%; p < 0.001) and inhalation injury (31.7% vs. 10.3%; p < 0.001), but no significant difference in gender. All models showed adequate goodness of fit with p-values >0.05 in the Hosmer–Lemeshow test assessment. Revised Baux (AUC 0.870 ± 0.025), ABSI (AUC 0.850 ± 0.026) and BOBI (AUC 0.831 ± 0.026) have demonstrated good discriminative power, and the Ryan model (0.774 ± 0.030) was only moderate.\n\nConclusions: The four scoring models revealed proper predictive performance, with revised Baux presenting as the most accurate model for mortality prediction. Their use in the BU represents a practical and valuable tool for risk stratification, treatment appropriateness and improve the quality control of burn care.\n\nO.021\n\nAcute Kidney Injury in Septic Burn Patients: Incidence and Outcome\n\nEirini Nikolaidou 1, Theodora Ligomenou 1, Argyro Pipinia 1, Zoi Tzimorota 1, Sophia Papadopoulou 1, Athina Lavrentieva 2 and Militsa Bitzani 2\n\n1\n\nPlastic Surgery Department and Burn ICU, Papanikolaou Hospital\n\n2\n\nA-ICU, Burn ICU, Papanikolaou Hospital\n\nIntroduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in burn patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Sepsis-Associated AKI (SA-AKI) account for the majority of cases of AKI in the ICU with poor prognosis. Our primary aim was to review the incidence and outcome of AKI in septic burn patients admitted to the Burn ICU.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Design, setting, and patients: Observational study of burn patients who were admitted to a Burn ICU and fulfilled the criteria for sepsis and AKI. Main outcome measures: Occurrence of acute kidney injury, factors contributing to etiology, illness severity, treatment, need for renal support after hospital discharge, and hospital mortality.\n\nResults: of the critically ill burn patients admitted during the study period, 33 (5.7%) had septic complications during their ICU stay, including 18 who were diagnosed with acute kidney injury according to the KDIGO criteria (stage 1—5 patients, stage 2—8 patients, stage 3–5 patients). Patients with AKI had higher severity of burn injury and higher incidence of inhalation injury (Abbreviated Burn Severity Index—9.2 ± 1.9 vs. 7.8 ± 2, and Total Burned Surface Area—39.5 ± 16 vs. 27.6 ± 13, inhalation injury—38.9% vs. 14.3%), p < 0.05. The most common contributing factor to AKI was septic shock (72.2%; 95% CI, 69.9–76.5%). Dialysis dependence at hospital discharge was 3% (1 patient) for survivors. Overall hospital mortality was 42%. Septic burn patients with AKI diagnosis had a higher mortality rate in comparison to non-AKI septic patients (65.6%vs. 21.4%). Independent risk factors for hospital mortality included the use of two or more vasopressors (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% CI, 1.50–2.55; p < 0.001), presence of AKI (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.73–2.14; p < 0.001) and septic shock (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.02–1.81; p < 0.01).\n\nConclusions: High incidence of AKI was observed in Burn ICU patients with septic complications. The diagnosis of acute kidney injury in septic burn patients was associated with a high hospital mortality rate.\n\nO.022\n\nQuality of Burn Care from the Patients’ Perspective: Relevance of Outcomes and Quality Indicators\n\nC.

Part of this project is the re-design of already existing data registries on patient and injury characteristics and clinical processes (Dutch Burn Repository R3) and patient-reported outcomes (Burn Centre Outcomes Registry, The Netherlands). The objective of the study presented here was to obtain the perspective from a representative group of patients on the relevance and importance of outcomes and quality indicators. This information will ultimately be used to aid a Delphi consensus procedure in which a ‘core set’ of items to be included in the VBHC framework will be established.\n\nMethods: This study consisted of a patient survey and two patient focus groups. The (online) survey, available in Dutch and English, contains open-ended questions about outcomes after a burn injury, as well as questions on the importance of specific items based on the International Classification of Functioning. It has been sent out, both digitally and on paper, to 500 burn patients that were treated in a burn centre in The Netherlands in the past 3 to 36 months. for patients with a low level of health literacy or whom are of non-Western culture with a language barrier, interviews using the same survey were conducted. In the two focus groups, each including 3–7 patients, all relevant aspects regarding outcomes and quality indicators during the complete patient journey were discussed and documented.\n\nResults: Preliminary results of 136 patients that completed the questionnaire show that ‘wound healing’ (together with infection and wound care), ‘independence’ and ‘sleep quality’ were the most important outcomes: these were rated as ‘very important’ by >60% of participants. Full results are scheduled to be obtained by the end of May, and ready to be presented at the Congress in September.\n\nConclusions: This study provides insight into the relevance and importance of outcomes and quality indicators from a patient perspective. This information will be used in the consensus procedure to establish a VBHC ‘core set’, which will be used to improve quality of burn care and to inform patients on expected outcomes. The VBHC framework will support ongoing innovation and improvements in line with our mission to achieve the best possible autonomy and reintegration into daily life for every burn patient.\n\nO.023\n\nBurn Centres Outcomes Registry in The Netherlands (BORN): First Results of Implementation\n\nMargriet Van Baar 1,2, D.

To this end, insight into patients’ values is of utmost importance. A first step is to assess patients’ values, using patient-reported outcomes. The three Dutch burn centres introduced patient reported outcome measures (PROMS) in specialized burn care for adults in 2018. The Burns Centres’ Outcomes Registry in The Netherlands (BORN) routinely collects outcomes of care relevant to the patient, using a state-of-the-art electronic measurement system including real-time feedback for both patient and practitioner.\n\nIn this study, we evaluated the response, predictors of response, and outcome levels.\n\nMethods: A prospective cohort study was conducted. All adults after an admission to specialized burn care in The Netherlands in 2018–2019 were eligible. We collected and analysed data on response (i.e., reasons for non-inclusion, percentage of participating patients), predictors of response (e.g., patient and burn characteristics), and one of the five routinely collected PROMS; general health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured with the EuroQol-5D.\n\nResults: Preliminary data show that approximately half of the adults discharged from specialized burn care was registered in the BORN system. Important reasons to refrain from participation were mental health issues (21%), language problems (19%), and refusal (19%). Response rates of the first questionnaire, at discharge, ranged between 40 and 80%. Participation dropped slowly to one-year post-discharge. Participants who survived major burns more often completed the one-year follow-up. Age and length of stay were not associated with this response.\n\nQuality of life data showed that the majority of the patients return to pre-injury levels in most HRQOL domains, except on activities of daily living and anxiety and depression.\n\nConclusions: PROMs are an essential part of person-centred care. BORN response rates dropped slowly over time, and could only partly be predicted by patient or injury characteristics. Response rate seems to be strongly associated with the use in clinical practice. We hypothesize that the use of the PROMS in the consultation room is of major importance in response rates to PROMS. Feedback from the start onwards, also by means of an optimal dashboard, can support the use of individual results in clinical processes for goal setting, shared decision-making, and treatment evaluation.\n\nO.024\n\nAnalysis of Factors Affecting Burns Mortality: A National Burn Centre Experience from Pakistan 2007–2021\n\nMuhammad Rehan, Tariq Iqbal, Mehwish Sarwar, Muhammad Shais Khan, Muhammad Hassaan Khan, Usman Waheed\n\nBurn Care Centre, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University\n\nObjectives: Mortality rates are significant outcome parameters after a burn injury. The objective of the current study was to analyze the characteristics of the patients admitted to our burn care centre and identify the factors associated with mortality in the burn.\n\nMethodology: This was a cross-sectional single-centre study involving a retrospective analysis of mortality rates in burn patients over a period of 15 years from January 2007 to December 2021. during the study period, 7866 burn patients were admitted to the ICU of the burn care centre. Data were acquired at the time of admission and were logged prospectively during the course of the hospital stay. The patients were followed until discharge or death.\n\nResults: during the reporting period of 2007–2021, 7866 patients were registered in the current study with the majority of them being males (64.09%). The mortality rate was calculated as 23.16% (1822/7866). The patients who died were mostly males (64.33%) and were considerably younger (mean death age 14.34 years). The majority of the patients (both groups) had a total body surface area (TBSA) of > 60%, mostly with inhalation injury. The TBSA was statistically associated with burn mortality. The average duration of stay at the burn care centre was 15.5 days for the survivors’ group (Group 2), whereas it was 11.4 days for the patients who died (Group 1) during the course of their treatment. The degree of burn had a positive correlation with mortality (p = 0.001). A rise in the burn degree from second- to third-degree significantly increased the risk of death.\n\nConclusions: About 23.16% of all admitted patients died mostly from flame burns and sepsis as the most common cause of death. Increased burned TBSA, younger age, and inhalation injury worsened the prognosis.\n\nApplicability of clinical practice: The causes of mortality after burn injury change over time and data need to be updated for informed decision-making.\n\nO.025\n\nMultinational Analysis of the Treatment of Burn Patients in Africa—Infrastructure, Challenges and Solutions\n\nJulia Elrod, Judith Lindert, Dorothy Bbaale, Shobha Chamania and Christoph Mohr\n\nUniversity Medical Center Mannheim, Heidelberg University\n\nObjectives: Burns remain a serious public health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Socioeconomic status and health systems with limited resources impede high-quality surgical care. The objective of this study was to systematically collect data on the health care of burned patients on the African continent as a basis for improving burn care.\n\nMethods: An online survey covering the topics of the current health care situation, available infrastructure, human resources, perceived challenges and solutions for improvement of the treatment of thermal injuries was created. It was distributed in English and French with snowball methods via online platforms, social media, distribution lists and by email. Descriptive statistics were performed; in addition, the AI-based random for est was applied to identify determinants for a reduction in the reported mortality rate.\n\nResults: In total, 271 evaluable questionnaires from 237 cities in 40 African countries were analysed. Overall, 81.9% originated from countries with a very low Human Development Index (HDI) (4th quartile). The majority of all responses were from tertiary health care facilities. In only 18.8% of respondents, therapy was free of charge for the patients. A separate burn ward was available in 34.7% of all institutions and an intensive care unit for burn patients was available in 21.0%. Regular skin grafts were performed in a minority of all centers only. Mortality varied significantly between centers. Random-forest-based analysis revealed a close association between HDI (feature importance: 0.38) and mortality. The most important reason for poor outcome was perceived to be late presentation due to prior treatment by a traditional healer. The greatest perceived potential for improvement was introduction of an intensive care unit, followed by improved prevention or education of the population.\n\nConclusions: This study provides an ample overview of the current state of care for burned patients on the African continent. A variety of factors, including a low HDI, delayed hospital presentation, e.g., due to prior care by non-physicians and lack of equipment seem to worsen the outcome. Introduction of an intensive care unit and communal education are perceived to be important steps in improving health care in burns.\n\nO.026\n\nEpidemiology of Burns in Latin America: Do We Need a Regional Burn Registry?\n\nOrlando Flores, Jorge Rojas and Rodrigo Fuentes\n\nCOANIQUEM\n\nObjectives: Burn injuries cause important loss to health status globally. Despite being considered clinically relevant in Latin America, there is not a systematic registry for epidemiological and clinical data in the region. The aim of this study is to (a) analyse the quantity and quality of reported epidemiological and clinical data on burn injuries across L"
