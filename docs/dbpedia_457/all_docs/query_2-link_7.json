New therapeutic approaches with better cytoreductive capacity are needed for relapsed patients to keep their chance for cure with transplantation. We report 30 patients with relapsed lymphoma, median age 43 years, treated with IIVP salvage regimen consisting of ifosfamide, mesna, idarubicin, and etoposide for 2 or 3 cycles. Seventeen patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 13 patients had Hodgkin disease (HD). Fourteen (47%) patients were at their first relapse. Overall response rate was 86.6% (n = 26) with 19 patients (63.3%) achieving complete response. Overall response rate was 92% in patients with HD and 82% in NHL. The most frequent side effects observed were grade III-IV neutropenia (87%) and thrombocytopenia (73%). IIVP regimen is a highly effective salvage therapy for patients with relapsed HD or NHL who are candidates for autologous HSCT. Close follow up is necessary because of the high incidence of grade III-IV hematologic toxicity.\n\nDelay discounting rates: a strong prognostic indicator of smoking relapse.\n\nPubMed\n\nSheffer, Christine E; Christensen, Darren R; Landes, Reid; Carter, Larry P; Jackson, Lisa; Bickel, Warren K\n\n2014-11-01\n\nRecent evidence suggests that several dimensions of impulsivity and locus of control are likely to be significant prognostic indicators of relapse. One-hundred and thirty-one treatment seeking smokers were enrolled in six weeks of multi-component cognitive-behavioral therapy with eight weeks of nicotine replacement therapy. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to model days to relapse with each of the following: delay discounting of $100, delay discounting of $1000, six subscales of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Rotter's Locus of Control (RLOC), Fagerstrom's Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Hazard ratios for a one standard deviation increase were estimated with 95% confidence intervals for each explanatory variable. Likelihood ratios were used to examine the level of association with days to relapse for different combinations of the explanatory variables while accounting for nicotine dependence and stress level. These analyses found that the $100 delay discounting rate had the strongest association with days to relapse. Further, when discounting rates were combined with the FTND and PSS, the associations remained significant. When the other measures were combined with the FTND and PSS, their associations with relapse non-significant. These findings indicate that delay discounting is independently associated with relapse and adds to what is already accounted for by nicotine dependence and stress level. They also signify that delay discounting is a productive new target for enhancing treatment for tobacco dependence. Consequently, adding an intervention designed to decrease discounting rates to a comprehensive treatment for tobacco dependence has the potential to decrease relapse rates.

Retrospective case series. Data of 22 pediatric JIA patients who were being treated with MTX for active uveitis were studied retrospectively. Relapse rate after the withdrawal of MTX was established. Anterior chamber (AC) inflammation, topical steroid use during the first year of MTX treatment, and associations of relapses after the withdrawal were evaluated statistically. Duration of MTX treatment and its withdrawal was determined individually in collaboration with a rheumatologist with an intention to continue the treatment for at least 1 year and to withdraw in case of inactivity of uveitis and arthritis. Inactivity of uveitis was defined as the presence of â¤0.5+ cells in the AC. Eighteen patients (18/22; 82%) showed improvement of their uveitis with a significant decrease in activity of AC inflammation after a minimal period of 3 months of MTX treatment. A topical steroid-sparing effect was observed when MTX was administered for a period of 3 to 9 months. MTX was discontinued because of inactive uveitis in 13 patients. In 9 patients (8/13; 69%) a relapse of uveitis was observed after a mean time of 7.5 months (Â± SD 7.3). Six patients (6/13; 46%) had a relapse within the first year after the withdrawal. Relapse-free survival after withdrawal of MTX was significantly longer in patients who had been treated with MTX for more than 3 years (P = .009), children who were older than 8 years at the moment of withdrawal (P = .003), and patients who had an inactivity of uveitis of longer than 2 years before withdrawal of MTX (P = .033). Longer inactivity under MTX therapy was independently protective for relapses after the withdrawal (hazard ratio = 0.07; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.86; P = .038), which means that 1-year increase of duration of inactive uveitis before the withdrawal of MTX results in a\n\nComparably high retention and low relapse rates in different subpopulations of bipolar patients in a German non-interventional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKraemer, Susanne; Minarzyk, Anette; Eppendorfer, Steffen; Henneges, Carsten; Hundemer, Hans-Peter; Wilhelm, Stefan; Grunze, Heinz\n\n2013-07-17\n\nAlthough a range of pharmacotherapeutical options are available for the treatment of bipolar disorder, patient non-adherence to prescribed treatment regimens and early treatment discontinuation remain among the primary obstacles to effective treatment. Therefore, this observational study assessed time on mood stabilizing medication and retention rates in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In an 18-month, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study conducted in Germany 761 outpatients (â¥18 years) with BD and on maintenance therapy were documented. For analysis, patients were stratified by baseline medication: monotherapy olanzapine (OM, Nâ=â186), lithium (LM, Nâ=â152), anticonvulsants (Nâ=â216), other mood stabilizing medication (OMS, Nâ=â44); combination therapy olanzapine/lithium (Nâ=â47), olanzapine/anticonvulsant (Nâ=â68), other combinations (OC, Nâ=â48). Continuation on medication was assessed as retention rates with 95% confidence intervals. Time to discontinuation and relapse-free time were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. A relapse was defined as increase to CGI-BP >3, worsening of CGI-BP by â¥2 points, hospitalization or death related to BD. A Cox regression was calculated for the discontinuation of mood stabilizing therapy (reference: OM). Logistic regression models with stepwise forward selection were used to explore possible predictors of maintenance of treatment and relapse. After 540Â days (18Â months), the overall retention rate of baseline medication was 87.7%, without notable differences between the cohorts. The overall mean time on mood stabilizing treatment was 444.7Â days, with a range of 377.5 (OMS) to 481 (LM) by cohort. 74.0% of all patients were without relapse, with rates between the cohorts ranging from 58.4% (OC) to 80.2% (LM). Retention rates exceeded controlled trial results in all treatment cohorts, in addition to other explanations possibly reflecting that the physicians were expertly\n\nA form of relapse prevention for men in a high security hospital.\n\nPubMed\n\nNewton, Liam; Coles, Dawn; Quayle, Marie\n\n2005-01-01\n\nMarlatt and Gordon's relapse prevention model has evolved, and been applied to many repetitive problem behaviours, including drug use, gambling and sexual offending. High security hospital patients often present with a number of such behaviours. To evaluate a relapse prevention group in one high security hospital. Nine patients were selected on clinical need for the group. In a naturalistic study design, each completed several self-report questionnaires pre- and post-group. Analysis of group results demonstrated a significant increase in guilt and acceptance of responsibility for offences (GBAI ratings), and reduced endorsement of pro-offending thinking styles (PICTS). Movement towards increased empathy, and decreased impulsivity and venturesomeness, did not reach significance. All participants showed some changes in desired directions but effects were small. Both relapse prevention and its evaluation are limited in high security hospitals by the restricted opportunities for testing out new skills. The feasibility of delivering an RP programme and evaluating it in high security has nevertheless been established. The small effects found may be promising, and suggest both justification and need for a randomized controlled trial of this approach in that setting.

Analysis of clinical outcomes from a prospective cohort of patients treated with LDR-PB alone or combined treatment in a single institution. Men with a high risk of disease relapse were identified by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria or by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria. Relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and metastases-free survival (MFS), were analysed together with patient-reported symptom scores and physician-reported adverse events. The NICE and NCCN criteria identified 267 and 202 high-risk patients, respectively. NICE-defined patients had significantly lower pre-treatment PSA levels, Gleason scores <7, and a greater proportion of patients who received LDR-PB monotherapy. At 9Â years after implantation RFS was 89% and 87% in the NICE and NCCN groups, respectively (log-rank P = 0.637), and OS 93% and 94%, respectively (log-rank P = 0.481). All of the survival estimates were similar between LDR-PB monotherapy and combined therapies. Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed RFS was similar between the treatment types. Treatment-related toxicity was also similar between the treatment methods. LDR-PB is effective at controlling localised prostate cancer in patients with a high risk of disease relapse. As the present study was not randomised, it is not possible to define those patients who need the addition of ADT and/or EBRT. However, the NICE criteria appear suitable to define treatment options where patients could benefit from LDR-PB as monotherapy or combined treatment. This choice should be discussed with the patient taking into account comorbidities and presence of multiple high-risk factors.

Daily administration of maintenance prednisolone during intercurrent infections was examined to determine whether the treatment reduces relapse rates in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. In a randomized controlled trial (nonblind, parallel group, tertiary-care hospital), 100 patients with idiopathic, frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome eligible for therapy with prolonged low-dose, alternate-day prednisolone with or without levamisole were randomized to either receive their usual dose of alternate-day prednisolone daily for 7 days during intercurrent infections (intervention group) or continue alternate-day prednisolone (controls). Primary outcome was assessed by comparing the rates of infection-associated relapses at 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the frequency of infections and the cumulative amount of prednisolone received in both groups. Patients in the intervention group showed significantly lower infection-associated (rate difference, 0.7 episodes/patient per year; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.3, 1.1) and lower total relapse rates (0.9 episodes/patient per year, 95% CI 0.4, 1.4) without increase in steroid toxicity. Poisson regression, adjusted for occurrence of infections, showed that daily administration of prednisolone during infections independently resulted in 59% reduction in frequency of relapses (rate ratio, 0.41; 95% CI 0.3, 0.6). For every six patients receiving this intervention, one showed a reduction of relapse frequency to less than three per year. Daily administration of maintenance doses of prednisolone, during intercurrent infections, significantly reduces relapse rates and the proportion of children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome.\n\nRates and predictors of relapse after natural and treated remission from alcohol use disorders\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoos, Rudolf H.; Moos, Bernice S.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAims This study examined the rates and predictors of 3-year remission, and subsequent 16-year relapse, among initially untreated individuals with alcohol use disorders who did not obtain help or who participated in treatment and/or Alcoholics Anonymous in the first year after recognizing their need for help. Design and measures A sample of individuals (n = 461) who initiated help-seeking was surveyed at baseline and 1 year, 3 years, 8 years and 16 years later. Participants provided information on their life history of drinking, alcohol-related functioning and life context and coping. Findings Compared to individuals who obtained help, those who did not were less likely to achieve 3-year remission and subsequently were more likely to relapse. Less alcohol consumption and fewer drinking problems, more self-efficacy and less reliance on avoidance coping at baseline predicted 3-year remission; this was especially true of individuals who remitted without help. Among individuals who were remitted at 3 years, those who consumed more alcohol but were less likely to see their drinking as a significant problem, had less self-efficacy, and relied more on avoidance coping, were more likely to relapse by 16 years. These findings held for individuals who initially obtained help and for those who did not. Conclusions Natural remission may be followed by a high likelihood of relapse; thus, preventive interventions may be indicated to forestall future alcohol problems among individuals who cut down temporarily on drinking on their own.

Little is known about what prompts renewed quitting after relapse or how often this results in abstinence. Purpose To identify rates, efficacy, and predictors of renewed quit attempts after relapse during a one-year follow-up. Methods Primary care patients in a comparative effectiveness trial of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies reported daily smoking every 6â12 weeks for 12 months to determine relapse, renewed quitting, and 12-month abstinence rates. Results Of 894 known relapsers, 291 (33%) renewed quitting for at least 24 hours and 99 (34%) of these were abstinent at follow-up. The average latency to renewed quitting was 106 days and longer latencies predicted greater success. Renewed quitting was more likely for older, male, less dependent smokers, and later abstinence was predicted by fewer depressive symptoms and longer past abstinence. Conclusions Renewed quitting is common and produces meaningful levels of cessation.

One of the prevalent problems among most addicted people is their low hope and relapse of drug dependence. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vocational consultation (for training on problem-solving skills) on hope and relapse rate of patients treated in methadone maintenance clinics. Methods This experiment was conducted on 60 drug abusers treated in a methadone maintenance program in drug addiction centers in Bojnurd, Iran, in 2014. The patients were randomly and equally allocated into two study and control groups. All patients completed the Miller Hope Questionnaire before and after the intervention. Ten sessions of vocational consultation were held for the study group while the control group received no special treatment. Patients were followed up on for relapses for six months. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16) and the paired-samples t-test technique. Results The results indicated that the mean and standard deviation of hope on the pre-test in the study group increased on the post-test (from M=175.5, SD=31.8, to M=198.5, SD=20.4), while in the control group the mean of hope decreased from the pre-test to past-test stage (M=184.7, SD=27.7, to M=183.3, SD=26.1), showing a significant relationship, t(56)= 5.657, p<0.05. The relapse rate was not significantly different in the two groups. Conclusion The vocational consultation positively affects hope among drug dependents but did not affect their relapse rate during the six-month follow-up. Increasing the hope in these groups of patients may be effective in other aspects of treatment success in long-term follow-up.

This article reviews the clinical factors associated with schizophrenia relapse. A research of the last 22 years of literature data was performed. Two-hundred nineteen studies have been included. Three main groups of factors are related to relapse: factors associated with pharmacological treatment, add-on psychotherapeutic treatments and general risk factors. Overall, the absence of a maintenance therapy and treatment with first generation antipsychotics has been associated with higher risk of relapse. Further, psychotherapy add-on, particularly with cognitive behaviour therapy and psycho-education for both patients and relatives, has shown a good efficacy for reducing the relapse rate. Among general risk factors, some could be modified, such as the duration of untreated psychosis or the substance misuse, while others could not be modified as male gender or low pre-morbid level of functioning. Several classes of risk factors have been proved to be relevant in the risk of relapse. Thus, a careful assessment of the risk factors here identified should be performed in daily clinical practice in order to individualise the relapse risk for each patient and to provide a targeted treatment in high-risk subjects.\n\nAdjunct antibody administration with standard treatment reduces relapse rates in a murine tuberculosis model of necrotic granulomas.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrdonez, Alvaro A; Pokkali, Supriya; Kim, Sunhwa; Carr, Brian; Klunk, Mariah H; Tong, Leah; Saini, Vikram; Chang, Yong S; McKevitt, Matthew; Smith, Victoria; Gossage, David L; Jain, Sanjay K\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMatrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation. We evaluated whether adjunctive inhibition of MMP-9 could improve the response to standard TB treatment in a mouse model that develops necrotic lesions. Six weeks after an aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis, C3HeB/FeJ mice received standard TB treatment (12 weeks) comprising rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide alone or in combination with either anti-MMP-9 antibody, etanercept (positive control) or isotype antibody (negative control) for 6 weeks. Anti-MMP-9 and the isotype control had comparable high serum exposures and expected terminal half-life. The relapse rate in mice receiving standard TB treatment was 46.6%. Compared to the standard TB treatment, relapse rates in animals that received adjunctive treatments with anti-MMP-9 antibody or etanercept were significantly decreased to 25.9% (P = 0.006) and 29.8% (P = 0.019) respectively, but were not different from the arm that received the isotype control antibody (25.9%). Immunostaining demonstrated localization of MMP-9 primarily in macrophages in both murine and human lung tissues infected with M. tuberculosis, suggesting the importance of MMP-9 in TB pathogenesis. These data suggest that the relapse rates in M. tuberculosis-infected mice may be non-specifically improved by administration of antibodies in conjunction with standard TB treatments. Future studies are needed to evaluate the mechanism(s) leading to improved outcomes with adjunctive antibody treatments.\n\nAdjunct antibody administration with standard treatment reduces relapse rates in a murine tuberculosis model of necrotic granulomas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Sunhwa; Carr, Brian; Klunk, Mariah H.; Tong, Leah; Saini, Vikram; Chang, Yong S.; McKevitt, Matthew; Smith, Victoria; Gossage, David L.; Jain, Sanjay K.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMatrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a zinc-dependent protease associated with early immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, macrophage recruitment and granuloma formation.

Identifying patients at high risk of renal relapse may aid in optimizing clinical management. We investigated which clinical and histological parameters are risk factors for renal relapse in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (AAGN). Patients (n = 174) were newly diagnosed and had mild-moderate or severe renal involvement. Data were derived from two trials of the European Vasculitis Society: MEPEX and CYCAZAREM. The Cox regression model was used to identify parameters increasing the instantaneous risk (= rate) of renal relapse (useful for instant clinical decisions). For identifying predictors of renal relapse during follow-up, we used Fine & Gray's regression model. Competing events were end-stage renal failure and death. The cumulative incidence of renal relapse at 5 years was 9.5% (95% CI: 4.8-14.3%). In the Cox model, sclerotic class AAGN increased the instantaneous risk of renal relapse. In Fine & Gray's model, the absence of interstitial infiltrates at diagnosis was predictive for renal relapse. In this study we used two different models to identify possible relationships between clinical and histopathological parameters at time of diagnosis of AAV with the risk of experiencing renal relapse. Sclerotic class AAGN increased the instantaneous risk of renal relapse. This association is most likely due to the high proportion of sclerosed glomeruli reducing the compensatory capacity. The absence of interstitial infiltrates increased the risk of renal relapse which is a warning sign that patients with a relatively benign onset of disease may also be prone to renal relapse. Renal relapses occurring in patients with sclerotic class AAGN and renal relapses occurring in patients without interstitial infiltrates were mutually exclusive, which may indicate that they are essentially different.\n\nANCA-Associated Glomerulonephritis: Risk Factors for Renal Relapse\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGÃ¶Ã§eroÄlu, Arda; Berden, Annelies E.; Fiocco, Marta; FloÃmann, Oliver; Westman, Kerstin W.; Ferrario, Franco; Gaskin, Gill; Pusey, Charles D.; Hagen, E.

Out of 19,893 tuberculosis patients registered in 2007 in Japan, 7.48% were classified as relapse cases. Relapse cases have the risk of acquired drug resistance. But we have few analyses of the proportion of relapse tuberculosis cases with standard short course regimens for six months, factors contributing to tuberculosis relapse and the proportion of drug resistance among relapse TB cases in Japan. Therefore we analyzed the relapse tuberculosis cases in two rural areas and three urban areas. We also analyzed the proportion of drug resistance among relapse cases with the data of drug susceptibility survey of Ryoken. 1. Research of relapse tuberculosis cases: Makoto TOYOTA (Kochi City Public Health Center). To clarify the relapse rate and factors contributing to tuberculosis relapse, we investigated the relapse tuberculosis cases in the municipality where the proportion of elderly tuberculosis patients was high. Out of 902 tuberculosis patients registered in Kochi City Public Health Center during 10 years, 20 pulmonary tuberculosis patients were confirmed relapse cases with initial registered records. Pretreatment cavitations, sputum culture positivity at 2 months, medical miss-management (e.g. number of doses, duration of therapy) and poor adherence were considered to be factors contributing to tuberculosis relapse. Out of 20 relapse cases, 12 cases were detected with symptoms, while only 3 cases were detected by examination in law. 2. A clinical study on relapse cases of pulmonary tuberculosis: Shuichi TAKIKAWA (National Hospital Organization Nishibeppu National Hospital). The relapse of pulmonary tuberculosis was investigated. In the cases with a treatment history before short course chemotherapy, drug resistance rate was high, and thus it needs to be cautious of drug resistance at the time of the retreatment. In the cases with a treatment history of short course chemotherapy, relapse cases\n\nRegional homogeneity changes between heroin relapse and non-relapse patients under methadone maintenance treatment: a resting-state fMRI study.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Haifeng; Li, Wei; Li, Qiang; Chen, Jiajie; Zhu, Jia; Ye, Jianjun; Liu, Jierong; Li, Zhe; Li, Yongbin; Shi, Ming; Wang, Yarong; Wang, Wei\n\n2016-08-18\n\nMethadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is recognized as one of the most effective treatments for heroin addiction but its effect is dimmed by the high incidence of heroin relapse. However, underlying neurobiology mechanism of heroin relapse under MMT is still largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of a resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo), and tried to explore the difference of brain function between heroin relapsers and non-relapsers in MMT. Forty MMT patients were included and received a 12-month follow-up. All patients were given baseline resting-state fMRI scans by using a 3.0Â T GE Signa Excite HD whole-body MRI system. Monthly self-report and urine test were used to assess heroin relapse or non-relapse. Subjective craving was measured with visual analog scale. The correlation between ReHo and the degree of heroin relapse was analyzed. Compared with the non-relapsers, ReHo values were increased in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, right caudate, and right cerebellum of the heroin relapsers while those in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus were decreased in heroin relapsers. Importantly, altered ReHo in the right caudate were positively correlated with heroin relapse rates or subjective craving response. Using the resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of ReHo, we provided the first resting-state fMRI evidence that right caudate may serve as a potential biomarker for heroin relapse prediction and also as a promising target for reducing relapse risk.\n\nRelapse rates after two versus three consolidation courses of methotrexate in the treatment of low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.\n\nPubMed\n\nLybol, C; Sweep, F C G J; Harvey, R; Mitchell, H; Short, D; Thomas, C M G; Ottevanger, P B; Savage, P M; Massuger, L F A G; Seckl, M J\n\n2012-06-01\n\nMethotrexate (MTX) alternating with folinic acid is a commonly used treatment regimen for low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). In The Netherlands, two courses of MTX are administered after normalization of serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels (consolidation courses), whereas in the United Kingdom, three consolidation courses are given. In a retrospective setting we compared relapse rates of women completing MTX therapy for low-risk GTN in The Netherlands and the UK. From 1980 to 2008, 351 patients were collected from the Dutch Central Registry for Hydatidiform Moles and records from the Dutch Working Party on Trophoblastic Disease. From the Charing Cross Hospital Trophoblast Disease Centre (London), 600 low-risk GTN patients were identified from 1992 to 2008. In 4.0% of patients relapse occurred after MTX treatment with three consolidation courses, whereas 8.3% of patients relapsed after MTX treatment with two consolidation courses (p=0.006). Although patients from The Netherlands had a higher level of hCG (p<0.001) and more patients had metastases before the start of treatment (p=0.012), the number of courses of MTX to achieve a normal hCG did not differ significantly between patients from The Netherlands and the UK (p=0.375). Relapse rates were higher in patients treated with two consolidation courses of MTX. Although other factors might have influenced the observed difference in relapse rates, three courses of consolidation chemotherapy may be preferable to two in the treatment of low-risk GTN in order to decrease the risk of disease relapse. A prospective randomized study would be required to confirm these findings. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Tandem transplantation (TT) consisted in high dose melphalan (HDT) and auto-SCT followed by an (allo-SCT) preceded by two gray TBI non-myeloablative conditioning. All patients received a first HDT as frontline treatment. At day 100 post allo-SCT, complete donor chimerism was detected in 22 patients (95%). Acute GVHD was observed in 19 patients (15 grade I-II (65%) and 4 grade III-IV (17%)). Ten patients (43%) developed an extensive chronic GVHD. The non-relapse mortality at 1 year was 17%. After TT, the overall response rate was 91% (17% partial response, 35% very good partial remission and 39% complete remission). At 2 years, OS was 61%. Median event-free survival and OS were 36.8 and 60 months, respectively. Based on the propensity score matching method, a significant survival advantage could be seen in patients treated with TT as compared with non-allografted patients. Thus, allo-SCT, in TT approach, provides a high response rate with low toxicity and may improve survival of patients with relapsing MM.\n\nPerinatal Substance Use: A Prospective Evaluation of Abstinence and Relapse\n\nPubMed Central\n\nForray, Ariadna; Merry, Brian; Lin, Haiqun; Ruger, Jennifer Prah; Yonkers, Kimberly A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Substance use decreases in pregnancy but little prospective data are available on the rates of abstinence and relapse for specific substances. This study compared rates of abstinence in pregnancy and relapse postpartum for nicotine cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Methods Data from 152 women drawn from a randomized controlled trial comparing psychological treatments for substance use in pregnancy were analyzed. Self-reports of substance use and urine for toxicology testing throughout pregnancy and 3-months, 12-months and 24-months post-delivery were collected. Multivariate Cox models were used to compare rates of abstinence and relapse across substances. Results In pregnancy, 83% of all women achieved abstinence to at least one substance. The mean (SE) days to abstinence was 145.81 (9.17), 132.01 (6.17), 151.52 (6.24), and 148.91 (7.68) for cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine, respectively. Participants were more likely to achieve abstinence from alcohol (HR 7.24 (95% CI 4.47-11.72), marijuana (HR 4.06; 95% CI 1.87-6.22), and cocaine (HR 3.41; 95% CI 2.53-6.51), than cigarettes. Postpartum, 80% of women abstinent in the last month of pregnancy relapsed to at least one substance. The mean days to relapse was 109.67 (26.34), 127.73 (21.29), 138.35 (25.46), and 287.55 (95.85) for cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine, respectively. Relapse to cocaine was only 34% (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15-0.77) that of cigarettes. Conclusions Pregnancy-related abstinence rates were high for all substances except cigarettes. Postpartum relapse was common, with cocaine using women being less likely to relapse after attaining abstinence compared to women using cigarettes, alcohol or marijuana.

For alcohol, relapse rates were similar across gender. Although negative mood, childhood sexual abuse, alcohol-related self-efficacy, and poorer coping strategies predicted alcohol relapse, gender did not moderate these effects. Gender did moderate the association between marriage and alcohol relapse. For women, marriage and marital stress were risk factors for alcohol relapse; among men, marriage lowered relapse risk. This gender difference in the role of marriage in relapse may be a result of partner differences in problem drinking. Alcoholic women are more likely to be married to heavy drinking partners than are alcoholic men; thus, alcoholic women may be put at risk of relapse by marriage and alcoholic men may be protected by marriage. There are fewer studies documenting gender differences in substance abuse relapse so conclusions are limited and tentative. In contrast to the lack of gender differences in alcohol relapse rates, women appear less likely to experience relapse to substance use, relative to men. Women relapsing to substance use appear to be more sensitive to negative affect and interpersonal problems. Men, in contrast, may be more likely to have positive experiences prior to relapse.\n\nEnhancing Brain Lesions during Acute Optic Neuritis and/or Longitudinally Extensive Transverse Myelitis May Portend a Higher Relapse Rate in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrman, G; Wang, K Y; Pekcevik, Y; Thompson, C B; Mealy, M; Levy, M; Izbudak, I\n\n2017-05-01\n\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders are inflammatory demyelinating disorders with optic neuritis and/or longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis episodes. We now know that neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders are associated with antibodies to aquaporin-4, which are highly concentrated on astrocytic end-feet at the blood-brain barrier. Immune-mediated disruption of the blood-brain barrier may manifest as contrast enhancement on brain MR imaging. We aimed to delineate the extent and frequency of contrast enhancement on brain MR imaging within 1 month of optic neuritis and/or longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis attacks and to correlate contrast enhancement with outcome measures. Brain MRIs of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders were evaluated for patterns of contrast enhancement (periependymal, cloudlike, leptomeningeal, and so forth). The Fisher exact test was used to evaluate differences between the proportion of contrast enhancement in patients who were seropositive and seronegative for aquaporin-4 antibodies. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the annualized relapse rate and disease duration between patients with and without contrast enhancement and with and without seropositivity. Brain MRIs of 77 patients were evaluated; 59 patients (10 males, 49 females) were scanned within 1 month of optic neuritis and/or longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis attacks and were included in the analysis. Forty-eight patients were seropositive, 9 were seronegative, and 2 were not tested for aquaporin-4 antibodies. Having brain contrast enhancement of any type during an acute attack was significantly associated with higher annualized relapse rates ( P = .03) and marginally associated with shorter disease duration ( P = .05). Having periependymal contrast enhancement was significantly associated with higher annualized relapse rates ( P = .03). Brain MRIs of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders with contrast\n\nThe Alcohol Relapse Risk Assessment: a scoring system to predict the risk of relapse to any alcohol use after liver transplant.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigue, James R; Hanto, Douglas W; Curry, Michael P\n\n2013-12-01\n\nAlcohol relapse after liver transplant heightens concern about recurrent disease, nonadherence to the immunosuppression regimen, and death. To develop a scoring system to stratify risk of alcohol relapse after liver transplant. Retrospective medical record review. All adult liver transplants performed from May 2002 to February 2011 at a single center in the United States. The incidence of return to any alcohol consumption after liver transplant. Thirty-four percent (40/118) of patients with a history of alcohol abuse/dependency relapsed to use of any alcohol after liver transplant. Nine of 25 hypothesized risk factors were predictive of alcohol relapse after liver transplant: absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, tobacco dependence, continued alcohol use after liver disease diagnosis, low motivation for alcohol treatment, poor stress management skills, no rehabilitation relationship, limited social support, lack of nonmedical behavioral consequences, and continued engagement in social activities with alcohol present. Each independent predictor was assigned an Alcohol Relapse Risk Assessment (ARRA) risk value of 1 point, and patients were classified into 1 of 4 groups by ARRA score: ARRA I = 0, ARRA II = 1 to 3, ARRA III = 4 to 6, and ARRA IV = 7 to 9. Patients in the 2 higher ARRA classifications had significantly higher rates of alcohol relapse and were more likely to return to pretransplant levels of drinking. Alcohol relapse rates are moderately high after liver transplant. The ARRA is a valid and practical tool for identifying pretransplant patients with alcohol abuse or dependency at elevated risk of any alcohol use after liver transplant.\n\nRelapse following successful electroconvulsive therapy for major depression: a meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nJelovac, Ana; Kolshus, Erik; McLoughlin, Declan M\n\n2013-11-01\n\nHigh rates of early relapse following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are typically reported in the literature. Current treatment guidelines offer little information to clinicians on the optimal nature of maintenance therapy following ECT. The aim of this study was to provide a systematic overview of the existing evidence regarding post-ECT relapse. A keyword search of electronic databases was performed for studies appearing in the peer-reviewed literature before January 2013 reporting on relapse rates in responders to an acute course of ECT administered for a major depressive episode. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate. Thirty-two studies with up to 2 years' duration of follow-up were included. In modern era studies of continuation pharmacotherapy, 51.1% (95% CI=44.7-57.4%) of patients relapsed by 12 months following successful initial treatment with ECT, with the majority (37.7%, 95% CI=30.7-45.2%) relapsing within the first 6 months. The 6-month relapse rate was similar in patients treated with continuation ECT (37.2%, 95% CI=23.4-53.5%). In randomized controlled trials, antidepressant medication halved the risk of relapse compared with placebo in the first 6 months (risk ratio=0.49, 95% CI=0.39-0.62, p<0.0001, number needed to treat=3.3). Despite continuation therapy, the risk of relapse within the first year following ECT is substantial, with the period of greatest risk being the first 6 months. The largest evidence base for efficacy in post-ECT relapse prevention exists for tricyclic antidepressants. Published evidence is limited or non-existent for commonly used newer antidepressants or popular augmentation strategies. Maintenance of well-being following successful ECT needs to be improved.\n\nCytomegalovirus reactivation is associated with a lower rate of early relapse in myeloid malignancies independent of in-vivo T cell depletion strategy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHilal, Talal; Slone, Stacey; Peterson, Shawn; Bodine, Charles; Gul, Zartash\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe association between cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and relapse risk has not been evaluated in relation to T cell depletion strategies. We evaluated 93 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and analyzed the association between T cell depletion strategies with the cumulative incidence of relapse and CMV reactivation. A total of 33% of patients who received ATG vs. 34% who received alemtuzumab developed CMV reactivation. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 3% at 1year and 20% at 3 years in patients with CMV reactivation vs. 30% at 1year and 38% at 3 years in patients without CMV reactivation (p=0.02). When analyzed separately, this effect persisted in the myeloid, but not the lymphoid group. There was a numerical trend towards increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients with CMV reactivation, especially in the myeloid group. The choice of T cell depleting agent and the rate of CMV reactivation were not associated with different overall survival (OS) rates. These results suggest that the choice of T cell depletion strategy may have similar effects on rates of CMV reactivation, disease relapse, and survival. Further studies examining these variables in patients not exposed to in-vivo T cell depleting agents may be of interest. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We retrospectively evaluated the activity of gemcitabine (G) plus docetaxel (D) in patients with relapsed high-grade osteosarcoma and high-grade spindle cell sarcoma of bone (HGS). Patients receiving G 900 mg/m(2) d 1, 8; D 75 mg/m(2) d 8, every 21 days were eligible. Primary end-point: progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months; secondary end-point: overall survival (OS) and response rate. Fifty-one patients were included, with a median age of 17 years (8-71), 26 (51%) were pediatric patients. GD line of treatment: 2nd in 14 patients, â¥3rd in 37. 25 (49%) patients had metastases limited to lungs, 26 (51%) multiple sites. 40 (78%) osteosarcoma, 11 (22%) HGS. Eight (16%) patients achieved surgical complete response (sCR2) after GD. Four-month PFS rate was 46%, and significantly better for patients with ECOG 0 (ECOG 0: 54% vs ECOG 1: 43% vs ECOG 2: 0%; p = 0.003), for patients undergoing metastasectomy after GD (sCR2 75% vs no-sCR2 40 %, p = 0.02) and for osteosarcoma (osteosarcoma 56% vs HGS 18%; p = 0.05), with no differences according to age, line of treatment, and pattern of metastases. Forty-six cases had RECIST measurable disease: 6 (13%) patients had a partial response (PR), 20 (43%) had stable disease (SD) and 20 (43%) had progressive disease (PD). The 1-year OS was 30%: 67% for PR, 54% for SD and 20% for PD (p = 0.005). GD is an active treatment for relapsed high-grade osteosarcoma, especially for ECOG 0 patients, and should be included in the therapeutic armamentarium of metastatic osteosarcoma.\n\nTreatment of relapsed or refractory acute leukemia in childhood with bisantrene combined with high dose aracytine.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeblanc, T; DemÃ©ocq, F; Leverger, G; Baruchel, A; Lemerle, S; Vannier, J P; Nelken, B; Guillot, T; Schaison, G\n\n1994-01-01\n\nBisantrene is an anthracene derivative which has demonstrated activity in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and in lymphoma. The present study was designed to assess the reinduction rate and toxicity of bisantrene (250 mg/m2/d x 5) associated with aracytine (100 mg/m2 twice a day x 5) in refractory and relapsed acute childhood leukemia. Patients who relapsed after bone marrow transplantation were eligible. Twenty-six children were included. Diagnoses were as follows: 13 AML, 9 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 4 undifferentiated leukemia (AUL). All patients had been very highly pretreated, especially with anthracyclines, and most of them were of poor prognosis. The overall response rate was 46% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 27-65%. According to diagnosis, complete remission (CR) rates are: AML: 5/13, ALL: 5/9, and AUL: 2/4. Four children died, three from infection and one from acute lysis syndrome. The major toxicity was infection with grade 3 and 4 episodes occurring in 42% of patients. No significant cardiac toxicity was noted. Hepatic and renal toxicity was noted. Hepatic and renal toxicity were limited and transient. Bisantrene in association with aracytine is effective in both AML and ALL of childhood. Bisantrene should be evaluated with a five-day schedule in other pediatric malignancies. In children with acute leukemia previously treated with high dose aracytine, new combination regimen is warranted.\n\nImpact of side-effects of atypical antipsychotics on non-compliance, relapse and cost.\n\nPubMed\n\nMortimer, A; Williams, P; Meddis, D\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAtypical antipsychotics generally have milder side-effects than conventional antipsychotics, but also differ among themselves in this respect. This study aimed to compare the impact of different side-effect profiles of individual atypical antipsychotics on non-compliance, relapse and cost in schizophrenia. A state-transition model was built using literature data supplemented by expert opinion. The model found that quetiapine and ziprasidone were similar in estimated non-compliance and relapse rates. Olanzapine and risperidone had higher estimated non-compliance and relapse rates, and incremental, 1-year, per-patient direct costs, using US-based cost data, of approximately $530 (95% confidence interval [CI] approximately $275, $800), and approximately $485 (95% CI approximately $235, $800), respectively, compared with quetiapine. Incremental costs attributable to different side-effect profiles were highly significant. This study shows that differing side-effect profiles of the newer antipsychotic agents are likely to lead to different compliance rates, and consequent variation in relapse rates. The cost implications of these heterogenous clinical outcomes are substantial.\n\nAlternatives for reducing relapse rate when switching from natalizumab to fingolimod in multiple sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nFragoso, Yara Dadalti; Adoni, Tarso; Alves-Leon, Soniza Vieira; Apostolos-Pereira, Samira Luisa; Araujo, Yuna Ribeiro de; Becker, Jefferson; Brooks, Joseph Bruno Bidin; Correa, Eber Castro; Damasceno, Alfredo; Damasceno, Carlos Augusto de Albuquerque; Ferreira, Maria Lucia B; Gama, Paulo Diniz da; Gama, Rodrigo Assad Diniz da; Gomes, Sidney; Goncalves, Marcus Vinicius Magno; Grzesiuk, Anderson Kuntz; Machado, Suzana Costa Nunes; Matta, Andre Palma da Cunha; Mendes, Maria Fernanda; Ribeiro, Taysa Alexandrino Goncalves Jube; Rocha, Cristiane Franklin da; Ruocco, Heloisa Helena; Sato, Henry; Simm, Renata Faria; Tauil, Carlos Bernardo; Vasconcelos, Claudia Cristina Ferreira; Vieira, Vera Lucia Ferreira\n\n2016-02-21\n\nNatalizumab is a therapeutic option for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) and is particularly efficacious for patients with highly active disease. A long washout period has been recommended between withdrawal of natalizumab and start of fingolimod (another option for treating MS). This long washout period has been associated with a significant increase in MS activity. In the present study, a group of 96 patients who were switched from natalizumab to fingolimod had short washout periods between drugs, or monthly corticosteroid pulse therapy if longer washout periods were recommended. This therapeutic approach led to the lowest reported relapse rate so far, among patients with MS switching from natalizumab to fingolimod (8.3%). No complications from short withdrawal were observed in this group of patients.\n\nPredictors of marijuana relapse in the human laboratory: robust impact of tobacco cigarette smoking status.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaney, Margaret; Bedi, Gillinder; Cooper, Ziva D; Glass, Andrew; Vosburg, Suzanne K; Comer, Sandra D; Foltin, Richard W\n\n2013-02-01\n\nFew marijuana smokers in treatment achieve sustained abstinence, yet factors contributing to high relapse rates are unknown. Study 1: data from five inpatient laboratory studies assessing marijuana intoxication, withdrawal, and relapse were combined to assess factors predicting the likelihood and severity of relapse. Daily, nontreatment-seeking marijuana smokers (n = 51; 10 Â± 5 marijuana cigarettes/day) were enrolled. Study 2: to isolate the effects of cigarette smoking, marijuana intoxication, withdrawal, and relapse were assessed in daily marijuana and cigarette smokers (n = 15) under two within-subject, counter-balanced conditions: while smoking tobacco cigarettes as usual (SAU), and after at least 5 days without cigarettes (Quit). Study 1: 49% of participants relapsed the first day active marijuana became available. Tobacco cigarette smokers (75%), who were not abstaining from cigarettes, were far more likely to relapse than non-cigarette smokers (odds ratio: 19, p < .01). Individuals experiencing more positive subjective effects (i.e., feeling \"high\") after marijuana administration and those with more negative affect and sleep disruption during marijuana withdrawal were more likely to have severe relapse episodes (p < .05). Study 2: most participants (>87%) relapsed to marijuana whether in the SAU or Quit phase. Tobacco cigarette smoking did not significantly influence relapse, nor did it affect marijuana intoxication or most symptoms of withdrawal relative to tobacco cessation. Daily marijuana smokers who also smoke cigarettes have high rates of marijuana relapse, and cigarette smoking versus recent abstinence does not directly influence this association. These data indicate that current cigarette smoking is a clinically important marker for increased risk of marijuana relapse. Copyright Â© 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

The knowledge of the risk factors for CNS relapse is important to determine which patients could benefit from prophylaxis. Thus, patients with very aggressive lymphomas (such as lymphoblastic lymphoma or Burkitt's lymphoma) must systematically receive CNS prophylaxis due to a high CNS relapse rate (25-30%), while in patients with indolent lymphoma (such as follicular lymphoma or marginal lymphoma) prophylaxis is unnecessary. However, the question about CNS prophylaxis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common type of lymphoma, remains controversial. The information available is extensive, mainly based on retrospective and heterogeneous studies. There seems that immunochemotherapy based on rituximab reduces the CNS relapse rate. On the other hand, patients with increased serum lactate dehydrogenase plus more than one extranodal involvement seem to have a higher risk of CNS relapse, but a prophylaxis strategy based only on the presence of these 2 factors does not prevent all CNS relapses. Patients with involvement of testes or breast have high risk of CNS relapse and prophylaxis is mandatory. Finally, CNS prophylaxis could be considered in patients with DLBCL and renal or epidural space involvement, as well as in those cases with MYC rearrangements, although additional studies are necessary.

Very high dose single-agent cytarabine at 36âg/m(2) (ARA-36) was previously shown to be effective and tolerable in RR-AML. In this retrospective analysis, we aim to describe the toxicity and efficacy of ARA-36 as salvage therapy for patients with AML who are primary refractory to intensive daunorubicin-containing induction or those relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). Fifteen patients, median age 53âyears, were included in the analysis. Six patients were treated for induction failure, one had resistant APL, and eight relapsed after alloSCT. Complete remission was achieved in 60% of patients. Surviving patients were followed for a median of 8.5âmonths. One-year overall survival was 54% (95% CI 30%-86%), and relapse rate from remission (nâ=â9) was 56%. Grade III/IV pulmonary, infectious, ocular and gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in 26%, 20%, 20% and 20% of patients respectively. Salvage therapy with ARA-36 regimen for RR-AML has considerable efficacy with manageable toxicity in patients with induction failure or post-transplant relapse. Overall survival in these high-risk patients still remains poor.

Chimeric antigen receptors redirected T cells (CAR-T cells) can enhance disease remission with a favorable outcome for relapsed/refractory ALL, though some cases quickly relapsed after CAR-T cell treatment. Thus, treatment with CAR-T cells followed by allo-HSCT may be the best way to treat relapsed/refractory ALL. In this review, we first discuss the different types of CAR-T cells. We then discuss the treatment of relapsed/refractory ALL using only CAR-T cells. Finally, we discuss the use of CAR-T cells, followed by allo-HSCT, for the treatment of relapsed/refractory ALL.\n\nFactors associated with relapse after a response to electroconvulsive therapy in unipolar versus bipolar depression.\n\nPubMed\n\nItagaki, Kei; Takebayashi, Minoru; Shibasaki, Chiyo; Kajitani, Naoto; Abe, Hiromi; Okada-Tsuchioka, Mami; Yamawaki, Shigeto\n\n2017-01-15\n\nWhile electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment for depression is highly effective, the high rate of relapse is a critical problem. The current study investigated factors associated with the risk of relapse in mood disorders in patients in which ECT was initially effective. The records of 100 patients with mood disorders (61 unipolar depression, 39 bipolar depression) who received and responded to an acute ECT course were retrospectively reviewed. Associations between clinical variables and relapse after responding to acute ECT were analyzed. The Ethics Committee of NHO Kure Medical Center approved the study protocol. After one year, the percentage of relapse-free patients was 48.7%. There was no significant difference between patients with either unipolar or bipolar depression who were relapse-free (unipolar: 51.1%, bipolar: 45.5%, P=0.603). Valproate maintenance pharmacotherapy in unipolar depression patients was associated with a lower risk of relapse compared to patients without valproate treatment (multivariate analysis, hazard ratio: 0.091; P=0.022). Lithium treatment, reportedly effective for unipolar depression following a course of ECT, tended to lower the risk of relapse (hazard ratio: 0.378; P=0.060). For bipolar depression, no treatment significantly reduced the risk of relapse. The current findings were retrospective and based on a limited sample size. The relapse-free rate was similar between unipolar and bipolar depression. Valproate could have potential for unipolar depression patients as a maintenance therapeutic in preventing relapse after ECT. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies report the impact of high annual relapse rates on outcomes. The purpose of this study was to identify high relapse activity (HRA) in patients with MS, comparing differences in outcomes between patients with and without HRA. A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using the MarketScanÂ® Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental Database. Patients had to have at least one ICD-9 for MS (340.XX) in 2009 and one in 2008, be older than 18 years, and have continuous enrolment in the years 2009-2010. HRA was defined as having â¥2 relapses in 2009. Multivariate analyses compared all-cause and MS-specific emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and all-cause costs, excluding disease modifying therapy (DMT) costs, in 2010 between patients with and without HRA, controlling for baseline characteristics. A subgroup analysis using treatment exposure was also performed. 19,219 patients were included: 5.3% (n=1,017) had â¥2 relapses in 2009. Patients with HRA were more likely to have all-cause and MS-specific resource utilization than patients without HRA. Mean total all-cause non DMT costs were $12,057 higher for the HRA group. In the subgroup analysis, HRA treatment-naÃ¯ve patients were more likely to start treatment, and HRA treatment-experienced patients were more likely to discontinue or switch index DMT (P<0.01). Patients with â¥2 relapses annually have higher resource utilization and costs. The difference in cost was over twice as large in treatment-naÃ¯ve patients versus treatment-experienced patients. HRA was also associated with an increased likelihood of starting DMT treatment (treatment-naÃ¯ve patients), and switching or discontinuing DMT therapy (treatment-experienced patients).\n\nCladribine tablets: in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuir, Victoria J; Plosker, Greg L\n\n2011-03-01\n\nCladribine, an immunosuppressant that selectively reduces peripheral lymphocyte levels, has potential as an oral therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. An oral (tablet) formulation is being investigated in clinical trials. In the large, well designed, phase III CLARITY trial, short-course treatment with oral cladribine (cumulative dose of 3.5 or 5.25 mg/kg) resulted in a significantly greater reduction in annualized relapse rates at 96 weeks compared with placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Improvements in the annualized relapse rate with oral cladribine were independent of key baseline patient characteristics which included age, sex, previous treatment with disease-modifying drugs and the number of relapses in the previous 12 months. In addition, a significantly higher proportion of patients were relapse-free at 96 weeks and there were significant reductions in the risk of 3-month sustained progression of disability in cladribine recipients compared with placebo recipients. The mean numbers of brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were also significantly reduced with cladribine compared with placebo in the CLARITY trial. Lymphocytopenia, herpes zoster infections and neoplasms (including malignancies) were more common in cladribine than placebo recipients.\n\nWhole Neuraxis Irradiation to Address Central Nervous System Relapse in High-Risk Neuroblastoma\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCroog, Victoria J., E-mail: vcroog@sibley.or; Kramer, Kim; Cheung, Nai-Kong V.\n\nBackground: As systemic control of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) has improved, relapse in the central nervous system (CNS) is an increasingly recognized entity that carries a grim prognosis. This study describes the use of craniospinal irradiation (CSI) for CNS relapse and compares outcomes to patients who received focal radiotherapy (RT). Methods: A retrospective query identified 29 children with NB treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center since 1987 who received RT for CNS relapse. At CNS relapse, 16 patients received CSI (median dose, 2160cGy), and 13 received focal RT. Of those who underwent CSI, 14 (88%) received intra-Ommaya (IO) radioimmunotherapy (RIT); onemoreÂ Â» patient in the non-CSI cohort received IO-RIT. Results: Patient characteristics were similar between the groups. Time to CNS relapse was 20 and 17 months for the CSI and non-CSI cohorts, respectively. At a median follow-up of 28 months, 12 patients (75%) in the CSI group are alive without CNS disease, including two patients with isolated skeletal relapse. Another patient is alive without disease after a brain relapse was retreated with RT. Three patients died-one with no NB at autopsy, one of CNS disease, and one of systemic disease. The two patients who died of NB did not receive IO-RIT. All 13 patients in the non-CSI cohort died at a median of 8.8 months. Conclusions: Low-dose CSI together with IO-RIT provides durable CNS remissions and improved survival compared with focal RT and conventional therapies. Further evaluation of long-term NB survivors after CSI is warranted to determine the treatment consequences for this cohort.Â«Â less\n\nMicrobiome interaction with sugar plays an important role in relapse of childhood caries.\n\nPubMed\n\nTian, Jing; Qin, Man; Ma, Wenli; Xia, Bin; Xu, He; Zhang, Qian; Chen, Feng\n\nChildhood caries have a high relapse rate after full mouth therapy. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between the microbiome, sugar, and the relapse of childhood caries after therapy. A total of 24 children aged 2-4 years who underwent one caries treatment session participated in this study. Supragingival plaque was collected before therapy and 1 and 7 months after therapy, then sequenced using the 16S rRNA high-throughput approach. We found 11 phyla, 140 genera, and 444 species in 72 samples. The children were divided into relapse-free (nÂ =Â 13) and relapse (nÂ =Â 11) groups according to whether they relapsed 7 months after therapy. The bacterial community richness, diversity, structure, and relative abundance of bacterial taxa were significantly different between the two groups 7 months after therapy. The two groups also differed in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa, both before and 1 month after therapy. Bacterial community richness and diversity were lower in the relapse-free group 1 month after therapy. Using different operational taxonomic units between the relapse-free and relapse groups 1 month after therapy, a relapse-risk assessment model was built with 75% accuracy, 0.1905 out-of-bag error, and 66.67% validation accuracy. Patients in the relapse group had higher sugar intake frequencies than those in the relapse-free group during follow-up. Interactions between the microbiome and sugar intake frequency were found through co-occurrence networks. We conclude that the microbiome is significantly different between the relapse-free and relapse groups at the time of relapse. Supragingival plaque collected immediately after therapy can be used to predict the risk of relapse. Furthermore, the correlation between sugar intake frequency and microbiome is associated with the relapse. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Vaughn; Isenberg, Keith; Cooper, Thomas; Rosenquist, Peter B.; Mulsant, Benoit H.; Sackeim, Harold A.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective To determine whether starting antidepressant medication at the start of ECT reduces postECT relapse and to determine whether continuation pharmacotherapy with nortriptyline and lithium (NT-Li) differs in efficacy or side effects from continuation pharmacotherapy with venlafaxine and lithium (VEN-Li). Method During an acute ECT phase, 319 patients were randomized to treatment with moderate dosage bilateral ECT or high dosage right unilateral ECT. They were also randomized to concurrent treatment with placebo, NT, or VEN. Of 181 patients to meet postECT remission criteria, 122 (67.4%) participated in a second continuation pharmacotherapy phase. Patients earlier randomized to NT or VEN continued on the antidepressant, while patients earlier randomized to placebo were now randomized to NT or VEN. Li was added for all patients who were followed until relapse or 6 months. Results Starting an antidepressant medication at the beginning of the ECT course did not impact on the rate or timing of relapse relative to starting pharmacotherapy after ECT completion. The combination of NT-Li did not differ from VEN-Li in any relapse or side effect measure. Older age was strongly associated with lower relapse risk, whereas the type of ECT administered in the acute phase and medication resistance were not predictive. Across sites, 50% of patients relapsed, 33.6% continued in remission 6 months postECT, and 16.4% dropped out. Conclusions Starting an antidepressant medication during ECT does not impact relapse and there are concerns about administering Li during an acute ECT course. Nortriptyline and venlafaxine were equally effective in prolonging remission, although relapse rates following ECT are substantial despite intensive pharmacology. As opposed to the usual abrupt cessation of ECT, the impact of an ECT taper should be evaluated.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has strong evidence among general populations but has not been studied among at-risk pregnant women to prevent depression. We examined the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of depression symptom severity and relapse/recurrence associated with MBCT adapted for perinatal women (MBCT-PD). Pregnant women with depression histories were recruited from obstetrics clinics in a large health maintenance organization at two sites and enrolled in MBCT-PD (Nâ=â49). Self-reported depressive symptoms and interview-based assessments of depression relapse/recurrence status were measured at baseline, during MBCT-PD, and through 6-months postpartum. Pregnant women reported interest, engagement, and satisfaction with the program. Retention rates were high, as were rates of completion of daily homework practices. Intent to treat analyses indicated a significant improvement in depression symptom levels and an 18 % rate of relapse/recurrence through 6 months postpartum. MBCT-PD shows promise as an acceptable, feasible, and clinically beneficial brief psychosocial prevention option for pregnant women with histories of depression. Randomized controlled trials are needed to examine the efficacy of MBCT-PD for the prevention of depressive relapse/recurrence during pregnancy and postpartum.\n\nPharmacometric Analysis of the Relationship Between Absolute Lymphocyte Count and Expanded Disability Status Scale and Relapse Rate, Efficacy End Points, in Multiple Sclerosis Trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nNovakovic, A M; Thorsted, A; Schindler, E; JÃ¶nsson, S; Munafo, A; Karlsson, M O\n\n2018-05-10\n\nThe aim of this work was to assess the relationship between the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and disability (as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) and occurrence of relapses, 2 efficacy endpoints, respectively, in patients with remitting-relasping multiple sclerosis. Data for ALC, EDSS, and relapse rate were available from 1319 patients receiving placebo and/or cladribine tablets. Pharmacodynamic models were developed to characterize the time course of the endpoints. ALC-related measures were then evaluated as predictors of the efficacy endpoints. EDSS data were best fitted by a model where the logit-linear disease progression is affected by the dynamics of ALC change from baseline. Relapse rate data were best described by the Weibull hazard function, and the ALC change from baseline was also found to be a significant predictor of time to relapse. Presented models have shown that once cladribine exposure driven ALC-derived measures are included in the model, the need for drug effect components is of less importance (EDSS) or disappears (relapse rate). This simplifies the models and theoretically makes them mechanism specific rather than drug specific. Having a reliable mechanism-specific model would allow leveraging historical data across compounds, to support decision making in drug development and possibly shorten the time to market.

METHODS: A prospective, single center, 2-year clinical trial was conducted. Twenty-two adult CD patients who achieved clinical remission either medically (n = 17) or surgically (n = 5) and consumed an SVD during hospitalization were advised to continue with an SVD and avoid known high-risk foods for inflammatory bowel disease. The primary endpoint was clinical relapse defined as the appearance of active symptoms of CD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative proportion of patients who had a relapse. A 2-year analysis of relapse rates of patients who followed an SVD and those who did not (an omnivorous diet group) was undertaken. RESULTS: SVD was continued by 16 patients (compliance 73%). Remission was maintained in 15 of 16 patients (94%) in the SVD group vs two of six (33%) in the omnivorous group. Remission rate with SVD was 100% at 1 year and 92% at 2 years. SVD showed significant prevention in the time to relapse compared to that in the omnivorous group (P = 0.0003, log rank test). The concentration of C-reactive protein was normal at the final visit in more than half of the patients in remission who were taking an SVD, who maintained remission during the study (9/15; 60%), who terminated follow-up (8/12; 67%), and who completed 2 years follow-up (7/10; 70%). There was no untoward effect of SVD. CONCLUSION: SVD was highly effective in preventing relapse in CD.

We screened the clinical data of all 103 pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma undergoing surgical treatment at our department between January 2006 and January 2013 and conducted a retrospective analysis of 82 patients with craniopharyngioma originating in the pituitary stalk. The patients were followed up from 12 months to 8 years. We analyzed the effect of preserving the pituitary stalk on the early and persistent diabetes insipidus rates, postoperative relapse rate, and mortality. In the total resection group (nâ=â67), the early and persistent diabetes insipidus rates were significantly lower in the 46 patients (68.7%) with a pituitary stalk than in those whose pituitary stalk was removed (Pâ<â0.05); no significant difference was observed in the relapse rate between the 2 subgroups (Pâ>â0.05). In the subtotal resection group (nâ=â15), a significant difference was observed in the early and persistent diabetes insipidus rates (Pâ<â0.05), but no significant difference was observed in the relapse rate between the patients with a pituitary stalk and those whose pituitary stalk was removed (Pâ>â0.05). For children with craniopharyngioma of pituitary stalk origin, preserving the pituitary stalk has a significant effect on the early and persistent diabetes insipidus rates. When intraoperative exploration showed excessive adhesion between the tumor and pituitary stalk, we opted to preserve the pituitary stalk, which significantly reduced the early and persistent postoperative diabetes insipidus rates, without significantly increasing the relapse or mortality rate.\n\nRelapse prevention and smoking cessation.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavis, J R; Glaros, A G\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA multicomponent smoking relapse prevention treatment based on Marlatt and Gordon's (1980) model of the relapse process was developed and evaluated. Behavior-analytic methods were used to develop assessment instruments, training situations, and coping responses. The prevention components were presented in the context of a basic broad-spectrum stop-smoking program, and were compared with the basic program plus discussion control, and the basic program alone. Smoking-related dependent variables generally did not differ between groups at any time from pre-treatment to 12 month follow-up. Only the subjects in the relapse prevention condition improved problem-solving and social skills needed to cope with high-risk situations. These subjects also tended to take longer to relapse and smoke fewer cigarettes at the time of relapse. Subjects above the median level of competence on measures of social skill at post-treatment remained abstinent significantly longer. Maintenance of non-smoking was found to be related to the degree of competence with which individuals deal with high-risk situations. Results are discussed in relation to models of compliance with therapeutic regimens.\n\nRisk of seizure relapse after antiepileptic drug withdrawal in adult patients with focal epilepsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Ru-Qian; Zeng, Qing-Yi; Zhu, Pan; Bao, Yi-Xin; Zheng, Rong-Yuan; Xu, Hui-Qin\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to estimate the risk of a seizure relapse and the high-risk period of recurrence after antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal and to determine the predictive factors for a seizure relapse in adult patients with focal epilepsy who were seizure-free for more than 2years. Using the Wenzhou Epilepsy Follow-Up Registry Database, 200 adult patients with focal epilepsy were recruited, who were undergoing follow-up, met the inclusion criteria of this study, were seizure-free for more than 2years, began withdrawing between June 2003 and June 2014, and were followed up prospectively for at least 1year or until a seizure relapse. The risk of recurrence and the time to seizure relapse were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the predictive factors were identified by the Cox proportional hazard regression model. A total of 99 patients had an unprovoked relapse during the follow-up period. The relapse rate was 49.5%, and each year, the recurrence probability of 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84months after AED withdrawal was 24.0%, 20.4%, 8.3%, 2.7%, 4.6%, 0.97%, and 0.98%, respectively. The two independent risk factors for recurrence after withdrawal in adult patients with focal epilepsy were a longer duration of active epilepsy and a shorter seizure-free period before withdrawal. The high-risk period of a seizure relapse in adult patients with focal epilepsy is the first 2years after withdrawal, and beyond 5years after withdrawal, seizures rarely relapse (relapse rate<1%). A seizure-free period for less than 4years before withdrawal is a predictive factor of risk for seizure recurrence after AED withdrawal in adult patients with focal epilepsy.

Mexican patients have high mortality rates, low frequency of good prognosis biomarkers (i.e., ETV6-RUNX1) and a high proportion is classified at the time of diagnosis with a high risk to relapse according to clinical features. In addition, very early relapses are more frequently observed than in other populations. The aim of the study was to identify new potential biomarkers associated with very early relapse in Mexican ALL children through transcriptome analysis. Microarray gene expression profiling on bone marrow samples of 54 pediatric ALL patients, collected at time of diagnosis and/or at relapse, was performed. Eleven patients presented relapse within the first 18Â months after diagnosis. Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (HTA 2.0) was used to perform gene expression analysis. Annotation and functional enrichment analyses were carried out using Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools. BLVRB, ZCCHC7, PAX5, EBF1, TMOD1 and BLNK were differentially expressed (fold-change >2.0 and p value <0.01) between relapsed and non-relapsed patients. Functional analysis of abnormally expressed genes revealed their important role in cellular processes related to the development of hematological diseases, cancer, cell death and survival and in cell-to-cell signaling interaction. Our data support previous findings showing the relevance of PAX5, EBF1 and ZCCHC7 as potential biomarkers to identify a subgroup of ALL children in high risk to relapse. Copyright Â© 2016 IMSS.

Patients and methods This analysis of a 12-month, prospective, noninterventional study examined outcomes for 1,089 inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia who initiated antipsychotic monotherapy. All treatment decisions, including medication choice, were left to the discretion of the treating physician. The rates of treatment response, relapse, and 6-month sustained remission were compared between olanzapine monotherapy (OLZ) and other anti-psychotic monotherapy (OAN), and between OLZ and other atypical antipsychotic monotherapy (OAT). Visit-wise comparisons of treatment response and remission were examined using repeated-measures logistic regressions. Propensity scores were used to control for potential baseline differences between groups. Results Response rates were higher for OLZ patients and relapse rates were consistently lower for OLZ patients, however the differences were not statistically significant. Rates of 6-month sustained remission were significantly higher for OLZ than OAN patients (P=0.032) and for OLZ than OAT patients (P=0.041). An exploratory analysis of OLZ and OAN comparison found outpatients treated with OLZ or OAN had similar sustained remission rates (OLZ: 22.2%, OAN: 22.8%), while inpatients treated with OLZ had significantly higher sustained remission rates than inpatients treated with OAN (OLZ: 17.1%, OAN: 6.6%, odds ratio [95% confidence interval] =3.54 [2.00â6.25]). Conclusion In usual care in Japan, treating the acute symptoms of schizophrenia with olanzapine was not found to be significantly different for response and relapse rates; however, treatment with olanzapine was found to have significantly greater sustained remission rates than treatment with other antipsychotics. In the inpatient setting, where patients tend to be more severe and\n\nGeographical variation in Plasmodium vivax relapse\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Plasmodium vivax has the widest geographic distribution of the human malaria parasites and nearly 2.5 billion people live at risk of infection. The control of P. vivax in individuals and populations is complicated by its ability to relapse weeks to months after initial infection. Strains of P. vivax from different geographical areas are thought to exhibit varied relapse timings. In tropical regions strains relapse quickly (three to six weeks), whereas those in temperate regions do so more slowly (six to twelveÂ months), but no comprehensive assessment of evidence has been conducted. Here observed patterns of relapse periodicity are used to generate predictions of relapse incidence within geographic regions representative of varying parasite transmission. Methods A global review of reports of P. vivax relapse in patients not treated with a radical cure was conducted. Records of time to first P. vivax relapse were positioned by geographic origin relative to expert opinion regions of relapse behaviour and epidemiological zones. Mixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted to determine which geographic classification best described the data, such that a description of the pattern of relapse periodicity within each region could be described. Model outputs of incidence and mean time to relapse were mapped to illustrate the global variation in relapse. Results Differences in relapse periodicity were best described by a historical geographic classification system used to describe malaria transmission zones based on areas sharing zoological and ecological features. Maps of incidence and time to relapse showed high relapse frequency to be predominant in tropical regions and prolonged relapse in temperate areas. Conclusions The results indicate that relapse periodicity varies systematically by geographic region and are categorized by nine global regions characterized by similar malaria transmission dynamics. This indicates that relapse may be an adaptation evolved to\n\nTargeting BTK with ibrutinib in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nByrd, John C; Furman, Richard R; Coutre, Steven E; Flinn, Ian W; Burger, Jan A; Blum, Kristie A; Grant, Barbara; Sharman, Jeff P; Coleman, Morton; Wierda, William G; Jones, Jeffrey A; Zhao, Weiqiang; Heerema, Nyla A; Johnson, Amy J; Sukbuntherng, Juthamas; Chang, Betty Y; Clow, Fong; Hedrick, Eric; Buggy, Joseph J; James, Danelle F; O'Brien, Susan\n\n2013-07-04\n\nThe treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has resulted in few durable remissions. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%. Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions.

The control of cure was performed by clinical and serological evaluation using the double agar gel immunodiffusion test (DID). In the diagnosis of relapse, DID, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting assay (IBgp70 and IBgp43) were evaluated. Out of 400 patients, 21 (5.2%) went through relapse, 18 of them were male and 3 were female, 6â¶1 male/female ratio. Out of the 21 patients in relapse, 15 (4.8%) showed the CF, and 6 (6.4%) the AF (p>0.05). The sensitivity of DID and ELISA before treatment was the same (76.1%). DID presented higher sensitivity in pre-treatment (80%) than at relapse (45%; pâ=â0.017), while ELISA showed the same sensitivity (80% vs 65%; pâ=â0.125). The serological methods for identifying PCM patients in relapse showed low rates of sensitivity, from 12.5% in IBgp70 to 65.0% in IBgp43 identification and 68.8% in ELISA. The sensitivity of ELISA in diagnosing PCM relapse showed a strong tendency to be higher than DID (pâ=â0.06) and is equal to IBgp43 (pâ=â0.11). In sum, prevalence of relapse was not high in PCM patients whose treatment duration was based on immunological parameters. However, the used methods for serological diagnosis present low sensitivity. While more accurate serological methods are not available, we pay special attention to the mycological and histopathological diagnosis of PCM relapse. Hence, direct mycological, cytopathological, and histopathological examinations and isolation in culture for P. brasiliensis must be appropriately and routinely performed when the hypothesis of relapse is\n\nAlcohol craving as a predictor of relapse.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchneekloth, Terry D; Biernacka, Joanna M; Hall-Flavin, Daniel K; Karpyak, Victor M; Frye, Mark A; Loukianova, Larissa L; Stevens, Susanna R; Drews, Maureen S; Geske, Jennifer R; Mrazek, David A\n\n2012-11-01\n\nAlcoholism treatment interventions, both psychosocial and pharmacologic, aim to reduce cravings to drink. Yet, the role of craving in treatment outcomes remains unclear. This study evaluated craving intensity measured with the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) at admission and discharge from residential treatment as a predictive factor of relapse after treatment. The study cohort included 314 alcohol-dependent subjects. Associations between relapse after discharge, PACS score, and clinical variables were investigated using time-to-event analyses. The primary analysis, based on the intent-to-treat principle, presumed relapse in those declining follow-up or not responding to contact attempts. Secondary analysis utilized data from 226 subjects successfully contacted after discharge with a median follow-up time of 365 days. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated that relapse was associated with higher level of craving at admission (p= .002) and discharge (p < .001). The analysis of data from patients successfully contacted after discharge led to similar results. A multivariable analysis indicated that relapse rates increased as PACS scores increased, and a higher discharge PACS score was significantly associated with relapse (p= .006) even after adjusting for covariates. This study demonstrates that higher PACS scores at the time of admission and discharge are associated with relapse following residential addiction treatment. These data support the role of craving in relapse and the utility of craving measurement as a clinical guide in assessing relapse risk.
