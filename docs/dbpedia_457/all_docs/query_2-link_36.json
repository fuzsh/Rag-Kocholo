        "text": "This article presents a few of the many research possibilities offered by the Photo Archive and Special Collections of the GRI. On the basis of some annotated photographs, it has been possible to add to the information regarding a privately owned and little studied Pietà, here attributed to Carpaccio. A previously unknown photograph, from the William Suhr papers, shows the painting during restoration. The second work discussed is a little known painting, a Head of Christ from the Carnegie Museum. Adolfo Venturi published a small photograph of it, a copy of which is in the Photo Archive of the GRI and here reproduced. Attributed to Carpaccio early on in its critical history, the painting is now more convincingly assigned to the ambit of Francesco Bissolo. The changed attribution is based on the present condition of the canvas, which at some point must have undergone restoration."
