        "text": "Acute adult poisoning cases admitted to a university hospital in Tabriz, Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nIslambulchilar, M; Islambulchilar, Z; Kargar-Maher, M H\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe aim of our study was to investigate the etiological and demographical characteristics of acute adult poisoning cases admitted to a university hospital in Tabriz, Iran. This retrospective study was performed on 1342 poisoning admissions to a university hospital from 2003 to 2005, by data collection from the medical records of patients. Poisonings were 5.40% of the total admissions. There was a predominance of female patients (55.7%) compared to male patients (44.3%) with a female-to-male ratio of 1.2:1. Most poisonings occurred in the age range of 11-20 years (38.9%). Drugs were the most common cause of poisonings (60.8%). Among the drug poisonings, benzodiazepines (40.31%) were the most frequent agents, followed by antidepressants (31.98%). The seasonal distribution in poisoning patients suggested a peak in spring (28%) and summer (27.5%). In 9.8% of cases accidental and in 90.2% intentional poisonings were evident. Most suicide attempts were made by women (58.51%) and unmarried people (51.4%).The mean duration of hospitalization was 3.02 +/- 2.8 days. There were 28 (2.3%) deaths; the majority (13 cases) was due to pesticides. This was a university hospital-based study, so these results may not be representative of the general population. Despite this drawback, these data still provide important information on the characteristics of the poisoning in this part of Iran. To prevent such poisonings, the community education about the danger of central nervous system-acting drugs and reducing the exposure period of people to pesticides are recommended.\n\n[A study of 355 consecutive acute poisoning cases admitted to an emergency ward at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg in 2001].\n\nPubMed\n\nGude, Anne-Bolette Jill; Hoegberg, Lotte C G; Pedersen, Michael; Nielsen, Jonas; Angelo, Helle R; Christensen, Hanne Rolighed\n\n2007-05-07\n\nEpidemiology describing poisoned patients treated at Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg has not been published since 1993. We wanted to describe the pattern of intoxications. A retrospective study of poisoned patients admitted to the emergency ward during 2001. A computer search of patients discharged with codes T36.0-T65.9 was supplemented by a hand search of the daily admittance lists. 355 patients with confirmed poisonings were found. 97% were poisoned by medications, alcohol (ethanol) or drugs of abuse. Only 3% were poisoned by other agents such as CO. 55% of poisonings were intentional, where paracetamol and benzodiazepines were the preferred agents. Sedative-hypnotics, alcohol, opioids, and drugs of abuse dominated the unintentional overdoses. Patients poisoned by paracetamol were younger and female, with an overrepresentation of young women of foreign origin. Activated charcoal was the preferred method of gastric decontamination. In 52% of the cases various discrepancies between discharge codes and actual poisonings were found. There were 5 deaths, 2 of which were from mixed overdoses with benzodiazepines involving the administration of flumazenil. The 355 cases represented 6% of all patients admitted to the department. Paracetamol, sedative-hypnotics and alcohol were the most common poisoning agents. Mortality was 1%. A general problem of discharge coding was found, which might implicate unreliability in statistics in this field.\n\n[Cases of acute poisoning admitted to a medical intensive care unit].\n\nPubMed\n\nViertel, A; Weidmann, E; Brodt, H R\n\n2001-10-19\n\nBecause of the paucity of information on the epidemiology of acute poisoning requiring intensive medical care, all such patients treated on the medical intensive care unit of the university hospital in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, between January 1993 and December 1999, were retrospectively evaluated. Of the total of 6211 patients, 147 (80 women, 67 men, mean age 41 years, 2,3 %) were treated for acute intoxication in the intensive care unit. Reasons for admission to the intensive care unit were the need for ventilator treatment or intensive monitoring of vital functions. 52 % of the patients (n = 76) had attempted suicide, most of them using anti-depressive drugs (n = 19), paracetamol (n = 16), or benzodiazepines (n = 9). Two patients (2,6 %) died. 48 % of the patients (n = 71) were admitted because of accidental poisoning. Leading toxic agents in this group were heroin (n = 19), alcohol (n = 18) and digitalis (n = 12). 11 patients had taken herbicides, animal poisons or chemicals used at work or for house cleaning. In this cohort, three i. v. drug abusers (4,2 %) had died. Depending on the agents used, a variety of treatments (charcoal, antidots, extracorporal therapy) were undertaken. Due to excellent care in the prehospital phase and in the emergency room the number of patients requiring treatment on the intensive care unit was rather low. The mortality was in the range of other reports.\n\nAcute poisoning cases admitted to a university hospital emergency department in Diyarbakir, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ¼loÄlu, Cahfer; Kara, Ismail Hamdi\n\n2005-02-01\n\nThis study was conducted to determine the biological effects of acute poisoning, the nature of agents involved and the pattern of poisoning in Diyarbakir City, in the Southeast Anatolian region of Turkey, during 2000. Hospital records of all admissions to the Emergency Department (ED) of Dicle University Hospital following acute poisoning were revised and all data from January to December 2000 were analysed. The present study included 44 (25.9%) male (M) and 126 (74.1%) female (F), a total of 170 patients. The M/F ratio was 1.0/3.5. The mean age of patients was 23.3+/-6.3 years; 63 (37.1%) of them were under 20 years of age and 147 (86.5%) were under 30 years of age. Most intoxication cases occurred during the summer season (93 of 170 patients). On a monthly basis, admissions during April, May and July were most common (24, 26 and 30 patients, respectively). Sixty-two (36.5%) cases involved accidental poisoning while 108 (63.5%) involved deliberate poisoning. In suicide attempts, intoxications were more common in females (77 cases, 71.3%, P < 0.05), and in unmarried persons (74 cases, 68.5%, P < 0.05). There were only two deaths (1.2%) among the 170 admissions of acute poisonings. One of the deaths was due to pesticide poisoning and the other was due to medical drug abuse. Tachycardia (59, 34.7%), vomiting (55, 32.4%) and loss of consciousness (42, 24.7%) were frequently observed, whereas hypersecretion (15, 8.8%), bradycardia (5, 2.9%), convulsion (8, 4.7%) and hypertension (2, 1.2%) were less frequent. Among pesticide poisoning cases the incidence of convulsion (6, 10.2%), miosis (6, 10.2%), and hypersecretion (12, 20.3%) were significantly higher when compared to other cases (P=0.018, P <0.0001 and P <0.0001, respectively). In the Southeast Anatolian region of Turkey, pesticide intoxication is common especially among young, unmarried females and most of these intoxications are intentional self-poisonings. The annual rate of poisoning-related ED visits and\n\nFactors associated with adult poisoning in northern Malaysia: a case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nFathelrahman, A I; Ab Rahman, A F; Zain, Z Mohd; Tengku, M A\n\n2006-04-01\n\nData on adult risk factors associated with drug or chemical poisonings in Malaysia are scarce. The objective of the study was to identify possible risk factors associated with adult admissions to the Penang General Hospital (PGH) due to chemical poisoning and/or drug overdose. The present study was a case-control study, conducted over 18 weeks. One hundred acutely poisoned adult patients admitted to PGH during the period from September 2003 to February 2004 were considered as cases. Two hundred patients admitted to the same medical wards for other illnesses, during the same period, were matched for age and gender with the poisoned cases and thus selected as controls. McNemar test and binary logistic were used for univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis for multivariate analyses. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated for each predictor variable. Positive histories of psychiatric illness and previous poisoning, problems in boy/girl friend relationships, family problems, marital problems, Indian ethnicity, Chinese ethnicity, living in rented houses and living in a household with less than five people were significant risk factors associated with adult admissions due to poisoning.\n\nCharacteristics and outcomes of paracetamol poisoning cases at a general hospital in Northern Malaysia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohd Zain, Z; Fathelrahman, A I; Ab Rahman, A F\n\n2006-02-01\n\nParacetamol is available as an over-the-counter medication in many countries including Malaysia. This drug has been implicated in many poisoning cases admitted to hospitals throughout the country. We conducted a three-year retrospective review of 165 medical records of patients admitted to the Penang General Hospital for acute paracetamol poisoning. Cases were identified according to the discharge diagnosis documented in their medical records. Acute paracetamol poisoning occurred in all major ethnic groups. About 70 percent of our patients were female. There was minimal involvement of children. Admissions were more likely to be due to deliberate ingestions rather than accidental poisoning. In most cases, serum concentrations data plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram predicted the majority of cases to be unlikely to be hepatotoxic, which were consistent with their mild clinical courses. Patients who acutely ingested more than 140 mg/kg or predicted to be hepatotoxic, based on their serum concentrations, had a significantly longer hospital stay. Although acute paracetamol poisoning was common, the outcome was generally good.\n\nPatients Admitted to Three Spanish Intensive Care Units for Poisoning: Type of Poisoning, Mortality, and Functioning of Prognostic Scores Commonly Used\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBanderas-Bravo, MarÃ­a Esther; Arias-VerdÃº, Maria Dolores; MacÃ­as-Guarasa, Ines; Castillo-Lorente, EncarnaciÃ³n; PÃ©rez-Costillas, Lucia; Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Raquel; Quesada-GarcÃ­a, Guillermo; Rivera-FernÃ¡ndez, Ricardo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjectives. To evaluate the gravity and mortality of those patients admitted to the intensive care unit for poisoning. Also, the applicability and predicted capacity of prognostic scales most frequently used in ICU must be evaluated. Methods. Multicentre study between 2008 and 2013 on all patients admitted for poisoning. Results. The results are from 119 patients. The causes of poisoning were medication, 92 patients (77.3%), caustics, 11 (9.2%), and alcohol, 20 (16,8%). 78.3% attempted suicides. Mean age was 44.42 Â± 13.85 years. 72.5% had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) â¤8 points. The ICU mortality was 5.9% and the hospital mortality was 6.7%. The mortality from caustic poisoning was 54.5%, and it was 1.9% for noncaustic poisoning (p < 0.001). After adjusting for SAPS-3 (OR: 1.19 (1.02â1.39)) the mortality of patients who had ingested caustics was far higher than the rest (OR: 560.34 (11.64â26973.83)). There was considerable discrepancy between mortality predicted by SAPS-3 (26.8%) and observed (6.7%) (Hosmer-Lemeshow test: H = 35.10; p < 0.001). The APACHE-II (7,57%) and APACHE-III (8,15%) were no discrepancies. Conclusions. Admission to ICU for poisoning is rare in our country. Medication is the most frequent cause, but mortality of caustic poisoning is higher. APACHE-II and APACHE-III provide adequate predictions about mortality, while SAPS-3 tends to overestimate. PMID:28459061\n\nAn epidemiological evaluation of 1098 acute poisoning cases from Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nAkkas, Meltem; Coskun, Figen; Ulu, Nadir; Sivri, Bulent\n\n2004-08-01\n\nThis study evaluated the characteristics of orally poisoned patients admitted to our emergency department (ED) between January 1, 1998 and February 28, 2002. This study included 1098 patients. Poisoning cases annualy accounted for 0.5-1.3% of total patient admission during this period. The average age of the patients was 26y old. Poisoning was particulary common in students and housewives. Poisoning cases presented to the ED most commonly between 6 pm and 12 am (38%). More than half of study patients (52%) were admitted to the ED within 2 h of exposure. The incidence of concomitant alcohol intake with another intoxicant was 11%. The ingested drugs were 32% various antidepressants, 23% paracetamol, 20% analgesics (excluding paracetamol and salicylates), 10% antibiotics, 9% benzodiazepines, 7% salicylates and 7% cardiovascular drugs. Most patients received at least 1 of the following treatments: gastric lavage, oral activated charcoal, iv hydration, or diuresis. Thirty-two percent of patients were hospitalized beyond 24 h and 68% of were discharged within 24 h. The mortality rate of the overall cohort was < 1%. Psychiatric consultation was obtained for 55% of patients.\n\nEpidemiological and Cost Analysis of Self-Poisoning Cases in Ankara, Turkey\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKavalci, Gulsum; Ethemoglu, Filiz Banu; Batuman, Asli; Kumral, Dilber; Emre, Cengizhan; Surgit, Meltem; Akdikan, Alev; Kavalci, Cemil\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Poisoning is a global public health problem. Self-poisoning has potentially serious consequences. Follow-up studies have found that 3-10% of self-harm patients eventually succeed. Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical and economical aspects of deliberate self-poisoning patients admitted to Yenimahalle State Hospital Intensive Care Unit. Patients and Methods: The study was carried out retrospectively in Ankara Yenimahalle State Hospital. It included Seventy-one patients over 16 years of age who were admitted to the hospital due to poisoning during 2012. Exposed poisons were classified into one of three categories; pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and alcohols. Cost account was based on the medical invoices at patient discharge. Data were compared using Studentâs T test and chi-square test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The female/male ratio was 2.55. The mean age of the 71 poisoned patients was 28.92 Â± 11.51 years. Most of the poisoning agents were pharmaceuticals (68 cases). Among the pharmaceuticals, antidepressants were involved most often, followed by analgesics. There was no statistically significant difference between pharmaceutical agents in terms of hospital cost (P > 0.05). The mean length of hospital stay was 6.4 Â± 4.3 days. There was a statistically significant difference between the lengths of stay of patients in terms of hospital cost (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The patient cost increased as the length of stay increased due to the policy of bundle pricing.

H.; Buckley, Nick A.; Gunnell, David\n\n2006-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES: Most data on self-poisoning in rural Asia have come from secondary hospitals. We aimed to: assess how transfers from primary to secondary hospitals affected estimates of case-fatality ratio (CFR); determine whether there was referral bias according to gender or poison; and estimate the annual incidence of all self-poisoning, and of fatal self-poisoning, in a rural developing-world setting. METHODS: Self-poisoning patients admitted to Anuradhapura General Hospital, Sri Lanka, were reviewed on admission from 1 July to 31 December 2002. We audited medical notes of self-poisoning patients admitted to 17 of the 34 surrounding peripheral hospitals for the same period. FINDINGS: A total of 742 patients were admitted with self-poisoning to the secondary hospital; 81 died (CFR 10.9%). 483 patients were admitted to 17 surrounding peripheral hospitals. Six patients (1.2%) died in peripheral hospitals, 249 were discharged home, and 228 were transferred to the secondary hospital. There was no effect of gender or age on likelihood of transfer; however, patients who had ingested oleander or paraquat were more likely to be transferred than were patients who had taken organophosphorus pesticides or other poisons. Estimated annual incidences of self-poisoning and fatal self-poisoning were 363 and 27 per 100,000 population, respectively, with an overall CFR of 7.4% (95% confidence interval 6.0-9.0). CONCLUSION: Fifty per cent of patients admitted to peripheral hospitals were discharged home, showing that CFRs based on secondary hospital data are inflated. However, while incidence of self-poisoning is similar to that in England, fatal self-poisoning is three times more common in Sri Lanka than fatal self-harm by all methods in England. Population based data are essential for making international comparisons of case fatality and incidence, and for assessing public health interventions.

A retrospective investigation was performed in 5859 cases of acute poisonings who were admitted to 63 hospitals in 11 cities, as well as 531 types of poisons involved. The poisons were categorized into 6 groups; each group of cases was stratified by the rural or urban settings, frequency of poisoning, and cause of poisoning to analyze the numbers of cases and constituent ratios. Most types of poisons (68.74%) belonged to drugs (217 types) and pesticides (148 types). Most cases of poisonings (61.63%) were caused by pesticides (n = 2547) and chemicals (n = 1064). Pesticides, poisons of plant origins, and poisons of animal origins were responsible for most of the cases in rural settings; 88.46%, 79.10%, and 66.74% of the cases of these poison categories happened in rural settings. Chemicals, drugs, and other poisons were responsible for most of the cases in urban settings; 70.20%, 61.74%, and 63.73% of the cases of these poison categories happened in urban settings. The numbers of cases in 5-year-poisoning groups were the highest in all categories of poisons, accounting for 85.24%, 88.57%, 55.16%, 70.79%, 68.36%, and 66.44%of cases of respective categories. Most cases of poisonings by chemicals, poisons of animal origin, and other poisons were accident-related (86.24%, 72.66%, and 46.71%of the poison categories). Most cases of poisonings by pesticides and drugs were suicide-related (59.39% and 33.52% of the poison categories). Most cases by poisons of plant origin were caused by accidental ingestion (70.36% of the poison category). Most of the acute poisonings in Guangxi area are caused by pesticides and chemicals; the most common causes of poisoning are accidents, accidental ingestion, and suicide. There are significant differences in the causes of acute poisonings between the urban and rural settings.\n\n\"Suicide\" as Seen in Poison Control Centers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMcIntire, Matilda S.; Angle, Carol R.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nData on age and sex characteristics, intent and diagnosis of suicide, and toxicology are presented for 1,103 cases of poisoning (children ages 6-18 years) admitted to 50 poison control centers during 1 year.

He was admitted to a hospital, but died 37 h later. Dozens of people who had eaten the same box lunch also complained of diarrhea. All of them recovered after medical treatment. A later investigation demonstrated Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) in the gratin from the box lunch. An autopsy revealed very severe typhloenteritis with edema and submucosal hemorrhage. The digestive tract contained fluid contents without foodstuffs. Bacteriological examination revealed SE in the contents of the lower ileum and large intestine. Based on these findings, we concluded that the cause of death was food poisoning due to SE. In this case, ingesting only a small piece of contaminated food caused fatal food poisoning due to SE. These results emphasize the importance of prevention against food poisoning due to Salmonella, particularly SE.\n\n[Lethal myocardial injury associated with hydrogen sulfide poisoning: report of two cases].\n\nPubMed\n\nInoue, Yukinori; Kumagai, Ken; Tanaka, Toshiharu; Yoshida, Satoru; Sekiguchi, Hiroshi; Kobayashi, Kaori; Hirose, Yasuo\n\n2011-09-01\n\nWe investigated two cases of hydrogen sulfide poisoning in which the patients showed lethal myocardial injury. Both patients had planned to commit suicide by inhaling hydrogen sulfide. In case 1, a 17-year-old man was confused and was brought to our hospital by ambulance. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed diffuse elevation of the ST segment on the second hospital day. The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on the 15th day. However, he died suddenly on the 18th day. In case 2, a 21-year-old man was found lying on the floor and was admitted to our hospital. ECG showed tall T waves after 5 hr. Tachycardia and tachypnea occurred after 12 hr. After 16 hr, the ECG showed a marked elevation of the ST segment, and the patient developed cardiac arrest. Even though percutaneous cardiopulmonary support was used, he died on the 4th day. It is highly probable that myocardial injury asscociated with hydrogen sulfide poisoning was not caused by systemic hypoxia but by selective myocardial toxicity. These cases demonstrate that delayed presentation of a lethal myocardial injury should be considered while treating cases of hydrogen sulfide poisoning.\n\nAcute Datura Stramonium poisoning in East of Iran - a case series.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmini, Mahnaz; Khosrojerdi, Hamid; Afshari, Reza\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDatura Stramonium (DS) is a common weed along roadsides, in cornfields and pastures and in waste areas. It belongs to the family Solanaceae and its toxic components are tropane belladonna alkaloids. It has been used voluntarily by teenagers for its hallucinogenic effect. The plant is named in Iran as Tatoore. Symptoms and signs of acute D. Stramonium poisoning usually are similar to anticholinergic syndrome. This study is done in order to clarify the status of this poisoning in our region. This study is a case series on all patients admitted to Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, with acute D. Stramonium poisoning between 2008 and 2011. We observed their symptoms, signs, routine laboratory test results and treatment used to control their symptoms. There were 19 patients included in our study. Children were poisoned more commonly than teenagers and poisoning in adults was rare. All of the children ingested the plant accidentally. The most presenting symptom was irritability and the most common sign was sinus tachycardia. There was not any presentation of seizure or coma. Most of the symptoms were controlled by parenteral benzodiazepines and there were no need to use of cholinergic agents such as physostigmine. Our study showed most of D. Stramonium poisoned population in our region are children. We suggest decreasing accessibility to the plant in order to decrease the incidence of its poisoning.\n\nAn Unusual Cause of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: Narghile Smoking\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAteÅ, Alpay; Arikan, MÃ¼ge; ÃzgÃ¶k, AyÅegÃ¼l\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPatient: Male, 27 Final Diagnosis: Carbon monoxide poisoning Symptoms: Dizziness â¢ nausea â¢ Syncope Medication: â Clinical Procedure: O2 treatment Specialty: Anesthesiology Objective: Challenging differential diagnosis Background: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is commonly seen during the winter season in Turkey due to use of charcoal stoves and water heaters, but narghile smoking is a rare cause of CO poisoning. Case Report: In this paper, we report a CO poisoning case caused by narghile smoking. The patient was admitted to the ED with nausea, dizziness, vertigo, and syncope. Conclusions: The diagnosis of CO poisoning depends on suspicious anamnesis. The major treatment of CO poisoning is oxygen supply.

Our objective was to examine the epidemiology of poisonings among children in Cyprus. All children up to 15 years of age admitted for poisoning to the Archbishop Makarios Hospital in Nicosia, Cyprus between 2005 and 2008 were included in our study. All hospital poisoning records were reviewed. A total of 257 children were admitted for poisoning. The mean age of children was 3.1 years, of which 83.7% were below the age of 5 years old, while 53% were boys. The poisoning hospitalizations accounted for about 3% of all admissions to the pediatric department during the study period (4 years). The annual cumulative incidence of childhood poisoning hospitalizations was 116 per 100,000 children. Medications accounted for 46.1% of all poisonings, the most frequent cause being paracetamol (9.8%), cardiovascular medications (5.3%), antitussive medications (4.5%), and other painkillers (4.1%). Another 37.6% of hospitalizations involved household products such as household cleaning products (11.8%), petroleum products (11.0%), and rodenticides (5.7%). Among children who ingested petroleum distillates, 55.6% developed clinical symptomatology. The vast majority of cases were accidental (93.8%). Suicidal cases involved children 8-14 years old, mainly girls, and the most frequent poisoning ingested was paracetamol (46.7%). Poisoning hospitalizations represent an important cause of morbidity among children in Cyprus. Preventive strategies should include the education of caregivers on the handling of medications and household products as well as legislation requiring child-resistant packaging for all medications and household products including petroleum distillates.\n\nHemlock (Conium Maculatum) Poisoning In A Child.\n\nPubMed\n\nKonca, Capan; Kahramaner, Zelal; Bosnak, Mehmet; Kocamaz, Halil\n\n2014-03-01\n\nPoison hemlock (Conium maculatum) is a plant that is poisonous for humans and animals. Accidental ingestion of the plant may result in central nervous system depression, respiratory failure, acute rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and even death. The main treatment of hemlock poisoning is supportive care. The case of a 6-year-old girl who was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of burning sensation in mouth, hypersalivation, tremor in hands and ataxia after ingestion of poison hemlock is presented here with clinical and laboratory features. In this case, we aim to report that accidental ingestion of plants resembling vegetables that are consumed daily can lead to serious complications and even death.\n\nPesticide poisoning in Chitwan, Nepal: a descriptive epidemiological study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGyenwali, Deepak; Vaidya, Abhinav; Tiwari, Sundar; Khatiwada, Prakash; Lamsal, Daya Ram; Giri, Shrikrishana\n\n2017-07-03\n\nGlobally, there is a growing concern over pesticides use, which has been linked to self-harm and suicide. However, there is paucity of research on the epidemiology of pesticides poisoning in Nepal. This study is aimed at assessing epidemiological features of pesticides poisoning among hospital-admitted cases in selected hospitals of Chitwan District of Nepal. A hospital-based quantitative study was carried out in four major hospitals of Chitwan District. Information on all pesticides poisoning cases between April 1 and December 31, 2015, was recorded by using a Pesticides Exposure Record (PER) form. A total of 439 acute pesticides poisoning cases from 12 districts including Chitwan and adjoining districts attended the hospitals during the 9-month-long study period. A majority of the poisoned subjects deliberately used pesticides (89.5%) for attempted suicide. The total incidence rate was 62.67/100000 population per year. Higher annual incidence rates were found among young adults (111.66/100000 population), women (77.53/100000 population) and individuals from Dalit ethnic groups (98.22/100000 population). Pesticides responsible for poisoning were mostly insecticides (58.0%) and rodenticides (20.8%). The most used chemicals were organophosphates (37.3%) and pyrethroids (36.7%). Of the total cases, 98.6% were hospitalized, with intensive care required for 41.3%. The case fatality rate among admitted cases was 3.8%. This study has indicated that young adults, females and socially disadvantaged ethnic groups are at a higher risk of pesticides poisoning. Pesticides are mostly misused intentionally as an easy means for committing suicide. It is recommended that the supply of pesticides be properly regulated to prevent easy accessibility and misuse. A population-based study is warranted to reveal the actual problem of pesticides exposure and intoxication in the community.\n\nRisk factors for acute pesticide poisoning in Sri Lanka.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan der Hoek, Wim; Konradsen, Flemming\n\n2005-06-01\n\nThis report describes the characteristics of patients with acute pesticide poisoning in a rural area of Sri Lanka and, for intentional self-poisoning cases, explores the relative importance of the different determinants. Data were collected for 239 acute pesticide-poisoning cases, which were admitted to two rural hospitals in Sri Lanka. Sociodemographic characteristics, negative life events and agricultural practices of the intentional self-poisoning cases were compared with a control group. Most cases occurred among young adults and the large majority (84%) was because of intentional self-poisoning. Case fatality was 18% with extremely high case fatality for poisoning with the insecticide endosulfan and the herbicide paraquat. Cases were generally younger than controls, of lower educational status and were more often unemployed. No agricultural risk factors were found but a family history of pesticide poisoning and having ended an emotional relationship in the past year was clearly associated with intentional self-poisoning. The presence of mental disorders could only be assessed for a subsample of the cases and controls and this showed that alcohol dependence was a risk factor. This study shows that acute pesticide poisoning in Sri Lanka is determined by a combination of sociodemographic and psychological factors. Suggestions are given for interventions that could control the morbidity and mortality due to acute pesticide poisoning in developing countries.\n\n[Plant poisoning cases in Turkey].\n\nPubMed\n\nOztekin-Mat, A\n\n1994-01-01\n\nIn Turkey, the majority of the population live in rural areas where they use wild plants as food and medicine. The confusion of an edible plant with a poisonous one give rise to serious poisoning which may even result in death. The incidence of plant poisoning in Turkey is about 6% and especially high among children between ages of 2 and 11 living in rural areas. The number of species that cause poisoning is around twenty and Hyoscyamus niger (Solanaceae), Colchicum species (Liliaceae), Conium maculatum (Umbelliferae) and Prunus species (Rosaceae) are the most important. Mushroom poisoning is more frequent in spring and fall. The main reasons are their widespread usage as food and the inexperience of the gatherers in distinguishing the edibles from the poisonous. Amanita phalloides, A. verna, A. muscaria, A. pantherina are responsible for severe cases of poisoning.\n\nOrganophosphate acetylcholine esterase inhibitor poisoning from a home-made shampoo\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSadaka, Yair; Broides, Arnon; Tzion, Raffi Lev; Lifshitz, Matitiahu\n\n2011-01-01\n\nOrganophosphate acetylcholine esterase inhibitor poisoning is a major health problem in children. We report an unusual cause of organophosphate acetylcholine esterase inhibitor poisoning. Two children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit due to organophosphate acetylcholine esterase inhibitor poisoning after exposure from a home-made shampoo that was used for the treatment of head lice. Owing to no obvious source of poisoning, the diagnosis of organophosphate acetylcholine esterase inhibitor poisoning in one of these patients was delayed. Both patients had an uneventful recovery. Organophosphate acetylcholine esterase inhibitor poisoning from home-made shampoo is possible. In cases where the mode of poisoning is unclear, direct questioning about the use of home-made shampoo is warranted, in these cases the skin and particularly the scalp should be rinsed thoroughly as soon as possible.

No acute human poisoning with octogen has ever been reported. A 28-year-old man with no history of epilepsy was admitted to the Emergency Department for seizures that had developed during the night after a full working day when he manually sieved large amounts of dry octogen. On admission, the clinical examination was normal and all other examinations could not substantiate the development of essential or secondary epilepsy. Elevated octogen concentrations were measured in his plasma, which confirmed occupational exposure to the explosive. The rarity of acute human poisonings by octogen is due to the infrequent use of this explosive and, more importantly, its very low oral bioavailability. However, acute poisoning can occur, but should be easily avoided by implementing adequate preventive measures.\n\nPattern of acute food, drug, and chemical poisoning in Sari City, Northern Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhmadi, Amirhossein; Pakravan, Nasrin; Ghazizadeh, Zeynab\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThis descriptive and retrospective study was conducted at the poisoning ward of Imam teaching hospital, Sari, Iran, with the aim of evaluating the pattern of poisoning. Hence, the medical profiles of 2057 patients, who were admitted, were carefully reviewed during the period from April 2006 to March 2008 for 2 years. During this period, 2057 cases, 53.9% female and 46.1% male, were admitted with the indication of acute poisoning. The greatest proportion of poisoning occurred between the ages of 18 and 29 years, with suicidal intentions. Most cases of poisoning were intentional (85%). The most common agents involved in acute poisoning were drugs (77.7%), especially sedatives/hypnotics such as benzodiazepines, followed by opioid analgesics. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides were the third major agent that induced poisoning. Twenty-seven patients (1.3%) who were mostly females and young adults died. Death mostly occurred due to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides (19 cases) poisoning, followed by sedatives/hypnotics like benzodiazepines (3 cases). High prevalence of intentional overdose and mortality among young adults requires considerable attention and further studies to find out the underlying causes. In addition, strict rules must be followed regarding the sale of central nervous system drugs and pesticides, particularly organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. Establishing poison information centers in different parts of the country, preparing national treatment guidelines, training healthcare providers, and ensuring easy availability of the antidotes are also recommended.\n\nRecreational phenethylamine poisonings reported to a French poison control center.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Roux, GaÃ«l; Bruneau, ChloÃ©; LeliÃ¨vre, BÃ©nÃ©dicte; Bretaudeau Deguigne, Marie; Turcant, Alain; Harry, Patrick; Boels, David\n\n2015-09-01\n\nOver the last decade, use of phenethylamines has become increasingly prevalent. This study aimed to describe typical aspects of phenethylamine poisoning in order to better inform patient care. Phenethylamine poisoning cases reported to the Poison Control Center of Angers, France, from January, 2007 to December, 2013 were examined. Clinical findings were examined in 105 patients, including phenethylamine used, symptoms and final outcome. Patients were predominantly male (80%), with mean age 26Â±8 years. MDMA (38%), amphetamine (18%) and methamphetamine (14%) were the most commonly reported. Synthetic cathinones (10%) and the 2C series (7%) were also found. Substances most commonly associated with phenethylamine poisoning were cannabis (27%), ethanol (20%) and cocaine (9%). The most frequently reported symptoms included anxiety and hallucinations (49%), mydriasis and headache (41%), tachycardia (40%) and hypertension (15%). Complications such as seizures (7%), cardiac arrest (5%), toxic myocarditis (1%) and hemorrhagic stroke (1%) were also observed. Of the cases, the Poison Severity Score was: null or low, 66%, moderate, 21%, severe or fatal, 13%. Of the patients, 77% received hospital care and 12.4% were admitted to an intensive care unit. Analytical confirmations were obtained for all severe cases. While 93% of patients recovered, there were 5 deaths and 2 patients presented with neurological sequelae. Phenethylamine poisonings may be severe in young and healthy individuals. Physicians, toxicologists and analysts should be aware of new phenethylamine consumption trends in order to inform management of patient care and to contribute to a more responsive drug policy.

Methods: The patients with paraquat poisoning who were admitted to our department in recent two years were observed to screen out the patients with large vessel thrombosis. The data on toxic exposure history, clinical features, and treatment were collected to analyze the causes of thrombosis in the patients with paraquat poisoning. Results: Three patients had typical lower limb thrombosis. There was one case of right common femoral vein thrombosis, one case of bilateral calf muscle vein thrombosis, and one case of right calf superficial vein thrombosis and right calf muscle vein thrombosis. Conclusions: After paraquat poisoning, the blood is in a hypercoagulable state and prolonged bed rest may increase the risk of thrombosis.\n\nFATAL HONEY POISONING IN SOUTHWEST CHINA: A CASE SERIES OF 31 CASES.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Qiang; Chen, Xinguang; Chen, Shunan; Ye, Yinlong; Luo, Jiancheng; Li, Juanjuan; Yu, Siyang; Liu, Hui; Liu, Zhitao\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHoney poisoning cases occur in southwestern China. In this case series, we attempted to determine the symptoms and causes of honey poisoning from 2007 to 2012 in southwestern China. We also conducted a quantitative melissopalynological analysis of honey samples. During the study period, 31 honey poisoning cases occurred in the study location, all during July to August. All the cases occurred after consuming at least 100 grams of honey. The most frequent symptoms were nausea and vomiting (100%), abdominal pain (90.3%), diarrhea (74.2%), palpitations (61.3%), dizziness (54.8%), chest congestion (48.4%) and dyspnea (48.4%). Severe cases developed oliguria/anuria, twitch, hematuria, ecchymosis or hematochezia. The median time from ingestion to onset of symptoms was 29 hours. Eight patients died (mortality rate: 25.8%). The pollen of Tripterygium hypoglaucum (a plant with poisonous nectar and pollen) was detected in 22 of 29 honey samples examined (75.9%). The results of pollen analysis were consistent with the clinical findings of previous cases. T. hypoglaucum appears to be the cause of honey poisoning in southwestern China. Honey poisoning should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients who consume honey in this region and develop symptoms of food poisoning.\n\n[Forensic Analysis for 54 Cases of Suxamethonium Chloride Poisoning].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Y F; Zhao, B Q; Ma, K J; Zhang, J; Chen, F Y\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo observe and analyze the performance of forensic science in the cases of suxa- methonium chloride poisoning, and to improve the identification of suxamethonium chloride poisoning. Fifty-four cases of suxamethonium chloride poisoning were collected. The rules of determination of suxamethonium chloride poisoning were observed by the retrospective analysis of pathological and toxicological changes as well as case features. The pathological features of suxamethonium chloride poisoning were similar to the general changes of sudden death, which mainly included acute pulmonary congestion and edema, and partly showed myocardial disarray and fracture. Suxamethonium chloride could be detected in the heart blood of all cases and in skin tissue of part cases. Suxa-methonium chloride poisoning has the characteristics with fast death and covert means, which are difficult to rescue and easily miss inspection. For the cases of sudden death or suspicious death, determination of suxamethonium chloride should be taken as a routine detection index to prevent missing inspection.

The records of patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with acute poisoning between November 1985 and October 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. The records of 2251 patients with acute poisoning could be retrieved. Poisoning mostly occurred in the home (92%), via the oral route (92.5%) and by a single intoxicant (81.3%). Two distinct peaks were observed: in boys between 1-5 years of age and in girls between 13-16 years of age. It was noted that 67.4% of poisoning cases were accidental, whereas 25.9% were suicidal and 6.7% were a result of a therapeutic error. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of cases were drug-related, while 36% were non-drug-related. Analgesics-antipyretics ranked first among the drug-related cases, whereas ingestion of a corrosive substance was most common among cases with non-drug poisoning. Colchicine was associated with the highest fatality, while among the causes of non-drug poisoning, carbon monoxide was the deadliest. The overall mortality rate in this study was 1.9%. Mortality from non-drug poisoning was higher than from drug-related causes (3.9% vs. 1.3%). Almost all cases of poisoning below the age of 6 years are potentially preventable. The results of this study highlight the need for reforms in industrial and health policies, with the aim of increasing awareness regarding potential toxins, appropriate storage of potential toxins, and general precautions to promote safety in the home.\n\nAgreement between questionnaire and medical records on some health and socioeconomic problems among poisoning cases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFathelrahman, Ahmed I\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the agreement between questionnaire and medical records on some health and socioeconomic problems among poisoning cases. Methods Cross-sectional sample of 100 poisoning cases consecutively admitted to the Hospital Pulau Pinang, Malaysia during the period from September 2003 to February 2004 were studied. Data on health and socioeconomic problems were collected both by self-administered questionnaire and from medical records. Agreement between the two sets of data was assessed by calculating the concordance rate, Kappa (k) and PABAK. McNemar statistic was used to test differences between categories. Results Data collected by questionnaire and medical records showed excellent agreement on the \"marital status\"; good agreements on \"chronic illness\", \"psychiatric illness\", and \"previous history of poisoning\"; and fair agreements on \"at least one health problem\", and \"boy-girl friends problem\". PABAK values suggest better agreements' measures. Conclusion There were excellent to good agreements between questionnaire and medical records on the marital status and most of the health problems and fair to poor agreements on the majority of socioeconomic problems. The implications of those findings were discussed.

In Malaysia, nationwide data on poisoning pattern is scarce and incomplete. The objectives of our study were to determine the pattern of acute drug and chemical poisoning at Penang General Hospital (PGH), in the northern region of Malaysia, and to compare poisoning characteristics between different ethnic groups. The study was a retrospective case review of all poisoned patients admitted to PGH during the years 2000-2002. We collected data concerning demographic parameters of patients, information about the agent(s) implicated, and circumstances surrounding the event. There were 493 poisoning incidents. Nearly two-thirds of the poisoned cases involved female patients. The predominant mode of poisoning was intentional (51.5%). The age group 15.1-30 years ranked at the top, constituting 55.2% of all cases. Drugs were the predominant agents implicated. Among cases associated with drugs, paracetamol was the main causative agent (44.7%). Chinese patients constituted 37.7% of all poisoning cases, followed by the Indians (31.6%) and Malays (26.6%). Between ethnic groups, Indian patients were found to have the highest rate of poisoning admission of 75.2 per 100,000 persons.\n\nPesticide poisoning in south India: opportunities for prevention and improved medical management.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrinivas Rao, Ch; Venkateswarlu, V; Surender, T; Eddleston, Michael; Buckley, Nick A\n\n2005-06-01\n\nWarangal district in Andhra Pradesh, southern India, records >1000 pesticide poisoning cases each year and hundreds of deaths. We aimed to describe their frequency and distribution, and to assess quality of management and subsequent outcomes from pesticide poisoning in one large hospital in the district. We reviewed data on all patients admitted with pesticide poisoning to a district government hospital for the years 1997 to 2002. For 2002, details of the particular pesticide ingested and management were abstracted from the medical files. During these 6 years, 8040 patients were admitted to the hospital with pesticide poisoning. The overall case fatality ratio was 22.6%. More detailed data from 2002 revealed that two-thirds of the patients were <30 years old, 57% were male and 96% had intentionally poisoned themselves. Two compounds, monocrotophos and endosulfan, accounted for the majority of deaths with known pesticides in 2002. Low fixed-dose regimens were used in the majority of cases for the most commonly used antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime). Inappropriate antidotes were also used in some patients. It is likely that these findings reflect the situation in many rural hospitals of the Asia Pacific region. Even without an increase in resources, there appear to be significant opportunities for reducing mortality by better medical management and further restrictions on the most toxic pesticides.\n\nScombroid poisoning: mini-review with case histories.\n\nPubMed\n\nRussell, F E; MaretiÄ, Z\n\n1986-01-01\n\nScombroid poisoning has become an almost world-wide medical problem. It is probably the most common cause of fish poisoning, although frequently misdiagnosed as \"Salmonella infection'. While there remains some question as to the definitive etiology, there is little doubt that the poisoning is caused by the ingestion of certain mackerel-like fishes whose tissues have undergone a number of changes provoked by bacteria, and involving the conversion of histidine to histamine, potentiated by diamines. Improper storage of the fishes, usually at temperatures above 20 degrees C, appears to be the most important predisposing factor. The organisms most commonly involved are Proteus sp., Clostridium sp., Escherichia sp., Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp. Twenty-five cases of scombroid poisoning are presented. The clinical manifestations were very similar in most cases, consisting of: alterations in taste; anxiety; hyperemia, particularly of the face and neck; nausea; pruritus; headache; certain other symptoms and signs. Most patients responded to antihistamitics, and all cases were self-limiting.\n\n[Poisoning with Jatropha curcas: 24 cases reported to Paris and Marseille Poisons Centers].\n\nPubMed\n\nLangrand, J; MÃ©dernach, C; Schmitt, C; Blanc-Brisset, I; Villa, A F; de Haro, L; Garnier, R\n\n2015-03-01\n\nJatropha curcas L. is an inedible plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family that is growing in subtropical zones of all continents. We report a series of 24 cases of poisoning with J. curcas seeds or fruits reported to poison centers in Paris and Marseille between December 2000 and June 2014. Fifteen adults and 9 children ingested J. curcas seeds or fruits. All patients experienced gastrointestinal disorders, within the first hours following ingestion: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Laboratory investigations performed in 10 patients revealed minor abnormalities: CK elevation (8 cases), dehydration (5 cases) with moderate elevation of serum creatinine levels (3 cases), and mildly increased serum bilirubin (8 cases). Complete remission of all clinical signs was observed within 48 hours in the 20 cases for which the outcome was known. Previously published cases of J. curcas poisoning were very similar to ours: As in our series, gastrointestinal disorders were always present. They were sometimes associated with neurological or cardiovascular signs, and hepatic or renal disorders; these were generally interpreted as complications of severe gastroenteritis, although direct toxic effects could not be formally excluded. In most cases, simple supportive measures were sufficient to ensure complete recovery within 24-48 hours. J Curcas poisoning incidence is certainly increasing because the plant is cultivated to produce biodiesel and is now largely present in most subtropical countries. As a consequence, local health professionals should be informed of the toxic properties of this plant.\n\nChanging pattern of poisoning in children in Newcastle, 1974-81.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLawson, G R; Craft, A W; Jackson, R H\n\n1983-01-01\n\nAll children aged under 15 years admitted to hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1974 and 1981 with a diagnosis of poisoning were studied. After the introduction in 1976 of child resistant containers for salicylates and paracetamol, salicylate poisonings fell dramatically. The other most important medicines to cause poisoning in young children were tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazapines, Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropine), and iron preparations; these should also be packaged in child resistant containers by regulation. Few children had symptoms after poisoning with household products, but bleach, turpentine, and paraffin might also be packaged in child resistant containers. The numbers of adolescent girls admitted after deliberate self poisoning and of teenage boys admitted after ingestion of alcohol increased over the study period.

The patient underwent intensive hemoperfusion for 2 h (3 times a day) for 9 consecutive days and received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in the mode of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for 10 consecutive days in addition to routine medications. The biochemical indexes were monitored during the therapy. After the treatment, paraquat concentrations in the blood and urine were decreased, and the patient's urine volume (UV) increased, serum creatinine (Cr) level decreased, and the oxygenation index became normal. Dynamic CT scan showed no obvious pulmonary fibrosis. The patient was followed up for 6 months after discharge and no complaint of discomforts was reported. This case suggests that early intensive hemoperfusion and long-term CVVH may help improve the prognosis after paraquat poisoning.\n\nPesticide Poisoning in South India â Opportunities for Prevention and Improved Medical Management\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRao, CH Srinivas; Venkateswarlu, V; Surender, T; Eddleston, Michael; Buckley, Nick A\n\n2006-01-01\n\nObjective Warangal district in Andhra Pradesh, southern India, records over one thousand pesticide poisoning cases each year and hundreds of deaths.

We report 3 cases of scombroid poisoning seen at the FrÃ©jus-Saint-RaphaÃ«l hospital in the Var region. Within around thirty minutes of eating a meal containing tuna, three patients presented varied symptoms: malaise, itchy rash, headache, and for two of them, nausea. The diagnosis of scombroid poisoning was based on the circumstances in which the clinical signs appeared and on the signs themselves. The patients were given antihistamines and one injection of intravenous corticosteroids, and symptoms regressed rapidly within a few hours. The symptoms of scombroid poisoning appear within a few minutes after eating fish of the Scombridae family and related species. The first symptoms are cutaneous, with flush, pruritus, and erythema of the face and trunk having an urticarial appearance, together with faintness. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and occasionally diarrhea. Symptoms subside within a few hours. Histamine is present in the flesh of these fish due to decarboxylation of histidine through the action of Gram-negative bacteria whose development is enhanced by heat and sun. Scombroid poisoning is one of the most common types of poisoning caused by eating fish but it is underdiagnosed by dermatologists. The diagnosis is made by measuring histamine levels in the incriminated fish or in the patient's plasma. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Quick diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent renal failure and life-threating complications. CASE REPORT In this case report, we present a patient who was admitted unconscious to the hospital. Ethylene glycol poisoning was immediately suspected, because the patient had previously been hospitalized with similar symptoms after intake of antifreeze coolant. A urine sample was sent for microscopy and showed multiple calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals, which supported the clinical suspicion of ethylene glycol poisoning. The patient was treated with continuous intravenous ethyl alcohol infusion and hemodialysis. Two days after admission, the patient was awake and in clinical recovery. CONCLUSIONS Demonstration of COM crystals using microscopy of a urine sample adds valuable information supporting the clinical suspicion of ethylene glycol poisoning, and may serve as an easy, quick, and cheap method that can be performed in any emergency setting.\n\nDeliberate drug poisonings admitted to an emergency department in Paris area - a descriptive study and assessment of risk factors for intensive care admission.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeaune, S; Juvin, P; Beauchet, A; Casalino, E; Megarbane, B\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEach year, approximately 165,000 poisonings are managed in the emergency departments (ED) in France. We performed a descriptive analysis of self-poisoned patients admitted to a university hospital ED in the Paris metropolitan area (France) aimed at investigating their outcome and the risk factors for transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). We retrospectively reviewed patients' records and performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for ICU admission. During 4 years, 882 self-poisoned patients (median age, 38 years [IQR, 26-47]; sex-ratio, 1M/3F) were admitted to the ED, representing 0.7% of all referred patients. Poisonings mainly resulted from multidrug exposures (53%), including benzodiazepines (78%), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (17%), acetaminophen (13%), antipsychotics (9.5%), imidazopyridines (9.5%), antihypertensive drugs (3%), and polycyclic antidepressants (1.3%). Ethanol was involved in 20% of the exposures. Patients were briefly (<24h) monitored in the ED (55%), transferred to the psychiatric department (30%), medical ward (2%) or ICU (6%), and took an irregular discharge (7%). Among the patients transferred to the ICU, 25% were mechanically ventilated and only one died. Risk factors for ICU admission included antihypertensive (Odds ratio (OR), 40.6; 95%-confidence interval (CI), 7.5-221.9) or antipsychotic drug ingestion (OR, 5.3; CI, 2.0-14.4), male gender (OR, 3.3; CI, 1.30-8.8), and consciousness impairment (OR, 2.1; CI, 1.8-2.5 per point lost in Glasgow coma score). Deliberate drug exposure represents a frequent cause of ED admission. Psychotropic drugs are most commonly involved. Transfer to the ICU is rare and predicted by male gender, drug class, and coma depth.\n\nAcute renal failure in acute poisoning: prospective study from a tertiary care centre of South India.\n\nPubMed\n\nSweni, Shah; Meenakshisundaram, Ramachandran; Sakthirajan, R; Rajendiran, Chinnasamy; Thirumalaikolundusubramanian, Ponniah\n\n2012-03-01\n\nCases of people presenting with poisoning are likely to develop acute renal failure (ARF), which may be due to multiple mechanisms/aetiologies. These cases need careful observation and appropriate treatment. To find the risk of ARF among acute poisoning cases, identify the underlying causes and to analyse the outcome. In this prospective study with nested case control, 1,250 cases admitted to the Poison Control, Training and Research Centre of Government General Hospital, Madras Medical College were monitored and evaluated for development of ARF. Patients with history of diabetes/hypertension, known chronic kidney disease, chronic NSAID therapy, those on drugs that increase serum creatinine by inhibiting creatinine secretion and other co-morbid illnesses were excluded. Data were interpreted after subjecting them to bivariate logistic regression and then step wise multivariate analysis. Thirty-two cases developed ARF. Twenty-four were due to snake bite, the rest due to chemical poisons. Chances of developing ARF were greater (6.15%) among the poisoning due to bites and stings than chemical poisoning (0.9%). Five in the former and seven in the latter expired. Among cases bitten by snakes, only 22 (7%) cases bitten by Russell Viper Daboia russelii developed renal failure. Copper sulphate and rat killer poisonings were the commonest causes of chemical induced ARF, dichromate, indigenous medicines and vasmol 33 (paraphenelyne diamine) were the least causes for ARF. None of the patients with organophosphate developed ARF nor did any of the 150 admitted for overdose of medicines developed ARF. The risk of ARF among the cases of poisoning was 2.5%. The outcome of ARF among bites and stings was better than chemical poisoning, and the difference was highly significant (p= 0.005, OR = 0.04-1.0, 95% CI = 0.004-0.38). Early recognition and appropriate measures reduce the occurrence of ARF.

Only 17% of 6600 cases were then identified by the species. The present retrospective study was designed to identify the epidemiology of mushroom poisoning in adults admitted to Krakow's Department of Clinical Toxicology (DCT) from 2002 to 2009. This study was conducted retrospectively after examining the files of 457 adult patients with wild mushroom poisoning. Mycological analysis was made and the species of the poisoning-inducing mushroom was determined. Furthermore, the circumstances related to the mushroom gathering, transport, storage, preparation, and consumption have been analyzed. The analysis revealed that in 400 (87.53%) out of 457 cases, the clinical symptoms were caused by ingestion of identified edible mushroom species. The main reason for edible mushroom poisoning is associated with their incorrect processing after harvest. The analysis of the circumstances of mushroom collection, transport, and storage shows that the largest percentage of poisoning was connected with long-term storage of mushroom dishes, collecting, and storing them in plastic bags, and long storage of mushrooms. Based on spore analysis of the gastric content, edible mushrooms were responsible for the great majority of mushroom poisoning cases admitted to the DCT. The toxicity of edible mushroom is associated with proceeding with them during collection, transport, and storage. The medical history should be supplemented by questions concerning these circumstances. The identification of the mushroom by a mycologist is highly desirable.

The patients were predominantly female (68.9%) and relatively young (86.3% below the age of 40). Further analysis of 655 patients indicates that the vast majority of patients (96%) were admitted after self-poisoning with drugs or chemicals while 4% of cases were due to accidental poisoning. The main agents used by the former group included hypnotics/sedatives (33.1%), household products (15.7%), and analgesics (13.7%). There were nine deaths (1.4%). When compared to other Western countries, two important variations in the pattern of acute poisoning were seen. A substantial proportion of drugs ingested by our patients were not precisely identified. 'Dettol', a household product, was commonly used for self-poisoning in Hong Kong. Territory-wide studies of longer duration are needed to provide the physicians in Hong Kong with much needed information on the incidence and the pattern of acute poisoning.\n\nPoison prevention practices and medically attended poisoning in young children: multicentre case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKendrick, Denise; Majsak-Newman, Gosia; Benford, Penny; Coupland, Carol; Timblin, Clare; Hayes, Mike; Goodenough, Trudy; Hawkins, Adrian; Reading, Richard\n\n2017-04-01\n\nChildhood poisonings are common, placing a substantial burden on health services. Case-control studies have found inconsistent evidence about modifiable risk factors for poisonings among children aged 0-4â years. This study quantifies associations between poison prevention practices and medically attended poisonings in children aged 0-4â years. Multicentre case-control study conducted at hospitals, minor injury units and family practices from four study centres in England between 2010 and 2013. Participants comprised 567 children presenting with unintentional poisoning occurring at home and 2320 community control participants matched on age, sex, date of event and study centre. Parents/caregivers provided data on safety practices, safety equipment use, home hazards and potential confounders by means of self-completion questionnaires. Data were analysed using conditional logistic regression. Compared with community controls, parents of poisoned children were significantly more likely not to store medicines out of reach (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.59; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.09; population attributable fraction (PAF) 15%), not to store medicines safely (locked or out of reach (AOR 1.83; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.42; PAF 16%) and not to have put all medicines (AOR 2.11; 95% CI 1.54 to 2.90; PAF 20%) or household products (AOR 1.79, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.48; PAF 11%) away immediately after use. Not storing medicines out of reach or locked away and not putting medicines and household products away immediately after use increased the odds of secondary care attended poisonings in children aged 0-4â years. If associations are causal, implementing these poison prevention practices could each prevent between 11% and 20% of poisonings. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

A retrospective study was conducted. The data of acute poisoning cases and the causative toxins collected from 63 hospitals of Guangxi, including 36 city hospitals, 12 county hospitals, and 15 township health centers from January 2005 to December 2009 were collected. The data were descriptively analyzed and classified by year. A total of 6005 cases with acute poisoning induced by 532 kinds of poisons were enrolled. The 532 kinds of toxin were classified by high-occurrence (producing poisoning for 5 continuous years), low-occurrence (leading to poisoning for 2-4 continuous years) and newly occurred categories (leading to poisoning only in 1 year). The numbers of poisons of these 3 categories accounted for 10.15% (54 kinds), 29.70% (158 kinds), 60.15% (320 kinds) of total number of poisons, respectively. There were 4688 (78.07%), 780 (12.99%), and 537 (8.94%) cases for each category respectively. And the poisoning cases of each toxin involved from 8 to 837, 2 to 25, and 1 to 69 cases respectively. 77.78% (42/54) of high-occurrence poisons affect more than 20 cases, and 89.87% (142/158), 98.75% (316/320) of low-occurrence and new-occurrence poisons involved less than 10 cases. In the dynamic analyses for 5 years, frequency of toxin caused by high-occurrence, low-occurrence and newly occurred poisons in 5 years were 5 times, 2.6 times, and 1 time, respectively. The number of poisons caused by the high-occurrence toxin each year were same, but the average-annual growth rates of poison numbers caused by the low-occurrence and new-occurrence poisons each year were 17.61% and 20.10%. The average-annual growth rates of poisoning cases caused by the 3 categories of poisons were 14.08%, 16.53%, 31.96%, and the average-annual growth rates of poisoning cases caused by each categories were 10.28%, 1.13%, 11.45%, respectively. In the high-occurrence category, the poison species\n\nPredictors for delayed encephalopathy following acute carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground In Japan, many carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning cases are transported to emergency settings, making treatment and prognostic assessment an urgent task. However, there is currently no reliable means to predict whether âdelayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS)â will develop after acute CO poisoning. This study is intended to find out risk factors for the development of DNS and to characterize the clinical course following the development of DNS in acute CO poisoning cases. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 79 consecutive patients treated at a single institution for CO poisoning. This study included 79 cases of acute CO poisoning admitted to our emergency department after attempted suicide, who were divided into two groups consisting of 13 cases who developed DNS and 66 cases who did not. The two groups were compared and analyzed in terms of clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, etc. Results Predictors for the development of DNS following acute CO poisoning included: serious consciousness disturbance at emergency admission; head CT findings indicating hypoxic encephalopathy; hematology findings including high creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB and lactate dehydrogenase levels; and low Global Assessment Scale scores. The clinical course of the DNS-developing cases was characterized by prolonged hospital stay and a larger number of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy sessions. Conclusion In patients with the characteristics identified in this study, administration of HBO therapy should be proactively considered after informing their family, at initial stage, of the risk of developing DNS, and at least 5Â weeksâ follow-up to watch for the development of DNS is considered necessary.

In a factory in which old aeroplane batteries containing zinc mercury amalgam were substituted, it was not realized that mercury vapour was being produced. Of 25 workers exposed, seven developed serious chronic mercury poisoning and were admitted to hospital. The clinical findings in the affected workers are described. They were first treated with penicillamine D, but in all but one case this had to be stopped because of rashes. Little improvement followed a switch to B.A.L. It is suggested that if penicillamine D is used in the treatment of mercury poisoning, steroid cover should be given from the start.

Registration data of pesticide poisoning from 2002 to 2010 in Wuhan were collected and statistically analyzed by SAS 9.1. During the nine years, there were 4713 cases reported for pesticide poisoning. Among them, the number of occupational poisoning was 2737 (2 cases died), with fatality rate of 0.07%. The number of non-occupational poisoning was 1976 (159 cases died), and its fatality rate was 8.05%. The incidence of occupational poisoning and non-occupational poisoning accounted for 58.1% and 41.9%, respectively. Insecticides especially organophosphorus insecticides, such as parathion, dichlorvos, and methamidophos accounted for 70.6% of the poisoning. Occupational poisoning took place mainly in man, accounting for 68.8%, Non-occupational or life poisoning in contrast mainly occurred in women with a proportion of 66.8%. The majority of the occupational poisoning were 30-59 year-old patients (2239 cases, 81.8%). The majority of the non-occupational poisoning were 30-44 year-old patients (665 cases, 33.6%) and - 70 years old patients (209 cases, 10.6%). High incidence of occupational pesticide poisoning, the regional distribution of Caidian (1016 cases, 37.1% ) highest, followed by the Dongxihu, Hannan and Huangpi. The pesticide poisoning mainly occurred from July to September. The occupational poisoning was mainly caused by poor protection, long working hours, and practice not implemented. The non-occupational poisoning was mainly caused by suicide. The majority of the occupational poisoning in Wuhan was middle-aged men. The pesticide poisoning was main caused by insecticides.\n\nSurvey of pesticide poisoning in Sri Lanka\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJeyaratnam, J.; Seneviratne, R. S. de Alwis; Copplestone, J. F.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThis study included a sample survey of the clinical records of patients admitted to the different hospitals in Sri Lanka, and showed that approximately 13 000 patients are admitted to hospital annually for pesticide poisoning and that each year 1000 of them die. Suicidal attempts account for 73% of the total, and occupational and accidental poisoning accounts for 24.9%. It is recommended that urgent action be taken to minimize the extent of the problem.

Disease entity, documentation, and aspects of the event].\n\nPubMed\n\nHahn, A; Begemann, K; StÃ¼rer, A\n\n2014-06-01\n\nCases of poisoning account for a distinct share of accidents in Germany, which is particularly high for accidents involving children. Cases of poisoning resulting from suicidal intent or abuse are not counted as accidents. Compared to other cases of disease and accidents, the numerical documentation of cases of poisoning is inadequate. Presently, there is no institution in Germany that could make available representative and meaningful data on the current state of poisoning. Owing to intensive scientific cooperation between the poison information centers (funded by the federal states) and the Poison and Product Documentation Center at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR DocCenter) as well as to international cooperation, harmonized and standardized tools have been developed for the appropriate documentation and reporting of procedures to account for poisoning accidents. The first evaluation for 2005-2012 based on published and processed figures for the Federal Republic of Germany yielded the following results: Of approximately 230,000 telephone inquiries received in 2012, about 207,000 involved exposure of humans to different noxae. An annual increase of 3-5â% was recorded. For 2011, analyses of subsets processed by means of standardized methods yielded the following results: Medicines were involved in about 39â% of the cases recorded (of these, medicinal products for humans in 99â%); chemical/physicochemical agents in about 26â% (of these, cleaning and maintenance products in 46â%); products of daily use in about 14â% (of these, cosmetics in 40â%); and plants in about 10â%. More than 90â% of cases were acute poisoning and less than 5â%, chronic poisoning. Regarding the degree of severity of poisoning, an asymptomatic course was reported for 44â% of the cases; minor manifestations were experienced in 30â%, moderate ones in 6â%, and severe manifestations in 2â% of the cases recorded. Fatal cases were rare (<â0.1â%).

To consider primary prevention of this pathology, which can have extremely severe consequences. To analyse circumstances resulting in toxic exposure to phosphine in the sea transport sector. To obtain information from medical reports regarding the seafarer's rescue. To identify the causes of this accidental poisoning and how to establish an early, appropriate diagnosis thus avoiding other cases. In February 2008, on board a bulk carrier with a cargo of peas, a 56-year-old seafarer with intense abdominal and chest pains, associated with dizziness, was rescued by helicopter 80 miles away from the coast. Despite being admitted rapidly to hospital, his heart rate decreased associated with respiratory distress. He lost consciousness and convulsed. He finally died of pulmonary oedema, major metabolic acidosis and acute multi organ failure. The following day, the captain issued a rescue call from the same vessel for a 41-year-old man also with abdominal pain, vomiting and dizziness. The ECG only revealed type 1 Brugada syndrome. Then 11 other seafarers were evacuated for observation. 3 showed clinical abnormalities. Collective poisoning was suspected. Medical team found out that aluminium phosphide pellets had been put in the ship's hold for pest control before the vessel's departure. Seafarers were poisoned by phosphine gas spreading through cabins above the hold. It was found that the compartments and ducts were not airtight. Unfortunately, a seafarer on board a bulk carrier died in 2008 because of acute phosphine poisoning. Fumigation performed using this gas needs to be done with extreme care. Systematic checks need to be carried out before sailing to ensure that the vessel's compartments are airtight.\n\nAcute organophosphorus poisoning complicated by acute coronary syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nPankaj, Madhu; Krishna, Kavita\n\n2014-07-01\n\nWe report a case of 30 year old alcoholic male admitted with vomiting, drowsiness, limb weakness and fasciculations after alleged history of consumption of 30 ml of chlorpyriphos insecticide. He had low serum cholinesterase levels. With standard treatment for organophosphorus poisoning (OPP), he improved gradually until day 5, when he developed neck and limb weakness and respiratory distress. This intermediate syndrome was treated with oximes, atropine and artificial ventilation. During treatment, his ECG showed fresh changes of ST elevation. High CPK & CPK-MB levels, septal hypokinesia on 2D echo suggested acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography was postponed due to his bedridden and obtunded status. The patient finally recovered fully by day 15 and was discharged. Acute coronary syndrome is a rare occurrence in OP poisoning. The present case thus emphasises the need for careful electrocardiographic and enzymatic monitoring of all patients of organophosphorus poisoning to prevent potential cardiac complication which can prove fatal.\n\nEpidemiological study of acute poisoning in children: a 5-year retrospective study in the Paediatric University Hospital in BiaÅystok, Poland.\n\nPubMed\n\nPawÅowicz, Urszula; Wasilewska, Anna; OlaÅski, Witold; Stefanowicz, Marta\n\n2013-09-01\n\nPoisoning among children and youths in the northeastern part of Poland accounted for 25% of the total number of patients admitted to the Hospital Emergency Department of the Paediatric University Hospital of BiaÅystok. We hypothesise that the epidemiology of poisoned paediatric patients admitted is related to increase in 'designer drugs' (mainly amphetamine- and ecstasy-like psychostimulants, hallucinogens and synthetic cannabinoids ('spice') intake, which became popular 5 years ago in our country. A retrospective chart review of medical records of 489 patients admitted due to poisoning in the 5-year period (2006-2010). The data included: age, sex, place of residence, nature of the substance, causes of poisoning, former use of psychoactive stimulants, accompanying self-mutilation and injuries and length of hospitalisation. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages, and continuous variables as mean and SD. The data were collected in a Microsoft Excel database. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Programme for Social Sciences. Out of 2176 hospitalised children, 489 were admitted because of poisoning. Out of these, 244 (49.9%) were hospitalised due to intoxication by alcohol. Only eight children used designer drugs. The mean age of all patients in our group was 12.86Â±5.04 years, of which 52.4% were male. Poisoning was intentional in 75.5%, and accidental in 24.5% of cases. Appearance of 'designer drugs' had no significant impact on the number and epidemiology of poisonings in our group.\n\n[Characteristics of emergency poisoning cases in elderly versus younger patients].\n\nPubMed\n\nSupervÃ­a CaparrÃ³s, August; PallÃ s Villaronga, Oriol; Clemente RodrÃ­guez, Carlos; Aranda CÃ¡rdenas, MarÃ­a Dolores; Pi-Figueras Valls, MarÃ­a; Cirera Lorenzo, Isabel\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo compare cases of poisoning according to age to detect differences in frequency of visits to the emergency department, patient characteristics, case management, and immediate outcome in terms of related mortality. Descriptive study of a retrospective series of patients who visited a university hospital emergency department for treatment of poisoning between 2009 and 2014. We collected patient characteristics and data related to the event, case management, and poisoning-related death. Patients were grouped according to age (cut-off 65 y). Of a total of 3847 poisoning episodes, 341 (8.9%) were in patients aged 65 years or older. The percentage of women among these older patients (61.3%) was greater than among younger patients (36.3%; P<.001). Poisoning was accidental in older patients more often than younger ones (64.4% vs 9.5%, respectively; P<.001), occurred more often in the home (82.1% vs 37%, P<.001), and more often required active treatment (73.3% vs 57.4%; P<.001) and admission to hospital (21.4% vs 7.3%, P<.001). The related mortality rate was also higher in the older patients (2.1% vs 0.1% in younger patients, P<.001). The percentage of poisonings in patients aged 65 years or older is not negligible. Poisoning in patients of advanced age tends to be accidental and take place in the home. Older patients more often require active treatment and hospital admission; poisoning-related death is more common in older patients than younger ones.\n\nEpidemic of poisoning caused by scopolamine disguised as Rohypnol tablets.\n\nPubMed\n\nVallersnes, Odd Martin; Lund, Cathrine; Duns, Anne Kathrine; Netland, Hallstein; Rasmussen, Inge-AndrÃ©\n\n2009-11-01\n\nAn epidemic of scopolamine poisonings occurred in Oslo in 2008 among users of illicit drugs, caused by fake Rohypnol pills. The clinical features, diagnostic process, and handling of the epidemic are presented. Suspected cases of scopolamine poisoning were extracted by reviewing registration forms from an ongoing prospective clinical study of acute poisonings in Oslo. Medical records of extracted contacts were examined and cases included according to specified clinical criteria. Forty-four cases of probable scopolamine poisoning were registered. Main clinical features were mydriasis, visual hallucinations, plucking behavior, agitation, and coma. No clinical diagnosis of anticholinergic syndrome was made prior to forensic analysis of the tablets, the most frequent diagnosis up to this point being unspecified drug-induced psychosis. Later in the epidemic, scopolamine poisoning became the dominating diagnosis. Ten patients were admitted to psychiatric hospitals, the rest recovered in medical units, or left health care against medical advice. Scopolamine poisonings are rare, but the resulting anticholinergic syndrome is well described. The syndrome was not recognized until the forensic analysis result strikingly changed how the patients were diagnosed and handled. A unique aspect of this epidemic was the intoxicating agent being scopolamine-containing tablets looking like Rohypnol, sold and used under the impression of being the latter. Recognizing the anticholinergic syndrome is important to provide proper treatment. Forensic analysis was the key to correct diagnosis in this outbreak, demonstrating its importance in verifying an epidemic of poisoning by fake drugs.\n\nOrganophosphate poisoning in Rhodesia. A study of the clinical features and management of 105 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHayes, M M; van der Westhuizen, N G; Gelfand, M\n\n1978-08-05\n\nA series of 105 patients with organophosphate poisoning admitted to Harari Hospital during the past 4 years is described. Poisoning with organophosphate compounds is being seen more frequently in hospital practice in Rhodesia. Many of the cases are attempted suicides, but frequently there is no positive history of contact with the poison. The majority of patients exhibit the classic clinical features of parasympathetic overactivity, but diagnosis may be obscured by atypical presentation. Rapid diagnosis and utilization of the treatment regimen outlined in this article should reduce the mortality to less than 15%.\n\nCriminal poisoning of commuters in Bangladesh: prospective and retrospective study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMajumder, M Mahbub Alam; Basher, Ariful; Faiz, M Abul; Kuch, Ulrich; Pogoda, Werner; Kauert, Gerold F; Toennes, Stefan W\n\n2008-08-25\n\nTravel-related poisoning is an emerging social and public health emergency in Bangladesh but its cause and significance have not been determined. To investigate this syndrome we performed a prospective clinical study and retrospective analysis of hospital records in a general medicine unit of a public tertiary care teaching hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using toxicological analysis by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS). The participants of the prospective study were 130 consecutive patients aged 16-80 years who were admitted with central nervous system depression (Glasgow Coma Score 3-14) after using public transportation, in the absence of other abnormalities, from January through June 2004, and a convenience sample of 15 such patients admitted during 3 days in May 2006. In 2004-2006, travel-related poisoning increased from 6.1 to 9.5% of all admissions (210-309 of 3266-3843 per year), representing 46.6-55.7% of all admitted poisoning cases. Incidents were associated with bus (76%), taxi, train, and air travel, or local markets; 98% of patients remembered buying or accepting food or drinks before losing consciousness. Direct financial damage (missing property) was diverse and frequently existential. Among 94 urine samples analyzed by FPIA, 74% tested positive for benzodiazepines. Among 15 urine samples analyzed by LC-TOF MS, lorazepam was detected in all; five also contained diazepam or metabolites; nitrazepam was present in three. FPIA results obtained for these 15 samples were below the recommended cut-off in eight (53%; lorazepam only). Our findings show that the massive medicosocial emergency of travel-related poisoning in Bangladesh is the result of drug-facilitated organized crime and that benzodiazepine drugs are used to commit these crimes, suggesting modifications to the local emergency management of the victims of this type of poisoning. They also highlight the\n\n[Poisonings with the herbicides glyphosate and glyphosate-trimesium].\n\nPubMed\n\nMortensen, O S; SÃ¸rensen, F W; Gregersen, M; Jensen, K\n\n2000-08-28\n\nGenerally the herbicide glyphosate is considered harmless to humans. Glyphosate-trimesium is labelled harmful (Xn), whereas glyphosate-isopropylamine carries no warning sign. As cases of serious poisoning have emerged contacts to the Poison Information Centre have been reviewed. The persons exposed were mainly smaller children and adults 20 to 59 years of age. Oral exposure was recorded in 47 persons, inhalation exposure in 24 and topical contact in 42. About one fourth of the exposed persons were asymptomatic. Most of the symptomatic poisonings demonstrated complaints from the mouth, the gastrointestinal tract and the airways. Eleven patients were admitted to hospital. Two died, one of them having ingested the isopropylamine salt, the other the trimesium salt. Death ensued quickly in the latter patient. A similar fate was observed in a child--not included in the present material--who had also ingested the trimesium compound.\n\nSevere acute copper sulphate poisoning: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinkovic, Andreja; Strdin, Alenka; Svensek, Franci\n\n2008-03-01\n\nAs copper sulphate pentahydrate (CSP) is a common compound used in agriculture and industry, chronic occupational exposures to CSP are well known, but acute poisoning is rare in the Western world. This case report describes acute poisoning of a 33-year-old woman who attempted suicide by ingesting an unknown amount of CSP. On admission to the hospital, she had symptoms and signs of severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, dehydration, renal dysfunction and methaemoglobinaemia with normal serum copper level. Therapy included early gastric lavage, fluid replacement, vasoactive drugs, furosemide, antiemetic drugs, ranitidine, and antidotes methylene blue and 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulphonate (DMPS). However, the patient developed severe intravascular haemolysis, acute severe hepatic and renal failure, as well as adrenal insufficiency. After prolonged, but successful hospital treatment, including haemodialysis and IV hydrocortisone, the patient was discharged with signs of mild renal and liver impairment. Our conclusion is that in severe cases of copper poisoning early supportive measures are essential. In addition, antidotes such as methylene blue for methaemoglobinaemia and chelating agent such as DMPS improve morbidity and survival of severely poisoned victims.\n\nFirst Aid Knowledge of University Students in Poisoning Cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoktas, Sonay; Yildirim, Gulay; Kose, Selmin; Yildirim, Senay; Ozhan, Fatma; Senturan, Leman\n\n2014-12-01\n\nPoisoning is a crucial public health problem which needs serious approach and response to treatment.

This research was conducted in order to evaluate first aid knowledge of university students for poisoning. The research was conducted between the dates of May 2013-June 2013 with the permission gained from the University Rectorship. The cohort of the research contained 4,560 students who received education in Istanbul. The sample of the study included 936 students who accepted to participate in the research and attended the school during the research. The data were collected by using a questionnaire form, which had 21 questions prepared by researchers. Analysis of the data was carried out with a percentage evaluation method and chi square tests in a computer environment. In our study, 92.6% of students (n=867) knew the phone number of the ambulance in case of emergency. In addition, 57.3% of students (n=536) knew the phone number of the poison hotline, and it was seen that they answered correctly the questions regarding the relation between body system and indications of poisoning. It was determined that the students who received education in medical departments answered the questions correctly more than the students who had education in other departments. (pâ¤0.001, pâ¤0.01). It was observed that the university students in medical departments had more first aid knowledge on poisoning cases compared to the students in other departments who did not have sufficient information regarding these issues. It is thought that first aid education in all departments of universities, both poisoning and other first aid issues, should be conveyed to all students.\n\nPoisons Implicated In Homicidal, Suicidal And Accidental Cases In North-West Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nJan, Adil; Khan, Muhammad Jaffar; Humayun Khan, Muhammad Tariq; Masood Khan, Muhammad Tariq; Fatima, Sadia\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPakistan has one of the highest prevalence of poisoning in the world. However, limited data exist on the frequency of poisons implicated in homicidal, suicidal, and accidental cases in North-West Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). This retrospective study of 353 cases and biological specimens of poisoning received at the department of Forensic medicine and toxicology, Khyber Medical College Peshawar from 13 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Frequency of poisoning was assessed by testing each specimen for 17 different poisons. Of all the specimens, 250 (70.8%) specimens tested positive and the rest didn't show any indication of poisoning (n=103, 29.2%). The most frequent poisons detected were benzodiazepines (total n=75), organophosphates (total n=58), phencyclidine (total n=30) and morphine (total n=23). Gender had a significant association with benzodiazepines (p=0.011), tricyclic antidepressants (p=0.001), and organophosphates (p<0.001). Organophosphates were the most common cause of poisoning in females while benzodiazepines were the most common cause of poisoning in males. Poisoning by benzodiazepines, organophosphates and phencyclidine are the most common causes of intoxication in population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Source of poisoning varies with gender for organophosphates, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning in Northeast of Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhadem-Rezaiyan, M; Afshari, R\n\n2016-07-01\n\nCO poisoning is still a public health concern especially in developing countries. We aimed to focus on CO poisoning secular trends based on registry data for the recent 7 years in Northeast of Iran. Registry database of Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad, Iran was analyzed. All admitted cases with CO exposure during 2004-2011 were included. Data from two national censuses were used for calculating rates. Data analyses was performed by SPSS 11.5. PÂ <Â 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There were 443 CO related admissions (0.9% of all poisonings which equals to a prevalence rate of 1.9 per 100,000) during the 7-year period. Mean age was 32.3Â Â±Â 18.2 years and 60% of subjects were male. CO prevalence rate was not changed during this period. Case fatality rate was higher in men (5.4% vs. 4.4%). Self-employment and manual or office workers were at greatest risk. Age specific prevalence and mortality rates were highest in >60 age group. (2.9 and 3.1 per 100,000, respectively). As it seems that current health prevention studies are not effectively working, these secular trends can enlighten health policy makers to implement proper population based "
