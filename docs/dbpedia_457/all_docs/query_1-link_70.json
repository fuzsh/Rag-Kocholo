It’s quick and easy to learn, safe, and contains quite a bit of sting. Jeremy Silman (acclaimed author of How to Reassess Your Chess) 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 (Diagram 1)\n\nDiagram 1 (B) The Colle System brings about the Colle System, or should I say systems? After 3...e6 4 Bd3, White has the choice between two simple set-ups which both offer attacking chances on the kingside without being particularly theoretical. The Colle System The player who specializes in the white side of the Queen’s Gambit Declined (1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 c4 e6 4 Nc3) will have to make some important decisions over the course of the next few moves, depending on whether Black plays an early ...Bb4, heads for the sharp and theoretical Semi-Slav with 4...c6 or employs one of the many Classical defences. Compare that with the Colle: 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 e6 4 Bd3 c5 5 c3 and now no matter how Black develops his king’s bishop and queenside, White can play 6 Nbd2, 7 0-0 and then look to break with e4 (Diagram 2).\n\n6\n\nDiagram 2 (B) The main line Colle The e4-break is the key to White’s play. Should Black exchange on e4, then White will recapture with his knight after which the c1-bishop is free to move and White has easy development. But should Black ignore the pawn on e4, he may find that it quickly advances to e5, driving away the f6-knight and heralding the beginning of a kingside attack. This system dates back to the Nineteenth Century, but came to be named after by far its leading protagonist in the 1920s, the Belgian Edgard Colle (1897-1932). Following Colle’s untimely death, his favourite system was adopted by his countryman, George Koltanowski (1903-2000); a player chiefly remembered today outside the United States for his vast blindfold simultaneous exhibitions. Undoubtedly Koltanowski did much to popularize the opening in America (after arriving there during the Second World War), and it is nowadays sometimes even referred to as the ‘Colle-Koltanowski System’. The Zukertort Attack Also known as ‘the Colle-Zukertort’, this system shares much in common with the traditional Colle. White will begin as before with 1 d4, 2 Nf3, 3 e3 and 4 Bd3, but rather than support d4 with c3 and look to break with e4, he instead prefers to fianchetto his queen’s bishop: 5 b3 and then 0-0, Bb2 and Nbd2 (Diagram 3)\n\n7\n\nDiagram 3 (B) A typical Zukertort completes White’s easy-to-employ set-up. This is also a pretty reasonable option for White, but do please note that we will only concentrate on the pure Colle in this work, not the Zukertort set-up. The Kingside Attack Throughout this book we will witness a number of white kingside attacks and typical attacking motifs. Probably the most important of these is the attack on h7 and the Colle is an opening which allows the white clubplayer not just to dream about making a Greek Gift sacrifice, but of actually carrying one out.\n\nNOTE: A ‘Greek Gift’ sacrifice occurs when White sacrifices his light-squared bishop on h7, intending to mate after 1 Bxh7+ Kxh7 2 Ng5+ Kg8 3 Qh5. (Diagram 4)\n\nDiagram 4 (W) 8\n\nWhite to play and win shows the Greek Gift in its purest form (of course, in an actual game Black would have many more pieces and the queenside wouldn’t be so empty). White wins with 1 Bxh7+! Kxh7 (Black could decline the bishop with 1...Kh8, but he has then lost a vital defensive pawn; White will probably retreat the bishop before continuing his attack with Ng5 and Qh5+, or Qg4-h4 after ...g6) 2 Ng5+ (Diagram 5) and now Black is defenceless:\n\nDiagram 5 (B) The Greek Gift is decisive a) 2...Kg8 3 Qh5 threatens mate on h7 and in this particular instance White’s fastest win after 3...Rd8 is 4 Ba3, cutting off the Black king’s escape. That motif sometimes crops up in practice too, but more usually the presence of Black’s other pieces prevents his king from escaping past e7 and White wins more slowly with 4 Qxf7+ Kh8 5 Qh5+ Kg8 6 Qh7+ Kf8 7 Qh8+ Kg7 8 Qxg7+ and mate follows. Note that even if f7 was defended, such as by a black rook on a7, White’s attack is still usually decisive following 4 Qh7+ Kf8 5 Qh8+ Kf8 6 Qxg7 and then either f7 falls or a nasty check occurs on the h4-d8 diagonal. Of course, in our particular and contrived case, the alert reader will no doubt have spotted that 4 Qh7+ Kf8 5 Qh8+ Kf8 6 Qxg7?? fails to 6...Rd1 mate; a most embarrassing turnaround which reminds us to always be alert to our opponent’s threats. b) 2...Kh6 usually fails to a lethal discovered check (on e6) or even a discovered and double check (on f7), which may well net a queen on d8 or c7, if not actually help White force mate. NOTE: White’s dark-squared bishop is often a silent but vital piece on the c1-h6 diagonal in any Greek Gift. Without it Black may be able to defend with 1 Bxh7+ Kxh7 2 Ng5+ Kh6 (depending on whether he has a defence to 3 Qg4, such as 3...Rh8), and White must also make certain that 2 Ng5+ doesn’t just drop the knight to a black queen on d8. c) 2...Kg6 is usually the most challenging defence. In our position White’s quickest mate begins with 3 Qd3+, but in practice he is more likely to be successful with 3 Qg4 (when Black will probably have to try 3...f5) or with 3 h4, intending 4 h5+. Of course, any Greek Gift is reliant upon any f6-knight having been driven away from its defensive duties, usually with e4-e5, White’s ideal Colle advance. When preparing to sacrifice the light-squared bishop it is 9\n\nalways wise to view the whole board and to consider the individual position of each black piece. WARNING: Turn back to Diagram 4 and place a black dark-squared bishop on e7. 1 Bxh7+?? Kxh7 2 Ng5+ now fails to 2...Bxg5, and such a bishop on e7 is normally sufficient to thwart any Greek Gift. White must also be aware of Black defending back along the b1-h7 diagonal after 2...Kg8 3 Qh5+ with either his queen or bishop (Diagram 6).\n\nDiagram 6 (B) 3...Qd3 or 3...Bd3 covers h7 Stronger readers may well be wondering if they’ve opened a primer on attacking chess, rather than a book on the Colle, but the Colle does abound like no other opening with chances at lower levels for White to execute a textbook bishop sacrifice on h7. In practice White will often attack but without carrying out a bishop sacrifice on h7. He may threaten one and thereby induce a weakening ...h6 or ...g6 advance, or White might just force one of those moves by building up against h7, such as with Ng5 and Qh5, assuming no f6knight, or with one Bc2, Qd3 and then either Ng5 or Bg5 (Diagram 7).\n\n10\n\nDiagram 7 (W) Bg5 or Ng5 will increase the pressure Throughout this work we will see a number of different attacking mechanisms for White, but in just about every case the defence of h7 should be at the forefront of Black’s mind. Fortunately for white club players, it frequently isn’t. The Greek Gift sacrifice, for instance, may be as old as the hills, but even players who should know better have fallen for it, possibly having been lulled into a false sense of security by White’s apparently simple (yet deadly!) early development. Let’s look first at a Victorian classic: D.Baird-J.Hanham (see Diagram 8) New York 1893 This position is a little different from the standard Greek Gift affair since there isn’t a white knight on f3. That does not, however, preclude the sacrifice, especially when, as here, f7 is also vulnerable.\n\n11\n\nDiagram 8 (W) Where are Black’s kingside defenders? 12 Bxh7+! Already this is pretty much decisive. Should Black capture the bishop with 12...Kxh7 then White reveals another important Greek Gift motif, namely a rook lift: 13 Qh5+ Kg8 14 Qxf7+ Kh8 15 Re3! and mate follows (15...Nf6 16 Rh3+ Nh7 17 Ng6mate). In the game Hanham exploited the vacant f8-square with 12...Kf8, but that wasn’t enough to save him: 13 Ndf3 (correctly introducing more pieces into the attack, rather than getting involved in the flashy 13 Nxf7) 13...f6? 14 Ng6+ Kf7 15 Nh8+! Kf8 (15...Rxh8 16 Qxe6+ Kf8 17 Qe8mate was White’s point) 16 Nh4 and Black was crushed. Hanham wasn’t a particularly weak player (and he is chiefly remembered for the variation of the Philidor which bears his name), so how could he overlook White’s sacrifice? It may help if we consider that his last move (Diagram 9)\n\n12\n\nDiagram 9 (B) The e5-knight is very strong was 11...Nf6-d7. Undoubtedly Hanham was rather concerned about White’s dominant knight on e5 and wanted to exchange it off or to chase it away with a well-timed ...f6. His problem was that an immediate exchange with 11...Nxe5?? would have cost him a piece after 12 dxe5 and 11...Bxe5 was also undesirable; not only does Black cede bishop for knight, but after 12 dxe5 Nd7 13 Nf3 (and not 13 Bxh7+? due to 13...Kxh7 14 Qh5+ Kg8 when Black defends after both 15 Nf3 Nf8 and 15 Re3 Ncxe5 16 Rh3 Ng6), White has a useful space advantage and can build up almost at his leisure on the kingside. Sacrifices on h7 aren’t always played with the aim of mate. Instead they can be used as a device to pick up a loose piece or pawn, often down the d-file or on e8 (with Black’s f-pawn missing or able to be won with check). Here’s a simple and recent example:\n\n13\n\nDiagram 10 (W) Bxh7+ can be used to win material J.Curtis-T.Headlong (see Diagram 10) British League 2006 24 Bxh7+! Kxh7 25 Qh4+ Kg8 26 Bxe7 (Diagram 11)\n\nDiagram 11 (B) White has netted a useful pawn and White had won a pawn, while also increasing his kingside attacking chances. The Attacking Stonewall Set-up In the Colle White will often play for an early Ne5, especially after a premature ...cxd4; exd4 exchange. From e5 the knight towers over the black camp and is not at all easy to chase away. White will then look to attack on the kingside, but may well first strengthen his grip on e5 with f2-f4. The resultant ‘Stonewall’ structure is both easy to handle and difficult for Black to defend against. For example:\n\nS.Reshevsky-A.Kevitz (see Diagram 12) US Championship, New York 1936\n\n14\n\nDiagram 12 (W) The e5-knight is very powerful Black’s handling of the opening has not been especially accurate: his premature exchange on d4 (still quite a typical mistake at club level), has allowed White a fine square for his knight on e5. Reshevsky now increased his grip over that key square. 12 f4! Setting up a cramping Stonewall formation. We will see much more of this set-up in Chapters Three and Four, and this is a particularly good version since Black lacks some essential counterplay. Note too how he cannot capture on e5: 12...Nxe5?? 13 fxe5 forks and wins a piece, while 12...Bxe5? 13 fxe5 merely opens lines for White’s attack. 12...Rfe8 13 g4!? We are taught not to advance pawns in front of our king, but when the opponent has no counterplay it can be safe to do so. Reshevsky wants to drive the f6-knight away and begin a strong attack. In such positions White can also consider 13 Ndf3 heading for g5, but here that would allow Black to awkwardly interfere with White’s build-up after 13...Ne4!. 13...Nf8 14 g5 N6d7 15 Nf1! Unravelling and heading for h5. At some point Black must break out with ...f6 or ...f5 (White should capture en passant in either case) which is positionally desirable for him, but in this case only helps White’s attack. 15...Re7 16 Ng3 f6 Otherwise Nh5 would have increased the pressure in any case, and then one effective follow-up is Qg4-h4 and Re3-h3. NOTE: Swinging at least one major piece across to the h-file is an integral part of many Stonewall attacks. 17 gxf6 gxf6 18 Nxd7 Rxd7 19 Nh5 Rf7 20 f5! (Diagram 13)\n\n15\n\nDiagram 13 (B) White has a strong attack Opening a path for the c1-bishop. White enjoys a dangerous attack and Reshevsky went on to win. The Disparaging Views of Strong Players What we have seen so far sounds pretty ideal: White develops his pieces in straightforward manner and then has good attacking chances on the kingside, especially with a Bxh7+ sacrifice. The first part of that is definitely true, although I’m not quite sure I fully agree with the famous author C.J.S. Purdy when he wrote: ‘A player who specializes in the Colle System needs to spend only about a tenth of the time studying the openings (for White) that he would otherwise have to.’ Perhaps that is so for when White gets to play the Colle after 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 e6, but Black can obviously also deviate earlier as we will see. As for White’s attacking chances, these are real and frequent at club level, although to hear some strong players speak the Colle is just a bad opening. What exactly has caused such views? 1. White-to-play-and-win Manuals The Colle is an excellent opening for those new to the game or keen to avoid masses of theory: White’s development system is very easy to employ and he will struggle to blunder early on. Unsurprisingly a number of books and articles have been written to cater for such an audience. They do contain some good ideas, but all too often exaggerate White’s chances and downplay or even outright ignore some of Black’s better defences.\n\nLet’s say Joe Bloggs crushes Sam Smith in a Colle miniature in the U1400 tournament at their local club. A few weeks later the two meet again in the Minor section of a weekend congress. This time Sam improves, a complex but roughly balanced middlegame ensues and the game is heading for a draw until a late blunder decides. Upon returning home Joe consults his Colle source; a work which has always impressed him since it contains a whole white opening repertoire, unlike the many specialist 1 e4 manuals also on his bookshelf. Unfortunately for Joe, Sam’s natural-looking 10th move isn’t anywhere to be found and he was sure that this line was very good for White. Disheartened he turns on his computer, but even the might of the German chess engine can’t find a way for White to gain a large advantage or even to launch a strong attack on move 11. Even worse, Joe’s book hasn’t explained all the key ideas for both sides in the line in question. At some stage in every game we are ‘taken out of book’; in the Colle that shouldn’t be a large worry since the key ideas for both sides are usually fairly easy to understand. The Colle is an easy opening to learn and with knowledge of a little theory and some typical motifs, one can be pretty successful with it up to a certain level. However, if Black also understands the Colle pretty well and knows some theory, unfortunately White has no objective advantage. But think about it: can White really force an advantage against the Najdorf or Nimzo-Indian, assuming best play from both sides? He can’t, and such reasons shouldn’t put White off the Colle. 16\n\nIn short, the key challenge for your author is to instruct the reader in the main ideas of the Colle, while at the same time not neglecting Black’s best defences and ways for White to then play the resulting positions. 2. Grandmasters Don’t Play the Colle Usually some sort of exception is made for Yusupov (a man who once reached a Candidates’ semi-final no less), but one will often hear that few or even no grandmasters specialize in the Colle. Such an argument most certainly has its merits. Anand, Svidler and Ponomariov might have employed either the Colle or the Zukertort, but that was only on the odd occasion: respectively when facing a computer, when very young and a mere 2480, and against a much weaker opponent in a rapidplay. Quite simply at 2600+ level, the likely absence of strategical middlegame mistakes in the Colle, aligned to good theoretical knowledge and defensive technique, means that White’s winning chances are pretty slim in comparison with the sharper 1 e4 and 1 d4 main lines in vogue at the highest level. So the Colle might not be a good opening at the likes of Linares, but at slightly less exalted levels, the Colle and Zukertort are both found; Grandmaster Kovacevic has employed the opening against all-comers for more than twenty years. Going back to the 1920s and 1930s, we find a number of Colles in the leading events of the time, and by no means only when Colle himself was playing: Alekhine (who even employed the Colle against both Bogoljubow and Euwe in World Championship matches), Capablanca, Euwe and Rubinstein all made good use of the opening. Quite simply the World’s elite in those days were not yet certain that 3 c4 (after 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6) was a superior move to 3 e3. Chess understanding has greatly increased since the thirties, but the elite of those days were still somewhat superior to your average clubplayer nowadays. If they found the Colle a good opening to employ, and their opponents often struggled against it, there can be no reason for the amateur player to reject it as ‘not strong enough’ today. 3. Strong Players Don’t Actually Like facing the Colle A final reason why some strong players may be a little disparaging about the Colle is because they, like many of their lower-rated club colleagues, don’t actually like facing it, chiefly for one of two related reasons: (i) White’s opening is fairly untheoretical but very sound, and Black needs to be both alert and quite patient when facing it; and (ii) it can be hard to defeat weaker opposition when they employ the Colle. As Watson and Schiller put it, ‘Black must create his own imbalances if he wants to play ambitiously’, but of course such an approach doesn’t suit everyone and may play into White’s hands. What Lines are Included? As we’ve already mentioned this is a work on the Colle System, not the Colle-Zukertort. It would, though, be a little criminal to only consider the main line of the Colle which is usually characterized as beginning 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 e6. Those who employ the Colle must also be ready for some other tricky options from Black on his second and third moves; these will be examined in Chapters Five and Six.\n\nThe Colle player must also be aware that while this work will help them to combat 1 d4 d5, it does not feature 1 d4 Nf6. Many Colle fans like playing 2 Nf3 when it is possible to meet 2...e6 with a Colle approach: 3 e3 b6 (3...d5 returns to our main subject matter) 4 Bd3 Bb7 5 0-0 c5, and now 6 c4!? leads to a tricky line of the Queen’s Indian, but staying in Colle vein and preparing the traditional e3-e4 push with 6 Nbd2 (Diagram 14)\n\n17\n\nDiagram 14 (B) The Colle Queen’s Indian is also quite playable. However, I’m afraid that I cannot recommend meeting 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 g6 with 3 e3 (White should instead consider 3 Bg5, 3 Bf4 and 3 Nc3, as well as 3 c4), since (i) on d3 White’s bishop will now bite on granite and (ii) Black has easy play with ...d6 and ...e5 (see Diagram 15).\n\nDiagram 15 (W) An ineffective Colle set-up Selection of Games This is a Starting Out guide (with all its usual features, including notes, tips and warnings as we’ve already seen), not a comprehensive theoretical tome on the Colle. There is some theory on the opening (and clearly the stronger club player may wish to try and remember a little more of it than their weaker counterpart), and indeed one or two positions are quite critical, but it is an opening in which a knowledge of where the pieces go and of typical strategical motifs is generally more important than any specific knowledge of theory. As a result, the illustrative games have usually been chosen with the aim of highlighting common types of middlegame and typical plans arising. 18\n\nThe reader will also find that the illustrative games are generally between fairly strong players. Not only did I not want to rehash the classics for those who already employ the opening (although a few were still too instructive to leave out; likewise some games by lower-rated players), but also by studying some of the better games available we are more likely to appreciate both White’s main plans and especially Black’s best defences. Only the player comfortable with their opening even when Black plays one of the better lines against it, can be said to be on the road towards slowly mastering that opening. Some readers may well want to know more about what’s going to happen at lower club levels than in an international game featuring a grandmaster or two. As a concession to any such readers, I have at times overused the word ‘typical’; for instance, ‘a typical trap’ refers not to a trap a grandmaster is likely to fall for, but rather one which is fairly common at club level. I do not, however, propose to give white win after white win in low-level games. Should anyone having read this work still want to study a collection of lower-level Colle games, they are referred either to ChessBase’s Mega or Bigdatabases (collections of over 3.5 million games; unsurprisingly they now contain a lot of games by untitled and even internationally unrated players), or to Hatch and Hatch’s creatively-titled The Dogs of War: Practical Play in The Colle System; a collection of games played by all levels of player from 900-rating to GM strength. Finally, it must be said that the selection of lines covered and illustrative games supplied was not influenced only by Colle theory and typical Colle motifs. We live in an information age, and of late a number of repertoire works having sprung up offering Black advice in handling the Colle amongst other openings. On the grounds that the reader’s opponents may well turn to such sources in a bid to avoid being wiped out by the Colle, we will pay particular attention to the lines they propose. How Best to Use This Book Some readers may wish to systematically work through every page and note, but for those new to the Colle I would recommend the following: play through the main line which begins each section, only stopping to examine any sub-variations which catch the eye or contain a fair amount of explanatory text, and then study the illustrative games at the end of each section. After that you should be ready to begin using the Colle in your own games, but after each outing with the opening, please look up the opening moves and study that particular line in a little more depth. This way your Colle understanding will begin to build up, and without any information overload occurring in the process!\n\nI should also mention that some readers may find the notes a little more theoretical than they expected at times. Quite simply the Colle is not completely untheoretical and it would be most unfair on stronger readers not to cover some critical and fairly sharp lines. It only remains to thank my colleagues at Everyman Chess for all their help with this project, along with Joachim Berndt, John Cox, Dylan Morgan, Jim Nicholson, Jeremy Silman, Kieran Smallbone and Norman Stephenson for their kind assistance and thoughts, and to wish the reader all the best with his or her Colle adventures.

He doesn’t have to block in his light-squared bishop (and the alternatives are covered in Chapter Five), but this is by far Black’s most popular continuation, occurring more than three times as often as his main alternatives according to ChessBase’s Big Database 2007 (our source for all future statistics). 4 Bd3 c5 As White hasn’t employed an early c4, Black naturally enough decides to play a sort of reversed Queen’s Gambit himself. This is again the most popular option, although he can also delay ...c5 as we will see in Chapter Four. 5 c3 A useful move and a key component in the Colle development scheme. NOTE: 5 c3 both adds support to the d4-pawn and prepares a retreat to c2 for the light-squared bishop should Black employ an early ...c4-advance. 5...Nc6 (Diagram 2)\n\n20\n\nDiagram 2 (W) A straightforward and common defence The most aggressive square for the knight and by far the most common move seen in practice. Should Black, though, want to fianchetto his queen’s bishop, he might well prefer not to block the bishop’s range from b7 with 5...Nbd7, the subject of Chapter Three. Black can also develop his kingside before deciding where to place his queen’s knight, but after 5...Be7 (or 5...Bd6) 6 Nbd2 0-0 7 0-0 play is likely to transpose to either the lines of this chapter or the next (after 7...Nc6), or to those of Chapter Three (after 7...Nbd7). Another option is 7...b6, reaching a position we will consider in Chapter Four in which 8 e4 isn’t White’s only try; another very thematic move being 8 Ne5, followed by f4. 6 Nbd2 Bd6 Another natural move, both preventing Ne5 and should White continue too passively over the next couple of moves, possibly preparing ...e5. Black can also play a little more cautiously with 6...Be7, but this doesn’t make any difference should White be happy with the main line: 7 0-0 0-0 (Diagram 3)\n\n21\n\nDiagram 3 (W) Less aggressive than 6...Bd6 8 dxc5 leaves Black with nothing better than 8...Bxc5 9 e4 and we’re back in the main subject of this chapter and the next. Of course, if White doesn’t want to play an early dxc5, then the bishop’s presence on e7 rather than on d6 makes a difference and I will endeavour to point out such differences as we go along. At club level, Black may worry about having to lose a tempo with his dark-squared bishop (in the event of ...Bd6 or ...Be7; dxc5 Bxc5) and mistakenly decide to ease the central tension: 6...c4? is seen in our first illustrative game and 6...cxd4?! in the second. TIP: White should be happy to see Black picking up his c-pawn on move 6. No matter what he does with it, the resulting positions tend to emphasize White’s attacking chances on the kingside and Black’s potentially bad light-squared bishop. A radical alternative to developing Black’s dark-squared bishop is 6...g5?!, an idea given some coverage by Hatch and Hatch. Black is trying to play a reversed Shabalov Gambit (1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3 e6 5 e3 Nbd7 6 Qc2 Bd6 7 g4!?), but this tempo down version isn’t fully convincing: 7 0-0 (White can even consider 7 Nxg5!? Rg8 8 Nxh7 Nxh7 9 Bxh7 Rxg2 10 Qf3 – Hatch and Hatch) 7...g4 (Diagram 4)\n\n22\n\nDiagram 4 (W) Ambitious play from Black 8 Ne5! (exploiting the absence of ...Qc7) 8...Nxe5 9 dxe5 Nd7 10 f4 c4 (White remains for choice after 10...gxf3!? 11 Nxf3 Be7 12 Qe2 and e4 – Black’s king is still some distance from finding a safe home on the queenside) 11 Bc2 h5 (J.Markus-M.Steinbacher, Amsterdam 2004) 12 Qe2 and Black’s kingside advance is beginning to look a little irrelevant with White ready to powerfully break with some combination of b3 and e4. 7 0-0 (Diagram 5)\n\nDiagram 5 (B) White will break with e3-e4 WARNING: Advancing with e3-e4 is White’s main break in the Colle and one which he must strive 23\n\nfor. However, an immediate 7 e4 is premature and Black secures a comfortable game with 7...cxd4 8 cxd4 dxe4 9 Nxe4 Nxe4 10 Bxe4 Bb4+!. In the Colle White can sometimes accept an isolated queen’s pawn (or IQP) in return for attacking chances, but this is not one of those cases. The problem is that the side with the IQP needs to use his extra space to attack, whereas the defender wants to trade pieces down to an ending in which the d-pawn becomes a fatal weakness. Here after 11 Bd2 Bxd2+ 12 Qxd2 Bd7 at least one set of minor pieces too many have been traded for White’s liking, and he has nothing better than a rapid d4-d5 to secure full equality. 7...0-0 Once again 7...c4 and 7...cxd4 are misguided approaches (the latter transposes to Game 2, while the former is very similar to Game 1), but what if Black decides to try and seize the initiative with 7...e5? After all, following 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3 e6 5 e3 Nbd7 (this variation of the Semi-Slav is actually a reversed Colle) 6 Bd3 Bd6, White’s best move is 7 e4 (or 7 0-0 0-0 8 e4). In our Colle position White is, however, a crucial tempo ahead of Black in that Semi-Slav sequence which makes a vital difference: 8 dxe5 Nxe5 9 Nxe5 Bxe5 10 e4! (Diagram 6)\n\nDiagram 6 (B) White seizes the initiative and Black is beaten to the bounce. White has good chances to seize a strong initiative here with 11 f4 and 12 e5 the immediate plan:\n\na) 10...Bxh2+?? 11 Kxh2 Ng4+ 12 Kg1 Qh4 fails to 13 Nf3 – remember this key defensive resource should you ever be tempted to carry out a Greek Gift in the ...Nbd7 lines. b) 10...0-0 11 f4 Bc7 12 e5 Ng4 13 Nf3 c4 14 Bb1 Bb6+ 15 Kh1!? (Diagram 7)\n\n24\n\nDiagram 7 (B) A white kingside attack is likely left White with good attacking prospects (down the b1-h7 diagonal and with f4-f5) in R.Frosch-I.Ceschia, Austrian Team Championship 2006. Note here that 15...Nf2+?? would be a howler due to the double attack after 16 Rxf2 Bxf2 17 Qc2. c) 10...Qc7!? is Black’s most combative defence, but White retains the advantage with the bold 11 exd5!. Now 11...0-0 12 Nf3 Bg4 13 h3 is just good for White, so in T.Doeppner-E.Hermansson, German League 2002, Black tried 11...Bxh2+ 12 Kh1 0-0?! and White fell for the bluff, shying away from 13 g3! Bxg3 14 fxg3 Qxg3 15 Qf3 Qh4+ 16 Kg2 when there isn’t objectively enough for the piece. Admittedly the white king would appreciate some pawn cover, but White’s pieces are quick to come to the kingside to defend and Black might even live to regret half-opening the h-file. d) 10...dxe4 is a safety-first approach, but one which can easily leave Black horribly tied up in knots after 11 Nxe4 Nxe4? (this time 11...Bxh2+?? 12 Kxh2 Ng4+ 13 Kg1 Qh4 fails to 14 Bf4, although 14 Bb5+ might be even stronger; actually the best defence is the untried 11...0-0!, but White should be able to retain a little nibble, such as with 12 Re1 Nxe4 13 Bxe4 h6! 14 Qxd8 Rxd8 15 Be3 Bd6 16 Rad1) 12 Bxe4 (Diagram 8)\n\n25\n\nDiagram 8 (B) Black is already struggling 12...Qxd1 13 Rxd1 0-0 14 Be3 when White’s bishops rule the board and it will cost Black a pawn to develop his c8-bishop.\n\nNOTE: In this last sequence Black didn’t have to trade queens, but he should avoid 12...0-0 in view of the typical Colle motif 13 Bxh7+! Kxh7 14 Qh5+, winning a clear pawn. Finally, Black might prepare ...e5 with 7...Qc7, but after 8 dxc5 Bxc5 9 e4 he has nothing better than 9...00, transposing to the main line and Chapter Two. Returning to 7...0-0: 8 Qe2 Supporting the e4-push and avoiding multiple exchanges as can occur in the main line after 8 dxc5 Bxc5 9 e4 (Diagram 9)\n\nDiagram 9 (B) 26\n\nThe main line 9...dxe4 10 Nxe4 Nxe4 11 Bxe4 Qxd1 12 Rxd1 (not that White should at all fear this position as we will see later in this chapter). 8 Qe2 is essentially a tricky transpositional move; White wants to transpose to certain variations in the main line, while avoiding others. It is also possible to play an immediate 8 e4 and this advance is much better timed than on the last move since White has now castled. After 8...cxd4 9 cxd4 dxe4 10 Nxe4 (Diagram 10)\n\nDiagram 10 (B) White prefers an IQP set-up an IQP situation has arisen and this should be a relatively comfortable version for Black. That said, a white player experienced in such positions and/or knowing that his opponent doesn’t like to defend against the IQP may find this to be a reasonable practical alternative to the main line. See Game 3 for details. In the ...Nbd7 lines we will frequently see White preparing e4 with Re1, but here 8 Re1 is dubious. The variation 8...e5! (8...Qc7 is also fine for Black) 9 dxc5 Bxc5 10 e4 Bg4 (Diagram 11)\n\n27\n\nDiagram 11 (W) Black has equalized easily with active and easy development for Black demonstrates why: 11 h3 (with the queen on e2, White can try 11 exd5 Qxd5 12 Ne4, but here 12...Rad8 is clearly nothing for him) 11...Bh5! 12 exd5 Qxd5 13 Bc4 Qd8 14 b4 Bb6 15 Bb2 Qc7 16 Qb3?! e4! 17 Nd4 Qf4 left White in trouble in N.Amaral-R.Damaso, Portuguese Championship 1993; White’s queenside expansion wasn’t especially convincing and Black took over the initiative in straightforward style. White can also meet 8 Re1 e5 with 9 dxe5 Nxe5 10 Nxe5 Bxe5, but again this fails to trouble Black after 11 Nf3 Bc7 or 11 e4 Bg4. Returning to 8 Qe2: 8...e5! (Diagram 12)\n\nDiagram 12 (W) ...Nc6 and ...Bd6 prepared 8...e5 28\n\nAnd why not? Just as against 8 Re1, this is the critical test of White’s move order. NOTE: If Black is happy to meet the main line (8 dxc5 Bxc5 9 e4) with 9...Qc7 then here he may opt for 8...Qc7 since White hasn’t anything better than 9 dxc5 Bxc5 10 e4 with a transposition. That 8 Qe2 deserves some respect is shown by the variation 8...b6?! 9 e4!. The threat is 10 e5 and 9...dxe4?! 10 Nxe4 is already quite promising for White: the idea being to take advantage of the undefended c6-knight to win a piece with 11 Nxf6+ and 12 Qe4. Meanwhile the d6-bishop is also vulnerable and Black is in some trouble as was demonstrated by the fine game, M.Wildi-L.Mella, Zurich 1989: 10...Bb7 11 dxc5! Bxc5 12 Nxf6+ (Diagram 13)\n\nDiagram 13 (B) 12...Qxf6?? is a typical blunder 12...gxf6 (unfortunately for Black 12...Qxf6? 13 Bg5 runs his queen out of squares) 13 Rd1 Qc7 14 Bxh7+! (the presence of the pawn on f6 and the strong alternative possibility of 14 Qe4 might well have deterred many from the classic sacrifice, but Wildi has seen deep into the position) 14...Kxh7 15 Qe4+ (Diagram 14)\n\n29\n\nDiagram 14 (B) This deep Greek Gift is decisive 15...f5 (there was nothing better: for instance, White wins after 15...Kg7 16 Qg4+ Kh8 17 Bh6 Rg8 18 Qh4 or 16...Kh7 17 Ng5+! fxg5 18 Qh5+ Kg7 19 Qxg5+ Kh8 20 Rd3 – Bronznik) 16 Qh4+ Kg8 17 Qg5+ Kh7 18 Qh6+ Kg8 19 Ng5 f6 20 Nxe6 Qf7 21 Rd3! and the threat of mate saw White regain his material with a large advantage. This variation might well tempt one to try 8 Qe2 in a rapid game, but unfortunately for White 8...b6 is fine if Black’s bishop is back on e7 since 9 e4 doesn’t then threaten a piece-winning fork.\n\nWith the bishop on d6, a rare but interesting alternative is Neikirkh and Tsvetkov’s suggestion of 8...Nd7!?. WARNING: No matter which of Black’s knights is on d7, White should usually refrain from exchanging on c5 since ...Nxc5 enables Black to unravel with tempo against White’s key light-squared bishop. After 8...Nd7, play might continue 9 e4 cxd4 10 cxd4 Nb4 11 Bb1 (White really needs to keep this bishop if he is to mount a successful attack) 11...b6 12 Re1 Ba6 13 Qe3 Rc8! (Bronznik) with good counterplay for Black. 9 dxc5 Just as in the main line, this is really the only capture to consider. Instead 9 dxe5 Nxe5 10 Nxe5 Bxe5 leaves White the side looking to equalize, especially after 11 e4?! Qc7 12 h3 Re8 or 11 Nf3 Bc7 and Black has aggressive options available in ...Qd6 and ...Bg4. 9...Bxc5 10 e4 (Diagram 15)\n\n30\n\nDiagram 15 (B) White counters in the centre 10...Be6 Preparing to recapture with the bishop in the event of an exchange on d5, and White doesn’t have a good alternative way to develop his queenside. Black can also consider: a) 10...Bg4 11 exd5 Qxd5 12 Ne4 (Diagram 16),\n\nDiagram 16 (B) Accurate play will equalize for Black first played by Colle, is a variation with which White has enjoyed some practical success, although Black should be fine after either 12...Nxe4 13 Bxe4 Qe6! or the more ambitious 12...Rad8!? 13 Nxf6+ gxf6 14 Be4 Qe6 15 h3 Bh5 16 Qc2 Bg6! (H.Polzer-R.Holmberg, correspondence 1999). 31\n\nNOTE: Both Polzer and Holmberg were rated over 2450 when this game was played and the correspondence world (see, for example, Tim Harding’s Mega Corr 4 CD) can be a good source of ideas for the studious player. b) 10...dxe4 11 Nxe4 Be7 is fairly accommodating since White has been allowed to unravel. Nevertheless, Black remains quite solid and obtained at least equality after 12 Rd1 Qc7 13 Nxf6+ (relying on piece play with the more aggressive 13 Nfg5!? is probably a better try; White retains some awkward pressure after, for example, 13...g6 14 Nxf6+ Bxf6 15 Be3 Ne7 16 Ne4 Bg7 17 Bc5! or 15...Bd7 16 Qf3!) 13...Bxf6 14 Bg5 Be7 15 Qe4 f5! 16 Qd5+ Kh8 17 Bxe7 Qxe7 and 18...e4 in E.Limp-G.Vescovi, Americana 2000. c) 10...d4!? is a principled if double-edged advance, ruling out exd5 and seizing space in the centre. This also appears quite playable for Black so long as he meets 11 Nb3 Bb6 12 cxd4 with the correct recapture 12...exd4!, intending to create some problems down the e-file and 13 e5 Re8 14 Bg5 Bg4 15 Bxf6 (W.Schraufl-H.Horther, Fuerth 2002) 15...gxf6 16 Qe4 f5 17 Qf4 Bxf3 18 Qxf3 Rxe5 shouldn’t give White anything despite Black’s split kingside. 11 exd5 The only other option is to attack on the queenside with 11 b4?! Bb6 12 b5 Ne7, but this fails to convince: 13 Ba3 runs into 13...Ng6! and 13 Nxe5 Qc7 14 exd5 Nexd5 left White a little overextended in M.TratarD.Sermek, Groningen 1993. 11...Bxd5 12 Ne4 Nxe4 13 Bxe4 (Diagram 17)\n\nDiagram 17 (B) Control of e4 is useful White hopes to gain some pressure against e5 and then to either advance his queenside majority or to attack on the kingside. However, the e5-pawn controls some useful squares and Black has good chances to fully equalize. Possibly he should settle for the slightly meek 13...Bxe4 14 Qxe4 h6 15 b4 Bd6, as in J.Krouzel-M.Rybak, Czech League 1996, although White could now try the critical 16 Nh4!?. In practice Black has often preferred the active 13...f5!? 14 Bxd5+ Qxd5 15 Rd1 Qe4!, but after 16 Qb5! he must avoid 16...Bb6?! 17 Re1 Qc2 18 Be3 Bxe3?! 19 Re2! Qe4 20 Rxe3 as in the stem game F.Saemisch-S.Rosselli del Turco, Baden-Baden 1925. Instead Bronznik has suggested that Black might continue in active vein with 16...Rad8!, although now I wonder about 17 Qb3+ Kh8 18 Re1! Qg4! (both 18...Qd3 19 Bg5 Rde8 20 Rad1 Qa6 21 Rd7 and 18...Qd5 19 Bg5 Qxb3 20 axb3 give White an edge) 19 Qxb7 (Diagram 18) 32\n\nDiagram 18 (B) The struggle critically flares up 19...Qg6 20 b4 Bb6 when Black is well co-ordinated and has a dangerous central pawn duo, but White is a pawn up and may be able to beat off the coming attack. Theoretical Conclusion 8 dxc5 is the main line for the reason that it’s the most challenging move. With 8 Qe2, White aims to avoid some of Black’s 9th move options in the main line, but these are probably not worth avoiding. The unbalanced positions after 8 Qe2 e5 give both sides opportunity to outplay a weaker or inexperienced opponent, but objectively Black is fine and he can also consider the rare but promising 8...Nd7. Illustrative Games Game 1 E.Colle-Delvaux Terneuzen 1929 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 e6 4 Bd3 c5 5 c3 (Diagram 19)\n\n33\n\nDiagram 19 (B) Facilitating Bc2 if needed The correct move order. Instead 5 0-0 makes 5...c4!? a much more enticing prospect for Black and one which has caught the eye of some strong players. A fairly recent example continued 6 Be2 b5! (Diagram 20)\n\nDiagram 20 (W) An interesting black option 7 Nbd2?! Bb7 8 Ne5 Nbd7 9 f4 Be7 10 Ndf3 Ne4 and White was already struggling, before he made matters worse with the weakening 11 a4?! b4 in A.Adly-S.Rublevsky, FIDE World Championship, Tripoli 2004. NOTE: The Stonewall set-up with Ne5 and f4 can lead to promising attacking possibilities for White, but he must be aware that such a set-up is positionally committal: while White can never regain pawn 34\n\ncontrol of e4, Black can take control of the e5-square with a well-timed ...f6. Adly lacked any real counterplay on the kingside and White does better to challenge on the queenside with 7 b3!, although Black should still be OK in an tough struggle; for example, 7...Bb7 8 a4 (8 bxc4 bxc4 9 Nc3 Nbd7 10 Rb1 Bc6 11 e4! dxe4 12 Nd2 Qa5! 13 Bb2 Nb6 was much more unbalanced but also about even in the exciting clash G.Dizdar-M.Chandler, Jurmala 1983) 8...a6 9 axb5 axb5 10 Rxa8 Bxa8 11 bxc4 bxc4 12 Nc3 Nbd7 13 Bd2 Be7 14 Qa1 0-0 and neither side was able to get anywhere down the open queenside files in G.Maróczy-A.Nimzowitsch, Gothenburg 1920. 5...Nc6 6 Nbd2 c4? This advance is quite popular with rather inexperienced juniors. They usually envisage a queenside pawn storm, completely forgetting that White also gets to both move and advance. NOTE: Once White has played c3, ...c5-c4 is an instructive mistake. It prematurely releases the central tension, is too slow and greatly strengthens the e4-break, since an exchange on e4 would leave c4 rather weak. 7 Bc2 Of course, and this was the point of 5 c3. 7...Be7 8 0-0 b5 Continuing Black’s plan and he might as well do this. Otherwise after 8...0-0 9 e4 White threatens 10 e5 and Black lacks counterplay in the resulting French positions. 9 e4 (Diagram 21)\n\nDiagram 21 (B) White’s ideal central break 9...dxe4 Delvaux is understandably concerned about the impending attack, but I suspect Black has more chances to resist after 9...0-0 10 e5 Nd7, although that is a relative statement! White will re-route his knight into the attack via f1 and so in W.Hoffmann-K.Kreis, Bruchkoebel 1993, Black tried to counter in French style with 11 Re1 a5 (Black doesn’t need this preparatory move, but after 11...b4 Bronznik offers a cute and instructive possible continuation: 12 Nf1 bxc3 13 bxc3 Qa5 14 Qd2! Ba6 15 Ng3 Rfb8 16 Nh5 Nf8? 17 Nxg7! Kxg7 18 Qh6+ Kg8 19 Bg5 and wins) 12 Nf1 f6, but after 13 exf6 Nxf6, as well as the game’s 14 Ne5, 14 Ng5 looks pretty strong since the only way to defend e6 is the disgusting 14...Qd6 15 Qe2 Nd8. 10 Nxe4 0-0 35\n\nHarvey wonders whether ‘Black would do better to avoid castling’. I too suspect that he would, but after 10...Bb7 11 Qe2 it’s not so easy for Black to find a good plan. White, on the other hand, can try to crash through on e6 or f7 after bringing a knight to g5, and can also weigh up the a4- and b3-breaks. 11 Qe2 Once again White targets h7; the threat being the fairly common tactic 12 Nxf6+ Bxf6 13 Qe4, winning a piece. 11...Bb7 12 Nfg5! (Diagram 22)\n\nDiagram 22 (B) An omnipotent knight on g5 12...h6? Black had to cover h7, but this weak move merely leads to further weaknesses. Seeing as Black shortly plays ...g6 in any case, he was much better off with 12...g6 when there isn’t anything decisive, although White retains a rather pleasant advantage after 13 Nxf6+ Bxf6 14 Ne4 Be7 15 Bh6 Re8 16 Rfe1. 13 Nxf6+ Bxf6 14 Qe4 g6 From here on Delvaux rather decides that he might as well be remembered as the loser of a fine miniature than continue to grimly suffer after the marginally superior 14...Re8 15 Qh7+ Kf8 16 Ne4. 15 Nxe6! (Diagram 23)\n\n36\n\nDiagram 23 (B) A typical sacrificial breakthrough Undoubtedly one of the main attractions for Colle to the opening which bears his name was the opportunity to land such blows. 15...fxe6? 16 Qxg6+ Bg7 17 Qh7+ Kf7 18 Bg6+ Kf6 19 Bh5! (Diagram 24)\n\nDiagram 24 (B) There’s no defence Quite possibly Delvaux overlooked this neat switchback when accepting the piece on e6. White’s threats on the kingside now quickly decide: 19...Ne7 20 Bxh6 Rg8 Or 20...Bxh6 21 Qxh6+ Kf5 22 g4+! and the black king is driven forwards to its imminent demise. 37\n\n21 h4! Keeping up the threats and Black now allows the game to terminate immediately. However, there hasn’t been any good defence for several moves and here, for instance, 21...e5 22 Bxg7+ Rxg7 23 dxe5+ costs Black a rook. 21...Bxh6? 22 Qf7 mate 1-0 A crushing victory from the man himself. Points to Remember 1. White should meet 4 Bd3 c5 with 5 c3, not the slightly inaccurate 5 0-0. 2. ...c5-c4 is simply a badly misguided strategy – Black is too slow on the queenside. 3. White should react by aiming to force a favourable French with an e4-e5 advance. Black can avoid that with an exchange on e4 when White should look for tactics not just against h7, but also e6 and f7. Game 2 E.Gausel-K.Lie Norwegian Championship, Asker 2000 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 e6 4 Bd3 c5 5 c3 Nc6 6 Nbd2 cxd4?!\n\nOnce again the tension proves too much for Black to handle and he prematurely releases it. 7 exd4 (Diagram 25)\n\nDiagram 25 (B) White has the more active bishops We now have the so-called ‘Carlsbad structure’ on the board. A structure which the reader may well have seen arise in some other openings, and most notably the Exchange Variation of the Queen’s Gambit Declined. This Colle version of the Carlsbad is pretty pleasant for White. Compare it with the QGD version: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 cxd5 exd5 5 Bg5 Be7 6 e3 c6 7 Bd3 0-0 8 Qc2 Nbd7 9 Nf3 Re8 10 0-0 Nf8 (Diagram 26).\n\n38\n\nDiagram 26 (W) Our Colle structure in reverse In that case White’s c1-bishop is actively developed outside the pawn chain and he can consider carrying out a minority attack with b4-b5. TIP: A ‘minority attack’ is the name given to a situation in which the side with just two pawns on a flank advances them against the opponent’s three, aiming to create a weakness. In the Exchange QGD version, for example, should White achieve b4-b5xc6 bxc6, he gains a useful outpost on c5, while Black is left with a weak backwards pawn on c6. In our Colle case not only is Black some way from arranging ...b5-b4, but he is also stuck with a bad lightsquared bishop, blunted by the e6-pawn. White on the other hand has free development, can develop his darksquared bishop much more easily than in the main line and enjoys a very handy outpost on e5. 7...Bd6 8 0-0 0-0 Black has also been known to panic here about White’s imminent kingside attack and play 8...Qc7 9 Re1 Bd7 10 Qe2 0-0-0?!, but this is a case of jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Not only does Black lack counterplay, but White has the straightforward and very effective plan of pushing his queenside pawns; for example, 11 Ne5 Be8 (or 11...Rdf8 12 Ndf3 Kb8 13 a4 Bc8 14 b4 Ne8 15 Nxc6+ Qxc6 16 Bd2 Nc7 17 b5 Qd7 18 b6! and Black was crushed in M.Golmayo de la Torriente-L.Prins, Sitges 1934) 12 Ndf3 (Diagram 27)\n\n39\n\nDiagram 27 (B) White will push his queenside pawns 12...Nd7 13 Nxc6 (Koltanowski’s idea of 13 Bd2 Nf8 14 c4!? is also quite dangerous) 13...Qxc6 (A.Brown-P.Thomas, Scotland 2004) 14 a4 Kb8 15 b4! Nf6 (15...Qxc3? 16 Bd2 Qc8 17 Rec1 Bc7 18 a5 merely opens lines for the attack) 16 Bd2 h5 17 b5 Qc7 18 a5 and White has a very strong and much the faster attack. NOTE: This game actually began via the move order 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 c5 3 e3 e6 4 Bd3 d5 5 c3 Bd6 6 Nbd2 cxd4 7 exd4 Nc6 8 0-0 0-0, but I’ve standardized it for the reader’s convenience. 9 Re1 (Diagram 28)\n\nDiagram 28 (B) The e5-outpost beckons 40\n\nPreparing to advance the knight to e5, but Black resists... 9...Qc7 10 Qe2 ...and so White tries again. 10...Nd7! Such an undeveloping move may appear a little strange, but Lie correctly realizes that the fight for control of e5 must be at the top of both sides’ priorities. Instead 10...Re8?! 11 Ne5 (Diagram 29)\n\nDiagram 29 (B) Hoping for 11...Nd7? 12 Bxh7+! returns us to a position we considered in Baird-Hanham in the Introduction. We considered there both 11...Nd7? and 11...Bxe5, but Black might also try covering f7 with the prophylactic 11...Re7, as he did in E.Colle-V.Soultanbeieff, Liege 1930. Objectively White should continue 12 f4, followed by Ndf3 and a kingside attack, quite possibly involving either Ng5 or an advance of the g-pawn. However, Colle couldn’t resist the lure of the sacrifice and preferred 12 Ndf3 Nd7 13 Ng5!? Nf8 14 Nxh7!? Nxh7 15 Bxh7+ Kxh7 16 Qh5+ Kg8 17 Re3 (Diagram 30)\n\n41\n\nDiagram 30 (B) How should Black defend? and now before we condemn his defence, we should try putting ourselves in the no doubt stunned Soultanbeieff’s shoes. Cover up the following variations and spend some time trying to work out exactly what’s going on (it’s a good calculation exercise). Undoubtedly White has a strong attack and Black needs to be pretty careful:\n\na) 17...Re8? 18 Rh3 Kf8 was rather too simplistic a defence from the Russian. Colle now triumphed in style with 19 Bg5 f6 20 Bxf6! (Diagram 31)\n\nDiagram 31 (B) A neat finish from Colle and 1-0 since mate follows after 20...gxf6 21 Ng6+.\n\nb) 17...g6?! also doesn’t help and allows White to target the f6-square: 18 Qh6 f5! (this goes unmentioned by both Smith and Hall, and Harvey, but appears to be the best defence; the win is much more routine after 42\n\n18...Re8 19 Ng4! f5 20 Rh3 Qg7 21 Nf6+! – Smith and Hall) 19 Rh3 Bxe5 20 dxe5 Qxe5 21 Qxg6+ Qg7 22 Qh5 (Diagram 32)\n\nDiagram 32 (B) Black must return material 22...Ne5 (22...Qh7 looks more natural, but is rebuffed by the machine’s fiendish 23 Rg3+ Kh8 24 Qf3 Qf7 25 Bg5 when Black is defenceless; Black might consider too 22...f4!? 23 Bxf4 e5, but after 24 Rg3 exf4 25 Rxg7+ Kxg7 26 Qg5+ Kh7 27 Qxf4 White’s queen and three connected passed pawns should gradually overcome Black’s rook and two pieces) 23 Rg3 Ng4 and White regains his piece, leaving him a pawn ahead albeit in a slightly messy position after something like 24 h3 e5 25 Bh6 Qh7 26 hxg4 fxg4 27 f3 Bf5 28 fxg4 Bg6 29 Qg5 Re6.\n\nc) 17...Bxe5!? 18 dxe5 Nxe5! (this obvious attempt to return the piece also goes unmentioned by previous annotators, but appears forced: 18...Re8? is crushed by Smith and Hall’s 19 Rh3 Kf8 20 Bg5 Ne7 21 Bf6!, while 18...g6? 19 Qh6 Re8 loses to the leisurely 20 Bd2 followed by 21 Rae1 and only then 22 Rh3 or 21...f5 22 Rg3) 19 Rh3 (White can also regain the piece with 19 Rxe5, but after 19...f6 20 Re3 e5 Black’s strong centre at least compensates for his absent h-pawn) 19...f6 and White hasn’t anything better than perpetual check. d) 17...f6! 18 Rh3 Nxe5! (but not 18...fxe5?? 19 Qh8+ Kf7 20 Rf3+ Kg6 21 h4 and 22 h5mate) 19 Qh8+ Kf7 20 Rh7 Kg6! (Diagram 33)\n\n43\n\nDiagram 33 (W) White can only repeat (Reinfeld) is the traditional defence given when White has nothing better than a repetition with 21 Rh4 Kf7 22 Rh7. Not the most theoretically relevant of games, but one which shows how tough the pressure can be for Black to handle when White goes all in on the kingside, as well as the attacking menace created by knights on e5 and g5 (remember Colle had plenty of alternatives to sacrificing on move 14). Returning to the superior defence, 10...Nd7: 11 c4! (Diagram 34)\n\nDiagram 34 (B) Changing tack with Ne5 unavailable 44\n\nSwitching plans in a bid to exploit the congestion in Black’s camp. The Colle is an opening in which White’s play is often thematic, but sometimes he must change his plan should Black try a radical or very creative defence. NOTE: Not for nothing did Koltanowski like to say: ‘You do not have to be orthodox about sticking completely to the Colle line if your opponent varies.’ White can also continue in natural Colle style with 11 Nf1, but after 11...Re8! Black threatens to gain counterplay with ...e5. White can prevent that with 12 Ne3?! (Tim Taylor’s 12 h3 e5 13 dxe5 Ndxe5 14 Bf4 is probably White’s best try for a small edge – again we can see White having to change plans; he can only play for an attack when he controls the e5-square), but after 12...Nf6! he lacked a good continuation in Y.Anokhin-A.Kalantar, Batumi 1961. Gausel’s 11 c4 is designed to dissuade Black from ...e5. Admittedly 11...e5!? is still possible, but after 12 cxd5! Nxd4 13 Nxd4 exd4 14 Qh5!? (Bronznik), White has the initiative. 11...Nf6 Now that White has weakened the defence of d4, Black returns his knight to its most natural square. This may appear a little slow, but Black doesn’t appear to be able to equalize in any case: a) 11...b6 12 b3 Bb7 13 Bb2 Nb4?! (Black likes to make use of the b4-square in this variation, but especially doing so here only plays into White’s hands) 14 Bb1 Rac8 15 a3 Nc6 16 Qd3! and White was a little better due to his powerful queen and bishop battery in A.Perez de Miguel-A.Gerrikabeitia Uriarte, Ourense 2006. b) 11...dxc4 12 Nxc4 Bb4 13 Rd1! (correctly avoiding any exchanges) 13...Nf6 14 Bg5 Be7 15 Rac1 (Diagram 35)\n\nDiagram 35 (B) White has a grip on the position gave White quite a good IQP set-up in G.Meszaros-S.Kovacevic, Harkany 2001; the c4-knight can increase the pressure by heading to e5 or possibly even to e3 (supporting a d5-advance), while Bb1 and Qd3 should force a kingside weakness. c) 11...Be7?! 12 b3 Bf6 13 Bb2 (13 cxd5!? exd5 14 Ba3 Rd8 15 Rac1 Qa5 16 Nb1! is also promising) 13...Qf4!? was a creative defence in R.Simon-T.Sarbok, German League 2001, but White’s superior development saw him retain a comfortable edge after 14 g3! Qh6 15 Rad1. 12 b3 Bb4?! 45\n\nSuch potential hanging pawn positions are never easy for Black if he is pretty inexperienced in them. Whereas White usually intends to increase the pressure with Rad1 (or Rac1) and Ne5, Black has all manner of possible piece configurations to employ. Lie decides to undertake active operations to counter White’s harmonious Zukertort set-up, but they fail to fully convince. Instead White would have only been a little better after 12...b6 13 Bb2 Bb7 14 Rad1 Rac8 15 Ne5 when Black remains pretty solid and can begin counterplay with 15...Qe7, intending ...Rfd8 and ...Bb4. 13 Bb2 (Diagram 36)\n\nDiagram 36 (B) It’s Zukertortesque! 13...Qf4 14 Rad1 b6 15 a3 Bxd2! Ceding the bishop pair might appear a little drastic, but Black hopes to undermine White’s defence of c4. Furthermore, 15...Be7 could be met by either 16 b4 dxc4 17 Nxc4, when we again see a knight flexibly placed on c4 and controlling a number of useful squares, or by 16 Ne5!?, hoping for 16...Nxd4? 17 Bxd4 Qxd4 18 Nc6 Qc5 19 cxd5, exploiting White’s superior development and winning material after 19...Nxd5? 20 Rc1 Qd6 21 Qe4 g6 22 Nxe7+ Nxe7 23 Qxa8 Qxd3 24 Qxa7. 16 Rxd2 Na5 17 Bc2 (Diagram 37)\n\n46\n\nDiagram 37 (B) ...Ba6 is a useful option 17...dxc4 Perhaps an immediate 17...Ba6!? was superior since 18 Bd3 is now impossible. Possibly Lie was worried by 18 Bc3, but 18...dxc4 19 Bxa5 bxa5 20 bxc4 Rfd8 21 Bd3 Qc7! doesn’t appear too bad for the second player. White’s problem is that for the time being he cannot easily advance the hanging pawns. Indeed 22 c5? would be a horrible move, ceding control of the d5-square and further weakening the d4-pawn. NOTE: The term ‘hanging pawns’ refers to two pawns abreast with an open file on either side (i.e. they aren’t supported by any other pawns). The side with the hanging pawns can sometimes use them to powerfully break through in the centre (but here 22 d5? exd5 23 cxd5 Bxd3 24 Rxd3 Qc5 costs White his d-pawn), or he may exploit the extra space they grant him to launch a kingside attack. On the other hand, the side opposing the hanging pawns (Black in this case) needs to prevent a powerful d4-d5 advance and aim to tie down White’s pieces to the defence of the pawns. 18 bxc4 Bb7 Much more consistent was still 18...Ba6 when 19 Bd3 Rac8 20 Rc2 Rfd8 21 Ne5! reaches a critical position in which we can see how useful White’s dark-squared bishop is in comparison to the note to Black’s 17th. 22 g3 will now drive Black’s queen offside and there are also nasty ideas of d5 and Nxf7 in the air; for example, the ever-thorough Bronznik analyses 21...Nc6? 22 g3 (22 d5 also looks quite promising, but the text is very strong) 22...Qh6 23 Nxf7! Kxf7 24 Qxe6+ Kf8 25 a4! with a huge attack. 19 Ne5 Rac8 (Diagram 38)\n\n47\n\nDiagram 38 (W) Spot a typical breakthrough! 20 Bc1?! Rightly queried by Bronznik who points out that White had a much more thematic continuation available in 20 d5! (the classic breakthrough in such positions, unfurling White’s powerful dark-squared bishop) 20...exd5 (20...Nxc4!? 21 Nxc4 Qxc4 22 Qxc4 Rxc4 23 dxe6 fxe6 24 Bb3 is also much better for White with his bishop pair on an open board) 21 Rd4 Qh6 22 cxd5 Bxd5 (or 22...Nxd5 when White has a number of tempting and strong continuations, including Bronznik’s 23 Bc1 Qf6 24 Qd3 g6 25 Nd7 Qc6 26 Rxd5!) 23 Ng4 (Diagram 39)\n\nDiagram 39 (B) All White’s pieces are attacking 48\n\n23...Nxg4 24 Rxg4 f6 25 Bc1 g5 26 h4 and Black’s kingside is unlikely to hold out for too much longer. 20...Nxc4?? In his desire to gain counterplay, Lie misses an important tactic. He has, though, never really looked at home as Black in this game. Indeed aggressive players have often been known to struggle when facing the Colle: Black needs to first patiently neutralize White’s aggressive ideas in the early middlegame; usually only then can he look to undertake active operations himself. Instead 20...Qh4 would have kept White’s advantage to a minimum; Black’s queen may become a tactical liability on the kingside, but she can also be an effective defender. Now 21 Rdd1 is the sane continuation instead of the rather messy 21 Rd3!? Nxc4 22 Nd7!? Nxd7!? (22...Rfd8 23 Rh3 Qxd4 24 Nxf6+ Qxf6 25 Bxh7+ Kf8 26 Bd3 is a little more comfortable for White due to his safer king) 23 Rh3 Qxh3 24 gxh3 Rfe8. Black has good positional compensation for the queen here, but must play accurately to prevent White from inflicting a kingside weakening (25 Qd3 is thus best met by 25...Nf8). 21 Nxc4 Rxc4 22 Qxc4 Ng4 23 g3 Qf3 The point of Black’s combination, but he had evidently missed one of White’s next two moves. 24 d5! The ideal IQP advance; decisive in this case, albeit played for rather unusual reasons. 24...Bxd5 25 Be4 (Diagram 40)\n\nDiagram 40 (B) Defending and winning 25...Ne5 26 Bxd5 exd5 27 Qxd5 1-0 Points to Remember 1. An early exchange on d4 weakens Black’s control of the key e5-square.\n\n2. White should then aim to quickly occupy e5 with a knight, intending to launch a kingside attack featuring such moves as f4, Nd2-f3-g5 and possibly Bxh7+. 3. The best defence to the threat of 11 Ne5 is 10...Nd7 when White should probably change tack with 11 c4. 4. Hanging pawn positions require care and tactical alertness from both players. White needs to keep any such pawns defended, while looking to either attack on the kingside or to carry out a thematic d4-d5 breakthrough. Game 3 T.Straeter-J.Hladik 49\n\nPardubice (Game 3) 2006 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 e6 3 e3 c5 4 Bd3 d5 5 c3 Nc6 6 Nbd2 Bd6\n\nWARNING: White can only aim for an early IQP position when Black develops his bishop to d6: 6...Be7 7 0-0 0-0 (Diagram 41)\n\nDiagram 41 (W) The IQP approach isn’t possible 8 e4? simply costs a pawn after 8...dxe4 9 Nxe4 cxd4 10 cxd4 Nxd4. Those determined for whatever reason to avoid the main line can consider meeting 6...Be7 7 0-0 0-0 with either 8 Qe2 or the Stonewall approach, 8 Ne5. Objectively, though, neither is particularly testing against all but fairly inexperienced opponents; for example, against the latter, the solid 8...Nd7 9 f4 f5! is fine for Black. 7 0-0 0-0 8 e4!? Playing for an IQP position and a kingside attack. Surprisingly this option wasn’t considered by Watson and Schiller in their anti-Colle coverage (as part of their How to Succeed in the Queen Pawn Openings), and it continues to catch out some black players. 8...cxd4 The correct way for Black to begin to liquidate the centre. Instead 8...dxe4 9 Nxe4 Nxe4 10 Bxe4 cxd4 11 cxd4 (and not 11 Bxh7+? Kxh7 12 Ng5+ Kg6! when Black comfortably defends with ...f5) is a little better for White since Black lacks any kingside defenders, but even worse for him is 9...cxd4?! 10 Nxf6+! (Diagram 42)\n\n50\n\nDiagram 42 (B) Black lacks a good recapture 10...gxf6 (10...Qxf6?? 11 Bg5 nets a whole queen) 11 Bh6 Re8 12 Nxd4 f5. Then 13 Qh5!? Nxd4 14 cxd4 gave White attacking prospects in P.Romanovsky-G.Rotlewi, St Petersburg 1909, but objectively he should probably prefer something calmer having gained a structural advantage. 9 cxd4 dxe4 Before inflicting the IQP on White, Black can also bring his knight closer to the ideal blockading square on d5 with 9...Nb4, as recommended by Rizzitano. However, he then overlooks after 10 Bb1 dxe4 11 Nxe4 Be7 (Romanovsky’s old suggestion of 11...Nbd5!? is rarely played but still seems quite reasonable; Black doesn’t mind an exchange on d6 since he can then avoid being forced to play ...g6 after 12 Nxd6 Qxd6 13 Qd3 b6 14 Bg5), the possibility of 12 Nc3 transposing to our main game. White probably should keep pieces on in such a manner and instead 12 Nxf6+ Bxf6 13 a3 Nd5 14 Qd3 g6 15 Bh6 Bg7 16 Bg5 Qd6 17 Re1 b6 18 Ne5 Bb7 (Diagram 43)\n\n51\n\nDiagram 43 (W) Model defence from Black 19 Qh3 Rac8 20 Be4 Rc7 saw him unable to generate anything against Black’s model defence in J.CobbB.Lalic, British League 2000. IQP positions tend to be quite divisive amongst players: some love to play with an IQP; others can’t think of anything worse. The same applies to players facing an IQP and should Black not wish to do so, he might prefer to detonate the centre with 9...e5!? (Diagram 44).\n\nDiagram 44 (W) A radical alternative to the IQP Now 10 exd5 Nxd4 11 Nxd4 exd4 doesn’t lead anywhere for White, so he usually prefers a double 52\n\nexchange on e5: 10 Nxe5 Nxe5 11 dxe5 Bxe5 12 exd5 Qxd5 13 Nf3 Bb8!? (13...h6?! 14 Nxe5 Qxe5 15 Re1 Qd5 16 Bc2 Qxd1 17 Bxd1 Be6 18 Bf3 Bd5 19 Bxd5 Nxd5 20 Bd2 gave White a very pleasant endgame advantage with bishop against knight in J.Nogueiras-Y.Gonzalez, Santa Clara 2005, although Black eventually held the draw after a gruelling 75-move defence) 14 Bg5 Bf5! (Black was seduced by 14...Bg4?! 15 Bxf6 Qh5!? in M.Ashley-G.Vescovi, Bermuda 1995, but was forced to play accurately to hold a pawn down after 16 Bh4 Bxf3 17 Qxf3 Qxh4 18 g3 Qf6 19 Qxb7) 15 Bxf5 Qxf5 16 Qd4 Ng4! (16...Bc7!? is also possible, relying on the bishop versus knight advantage to offset Black’s split kingside after an exchange on f6, but the text is the simplest equalizer, threatening to capture on h2) 17 Be7 Re8 and if anyone needs to be careful to ensure full equality, it’s now White; for example, 18 Rfe1 Bc7 19 h3? runs into 19...Nxf2!. 10 Nxe4 Be7! Preventing the threat of 11 Nxf6+ and unfurling an attack on d4 which White parries by clearing the d3bishop’s path. 11 Nc3! (Diagram 45)\n\nDiagram 45 (B) An unbalanced structure TIP: When playing with an IQP, always try to ensure that any exchanges force some sort of concession from the opponent. Here an exchange on f6 doesn’t and so Straeter retreats. 11...Nb4 Even if White plays passively, it takes Black a very long time to win the IQP. In the short term, more important than the theoretical weakness of the pawn itself, is the fact that White has lost control of the d5square and Hladik exploits that in typical fashion. 12 Bb1 Setting up a battery on the long diagonal is probably the best try. Instead the instructive 12 Bc4 a6! 13 Bg5 b5 14 Bb3 Bb7 15 Ne5 Nbd5 16 Qe2 Nxc3! (transferring the weakness from d4 to c3 is a fairly common ploy) 17 bxc3 Rc8 18 Rac1 Nd5 left Black slightly better in G.Werner-Y.Boidman, Hassloch 2006. 12...Bd7!? An interesting way of bringing the bishop to the long diagonal without slightly weakening b5 and a6 as the usual 12...b6 does. Play may then continue 13 Re1 Bb7 14 Ne5 (Diagram 46) 53\n\nDiagram 46 (B) White wants to attack and now: a) 14...Nbd5?! is natural, but a little too compliant. J.Plaskett-N.Short, British League 2000 (a game which incidentally arose from a French – IQP positions are full of such transpositions between different openings) continued 15 Qd3 Rc8 16 Qh3! (stronger than an immediate 16 Bg5 since White may now be able to deflect the f6-knight with Ng4, while the queen also supports tactics against e6 and f7) 16...Nxc3 17 bxc3 Qd5 18 Bd2 g6?! (Black should rarely make such an advance voluntarily) 19 Bc2 Qa5 and now Plaskett recommends 20 Bb3! (Diagram 47)\n\nDiagram 47 (B) A dangerous white set-up 54\n\nwith advantage to White: he threatens various nasty sacrifices on the light squares; may also be able to advance with Rad1, c4 and d5; and Black lacks counterplay for his slightly shaky king position. Black might try to play for exchanges with 20...Bd5?!, but after 21 Qh6 a rook lift is threatened and 21...Ne4? fails to 22 Rxe4! Bxe4 23 Re1 Bd5 24 Re3! (Plaskett) with a winning attack. b) 14...Nc6!? breaks with Black’s development scheme to awkwardly attack d4 and threaten an exchange of knights. c) 14...Rc8 also appears fine for Black; for example, 15 Bg5 Nbd5 16 Qd3 g6 17 Bh6 Re8 18 a3 Nxc3 19 bxc3 Qd5 20 f3 Nd7 was about equal in B.D.Smith-K.Sakai, correspondence 2002 (note that 21 Nxf7!? Kxf7 22 Ba2 isn’t decisive due to 22...Nc5). 13 a3 Nbd5 14 Qd3 Bc6 15 Re1 (Diagram 48)\n\nDiagram 48 (B) White will force a weakening ...g6 15...g6?! A small inaccuracy as there was no need to hurry with this. Instead 15...Rc8 16 Bg5 g6 17 Bh6 Re8 would have left Black a useful tempo up on the game. I suspect Straeter would have preferred 16 Ne5 when 16...Re8 (and not 16...Qb6?! 17 Nxd5! Bxd5? 18 Nd7) is a useful move to both cover e6 and prepare ...g6 and ...Bg7. 16 Bh6 Re8 17 Ne5 Bf8 18 Bg5!? Keeping pieces on in a bid to maintain some pressure. Quite possibly it was, though, slightly preferable to exchange on f8 when White can aim to exploit the weakened dark squares with Qd2-h6. NOTE: An exchange on c6 with 18 Nxc6 bxc6 does not favour White, despite winning the bishop pair and splitting Black’s queenside. The c6-pawn is not at all easy to attack and White will continue to struggle to find a good role for his light-squared bishop, while Black may place White’s b-pawn under some pressure. 18...Bg7 19 Ba2 Qd6 20 Qh3 (Diagram 49)\n\n55\n\nDiagram 49 (B) Black remains pretty solid... White’s pieces now occupy fairly aggressive squares, but Black remains pretty solid... 20...Ne7? ...or rather he did. Hladik wants to meet 21 Qh4 with 21...Nf5, but unfortunately he underestimates the potential power of White’s a2-bishop. Instead the position would have remained roughly equal after 20...Rac8 21 Qh4 Nxc3 22 bxc3 Nd5 23 Qg3 b5. 21 Nxf7! (Diagram 50)\n\nDiagram 50 (B) ...but then falls for a typical blow A standard IQP blow and already Black could pretty much resign since 21...Kxf7 22 Rxe6 is crushing. 56\n\n21...Qxd4 22 Qxe6 h5 23 Ne5+ Kh7 24 Bxf6 Ng8 25 Qf7 Nxf6 26 Qxg6+ Kh8 27 Nf7+ Kg8 28 Nh6+ Kh8 29 Qxg7+! 1-0 Points to Remember 1. Attacking players with some IQP experience may wish to consider 8 e4 as an alternative to 8 dxc5.\n\n2. White can only play 8 e4 after 6...Bd6, and not against 6...Be7 when it just loses a pawn. 3. In any IQP position a Bb1/Bc2 and Qd3 battery is a useful way to force the weakening ...g6. 4. Especially when there’s a knight on e5, look out for sacrificial opportunities on f7 and e6. White Plays 8 dxc5 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 e6 4 Bd3 c5 5 c3 Nc6 6 Nbd2 Bd6 7 0-0 0-0 8 dxc5 Bxc5 9 e4 (Diagram 51)\n\nDiagram 51 (B) White’s main continuation White’s main choice, aiming to advance with e4-e5 and then to blow Black away on the kingside. Black’s two main defences both address that plan: 9...dxe4 is the subject of our next section and the main line, 9...Qc7, that of the next chapter. 9...e5!? From certain Colle sources, one would have thought that this was pretty much Black’s only alternative to 9...Qc7 and 9...dxe4. However, he actually has a whole raft of alternatives, many of which remain both quite rare and rather unexplored: a) 9...d4? 10 Nb3 wins the d-pawn, such as with 10...Bb6 11 e5 (Diagram 52)\n\n57\n\nDiagram 52 (B) White wins a pawn 11...Nd5 (and not, of course, 11...Ne8 12 cxd4 Bxd4?? 13 Nbxd4 Nxd4 14 Nxd4 Qxd4?? 15 Bxh7+) 12 Nbxd4.\n\nb) 9...b6 ignores White’s ideas to continue Black’s development. Let’s see what happens if White simply gets on with e4-e5: 10 e5 Nd7 11 Re1 and we reach the first of many French-type positions which we will encounter. Black must, of course, avoid 11...Qc7?? 12 Bxh7+, but the thematic 11...f6 doesn’t appear too bad for him; for example, 12 exf6 Nxf6 (12...Qxf6 13 Qe2 – and not the tempting 13 Bxh7+?! Kxh7 14 Rxe6 Bxf2+! 15 Kh1 Qf5 16 Rxc6 when White’s poorly co-ordinated pieces give Black dangerous compensation – is probably a little better for White with the idea of 13...e5 14 b4! Be7 15 Bc2 and 16 Bb3) 13 Nb3 Bd6 (Diagram 53),\n\nDiagram 53 (W) Resembling a French Tarrasch 58\n\nalthough ...b6 isn’t especially useful once Black goes ...f6 and White is a little better after 14 Bg5 (with Tarraschesque ideas of Bh4-g3, but an immediate 14 Nbd4 Nxd4 15 cxd4 is also a reasonable try for an edge) 14...Qc7 (and not 14...e5? 15 Bb5 – it’s never easy for Black to quickly advance his e-pawn in these positions) 15 Bxf6! (15 Nbd4 Nxd4 16 cxd4 isn’t especially clear after 16...Ng4 or even 16...Ne4!?) 15...Rxf6 16 Nbd4 Bd7 17 Qe2 with a grip on the e5-square. TIP: After 9...b6 White can immediately push with 10 e5, but he may in general find it helpful to delay that advance until after 10 Qe2; a useful move which both covers f2 and helps to control the e5square in the event of an e5 f6; exf6 exchange. After 9...b6, White might thus also opt for 10 Qe2 when E.Roblek-M.Vecek, correspondence 1997, for example, continued 10...Bb7 (10...Qc7 is probably a better try, transposing to a position we’ll consider via 9...Qc7 10 Qe2 b6) 11 e5 Nd7 12 Nb3 Be7 13 Bf4 (Diagram 54)\n\nDiagram 54 (B) White has kingside chances with a typical edge which turned into a useful attack after 13...Nc5 14 Nxc5! bxc5 15 b3 Qb6 16 Rfe1 a5 17 Ng5!. c) 9...h6!? eliminates any notion of a Greek Gift after e5 and following 10 Qe2 Qc7 play has transposed to the next chapter, as does 10...Bb6 11 Bc2!? Qc7. WARNING: When he advances to e5, White must ensure that his pawn is well protected. It usually is, but after 10...Bb6 11 e5? Nd7 12 Nb3 Bc7! 13 Bf4, 13...f6 is rather awkward, winning the e5pawn unless White tries the desperate and unconvincing 14 exf6 Bxf4 15 Qxe6+ Rf7 (A.Habib-E.Kengis, Damascus 2003); for example, 16 Bg6 Nde5 17 Bxf7+ Nxf7 18 Qe2 Qxf6 and the two unopposed bishops far outweigh White’s extra rook and pawn. d) For 9...Be7 10 Qe2 Qc7 see the move order 9...Qc7 10 Qe2 Be7 in Chapter Two. Instead 10...b6 is very similar to variation ‘b’ above. White can now close the centre immediately or try 11 Re1!?, aiming to deflect Black’s light-squared bishop away from the defence of e6 so that Black finds it harder to counter e5 with ...f6; for example, 11...Bb7 12 e5 Nd7 13 Nb3 Re8 14 Nbd4 a6 15 Nxc6 Bxc6 16 Nd4 Bb7 17 Qg4 gave White a pleasant edge in L.Fieschi-F.Grillo, Salsomaggiore Terme 2005. Here Black lacks counterplay against White’s kingside build-up and will probably have to resort to ...f6 or ...f5 at some point, but then his light-squared bishop is misplaced. 59\n\ne) 9...Bd6 10 Qe2 (Diagram 55)\n\nDiagram 55 (B) Pushing through e4-e5 10...Qc7 reaches another position we’ll deal with via 9...Qc7 – I’m afraid this section is full of transpositions. Instead 10...Bc7!? (or 9...Bb6 10 Qe2 Bc7) is a radical plan to maintain control of the e5square. Since White can’t push e5 without losing his e-pawn, he should switch plans with Bronznik’s idea of 11 Rd1!?, preparing Nb3 and dissuading any notion of 11...e5?! in view of 12 exd5 Nxd5 13 Nc4. f) 9...Re8 is another move which allows White to choose between waiting with 10 Qe2 and the immediate 10 e5. The former is Bronznik’s main subject, but the latter is also a reasonable try; for example, 10...Nd7 (or 10...Ng4!? 11 Qe2 f6 12 Nb3 Bb6 13 exf6 Nxf6 and now White should give serious thought to changing the central structure with 14 c4!?; instead 14 Bf4? Bc7? 15 Ne5 Nd7? (Diagram 56)\n\nDiagram 56 (W) 60\n\nWhat’s White’s best move? 16 Bxh7+! Kxh7 17 Qh5+ Kg8 18 Qf7+ Kh7 19 Nxc6 bxc6 20 Bxc7 was excellent for White in S.MarshD.Henderson, Newcastle 1993, but 14...e5 would have been somewhat stronger) 11 Nb3 (or 11 Qe2!?, intending to transpose after 11...Qc7 to a position we’ll consider via 9...Qc7 10 Qe2 Re8 11 e5 Nd7) 11...Be7 12 Re1 f6 (an essential break in this sort of position to both free Black’s position and break up White’s kingside chances) 13 exf6 Bxf6 14 Qc2! (this is why 12 Re1 was preferred to 12 Qe2; Black is now a little tangled and White slightly for choice) 14...Nf8 (and not 14...g6? 15 Bxg6! hxg6 16 Qxg6+ Bg7 17 Bh6 Re7 18 Bxg7 Rxg7 19 Qxe6+ Kh8 20 Qxd5 when White emerges with four pawns for the piece) 15 Nfd4 Bd7 16 Nxc6 Bxc6 17 Nd4 e5 18 Nxc6 bxc6 19 f3 Bg5 20 Bxg5 Qxg5 21 c4! gave White an edge in J.LyonL.Cooper, correspondence 1989, but Black probably does better with 15...e5!?. Thus White might wish to consider too 15 Rd1!?, aimed against ...e5 and intending to unravel after 15...Qe7 16 Bf1! with g3, Bg2 and possibly Be3, continuing to restrain Black in the centre. Returning to 9...e5 (Diagram 57):\n\nDiagram 57 (W) Black also seizes some space 10 exd5 This useful multipurpose move opens the d3-bishop’s path, while preparing to improve the d2-knight and then to develop the dark-squared bishop. I believe it is also the most testing option at White’s disposal, but in practice 10 Qe2 has actually been more popular, transposing to our main continuation after 8 Qe2 above (8...e5 9 dxc5 Bxc5 10 e4). 10...Qxd5 One would be forgiven for thinking that Black’s active and fairly easy development (after either the text or 10...Nxd5 – the subject of Game 4) has already enabled him to equalize. A closer inspection reveals, though, that Black’s pieces are on such squares as to permit White to drive them backwards as he develops with tempo. Following either 11 Qc2 or 11 Qe2 White prepares Ne4 hitting the c5-bishop, after which one harmonious option is to complete development with Bg5 and Rad1. Whether this is enough to give White a definite edge is not yet totally clear, but certainly Black will need to find some accurate moves to remain on a roughly even keel. 11 Qc2! (Diagram 58) 61\n\nDiagram 58 (B) Eyeing up Black’s h-pawn Once again 11 Qe2 is somewhat more common when 11...Bg4 12 Ne4 transposes to note ‘a’ to Black’s 10th move in ‘the early moves’ section. The text, taking aim at h7 and preparing 12 Ne4, was used by Colle himself against no less a player than Rubinstein, but has so far only been repeated on eleven occasions. Despite that, I believe it is the trickiest move for Black to face and not only if he again continues with 11...Bg4. TIP: Colle theory is still developing and the opening remains a fairly fertile ground for those who like to try and resurrect forgotten or discarded ideas. As well as the text, we’ve seen that 8 e4 has recently obtained a new lease of life, but which variation will do so next? 11...Bg4?! Black hopes that the attack on the f3-knight will prevent 12 Ne4, but if so then he’s in for a nasty surprise. He has also tried: a) 11...Re8? was seen in the stem game, E.Colle-A.Rubinstein, Budapest 1926, but this natural-looking move fails to pay any attention to White’s plans. Colle in his usual fashion opted for the aggressive 12 Bc4!? Qd7 13 Ng5, but as Bronznik points out there was nothing wrong with winning a clear pawn with 12 Ne4 (Diagram 59)\n\n62\n\nDiagram 59 (B) Black must lose a pawn 12...Nxe4 13 Bxe4 and h7 falls.\n\nb) 11...h6 prevents White’s threat, but after 12 Ne4 Nxe4 (or 12...Be7 13 Rd1 Qa5 as in R.Frosch-H.Titz, Austrian League 2003, and now not the slow 14 h3, but 14 Nxf6+ Bxf6 15 Qe2, intending 16 Qe4 and retaining an edge even in the event of 15...Ne7 16 Nd2!) 13 Bxe4 Black’s queen is forced to a slightly undesirable square and White can gain the advantage; for example, 13...Qd6 14 Re1 Re8 15 Be3! and White had a nagging edge in S.Savova-G.Stanciu, Balatonfured 1987 (White has some pressure down the d-file and against e5; in the game Black could find nothing better than ceding the c8-bishop with 15...Bxe3 16 Rxe3 Bg4 17 h3 Bxf3 18 Rxf3), or 13...Qe6 14 Re1 (Diagram 60)\n\nDiagram 60 (B) The pressure against e5 is awkward 63\n\n14...f6 (E.Michalski-M.Blasiak, Pyskovice 1991) 15 Bxh6! gxh6 16 Bxc6 (Bronznik) and White wins a pawn since 16...Qxc6? loses to 17 Qg6+ Kh8 18 Qxh6+ Kg8 19 Qg6+ Kh8 20 Re4. NOTE: The e4-square is an ideal home for White’s pieces in this line (from there the knight, lightsquared bishop and queen all often create threats), while Black may find that having his pawn on e5 isn’t always so useful (it weakens his control of the central light squares and to defend it usually requires a small concession). Even the ubiquitous Bronznik (the author of a fine and extremely detailed work on the Colle) has been unable to find a way for Black to equalize against 11 Qc2. His best suggestion is 11...Be7 12 Ne4 h6, but White remains slightly for choice after 13 Nxf6+ Bxf6 14 Rd1 Qe6 (14...Qa5 15 Qe2 transposes to our improvement over Frosch-Titz, above) 15 Be3 and Be4, possibly followed by a doubling on the d-file or some sort of queenside probe, like a4-a5. 12 Ne4! (Diagram 61)\n\nDiagram 61 (B) Logical and strong white play A discovery of the Spanish Grandmaster, Marc Narciso Dublan. White doesn’t worry about the doubling of his f-pawns as he’s going to win h7, and this is much stronger than the previously played 12 Ng5 h6 13 Nge4 Nxe4 14 Nxe4. 12...Bxf3 13 gxf3 Kh8? Defending h7, but falling for the second part of White’s trap begun by 12 Ne4. This has actually occurred in the only two games so far played with 12 Ne4 and I suspect White’s next move is quite easy to miss, especially with Black’s attention focused on h7. Instead 13...Rfd8?! 14 Nxf6+ gxf6 15 Bxh7+ Kg7 16 Be4 leaves White a clear pawn ahead (and he is no slower than Black at getting a rook to the g-file), and even the relatively best 13...Nxe4!? 14 Bxe4 Qe6 15 Bxh7+ Kh8 doesn’t appear to supply enough compensation after 16 Bf5 Qf6 17 Qe4; for example, the direct 17...g6 18 Bh3 Kg7 19 Qg4 Rh8 fails to 20 Bg5 Qf5 21 Qxf5 gxf5 22 Bxf5 Rh5 (or 22...Rag8 23 Kh1 Rh5 24 Be3 Bxe3 25 Bg4!) 23 h4 f6 24 Bg4 Rh7 25 Be3 Bxe3 26 fxe3 Rxh4 27 Kg2 with some advantage for White in the endgame. 14 c4! (Diagram 62) 14...Qd7?\n\n64\n\nDiagram 62 (B) Black loses material As Bronznik points out, Black should try 14...Qd4 15 Be3 Nxe4! 16 Bxd4 Nxd4 17 Qa4 Nd2, although White remains at least clearly better after 18 Be4!? Nxf1 19 Kxf1. 15 Nxc5 Qh3 16 Bf5! White now defends with either 16...Qxf3 17 Qd3 (M.Narciso Dublan-L.Barczay, Budapest 2001) or 16...Qh5 17 Be3 Qxf3 18 Be4 Nxe4 19 Qxe4 (C.Drechsler-G.Milosevic, Zurich 2006), leaving Black a clear piece in arrears. Theoretical Conclusion Black’s alternatives to 9...Qc7 and 9...dxe4 aren’t too bad. Should White force through e4-e5 then he usually gains slightly the more comfortable position and, should Black continue in a rather slow vein, good attacking chances. 9...e5 is a much more proactive handling of the black pieces, but the rediscovery of 10 exd5 Qxd5 11 Qc2 appears promising. Illustrative Games Game 4 A.Benderac-Le Thanh Tu Turin Women’s Olympiad 2006 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 c5 3 e3 d5 4 c3 e6 5 Bd3 Nc6 6 0-0 Bd6 7 Nbd2 0-0 8 dxc5 Bxc5 9 e4 e5 10 exd5 Nxd5!? (Diagram 63)\n\n65\n\nDiagram 63 (W) The e4-square beckons White’s pieces Black declines to develop her queen and then see it quickly attacked. Nevertheless, this alternative recapture isn’t a simple equalizer: White will again gain a tempo on the c5-bishop and can target both e5 and h7. 11 Ne4 Making good use of the e4-square and hinting at aggressive manoeuvres on the kingside. White has also played both 11 Nb3 and 11 Nc4 intending 12 Be4, but against the latter, the active 11...Re8! 12 Be4 Be6 13 Ncxe5 Nxe5 14 Nxe5 Qc7 is a dangerous gambit, R.Schulz-S.Schoof, German League 1991. 11...Be7 Black naturally wants to keep her dark-squared bishop and this is the more prudent retreat, preparing to assist in any kingside defence. Alternatively 11...Bb6 12 Bc4 (Diagram 64)\n\n66\n\nDiagram 64 (B) White has an edge 12...Be6?! 13 Nfg5! works out well for White, and even the superior 12...Nc7 leaves him with an edge after 13 Qxd8 (13 Qc2!? also deserves consideration, intending 14 Neg5 and if 13...Bf5, 14 Bg5) 13...Rxd8 14 Neg5 Ne6 15 Nxe6 Bxe6 16 Bxe6 fxe6 17 Re1 (P.Heyn-W.Zeiske, correspondence 1993). 12 Ng3 Colle’s choice, aiming to dissuade Black from a swift advance of the f-pawn, but 12 Qe2!? (Diagram 65)\n\nDiagram 65 (B) White provokes ...f5 might be a better try. The main point is that 12...f5?! 13 Rd1! (Bronznik’s untested idea and a better move order than the previously played 13 Bc4 when 13...b5!? gives Black good counterplay after both 14 Bb3 Na5 and 14 Bxb5 fxe4 15 Bxc6 exf3 16 Qxe5 Nb6 17 Bxa8 Nxa8) 13...fxe4? 14 Bxe4 Be6 15 c4 (Diagram 66)\n\n67\n\nDiagram 66 (B) Regaining the piece with interest regains the piece with some advantage after 15...Nc3 16 bxc3 Qc7 17 Bd5. Finding a good improvement for Black after 13 Rd1 is not so easy: 13...Be6? 14 Neg5 clearly isn’t one; 13...h6?! 14 Ng3 wins a pawn in view of the neat tactic 14...e4 15 Nxe4! fxe4 16 Bxe4; and even Bronznik’s main line of 13...Kh8 14 Neg5! Bxg5 (threatening 15 Bc4 and once again hoping for 14...e4?! 15 Nxe4!) 15 Bxg5 Qc7 16 Bb5 leaves Black in serious trouble. Almost certainly Black should prefer to keep his f-pawn firmly on f7 after 12 Qe2, and prophylactically leaving the d-file with 12...Qc7 makes a lot of sense. Now 13 Ng3 angles for a favourable version of our main game; White’s position is a little easier to play, but Black should be able to secure a reasonable game with 13...g6!? 14 Re1 (or 14 Rd1 Nf4!) 14...Re8, keeping White out of f5 and intending ...Be6 and/or ...Nf4. 12...f5! Bravely, and correctly, taking up the challenge. 13 Bc4 Be6 (Diagram 67)\n\n68\n\nDiagram 67 (W) 14 Qe2 contains a double threat 14 Re1 Just as at move 12, 14 Qe2!? looks like a more critical and better try for the advantage. TIP: Both Qe2 and Re1 attack the e5-pawn, but only the former also threatens to increase the pressure with Rd1. After 14 Qe2, 14...e4?! (14...Qc7?! 15 Re1 e4? 16 Nxe4! was rather effective in A.Woods-F.Ashley, correspondence 1964; but after the slightly artificial-looking 14...Qd6 it turns out that White doesn’t have anything much; for instance, 15 Rd1 Rad8 16 Bb3 is repelled by Bronznik’s 16...Na5!? 17 Qxe5 Qxe5 18 Nxe5 Nxb3 19 axb3 f4 with good compensation) 15 Rd1 (Diagram 68)\n\nDiagram 68 (B) 69\n\nBlack can easily drop material the multiple pins, allied to the threat of 16 Nxe4, are rather awkward for Black and he has to find 15...Qd6! to avoid material loss (15...Qd7? is less effective due to 16 Ne1 Ne5 17 Bxd5 Bxd5 18 c4, but with the queen defended on d6, 18...Nxc4 becomes possible). 14...e4 15 Ng5 Deviating from E.Colle-M.Euwe, Amsterdam 1928, in which 15 Bg5 Kh8!? (the future World Champion allows White to retain a tiny pull in a more complex situation than that which would have arisen after 15...Bxg5 16 Nxg5 Qxg5, transposing to our main game) 16 Bxe7 Ncxe7 17 Nd4 Qb6 18 Qb3 Bg8 19 Rad1 (19 Qxb6!? axb6 20 Bxd5 Bxd5 21 b3 looks like a better try to retain an edge), and now 19...Qg6!? (Diagram 69)\n\nDiagram 69 (W) Would you capture on f5? has been roundly but wrongly criticized. Colle continued 20 Nc2, and the game was later drawn, passing over the tactical try 20 Ngxf5?!. I suspect he was put off by the continuation 20...Rxf5! 21 Nxf5 Qxf5 22 Qxb7 Rf8 when Black has dangerous compensation with ideas of both ...e3, and ...Qg5 and ...Nf4; play around for a while with a human or silicon sparring partner and you’ll quickly get the idea.\n\n15...Bxg5 16 Bxg5 Qxg5 17 Bxd5 Qg6 17...Qe7 was also enough for full equality. 18 Bxe6+ Surely 18 Qb3 Bxd5 19 Qxd5+ Qf7 20 Rad1 was a little more accurate, whereas the way White chooses to exchange queens leaves her worse in the ending due to her inferior structure. 18...Qxe6 19 Qb3?! Qxb3 20 axb3 Rad8 21 Red1 g6 22 Kf1 One plan is to break up Black’s pawn phalanx before her king reaches e5 and it was quite possible to start with 22 f3. 22...Kf7 (Diagram 70) 23 Ne2! a6\n\n70\n\nDiagram 70 (W) Unambitious play leaves White worse 23...Ne5 24 Nd4 a6 25 f3 would have eroded d3 as a permanent outpost, but the Vietnamese is in no hurry. 24 b4?! Weakening c4 like this makes no sense to me. Better was 24 Nf4, heading for d5. 24...Rfe8 25 Rac1 Kf6 26 Nf4 Ke5 27 Ne2 Kf6 Curiously Black is happy with a draw when 27...Rd3 would have left White with a tricky defensive task. Black wasn’t out-rated by that many points (2239 to 2293), but perhaps the repetition clinched a tight match or she wasn’t enjoying the Olympiad’s ludicrously-fast FIDE time control. 28 Nf4 Ke5 29 Ne2 ½-½ Points to Remember 1. White should meet 9...e5 with 10 exd5, rather than 10 Qe2.\n\n2. 10...Nxd5 is probably superior to 10...Qxd5, but Black must still play accurately to equalize, especially should White try one of the two testing Qe2 approaches. 3. Piece control of e4 is a useful asset. 4. Should Black play ...f5, watch for tactics down the d- and e-files, and along the a2-g8 diagonal. 5. If exchanges are imminent, try to arrange them on your terms. The Endgame 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 e6 4 Bd3 c5 5 c3 Nc6 6 0-0 Bd6 7 Nbd2 0-0 8 dxc5 Bxc5 9 e4 dxe4\n\nRuling out e4-e5 once and for all. Technically speaking this exchange does not have to led to an endgame, nor does it all that often in practice, but the following exchanges are often cited by some white players as a reason for preferring 8 Re1 or 8 Qe2 to the main line. However, even those who were dreaming of a decisive sacrifice on h7 should be happy if Black exchanges twice on e4 and then on d1 because the resulting position is rather pleasant for White. Let’s see why: 10 Nxe4 (Diagram 71)\n\n71\n\nDiagram 71 (B) Black plays for exchanges 10...Nxe4 An important alternative is 10...Be7, keeping pieces on and reaching a structure which one would more usually associate with a king pawn opening; for example, the Caro or French Rubinstein. Traditionally such a position was often thought to slightly favour White due to his queenside majority. Nowadays, though, it is realized that advancing the queenside pawns is no easy task, at least in the short term. Instead White should look to use his extra space to generate pressure, down the central files and especially on the kingside. White’s most popular response to 10...Be7 is 11 Qe2 as we will see in Game 5, but once again 11 Qc2!? (Diagram 72)\n\nDiagram 72 (B) Taking aim at h7 72\n\nis a fairly rare but venomous alternative: a) 11...h6?! 12 Nxf6+! (many other moves have been tried, but this is far the most dangerous) 12...Bxf6 13 Qe2 (Diagram 73)\n\nDiagram 73 (B) White again targets the h7-square leaves Black sorely regretting ever touching his h-pawn. In P.Corrales Ibanez-A.Garcia Ruiz, Malaga 1999, White was quick to exploit his attacking opportunities: 13...Qc7 (perhaps Black already has to try the radical and not exactly ideal 13...Qa5!?, with the idea of 14 Qe4 Qf5) 14 Qe4 Rd8 15 b3! Bxc3? 16 Qh7+ Kf8 17 Ba3+ Bb4 18 Bb2 f5? 19 Qh8+ Ke7 20 Qxg7+ Kd6 21 Be5+ 1-0. b) 11...Nxe4 12 Bxe4 f5?! is an active attempt to avoid allowing White an attack as 12...h6 and 12...g6 would do. Here, though, it fails to convince in view of 13 Bxc6 bxc6 (A.Alekseeva-L.Fedoseeva, St Petersburg 2001), and now Bronznik’s 14 Bf4 with a useful grip on the e5-square and potential pressure against the e6-pawn. c) 11...Nd5 12 Ng3! (forcing a kingside weakness after all) 12...h6 13 Re1 b6 14 Bd2 Bb7 15 Rad1 Qc7 16 Qc1! (Diagram 74)\n\n73\n\nDiagram 74 (B) Lining up a sacrifice on h6 gave White good attacking prospects in the classic game A.Romanovsky-B.Blumenfeld, St Petersburg 1905. TIP: Whenever Black meets a threat to h7 with ...h6, White should always look out for sacrificial opportunities on g7 and h6 in the resulting play. Indeed Romanovsky-Blumenfeld continued 16...Bd6?! 17 Nh5 Ne5 18 Nxe5 Bxe5 19 Bxh6! with a thematic and powerful attack. Returning to 10...Nxe4: 11 Bxe4 (Diagram 75)\n\nDiagram 75 (B) Black shouldn’t rush into exchanges 74\n\n11...Qxd1?! Continuing the hoovering policy. Should Black instead wait with, say, 11...h6, White has a pleasant edge and attacking prospects whether he continues with 12 Bf4 or 12 Qe2, and after the latter one idea is Pezerovic’s plan of b3, Bb2, a rook to the d-file and c4. Black can also keep the queens on with 11...Qc7, but then the direct 12 Ng5 h6 13 Bh7+! Kh8 14 Bc2 (Diagram 76)\n\nDiagram 76 (B) The knight is immune is rather cute and effective: a) 14...e5? 15 Qh5 Qe7 16 Ne4! (Diagram 77)\n\nDiagram 77 (B) 75\n\nBlack lacks kingside defenders demonstrates White’s attacking potential. The immediate threat is to capture on h6 and Black actually lacks a good defence; for example, 16...Kg8 17 Bxh6! (17 Bg5!? first and only then 17...f6 18 Bxh6 gxh6 19 Nxc5 is also pretty effective) 17...gxh6 18 Qxh6 Bf5 (the best defence, whereas 18...f5?? loses immediately to 19 Bb3+ Rf7 20 Nf6+) 19 Nf6+ Qxf6 20 Qxf6 Bxc2 21 Rfe1 and Black’s three minor pieces were insufficient compensation for the queen in view of White’s ongoing attacking prospects in K.Gilg-W.Von Holzhausen, Breslau 1925. b) 14...Rd8? is another typical way in which Black has been known to underestimate White’s attack. NOTE: White’s bishops on c1 and c2 might appear some way from the black kingside, but they are both pointing straight at it. Indeed this is a classic case of the dangerous ‘raking bishop pair’. After 14...Rd8? 15 Qh5! Kg8?! (but 15...Rf8 16 Nxf7+ Rxf7 17 Qxc5 is also rather grim for Black), White wins with 16 Nxf7! Rd5 17 Nxh6+! (Diagram 78)\n\nDiagram 78 (B) Stripping away the defences 17...gxh6 18 Qe8+ Kg7 19 Bxh6+!, and the black king is hunted down, or more mundanely after 16...Qxf7 17 Bh7+ Kf8 18 Qxc5+ Qe7 19 Qe3 (Oleinikov). c) 14...Be7 15 Re1 (Bronznik’s suggestion of 15 Qh5!? and if 15...Kg8, 16 Nf3 is also rather dangerous) 15...Qd8! (15...b6? 16 Qd3! g6 17 Qh3 once again sees the white pieces wreck havoc after 17...Kg7 18 Nxe6+! Bxe6 19 Qxh6+ Kg8 20 Bxg6 fxg6 21 Qxg6+ Kh8 22 Rxe6 or 17...h5 18 Nxf7+! Rxf7 19 Bxg6 Bd6 20 Qxh5+ Kg8 21 Re4, and in both cases Black is unlikely to survive long) 16 Qxd8 Bxd8 17 Ne4 saw Black sensibly force the queens off, but White retained a small edge due to the weakness of the d6-square in F.Rinaldi-W.Ottenweller, correspondence 1999. d) 14...f5! is probably the best defence. The ever-creative Bronznik suggests that White can still sacrifice with 15 Qh5 Kg8 16 Ne4 Be7 17 Bxh6?! (17 Ng3 should be preferred with an unclear tussle ahead), but for once I find his line of 17...fxe4! 18 Bxe4 Qe5 19 Qg6 Qf6 20 Qh7+ Kf7 21 Be3 not wholly convincing after just 21...Bd7 with the plan of fleeing with the black king. 12 Rxd1 (Diagram 79)\n\n76\n\nDiagram 79 (B) Compare the light-squared bishops One of the attractions of the Colle to players like Euwe and Colle himself in the 1920s and 1930s was that White often found himself with a 3v2 queenside majority. Nowadays, thanks to the efforts of many theorists and writers, most notably John Watson, we appreciate much more Black’s central majority and ability to sometimes even launch a queenside minority attack. NOTE: Despite all our modern understanding, the text position is still somewhat better for White. He has much the freer position (try talking to the c8-bishop and he’ll tell you!) and his queenside pawns are quick to advance and with tempo. 12...f6 Rubinstein’s idea to mobilize Black’s central pawns may be a little slow, but is probably Black’s best defence. Alternatively, the attempt to force further exchanges with 12...Rd8 is seen in Game 6, while 12...Ne7 13 Ne5!? (an interesting plan, although the more straightforward 13 Bf4 followed by Bd6 and a doubling of rooks on the d-file is also pretty effective) 13...f6 14 Nc4 a5?! (this is probably too weakening, but 14...Nd5!? 15 Ne3 Nb6 16 b4 Be7 17 a4 is also better for White) 15 Be3 Bxe3 16 fxe3! Ra6 17 Rd6 Rxd6 18 Nxd6 Rd8 19 Nxc8 Rxc8 20 Rd1 gave White a rather favourable ending in A.Dergatschova Daus-J.Nill, German League 2001. Note the bishop’s superiority and also the way in which White’s rook will be quick to infiltrate against Black’s queenside, such as with Rd6-b6-b5. 13 b4! (Diagram 80)\n\n77\n\nDiagram 80 (B) White has a useful initiative Wasting no time in beginning queenside operations. Colle himself preferred 13 Be3 Bxe3 14 fxe3 and White has also been quite successful with this approach, especially when Black doesn’t take control of d6 with 14...Nd8! 15 Rd2 Nf7. WARNING: After 16 Rad1 g6, White’s control of the d-file is useful, but that on its own is not going to win the game. He needs to advance his queenside pawns and/or to create further weaknesses before Black unravels. E.Colle-A.Rubinstein, Berlin 1926, was a good example of the dangers of drifting planlessly for White: 17 Bc2 a6 18 Ba4?! b5 19 Bb3 Ra7! 20 Nd4 Re7 and Black slowly took over the initiative. Going back, White should prefer either Koltanowski’s suggestion of 18 Bb3 or 18 c4!?, intending Be4 and a rapid queenside advance, although Black remains pretty solid in both cases after 18...b6. 13...Bb6 The bishop will be further targeted here, but neither is 13...Be7 sufficient to solve Black’s difficulties. J.Roth-B.Foerster, Schwaebisch Gmuend 2003, continued 14 Be3 (Oleinikov’s suggestion of 14 a3 with the idea of a clamping c4-c5 is also strong) 14...Nd8 15 Nd4 f5 16 Bf3 a6?! (preventing Nb5, but White is quick to reveal the downside to this advance) 17 Nb3! Nf7 18 Na5 Rb8 19 Ba7 Ra8 20 Bb6 and Black remained some way from being able to free his light-squared bishop. 14 a4 (Diagram 81)\n\n78\n\nDiagram 81 (B) Mobilizing the queenside majority Undoubtedly White has some queenside initiative here and should be quite pleased with the outcome of the opening. His immediate idea is shown by 14...e5? 15 a5 Bc7 16 a6! which significantly increased the pressure in K.Nickl-H.Wohlfahrt, Austrian League 1994. Black can defend better, but his problems persist after something like 14...a6 15 a5 Ba7 16 c4 e5 17 Bd5+ Kh8 (R.Rehm-T.Loesch, Waldshut 2002) when 18 Ba3 is pretty strong, or 14...a5 15 b5 Ne7 16 Ba3 Re8 17 c4 (Diagram 82),\n\nDiagram 82 (B) Black remains badly cramped intending Bd6 and c5.\n\n79\n\nTheoretical Conclusion 9...dxe4 is a reaction which one can expect from an opponent who finds themselves in the Colle main line without any theoretical knowledge and worried about the e5-advance. This rather simple approach gives White good chances for an edge whether Black prepares to soak up some kingside pressure after 10 Nxe4 Be7, or prefers to suffer in a queenless middlegame (it is often referred to as an endgame, but it’s really a little too early – despite this section’s heading! – to use such a term). Illustrative Games Game 5 J.Pelikian-L.Coelho Santos 2000 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 e3 c5 4 c3 e6 5 Bd3 Nc6 6 Nbd2 Bd6 7 0-0 0-0 8 dxc5 Bxc5 9 e4 dxe4 10 Nxe4 Be7 11 Qe2 Qc7 (Diagram 83)\n\nDiagram 83 (W) There are several attacking plans NOTE: With this particular move order, 11 Qc2!? is a good alternative, but the text reaches an important position which also arises via 9...Qc7 10 Qe2 dxe4 11 Nxe4 Be7. 12 Nxf6+ White decides to force an immediate concession on the kingside, but in this particular position ...g6 is not such a big concession since Black’s dark-squared bishop is ready to slot into g7. White might thus prefer: a) 12 Nfg5!? g6 (and not 12...h6? 13 Nxf6+ Bxf6 14 Nh7, while 12...Nxe4?! 13 Qxe4 f5 14 Qc4 takes immediate aim at the newly-created weakness on e6) 13 Qf3 (Diagram 84)\n\n80\n\nDiagram 84 (B) A weakening ...g6 has been induced is an old idea of Tartakower’s, recently rediscovered. Black should respond not with 13...Nxe4?! 14 Bxe4 e5 15 Bd5 Nd8 16 Re1 which gave White awkward pressure in S.Tartakower-J.Molina, Argentina 1931, but either the untested 13...Nd5 or Bronznik’s idea of 13...Nh5!?, intending 14 g4!? Ne5 15 Qh3 Nxg4! 16 Qxg4 f5 17 Qg2 fxe4 18 Bxe4 with a rather unclear position full of mutual weaknesses. b) 12 Bg5 and now: b1) 12...Nxe4 13 Qxe4 f5! (the correct approach since White isn’t in a position to fix e6 as a weakness; instead 13...g6?! 14 Qh4! concedes some pressure) 14 Qh4 Bxg5 15 Nxg5 h6 16 Nf3 e5 (Diagram 85)\n\nDiagram 85 (W) Black’s central majority is dangerous 81\n\nsees Black mobilizing his centre to good effect. So too does 14 Qe2 e5 and even 14 Qc4!? (P.ShawP.Large, Halifax (rapid) 2004) doesn’t promise White any advantage after 14...Bd6! and 15...Kh8 (Bronznik). b2) Black doesn’t have to simplify, but should he prefer 12...Nd5!? then he must meet 13 Rad1 Rd8 14 Bb1!? Bd7 15 Bxe7 Ncxe7 16 Nfg5 with 16...h6!, and not 16...Nf5? which allowed Colle to carry out another of his beautiful trademark attacks: 17 Qh5 Nh6 18 Rxd5! exd5 19 Nf6+! gxf6 20 Qxh6 Bf5 21 Bxf5 fxg5 22 Bxh7+ Kh8 23 Bg6+ Kg8 24 Qh7+ Kf8 25 Re1 and 1-0 in E.Colle-G.Van Doesburgh, Bussem 1926. c) Waiting with 12 Re1!? also deserves attention and we will actually consider this position in the next chapter (via the move order 9...Qc7 10 Qe2 Be7 11 Re1 dxe4 12 Nxe4). 12...Bxf6 (Diagram 86)\n\nDiagram 86 (W) Again White has options 13 Qe4 Setting up the typical Colle queen and bishop battery, but should the reader find this too simplistic they may wish to explore, as well as White’s alternatives on the last turn, 13 Bg5!?; an idea which Smith and Hall drew attention to. Following 13...Qe7 (13...Bxg5!? 14 Nxg5 h6 is an alternative defence; in F.RinaldiS.Richkov, correspondence 1999, Black would have been close to full equality had he met 15 Bh7+ Kh8 16 Bc2 Kg8 17 Nf3 Rd8 18 Rad1 with 18...Bd7 19 Qe4 g6 and ...Kg7) 14 Qe4 g6, their idea was not 15 Qh4 Bxg5 16 Nxg5 f6 17 Ne4 e5 with equality (E.Colle-G.Maróczy, San Remo 1930), but 15 h4! e5 16 Qe3, intending to recapture on g5 with a clamping hxg5 and retaining an edge, such as with 16...Bg4 17 Be4 Rfe8 18 Rfe1 (Bronznik) due to the pressure against e5. NOTE: White must beware Black taking over the centre with ...e5 and ...f5, but ...e5 can sometimes become a weakness and tie Black’s pieces down, particularly if the pawn can neither be easily defended by ...f6 nor safely advanced. 13...g6 14 Bg5 14 Bh6 Bg7 15 Bxg7 Kxg7 is similar to the game: Black will complete his development with ...Bd7 and ...Rad8, and White lacks a good way to make any real progress on the kingside. 14...Bxg5 15 Nxg5 Ne5!
