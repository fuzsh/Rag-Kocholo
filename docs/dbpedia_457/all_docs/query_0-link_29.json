        "text": "A discrete choice experiment to explore patients' willingness to risk disease relapse from treatment withdrawal in psoriatic arthritis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRothery, Claire; Bojke, Laura; Richardson, Gerry; Bojke, Chris; Moverley, Anna; Coates, Laura; Thorp, Liz; Waxman, Robin; Helliwell, Philip\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess patient preferences for treatment-related benefits and risk of disease relapse in the management of low disease states of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Focus groups with patients and a literature review were undertaken to determine the characteristics of treatment and symptoms of PsA important to patients. Patient preferences were assessed using a discrete choice experiment which compared hypothetical treatment profiles of the risk and benefits of treatment withdrawal. The risk outcome included increased risk of disease relapse, while benefit outcomes included reduced sickness/nausea from medication and changes in health-related quality of life. Each patient completed 12 choice sets comparing treatment profiles. Preference weights were estimated using a logic regression model, and the maximum acceptable risk in disease relapse for a given improvement in benefit outcomes was elicited. Final sample included 136 patients. Respondents attached the greatest importance to eliminating severe side effects of sickness/nausea and the least importance to a change in risk of relapse. Respondents were willing to accept an increase in the risk of relapse of 32.6Â % in order to eliminate the side effects of sickness/nausea. For improvements in health status, the maximum acceptable risk in relapse was comparable to a movement from some to no sickness/nausea. The study suggests that patients in low disease states of PsA are willing to accept greater risks of relapse for improvements in side effects of sickness/nausea and overall health status, with the most important benefit attribute being the elimination of severe sickness or nausea.\n\nInitial experience with CMC-544 (inotuzumab ozogamicin) in pediatric patients with relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRytting, Michael; Triche, Lisa; Thomas, Deborah; O'Brien, Susan; Kantarjian, Hagop\n\n2014-02-01\n\nSurvival is poor in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and therapeutic options are limited. CMC-544 (inotuzumab ozogamicin) has shown significant activity in adult patients with relapsed and refractory ALL. We evaluated CMC-544 in pediatric patients with multiply relapsed ALL. Five children 4-15 years old with relapsed, CD 22 positive B-cell ALL were enrolled on a phase II non-randomized trial of CMC-544. CMC-544 was initially administered at 1.3 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. The dose then increased to 1.8 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Subsequently, a weekly schedule of CMC-544 given as 0.8 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by 0.5 mg/m(2) on days 8 and 15 was administered. All five patients had refractory relapsed B-cell ALL. Lymphoblasts for all patients highly expressed CD22. Four patients had two or more relapses before starting the study drug. One patient achieved a complete remission in the bone marrow and normal peripheral counts, and two patients achieved bone marrow morphologic remission with absolute neutrophils >1,000/Âµl but platelets <100,000/Âµl. Two patients had no response to the drug. Toxicities consisted of fever, sepsis, and liver enzyme elevation. Single agent CMC-544 given at the single dose of 1.8 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or given as a split, weekly dose was generally well tolerated considering the inherent risks in this population of patients and showed promising activity in pediatric patients with relapsed and refractory ALL.

Predictors of relapse in OP patients remain to be established. The aim of the present study was to identify factors related to relapse in OP patients. Methods This study was retrospectively performed in a tertiary referral center. Of 66 OP patients who were improved with or without treatment, 20 (30%) experienced relapse. The clinical and radiologic parameters in the relapse patient group (n=20) were compared to that in the non-relapse group (n=46). Results Multivariate analysis demonstrated that percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), PaO2/FiO2, and serum protein level were significant predictors of relapse in OP patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.97; p=0.018; OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04; p=0.042; and OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.87; p=0.039, respectively). Conclusion This study shows that FVC, PaO2/FiO2 and serum protein level at presentation can significantly predict relapse in OP patients.

Increasing disability likely impacts work and leisure productivity, and lowers quality of life. The objective of this study was to characterize from the patient's perspective the impact of a multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse in terms of the economic cost, work and leisure productivity, functional ability, and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), for a sample of patients with RRMS in the US treated with immunomodulatory agents. A cross-sectional, web-based, self-report survey was conducted among members of MSWatch.com, a patient support website now known as Copaxone.com. Qualified respondents in the US had been diagnosed with RRMS and were using an immunomodulatory agent. The survey captured costs of RRMS with questions about healthcare resource utilization, use of community services, and purchased alterations and assistive items related to MS. The Work and Leisure Impairment instrument and the EQ-5D were used to measure productivity losses and HR-QOL (health utility), respectively. The Goodin MS neurological impairment questionnaire was used to measure functional disability; questions were added about relapses in the past year. Of 711 qualified respondents, 67% reported having at least one relapse during the last year, with a mean of 2.2âÂ±â2.3 relapses/year. Respondents who experienced at least one relapse had significantly higher mean annual direct and indirect costs compared with those who did not experience a relapse ($US38â458 vs $US28â669; pâ=â0.0004) [year 2009 values]. Direct health-related costs accounted for the majority of the increased cost ($US5201; 53%) and were mainly due to increases in hospitalizations, medications, and ambulatory care. Indirect costs, including informal care and productivity loss, accounted for the\n\nPlasma exchange therapy in steroid-unresponsive relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrebst, Corinna; Reising, Ansgar; Kielstein, Jan T; Hafer, Carsten; Stangel, Martin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPlasma exchange (PE) is well established for conditions such as rapid progressive vasculitis associated with autoantibodies against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody disease, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Also, several neurological disorders, such as acute worsening in myasthenia gravis, Guillan-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), can successfully be treated with PE. Only small case series have previously shown that PE is also effective in relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We report our experiences of PE therapy in a series of 20 patients with 21 steroid unresponsive MS relapses. A marked-to-moderate clinical response with clear gain of function in 76% of patients with uni- or bilateral optic neuritis and in 87.5% of patients with relapses other than optic neuritis was observed. PE is an effective and well tolerated therapeutic option for steroid-unresponsive MS relapses.\n\nThe Wisconsin Predicting Patients' Relapse questionnaire\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBolt, Daniel M.; McCarthy, Danielle E.; Japuntich, Sandra J.; Fiore, Michael C.; Smith, Stevens S.; Baker, Timothy B.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIntroduction: Relapse is the most common smoking cessation outcome. Accurate prediction of relapse likelihood could be an important clinical tool used to influence treatment selection or duration. The aim of this research was to develop a brief clinical relapse proneness questionnaire to be used with smokers interested in quitting in a clinical setting where time is at a premium. Methods: Diverse items assessing constructs shown in previous research to be related to relapse risk, such as nicotine dependence and self-efficacy, were evaluated to determine their independent contributions to relapse prediction. In an exploratory dataset, candidate items were assessed among smokers motivated to quit smoking who enrolled in one of three randomized controlled smoking cessation trials. A cross-validation dataset was used to compare the relative predictive power of the new instrument against the FagerstrÃ¶m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) at 1-week, 8-week, and 6-month postquit assessments. Results: We selected seven items with relatively nonoverlapping content for the Wisconsin Predicting Patient's Relapse (WI-PREPARE) measure, a brief, seven-item questionnaire that taps physical dependence, environmental factors, and individual difference characteristics. Cross-validation analyses suggested that the WI-PREPARE demonstrated a stronger prediction of relapse at 1-week and 8-week postquit assessments than the FTND and comparable prediction to the FTND at a 6-month postquit assessment. Discussion: The WI-PREPARE is easy to score, suggests the nature of a patient's relapse risk, and predicts short- and medium-term relapse better than the FTND.

However, for a variable percentage of treated patients, it remains only partially effective. In this study, we reported the post-marketing experience of the efficacy of IFNbeta therapy for a large cohort of MS patients regularly attending the MS Outpatient Clinic of \"La Sapienza University\" in Rome. In this cohort we also sought clinical and paraclinical variables responsible for the clinical course of MS during IFNbeta therapy. Patients that received treatment with one of the IFNbeta formulations for at least 1 year were included. Clinical outcomes (i. e., relapses and disability score) were monitored throughout the entire study period. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed twice for each subject: at baseline and after 1 year of therapy. The occurrence of more than one relapse during the study period or a sustained disability progression in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score were considered as criteria for the definition of suboptimal clinical response to IFNbeta therapy. During IFNbeta therapy (number of patients 242, mean length of treatment 4.3+/-2.3 years) a reduction in the annualised relapse rate of 59% (p<0.001) was observed. Eighty-six patients (35%) fulfilled the criterion for defining \"suboptimal responder\" on the basis of relapses, and 69 (28.5%) did the same on the basis of EDSS sustained progression. Twenty-seven (11.1%) patients showed both an EDSS progression and two or more relapses. The presence of T1-enhancing lesions and new T2 hyperintense lesions on the scan performed after the first year of therapy were the best MRI features associated with both the occurrence of relapses during the treatment period (OR for enhancing lesions and relapses 3.6; OR for new T2 lesion and relapses 2.8). The present post-marketing experience\n\nPrevalence and Serological Diagnosis of Relapse in Paracoccidioidomycosis Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSylvestre, Tatiane Fernanda; Silva, Luciane Regina Franciscone; Cavalcante, Ricardo de Souza; Moris, Daniela Vanessa; Venturini, James; Vicentini, Adriana Pardini; de Carvalho, LÃ­dia Raquel; Mendes, Rinaldo Poncio\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA review of 400 clinical records of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) patients, 93 with the acute/subacute (AF) and 307 with the chronic form (CF), attended from 1977 to 2011, selected as to the schedule of release for study by the Office of Medical Records at the University Hospital of the Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu â SÃ£o Paulo State University â UNESP, was performed to detect cases in relapse. The control of cure was performed by clinical and serological evaluation using the double agar gel immunodiffusion test (DID). In the diagnosis of relapse, DID, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting assay (IBgp70 and IBgp43) were evaluated. Out of 400 patients, 21 (5.2%) went through relapse, 18 of them were male and 3 were female, 6â¶1 male/female ratio. Out of the 21 patients in relapse, 15 (4.8%) showed the CF, and 6 (6.4%) the AF (p>0.05). The sensitivity of DID and ELISA before treatment was the same (76.1%). DID presented higher sensitivity in pre-treatment (80%) than at relapse (45%; pâ=â0.017), while ELISA showed the same sensitivity (80% vs 65%; pâ=â0.125). The serological methods for identifying PCM patients in relapse showed low rates of sensitivity, from 12.5% in IBgp70 to 65.0% in IBgp43 identification and 68.8% in ELISA. The sensitivity of ELISA in diagnosing PCM relapse showed a strong tendency to be higher than DID (pâ=â0.06) and is equal to IBgp43 (pâ=â0.11). In sum, prevalence of relapse was not high in PCM patients whose treatment duration was based on immunological parameters. However, the used methods for serological diagnosis present low sensitivity. While more accurate serological methods are not available, we pay special attention to the mycological and histopathological diagnosis of PCM relapse. Hence, direct mycological, cytopathological, and histopathological examinations and isolation in culture for P. brasiliensis must be appropriately and routinely performed when the hypothesis of relapse is\n\n[Relapse in schizophrenia: an exploratory study of the joint conceptions of patients, parents and caregivers].\n\nPubMed\n\nKoenig, M; Castillo, M-C; Urdapilleta, I; Le Borgne, P; Bouleau, J-H\n\n2011-06-01\n\nschizophrenic child or who did not see or have frequent contact with him or her for this study. We conducted a semistructured interview and analysed the transcripts of the narratives provided by our three groups on the definition of relapse and early signs of relapse. Recorded interviews were processed using the Alceste Method, a computer program of textual analysis that identifies the word patterns most frequently used by the subjects. Alceste creates classes of words using a hierarchical descending classification. The description of each class is presented in the form of a word list (with the value of the word's Chi(2) association in this class). We assessed the awareness of problems using the 8-Q. The three groups described relapses as a distressed, even traumatic experience. This experience is shared by the patients' siblings who sometimes mention violent situations and difficulties at home. The analysis showed that each group uses a compartmentalized universe of speech. This raises the question of the communication and the sharing of information between the different groups. Parents who didn't live the relapse of their children and the caregivers gave prepsychotic or psychotic symptoms of relapse. Conversely, parents who had lived relapse(s) of their children gave nonspecific and very personalized signs of relapse (e.g., \"When she relapses, our daughter eats much more cheese than usually\"). The patients with a low level of awareness of his/her problem were able to describe early signs of relapse. They described mood and sleep disturbances. This is an unexpected result and calls for a debate on the need or not to have good insight in order to follow a psychoeducation program. This study insists on the complementarity of different conceptions of all persons involved in schizophrenic relapse in order to identify as accurately as possible the \"relapse signature\" of patients. According to us, and in order to promote suitable subjective data to increase insight, compliance and\n\nA phase 2 trial of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and relapsed/refractory myeloma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXie, Wanling; Jagannath, Sundar; Jakubowiak, Andrzej; Lonial, Sagar; Raje, Noopur S.; Alsina, Melissa; Ghobrial, Irene M.; Schlossman, Robert L.; Munshi, Nikhil C.; Mazumder, Amitabha; Vesole, David H.; Kaufman, Jonathan L.; Colson, Kathleen; McKenney, Mary; Lunde, Laura E.; Feather, John; Maglio, Michelle E.; Warren, Diane; Francis, Dixil; Hideshima, Teru; Knight, Robert; Esseltine, Dixie-Lee; Mitsiades, Constantine S.; Weller, Edie; Anderson, Kenneth C.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this prospective, multicenter, phase 2 study, 64 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) received up to 8 21-day cycles of bortezomib 1.0 mg/m2 (days 1, 4, 8, and 11), lenalidomide 15 mg/day (days 1-14), and dexamethasone 40/20 mg/day (cycles 1-4) and 20/10 mg/day (cycles 5-8) (days of/after bortezomib dosing). Responding patients could receive maintenance therapy. Median age was 65 years; 66% were male, 58% had relapsed and 42% had relapsed and refractory MM, and 53%, 75%, and 6% had received prior bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide, respectively. Forty-eight of 64 patients (75%; 90% confidence interval, 65-84) were alive without progressive disease at 6 months (primary end point). The rate of partial response or better was 64%; median duration of response was 8.7 months. Median progression-free and overall survivals were 9.5 and 30 months, respectively (median follow-up: 44 months). Common treatment-related toxicities included sensory neuropathy (53%), fatigue (50%), and neutropenia (42%); common grade 3/4 treatment-related toxicities included neutropenia (30%), thrombocytopenia (22%), and lymphopenia (11%). Grade 3 motor neuropathy was reported in 2 patients. Lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone appears effective and tolerable in patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory MM, demonstrating substantial activity among patients with diverse prior therapies and adverse prognostic characteristics.

Despite recent advances in the characterization of pathogenesis of AML, the cure rates are under 40%, being leukemia relapse the most common cause of treatment failure. Leukaemia relapse occurs due to clonal evolution or clonal escape. In this study, we aimed to analyze the clinical and biological factors influencing outcomes in patients with AML relapse. We included a total of 75 AML patients who experienced leukaemia relapse after achieving complete remission. We performed complete immunophenotyping and conventional karyotyping in bone marrow aspirates obtained at diagnosis and at leukemia relapse. Overall survival (OS) of the series was 3.7%Â±2.3, leukaemia progression being the most common cause of death. Patients relapsing before 12 months and those with adverse cytogenetic-molecular risk had statistically significant worse outcomes. A percentage of 52.5 of patients showed phenotypic changes and 50% cytogenetic changes at relapse. We did not find significant clinical factors predicting clonal evolution. The presence of clonal evolution at relapse did not have a significant impact on outcome. Patients with relapsed AML have a dismal prognosis, especially those with early relapse and adverse cytogenetic-molecular risk. Clonal evolution with phenotypic and cytogenetic changes occurred in half of the patients without predictive clinical factors or impact on outcome. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

Therefore, additional treatment is required to achieve better control of symptoms. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of pneumatic balloon dilation (PBD) in patients with symptom relapse after Heller myotomy. METHODS Thirty six post-myotomy patients were evaluated from 1993 to 2013. Six patients were excluded from the analysis because of comorbid diseases or epiphrenic diverticula. Thirty patients were treated with PBD. Primary outcome was defined as a decrease in symptom score to 4 or less and a reduction greater than 80% from the baseline in the volume of barium in timed barium esophagogram in 6 weeks. Achalasia symptom score (ASS) was assessed at 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then every six months in all patients and PBD was repeated in case of symptom relapse (ASS>4). RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 45.5Â±13.9 years (range: 21-73). Primary outcome was observed in 25 patients (83%). The mean ASS of the patients dropped from 7.8 before treatment to 1.3Â±2.0 at 1.5 months after treatment (p=0.0001). The mean volume and height of barium decreased from 43.1Â±33.4 and 7.1Â±4.7 to 6.0Â±17.1 and 1.1Â±2.2, respectively (p=0.003, p=0.003). The mean duration of follow-up was 11.8Â±6.3 years. At the end of the study, 21 patients (70%) reported sustained good response. No major complications such as perforation or gross bleeding were seen. CONCLUSION PBD is an effective and safe treatment option for achalasia in patients with symptom relapse after Heller myotomy.\n\n[Study on the social factors of patients with genital herpes relapsing].\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Ji-Feng; Xu, Ai-E; Li, Yong-Wei; Zhang, Di-Min\n\n2006-05-01\n\nTo investigate the social factors of patients with genital herpes (GH) relapsing and guide GH patients to avoid the related social factors. To select 96 case of patients with recurrent genital herpes of final diagnosis and detailedly record the related social factors before relapsing. The social factors were compared between male and female GH patients, and compared between frequently recurrent (> 6/year) and non-frequently recurrent GH patients (< or = 6/year) too. 65.6% (63/96) of recurrent GH patients have certain social factors before relapsing. The main social factors are overtiredness, mental stress and excessive sexual contact. Staying up late and excessive drinking are common social factors, too. There was no significant difference of social factors between male and female GH patients (P >. 05), and also no significant difference between frequently recurrent and non-frequently recurrent GH patients (P > 0.05), too. Overtiredness, mental stress and excessive sexual are the main social elements during inducing genital herpes relapsing. It is important to reduce GH relapsing and spreading of HIV and syphilis by guiding recurrent genital herpes patients to avoid related social elements.\n\nVaccines and the association with relapses in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nMealy, Maureen A; Cook, Lawrence J; Pache, Florence; Velez, Diego L; Borisow, Nadja; Becker, Daniel; Arango, Jorge A Jimenez; Paul, Friedemann; Levy, Michael\n\n2018-05-07\n\nIt is unknown if vaccines cause non-specific immune activation in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and no consensus on the use of vaccines exists for this population. We investigated the temporal association of vaccinations with relapses in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. This is a multi-center retrospective analysis of patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder for whom immunization history and clinical records from disease onset were available. Ninety patients who met 2015 diagnostic criteria received a total of 211 vaccinations and experienced 340 relapses over a median disease course of 6.6 years. The likelihood of a relapse occurring within 30, 60, and 90 days of a vaccine was compared to the likelihood of a relapse occurring within each time point of a randomly generated date. We also compared the relapse rate between patients who received any vaccination(s) after disease onset to those who did not. We identified seven patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder who relapsed within 30 days of a vaccination, six between 31 and 60 days, and four who relapsed between 61 and 90 days. The rate of vaccine-associated relapses within 30, 60, and 90 days was significantly higher than the likelihood of a relapse spontaneously occurring within each of the given time frames (pâ¯=â¯0.034, 0.01, 0.016, respectively) among patients who were not on preventive immunotherapy only. Among those who were on immunotherapy to prevent relapses, there was no significant association of relapse with vaccines. Additionally, among patients on immunotherapy, the annualized relapse rate of those who received routine vaccinations was significantly lower than in unvaccinated patients. The evidence suggests that there may be a risk of vaccination-associated relapses among untreated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder patients, however immunosuppressive therapy at time of vaccine may abort the risk; this suggests that the\n\nImpulsive suicide attempts predict post-treatment relapse in alcohol-dependent patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nWojnar, Marcin; Ilgen, Mark A; Jakubczyk, Andrzej; Wnorowska, Anna; Klimkiewicz, Anna; Brower, Kirk J\n\n2008-10-01\n\nThe present study was designed to examine the influence of suicidality on relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. Specifically, a lifetime suicide attempt at baseline was used to predict relapse in the year after treatment. Also, the unique contribution of impulsive suicide attempts was examined. A total of 154 patients with alcohol dependence, consecutively admitted to four addiction treatment facilities in Warsaw, Poland participated in the study. Of the 154 eligible patients, 118 (76.6%) completed a standardized follow-up assessment at 12 months. Previous suicide attempts were common in adults treated for alcohol dependence with 43% patients in the present sample reporting an attempt at some point during their lifetime. Additionally, more than 62% of those with a lifetime suicide attempt reported making an impulsive attempt. Lifetime suicide attempts were not associated with post-treatment relapse (chi-square=2.37, d.f.=1, p=0.124). However, impulsive suicide attempts strongly predicted relapse (OR=2.81, 95% CI=1.13-6.95, p=0.026) and time to relapse (OR=2.10, 95% CI=1.18-3.74, p=0.012) even after adjusting for other measures of baseline psychopathology, depression, impulsivity, hopelessness and alcohol use severity. This study is the first to document the relationship between pre-treatment impulsive suicide attempts and higher likelihood of post-treatment relapse in alcohol-dependent patents. Clinicians should routinely conduct an assessment for previous suicide attempts in patients with alcohol use disorders, and when impulsive suicidality is reported, they should recognize the increased risk for relapse and formulate their patients' treatment plans accordingly with the goals of reducing both alcoholic relapse and suicide rates.\n\nVincristine and irinotecan in children with relapsed hepatoblastoma: a single-institution experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yu-tong; Feng, Li-hua; Zhong, Xiao-dan; Wang, Li-zhe; Chang, Jian\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThis study was to determine the efficacy of vincristine and irinotecan in children with relapsed hepatoblastoma (HB). A total of 10 patients with relapsed HB were enrolled. Three patients were excluded. Patients received irinotecan 50 mg/m(2)/day, day 1-5 and vincristine 1.5 mg/m(2)/day, day 1, repeated every 3 weeks. The maximum cycles were eight. Reevaluation of tumor was performed every two cycles. The primary outcome was the rate of complete resection. Secondary outcomes were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Of the seven patients assessable for response, one patient with normal AFP level showed a progressive disease and withdrew. He finally died 6 months later. Four had PR, all of them underwent a second surgery and achieved complete resection. Two patients had SD, one patient relapsed 6 months after orthotopic liver transplantation and died, the other one undergoing surgery had micro margin positive, he relapsed again but alive. The rate of complete resection was 71.4% (including orthotopic liver transplantation). The 2-year EFS and OS for the whole group were 57.1% (95% CI, 12.7% to 34.2%) and 71.4% (95% CI, 16.39% to 37.4%), respectively. The combination of irinotecan and vincristine has a significant antitumor activity and acceptable toxicity in children with relapsed HB.\n\nRelapse following antithyroid drug therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaurberg, Peter; Krejbjerg, Anne; Andersen, Stine Linding\n\n2014-10-01\n\nIn most patients with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease, antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is followed by a gradual amelioration of the autoimmune abnormality, but about half of the patients will experience relapse of hyperthyroidism when the ATDs are withdrawn after a standard 1 to 2 years of therapy. This is a major drawback of ATD therapy, and a major concern to patients. We review current knowledge on how to predict and possibly reduce the risk of such relapse. Several patient and disease characteristics, as well as environmental factors and duration of ATD therapy, may influence the risk of relapse after ATD withdrawal. Depending on the presence of such factors, the risk of relapse after ATD withdrawal may vary from around 10 to 90%. Risk factors for relapse should be taken into account when choosing between therapeutic modalities in a patient with newly diagnosed disease, and also when discussing duration of ATD therapy. Prolonged low-dose ATD therapy may be feasible in patients with high risk of relapse, such as children and patients with active Graves' orbitopathy, and in patients with previous relapse who prefer such therapy rather than surgery or radioiodine.\n\nEffect of brain structure, brain function, and brain connectivity on relapse in alcohol-dependent patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeck, Anne; WÃ¼stenberg, Torsten; Genauck, Alexander; Wrase, Jana; Schlagenhauf, Florian; Smolka, Michael N; Mann, Karl; Heinz, Andreas\n\n2012-08-01\n\nIn alcohol-dependent patients, brain atrophy and functional brain activation elicited by alcohol-associated stimuli may predict relapse. However, to date, the interaction between both factors has not been studied. To determine whether results from structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging are associated with relapse in detoxified alcohol-dependent patients. A cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance experiment with alcohol-associated and neutral stimuli. After a follow-up period of 3 months, the group of 46 detoxified alcohol-dependent patients was subdivided into 16 abstainers and 30 relapsers. Faculty for Clinical Medicine Mannheim at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. A total of 46 detoxified alcohol-dependent patients and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects Local gray matter volume, local stimulus-related functional magnetic resonance imaging activation, joint analyses of structural and functional data with Biological Parametric Mapping, and connectivity analyses adopting the psychophysiological interaction approach. Subsequent relapsers showed pronounced atrophy in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and in the right medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, compared with healthy controls and patients who remained abstinent. The local gray matter volume-corrected brain response elicited by alcohol-associated vs neutral stimuli in the left medial prefrontal cortex was enhanced for subsequent relapsers, whereas abstainers displayed an increased neural response in the midbrain (the ventral tegmental area extending into the subthalamic nucleus) and ventral striatum. For alcohol-associated vs neutral stimuli in abstainers compared with relapsers, the analyses of the psychophysiological interaction showed a stronger functional connectivity between the midbrain and the left amygdala and between the midbrain and the left orbitofrontal cortex. Subsequent relapsers displayed increased brain atrophy in brain areas associated with\n\nRegional homogeneity changes between heroin relapse and non-relapse patients under methadone maintenance treatment: a resting-state fMRI study.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Haifeng; Li, Wei; Li, Qiang; Chen, Jiajie; Zhu, Jia; Ye, Jianjun; Liu, Jierong; Li, Zhe; Li, Yongbin; Shi, Ming; Wang, Yarong; Wang, Wei\n\n2016-08-18\n\nMethadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is recognized as one of the most effective treatments for heroin addiction but its effect is dimmed by the high incidence of heroin relapse. However, underlying neurobiology mechanism of heroin relapse under MMT is still largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of a resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo), and tried to explore the difference of brain function between heroin relapsers and non-relapsers in MMT. Forty MMT patients were included and received a 12-month follow-up. All patients were given baseline resting-state fMRI scans by using a 3.0Â T GE Signa Excite HD whole-body MRI system. Monthly self-report and urine test were used to assess heroin relapse or non-relapse. Subjective craving was measured with visual analog scale. The correlation between ReHo and the degree of heroin relapse was analyzed. Compared with the non-relapsers, ReHo values were increased in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, right caudate, and right cerebellum of the heroin relapsers while those in the left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and precuneus were decreased in heroin relapsers. Importantly, altered ReHo in the right caudate were positively correlated with heroin relapse rates or subjective craving response. Using the resting-state fMRI technique by analysis of ReHo, we provided the first resting-state fMRI evidence that right caudate may serve as a potential biomarker for heroin relapse prediction and also as a promising target for reducing relapse risk.\n\nImpact of Life Events on the Relapse of Schizophrenic Patients\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHussein, Hassan Ali; Jacoob, Shirooq; Sharour, Loai Abu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives: To investigate the relationship between stressful life events at the time of relapse in schizophrenic patients at psychiatric hospitals in Baghdad city.

A follow up study was conducted with 237 patients who were cured after receiving treatment in rural medical facilities from the State of Chiapas. The global incidence of relapse was 1.04 cases per 100 month/person. The risk factors for relapse were lack of knowledge about treatment (OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.06-4.89); drug adverse effects (OR = 2.78; 95% CI = 1.31-5.90), waiting time for more than 15 minutes to receive medical care (OR = 3.07; 95% CI = 1.06-12.94) and lack of medical supervision (OR = 4.77; 95% CI = 1.30-17.41). Most of the risk factors for relapse are susceptible to modification and are related with the quality of medical care provided to lung tuberculosis patients.\n\nAccelerated Total Lymphoid Irradiation-containing Salvage Regimen for Patients With Refractory and Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma: 20Â Years of Experience\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRimner, Andreas; Lovie, Shona; Hsu, Meier\n\nPurpose: We report the long-term results of integrated accelerated involved field radiation therapy (IFRT) followed by total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) as part of the high-dose salvage regimen followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation or autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Methods and Materials: From November 1985 to July 2008, 186 previously unirradiated patients with relapsed or refractory HL underwent salvage therapy on 4 consecutive institutional review boardâapproved protocols. All patients had biopsy-proven primary refractory or relapsed HL. After standard-dose salvage chemotherapy (SC), accelerated IFRT (18-20Â Gy) was given to relapsed or refractory sites, followedmoreÂ Â» by TLI (15-18Â Gy) and high-dose chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were analyzed by Cox analysis and disease-specific survival (DSS) by competing-risk regression. Results: With a median follow-up period of 57Â months among survivors, 5- and 10-year OS rates were 68% and 56%, respectively; 5- and 10-year EFS rates were 62% and 56%, respectively; and 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences of HL-related deaths were 21% and 29%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, complete response to SC was independently associated with improved OS and EFS. Primary refractory disease and extranodal disease were independently associated with poor DSS. Eight patients had grade 3 or higher cardiac toxicity, with 3 deaths. Second malignancies developed in 10 patients, 5 of whom died. Conclusions: Accelerated IFRT followed by TLI and high-dose chemotherapy is an effective, feasible, and safe salvage strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory HL with excellent long-term OS, EFS, and DSS. Complete response to SC is the most important prognostic factor.Â«Â less\n\n[Clinical and microbiological profile of patients experiencing relapses of tuberculosis in Tunisia].\n\nPubMed\n\nMjid, M; Hedhli, A; Zakhma, M; Zribi, M; Ouahchi, Y; Toujani, S; Cherif, J\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRelapse of tuberculosis (TB) is known to be as one of the major risk factors for resistant TB. The aim of this study is to focus on clinical, radiological and bacteriological features of patients with pulmonary TB relapse. We performed a retrospective survey in the respiratory department of the teaching hospital La Rabta in Tunis between January 2000 and December 2014. Data of patients with a pulmonary TB relapse were analyzed. During the study period, among 1250 patients hospitalized for pulmonary TB, 44 had a TB relapse. The TB relapse rate was estimated to be at 3.5%. The average age was 43.95Â±16.7 years. Sex ratio was 5,2. Eighty one percent of patients were current smokers. Alcoholism was found in 40.9% of cases. The mean time to relapse was 6.37Â±3.7 years. The radiological lesions were moderately extended at least in 54.6% of cases. A resistant TB was found in 33% of cases (mono-resistance: 33.3%, multi-drug resistance (TB-MR): 11,1%, poly-resistance: 55.5%). The most incriminated drugs were isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. One patient received TB-MR treatment regimen for 18 months. In the other cases, the duration of treatment was prolonged. Recovery was obtained in 72.7% of cases, two patients died and 22.7% of patients were lost to follow up. In Tunisia, TB relapse usually affects young male patients who are often alcoholic and smokers. Resistant TB is frequent among these patients. These findings lead us to emphasize the need of rapid diagnosis tools and adapted treatment regimen in these patients. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In phase 3 clinical trials (Natalizumab Safety and Efficacy in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis [AFFIRM] and Safety and Efficacy of Natalizumab in Combination With Interferon Beta-1a in Patients With Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis [SENTINEL]), natalizumab use significantly improved clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes over 2 years in patients with relapsing MS. Because patients of African descent may be less responsive to interferon beta treatment than patients of white race/ethnicity, the efficacy of natalizumab therapy in this population is clinically important. To evaluate the efficacy of natalizumab use in patients of African descent with relapsing MS. Post hoc analysis. Academic research. Patients of African descent with relapsing MS who received natalizumab or placebo in the phase 3 AFFIRM study and those who received natalizumab plus intramuscular interferon beta-1a or placebo plus intramuscular interferon beta-1a in the phase 3 SENTINEL study. Efficacy of natalizumab use in patients of African descent with relapsing MS who participated in the AFFIRM or SENTINEL trial. Forty-nine patients of African descent participated in AFFIRM (n = 10) or SENTINEL (n = 39). Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between patients treated with natalizumab (n = 21) or placebo (n = 28). Natalizumab therapy significantly reduced the annualized MS relapse rate by 60% (0.21 vs 0.53 in the placebo group, P = .02). Compared with placebo use, natalizumab therapy also significantly reduced the accumulation of lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging over 2 years: the mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions was reduced by 79% (0.19 vs 0.91, P = .03), and the mean number of new or enlarged T2-weighted lesions was reduced by 90% (0.88 vs 8.52, P = .008).

EWS patients enrolled in ISG/SSG III and IV trials who relapsed after complete remission were included in the analysis. At recurrence, chemotherapy based on high-dose ifosfamide was foreseen, and patients who responded but had not received HDT underwent consolidation therapy with HDT. Data from 107 EWS patients were included in the analysis. Median time to recurrence (RFI) was 18 months, and 45 (42%) patients had multiple sites of recurrence. Patients who had previously been treated with HDT had a significantly (Pâ=â0.02) shorter RFI and were less likely to achieve a second complete remission (CR2). CR2 status was achieved by 42 (39%) patients. Fifty patients received high-dose IFO (20 went to consolidation HDT). The 5-year PRS was 19% (95% CI 11 to 27%). With CR2, the 5-year PRS was 48% (95% CI 31 to 64%). Without CR2, median time to death was six months (range 1-45 months). According to the multivariate analysis, patients younger than 15 years, recurrence to the lung only, and RFI longer than 24 months significantly influenced the probability of PRS. Age, pattern of recurrence, RFI, and response to second-line chemotherapy influence post-relapse survival in patients with recurrent Ewing sarcoma. No survival advantage was observed from chemotherapy consolidation with HDT.

To identify immunologic predictors (anti-desmoglein [Dsg] 1 and 3 antibodies; direct immunofluorescence [DIF]) for relapse in PV patients. Eighty-nine patients in complete clinical remission for at least 6 months and receiving less than or equal to 10 mg prednisolone daily and no immunosuppressive drugs were evaluated using DIF (n=89) and Dsg ELISA (n=46). They were followed until relapse or for at least 18 months. DIF was positive in 44 of 89 patients (49.5%); anti-Dsg 3 antibodies were detected in 18 of 46 patients (39.1%) and anti-Dsg 1 antibodies were detected in 4 of 46 patients (8.7%). Relapse occurred in 38 patients (42.7%). Mean relapse-free time was significantly shorter in anti-Dsg 3-positive patients compared to anti-Dsg 3- negative patients (P = .015) and in DIF-positive patients compared to DIF-negative patients (P = .047), but not in anti-Dsg 1- positive patients compared to anti-Dsg 1-negative patients (P = .501). Sensitivity and predictive values of neither of these tests were high. Small number of anti-Dsg 1-positive patients and use of conventional ELISA. Positive anti-Dsg 3 ELISA and, to a lesser degree, positive DIF are predictors of relapse in PV patients in clinical remission. Decision on discontinuing treatment should be based on the results of these tests as well as on clinical findings. Copyright Â© 2015 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we report the experience of the German Hodgkin Study Group with brentuximab vedotin as single agent in 45 patients with refractory or relapsed CD30(+) Hodgkin lymphoma who were treated either in a named patient program (n = 34) or in the context of a safety study associated with the registration program of this drug. In these very heavily pretreated patients, an objective response rate of 60%, including 22% complete remissions, could be documented. The median duration of response was 8 months. This retrospective analysis supports the previously reported excellent therapeutic efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in heavily pretreated CD30(+) malignancies.\n\nExtramedullary Relapse Following Total Marrow and Lymphoid Irradiation in Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKim, Ji Hyun; Stein, Anthony; Tsai, Nicole\n\nPurpose: Approximately 5% to 20% of patients who undergo total body irradiation (TBI) in preparation for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can develop extramedullary (EM) relapse. Whereas total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) provides a more conformally targeted radiation therapy for patients, organ sparing has the potential to place the patient at a higher risk for EM relapse than TBI. This study evaluated EM relapse in patients treated with TMLI at our institution. Methods and Materials: Patients eligible for analysis had been enrolled in 1 of 3 prospective TMLI trials between 2006 and 2012. The TMLI targeted bones, major lymph nodemoreÂ Â» chains, liver, spleen, testes, and brain, using image-guided tomotherapy with total dose ranging from 12 to 15 Gy. Results: A total of 101 patients with a median age of 47 years were studied. The median follow-up was 12.8 months. Incidence of EM relapse and bone marrow (BM) relapse were 12.9% and 25.7%, respectively. Of the 13 patients who had EM relapse, 4 also had BM relapse, and 7 had EM disease prior to HCT. There were a total of 19 EM relapse sites as the site of initial recurrence: 11 soft tissue, 6 lymph node, 2 skin. Nine of these sites were within the target region and received â¥12 Gy. Ten initial EM relapse sites were outside of the target region: 5 sites received 10.1 to 11.4 Gy while 5 sites received <10 Gy. Pretransplantation EM was the only significant predictor of subsequent EM relapse. The cumulative incidence of EM relapse was 4% at 1 year and 11.4% at 2 years. Conclusions: EM relapse incidence was as frequent in regions receiving â¥10 Gy as those receiving <10 Gy. EM relapse rates following TMLI that included HCT regimens were comparable to published results with regimens including TBI and suggest that TMLI is not associated with an increased EM relapse risk.Â«Â less\n\nThe risk of central nervous system relapses in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFanale, Michelle A.; Miranda, Roberto N.; Noorani, Mansoor; Westin, Jason R.; Nastoupil, Loretta J.; Hagemeister, Fredrick B.; Fayad, Luis E.; Romaguera, Jorge E.; Samaniego, Felipe; Turturro, Francesco; Lee, Hun J.; Neelapu, Sattva S.; Rodriguez, M. Alma; Wang, Michael; Fowler, Nathan H.; Davis, Richard E.; Medeiros, L. Jeffrey; Oki, Yasuhiro\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe performed a retrospective analysis to identify risk factors and survival outcome for central nervous system (CNS) relapse of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) by histologic type. Records of 600 PTCL patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2014 were analyzed including PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS, 174 patients), angoimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL, 144), ALK+anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, 74), ALK-ALCL (103), extranodal NK-cell lymphoma (ENKL, 54), or others (51). With a median follow up of 57 months, 13 patients (4 PTCL-NOS, 1 AITL, 4 ALK+ALCL, 2 ALK-ALCL, 2 ENKL) experienced CNS relapse. One-year and 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse were 1.5% (95%CI: 0.7â2.8%) and 2.1% (95%CI: 1.1â3.5%), respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 1.8% in PTCL-NOS, 0.7% in AITL, 5.4% in ALK+ALCL, 2.1% in ALK-ALCL and 3.7% in ENKL. Extranodal involvement >1 site was the only significant factor associated with higher chance of CNS relapse (HR: 4.9, 95%CI: 1.6â15.0, p = 0.005). Patients with ALK+ALCL who had extranodal involvement >1 (N = 19) had very high risk of CNS relapse with one year cumulative incidence of 17% (95%CI: 4%-37%), all occurring within six months after diagnosis. All patients with CNS relapse eventually died (median, 1.5 months; range, 0.1â10.1 months). CNS relapse in patients with PTCL is rare event but the risk varies by subtype. ALK+ALCL patients with extranodal involvement >1 site have a very high risk of early CNS relapse, and thus evaluation of CNS involvement at the time of diagnosis and possible CNS-directed prophylaxis may be considered.

Methods and Materials: All patients with residual disease of â¥2.5Â cm after multiagent chemotherapy (CTX) were evaluated using additional positron emission tomography (PET), and those with a PET-positive result were irradiated with 30Â Gy to the site of residual disease. We re-evaluatedmoreÂ Â» all sites of disease before and after CTX, as well as the PET-positive residual tumor that was treated in all relapsed patients. Documentation of radiation therapy (RT), treatment planning procedures, and portal images were carefully analyzed and compared with the centrally recommended RTÂ prescription. The irradiated sites were compared with sites of relapse using follow-up computed tomography scans. Results: A total of 2126 patients were enrolled, and 225 patients (11%) received RT. Radiation therapy documents of 152 irradiated patients (68%) were analyzed, with 28 irradiated patients (11%) relapsing subsequently. Eleven patients (39%) had an in-field relapse, 7 patients (25%) relapsed outside the irradiated volume, and an additional 10 patients (36%) showed mixed in- and out-field relapses. Of 123 patients, 20 (16%) with adequately performed RT relapsed, compared with 7 of 29 patients (24%) with inadequate RT. Conclusions: The frequency and pattern of relapses suggest that local RT to PET-positive residual disease is sufficient for patients in advanced-stage HL. Insufficient safety margins of local RT may contribute to in-field relapses.Â«Â less\n\nRisk of seizure relapse after antiepileptic drug withdrawal in adult patients with focal epilepsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Ru-Qian; Zeng, Qing-Yi; Zhu, Pan; Bao, Yi-Xin; Zheng, Rong-Yuan; Xu, Hui-Qin\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to estimate the risk of a seizure relapse and the high-risk period of recurrence after antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal and to determine the predictive factors for a seizure relapse in adult patients with focal epilepsy who were seizure-free for more than 2years. Using the Wenzhou Epilepsy Follow-Up Registry Database, 200 adult patients with focal epilepsy were recruited, who were undergoing follow-up, met the inclusion criteria of this study, were seizure-free for more than 2years, began withdrawing between June 2003 and June 2014, and were followed up prospectively for at least 1year or until a seizure relapse. The risk of recurrence and the time to seizure relapse were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the predictive factors were identified by the Cox proportional hazard regression model. A total of 99 patients had an unprovoked relapse during the follow-up period. The relapse rate was 49.5%, and each year, the recurrence probability of 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84months after AED withdrawal was 24.0%, 20.4%, 8.3%, 2.7%, 4.6%, 0.97%, and 0.98%, respectively. The two independent risk factors for recurrence after withdrawal in adult patients with focal epilepsy were a longer duration of active epilepsy and a shorter seizure-free period before withdrawal. The high-risk period of a seizure relapse in adult patients with focal epilepsy is the first 2years after withdrawal, and beyond 5years after withdrawal, seizures rarely relapse (relapse rate<1%). A seizure-free period for less than 4years before withdrawal is a predictive factor of risk for seizure recurrence after AED withdrawal in adult patients with focal epilepsy.

Durable responses and remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory disease may be achieved in approximately one-half with salvage chemotherapy followed by high dose chemotherapy (HDT) and autologous hematopoietic cell rescue (SCT). On the other hand, patients who relapse after HDT and autologous SCT or those who have failed at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens and are not candidates for HDT have limited treatment options. Conclusions A new treatment option in this population is an immunotoxin Brentuximab vedotin composed of a CD30 directed antibody linked to the antitubulin agent monomethyl auristatin E. It has demonstrated a substantial effectiveness and an acceptable toxicity. In the pivotal study, the overall response rate was 75% with 34% of complete remissions. The median durations of response were 20.5 and 6.7 months for those with complete remission and all responding patients, respectively. The median overall survival was 40.5 months (3-years overall survival 54%) and the median progression-free survival 9.3 months. The most common non-hematologic toxicities were peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue while the most common severe side effects were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.

Informed by relevant literature and a series of preliminary studies, an educational tool (DVD) was developed to target the unique smoking relapse risk factors among cancer patients. Learner verification interviews were conducted with 10 cancer patients who recently quit smoking to elicit feedback and inform the development of the DVD. The DVD was then refined using iterative processes and feedback from the learner verification interviews. Major changes focused on visual appeal, and the inclusion of additional testimonials and graphics to increase comprehension of key points and further emphasize the message that the patient is in control of their ability to maintain their smoking abstinence. Together, these steps resulted in the creation of a DVD titled Surviving SmokefreeÂ®, which represents the first smoking relapse-prevention intervention for cancer patients. If found effective, the Surviving SmokefreeÂ® DVD is an easily disseminable and low-cost portable intervention which can assist cancer patients in maintaining smoking abstinence.\n\nSequence analysis of human rhinovirus aspirated from the nasopharynx of patients with relapsing-remitting MS.\n\nPubMed\n\nKneider, M; BergstrÃ¶m, T; Gustafsson, C; Nenonen, N; Ahlgren, C; Nilsson, S; Andersen, O\n\n2009-04-01\n\nUpper respiratory infections were reported to trigger multiple sclerosis relapses. A relationship between picornavirus infections and MS relapses was recently reported. To evaluate whether human rhinovirus is associated with multiple sclerosis relapses and whether any particular strain is predominant. Nasopharyngeal fluid was aspirated from 36 multiple sclerosis patients at pre-defined critical time points. Reverse-transcriptase-PCR was performed to detect human rhinovirus-RNA. Positive amplicons were sequenced. We found that rhinovirus RNA was present in 17/40 (43%) of specimens obtained at the onset of a URTI in 19 patients, in 1/21 specimens during convalescence after URTI in 14 patients, in 0/6 specimens obtained in 5 patients on average a week after the onset of an \"at risk\" relapse, occurring within a window in time from one week before to three weeks after an infection, and in 0/17 specimens obtained after the onset of a \"not at risk\" relapse not associated with any infection in 12 patients. Fifteen specimens from healthy control persons not associated with URTI were negative. The frequency of HRV presence in URTI was similar to that reported for community infections. Eight amplicons from patients represented 5 different HRV strains. We were unable to reproduce previous findings of association between HRV infections and multiple sclerosis relapses. HRV was not present in nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained during \"at risk\" or \"not at risk\" relapses. Sequencing of HRV obtained from patients during URTI did not reveal any strain with predominance in multiple sclerosis.\n\nEarly detection of tumor relapse/regrowth by consecutive minimal residual disease monitoring in high-risk neuroblastoma patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHirase, Satoshi; Saitoh, Atsuro; Hartomo, Tri Budi; Kozaki, Aiko; Yanai, Tomoko; Hasegawa, Daiichiro; Kawasaki, Keiichiro; Kosaka, Yoshiyuki; Matsuo, Masafumi; Yamamoto, Nobuyuki; Mori, Takeshi; Hayakawa, Akira; Iijima, Kazumoto; Nishio, Hisahide; Nishimura, Noriyuki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNeuroblastoma is an aggressive pediatric tumor accounting for ~15% of cancer-associated mortalities in children. Despite the current intensive therapy, >50% of high-risk patients experience tumor relapse or regrowth caused by the activation of minimal residual disease (MRD). Although several MRD detection protocols using various reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) markers have been reported to evaluate the therapeutic response and disease status of neuroblastoma patients, their clinical significance remains elusive. The present study reports two high-risk neuroblastoma patients, whose MRD was consecutively monitored using 11 RT-qPCR markers (CHRNA3, CRMP1, DBH, DCX, DDC, GABRB3, GAP43, ISL1, KIF1A, PHOX2B and TH) during their course of treatment. The two patients initially responded to the induction therapy and reached MRD-negative status. The patients' MRD subsequently became positive with no elevation of their urinary homovanillic acid, urinary vanillylmandelic acid and serum neuron-specific enolase levels at 13 or 19 weeks prior to the clinical diagnosis of tumor relapse or regrowth. The present cases highlight the possibility of consecutive MRD monitoring using 11 markers to enable an early detection of tumor relapse or regrowth in high-risk neuroblastoma patients.

To assess efficacy and safety of fingolimod in multiple sclerosis (MS) in Kuwait. We retrospectively evaluated MS patients using the MS registries in 3 MS clinics. Relapsing remitting MS patients according to revised 2010 McDonald criteria who had been treated with fingolimod for at least 12 months were included. Primary endpoint was proportion of relapse-free patients at last follow-up. Secondary endpoints were mean change in EDSS and proportion of patients with MRI activity (gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 lesions). 76 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean age and mean disease duration were 34.43 and 7.82 years respectively. Mean duration of exposure to fingolimod was 18.50 months. Proportion of relapse-free patients was 77.6% at last follow-up. Mean EDSS score significantly improved (2.93 versus 1.95; p<0.0001) while 17.1% of patients continued to have MRI activity versus 77.6% at baseline (p<0.0001). Four patients stopped fingolimod due to disease breakthrough (n=3) and lymphadenitis (n=1). Fingolimod is safe and effective in reducing clinical and radiological disease activity in relapsing remitting MS patients. Our results are comparable to reported results of phase III studies.

This paper describes the development and psychometric characteristics of the RASP. The RASP and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were administered to patients with schizophrenia (n=166) three separate times. Chart data were collected on a subsample of patients (n=81). Psychometric analyses of RASP included tests of reliability, construct validity, and concurrent validity of items. Factors from RASP were correlated with subscales from PANSS (sensitivity to change and criterion validity [agreement between RASP and evidence of relapse]). Test-retest reliability returned modest to strong agreement at the item level and strong agreement at the questionnaire level. RASP showed good item response curves and internal consistency for the total instrument and within each of the two subscales (Increased Anxiety and Social Isolation). RASP Total Score and subscales showed good concurrent validity when correlated with PANSS Total Score, Positive, Excitement, and Anxiety subscales. RASP correctly predicted relapse in 67% of cases, with good specificity and negative predictive power and acceptable positive predictive power and sensitivity. The reliability and validity data presented support the use of RASP in settings where addition of a brief self-report assessment of relapse risk among patients with schizophrenia may be of benefit. Ease of use and scoring, and the ability to administer without clinical supervision allows for routine administration and assessment of relapse risk.\n\nDecreased Plasma Histidine Level Predicts Risk of Relapse in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis in Remission\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHisamatsu, Tadakazu; Ono, Nobukazu; Imaizumi, Akira; Mori, Maiko; Suzuki, Hiroaki; Uo, Michihide; Hashimoto, Masaki; Naganuma, Makoto; Matsuoka, Katsuyoshi; Mizuno, Shinta; Kitazume, Mina T.; Yajima, Tomoharu; Ogata, Haruhiko; Iwao, Yasushi; Hibi, Toshifumi; Kanai, Takanori\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Patients with UC have repeated remission and relapse. Clinical biomarkers that can predict relapse in UC patients in remission have not been identified. To facilitate the prediction of relapse of UC, we investigated the potential of novel multivariate indexes using statistical modeling of plasma free amino acid (PFAA) concentrations. We measured fasting PFAA concentrations in 369 UC patients in clinical remission, and 355 were observed prospectively for up to 1 year. Relapse rate within 1 year was 23% (82 of 355 patients). The age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio for the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile of plasma histidine concentration was 2.55 (95% confidence interval: 1.41â4.62; p = 0.0020 (log-rank), p for trend = 0.0005). We demonstrated that plasma amino acid profiles in UC patients in clinical remission can predict the risk of relapse within 1 year. Decreased histidine level in PFAAs was associated with increased risk of relapse. Metabolomics could be promising for the establishment of a non-invasive predictive marker in inflammatory bowel disease.

Response rates and time to relapse vary significantly among treated individuals. The objective of this study was to monitor the response of seropositive and seronegative RA patients to rituximab and correlate relapse with B-cell markers in the two groups. Seventeen RA patients (eight seropositive for rheumatoid factor [RF+] and nine seronegative [RF-]) were treated with two cycles of rituximab. After treatment, all patients were re-evaluated at the outpatient clinic, and rituximab was readministered when disease relapse was confirmed by clinical-laboratory measures (Disease Activity Score [DAS]-28). CD20+ cells and CD20 receptor expression levels were estimated at initiation, relapse, and re-evaluation timepoints, and were compared between the two groups. Seropositive patients responded favorably to treatment compared with the seronegative group. The mean time to relapse was 337.5 +/- 127.0 days for the RF+ patients versus 233.3 +/- 59.6 days for the RF- patients (p = 0.043), despite more aggressive concomitant treatment in the seronegative group. The DAS28 decrease 3 months after treatment was 1.695 +/- 1.076 in seropositive patients versus 0.94 +/- 1.62 in seronegative patients. At relapse, CD20 receptor expression (molecules/cell) was higher in RF+ patients than in their RF- counterparts, despite a significantly lower percentage of CD20+ cells. Rituximab treatment is efficient in both seropositive and seronegative RA. However, seropositive RA patients tend to respond favorably compared with seronegative patients. The differential CD20 receptor expression in the two groups at relapse potentially suggests a different pathogenetic mechanism of relapse and merits further investigation.\n\nUse of a Relapse Monitoring Board\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMacFadden, Wayne; Anand, Ravi; Khanna, Sumant; Rapaport, Mark H.; Haskins, J. Thomas; Turkoz, Ibrahim; Alphs, Larry\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective: Independent review boards can provide an objective appraisal of investigators' decisions and may be useful for determining complex primary outcomes, such as bipolar disorder relapse, in crossnational studies. This article describes the use of an independent, blinded relapse monitoring board to assess the primary outcome (relapse) in an international clinical trial of risperidone long-acting therapy adjunctive to standard-care pharmacotherapy for patients with bipolar disorder. Design: The fully autonomous relapse monitoring board was composed of a chair and two additional membersâall psychiatrists and experts in the diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic management of bipolar disorder. The relapse monitoring board met six times during the study to review patient relapse data and was charged with the responsibility of determining if the events described by investigators qualified as relapses. Additionally, the relapse monitoring board reviewed data for all randomized patients to identify any relapse events not recognized by investigators. Results: Primary efficacy results were similar and significant for investigator- and relapse monitoring board-determined relapses. Ten discrepancies were noted: two of the 42 investigator-determined relapses did not meet the intended clinical relapse threshold as determined by the relapse monitoring board; conversely, the relapse monitoring board confirmed eight relapse events not identified by investigators. The relapse monitoring board had no direct interactions with patients and had to rely on the accuracy of investigator assessments. Also, once an investigator determined a relapse and the patients discontinued the study, less information was available to the relapse monitoring board for relapse assessment. Conclusions: Use of the relapse monitoring board supported the validity of the study by incorporating a level of standardization to mitigate the risk that local practice in different cultures and medical systems\n\nRelationship of expressed emotion with relapse of schizophrenia patients in Kelantan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAzhar, M Z; Varma, S L\n\n1996-02-01\n\nThe families of 83 schizophrenic patients were studied to find out the level of expressed emotion in them leading to the relapse of these patients. The patients were having more than two episodes of schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). The most salient finding was the virtual absence of high level of expressed emotion as the cause of relapse. It was found that the majority of the families (72.3%) had low expressed emotion while only 25.3% had high expressed emotion and only 2.4% families were equivocal in this respect. This finding is in contrast with various other findings in this area. The most likely explanation for this disagreement is the cultural differences between Malaysian patients and Western patients.\n\nPeripheral Blood WT1 Expression Predicts Relapse in AML Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMalagola, Michele; Skert, Cristina; Ruggeri, Giuseppina; Ribolla, Rossella; Bernardi, Simona; Borlenghi, Erika; Pagani, Chiara; Rossi, Giuseppe; Caimi, Luigi; Russo, Domenico\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo evaluate if WT1 expression may predict relapse after allo-SCT, we analyzed WT1 levels on peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) before and after allo-SCT in 24 AML patients with WT1 overexpression at diagnosis. Five copies of WT1/ABL Ã 104 from PB were identified as the threshold value that correlated with relapse after allo-SCT. The same correlation was not identified when WT1 expression was assessed from bone marrow (BM). Eight out of 11 (73%) patients with a pre-allo-SCT PB-WT1 â¥ 5 and 4/13 (31%) patients with a pre-allo-SCT PB-WT1 < 5 relapsed, respectively (P = 0.04). The incidence of relapse was higher in patients with PB-WT1 â¥ 5 measured after allo-SCT, at the 3rd (56% versus 38%; P = 0.43) and at the 6th month (71% versus 20%; P = 0.03). Patients with pretransplant PB-WT1 < 5 had significantly better 2-year OS and LFS than patients with a PB-WT1 â¥ 5 (81% versus 0% and 63% versus 20%) (P = 0.02). Our data suggest the usefulness of WT1 monitoring from PB to predict the relapse in allotransplanted AML patients and to modulate the intensity of conditioning and/or the posttransplant immunosuppression in an attempt to reduce the posttransplant relapse risk.

Retrospective study of patients with audiometric relapses, monitored from 1995 to 2014, in two centres of the Community of Madrid. We evaluated 31 patients with a mean age of 48.52 years (14.67 SD), of which 61.3% were women. Most hearing loss was fluctuating (48.4%). Only 16.1% of patients had systemic autoimmune disease. There is a moderate positive correlation between the sex variable and the systemic involvement variable (Spearman's correlation coefficient=0.356): specifically, between being female and systemic disease. The relative incidence rate of relapse in the first year was 2.01 relapses/year with a 95% CI (1.32 to 2.92). The mean survival time of the event (audiometric relapse) was 5.25 months (SD 0.756). With multivariate analysis, the only variable that achieved statistical significance was age, with a hazard ratio of 1.032 (95% CI; 1.001-1.063, P=.043). Immune-mediated disease of the inner ear is a chronic disease with relapses. Half of the patients with immunomediated hearing loss treated exclusively with corticosteroids relapse before 6 months of follow-up. In addition, if a patient has not relapsed, they are more likely to relapse as each year passes. Analysis of the of audiometric relapse- free survival will enable the effect of future treatments to be compared and their capacity to reduce the rhythm of relapses.

One hundred forty-four patients with stage II primary colon cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study. SOX9 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and mismatch repair status was assessed by both immunohistochemistry and promoter hypermethylation assay. High SOX9 expression at the invasive front was significantly associated with lower risk of relapse when including the SOX9 expression as a continuous variable (from low to high expression) in univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.94; P = .01) and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96; P = .02), adjusting for mismatch repair deficiency and histopathologic risk factors. Conversely, low SOX9 expression at the invasive front was significantly associated with high risk of relapse, when including SOX9 expression as a dichotomous variable, in univariate (HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.14-4.69; P = .02) and multivariate analyses (HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.14-4.69; P = .02), adjusting for histopathologic risk factors and mismatch repair deficiency. In conclusion, high levels of SOX9 of primary stage II colon tumors predict low risk of relapse, whereas low levels of SOX9 predict high risk of relapse. SOX9 may have an important value as a biomarker when evaluating risk of relapse for personalized treatment. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the frequency of tuberculosis (TB) patients at risk for relapse who received at least 9 months of anti-tuberculosis treatment (extended treatment) and to identify factors associated with not receiving extended treatment. We analyzed characteristics of culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients reported to the California TB Registry during 2004-2009. Patients with cavities on initial chest radiograph and delayed culture conversion (â©¾70 days) were at 'high risk of relapse', and anti-tuberculosis treatment of â©¾270 days was 'extended treatment'. We used a generalized linear model to identify independent risk factors for absence of extended treatment in the high risk of relapse group. Among 5680 TB patients, 483 (8.5%) were at high risk of relapse: 372 (77%) received extended treatment but 111 (23%) did not. Factors associated with absence of extended treatment included negative sputum smears (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 2.62, 95%CI 1.69-4.05), residence in three specific counties (aPR 1.71, 95%CI 1.19-2.46) and Black race (aPR 1.56, 95%CI 1.03-2.38). Nearly a quarter of TB patients at high risk of relapse did not receive extended treatment. Increased efforts are needed to ensure that all patients who may benefit from extended anti-tuberculosis treatment receive it.\n\nDurable responses to ibrutinib in patients with relapsed CLL after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLink, C S; Teipel, R; Heidenreich, F; RÃ¼cker-Braun, E; Schmiedgen, M; Reinhardt, J; OelschlÃ¤gel, U; von Bonin, M; Middeke, J M; Muetherig, A; Trautmann-Grill, K; Platzbecker, U; BornhÃ¤user, M; Schetelig, J\n\n2016-06-01\n\nIbrutinib, a recently approved inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), has shown great efficacy in patients with high-risk CLL. Nevertheless, there are few data regarding its use in patients who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We report clinical data from five CLL patients treated with ibrutinib for relapse after first or even second allogeneic transplantation. Additionally, we performed analyses on cytokine levels and direct measuring of CD4 Th1 and CD4 Th2 cells to evaluate possible clinically relevant immunomodulatory effects of ibrutinib. All patients achieved partial responses including one minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative remission. Within 1 year of follow-up, no relapse was observed. One patient died of severe pneumonia while on ibrutinib treatment. Beside this, no unexpected adverse events were observed. Flow cytometry and analyses of T cell-mediated cytokine levels (IL10 and TNFÎ±) did not reveal substantial changes in T-cell distribution in favor of a CD4 Th1 T-cell shift in our patients. No acute exacerbation of GvHD was reported. In conclusion, these results support further evaluation of ibrutinib in CLL patients relapsing after alloSCT.\n\nCyclophosphamide's addition in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with biochemical progression during lenalidomide-dexamethasone treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nCesini, Laura; Siniscalchi, Agostina; Grammatico, Sara; Andriani, Alessandro; Fiorini, Alessia; De Rosa, Luca; Za, Tommaso; Rago, Angela; Caravita, Tommaso; Petrucci, Maria Teresa\n\n2018-05-02\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the addition of cyclophosphamide in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma patients (RRMM) who experienced biochemical relapse or progression without CRAB, during treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), to slow down the progression in active relapse. This analysis included 31 patients with RRMM treated with Rd who received cyclophosphamide (CRd) at biochemical relapse. The CRd regimen was continued until disease progression. The median number of CRd cycles administered was 8 (range: 1-35). A response was observed in 9 (29%) patients. After a median observation time of 11Â months, the median overall survival (OS) from the beginning of CRd was 17.7Â months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) from the beginning of CRd was 13.1Â months. The addition of cyclophosphamide delays the progression in patients who present a biochemical relapse during Rd treatment. The response rate and the duration of PFS obtained with minimal toxicities and low costs induced us to setting up a randomized clinical trial. Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Studies have shown that addiction treatments can reduce impulsivity in drug-dependent individuals. Studies also have suggested that mindfulness is associated with impulsivity. However, no study has investigated the effectiveness of the mindfulness-based intervention on impulsivity in opioid-dependent individuals. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) with treatment as usual (TAU) in terms of impulsivity and relapse for methadone-treated patients. The present randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in Kashan, Iran, in 2015. The study population was opioid-dependent patients referred to Maintenance Treatment Centers. Seventy patients were selected by random sampling and were assigned in two groups (MBRP and TAU) randomly. The participants of two groups filled out Barratt impulsivity scale (BIS-11) as a pre-test and 8 weeks later as post-test and 2 months later as a follow-up. Both groups received methadone-therapy. The MBRP group received 8 sessions of group therapy, while the control group did not receive any group psychotherapy session. Finally, data from 60 patients were analyzed statistically. The MBRP group had decreased impulsivity significantly (P < 0.001). The mean impulsivity score was 74.76 Â± 4.72 before intervention that was significantly decreased to 57.66 Â± 3.73 and 58.86 Â± 3.57 after the intervention and follow-up (P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, significant differences were observed between MBRP and TAU groups for relapse frequency (P < 0.050). This study showed that MBRP compared to TAU can decrease the mean impulsivity score in opioid-dependent and reduce relapse probability. These findings suggest that MBRP is useful for opioid-dependent individuals with high-level impulsivity, and relapse prevention.\n\nDaily corticosteroids reduce infection-associated relapses in frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nGulati, Ashima; Sinha, Aditi; Sreenivas, Vishnubhatla; Math, Aparna; Hari, Pankaj; Bagga, Arvind\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRelapses of nephrotic syndrome often follow minor infections, commonly of the upper respiratory tract. Daily administration of maintenance prednisolone during intercurrent infections was examined to determine whether the treatment reduces relapse rates in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. In a randomized controlled trial (nonblind, parallel group, tertiary-care hospital), 100 patients with idiopathic, frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome eligible for therapy with prolonged low-dose, alternate-day prednisolone with or without levamisole were randomized to either receive their usual dose of alternate-day prednisolone daily for 7 days during intercurrent infections (intervention group) or continue alternate-day prednisolone (controls). Primary outcome was assessed by comparing the rates of infection-associated relapses at 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the frequency of infections and the cumulative amount of prednisolone received in both groups. Patients in the intervention group showed significantly lower infection-associated (rate difference, 0.7 episodes/patient per year; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.3, 1.1) and lower total relapse rates (0.9 episodes/patient per year, 95% CI 0.4, 1.4) without increase in steroid toxicity. Poisson regression, adjusted for occurrence of infections, showed that daily administration of prednisolone during infections independently resulted in 59% reduction in frequency of relapses (rate ratio, 0.41; 95% CI 0.3, 0.6). For every six patients receiving this intervention, one showed a reduction of relapse frequency to less than three per year. Daily administration of maintenance doses of prednisolone, during intercurrent infections, significantly reduces relapse rates and the proportion of children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome.\n\nIIVP salvage regimen induces high response rates in patients with relapsed lymphoma before autologous stem cell transplantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbali, Huseyin; Oyan, Basak; Koc, Yener; Kars, Ayse; Barista, Ibrahim; Uner, Aysegul; Turker, Alev; Demirkazik, Figen; Tekin, Fatma; Tekuzman, Gulten; Kansu, Emin\n\n2005-06-01\n\nPatients with relapsed lymphoma can be cured with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). New therapeutic approaches with better cytoreductive capacity are needed for relapsed patients to keep their chance for cure with transplantation. We report 30 patients with relapsed lymphoma, median age 43 years, treated with IIVP salvage regimen consisting of ifosfamide, mesna, idarubicin, and etoposide for 2 or 3 cycles. Seventeen patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and 13 patients had Hodgkin disease (HD). Fourteen (47%) patients were at their first relapse. Overall response rate was 86.6% (n = 26) with 19 patients (63.3%) achieving complete response. Overall response rate was 92% in patients with HD and 82% in NHL. The most frequent side effects observed were grade III-IV neutropenia (87%) and thrombocytopenia (73%). IIVP regimen is a highly effective salvage therapy for patients with relapsed HD or NHL who are candidates for autologous HSCT. Close follow up is necessary because of the high incidence of grade III-IV hematologic toxicity.\n\nRelapsed neuroblastomas show frequent RAS-MAPK pathway mutations | Office of Cancer Genomics\n\nCancer.gov\n\nThe majority of patients with neuroblastoma have tumors that initially respond to chemotherapy, but a large proportion will experience therapy-resistant relapses. The molecular basis of this aggressive phenotype is unknown. Whole-genome sequencing of 23 paired diagnostic and relapse neuroblastomas showed clonal evolution from the diagnostic tumor, with a median of 29 somatic mutations unique to the relapse sample. Eighteen of the 23 relapse tumors (78%) showed mutations predicted to activate the RAS-MAPK pathway.\n\nEfficacy and Safety of Ibrutinib in Indian Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Mantle Cell Lymphoma: Cases from a Named Patient Program.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgarwal, Mohan B; Bhurani, Dinesh; Shah, Chirag; Sood, Nitin; Singhal, Manish; Kamat, Anil; Chezhian, Subash; Mishra, Suryaprakash; Nagrale, Dinesh\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis named patient program evaluated the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib, a selective inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase in Indian patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, with/without chromosome 17 deletion [del17p]) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The eight enrolled patients (relapsed/refractory CLL: n = 6 [4/6 patients with del17p] and relapsed/refractory MCL: n = 2) had median age of 55 years (range, 52-60) and had received a median of 3 (CLL patients) and 4 (MCL patients) prior therapies. Patients received once-daily dose of ibrutinib (420 mg: CLL, 560 mg: MCL). In CLL patients, the median time to response was 3 months (range, 0.5-7) and five of six patients had partial response (PR) whereas one achieved complete response (CR). Median time on treatment was 11.5 months (range, 8-14); five patients continued treatment and one was recommended stem cell transplantation (SCT). Of the two MCL patients, one achieved PR and one showed CR and advanced to SCT. In CLL patients, the median (range) hemoglobin level improved from 9.8 g/dL (7.2-11) at baseline to 12.0 g/dL (9.5-13.2) and median (range) platelet count improved from 150,000 cells/Î¼L (21,000-195,000) at baseline to 190,350 cells/Î¼L (130,000-394,000) at the time of analysis (July 2016). Most adverse events (AEs) reported were infections ( n = 2). No Grade 3-4 or serious AEs, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuation due to AEs were reported. In this first real-world experience in Indian patients, ibrutinib demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in relapsed/refractory CLL (with/without del17p) and MCL. Safety results were consistent with the current known profile of ibrutinib.\n\nSocio-economic correlates of relapsed patients admitted in a Nigerian mental health institution.\n\nPubMed\n\nGbiri, Caleb A; Badru, Fatai A; Ladapo, Harry T O; Gbiri, Adefolakemi A\n\n2011-03-01\n\nRelapse in psychiatric disorders is highly distressing, costly and engenders burn-out syndrome among mental-health workers. To study the socio-economic factors associated with relapse in individual admitted with psychiatric disorders and the pattern of socio-economic impact of relapse in those groups. A cross-sectional survey of all relapsed patients without cognitive deficit admitted into the federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria between June and October 2007 was conducted using a self-validated Structured Interview Schedule (Relapse Socio-economic Impact Interview Schedule) and Key Informant Interview Guide. Secondary data were elicited from the patient folders, case notes, ward admission registers and nominal rolls. Data were summarised using mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentiles. Pearson's moment correlation coefficient was used to test the association among variables. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the pre-morbid and the post-morbid states. This study involved 102 respondents. Their mean age was 36.5 Â± 9.8 years, mainly of male gender (72.5%) suffering from schizophrenic disorder (37.8%). Relapse and re-admission ranged between 2 and 12. Unemployment rate, marital separation and divorce increased more than 5-fold from pre-morbid to morbid states. Few (4.9%) could still settle their hospital/drug bills on their own, while most (95.1%) depended on family, philanthropist and government/waivers to pay for their bills. Their social relationships were negatively influenced with most of them expressing social isolation and low quality of life. There were significant relationships (P<0.05) between age, sex, number of relapses, number of admissions, pre-morbid marital status, morbid state marital status, pre-morbid state occupational status and morbid state occupational status. There was significant change (P= 0.00) in the quality of life, societal integration/acceptability, economic status, employment status and marital status\n\nOutcome of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarkozy, ClÃ©mentine; Gardin, Claude; Gachard, Nathalie; Merabet, Fathia; Turlure, Pascal; Malfuson, Jean-ValÃ¨re; Pautas, CÃ©cile; Micol, Jean-Baptiste; Thomas, Xavier; Quesnel, Bruno; Celli-Lebras, Karine; Preudhomme, Claude; TerrÃ©, Christine; Fenaux, Pierre; Chevret, Sylvie; Castaigne, Sylvie; Dombret, HervÃ©\n\n2013-09-01\n\nTo provide data for future drug evaluation, we analyzed the outcome of 393 patients aged 50 years or older (median, 64 years) with AML in first relapse after treatment in recent ALFA trials. Salvage options were retrospectively classified as follows: best supportive care (BSC), low-dose cytarabine (LDAC), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), intensive chemotherapy (ICT), or ICT combined with GO. Second complete remission (CR2) rate was 31% and median post-relapse survival was 6.8 months (0, 17, 42.5, 53, and 80% and 3.2, 5.6, 8.9, 9, and 19.8 months in BSC, LDAC, GO, ICT, and ICTâ+âGO subsets, respectively). Age, performance status, WBC, CR1 duration, and favorable AML karyotype, but not other cytogenetic or molecular features, influenced post-relapse outcome. Multivariate adjustment and propensity score matching showed that intensive salvage (ICT/ICT+GO/GO versus LDAC/BSC) was associated with longer post-relapse survival, at least in patients with CR1 duration â¥12 months (Pâ=â0.001 and 0.0005, respectively). Of interest, GO appeared to be as effective as standard ICT, and ICTâ+âGO combination more effective than standard ICT. In conclusion, older patients with CR1 duration â¥12 months appeared to benefit from intensive salvage and results observed with GO-containing salvage suggest that GO combination studies should be actively pursued in this setting.

Two cases are reported here of pediatric patients with pretreated relapsing synovial sarcoma whose tumors showed a prolonged response to pazopanib given on compassionate grounds. These results suggest that new agents found effective in adult patients might achieve similar results in adolescents with the same disease. Facilitating the availability of new drugs for children and adolescents is a major challenge for pediatric oncologists.\n\nBaclofen as relapse prevention in the treatment of gamma-hydroxybutyrate dependence: a case series.\n\nPubMed\n\nKamal, Rama M; Loonen, Anton J M; Dijkstra, Boukje A G; De Jong, Cornelis A J\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn the last decade, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) abuse and dependence have increased. It has been reported that GHB dependence has a high rate of relapse, serious complications of intoxication, and a potentially life-threatening withdrawal syndrome. Nevertheless, in clinical practice, there is no known medical treatment to support GHB relapse prevention. We describe a case series of patients who were supported through an off-label treatment with baclofen to avoid a relapse into GHB abuse, for a period of 12 weeks. Nine of 11 patients did not relapse while taking a dose ranging from 30 to 60 mg per day, one patient relapsed after 5 weeks, and one stopped after 7 weeks. Baclofen was well tolerated; patients reported mild side effects such as fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, excessive sweating, and depressive feelings. Although systematic evidence is still lacking, our practice-based experience suggests that treatment with baclofen to assist abstinence might be effective in patients with GHB dependence. Further systematic controlled studies are necessary to establish the exact efficacy and safety of baclofen as relapse prevention for GHB-dependent patients.\n\nPossible Association between Serum Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) Levels and Relapse in Depressed Patients following Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShibasaki, Chiyo; Itagaki, Kei; Abe, Hiromi; Kajitani, Naoto; Okada-Tsuchioka, Mami; Takebayashi, Minoru\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAbstract Background Matrix metalloproteinases are involved in neuroinflammatory processes, which could underlie depression. Serum levels of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in depressed patients are significantly altered following electroconvulsive therapy, but an association between altered matrix metalloproteinases after successful ECT and possible relapse has yet to be investigated. Methods Serum was obtained twice, before and immediately after a course of electroconvulsive therapy, from 38 depressed patients. Serum was also collected, once, from two groups of age- and gender-matched healthy controls, 40 volunteers in each group. Possible associations between levels of matrix metalloproteinases and relapse during a 1-year follow-up period were analyzed. Results Excluding patients who did not respond to electroconvulsive therapy and patients lost to follow-up, data from 28 patients were evaluated. Eighteen of the patients (64.3%) relapsed within 1 year. In the group that did not relapse, serum levels of MMP-9 were significantly decreased after a course of electroconvulsive therapy, but not in the group that relapsed. No association between MMP-2 and relapse was observed. Conclusion The degree of change in serum MMP-9 change could be associated with relapse following electroconvulsive therapy in depressed patients.
