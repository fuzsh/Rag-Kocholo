Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL falls within the spectrum of these diseases and has a mortality rate of more than 80% within 2 years of diagnosis. Curcumin, derived from turmeric, has been shown to have a clinical benefit in some patients with PCDs. In addition to a clinical benefit in these patients, curcumin has been found to have a strong affinity for fibrillar amyloid proteins. We thus administered curcumin to a patient with laryngeal amyloidosis and smoldering myeloma and found that the patient has shown a lack of progression of his disease for a period of five years. This is in keeping with our previous findings of clinical benefits of curcumin in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias. We recommend further evaluation of curcumin in patients with primary AL amyloidosis.\n\nDysphonia â the single symptom of rifampicin resistant laryngeal tuberculosis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaulauskienÄ Iveta\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Tuberculosis is still the most frequent granulomatous laryngeal disease. Absence of pathognomonic symptoms and change in clinical pattern frequently leads to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Hoarseness is the commonest symptom of laryngeal tuberculosis and constitutional symptoms are usually rare. However dysphonia can be caused by many other more common conditions. Hoarseness can be a symptom of organic (nodules and polyps of vocal folds, tumors, vocal fold paresis or functional (functional dysphonia, laryngeal conversion disorder, paradoxical vocal folds motion conditions. Rarely systemic diseases as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Wegenerâs granulomatosis or tuberculosis can cause vocal dysfunction too. That is why laryngeal tuberculosis is often forgotten in case of persistent hoarseness. In this article, we present a case of a young previously healthy woman, complaining of persistent hoarseness with no other leading symptoms. Though endoscopic image suggested a malignancy, histology showed granulomatous lesion. Detailed examination revealed laryngeal and pulmonary tuberculosis resistant to rifampicin. Conclusion: Dysphonia can be the only one symptom of laryngeal tuberculosis. The disease should be taken into consideration when a patient complains of persistent hoarseness in order to avoid delays in treatment and spread of infection.\n\nSubtle neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive changes in hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKantanen, Mari; Kiuru-Enari, Sari; Salonen, Oili; Kaipainen, Markku; Hokkanen, Laura\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis) is an autosomal dominant form of systemic amyloidosis caused by a c.640G>A or c.640G>T mutation in the gene coding for gelsolin.

We report an unusual clinical presentation of primary amyloidosis in a previously asymptomatic 65 years old woman who was admitted to the hospital because of ictericia and ascitis mimicking a drug induced acute hepatic failure.\n\nTreatment of amyloidosis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTan, S Y; Pepys, M B; Hawkins, P N\n\n1995-08-01\n\nAmyloidosis is the extracellular deposition of normally soluble autologous protein in a characteristic abnormal fibrillar form. Systemic amyloidosis and some local forms are progressive, cause major morbidity, and are often fatal. No treatment specifically causes the resolution of amyloid deposits, but therapy that reduces the supply of amyloid fibril precursor proteins can improve survival and preserve organ function. Major regression of amyloid occurs in at least a proportion of such cases, suggesting that the clinical improvement reflects mobilization of amyloid. The clearest evidence for regression of amyloid has been obtained in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients with AA amyloidosis treated with chlorambucil. This drug suppresses the acute phase production of serum amyloid A protein, the precursor of AA amyloid fibrils, and is associated with remission of proteinuria and greatly improved survival. In many such patients, scintigraphy with serum amyloid P component shows major regression of amyloid over 12 to 36 months and frequently reveals a discrepancy between the local amyloid load and organ dysfunction. Measurement of target organ function is therefore not an adequate method for monitoring treatment aimed at promoting the resolution of amyloid. In monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis the aim of treatment is to suppress the underlying B-cell clone and, therefore, production of the amyloid fibril precursor protein. This can be difficult to achieve or sustain and, since the prognosis is so poor, many patients die before benefits of therapy are realized. A recent development has been the introduction of liver transplantation as treatment for familial amyloid polyneuropathy caused by transthyretin gene mutations. This leads to the disappearance of variant transthyretin from the plasma and halts progression of the neurologic disease. Features of autonomic neuropathy frequently ameliorate, and improvement in peripheral motor nerve function\n\nOverview of systemic and localized amyloidosis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSaulius Girnius\n\n2013-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Amyloidosis is a family of protein misfolding disorders, in which insoluble fibrillar proteins deposit extracellularly and cause end organ damage. Depending on the precursor protein, clinical manifestations in amyloidosis vary significantly. In systemic amyloidosis, the heart, kidneys, and nerves are most commonly affected, resulting in congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, nephrotic syndrome, renal failure, and peripheral and autonomic neuropathies. In localized amyloidosis, amyloid deposits at the site of production, so only one organ is disrupted. Once amyloidosis is confirmed histologically, the precursor subtype must be identified using immunohistochemistry, immunofixation, electron microscopy, or laser microdissection and mass spectrometry. Treatment should not be initiated prior to the identification of the type of amyloidosis. Currently, treatment focuses on the suppression of the precursor protein: in AL amyloidosis, chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplants suppress production of immunoglobulin light chains; in AA amyloidosis, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory agents suppress amyloid A production; and in AF amyloidosis, a liver transplantation removes the source of mutant transthyretin protein production. Newer drugs are being developed to target amyloidosis at an epigenetic level or stabilize folding intermediates, but there are currently in development.http://dx.doi.org/10.7175/rhc.v4i4.662\n\n[AA amyloidosis: a little-known complication of chronic leg ulcer].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWaton, J; Fays-Michel, S; Chandeclerc, M L; Corby, S; Cuny, J F; Barbaud, A; Schmutz, J-L\n\n2008-02-01\n\nAA amyloidosis, secondary to inflammatory chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, is often complicated by renal failure. Chronic inflammatory dermatoses constitute rare causes of AA amyloidosis. We describe two cases of AA amyloidosis discovered after renal failure in patients presenting leg ulcers for several years. AL amyloidosis was suspected in both cases because of a history of monoclonal gammopathy in one patient and of plasmocytoma in the other. The diagnosis of AA amyloidosis was confirmed on renal histology through the detection of AA antibodies in amyloid deposits. No extrarenal amyloidosis was seen in either patient and there were no inflammatory diseases other than chronic leg ulcers. AA amyloidosis is caused by serum amyloid protein A (SAA), a reactive inflammatory protein. AA amyloidosis is thus caused by chronic inflammatory diseases, but only rarely by cutaneous inflammatory diseases. To our knowledge, the literature contains only seven other published cases of AA amyloidosis secondary to chronic leg ulcers. A review of the literature does not indicate whether cure of ulcers has any effect on the accompanying renal failure. We imagine that AA amyloidosis secondary to leg ulcer is in fact under-diagnosed. However, since the first specific treatment for AA amyloidosis is currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration, it is essential that this serious complication of chronic leg ulcers be widely recognised.\n\nSubtle neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive changes in hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKantanen, Mari; Kiuru-Enari, Sari; Salonen, Oili; Kaipainen, Markku; Hokkanen, Laura\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis) is an autosomal dominant form of systemic amyloidosis caused by a c.640G>A or c.640G>T mutation in the gene coding for gelsolin.

To investigate further if AGel amyloidosis carries a risk for a specific neuropsychological or psychiatric symptomatology we studied 35 AGel patients and 29 control subjects. Neuropsychological tests showed abnormalities in visuocontructional and -spatial performance in AGel patients, also some indication of problems in processing efficacy was found. At psychiatric evaluation the patient group showed more psychiatric symptomatology, mainly depression. In brain MRI, available in 16 patients and 14 controls, we found microhemorrhages or microcalcifications only in the patient group, although the number of findings was small. Our study shows that AGel amyloidosis can be associated with visuoconstructional problems and depression, but severe neuropsychiatric involvement is not characteristic. The gelsolin mutation may even induce cerebrovascular fragility, but further epidemiological and histopathological as well as longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to clarify gelsolin-related vascular pathology and its clinical consequences.\n\nSubtle neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive changes in hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMari Kantanen\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis (AGel amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant form of systemic amyloidosis caused by a c.640G>A or c.640G>T mutation in the gene coding for gelsolin.

We therefore performed pathophysiological studies in three such patients in an effort to determine the mechanism of amyloid diarrhea. Epithelial cell absorption rate of electrolytes was measured during steady state GI perfusion of a saline-mannitol solution. GI transit time of PEG and absorption of radiolabeled bile acid were measured simultaneously while subjects ingested three meals per day. To obtain a diarrhea control group for transit time and bile acid absorption, normal subjects were studied when they had diarrhea caused by ingestion of Milk of Magnesia (MOM). Diarrhea could not be explained by malabsorption of ingested nutrients, bacterial overgrowth, bile acid malabsorption, or epithelial cell malabsorption of electrolytes. However, 25% of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ingested with a standard meal was recovered in stool in 45 min, which is 10 times faster than in normal subjects with equally severe diarrhea caused by ingestion of MOM. All of the patients had autonomic neuropathy that remained unrecognized for 15-36 months after onset of chronic diarrhea; it seems likely that this was the cause of rapid transit. Severe chronic diarrhea in three patients with systemic amyloidosis was mediated by extremely rapid transit of chyme and digestive secretions through the intestine.\n\nAmyloidosis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n... is less common with modern dialysis techniques.

Hardly any incidence data are available and most survival data are limited to specialist clinics. Methods Amyloidosis patients were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge and Outpatients Registers from years 2001 through 2008. Results The incidence of non-hereditary amyloidosis in 949 patients was 8.29 per million person-years and the diagnostic age with the highest incidence was over 65 years. Secondary systemic amyloidosis showed an incidence of 1 per million and a female excess and the largest number of subsequent rheumatoid arthritis deaths; the median survival was 4 years. However, as rheumatoid arthritis deaths also occurred in other diagnostic subtypes, the incidence of secondary systemic amyloidosis was likely to be about 2.0 per million. The median survival of patients with organ-limited amyloidosis was 6 years. Most myeloma deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with unspecified or âotherâ amyloidosis. These subtypes probably accounted for most of immunoglobulin light chain (AL amyloidosis cases; the median survival time was 3 years. Conclusions The present diagnostic categorization cannot single out AL amyloidosis in the Swedish discharge data but, by extrapolation from myeloma cases, an incidence of 3.2 per million could be ascribed to AL amyloidosis. Similarly, based on rheumatoid arthritis death rates, an incidence of 2.0 could be ascribed to secondary systemic amyloidosis.\n\nLichen amyloidosis induced on the upper back by long-term friction with a nylon towel.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYoshida, Aki; Takahashi, Kazuhiro; Tagami, Hachiro; Akasaka, Toshihide\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPrimary localized cutaneous amyloidosis can take several clinical forms. In Asia, macular amyloidosis caused by prolonged friction from a rough nylon towel or brush is common, and macular amyloidosis and lichen amyloidosis occasionally occur together, as so-called biphasic amyloidosis. We report herein the case of an 83-year-old Japanese man with lichen amyloidosis caused by prolonged nylon towel friction. This patient presented with unique symmetrical papular lesions on the upper back and shoulders. Lesions comprised slightly shiny, brownish, fine uniform papules approximately 0.5 mm in diameter, showing a partially linear, annular or rippled arrangement. Although this case was caused by prolonged nylon towel friction, no coexisting macular lesions could be found. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first case of lichen amyloidosis induced by nylon towel friction in the absence of the macular amyloidosis that is usually observed in such cases. We instructed the patient to stop the habit of nylon towel rubbing and prescribed a topical steroid ointment and cepharanthine. After 6 months of treatment, papular lesions became clearly flatter.\n\nAmyloidosis in alkaptonuria.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMillucci, Lia; Braconi, Daniela; Bernardini, Giulia; Lupetti, Pietro; Rovensky, Josef; Ranganath, Lakshminaryan; Santucci, Annalisa\n\n2015-09-01\n\nAlkaptonuria (AKU) is an ultra-rare inborn error of metabolism developed from the lack of homogentisic acid oxidase activity, causing homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulation that produces an HGA-melanin ochronotic pigment, of hitherto unknown composition. Besides the accumulation of HGA, the potential role and presence of unidentified proteins has been hypothesized as additional causal factors involved in ochronotic pigment deposition. Evidence has been provided on the presence of serum amyloid A (SAA) in several AKU tissues, which allowed classifying AKU as a novel secondary amyloidosis. In this paper, we will briefly review all direct and indirect lines of evidence related to the presence of amyloidosis in AKU. We also report the first data on abnormal SAA serum levels in a cohort of AKU patients.\n\nLaryngeal neurinoma.

It is usually seen in 50â80-year olds. It is developed from cricoid cartilage largely. Patients have laryngeal CS complaint of respiratuvar distress, dysphonia, and dysphagia generally. A submucous mass is usually seen in physical examination with an intact mucosa. Distant metastasis is rare in CSs. Main treatment is surgical excision. An 82-year-old patient who has respiratuvar distress is presented in this paper and laryngeal CS is reviewed in the light of the literature.\n\nLocalized gastrointestinal amyloidosis presenting with protein-losing enteropathy and massive hemorrhage\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBÃ¡rbara CorrÃªa\n\nFull Text Available Amyloidosis of the gastrointestinal tract is usually a systemic disease.

Otherwise a passage of these particles into the trachea or the lower respiratory tract would be imminent. An aspiration could mechanically block the respiratory tract and cause severe dyspnoea or cause aspiration pneumonia. For this systematic review a selective literature research in PubMed and Scopus using the keywords \"laryngeal adductor reflex\" and \"vocal fold closure\" has been carried out. Apart from the oesophago-glottal and pharyngo-glottal closure reflexes, the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) has been investigated in particular. The LAR qualifies as a reflectory laryngeal adductor mechanism and involves early, presumably di- or oligosynaptic ipsilateral LAR1 as well as late polysynaptic ipsi- and contralateral LAR2 components. In clinical routine diagnostic settings of dysphagia, LAR is only assessed qualitatively and usually triggered by air pulses or tactile stimulation. Dysphagiologists often find that not only the laryngeal sensibility in general is impaired, but especially the protective laryngeal adduction mechanism, which results in a higher risk of aspiration. Thus, it appears mandatory to test the LAR not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Unfortunately a valid and reliable method that can be employed in clinical practice has not yet been put forward.

Its cause is unknown. Five different types of amyloidosis have been described according to the underlying disease; immunoglobulin amyloidosis, ,familial amyloidosis, senile systemic amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis and hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis. We report a case of hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis in a 56-year-old man that radionuclide imaging demonstrated intense uptake of Tc-99m MDP within the myocardium. The diagnosis of amyloidosis was established by analysis of aspirated abdominal fat, although other non- invasive modalities didn't reveal any positive findings. The,first clue to the possible presence of amyloidosis in this case was provided by the radionuclide bone scan performed, which revealed intense tracer uptake in the heart suggesting amyloid deposit. We conclude that in cases of extraosseous accumulation of' Tc-99 MDP especially as a diffuse pattern of myocardial uptake, a diagnosis of amyloidosis should be considered, in an appropriate clinical setting\n\nSpontaneous, Experimentally Induced, and Transmissible AA Amyloidosis in Japanese Quail ( Coturnix japonica).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNakayama, Yumi; Kamiie, Junichi; Watanabe, Gen; Suzuki, Kazuhiko; Murakami, Tomoaki\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe authors describe a spontaneous case of amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis in an adult female Japanese quail ( Coturnix japonica). The bird developed AA amyloidosis secondary to chronic peritonitis caused by a Gram-negative bacillus infection. Mild amyloid deposition was also identified in the intestinal tract of apparently healthy adult individuals, suggesting that quail may develop intestinal amyloidosis with age. Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that quail can develop AA amyloidosis following inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, adult quail were repeatedly injected with LPS and the development of AA amyloidosis was confirmed. The amyloid deposition in this model increased when quail amyloid was intravenously injected as an amyloid-enhancing factor. The experiments were repeated with young quail, but amyloid deposits were not observed following LPS injections. However, AA amyloidosis did develop when quail amyloid was injected in addition to LPS. These results indicated that adult quail develop AA amyloidosis after inflammatory stimulation with LPS. Furthermore, quail AA amyloidosis was shown to have transmissibility regardless of age. Interestingly, the authors found that administration of chicken amyloid fibrils also induced AA amyloidosis in young quail. This is the first report of cross-species transmission of avian AA amyloidosis.\n\nOutcomes after Bronchoscopic Procedures for Primary Tracheobronchial Amyloidosis: Retrospective Study of 6 Cases\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIhsan Alloubi\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Respiratory amyloidosis is a rare disease which refers to localized aberrant extracellular protein deposits within the airways. Tracheobronchial amyloidosis (TBA refers to the deposition of localized amyloid deposits within the upper airways. Treatments have historically focused on bronchoscopic techniques including debridement, laser ablation, balloon dilation, and stent placement. We present the outcomes after rigid bronchoscopy to remove the amyloid protein causing the airway obstruction in 6 cases of tracheobronchial amyloidosis. This is the first report of primary diffuse tracheobronchial amyloidosis in our department; clinical features, in addition to therapy in the treatment of TBA, are reviewed. This paper shows that, in patients with TBA causing airway obstruction, excellent results can be obtained with rigid bronchoscopy and stenting of the obstructing lesion.\n\nOutcomes after bronchoscopic procedures for primary tracheobronchial amyloidosis: retrospective study of 6 cases.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlloubi, Ihsan; Thumerel, Matthieu; BÃ©gueret, Hugues; Baste, Jean-Marc; Velly, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Jougon, Jacques\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRespiratory amyloidosis is a rare disease which refers to localized aberrant extracellular protein deposits within the airways.

But localised valvular amyloid deposits are very uncommon. It was only in 1922 that the cases of valvular amyloidosis were reported. Then in 1980, Goffin et al reported another type of valvular amyloidosis, which he called the dystrophic valvular amyloidosis. We report a case of aortic valve amyloidosis which is different from the yet described valvular amyloidosis. Case presentation A 72 years old gentleman underwent urgent aortic valve replacement. Intraoperatively, a lesion was found attached to the inferior surface of his bicuspid aortic valve. Histopathology examination of the valve revealed that the lesion contained amyloid deposits, identified as AL amyloidosis. The serum amyloid A protein (SAP scan was normal and showed no evidence of systemic amyloidosis. The ECG and echocardiogram were not consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. Conclusion Two major types of cardiac amyloidosis have been described in literature: primary-myelomatous type (occurs with systemic amyolidosis, and senile type(s. Recently, a localised cardiac dystrophic valvular amyloidosis has been described. In all previously reported cases, there was a strong association of localised valvular amyloidosis with calcific deposits. Ours is a unique case which differs from the previously reported cases of localised valvular amyloidosis. In this case, the lesion was not associated with any scar tissue. Also there was no calcific deposit found. This may well be a yet unknown type of isolated valvular amyloidosis.\n\nEvaluation of 61 Secondary Amyloidosis Patients: A Single-Center Experience from Turkey\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCan Huzmeli\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Aim: To evaluate demographic,clinical and laboratory characteristics, causes, MEFV gene mutations, and mortality rates of patients with secondary amyloidosis. Material and Method: 61 patients who had been diagnosed with secondary amyloidosis by renal and rectal biopsy between 2007 and 2013 in the nephrology clinic of Cumhuriyet University, Faculty of Medicine, were included in the study. Demographic characteristics, causes of secondary amyloidosis, MEFV gene mutations, end-stage renal failure (ESRF, renal transplantation, and mortality rates were examined retrospectively. Results: In etiological terms, Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF occurrence was 62.2% (38, bronchiectasis and emphysema 9.8% (6, tuberculosis 4.9% (3, coexistence of FMF and ankylosing spondylitis 3.2% (2, coexistence of FMF and rheumatoid arthritis 1.6% (1, coexistence of FMF and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE 1.6% (1, osteomyelitis 1.6% (1, septic arthritis 1.6% (1, Crohn%u2019s disease 1.6% (1, colon cancer 1.6% (1, coexistence of bronchiectasis and tuberculosis 1.6% (1, rheumatoid arthritis 1.6% (1, and idiopathic cases 6.5% (4. Proteinuria was determined at nephrotic level among 68% (32 of 47 patients who had secondary amyloidosis. MEFV gene mutation of 45 patients with secondary amyloidosis was assessed. Most patients had M694V gene mutation. Surprisingly, we detected heterozygous E148Q mutation in 3 cases. 12 cases died; of these, 9 had ESRF. Five cases with ESRF underwent renal transplantation. Discussion: We found FMF as the most common cause for secondary AA amyloidosis in this study. Further studies should be done with larger or multicenter cohorts.\n\nLong-Term Results of Conformal Radiotherapy for Progressive Airway Amyloidosis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTruong, Minh Tam, E-mail: mitruong@bu.edu [Department of Radiation Oncology, Amyloid Treatment and Research Program, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA (United States); Kachnic, Lisa A.

Methods and Materials: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with biopsy-proven progressive airway amyloidosis treated with conformal RT between 2000 and 2006 at Boston Medical Center. The patients were evaluated for performance status and pulmonary function, with computed tomography and endoscopy after RT compared with the pretreatment studies. Local control was defined as the lack of progression of airway wall thickening on computed tomography imaging and stable endobronchial deposits by endoscopy. Results: A total of 10 symptomatic airway amyloidosis patients (3 laryngeal and 7 tracheobronchial) received RT to a median total dose of 20 Gy in 10 fractions within 2 weeks. At a median follow-up of 6.7 years (range, 1.5-10.3), 8 of the 10 patients had local control. The remaining 2 patients underwent repeat RT 6 and 8.4 months after initial RT, 1 for persistent bronchial obstruction and 1 for progression of subglottic amyloid disease with subsequent disease control. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved at a median of 18 months after RT compared with the baseline values, from a median score of 2 to a median of 1 (p = .035). Airflow (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) measurements increased compared with the baseline values at each follow-up evaluation, reaching a 10.7% increase (p = .087) at the last testing (median duration, 64.8 months). Acute toxicity was limited to Grade 1-2 esophagitis, occurring in 40% of patients. No late toxicity was observed. Conclusions: RT prevented progressive amyloid deposition in 8 of 10 patients, resulting in a marginally increased forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and improved functional capacity, without late morbidity.\n\nAutologous Stem Cell Transplant for AL Amyloidosis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVivek Roy\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available AL amyloidosis is caused by clonal plasma cells that produce immunoglobulin light chains which misfold and get deposited as amyloid fibrils. Therapy directed against the plasma cell clone leads to clinical benefit. Melphalan and corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for a number of years and the recent availability of other effective agents (IMiDs and proteasome inhibitors has increased treatment options. Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT has been used in the treatment of AL amyloidosis for many years. It is associated with high rates of hematologic response and improvement in organ function. However, transplant carries considerable risks. Careful patient selection is important to minimize transplant related morbidity and mortality and ensure optimal patient outcomes. As newer more affective therapies become available the role and timing of ASCT in the overall treatment strategy of AL amyloidosis will need to be continually reassessed.\n\nUpper Gastrointestinal Bleeding from Gastric Amyloidosis in a Patient with Smoldering Multiple Myeloma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMihajlo Gjeorgjievski\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Amyloidosis is a common complication of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS, smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM, and multiple myeloma (MM. This proteinaceous material can be deposited intercellularly in any organ system, including the gastrointestinal (GI tract. In the GI tract, amyloidosis affects the duodenum most commonly, followed by the stomach and colorectum. Gastric amyloidosis causes symptoms of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, abdominal pain, and GI bleeding. A case of upper GI bleeding from gastric amyloidosis is presented in a patient with SMM. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD revealed a gastric mass. Endoscopic biopsies revealed amyloid deposition in the lamina propria, consistent with gastric amyloidosis. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry performed on peptides extracted from Congo red-positive microdissected areas of paraffin-embedded stomach specimens revealed a peptide profile consistent with AL- (lambda- type amyloidosis. Based on this and multiple other case reports, we recommend that patients with GI bleeding and MGUS, SMM, or MM undergo EGD and pathologic examination of endoscopic biopsies of identified lesions using Congo red stains for amyloidosis for early diagnosis and treatment.\n\nSection four: laryngitis and dysphonia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHueston, William J; Kaur, Dipinpreet\n\n2013-12-01\n\nAcute laryngitis is most often caused by viral illnesses through direct inflammation of the vocal cords or from irritation due to postnasal drainage. Bacterial infections, such as acute epiglottitis, also can cause dysphonia but typically have other systemic symptoms as well as respiratory distress. Chronic laryngitis is characterized by symptoms lasting more than 3 weeks. Chronic vocal cord issues can be related to overuse or stress on the vocal cords resulting in nodules or polyps. Individuals in certain occupations, such as singers, school teachers, and chemical workers, are at greater risk of chronic laryngitis. The diagnostic approach to chronic laryngitis should include visualization of the vocal cords to rule out potential malignant lesions. For acute and chronic overuse symptoms, the best treatment is vocal rest. The use of antibiotics or decongestants should be discouraged.

Most patients have evidence of isolated monoclonal gammopathy or smoldering myeloma, and the occurrence of AL amyloidosis in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma or other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is unusual. The key event in the development of AL amyloidosis is the change in the secondary or tertiary structure of an abnormal monoclonal LC, which results in instable conformation. This conformational change is responsible for abnormal folding of the LC, rich in Î² leaves, which assemble into monomers that stack together to form amyloid fibrils. Epidemiology AL amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidois in developed countries with an estimated incidence of 9 cases/million inhabitant/year. The average age of diagnosed patients is 65 years and less than 10% of patients are under 50. Clinical description The clinical presentation is protean, because of the wide number of tissues or organs that may be affected. The most common presenting symptoms are asthenia and dyspnoea, which are poorly specific and may account for delayed diagnosis. Renal manifestations are the most frequent, affecting two thirds of patients at presentation. They are characterized by heavy proteinuria, with nephrotic syndrome and impaired renal function in half of the patients. Heart involvement, which is present at diagnosis in more than 50% of patients, leading to restrictive cardiopathy, is the most serious complication and engages prognosis. Diagnostic methods The diagnosis relies on pathological examination of an involved site showing Congo red-positive amyloid deposits, with typical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, that stain positive with an anti-LC antibody by immunohistochemistry and\n\nl'amylose laryngÃ©e Ã propos d'un cas laryngeal location of amylosis\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nmaxillofac. 1992 ; 93 : 54-57. 5-Vicente Villagomez, Felicitos Santos, Ramiro Santos and al.

Friction has recently been implicated the causation of early lesions, referred to as frictional amyloidosis. Confirmation of diagnosis by the detect on of amyloid using histochemical stains is inconsistent. Ten patients with pigmentation suggestive of macular amyloidosis were studied with detailed history, clinical examination, biopsy for histochemistry and electron microscopy. Nine out of ten patients had a history of prolonged friction with various objects such as bath sponges, brushes, towels, plant sticks and leaves. Amyloid was demonstrated by histochemical staining in only six out of ten cases. In the remaining four cases, amyloid was detected by electron microscopy. These consisted of aggregates of non-branching, extracellular, intertwining fibres measuring between 200-500 nm in length and between 20-25 nm in diameter. The study confirms the role of friction in the causation of this condition. Histochemical stains are not always successful in the detection of amyloid and electron microscopy is helpful for confirming its presence. The term frictional amyloidosis aptly describes the condition.\n\n[Recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis complicated by decompensated respiratory failure in two children].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAurÃ©gan, C; Thierry, B; Blanchard, M; ChÃ©ron, G\n\n2015-11-01\n\nLaryngeal papillomatosis is a rare, potentially severe cause of recurrent laryngeal dyspnea.

Given the transmissible characteristics of AA amyloidosis, transmission between captive cheetahs may be a possible mechanism involved in the high incidence of AA amyloidosis. In this study of animals with AA amyloidosis, we found that cheetah feces contained AA amyloid fibrils that were different from those of the liver with regard to molecular weight and shape and had greater transmissibility. The infectious activity of fecal AA amyloid fibrils was reduced or abolished by the protein denaturants 6 M guanidineÂ·HCl and formic acid or by AA immunodepletion. Thus, we propose that feces are a vehicle of transmission that may accelerate AA amyloidosis in captive cheetah populations. These results provide a pathogenesis for AA amyloidosis and suggest possible measures for rescuing cheetahs from extinction.

The esophageal involvement in amyloidosis has been reported to vary from 13% in a radiology study to 22% in an autopsy series; however, such patients have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Dysphagia is an uncommon presentation of amyloidosis. We report a 64-year-old patient who presented with progressive dysphagia of 4 months duration which was confirmed to be due to primary amyloidosis with multiple myeloma.

The aim of this study was to report a case of primary amyloidosis with renal failure, diagnosed in Hospital SÃ£o JoÃ£o, Porto, Portugal, focusing on the diagnostic difficulties and presenting a literature review. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department of the hospital with a condition of anasarca and nephrotic syndrome. After performing a renal biopsy that tested positive using Congo red and immunohistochemistry, lambda light chain amyloidosis was diagnosed. This evolved into terminal renal disease, which led to hemodialysis and several episodes of urinary and catheter infections. He was started on chemotherapy, consisting of bortezomib 0.7 mg/mÂ² and dexamethasone 40 mg in six cycles. This led to clinical improvement, stabilization of the illness and good tolerance of the treatment. CONCLUSION: Amyloidosis is a rare entity that is difficult to diagnose. This is because of the unspecific early clinical manifestations of the disease. The hypothesis of amyloidosis is only considered when specific organ failure occurs. This case consisted of primary amyloidosis with involvement of the kidneys as an initial presentation of the disease and its difficulties were shown, going from the clinical approach to the final diagnosis.\n\nRevisiting renal amyloidosis with clinicopathological characteristics, grading, and scoring: A single-institutional experience.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKalle, Abhiram; Gudipati, Archana; Raju, Sree Bhushan; Kalidindi, Karthik; Guditi, Swarnalatha; Taduri, Gangadhar; Uppin, Megha S\n\n2018-01-01\n\nKidney involvement is a major cause of mortality in systemic amyloidosis. Glomerulus is the most common site of deposition in renal amyloidosis, and nephrotic syndrome is the most common presentation. Distinction between AA and AL is done using immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Renal biopsy helps in diagnosis and also predicting the clinical course by applying scoring and grading to the biopsy findings. The study includes all cases of biopsy-proven renal amyloidosis from January 2008 to May 2017. Light microscopic analysis; Congo red with polarization; IF; IHC for Amyloid A, kappa, and lambda; and bone marrow evaluation were done. Classification of glomerular amyloid deposition and scoring and grading are done as per the guidelines of Sen S et al . There are 40 cases of biopsy-proven renal amyloidosis with 12 primary and 23 secondary cases. Mean age at presentation was 42.5 years. Edema was the most common presenting feature. Secondary amyloidosis cases were predominant. Tuberculosis was the most common secondary cause. Multiple myeloma was detected in four primary cases. Grading of renal biopsy features showed a good correlation with the class of glomerular involvement. Clinical history, IF, and IHC are essential in amyloid typing. Grading helps provide a subtle guide regarding the severity of disease in the background of a wide range of morphological features and biochemical values. Typing of amyloid is also essential for choosing the appropriate treatment.\n\nThe Prevalence and Management of Systemic Amyloidosis in Western Countries.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNienhuis, Hans L A; Bijzet, Johan; Hazenberg, Bouke P C\n\n2016-04-01\n\nAmyloidosis has been a mystery for centuries, but research of the last decennia has clarified many of the secrets of this group of diseases. A protein-based classification of amyloidosis helps to understand problems that were part of the obsolete clinical classification in primary, secondary, and familial amyloidosis. All types of amyloid are secondary to some underlying precursor-producing process: each type is caused by a misfolded soluble precursor protein that becomes deposited as insoluble amyloid fibrils. The incidence of amyloidosis is not well documented, but probably falls between 5 and 13 per million per year. Prevalence data are scarce, but one UK study indicates about 20 per million inhabitants. Amyloidosis can be localized (amyloid deposited in the organ or tissue of precursor production) or systemic (amyloid at one or more sites distant from the site of precursor production). The major systemic types of amyloidosis are AL (associated with a light chain-producing plasma cell dyscrasia), AA (associated with longstanding inflammation), wild-type ATTR (associated with normal transthyretin and old age), and hereditary ATTR (associated with a transthyretin mutation) amyloidosis. Imaging techniques, such as cardiac ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, bone scintigraphy, and serum amyloid P component scintigraphy, are useful both for diagnosing amyloidosis and for assessing disease severity. Serologic markers are useful for detecting organ disease and disease monitoring during follow-up. Current treatment modalities are directed against the ongoing supply of precursor proteins and thereby aim to stop further accumulation of amyloid. Novel treatment modalities, such as interference with amyloid formation and even removal of amyloid, are being studied. A well-thought and planned monitoring during follow-up helps to assess the effect of treatment and to early detect possible progression of amyloidosis.

Amyloidosis is extracellular precipitation of eosinophilic hyaline material of self-origin with special staining features and fibrillar ultrastructure. Macular amyloidosis is limited to the skin, and several factors have been proposed for its pathogenesis. Detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV DNA in this lesion suggests that this virus can play a role in pathogenesis of this disease. Objective. EBV DNA detection was done on 30 skin samples with a diagnosis of macular amyloidosis and 31 healthy skin samples in the margin of removed melanocytic nevi by using PCR. Results. In patients positive for beta-globin gene in PCR, BLLF1 gene of EBV virus was positive in 23 patients (8 patients in case and 15 patients in the control group.

Here, we present a 13-year-old boy with sickle cell anemia (SCA) (HbSS) who was referred to our unit with nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy revealed AA type amyloidosis on the basis of light microscopic findings, indicating Congo red staining and immunohistochemistry. He had neither a family history of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) nor any complaint of recurrent abdominal pain, arthritis, and fever, but frequent painful vaso-occlusive crises. The patient was found to have no MEFV gene (Mediterranean feVer) mutations either. Painful episodic attacks might provoke recurrent acute inflammation, leading to repeated stimulation of acute phase responses and cause secondary amyloidosis. To our knowledge, this boy is the first case of SCA complicated by renal amyloidosis observed in childhood.\n\nLGE Provides Incremental Prognostic Information OverÂ Serum Biomarkers in ALÂ CardiacÂ Amyloidosis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBoynton, Samuel J; Geske, Jeffrey B; Dispenzieri, Angela; Syed, Imran S; Hanson, Theodore J; Grogan, Martha; Araoz, Philip A\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThis study sought to determine the prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in amyloid light chain (AL) cardiac amyloidosis. Cardiac involvement is the major determinant of mortality in AL amyloidosis. CMR LGE is a marker of amyloid infiltration of the myocardium. The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the prognostic value of CMR LGE for determining all-cause mortality in AL amyloidosis and to compare the prognostic power with the biomarker stage. Seventy-six patients with histologically proven AL amyloidosis underwent CMR LGE imaging. LGE was categorized as global, focal patchy, or none. Global LGE was considered present if it was visualized on LGE images or if the myocardium nulled before the blood pool on a cine multiple inversion time (TI) sequence. CMR morphologic and functional evaluation, echocardiographic diastolic evaluation, and cardiac biomarker staging were also performed. Subjects' charts were reviewed for all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. There were 40 deaths, and the median study follow-up period was 34.4 months. Global LGE was associated with all-cause mortality in univariate analysis (hazard ratioÂ = 2.93; pÂ < 0.001). In multivariate modeling with biomarker stage, global LGE remained prognostic (hazard ratioÂ = 2.43; pÂ = 0.01). Diffuse LGE provides incremental prognosis over cardiac biomarker stage in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis. Copyright Â© 2016 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

The association of primary systemic amyloidosis with tuberculosis is very rare. There is only one case thus far reported in literature. We report such a rare case of primary amyloidosis with tuberculous lymphadenopathy. A 45 year old woman presented at the medicine department of all India institute of medical sciences , New Delhi with on & off erythematous rashes over both eyes for 1 year; low grade fever, fatigue and significant weight loss for 4 months, dysphagia for solid food since 1 month. Main finding on examination were pallor, macroglossia, bilateral periorbital erythematous rashes (racoon eyes, hepatomegaly & cardiomegaly. She had raised serum alkaline phosphatase level. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly. USG abdomen revealed multiple retroperitoneal mesenteric lymph nodes and hepatomegaly. USG guided FNAC from mesenteric lymph node showed acid fast bacillus. Histological examination of liver biopsy showed amyloid deposition on congo red stain.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of symptomatic amyloidosis AA in patients with spondyloarthropathy. Retrospective study (1984-2013). We reviewed the medical records of patients with spondyloarthropathy who had a histological diagnosis of amyloidosis AA (15 patients). We identified 1.125 patients with spondyloarthropathies. Fifteen (1.3%) patients with amyloidosis AA were recruited. It was suspected in 14 patients (93.3%) because of nephrotic syndrome in most of them: 14 were symptomatic (93.3%): 5 (33.3%) ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 5 (33.3%) spondylitis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), 4 (26.7%) psoriatic arthritis, and one (6.7%) reactive arthritis. The mean disease duration was 23.9 years. Mortality after one and 5 years of follow-up was 30 and 50% respectively. The frequency of clinical amyloidosis AA in our patients was 1.3%. There was a marked male predominance, with AS or IBD. Clinical amyloidosis was diagnosed at a relatively late stage in spondyloarthropathy. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

CT scans of twelve patients with laryngeal tuberculosis were reviewed and compared with those of fifteen patients with laryngeal cancer, retrospectively. Clinical symptoms, laryngoscopic examinations and the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis chest radiographs were also reviewed. In laryngeal tuberculosis, bilateral symmetric or asymmetric involvement was noted in nine(75%) patients, while unilateral involvement was seen in three(25%). This was significantly different from laryngeal cancer in which unilateral involvement was noted in twelve patients(80%). Diffuse thickening of the free margin of the epiglottis was a characteristic and frequent finding in tuberculosis(n=6, 50%). No deep submucosal infiltration of preepiglottic and paralaryngeal fat spaces is seen in tuberculosis in spite of large areas of involvement of laryngeal mucosa, while twelve patients(80%) with laryngeal cancer showed thickened deep infiltration which resulted in a submucosal mass. CT was useful in the diagnosis of laryngeal tuberculosis and its CT findings were characterized by bilateral involvement, thickening of the free margin of the epiglottis and good preservation of preepiglottic and paralaryngeal fat spaces in spite of large areas of involvement\n\nObesity is a significant susceptibility factor for idiopathic AA amyloidosis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBlank, Norbert; Hegenbart, Ute; Dietrich, Sascha; Brune, Maik; Beimler, JÃ¶rg; RÃ¶cken, Christoph; MÃ¼ller-Tidow, Carsten; Lorenz, Hanns-Martin; SchÃ¶nland, Stefan O\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTo investigate obesity as susceptibility factor in patients with idiopathic AA amyloidosis. Clinical, biochemical and genetic data were obtained from 146 patients with AA amyloidosis. Control groups comprised 40 patients with long-standing inflammatory diseases without AA amyloidosis and 56 controls without any inflammatory disease. Patients with AA amyloidosis had either familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) or long-standing rheumatic diseases as underlying inflammatory disease (nâ=â111, median age 46Â years). However, in a significant proportion of patients with AA amyloidosis no primary disease was identified (idiopathic AA; nâ=â37, median age 60Â years). Patients with idiopathic AA amyloidosis were more obese and older than patients with AA amyloidosis secondary to FMF or rheumatic diseases. Serum leptin levels correlated with the body mass index (BMI) in all types of AA amyloidosis. Elevated leptin levels of more than 30âÂµg/l were detected in 18% of FMF/rheumaticâ+âAA amyloidosis and in 40% of patients with idiopathic AA amyloidosis (pâ=â.018). Finally, the SAA1 polymorphism was confirmed as a susceptibility factor for AA amyloidosis irrespective of the type of the disease. Obesity, age and the SAA1 polymorphism are susceptibility factors for idiopathic AA amyloidosis. Recent advances in treatment of FMF and rheumatic disorders will decrease the incidence of AA amyloidosis due to these diseases. Idiopathic AA, however, might be an emerging problem in the ageing and increasingly obese population.\n\nAn Incidental Finding of AL-associated Amyloidosis Presenting as Gastric Ulcers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNadia Huq\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Gastrointestinal tract amyloidosis has been reported in rare instances and related symptoms are usually nonspecific to the disease process.

It is unknown if the query amyloid late enhancement (QALE) score in light-chain (AL) amyloidosis could provide increased prognostic value compared with LGE pattern.MethodsâandâResults:Seventy-eight consecutive patients with AL amyloidosis underwent contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with cardiac involvement were grouped by LGE pattern and analyzed using QALE score. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify the optimal cut-off for QALE score in predicting all-cause mortality. Survival of these patients was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression. During a median follow-up of 34 months, 53 of 78 patients died. The optimal cut-off for QALE score to predict mortality at 12-month follow-up was 9.0. On multivariate Cox analysis, QALE score â¥9 (HR, 5.997; 95% CI: 2.665-13.497; Pvalue in AL cardiac amyloidosis.

Various types and clinical forms of amyloidosis, in which the pathology and pathogenesis is diverse depending upon the underlying causes and species affected, are reported in domestic and wild animals. The clinical findings are also quite variable consequent to the variation of the tissues and organs involved and the extent of functional disruption of the affected organs in various animal species. The affected organs may be enlarged and exhibit variable pallor grossly, or the amyloid deposit may be discernible only after microscopic examination of the affected tissues. Amyloid appears as a pale eosinophilic homogenous extracellular deposit in tissues. However, microscopic examination and Congo red staining with green birefringence under polarized light are needed to confirm amyloid and differentiate it from other apparently similar extracellular deposits such as collagen and fibrin. Identifying the type of amyloid deposit needs immunohistochemical staining, ultrastructural characterization of the amyloid fibril, and if feasible also genetic studies of the involved species for clinical and prognostic purposes. This paper provides a concise review of the occurrence of amyloidosis in domestic and wild animals.\n\nLongitudinal study of experimental induction of AA amyloidosis in mice seeded with homologous and heterologous AA fibrils.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMuhammad, Naeem; Murakami, Tomoaki; Inoshima, Yasuo; Ishiguro, Naotaka\n\n2016-09-01\n\nTo investigate pathogenesis and kinetics of experimentally induced murine AA amyloidosis seeded with homologous (murine) and heterologous (bovine) AA fibrils. Experimental AA amyloidosis was induced by administration of inflammatory stimulus and preformed AA fibrils to a total of 111 female C57/Black mice. In this longitudinal study, heterologous (bovine) as well as homologous (murine) AA fibrils were injected intraperitoneally to mice in various combinations. Re-stimulation was done at 120 or 300Â days post first inoculation. To analyze the intensity of amyloid depositions in mice organs,Â immunohistochemical techniques and image J software were used. Assessment of cytokines level in sera was done using a Mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine CBA Kit. Incidence and severity of AA amyloidosis were quite low in mice inoculated with heterologous bovine AA fibrils than homologous murine one. Homologous AA fibrils administration at first and second inoculation caused maximum amount of amyloid depositions and severe systemic form of amyloidosis. Increase in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was observed after first inoculation, while second inoculation caused a further increase in the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. AA amyloidosis can be induced by heterologous as well as homologous AA fibrils. Severity of AA amyloidosis induced with homologous AA fibrils is higher compared to heterologous AA fibrils.\n\nHereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis in Eight Chinese Families\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLing-Chao Meng\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Mutations of transthyretin (TTR cause the most common type of autosomal-dominant hereditary systemic amyloidosis, which occurs worldwide. To date, more and more mutations in the TTR gene have been reported. Some variations in the clinical presentation are often observed in patients with the same mutation or the patients in the same family. The purpose of this study was to find out the clinicopathologic and genetic features of Chinese patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis. Methods: Clinical and necessary examination materials were collected from nine patients of eight families with hereditary TTR amyloidosis at Peking University First Hospital from January 2007 to November 2014. Sural nerve biopsies were taken for eight patients and skin biopsies were taken in the calf/upper arm for two patients, for light and electron microscopy examination. The TTR genes from the nine patients were analyzed. Results: The onset age varied from 23 to 68 years. The main manifestations were paresthesia, proximal and/or distal weakness, autonomic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, vitreous opacity, hearing loss, and glossohypertrophia. Nerve biopsy demonstrated severe loss of myelinated fibers in seven cases and amyloid deposits in three. One patient had skin amyloid deposits which were revealed from electron microscopic examination. Genetic analysis showed six kinds of mutations of TTR gene, including Val30Met, Phe33Leu, Ala36Pro, Val30Ala, Phe33Val, and Glu42Gly in exon 2. Conclusions: Since the pathological examinations of sural nerve were negative for amyloid deposition in most patients, the screening for TTR mutations should be performed in all the adult patients, who are clinically suspected with hereditary TTR amyloidosis.\n\nSilicone stent placement for primary tracheal amyloidosis accompanied by cartilage destruction.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRyu, Duck Hyun; Eom, Jung Seop; Jeong, Ho Jung; Kim, Jung Hoon; Lee, Ji Eun; Jun, Ji Eun; Song, Dae Hyun; Han, Joungho; Kim, Hojoong\n\n2014-06-01\n\nPrimary tracheal amyloidosis (PTA) can lead to airway obstructions, and patients with severe PTA should undergo bronchoscopic interventions in order to maintain airway patency. Focal airway involvements with amyloidosis can only be treated with mechanical dilatation. However, the PTA with diffused airway involvements and concomitant cartilage destructions requires stent placement. Limited information regarding the usefulness of silicone stents in patients with PTA has been released. Therefore, we report a case of diffused PTA with tracheomalacia causing severe cartilage destruction, which is being successfully managed with bronchoscopic interventions and silicone stent placements.\n\nClinical outcomes and survival in AA amyloidosis patients\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYavuz Ayar\n\na large proportion of cases and increased number of patients with idiopathic amyloid A amyloidosis.

There is no consensus regarding the muscles and the doses to inject. The aim of this study is to present a retrospective review of patients treated in our ENT Department by BT-A injection in this indication. This study is a retrospective study describing patients who underwent an injection of botulinum toxin for laryngeal dyspnea in the ENT Department from 2005 to 2015Â years. The inclusion criteria were a dyspnea associated with a laryngeal dysfunction, confirmed by flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy. Information concerning the causes of the dyspnea, the botulinum toxin BT-A injections procedure, post-injection follow-up, and respiratory outcome were collected for all patients included. In the group of 13 patients included, the main cause identified as principal factor linked with the short breath was: a bilateral VF paralysis (Patel et al., Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 130:686-689, 7), laryngeal dystonia (Balkissoon and Kenn, Semin Respir Crit Care Med 33:595-605, 2), Anxiety syndrome associated with unilateral vocal fold paralysis or asthma (Marcinow et al., Laryngoscope 124:1425-1430, 3), and an isolated asthma (Zwirner et al., Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol 254:242-245, 1). Nine out of the thirteen patients were improved by the injections. A BT-A-induced stable benefit for four patients led them to stop the injections in the follow-up. Good outcome was observed in five other patients (main cause: bilateral VP paralysis), allowing a progressive lengthening of the delay between BT-A injections. Four patients did not report a positive risk/benefit ratio after BT-A injections; two of them (with bilateral VF paralysis), because of respiratory side effects and\n\nQuantitative PCR Analysis of Laryngeal Muscle Fiber Types\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVan Daele, Douglas J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nVoice and swallowing dysfunction as a result of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis can be improved with vocal fold injections or laryngeal framework surgery.

We document a male patient who developed reactive amyloidosis (AA type, most likely secondary to his long standing periodontitis. Case presentation A 67-year-old Turkish man complained of pain in his oral cavity (burning mouth especially on the tongue, and had difficulty chewing and swallowing foods. A careful dental/periodontal examination was performed, including assessment of plaque, gingival condition and periodontal probing depths on all his remaining teeth. Prosthetic rehabilitation was provided three months after the completion of his periodontal and surgical therapy. The concentration of serum inflammatory markers including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count, fibrinogen and high sensitive C-reactive protein were measured at baseline, at the second and sixth weeks, and at three and six months after the periodontal and surgical therapy. Conclusions Oral examination revealed a few papules on the dorsum of the tongue with two slightly painful, small ulcers, localized on the vestibule of the mouth. The mean probing depth was 9.10 Â± 0.84 mm. Biopsies of the tongue, buccal mucosa and retromolar trigone were performed and amyloid deposits were found. The serum inflammatory markers improved more dramatically at the second week of periodontal therapy than any other time intervals. Amyloidosis may manifest as periodontal destruction that leads to severe chronic periodontitis. Proper periodontal treatment may alleviate systemic inflammatory mediators caused by the amyloidosis.\n\nFailed tracheal intubation using a laryngoscope and intubating laryngeal mask.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAsai, T; Hirose, T; Shingu, K\n\n2000-04-01\n\nTo report unexpected failed tracheal intubation using a laryngoscope and an intubating laryngeal mask, and difficult ventilation via a facemask, laryngeal mask and intubating laryngeal mask, in a patient with an unrecognized lingual tonsillar hypertrophy. A 63-yr-old woman, who had undergone clipping of an aneurysm seven weeks previously, was scheduled for ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. At the previous surgery, there had been no difficulty in ventilation or in tracheal intubation. Her trachea remained intubated nasally for 11 days after surgery. Preoperatively, her consciousness was impaired. There were no restrictions in head and neck movements or mouth opening. The thyromental distance was 7 cm. After induction of anesthesia, manual ventilation via a facemask with a Guedel airway was suboptimal and the chest expanded insufficiently. At laryngoscopy using a Macintosh or McCoy device, only the tip of the epiglottis, but not the glottis, could be seen, and tracheal intubation failed. There was a partial obstruction during manual ventilation through either the intubating laryngeal mask or conventional laryngeal mask; intubation through each device failed. Digital examination of the pharynx, after removal of the laryngeal mask, indicated a mass occupying the vallecula. Lingual tonsillar hypertrophy (1 x 1 x 2 cm) was found to be the cause of the failure. Awake fibrescope-aided tracheal intubation was accomplished. Unexpected lingual tonsillar hypertrophy can cause both ventilation and tracheal intubation difficult, and neither the laryngeal mask nor intubating laryngeal mask may be helpful in the circumstances.\n\n[Value of aspiration biopsy of subcutaneous fat in amyloidosis].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPonce, P; Carvalho, F; Coelho, A\n\n1986-01-01\n\nFine-needle aspiration of subcutaneous fat (FNAF) was performed in 24 patients, 12 with previously diagnosed amyloidosis presenting with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome, and 12 presenting a nephrotic syndrome without amyloidosis on renal biopsy. FNAF was positive in 10 of 12 patients with amyloidosis (sensitivity: 83%) and negative in 12 of 12 patients with non-amyloid nephrotic syndrome (specificity: 100%). Considering a 2.5 to 10% prevalence of amyloidosis in adult patients with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome, a positive FNAF is diagnostic of amyloidosis, and a negative FNAF rules out the diagnosis with a probability of 98 to 99%. FNAF is a simple and safe method which can be useful in patients who cannot undergo a renal biopsy.\n\nDrawing attention to a neglected injecting-related harm: a systematic review of AA amyloidosis among people who inject drugs.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHarris, Magdalena; Brathwaite, Rachel; Scott, Jenny; Gilchrist, Gail; Ciccarone, Dan; Hope, Vivian; McGowan, Catherine R\n\n2018-04-26\n\nChronic skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) among people who inject drugs (PWID) can lead to AA amyloidosis: a serious, yet neglected, multi-organ disease. We aim to synthesize findings on the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical outcomes, screening recommendations and challenges to treatment for AA amyloidosis among PWID. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched the following bibliographic databases in July 2017: CINAHL Plus, Embase, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO and SCOPUS. Studies were included if they investigated AA amyloidosis in PWID. Studies were not restricted to location, study type, year or language of publication. Study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis; we present a narrative review of the literature. Thirty-seven papers from eight countries met inclusion criteria. A total of 781 PWID are reported on, of whom 177 had AA amyloidosis. Where disease causality is established, it is attributed to chronic inflammation caused by injecting-related SSTIs. Most (88.7%) PWID with AA amyloidosis had SSTIs. The proportion of PWID with AA amyloidosis at post-mortem ranged from 1.6% (Germany) to 22.5% (Serbia). Biopsy studies reported from 5.26% (Portugal) to 50% (Germany) of AA amyloidosis in PWID with suspected or known kidney disease. Following diagnosis, the typical trajectory for PWID with AA amyloidosis was rapid deterioration of renal function requiring haemodialysis. Treatment difficulties, end-stage renal failure and premature death from sepsis were observed. Good outcomes, including reversibility of AA amyloidosis, are attributed to rapid treatment of the underlining inflammation and injecting cessation. Notably, given the population in question, no studies were published in addiction or harm reduction journals; most (92%) appeared in specialist nephrology and medical journals.

She had a past history of systemic lupus erythematosus, which was in remission for three years. There had been no lesions of lupus erythematosus in this area. Clinically, the lesions were skin-coloured, firm papules and our differential diagnoses included trichoepithelioma, papular sarcoid or lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei. Skin biopsy from one of the lesions showed amyloid deposits in the dermis which were Congo red stain positive. These deposits also showed apple green birefringence. Immunohistochemical staining of the amyloid deposits stained positive for cytokeratins (CK) 5 and 6, and negative for CK 14. The kappa and lambda stains were equivocal. Further investigations, including multiple myeloma screen and rectal biopsy, ruled out systemic amyloidosis. There was no other evidence of cutaneous amyloidosis on her limbs or trunk. She refused treatment for her lesions. This case highlights the commonly-seen form of primary localised cutaneous amyloidosis in an unusual location.\n\nDoes subepithelial hemorrhage cause persistence of laryngeal granuloma?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYumoto, Eiji; Sanuki, Tetsuji; Miyamaru, Satoru; Kumai, Yoshihiko\n\n2008-05-01\n\nTo determine the incidence of black spots after resolution of laryngeal granuloma (LG), to compare the disease duration from the beginning of treatment to resolution between patients with and without black spots, and to assess the histologic findings of LG in resected or biopsied specimens. Retrospective. Forty-six patients with LG on the cartilaginous portion of the vocal fold were included. Their clinical records were reviewe"
