        "text": "In the present work we have developed an agent-based model of the interaction between the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas and the macrophages of the innate immune system in a mouse. The aim is to simulate the processes of proliferation and apoptosis of the beta cells and the phagocytosis of cell debris by macrophages. We have used data from the literature to make the model architecture and to define and set up the input variables. This model obtains good approximations to the real processes modeled and could be used to shed light on some open questions about phagocytosis, wave of apoptosis in the young mice, growing of the beta cell mass and processes that could induce the immune response against beta cells related to type 1 diabetes.\n\nElementary Flux Modes (EFMs) have been claimed as one of the most promising approaches for pathway analysis. These are a set of vectors that emerge from the stoichiometric matrix of a biochemical network through the use of convex analysis. The computation of all EFMs of a given network is an NP-hard problem and existing algorithms do not scale well. Moreover, the analysis of results is difficult given the thousands or millions of possible modes generated. In this work, we propose a new plugin, running on top of the OptFlux Metabolic Engineering workbench, whose aims are to ease the analysis of these results and explore synergies among EFM analysis, phenotype simulation and strain optimization.\n\nThere are subsets of genes that have similar behavior under subsets of conditions, so we say that they coexpress, but behave independently under other subsets of conditions. Discovering such coexpressions can be helpful to uncover genomic knowledge such as gene networks or gene interactions. That is why, it is of utmost importance to make a simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions to identify clusters of genes that are coexpressed under clusters of conditions. This type of clustering is called biclustering. Biclustering is an NP-hard problem. Consequently, heuristic algorithms are typically used to approximate this problem by finding suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we make a new survey on clustering and biclustering of gene expression data, also called microarray data."
