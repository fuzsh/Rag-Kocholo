        "text": "Herpes Simplex Encephalitis Complicated by Cerebral Hemorrhage during Acyclovir Therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarada, Yukinori; Hara, Yuuta\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHerpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) can be complicated by adverse events in the acute phase. We herein present the case of a 71-year-old woman with HSE complicated by cerebral hemorrhage. She presented with acute deterioration of consciousness and fever and was diagnosed with HSE based on the detection of herpes simplex virus-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid by a polymerase chain reaction. The cerebral hemorrhage developed during acyclovir therapy; however, its diagnosis was delayed for 2 days. After the conservative treatment of the cerebral hemorrhage, the patient made a near-complete recovery. Cerebral hemorrhage should be considered as an acute-phase complication of HSE.\n\nGroup A beta-hemolytic streptococcal hemorrhagic colitis complicated with pharyngitis and impetigo.\n\nPubMed\n\nIsozaki, Atsushi; Matsubara, Keiko; Yui, Takako; Kobayashi, Kenji; Kawano, Yutaka\n\n2007-12-01\n\nA 6-year-old boy with bloody diarrhea was diagnosed with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal hemorrhagic colitis. Complications included pharyngitis and impetigo, both caused by the same organisms. In addition to being isolated from stools, Streptococcus pyogenes was also isolated from skin lesions. Furthermore, a rapid group A streptococcal antigen test by throat swab was also positive. Hemorrhagic colitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is extremely rare, and much rarer are its complications with pharyngitis and impetigo. Compared with findings in reports of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal proctitis and perianal and perineal diseases, this case suggests a distinct pathogenesis for hemorrhagic colitis.\n\n[Application of antihelicobacter therapy in patients, suffering pyloroduodenal zone ulcers, complicated by hemorrhage].\n\nPubMed\n\nIaroshenko, K O\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThere were examined 113 patients, suffering pyloroduodenal zone ulcers, complicated by an acute hemorrhage. H. pylori was revealed in 108 (96%) patients. To escape a false-negative results a serological method was applied, which was used to determine a content of IgG antibodies to H. pylori with the help of diagnostic panel GastroPanel (Biohit PLc firm, Finland). The H. pylori presence in patients must be considered as a risk factor for the early recurrent hemorrhage occurrence. A timely conducted examination, determination of H. pylori and timely prescription of antihelicobacter therapy promote the improvement of the treatment results in patients, suffering gastroduodenal ulcers, complicated by an acute hemorrhage due to reduction of the occurrence rate of early recurrence of hemorrhage.\n\nA new identified complication of intracystic hemorrhage in a large pineal gland cyst.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehrzad, Raman; Mishra, Suprav; Feinstein, Alexander; Ho, Michael G\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPineal gland cysts are typically asymptomatic, benign cysts most commonly found incidentally in adults. In rare cases, a large pineal gland cyst can be complicated by intracystic hemorrhage, which could then manifest with neurological symptoms. We report a new complication of intracystic hemorrhage in a large pineal gland cyst in a 40-year-old man with new onset seizures. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sixty years after cerebral vasospasm was first described, this problem remains unsolved in spite of its highly adverse effect on prognosis after aneurysmatic rupture. Treatment is somewhat empirical, given that uncertainties remain in our understanding of the pathophysiology of this vascular complication, which involves structural and biochemical changes in the endothelium and smooth muscle of vessels. Vasospasm that is refractory to treatment leads to cerebral infarction. Prophylaxis, early diagnosis, and adequate treatment of neurologic complications are key elements in the management of vasospasm if neurologic damage, lengthy hospital stays, and increased use of health care resources are to be avoided. New approaches to early treatment of cerebral lesions and cortical ischemia in cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to aneurysm rupture should lead to more effective, specific management.\n\nHemorrhagic Complications of Percutaneous Cryoablation for Renal Tumors: Results from a 7-year Prospective Study\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKakarala, Bharat, E-mail: bkakara1@jhmi.edu, E-mail: bharat.kakarala@gmail.com; Frangakis, Constantine E., E-mail: cfrangak@jhsph.edu; Rodriguez, Ron, E-mail: rodriguezr32@uthscsa.edu\n\nPurposeCryoablation of renal tumors is assumed to have a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications compared to other ablative modalities. Our purpose was to establish the exact risk and to identify hemorrhagic risk factors.Materials and MethodsThis IRB approved, 7-year prospective study included 261 renal cryoablations. Procedures were under conscious sedation and CT guidance. Pre- and postablation CT was obtained, and hemorrhagic complications were CTCAE tabulated. Age, gender, tumor size, histology, and probes number were tested based on averages or proportions using their exact permutation distribution. âHigh-riskâ subgroups (those exceeding the thresholds of all variables) were tested for each variable alone, andmoreÂ Â» for all combinations of variable threshold values. We compared the subgroup with the best PPV using one variable, with the subgroup with the best PPV using all variables (McNemmar test).ResultsThe hemorrhagic complication rate was 3.5Â %. Four patients required transfusions, two required emergent angiograms, one required both a transfusion and angiogram, and two required bladder irrigation for outlet obstruction. Perirenal space hemorrhage was more clinically significant than elsewhere. Univariate risks were tumor size >2Â cm, number of probes >2, and malignant histology (PÂ =Â 0.005, 0.002, and 0.033, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that patients >55Â years with malignant tumors >2Â cm requiring 2 or more probes yielded the highest PPV (7.5Â %).ConclusionsAlthough older patients (>55Â years old) with larger (>2Â cm), malignant tumors have an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications, the low PPV does not support the routine use of embolization. Percutaneous cryoablation has a 3.5Â % risk of significant hemorrhage, similar to that reported for other types of renal ablative modalities.Â«Â less\n\nSevere bleeding complications other than intracranial hemorrhage in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia: a case series and review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinkelhorst, Dian; Kamphuis, Marije M; de Kloet, Liselotte C; Zwaginga, Jaap Jan; Oepkes, Dick; Lopriore, Enrico\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe most feared bleeding complication in fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). However, FNAIT may also lead to other severe bleeding problems. The aim was to analyze this spectrum and evaluate the occurrence of severe hemorrhages other than ICH in fetuses or neonates with FNAIT. A retrospective chart analysis of cases of FNAIT presenting with severe bleeding complications other than ICH at our institution from 1990 to 2015 was conducted. Additionally, a review of the literature was performed to identify case reports and case series on FNAIT presenting with extracranial hemorrhage. Of 25 fetuses or neonates with severe bleeding due to FNAIT, three had isolated severe internal organ hemorrhage other than ICH, two pulmonary hemorrhages and one gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Two of these three neonates died due to this bleeding. Eighteen cases of extracranial bleeding complications as a first presentation of FNAIT were found in the literature, including ocular, gastrointestinal, spinal cord, pulmonary, renal, subgaleal, and genitourinary hemorrhages. Bleeding complications other than ICH may be more extensive, and the presentation of FNAIT may have a greater spectrum than previously described. A high index of suspicion on the possible diagnosis of FNAIT with any bleeding complication in a fetus or neonate may enable adequate diagnostics, adequate treatment, and appropriate follow-up in future pregnancies, as is especially relevant for FNAIT.

However, delayed tPA treatment increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage and can result in exacerbation of nerve injury. ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving protease, has a protective effect against ischemic brain injury and may reduce bleeding risk by cleaving VWF. We examined whether ADAMTS13 has a longer therapeutic time window in ischemic stroke than tPA in mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ADAMTS13 (0.1mg/kg) or tPA (10mg/kg) was administered i.v., immediately after reperfusion of after 2-h or 4-h MCAO for comparison of the therapeutic time windows in ischemic stroke. Infarct volume, hemorrhagic volume, plasma high-mobility group box1 (HMGB1) levels and cerebral blood flow were measured 24h after MCAO. Both ADAMTS13 and tPA improved the infarct volume without hemorrhagic complications in 2-h MCAO mice. On the other hand, ADAMTS13 reduced the infarct volume and plasma HMGB1 levels, and improved cerebral blood flow without hemorrhagic complications in 4-h MCAO mice, but tPA was not effective and these animals showed massive intracerebral hemorrhage. These results indicated that ADAMTS13 has a longer therapeutic time window in ischemic stroke than tPA, and ADAMTS13 may be useful as a new therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke.

The incidence of pancreatitis is even higher in patients undergoing heart transplantation than in those undergoing other cardiac surgeries. Nevertheless, the clinical presentations of pancreatitis are frequently atypical in these patients. We report a heart recipient who was complicated with acute right heart failure initially after orthotopic heart transplantation and developed devastating unanticipated hemorrhagic pancreatitis 1 month after the transplantation. This crypto-symptomatic pancreatitis was not diagnosed until massive internal bleeding and hemorrhagic shock occurred, because the typical presentations of acute pancreatitis were masked by the intra-abdominal manifestations caused by right heart failure and congestive liver dysfunction. The patient underwent a successful transarterial embolization. The causes of pancreatitis after heart transplantation include low cardiac output, immunosuppressant use and cytomegalovirus infection. The typical symptoms of pancreatitis might be not apparent in patients after heart transplantation because of their immunosuppressive status. Furthermore, in patients complicated with right heart failure after transplantation, the manifestation of pancreatitis could be even more obscure. The prompt diagnosis is highly depended on the clinician's astuteness.\n\nEndovascular interventions for traumatic portal venous hemorrhage complicated by portal hypertension\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSundarakumar, Dinesh Kumar; Smith, Crysela Mirta; Lopera, Jorge Enrique; Kogut, Matthew; Suri, Rajeev\n\n2013-01-01\n\nLife-threatening hemorrhage rarely occurs from the portal vein following blunt hepatic trauma. Traditionally, severe portal bleeding in this setting has been controlled by surgical techniques such as packing, ligation, and venorrhaphy. The presence of portal hypertension could potentially increase the amount of hemorrhage in the setting of blunt portal vein trauma making it more difficult to control. This case series describes the use of indirect carbon dioxide portography to identify portal hemorrhage. Furthermore, these cases illustrate attempted endovascular treatment utilizing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in one scenario and transmesocaval shunt coiling of a jejunal varix in the other.

Although nonneurologic medical complications are avoidable, they worsen the prognosis, lengthen the hospital stay, and generate additional costs. The prevention, early detection, and appropriate treatment of systemic complications will be essential for managing the individual patient's case. Treatment should cover major symptoms (headache, nausea, and dizziness) and ambient noise should be reduced, all with the aim of achieving excellence and improving the patient's perception of quality of care.\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage: a life-threatening complication of hypertension during pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDai, Xuming; Diamond, Joseph A\n\n2007-11-01\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is an infrequent but severe complication in pregnant women with hypertension. The authors describe a patient with chronic hypertension who developed superimposed preeclampsia and spontaneous ICH during the thirty-fifth week of pregnancy. ICH was diagnosed by computed tomographic scan. She underwent successful emergent cesarean section and neurosurgical decompression of the ICH. Both intraoperative surveillance and postoperative magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the cerebral vessels failed to identify an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. The authors discuss the diagnosis and management in this case and review the literature regarding this challenging complication of pregnancy and preeclampsia. Controversies regarding treatment of hypertension during pregnancy are discussed in light of the impact on the management of this patient.\n\nStent-Grafts in the Management of Hemorrhagic Complications Related to Hemostatic Closure Devices: Report of Two Cases\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGiansante Abud, Daniel; Mounayer, Charbel; Saint-Maurice, Jean Pierre\n\nWe report 2 cases of hemorrhagic complications related to use of the Angio-Seal hemostatic closure device that were successfully managed with stent-grafts. Two patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were referred to our departments for endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The treatment was performed through a femoral access; the sheaths were removed immediately after the procedures, and the punctures sites closed by Angio-Seals. Both patients presented clinical signs of hypovolemic shock after treatment. The diagnosis of active bleeding through the puncture site was made by emergency digital subtraction angiography. The lesions were managed with stent-grafts. The use of stent-grafts proved tomoreÂ Â» be efficient in the management of these life-threatening hemorrhagic complications following the use of the Angio-Seal hemostatic closure device.Â«Â less\n\nHemorrhagic iliopsoas bursitis complicating well-functioning ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Kyung Soon; Diwanji, Sanket R; Kim, Hyung Keun; Song, Eun Kyoo; Yoon, Taek Rim\n\n2009-08-01\n\nIliopsoas bursitis has been increasingly recognized as a complication of total hip arthroplasty and is usually associated with polyethylene wear. Here, the authors report a case of hemorrhagic iliopsoas bursitis complicating an otherwise well-functioning ceramic-on-ceramic arthroplasty performed by minimal invasive modified 2-incision technique. The bursitis in turn resulted in femoral nerve palsy and femoral vein compression. In this report, there was no evidence to support that the bursitis was due to an inflammatory response to ceramic wear particles or any other wear particles originating from the total hip arthroplasty.\n\nA hemorrhagic complication after Onyx embolization of a tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula: A caution about subdural extension with pial arterial supply.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Kenichi; Matsumoto, Yasushi; Endo, Hidenori; Tominaga, Teiji\n\n2017-06-01\n\nWe report a case of tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) with a severe intracranial hemorrhage occurring after Onyx embolization. A 40-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic tentorial DAVF on angiography. Transarterial embolization with Onyx was performed via the middle meningeal artery, and the cast filled the fistula itself and its proximal draining vein. Postoperative angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the DAVF. A computed tomography scan performed immediately after the procedure demonstrated an acute subdural hematoma with the temporal hemorrhage. Emergency craniotomy revealed continuous arterial bleeding from a viable glomus-like vascular structure around the proximal part of the embolized draining vein, fed by a pial artery arising from the posterior cerebral artery. Pathologic findings suggested diagnosis of vascular malformation extending into the subdural space. Tentorial DAVFs can extend to the subdural space along their drainage route, and may be involved in severe hemorrhagic complications of curative endovascular treatment using Onyx, particularly those with pial arterial supply.\n\n[Uterine necrosis after arterial embolization for postpartum hemorrhage].\n\nPubMed\n\nBelghiti, J; Tassin, M; Raiffort, C; Zappa, M; Poujade, O; Bout, H; Mandelbrot, L\n\n2014-02-01\n\nRadiologic embolization of the uterine arteries is increasingly used to treat severe postpartum hemorrhage, as an alternative to surgical procedures. Guidelines have been published in order to standardize the indications as well as the technique. An important objective was to limit severe complications such as uterine necrosis. We report a case of a uterine necrosis after arterial embolization for severe postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony on a uterus with fibroids. This complication occurred despite the use of the recommended technique. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine is a usual treatment modality utilized for the management of these patients. Aim. We present a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage following intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine for IP in a patient with sickle cell disease. We analyzed the degree of subarachnoid hemorrhage in our patient after intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine. The patient had an acute rise in blood pressure during corporal irrigation. This was followed by the onset of severe headache. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the diagnosis of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine. Result. A 23-year-old African American male with a history of sickle cell disease presented with a painful penile erection. The patient was started on intravenous fluids, oxygen by nasal canula, and analgesic medication. After this, a blood gas was obtained from his left corpora cavernosa. This was followed by normal saline irrigation and injection of phenylephrine. The patient complained of a sudden, severe \"terrible headache\" immediately following the last injection, and noncontrast CT scan of the head was obtained and a subarachnoid hemorrhage was noted. The patient was admitted for observation and no significant changes were noted. Intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine for the management of IP can be associated with several possible complications. We present our single case complicated with the formation of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient was treated conservatively and had no long-term neurologic sequelae.

Using data from the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke program (n=54 334), we evaluated differences in risk-adjusted bleeding rates (any, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [sICH], serious life-threatening [excluding sICH], or other) and mortality in white (n=40 411), black (n=8243), Hispanic (n=4257), and Asian (n=1523) patients receiving intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke. Compared with white patients, overall adjusted hemorrhagic complications after tPA were higher in black (odds ratio, 1.14, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.28) and Asian (odds ratio, 1.36, 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.61) patients. Overall adjusted bleeding complications in Hispanics were similar to those of whites. Increased risk of overall bleeding in Asians was related to higher risk of adjusted sICH (odds ratio, 1.47, 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.82), whereas in blacks, it was related to higher risk of other bleeding. No significant race-related difference was noted in risk of serious or life-threatening bleeding or in overall mortality or death in patients with sICH or any hemorrhagic complications. In patients with stroke receiving tPA, hemorrhagic complications were slightly higher in blacks and Asians, but not in Hispanics compared with whites. Asians also faced significantly higher risk for sICH relative to other race/ethnic groups. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether reduction in tPA dose similar to that used in many Asian countries could improve the safety of tPA therapy in Asians in the United States with acute ischemic strokes while maintaining efficacy.

Hemoptysis, a constant sign, lacks in specificity, and may occur in confounding syndromes such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary infarction, and pneumonia. Nonspecific symptoms and signs often delay the diagnosis, thereby allowing serious or even fatal disease progression. Here, we performed a large-scale retrospective analysis to define the incidence and risk factors of AH in the setting of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors therapy. Randomized controlled trials demonstrate that treatment with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) inhibitors may improve the outcome of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and angioplastic procedures. However, this treatment may rarely lead to severe hemorrhagic complications, in particular AH. Unfortunately, the incidence and risk factors of AH remain poorly defined. We reviewed for the period extending from August 1998 to January 2005 consecutive histories of AMI patients receiving coronary arteriography and treatment with either eptifibatide or abciximab. Concomitantly admitted AMI patients not treated with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were reviewed and served as a control group. The diagnosis of AH required the demonstration of typical symptoms and signs including dyspnea, hemoptysis, arterial hypoxemia, pulmonary radiographic changes, and, when available, bronchoscopic signs for AH. Potential covariates including pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, smoking, and use of other anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents were evaluated. Six of 1,810 patients (0.33%) receiving eptifibatide and five of 3,648 patients (0.14%) receiving abciximab exhibited typical symptoms and signs of AH. Contrarily, only one of 4,136 patients (0.025%) receiving no GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors presented with similar symptoms and signs. There was no fatal outcome, though two patients required blood transfusions. Statistically significant differences were found between control patients and\n\nTonic-Clonic Activity at Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Onset: Impact on Complications and Outcome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDe Marchis, Gian Marco; Pugin, Deborah; Lantigua, Hector; Zammit, Christopher; Tadi, Prasanna; Schmidt, J. Michael; Falo, M. Cristina; Agarwal, Sachin; Mayer, Stephan A.; Claassen, Jan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective Tonic-clonic activity (TCA) at onset complicates 3% to 21% of cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The impact of onset TCA on in-hospital complications, including seizures, remains unclear. One study associated onset TCA with poor clinical outcome at 6 weeks after SAH, but to our knowledge no other studies have confirmed this relationship. This study aims to assess the impact of onset TCA on in-hospital complications, poor functional outcome, mortality, and epilepsy at 3 months. Methods Analysis of a prospective study cohort of 1479 SAH patients admitted to Columbia University Medical Center between 1996 and 2012. TCA within 6 hours of hemorrhage onset was identified based on accounts of emergency care providers or family witnesses. Results TCA at onset was described in 170 patients (11%). Patients with onset TCA were younger (Pâ=â0.002), presented more often with poor clinical grade (55% vs. 26%, P<0.001) and had larger amounts of cisternal, intraventricular, and intracerebral blood than those without onset TCA (all, P<0.001). After adjusting for known confounders, onset TCA was significantly associated with in-hospital seizures (OR 3.80, 95%-CI: 2.43â5.96, P<0.001), in-hospital pneumonia (OR 1.56, 95%-CI: 1.06â2.31, pâ=â0.02), and delayed cerebral ischemia (OR 1.77, 95%-CI: 1.21â2.58, Pâ=â0.003). At 3 months, however, onset TCA was not associated with poor functional outcome, mortality, and epilepsy after adjusting for age, admission clinical grade, and cisternal blood volume. Conclusions Onset TCA is not a rare event as it complicates 11% of cases of SAH. New and clinically relevant findings are the association of onset TCA with in-hospital seizures, pneumonia and delayed cerebral ischemia. Despite the increased risk of in-hospital complications, onset TCA is not associated with disability, mortality, and epilepsy at 3 months.

Methods: Data were sought from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive, an international repository of clinical trials data. Using propensity score matching, we retrospectively compared patients with prior statin treatment and newly initiated statin within 3 days after AIS to patients without statin exposure. Outcomes of interest were acute symptomatic ICH (sICH), any acute ICH, postacute ICH, and mortality during follow-up of 3 months. Results: A total of 8,535 patients (mean age 70 years, 54% male, median baseline NIH Stroke Scale score 13) were analyzed. After propensity score matching, prior statin use was not strongly associated with sICH (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83â2.14) or any ICH (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.92â1.98). There was no evidence of an interaction between prior statin use and thrombolysis. New initiation of statins was not associated with postacute ICH (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.60, 95% CI 0.70â3.65). There was a signal towards lower 90-day mortality in patients with prior statin use (adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70â1.00) and especially early initiation of statins (adjusted HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46â0.97). Conclusions: Statin use prior to AIS was not associated with early hemorrhagic complications, irrespective of treatment with thrombolysis. New initiation of statin treatment early after AIS did not affect risk of postacute ICH, but might be associated with reduced mortality.

Uterine atony represents up to 80Â % of all causes of PPH. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has now a well-established role in the management of severe PPH. TAE allows stopping the bleeding in 90Â % of women with severe PHH, obviating surgery. Pledgets of gelatin sponge as torpedoes are commonly used for safe TAE, and coils, glue, and microspheres have been primarily used in specific situations such as arterial rupture, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula. TAE is a minimally invasive procedure with a low rate of complications, which preserves future fertility.moreÂ Â» Knowledge of causes of PPH, potential risks, and limitations of TAE is essential for a timely decision, optimizing TAE, preventing irreversible complications, avoiding hysterectomy, and ultimately preserving fertility.Â«Â less\n\nLaryngeal complications after type 1 thyroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nCotter, C S; Avidano, M A; Crary, M A; Cassisi, N J; Gorham, M M\n\n1995-12-01\n\nType I thyroplasty has become a primary surgical choice for voice restoration in patients with glottal incompetence. This study examines factors associated with laryngeal complications after type I thyroplasty. Ten laryngoscopic variables were analyzed from preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative videolaryngoscopies of 51 patients undergoing 58 medialization procedures. Ten patient and operative variables were examined by medical record review. Major complications were defined as wound hemorrhage, airway obstruction, or prosthesis extrusion. Minor complications were defined as vocal fold hematoma without airway obstruction or prosthesis movement. The major complication rate was 8.6%, and the minor complication rate was 29%. No delayed hemorrhage or airway obstruction occurred. Prosthesis extrusion occurred in five (8.6%) patients 1 week to 5 months after surgery. Extrusion was associated with suboptimal prosthesis placement in 80% of cases. Two patients retained excellent glottal closure despite extrusion. Vocal fold hematoma was identified in 14 (24%) cases and resolved within 1 week. Prosthesis movement occurred in three (5%) patients 1 week to 6 months after surgery and resulted in poor glottal closure. All patients with prosthesis extrusion or movement were female. Type I thyroplasty remains a safe outpatient procedure with few major complications. Prosthesis extrusion was associated with suboptimal prosthesis placement and may or may not result in poor glottal closure. Minor vocal fold hematomas were relatively frequent, resolved rapidly, and were not associated with airway obstruction. Female patients may be more prone to complications because of their small laryngeal size.\n\n[Mucosal changes in the periulcer zone and endocrine system in patients with gastroduodenal ulcer, complicated by hemorrhage].\n\nPubMed\n\nTrofimov, M V\n\n2014-07-01\n\nExamination of patients, suffering gastroduodenal ulcer, complicated by hemorrhage, was conducted, using clinical, microbiological, immunohistochemical methods and chromatomassspectrography. Enhanced activity of inducible NO-synthase, contamination of periulcer zone with microorganisms Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus beta-haemoliticus, enhancement of contents of catecholamines and serotonin in the blood serum were revealed. These changes are most expressed in severe blood loss, unstable local endoscopic hemostasis, high risk of a recurrent hemorrhage occurrence. The data obtained permit to prognosticate severity of a pathologic process course and to improve the treatment programe.\n\nIodine Extravasation Quantification on Dual-Energy CT of the Brain Performed after Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke Can Predict Hemorrhagic Complications.\n\nPubMed\n\nBonatti, M; Lombardo, F; Zamboni, G A; Vittadello, F; CurrÃ² Dossi, R; Bonetti, B; Pozzi Mucelli, R; Bonatti, G\n\n2018-01-18\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage represents a potentially severe complication of revascularization of acute ischemic stroke. The aim of our study was to assess the capability of iodine extravasation quantification on dual-energy CT performed immediately after mechanical thrombectomy to predict hemorrhagic complications. Because this was a retrospective study, the need for informed consent was waived. Eighty-five consecutive patients who underwent brain dual-energy CT immediately after mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke between August 2013 and January 2017 were included. Two radiologists independently evaluated dual-energy CT images for the presence of parenchymal hyperdensity, iodine extravasation, and hemorrhage. Maximum iodine concentration was measured. Follow-up CT examinations performed until patient discharge were reviewed for intracerebral hemorrhage development. The correlation between dual-energy CT parameters and intracerebral hemorrhage development was analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher exact test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for continuous variables. Thirteen of 85 patients (15.3%) developed hemorrhage. On postoperative dual-energy CT, parenchymal hyperdensities and iodine extravasation were present in 100% of the patients who developed intracerebral hemorrhage and in 56.3% of the patients who did not ( P = .002 for both). Signs of bleeding were present in 35.7% of the patients who developed intracerebral hemorrhage and in none of the patients who did not ( P < .001). Median maximum iodine concentration was 2.63 mg/mL in the patients who developed intracerebral hemorrhage and 1.4 mg/mL in the patients who did not ( P < .001). Maximum iodine concentration showed an area under the curve of 0.89 for identifying patients developing intracerebral hemorrhage. The presence of parenchymal hyperdensity with a maximum iodine concentration of >1.35 mg/mL may identify patients developing intracerebral hemorrhage with\n\nComplications of bladder distension during retrograde urethrography.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarsanti, J A; Crowell, W; Losonsky, J; Talkington, F D\n\n1981-05-01\n\nA severe, ulcerative cystitis that resulted in macroscopic hematuria occurred in 8 of 20 healthy dogs undergoing a series of diagnostic tests. Four of the remaining 12 dogs had mild bladder lesions consisting of submucosal edema and hemorrhage. Nine of the 20 dogs developed urinary tract infection after the procedures. These complications seemed associated with the radiographic technique of retrograde urethrography performed when the urinary bladder was distended. To test this hypothesis, retrograde urethrography was performed on 5 additional dogs. With the bladder undistended, no complications occurred. However, distention of these same dogs' bladders for 1 minute or less with sterile lactated Ringer's solution administered through a Foley catheter in the penile urethra resulted in a macroscopic hematuria in all 5 dogs which persisted for 24 hours. A microscopic hematuria continued for 5 days. One dog developed a bacterial urinary tract infection. A severe fibrinopurulent cystitis was present at necropsy of 2 dogs 2 days after distention. The morphologic changes in the bladder gradually diminished over 7 days, but mild submucosal edema and hemorrhage were still present when 2 dogs were necropsied, 7 days after distention. These studies indicated that retrograde urethrography in dogs may be complicated by hemorrhagic cystitis and urinary tract infection if performed with urinary bladder distention.\n\nExternal Ventricular Drain and Hemorrhage in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Patients on Dual Antiplatelet Therapy: A Retrospective Cohort Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHudson, Joseph S; Prout, Benjamin S; Nagahama, Yasunori; Nakagawa, Daichi; Guerrero, Waldo R; Zanaty, Mario; Chalouhi, Nohra; Jabbour, Pascal; Dandapat, Sudeepta; Allan, Lauren; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Samaniego, Edgar A; Hasan, David\n\n2018-04-11\n\nStenting and flow diversion for aneurysmal sub arachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) require the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). To investigate whether DAPT is associated with hemorrhagic complication following placement of external ventricular drains (EVD) in patients with aSAH. Rates of radiographically identified hemorrhage associated with EVD placement were compared between patients who received DAPT for stenting or flow diversion, and patients who underwent microsurgical clipping or coiling and did not receive DAPT by way of a backward stepwise multivariate analysis. Four hundred forty-three patients were admitted for aSAH management. Two hundred ninety-eight patients required placement of an EVD. One hundred twenty patients (40%) were treated with stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion and required DAPT, while 178 patients (60%) were treated with coiling without stents or microsurgical clipping and did not receive DAPT. Forty-two (14%) cases of new hemorrhage along the EVD catheter were identified radiographically. Thirty-two of these hemorrhages occurred in patients on DAPT, while 10 occurred in patients without DAPT. After multivariate analysis, DAPT was significantly associated with radiographic hemorrhage [odds ratio: 4.92, 95% confidence interval: 2.45-9.91, P = .0001]. We did not observe an increased proportion of symptomatic hemorrhage in patients receiving DAPT (10 of 32 [31%]) vs those without (5 of 10 [50%]; P = .4508). Patients with aSAH who receive stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion are at higher risk for radiographic hemorrhage associated with EVD placement. The timing between EVD placement and DAPT initiation does not appear to be of clinical significance. Stenting and flow diversion remain viable options for aSAH patients.\n\nContinuous monitoring of intracranial pressure for prediction of postoperative complications of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, S-X; Zhang, Q-S; Yin, Y; Liu, Z; Wu, J-M; Yang, M-X\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThis study evaluates the value of continuous dynamic monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage to predict early postoperative complications. Data from 80 patients treated in our hospital from February 2014 to February 2015 were analyzed. The patients all underwent decompressive craniectomies, and their ICP changes were monitored invasively and continuously for 1 to 7 days after surgery. The average blood loss during surgery for the group of patients was 65.3 Â± 12.4 ml and the mean GCS score 8.7 Â± 2.4. Cases were divided into three groups according to ICP values to compare early postoperative complications of the groups: a normal and mildly increased group (51 cases), a moderately increased group (19 cases) and a severely increased group (10 cases). To validate the analysis we first showed that comparisons among groups based on gender, age, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, bleeding time, blood loss, operation time, craniectomy localization, and preoperative mannitol dosage yielded no statistically significant differences. In contrast, the following comparisons produced statistically significant differences: the comparison of postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores showing that the lower intracranial pressure, the higher the GCS score; the postoperative rehemorrhage, cerebral edema and death ratios showing the higher the intracranial pressure, the higher the rehemorrhage ratio; the average ICP and the time to occurrence of rehemorrhage, cerebral edema or cerebral infarction, showing the relationship between the average ICP and the time to a complication. Patients with higher ICP averages suffered a complication of rehemorrhage within the first 9.6 Â± 2.5 hours on average. Nevertheless, the comparison of GCS scores in those patients and the others showed no significant differences. Based on the findings, the dynamic monitoring of intracranial pressure can early and sensitively predict postoperative\n\nFactors Influencing Complications of Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy: A Single-Center Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nOner, Sedat; Okumus, Muhammed Masuk; Demirbas, Murat; Onen, Efe; Aydos, Mustafa Murat; Ustun, Mehmet Hakan; Kilic, Metin; Avci, Sinan\n\n2015-11-14\n\nPercutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is a minimally invasive procedure used for successful treatment of renal calculi. However, it is associated with various complications. We assessed the complications and their potential influencing factors in patients who had undergone PNL. In total, 1750 patients who had undergone PNL from November 2003 to June 2011 were evaluated retrospectively. PNL complications and possible contributing risk factors (age, sex, serum creatinine level, previous operations, hydronephrosis, calculi size, localization, opacity, surgeon's experience, accessed calyxes, number of accesses, and costal entries) were determined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to investigate the cutoff values of the data. Ideal cutoff value was determined by Youden's J statistic. All the demographic and clinical variables were examined using backward stepwise logistical regression analysis. Continuous variables were categorized with logistic regression analysis according to the cutoff values. Complications occurred in 396 (24.4%) patients who had undergone PNL. Hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion occurred in 221 (12.6%) patients, hemorrhage requiring arterial embolization occurred in 7 (0.4%) patients, perirenal hematoma occurred in 17 (0.97%) patients, hemo-pneumothorax occurred in 32 (1.8%) patients, and colon perforation occurred in 4 (0.22%) patients. Three patients (0.06%) died of severe urosepsis, and one patient (0.02%) died of severe bleeding. The calculus size, localization, access site, number of accesses, presence of staghorn stones, surgeon's experience, and duration of the operation significantly affected the complication risk. Our retrospective evaluation of this large patient series reveals that, PNL is a very effective treatment modality for kidney stones. However, although rare, serious complications including death can occur.\n\nMinimally invasive evacuation of intraventricular hemorrhage with the Apollo vibration/suction device.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Lee A; Lopes, Demetrius K; Munoz, Lorenzo F; Shah, Yojan; Bhabad, Sudeep; Jhaveri, Miral; Moftakhar, Roham\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIntraventricular hemorrhages (IVH) can occur as a consequence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, aneurysm rupture, arteriovenous malformation hemorrhage, trauma, or coagulopathy. IVH is a known risk factor for poor clinical outcome with up to 80% mortality. The current standard treatment strategy for IVH consists of the placement of an external ventricular drain. We report our early experience with using the Apollo suction/vibration aspiration system (Penumbra, Alameda, CA, USA) for minimally invasive evacuation of IVH with a review of the pertinent literature. Medical records of patients with IVH who were admitted to Rush University Medical Center, USA, from July to November 2014 were queried from the electronic database. Patients with Graeb Scores (GS) >6 were selected for minimally invasive IVH evacuation with the Apollo aspiration system. Patient demographics, pre- and post-operative GS, pre- and post-operative modified Graeb Score (mGS), as well procedure related complications were analyzed and recorded. A total of eight patients (five men) were identified during the study period. The average age was 55.5years. The mean GS was 9.6 pre-operatively and decreased to 4.9 post-operatively (p=0.0002). The mean mGS was 22.9 pre-operatively and decreased to 11.4 post-operatively (p=0.0001). Most of the IVH reduction occurred in the frontal horn and atrium of the lateral ventricle, as well the third ventricle. One (1/8) procedure-related complication occurred consisted of a tract hemorrhage. The Apollo system can be used for minimally invasive IVH evacuation to achieve significant blood clot volume reduction with minimal procedure-related complication. Copyright Â© 2016.

We examined incidence, risk factors, and consequences of agitation in these patients in a single-center retrospective study. We identified all patients treated with antipsychotics or dexmedetomidine from a prospective observational cohort of patients with spontaneous SAH. Agitation was confirmed by chart review. Outcomes were assessed at 12Â months using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS), and Lawton IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) scores. Independent predictors were identified using logistic regression. From 309 SAH patients admitted between January 2011 and December 2015, 52 (17Â %) developed agitation, frequently in the first 72Â h (50Â %) and in patients with Hunt-Hess grades 3-4 (12Â % of grades 1-2, 28Â % of grades 3-4, 8Â % of grade 5). There was also a significant association between agitation and a history of cocaine use or prior psychiatric diagnosis. Agitated patients were more likely to develop multiple hospital complications; and in half of these patients, complications were diagnosed within 24Â h of agitation onset. Agitation was associated with IADL impairment at 12Â months (Lawton >8; pÂ =Â 0.03, OR 2.7, 95Â % CI, 1.1-6.8) in non-comatose patients (Hunt-Hess 1-4), but not with functional outcome (mRS >3), cognitive impairment (TICS â¤30), or ICU/hospital length of stay after controlling for other predictors. Agitation occurs frequently after SAH, especially in non-comatose patients with higher clinical grades. It is associated with the development of multiple hospital complications and may have an independent impact on long-term outcomes.\n\nAgitation after subarachnoid hemorrhage: a frequent omen of hospital complications associated with worse outcomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nReznik, Michael E.; Schmidt, J.

Fetal brachial plexus injury (BPI) is the most common fetal complication occurring in 4-40% of cases. BPI has also been reported in abdominal deliveries and in deliveries not complicated by shoulder dystocia. Fractures of the fetal humerus and clavicle occur in about 10.6% of cases of shoulder dystocia and usually heal with no sequel. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is reported in 0.5-23% of cases of shoulder dystocia. The risk correlates with the duration of head-to-body delivery and is especially increased when the duration is >5 min. Fetal death is rare and is reported in 0.4% of cases. Maternal complications of shoulder dystocia include post-partum hemorrhage, vaginal lacerations, anal tears, and uterine rupture. The psychological stress impact of shoulder dystocia is under-recognized and deserves counseling prior to home discharge. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective was to determine whether rates of complications in hospitals are higher on weekends than on weekdays. We examined records from 4,967,114 admissions to acute care hospitals in 3 states and analyzed complication rates using the Patient Safety Indicators. We selected 8 indicators that could be assigned to a single day: complications of anesthesia, retained foreign bodies, postoperative hemorrhage, accidental cuts and lacerations during procedures, birth trauma, obstetric trauma during vaginal deliveries with and without instrumentation, and obstetric trauma during cesarean delivery. Odds ratios (ORs) comparing weekends versus weekdays were adjusted for demographics, type of admission, and admission route. In a subgroup analysis of surgical complications, we restricted the population to patients who underwent cardiac or vascular procedures. Four of the 8 complications occurred more frequently on weekends: postoperative hemorrhage (OR 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.14), newborn trauma (OR 1.06, 95% CI, 1.03-1.10), vaginal deliveries without instrumentation (OR 1.03, 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), and obstetric trauma during cesarean sections (OR 1.36, 95% CI, 1.29-1.44). Complications related to anesthesia occurred less frequently on weekends (OR 0.86). Among patients undergoing vascular procedures, surgical complications occurred more frequently on weekends (OR 1.46, 95% CI, 1.16-1.85). Rates of complications are marginally higher on weekends than on weekdays for some surgical and newborn complications, but more significantly for obstetric trauma and for surgical complications involving patients undergoing vascular procedures. Hospitals should work toward increasing the robustness of safeguards on weekends.\n\n[Thrombotic microangiopathy in pregnancy complicated by acute hemorrhagic-necrotic pancreatitis during early puerperium].\n\nPubMed\n\nRedechovÃ¡, S; FÃ©derovÃ¡, L; HammerovÃ¡, L; FilkÃ¡szovÃ¡, A; HorvÃ¡thovÃ¡, D; Redecha, M\n\n2014-06-01\n\nAuthors in the article describe a case of a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpurain 37 weeks gestation complicated by acute severe hemorrhagic-necrotic pancreatitis during the early puerperium. Case report. Ist Department of gynaecology and obstetrics of the Comenius University Bratislava. 33-years-old patient in the 37 weeks gestation was admitted to our department with the signs of HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets). Due to the worsening clinical status, we have performed caesarean section. After the transient stabilization of the patient's clinical status, the hemolysis with severe thrombocytopenia reappeared. Based on the clinical signs of abdominal pain and computer tomography, the diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic-necrotic pancreatitis was set. The primary diagnosis was thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Therefore, therapeutic plasma exchange was performed with consequent improvement of the patients clinical state. Normalization of the platelet count was achieved after 4.plasma exchanges. Consequently 5 plasma exchanges were performed. However, one month later, the disease relapsed. Therapeutic plasma exchanges were needed again (4x), with anti CD 20 administration. This therapy had good clinical outcome, without the need for further plasma exchanges. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is highly lethal disease. Early diagnosis, treatment, and multidisciplinary approach are essential.\n\nIntranasal Fentanyl Intoxication Leading to Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuzycki, Shannon; Yarema, Mark; Dunham, Michael; Sadrzadeh, Hossein; Tremblay, Alain\n\n2016-06-01\n\nIncreasing rates of opioid abuse, particularly fentanyl, may lead to more presentations of unusual effects of opioid toxicity. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a rare complication of fentanyl overdose. A 45-year-old male presented in hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage requiring intubation. Comprehensive drug screening detected fentanyl without exposure to cocaine. Further history upon the patient's recovery revealed exposure to snorted fentanyl powder immediately prior to presentation. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a potential, though rare, presentation of opioid intoxication. Recognition of less common complications of opioid abuse such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is important in proper management of overdoses.\n\nFatal complication of intravesical formalin during control of intractable hemorrhage from radiation cystitis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRao, M.S.; Singhal, P.C.; Bapna, B.C.\n\nFatal acute tubular necrosis occurred in 1 patient in whom intravesical formalin was used to control massive persistent hemorrhage from radiation cystitis. A suggestion is made to monitor blood formic acid levels and institute prompt dialysis whenever these exceed 80 mg per 100 ml to avert such a catastrophe. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate appears to be indicated prophylactically in combating the associated metabolic acidosis due to absorbed formic acid.\n\nBleeding complications after endovascular therapy of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeidenreich, J O; Hartlieb, S; Stendel, R; PietilÃ¤, T A; Schlattmann, P; Wolf, K-J; Schilling, A M\n\n2006-02-01\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhages after embolization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most dreaded complications of this well-established therapy. Apart from the known risk factors, our center noticed a high incidence of complications during postinterventional monitoring in medical intensive care units (ICUs) and stroke units. We report 125 consecutive interventions performed on 66 patients by using flow-dependent microcatheters and n-butyl cyanoacrylate as the embolic agent. Postinterventional intensive care monitoring was performed in an interdisciplinary operative ICU, a stroke unit, or a medical ICU. Patients were compared with regard to bleeding complications, AVM morphology, embolization result, postinterventional monitoring, and demographic factors. Intracerebral hemorrhages occurred in 7 patients. Significant differences in outcome were found between 66 patients monitored in the interdisciplinary operative ICU from medical ICU or stroke unit. This was also true when adjusted for age and extent of AVM reduction by using exact logistic regression. A partial AVM reduction of >60% was a considerable risk factor for hemorrhage (odds ratio [OR] = 18.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.341, not available]. Age was also an essential risk factor. An age difference of 10 years leads to an OR of 2.545 (95% CI [1.56, 7.35]). A considerable AVM reduction in one session appears to increase the risk of hemorrhage technically. This suggests a distribution of the interventions in many partial steps.\n\nGastric Ulcer Hemorrhage - a Potential Life-Threatening Complication of Intragastric Balloon Treatment of Obesity.\n\nPubMed\n\nMojkowska, Aleksandra; Gazdzinski, Stefan; Fraczek, Mariusz; WyleÅ¼oÅ, Mariusz\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSome morbidly obese patients do not qualify for bariatric surgery due to general health contraindications. Intragastric balloon treatment might be a therapeutic option in the above-mentioned cases. It can prime super-obese patients with end-stage disease for bariatric surgery. As a neoadjuvant therapy before surgery, it leads to a downstage of the disease by preliminary weight reduction, to an improvement in general health and, in summary, to a reduction of the perioperative risk. It is generally considered to be a safe method. However, due to the wide range of possible complications and unusual symptoms after intragastric balloon treatment, an interdisciplinary, instead of only a surgical or endoscopic, treatment and follow-up might be recommended in these patients. We here describe a potential life-threatening complication in the form of gastric bleeding as a consequence of intragastric balloon treatment and simultaneous aspirin taking and Helicobacter pylori infection. There have been reports of some complications of intragastric balloon treatment. However, to the best of our knowledge there were no reports concerning life-threatening hemorrhage from gastric ulcer.

We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the safety of aminocaproic acid in 109 patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients were included if aminocaproic acid had been administered for at least 24 hours for the prevention or treatment of thrombocytopenic hemorrhage. Our primary outcome was thromboembolic complications defined as arterial or venous thrombotic events objectively confirmed by imaging studies. Thromboembolic complications occurred in five patients (4.6%) and all were venous thromboses. Other than the underlying malignancy, these patients also had many concurrent risk factors including indwelling central venous catheters, which could have contributed to thromboses. In conclusion, in our population of patients with a variety of hematological malignancies, aminocaproic acid does not appear to be associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic complications.\n\nCerebrovascular Complications After Heart Transplantation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlejaldre, AÃ­da; Delgado-Mederos, Raquel; Santos, Miguel Ãngel; MartÃ­-FÃ bregas, Joan\n\n2010-01-01\n\nNeurological complications in orthotopic heart transplantation represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality despite successful transplantation. The most frequent perioperative neurological complications are delirium or encephalopathy. In this period cerebrovascular complication ranges between 5-11%. After the perioperative period, the 5-year stroke risk after cardiac transplantation is 4.1%. In a retrospective study conducted with 314 patients who underwent cardiac transplantation, it was found that 20% of cerebrovascular complications occurred within the first two weeks after transplantation, while 80% occurred in the late postoperative phase. Of these, ischemic stroke is the most common subtype. In the perioperative periode, hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrest, extracorporeal circulation over 2 hours, prior history of stroke, and carotid stenosis greater than 50% have been reported to be risk factors for the occurrence of cerebrovascular complications. Perioperative cerebrovascular complications are associated with higher mortality and poor functional outcome at one year follow-up. After the perioperative period, the only factor that has been significantly associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular complications is a history of prior stroke, either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Other associated factors include unknown atrial fibrillation, septic emboli from endocarditis, cardiac catheterization and perioperative hemodynamic shock. According to the TOAST etiologic classification, the most prevalent etiologic subtype of ischemic stroke is undetermined cause.

Cirrhosis is the most common cause of duodenal varices. In most cases, duodenal varices occur concomitantly with esophageal varices, further complicating identification with initial endoscopy. Although many modalities have been explored with respect to management and treatment approaches, guidelines have yet to be established owing to the infrequency in which bleeding occurs from ectopic duodenal varices. We present a case of massive duodenal variceal hemorrhage that highlights the complexity of initial diagnosis and ultimately required a transesophageal intrahepatic portosystemic shunt with coil embolization for control of bleeding.

Case-control analysis. The authors performed multiple statistical analyses of all children undergoing tonsillectomy at Temple University Children's Medical Center (Philadelphia, PA) during a 29-month period. Children readmitted to the hospital with or without surgical control of bleeding were compared with children who did not bleed. Relation of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhages to the phase of the moon was evaluated using a standard normal deviate. The frequency of surgery performed on Friday-the-13th days was compared with a differently dated Friday chosen at random. Clusters of three hemorrhages in a 7-day period were recorded. Families of children were contacted and asked whether their child had red hair. A chi analysis compared redheaded and non-redheaded tonsillectomy patients. Twenty-eight of 589 tonsillectomy cases performed required readmission for bleeding events. Twenty tonsillectomies occurred on a full-moon day, resulting in one bleeding event. One cluster of three post-tonsillectomy hemorrhages occurred in a 7-day period. Four of the children who bled had red hair. Two tonsillectomies occurred on Friday the 13th, with no associated hemorrhage. Statistical analysis revealed a random pattern to post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage. Post-tonsillectomy hemorrhages do not occur in clusters of three and are not more frequent with the full moon or on Friday the 13th. The bleeding rate among children with red hair is similar to that of non-redheaded children.\n\nA case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever complicated with acute pancreatitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBastug, Aliye; Kayaaslan, Bircan; But, Ayse; Aslaner, Halide; Sertcelik, Ahmet; Akinci, Esragul; Onguru, Pinar; Yetkin, Meltem Arzu; Bodur, Hurrem\n\n2014-11-01\n\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease characterized by nonspecific symptoms like fever, myalgia, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. It can result in various complications during the course of the disease due to the diffuse endothelial injury involved in the pathogenesis of CCHF. Here we present a patient with CCHF complicated by acute pancreatitis, including pleural and intra-abdominal effusions. A 70-year-old patient was referred to our hospital from an endemic area with the suspicion of CCHF. The physical examination of the patient revealed high fever (38Â°C), somnolence, and petechial eruption. The diagnosis of case was confirmed with positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The viral load of the patient was 4Ã10(9) copies/mL. On the fifth day of admission, upper abdominal pain, scleral ichter, and abdominal distention developed. The patient had abdominal tenderness with guarding. The laboratory tests revealed an amylase level of 1740âU/L (28-100), lipase level of 583âU/L (13-60), and total bilirubin level of 3.75âmg/dL (<0.3). The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was confirmed with radiological findings. Until now, atypical presentations of CCHF have been reported in some case reports, but not acute pancreatitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute pancreatitis in the literature seen in the course of CCHF.\n\nUltrasonography in the diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis â a complication of bone marrow transplantation in pediatric oncology patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBiel, Anna; SokoÅowska-DÄ bek, DÄ brÃ³wka; Olchowy, Cyprian; Åasecki, Mateusz\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of hemorrhagic cystitis following bone marrow transplantation in children. Material and methods The study involved an analysis of clinical material and the results of imaging tests performed in 334 patients who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation. Ultrasonographic findings in 42 patients with hemorrhagic cystitis were analyzed in detail. The ultrasound images served to assess the severity of hemorrhagic cystitis and the results were compared with the clinical assessment of the disease on the Droller scale, as well as the laboratory and endoscopic tests. Results In the studied group of patients hemorrhagic cystitis following allogeneic transplantation was diagnosed in 12.5% cases. 73.8% patients received transplants from unrelated donors, 26.2% â from compatible siblings. The study revealed a higher incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis in children above 10 years of age. Grade 3 according to the Droller was diagnosed in 42.9%, grade 2 â in 30.9%, grade 4 â in 14.3%, and grade 1 â in 11.9% patients. The number of ultrasound examinations depended on the clinical symptoms, severity, duration and co-occurrence of other complications following the transplantation and was within the 1â15 range (average: 4.6). Grades 3 and 4 were related to the poor clinical condition of the patients and to their longer hospitalization. During this period there was an increased risk of renal malfunction and acute renal failure, post-inflammatory narrowing of the ureters, hydronephrosis, and in grade 4 the fibrosis of the bladder with reduced bladder capacity. Analyses demonstrated a significant correlation between the ultrasound image of the bladder wall and the clinical severity. Conclusions Ultrasound with Doppler options remains the primary diagnostic tool in the evaluation of hemorrhagic cystitis, and is useful in terms of its diagnosis, determination of the severity, and\n\n[Case report: Aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage -- complicated course due to coincidental manifestation of an inverted Tako-Tsubo-cardiomyopathy].\n\nPubMed\n\nZech, Nina; Kieninger, Martin; Seemann, Milena; KÃ¼nzig, Holger; Bele, Sylvia; Dietl, Alexander\n\n2014-07-01\n\nWe report the case of a patient who suffered a serious subarachnoid hemorrhage with a cardialaffection and development of an inverted Tako-Tsubo-cardiomyopathy. To avoid apparent cerebral ischemia due to severe cerebral vasospasm after exhaustion of conservative therapeutic options a temporarily endovascular therapy with continuous intra-arterial application of Nimodipine was necessary. In the overall protracted and complicated course the special challenge were the therapeutic efforts to avoid apparent cerebral ischemia in context to the significant cardial affection.

Imaging by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nKirkinen, P; Partanen, K; RyynÃ¤nen, M; OrdÃ©n, M R\n\n1997-08-01\n\nTo describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings associated with fetal intracranial hemorrhage and to compare them with ultrasound findings. In four pregnancies complicated by fetal intracranial hemorrhage, fetal imaging was carried out using T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences and T1-weighted fast low angle shot imaging sequences and by transabdominal ultrasonography. An antepartum diagnosis of hemorrhage was made by ultrasound in one case and by MRI in two. Retrospectively, the hemorrhagic area could be identified from the MRI images in an additional two cases and from the ultrasound images in one case. In the cases of intraventricular hemorrhage, the MRI signal intensity in the T1-weighted images was increased in the hemorrhagic area as compared to the contralateral ventricle and brain parenchyma. In a case with subdural hemorrhage, T2-weighted MRI signals from the hemorrhagic area changed from low-to high-intensity signals during four weeks of follow-up. Better imaging of the intracranial anatomy was possible by MRI than by transabdominal ultrasonography. MRI can be used for imaging and dating fetal intracranial hemorrhages. Variable ultrasound and MRI findings are associated with this complication, depending on the age and location of the hemorrhage.\n\nPerioperative spontaneous bilateral suprachoroidal hemorrhage\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaridas, Anjana; Litwin, Andre S.; Coker, Timothy\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSummary Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a rare condition, occurring most commonly in the perioperative period, although cases of unilateral spontaneous hemorrhages have been reported.

There were assessed, retrospectively, 64 patients that underwent surgical treatment for bone metastases, analyzing the complications that occurred in the pre-operative and early post- operative period and associating them with the tumor origin, type of procedure done, the need of blood reposition before the surgery, the need of new surgical procedures and the mortality due to the complications. Early complications in the treatment were observed in 17 (26.6%) patients, of which six (35.2%) ended up dying due to these complications. Regarding the type, 15 (23.8%) cases were due to surgical complications, four (6.3%) clinical and three (4.7%) patients showed clinical and surgical complications. There was no significant difference in the frequency of complications or mortality when assessed the type of reconstruction or affected region. The tumors with a renal origin needed more blood reposition and showed a bigger frequency of complications. The complications occurred in 26.6%. The complications are not related to the kind of treatment performed or to the region affected. The renal origin tumors showed a higher risk of hemorrhage.\n\nFrequency and determinants for hemorrhagic transformation of posterior cerebral stroke : Posterior ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic transformation.\n\nPubMed\n\nValentino, Francesca; Gentile, Luana; Terruso, Valeria; Mastrilli, Sergio; Aridon, Paolo; Ragonese, Paolo; Sarno, Caterina; Savettieri, Giovanni; D'Amelio, Marco\n\n2017-11-13\n\nhemorrhagic transformation is a threatening ischemic stroke complication. Frequency of hemorrhagic transformation differs greatly among studies, and its risk factors have been usually studied in patients with anterior ischemic stroke who received thrombolytic therapy. We evaluated, in a hospital-based series of patients with posterior ischemic stroke not treated with thrombolysis, frequency and risk factors of hemorrhagic transformation. Patients with posterior circulation stroke were seen in our Department during the period January 2004 to December 2009. Demographic and clinical information were collected. We estimated risk for spontaneous hemorrhagic transformation by means of uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses. 119 consecutive patients were included (73 males, 61.3%). Hemorrhagic transformation was observed in 7 patients (5.9%). Only clinical worsening was significantly associated with hemorrhagic transformation (OR 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-34.5). Our findings indicate that patients with posterior have a low risk of spontaneous hemorrhagic transformation, suggesting that these patients might have greater advantage from intravenous thrombolysis.\n\nHemorrhagic Bullous Angina: A Case Report and Review of the Literature\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRodrigues, Sara; Albrechete, Marielle; Monsanto, Rafael; Chagury, Azis; Lorenzetti, Fabio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHemorrhagic bullous angina (HBA) is described as the sudden onset of one or more bullous lesions in the oral cavity, not attributable to other vesiculobullous diseases, blood dyscrasias, or autoimmune and vascular diseases. These lesions occur almost exclusively in the oral cavity, particularly in the soft palate, and do not affect the masticatory mucosa. Here we present the case of a 57-year-old male who had a spontaneously ruptured hemorrhagic bulging in his soft palate diagnosed as HBA, along with discussion of the literature. In conclusion, HBA is a rare, benign, oral disease with low complication rates. Diagnosis is essentially clinical, and treatment consists of local hygiene and prevention of oral trauma.

This review aims to characterize the effect of hyponatremia on morbidity and mortality after SAH. We sought to determine the prevalence of hyponatremia after SAH, including in subgroups, as well as its effect on mortality and certain outcome measures, including degree of disability and duration of hospitalization. A search of terms \"hyponatremia\" and \"subarachnoid hemorrhage\" was performed on PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Studies were included if they reported prevalence of hyponatremia and if they discussed outcomes such as mortality, duration of stay, functional outcomes (e.g., Glasgow Outcomes Scale), or incidence of complications in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Two independent researchers assessed the titles and abstracts and reviewed articles for inclusion. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria. The prevalence of at least mild hyponatremia was 859 of 2387 (36%) of patients. Hyponatremia was associated with vasospasm and duration of hospitalization, but it did not influence mortality. Hyponatremia is common after SAH, and there is evidence that it is associated with certain poorer outcomes. Larger, prospective studies are needed to assess these findings and provide further evidence. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This article is Part II in a series dedicated to assessing infants with an umbilical catheter. Part I focused on infants with umbilical venous catheters; this article will focus on the physical assessment relevant to infants with an UAC. Complications related to UACs can occur during any phase of treatment: insertion, while indwelling, or after discontinuing the catheter. Review of clinical signs of complications along with clinical photographs, will assist caregivers in promptly recognizing UAC-related complications.\n\nIntracerebral hemorrhage after external ventricular drain placement: an evaluation of risk factors for post-procedural hemorrhagic complications.\n\nPubMed\n\nRowe, A Shaun; Rinehart, Derrick R; Lezatte, Stephanie; Langdon, J Russell\n\n2018-03-07\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate and identify the risk factors for developing a new or enlarged intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) after the placement of an external ventricular drain. A single center, nested case-control study of individuals who received an external ventricular drain from June 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014 was conducted at a large academic medical center. A bivariate analysis was conducted to compare those individuals who experienced a post-procedural intracranial hemorrhage to those who did not experience a new bleed. The variables identified as having a p-value less than 0.15 in the bivariate analysis were then evaluated using a multivariate logistic regression model. Twenty-seven of the eighty-one study participants experienced a new or enlarged intracranial hemorrhage after the placement of an external ventricular drain. Of these twenty-seven patients, 6 individuals received an antiplatelet within ninety-six hours of external ventricular drain placement (pÂ =â0.024). The multivariate logistic regression model identified antiplatelet use within 96Â h of external ventricular drain insertion as an independent risk factor for post-EVD ICH (OR 13.1; 95% CI 1.95-88.6; pÂ =â0.008). Compared to those study participants who did not receive an antiplatelet within 96Â h of external ventricular drain placement, those participants who did receive an antiplatelet were 13.1 times more likely to exhibit a new or enlarged intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nEARLY COMPLICATIONS IN THE ORTHOPEDIC TREATMENT OF BONE METASTASES\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTeixeira, Luiz Eduardo Moreira; Miranda, Ricardo Horta; Ghedini, Daniel Ferreira; Aguilar, Rafael BazÃ­lio; Novais, Eduardo Nilo Vasconcelos; de Abreu e Silva, Guilherme Moreira; AraÃºjo, Ivana Duval; de Andrade, Marco AntÃ´nio Percope\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective: To assess the early complications in the orthopedic treatment of metastatic bone lesions and the factors associated with these complications.

Immunohistochemistry for amyloid beta-protein (A beta) revealed extensive CAA in the intrasulcal meningeal vessels rather than in the cerebral cortical vessels. All of the examined cases had multiple hematomas in the subarachnoid space, mainly in the cerebral sulci, as well as intracerebral hematomas. Each intracerebral hematoma was connected to the subarachnoid hematomas at the depth of cerebral sulci or through the lateral side of the cortex. There was no debris of the cerebral cortical tissue in the subarachnoid hematomas. In case 2, another solitary subarachnoid hematoma, which was not connected to any intracerebral hematoma, was seen. In all of these subarachnoid hematomas, many ruptured A beta-immunopositive arteries were observed. These ruptured arteries did not accompany any debris of the brain tissue, some of them were large in diameter (250-300 microm), and several of them were far from the cerebral cortex. Therefore, it was considered that they were not cortical arteries but meningeal arteries. Within the cerebral cortex, there were only a few ruptured arteries associated with small hemorrhages. There were no ruptured vessels within the intracerebral hematomas. There was a strong suggestion that all of the subarachnoid hematomas, including the solitary one in case 2, originated from the rupture of the meningeal arteries. The present study indicates that in some cases of subcortical hematoma caused by CAA, the primary hemorrhage occurs in the subarachnoid space, in particular the cerebral sulci, because of rupture of multiple meningeal arteries. Infarction occurs subsequently in the cortex around the hematoma, the hematoma penetrates into the brain parenchyma, and finally, a subcortical hematoma is formed.\n\nRecurrent hemorrhage from corpus luteum during anticoagulant therapy.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWong, K. P.; Gillett, P. G.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA 43-year old woman had recurrent massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage from rupture of a hemorrhagic corpus luteum in two successive menstrual cycles while receiving anticoagulant therapy. Left oophorectomy was performed on the first occasion and right salpingo-oophorectomy with left salpingectomy on the second. While the precise incidence cannot be determined, rupture from a hemorrhagic corpus luteum appears to be a rare but potentially catastrophic complication of anticoagulant therapy. Hence possible ovarian hemorrhage should be considered in women of reproductive age receiving heparin or sodium warfarin therapy.

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic that has been shown to reduce blood loss in a variety of clinical conditions. Information regarding the use of tranexamic acid in treating lower GI hemorrhage is lacking. The aim of this trial was to determine the clinical efficacy of tranexamic acid when used for lower GI hemorrhage. This was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The study was conducted at a tertiary referral university hospital in Australia. Consecutive patients aged >18 years with lower GI hemorrhage requiring hospital admission from November 2011 to January 2014 were screened for trial eligibility (N = 265). A total of 100 patients were recruited after exclusions and were randomly assigned 1:1 to either tranexamic acid or placebo. The primary outcome was blood loss as determined by reduction in hemoglobin levels. The secondary outcomes were transfusion rates, transfusion volume, intervention rates for bleeding, length of hospital stay, readmission, and complication rates. There was no difference between groups with respect to hemoglobin drop (11âg/L of tranexamic acid vs 13âg/L of placebo; p = 0.9445). There was no difference with respect to transfusion rates (14/49 tranexamic acid vs 16/47 placebo; p = 0.661), mean transfusion volume (1.27 vs 1.93 units; p = 0.355), intervention rates (7/49 vs 13/47; p = 0.134), length of hospital stay (4.67 vs 4.74 d; p = 0.934), readmission, or complication rates. No complications occurred as a direct result of tranexamic acid use. A larger multicenter trial may be required to determine whether there are more subtle advantages with tranexamic acid use in some of the secondary outcomes. Tranexamic acid does not appear to decrease blood loss or improve clinical outcomes in patients presenting with lower GI hemorrhage in the context of this trial. see Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A453.\n\nRelevance of surgery after embolization of gastrointestinal and abdominal hemorrhage.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶hler, Gernot; Koch, Oliver Owen; Antoniou, Stavros A; Mayer, Franz; Lechner, Michael; Pallwein-Prettner, Leo; Emmanuel, Klaus\n\n2014-09-01\n\nGastrointestinal and abdominal bleeding can lead to life-threatening situations. Embolization is considered a feasible and safe treatment option. The relevance of surgery has thus diminished in the past. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of surgery in the management of patients after embolization. We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of outcomes after transarterial embolization of acute abdominal and gastrointestinal hemorrhage between January 2009 and December 2012 at the Sisters of Charity Hospital, Linz. Patients were divided into three groups, as follows: upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and abdominal hemorrhage. Fifty-four patients with 55 bleeding events were included. The bleeding source could be localized angiographically in 80 %, and the primary clinical success rate of embolization was 81.8 % (45/55 cases). Early recurrent bleeding (<30 days) occurred in 18.2 % (10/55) of the patients, and delayed recurrent hemorrhage (>30 days) developed in 3.6 % (2/55). The mean follow-up was 8.4 months, and data were available for 85.2 % (46/54) of the patients. Surgery after embolization was required in 20.4 % of these patients (11/54). Failure to localize the bleeding site was identified as predictive of recurrent bleeding (p = 0.009). More than one embolization effort increased the risk of complications (p = 0.02) and rebleeding (p = 0.07). Surgery still has an important role after embolization in patients with gastrointestinal and abdominal hemorrhage. One of five patients required surgery in cases of early and delayed rebleeding or because of ischemic complications (2/55 both had ischemic damage of the gallbladder) and bleeding consequences.\n\nAngiographic evaluation and management of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWalker, T Gregory; Salazar, Gloria M; Waltman, Arthur C\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAlthough most cases of acute nonvariceal gastrointestinal hemorrhage either spontaneously resolve or respond to medical management or endoscopic treatment, there are still a significant number of patients who require emergency angiography and transcatheter treatment. Evaluation with noninvasive imaging such as nuclear scintigraphy or computed tomography may localize the bleeding source and/or confirm active hemorrhage prior to angiography. Any angiographic evaluation should begin with selective catheterization of the artery supplying the most likely site of bleeding, as determined by the available clinical, endoscopic and imaging data. If a hemorrhage source is identified, superselective catheterization followed by transcatheter microcoil embolization is usually the most effective means of successfully controlling hemorrhage while minimizing potential complications. This is now well-recognized as a viable and safe alternative to emergency surgery. In selected situations transcatheter intra-arterial infusion of vasopressin may also be useful in controlling acute gastrointestinal bleeding. One must be aware of the various side effects and potential complications associated with this treatment, however, and recognize the high re-bleeding rate. In this article we review the current role of angiography, transcatheter arterial embolization and infusion therapy in the evaluation and management of nonvariceal gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Thus, at least in part, anosmia is caused by the hemorrhage itself and not only by surgical treatment. However, it is unknown whether anosmia is related to rupture of the aneurysm with sudden increase in intracranial pressure or to the presence of blood in the basal cisterns. Therefore, we studied the prevalence of anosmia in patients with nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage. We included all patients admitted to our hospital with perimesencephalic hemorrhage between 1983 and 2005. Patients were interviewed with a structured questionnaire. We calculated the proportion of patients with anosmia with corresponding 95% CIs. Nine of 148 patients (6.1%; 95% CI, 2.8% to 11%) had noticed anosmia shortly after the perimesencephalic hemorrhage. In 2, the anosmia had disappeared after 8 to12 weeks; in the other 7, it still persisted after a mean period of follow-up of 9 years. Anosmia occurs in one of every 16 patients with perimesencephalic hemorrhage, which is lower than previously reported rates after coiling in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage but higher than rates after coiling for unruptured aneurysms. These data suggest that blood in the vicinity of the olfactory nerves plays a role in the development of anosmia.\n\nManagement of severe dengue hemorrhagic fever and bleeding complications in a primigravidaÂ patient: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nHariyanto, Hori; Yahya, Corry Quando; Wibowo, Primartanto; Tampubolon, Oloan E\n\n2016-12-20\n\nThe incidence of dengue hemorrhagic fever is increasing among the adult population living in endemic areas. The disease carries a 0.73% fatality rate for the general population, but what happens when the disease strikes a special subpopulation group, the obstetrics? Perhaps the important question specific to this special subpopulation revolves around the right time and mode of delivery under severe coagulopathy and plasma leakage in conditions of imminent delivery. A 24-year-old primigravid Sundanese woman presented to our intensive care unit due to acute pulmonary edema secondary to massive plasma leakage caused by severe dengue. She tested positive for both immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M dengue serology indicating she had secondary dengue infection, which placed her at risk for an exaggerated cytokine response as was evident clinically. She had to undergo an emergency cesarean section which was later complicated by rebleeding and hemodynamic instability due to an atypical defervescence period. She was successfully managed by multiple blood transfusions and was discharged from our intensive care unit on day 8 without any negative sequel. Fever, thrombocytopenia, and hemoconcentration are the classical symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever observed in adult, pediatric, and obstetric populations. However, a clinician must be particularly watchful in treating a pregnant dengue-infected patient as physiologic hematology changes provide greater volume compensation and the advent of shock marks significan"
