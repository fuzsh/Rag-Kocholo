SiNOB the publication of the first Edition of this Handbook, time and events have effected changes little anticipated by its author. The general introduction of Railways throughout Spain, the improyement of roads and circulation of steamers along the coasts, and the establishment, in all frequented 4istriot8, of sufficiently comfortable hotels, haye re- yolutionized the mode of trayelOng. In consequence oi this, the whole arrangement of th^ Boutes of the Handbook required to be altered. Aboye all, security in trayelling has been ensured by the establishment all oyer Spain of a police force based on the model of our own and that of the Irish constabulary, and thoroughly efficient in the performance of its duties. Under such circumstanceSy a satisfactory reyision of the Handbook Qpuld be effected only on the spot. This has been the course pursued in the present and preceding Editions, and the results will be apparent in eyery page. In .this yolume haye been included some of the mostkiteresting passages torn Fold's * Gatherings in Spain,' one of the happiest productions of their lamented author, as well as many extracts from the Second Fart of the Handbook, now out of print. Several of the descriptions of British Battles in the Peninsula were written on the spot by a military officer. To those of our countrymen who have exhausted the cities, plains, and mountains, most usually visited in Switserlandy Italy, and on the Rhine, we would remark that Spain in 1888 is as easy of access, as /ree/r<m a 2 Digitized by VjOOQIC ptrmmal dangers, and in most respects as well supplied with the indis- pensable oonyeniences of civilized life as any tract of country in Europe. In historical and artistic interest Spain is second only to Italy; many of its cathedrals are worthy to be compared with the finest Gk)thic buildings of France or Gennany; its Moorish remains are unriyalled; and it possesses a character and originality of its own, scarcely to be found elsewhere, by which all mtelligent travellers have been irresistibly fascinated. We would especially refer English travellers in Spain to § 17 of our Preliminary Eemarks : a due attention to the hints as to conduct, &c., therein contained will ensure deference, attention, and kindly assistance to both lady and gentleman tourist throughout the length and breadth of the Peninsula. In the present Edition all practical information regarding hotels, official residents^ tradespeople, details of locomoti(ni, and other matters liable tc constant change, has been transferred &om the descriptive Routes and incorporated with the Index at the end of the volume. This portion of the work will bd corrected from time to time, and the latest and most accurate Directory of each particular town will thus be placed at the traveller's disposaL Populations have been ^ven wherever they could be satisfactorily ascertained, and in aU important cases will be found substantially correct. Those of the smaller provincial towns must be Regarded as approximate only, and villages containing less than a thousand inhabitants have not been indicated at alL The superstition and prejudice of the people, who think that they are numbered for the sake of being additionally taxed, render the returns of the census at all times somewhat untrustworthy, both in Spain and Portugal In country towns lying to some extent off the beaten track, there is seldom more than one Inn— usually the stopping-place of the coach or omnibus, and known by the Christian name of its landlord. This name has been indicated wherever possible ; but the tourist who ventures into such unfrequented districts will probably have sufficient command of the Digitized by VjOOQIC 'Preface, v langnage to enable Mm to find out whether there have been any recent changes. The Editor urgently requests that travellers will kindly send him a correction of such errors or omissions as may fall within their notice, under care to Mr. Murray. Numerals enclosed in parentheses indicate population, and (B.) stands for Buffet at the Ely. Stat. Hotels, &c., of special excellence, and objects most worthy of remark, are distinguished by an asterisk* > 4pr^, 1892.

Since Spain appears, on the map, to be a square and most compact kingdom, politicians and geographers have treated it and its inhabitants as one and the same ; practically, however, this treatment of the Penin- sula is impossible, since both the poUtical and social instincts of each once independent province vary the one from the other, no less than do the chmate and productions themselves. No spick and span constitu- tion, be it printed on parchment or calico, can at once efface traditions and antipathies of a thousand years ; the accidents of localities and provincial nationahties out of which they have sprung, remain too deeply dyed to be forthwith discharged by theorists. Spaniards may talk and boast of their countrv, of their Fatria : every single individual in his heart really only loves his native province, and only considers as his fellow-countryman, mpaisano — a most binding and endearing word — one born in the same locality as himself: hence it is not easy to pre- dicate much in regard to \"the Spains\" and Spaniards in general, which will hold quite good as to each particular portion ruled by the sovereign of Las Espaiixis, the plural title given to the chief of the federal union of this kingdom. Espafldismo ma^ be said to consist in a love for a common faith and king, and in a comoidenoe of resistance to all foreign dictation. The deep sentiments of religion, loyalty, and inde- pendence, noble characteristics indeed, have been sapped in our times by the influence of transpyrenean revolutions, and Iby Bourbon mi»- govemment. In order to assist strangers in understanding the Peninsula and its people, some prehminary remarks are prefixed to each section or pro- vince, in which the leading characteristics of nature and man are pointed out. Two general observations mav be premised. First The People of Spain, the so-called Lower Orders, are in some respects superior to those who arrogate to themselves the title of being their Betters, and in most respects are more interesting. Tlie masses, the least spoilt and the most national, stand Hke pillars amid ruins, and on them the edifice of Spain's greatness must be reconstructed. This may have arisen, in this land of anomahes, from the peculiar policy of govern- ment in Church and State, where the possessors of religious and civil monopolies, who dreaded knowledge as power, pressed heavily on the noble and rich, dwarfing dowii their bodies by mtermarriages, and all but extinguishing their minds by Inquisitions ; while the People, over- looked in the obscurity of poverty, were allowed to grow out to their fall growth Hke wild weeds of a rich soil. They, in fact, have long enjoyed, under despotisms of Church and State, a practical and personiu independence, the good results of which are evident in their stalwart frames and manly bearing. Secondly, A distinction must ever be made between the Spaniard in his individual; and in his coUective capacity, and still more in an official one: taken by himself, he is true and valiant: the nicety of his Fundmor, or point of personal honour, is proverbial ; to him, as an individoal, you may safely trust your life, fair fame, and purse. Digitized by Google § 1. — Spain and Spaniards, [3] Yet history, treating of these individuals in the collective -/ww^oc^os, presents the foulest examples of misbehaviour in the field, of Punic bad faith in the cabinet, of bankruptcy and repudiation on the exchange. This may be, however, entirely owing to the deteriorating influence of bad government, by which the individual Spaniard, like the monk in a convent, has been hitherto fused into the corporate. The pohtical atmosphere has been too infectious to avoid some corruption, and while the Spaniard individually felt that his character was only in safe keeping when in his own hands (and no man of any nation knows better then how to uphold it), yet when linked with others, his self- pride has lent itself readily to feelings of mistrust, until self-interest has been too often uppermost. From suspecting that he would be sold and sacrificed by others, he has usually been willing to float down the turbid stream like the rest : vet official employment has never entirely destroyed the private good qualities of the empleado^ and he has ever been ready to do justice when appealed to as an individual. This apparent defect in the Spanish political character has been doubtless owing to the total absence of any well- organized system of constitutional government ; there have been no parliamentary parties, no regular \" her Majesty's Opposition,\" for everything is different in Spain from what it is with us. In England the leader of the Opposition benches is a minister \"in posse ;\" but here, as in the East, the premier power and authority has been a thing of the present, ready to collapse as soon as the leader of some rival cabal had sufiicient power to enable him to oust his opponent. The noble people of Spain have, indeed, had legs, arms, and nearts, but a head has hitherto been wanting. The only abstract Spanish idea of government or sovereignty, either in Church or State, from the reign of Philip II, to that of Isabel II., which terminated in the autumn of 1868, has been despotic. Nor can a despotic rule be said to have been really unpopular ; even the Inquisition had its supporters among the people : and whenever Ferdinand VII. committed any extra atrocious act, his subjects exclaimed with rapture, **j&« mucho BeyT* (he is every inch a king!) There spoke the whole nation, for all Spaniards felt that, in his place, they would have done exactly the same, and therefore sympathisingly admired. Power ex- pressed by violence flattered their pride, as each atom beheld his own personal greatness represented and reflected in that of his monarch. A strong government is absolutely necessary for Spain, and if it can only be rendered enlightened, or illustradoy it will prove a blessing to Spaniards. The Cortes and constitution have long been mere words, and the elections a mockery ; the Oobernadores and the alcades have invariably tampered with the registries, and intimidated the voters ; while opposition candidates, if elected, have been terrorised by the Bword. What is now wanting for the whole peninsula, is peace, an educated wealthy middle doss, and a strong fixed government. It is to this necessity of repose that must be attributed the apathy of the shrewd nation during the latter years of Bourbon mismanagement, and the well-advised indifference with which it has invariably allowed its charters tober^nt.

Notwithstanding a Royal Decree of Dec. 17, 1862, releasing foreigners entering Spain from showing a passport, a stra^er is generally expected to have one, and in remote parts of Spain is extremely likely to he locked up for an hour or two if he cannot produce one. The passport, in point of fact, takes the place, for the foreigner, of the native cedvla^ or authoritative paper of identification. Qua \"passport,\" it is no longer required. But without it, you are a \" vagahond \" ; just as a native would he a vagahond without his cedula. A Foreign-office passport (cost, 28.) should therefore he ohtained without fail hy every one about to enter the Peninsula. It ought to he vise hy the Spanish Consul in London or elsewhere (fee, 1 dollar). It will he useful as a proof of identity, whilst its production may be required in order io obtain letters at the post-office. Travellers who propose taking Portugal on their way to or from Spain 'Portuguese vise either in London or Paris. Messrs. West Strand ; Ed.

Custom-house officers in Spain give very little trouble, and the receivers of the derechos de jmertas, or dues levied at city-^ates on comestibles de Jocot— articles of^ eating and drinking— give none at all to ordinary travellers ; but no prudent traveller should ever risk his ease and security by carrying any prohibited goods with him. The objects most searched for are sealed letters and tobacco : if the lover of cigars has a considerable stock with him (a pound or so may pass), he is advised to declare it at once, pay the duty, and obtain a guia, or permit, which exempts him from further molestation. English fire* arms and gunpowder are prohibited except by special licence from the Captain-General of the district (see p. [23]). Sportsmen, however, who enter Spain from Gibraltar may manage to introduce their own guns and ammunition. As the Besgttardos—ihe custom-house officers and preventive service — have a right to examine baggage, it is of no use to resist or lose time and temper ; much more may be done by good-humour, patience, civiUty, and a oigar : raise, therefore, no difficulties, but offer your keys, and profess the greatest readiness to have everything examined.

S 4.--SPANISH Monet and Measures. The money of Spain was assimilated to that of France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland, m 1868, when the Peseta of 4 Reals = 1 franc, was made the monetary unit. (100 centimos = 4 reals = 1 peseta.)

G^d. The bank-notes in circulation vary in amount from 25 pesetas, or 100 reals, to 1000 pesetas. Notes of the Banco de Fspafla should alone be accepted, as local notes are only negotiable in their own town. Gold, whether of the old or new coinage, is now so extremely scarce that it may almost be con- sidered as withdrawn from circulation. The older pieces are very handsome, but are often of short weight, and the traveller should be cautious about receiving them, unless he is collecting coins. Some care is necessary also when taking change in silver, as pieces of a certain date, especially dollars, are sometimes arbitrarily recalled, with only a few months' notice. Digitized by VjOOQIC [6] § 4. — 8;pani8h Money and Measures. Accounts are now officially kept in pesetas and centimos; but in country towns, at coach-offices, and almost everywhere in reckoning small amounts, the real is still the unit of calculation. The dollar of Spain, so well known all over the world, is the Italian \" colonnato,** so called because the arms of Spain are supported between the two pillars of Hercules. The ordinary Spanish name is duro. They are often, however, termed in banking and mercantile transactions peso fuerte, to distinguish them from the imaginary peso^ or smaller dollar of 15 reals only, of which the peseta is the diminutive. The rate of exchange on London varies of course from day to day, and is quoted in the newspaper at so many pence to the dollar. 47 is a very general averse, at ordinary times, and the business-like traveller will glance at the Money-market column before going to the bank. At the above exchange, he should receive 25*60 pes. for every pound, or 255 pes. for a £10 circular note. Occasionally, however, the value of the dollar becomes much depreciated, and in 1891, partly in consequence of the entire withdrawal of gold, as much as 270 or 275 pesetas in Spanish paper were given for £10 sterling. The exchange is always more favour- able in Madrid, Seville, Barcelona, and other commercial centres, than in small ports like Alicante, or towns without commerce, such as Cordova. Travellers hurrying through Spain on their way to Portugal or the south, and unprovided with foreign money, may be glad to know that English sovereigns and bank-notes, or French gold and paper, are taken at their full nominal value, as given in oixr table on p. [79], at the principal railway stations. Measures, — The French metrical decimal system was introduced by royal decree (13 July, 1849), and the metro, kilometro, and litro, arc now the only official measures employed in Spain, although the old Spanish vara (yard), legua (league), and cuartilla (quart), are still often used by the tradespeople and ^asant classes. A m^tre equals 1 yard 3i inches, or 1 vara 7 pulgadas. A kilo- metro = 1093 yards 2 inches, = • 621 of an English mile. A Spanish legua = 5*555 kilometres = 3f English miles. A Spanish vara consists of 3 pi6s (feet), each of 12 pulgadas (inches), each of 12 lineas (lines), and equals 2*782 English feet. The English mile = 1925} Spanish yards. The English foot is 13 Spanish inches, TahU of Kilometres amd Miles. 1 kilometre — 0*62 mile. 20 kilometres = 12-43 miles. 2 kilometres = 1*24 miles. 30 )) = 18-64 „ 3 „ := 1-86 „ 40 )} = 24-86 „ 4 „ = 2*49 „ 50 >» = 31-07 „ 5 „ = 3*11 „ 60 It = 37-28 „ 6 „ = 3*73 „ 70 w = 43-50 „ 7 „ =r 4*35 „ 80 >» = 49-71 „ 8 M = 4*97 „ 90 » = 55-92 „ 9 „ = 5-59 „ 100 >9 = 62-14 „ 10 „ = 6*21 „ r practical purposes, 8 kilomet res = 5 Eng. miles.

The Segovia Cuadra Company's steamers run to Barcelona and all the ports on ihe eastern coast as £ur as Seville; the passages are generally made during the nights, and the days are spent at the various ports. The steamers on their arrival at Spanish ports are soon surrounded with boats to convey passengers on shore. The proper charges per tarif are a peseta for each person, and two reals for every article of luggage not carried in the hand ; a passenger without luggage has to pay two reals for b^g landed, or put on board. The same charge for luggage is repeated for conveyance to the Custom-house (if not at the landing steps;, and agun for porterage to the hotel. Firmness and perfect good-humour are the only possible means of resisting extortion. If you wish to forward luggage or parcels by Spanish coasting steamers, have tiiem carefully directed, and take a receipt for them and forward it per post to your coirespondent, desiring him to send for the articles the moment the steamer arrives, otherwise they will be liable to be left on board or lost.

The Railroad (Ferro Carril) now connects most of the principal cities of Spain (see Map). Whilst in 1848 only 18 Eng. miles of rail were open it may now be estimated that 8500 kilometres are in activity, and 3500 in construction or under concession. The rlys. of Spain were constructed principally by means of French capital, and at an enormous cost. They are, perhaps, the worst constructed and the worst managed lines in the world, but they keep excellent time. Although the pace is slow compared with other parts of Europe, yet the advantage afforded in a quick transit over such dreary regions as the plain of Castile and La Mancha is immense. On most lines only 2 trams run in the 24 hours, and the fine scenenr is often passed in the dark. The stoppages are frequent and long, and the delays at junction stations often wearisome, and of many hours' duration. 16 to 20 m. an hour is the maximum speed, and the average only 10. The speed is restricted by law, on account of the danger incurred by the starting of rails, exposed to the fuU heat of the sun on sandy plams. Some of the best stations are very poor, and the secondary ones are often mere hovels. The extreme filthiness of every place to which railway servants and passengers of every class have access in common is much to be deplored. In all trains a first-class carriage is set apart for ladies only, marked Beservado para Sefloras. A well-ordered closet carriage, one for men and one for women, is attached to most trains. Every train is also bound by the Company's by-laws to carry a first-class non-smoking compartment (reservado para los nofumadores) ; but the privilege is not commonly enjoyed without hard fighting, unless the non-smoker has already taken possession at the starting-point of the train. Railway ^ai*ds, and indeed all officials except the very lowest, invariably travel first-class, and sometimes occupy nearly half the available seats in the carriages. Luggage robberies on railways are not uncommon ; it is therefore better not to put valuables into the trunks which go in the van. Passengers are allowed to take a portmanteau or small amount of luggage in the carriage with them, which, if pressed for time, will be a great convenience, and enable them to avoid ttie long and weary delays at the station before the luggage is got ready. Travellers are advised to buy the official railway guide, published monthly. Quia Ofiddl de los i'erro-CarrileSy price 2 reals. It may be had at the railway stations and libraries.

The economy in railway fares gained by the circular tickets is considerable ; it saves much trouble io taking tickets on the road ; it also enables travellers who have little luggage to atop, on the spxir of the moment, wherever they like. Holders of these tickets are specially cautioned to see that the right coupon is in each case withdrawn by the collector. In Feb. 1885, France and Spain agreed to the construction of two Pyrenean railways by Canfranc in Aragon to Oloron, and by Lerida and Noguera in Catalonia to the French department of Ari^ge. On both lines the tunnels perforating the Pyrenees were to be made at the cost of both countries. It was expected that the Can&ano line would be open in six years, and the Catalan route in eight years. DiligenoeB, Since the introduction of the railway system into Spain, there has been a marked development in the construction of high-roads also ; thus, whilst the total length of roads existing in Spain in 1855 was only 5920 £ng. m., it may be calculated that more than double that number are at the present time open. But even this amount is quite disproportionate to the wants of a country like Spain, which has an area of 126,759,000 statute acres. The old Oaminos Beales (royal roads) — Carreteras GeneraUs — of Spain are also called Arrecifes, from the Arabic word for chaussees, causeways : they are made on the Macadam system, admirably engineered, and kept in good repair. Ordinary but carriageable roads are called caminos carreteros, and are just practicable : bndle-roads are caminos de herra^ dura. By-ways and short cuts are termed trochasy travesias and caminos de atajo, and familiarly and justly called caminos de perdices^ roads for partridges; nor should any man forget the proverb no hay atajo sin trdbajo — there is no short cut without hard work. A ramUa — ^Arabicd ravrd^ sand— serves the double jgurpose of a road in summer for men and beasts, and a river-bed in winter for fish and wild-fowL In traveUing by Diligence (Diligencia), the distances are usually regulated and paid for — not by posts, but by leagues, Ugtms, of 20,000 feet, or 20 to a degree of the meridian, and somewhat less than three miles and a half English, being the nautical league of three geo^phical miles. The oflacial measure of distance is now the French kQo. The country leagues, especially in the wilder and mountainous districts, are calculated more by guesswork than measurement. Generally you may reckon by time rather than distance, the sure test of slow coach- ing, and consider the league a sort of German Stunde ian hour^s work. The term legua is modified by an explanatory epithet. Larga, or long, varies from four to five miles. Regular, a very Spanish word, is used to express a league, or anything else that is neither one thing nor another, something about the regular post league. (7or*a, as it implies, is a short league, three miles. Travelling in the diligencia, odious in itself, is subject to the usual continental drags, hUUteSy &c., previous to starting. The prices are moderate, and vary according to the places : the Berlina (called Coup6 in France)^ is reckoned as 1st class, the Interior (omnibus-shaped) Digitized by V^OO^ ItT § 6. — Horses and Mtdes, [11] as second, and the Cotipe or Banquette as third ; but in fine weather the last-named is by far the best of the three. No English traveller should even dream of entering the Interior. Only half the quantity of luggage (16 kilos = 33 lbs.) is allowed by diligence that is allowed by railway, and a heavy charge made for all extra. Be careful as to direc- tions on your luggage, and have it all registered ; and take your place in time too, as the dUigencias are often crowded, especially during summer. The passengers are imder the charge of a conductor, the mayoral ; meals are provided at the coaches* own baiting inns or para- dores ; they are sufficient in quantity, endurable in cookery, and reason- able in charges. As a pedestrian tour for pleasure is a thing utterly unknown in Spain, except in the northern provinces, excursions on horseback are truly national and preferable, and bring the stranger in close contact with Spanish man and nature. Horses or mules may be hired in most lai^e cities, or the traveller to whom time is no object may join the caravans of the regular muleteers and carriers, who ply from fixed places to others. Those who can only ride on an English saddle should procure one before starting, and every man will do well to bring out a good pair of English spurs, with some spare sets of rowels, and attend to their efficient sharpness, for the hide of a Spanish beast is hard and un- impressionable. Ladies must not expect to find English saddles in any but the large towns. The native saddles used by women, hamugas, are comfort- able ; they consist of a sort of chair, with a footboard to rest the feet. It cannot be said that the animals owned by Spanish miQeteers are pleasant to ride, nor indeed are the hacks (hacas) and cattle usually let for hire much better ; to those, therefore, who propose making an extensive riding tour, especially in the provinces of Qalicia, Estre- madura, and Aragon, the better plan is to perform it on their own animals, the masters on horses, tne attendants on mules. The chief points in such journeys are to take as few things as possible : trunks — the impedimenta of travellers — are thorns in their path, who pass more lightly and pleasantly by sending the heavier luggage on from town to town ; \" attend also to the provend,\" as the commissariat has ever been tJie difficulty in hungry and thirsty Spain. Each master should have his own Alforjas or saddle-bags, in which he will stow away whatever is absolutely necessary for his own immediate wants and comforts, strapping his cloak or mania over it. The servant should be mounted on a stout mule, and provided with strong and capacious capachos de esparto, or peculiar baskets made of this useful Spanish grass ; one side may be dedicated to the wardrobe, the other to the larder ; and let neither master nor man omit to take a hota, or leather wine-bottle, or forget to keep it full ; spare sets of shoes for horses and mules, with nails and hammer, are also essential. When once off the beaten tracks, those travellers who make up their minds to find nothing on the road but discomfort will be the least likely to be disappointed, while by being prepared and forearmed they wiU overcome every difficulty — honibre prevenido, nuncafui vencido, a little foresight and provision gives small trouble and ensures great comfort. The sooner all who start on riding tours can speak Spanish the better, as polyglot travel- Digitized by V^OOy It: [12] § 7.— Post Office and Letters. ling servants are apt to be rogues. In the absence of a trustworthy courier a retired cavahry soldier is a good man to take, as he under- stands horses, and knows how to forage in districts where rations are rare. Few soldiers are more sober, patient, and enduring of fatigue than the Spanish ; eight reals a day, food, lodging, and some dreas, with a tip at the end, will be ample pay. A Spanish servant (whether professional courier or soldier) must be treated with civility, and abusive speech avoided. Equestrians in the Pyrenees, who have hired horses in Spain, and cross the frontier, must pay duty on the animals when they return, unless they have previously applied to the CoDector of Customs, who will have the horses examined, and grant a document for their identification. They may then remain out of the coimtry for six months, but must return through the same custom- house which granted the pass. No guarantee need be given, and anybody may take back the norses if provided with the document. It is desirable for the traveller to carry with him some simple medi- cines. English prescriptions are not readily made up in Sx>ain. For dysentery the usual Spanish remedy is rice-water, which sometimes stops the diarrhoea. It is well also to have a supply of tea and French brandy, and small metal teapjot, neither of these being procurable except in the larger towns. An india-rabber bath will be found a great comfort. § 7.— Post Office and Lbttrbs. Post Offices and Letters, and the general correspondence of Sx>ain, are tolerably well regulated. A single letter, una carta senciHa^ must not exceed 15 gramos ; the charge S>r postage increases with the weight. The EngUsh system has been introduced ; a uniform charge — by weight — irrespective of distance, prevails over Spain. The stamps are oaDed seUos, Letters to any part of Spain pay 16 cent. ; to Portugal, by a strange anomaly, 10 cent. To France and England, 25 centimes for the same weight. Postage stamps cannot be bought at the post-office ; they must be procured at the Government cigar and tobacco dep6ts (Estaneos), which are distinguished by having the Government arms over the door. Pamphlets and papers fastened hke ours, with an open band or faja for directing, are charged to any part of Spain or her colonies, 1 cent. ; to England and France, 6 cent, for every 50 grammes. Post-cards for any part of Spain, 10 cent. Letters for inside a town, whatever their weight, 10 cent. Letters from or to England must be prepaid, or they wiS be charged double postage, A registered letter requires a stamp of 75 centimes. Travellers may have their letters addressed to them at the post-office, to Lista de Correos (= Poste Restante), where the passport is usually asked for before the letter is delivered. Prudent tourists should urge home correspondents, especially their fair ones, to direct simply, avoiding the termination Esq.^ and to write the surname in large and legible characters. The best mode, while travelling in Spain, is to beg them to adopt the Spanish form — \" Senor Don Plantj^enet Smytheville.\" The traveller i^ould always put his own letters into the post-office, Digitized by V^OO^ltT § S.— Telegrams. § 9.— i§?am«A Inna. [13] and himself affix the stamps on them. When settled in a town he may, by paying a small fixed smn to the post-office clerks, have a separate division, apartadOf and an earlier delivery of his letters. Letters from the Peninsula directed to a private address or to an hotel, are left by a postman, eartero, who is entitled to charge 6 cent, for each letter, on deHvery. It may be useful to remember l^t the standard weight of a 6 cent, piece is 5 gramos. § 8.— Telegraph Office and Telegbams. The telegraph-lines in Spain are all in the hands of the State. The offices are open day and night, and the staff of officials employed are usually intelligent and trustworthy. Parties must procure telegraph stamps from an Estanco, or at the telegraph-office in large towns, of tne value of the message to be sent ; these stamps must be handed to the clerk to be affixed by him to the despatch. The telegram may be written in French, English, German, Italian, and Portuguese ; despatches from other countries to any town in Spain can be addressed Foste restante, in which case they must be called for at the Telegraph-office just as a letter would be called for at the Post-office. A telegram to Oreat Britain costs for each word .. •• •• 45 centt.

Inns in Spain are of yarious denominations ; and as they are constantly changing, it is not easy to give their names in every small and out-of-the- way place. 1st. is the Hotel, or Fonda (the Oriental Fundack), which is the assumed equivalent to our hotel, as in it lodging and board are furnished. The name Fonda is, however, also employed to denote a refreshment-room at the rly. stat. The hotels in the chief towns imitate French cooking, and the food is almost invariably good. 2nd. is the Posada, in which, strictly speaking, only lodging is provided; 3rd. comes the Venta, which is a sort of inferior jposada of the country, as distinguished from the town; at the Venta the traveller finds the means of cooking whatever provisions he has brought with him, or can forage on the spot. These khans are generally larderless, although the Ventero, as in Von Quijote*s time, will answer, when asked what he has got, Eay de todo, there is everything; but de lo que V. trae, \"of what you bring with you,\" must be understood. The traveller, when he arrives at one of these Posadas, in rarely- visited places, should be courteous and liberal in using little conven- tional terms of civility, and not begin by ordering and hurrying people about; he will thus be met more than half-way, and obtain the best quarters and accommodation that are to be had. Spaniards, who are not to be driven by a rod of iron, may be tickled and led by a straw. Treat them as cahdUeros, and you put tiiem on their mettle at once, when they generally behave themselves as such. No man who values a Digitized by Google night's rest will omit on arrival to look at once after hi& bed; a cigar for the mozo, a compliment to the mucliacha, and a tip, propina or gratiflcacioncita, seldom fail to conciliate and secure comfort. The Cantina is a minor class of venta, and often nothing more than a mere hut, run up with reeds or branches of trees by the roadside, at which water, wine, and bad aguardiente (aniseed, true aqua ardens) are to be sold. In out-of-the-way districts the traveller, in the matter of inns, will seldom be perplexed with any difficulty of selection ; the golden rule will be to go to the one where the diligence puts up— A7 Farador de las Diligencias, The simple direction, \" vamos a la Posada,\" let us go to THE inn, will be enough in those small towns where the name of an inn is not given in the Handbook, for the question in such out-of-the-way places is rather, Hay posada y donde eatdf (Is there an inn, and where is it?) than Which is the best inn? Spanish inns are generally clean ; the best are kept by Italians or Swiss. Water is generally abundant, and Spaniards drink very freely of it, but it is apt to disagree with foreigners, until acclimatized. The common table-wine is naturally very alcoholic, and is often strongly fortified with spirit, to preserve it during the hot days of sunmier. In the north, where it is kept in pig-skins, it tastes so abominably of the pitch used to stop up cracks in the leather, as to be utterly undrinkable. Some of the finest natural wines of Spain, such as those of Navarre and Toro, are thus absurdly poisoned. A better Wine is the Valdepefias, which can be had for an extra charge of 4 reals per bottle. It is very strong, and much adulterated. On the whole, the best wines to order are the imitation clarets, now largely bottled in the neighbourhood of Bilbao, and sent thence all over Spain. Good specimens are the Biq)'a Clarete, Marquis de Biscal, and Marques de Lecanda. I'he latter comes from Valladolid. These cost from IJ pes. to 3 pes., according to dista-nce and octroi duties, &c,, and are obtainable as far south as Tangier. Similar light and palatable wines are bottled at Valencia. In country towns, especially in the north, the inn is often called Hospedaje, or Casa de Huespedes, simply in order to evade the higher tax paid by the Fonda, The charges at native inns are very reasonable, and have the great advantage of being fixed at so much a day, without any irritating extras. A Spanish landlord would scorn to demand payment of his guest for a bed-room candle. 30 reals (7i pes.) is a fair price in the southern or central provinces; In the north it is often as low as 24 reals. Early breakfast is sometimes charged separately. The Spaniards take nothing in the morning except a tiny cup of chocolate, as thick as syrup, and eaten, not drunk, by means of a piece of bread. A glass of water is invariably brought vrith it, sometimes accompanied by a light frothy preparation of sugar (azucarillo). At 10 or 11 there is a substantial luncheon (the French (U/euner), which invariably begins with eggs, poached, boiled, or in the form of an omelette (tortilla) \\ the traveller is often asked which of these he prefers. 5 or 6 is the usual hour for dinner, but in summer-time these meals are both postponed till 12 and 7 respectively, or even later. Half a day is commonly charged for any fraction, however small, of an uncompleted day. Smoking at the table dlidte, except perhaps in a few first-class hotels, is everywhere general, to clean the mouth between the courses. Digitized by Google § 10. — Spanish Bohhers — Police — Ctml Guards. [15] In Seville, Barcelona, Granada, Cordova, and Madrid, the charges are dearer, and in aU places where establishments are set up on what is called the English or French system, foreign prices are demanded ; but travellers are advised always to inquire at hotels in Spain what they are to pay. This observation especially applies to the first-class hotels at Madrid, which are very expensive. Travellers should also be warned never to set foot in any boat or carriage or omnibus before it is distinctly understood exactly how much they are to pay for the conveyance of themselves and all their baggage, and that the sum named includes carrying the luggage into and out of the conveyance. They must not trust to the word \" Tarif,\" for it often encloses a small footnote, which states that if passengers or luggage are conveyed to any domicilio, the charge is double. If not certain of the hotel, it is a good plan to leave the luggage at the public ofl&ce ; and when the hotel has been chosen, send for it. Those who propose remaining some weeks at a hotel can make special terms, or can go into a Boarding-house, Casa de Hvsspedes, where they will have the best opportunity of learning the Spanish language, and obtaining an idea of the national manners and habits. These esta- blishments are constantly advertised in the local newspapers, and the houses themselves may be known externally by a white paper ticket attached to the extremity of one of the window balconies ; for if paper be placed in the middle, it only means \"unfurnished lodgings to let here.\" The traveller will always be able to learn from the (>)nsul or his banker, or from any respectable inhabitant, which of these boarding- houses enjoys the best reputation. Mosquito-nets are indispensable during June, July, August, and Sep- tember. The bedsteads in first-class inns are usually furnished with them, but not in the country inns. The linen is generally clean, but it is always well to be supplied with Persian powder during the sum- mer months. The bed-rooms in large towns are carpeted in winter; they seldom have fireplaces, but in winter a brazier is lighted. The domestic arrangements in general in the Spanish hotels and lodgings are very bad. The only way to effect any improvement is to complain incessantly to the servants, and insist upon cleanliness whenever necessary. Cafes and dmbfl. — ^Almost every Spanish town possesses a Cafe Suizo, often belonging to an enterprising Swiss, Matossi, and generally good. Every town of importance has also at least one Casino, a sort of social club, supplied with newspapers, billiard room, &c., to which strangers are welcomed with great courtesy. Should they be making a long stay, they may easily become members on payment of a small monthly sub- scription. All but the dullest and most backward of the country towns have a Bull-ring (Piaza de Toros), where fights take place in August, or on local holidays. These three institutions being almost universal in Spain, it has not been thought necessary in every case to call special attention to them, while treating of each several town. § 10. — Spanish Robbebs— Police— Civil Guabds. Undoubtedly on the long highways of a thinly-peopled land, acci- dents may occur; but the regular £«id really formidable robbers havo ahnost disappeared on the high roads, in consequence of the institution Digitized by Google [16] § 11. — Population and Revenue. of a body of well-armed men, admirably disciplined (part mounted) as Gens-d'armes, who are stationed on the principal routes as escorts and patrols. They are called Guardias dvues^ to distinguish them from military and rurai guards. This noble body of men is .composed of 20,000 Foot and 6000 Horse Guards, or Gendarmerie, first organised 1844-46: they are dressed in black tunic and trousers of the same colour, with light buff-coloured belts. The Ouardias dvilea are imder military law; their punishments and penalties exceptionally severe. Their esprits de corps is good. Their ranks are composed of the high- character and long-service men of the Spanish army ; and of cadets from the College, near Madrid, where all the orphan children of Civil Guards who have died in the pursuance of their duty are educated, free of expense, for the force. The duties of the Civil Guards are much the same as those of the Irish Constabulary, whom they greatly resemble in organisation. They are stationed, in couples, in every town and small village, and in small barracks along every frequented high-road, and in squads of from 25 to 60 in Spain's larger cities. They are police^ without being spies; soldiers, without being liable to be called on for service beyond the Peninsula. They perform their duties as police most effectively. Two of them meet every train at every station, and check everything that is wrong, as well by their presence and morale as by the strong arm of the law. They escort prisoners from one prison to another, and, knowing how imcertain in its action is Spanish law, they constantly shoot down a murderer, taken red-handed, or trying to escape when on the march with them from prison to prison. They have done more to establish order in Spain than any other body. The men are 6 feet 8 inches in stature, well-set and powerful. Their head is a General in the army, living in Madrid, with the title of Director-General All members of the force mmt read and write. Promotion from the ranks is the rule, not the exception. They live in barracks, mess together, and associate but little with the outer world. The force supports a weekly periodical, called Boletin oficidl de la Ouardia CivU, first started in 1858. The rules of the corps are arranged in the Cartilla, gambling being entirely prohibited. ^ The couples engaged in patrolling the roads must wjdk twelve paces apart from one another, so as not to be both surprised at once.\" The cavalry carry heavy dragoon swords of Toledo make, and revolvers and short carbines ; the foot-soldiers Eemington rifle and bayonet, and sometimes revolvers. The safety of property in Spain may, without exaggeration, be said to depend on this most excellent force. No Civil Guard is allowed to accept a reward, however great be his service to you. In cases of difficulty, the traveller should inquire for the Casa Guartel de la Ouardia OivU, and there make his report to some responsible official § 11, — ^Population and Rbvenub— Educational Statistics, &o. According to the last census taken in 1877, the popdation of Spain numbers over 16,731,570. Of this number 679,000 could read only; 4,000,000 could read and write; and 12,000,000 could neither write nor read. Bevenue for the year 1882-1883. This has been estimated (officially) to 760,291,224 pesetaSi or francs; the State expenses are estimated Digitized by V^OOy ItT § 12. — Hints to Invalids — Climate, [17] (ofi&cially) at 792,122,953 pesetas. (See ' Presupuestos Generalea del Estado,' 1882.) The Eevenue has always been badly collected, and at an enormous cost. EveiT impediment has been placed in the way of intended investors of capital in the Peninsula. But in spite of every obstacle which successive governments — each (if possible) worse than its pre- decessor — could throw in the way of Spanish progress, that progress has been most marked during the last 20 years. The annual death-rate is 3 per cent., and among children 24 per cent., the latter high figure being partly due to the fact that no Spanish mother who can afford a wet nurse ever dreams of suckling her own child. In point of size, Spain ranks 5th among the great European states ; in population 7th, but in density 11th. As regards natural produce, the country stands 14th for cereals, but 4th for wines, yielding 40,500,000 gallous a year. Spain takes a high rank as a mining country, but is comparatively deficient in coal, which prevents her ever becoming a great manuf ac« turing kingdom, the total yield not much exceeding 1,000,000 tons. Of all the states in Europe, Spain is the most prolific in lead, copper, iron pyrites, and sulphur ; the second in manganese, zinc, and phosphate of lime ; and the fourth in iron ore. According to the last return in 1878, the number of schools was 29,038, and of pupils, 1,633,288 ; as compared with 13,334 and 652,163 respectively in 1850. . § 12.— Hints to Invalids— Climate. The superiority of the climate of the South of Spain over other regions of Europe has been ably demonstrated by various medical writers.t Independently of a more southern latitude, the geometrical configuration of Spain is superior. While the Apennines, the backbone of Italy, stretching N. to S., offer no barrier to northern cold, the sierras of Spain, running E. and W., afford complete shelter to the littoral strips. Free as a whole from malaria, dryness is the emphatic quality of the climate. Huelva, Murcia, and Malaga may be pronounced tne most favoured winter stations in Europe. As Spain itself is a conglomeration of elevated mountains, the tree- less, denuded interior, scorching and calcined in summer, keen, cold and windblown in winter, is prejudicial to the invaUd; the hygienic characteristics of the maritime coasts to the N.W. from Vigo to San Sebastian are soothing and sedative— a relaxing influence prevailing as the French frontier is approached ; the coast- line from Barcelona to Cadiz is more bracing and exhilarating. For all this, at the present time there are few towns in Spain where invalids can pass a winter with comfort or safety. Malaga enjoys a mild winter climate, and the same immunity from frost as does the Biviera from Nice to San Remo ; but it is not a clean or healthy city. The drainage is as defective as can be. There is, however, an excellent hotel, and a choice of suburban villas abundantly supplied with pure water. Murcia in summer is a desert, except where water-springs and irrigation create an oasis, where palms flourish in forest growth. In t See Dr. Bwinet's ' Climate of the South of Europe.* • Chimgo of qimate,' *c., by D. J.

The wines of Navarre, Valde- pefias, and Aragon are cheap and wholesome. The cuisine, in a country where people eat to live, not live to eat, will indeed keep body and soul together, but will tempt no weak and wearied stomach to repletion. The peptic benefits of cUmate on the natives are evident by the way they digest an oil, vinegar, and vegetable diet, and survive chocolate, sweetmeats, and bile-creating compounds. The sustaining effect is proved by the untiring activity of the very under-fed masses, where many seem to live on air, like chameleons. To be always able to bask in the open air, to throw physic to the dogs, to watch the sun, the stars, the country, the blue Mediterranean, and the people, with the satisfac- tion of every day getting better, are consolations and occupations sufficient. § 13.— Mineral Springs and Sea-Bathing. These are very numerous, and have always been much frequented. In every part of the Peninsula such names as Caldas, the Roman Cahdas, and Alhama, the Arabic Al-hdmun, denote the continuance of baths, in spite of the changes of nations and language. From Al- hamun, the Hhamman of Cairo, the name of our comfortable Hum- mums is derived ; but very different are the Spanish accommodations, which are mostly inadequate, and inconvenient. The Junta Sup^ema de Sanidad, or Official Board of Health, has published a list of the names of the principal baths, and their proper seasons. At each a medical superintendent resides, who is appointed by Government. The most important of these estabhshments, providing a certain amount of comfort for invalids, and enjoying a good situation, are — Sa7ita Agueda, Alzola^ Arrechavaleta and Cestona (in the Basque Pro- vinces), Caldas de Oviedo (Asturias), Ontaneda (Santander), Fitero (Navarra), Fanticosa (Huesca), Caldas de Mombuy and la Puda (Cata- lufia), Alhama de Aragon, Lanjaron (Granada), Garratraca (Malaga). In the Almanaque de Espana, easily to be found everywhere, a list is also given of the properties of these medicinal waters, their locality and season. Sea-bathing, during the summer and autumn months, is very enjoy- able on the N.W. coasts of Spain. The most fashionable sea-side resort is St. Sebastian, which is frequented by the best Madrid society. Sardinero, near Santander, is also much resorted to. Zarauz, Deva, and Saturraran are more suited to quiet people who wish for economy. Gijon is the most fashionable sea-bathing locahty of Asturias ; but at the hamlets on the coast, Luanco, Luarca, &c., the bathing is very pleasant, the prices charged for lodgings most moderate, providing an agreement is made ; the food, salmon, milk, and excellent fruits and vegetables most abundant ; and the artist or student will find great enjoyment in the grand scenery and picturesque people. In GaHcia, Coruna and Vigo are becoming popular with bathers from Madrid. On the shores of the Mediterranean there are numerous bathing establishments— at Barcelona, Arenys del Mar, a beautiful spot, Ali- Digitized by VjOOQIC § 14. — Tours in Spain, [19j cante, Valencia, Malaga, and Cadiz. The water of the Mediterranean is veiy different in temperature and chemical properties to that of the Atlantic. For some constitutions these baths are highly recommended, but the heat at those locaUties is so intense that autumn should be chosen. Wheeled bathing-machines are not generally used in Spain, one of the few exceptions being at Las Arenas, near Bilbao ; thatched huts, or albercas, supply their place. § 14. — ^TouRS IN Spain. Although the ravages of war, and the acts of the Gotho-Spaniards themselves, have destroyed and disfigured many of the most interesting relics of the Moor, yet the remains of that elegant, industrious, and enlightened people are still, both in number and importance, quite unequalled in Eiurope : they will long continue to furnish subjects of interest and curiosity to travellers in the Peninsula. Before pointing out objects to be observed in Spain, it may be as well to mention what is not to be seen, as there is no worse loss of time than finding this out oneself, after weary chase and wasted hours ; and first let us advise the mere Idler and Man of Pleasure to go rather to Paris, Vienna, St. Petersburg, Florence, or Rome, than to Madrid and Spain, for Iberia is not a land of fleshly comforts, or of social, sensual civihzation. Oh ! dura tellus Iberice ! — God there sends the meat, and the Evil One cooks. Then again, those who expect to find well- garnished arsenals, hbraries provided with the popular literature of the day, restaurants, charitable or literary institutions, polytechnic galleries, pale-ale breweries, and similar appHances and appurtenances of a high state of commercial civilization, had better stay at home. Life in the country towns and villages of Spain is a Bedouin Oriental existence. Madrid itself is but a dear, second-rate European capital. The seaports are, however, more amusing ; and the Alameda, the church show, and the bull-fight, will be best enjoyed in the Southern provinces, along the coast line between Cadiz and Barcelona. For scenery, quaint scraps of architecture, and the stud;^ of an interesting people, the hilly districts of the north are most deserving of attention. Spain may perhaps interest a political economist, as offering a fine example of errors to be avoided, and a grand field for theories and plans of future reform and ameHoration. Here is a land where Nature has lavished her prodigality of soil and climate, and which man has for the last four centuries been endeavouring to counteract. El cielo y suelo es hueno, el entresuelo mdlo. Here the tenant for life and the occupier of the peninsular entresol have long abused, with incurious apathy, the goods with which the gods have provided him, and have E reserved the country as a terra incognita to naturalists, and every ranch of ists and ologists. Those, however, who aspire to the romantic, who wish to revel in the sublime and beautiful, will find subjects enough in wandering with lead-pencil and note-book through this singular country, this land of the green valley and ashj mountain, of the boundless plain and the broken sierra ; through Elysian gardens of the vine, the olive, the orange, and the aloe, and trackless, silent, uncultivated wastes, the heritage of the bustard and bittern. Striking, Digitized by Google [20] § 14.— r/*6 Grand Tour. indeed, and sudden is the change, in flying from the polished mono- tony of England to the racy freshness of this still original country, where antiquity treads on the heels of to-day ; where Paganism dis- putes the very altar with Christianity ; where a want of much that is honest or merciful is blended with the most devoted heroic virtues ; where ignorance and erudition stand in violent and striking contrast. In suggesting lines of routes in Spain, a whole year would not suffice to exhaust the objects of natural history, antiquarian, ecclesiological, and fine-art interest. A complete tour — the grand tour — may, however, be made in five months by those to whom time is an important con- sideration. a. The Grand Toub.

March, April, and May are the most agreeable months for travelling, fhence to October there is intense heat, an arid landscape, and intoler- able sun-glare, except in the northern provinces, whore the country is in full beauty in summer. The following circuit— comprehending the most interesting cities and scenery in Spain (Galicia and Navarre excepted) — may be made in eight weeks, allowing of three days in each of the cities of Granada, SeviUe, Toledo, Madrid, and Burgos ; two days in Barcelona, Zaragoza, Tarragona, Valencia, Ronda, Gibraltar, Segovia, and Salamanca; and Digitized by Google § 14. — A Two-Months' and Biding Tour.

The best season is April, May, and June, or even earlier in Andalucia and Murcia. The whole country is then in the bloom of spring, and the climate temperate and most enjoyable. In winter all the bridle-roads are a sea of mud, and the going execrable, whilst in summer the heat renders travelling by day almost impossible. Autumn is likewise undesirable, as the whole country side wears an arid and tawny appearance after the summer heat and dust. In May and June of 1880 and 1881 I rode through nearly the whole of the two Castiles, and the Pyrenean portions of Catalonia and Aragon. No expedition can be more enjoyable, and in no country will one meet with greater courtesy and civility. Owing to the recollections of the great war, an Englishman is universally well received in country towns and villages ; a Frenchman the contrary. A sine qua nan is to speak Castellano fluently. Otherwise intending visitors had better stop at home, save their time and money, and keep their tempers, which they will most assuredly lose if they cannot talk the language. The next thing is to obtain a good servant. I have fdways had the same Oastilian every year, and urefer them to Anda- lucians or Qalicians — the latter the drudges of tne Peninsula. If you treat a Oastilian with proper respect, no servant in the world becomes more devoted to his master, or watchful of his employer's interests. As to expenses, the best place to engage your servant and animals is some minor country town. When in the Castiles I always go to Aranda de Duero, between Burgos and Madrid. In such a spot an Englishman is a rara avis indeed, and piices have not been raised or the natives spoilt by tourists. If hired for not less than a couple of months, your servant's wages should not exceed 125. a week, hire of a mule for him and horse for yourself about 2?. 10s. per week. At the commercial hotels in large cities, such as San Sebastian, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Burgos, Valladolid, Avila, Segovia, Toledo, and the like, the universal charge is 6s. per day for yourself, and 3s. for servants, without any extras whatever. This includes chocolate and bread in the early morning, an excellent breakfast at any hour between 11 A.1I. and 1 P.H.,an eaually good dinner between 7 and 8 p.m., good red wine ad lihitum, and a comfortable bed. In Madrid, at the Fonda Peninsular, Digitized by Google [22] § 14. — Biding Tour in Spain. the charge for the same accommodation is 6s. 6d. a day for yourself, and 3s. 2d. for servant. On the other hand, in country towns and villages it seldom exceeds 4s. per diem for master, and 2s. for man. Fodder for the two animals should be Is. a day. As regards distances, you will find the country saying of una legua una hora (one league, one hour) pretty exact if you take the good going with the bad. A standard league is 3-45 English miles, and from 20 to 40 miles a day can be done according to the best available halting-places, resting one or two days a week. I always get under way between 6 and 7 a.m., after the morn- ing chocolate, travel till about noon, when a fountain or stream, with a shady tree or two handy, is resorted to for the alfresco breakfast and siesta, which occupy till 2 p.m. Then on the road again till 7 or 8 p.m., when one should arrive at the quarters for the night. Spanish horaes never trot or canter, but invariably go at an amble. Hence the com- fortable albardilla, or saddle of the country, is preferable to, and much less fatiguing than, an English one. Likewise abhor an English great- coat, which can never be made to fold and pack properly on the saddle- Eeak, and invest in a graceful and sleeveless Castihan mania. All aggage must be carried in your own and servant's saddle-bags. Con- sequently every drachm of weight and inch of space saved is of vital importance. Two or three enamelled iron plates and half-a-dozen knives, forks, and spoons, packed in a roll-up case, are indispensable. An English picnic basket is not worth the wicker-work it is composed of, as it will not travel in saddle-bags. Two leathern wine-bottles of the country are taken, one holding about three pints for current use, and another two gallons kept in reserve. Oat of the large towns pro- visions should always be carried. A young lamb, fowl, rabbit, or hare is the best meat. The bread is excellent, and don't forget some lettuces, oil, and vinegar for a salad, and raisins for dessert when fresh fruit is not in season. I always replenish my provender-bags at every available opportunity, and see that enough meat is cooked overnight for the next day's picnic breakfast. In the provincial posadas, ventas, and mesones, an Enghshraan must remember that he will be received by no smirking landlord, bowing waiter, or courtesying chambermaid ; nor will he find the comforts and conveniences he does on this side of the Pyrenees. Soap and a hand looking-glass must be carried with you. Riding is the only comfortable way of visiting many of the most interesting remains and picturesque portions of the Peninsula. The railways only connect large cities. Diligences generally arrive and depart at some abnormal hour of the night, and the stuffiness and jolting of them is intolerable. — ff.F. W. **It has been for centuries a fixed idea with Spaniards that roads should be left to be made by the feet or hoofs of the men and beasts which use them. The old highways which the Moors constructed in their own Eastern fashion, with sharp but well-connected paving- stones, bard to foot passengers, but marvellously safe for the iron- shod cattle, are now in the south of Spain not only no help, but a great encumbrance, long neglect having dismantled them, and scattered the disjointed stones all over the sluicy paths, so as to make them stumbling-blocks at every step, slipping and rolling under the treading foot, often just on the most arduous and precipitous spots on your way.\" — Qallmga.

The following is a pleasant long-vacation trip for the angler, the pedestrian, or the water-colour painter. June. e. Shooting and FiSEUNa Tours. Shooting, — Although game is not so universally preserved in Spain as among ourselves, yet it is abundant ; Nature, by covering the earth with aromatic brushwood in vast extents of uninhabited, uncultivated land, has afforded excellent cover to the wild beasts of the field and fowls of the air. Near Cadiz, Seville, and Madrid, some of the land- owners and farmers preserve the game on their own estates ; on other lands, near towns, the ^me is poached and destroyed at all seasons, more for pot considerations than for sport ; but wherever the lords of creation are rude and rare, the ferce naturce are abundant, and take care of themselves. In the neighbourhood of the Picos de Europa (Rte. 10), and the Vierzo (Rte. 46), bears are not uncommon ; and in Galicia there are plenty of wolves. Spain was always the land of the rabbit (conefo), wmch the Phoenicians saw here for the first time, and hence some have traced the origin of the name Hispania to the Sevhan, or rabbit of the Hebrew. This animal figured on the early coins ot the cuniculosce Celti Iherice. Large ships freighted with them were regularly sent from Cadiz for the supply of Rome. The rabbit is still the favourite shooting of Spaniards, who look invariably to the larder. Pheasants are rare : a bird requiring artificial feeding cannot be expected to thrive in a country where half the population is underfed. Red-legged partridges and hares are most plentiful. Thousands are exported every year to France. The mouths of the great rivers swarm with aquatic birds. In Andalucia the multitude of woodcocks is incredible. There is very little difl&culty in procuring leave to shoot in Spain ; a licence is required of natives, but foreigners may carry arms for sporting purposes with a permit^ best obtained from the Spanish consulate in London. The moment a Spaniard gets out of town he shoulders a gun, for the custom of going armed is immemorial. Game is usually divided into great and smfidl; the Caza mayor includes deer, venados, wild boars, yava/ts, and the chamois tribe, cobras montesas : by Caza menor is understood foxes, rabbits, partridges, and such-like * * small deer.*' Winter fowl is abundant wherever there is water, and the flights of quails and woodcocks, codornices y gaUinetaSy are quite marvellous. The Englishman will find shooting in the neighbourhood of Seville and Gibraltar. Fishing, — ^The lover of the angle will fin1l virgin rivers in Spain, that Digitized by V^OO^ ItT [24] § 14. — Religious-Festival and Artistic Tours. jumble of mountains, down the bosoms of which they flow ; most of these abound in trout, and those which disembogue into the Bay of Biscay, in salmon. As good tackle is not to be procured in Spain, the angler will bring out everything from England. The best localities are La Granja, Palencia, Avila, Cuenca, and the whole country from El Vierzo, GaUcia, the Asturias, the Basque provinces, and Pyrenean valleys. /. A Keligious-Fbstival Tour. Beligion has long been mixed up most intimately in every public, private, and social relation of Spain, as in all Catholic countries. The priesthood in Spain have, however, lost a great deal of their influence ; the enforced banishment of the holy orders, consequent upon the popular emeute of 1834, was followed by the royal decree of the 17th July, 1867, which abolished the innumerable holidays and saints' days, with the exception of Christmas Day, All Saints, All Souls, St. Peter and St. Paul, St. James, together with seven others held in honour of the Virgin. The church ceremonials, on great days, although now much shorn of their original splendour, are still very grand, and should always be visited, and especially when celebrated in honour of the tutelar saint or miracle of any particular district : local costumes and manners will be best studied at the Fiestas y Bomerias, the Festivals and Pilgrimages to some high place or shrine, and at the Veladas, the Wakes or Vigils, the German Kirchweihe^ which in a fine climate are at once attractive and picturesque. Akin to these are the Ferias or fairs, a word which also has a double meaning for the Spaniards, who, imitating the Moors at Mecca, have always been permitted to combine a little traflfic with devotion. These local festivities have, however, sadly fallen off from the large attendance they had on their first establishment. The principal local saints, sites of pilgrimage, and leading fairs will be mentioned in their respective places : travellers curious in these fes- tivals should endeavour to be at Valencia^ April 5 ; at Andujar, April 28; Madrid, May 15 ; Bonda, May 20 ; and Santiago, July 25 ; and should always remember to be in some great city during the Holy Week or Semana Santa (Seville is the best), and during Corpus Christi, a moveable feast which takes place the first Thursdav after Trinity Sunday, and is celebrated everywhere in Spain with great pomp, especially at Seville, Granada, Valencia, Barcelona, and Toledo. The services connected with the dead on the days of All Saints and All Souls in the beginning of November deserve notice ; also the fes- tivities of Christmas and Carnival time, which are more joyous, and very national and peculiar. 9- Ronda.

The natural history of Spain has yet to be really investigated and described. This indeed is a subject worthy of all who wish to \" book something new,\" and the soil is almost virgin. The harvest is rich, and, although labourers have long been wanting, able pioneers have broken the ground, and a zealous band is following. The great extent and peculiar conformation of the Peninsula offer every possible scope to the geologist and botanist. The damp valleys of the Asturias and the western provinces combine the varieties of Wales and Switzerland ; the central portions contain the finest cereal regions in the world ; while the mountains of Andalucia, covered with eternal snow, furnish an entire botanical range, from the hardiest lichen to the sugar-cane which flourishes at their bases : vast districts of dehesas^ or abandoned tracts, bear in spring-time the aspect of a hot-house growing wild : such is the profusion of flowers which waste their sweets, noted and gathered but imperfectly, in this Paradise of the wild bee, this garden of weeds.t The eastern and southern portions of Spain should not be visited before May, or the northern much before June. t. Antiquarian Tours. The Peninsula may be divided into regions which contain peculiar objects of interest. The vestiges of epochs run in strata, according to the residence of the different nations who have occupied Spain ; thus the Roman, Moorish, and Gotho-Spaniard periods are marked by evidences distinguishing and indehble as fossils. Boman antiquities are to be met with in almost the whole of the Peninsula, but the student will find the following localities most worth visiting. (A) Roman Antiquities. Ronda. Avila. Malaga. J.«on.

Santiago, Oviedo, Pamplona, and Barcelona, may be chosen as head- quarters for ecclesiological excursions of the greatest interest. As a general rule, the student should carefully examine the metro- politan cathedral of each see, as it will be usually found to furnish the type of the minor collegiate and parochial churches within the diocese ; and although a general homogeneous style marks architectural periods throughout the Peninsula, yet architecture, like dialects and costume, has its localisms and provincialisms, which are very pronounced in Spain. Hours fw visiting Churches, — Some churches are open through the day, except from 12 to 2 or 3, when they are closed. Parish churches close later than others. Churches attached to convents seldom remain open later than 9 or 10. Some cathedrals remain open all dav, others are shut at 12. The proper time to see the coro and side chapels is after high mass, which is usually at 9 o'clock, or in the afternoon. Churches may be seen when closed by sending for the keys, but it entails trouble and delay, besides a special fee to the sacristen, and another to the lad who fetches him. The stranger should be made acquainted with some of the leading dispositions and technical terms, as regards the Cathedrals of Spain, which necessarily form a leading item in the \"what to observe\" of intelligent investigators, and one especial object of this Handbook. The exteriors are often surrounded with a long platfoi*m, which, if ascended by steps, is called a gradus, \" grees \" ; the principal front is frequently left unfinished, first in order to disarm the evil eye, and next to serve as a constant pretext for begging pious contributions for its completion. TTie western entrance commonly presents the chief fa9ade, and is called facJiada principal ; the nave, wave, is supported by piers, pUastraSy from whence springs the roof, Idveda, The aisles (alas, wings) are called lateraleSf co-laterales ; at the doorways is &pila, stoup, or b^nitier, which contains the agua hendita, or holy water. The choir, coro^ is placed in the middle of the nave in Spanish cathedrals, thus blocking it up and concealing the high altar; its back, which fronts the spectator who enters from the west, is called trascoro; the lateral sides are called respaldos del coro, over which the organs are usually placed. The choir is lined with stalls, siUas ; the seats, silleriaddcoro, are generally carved, and often most beautifully, as are the desks of the choristers' books, los atrilesy and the lecterns or facistoles. Opposite the coro an open space (entre los dos coros) marks the centre Digitized by V^OO^ ItT § 14. — Ecclesiological Tour, [27] of the transept, crucero, over which rises the great dome or central tower, cimborio : it divides the choir from the high altar, and is usually isolated and fenced off by a reja, \" parclose,\" or railing ; these and the cancelaSy gratings (whence comes our term chancel), are among the most remarkable and artistic peculiarities of Spain. The pulpits, pulpitos, generally two in number, are placed in the angle outside the chancel ; they are fixed N.W. and S.W., in order that the preacher may face the congregation, who look towards the high altar, without his turning his back to it. Ascending usually by steps is the capilla maycr^ el preshiterio, where is the high altar, altar mayor, on which is placed a tabernacle, ciborio, under which the consecrated wafer is placed in a vin7, or open \" monstrance,\" whenever it is displayed, or manifestado. When the wafer is not so exhibited, it is enclosed in a sagrario, or tabernacle. In some highly privileged churches, as at Lugo and Leon, the wafer is continually displayed S)r pubhc adoration ; in others, only at particular times: but generally, in great towns, this privilege is conceded to all the churches by rotation, and continues during 40 hours, las cuarenta horas, which are duly mentioned in almanacs and newspapers. From the high altar rises a screen, or reredoSy called retdblo; these specialities of the country, often most magnificent, are reared high aloft, and crowned with a \" holy rood/' la Santa Cruz, which is the representation of Christ on the Cross, with St. John and the Virgin at his side. The retahlos, most elaborately designed, carved, painted, and gilt, are divided into compartments, either by niches or intorcolumniations ; the spaces are ^filled with paintings or sculpture, generallv representing the life of the Virgin, or of the Savioiu*, or subjects taken from the Bible, or from the local legends and tutelars. The place of honour is usually assigned to la Virgen Santisima. Few Spaniards at ' any time, when traversing a cathedral, pass the high altar without bowing and crossing themselves, since the Incarnate Host is placed thereon : and in order not to offend, every considerate Protestant wUl manifest an outward respect for this custom. Sometimes kings, queens, and princes are buried near the high altar, which is then called a capilla real. The sarcophagus, or bed on which the figures representing the deceased kneel or lie, is called uma, Spaniards, in designating the right and left of the altar, generally use the terms lado del Evangelio, lado de la Epistola: the Gospel being read, as in England, from the 1. hand side of the worshipper who faces the altar, the Epistl"
