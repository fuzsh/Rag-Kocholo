In my pursuit of a double degree in Business & International Relations, I'm committed to balancing my academic excellence with my passion for soccer. My dedication to both areas sets me apart from other recruits. On the field, my strong work ethic, leadership skills, and adaptability make me a valuable asset to any team. Off the field, I'm known for my discipline, time management, and ability to excel academically. I'm excited about the opportunity to continue my soccer journey in college while furthering my education.
