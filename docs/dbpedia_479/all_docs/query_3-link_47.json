        "text": "Evaluating the effectiveness of research on my life drawing\n\nMy main artist influences for life drawing have been Alberto Giacometti and Egon Schiele. During the first few sessions, I focused on getting the basic measurement techniques behind me, before I began exploring any other areas. Drawing the body in the correct proportions is essential, but takes time and effort. The idea to draw what you see, rather than what you think you see, is simple but a lot easier said than done, as the mind's preconceptions of how the body looks often take-over. This took a lot of practice, but was helped by 'The Beginners Guide to Life Drawing' by Viv Levy, which explained a number of techniques to achieve the correct proportions. This included the '5 extreme points' technique as well as the pencil-measurement method. The extreme points technique helped me fill the page by drawing in a larger scale, rather than in a tight, little sketch, which was much more contained. Scale and loosening up my hand was an aspect of life drawing which I had struggled with in the first session, so this research really improved my freedom and expression.\n\nResearching Giacometti influenced me to draw shapes on the body, rather than sketchy lines to suggest areas of light and dark. Giacometti has a very bold, strong style when life drawing - a lot of his shapes are almost geometric. Rather than drawing the outline of the whole body he draws the individual shapes he sees, and joins these together to create a perfect sense of proportion. His influence caused me to be more confident in blocking the body. From this point I began blurring my eyes and distinguishing where light and shade fell on the body.\n\nMy drawing before Giacometti research\n\nTurning point - Influetnial Giacometti drawing\n\nMy drawing after Giacometti research\n\nI wanted to transfer the fluidity of Schiele's work into my own. At the start of the sessions, I began drawing as I always have done - in a sketchy, feathered line. This showed how timid I was to draw, as a sketchy line hides many mistakes and can suggest many different shapes, one of which may be right. Although I had the basic body shape captured, this was far too confused. A decisive, single line is so much more effective. After being inspired by Schiele's orangey glow drawing of a woman from the back, drawn with a single, flowing outline, I wanted to replicate this style in my own work. Schiele's work looked a lot more delicate and feminine than my boxy, overdrawn outlines. It took time to become more confident in drawing a line straight out, but the results were definitely worth it, and have a much more refined, curvaceous aesthetic. This was a really effective piece of researched which influenced my work and improved my style massively.\n\nBefore researching Egon Schiele. After researching Egon Schiele.\n\nThe approach which Giacometti takes with his life drawings is almost opposite to that of his 3D figures, but this is not unusual. Life drawing is the starting point, the fundamental understanding of the human form. Once this has been mastered, experimentation of angles, perspectives, scale and media can begin. His life drawings look more 3D than his sculptural work, with the drawings being chunky and structural, with emphasis on shading and shaping. Whereas his sculptures are spindly and frail, ironically looking almost as if they have been drawn with the single like of a black marker pen. I think both styles could work effectively in a drawing form. His stick-like figures are closer to my quick sketches at the start of sessions, similar to continuous, single line drawing. Below are 3 images of Giacometti's gestural line drawing, my own line drawings and Giacometti's bronze stick figures. Each of his figures walks in a different direction, whether displayed separately or cast on a block together. This creates a sense of adventure and wander, but also looks slightly lost and confused, I imagine this sense is increased in an empty exhibition space. His structural drawings are more similar to my longer studies, focusing more on the curves of the body by depicting where the light and dark areas fall.\n\nThe Article\n\nThe human race, handled with care\n\nGiacometti, Compton Verney, Warwickshire, until 1 June\n\nGiacometti, Tate Modern (permanent collection), London SE1\n\n'The Man who walks in the rain, 1948,' sculpture by Alberto Giacometti. Photograph: Georgios Kefalas/Corbis\n\n​This article is 7 years old\n\nA Giacometti story: in 1939, at the outbreak of war, Alberto Giacometti started making figures from memory. But each time he tried to create the image of someone known or once seen, not from the life, the figure ended up smaller and smaller.\n\nThe problem grew worse when he left occupied Paris. Over and again, back in his native Switzerland, Giacometti would begin the same sculpture of a woman glimpsed on the Boulevard Saint-Michel and watch it shrink beneath his fingers. Still he persisted. At the war's end, when he finally boarded the train back to France, the works of those years fitted entirely into a handful of matchboxes.\n\nAt Compton Verney, in a rare and transforming show of Giacometti's sculptures, paintings and drawings, you can see four minuscule women only a fraction bigger than those needle-sized figures. Perched on top of a pedestal the size of a high chair, they appear as remote, perceptually, as wrens on a wire or walkers on distant cliffs.\n\nThey don't walk - women stand, men stride in Giacometti - but somehow a febrile motion, something like anxious conversation, is communicated purely through the line of their bodies. And it is not much more than a black metal line, pencil-fine, that doesn't even develop into expressive limbs. Yet with the faintest twist, the slightest irregularity, the figures are given individual character. Everything that distinguishes one person from another - the slope of the shoulders, the tilt of the head - is marvellously condensed in miniature: intimate knowledge is somehow combined with the sense of viewing far-off figures.\n\nThin men and women, elongated, improbably fragile: Giacometti's distortions are a byword in modern sculpture, as instantly recognisable as a Henry Moore hole. But his figures, as few others, irresistibly raise the question of their own form over and again - why did he shape them like this? You don't wonder why Rodin's Burghers of Calais are knotted in an agonised ring, chained by fate, or why the Easter Island statues are so awesomely vast. But these skinny striplings, no arms, no knees, no flesh, their dimensions no fuller, almost, than a pencil drawing, not quite portraits, not quite types, nearly dematerialising and yet heavily rooted to the spot - is this how Giacometti sees the human race?\n\nAdvertisement'If you sit for me, you become a perfect stranger, even if I know you.' So says Giacometti, one of art's great self-explainers, filmed in the silvery gloom of his studio. Watch the reel at Compton Verney and count how often the artist speaks of his total failures; one man sat for him 400 times and still the final sculpture couldn't summon the sitter.\n\nThis is Giacometti the existentialist: how can any sculptor know, and make known to anybody else, the being who sits before them? Mankind is unknowable, unbearably solitary and complex, and Giacometti, according to this received version, is the Sartre of sculpture.\n\nBut look at the work and you sense he must have meant something else. Figures in groups, isolated figures, portrait heads: they are always enthrallingly handled, their surfaces still bearing the subtle impression of Giacometti's fingers, as mutable as human faces that may change the next moment. 'Art is the residue of vision,' he said, and this goes to a central truth of his art, and his subject: the problem of looking - of getting any proper correspondence between seeing a person and describing that experience - which becomes the intense pleasure, for us, of viewing.\n\nTake the portrait of Giacometti's brother Diego, on permanent display at Tate Modern. It is magnetically strange and sends the viewer in circles. From the front, the long black figure is nearly as thin as a blade, the sides flattened, throwing all the emphasis on the profile. Here, Diego emerges like an ink drawing, still glistening, his sharp nose and high forehead quickening into life with tremendous force, which, in turn, drives you back to consult the front. Where the intense psychology of the face flashes back at you anew, compressed in its few fierce centimetres.\n\nDiego is practically anamorphic, like the famous skull among the bric-a-brac in Holbein's The Ambassadors. You feel you have to stand at a particular angle to catch the whole of him and yet you never will. At Tate Modern, moreover, the sheer pressure of crowds prevents you from seeing the sculpture from many viewpoints, still less at a distance (great art blocked by the size of its public). The ideal viewing conditions for Giacometti, or so it seems, are probably at Compton Verney. This is an almost perfect show. Like the figures themselves, it is slender and silent. There are just enough works to give you the essence of Giacometti's art and plenty of room to give the sense of figures lost in space, looking out to sea like those Easter Island statues. Reduced, withdrawing into their own essence, they keep their distance even at your approach. One of the women in The Forest - that beautiful stand of figures, rooted like plants, tall and slim as Monet's poplars - shivers slightly at every passing footfall, yet remains steadfast and paradoxically weighty.\n\nBut Giacometti liked to imagine his sculptures stationed on a street corner or crossing a piazza, out there in the real world. And The Forest itself, its trees transformed into people who have stopped motionless in their tracks, makes one think again about how he viewed the world and how his world should be viewed.\n\nThey walk tall, his figures, no matter how tiny and exiguous they are. Even in the throng of Tate Modern they stand out. Like the paintings, in which faces resolve out of misty blurs, but resolve with extraordinary clarity of likeness, these dark sculptures draw your vision into them like black holes. Perhaps we should see them through a milling crowd, a rival crowd of their own; always alone, but always alike. As the subject of one of Giacometti's greatest portraits wrote: 'The resemblance of his figures to each other seems to me to repeat that precious point at which human beings are confronted with the most irreducible fact: the loneliness of being exactly equivalent to all others.'\n\nGuardian. 2008.
