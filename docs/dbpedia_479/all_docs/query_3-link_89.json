        "text": "Lily Le Brun considers the influences that shaped the work of Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, as a retrospective of his work at Tate Modern opens\n\nIn 2015, Alberto Giacometti's Man Pointing (1947) made history by fetching $141 million at Christie's, the highest price ever achieved by a sculpture at auction. Standing almost two metres tall, the whippet-thin bronze figure exemplifies the haunting Modernist sculptures that have come to define the Swiss artist's name.\n\nTate Modern's extensive retrospective fleshes out the sculptor's most famous creations. Featuring more than 250 works from five decades of his career, it displays paintings and drawings alongside recognisable masterpieces such as Man Pointing, giving a sense of how they developed. The Tate has also secured a loan of rarely exhibited, highly fragile plaster sculptures, which are a revelation - even for the show's curators. 'Like many, I associated Giacometti with bronze sculptures,' says assistant curator Dr Lena Fritsch. 'Although I knew he worked with clay and plaster, I did not know how central these materials were to his practice.' They show how he continuously reworked his sculptures, scratching and carving at their surfaces with a penknife to achieve their distinctively textured surface.\n\nBorn in a Swiss mountain village in 1901, Giacometti moved to Paris in 1922, where he embraced Cubism and then Surrealism. It was also a period when so-called 'primitive' art was gaining the attention of the Parisian avant-garde. Giacometti became particularly fascinated by ancient Egypt, at a time when many of its treasures were being unearthed by archaeologists. He saw in this work an ability to represent inner life, something that would remain a preoccupation for his whole career.\n\nOver the years, Giacometti's work evolved to have a deeply human aspect, nurtured by his intimate observations of those closest to him. His wife Annette, his brother Diego and his mistress Caroline were all favoured models, helping to weave his personal life inextricably into his work. 'The sculptures incorporate human feelings such as loneliness, angst or sexual desire in a strong and beautiful way,' says Lena. 'He really lived for his art.'"
