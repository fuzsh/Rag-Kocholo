        "text": "Famous Paintings by Alberto Giacometti\n\nAlberto Giacometti was a 20th century Italian/Swiss artist known for his Surrealism paintings. He was also a Sculptor who attended the Geneva School of Fine Art. He moved to Paris to study sculpture with a colleague of Rodin, where he met Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, and Max Ernst. He is known as the leading Surrealist sculptor of his day, but he also experimented with Cubism. He was commissioned to sculpt for the Chase Manhattan Building in New York but died before the work was complete."
