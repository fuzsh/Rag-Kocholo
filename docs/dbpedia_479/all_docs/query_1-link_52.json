        "text": "The historical evolution of the nude in art runs parallel to the history of art in general, except for small particularities derived from the different acceptance of nudity by the various societies and cultures that have succeeded each other in the world over time. The nude is an artistic genre that consists of the representation in various artistic media (painting, sculpture or, more recently, film and photography) of the naked human body. It is considered one of the academic classifications of works of art. Nudity in art has generally reflected the social standards for aesthetics and morality of the era in which the work was made. Many cultures tolerate nudity in art to a greater extent than nudity in real life, with different parameters for what is acceptable: for example, even in a museum where nude works are displayed, nudity of the visitor is generally not acceptable. As a genre, the nude is a complex subject to approach because of its many variants, both formal, aesthetic and iconographic, and some art historians consider it the most important subject in the history of Western art.[Note 1]\n\nAlthough it is usually associated with eroticism, the nude can have various interpretations and meanings, from mythology to religion, including anatomical study, or as a representation of beauty and aesthetic ideal of perfection, as in Ancient Greece. Its representation has varied according to the social and cultural values of each era and each people, and just as for the Greeks the body was a source of pride, for the Jews—and therefore for Christianity—it was a source of shame, it was the condition of slaves and the miserable.[1]\n\nThe study and artistic representation of the human body has been a constant throughout the history of art, from prehistoric times (Venus of Willendorf) to the present day. One of the cultures where the artistic representation of the nude proliferated the most was Ancient Greece, where it was conceived as an ideal of perfection and absolute beauty, a concept that has endured in classical art until today, and largely conditioning the perception of Western society towards the nude and art in general. In the Middle Ages its representation was limited to religious themes, always based on biblical passages that justified it. In the Renaissance, the new humanist culture, of a more anthropocentric sign, propitiated the return of the nude to art, generally based on mythological or historical themes, while the religious ones remained. It was in the 19th century, especially with Impressionism, when the nude began to lose its iconographic character and to be represented simply for its aesthetic qualities, the nude as a sensual and fully self-referential image. In more recent times, studies on the nude as an artistic genre have focused on semiotic analyses, especially on the relationship between the work and the viewer, as well as on the study of gender relations. Feminism has criticized the nude as an objectual use of the female body and a sign of the patriarchal dominance of Western society. Artists such as Lucian Freud and Jenny Saville have elaborated a non-idealized type of nude to eliminate the traditional concept of nudity and seek its essence beyond the concepts of beauty and gender.[2]\n\nPrehistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Prehistoric art\n\nPrehistoric art is the art developed from the Stone Age (Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic) to the Metal Age, periods where the first manifestations that can be considered as artistic by human beings appeared. In the Paleolithic (25,000– 8000 BC), man hunted and lived in caves, producing so-called cave paintings. After a transition period (Mesolithic, 8000–6000 BC), in the Neolithic (6000– 3000 BC) man became sedentary and dedicated himself to agriculture, with increasingly complex societies where religion gained importance and the production of handicrafts began. Finally, in the so-called Metal Age (3000–1000 BC), the first protohistoric civilizations emerged.[3]\n\nIn Paleolithic art, the nude was strongly linked to the cult of fertility, as can be seen in the representation of the female human body—the \"venus\"—generally of somewhat obese forms, with generous breasts and bulging hips. Most of them come from the Aurignacian period, and are generally carved in limestone, ivory or steatite. The venuses of Willendorf, Lespugue, Menton, Laussel, etc. stand out. At the male level, the representation of the phallus—generally erect—in isolated form or in full body, was also a sign of fertility, as in the Cerne Abbas Giant (Dorset, England).[4] In cave paintings—especially those developed in the French-Cantabrian and Levantine areas—hunting scenes are common, or scenes of rites and dances, where the human figure, reduced to schematic outlines, is sometimes represented highlighting the sexual organs—breasts in women and the phallus in men—probably associated with mating rites. Some examples are found in the caves of El Cogul, Valltorta and Alpera.[5]\n\nAncient art\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ancient art\n\nThis is the name given to the artistic creations of the first stage of history, especially the great civilizations of the Near East: Egypt and Mesopotamia. It would also include the first artistic manifestations of most of the peoples and civilizations of all continents. One of the great advances in this era was the invention of writing, generated primarily by the need to keep records of an economic and commercial nature.[6]\n\nIn the first religions, from the Sumerian to the Egyptian, the ancient cult of Mother Earth was related to the new anthropomorphic deities, linking the feminine form with nature, insofar as both are generators of life. Thus, the Egyptian twin gods Geb and Nut represented the earth and the sky, from whose union all the elements were born. In other cases, the gods are related to cosmological elements, such as the goddess Ishtar with the planet Venus, generally represented naked and winged, with a crescent moon on her head. Other representations of the Mother goddess are usually more or less clothed figures, but with bare breasts, such as the famous Snake Goddess (Heraklion Archaeological Museum), a Minoan statuette from around 1550 BC. These representations were the starting point for the iconography of Greek and Roman goddesses such as Artemis, Diana, Demeter and Ceres.[7]\n\nIn Egypt, nudity was seen naturally, and abounds in representations of court scenes, especially in dances and scenes of feasts and celebrations. But it is also present in religious themes, and many of their gods represented in anthropomorphic form appear nude or semi-nude in statues and wall paintings. It also appears in the representation of the human being himself, whether pharaoh or slave, military or civil servant, such as the famous Seated Scribe of the Louvre. Undoubtedly due to the climate, the Egyptians used to wear little clothing, loincloths and skirts for men, and transparent linen dresses for women. This is reflected in the art, from the scenes that show the festivities and ceremonies of the court to the more popular scenes, which show the daily work of peasants, artisans, shepherds, fishermen and other trades. Likewise, in the war scenes appear the pitiful naked bodies of slaves and captives, treated with the same hieratic style and lack of dynamism typical of Egyptian art, where the law of frontality prevails, the body constrained to rigid static postures and lack of realism. The painting is characterized mainly by presenting figures juxtaposed in superimposed planes, with a hierarchical criterion. The profile canon predominated, which consisted of representing the head and limbs in profile, but the shoulders and eyes from the front. Among the works that have come down to us from Ancient Egypt, the nude, partial or complete, is perceptible both in painting and sculpture, whether monumental or in small statuettes, such as the Louvre's Offeror or the British Museum's Girl Playing a Harp; we have statues such as those of Rahotep and Nofret, the King Menkaure (Mycerinus) and queen or Louvre's Lady Touy that, although dressed in linen, the transparency of the fabric shows her nudity; in painting, the murals of the tomb of Nath, accountant of Thutmose IV, or the Tomb of the Physicians in Saqqarah. In the tomb of Tutankhamun was found a statue of the pharaoh naked, representing Ihy, son of the goddess Hathor.[8]\n\nOn the other hand, in Mesopotamia, geographically and chronologically close to Ancient Egypt, the nude is practically unknown, except for some Assyrian reliefs such as Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal (British Museum), where the king appears with a naked torso, or some scenes of torture of prisoners, while on the female side we only find the naked breasts of a Chaldean bronze representing a young Canaephora, present in the Louvre. Nor do we find nudes in Phoenician or Jewish art, where the Mosaic law forbade human representation.[9]\n\nClassical art\n\n[edit]\n\nClassical art[Note 2] is the art developed in ancient Greece and Rome, whose scientific, material and aesthetic advances contributed to the history of art a style based on nature and the human being, where harmony and balance, the rationality of forms and volumes, and a sense of imitation (\"mimesis\") of nature prevailed, laying the foundations of Western art, so that the recurrence to classical forms has been constant throughout history in Western civilization.[10]\n\nGreece\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ancient Greek art\n\nThe main artistic manifestations that have marked the evolution of Western art were developed in Greece. After the beginnings of the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures, Greek art developed in three periods: archaic, classical and hellenistic. Characterized by naturalism and the use of reason in measurements and proportions, and with an aesthetic sense inspired by nature, Greek art was the starting point for the art developed on the European continent.[11] The high point of Greek art occurred in the so called Age of Pericles, where art enjoyed great splendor, generating a style of interpreting reality: artists were based on nature according to proportions and rules (κανών, canon) that allowed the capture of that reality by the viewer, resorting if necessary to foreshortening. A concept of beauty was pursued based on the imitation of the natural, but idealized with the incorporation of a subjective vision that reflected the harmony of body and soul, equating beauty with goodness (καλοκαγαθία, kalokagathía).[12]\n\nGreece was the first place where the human body was represented in a naturalistic way, far from the hieratism and schematization of previous cultures. Greek culture was humanistic, the human being was the main object of study of their philosophy and art, since their religion was more mythological than an object of worship. For the Greeks, the ideal of beauty was the naked male body, which symbolized youth and virility, like the athletes of the Olympic Games, who competed naked. The Greek nude was both naturalistic and idealized: naturalistic in terms of the faithful representation of the parts of the body, but idealized in terms of the search for harmonious and balanced proportions, rejecting a more realistic type of representation that would show the imperfections of the body or the wrinkles of age. From a more schematic composition in the archaic period, the study of the body evolved towards a more detailed description of the skeleton and muscles, as well as the movement and the different positions and twists that the human body can perform. The description of the face and the representation of states of mind were also perfected.[13]\n\nThe Greeks attached great importance to the naked body, of which they were proud, since it was not only the reflection of good physical health, but also the recipient of virtue and honesty, as well as a component of social advancement, as opposed to the inhibitions of other less civilized peoples. For the Greeks, nudity was an expression of integrity, nothing related to the human being as a whole could be eluded or isolated. They related body and spirit, which for them were indissolubly united, in such a way that even their religiosity materialized in anthropomorphic gods. They related apparently antagonistic elements, and just as something as abstract as mathematics could provide them with sensory pleasure, something material like the body could become a symbol of something ethereal and immortal. Thus, the nude had a moral component that avoided simple sensualism, so it did not seem obscene or decadent to them, as it did to the Romans. This interrelation between body and spirit is inherent to Greek art, and when artists of later times imitated the Greek nude—as in the case of neoclassicism and academicism—stripped of this component, they produced lifeless works, focused on physical perfection, but without moral virtue.[14]\n\nIn the Greek male nude, it is essential to capture the energy, the vital force, which they transcribed through two types of virile nudes: the athlete and the hero. At the Olympic Games it was customary to give the winner a ceramic vase—the \"panathenaic amphorae\"—with representations of the athletic discipline exercised by the winner, an excellent example of nude representations in movement, in scenes of action of great dynamism.[15]\n\nThe first exponent of the male nude is a type of figures representing athletes, gods or mythological heroes, called kouros (kouroi in plural), belonging to the Archaic period (7th century–5th century BC)—their female variant is the kore (korai in plural), which, however, they used to represent dressed. Although in origin these figures denote a certain Egyptian influence, soon the Greek sculptors followed their own path, looking for the best way to represent the human body to convey their ideal of beauty. The kouros is characterized by the hieratic posture, where frontality predominates, with the feet on the ground and the left leg forward, arms close to the body and hands closed, and the head of cubic shape, with a long mane and basic facial features, highlighting its characteristic smile, called \"archaic smile\". The first examples date back to the 7th century BC, from places such as Delos, Naxos and Samos, generally appearing in tombs and places of worship. Later they spread to Attica and the Peloponnese, where they became more naturalistic, with descriptive features and greater interest in modeling. Some works that have survived to the present day are: the Kouros of Sounion (600 BC), the Cleobis and Biton Twins (600–590 BC), the Moschophoros (570 BC), the Rampin Horseman (550 BC), the Kouros of Tenea (550 BC), the Kouros of Anafi (530 BC), the Kouros of Aristodikos (500 BC), etc.[16]\n\nSubsequently, the nude underwent a slow but steady evolution from the rigid, geometric forms of the kouroi to the soft, naturalistic lines of the classical period (the severe style, developed between 490 BC and 450 BC). The main factor in this innovation was a new concept in conceiving sculpture, moving from idealization to imitation. This change began to be noticed in the first years of the 5th century BC, with works such as the Apollo of Piombino (c. 490 BC), the Ephebe of Kritios (c. 480 BC) or the Tyrannicides Group, representing Harmodius and Aristogeiton, work of Kritios and Nesiotes (c. 477 BC). In these works, the cult of physical perfection is denoted, which was expressed mainly in athleticism, which combined physical vigor with moral virtue and religiosity. The new classical style brought greater naturalness not only formal, but also vital, by providing movement to the human figure, especially with the introduction of the contrapposto—generally attributed to Kritios—where the various parts of the body are harmoniously opposed, and which provides rhythm and balance to the figure. With these premises, the main figures of classical Greek sculpture emerged: Myron, Phidias, Polyclitus, Praxiteles, Scopas, Lysippos, etc.[17]\n\nMyron made with his Discobolus (450 BC) a magnificent example of figure in movement, achieving for the first time a coordinated dynamic effect for the whole figure, since until then the figures in movement were made in parts, without a global vision that provided coherence to the dynamic action—as in the case of the Poseidon of Cape Artemision, bronze figure of Attic origin from around 470 BC, in which the torso is static, not following the movement of the arms.[18]\n\nPhidias was especially dedicated to sculptures of gods—he was called the \"maker of gods\"—especially Apollo, which he treated with a mixture of naturalism and certain vestiges of the archaic hieratic frontality, which gave his figures an aura of majesty, with a balanced harmony between strength and grace, form and ideal, as in the Apollo of Kassel (c. 450 BC). However, he also produced works of ordinary characters, with a more human, less idealized treatment, such as his figure of Anacreon (c. 450 BC).[19]\n\nPolyclitus' work had a special relevance in the standardization of a canon of geometric proportions on which his figures were based, together with the search for balance within movement, as can be seen in his two main works, the Doriphorus (440 BC) and the Diadumene (430 BC)—unfortunately, only Roman copies of his works have come down to us. Another important contribution of Polyclitus was the anatomical study (the diarthrosis or articulation of the various parts of the body), especially of the musculation: the perfection of his torsos has led them to be nicknamed in French cuirasse esthétique (\"aesthetic armor\"), and they have long served for the design of armor.[20]\n\nPraxiteles designed more human figures (Apollo Saurochthonus, 360 BC; Resting Satyr, 365 BC; Hermes and the Infant Dionysus, 340 BC), with graceful movements, with a latent sensuality, combining physical power with a certain air of grace, almost sweetness, with a fluid and delicate design.[21]\n\nLater, Greek sculpture lost in a certain way this union between the physical and the ideal, moving towards more slender and muscular figures, where action predominated over moral expression. This can be seen in works such as the Ephebe of Antikythera (340 BC), the Athlete with Strigil of Ephesus and the Ephebe of Marathon. Among the artists who excelled in this period is Scopas, author of the frieze of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, full of moving figures, such as his Greeks and Amazons (c. 350 BC), where the use of clothing is characteristic—especially the cloaks of the Greeks, who otherwise wear the rest of the body naked—to give the sensation of movement. He also worked on the Leochares Mausoleum, author of the famous Apollo of Belvedere (c. 330–300 BC), considered the best ancient sculpture by the neoclassicists, which inspired many modern artists, such as Dürer's Adam (1504), Bernini's Apollo and Daphne (1622–1625), Canova's Perseus Triumphant (1801) and Thomas Crawford's Orpheus (1838). In the Mausoleum the so called \"heroic diagonal\" was introduced, a posture in which the action runs through the whole body from the feet to the hands following a pronounced diagonal, and that would be reproduced assiduously in the future—as in the Borghese Gladiator by Agasio of Ephesus (3rd century BC) or the Dioscuri of the Quirinal, reaching the Hercules and Theseus by Canova.[22]\n\nLysippos, perhaps the last great name in Greek sculpture, introduced a new canon of proportions, with a smaller head, a more slender body and long legs, as in his main work, the Apoxymenos (325 BC), or in the Agias (337 BC), in Eros drawing the bow (335 BC) and Heracles at rest (320 BC). He also introduced a new conception of the human figure, less idealistic, more focused on the everyday and anecdotal, as his figure of an athlete scratching, the Hermes resting (330–320 BC) of Naples, or the Berlin Adorant. Lysippos was the portraitist of Alexander the Great, of whom he made several statues, several of them nude, as in the Alexander with the spear of the Louvre (330 BC).[23]\n\nThe female nude was less frequent, especially in archaic times, where the nudity of the kouroi contrasted with the clothed figures of the korai. Just as Western art has considered—preferably since the Renaissance—the female nude as a more normal and pleasant subject than the male, in Greece certain religious and moral aspects prohibited female nudity—as can be seen in the famous trial of Phryne, Praxiteles' model. Socially, in Greece, women were relegated to housework, and in contrast to the nudity of male athletics, women had to be dressed from head to toe. Only in Sparta did women participate in athletic competitions, wearing a short tunic that showed their thighs, a fact that was scandalous in the rest of Greece. The first traces of female nudity are found in the 6th century BC, in everyday scenes painted on ceramic vessels. In the 5th century BC the first sculptural traces appeared, such as the Venus of the Esquiline, which probably represented a priestess of Isis. It presents a crude and poorly elaborated anatomy, robust and of short stature, but it already contains mathematical proportions, based on the canon of the seven-headed stature.[24]\n\nThe subsequent evolution of the female nude was sporadic, with hardly any full nude figures, but partial or with the technique of draperie mouillée (\"wet cloths\"), light dresses and attached to the body, such as the Aphrodite of the Ludovisi Throne, the Niké of Paeonius (425 BC), or the Venus Genetrix of the Museo delle Terme in Rome. Around 400 BC a bronze figure of a girl was sculpted (Munich Museum), by an anonymous author, which presents the classical contrapposto, giving the female figure a sinuosity—especially in the arch of the hip, which in French is called déhanchement (\"swinging\")—that enhanced her figure and would remain as an almost archetypal model of representation of the female figure.[25]\n\nThe main classical sculptor who dealt with the female nude was Praxiteles, author of the famous Aphrodite of Cnidus (c. 350 BC), represented at the moment of entering the bath, with the dress still in one hand. It is an image that combines sensuality with mysticism, physical pleasure with spiritual evocation, and that was a material realization of the ideal of Greek feminine beauty. He was also the author of another famous image, that of the goddess Aphrodite with legs wrapped in garments and bare breasts, which has come down to us through several copies, the most complete being the so-called Venus of Arles in the Louvre, but which is most famous for the copy of an anonymous artist of about 100 BC, the Venus of Milo. The subsequent evolution of the female nude led to typologies such as the \"Venus Pudica\", which covers her nudity with her arms, as seen in the Capitoline Venus—sometimes attributed to Praxiteles himself—or the Venus Calypigia (\"of beautiful buttocks\"), which lifts her peplos to reveal her hips and buttocks, of which a Roman copy of a Hellenistic original has come down to us, now in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples.[26]\n\nA genre where the female nude abounded a little more was in the representation of bacchanals and Dionysian rites, where along with the satyrs and sylenes appeared a whole chorus of maenads and nereids in sensual and unbridled postures, whose scenes were widely represented in funerary sarcophagi, and was a frequent theme in the sculptural workshop of Scopas, author of several figures related to the cult of Dionysus, such as the Maenad of Dresden. In particular, the nereid figures gained great popularity and influenced subsequent art produced throughout the Mediterranean. As a symbol of the liberated soul, their representation became a frequent ornamental motif in various artistic techniques, from painting and sculpture to jewelry, cameos, ceramic vases and cups, chests, sarcophagi, etc. In the late Roman Empire it had a great diffusion, being found from Ireland to Arabia, and reached as far as India, where we see its forms in the figures of flying gandharvas. Even in the Middle Ages, its typology was identified with the character of Eve.[27]\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period—beginning with the death of Alexander the Great, when Greek culture expanded throughout the eastern Mediterranean—the figures acquired a greater dynamism and twist of movement, denoting exacerbated feelings and tragic expressions, breaking the serene balance of the classical period. In contrast to the vital and triumphant energy of heroes and athletes, pathos emerged, the expression of defeat, of drama, of suffering, of battered and deformed, sick or mutilated bodies. If heroes and athletes were victors, now man is subdued by fate, suffers the wrath of the gods, the divine prevails over the material, the spirit over the body. This is seen in myths such as the slaughter of the sons of Niobe, the agony of Marsyas, the death of the hero (as Hector or Meleager) or the fate of Laocoön, frequent themes in the art of the time.[28]\n\nOne of the first production centers of Hellenistic sculpture was Pergamon, whose workshop of sculptors from all over Greece established a style that, starting from a clear Lysipian influence, imprinted a dramatism to their figures that, primarily through the twisting of the body, expressed in an effective way the pain of the characters, as seen in the Dying Gaul of the Capitoline Museum (230 BC), the Ludovisi Gaul of the Museo delle Terme (230 BC), Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus of the Loggia dei Lanzi (230–200 BC), also called Pasquino Group) or in the Marsyas of the Conservatory of Rome (230–200 BC). His masterpiece is the Laocoön and His Sons, by Agesander, Athenodorus and Polydorus of Rhodes (2nd century BC), perhaps the best expression of pathos in all history, where the variegated movement, the twisting of the intertwined figures (father, sons and snakes), the exacerbated emotion, the marked muscles of the torso and thighs of the central figure, the dramatic expression of the faces, confer a general sense of latent tragedy, which undoubtedly provokes in the viewer a feeling of terror and despair, of pity for these suffering figures. According to Pliny, the Laocoön is \"the best of all works of painting and sculpture\".[29]\n\nAlso from the Hellenistic period is the Farnese Bull, by Apollonius and Tauriscus of Tralles, a copy of an earlier work entitled The Suffering of Dirce (130 BC). It is a dynamic group, of great expressive effect, where on a landscape base are the animals, of great realism, the young, in a somewhat rigid attitude, and the figure of Dirce, with a complex spiral twist of great dramatic effect.[30] Another famous work of the period is the Crouching Venus of Doidalsas of Bithynia (3rd century BC), highly valued in antiquity and of which numerous copies were made to decorate palaces, gardens and public buildings. Today there are several copies in museums around the world, and several copies or versions have been made in modern art—mainly Renaissance—such as those of Giambologna, Antoine Coysevox and Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, or even in drawing or engraving, such as those of Marcantonio Raimondi and Maarten van Heemskerck. Rubens was also inspired by this figure for several of his works.[31] Equally important was the Sleeping Hermaphrodite of Polycles (2nd century BC), whose original bronze was lost, there are several copies made in Roman times, of which one of the most famous is the Borghese Hermaphrodite, found in the Baths of Diocletian in the early seventeenth century and restored by Bernini. There are several copies, some made in modern times, such as the one commissioned by Philip IV of Spain, now in the Prado, which surely influenced Velázquez's Venus at her Mirror.[32]\n\nRome\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Roman art\n\nWith a clear precedent in Etruscan art, Roman art was greatly influenced by Greek art. Thanks to the expansion of the Roman Empire, classical Greco-Roman art reached almost every corner of Europe, North Africa and the Near East, laying the evolutionary foundation for the future art developed in these areas. Although the Romans were very advanced in architecture and engineering, they were not very innovative in the plastic arts. Most Roman statues are copies of Greek works, or are inspired by them. Many of the artists of the Hellenistic world moved to work in Rome, keeping alive the spirit of Greek art. Roman historians despised works of art produced after the classical Greek period, going so far as to claim that after this Greek golden age \"art stopped\".[33]\n\nThe first productions in sculpture were the work of Greek artists who settled in Rome, among them: Apollonius of Athens, author of the Belvedere Torso (50 BC); Cleomenes, author of the Venus de' Medici (1st century BC); and Pasiteles, author of the Boy with Thorn.[34] Stephanos, a disciple of Pasiteles, was the author of the Athlete of Albani (50 BC), a figure that had an enormous success, a fact that is corroborated because 18 copies have reached us, and that originated a variant with another figure, creating a group sometimes identified with Mercury and Vulcan, and others with Orestes and Pylades, of which a copy, called Group of San Ildefonso (10 BC), is preserved in the Prado, where the two figures are reminiscent of Polyclitus' Doriphorus and Praxiteles' Apollo Saurochthonus.[35] Other anonymous works stylistically related to Hellenistic Greek art are the Boxer at Rest from the Museo delle Terme in Rome (100–50 BC) and the Hellenistic Prince from the same museum (100–50 BC).\n\nAs for the Roman production itself, while maintaining the Greek influence, the statues of deified Roman emperors are characteristic, naked like the Greek gods, which although they maintain a certain idealism show a greater study of the natural in terms of the features of their portraits.[36] In a few works we can perceive some stylistic stamp differentiated from the Greek ones, as in the Venus of Cyrene (Museo delle Terme, Rome), which shows a greater anatomical naturalism than the Greek figures, while maintaining the elegance and sensuality of the Greek female nude. An original thematic innovation was that of the Three Graces, of which there are several copies (Siena, Louvre), almost all datable to the first century. It is an iconographic theme that comes from the group of charites (divinities of beauty) that accompanied Aphrodite, generally represented with three sisters (Euphrosine, Thalia and Aglaea), holding each other by the arms and arranged two of them frontally and the one in the center turned backwards. This theme was very successful during the Renaissance and Baroque periods.[37]\n\nIn imperial times the interest in the nude declined, in parallel to the idealizing concept of sculpture, gaining greater relevance realism and detailed description of the details, even the ugliest and most unpleasant, style that had its greatest crystallization in the portrait. Even so, magnificent pieces were produced, such as the statues of Mars and Mercury that decorate the Hadrian's Villa (125), or the Apotheosis of Antoninus and Faustina that appears on the base of the Column of Antoninus—currently in the Vatican Museum—(161), or even the Dioscuri of Montecavallo, of the Baths of Constantine, in the Piazza del Quirinale in Rome (330).[38]\n\nAs for the painting, of which we have received numerous samples thanks mainly to the excavations in Pompeii and Herculaneum, despite their eminently decorative character, they offer great stylistic variety and thematic richness, with an iconography that goes from mythology to the most everyday scenes, including parties, dances and circus shows. Nudity abounds in these scenes, with a clear tendency towards eroticism, which is shown without concealment, as one more facet of life. Among the many scenes that decorate the walls of Pompeii and in which the nude is present, it is worth remembering: The Three Graces, Aphrodite Anadyomene, Invocation to Priapus, Cassandra abducted by Ajax, The Dancing Faun, Bacchante surprised by a satyr, The rape of the nymph Iphtima, Hercules recognizing his son Telephus in Arcadia, The centaur Chiron instructing the young Achilles, Perseus freeing Andromeda, The Aldobrandini Wedding, etc.[39]\n\nMedieval art\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Medieval art\n\nThe fall of the Western Roman Empire marked the beginning of the Middle Ages in Europe, a period of certain political and social decadence, as the fragmentation of the empire into small states and the social domination of the new military aristocracy meant the feudalization of all the territories previously administered by the imperial bureaucracy. Classical art was reinterpreted by the new dominant cultures, of Germanic origin, while the new religion, Christianity, impregnated most of the medieval artistic production. Medieval art went through several phases, from Paleochristian art, through pre-Romanesque, to Romanesque and Gothic, including Byzantine and Germanic art.[40]\n\nIn the Middle Ages, moral theology distinguished four types of nudity: nuditas naturalis, the natural state of the human being; nuditas temporalis, an artificial state imposed by transience, generally linked to poverty; nuditas virtualis, as a symbol of virtue and innocence; and nuditas criminalis, linked to lust and vanity. Another frequent element of nudity in medieval art—especially in the Apocalypses of the Beatus—was the representation of the dead, as a symbol of the stripping of everything earthly.[41]\n\nChristian theology divided the human being into perishable body and immortal soul, the latter being the only one considered as something precious to be preserved. With the disappearance of the pagan religions, most of the iconographic content related to the nude was lost, which was limited to the few passages in the Holy Scriptures that justified it. In the few cases of representation of the nude are angular and deformed figures, far from the harmonious balance of the classical nude, when they are not deliberately ugly and battered forms, as a sign of the contempt that was felt for the body, which was considered a simple appendage of the soul. In the few representations of female nudes—generally figures of Eve—they are figures with bulging bellies, narrow shoulders and straight legs, although the face is usually worked in a personalized way, which was not the case in antiquity.[42]\n\nThe human figure was subjected to a process of stylization, in which the naturalistic description was lost to emphasize the transcendent character and the symbolic language of the Christian religion, in parallel to the loss of perspective and the geometrization of space, resulting in a type of representation where the symbolic content, the message inherent in the image, is more important than the description of reality. The Christian religion, influenced by the Platonic idea of the body as a prison for the soul, lost interest in the study of naturalistic anatomical forms, focusing the representation of the human being on expressiveness.[43]\n\nAlthough the study of proportion in the human body was lost during the Middle Ages, the human body was the object of a cosmogonic symbolism with mathematical and aesthetic applications: the homo quadratus. Starting from the Platonic corpus, medieval culture considered the world as a great animal—and, therefore, as a human being—while man was conceived as a world, a microcosm within the great cosmos of Creation. This theory related the symbolism of the number four to nature, which in turn was applied to art: there are four cardinal points, four seasons, four phases of the moon, four main winds; and four is the number of man, a theory that goes back to Vitruvius and his conception of man as an ideal square, with the width of his outstretched arms corresponding to his height.[44]\n\nIn its beginnings, Christianity—still under a strong Jewish influence—had forbidden not only the nude, but almost any image of a human figure, since it was a transgression of the second commandment, and condemned pagan idols as the abode of demons. The fact that many pagan gods were represented in painting and sculpture in human form, and in many occasions naked, made the primitive Christians identify the nude with pagan idolatry, if not they saw directly a diabolic link. However, the end of paganism and the assimilation of Neoplatonic philosophy by Christian morality led to the acceptance of the body as a receptacle of the spirit, and nudity as a degraded state of the human being, but natural and acceptable. Even so, medieval art completely lost the concept of bodily beauty inherent in classical art, and when it was represented—in the biblical passages that required it, such as Adam and Eve—they were deformed bodies, reduced to basic lines, with minimized sexual attributes, unattractive bodies, devoid of aesthetic qualities. The Gothic period was a timid attempt to remake the human figure, more elaborate and based on more naturalistic premises, but under a certain conventionalism that subjected the forms to a rigidity and a geometrizing structure that subordinated the body to the symbolic aspect of the image, always under the premises of Christian iconography.[45]\n\nThe few representations of the nude in medieval art were limited to biblical passages that justified it, such as Adam and Eve in Paradise or the martyrdom and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The image of Jesus on the cross had two main iconographic transcriptions: that of Christ undressed, called \"of Antioch\", and that of the Redeemer with a tunic, called \"of Jerusalem\". However, despite the puritanical and anti-nudity character of early Christianity, it was the naked version that triumphed and was accepted as the canonical version of the theme, especially from the Carolingian period. The suffering of Christ on the cross has always been a theme of great drama, so that in a way linked to the Hellenistic pathos, with images where the nude is a vehicle for an intense expression of suffering, so that the anatomy is shown deformed, unstructured, subjected to the emotional expression of pain. A typical posture is that of Jesus with his head fallen to one side and the body inclined to compensate the position of the body, first seen in the prayer book of Charles the Bald and in the Cross of Gero in the Cologne Cathedral (10th century), and which would later include some small modification, with the body more curved and the knees bent, as in the painted crosses of Cimabue. In northern Europe, however, an even more dramatic image of the crucifixion was imposed, where the anguish reaches authentic levels of paroxysm, as in the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Grünewald.[46]\n\nPaleo-Christian art transformed numerous classical motifs into Christian scenes: thus, the ancient Hermes Moscophorus became the image of Jesus as the Good Shepherd, and Orpheus became Christ the benefactor. From the biblical repertoire, apart from Adam and Eve, the prophet Daniel was often depicted naked among the lions, an image preserved in a mural painting in the Giordano Cemetery in Rome (4th century), and in a sarcophagus in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran.[47]\n\nIn Romanesque art, the few nude representations—generally limited to the Genesis passages about Adam and Eve—were of basic lines, where the figure of the woman was barely distinguished from that of the man by the breasts, reduced to two shapeless protuberances. They were crude and schematic figures, preferably showing an attitude of shame, covering their private parts with decorum. This is shown in examples such as the reliefs of the Creation, the Fall and the Expulsion of the bronze doors of the Hildesheim Cathedral (c. 1010), in the Adam and Eve of the facade of the Modena Cathedral, work of Wiligelmus (c. 1105), or in the Creation of Adam and Adam and Eve in the Paradise of the Master of Maderuelo (Museo del Prado).[48] In other cases, total or partial nudes can be seen in scenes of martyrdom of saints, such as that of Saint Gabin and Saint Cyprian in Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe (Poitou). The same iconographic themes, perhaps treated with greater freedom, can be seen in the illustrated miniature, such as the Adam and Eve from the Virgilian Codex (El Escorial Monastery), or The Baptism of Christ from the Vyšehrad Gospel Book (1085, University of Prague).[49]\n\nIn Gothic art the nude began to be forged mainly in the Germanic environment, at the beginning of the 13th century. The first independent and life-size figures representing a nude are the Adam and Eve of the Bamberg Cathedral (c. 1235), which still look like two columns of rigid and hieratic forms, but treated with a certain air of nobility.[50] At this time the iconographic repertoire was expanded a bit, especially with the incorporation of the Last Judgment, coming from chapters 24 and 25 of St. Matthew—until then most of the scenes of the biblical story represented in the cathedral reliefs ended with the Apocalypse. The scene of the resurrection of the flesh contemplated that the bodies were naked, while being reborn souls should be represented according to parameters of perfect beauty, so the artists looked again at the works of classical Greco-Roman art, emerging treatises such as the Speculum of Vincent de Beauvais, which contained instructions for artists based on ancient classical treatises. Studies of the natural began again, and there is data indicating that some artists went to public baths to study the body in more detail, as evidenced in the Last Judgment of the Bourges Cathedral, with more naturalistic forms, reminiscent of the figures of the sarcophagi of antiquity. In this work, the woman in the center has more feminine forms, and her posture in contrapposto has a certain Polyletian air, although her forms are stylized and not very sensual, with small and separated breasts, flat belly and reduced hips.[51]\n\nLittle by little the Gothic nude was gaining in naturalness and anatomical precision, while the thematic repertoire was expanding and the use of the nude figure in all areas of art was spreading, not only in sculpture and miniatures, but also in reredos, stained glass, choir stalls, gold and silver work, etc. Some of the new themes represented were St. Jerome and other ascetics, stripped of everything material by virtue of their renunciation of earthly goods, or female figures such as Mary Magdalene and Mary of Egypt. Sometimes the serpent that tempted Eve in Paradise or the dragon defeated by St. George are also represented in naked human form.[52] Greater sensuality was given to certain female figures of the Old Testament, such as Bathsheba, Susanna, Judith, Delilah and Salome. Sometimes the Virgin Mary was even allowed to show a breast by virtue of nursing the infant Jesus, as in Jean Fouquet's The Virgin and Child (1450, also called Madonna of the Red Angels).[53]\n\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, the façade of the Orvieto Cathedral, the work of Lorenzo Maitani, where he deployed a large series of nudes that seems to show a personal interest of the artist in the subject, since he chose all the themes that justify it: the Creation, the Fall of Man, the Last Judgment. His Eve rising from Adam's side is undoubtedly inspired by the ancient sarcophagi of nereids, and shows for the first time a certain idealism, a conception of the body as a receptacle of the soul and, as such, worthy of consideration. The Last Judgment, on the other hand, seems to be of Nordic inspiration, in a variegated scene reminiscent of battle sarcophagi or ancient scenes of dying Gauls.[54]\n\nIn the 15th century the nude had a greater diffusion, framed in the fashionable current of the time, the so called \"international Gothic\", which emerged between France, Burgundy and the Netherlands around the year 1400. One of its first exponents was The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry by the Limbourg brothers (1416), where a scene from The Fall and the Expulsion from Paradise shows the evolution of Eve from the naturalness of life in Eden to the shame of sin and the expulsion from Paradise, where she takes the form of a Venus pudica that is covered with a fig leaf. Her elongated, bulbous form, with small breasts and bulging belly, became the prototype of the Gothic female nude, which would last for two hundred years. This can be seen in figures such as the Eve of the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck, in the Adam and Eve by Hugo van der Goes and in that by Rogier van der Weyden, or in other female figures such as the Vanity by Hans Memling or the Judith by Conrad Meit, where the modest medieval attitude that related the nude as something shameful is giving way to more sensual, more provocative, more carnally human figures.[55] In Spain, the first timid attempts at nudes emerged, far from any sensuality, serious, contained, such as the Descent of Christ into Limbo by Bartolomé Bermejo, the Martyrdom of Saint Catherine by Fernando Gallego, the figure of Saint Tecla in the High Altarpiece of the Tarragona Cathedral, by Pere Johan (1429), or The Slaughter of Saint Cucufate (1504–1507), by Ayne Bru.[56]\n\nThe more or less naturalistic nude began to appear timidly in pre-Renaissance Italy, generally in the form of allegories, such as the image of Daniel as Fortitude on the pulpit in the Pisa Baptistery, by Nicola Pisano 1260, based on a Roman Hercules, which slightly evokes a polychletian athlete; or the figure of Temperance in a pulpit of Pisa Cathedral (1300–1310), by Giovanni Pisano, in the form of a Venus in a modest form, covering her private parts with her arms.[57] It is also perceived in Giotto's work, especially in his Last Judgment in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua.[58]\n\nArt of the Early Modern Age\n\n[edit]\n\nThe art of the Early Modern Age—not to be confused with modern art, which is often used as a synonym for contemporary art—[Note 3] developed between the 15th and 18th centuries. The Early Modern Age brought radical political, economic, social and cultural changes: the consolidation of centralized states meant the establishment of absolutism; the new geographical discoveries—especially the American continent—opened an era of territorial and commercial expansion, marking the beginning of colonialism; the invention of the printing press led to a greater diffusion of culture, which was opened to all types of public; religion lost the preponderance it had in medieval times, which was helped by the rise of Protestantism; at the same time, humanism emerged as a new cultural trend, giving way to a more scientific conception of man and the universe.[59]\n\nRenaissance\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Renaissance\n\nEmerging in Italy in the 15th century (Quattrocento), it spread throughout the rest of Europe from the end of that century and the beginning of the 16th. The artists were inspired by classical Greco-Roman art, so it was called artistic \"renaissance\" after the medieval obscurantism. Style inspired by nature, new models of representation emerged, such as the use of perspective. Without renouncing religious themes, the representation of the human being and his environment became more relevant, with the appearance of new themes such as mythology or history, or new genres such as landscape or still life, which influenced the revitalization of the nude. Beauty ceased to be symbolic, as in the medieval era, to have a more rational and measured component, based on harmony and proportion.[61]\n\nRenaissance art, in parallel to the anthropocentrism of humanist philosophy, which made the human being the center of the new worldview of the newly inaugurated modern age, relied on the study of anatomy to better articulate the representation of the human body. In 1543, De humani corporis fabrica by Andreas Vesalius was published, an anatomical study of the body based on dissections, where along with the text there were multiple illustrative plates of the human body, attributed to Jan van Calcar, which served as a basis for other artists for their images, based increasingly on objective realism. The plates in the book were conceived with artistic criteria, with skeletons and flayed figures appearing in artistic poses or in gesticulating, almost theatrical attitudes.[62]\n\nThe Renaissance nude was inspired by classical Greco-Roman models, although with a different function from the one it had in antiquity: if in Greece the male nude exemplified the figure of the hero, in Renaissance Italy the nude has a more aesthetic character, more linked to a new way of understanding the world away from religious precepts, the human being again as the center of the universe. The female nude stood out mainly due to the patronage of nobles and rich merchants who demonstrated their privileged position in society. Thus, the secularization of the nude was forged, passing from medieval religious themes to profane ones, sometimes with somewhat forced attempts to justify this type of representation outside the religious sphere: Botticelli's main works, Primavera and The Birth of Venus, represent the Neoplatonic concept that Marsilio Ficino extrapolated from the myth of Venus as the ideal of the virtuous woman, where despite her nudity after her birth into adulthood her first reaction is to cover herself, following the ancient concept of the \"Venus Pudica\".[63]\n\nRenaissance art recovered the classical nude as an exemplification of ideal beauty, both physical and moral. The nude was the perfect pretext for any composition, from the most naturalistic to the most symbolic, the latter expressed through multiple allegories and personifications. At times, the Renaissance representation of the human body was that of nudity for nudity's sake, a kind of art for art's sake that often denaturalized the very subject of the painting, whether religious or mythological.[64] In the Renaissance the nude ceased to be a source of shame and, in contrast, acquired a new heroic or even sacred character (sacra nuditas).[65] According to Louis Réau (Iconography of Christian Art, 1955), \"Renaissance artists considered the representation of the human body in its triumphant nudity as the primary object of the plastic arts\".[65]\n\nSimilarly, the nude was present both in the major arts and in myriad minor arts and objects, from candlesticks to knives and doorknobs. Such an abundance of nude representations was excused by Benvenuto Cellini on the grounds that \"the human body is the most perfect of forms\", so it is not surprising that it is frequently depicted.[66] On the other hand, at the iconographic level, although an increasing number of works with mythological themes began to be executed, most of the artistic production continued to be religious, producing a curious symbiosis between the mythical figures of the classical nude and the Christian characters most justified in appearing nude; Thus, we see how the figure of Isaac in Ghiberti's The Sacrifice of Isaac presents the classical typology of The Children of Niobe, how the figure of the recumbent Christ in Donatello's Entombment recalls the classical Meleager, or the posture of Eve in Masaccio's Expulsion from Paradise is that of the Venus Pudica.[67]\n\nDuring the 15th century, certain forms inherited from Gothic art still survived in Italy, although they gradually gained in naturalism and veracity. This can be seen in the work of artists such as: Masaccio (Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden, 1425–1428); Masolino da Panicale (The Temptation of Adam and Eve, 1426–1427); Antonello da Messina (St. Sebastian, 1476; Dead Christ supported by an angel, 1476–1479); and Andrea Mantegna (Calvary, 1458; Bacchanal with Wine Vat, 1470; Lamentation over the Dead Christ, c. 1475–1490; Parnassus, 1497; Venus, Mars and Diana, not dated; Saint Sebastian, three versions in 1459, 1480 and 1490), etc. The same happened in the sculptural field with Lorenzo Ghiberti, author of the Gates of Paradise of the Baptistery of Florence (1425–1452), with his scenes of The Creation of Adam and Eve, The Original Sin and The Expulsion from Paradise.[68]\n\nOne of the first works that broke with the past and represented a return to the classical canons was Donatello's David (c. 1440), a work of great originality that was ahead of its time, since for the next fifty years there were no works with which it could be compared. However, Donatello's model was not as athletic as the Greek works, presenting the graceful and slender forms of a boy in his teens. Similarly, instead of the serenity of Apollonian beauty, the sensuality of Dionysian beauty is perceived, and the head of Goliath at the feet of the Jewish king recalls that of a satyr that used to adorn the base of statues of the Greek god of wine. Donatello also deviated from classical proportions, especially in the torso, where, in contrast to the polyletian cuirasse esthétique, it is the waist that vertebrates the central axis of the body.[69]\n\nAfter Donatello, the nude became more dynamic, especially in Florence with the work of Antonio Pollaiuolo and Botticelli, and in Umbria with Luca Signorelli, concerned with the representation of movement, energy and ecstatic feeling. In his paintings of The Labors of Hercules in the Medici Palace (1460), Pollaiuolo recovered the \"heroic diagonal\" of Greek sculpture, showing great virtuosity in the representation of the nude in action—according to Vasari, his treatment of the nude \"is more modern than that of any of the masters who preceded him\". Pollaiuolo made profound studies of anatomy, Vasari confessing that he dissected corpses, studying especially the muscles. In this way, he moved away from Greco-Roman classicism, which although based on the naturalism of the forms, these were idealized, far from the anatomical realism introduced by Pollaiuolo, as shown in his Hercules and Antaeus (1470), whose tension when the hero crushes the body of the giant denotes the detail of the anatomical study carried out by the author. With his brother Piero, he painted the Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (1475), which again shows his anatomical studies, especially in the archer whose face is red from the effort of drawing the bow.[70]\n\nLuca Signorelli was another exponent of the dynamic, anatomical nude, especially for his angular, broad and firm shoulders, which denote contained energy, as well as the simplification of certain parts of the body with contrasting volumes—shoulders and buttocks, chest and stomach—which gives his figures a dense plasticity, a certain tactile quality. In his frescoes in the Orvieto Cathedral (1499–1505) he presented muscular figures, of marked contours, with a latent dynamic tension, as in his figures of The Damned Cast into Hell. The tense and dynamic nudes of Pollaiuolo and Signorelli initiated a fashion for \"battles of naked men\" that would continue from 1480 to 1505, without special iconographic justification, simply for their aestheticism—what in Florence they called the bel corpo ignudo—and that is denoted in works such as the Battle by Bertoldo di Giovanni (1480), the Fighting Men by Raphael or the Battle of the Centaurs (1492) and the Battle of Cascina (1504) by Michelangelo.[71]\n\nBotticelli created highly intellectualized nudes, with a strong symbolic charge, related to the Neoplatonic school of Florence, which was mainly responsible for the recovery of the female nude after the medieval moralistic period. Marsilio Ficino, one of the main theorists of the school, recovered the figure of Venus as a model of virtue and mystical exaltation, opposing two figures from Plato's Symposium, the celestial (Venus Coelestis) and the mundane (Venus Naturalis) Venus, symbolizing what is divine and earthly in women. This symbolism was excellently treated by Botticelli in his two main works: Primavera (1481–1482) and The Birth of Venus (1484). For this he drew inspiration from the few remains of classical works he had at his disposal, some sarcophagi, jewelry, reliefs, ceramics and drawings, and created an archetype of beauty that would be identified as the classical ideal of beauty since the Renaissance. In Primavera he recovered the genre of the draperie mouillée, with fine semi-transparent fabrics that allow the contours of the body to be seen, with a sense of classicism coming from the paintings of Pompeii and Herculaneum or the stuccoes of Prima Porta and Hadrian's Villa. However, Botticelli moved away from the volumetric character of the classical nude, with fragile and slender figures that responded more to the modern concept of the human body, while his faces are more personal and humanized than the ideal classical prototypes. In The Birth of Venus, painted after his stay in Rome, where he frescoed the Sistine Chapel, he showed a purer classicism, thanks to his contact with the Roman antiquities present in the city of the popes. Thus, his Venus is already stripped of all clothing and any kind of moralistic constraint, definitively abandoning medieval art to enter fully into modernity. The iconographic theme was taken from some verses of the Giostra by Angelo Poliziano,[Note 4] inspired by a Homeric passage that, according to Pliny, had already been painted by Apelles in his work Aphrodite Anadyomene. He used as a model the beautiful aristocrat Simonetta Vespucci, whose figure, despite the classicism of the composition, responds more to Gothic criteria, not so much in terms of proportions, but in rhythm and structure: its curved shape means that the figure is not evenly distributed, but the weight falls more to the right, and the wavy movement of its outline and hair gives the sensation of floating in the air. The iconographic type is that of the Venus pudica, which covers her private parts with her arms, a scheme that he partially repeated in the figure of Truth in the Calumny of Apelles, far from any classical component. Other works by Botticelli in which nudes appear are: Saint Sebastian (1474), The Story of Nastagio degli Onesti (1482–1483), Venus and Mars (1483), Pieta with Saint Jerome, Saint Paul and Saint Peter (1490–1492) and Lamentation over the Dead Christ (1492–1495).[72]\n\nPiero di Cosimo, who also portrayed Simonetta Vespucci as Cleopatra (1480), was an original artist endowed with great fantasy, with works inspired by mythology, with a somewhat eccentric air, but endowed with great feeling and tenderness, where the figures—along with a great variety of animals—are immersed in vast landscapes: Vulcan and Aeolus (1490), Venus, Mars and Cupid (1490), The Misfortunes of Silenus (1500), The Death of Procris (1500), The Discovery of Honey by Bacchus (1505–1510), The Fight between the Lapiths and the Centaurs (1515), The Myth of Prometheus (1515), etc.[73]\n\nA more serene classicism is perceived in central Italy, as in the Death of Adam (1452–1466) by Piero della Francesca, whose nude figures have the gravity of the sculpture of Phidias or Polyclitus, or the Apollo and Marsyas (1495) by Perugino, with a clear Praxitelian air. This classicism had its culmination in Raphael's Parnassus (1511), undoubtedly inspired by the Apollo of the Belvedere—which had been discovered in 1479—from which he recovered not only its slender anatomy, but also its rhythm, grace and harmony, glimpsed in the saints, poets and philosophers of the Stanze. However, he did not simply recreate the classical figures, but interpreted them according to his sense of design, to a sweet and harmonious conception of the artist's aesthetic ideal.[74] On the other hand, Raphael, whose work presents a synoptic vision of ideal beauty, was able to extract the most idealistic perfection from the most sensual of the senses. In the Three Graces (1505), he elaborated simple forms, not as ethereal as the graceful Botticellian Venus, but of a classicism that rather than copied from antiquity seems innate to the artist, a somewhat naive classicism, but of fresh vitality. In his Adam and Eve (1508) of the papal rooms, Raphael reproduced the female form of the first woman influenced by Leonardo's Leda, with a somewhat knotty volumetry. Later, from his work at La Farnesina, the pleasure villa of Agostino Chigi, his Triumph of Galatea (1511) stands out, inspired by the paintings of Nero's Domus Aurea, and for whose realization Raphael recognized that he had used different parts from different models, since none seemed to him sufficiently perfect—as legend has it that Apelles also did.[75]\n\nIn contrast, Leonardo da Vinci departed from classical canons, with naturalistic figures designed according to his extensive studies of anatomy. Early on he was inspired by the energetic forms of Pollaiuolo, and The Battle of Anghiari is influenced by Michelangelo's The Battle of Cascina. Later, his deepening in anatomy gave his figures a resounding realism, where the scientific interest can be glimpsed, but at the same time they denote a certain heroic attitude, of moral and human dignity, which gave them a serene vital intensity.[76] However, despite this interest in anatomy, which he captured in hundreds—perhaps thousands—of drawings, which today are scattered in many museums and private collections, in his paintings he only made a few nude representations,[77] such as Bacchus (or St. John the Baptist, 1510–1515), or his Leda and the Swan, of which he made at least three versions between 1504 and 1506, and which is the vindication of the naked woman as a symbol of creative life, and no longer as an unattainable ideal.[Note 5] For Leonardo, the study of anatomy served him more to know the proportions of the figure to be represented—even if she was dressed—than as an end in itself; thus, for example, there is a half-naked drawing of the famous Mona Lisa, La Gioconda (1503), now in the Musée Condé in Chantilly.[78]\n\nThe culmination of the Renaissance nude occurred in the work of Michelangelo, for whom the naked human body had a divine character that gave it a dignity unmatched by any other contemporary nude. Because of his Neoplatonic convictions, he idealized in an extreme way the emotion he felt before male beauty, so that the sensuality of his nudes becomes something transcendental, the expression of something superior and immaterial, ungraspable, sublime, pure, infinite. His figures are at once dominant and moving, of great power and great passion, of resounding vitality and intense spiritual energy. Even his religious works have lost the pathos of suffering inherent in the figure of the crucified Christ to show the Savior with a spiritual serenity that generates compassion more for his beauty than for his pain, as in the Vatican Pieta (1498–1499).[79] His first nude drawings show the vivacity of his nervous articulations, far from the soft classical contours, with a rich modeling far from any proportion or geometric scheme. His anatomy is knotty and tight, dynamic, where the thickness of the torso stands out, with marked muscles and solid contours, exaggerating the effects of torsion and foreshortened figures, as in the Drunken Bacchus (1496–1497), one of his first great sculptures. The David (1501–1504) in Florence still retains the Apollonian air of a balanced classicism, but interpreted in a personal way, where the torso may look like that of a Greek statue, but the disproportion of head and limbs denotes tension, and his defiant expression departs from the classical ethos. Likewise with the dramatic expression of his Slaves in the Louvre (Dying Slave and Rebellious Slave, 1513), which recall the Hellenistic art's noobide figures, and denote the influence of Laocoön (Michelangelo was one of the first to see the sculptural group, unearthed in 1506 near San Pietro in Vincoli). Similarly, his figures for the Medici tombs (1524) are reminiscent of Greek works: the male ones (The Day and The Twilight) to the Belvedere Torso, and the female ones (The Dawn and The Night) to the Vatican's Ariadne.[80]\n\nLater, his idea of a rotund and vibrant anatomy, but charged with emotional intensity, was embodied in his Adam of the Sistine Chapel (1508–1512), reminiscent of the Dionysus of the Parthenon pediment, but with a vital charge far removed from the harmonious Phidian sculpture. Similarly, the figures of the athletes (usually called simply ignudi, \"naked\") on the ceiling of the Sistine have the balance of athletic energy together with the transcendence of their sacred mission—they represent the souls of the biblical prophets—harmoniously exercising their mediating role between the physical and spiritual worlds, so that their physical beauty is a reflection of divine perfection. In other scenes, such as The Flood (1509), he also shows vigorous figures whose physical power reveals their spiritual strength. The Creation of Eve (1509–1510) presents a rotund, vigorous female figure, with very marked contours. On the other hand, the Christ of the Last Judgment (1536–1541) has the solemnity of an Apollo understood as sol justitiae, but with a rotundity—patent in his almost square torso—already far removed from the classical canons. His representation of Jesus is no longer the typical bearded figure of Byzantine tradition, but the effigy of an Olympian god or a Hellenistic king, closer to Alexander the Great than to a Jewish carpenter, with a more athletic build than one would expect from the mystical Christian ascetic.[81] In his last works, the three piéades (the Palestrina, the Duomo and the Rondanini Pietà), he completely abandoned the ideal of physical beauty, with distorted figures (Palestrina), angular (Duomo) or with a schematism close to the Gothic (Rondanini).[82]\n\nThe first to fully understand, since the great age of Greek sculpture, the identity of the nude with the great figurative art, was Michelangelo. Before him it had been studied with a scientific view, as a means of capturing the figure wrapped in clothing. Michelangelo saw that it was an end in itself and made the nude the supreme purpose of his art. For him, art and nude were synonymous.\n\n— Bernard Berenson, Italian Renaissance painters (1954)[83]\n\nIn the sixteenth century the nude had a wide diffusion thanks to the engravings published on classical Greco-Roman works, especially those produced by Marcantonio Raimondi. The Venetian school emerged, which made important contributions to the nude, not only in the continuity of certain classicist approaches, but also in the innovation and experimentation of new technical and stylistic ways. The Venetians managed to harmonize the nude within more elaborate compositions, whether indoors or within the framework of a natural landscape, while their chromatic and lighting innovations gave greater realism and sensuality to the nude, with large and exuberant figures that began to move away from the classical canon. This can be seen in Giovanni Bellini's Naked Young Woman in Front of a Mirror (1515), although the main initiator of this style was Giorgione, who was the first to structure the female nude within a general decorative scheme, as in his frescoes of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (1507–1508, now disappeared), in his Pastoral Concert (1510) or in his Sleeping Venus (1507–1510), whose reclining posture has been copied ad nauseam. It is worth noting that the physical typology of Giorgione's nudes, of generous proportions and wide waist, would dominate the Venetian female nude for a long time, and that it passed, through Dürer, to Germany and the Netherlands, enduring in the Baroque in the work of artists such as Rubens.[84]\n\nAn early imitator of Giorgione was Titian, whose Venus of Urbino (1538) and Pardo Venus (or Jupiter and Antiope, 1534–1540) reproduce the same posture as the Sleeping Venus, acquiring, however, greater fame. In Sacred and Profane Love (1514–1515) he captured the myth of Plato's Symposium of the celestial Venus and the mundane one recovered by Ficino and the Florentine neoplatonic school. The celestial Venus is the one who is naked, following the ideal of the classical nude, given the purity of her moral virtue, while the worldly one appears clothed, because of the shame of her immorality. In other works he continued with his prototype of woman of exuberant and fleshy forms, as in Bacchus and Ariadne (1520–1523), Penitent Magdalene (1531–1533), Venus and Musician (1547), Venus with an Organist, Cupid and a Dog (1550), Danae receiving the golden rain (1553), Venus and Adonis (1553), The Rape of Europa (1559–1562), Diana and Actaeon (1559), Diana and Callisto (1559), the two Bacchanals painted for Alfonso I d'Este (1518–1526), or his Venus Anadyomene (1520) from the Ellesmere collection, whose unabashed sensuality is the starting point of the nude as a theme in itself, which would be recovered in Impressionism.[86]\n\nDisciples of Titian were Paris Bordone (Sleeping Venus with Cupid, 1540; Bathsheba Bathing, 1549; Venus and Mars with Cupid, 1560) and Tintoretto, whose ambition—not entirely achieved—was to reunite Michelangelo's drawing with Titian's coloring. The works of the latter are large, with a multitude of figures, with dazzling lights that reflect the luminous quality of his beloved Venice. In his decoration of the Venetian Doge's Palace (1560–1578) he made an authentic apotheosis of the nude, with multiple figures from classical mythology (Mars, Minerva, Mercury, Bacchus, Ariadne, Vulcan, the Three Graces), in positions where the foreshortening is usually abundant, in a great variety of postures and perspectives. His other nude works include: Joseph and Potiphar's Wife (1544), Adam and Eve (1550–1552), Venus, Vulcan and Mars (1555), The Liberation of Arsínoe (1555–1556), Susanna and the Elders (1560–1565), The Origin of the Milky Way (1575–1582), Judith and Holofernes (1579), etc. His daughter, Marietta Robusti, followed in his footsteps, while serving as a model for her father on numerous occasions.[87]\n\nPaolo Veronese also mastered to perfection the coloring, wisely combined in infinite shades, as well as the composition, dedicated to recreate lavish, playful, ornamental scenes, emphasizing the pomp of the Doge's Venice. Even his religious scenes have a festive, joyful, worldly, sometimes somewhat irreverent character. However, his nudes were demure, restrained, modest, without showing anything explicit, just some naked area between tunics or folds of clothing, as in Allegory of Love I; Infidelity (1575–1580), The Creation of Eve (1575–1580), Mars and Venus (1580), Susanna and the Elders (1580) and Venus and Adonis (1580).[88]\n\nFor his part, Correggio moved away from all classicism to elaborate original compositions only subordinated to the overflowing imagination of the artist, not only in terms of forms and figures, but also in the chromatic games and lighting effects, influenced by Leonardo's sfumato. In works such as Venus and Cupid with a Satyr (or Jupiter and Antiope, 1524–1525), The Education of Cupid (1528), Danae (1530), Leda and the Swan (1531–1532) and Jupiter and Io (1531–1532), he shows figures in capricious, dynamic positions that stand out luminously from the rest of the painting, which is darker, thus focusing the main point of interest for the artist.[89]\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century, Mannerism emerged,[Note 6] with which modern art began in a certain way: things are not represented as they are, but as the artist sees them. Beauty is relativized, from the single Renaissance beauty, based on science, to the multiple beauties of Mannerism, derived from nature. For the mannerists, classical beauty is empty, soulless, counterposing a spiritual, dreamlike, subjective, unregulated beauty—summarized in Petrarch's formula non-so ché (\"I don't know what\").[90] The mannerist nude will be of elongated, exaggerated, slender forms, of an almost mannered elegance. Part, on the one hand, of the formal distortion of Michelangelo and, on the other, of the elegance of Parmigianino. A good example is the Allegory of Venus and Cupid (or Allegory of Passion, 1540–1545) by Bronzino, whose Venus, so slender and with an almost lascivious attitude, comes, however, by its zigzag posture from the dead Christ of the Michelangelo's Pietà. These slender figures of refined grace also abounded in sculpture, preferably in bronze, developed by artists such as Baccio Bandinelli (Hercules and Cacus, 1534, located next to Michelangelo's David in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence), Bartolomeo Ammannati (Leda and the Swan, 1535; Venus, 1558; Fountain of Neptune, 1563–1565), Benvenuto Cellini (Crucifix of El Escorial, 1539; Saltcellar of Francis I, 1540–1543; Ganymede, 1547; Perseus with the Head of Medusa, 1554) or Giambologna (Samson Slaying a Philistine, 1562; Mercury, 1564; Fountain of Neptune, 1565; Florence Triumphant over Pisa, 1570; Rape of the Sabine Women, 1582; Hercules and the Centaur Nessus, 1599).[91] On the other hand, the tragic side of the nude—that of Hellenistic pathos—was cultivated by Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, generally with religious subjects, which could better express Mannerist emotionalism, such as Rosso's Moses Defending the Daughters of Jethro (1523), whose flat, angular bodies are the antithesis of classicism.[92]\n\nDuring the 16th century, the acceptance of the nude as an artistic theme, which moved from Italy to the rest of Europe, generated a great demand for these works, especially in Germany and the Netherlands, by a bourgeois public that avidly consumed this type of work. The representation of the nude was so popular that it even appeared on the title page of Erasmus of Rotterdam's New Testament. One of the most popular artists in this field was Lucas Cranach the Elder, who throughout his work elaborated a more personal version of the Nordic nude of Gothic origin, which, while retaining its rounded forms, is shown more stylized and subject to classical canons, with long, slender legs, thin waist and gently undulating silhouette, as in Venus and Cupid (1509), The Nymph of the Fountain (1518), Lucretia (1525), Judgement of Paris (1527), Adam and Eve (1528), Apollo and Diana (1530), The Three Graces (1530), The Golden Age (1530), Venus (1532), Venus and Cupid stealing Honey (1534), Allegory of Justice (1537), The Fountain of Youth (1546), Diana and Actaeon (1550–1553), etc. His figures are presented with multiple props (hats, belts, veils, necklaces), which enhances the eroticism of his models, establishing an imagery that would often be repeated in the future.[93]\n\nAlbrecht Dürer inherited the forms of Gothic art so deeply rooted in his country, but evolved thanks to the study of Italian Renaissance classicism. Some of his early works show the Gothic female prototype of elongated figures with small breasts and bulging bellies, as in Hausfrau (1493), Women's Bath (1496) and The Four Witches (1497). Subsequently, he devoted himself to the study of proportions in the human body, trying to find the key to anatomical perfection, although without favorable results. However, in this way he approached a certain classicist style, as can be seen in his Adam and Eve of 1504, which shows that classical harmony was more a state of mind than a canon of geometric rules. Even so, he was not satisfied, and in his last works he returned to the bulbous forms of Gothic art, as in The Suicide of Lucretia (1518). An excellent engraver as well as painter, some of his best nudes are engravings, such as Berenice, The Dream of the Doctor and The Sea Monster, or allegories and the series of Imperial Triumphs, or his prints on the passion and death of Jesus and the lives of saints such as St. Jerome, St. Genevieve and St. Mary Magdalene. Dürer's work influenced many artists of the Germanic world, in works where Gothic forms intermingle with classical ideals, as can be seen in the work of Urs Graf (The Raging Army, 1520) and Niklaus Manuel Deutsch (Judgment of Paris, 1516–1528).[94]\n\nHans Baldung was also a disciple of Dürer, author of allegorical works of strong moralizing content, generally with personifications of death or the ages of man, recalling the ephemeral nature of life: St. Sebastian Triptych (1507), The Two Lovers and Death (1509–1511), The Three Ages of Woman and Death (1510), Eve, the Serpent and Death (1512), Three Witches (1514), Death and a Woman (1518–1520), Vanity (1529), Hercules and Antaeus (1530), Adam and Eve (1535), The Seven Ages of Woman (1544), etc. For his part, Hans Holbein the Younger was preferably the author of religious paintings and portraits, dealing little with the nude, of which, however, we must highlight his magnificent The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb (1521).[95]\n\nIn the Netherlands, Hieronymus Bosch represented a certain continuity of Gothic forms, although treated with greater naturalism and with an overflowing fantasy that would make his work a marvel of creativity and imagination. In The Garden of Earthly Delights (1480–1490), The Last Judgment (1482), The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things (1485) and The Haywain Triptych (1500–1502), the naked, human or subhuman form (demons, satyrs, mythological animals, monsters and fantastic creatures) proliferates in a paroxysm of lust that transcends any iconographic meaning and obeys only the feverish imagination of the artist. Pieter Bruegel the Elder also made works of wide panoramic and multitude of figures, with a predilection for landscapes and genre portraits, although his nudes are scarce. They are more evident in the work of his son, Jan Brueghel de Velours, author of landscapes with a proliferation of small nude figures, in mythological or biblical scenes. In Flanders, Jan Gossaert received the Raphaelesque influence, being the introducer in his country of the mythological fable, as in Neptune and Amphitrite (1516), The Metamorphosis of Hermaphrodite and Salmacis (1520) and Danae (1527).[96]\n\nIn France, art evolved rapidly from Gothic to Mannerism, with the Classicist influence of the early Renaissance hardly felt, mainly due to the stay in the works of the Palace of Fontainebleau of several Italian Mannerist artists (Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco Primaticcio, Benvenuto Cellini), who gave rise to the School of Fontainebleau, characterized by a courtly and sensualist taste, decorative, voluptuous, languid elegance, with a predominance of mural painting and stucco relief. Primaticcio's elegant and angular figures, with long limbs and small heads, became fashionable and remained in French art until the end of the 16th century. Some works of this school are by unknown artists, such as the Diana the Huntress (c. 1550) and the Portrait of Gabrielle d'Estrées and her sister the Duchess of Villars (1594), of a fine eroticism of gallant court. Of known artists are: Eve Prima Pandora (1550), by Jean Cousin the Elder; The Bath of Diana (1550), by François Clouet; The Awakening of a Lady, by Toussaint Dubreuil; and, in sculpture, Diana the Huntress (1550) by Jean Goujon, and The Three Graces (1560) by Germain Pilon. The nude was also reflected in this same environment in all kinds of minor arts, from tapestry to ceramics and goldsmithing, such as the famous enameled plate with the Story of Adam and Eve in six passages, by Pierre Rémond.[97]\n\nIn Spain, the Renaissance influence arrived late, with Gothic forms surviving until almost the middle of the 16th century. Otherwise, the innovations were more stylistic than thematic, with religious themes predominating as in medieval times. El Greco was one of the main innovators of Spanish painting of the time: trained in the Venetian school, from this school comes the intense coloring of his works, although his long and disproportionate figures show a certain formal expressionism rather than Italian classicist naturalism. Although most of his works are religious, in them he does not fail to show nude figures more or less justified by the theme, being able to count in all his production more than a hundred nudes. This can be seen in works such as The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian (1577–1578), St. John the Baptist (1577–1579), Holy Trinity (1577–1580), The Martyrdom of St. Maurice (1580–1582), Christ on the Cross Adored by Two Donors (1590), The Baptism of Christ (1596–1600), The Crucifixion (1597–1600), St. Martin and the Beggar (1597–1600), Christ Driving the Money Changers from the Temple (1609), The Vision of Saint John (1609–1614), Laocoön and his Sons (1614), etc. Also as a sculptor he left works such as his Epimetheus and Pandora (1600–1610) of the Prado Museum, where it is worth noting the realism of the sexual organs of both characters, treated without concealment.[98]\n\nIn the rest of the Spanish Renaissance artistic production, decorum and modesty predominated, golden rules of Spanish art that were elevated to art theory in treatises such as Vicente Carducho's Allegories of Painting, Francisco Pacheco's Art of Painting, or Jusepe Martínez's Practicable speeches. In this context, the nude human figure is only found in the religious sphere, especially in sculptural imagery, such as Alonso Berruguete's St. Sebastian (1526–1532), Juan de Juni's The Burial of Christ (1541–1545) or Juan Martínez Montañés' St. Jerome penitent (1598). The exceptions to this rule are very few, such as the fresco of the Story of Danae in the Royal Palace of El Pardo (1563), by Gaspar Becerra, with a Michelangelesque influence.[99]\n\nBaroque\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Baroque\n\nThe Baroque[Note 7] developed between the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century. It was a time of great disputes in the political and religious fields, with a division emerging between the Catholic counter-reformist countries, where the absolutist state and the Protestant countries (of a more parliamentary sign) ere strengthened. Art became more refined and ornate, with the survival of a certain classicist rationalism, but with more dynamic and dramatic forms, with a taste for the surprising and the anecdotal, for optical illusions and the blows of effect.[100]\n\nDuring the Baroque period, the female nude continued to predominate as an object of pleasure for aristocratic patrons, who enjoyed this type of composition, where women generally played a subordinate role to men. Along with the mythological theme, the custom of making allegorical portraits where naked women represented concepts such as Justice, Truth, Generosity, etc. began.[101] The Baroque nude accentuated the effects of torsion and dynamism present in Mannerism and in the work of Michelangelo, from whom they took the spiral composition—which Michelangelo introduced in his Allegory of Victory in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, and which allowed a more solid base to support the weight of the torso. Thus, the classical \"heroic diagonal\" became the \"heroic spiral\", the way in which a violent and forced movement could express in a plausible way the dramatism and effectiveness of baroque art.[102]\n\nThe Baroque had as its main herald of the nude Peter Paul Rubens, whose robust and carnally sensual female figures marked an epoch in the aesthetic concept of beauty of his time. However, despite this carnal exuberance, the work of Rubens—also the author of numerous works on religious themes—does not lack a certain idealism, a certain feeling of natural purity that gives his canvases a kind of dreamy candor, an optimistic and integrating vision of man's relationship with nature. Rubens attached great importance to the design of his figures, and for this he studied in depth the work of previous artists, from whom he took his best resources, especially—in what concerns the nude—from Michelangelo, Titian and Marcantonio Raimondi. He was a master in finding the precise tonality for the flesh tones of the skin—equaled only by Titian and Renoir—as well as its different textures and the multiple variants of the effects of brightness and the reflections of light on the flesh. He was also concerned with the movement of the body, and with giving weight and solidity to his figures. However, he did not neglect the psychological aspect and facial expression, and in the faces of his figures one can appreciate a carefree happiness, a certain pride in knowing they are beautiful, but without conceit, and a certain vital gratitude that the artist himself felt before the gifts of life.[103] Among his works related to the nude are worth mentioning: The Death of Seneca (1611–1615), Venus, Cupid, Bacchus and Ceres (1612–1613), Cupid and Psyche (1612–1615), The Headdress of Venus (1615), Daniel in the Lions' Den (1615), Perseus and Andromeda (1622), The Arrival of Marie de Medici at Marseille (1622–1625), The Triumph of Truth (1622–1625), Minerva Protecting Peace from Mars (1629), Venus and Adonis (1635), The Three Graces (1636–1639, where are portrayed the two women of his life, Isabella Brandt and Hélène Fourment), The Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus (1636), The Birth of the Milky Way (1636–1638), Diana and Callisto (1637–1638), Diana and her nymphs surprised by the fauns (1639–1640), The Judgment of Paris (1639), etc.. Author of more than two thousand paintings, he is perhaps the artist who has represented more nudes in history.[104]\n\nAs for the religious theme, Rubens demonstrated the same synthesizing capacity as in his other nudes, giving his figures a physical entity that enhanced their spiritual aspect, as in his two works for the Antwerp Cathedral, The Elevation of the Cross (1611) and The Descent from the Cross (1613), which again show the Michelangelesque influence, as well as the assimilation of the undulating movement of Laocoön. In these images, the color of the flesh plays an essential role, contrasting the pale and pale figure of Christ with the intense color of the rest of the figures, which gives greater effect to the drama of the scene. The same effect appears in the Crucifixion (1620) of the Boymans Van Beuningen Museum, where the different chromatism of the figures of Christ and the thieves is added to the effect of the stormy light, while the differentiation in the anatomies of the different figures emphasizes the ideal physique of Jesus as opposed to the crude materiality of the thieves.[105]\n\nDisciples of Rubens were Anthony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens: the first, a great portraitist, evolved towards a more personal style, with a strong Italian influence, as in his Pietà on Prado (1618–1620) and the Saint Sebastian of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, or in Diana and Endymion surprised by a satyr (1622–1627) and The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis (1620). Jordaens was more faithful to his master—without reaching his height—as evidenced by the proliferation of nudes almost comparable to those of the Antwerp genius: The Satyr and the Peasant (undated), The Rape of Europa (1615–1616), Fertility (1623), Pan and Syrinx (1625), Apollo and Marsyas (1625), Prometheus Bound (1640), The Daughters of Cecrops Finding Erichthonius (1640), The Triumph of Bacchus (1645), The Rest of Diana (1645–1655), The Abundance of the Earth (1649), etc.[106]\n\nOn the opposite side of Rubens' idealism is the work of Rembrandt, heir to the rounded forms of the Nordic nude of Gothic origin, with figures treated realistically, just as exuberant as those of Rubens, but more mundane, without hiding the folds of the flesh or the wrinkles of the skin, with a pathos that accentuates the raw materiality of the body, in its most humiliating and pitiful aspect. Rembrandt appeals to nature against the rules, moved by a defiant veristic honesty, and perhaps by a feeling of compassion towards the less favored creatures of society: old men, prostitutes, drunks, beggars, the handicapped. For him, imbued with a biblical sense of Christianity, poverty and ugliness were inherent in nature, and as worthy of attention as wealth and beauty. This revelatory sense of imperfection is denoted in such works as Diana at the Bath (1631), Naked Woman Sitting on a Mound (1631), Cleopatra (1637), Woman Bathing Her Feet at a Brook (1658), etc. Nor did he mind showing the crudest of human anatomy in The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632). More pleasing are Susanna and the Elders (1634), Adam and Eve in Paradise (1638), Bacchante contemplated by a faun and Danae receiving the golden rain (1636–1647, where he portrayed his wife, Saskia van Uylenburgh). An attempt to show perhaps sensual beauty was his Bathsheba at the Bath (1654), where he depicts her lover, Hendrickje Stoffels, which despite its rounded and generous forms, shown with honesty, manages to convey a feeling of nobility, not ideal, but sublime, while his meditative expression provides inner life to the carnal figure, and gives it a spiritual aura, reflecting the Christian concept of the body as a receptacle of the soul.[107]\n\nIn Italy the work of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, architect and sculptor who staged the pomp of papal Rome in a sumptuous and grandiloquent way, and whose works express the dynamic and sinuous movement so characteristic of the Baroque, as denoted in his main sculptural groups: Aeneas, Anchises and Ascanius fleeing Troy (1618–1619), The Rape of Proserpina (1621–1622), David throwing his sling (1623–1624), Truth Unveiled by Time (1645–1652) and Apollo and Daphne (1622–1625), where his mastery of modeling, the drama of the action, his daring foreshortenings and his decorative sense, often captured in floating vestments of fragile balance, are manifested. Another great creator was Caravaggio, who initiated a style known as naturalism or caravagism, based on strict natural reality and characterized by the use of chiaroscuro (tenebrism) to achieve dramatic and surprising effects thanks to the interaction between light and shadow. Eccentric and provocative artist, among his works stand out: Saint John the Baptist (Youth with a Ram) (1602), Victorious Cupid (1602–1603), The Entombment of Christ (1602–1604), The Flagellation of Christ (1607), Christ at the Column (1607), Saint Jerome Writing (1608), The Raising of Lazarus (1609), etc. His followers were Giovanni Battista Caracciolo (The Young St. John in the Desert, 1610–1620; Sleeping Cupid, 1616; Martyrdom of St. Sebastian, 1625) and Artemisia Gentileschi (Susanna and the Elders, 1610; Danae, 1612; Cleopatra, 1621; Joseph and Potiphar's Wife, 1622; Sleeping Venus, 1625–30).[108]\n\nBetween Italy and France, another current called classicism originated, equally realistic, but with a more intellectual and idealized concept of reality, and where the mythological theme was evocative of a world of perfection and harmony, comparable to the Roman Arcadia. It began in the Bolognese School, by the hand of Annibale Carracci, whose Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne (1597–1602) presents a procession full of nudes, which also abound in the decoration that the artist made in the Farnese Palace in Rome. In Corpse of Christ (1583–1585) he was inspired by Mantegna's work of the same name. Another member of the school was Guido Reni, who produced numerous mythological allegories and paintings of gods and heroes whose nudity highlights their dignity and magnificence, as in Atalanta and Hippomenes (1612), Samson drinking from the jawbone of an ass (1611–1612) and Rape of Deianira (1620–1621). Francesco Albani sought in mythology a graceful and amiable subject matter to which he was naturally inclined, as in his series of the Seasons (1616–1617, which includes Winter or The Triumph of Diana, Autumn or Venus and Adonis, Spring or Venus in her toilette and Summer or Venus at Vulcan's Forge), Unarmed Loves (1621–1633), Mercury and Apollo (1623–1625), Diana and Actaeon (1625–1630) and Allegory of Water (1627). Guido Cagnacci was one of the last representatives of the school, exporting classicism to the Germanic sphere: Allegory of Human Life, The Death of Cleopatra (1658), St. Jerome (1659), Mary Magdalene Unconscious (1665).[109]\n\nIn the French field, Nicolas Poussin, an artist of a serene classicism, was perhaps the inaugurator of the academic nude, for being cultured and idealized, based on the representation in images of the erudite culture that had mythology and ancient history as its thematic base. Of Raphaelesque influence, he was interested in anatomy, elaborating conscientiously all his works, conceived both in a plastic and intellectual sense. He was interested in archaeology, inaugurating with Claude Lorrain the so called \"historical landscape\", where a landscape frame is used to place various historical or mythological figures, along with architecture or ruins of antiquity. His works include: Apollo and Daphne (1625), Apollo and Bacchus (1627), Echo and Narcissus (1628), Parnassus (1630), Cephalus and Aurora (1630), Midas and Bacchus (1630), The Empire of Flora (1631), The Triumph of Galatea (1634), Bacchanal (1634–1635), Adoration of the Golden Calf (1636), Venus and Aeneas (1639), etc.[110] Other classicist-inspired artists were: Simon Vouet (Cupid and Psyche, 1626; Sleeping Venus, 1630–1640), Charles Le Brun (Death of Meleager, 1658; The Labors of Hercules, 1658–1661) and Jacques Blanchard (Angelica and Medoro, 1630; Danae, 1630–1633; Venus and the Three Graces surprised by a mortal, 1631–1633).[111]\n\nIn the \"full baroque\" (second half of the seventeenth century), decorative and ornate style, with a predilection for optical effects (trompe-l'oeil) and luxurious and exuberant scenography, many artists worked on the decoration of the Palace of Versailles, a style that spread to the rest of France. The nude developed notably in sculpture, filling squares and gardens throughout France, with artists such as Pierre Puget (Milon of Crotona, 1671–1682; Perseus and Andromeda, 1685) and François Girardon (Apollo tended by the nymphs, 1666; The Rape of Proserpina, 1677). He also excelled in the field of applied arts, especially in bronze and porcelain, and even carving and stewing in cabinetmaking.[112]\n\nSpain continued to be an artistically chaste and demure country at this time, where the nude was seen with modest eyes. Thus, an artist like Bartolomé Esteban Murillo only shows nude figures in the infantile forms that populate his scenes of the Virgin, with her child Jesus and her putti, her little angels that play and fly everywhere in the sacred space of his works. However, at this time a certain openness began, and a man of the Church like Friar Juan Rizi justified the nude human figure in his Treatise on Wise Painting, of which he made a detailed anatomical study, accompanied by numerous illustrations in his own handwriting.[113] It should also be noted that the Hispanic monarchs were great collectors of nudes, from Charles V to Philip IV, and for this purpose was intended the Golden Tower of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, once a real museum of the nude.[114]\n\nThe nude in Spain continued to be predominantly of religious theme, as can be seen in the work of Francisco Ribalta, Jusepe de Ribera, Francisco de Zurbarán, Gregorio Fernández and Pedro de Mena. Some exceptions can be seen in Ribera—perhaps due to his stay in Italy—such as his Drunken Silenus (1626), his Apollo and Marsyas (1637) or his images of Ixion (1632) and Prometheus (1630), or in the Christ's Descent into Limbo (1646–1652) by Alonso Cano. Zurbarán also painted some pictures of Hercules for the Torre de la Parada, commissioned by Velázquez.[115]\n\nBut undoubtedly the great genius of the Spanish Baroque was Diego Velázquez, painter to Philip IV, whose magnificent production is one of the milestones in the history of art. Velázquez enjoyed great freedom in his work, undoubtedly because of his position as royal painter, so he was able to paint more nudes than any other Spanish artist of his time. Even so, he was constrained by clerical censorship, so he had to change the iconographic sense of some of his works, which went from mythological nudes to genre or costumbrist scenes: thus, what would have been a bacchanal with a Dionysian theme became The Drinkers (1628–1629), and the adultery of Mars and Venus became Vulcan's Forge (1630).[116] He had less problems—logically—in his religious representations, such as his Christ Crucified (1639), or in Christ after the flagellation (1632) and Joseph's Tunic (1630), where the nude has a clear classicist, almost academic component, a fact that is demonstrated in the anatomical conception of certain figures, although they later appear dressed, as in the case of The Spinners (1657), where the Michelangelesque influence of the Sistine Chapel is evident.[117]\n\nHowever, the Sevillian painter was able to explore himself with the Venus at her Mirror (1647–1651), one of the most magnificent and famous nudes in history. It is a nude of great originality, especially for being presented from behind, a fact not very common at the time, and whose conception perhaps shows the influence of the Borghese Hermaphrodite, which Velázquez surely knew in Italy. On the other hand, the attitude of Venus, who looks at herself in the mirror, probably represents an allegory of vanity. The brilliant painter made other nudes—now lost—such as a Cupid and Psyche and a Venus and Adonis that belonged to Philip IV, a female nude owned by Domingo Guerra Coronel and a reclining Venus that was in the possession of the painter himself at his death.[32]\n\nRococo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rococo\n\nDeveloped in the 18th century—in coexistence at the beginning of the century with the Baroque, and at the end with Neoclassicism—[Note 8] it meant the survival of the main artistic manifestations of the Baroque, with a more emphasized sense of decoration and ornamental taste, which are taken to a paroxysm of richness, sophistication and elegance. The progressive social rise of the bourgeoisie and scientific advances, as well as the cultural environment of the Enlightenment, led to the abandonment of religious themes in favor of new themes and more worldly attitudes, highlighting luxury and ostentation as new factors of social prestige.[118]\n\nThe nude at this time was heir to Rubens—from whom they took especially the color and texture of the skin—and had greater erotic connotations, of a refined and courtly eroticism, subtle and evocative, but not without provocation and a certain irreverent character, abandoning any hint of classicist idealization and assuming the mundane character of the genre. In France, where it developed more fully, a Gothic air that had not completely abandoned French art during the Renaissance survives in its figures, and which is reflected in elongated figures, with small breasts and prominent stomachs. In the middle of the century, the type of small, slender figure (the petite) became more popular, as can be seen in the pictorial work of Boucher (Diana Resting after her Bath) or the sculptural work of Clodion (Nymph and satyr, Girl playing with her dog). It also began to represent the nude from behind, until then considered more lewd and little represented, except on rare occasions, as the famous Venus at her mirror by Velazquez, having examples such as The Judgment of Paris by Watteau or the Resting Girl by Boucher.[119]\n\nJean-Antoine Watteau was one of the initiators of the style, with his scenes of gallant parties and bucolic landscapes full of mythical characters or, when not, anonymous people enjoying life. Influenced by Rubens and the Venetian school, his palette was brightly colored, with a nervous style of rapid, expressive and vibrant brushstrokes. His nudes are scarce, but they are true masterpieces, elaborated with care and great elegance: in addition to The Judgment of Paris (1718–1721) it is worth remembering Fountain Nymph (1708), Unarmed Love (1715), Jupiter and Antiope (1715–1716), Diana in the Bath (1715–1716) and Spring (1716). Watteau's followers were several artists who followed the master's gallant style: François Lemoyne (Hercules and Omphale, 1724), Charles-Joseph Natoire (Psyche in her toilette, 1735) and Jean François de Troy (The Bath of Diana and her Nymphs, 1722–1724; Susanna and the Elders, 1727).[120]\n\nFrançois Boucher mastered perspective to perfec"
