By placing the figures on the floor, he realized that they made up two groups that seemed to correspond with what he was looking for. The male figures in his sculptures usually represented him or his brother. The female figures represented the prostitutes he would frequent. Giacometti studied the human head throughout his life and was fascinated by the human eyes, which he believed were the core of humans and of life. After witnessing two deaths, this fascination heightened and he strove to convey this in his sculptures. \"Biography of an Œuvre.\" Foundation-Giacometti. N.p..
