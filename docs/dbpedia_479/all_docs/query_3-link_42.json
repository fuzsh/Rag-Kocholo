        "text": "The shape of this work is an extension of the cubist-influenced sculptures in the shape of plates with primitive and totemic influences that Giacometti was making in the years 1927-1928. While in the previous pieces the signs in relief made on the plates were very marked, here the relief is very subtle, made of light hollows, fine incisions and delicate curves. It is the light that animates the work, creating an ambiguity between the solid and the hollow following trails that sculptors were exploring at the time. Commenting on a similar piece in “Cahiers d’art” in 1929, Christian Zervos contrasted it to the Cycladic plates, regretting: “if one were to suppress any part of Giacometti’s exhibited work, one would notice that that work would end up disorganised, by the very fact that its unity rests more on appearance than on qualities intrinsic to the art of sculpture.” This critical comment is on the contrary, a perfect summing up of Giacometti’s effort in condensing the figure and space that surround it in an indissoluble way. The first exhibition of this work, initially in plaster, is not known with any certainty. It was cast in bronze after the artist’s death.\n\n2005 Alberto Giacometti au donjon de Vez, Vez (France), Donjon de Vez, from June 18th to October 2nd 2005\n\n2006 Alberto Giacometti - Bror Hjorth, Stockholm (Sweden), Liljevalchs Konsthall, from September 23rd 2006 to January 7th 2007, no. 8\n\n2007 L'atelier d'Alberto Giacometti, Paris (France), Musée national d'art moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, from October 15th 2007 to February 11th 2008, no. 89\n\n2011 Alberto Giacometti.
