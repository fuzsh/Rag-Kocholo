        "text": "By: Sophia Perkins, ART106, Fall 2015\n\nDavid Smith’s sculpture, Two Box Structure was created in 1961, and can be seen as closely associated to the Abstract Expressionist movement due to its use of gestural abstraction, form and raw, industrial materials. Some of the important elements and principles of design used in David Smith’s Two Box Structure are balance, unity, and scale. David Smith was an American Sculptor who stated that his sculptures were “made for the outdoors.” (Kleiner, 910). Two Box Structure, on display at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, is not outside. Even so, the placement gives the impression that the piece is connected with the outdoors because it is placed in an open space in front of a large window that overlooks a body of water.\n\nThe sculpture itself is very large, roughly ten feet tall and three feet wide, and stands on a pedestal. The pedestal is a muted cream color whereas the sculpture itself is monochromatic grey steel. Because sculptures are different from paintings in that they can be viewed from just about any angle, there is no wrong way to look at a sculpture. This does make it somewhat difficult to separate the middle ground, foreground, and background. Even so, the focal point of this work is the two squares. The eyes of the viewer are immediately drawn to these shapes.\n\nThe form of this piece is dynamic. Aside from the two boxes for which the sculpture is named, there are many beams. These beams cross and overlap each other. These beams are very flat and they very in length. They help with eye flow throughout the work. The style of this sculpture is very geometric, however, the thin metal beams that cross and overlap and bend at strange angles throughout the piece disrupt this theme of geometric shapes. This disruption ultimately helps with eye flow and balance. Because these beams are uneven and because they bend at different angles, they make the piece asymmetrical. Another part of the sculpture that lends to this asymmetry is that at the very top there is a circular shape. This circle looks very odd among the other rectangles and squares.\n\nIn addition to this the sculpture’s form is very tall and narrow. Although it is made of steel, it seems frail. It seems to draw at least a little inspiration from the Postwar Expressionist works such as that of Alberto Giacometti. Giacometti’s Man Pointing, is another sculpture that is very narrow and frail-looking, although it is significantly smaller than David Smith’s Two Box Structure (Kleiner, 901). Even though Giacometti’s work is different in that it is figurative and made of a different material, in this case bronze (Kleiner, 901), there are a few similarities between the pieces. Despite the many differences in the works they are similar in that they are very simplified sculptures and they are both thin and tall in form.\n\nIn addition to the form, the texture is also important. Light also plays an important role in this piece, because of the reflective surfaces of the metal and the relationship of the sculpture to the space around it. The viewer can see evidence of the artist’s hand because the flat surfaces of the boxes look like they have been scratched by steel wool. “Smith added gestural elements reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism by burnishing the metal with steel wool,” (Kleiner, 910). These scratches on the sculpture’s surface appear random and disorganized. Smith stated that he rubbed the surface of his sculptures in order to get rid of any ‘blemishes’ and to allow the surface to be more reflective. (Bruce.) The spontaneity of these markings on the surface resembles the work of another Abstract Expressionist painter, Jackson Pollock. Like Pollock, Smith’s scratched surface appears to have no pattern or purpose except to show both movement and the hand of the artist as a part of the work itself. However, unlike Smith, Pollock used ‘gestural abstraction’ in paintings, with the use of color. (Kleiner, 903).\n\nThe materials as well as the craftsmanship of the sculpture imply that the sculpture is a part of Abstract Expressionism. The material is an unpolished, rough, steel grey. Many works of Abstract Expressionism relied on the use of rough textures. The steel beams bend somewhat awkwardly and are attached in a way that is not clean or precise. Because the sculpture is non objective, however, this messy attachment of the beams give the sculpture an almost mangled or deformed look, which ties in with themes of Abstract Expressionism.\n\nThis, however, was intentional and serves to make the piece more interesting. The messy technique with which the bars are attached as well as the texture serve to make the piece seem less mechanical or mass produced. Yet, his choice of stainless steel contrasts this idea. This juxtaposition of material and craftsmanship make the piece more interesting and complex.\n\nIn an interview, Smith stated that “…surfaces, planes have their own properties from as well as in color, and then color adds another challenge,” (Bruce). So in order to keep the work focused and simple he chose to make it monochromatic. This monochromic color scheme serves to unify the sculpture.\n\nIn addition to this choice of color, Smith’s Two Box Structure has been placed in front of a large window. This window allows for light to flow into the room and cover the sculpture. The surface of the sculpture reflects the light and colors around it so that the sculpture changes constantly with shadows and reflections and the sunlight as it changes through the day. Two Box Structure is constantly changing as the light around it changes and is therefore in a constant state of reaction with its environment.\n\nDavid Smith’s Two Box Structure is a piece that can be most closely associated with Abstract Expressionism because of the use of texture, gestural abstraction, the use of raw steel materials, as well as the form of the piece.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBruce Minnix, dir. “David Smith: Cubes and Anarchy.” YouTube.
