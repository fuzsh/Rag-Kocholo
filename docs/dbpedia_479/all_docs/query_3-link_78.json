        "text": "She was the first monumental sculpture in Giacometti’s work, presented face on, with no arms or legs, on a pedestal. She is an inaccessible, vertical figure, the hieratism heralding the Standing Women, and yet a symbol of fertility from the concave shape of her stomach receptacle.\n\nThe bronze version, cast in 1954 by the Susse foundry, is twenty centimetres bigger than the original plaster one exhibited at the Salon des Tuileries in 1927 with the title Sculpture.\n\nAlberto Giacometti made this sculpture having been influenced by his visit of the African and Oceanian Art exhibition held at the Musée des arts décoratifs de Paris during the winter of 1923-1924.\n\n“Spoon Woman curves on its sole foot, a large curving concave stomach-womb, under a small bust, dominated by an eye in the minuscule head”. (Marcelin Pleynet, in cat. Musée d’Art et d’Industrie, Saint-Etienne, summer 1981.)"
