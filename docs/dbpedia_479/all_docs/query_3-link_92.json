        "text": "TATE MODERN\n\nAlberto Giacometti 1901-1966, Man Pointing 1947, bronze sculpture, Tate, purchased 1949. © The Estate of Alberto Giacometti (Fondation Giacometti, Paris and ADAGP, Paris), licensed in the UK by ACS and DACS, London 2016\n\nTate Modern’s major exhibition of the work of Alberto Giacometti will show the full evolution of the artist’s work, including previously unseen plasters and drawings. Through unparalleled access to\n\nthe Fondation Alberto and Annette Giacometti’s extraordinary collection and archive, this ambitious and wide-ranging retrospective will focus on Giacometti’s influences and experimental practice across five decades.\n\nDavid Austen on\n\nAlberto Giacometti’s Hour of the Traces 1930\n\nDavid Austen\n\nIt is always smaller and more fragile than I remember. Its title is redolent of deep night, stained sheets and dragged bodies, while the cage-like structure is reminiscent of the scaffold and the guillotine, or a charred building. Above, attached by twisted bent wire to the roof beams like an early television aerial, are three white shapes: an upside down “L” or blind man’s cane, a crescent or shooting comet and a broken moon. These shapes could just as well be impaled body parts: a gaping head and a long skinny penis or tongue. This is a place of medieval torture or an ancient object from an Egyptian tomb. It is a grisly, cruel scene – none of the gaiety, humour and bird-like sounds that emanate from a Klee or Miró. “I work to please the dead” Giacometti said.\n\nDropped down into the body of the cage and held by a trembling wire is a small plaster heart. It is a pendulum in a Swiss clock, a beating heart from a Poe story, or a heart for a tin man. It makes me think of weight and gravity, the terrible lonely ache of love, passing moments and the “unbearable lightness of being”. I have a photograph I must have taken a very long time ago in Tate of the little plaster heart hanging by its wire. Now and then it surfaces to the top of a big pile of images I have in my studio. I always stop and look and think how something so simple can work so well, and it’s always going to be there.\n\nHour of the Traces was purchased with assistance from the Friends of the Tate Gallery in 1975, and is on view at Tate Modern until July 2005\n\nTATE MODERN REUNITES RARELY SEEN PLASTER SCULPTURES BY GIACOMETTI\n\nA celebrated group of plaster sculptures will be brought together for the first time since they were made in 1956 for Tate Modern’s major Giacometti retrospective. All six Women of Venice plaster works created for the 1956 Venice Biennale will be reunited for the first time in 60 years. They will be shown alongside two further plaster sculptures from this series, which Giacometti unveiled at the Kunsthalle Berne that same year. The works have been specially restored and reassembled for Tate Modern’s exhibition by the Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti, Paris. It will offer a once in the lifetime opportunity to see this important group of fragile works as the artist originally intended.\n\nGiacometti was chosen to represent France at the 1956 Venice Biennale. He showed a group of newly made plaster sculptures for the exhibition, all of which depict an elongated standing female nude. These works represent a crucial stage in Giacometti’s artistic development and were the result of the study of his wife Annette, one of his most important models. The sculptures can be seen as a culmination of the artist’s lifelong experimentations to depict the reality of the human form.\n\nWhile Giacometti is best known for his bronze figures, Tate Modern will reposition him as an artist with a far wider interest in materials and textures, especially plaster, clay and paint. Over the course of about three weeks, Giacometti moulded each of the Women of Venice in clay before casting them in plaster and reworking them with a knife to further accentuate their surface. The elasticity and malleability of these materials allowed him to work in an inventive way. Giacometti also embellished the surface of several works in the series with red and black paint, an important element of his practice that can only be experienced by seeing the original plaster sculptures.\n\nThanks to unparalleled access to the Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti’s extraordinary collection and archive, Tate Modern has been able to bring together these rarely seen works. The extensive restoration project carried out by the Fondation will offer visitors a new perspective on Giacometti’s working methods. The works have been returned to their original state showing the paintwork and penknife marks not visible on the later bronze casts. The exhibition will also include other important plaster sculptures, drawings and sketch books that have never been shown before, including The Nose c.1947-9, Medium Figure III 1948-9 and Woman Leoni 1947-58.\n\nAlberto Giacometti is presented in The Eyal Ofer Galleries , supported by Maryam and Edward Eisler, with additional support from the Giacometti Exhibition Supporters Circle, Tate Patrons, Tate Americas Foundation and Tate Members.\n\nopen from 10 May to 10 October 2017\n\nhttps://www.fondation-giacometti.fr\n\nEVENT LOG\n\nIf you want to announce your event in"
