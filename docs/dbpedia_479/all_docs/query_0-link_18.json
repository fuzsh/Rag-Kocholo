        "text": "1914–15\n\nAlberto Giacometti spent his childhood in Stampa. While very young, he was initiated by his father into drawing and painting. In December 1914, he made his first sculpture: a bust of his brother Diego, who became his main model. His brother Bruno, his sister Ottilia and his mother also sat for him.\n\nIn 1915, he realised his first oil painting, ”Still Life with Apples” (Nature morte aux pommes). All his life he kept those first works in his studio.\n\n1915–19\n\nHe studied at the Protestant senior school of Schiers, near Coire.\n\n1919–20\n\nHe interrupted his studies and enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts, then at Geneva’s École des Arts et Métiers. Under the influence of his father, he made several paintings in a neo-impressionist style.\n\n1920\n\nHe left school. He accompanied his father to Venice, where Giovanni officially represented Switzerland at the Biennale. Alberto discovered Tintoretto, then visited Padua, where he saw Giotto’s frescoes. In November, he visited Florence, where he discovered Egyptian art, followed by Rome. The influence of Egyptian sculpture was crucial for the evolution of his art.\n\n1921\n\nHe settled in Rome at his father’s cousin’s home, then in a small studio in Via Ripetta. He travelled to Naples and Pompeii, before returning to Maloja for the summer. During that period, he made countless copies of works by the Old Masters.\n\nOn 3 September, he began a journey with a Dutch librarian named Pieter van Meurs. His elderly travel companion would die in front of him two days later. Giacometti’s work would be influenced by this traumatic experience of death on numerous occasions.\n\n1922\n\nIn January, he moved to Paris to study sculpture in the class of Antoine Bourdelle at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. He stayed there until 1927. His sculptures of the time evolved to embrace post-cubism and primitivism.\n\n1925\n\nHe rented a small studio in rue Froidevaux, near the Montparnasse Cemetery, where his brother Diego joined him. Diego started sitting for his brother again and began helping him in his work. Alberto met Pierre Matisse, son of the painter Henri Matisse, who was to represent him in his New York gallery. He sculpted and painted the portrait of Flora Mayo, an American artist he met at the Grande Chaumière. First participation in the Salon des Tuileries, and first commission from the collector Josef Müller.\n\n1926\n\nOn 1 December, he moved into the studio at 46, rue Hippolyte-Maindron, where he would remain until his death.\n\n1927\n\nHe exhibited for the second time at the Salon des Tuileries, alongside Constantin Brâncuși and Ossip Zadkine in the room for the avant-garde.\n\n1928\n\nHe made his first “plaques” (“flat figures”), among them ”Gazing Head”, which he presented at the exhibition ”Italian Artists of Paris” (Les artistes italiens de Paris).\n\nA version of that work was bought the following year by the Argentinian collector Elvira de Alvear, and another by the Vicomte de Noailles.\n\n1929\n\nJeanne Bucher exhibited his work in her gallery. He met artists Jean Cocteau and André Masson, who introduced him to the avant-garde milieu, then writers Louis Aragon, Georges Bataille and the art historian Carl Einstein. First enthusiastic article on Giacometti by Michel Leiris in the avant-garde magazine ”Documents”.\n\nHe signed a one-year contract with Galerie Pierre.\n\nHe met the photographer Eli Lotar.\n\n1930–1931\n\nThe photographer Man Ray presented him to the interior designer Jean-Michel Frank, for whom he made his first decorative art objects.\n\nAt Galerie Pierre he exhibited ”Suspended Ball”, which Salvador Dalí named as the prototype for “objects with a symbolic function”.\n\nHe officially became a member of André Breton’s surrealist group and took part in its activities.\n\n1932\n\nFirst solo exhibition in Paris at Galerie Pierre Colle. Christian Zervos wrote an article in ”Cahiers d’art” illustrated with photos taken by Man Ray in Giacometti’s studio.\n\n1933\n\nFirst print for the illustration of the novel ”Putting My Foot in It” (Les Pieds dans le plat) by René Crevel. He published several texts in the magazine ”Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution” and, at Tériade’s request, in the magazine ”Minotaure”. He took part in the surrealist exhibition at Galerie Pierre Colle where he sold ”Table” to the Noailles.\n\nHis father died a few days later, on 25 June.\n\n1934\n\nIn the following months, Giacometti made ”Head-Skull”, ”Invisible Object” and ”Cube”, as a last portrait of his father. He began to distance himself from the surrealist movement, by going back to working from nature.\n\nIn December, the Julien Levy Gallery organised his first solo exhibition in New York.\n\n1935\n\nBreak with the surrealist group. He undertook research on the theme of heads, using as models his brother Diego and the young Rita Gueyfier, who took turns to sit over several months. He befriended artists Balthus, Francis Gruber and Pierre Tal-Coat. At the end of the year he met Isabel Nicholas, who became his friend and model.\n\n1939\n\nHe met the writers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nThe Second World War started on 1 September.\n\n1940–41\n\nFrance was invaded by the German Nazi forces.\n\nIn December, he went to Switzerland, where he stayed for the duration of the war. He made several portraits of his nephew Silvio and met the editor Albert Skira.\n\n1943\n\nHe met Annette Arm in Switzerland. She became his wife in 1949 and one of his favourite models.\n\n1944\n\nEli Lotar met up with Giacometti in Geneva, where he photographed for the magazine ”Labyrinthe” the room in the Hôtel de Rive where Giacometti was working on his series of tiny figures.\n\n1945\n\nThe war ended on 8 May with the capitulation of Germany.\n\nIn September, he returned to Paris, where Diego had managed to keep his studio in the same state in which he had left it. He returned to the Parisian literary milieu.\n\n1946\n\nHe made a series of portraits of personalities of the arts and literature: Marie-Laure de Noailles, Simone de Beauvoir and Georges Bataille. At Aragon’s request, he also sculpted the head of Rol-Tanguy, the communist leader of the French Resistance.\n\nHe published “The Dream, the Sphinx and the Death of T.” (“Le Rêve, le Sphinx et la mort de T.”) in the magazine ”Labyrinthe”.\n\n1947\n\nAnnette Arm moved into rue Hippolyte-Maindron.\n\n1948\n\nFirst solo exhibition of his works since 1934 at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York. Sartre wrote “The Search for the Absolute” (“La Recherche de l’absolu”) as the preface to the catalogue. The gallery set up solo exhibitions in 1950, 1958, 1961 and 1964.\n\n1949\n\n”Man Pointing” (Homme qui pointe, 1947) was bought by the Tate Gallery in London, the first of Giacometti’s works to be acquired by a European museum. He continued his series of portraits of intellectuals with Jean-Paul Sartre and Tristan Tzara.\n\nHe married Annette Arm on 19 July.\n\n1950\n\nHe presented new sculptures, among them his figure compositions on square bases, at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York.\n\n1951\n\nFirst exhibition at Galerie Maeght in Paris, where other exhibitions followed in 1954, 1957 and 1961. First lithographs. Responsibility for the exhibition and sale of his output was shared between two galleries.\n\n1952\n\nThe Musée de Grenoble bought ”The Cage” (1950), the first of his post-war works to enter a public collection in France. Donation of ”Table” (1933) to the Musée national d’art moderne by the Noailles, the first surrealist work in the French national collection.\n\n1954\n\nFirst solo exhibition in a museum, in Santa Barbara in California. Project for a medal to Henri Matisse. He made his first portraits of the writer Jean Genet, who was to sit for him until 1958.\n\n1955\n\nFirst retrospectives in museums: the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, Arts Council Gallery in London (organised by David Sylvester) and in Germany (Krefeld, Düsseldorf and Stuttgart).\n\n1956\n\nHe represented France at the Venice Biennale, where he exhibited a group of new sculptures: ”Women of Venice” (Femmes de Venise).\n\nHe drew the cover for Jean Genet’s ”The Balcony” (Le Balcon).\n\nHe met the philosopher Isaku Yanaihara, who sat for him over several summers (in 1957, 1959, 1960 and 1961).\n\n1957\n\nJean Genet wrote ”The Studio of Giacometti” (L’Atelier d’Alberto Giacometti), which first appeared in the magazine ”Derrière le miroir”, and was then published in 1963 as a book, illustrated with photographs by Ernst Scheidegger."
