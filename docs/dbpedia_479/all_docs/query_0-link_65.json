Impressionists focused on the depiction of outdoor light, although within a decade most of them (including Degas) had turned to painting indoors or in studios.\n\nFrance's greatest modern sculptor Auguste Rodin shows The Age of Bronze at the Salon. Later Rodin masterpieces include: The Gates of Hell (1880-1917), The Burghers of Calais (1884-86) and The Kiss (1888).\n\nThe Pointillist neo-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat creates Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, employing the optical colour-theory of Divisionism.\n\nThe prolific period of the Dutch Expressionist Vincent Van Gogh, which includes his masterpieces: Vase With Twelve Sunflowers (1888), Wheatfield with Crows (1890), Portrait of Dr. Gachet I and II (1890), Starry Night (1889) and others.\n\nEra of Post-Impressionism, led by Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Vincent Van Gogh. Highpoint of Arts and Crafts Movement.\n\nEmergence of Secession and Art Nouveau, two general art movements which sought to break away from the traditions of the official academies. They also sought to unite the fine arts of painting and sculpture and architecture with the applied arts of design and decoration (see Poster Art; and History of Poster Art 1860-1980). Their avant-garde exhibitions caused great controversy. In Vienna, where it was known as Jugenstil or Sezessionstil, the breakaway was led by Gustav Klimt. A later member was Egon Schiele, known for his disturbing portraits and Art Nouveau cityscapes.\n\nNational Gallery of British Art founded in London, popularly known as the Tate Gallery.\n\nDeath of Aubrey Beardsley, the brilliant 25-year old Art Nouveau illustrator.\n\nThe emergence of Expressionism. The expressionist art school/style begins with Van Gogh (d.1890), includes Edvard Munch (eg. The Scream, 1893), and the French Fauvism movement (1898-1908) led by Henri Matisse; also the Parisian/Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani. German Expressionism, a major offshoot, included: The Bridge (Die Brucke) (1905-13) founded by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, was an influential expressionist group based in Dresden. The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) (1909-14) expressionist group was formed in Munich, the home of the avant-garde Neue Kunstler Vereiningung (New Artist Association) by the Russian born Wassily Kandinsky. New Objectivity (Die Neue Sachlichkeit), was a 1920s German Expressionist group led by painters Otto Dix and Max Beckmann. Primitivism/Primitive art emerges in the West.\n\nPablo Picasso. Early career: characterized by his Blue Period (c.1901-4), Rose Period (c.1905-7), African Period (c. 1907). During the latter, he created Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, a landmark painting in the development of modern art which signalled a radical departure from the artistic ideas of the preceding ages and heralded the coming of a new artistic movement (Cubism) as well as the birth of modern abstract art.\n\nThe Ashcan School founded. It comprised a small number of painters who chronicled everyday life in New York City during the pre-war period, producing realistic and unvarnished pictures and etchings of urban streetscapes and genre scenes.\n\nArmory Show, NY, the most important exhibition of modern art ever held in America.\n\nPicasso combines with Georges Braque to invent the revolutionary art movement called Cubism, (overturning conventional ideas of perspective and form) which emerges in 3 stages: Prototype Cubism (c.1908-9), Analytical Cubism (c.1909-12), Synthetic Cubism (c.1912-19). Other leading Cubist painters include Juan Gris and Fernand Leger.\n\nThe chaos of World War I and the Russian Revolution (1917) shatter many conventional ideas in the world of painting and sculpture, leading to numerous avant-garde movements. These include: Futurism (1909-15), which promoted a worship of machinery and modernity; Orphism (Orphic Cubism or Simultanism) (1910-13), founded by French artist Robert Delaunay, which explored the colour phenomena seen in nature; Rayonism (1912-13), Russian style of painting dominated by pictorialized 'rays of light', invented by Mikhail Larionov, Vorticism (1913-15) the first UK style to embrace Cubist ideas; Dada (1916-24) which used banal imagery to shock; Suprematism (1913-20s) a Russian abstract art movement led by Natalie Goncharova and Kasimir Malevich; Constructivism (1917-21) a Russian avant-garde architectural art style; the Bauhaus Design School (1919-33) founded by Walter Gropius; De Stijl (1917-31), the highly influential Dutch 'school' of geometric abstract art and design led by Theo Van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian, also known as Neo-Plasticism. All these styles were labelled 'degenerate art' (entartete kunst) by the Nazis.\n\nIn America, the era of New Realism, as personnified by Edward Hopper (1882-1967). In addition, another style known as Social Realism portrays the everyday hardships of the Depression era. Best known Social Realists include Ben Shahn, Jack Levine and Jacob Lawrence: all strongly influenced by the earlier Ashcan School of New York City.\n\nIn Europe, the era of Surrealism: a movement emerging out of Cubism, Dada, Freud and Communist philosophy, which aimed to fuse the conscious with the unconscious to create a 'super-reality'. Led by Andre Breton, Rene Magritte and Salvador Dali. A parallel art movement to Surrealism was Magic Realism, whose paintings are anchored in everyday reality, but with overtones of fantasy. The name was coined by the German art historian and critic Franz Roh in 1925, in a book entitled Nach Expressionismus: Magischer Realismus.\n\nHigh point of Art Deco, a style of design for furniture, jewellery, textiles and interior decor. The term was coined from the title of the seminal design exhibition in Paris, Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes.\n\nThe period of Socialist Realism: a form of public propaganda art instituted by Joseph Stalin during the era of forced industrialization in Soviet Russia.\n\nChaos and war undermines the primacy of Paris as the world centre of art, a title which soon devolves upon New York. In London (1938), a left-wing modern realist group of artists establish The Euston Road School, advocating the portrayal of traditional subjects in a realist manner, to make art more understandable and socially relevant.\n\nPablo Picasso paints his monumental monochrome masterpiece Guernica.\n\nNew York supercedes Paris as the centre of innovation in art, Abstract Expressionism emerges as the dominant new style. Leading lights include the so-called action painters led by Jackson Pollock, his wife Lee Krasner and Willem De Kooning, and Colour-Field painters, such as Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still. In Europe, this type of Neo-Expressionism focused on the isolation of man (figurative style) as in the works of Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon, although hyper-modern movements like Spatialism (Italy) also appeared, prefacing later Performance and environmental/land artworks.\n\nThe era of Pop-Art, championed by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenburg. Pop-Artists employ contemporary iconic images in an anti-art approach, giving commonplace articles artistic status. Meanwhile, Op-Art becomes the avant-garde form of abstract art. Arte Povera blossoms in Italy 1967-71.\n\nThe advent of Photorealism (sometimes referred to as superrealism), a form of meticulous photo-like realism, championed by Richard Estes (street scenes with elaborate window reflections) and Chuck Close (b.1940) who specializes in huge, neck-up portraiture. John Doherty is Ireland's best known photorealist artist.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Age of Postmodernist Art\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom roughly this point onwards, Modern Art (c.1860-1979) or 'Modernism' becomes superceded by what art-historians like to call 'Post-Modernism'. In a nutshell, Modernism (ie. the main movements which emerged during the period 1860-mid 1960s) asserted the supremacy of a particular style or interpretation of reality, normally considerably at odds with the prevailing academic tradition. In contrast, contemporary art movements take the view that the 'substance' of Modernism has performed no better, and must be dumped in favour of greater style. Post-modernism thus represents the triumph of style over substance. Post-modernist art typically employs new media and materials, stresses the importance of 'communication' from artist to audience and seeks to renew the big question: 'what is art?' Much of this is reflected in contemporary art forms such as Conceptual Art, Installation, Video art, Performance, and Happenings, as well as the works of such showmen as Damien Hirst (see Young British Artists), Gilbert and George, the environmental 'artists' Christo and Joanne-Claude, and the nude installationist Spencer Tunick. While the ephemeral nature of this contemporary art is fully consistent with global trends of instant gratification, one wonders whether today's artists will be remembered 50, 100 or 500 years from now, and if not, whether this reflects adversely on the theory and practice of art in the 21st century. One major collector who believes strongly in postmodernist art is Charles Saatchi.\n\nGrowth of digital art, such as Giclee Prints.\n\nGarÃ§on Ã la Pipe (1905) by Pablo Picasso sells at Sotheby's New York for $104.2 million, making it the highest priced painting ever sold at auction.\n\nNo 5 (1948) by Jackson Pollock, sells privately for $140 million, making it the most expensive painting ever sold. For more, see: Top 10 Most Expensive Paintings.\n\nTriptych (1976) by Francis Bacon sells at Sotheby's New York for $86.3 million, becoming the most expensive post-war work of art sold at auction, and the highest priced work by an Irish artist. In the same year Damien Hirst sells works worth Â£111 million at Sotheby's in London, while the list of top 20 contemporary artists is dominated by the Chinese.\n\nWhile prices for contemporary art plummet, Warhol's 1963 silkscreen print Eight Elvises, reportedly sells for $100 million to anonymous buyer.\n\nNew world records for painting and sculpture are set at auction at Christie's and Sothebys.
