        "text": "Do-it-yourself videos\n\nWhen Alberto Giacometti was a child, he would copy pictures from books. Let’s look at photographs of Giacometti’s works and be creative at home. Look, feel, redesign and try again. Find a way where your hands and eyes can explore and create something together. We experiment with materials such as pens, clay, instant coffee and so on.\n\nWatch the videos to find out more about materials such as ballpoint pens, plaster and clay. We also try painting with instant coffee on watercolour paper.\n\nTall wax figure | Plaster sculpture | Copying | Life drawing with ballpoint pen | Portraits | Clay sculptures | Painting with coffee\n\nInspiration: Tall wax figure\n\nYou need\n\nwax (cheese wax from crafts shop, or use modelling clay instead)\n\nwire\n\na staple gun\n\na base (wood or cardboard)\n\na carving tool\n\npliers\n\nHow to do it\n\nStaple the wire to the base. Plan the shape of your sculpture. Giacometti’s figures were tall and thin with big feet.\n\nBend the wire into a wire figure. Can you capture movement in your figure? What would it look like if it took a giant step?\n\nCut thin slices of wax and warm them with your fingers.\n\nNow, start sticking the wax to the wire to create your sculpture. The wax will harden but goes soft quickly if you warm it with your hands.\n\nCover the wire with wax or clay until you’re happy with your sculpture!\n\nInspiration: Plaster sculpture\n\nYou need\n\naluminium foil\n\nplaster and water\n\na paperclip or string to hang it up with\n\na pencil\n\nsomething sharp, like a table knife, wire or scissors\n\nHow to do it\n\nShape two sheets of foil into an oval, fold up the edges to make a mould.\n\nPrepare the plaster (available from crafts shops, mix as instructed on the package).\n\nPour the plaster into the foil mould and allow to set. You can fasten a string or paperclip in the plaster as a hanger.\n\nWhen the plaster has set, remove it from the mould and start creating!\n\nDraw on the plaster with a pencil. Use something sharp to carve. It’s easy if the plaster is still damp. Use scissors, a knife, a paperclip, the tip of a pencil or something else to make the shape you want. Remember that the shape is what is left after you have carved and scraped away material.\n\nYou decide when your work is finished!\n\nInspiration: Copying\n\nYou need\n\na ballpoint pen\n\nnewspapers, magazines or advertising\n\nscissors\n\nglue\n\ntape\n\npaper\n\nHow to do it\n\nAllow your pen to move in circles across the paper and see what happens.\n\nYou can cut out pictures or part of a picture and glue it onto a coloured sheet of paper.\n\nFrom childhood, Alberto Giacometti copied images and artworks from books\n\nIt soon became an obsession and his large library of frayed art books is full of notes and drawings in the margins.\n\nEvery scrap of paper, envelope, or receipt he had at hand was made to double as drawing paper.\n\nGiacometti copied art for the same reason he tried to copy reality: to try to understand what he saw.\n\nRead more about it in the exhibition catalogue: Essay by the curators\n\nInspiration: Life drawing with ballpoint pen\n\nYou need\n\ndifferent-coloured ballpoint pens\n\na posable mannequin or live model (or you can sketch people moving on TV or outside your window)\n\npencils\n\npaper\n\nHow to do it\n\nFeel your pen or pencil move across the paper. To explore what a body looks like, use a mannequin to get a clearer picture of the anatomy and let your pen or pencil make circular movements.\n\nLook and draw at the same time, change colours and fill in your lines. Observe the shadows and the relation between arms, head and legs.\n\nTry filling a whole sheet of paper with your sketches!\n\nGIacometti and the ballpoint pen\n\nAfter the BIC pen was introduced on the French market in 1950 it rapidly became one of Giacometti’s favourite drawing tools. This type of ballpoint pen is looked down upon nowadays, but Giacometti appreciated the fact that it was cheap, easy to carry around and that its ink adhered to different kinds of surfaces. He constantly drew on anything available: newspapers, receipts and serviettes. The ink was red, green, black or blue, and Giacometti preferred the latter two.\n\nInspiration: Portraits\n\nYou need\n\na tablet\n\na stylus for a touchscreen (if you don’t have one, try using your finger)\n\nHow to do it\n\nTake a picture of yourself with the tablet.\n\nImport the picture to a drawing program.\n\nDraw lines on the picture of your face to find its geometric structure.\n\nErase the background.\n\nNow, draw again and again, don’t erase anything. Just continue with a different colour, making layer upon layer of lines, until you can’t see the original picture. Giacometti then went back to depicting the eyes and the gaze.\n\nGiacometti was convinced that life’s essential presence is found in the gaze\n\nBit by bit he gave up the whole to become lost in the details, to concentrate all his efforts on the head and, toward the end of his life, to capture gazes themselves.\n\nPerhaps there and then a wholeness could finally emerge.\n\nRead more about it in the exhibition catalogue: Essay by the curators\n\nInspiration: Clay sculptures\n\nYou need\n\nclay (white, air-dry clay)\n\nsculpting tools (a table knife or spoon will do)\n\nwater\n\na surface, preferably one that you can turn (a rotating cheese board from IKEA)\n\na cloth\n\nHow to do it\n\nKnead the clay with your hands into a solid lump. You can throw it on the table to get rid of bubbles.\n\nShape it into an upper body, using your thumbs to make a head and shoulders.\n\nWhen you have a shape that you’re happy with, start working on the face. Where are the eyes, nose and mouth? Try different looks. Use wire or some other sharp object to draw a face in the clay.\n\nDip your fingers in water if the clay feels dry. The clay dries in the air. If you want to continue working on the sculpture later, wrap it in a wet cloth and keep it in a plastic bag.\n\nHot tip!\n\nClay and tools are sold in the Moderna Museet Shop.\n\nSculpture, for me, is not a beautiful object but a way to try to understand a little bit better what I see, to try to understand a little bit better what attracts me and enthrals […]. If it’s a little bit successful, a sculpture will simply be a way to say to others, to communicate to others what I see.” – Alberto Giacometti\n\nInspiration: Painting with coffee\n\nYou need\n\nwatercolour paper 300 g\n\na paint brush\n\nwater (cold)\n\ninstant coffee\n\nmasking tape\n\nkitchen roll\n\nHow to do it\n\nMake a rectangle with masking tape on a sheet of paper.\n\nWet the paper inside the masking tape.\n\nMix water and instant coffee.Try adding more or less water to the coffee to get different nuances!\n\nMake little squares at the top of the paper to test what shades you can achieve.\n\nUse kitchen roll to absorb excess water, experiment and dab.\n\nLeave the picture to dry, then remove the masking tape.\n\nFold the edges and tear them off to get a nice finish.\n\nMore about this exhibition"
