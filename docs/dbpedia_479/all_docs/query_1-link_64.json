        "text": "For example, she has a decided affinity for Greek mythological stories. Elements from these stories can be found fragmented and buried in many of her canvases. But nothing is ever obvious in her work. The viewer must search the canvas for clues to her visual language. Kjaer’s flair for the subtle and partial disclosure, for a stolen glimpse of some interior dream world, is what turns her paintings into such terrific dramas. There are no shortcuts or overt formulas here. Her best work is organic, improvisatory, and honest.\n\nOf course, many artists over the centuries have explored mythological themes, but Kjaer approaches these themes in a slightly different way. Most of the previous artists to explore mythological themes are men. Kjaer asserts in her bold paintings that their renditions of these stories stem from a distinctly male perspective. Kjaer hopes to brings a woman’s sensibility, and a sophisticated feminist perspective, to her work as an artist.\n\nShe believes that art history is clogged with way too many themes subtly, or overtly reflecting male domination, the age-old stories of men attempting to control women’s sexual interests and reproductive rights. Kjaer asserts that these tales are ripe for reinterpretation by female artist today. Kjaer perceives the ambiguity inherent in these stories, and sets out to explore the mysteries embedded in the themes she chooses in many of her paintings.\n\nThe artist Alberto Giacometti may represent one of the most compelling examples of Existentialist philosophy in art. Existentialism explores questions related to the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence. And existentialists are deeply concerned with the concept of authenticity as a way of approaching the moral and ethical questions humans face in the course of their lives. These concerns were central to both the paintings and sculptures of Giacometti. In his intensely agitated paintings he usually articulates a lone figure, isolated and caught in a moment of intense angst, staring into the void of the universe. As we contemplate this troubled figure we are forced to face our own confrontation with isolation, our own search for meaning, and our own moral contradictions with the issues surrounding authenticity. Similarly, Giacometti's sculptures, usually roughly hewn figures - thin, emaciated, and standing rigidly upright - present a study in the fragility of humans, not only the fragility of their bodies, but the fragility of the ego and psychological condition.\n\nRuth Kjaer's deeply complex paintings are directly influenced by Giacometti's pivotal work and show many similarities. Many of her paintings also feature a lone figure looking out at us and confronting the viewer with questions about isolation and the nature of the human condition. But Kjaer's work interrogates the questions raised by Existentialist thought in new ways that go beyond the work of Giacometti. Kjaer often uses literary references, usually derived from Greek mythology, to enhance and deepen her investigation of existential ideas. She also creates a rich atmosphere that surrounds and places her troubled figures in a dream-world, or a world deeply embedded in the human subconscious. But most of all, Kjaer's unique vision, so skillfully rendered on the canvas, has forged a way of presenting a world that's always elusive, a world we vaguely know exists but can't quite grasp. Kjaer's art embodies Frederick Nietzsche's statement that, \"It is a rare gift to venture into the unexplored depths of the self, without delusions or fictions, but with an uncorrupted gaze.\" Kjaer's vision is a perfect example of that rare gift and that uncorrupted gaze.\n\nKjaer’s strong assertion of contemporary issues, in paintings filled with mystery and drama, make her work both beautiful to behold and challenging to contemplate. In an age characterized by globalization, rapid technological change, and a chaotic political environment, artists face bewildering challenges. Kjaer offers one profound approach for the future direction of art in the twenty-first century.\n\nGuy McLain\n\nFormer Director of the Wood Museum of Springfield History in Springfield, Massachusetts\n\n“The universe explored in my paintings is a window into the realm of human emotions and the mysteries underlying our world.\n\nI utilize a process which employs the vocabulary of Abstract Expressionism. This allows me to create an atmosphere and a layering which exposes ambiguous elements suggesting and referencing Greek architecture and mythology, especially Danae and the golden rain, Perseus and Andromeda, as well as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nThese stories are filled with possibilities for reinterpretation from a feminist philosophical perspective in the modern era. I am focused on the particular challenges faced by women today, and believe strongly that the female characters in these stories provide a field for exploring these issues. I find them significantly relevant to our own time. Patriarchal control, as well as physical and psychological abuse, are still experienced by women today.\n\nMuch of my work refers to the idea of America acting as a beacon of hope - “a shining city on a hill”. This title, from the Sermon on the Mount, has been used by modern politicians to assert American Exceptionalism. Is America the model? I present the “Myth of Utopia”. Especially in these uncertain times, the voyage, with its challenges, remains.\n\nMy work is never literal. Each painting is hopefully an adventure into an unknown realm, a dreamscape that evokes a mysterious atmosphere, which can be interpreted by the viewer and illuminated by ones’ own experience and perspective.\n\n- Ruth Kjaer"
