Alberto Giacometti was a Swiss sculptor and painter. He was born in 1901 in Switzerland and spent much of his career working in Paris. Giacometti was initially influenced by cubism but later joined the surrealist movement. He is known for his thin, elongated figures and small bust portraits from the post-WWII period that aimed to capture the essence of the subject. Giacometti frequently depicted his brother Diego and other friends and sat for many portraits throughout his career, focusing on representing the human head and form.",
