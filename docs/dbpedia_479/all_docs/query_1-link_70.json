        "text": "American Cubism\n\nWilliam C. Agee, emeritus professor of art history at Hunter College and a former director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Pasadena Art Museum, will discuss \"Post-1940 American Cubism\" in person at Hoie Hall, behind St. Luke's Episcopal Church, East Hampton, on Sunday at 5 p.m.\n\nWhile Cubism existed in America as early as 1910, after 1940 it evolved into new modes, was at the core of much of Abstract Expressionism, and remained a force through the 1960s.\n\nThe free talk, which will also be available online via Zoom, is part of the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center's Lichtenstein Lecture Series. The Zoom link can be found on the center's website.\n\nLongHouse Hits the Street\n\nUncuttArt, known for his thought-provoking street art, which can be seen in cities across the country, also creates paintings, using acrylic on canvas, with themes ranging from pop culture to ancient tribal-inspired art. He has collaborated in various mediums with Jamie Foxx, Wyclef Jean, and Def Jam Records, among others.\n\nHe will be at LongHouse Reserve in East Hampton on Saturday, as part of its Insider Outsider: New Voices in the Art World series, at 11 a.m. MAGO, an artist and curator, will host the discussion. Tickets are $20, free for members.\n\nWhimsical Figures\n\n\"Umbrella,\" a show of eight new sculptures by Bret Reilly, is at Colm Rowan Fine Art in East Hampton through Sept. 11.\n\nThe figures in the exhibition are elongated, life-size women made of papier-mâché, all white except for the adornment of real shoes, the artist's signature element. Posed holding umbrellas, hanging from swings, or otherwise in whimsical motion, they reflect the influence of Degas, Rodin, and Giacometti, whose work Mr. Reilly saw as a child.\n\nNicaraguan Traditions\n\n\"Rios de Aqua Viva,\" a solo show of work by Joel Gaitan, is at Fairfax Dorn Projects in East Hampton through Sept. 18. Of Nicaraguan descent, his work is informed by his religious upbringing and the family customs of Central America.\n\nThe nine red-toned terracotta sculptures in the exhibition, handmade using traditional clay techniques, represent portals to the afterlife, says the gallery. Each vessel has a unique \"personality.\" \"Nicoya,\" for example, which is the nickname for someone from Nicaragua, is an exaggerated self-portrait that features its title on a necklace.\n\nInspired by Hip-Hop\n\nA passion for music and performance is central to the recent work of Edreys Wajed. \"The Bridge,\" an exhibition of his paintings and sculptures, will open Friday at the Mark Borghi Gallery in Sag Harbor, with a reception set for Saturday from 5:30 to 8 p.m.\n\nUnique mark-making and rhythmic movement reflect music's influence on the artist. The works produced for the exhibition explore language unique to hip-hop culture and various styles of nonverbal communication used by those working within it.\n\nThe exhibition will run through Sept. 8.\n\nSurf Culture\n\nARC Fine Art in East Hampton will hold a reception for Tony Caramanico, an East Coast Surfing Hall of Fame member, on Saturday from 5 to 7 p.m. in conjunction with the exhibition \"New Surf Journal Collages, Prints, and Surfboards,\" which will run through Monday.\n\nMr. Caramanico has documented his career of global travel and surf competitions for almost 40 years. The exhibition includes collages of newspaper clippings, travel ephemera, and personal notations that evoke his life in surf culture.\n\nTerry Elkins Solo\n\n\"Terry Elkins: Paintings Past and Present\" will open on Saturday at MM Fine Art in Southampton with a reception from 6 to 8 p.m. It will remain on view through Sept. 11.\n\nMr. Elkins's oil paintings, pastels, drawings, and watercolors range from landscapes and seascapes to maritime and nautical images and historical architectural landmarks.\n\nOnce he moved to the East End, in the 1980s, he began to paint outdoors, and still does, although he often finishes paintings in his Sagaponack studio. Of one of his subjects, Wainscott Pond, he told The Star, \"Painting's just an excuse to be there.\"\n\nPaintings at Lisson\n\nA selection of paintings by Shirazeh Houshiary spanning a 20-year period is at the Lisson Gallery in East Hampton through Sunday. An Iranian artist who lives and works in London, Ms. Houshiary rose to prominence as a sculptor but now works in painting, installation, architectural projects, and film.\n\nHer painting process begins by placing the canvases flat on the floor, then moving around them and producing layers of Arabic inscriptions on top of the sediments formed from pouring water mixed with pure pigment.\n\nDarkroom Alchemy\n\nA show of photographs by Amanda Means, whose work explores the darkroom's materials and processes, will open Friday at the Jetsam Studio in Southampton with a reception from 5 to 7 p.m. It will continue through Sept. 30.\n\nPresented with JHB Gallery from Manhattan, the exhibition includes new works from the artist's \"Light Bulb\" series in archival pigment prints, and selections from her ongoing series of abstractions. The latter are made by scoring gelatin silver photographic paper on alternate sides, folding it into a fan shape, exposing it to light, and placing it in liquid developer.\n\nFour in Sagaponack\n\nThe first of an ongoing series of exhibitions at Gallery @ Hans Van de Bovenkamp Studio in Sagaponack will open Friday from 5 to 7 p.m. with work by four East End artists.\n\nStephanie Brody-Lederman's mixed-media works combine visual imagery with words, while Paton Miller's paintings derive from his early influences, life experiences, and travels. Folk traditions and antiques inspired the work of Charles Waller, who died last year of Covid-19. Sculpture, paintings, and works on paper by Mr. Van de Bovenkamp will also be on view.\n\nThe show will be open through Sept. 6 by appointment, via email to [email protected].\n\nTalking Chamberlain\n\nIn connection with the exhibition \"Once on This Island\" at the Shelter Island Historical Society, Prudence and Alexandra Fairweather, the directors of the John Chamberlain Estate, will discuss the artist's work with Margaret Garrett, curator of the exhibition, on Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nOn view through Sept. 7, the exhibition includes work by Karen Arm, Janet Culbertson, Willem de Kooning, Jules Feiffer, Alan Shields, Ned Smyth, Ms. Garrett, and Chamberlain.\n\nArt in the Shed\n\nEast Hampton Shed and Leila Greiche, a gallerist from New York City, will launch Brigid Moore's artist book on Saturday, with a one-night-only reception and exhibition from 5 to 8 at 30 Blue Jay Way.\n\nMs. Moore's paintings evoke stills from a moment of reverie, capturing her subjects, according to the gallery, in their own fantastical landscapes, yet lost in daydreams. The paintings on view were inspired by the works on paper she made for the book, which was bound by Hadley Hill Bindery.\n\nBen Fenske in Sag\n\nA solo show of paintings by Ben Fenske is on view at the Grenning Gallery in Sag Harbor through Sept. 11. While the exhibition includes a series of works inspired by the artist's life in Italy's Chianti region, there are also a few landscapes created during his visit to Sag Harbor in 2021.\n\nThe show features still lifes painted inside as well as outside his house, nudes and figures, and landscapes, often visible through open windows.\n\nMizrahi's \"Thick Brush\"\n\n\"Thick Brush,\" a show of approximately 30 paintings by Haim Mizrahi, will be at Ashawagh Hall in Springs from Friday through Sunday, with an opening reception set for Saturday from 5 to 8 p.m. On Sunday afternoon from 2 to 4, a memorial for the poet Simon Perchik will feature a poetry reading and music.\n\nGallery hours are Friday from 1 to 5, Saturday from 10 to 8, and Sunday from 11 to 7.\n\nLots of Tomatoes\n\n\"Tomato Pop-Up,\" new work by Kevin Berlin, will open on Saturday at the Oscar Molina Gallery in Southampton with a reception from 5 to 7 p.m. It will remain on view through Sept. 5.\n\nThe show includes gouaches of heirloom tomatoes, San Marzano tomatoes, and a mini-pizza (with tomato sauce), as well as watermelon, a Nutella jar, and other comestibles.\n\nQuilt Show and Sale\n\nThe Water Mill Museum's 36th annual quilt show, featuring hundreds of quilts on display and for sale, can be seen now through Sept. 4. The museum is open daily from 11 to 4, Sundays from 1 to 4, and closed Wednesdays. Tickets are $5 and include a raffle ticket chance to win a quilt."
