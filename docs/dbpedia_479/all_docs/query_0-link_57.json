        "text": "Franz Kline\n\nPennsylvania, 1954\n\nOil, oil-based house paint and charcoal on canvas | 45\" x 62 3/4\"\n\nFranz Kline’s large-scale canvases, which feature muscular, calligraphic bolts of black paint over white fields, have become icons of mid-20th-century Abstract Expressionism. Kline helped pioneer the movement alongside artists including Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Joan Mitchell. Before Kline solidified his trademark style, he made smaller-scale studies; after seeing one of them projected onto a wall at de Kooning’s studio, he realized his compositions were suited to grander proportions. Kline studied painting and drawing at Boston University before pursuing drafting and illustration at the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London. These specialties helped inform his early work as a commercial illustrator.\n\nAlberto Giacometti\n\nTête noire (peinte en recouvrement d’un portrait de Yanaihara de 1957), 1957 - 1962\n\nOil on canvas | Framed: 44.48\" x 30.7\" x 2.75\"\n\nAlberto Giacometti devoted much of his career to the struggle between matter and meaning, engaging in an extended exploration of how to reduce the figure’s mass as far as possible while imbuing it with essential force. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that Giacometti’s depictions of humanity are “always mediating between nothingness and being,” his sculptures evoking the emotional intensity of the void. Often considered testimony to the ravages of postwar Europe, Giacometti’s sculptures, paintings, and drawings possess a timeless quality, inflected with art historical and philosophical narratives, from Surrealism and Expressionism to existentialism and phenomenology.\n\nHelen Frankenthaler\n\nUntitled, 1964\n\nAcrylic on Canvas | 17 1/8\" x 27 1/8\"\n\nHelen Frankenthaler, whose career spanned six decades, has long been recognized as one of the great American artists of the twentieth century. She was eminent among the second generation of postwar American abstract painters and is widely credited for playing a pivotal role in the transition from Abstract Expressionism to Color Field painting. Through her invention of the soak-stain technique, she expanded the possibilities of abstract painting, while at times referencing figuration and landscape in unique ways. She produced a body of work whose impact on contemporary art has been profound and continues to grow.\n\nPaolo Scheggi\n\nZone riflesse, 1965\n\nLight blue acrylic on three super imposed canvases | 23.62 x 19.88 x 2.16\"\n\nPaolo Scheggi was an Italian artist and member of the avant-garde ZERO group. Known for his inventive monochromatic canvases, Scheggi’s abstractions create shallow space and light by superimposing surfaces and overlapping elliptical holes in a series called Intersuperfici and Strutture Modulari. Born in 1940 in Florence, Scheggi went on to study in London and later moved to Milan. The formal and conceptual aspects of his work allied him with the ZERO movement with artists like Lucio Fontana, whose work puncturing the picture plane and interest in exploring paintings as objects was similar to Scheggi’s. Despite a short life, his work was widely exhibited, notably including the, 33rd Venice Biennale in 1966.\n\nAlma W. Thomas\n\nSparkling Dew On Spring Flowers, 1968\n\nAcrylic on canvas | 24\" x 36\"\n\nAlma W. Thomas derived her vibrant color palette and lyrical brushwork from the shapes and movement of foliage, flowers, and other natural forms. She attended Howard University, becoming its first fine arts graduate in 1924, before becoming a 35 year career teaching art at a D.C. junior high school. She debuted her abstract work in an exhibition at Howard 1966, at the age of 75. Thomas’ abstractions have been compared with Byzantine mosaics, the Pointillist technique of Georges Seurat, and the paintings of the Washington Color School, yet her work defies simple categorization..\n\nKenneth Young\n\nUntitled, 1970\n\nAcrylic on Canvas | 47\" x 54\"\n\nRepetitive shapes fill the fluid canvases of Kenneth Victor Young, who frequently painted cosmic clusters of orbs or overlapping veils of saturated color. Initially part of an artistic circle at the University of Louisville that included Sam Gilliam and Bob Thompson, Young became associated with Washington Color School painters such as Alma Thomas, Gene Davis, and Howard Mehring after he moved to Washington D.C. in 1964. Young painted with diluted acrylics on unprimed canvas, using a combination of sponges and water that he sprayed onto the painting’s surface. In his canvases, which he usually painted on the floor, he created what he referred to as order from chaos, allowing components to collide in a manner that was both controlled and improvisational. In addition to his painting career, Young was a longtime exhibition designer at the Smithsonian Institution and an art instructor at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and Duke Ellington School of the Arts.\n\nHans Hartung\n\nT1975-H8,1975\n\nAcrylic on canvas | 43 11/16\" × 70 7/8\"\n\nHans Hartung achieved international recognition as a seminal figure of art informel, which arose in France during World War II.\n\nThe originality of this series of works is twofold. Using a tool made in the studio, a squeegee with small pointed teeth, the material is stretched and strewn with grooves. According to one of Hartung's assistants, who said that he had the \"palpable pleasure of the challenge,” the acrylic was mixed with latex to allow for greater elasticity and thus increased relief. These canvases are therefore characterized by a certain tactility. On solid colored backgrounds, the artist marks dark lines that he then scrapes off, creating a vibrant depth of parallel streaks. The colors mix, the values contrast and intermediate pictorial spaces seem to appear between the form and the background, like an optical illusion.\n\nRobert Rauschenberg\n\nThai IV and Thai X, 1983\n\nSolvent transfer, watercolor, gouache and tape on Japanese dedication board | 18 3/8\" x 18 1/8\" x 1 1/4\"\n\nRobert Rauschenberg’s art has always been one of thoughtful inclusion. Working in a wide range of subjects, styles, materials, and techniques, Rauschenberg has been called a forerunner of essentially every postwar movement since Abstract Expressionism.\n\nThai IV and Thai X are from a suite of drawings with solvent transfer imagery and watercolor. In contrast to the contemporaneous Sri Lanka and Kyoto drawings (both 1983), which were made during his travels, the Thai drawings were completed in Captiva upon his return from the trip that encompassed all three destinations. This series combines elements from all three: on gold-edged Japanese dedication boards, Rauschenberg transferred images from Thai publications as well as his own color photographs of Sri Lanka, among the earliest instances of his use of color photography in this manner. Some of the transfers appear to have been made using a printing press.\n\nAlighiero Boetti\n\nMappa, 1983-84\n\nEmbroidery | 44 7/8\" x 66 1/8\"\n\nAlighiero Boetti known as Alighiero e Boetti was an Italian conceptual artist born in Turin, Italy associated with the art movement Arte Povera. Traveling to Afghanistan at the beginning of the 1970s, he was introduced to the traditional craft of embroidery, which marked a turning point in the artist’s career. He is most famous for a series of embroidered maps of the world, Mappa, created between 1971 and his death in 1994. Boetti’s work was typified by his notion of ‘twinning’, leading him to add ‘e’ (and) between his names, ‘stimulating a dialectic exchange between these two selves’. His work has been the subject of numerous international exhibitions, including retrospectives at the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid, the Tate Gallery in London and the MoMA in New York.\n\nIsamu Noguchi\n\nCircles, 1987 (2022)\n\nMuntz metal Edition 2 of 8 and 2 APs | 27\" × 19\" × 10 3/4\"\n\nOne of the 20th century’s most important artists and designers, Isamu Noguchi became famous for his inventive, interlocking sculptures made from rounded slabs of wood, slate, and other materials that held together sans glue or screws. Throughout his career, the Japanese American artist expanded his multidisciplinary practice to include iconic design objects such as akari lamps made from washi paper, bamboo, and wire, and the iconic glass-topped table that he produced for Herman Miller. They exemplify Noguchi’s interest in material and spatial explorations: Integrating Japanese aesthetics and Western modernism, Noguchi’s work also transcended the boundaries between art, design, theater, and architecture.\n\nCady Noland\n\nUntitled (Walker), 1989\n\nWalker, basket, American flag, pole with wheel | 48 5/8\" × 30 1/4\" × 28 3/4\"\n\nCady Noland is the daughter of Kenneth Noland and her work addresses American mythologies, considering the construction of history and identity coming out of consumer culture and mass media. The US American flag, charcoal grills, bridles, cowboy saddles and weapons are all symbols of American identity. Yet the myth of the American dream has become a globalized reality characterized by the glorification of violence, radical individualism, consumption as both stimulus and fulfilment, and conflict in the form of separatism and exclusion. In her work, barriers, gates and fences are physical and symbolic manifestations that generate publicity and rule out participation. For those unable to comply with the pressure to perform, prostheses such as walkers, picker arms or canes for the blind are the only means of participating in public life.\n\nLee Ufan\n\nWith Winds, 1990\n\nOil on canvas | Framed: 53.54\" x 40.16\" x 2.36\"\n\nA founding member of the Japanese Mono-ha movement, Lee Ufan arranges his installations and sculptures to emphasize the equal relationship between his artwork, the viewer, and the exhibition space. He often juxtaposes natural and industrial materials in site-specific installations; throughout various pieces, steel reeds appear to sprout from a patch of sand, heavy stones perch on cushions, and boulders bookend a towering metal arc. Subdued hues are another signature element of Lee’s work. Throughout his paintings, for example, the artist applies muted colors against light, plain backgrounds. His brushstrokes fade as they end, evoking East Asian calligraphy.\n\nEd Ruscha\n\nStupid Idiot, 1997\n\nAcrylic on Canvas | 24\" x 36\"\n\nRuscha is one of the most influential artists to emerge out of the 1960s. From his early documentary-style photographs and commercially inspired paintings and drawings, to the more recent paintings of words superimposed over images of mountains, Ruscha's work has continually addressed the symbolic power of words and imagery. Although deceptively simple at first, the works challenge the viewer to rethink assumptions about the relationship between words and images, and the suggestiveness of both.\n\nIn the 1997 painting Stupid Idiot, a blank television screen casts a white glow over a dark, empty room. The desolateness of the image is compounded by the ambiguity of the title: Who is the stupid idiot? Where is the stupid idiot? Why is the painting called stupid Idiot? There are also no words or text in the image, which signifies a break from his usual practice.\n\nEl Anatsui\n\nUntitled, 2020\n\nAluminum and copper wire | 118\" x 109 1/2\"\n\nEl Anatsui is a Ghanaian sculptor who has spent much of his achievement-packed career living and working in Nigeria. El Anatsui currently runs a very robust studio practice, situated in Nsukka, Enugu, Nigeria, and Tema, Ghana. He is one of the most highly acclaimed artists in African History and foremost contemporary artists in the world. El Anatsui uses resources typically discarded such as liquor bottle caps, cassava graters and newspaper printing plates to create sculpture that defies categorisation.\n\nHis use of these materials reflects his interest in reuse, transformation, and an intrinsic desire to connect to his continent while transcending the limitations of place. His work can interrogate the history of colonialism and draw connections between consumption, waste, and the environment, but at the core is his unique formal language that distinguishes his practice.\n\nJoseph Kosuth\n\nExistential Time #17’, 2020\n\nWarm white neon, clock with added neon and sped-up, mounted directly on the wall neon: 7\" x 114 7/16\" clock: ø11 13/16\" x 2 11/16\"\n\nIn this series, Existential Time, Kosuth investigates time and existence through a variety of literary references. Kosuth’s reflection on time stems from both a personal and philosophical concern with finding meaning within the various contexts and narratives life provides; thus, it is also an investigation into the process of making meaning in his own artistic practice. The series was conceived in 2020, just prior to the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The series now seems particularly poignant in the historical context of this worldwide event, which drastically shifted humanity’s perception and experience of time.\n\nExistential Time #17 references a quote by Roland Barthes, the French 20th-century philosopher’s so-called autobiography, Barthes par Barthes, first published in 1977. In it, Barthes interrogates himself as a text, deeming the traditional notion of the author—a lone genius creating a work of literature—obsolete. According to Barthes, “authors” are incapable of original imagination and only have power to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer’s biography, Barthes states that the author has no past, but is born with the text: the death of the author is the birth of the reader\n\nEric Fischl\n\nBroken Hallelujah, 2023\n\nAcrylic on canvas | 68\" x 96\"\n\nEric Fischl works in multiple media such as painting, sculpture and prints, and is mostly known for his large scale, naturalistic images of middle-class American life. His suburban upbringing provided him with a backdrop of alcoholism and a culture obsessed with image over content. Subsequently, his early work became focused on provocative yet truthful issues deemed repugnant by polite society. The powerful underlying sexuality in his works, often portray intimate moments that the viewer is helplessly made privy of and address the dark and disturbing undercurrents of mainstream American life. Fischl’s large human-scale figures only emphasize the voyeuristic feeling of his images, and imbue them with a psychological, almost dream-like intensity. Broken Hallelujah is one of Fischl's most recent paintings and shows a self-portrait of him in the studio.\n\nRichard Long\n\nUntitled, 2023\n\nChina clay on aluminium with black gesso | 72 7/8\" x 59 1/8\" x 1 1/8\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Richard Long began making mud works using handprints applied directly to the wall. He also continued to make large sculptures of lines and circles from slate, driftwood, footprints or stone, often sourced from quarries near the exhibition sites. Long mediates on his experience of these places, from mountains through to deserts, shorelines, grasslands, rivers and snowscapes, according to archetypal geometric marks and shapes, made by his footsteps alone or gathered from the materials of the place.\n\nUntitled (2023), the newest in this important series, is the resulting image of both Long’s fast-moving hand and by the natural forces of gravity acting by chance with the watery clay.\n\nJosé Parlá\n\nWritten in Sunlight, 2023\n\nAcrylic, oil paint and plaster on canvas | 50\" x 40\"\n\nParlá’s large-scale compositions resemble city walls that, like palimpsests or psychogeographic maps, have accrued years of ephemera, posters, and fliers; he blends curvy gestures, calligraphy, and personal inscriptions with blurred color fields, using brushes, markers, spray paint, and sometimes fragments of fliers and posters. Parlá has produced several public commissions, including a giant mural at the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn. “With making abstract painting,” he has said, “I felt that what I was doing and what I’m still doing is translating the many different cultures and many different languages that I’m confronting.”\n\nMinjung Kim\n\nNautilus, 2023\n\nMixed media on mulberry Hanji paper | 76.2\" x 51.4\" x 2.8\"\n\nOver the course of three decades, Minjung Kim has created works using her disciplined and reductive yet inquisitive approach to East Asian traditions of calligraphy and ink painting. Kim works exclusively with traditional Korean hanji paper, and in her repetitive process of burning and layering the paper, she invokes a ritual of emotional healing and meditation while committing to the naturally singed lines created by the flames. She utilizes fire to represent time and space by experimenting with the flame to accelerate the delicate material’s otherwise centuries-long process of disintegration.\n\nThis “collaboration” between paper and fire—the destructive act of burning and obliterating the most delicate of human inventions, paper, with a candle or incense—leads the artist to reflect on the cycle of nature and seek a mindset of emptiness. Kim’s dedication to process and her ruminations on creation and destruction manifest themselves in abstraction together with the formal language of each series."
