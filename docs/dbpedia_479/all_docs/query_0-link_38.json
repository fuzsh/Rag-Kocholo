        "text": "Research point p34\n\nFrom the notes:\n\nLook at Alberto Giacometti’s figure paintings and drawings and consider how he limited himself to a very restricted range of colours. Consider also the freedom with which he treated the figures and how they sit within the space around them. You can imagine Giacometti drawing and redrawing until he felt he’d captured the image. Notice also how the exaggerations of scale help to give the works a great sense of space.\n\nThe exaggeration of space also links to the point Antony Gormley made in the BBC Imagine program I watched where he showed a small sculpture of a figure in a large room, therefore making the figure appear really small. However, he then put an even smaller figure next to this figure and that changed the whole scale completely. The small figure was no longer small in our perception, because of what we expect the size of a human being to be. I suppose it is like photography, when it is often suggested to include a figure in order to give an idea of the size of objects in the photo. Most people have an idea of the size of an average human being – it is something we can all relate to.\n\nAlberto Giacometti\n\nI ’ve started by looking at two head and shoulder portraits. One of a male and the other of a female.\n\nPortrait 1\n\nFigure 41\n\nSee link:\n\nhttp://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/giacometti-diego-t00358\n\nArtist: Alberto Giacometti 1901–1966\n\nTitle: Diego\n\nDate: 1959\n\nMedium: Oil paint on canvas\n\nDimensions Support: 610 x 498 mm\n\nframe: 664 x 553 x 74 mm\n\nCollection: Tate\n\nPortrait 2\n\nFigure 42\n\nSee link:\n\nhttps://www.bridgemaneducation.com/en/asset/477055/summary?context=%7B%22route%22%3A%22assets_search%22%2C%22routeParameters%22%3A%7B%22_format%22%3A%22html%22%2C%22_locale%22%3A%22en%22%2C%22filter_text%22%3A%22alberto+Giacometti+figure%22%7D%7D\n\nTitle: Black Annette, 1962 (oil on canvas)\n\nCreator: Giacometti, Alberto (1901-66)\n\nNationality: Swiss\n\nDescription: Annette Giacometti (d.1993), wife of the artist.\n\nLocation: Collection Fondation Alberto & Annette Giacometti\n\nMedium: oil on canvas\n\nDimensions: 55×45.8 cms\n\nObservations/thoughts:\n\nHe uses a muted background – off white colour. It might actually be partly the natural colour of the canvas, although he has painted on top.\n\nHe appears to focus on the lines and contours of the face, redoing lines until he’s happy. I imagine that this is done from close observation of the model.\n\nHe has used a very limited palette. It looks like he’s used muted colours first, then strong black contour lines on top, with white contour lines on top of that.\n\nWhen you look closely at the faces, you can see how all the many, many lines have been observed, reworked and build up to create the depth and detail of the head.\n\nThe overall effectcreate portraits which are well observed, but intense and energetic. They are also quite somber because of his choice of palette: greys, black, white and a little yellow ochre.\n\nSee portrait example below:\n\nThe next portrait example is slightly different in that there’s a little burnt sienna – or similar – as well as the colours used in the previous two examples.\n\nThis figure is also set slightly off centre whereas the others were quite central.\n\nThe same mark making techniques, reworking contour lines and marks is similar.\n\nIn all three portraits, but particularly in this one, they are positioned quite small. It gives a sense that the model is in a large space. Also because the backgrounds are quite bland it seems to give the figures more significance.\n\nFigure 43\n\nSee link:\n\nhttp://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/giacometti-jean-genet-t04905\n\nArtist: Alberto Giacometti 1901–1966\n\nTitle: Jean Genet\n\nDate: 1954 or 1955\n\nMedium: Oil paint on canvas\n\nDimensions Support: 653 x 543 mm\n\nframe: 790 x 686 x 55 mm\n\nCollection: Tate\n\nAn example of a figure painting by Alberto Giacometti\n\nFigure 44\n\nSee link:\n\nhttp://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/giacometti-seated-man-n05909\n\nArtist: Alberto Giacometti 1901–1966\n\nTitle: Seated Man\n\nDate1949\n\nMediumOil paint on canvas\n\nDimensionsSupport: 800 x 540 mm\n\nframe: 859 x 597 x 75 mm\n\nCollection: Tate\n\nThoughts:\n\nHe’s used the same limited palette as the previous portraits I’ve looked at. This work was actually done before the other three portraits I’ve looked at. He’s reworked the lines in different colours, but maybe not quite as much as in the other examples. In the other examples he’s really focused on the face where here he’s given more consideration to the whole figure. There’s also more indication of the background here, where as they are more bland in the others.\n\nI saw a similar piece by Alberto Giacometti when I was in Madrid at the Reina sofia Art Gallery.\n\nThe notes I made at the time:\n\nFigure 45\n\nTitle: Head of a Man lV (Diego) 1964:\n\nGreys, black lines and white lines on face, with the face being in a lot more detail.\n\nHe’s used energetic black lines.\n\nThe whole painting is very dark.\n\nHow I will tackle my own painting in Giacometti’s style:\n\nPaint a muted grey/yellow ochre background. Use expressive brush strokes – it doesn’t need to be neat or even.\n\nPosition the figure towards the bottom right of the paper/canvas in order to give a sense of space.\n\nStart with a grey colour and roughly paint in the body shape. Use a large brush.\n\nAdd small patches of yellow ochre and/or raw sienna.\n\nUsing a thinner brush, use black lines and paint in contour lines for the face and the body. Observe closely and keep reworking the lines on top of each other.\n\nFinally use a white paint and paint white contour lines on top.\n\nEvaluate my result against Giacometti’s portraits.\n\nPainting 1 in the style of Giacometti.\n\nModel – Andy while reading the paper. Giacometti used oil on canvas but I decided to use watercolour and white acrylic on watercolour paper.\n\nStages:\n\nFirst I did a wet in wet wash of watercolour using burnt sienna, yellow ochre and Prussian blue.\n\nOnce dry, I used a mix of burnt sienna and Prussian blue to paint an outline of the body. I positioned Andy lower down on the right hand side of the paper to give the same feeling of space as created by Giacometti . I did this another two times. My reason for doing this was to try and give the figure some form and depth, and also movement. In the final image though it looks like a shadow of the figure on the wall. I like the effect but it could be something that is developed further.\n\nOnce dry, I then used black watercolour (I don’t usually use black with watercolour) to draw a line drawing of Andy. I tried to observe carefully.\n\nOnce this had dried then I used white acrylic lines and painted the outline of the figure again.\n\nFinal images ( Size A3, Watecolour and white acrylic) :\n\nI then repeated the process again, but this time I incorporated Andy’s entire figure.\n\nThoughts and observations:\n\nMy portraits are basic in comparison but I like the overall effect. My first one gives a better impression of Andy, but both of them are very expressive. I think that if I did more of these from real life observation, then every so often I think you’d capture a really good gesture. A bit like how Degas constantly observed and depicted dancers, and Lautrec constantly observed and depicted prostitutes. The quick, direct observation sketches have life, movement and expression. Maybe I’d find using charcoal and white chalk easier because it would allow me to constantly observe and rework my figure.\n\nThis is something I could develop further. I might be able to have a go at this in my life drawing classes too depending on the focus."
