        "text": "1. Chapter 16 ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM AND THE NEW AMERICAN SCULPTURE\n\n2. • From 1945 to 1960, American painting moved increasingly toward abstraction. • America's insulation from destruction brought by the war attracted many artists from Europe. A group of artists living in New York focused on artistic innovation. • Among them were • Jackson Pollock, • Willem de Kooning, • Adolph Gottlieb, • Franz Kline, • Robert Motherwell, • Barnett Newman, • Ad Reinhardt, • Mark Rothko, • and Clyfford Still. • They challenged the aesthetic norms and created the style of painting known today as Abstract Expressionism.\n\n3. • In 1952 MOMA organized the exhibition “15 Americans” which introduced the Abstract Expressionism, sometimes called New York School. • Abstract Expressionism was the first American movement to achieve worldwide influence and also put New York City at the center of the art world. • Abstract Expressionism became the first American art movement to have an influence on Europe. • There are two major groups within Abstract Expressionism • Color Field Painters: Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still worked with simple, unified blocks of color. • Gestural Painters: Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Hofmann used Surrealist techniques of automatic art. Abstract Expressionism: • It is not a style, it is a common approach • Focuses on the PROCESS rather than the PRODUCT • Is non-representative • Is non-figurative\n\n4. Mondrian was born in 1872 in Amersfoort, the Netherlands. He spent his formative years in Paris, which he first visited in 1911. He arrived in United States in October 1940 He was 68 years old. In New York, Mondrian fundamentally restructured his thinking. He eliminated the black line completely, and replaced it by vivid bands of primary colors. In New York Mondrian’s painting lost its rigidity and became more rhythmic. Synonymous with New York, Jazz played a central role in the creative development of Mondrian’s paintings. Mondrian in New York: The Tempo of the Metropolis Piet Mondrian. Broadway Boogie Woogie. 1942-43. Oil on canvas, 50 x 50\". Anonymous gift. Museum of Modern Art, NY.\n\n5. Hans Hofmann emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1930. Hofmann's later work made a substantial contribution to Abstract Expressionism. His style is a fusion of various modes of expression. He mixed Cubist structure with Fauvist color. Hans Hofmann. Spring. 1944–45 (dated 1940 onreverse). Oil on wood. 11-1⁄4 × 14-1⁄8”. Museum of Modern Art New York Entering a New Arena: Modes of Abstract Expressionism\n\n6. Gorky, a direct precursor of the Abstract Expressionist movement, is usually labeled as one. Gorky’s body of work was crucial for the emergence of the Abstract Expressionist style. Many of his works had a very personal content, reflecting on the artist's traumatic past as a genocide survivor. Arshile Gorky was the biggest stylistic influence on de Kooning. Arshile Gorky. The Liver is the Cock’s Comb. 1944. Oil on canvas. 6’ 1-1⁄4”× 8’ 2”. Albright-Knox Art Gallery Buffalo, New York Gorky\n\n7. Willem de Kooning typified the vigorous gestural style of the Expressionist movement. He developed a radically abstract style of painting that fused Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism. De Kooning is generally considered an Abstract Expressionist, although he never fully abandoned the depiction of the human figure. He was attracted to traditional subjects and would eventually become most famous for his pictures of women. Willem de Kooning. Woman I 1950–52. Oil on canvas 6’ 3-7⁄8” × 4’ 10”. The Museum of Modern Art New York\n\n8. Pollock Jackson Pollock developed one of the most radical abstract styles in the history of modern art. He was influenced by the Mexican muralists David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera, all of whom were active in New York during the 1930s. From 1947 to 1952 Pollock created his most famous poured paintings, which he gave numbers rather than titles to avoid distracting the viewer with associations. Jackson Pollock. Guardians of the Secret. 1943. Oil on canvas 4’ 3⁄4”× 6’ 3”. San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\n\n9. Jackson Pollock. Number 1A, 1948, 1948. Oil and enamel paint on canvas 5’ 8”× 8’ 8”. Museum of Modern Art, New York Pollock used sticks, basting syringes, and old brushes that had become stiff. Pollock believed that the journey involved in creating art was just as important as the finished product. His work mixed elements of Cubism, Surrealism, and Impressionism, and transcended them.\n\n10. Wyeth broke from the trends of abstraction raging at the time. With her back to the viewer, Anna Christina Olson is looking out at her farmhouse. Affected by a degenerative muscular disease, Christina was unable to walk. Christina's World is subtle and unsettling. Andrew Wyeth. Christina’s World, 1948. Tempera on gessoed panel. 31 ¼” x 47 ¾” . Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\n11. Inspired by Mondrian, Krasner invented the \"all-over\" technique, which influenced Pollock's \"drip paintings.“ Krasner’s training in art theory, enabled her to distill her technique throughout the course of her career. She reused canvases she painted earlier to create collages. Lee Krasner. Untitled, 1949. Oil on composition board, 48 × 37”. The Museum of Modern Art, New York Lee Krasner. Milkweed, 1955.

Kline American Abstract Expressionist Franz Kline is best known for large black and white paintings depicting abstract compositions. Franz Kline’s black and white abstract paintings, have been compared to Japanese calligraphy. Kline didn’t attribute meaning to his pictures. Franz Kline. Nijinsky. 1950 Enamel on canvas. 46 × 35-1⁄4”. Collection Muriel Kallis Newman, Chicago\n\n13. Tamlin and Tobey In his work Tamlin combined Abstract Expressionism with Cubism. He died of a heart attack at the age of fifty-three.. Tobey’s dense compositions were inspired by Asian calligraphy. His work differs philosophically from most Abstract Expressionist painters. Mark Tobey. Universal Field. 1949. Pastel and tempera on cardboard, 28 × 44”. Whitney Museum of American Art, New York\n\n14. Guston The artists started out in the 1930s as a social realist painter. Later he developed a unique Abstract Expressionist style. He opted for a subtle painting technique in which forms seem to be indistinguishable. Zone suggests a warm calm. In the 1960s Guston developed a style of realism for which he is best known. Philip Guston. Zone, 1953–54 Oil on canvas. 46 × 48”. The Edward R. Broida Trust, Los Angeles\n\n15. Elaine de Kooning and Grace Hartigan Krasner and Elaine de Kooning were part of a community of visionaries dedicated to the exploring the limits. Krasner is often defined in relation to Pollock to whom she was married, but her work stands on its own. Elaine de Kooning was similarly defined in relation to her husband, although she forged a successful career as a painter and critic. Elaine de Kooning Harold Rosenberg #3 1956. Oil on canvas 6’ 8” × 4’ 10-7⁄8” National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution Washington, D.C.\n\n16. Rothko believed that his art could free the unconscious energies previously liberated by symbols, and rituals. He recommended that a viewers position themselves as little as 18 inches away from the canvas to experience a sense of awe, a transcendence of the individual, and a sense of the unknown. Despite his fame, Rothko felt a growing personal seclusion, and a sense of being misunderstood as an artist and feared that people purchased his paintings simply out of fashion. He wanted his paintings to move beyond abstraction, as well as beyond classical art. Mark Rothko. Untitled (Rothko number 5068.49) 1949, Oil on canvas. 6’ 9-3⁄8” × 5’ 6-3⁄8”. National Gallery of Art Washington, D.C Complex Simplicity: The Emergence of Color Field Painting\n\n17. Newman Barnett Newman shared the Abstract Expressionists' interests in myth and the primitive unconscious, but the large fields of color and trademark \"zips\" set him apart from the gestural abstraction of many of his peers. Newman believed that the modern world had rendered traditional art subjects and styles invalid, especially in the post-World War II years. Newman's paintings were a decisive break with the gestural abstraction. He devised an approach that avoided painting's conventional oppositions of figure and ground. Barnett Newman. Genesis —The Break. 1946. Oil on canvas, 24 × 27” Collection DIA Center for the Arts, New York\n\n18. He created a symbol, the \"zip. He thought that humans had a primal drive to create, and one could find expressions of the same instincts and yearnings locked in ancient art as one would find in modern art. He saw artists, and himself, as the creators of the world. Barnett Newman is viewed as crucial to the Abstract Expressionist movement and as a precursor to Minimalism. Barnett Newman. Onement, I, 1948. Oil on canvas and oil on masking tape on canvas. 27- 1⁄4 × 16-1⁄4”. The Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\n19. Newman rejected comparisons to geometric painters as well as comments that named him a progenitor of the Minimalist movement. Unlike those more stark canvases that focused on non-representational meaning of shapes and colors, Newman brought a more philosophical edge to his .

Still Clyfford Still, not as widely known as some of his New York School contemporaries. Still was not as widely known as some of his New York School contemporaries. Reinhardt Between 1936 and 1939, Reinhardt worked for the WPA Federal Art Project. From 1937 to 1947, he was a member of the American Abstract Artists group. Ad Reinhardt's work remains influential in the evolution from the Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s to the Minimal and Conceptual art movements of the following decade. Clyfford Still. Number 2, 1949. Oil on canvas 7’ 8” × 5’ 7”. Collection June Lang Davis Medina, Washington\n\n21. Gotlieb Adolph Gottlieb embraced Abstract Expressionism for its ability to express feelings caused by the trauma of World War II. Gottlieb employed symbols he created to appeal to the unconscious mind of the viewer as part of his communication process. His goal was to develop an universal meaning using the simplest form. Gotlieb also focused on the emotional effects of colors and space. Adolph Gottlieb. Orb from the Bursts series, 1964 Oil on canvas. 7’ 6” × 5’ Dallas Museum of Art\n\n22. Motherwell Several key themes define Motherwell's work: • the dialogue between • European modernism and a new American vision, • and between formal and emotional approaches to art making. Robert Motherwell's legacy is significant not only for the importance of his paintings, but also for the breadth and influence of his writing, editing and teaching. Robert Motherwell. Elegy to the Spanish Republic, No. 34. 1953–54, Oil on canvas, 6’ 8” × 8’ 4”. Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York\n\n23. David Smith. The Letter, 1950. Welded steel, 37-5⁄8 × 22-7⁄8 × 9-1⁄4”. Munson-Williams- Proctor Institute. Museum of Art, Utica, New York Drawing in Steel: Constructed Sculpture Smith and Dehner David Smith, was the first sculptor to work with welded metal. He successfully combined a range of influences from European modernism including Cubism, Surrealism, and Constructivism and created an art that was marked by expressions of trauma. Smith translated the painterly concerns of the Abstract Expressionists into sculpture. .\n\n24. Smith brought qualities of industrial manufacturing into the language of art. Collage influenced Smith’s sculpture. It inspired him to develop a process similar to paper collage, in the sense that a sculpture could be made of various existing elements. Smith was a an important influence on Minimalism. David Smith. left: Cubi XVIII, 1964.

Mark di Suvero, Iroquois, 1983 Metal , 42 ft × 40 ft × 3 ft Di Suvero and Chamberlain David Smith’s achievement in sculpture was distinctive and influential. Mark di Suvero is an Abstract Expressionist sculptor who welds scrap metal into monumental outdoor sculptural works. Later, he developed works based on industrial structures, such as welded or bolted l-beams and heavy gauge metal. He also incorporated motion into his pieces with swinging beams and rotating forms, allowing viewers to interact with the sculpture.\n\n26. John Chamberlain Hillbilly Galoot, 1960. Metal Abstract Expressionist sculpture developed first in Europe. In the US Chamberlain created vibrantly colored, dynamic sculptures from crushed, twisted and bent automobile parts. That aligned him with Abstract Expressionism. His use of three-dimensional space, and his use of color further set him apart.\n\n27. The term biomorphic, referred to as organic, describes the use of rounded abstract forms based on those found in nature. The style flourished during the 1930s/40s: the term \"biomorphic sculpture\" was actually first used in 1936, by Alfred H Barr. Biomorphic is a feature of the work of many different artists, such as Constantin Brancusi, Hans Arp, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. Noguchi Inspired by traditional Japanese art, and by the biomorphic qualities of some Surrealist art, Noguchi became known for his post-war art, architecture and design.

Tate Modern, London, 2007 Bourgeois Louise Bourgeois' work focused on psychologically traumatic events from her childhood, particularly her father's infidelity.\n\n29. Cornell Using Surrealist technique of juxtaposing seemingly unrelated objects, Joseph Cornell created new meanings through re- contextualization. Highly recognizable, his works consist of boxes in which he and old photographs, trinkets, and other found objects. The focus of Cornell’s shadow boxes are recurrent themes such as memory, space, and birds which offer an escape from the outside world. Cornell’s shadow boxes are the earliest examples of assemblage, Installation art, and Fluxus boxes.

Nevelson Louise Nevelson utilized wooden debris to create her large installations. Nevelson carefully arranged the objects and created a new context . Her sculptural environments included personal feelings about clashing cultures, and nature's divinity, informed by her biography. Nevelson’s large sculptures align with the monumental Abstract Expressionist canvases of American art of the 1950s. Louise Nevelson, Dawn’s Wedding Chapel I, 1959. Painted wood, 7’ 6” × 4’ 3”. Private collection\n\n31. White, Siskind, and Porter In 1938, Minor White began his career in photography in 1938 when he moved to Portland, Oregon White moved to New York City in 1945. He studied aesthetics and art history at Columbia University for two years. This contributed to the development of his own distinctive style. He became involved with influential photographers which included Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams. Minor White, Sun in Rock Devil’s Slide, 1947.

Aaron Siskind focused on images resembled the non-representational designs of abstract painting. In his photographs he emphasized the modernist concern with the flatness of the picture plane by close-up framing, texture, and line. Eliot Porter was known for his color photographs of nature. His career in photography started when a friend introduced him to Ansel Adams and Alfred Stieglitz who showed Porter's photographs in his New York gallery in 1938.
