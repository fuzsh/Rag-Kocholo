        "text": "Modernism and Postmodernism were the art of the 20th century. Art in the modernist and postmodernist period is often misunderstood, and as a result also often disrespected. Many of the famous artists of this period are (in true age of media form) as famous for being famous as they are for their artworks. Travelers have plenty of destinations to choose from to see Modern and Postmodern art. The United States is home to several extremely high quality museums: the Museum of Modern Art (aka MOMA) in NYC, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in NYC, among others. Europe loves modern art - in Paris alone you'll find at least a half-dozen places (like the architecturally controversial Pompidou Centre) to view work of various Modernists and Postmodernists), along with a plethora of Postmodern street art by artists like Banksy and Invader. And of course London is home to the incomparable Tate Modern.\n\nWith these guides you'll be able to select just the content on Amazon Prime that you are looking for. Work your way through each section in chronological order, or go straight to a specific topic or artist. Simply find the era you want to learn about and then select either a general educational resource, or for more detail select an artist from the alphabetical listing.\n\n[Content Warning: Some programs in these Amazon Prime listings feature art that contains nudity or unvarnished intimate details of artists' personal lives. I suggest pre-screening content before showing it to children if that concerns you.]\n\nModern & Postmodern Art\n\nModernism and Postmodernism are a brave new world in art that leave something important behind: images of reality. Instead of trying to faithfully depict what they saw around them, artists began to interpret it - or even to paint their own internal space. Although we may think of modernism as a 20th century invention, it was truly invented in the 19th century by Realists, Impressionists, and Post-Impressionists. The great realist painter Edouard Manet is considered by many to be the true father of Modernism.Postmodern (or Contemporary) art is considered to cover the period roughly after 1970. One new element of postmodern art is the encompassing of kitsch, commercialism and pop culture into \"high art\". Neo-Expressionism also has brought back a version of the Expressionist style that originally was created 100 years ago by artists like Edvard Munch and Max Beckmann. This period of art is more eclectic in form and style than previous eras, as street art, performance art, digital art, and other mediums have become part of the art world.\n\nEnd of the Art World\n\nHistory of Modern Art\n\nReArt: Modernism: Ferdinand Hodler, Franz von Stuck, Gustav Klimt, Henri Matisse, Henri Rousseau, Konstantin Somov, Mikhail Vrubel, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes (1871-1934)\n\nReArt: Expressionism: Edvard Munch, Egon Schiele, Jackson Pollock, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Wassily Kandinsky, Willem de Kooning\n\nReArt: Surrealism: Giorgio de Chirico, Lucian Freud, Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dali, Yves Tanguy 1902-1944\n\nReArt: Abstractionism: Kazimir Malevich\n\nModern & Postmodern Artists\n\nWithin the umbrella of Modernism and Postmodernism, these artists represent a variety of different styles: Neo-Expressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, Surrealism, Symbolism, and more.

He also painted the ceiling of the Opera Garnier in Paris during the same period.\n\nReArt: Expressionism (Episode 5 - Marc Chagall \"The Promenade\")\n\nSalvador Dali (1904-1989)\n\nThis versatile Spanish surrealist was as famous for his publicity stunts as for his art.

He was part of the so-called \"New York School\" with artists like Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, and was strongly influenced by Picasso and Ashile Gorky. The influence of Picasso can especially be seen in de Kooning's famous series of \"Woman\" paintings. A de Kooning oil painting, \"Interchange\", sold for $300 million in 2015, which for a short time was the highest ever sale price for a painting until it was surpassed by DaVinci's \"Salvator Mundi\".\n\nWillem de Kooning Artist\n\nReArt: Expressionism (Episode 11 - Willem de Kooning \"The Wave\")\n\nMasterworks from the Great Museums of the World (Season 21 - Episode 5 - Willem de Kooning - Morning the Springs)\n\nMarcel Duchamp (1887-1968)\n\nDuchamp is credited by many art historians as being one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.

After a controversy arose when a ceiling he designed for the University of Vienna was declared to be pornographic, he stopped doing public commissions and turned to private artistic work. Before his life was cut short by Spanish Flu in 1918, he created masterpieces like \"The Kiss\" and \"Portrait of Adele Bloch I\", both during what is known as his golden phase.
