This exhibition brings together for the first time the various life-size models, as well as most of the sculpted and drawn variations. Accompanied by numerous unpublished documents and drawings, it traces the genealogy of the motif, from the Walking Woman from the Surrealist period to the icons created in 1959-1960.\n\nThese works, halfway between image and sign, between figuration and abstraction, bear witness to the artist's tireless quest to represent the essence of the human being.

This embodiment of humanity, which is particularly precious in the present day, places this work among the best known in the world.\n\nThe Walking Man was, in his first state, a Woman Walking (1932). The motif indeed appears in a surrealist work, an intriguing Egyptian-inspired figure.\n\nIt reappeared after the war, on the occasion of commemorative commissions for which Giacometti explored the modes of representation of a universal human figure (1946). The first Walking Man in large Size (1947), again borrows its attitude from the Egyptian model, whose style Giacometti admires.\n\nOn the contrary, the following works draw their inspiration from everyday life. The artist restores the perception of a street situation captured by chance from the terrace of a café.\n\nThe very poetic Figurine entre deux maisons (1950), which features a female figure, is reminiscent of the dreamlike atmosphere of the surrealist works.\n\nThree Men Walking (1948), The Square (1948) or Man Crossing a Square (1949), thus translate the fleeting vision of life offered by the movement of people moving in the distance.\n\nThe artist did not take up the motif again until 1959, when he received a new commission for the public space. It was under these circumstances that he created the sculptures that are now considered icons of 20th century art. In all, he will have created four life-size Walking Man, three of which are cast in bronze.\n\nGuide audio\n\nDiscover \"The Walking Man\" with comments from the different rooms of the exhibition.
