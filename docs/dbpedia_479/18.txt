Alberto Giacometti, brother of sculptor Diego Giacometti, was both a sculptor and painter. His early surrealist work would only after the 1940’s transform into the slim and tall human figures in bronze he is mostly famous for. Giacometti played a big part in the surrealist art movement, however his works are hard to categorize after his transformation of style. Some have labeled him as formalism as well as expressionism.

Some of Alberto Giacometti's associates are Joan Miró, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Bror Hjorth and Balthus.
