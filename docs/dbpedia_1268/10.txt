Tramuntana

Over the years I have produced many albums for Rock en Espanol artists. One of my favourite artists is Enrique Bunbury and favourite studios is Musiclan in Avionnet des Puig Ventos. The clue is in the Catalan word Puig Ventos, strong winds, and in particular the Tramuntana wind rattling my hotel window shutters ever night coming off the Pyrenees in the distance. The album Hellville Deluxe was recorded there and I subsequently joined Bunbury on stage at the Plaza de Toros in Madrid.
