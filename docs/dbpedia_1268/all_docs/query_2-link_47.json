        "text": "Seven Seas Voyager® harbors overtones of elegance, from the refined Penthouse Suites to the modern touches of the Voyager Lounge.\n\nAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\n\nThe discovery of oil in 1958 transformed this rural backwater into a modern metropolis with the highest per-capita income in the world. Today, Abu Dhabi boasts extraordinary sky scrapers, shopping malls, top quality hotels, tree-lined boulevards and picturesque gardens, while still maintaining a subtle Arabian mystique. Sail the lovely Gulf waters and numerous islands surrounding the city in a traditional dhow; tour heritage Village, a living museum where artisans ply their traditional crafts; or shop the central souk area for gold and Bedouin silver jewelry.\n\nMahé, Seychelles\n\nMahé, the largest island of the Seychelles, was named for Mahé de Labourdonnais, a governor of Mauritius. It is the location of Port Victoria, the capital city. Ringed by steep and magnificent mountains, few capitals can claim a more beautiful backdrop.
