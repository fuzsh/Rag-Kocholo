        "text": "Nautica\n\nElegantly charming, Nautica’s lounges, suites and staterooms boast luxurious, residential furnishings and her decks are resplendent in the finest teak, custom stone and tile work. Nautica offers every luxury you may expect on board one of our stylish ships. She features four unique, open-seating restaurants, the Aquamar Spa + Vitality Center, eight lounges and bars, a casino and 333 luxurious suites and chic staterooms, nearly 70% of which feature private verandas. With just 656 guests to pamper, our 400 professionally trained staff ensure you will wait for nothing.\n\nIn a dramatic re-inspiration process, Nautica will become a completely redesigned ship without peer. Every surface of every suite and stateroom will be entirely new, while in the public spaces, a refreshed colour palette of soft sea and sky tones will surround a tasteful renewal of fabrics, furnishings and lighting fixtures that exquisitely encompasses the inimitable style and comfort of Oceania Cruises. From the bejewelled new chandeliers in the gracious Grand Dining Room to the beckoning Reception Hall, Nautica will celebrate a rejuvenation so sweeping, you will find it positively unimaginable to resist her welcoming embrace.\n\nThe Grand Dining Room is a study in stateliness, a tribute to the spirit of Europe’s marquee five-star hotel restaurants that inspired its dignified yet convivial ambiance. Handsomely decorated in rich woods, designer tapestry fabrics and oversized armchairs, the expansive dining area exudes classic splendor. This signature dining experience has always offered a bevy of delicious Continental dishes, and now a fresh and new array of options brings you even more exciting choices, as well as an incredible spectrum of global flavors and an all new Executive Chef’s Tasting Menu. As variety is essential to your satisfaction, menus change daily with an expansive choice of at least 10 appetizers, soups and salads and 10 dinner entrées, along with healthy options such as Aquamar Vitality Cuisine, gourmet vegetarian selections and the most extensive array of plant-based dishes at sea.\n\nOpen for breakfast, lunch and dinner. No reservations required.\n\nInformal and carefree, the Terrace Café is wonderfully inviting any time of day--feel free to dine inside or alfresco at one of the shaded teak tables on the terrace. First thing in the morning, enjoy sumptuous breakfast selections. Come lunch, the expansive menu of international-inspired dishes changes entirely, beautifully complemented by flavourful roasted and rotisserie meats and the magic of the pizzeria’s oven. Feel free to dine inside or alfresco at one of the shaded teak tables on the terrace. Evenings, the impeccably clad wait staff shines, and the cuisine takes on a more sophisticated flair. Lobster tails and lamb chops are prepared to order, and freshly made hand-cut sushi and sashimi await your selection. Tomorrow, an entirely different series of menus awaits the opportunity to delight you.\n\nOpen for breakfast, lunch and dinner. No reservations required.\n\nWorld-class musical performances will delight you, showcasing an ever-changing array of guest entertainers such as pianists, classical string quartets, dynamic vocalists and spectacular headliners.\n\nEach of our ships features a unique lineup of onboard shows and entertainers to ensure that your interests are constantly piqued. Bold and crowd-thrilling, nostalgic and upbeat, or intimate and sophisticated – whatever you choose, the night is yours.\n\nNautica's versatile and talented cast performs the following diverse production shows:\n\nBroadway in Concert\n\nCome on along and listen to…the lullabies of Broadway! In this elegant concert-style review, our fabulous production cast vocalists pay tribute to some of the most iconic musicals of all time. You’ll experience songs you know and love, and maybe you'll discover one or two more contemporary gems. Let us entertain you…because, after all, “There’s no business like show business!”\n\nShowdown\n\nYour vote counts in this mock singing competition, where you, the audience, chooses the winner. Join our production cast and cheer on your favorite singer as he or she belts out some pop favorites in hopes of taking home the title. Will they sway your vote? Find out because it’s time for a SHOWDOWN!\n\nGood Lovin’\n\nGood Lovin’ is an infectious tribute to the irresistible beat of soulful pop and Motown classics that filled the airwaves throughout the 1960s. It is the ultimate soundtrack for the baby boomer generation and rocks some of the best music of its time.\n\nGatsby’s\n\nThe upbeat and quirky musical score is compiled from timeless tunes, inspired by the 1920s and includes blues, jazz and Tin Pan Alley standards like “Makin' Whoopie,” “Won’t You Charleston,” “Puttin’ on the Ritz” and “I Wanna Be Loved by You” and the melodies of Duke Ellington and Fats Waller.\n\nMartinis\n\nMartinis serves numerous incarnations of this famous cocktail in an intimate atmosphere reminiscent of a private gentleman’s club, featuring live piano music.\n\nGrand Bar\n\nBefore enjoying a gourmet meal, sample a rare vintage or imbibe your favourite libation as you enjoy spirited conversation with new found friends amid the opulence of the convivial Grand Bar.\n\nLounge\n\nFrom headline acts to comedians and magicians to lively jazz ensembles, the Lounge is the centre of nightly entertainment aboard Oceania Cruises.\n\nHorizons\n\nAn elegant observation lounge with dramatic floor to ceiling windows and a country club casual ambiance, Horizons features our beloved teatime by day and transforms into a sophisticated evening venue by night. Dance the night away to the sounds of a lively musical group and enjoy cocktails with friends at the convivial bar.\n\nWaves Bar\n\nLocated in shaded area steps from the swimming pool, Waves Bar offers a wide variety of libations to enhance your poolside experience. A perfect afternoon on the deck with your favourite cocktail or a glass of wine or beer can be further enhanced with a decadent dessert such as a creamy homemade gelato, a made-to-order hot fudge sundae or a thick, hand-dipped milkshake. Nearby, at Waves Grill, chefs grill gourmet burgers, tangy barbecue and succulent seafood to order in the open galley, accompanying them with the side dishes like garden-fresh salads and crispy, hand-cut truffle fries dusted with grated aged parmesan.\n\nStay Connected\n\nStay connected with family and friends or monitor business developments in our 24-hour Internet centre, Oceania@Sea.\n\nFor personalised service, Oceania@Sea is fully-staffed on both sea days (8 a.m. - 7 p.m.) and port days (8 a.m. - 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. - 7 p.m.).\n\nInternet\n\nOceania Cruises also offers wireless Internet access throughout the ship, allowing you to connect through your laptop or mobile device. And as an added convenience, guests in all Owner's and Vista Suites will have the use of an iPad® throughout the voyage. iPad® is available upon request for Penthouse Suites and Concierge Level Staterooms (limited availability).\n\nMail\n\nLetters and postcards with the appropriate postage can be mailed at the Reception Desk. Postage for mail may be purchased at the Reception Desk for a nominal fee. Mail will be collected one hour prior to sailing from each port of call.\n\nIncoming mail or faxes received by the ship on your behalf will be delivered directly to your stateroom.\n\nPhone\n\nOceania Cruises offers Wireless Maritime Services (WMS) for all GSM mobile phones and GPRS devices such as Blackberry® when the ship is at sea.\n\nYou can make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages and use other data services when the ship is at sea. You will be billed by your mobile phone provider and calls or messages will appear as roaming charges on your bill. While using the WMS service, international maritime roaming rates will apply. Please consult your wireless service provider for detailed rates and service zones.\n\nQuietude At Sea\n\nPick up a steaming cappuccino and settle in to the welcoming ambiance of our classic library on board Nautica with the novel or bestseller you’ve been meaning to read. Read, relax and feel right at home with more than 2,000 books and periodicals to choose from as you sail from one destination to the next.\n\nJust as sailing aboard Oceania Cruises recalls the elegance of the Golden Age of Travel, our inspired English-style library is reminiscent of a charming English country estate where you can while away the hours in ultimate comfort. There is something magical about the dark, rich woods; the plush high back chairs; the cozy fireplaces and rows of books lining the walls, each a new world waiting to be discovered."
