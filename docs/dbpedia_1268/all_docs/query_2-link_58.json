        "text": "German here. We went there 1 1/2 weeks for Honeymoon vacation and it was wonderful. The view is amazing - it doesn't look real, and if you're not in the pictures you take, people will think its ai generated. White beach sand, palms, shimmering, turquoise ocean and a bit of rocks and jungle in the distance, no people - amazing. You can go snorkeling directly at the beach, or you chill at the beach bar and get supplied with pizza and cocktails all day. You can also book day trips at the reception all day if you feel like it and the dates are really flexible. Tips: 1. The european food (except pizza and french fries) was not so good, but the malagassy food was amazing - stick to that when you go there. I also went brave and ate raw fish there, didn't die and it was delicious 2. We could only book day trips with cash Madagascar money and you can NOT WITHDRAW MONEY there, so make sure to bring enough. A day trip is around 100 € pP. The only place, you can withdraw money on nosy be is one ATM 30 min drive away where you have to go by tuktuk and I heard its not stacked often. 3. ITALIAN ONLY. Most people don't understand english here, or french, just malagassy and Italian, so be sure to learn some phrases before you go there. I downloaded duolingo there and started practising italian lmao All in all 100% recommended!! Loved it there\n\nThis hotel is really amazing. When I saw local people outside the resort and living conditions on Madagascar, this place is like emperor's palace compared to Nosy be / Madagascar standards. Overall I would like to give 5 stars to this hotel. There are some things I would like to share with you. First impressions: When we arrived to the beautiful and renovated lobby, we were given welcome drinks which was very refreshing after 10 hour long flight from the Europe. The hotel was very clean without any bad odors. I would like to thank to all cleaning service stuff which kept ALL hotel facilities clean. Hotel room: The A/C was operating very quietly, temperatures were perfect, beds were comfy with functional safe locker in the wardrobe, we had some prehistoric LED TV which we even did not turn on because of lack of modern features. WiFi was pretty slow, but it was working in the room and in some hotel facilities. Everything was clean. Fridge was very loud and empty. We were given no drinking water except one 1.5L bottle on our arrival and if you wanted some you had to pay for it. I think it was 5 EUR for 2.5L of water which is strange considering we paid for all inclusive services... Restaurants and food: There was central restaurant where you could get a breakfast, lunch and dinner. In my opinion the opening times for the meals were pretty short - it was something like 1.5 - 2 hours. It is also possible to eat in Pily Pily restaurant which overlooks the sea. Lunch is complimentary and for dinner it is for a surcharge. Food was so delicious, full of fishes, sea food, range of vegetables, fruits and many many many more categories. Beaches and pool: Beaches very clean, sometimes there were some annoying local sellers and scammers which were luckily not allowed to come to hotel loungers. They are selling some local products which are extremely overpriced. There is often a tide which you need to take into consideration, so sometimes the sea disappears and you have to go 100 meters further to reach the water, but sometimes it is normal and you don't have to walk too far. The water is very warm and pleasant with plenty of warm sand and it feels so nice to swim in it. You need to be aware of a lionfish. When we were swimming on the sandy part of the ocean very close to the shore, there was one lionfish swimming 2 meters close to us. These fishes do not usually attack and we did not feel any discomfort when we saw it, but we started to be aware of our surroundings, because if the fish attacks you, you would probably die considering the lack of proper medical attention. If there are any more serious health issues, you would need to get transported to the RSA by a plane which takes some time, so be careful at all times. Hotel services: There is a doctor on site which we did not have to use, 2 amazing restaurants, some hotel bars which can offer you some delicious snacks and even pizza throughout the day, there are 2 hotel shops where you can buy many local products which are expensive, but at least high quality. It is possible to purchase local tours and excurcions. We bought 3 islands visit and it was truly spectacular! The hotel has beautiful gardens which are very clean, the grass is cut and it has amazing care, so thumbs up for the gardeners stuff! It is possible to encounter some amazing animals such as giant turtle called \"Karolina\", lemur, chameleon and 4 crocodilles which are in cage. There are some SPA facilities which we did not use, big swimming pool which was very pleasant, some animations and shows in the evening which we also did not use and many other things. Overall I can give to this hotel excellent rating. Even though we had some indigestion issues, it is not problem of this hotel, it is problem of Africa. All staff members were super friendly, we got all the care what we needed, it was very clean, nobody was rude, food was very tasty, we slept very well, pretty much everything was working and amazing memories we had will persitst. Thank you for your services!\n\n**Pros:** - Pools, gardens, and exteriors are very nice. - The restaurant staff is very friendly, and they provide good service, even cooking dishes not on the French menu. - The deluxe room is nicely decorated and spacious. **Cons:** - The BUNGALOW is very small, dark, and has no air circulation or AC; it's extremely hot. There's no light at all. Couldn't see myself in the mirror for four days, nor could I see inside. It's very humid. I had to throw away clothes that got wet because of the smell. We had one more night but preferred to leave and lose the money. There were a lot of mosquitoes, so we had to stay inside in the dark most of the time. - Deluxe cottage with views: Nice views for one night, but overrated for the rest. A few meters away is the town sewer, and the smell comes and goes with the wind. - No breakfast included. They charged us 30,000 AR for a continental breakfast and then charged separately for coffee, fruit, omelet, etc. It's unclear what's included in the continental breakfast - just sugar maybe. Realized at checkout that breakfast was not included. We always had a bill to sign saying 0 AR; we didn’t expect to have to pay. And it's not a buffet. Sometimes you get a small portion, sometimes a big one. I wouldn’t have had breakfast if I had known. - They say pancakes, expecting several nice pancakes, but they bring a dry single crepe. - Couldn’t talk with the receptionist to clarify about the double charge for continental breakfast and food, as they only spoke French, not much English. Ended up paying US$300 for food for three days. And we only had one meal, mostly plain white rice per day, as we were sick. - The menu is 100% French. Fish/chicken with coconut is the only dish that’s not. And the menu is only in French. - Other tourists from different places felt the same, facing discrimination for not speaking French, and finding the menu too French. - On the first day, the four of us ate grilled seafood and all got food poisoning with diarrhea for three days. Talked with other guests at the restaurant, and two other rooms had the same symptoms. We were in Africa for 30 days and only got food poisoned at this hotel. - no bottle openers - no salt in the restaurant - The manager cares more about how she looks and dresses, saying \"bonjour\" to everyone, than about management and the well-being of guests. - hotel oriented to make money rather that give a good service and nice holiday memory. - We left for another hotel few blocks from this one even if they were going to charge us the room."
