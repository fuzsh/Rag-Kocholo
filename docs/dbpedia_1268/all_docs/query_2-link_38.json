        "text": "Seven Seas Mariner® exudes class, from the delectable offerings of Chartreuse to the debonair atmosphere of the Connoisseur Club.\n\nKuala Lumpur (Port Klang), Malaysia\n\nSpend the day discovering this cosmopolitan city and its many cultural levels, from the soaring Petronas Towers to a Royal Palace, Gothic churches, stolid Colonial remnants and a restored Malay timber house, once the residence of a local headman in a lovely Heritage Center. Browse in the markets and shops. Shop for crafts, excellent pewter, jewelry, batik. The fusion of cultures here offers a variety of menus from Malay and Chinese to continental cuisines. Try a curry or spicy broiled duck, a satay or broiled fish.\n\nLangkawi, Malaysia\n\nExplore the relaxed charm of Langkawi with its farms, fishing villages and peaceful rice paddies. Langkawi boasts colorful myths and legends, dramatic mountains, and vast, pristine beaches. Begin with a visit to Eagle Square. Then soar to the height of eagles on the Langkawi cable car and admire the amazing views at Kereta Kabel. Look for beautifully handcrafted plates made from cinnamon trees. Discover the impact of rice agriculture in Malaysia with a visit to the Laman Padi Langkawi. Try seafood sizzlers made with coconut and chile paste or tea and chocolate treats in this romantic paradise.\n\nPhuket, Thailand\n\nWith a land area of 215 square miles, Phuket Island is about the same size as Singapore, making it Thailand’s largest island. Known as the “Pearl of Thailand,” this beautiful retreat offers pristine beaches, lush vegetation, traditional villages, and seascapes of huge limestone pillars that tower over the turquoise waters of Phang-Nga Bay. Apart from tourism, much of the province’s wealth derives from tin production, which started back in the 16th century.\n\nGalle, Sri Lanka\n\nDiscover the fortified town of Galle, with its history of Portuguese, Dutch and British influences. Explore the Colonial grid layout within the walls of this thriving town home to artists from around the world. Don’t miss a visit to the National Maritime Museum and the nearby Dutch Reformed Church. Then stroll to the Clock Tower built in the 1700’s. The Meera Mosque and the Great Warehouse built in 1669 to store spices are other points of interest. Then hire a tuk-tuk to transport you to the beautiful village of Unawatuna Beach. Enjoy the Japanese Pagoda, then a swim or snorkel in the protected bay. Shop for lace, batiks, polychromatic masks and jewelry among the many shops and galleries.\n\nColombo, Sri Lanka\n\nCapital of the ancient Kingdom of Kandy, Colombo has been visited for over 2,000 years by Roman, Chinese, Arab and European traders. Explore this exotic city and view colorful colonial buildings including the Presidential Secretariat, the Grand Oriental Hotel, and the Lighthouse Clock Tower. A “must” to visit is Pettah, Colombo’s leading bazaar district. The narrow cobbled streets are lined with shops and street stalls offering the most unimaginable range of goods. Other noteworthy sights include Viharamahadevi Park, the city’s largest and oldest green expanse; and the palatial mansions of Cinnamon Gardens.\n\nKochi (Cochin), India\n\nPopularly referred to as the ’Queen of the Arabian Sea,’ Cochin (Khochi) has been a trading post since early Roman times, due to its strategic location between Europe and China.
