        "text": "Atlanta, Georgia Nov 11, 2020 (Issuewire.com) - Meagan Holder (Pitch) stars in this family-centric holiday story as Chloe, an Atlanta-based chef at a fine dining restaurant who gets fired just weeks before Christmas and reluctantly takes a job with pro baseball player Donovan Jackson (Rucker), who is a single dad of three needing a live-in-chef to get him through the holidays with the kids. Chloe only takes the job in order to save up enough capital to live out her dream of opening her own restaurant, but soon finds herself caught up in the ups and downs of the Jacksons encounter during her residency. Throughout the holiday season in the Jackson household, the importance of family and Chloe’s good Southern cooking are two constants that remain. As Christmas comes to an end, Chloe discovers that her lifelong dream might finally come true… and that her heart has a mind of its own. Cooking Up Christmas also stars Jen Harper and Laparee Young from OWN’s Greenleaf and Lindsey Amani Blackwell from OWN’s David Makes Man. Cooking Up Christmas is produced by Errol Sadler and Ty Walker of TYCOR Films for OWN by MarVista in association with Harpo Films. Executive produced by Roger M. Bobb, Lamman Rucker, Megan Ellstrom, Larry Grimaldi, Hannah Pillemer and Fernando Szew.\n\npaidpost\n\nMedia Contact"
