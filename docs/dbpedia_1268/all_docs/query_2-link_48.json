        "text": "CRUCIAL BLAST WEBSTORE: NEW ARRIVALS - AUGUST 2024\n\nGet ready for a MASSIVE list of new releases, rare warehouse finds, and everything in between! Stay tuned!\n\nHere's a quick rundown of most of the other new releases and re-stocks that are on this week's new arrivals list:\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nAs always, that's just the beginning. There's much more mutant heavy music and misanthropic art to be found on our shelves and in our bins...keep reading below to check out all of the strange and extreme new music, film, and art that's included in this week's new arrivals list.\n\nYou can now click on the cover image for any title that we carry here at Crucial Blast to see a pop-up photograph of the actual item! Not all of our older titles that we have in stock have product photographs attached to them, but almost anything new that we get in stock will have this feature. The pop-up photo feature can be wonky (like most things) if you are using Internet Explorer, but works perfectly in Firefox and other browsers.\n\nFEATURED RELEASE\n\nFIELDS OF THE NEPHILIM Burning The Fields 2 x LP (Jungle Records) 39.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\n\nTHOU Peasant (Reissue) 2 x LP (Robotic Empire) 36.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBack in print on vinyl for the first time in a decade, Thou's second full-length album Peasant has been remastered and presented with all-new artwork, packaged in a heavyweight gatefold jacket with spot-varnish printing\n\nand accompanied by an oversized twenty-page booklet. In addition to the complete original album, this reissue also tacks on the songs from their 7\" EP To Carry A Stone and the Malfeasance - Retribution 10\", both of\n\nwhich had come out around the same time in 2008. Immense, monumental music from the early days of this famed band. Here's the old review from the original CD release:\n\nAnother excellent disc of ultra slow heaviness from Thou, the young Baton Rouge outfit that has been taking the doom/sludge underground by storm this year with their debut Tyrant and recent U.S. tour, reports of which\n\nhave been coming back with the assessment that Thou kill fucking everything. Louisiana and New Orleans have been the breeding grounds for leagues of sludge metal bands, Eyehategod and Crowbar obviously the overlords of that\n\nparticular little pocket of underground metal, but every once in a while we get a band that comes out of that scene and pushes the swampy sludge/doom sound further out, putting their own unique stamp on it, and such is the case with\n\nThou. I hear a lot of NOLA's Eyehategod in the deep, bluesy sludge, but the riffs are even heavier, more metal, with a massive fucking tone that sounds like none other than the mighty Warhorse, whose guitars were some of the\n\nheaviest ever heard. But it is the amazing melodies that Thou brings to their pulverizing slomo metal that really makes them stand out, each song possessed by gorgeous sections of near-pastoral prettiness, or soaring, majestic\n\nleads.\n\nPeasant delivers six long tracks of crushing, crusty doom and viscous sludge, and fans of Tyrant will find more of what they loved about that album...blackened, evil shrieks and raspy, shredded near-whispers, ultra-\n\ncrushing detuned riffage, sprawling song structures that move dramatically from epic crush and bluesy riffing to bittersweet melody. Opener \"The Work Ethic Myth\" evokes the sorrowful dirge of Crowbar but with delicate guitar filigree\n\nwisping out from the grinding undercurrent, while \"Burning Black Coals and Dark Memories\" opens with a beautifully moving clean guitar melody a la Mono before descending into a morass of tarpit droneriffs, feedback stretched into massive\n\nwarbling whale songs and swirls of spacey effects. Fans of extreme doom and sludge metal have a lot to dig in to here, if you're already a devotee of bands like Corrupted, Monarch, Khanate, Trees, but Thou take it further than that,\n\nbringing a majestic, Temporary Residence/Mono/Explosions In The Sky sort of melodic beauty to their music that never takes away from the sheer grinding, lumbering CRUSH of their music. Like the last album, this is accompanied by imagery\n\ntaken from old woodcut style art, which illustrates the social/political undercurrents in Thou's lyrics through apocalyptic visions and symbols, rendered in eye-popping high contrast. Recommended.\n\nCAUCHEMAR La Vierge Noire LP PICTURE DISC (Nuclear War Now! Productions) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGNAW THEIR TONGUES Hymns For The Broken, Swollen And Silent CD (Crucial Blast) 9.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nA shambling monstrosity Woven from charred bones and infernal technology, stitched with gristle and exposed wiring. Hymns For The Broken, Swollen And Silent lurches like a grotesque assemblage of tortured flesh and mangled machinery, revealing the latest nightmare from Dutch fiend Gnaw Their Tongues. After more than a decade, the band continues to disturb with its uniquely dark and depraved blend of black metal, industrial and noise, and the eight-song Hymns shows Gnaw Their Tongues to be in prime killing mode.\n\nComing in the wake of a series of live performances starting in 2015, this new material from GTT mastermind Mories (Seirom, Cloak Of Altering, Mors Sonat) seems to find him tapping into a heavier, more violent rhythmic element as well as a more pronounced use of synthesizers, producing yet another step in the evolution of GTT's sound. Throughout the album, the harsh drum programming offers a mixture of cacophonous blast beats and grueling, glacial detonations; the sickening, tumescent groove that surges through \"Hold High The Banners Of Truth Among The Swollen Dead\" resembles something approximating a vile chopped n' screwed dubstep / blackened doom abomination, while on tracks like \"Speared Promises\", it slips into a hideously dissonant deathcrawl where those drums almost seem to be shorting out. Elsewhere, \"Frail As The Stalking Lions\" contorts into hellishly warped synth-sludge, and the hallucinatory weirdness of the title track delves into a black pit of ghastly ambience, gleaming synth and malfunctioning, off-time drum programming, which becomes possessed by bizarre operatic vocals that drift amid the anguished shrieking.\n\nThrough all of this, the band's signature use of unsettling samples and blasts of orchestral power is woven through the mix, turning each track into a seething mass of claustrophobic horror. Eruptions of ultra-frenzied blackened blast and floor-shaking depth-charge reverberations, ravenous, psychotic vocals and swells of choral despair, distorted electronics and gut-churning bass riffs, mournful horns and weirdly layered female operatic singing - yeah, Hymns delivers on the promise of chaotic horror that one expects from Gnaw Their Tongues, evoking foul, corrupted imagery while also (as usual) streaked with striking moments of warped, morbid beauty.\n\nCD edition comes in a gatefold digisleeve.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Silent Burned Atrocities\n\nSample : Hold High The Banners Of Truth Among The Swollen Dead\n\nSLOGUN Sacrifice Unto Me CD (Bloodlust!) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nTREPANERINGSRITUALEN Deathward, To The Womb CD (Cold Spring) 16.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNewly reissued on gorgeous gatefold digipak CD, and featuring the bonus track \"I Remember When I Was God\", an epic collaboration with Michael Idehall and members of Arktau Eos, Bölzer, Aether, and Hadewych. As for the album proper, here's our original review from 2012:\n\nOne of the latest releases from this Scandinavian master of diseased occult industrial, Deathward To The Womb originally came out on 10\" vinyl from Release The Bats and has since sold out from the label; it appears that we snagged the last available copies of this fearsome death-rite.\n\nBeginning with the incredibly thick and suffocating death-drift of \"The Birth Of Babalon\", Trepaneringsritualen wastes no time in unleashing its oppressive graveyard ambience, laying massive slabs of rotted noise and low-end rumble across distant, barely perceptible rhythms that feel like war-drums pounding from deep below the earth's surface, while deep, slurred vocals slowly ooze over the ghoulish soundscape, drenched in delay and black tar. It just gets creepier and more sinister as it progresses, heading into the bleak lightless depths of the title track, a monstrous death industrial dirge in the classic Cold Meat vein doused in blackness, filled with deep rumbling drones and evil guttural incantations, high wailing tones that come screeching through the void, and a slithering doom-laden bass line and distant percussive rattling and clanking that builds upon the already unnerving atmosphere of inescapable death. The side closes with a real knockout, the lurching death-dub nightmare \"Osiris, Slain & Risen\" that smears all sorts of hallucinatory effects over a deep, sinister bass-groove.\n\n\"She Is Flame Of Life\" opens the b-side with more grim electro-throb, a pulsating distorted synthesizer drone a la Genocide Organ that worms its way through a fog of moaning demons, swells of minor-key creep, and blood-encrusted machinery slowly revving to life. A more ritualistic feel (though no less horrific in tone) permeates the steady percussive pounding and slavering jaws of \"Sacrament & Crucifixion\", where foul Evil Dead-like voices call out from behind a veil of rot. The closer is one of Trepaneringsritualen's most rhythmic tracks, a pounding graveyard celebration called \"All Hail The Black Flame\" that blends thick cloying smears of black noise with ecstatic roars of bloodlust and booming, dubbed-out tribal drums that recalls the groovier moments of MZ.412. Only this is awash in enough exhumed filth to give you strychnine poisoning.\n\nMURDEROUS VISION Hidden Histories CASSETTE (Impulsy Stetoskopu) 8.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nStill one of the most consistent death industrial outfits currently active here in the US, Stephen Petrus's long-running Murderous Vision came out with this cassette a short while back on the Polish label Impulsy Stetoskopu, a full-length album of dark, oppressive ambience and cold, clanking loops woven into highly atmospheric driftscapes. The five tracks that make up this tape are in a similar vein as other recent Murderous Vision works like Engines & Disciples and To Know How It Will End; each is an expansive mass of sound formed from a variety of rumbling, rattling mechanical noises that have been looped together into hypnotic churning patterns, draped in thick layers of murky low-end drone and blasted with gusts of icy blackness, with violent eruptions of garbled electronics and brutal percussion breaking through the dense wall of sound.\n\nIt gets pretty heavy at times, as tracks like \"A Hatred That Binds\" materialize into huge grinding noisescapes, super-distorted drones and blown-out bass churning beneath frenzied electronics and washes of gaseous feedback, or slip into sprawls of glacial rumble like \"Feeble Ways To Sell Your Soul\", the low-frequency murk infested with surges of insectile synth-noise. Like lots of Petrus's stuff, it's all pretty oppressive, texturally dense with moments of vast, mesmeric power, a wall of malevolent noise rising ever skyward, seething with all kinds of aural activity. And at a couple of points, the sound even drifts into a monstrous power-electronics assault, furious screamed vocals suddenly ripping out of the sonic slime and echoing wildly across fields of inhuman percussive pummel and a backdrop of roaring, over-modulated machinery. The whole tape reaches its apex with the throbbing nightmare that is the title track, also notable for featuring Gary Mundy of Ramleh/Skullflower infamy delivering his demonic, wailing vocals against the sound of a malignant, penetrative pulse.\n\nReleased in a limited edition of one hundred hand-numbered copies.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : MURDEROUS VISION-Hidden Histories\n\nSample : MURDEROUS VISION-Hidden Histories\n\nSample : MURDEROUS VISION-Hidden Histories\n\nNIGHTSTICK Blotter LP (Armageddon) 15.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGRIEF Come To Grief CD (Willowtip) 10.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Stricken\n\nSample : Earthworm\n\nSample : Bury the Dead [#]\n\nCELTIC FROST Innocence & Wrath 2 x CD (Noise) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCONTROLLED BLEEDING Distress Signals I + II 2 x CD (Artoffact Records) 21.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nLYCUS Chasms (BLACK VINYL) LP (Relapse) 16.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nPSUDOKU Planetarisk Sudoku CD (Selfmadegod) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThe return of the cosmic blast-attack. Planetarisk Sudoku is the newest sci-fi damaged spazz-gasm from this interstellar grindcore band headed up by the guy behind Parlamentarisk Sodomi and Brutal Blues, but while the previous album was a solo effort, this one has him teaming up with his Brutal Blues bandmate Anders Hana (also of Noxagt and Ultralyd) to execute his maniacal vision.\n\nThe album is essentially divided into two halves: the a-side tears through three tracks in about fifteen minutes, a high-speed splatter of choppy grindcore and insane free-jazz squonk sped up and stitched together into a jarring patchwork of eerie blastprog. As crazy as the debut was, this stuff feels even more complex and convoluted, the staccato guitar riffs slashing and slanting wildly through sprawls of Goblin-esque piano arrangements and swells of soundtracky strings, everything spit out into a maelstrom of abruptly shifting time signatures and extreme stop/start tempo changes that leave bloody skidmarks all over the album. The obvious influences that you could pick out on the first record are a little less in your face here; while the pungent stink of 70's era prog rock a la King Crimson still heavily permeates Psudoku's high-speed grind, all of this stuff comes together much more organically this time around, making for an even weirder listening experience. Big chunks of the album appear to be entirely instrumental, but then there's the bugfuck carnival blast of \"NeURONaMO\" with it's sputtering gorilla chants, blurts of monstrous nonsense over the whiplash-inducing mix of fucked-up fusiony electronics, discordant riffs and theremin abuse, blaring saxophones splattered against blasting mathy grindcore, resembling some crazed ketamine-sucking version of Behold...The Arctopus. And somehow, they manage to lodge some perversely catchy hooks in amongst this cuisinarted skronk-salad.\n\nPsudoku momentarily restrain themselves at the outset of the b-side track \"PsUDoPX.046245\", which takes up the entire side. Opening the song with a few minutes of eerie cosmic ambience, this placid intro allows the eminent extended blast-attack to sneak up on the listener. But also it moves in a different direction from the more grind-style songs on the first side. Here, the band spills out of that initial maelstrom of blastbeats and angular riffing into a twisting labyrinth of creepy prog rock, slipping into a killer Magma-esque instrumental passage for a bit before shifting into some more aggressive math-metal contortions strewn with bizarre vocal gibberish, then from there hurtling through continuously evolving passages of heavy jazz-damaged rock flecked with chilling orchestral ambience and blasts of Zeuhl-style choral voices, continuing to contort and confuse in glorious fashion all the way to the weirdly bright and joyous finale of the track. An absolutely bonkers album, anyone into Naked City, Pryapisme, Colin Marston's various projects, Netjajev SS and similar extreme spazz-attacks will lose their fucking mind upon hearing this...\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : PSUDOKU-Planetarisk Sudoku\n\nSample : PSUDOKU-Planetarisk Sudoku\n\nSample : PSUDOKU-Planetarisk Sudoku\n\nMELVINS Houdini CD (Atlantic) 15.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSUNN O))) & BORIS Altar (2023 REISSUE - BLACK VINYL) 2 x LP (Southern Lord) 37.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nOne of Southern Lord's most infamous releases, the colossal collaboration Altar from 2005 is finally back in print, with this new edition presented as a double LP in casewrapped gatefold packaging, the six-song album proper, and featuring a new vinyl cut. The beast arises again...\n\nHere's my original review of the album, slightly edited for this double LP version:\n\nIt's here. Sunn O))) and Boris' collaborative monument Altar, available as an awesome deluxe double LP, presented in an elaborate oversized sleeve with a matte finish and gorgeous gloss varnish. The huge sleeve contains a oversized 12\"\" booklet of liner notes written by Kim Thayil (Soundgarden) and gorgeous color photos. Still one of the coolest, most extravagant vinyl packages I've seen.\n\nOn Altar, the members of both Boris and Sunn O))) come together for sum ultra-heaviness. As powerful and perfect a combination of Boris' psychedelic sludge metal and Sunn O)))'s maximalist power-drone as I could ask for, while simultaneously bringing some new and wholly unexpected sounds to the meeting. The album opens with \"Etna\", a slow creeping tide of rumbling feedback menace and subterranean bass tones that drift and surge for several minutes before the dronescape is beset by chaotic cymbal crashes, rolling free percussion and monstrous glacial beats, definitely sounding like Sunn O))), but way more charred, more crushing, if you can imagine that. Drummer Atsuo propels the monstrous saw-toothed doom riffs forward beneath a crimson sky filled with piercing, nightmarish guitar leads and squalls of howling apocalyptic feedback. This fades into the shorter dark dronescape \"N.L.T.\", filled with washes of resonant bowed bass tones, shimmering rings of bowed cymbals, and sparse gongs ringing out, deep and cavernous, creating an effect that is redolent of the metallic dronework of Daniel Menche or Organum. After that, comes the albums centerpiece, the stunning slow motion torch song \"The Sinking Belle (Blue Sheep)\", featuring a gorgeously smoky vocal performance from orchestral folk-pop legend Jesse Sykes. \"Sinking Belle\" maintains the glacial pace that underscores the rest of Altar, but the song also dials the distortion and sludge all the way out into the red. The result soaks this dreamy guitar figure in oceans of reverb and delay, gently gliding alongside an equally dreamy piano melody and subtle, silver-gilded slide guitar accompaniment. It’s almost stinging in its beauty, like a Mazzy Star tune dipped in dead leaves and autumnal hues.\n\n\"Akuma No Kuma\" follows, returning to the magnificent heavy drones, but as soon as the alien, vocoded throat-chants appear, Melvins / Thrones mastermind Joe Preston is on the scene. This was one of the biggest selling points for me when Altar first came out, as I was in the throes of a full-on Thrones obsession. And this is essentially a Thrones / Sunn / Boris super-band, manna for my ears, delivering an eight-minute feast of abstracted buzz-saw Moog, splattered saurian drumming, brain-melting satanic vocoder monk chants, and a fucking fist-raising horn fanfare that sounds like it's about to morph into Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra at any second. Whew! After that, \"Fried Eagle Mind\" finds Wata from Boris giving a bewitching vocal performance, emitting soft, haunted moans into a building narcoleptic haze of ringing guitar notes, all of it hanging in a pre-dawn mist, haunted echoing tones seeping through everything, crackling glitches of feedback running down the walls. It's quite creepy, in fact. And even more so when Wata's whispers transform into hellish demonic shrieks as swarms of deformed death metal guitar dives in, and wave after wave of floor-rattling amplifier drone begins to flood in, forming a sea of black murk that sweeps the entire track out into the void, giving way to the album's closer, \"Blood Swamp\". This is the longest song, a fifteen minute mega-drone ritual that features famed Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil contributing his sound to the mix. Starting off with an ominous wash of deep gong tones, a quintet of guitars and dual Moog synths slowloy enter, building another immense buzzing doomdrone, spotted with gleaming clean guitar notes and a scorching, paleolithic slo-mo solo from Thayil. It's fucking awesome.\n\nJust like I said back in 2005, I can't recommend this one nearly enough. The sheer range of hues on Altar makes this one of the greatest albums either band has been involved with, in my opinion. I can only hope that this won't be the last time they connect for this kind of all-encompassing collaboration. A beautiful and monstrous cooperation, enhanced even more by Aaron Horkey's outstanding artwork.\n\nBAND, RICHARD Troll (Original Soundtrack) LP (We Release Whatever The Fuck We Want) 34.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS Void: Daeva Durzeiriche / Moloch / Saturn Form Essence / Magatsu Juso CD (Sabbathid Rex) 11.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSIMONETTI, CLAUDIO Demons (Ultra Deluxe Vinyl Boxset) LP + 7\" (Rustblade) 109.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nWINDHAND self-titled (2023 REISSUE) CD (Relapse) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nRelapse recently reissued this 2011 masterwork of psychedelic doom, originally out from Forcefield Records. But this revamped 2023 edition of Windhand's dreamy graveyard crawl has undergone a major overhaul, virtually to the point where it's a different release. I listened to my original Forcefield CD and compared it to this, and the re-mastering by the legendary Jack Endino has transformed the sound immensely - it has this huge cavernous depth that's really noticeable to me. I still love the withered, roughened spookiness of the original release, but this one is packing some considerable extra power. Not only that, but both the new CD and vinyl editions of Windhand's eponymous debut feature more than half an hour of bonus material that'll feed the fix for any hardcore Windhand fanatics. And this also features brand new artwork from the masterful Arik Roper, which enfolds the album in an even more ghoulish visual atmosphere.\n\nHere's my original take (lightly edited) on the five-song album proper (\"Black Candles\", \"Libusen\", \"Heap Wolves\", \"Summon The Moon\", \"Winter Sun\"):\n\nSo, here's where it all started for this remarkably popular doom metal outfit from Richmond, VA. It's easy to see what it is that caught everyone's ear with these folks, though, as Windhand skillfully capture the spirit of classic American doom metal while producing some really well-written songs with real staying power. And of course the presence of lead singer Dorthia Cottrell is a large part of their appeal as well, her bewitching, bluesy voice imbuing these lumbering Sabbathian dirges with a strange and earthy dark magick. They've received all kinds of accolades from the metal community since this album came out, which was followed buy a number of high-profile releases on Relapse Records. In my opinion though, Windhand has never sounded better than they did on this debut. It really takes something special to stand out amongst the hordes of Sabbath / Vitus-worshiping doom bands out there. While there's no mistaking the influence of those pioneers on Windhand's music, they twist that grim, despairing sound into something that feels both more personal and more unique, adding an extra heavy dose of psychedelic malevolence to their dark, mournful atmosphere. The guitarists bring a hefty amount of ultra-heavy droning power to the riffs, without sacrificing any of that hypnotic tone, and Cottrell's witchy moan drifts languidly and imposingly across it all, powerful and phantasmal, her deeply soulful wail echoing through a haze of reverb, having this far-off quality, rising like the smoke from a bonfire of dried, withered Eastern Redbud limbs burning low somewhere in the distance, hanging over the pulverizing psych-doom of songs like \"Libusen\" and \"Summon The Moon\". Great stuff.\n\nWith that striking vocal performance, the wrecking-ball-heavy grooves of the rhythm section of Nathan Hilbish and Ryan Wolfe, and the howling twin guitars from Asechiah Bogdan and Garrett Morris, Windhand's molten blacklight vibe becomes all-encompassing. The songs shift from menacing, insanely slo-mo heaviosity to some supremely brain-melting moments of jet-black space rock madness that emerge deeper into the album, where trippy Hawkwindian effects and cosmic guitar noise sweep across the pulverizing bluesy groove. Like the epic twelve-minute closure of \"Winter Sun\", which features guest vocals from Drew Goldy of RVA black metallers Bastard Sapling. Those are by far my favorite moments on Wimdhamd, delivering a picture-perfect combination of titanic riffage and sky-climbing delirium, the cumulative sound of the band achieving something so heavy and mesmeric, dark and threatening, everything steeped in a sort of rural dread that's echoed in the Appalachian ghostliness of the lyrics. Of course, all of this is what you'd probably expect from this kind of band, but Windhand do it better than most, one of the few bands I've heard that has succeeded in tapping into the same black energy as early Electric Wizard, while sounding utterly \"Virginian\" at the same time. Highly recommended if you're a devotee of the slow and low.\n\nThe bonus tracks are hidden early gems from the Windhand vaults. You get versions of \"Heap Wolves\" from their 2009 Practice Space demo and \"Black Candles\" from the Sound Of Music demo from the same year; both recordings have earlier drummer Jeff Loucks on the kit. Raw and rumbling. There's a remixed version of the song \"Amaranth \" from their split with Cough; this had previously shown up on Rue Morgue Magazine's 2012 Hymns From The House Of Horror III compilation. And the last two songs \"Black Candles\" and \"Winter Sun\" are pulled from a 2010 practice space demo. The practice space recordings and early demo material sound remarkably good, capturing that gritty, sinister vibe of the original version of the first album. It's all as pulverizing as anything you've heard from them.\n\nBUTTHOLE SURFERS Blind Eye Sees All (Live In Detroit 1985) DVD (MVD) 13.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSWOLLEN ORGANS Feeling About Gender Guilt Over Time CDR (Annihilvs) 9.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBOHREN & DER CLUB OF GORE Gore Motel CD (Epistrophy) 18.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Die Nahtanznummer, Teil 2\n\nSample : Der Maggot Tango\n\nSample : Cairo Keller\n\nFREE SALAMANDER EXHIBIT Undestroyed CD (Web Of Mimicry) 13.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nPHANTOM LIMBS, THE Applied Ignorance CD (Alternative Tentacles) 13.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nLAROCHELLE, REMY MATHIEU Mecanix (2003) DVD (Unearthed Films) 18.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCYBER-PSYCHOS A.O.D.

Rossini is one of a crapload of self-released discs that Great Kat has been putting out recently, and like the rest of 'em, I'm obsessed with this shit. As I've mentioned in other reviews of Great Kat material, this current incarnation of the boisterous speed metal siren feels like it walked right out of one of Nick Zedd's post-y2k films, so over the top and knowingly silly that it goes beyond a mere musical experience into the realms of oddball comedy and a very singular strain of fetish material. I have no doubt that Great Kat knows exactly how absurd and outrageous the combination of hyperspeed speed metal, classical music, scantiliy clad cheesecake shots, and berserk energy actually is, and that she's rather hilariously pushing this sound an look as far as she can within what has become something of a cottage industry for the woman over the past thirty-five years.\n\nLike all the other newer EPs and videos, this stuff is maniacal. A ten-minute EP of gonzo speed shred. Total bombast, cranked to the max. Here, the classical pieces being hyperwarped into her fretboard overloads are Beethoven’s \"Pastoral Symphony No. 6 \", \"Eroica Symphony No. 3\", \"Für Elise For Guitar, Violin and Piano \", and \"Bolero Mosh\" (yeah), as well as Rossini’s \"William Tell Overture\" (transformed into something so ecstatically spastic I can barely keep myself together) , Czardas' \"Gypsy Violin\", and Paganini’s \"Caprice No. 24\". The production on Rossini is actually a step above many of her other recent discs; I'm assuming that Great Kat is still using sequenced drumming and backing orchestration to accompany her guitar amd violin performances, but it all sounds much more organic and natural than usual. This is still completely fucking berserk, though. The violin arrangements are multi-tracked into a kind of cocaine-dusted blissout, screaming fretboard shredding and virtuoso violins colliding into bizarre grandeur, with each song racing to an abbreviated, ADD-blasted duration of a minute and a half. I think that this EP, despite all of its outward absurdism, is one of the better showcases of Great Kat's unique style and skill (as well as her ability to piece tjhings together on her own in post0production), whereas some other fairly recent TPR Music discs have had more of a programmed, almost industrial feel to the percussion and symphonic sections that carries a colder, more clinical vibe.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony No. 6\n\nSample : Paganini's Caprice No. 24\n\nSample : Beethoven's Eroica Symphony No. 3\n\nFUDGE TUNNEL The Complicated Futility Of Ignorance CD (Earache) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAMANO, MASAMICHI Urotsukidoji: Legend Of The Overfiend 2 x LP (Tiger Lab) 32.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBeautiful gatefold vinyl release of Amano's legendary electronic score to one of the kinkiest, horniest, most transgressive and downright vile anime of all time. I remember when this film hit videocassette in the early 90s; my friends and I were instantly obsessed by it, and we would hold regular viewing parties in the punk house I rented because we just could not believe that something like this existed. The American anime audience was just beginning to take shape, and many of us became fans of the form after the high-profile release of iconic films like cyberpunk classic Akira and the massively influential Robotech series. But nothing could have prepared us for the debauchery, eroticized violence, and ultra-surrealistic horror that came gushing out of our old cathode floor-model TV and ripping any remnant traces of innocence from our young selves.\n\nIf you've never seen it, it's difficult to describe: the muddled narrative, made even more convoluted in the English language dub, is a jumble of teen-sex hijinks and high-school melodrama that somehow collides with an ancient apocalyptic prophecy in which a human being emerges as the “Choujin”, capable of transforming into a skyscraper-tall demonic monster with gargantuan, wildly flailing genitalia; somehow this leads into weird inter-dimensional espionage, bizarre romantic interludes, completely bonkers splatter and body-horror at the Cronenbergian level, sickening displays of extreme sexual violence, human bodies being pulled apart like taffy…it's an orgy of nonsensical ero-guro chaos and tentacle-porn that just keeps building in frenzied strangeness, graphic violence, and mind-blowing obscenity. It actually makes even less sense when you watch it.\n\nThis shit was crazy. After that, our nascent otaku-hood was spurred on by the discovery of ever more violent and depraved animated films coming out of Japan, but looking back over the past thirty-odd years, it's hard to come up with anything that matched the sheer offensive power of Urotsukidoji on first watch. Also, as an interesting pop-culture note, White Zombie famously opened their landmark 1992 album La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Vol. 1 with a sample of one of the electronic sequences from a key scene in the film. Just so you know.\n\nHow Masamichi Amano fell into this job, God knows. A perfectly respectable composer for Japanese film and television, for whatever reason he was tapped to set the musical accompaniment to this trashy animated filth. But man, he gets on it with gusto. Amano's offbeat score for the original film is as recognizable and iconic as the film itself, full of blasting synthesizers and orchestral electronics that draw from progressive synth music of the 70s and 80s , the hammering overwrought majesty of Gustav Holst's The Planets suite, and the action-driven electronic sound of contemporary video games. There was and is nothing like it. From what I can tell, this is the complete score, with eighteen tracks spanning the entire film; amazingly, this has apparently never been made available on any physical format before now. Tonally, the music is all over the place, keeping in line with the madcap pace of the film. The sounds range from the soft, billowing New Age romanticism of \"A New World\", \"Niki's Final Moments\" and \"Nagumo And Akemi\" that blends digital chimes, synthetic strings, and lovely mock-woodwind tones to make something so saccharine and mawkish that it sounds like it could have been on a romantic film score cassette from 1983. The orchestral synth sounds feels huge, with lots of auditorium-reverb and booming tympani. Such a weird contrast with the visions of demonic rape and ultra-graphic gore that lurk around every corner. The action-themed pieces like \"Battle Among The Skyscrapers\" come out of nowhere, with rapid-fire electronic drums, orchestral stabs, driving pop hooks, and swirling celestial synth arpeggios and the appearance of some weird musical scales; this is the stuff that often evokes the feel of the more berserk video game soundtracks of that era, or maybe am especially nutso TV cop drama. The utterly goofy , funky 80s \"sex comedy\" keyboard music of \"Campus Theme\" feels totally ridiculous by itself, but the fact that this piece leads into one of the film's most notorious and outrageous sequences of demonic molestation make it that much weirder. As with most anime of the time, there’s a lot of Japanese \"city pop\" / easy listening music in here, as well, which again just adds to the insane surrealism of the whole thing.\n\nThere are all kinds of madness in here. It's psychotic: jazzy fretless bass guitar sounds, prog rock-level Moog freakouts, blazing electric guitar shredding, wacky intricate faux-symphonics, Jerry Goldsmith-esque orchestral arrangements, titanic war-drums, all of these come together in varying degrees. Then you have stuff like \"Birth Of The Overfiend\" that shifts into avant-garde composition, using atonal improvised piano, suspenseful drones, militaristic percussion (with unmistakable shades of Holst's \"Mars, The Bringer of War\"), eerie choral voices, and even bird sounds to create a strange, grim, otherworldly ambience. Likewise, \"Charmer And The Half Beast: Amano Jyaku\" further uses dissonance and strange scales alongside quasi-industrial noises and creepy synth, forming a throbbing, threatening electro-dirge mixed with pop melodies to totally throw you off kilter before it explodes into another blast of 16-bit action music. Then there’s the growling ghastly dronescapes of \"Suikakuju's Rebirth\", while the expansive, cinematic dark ambience of the main theme \"Legend Of The Overfiend\" is skillfully-crafted texture. One of my favorite tracks is \"Oceanic Overlord\", which crosses between cyberpunk synth and something resembling an Akira Ifukube kaiju score. Wild, wild shit.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Urotsukidoji OST - Oceanic Overlord\n\nSample : Urotsukidoji OST - Birth of the Overfiend\n\nSample : Urotsukidoji OST - Battle Among the Skyscrapers\n\nSample : Urotsukidoji OST - A New World\n\nSUNLESS Ylem CD (Willowtip) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFORNACE Deep Melancholic Wrath CD (Paragon) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nI've listened to previous Fornace albums here and there, the band goes back to around 2000 but have only released three albums to date; the previous stuff I've heard was a solid mixture of black and death metal centered around dark atmopsherics and catchy but malevolent riffs, drawing somewhat from the Hellenic field of pioneers like Varathron, Rotting Christ and (to a lesser extent) Necromantia. Over the yearss this Italian band developed a fairly straightforward approach to their brand of barbarous blackened violence, but Fornace always manage to throw a curveball into their listening experience that makes 'em one of the more interesting bands that I've picked up recently from the Paragon catalog. 2018's Wrath\n\nThe sheer diversity of the epic-length songs and the intricate assemblage of it all hints at an underlying progginess, but it's overshadowed by the immensity of the hypnotically repetitive passages, sharply skillful transitions, all flowing deliberately and fluidly; this easily lines up as the best album Fornace has delivered so far.\n\nBut you wouldn'y\\t know it from the first song...\n\nThat opening song had me glowing. You see a title like \"Experience The Joy Of Unhappiness\" and you think you have a mopefest coming your way, but this first song is actually a rather unpected burst of super-catchy blackened jangle, all instrumental, huge grandiose major chords roaring in the dying twilight, the main chord progressions having that infectious punk quality that Ghost Kommando, Wóddréa Mylenstede and some of the Peste Noir stuff has, a quirky melodicism that flies in the face of the album's visual aesthetics yet works ferrociously as a kicker to this hour-long nocturnal rite, the song sounding like some kind of weirdly catchy energy and guitar sound that evokes early Dinosaur Jr. or Husker Du, but most definitely filtered through an abrasive, distorted, blackened aggression. The closer follows suit, \"Her Beauty In Those Days\" sprawling out it's strange dismal mid-paced blackened rock and alternating it with faster sections that center around the song's main melodic hook; it's \"poppy\" enough that I'm pretty sure fans of stuff like Alcest and Lantlos would dig the hell out of it, but doesn't sacrifice those snarling, despairing shrieks and rampaging double bass and massive amp-rumbling power. I'm a HUGE fan of stuff like this. When they break down into some of their more rocking mid-tempo sections on other songs like \"Bare\" and \"Morti\", and \"Under The Bright Cursed Star\" , you continue to hear a little more of that unusual open-chord melodicism, only soaked more fully and deeply into the surrounding frost-charred intensity, that vaguely \"punky\" stripped-down energy that bores its many earworms into your head, often fading into the distance. Another standout is \"La Notte Dei Morti\", were the rhythm section come to the fore and lock on this hypnotic groove that features some almost Bauhaus-esque bass guitar, everything awash in muted sheets of guitar glaze, before the band abruptly whips themselves back up into another whirlwind of heart-rending blast. But that first song, man, it's a banger.\n\nI'm definitely a big fan of Fornace's guitar sound, it adds a nicely unique aspect to their white-hot ferocity. It's all just so goddamn catchy.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Her Beauty In Those Days\n\nSample : La Notte Dei Morti\n\nSample : Experience The Joy Of Unhappiness\n\nMSBR + BLAZEN Y SHARP Dirty Knobby 7\" VINYL (Genderless Kibbutz) 5.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAnother artifact dredged from the underground noise scene of the late 90s, this collab between the sadly missed MSBR, a titan of the original Japanese harsh noise field, and the more obscure Blazen Y Sharp,\n\nseems like this was one of two collabs on Kibbutz , the other titled \"MSBR & Blazen Y Sharp - Mass For Dead Insects\"....I gotta track that down, STAT\n\nAlthough it's a mere five minutes of sound and presented on a blue marble 7\" with just the one side, this recording is sublime. Amid the natural crackle and hiss of the needle on vinyl, the EP unfolds a field of junk metal shimmer and distant grinding sounds into something that gradually begins to take on the aspect of some post-nuke orchestra of percussionists akin to a traditional taiko drumming squad, thunderous in the depths of a compromised public safety shelter, clanking and rumbling percussion building in intensity and volume and power, laying out a huge, muscular groove that shifts between actual drum-like sounds and strange metal-on-metal clang, violent metallic battery and rumble, which dominates almost the whole a-side until it begins to disappear into a ghostly blur of distant voices, drifting feedback, crackling noise. Peals of feedback ring out, mysterious conversations, whirling clunkering noises all teem together in this low-fi peice that slowly fades away into nothingness. I'm not used to hearing anything from MSBR that leans towards this sort of quiet, creepy minimal clatter, but it's a great piece. Almost feels more like something from Z'ev, or one of the Finnish ritual ambient shamans.\n\nUnfortunately, we lost Gender-Less Kibbutz label owner John Sharp himself several years ago, a real loss to both those who knew him and loved him, and the wider underground experimental music scene at large. Sharp's curation with this label was strange and inspired, and there are records in his back-catalog that will make you feel as if you've been rocketed off to some other planet. His work, with not just this release, but all of GK's output, is a materialized labor of love, and a manifestation of aural power. Can't recommend this label's output enough to those of you who live and breathe extreme noise.\n\nWALDCHENGARTEN Electric Bonding CD (Desolation House) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSEVEN HEADED SERPENT Ophidian Mysteries 2021-2023 CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 9.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThe Ophidian Mysteries: Demos 2021-2023 cassette is a collection of all of the previously digital-only demo recordings from this outrageously cacophonic bestial noisecore outfit, along with a sixth, previously unreleased demo that appears here for the first time. Seven Headed Serpent came to me like a message from the ether; or maybe I had just Google-searched the words \"bestial noisecore” and this band was the first thing to pop up. Either way, this Texan outfit spews out a very specific mélange of ultra-violent anti-musical filth that I've been looking for. The only thing in the vicinity of this is the similarly-monikered \"bestial” noisecore of Acwelan, but there are clear distinctions between the two bands, save for their intention to rip the listener to pieces. Over the course of nearly three years, Seven Headed Serpent has been steadily issuing short, absurdly brutal blasts of noisecore via their Bandcamp page and disseminated through shady Youtube channels every few months. That first time that I hit \"play\" on their debut Awakened From Ancient Slumber demo, I was enthralled: here was the spastic bastard vision of venomous scum-blurr that I'd been searching out, an eerie and relentlessly hyper-violent maelstrom chopped up in twenty-second micro-blasts, an unholy fusion of early Oath Of Black Blood Beherit and demo-era Von style minimalism, and the old-school hyper-speed noisecore laid down by the likes of Sore Throat, Seven Minutes of Nausea, and Anal Cunt.\n\nThere's already a strain of noisecore-adjacent chaos that you can find in the \"war metal\" underground, but nothing like Seven Headed Serpent. The combination of improvisational pandemonium, ludicrous machine-gun blast tempos, and gruesome, bone-gargling vocalizations turns each one the band's demos into a bizarre ritualistic experience. Track after track of almost industrial-esque drum machine disorder and hideous, inhuman vocals are splattered with effects to the point of psychedelic meltdown, and yet you'll hear these \"songs\" sometimes drop into a crushing bass-heavy groove for a moment, or a more mid-paced Conqueror-like blast that jerks you out of the insanity. Those vocals from main member R. (aka Ryan Wilson of Intestinal Disgorge, The Howling Void, and Pneuma Hagion) can be seriously unsettling, veering between an echo-laden animalistic roar and disturbing whispers, garbled guttural shrieks and trippy incantations. Freakish electronics and blots of distorted nonsense blur with extreme anti-riffery and indecipherable guitar skree. Flatulent machinery collides with severely bestial grunts and bursts of insane guitar shred, while something akin to the sound of limbs being ripped from a torso keep emerging in the back of the mix. That drum machine element is strongest on the earlier demos, as from Naas on , R. was joined by drummer Polwach Beokhaimook who brought a less mechanical, more car-crash style blast attack to the Serpent's maniac slime-meditations; anyone familiar with Beokhaimook's work in key gorenoise outfits like Cystgurgle and Vomitoma will recognize the additional free-form percussive confusion and inhuman speeds that he brings to this mangled sonic abomination.\n\nAt this point it should be clear that if you are looking for \"music\", well, don't look here. This is base primitive chaos, an attack of acute, depraved disorder. I can't get enough of it. But what there is, it's all here. The Awakened From Ancient Slumber, Upheaval , Naas , Withering Storms of Howling Death , and Unleashed demos are all presented in chronological order, with the final set of recordings being Reckoning, a previously unreleased nine-track \"demo\" recorded in January 2023 and exclusive to this release.\n\nThis edition of Ophidian Mysteries: Demos 2021-2023 comes on red cassettes with full-color artwork, and includes a brief set of liner notes from C-Blast scribe A. Allbright.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Withering Storms of Howling Death XI\n\nSample : Unleashed VIII\n\nSample : Reckoning III\n\nSample : Upheaval IX\n\nSample : Naas II\n\nSample : Awakened From Ancient Slumber XVI\n\nNO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE DEAD THINK self-titled CD (Willowtip) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nALLIN, GG Volume II: 1981 - 1988 CASSETTE (TPOS) 7.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSo if you're a rabid GG vinyl collector, there's a good chance that you already have at least most of the EP material gathered together on this cassette, although as I’ll mention momentarily, there's is some rare shit here that even I hadn't come across before. This TPOS tape is a total anomaly. Purported to be a collection of \"singles\" from Allin's various incarnations throughout the 1980s (although the actual release dates of these EPs frequently date beyond 1990), I haven't been able to find any concrete information on this specific tape anywhere. That said, this is a bulldozer of Allin's signature scatological punk, with some stunningly brain-blasting versions plucked out of the rotting compost heap that is his studio discography.\n\nThe EP material is smeared across both sides: live recordings of \"Dirge\" and \"Dog Shit\" that I think came off of the extremely rare Sickest of The Sick 10\", recorded live at Kisha's in Berkeley, CA, on March 17, 1989. That track here titled \"Dirge\" (which might also be known as \"Jesus & Mothers Cunt\", but I'm not 100% on that) is one of my fave GG freak-outs, a murky mess of stumbling doped-out freeform punk-sludge / noise-dirge a la Kilslug or Flipper with some demented Greg Ginn-esque guitar skronk whipping everything into a bloody heap, while GG rants and drools and grunts his murderously anti-social and blasphemous stream-of-conscious madness, an almost improvisational meltdown from the whole band; it's a beast, definitely one of the more fucked -up and outre GG Allin jams from the era. The other tune follows some in-the-moment discussion from GG, before we get nuked in the face by a shambling, pissed-off \"Dog Shit\" that sounds like GG has something crammed down his trachea. Gnarly. Another berserk live recording features \"Diarrhea Blues\", \"Drink Fight And Fuck\", \"Cock On The Loose\" and \"Out For Blood\" which all appear to be taken from the 1990 Live...Carolina In My Ass 7\" that came out on Repo Records. The band sounds a little more demented than usual, rocking out a grueling head-on collision of stomping caveman skuzz and brain-damaged blues-punk boogie, head-bobbon' buzzsaw anthemic HC, some almost Oi!-esque \"Cock\"-action that is subversively catchy. Blown out and low-fi but completely psychotic, this definitely sounds like a show that I would've killed to be at. Bonus points for the entire additional venue chatter where people are dealing with the aftermath.\n\nOne of my favorite GG Allin EPs is the one he did with Bulge, \"Legalize Murder\", \"Suck My Ass (It Smells)\", \"Interior Depths\" all coming off the Fudgeworthy Legalize Murder 7\" from 1990. Again, sound quality is brittle and harsh, which makes the bat-shit guitar shredding and wood chipper riffs all the better; ferocious speed violence smashing against the noisecore-style nonsense of \"Ass\" and a radio cue and the barbaric sample -laden and spoken-word-draped industrial dirge-crush of \"Depths\" that rivals anything from Brainbombs or Nearly Dead or Rectal Hygeniacs, awesome free flowing hate filled misanthropic prose-poetry smeared against the most abrasive kind of avant-hardcore shit-feast. Oh boy. That's tailed by the more straightfo0rward skull-caving punk rock of the 1991 versions of \"Violence Now\" and \"Cock On The Loose\" that make up the GG Allin / Antiseen collab 7\" on Jettison; better productions and thicker mix doesn't detract from the blinding ugliness of this one bit. And the final track \"Fartmaster\" is (I think) off the Penis Rising 10\" released in '91, which had Allin collaborating to various extents with the Bulge dudes again; it's a pounding sing-a-long that really makes you feel alive again.\n\nI did an obscene amount of research on this tape with make heads and tails of what this material is sourced from, so hopefully this breaks down exactly what 7\" releases are gathered here. Such is the case with a lot of these old GG tape compilations. That said, this definitely fucked me up in more ways than one. Uncut, unexpurgated transgression.\n\nINTEGRITY / KRIEG split (BLACK VINYL) LP (Relapse) 15.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSAVAGE REPUBLIC Tragic Figures: 40th Anniversary Expanded Edition 2 x LP (Real Gone Music) 26.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nColossal 2022 reissue\n\nThe LP is available on red vinyl in a pressing of 2000 copies, packaged in a particularly striking gatefold jacket.\n\nHailing from a window of time in the 1980s when bands, partuclarly American ones, were taking the influence of paradigm-shifting post-punk like Public Image Ltd., Joy Division, Wire and Gang Of Four into more harrowing, aggressive, abject dimensions, the earliest Savage Republic music is dark and mesmeric and harsh on their debut album Tragic Figures from 1982. Along with the influence of the screeching atonality and anti-social skronk of the NYC No Wave crowd, this music also leeched some of the primal percussive power and dystopic deliria of the burgeoning post-industrial music scene, and found Savage Republic (for awhile at least) creating an abrasive clamor and more menacing attitude that would get comparisons, then and now, to other early 80s street-beaters like Swans and Big Black. I ended up discovering Savage Republic way later in life, which is aggravating; if I had heard this in my teens when I was utterly obsessed with Swans and the early proto-noise rock underground, Tragic Figures would've been rumbling out of my bedroom at all hours of day and night. When I finally had someone shove this record under my nose several years ago, it was kinda revelatory. This stuff was heavy, not in the metallic sense of course, but heavy in mood and 'tude, more aggressive and acerbi9c than what I might have expected to hear.\n\nThat cover image of Iranian military forces executing Kurdish rebels in 1979\n\nOn the first side, the music is tilted towards more of an instrumental breakout - the metal-on-metal percussive frenzy comes on strong as opener \"When All Else Fails\" bursts forth like a crazed protest assault, an array of rattling, stomping, clanking rhythms laid over each other while heavy bass and chugging distorted guitar grind out simple, sludgy, skull-mashing riffs. That wild rebeliious energy burns brightly throughout the album, from the aggressive tribal beats and menacing two-chord muck-punk of \"Attempted Coup : Madagascar Percussion\", the winding spiky guitar and multi-level polyrhtyms that energize \"The Ivory Coast\" as it rumbles and shakes, those sinister No Wave influences merging with that relentless syncopated drive on \"Next To Nothing\", on to the clanking industrial drone rock raga of the back-to-back \"Exodus\" and \"Machinery\" (whose pissed-off hardcore punk-style vocal delivery summons vivid visions of our slow moving apocalypse), te super-short ritual loop \"Zulu Zulu \", that crumbling mass of distortion, gnarly bass riffage, and burgeoning violence that underscores the satirical \"Real Men\". This stuff gets even more unnerving towards the end as anguished shrieks ring out over \"Flesh That Walks\"'s feral racket and cannibal manifestos. \"Kill The Fascists!\" is a pretty straightfoward junkyard symphony (recorded in the underground tunnels beneath UCLA) that speaks pretty clearly for itself, but it all drifts into oblivion when closer \"Procession\" disassembles the band's sounds into a hypnotizing haze..\n\nIt's all quite noisy and abrasive, paerticularly from the guitar, whose peformance delivers a tetanus-infected shock of slashing droning strings, burly and bass-heavy slow-motion power chord dirges, gusts of atonal skree, and some straight-up brain damaged shredding that takes me to some kind of malfunctioning nirvana state.\n\n- this is clearly the stuff that critic Robert Christgau was talking about in his old review of the album where he described Tragic as resembling \"Flipper doing Afropop originals?\".\n\nObviously fans of the more abject and twisted end of experimental sludge-punk are going to find some real meta to chew on here, if there was anything even close to a modern analogue to Savage Republic's early urban-conflict wardance it might be that Billy Bao stuff; there's no way that those guys weren't luistening to this stuff on repeat.\n\nThe other disc pulls all of the pre-Savage Republic recordings together, from when the group called themselves Africa Corps and recorded their music in UCLA area parking garages. And man, this stuff is great! Most of these tracks have never before been released; the majority of these songs were carried over onto the Savage debut (\"Attempted Coup : Madagascar\", \"When All Else Fails\", \"Real Men\", etc.), but here they sound even more immediate and cacophonic, record live together in a group frenzy, all of the heavy sludge-punk riffs even grungier and filthier here, the guitar's barbed-wire post-punk/No Wave-influenced raga-like drones and sharp biting chords and angry discordant scrapes pushed further up in the mix. There is so much clank and glass and pipe-banging mixed up with the trance-inducing drumming that it sweeps over your senses, random yelling and raging and howling in the background behind the main vocalist (momentarily reminding me of the most aggro moments from Cro-Magnon), with these general feeling of hysteria and anxiety and flailing hostility being unleashed.\n\nSome of these songs only appear here, like the fleeting junk-freakout \"The Vampire Bites \", the severely bizarre experimental tape-music spewed across \"Next To Nothing Weirdness\", and amazing ectatsic freeform explosions like \"Thee Three Preserves\" and \"Sliding Into Arabia\" with their imposing, crudely formed melodies informed by Middle Eastern scales\n\nthe eleven minute version of \"Procession (Into The Light)\" is completely mesmerizing, just an endless tribal rhythm delivered to a state of __________________\n\nand the burlier, murkier version of \"Exodus\" that whips up a spectacular drone-rock mantra\n\nI think that the \"Tragic Figures\" recordings of all of this are superior in the end, but hearing the musicians working out their ideas and attack together sounds great on this preface recording, definitely a recommended listen for fans of what the band would quickly evolve into\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Flesh That Walks\n\nSample : Machinery\n\nSample : Attempted Coup: Madagascar\n\nTOMBHAMMER Sprecher des Omnibus der Ewigkeit CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 9.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFor nearly a decade, Gregorio Franco has been a steadily rising force in the field of dark, aggressive synthesizer music, producing some of the most innovative and full-on heavy \"synth metal\" you're gonna find in the underground music scene. One of the most prominent faces in the field of what is generally referred to as darksynth, Franco has traversed similar dystopian badlands as Carpenter Brut and Perturbator. But where he deviates is the unique addition of an impenitent death metal influence; where other contemporary synth artists are often content to peddle the same 'ol pastel-hued VHS-era aesthetics and \"outrun\" sounds, Franco injects bulldozing guitar tones reminiscent of Bolt Thrower and the Swedish death metal underground, alongside an ultra heavy electro-bass attack and brutalizing rhythmic power that's directly descended from industrial metal's most violent drum programming. Franco's music feels more suited to a war zone than a dance floor, and in fact has the ability to turn one into the other. And his creative flow is endless; along with a multitude of albums and EPs that stretch back to 2013, his Bandcamp account is constantly updated with unique covers of synth-pop classics and video game soundtracks alike.\n\nUnder the Tombhammer banner, Franco now expands his sound into even deeper, heavier territory. His electronic influences are obvious, at their core consistently paying homage to the classic sounds of early John Carpenter, vintage Tangerine Dream / Klaus Schulze, and the darkest of neon-drenched 80s-era film soundtracks. But with Tombhammer, Franco further incorporates a specific side of his metal background for the project. Heavily informed by the tone and feel of Nightfall-era Candlemass, the lugubrious funeral doom of Australia's Mournful Congregation, and the peculiar blackened orchestrations and apocalyptic resonance of Urfaust circa-Verräterischer, Nichtswürdiger Geist and Geist ist Teufel, Franco's guitar work and songcraft evokes the tangled black roots of graveyard trees, the blinding glare of a nuclear-red sun at twilight, the oceanic emptiness of an uncaring omniverse, and the deepest abysses of human grief. This stuff is genuinely heart-wrenching with its cold, dark beauty and oppressive emotional depth. Somber. Sonorous. Man, these songs moved me.\n\nPairing the song \"Sprecher des Omnibus der Ewigkeit\" from the online digital demo MMXXIII with a brand-new exclusive B-side track \"Bereiche Magischen Leids\", this EP is the official debut release from the mighty Tombhammer. Together, it almost feels like part of a score to a previously unknown Panos Cosmatos film. The first, \"\"Sprecher\" (roughly translated from the German to \"Speaker of the Omnibus of Eternity\"), stretches out to the razor-thin light dying on the horizon line, immediately casting you into a sumptuous and billowing cloud of black- fluorescent synthesizer. When that riff comes in, the complimentary effect is crushing. I was in love with this as soon as it kicked in. Cinematic synth-doom? Soaring, darkly romantic doomwave? Forget all that, \"Sprecher\" simply pulverizes with a perfect blending of electronic texture and bone-smashing doom. Somewhere, some film director should be scrambling to find Franco's contact info because this is one of the best unmade film scores I've ever heard. The middle section where the cinderblock guitars die away and we are adrift in clouds of swirling ashen particulate? Gorgeous. The moment when that devastator of a riff comes flowing back in like a river of black magma? Punishing. This instrumental crush is as emotionally weighted and mournfully ethereal as the best late 80s / early 90s UK / European doom metal, and just as memorable. The B-side \"Bereiche Magischen Leids\" was recorded exclusively for this EP release, and shifts the experience more towards the electronic side of the spectrum. It is just as cyclopean in scope. Again, a curtain is dropped on an immense black void, luminous drones driving into the infinite, a menacing guitar melody uncoiling in the depths. A synth-drenched hint of Peaceville-style slow-motion dread sprawling outward, everywhere. And it builds. And builds. Attracting molten matter to the slow spinning iron core and amassing itself into a kind of ambient metal spheroid, swirling black guitar drone and eerie doom-laden melody and grinding synth all bearing down on you like the shadow of a newly birthed black sun. An amorphous elegy as counterpart to the previous trudge through majestic misery.\n\nIt rolls over you, somewhat like the darker work of Jóhann Jóhannsson, seeded with the glacial melodic style of guitarist Andrew Craighan. One hell of a debut.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Sprecher des Omnibus der Ewigkeit\n\nSample : Bereiche Magischen Leids\n\nSCATMOTHER / CHAOS CASCADE The Insignificance Of Human Life CD (Dunkelheit Produktionen) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nHERETIQUE DU NORD Shadow And Frost CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 10.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nEmerging from the chill of the Quebec winter, a cloaked and hooded entity known only as Malgeist has been busy haunting online spaces for dungeon synth, dark ambient, and doom metal with a steady stream of new music that bridges all of these sounds. While Malgeist started to craft his sinister soundscapes back in the mid-2000s, he only recently showed up with his first official recordings, all of which were released digitally. The aptly titled Shadow and Frost is the first physical release from Malgeist's Hérétique du Nord, an hour-long sprawl of eccentric oubliette-doom that's rich in atmosphere and flecked with an unusual stylistic palette. A mixture of solemn dungeon synth and cinematic strings, erratic chunks of subterranean drone-doom and moody samples, are all assembled together in an odd sound-collage style that's heavily drenched in northern gloom and an aura of wintry mystique.\n\nIt's definitely an unusual approach to \"dungeon synth\", unbeholden to any of the tenets of that style of music. All of the hallmarks of that classic dungeon-music feel are there, but the music of Shadow and Frost expands past it, stumbling through a frost-covered fever-dream of dark, droning tones, chilling soundscapes, and amorphous heaviness. These sounds bleed, blur and merge together into a quixotic mixture of classic dungeon synth and medieval melody, raw Earth 2-esque drone-metal crush turned gothic, dark ambient, folk music, noise, and field recordings, sometimes melting into one another, at others appearing via jagged editing and sequencing that accentuates the album's hallucinatory allure. While these strange passages of haunting subterranean crypt-synth, funereal violins, billowing ambient doom-drone, and eerie choral chant wind and weave through these eleven tracks, Hérétique du Nord's further augments its sound with brief fragments of ancient and obscure horror-film dialogue, adding to the overall uncanny vibe that permeates this stuff. From the cold organ-like drones of opener \"La Traversée des Ailes Noires\", Malgeist clearly revels in the feel of the iconic faux-orchestral sounds of early \"Era 1\" Mortiis, Equitant \"The Circle of Agurak\", and (obviously) Burzum circa Hliðskjálf , but moves further afield into eerie cinematic string sections, luminous keyboard dirges, washes of lo-fi electronic buzz, then plummeting into mesmeric, monstrous doom riffs that hover over cloudscapes of shimmering chthonic drift and deep wells of Lustmordian ambience. Clanking metallic harpsichord and doomed electronics combine on tracks like \"Scarlet And Crimson\", while tribal rhythms surge over the beginning of \"Rituel des Quatre Périls\" before opening a muffled cacophony of wintry wind and distant chant-like sounds. There's a couple of organ motifs that keep popping up throughout the album, but each song keeps turning this into unexpected directions, like when the album delves into its awesome passages of cavernous, guttural, crumbling doom riffs in \"Ashes of the Final Bastion\" and \"Shattered Glaive of the Emerald Priestess\", or the gorgeous violins and staccato strings of the title track that evoke the spirit of Bernard Herrmann staggering through a total white-out winter storm. Like I said, this is pretty wild.\n\nThis stuff ends up feeling sort of like an inadvertent distant cousin to the creepier ends of Nurse With Wound's surrealist sound-fuckery, mingling with an ethereal haze of neoclassical dark wave a la In The Nursery and Arcana alongside elements lifted from the moody early horror film scores and crude, blackened doom metal dirge. Definitely works best as a single unbroken piece, which is why I wanted to put this out on audio cassette, where Hérétique du Nord's singular mixture can properly sit within the saturated sound of magnetized tape. Shadow is a weird trip, constantly maintaining a frigid, freezing atmosphere as it creeps and crawls through its strange chambers of Grand Guignol drama and menacing instrumentation.\n\nFeatures an original sleeve design from Spiritvs of Neige et Noirceur / Ossements.\n\nRUDIMENTARY PENI Death Church (2022 Remaster) CASSETTE (Sealed Records) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNew (2022) remastered reissue of the classic deathrock debut Death Church, presented in jewel case CD, cassette, and on vinyl in big foldout poster sleeve. Here's my write-up, slightly edited, of the previous Outer Himalayan edition :\n\nThis classic slab of macabre Lovecraftian avant-punk is available again, remastered from the original tapes. Like the other recent Peni reissues, this is essential for anyone into dark, macabre punk, early death-rock, and occult-obsessed hardcore.\n\nIt would be very hard to overstate just how influential these albums have been on an entire class of bands that followed in their wake, and you can now hear echoes of Rudimentary Peni's spiky, angular punk and bubbling madness lingering on albums from all kinds of hardcore punk, avant-rock and even black metal bands. They have always been grouped in with the early 80's anarcho-punk scene that flourished in Britain, but aside from their early connections with the band Crass (having released their 1982 Farce 7\" on Crass Records), Rudimentary Peni had very little in common both musically and thematically with most of the other punk bands that they were associated with. Their music was so much darker and more enigmatic than almost anything else happening in British punk at the time, with much of the unique sound and vibe coming from front-man Nick Blinko, a visionary lyricist and artist who has struggled with mental illness and long periods of hospitalization throughout the bands entire career, and who brought his increasingly deranged visions of disturbing deformed characters, rampant paranoia, and withered horrors to the bands music, drawing influence from the works of H.P Lovecraft and the occult. For fans of dark, outre punk rock, the Rudimentary Peni records are absolutely essential; all three of the band's albums are crucial slabs of twisted, menacing rock, and even their EPs are minor masterpieces of macabre weirdness. They've never put out a bad record, and I actually think that their more recent stuff, while heavier and different from their classic early records, is just as amazing as their earliest, most legendary recordings. All are classic albums of malevolent weirdo punk, presented with complete lyrics and lots of Blinko's amazing obsessive pen-and-ink artwork.\n\nLike I've mentioned at length in my write-ups of the reissues of Archaic, Cacophony and Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric, Rudimentary Peni are one of my all time favorite bands from the 80's British punk underground, a band that was often associated with the UK anarcho-punk scene but who was in fact off on some weird cosmic-horror-tinged death-rock trip that was totally unlike anything else going on at the time. The band's debut album Death Church was wholly unique when it came out in '83, from front man Nick Blinko's nightmarish, obsessively detailed black and white album art to the bizarre song writing and morbid atmosphere that hangs over the bands music. The macabre pogo power of the opening song introduces Death Church's relentless buzzsaw punk assault, leading the charge for these twenty-one tracks of ripping rocking mid-tempo angular deathpunk, the songs comprised of simple four-chord riffs twisted into sinister angular hooks, the bass guitar bouncing like Peter Hook on cheap crank, Blinko's howling vocals the closest he ever came to a traditional hardcore-style delivery. The whole album has its gnarled and blackened roots digging deep into the rotting carcass of early 80s hardcore, but this ended up sounding unlike anything else in punk at the time thanks to Blinko's demented lyrical visions and bizarre artwork and the band's ferocious, pounding hypnotic buzzbomb punk. On some of these songs, the band even reveals a weird sort of proto-black metal sound on tracks like \"Poppycock\", with its furious tremolo picking and speedy assault; for fans of the current wave of blackened punk outfits like Malveillance, Bone Awl and the like, there are moments on Death Church that could possibly provide an epiphany. That signature strain of Peni weirdness abounds, of course, with some of their punk-shanty stuff showing up on other tracks like \"Vampire State Building\" and the sepulchral shimmy of \"Flesh Crucifix\", all infested with bizarre squealing cries and the dank stink of the tomb. Can't recommend this album enough.\n\nDEATH FACTORY Artifact Events CASSETTE (No Sides) 9.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nRightously lobe-melting 2022 full-length of psychotronic electro-gargle that came out on the longrunning No Sides imprint, whose head William Sides also appears within this newer duo-setup for Death Factory. This outfit is an institution in the Chicago avant-noise underground, hammering it out for more than thirty-five years now. With Sides beside him, DF's main noisemaker Michael Krause dives right back into the vat of dark industrial, oily electronic noise, and crazed psych-synth mayhem that the Factory has been churning out for decades now. The image of these two smartly-dressed gentlemen on the cover of Artifact Events might lead you to think this is a moer \"academic\" style foray into experimental electronics, but this seventy-minute maelstrom is straight chaos. Not quite as gnarled as the Invisible Agressor tape I did with Death Factory nearly a decade ago, but still tough stuff.\n\nGettin' some supreme creep here. Artifact starts off slow and shadowy, languid over-modulated drones rising and falling in swells over a super-minimal bass melody; this fourteen minute meditation piece \"Hymn For Ruination\" comes from the same kind of suppressed nightmare circuity that birthed that Invisible Aggressor I put out through C-Blast. A wall of soft, pulsating fuzz and electrical hum surrounds the vague musical gestures and barely-formed figures riding those billowy shadows, this epic death-drone gradually increasing in mass and density as it continues to unfurl. Killer. I love the far-off minor key laments that surface here and there, resembling stray bits of funereal organ trying to make their way past the omniprerxent voltage hum. Heavier chordal textures materialize, these deep, slowly roiling fragments of sorrowful music shrouded in all of that hiss and buzz and warping sinewave movements. A kind of damaged funeral-drone. The sound just throbs out of my speakers.\n\nThat placid murkscape is then shredded to fuckin' pieces by the ghastly harsh electronics of \"Shellshock Mantra\", insane whooping cries impossibly tangled in screeching, fluctuating feedback, bizarre synth gibberish, peals of tortured twisted metal, weird horn-like bleats over a rumbling sub-strata of distored bass churn; a total destructive anxiety attack in league with Pain Jerk or the really violent C.C.C.C. stuff, melting down into a crushing wave of psychedelic chaos. \"Statues\" is likewise a total skull-shred, high-pitched electronic feedback and tone abuse whipping around hard metallic drones and looped mechanical rumble. This tape just keeps flying further into total pandemonium, trippy and terrifying as these often fifteen-minute plus pieces come screaming in across the smoking ruins of the previous track, spaced-out synthesizer agonies being stacked one upon the other, that whipstrike sinewave fuckery leaving deep, bloody gashes in your flesh. So much abusive modulation of signals, reaching heights of heaviness I did not expect.\n\n\"Afterglow\" returns to a semblance of that original state of pulsing grace: multiple rhythmic loops trip and stumble over each other as more feedback-generated anti-melodies take shape and writhe in the air before you. What sounds like a destroyed Moog synth starts swirling around the dundering beat-loops, evoking the scraps of some yesteryear psych-rock band being pulled like carrion strips from its crumbling skeletal frame - this is definitely one of my favorite parts of Artifact Events , this extended mantra of heavily mutated rock keyboards, like shredded ectoplasm from Hawkwind, or Gong, or maybe The 13th Floor Elevators, adhering to mesmerizing Merzbowian loops. Loops, loops, loops. Loops of acid synth, loops of found sound, loops of backwards drums carved into an ill off-kilter shuffle. Yeah, this is Death Factory at its most scouring, unleashing these lysergic effects-pedal seizures and howling drones with no regard for space or form; ruthless and blown-out psychedelic sadism. Has it all been building to this? Does the twenty-minute closer \"Mount Cyanide\" continue to chase this state of charred, wilting bliss? You bet it does. One final flight into volcanic electro-madness, the heaving breathing of some monstrous thing crawling up into a dementia of circuit-bent skree, cranked feedback and mangled sinewave, becoming a shadow of an air-raid siren while rapid blips and whirring machinery and looping , elliptical rhythms take shape once again, driving it all headfirst into a new blossoming colossus of sonic tribulation.\n\nI've made a note to have this on hand te next time I go for the \"heroic dose\". God knows where I'll end up. Probably shrunken, dried, and curled in a corner of my own cratered skull.\n\nJoin me.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Hymn For Ruination\n\nSample : Statutes\n\nSample : Mount Cyanide\n\nMANSON, CHARLES Walking In The Truth LP (TPOS) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nIGNIVOMOUS Hieroglossia LP (Nuclear War Now! Productions) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nPsychotic death chaos. This is what exudes from 2019's Hieroglossia, the third full-length album from this Australian band. It's actually been awhile (seven years) since these beasts destroyed me with their last one , Contragenesis, and their nihilistic, violently expressive energy remains as enveloping as it ever has. Ignivomous has been one of my favorite Aussie death metal bands for awhile, shaking off that now-pejorative \"cavernous\" cliche that has dogged so many of the bands from that region over the past fifteen years; these guys are clearly moved by the iconic Incantation-style of death metal that exists in the tangledd root-system of most of the Melbourne-area death metal scene, but just like most of their peers, Ignivomous push that aesthetic out into stranger, more nebulous fields of ectoplasm-smeared weirdness. Hell yeah.\n\nA rush of crushing, repetitious-but-hypnotic riffing blows in from some sulfuric source, the music beginning its continuous progression from those catchy, grinding deeath mertal riffs into more off-kilter, more technical guitar structures, blurs of droning single-chord noise, the rhythm section sinuously shifting from powerful tempo changes to gonked-out breakdowns to angularized grooves with sharp edges. Starting with the title track, each song unfurls into a crazed riff-collage, putrescent guttural roars echoing and stretching over and through the roiling violence. Getting deeper into Hieroglossia reveals what seems like a newfound predeliction for more bizarre guitar textures and riff assemblage, sudden dropouts into these almost synthlike dirges. When the drummer lets 'er rip and goes nuclear with the blastbeats, the songs like \"Circle of Scythes\" and \"Cloaked in Resplendent Perdition\" can begin to blur into an almost impenetrable wall of noise; these moments are constrained for a portion of the album, releasing total chaotic destruction at the peak of these gonzo complex melodies and skronky riffs. It never gets into Gorgutsian levels of confusional craziness, but this is definitely a more experiemntal and expansive album than the flesheating murkstorms of the previous album Contragenesis. Which, naturally, has me droolin'all over it. Fans of more conventional death metal might get irked over the increasingly whacked-out song structures and eccentric riff sequences - there are more than a few moments on the albbum where the songs seem to lead, uh, nowhere, these really offbeat formations and non-sequiters that challenge anything along the lines of \"traditional\" death metal songcraft. which makes it a difficult listen in someways, even when the more flowing leads and lumbering, doom-laden grooves kick in. And the guitar solos reach some absurd heigjhts of intensity, complexity, and dissonance, not to mention being slimed all over these eight songs.\n\nHonestly, I think Contragenesis is still my favorite album from the band so far, but the thorny insanity that Ignivomous delivere here is pretty undeniable. Some of the highlights for me included the razor-cyclone chaos of \"Shackles of the Demiurge \" and its wild lattice-work of hyperfast alien lead lines; the comparatively more straightforward pummelling that \"Thalassophobia \" delivers, while the drumming is relentless from beginning to end. \"Blood & Mercury\" evokes some of the alchemical imagery of previous work while clobbering you with what feels like you are listening to two copies of Onward To Golgatha, one playing forward, the other in reverse. \"Gaunt Redemption Parasite\" slips into an almost funereal doom-death crawl laced with stirring mournful leads and shifting rhythmic churn, then closes with a mysterious spoken word passage. And closer \"Vitriolic Swarm \" is the ultimate berserker eruption, blendin that blasting inchoate chaos and spine-snapping tempo/riff changes and confusiona time signnature and puzzling chord progressions all into one buzzing nightmare of outre death metal horror.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Hieroglossia\n\nSample : Cloaked In Resplendent Perdition\n\nSample : Vitriolic Swarm\n\nSLOGUN Days Of Agony CD (Bloodlust!) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFUCKED UP Live At Third Man Records LP (Third Man Records) 14.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Year Of The Rat\n\nSample : California Cold\n\nSample : Year Of The Ox\n\nBARONESS First/Second LP (Hyperrealist Records) 23.98\n\nFirst/Second IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nOnce again back in stock, on black vinyl - here's the old review from previous editions:\n\nThe early EP releases from Baroness have gone in and out of print over the years on different formats, and are once again available on vinyl through the folks at Hyperrealist, this time as a single limited-edition full length Lp that collects both the band's First and Second Eps remixed and remastered and presented in a gatefold package with all of John Baizley's awesome artwork, foil stamped lettering on the cover, and a printed inner sleeve.\n\nMonstrously epic sounding, thunderous sludge riffs and skillful dual-guitar harmonies come together with ripping d-beat hardcore aggression. Sort of like His Hero Is Gone busting out Fucking Champs-style harmonies? Although these songs all sound pretty apocalyptic, there is a great sense of melody throughout this CD - this stuff is really quite pretty and catchy at times.\"Tower Falls\" has got some awesome anthemic breakdowns and harmonies.\"Coeur\" is the shortest track at just over three minutes, yet still packs in killer memorable riffs and harmonies and odd (but awesome) riffs and chord phrasings. The final track,\"Rise\", is a monster, starting off with atmospheric finger tapping that stretches for several minutes before turning into a bulldozing sludge dirge . Awesome.\n\nOn on Second: The second EP from Baroness delivers more of their righteous and majestic post-crust-metal that we loved so much from their First CD, with technical instrumentals, lengthy psychedelia, and moody RODAN / JUNE OF 44 post-rock interjected with awesome Maidenesque / Fucking Champs-level guitar harmonies and crushing tech / sludge / crustcore. Super powerful, and Second also does a good job of capturing the band�s live energy. Killer stuff, BARONESS just keeps getting better and better with each release. And as with their first release, this disc has three songs, clocking in at around 21 minutes. Highly recommended to fans of Isis and Pelican, Disrupt and Neurosis, psychedelic crust, punishingly heavy metallic post-rock, stretched-out tarpit sludge, odd meters and complex arrangements and triumphant metal hooks.\n\nBLACK SAND DESERT Black Sand Desert 2 x CD (Phage Tapes) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nLULL That Space Somewhere CD (Cold Spring) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise to have this new Lull album pop up at the end of last year - like the label states, this is the first brand new album from Mick Harris's dark ambient project in fourteen years, long enough that I really didn't expect him to revisit the ice-cold stygian dronefields that he helped to trailblaze in the early 90s alongside Lustmord and Yen Pox. Lull has always been one of my all-time favorite dark ambient outfits, Harris just seems to have this spectacular touch for weaving impossibly deep webs of subterranean murmur and barren volcanic drift that stands out from anyone else in the field. Definitely muich more than just \"that electronic side-project from the former Napalm Death drummer\" to me.\n\nCovid-era sessions\n\nImpressionistic driftscapes that evoke oceanic vastness, an immense and empty terrain cast with an ominous, crepescular glow, somewhere on the razor's edge between twilight and nightfall. Fields of immensely ancient ice sprawling all the way to the horizon, the dim, fading solar glow rising over that distant flatline horizon, vaporous clouds of freezing air and condensation swirling upwards into the troposphere. A single, blinding beam of light shoots straight down into the ice-fields, stretching skyward from the surface like a lunar ray that ascends to the point of invisibility. Borealis-like smears of lightform shifting imperceptibly beyond the vanishing point. The pieces, titled \"Range\", \"Expanse\", \"Unplumbed\", \"Way\" feel like a fractured phrase, each one stretching from eleven to seventeen minutes and flowing together like a black haze of sound. Pieces of something approaching sonority slip beneath the surface of these glacial sheets of sound, bleeding into each other, blurring and melting together.\n\nMake sure you've got a good system for low-frequency playback. For an hour, Harris draws the listener through a boundless sonic environment, the drones and rumblings and reverberations and echoes moving constantly in all directions, washing over you again and anagin with huge swells of deep bass tones and lush chordal forms, spires of majestic tonality piercing through the gloom and shadow and casting a luminous glow across the billowing, gamboling cloudscapes, awe-inspiring choral textures rising out of unseeable depths. This is unmistakeably Lull, scultping vast and ominous sound into dramatic movements that completely surround you, quite different from the other early \"dark ambient\" and \"isolationist\" artists; Harris utilizes his layering of low-frequency / low-end soundscapes to create something almost symphonic, opener \"Range\" being a perfect specimen of this approach as the track unfurls into something akin to a cosmic event, with peaks and valleys of intensely cinematic magnitude arrayed into deeply moving formations. Aside from having an extremely subtle rhythmic substratum in his dronescapes, Harris and Lull usually brings a meditative element to this music that distinguishes it in the field, with series of forms and patterned movements that reveal themselves to the attentive listener, especially on the first two tracks of That Space Somewhere, \"Range\" and \"Expanse\". As the album moves into its second half, though, it feels more meteorological, those giant tectonic tones and reverberations giving way to a slightly more etheric sprawl of endless shimmer and metallic whirlpools. \"Unplumbed\" and \"Way\" develop into slightly more harrowing topographies, less physically visercal tjhan the begining of the album but no less immersive and evocative. Like waves of tone emitting from planetary-sized prayer bowls, rippling through the cosmos.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Way\n\nSample : Expanse\n\nSample : Range\n\nMURDEROUS VISION Ghosts Of The Soul Long Lost: Volume Two 2 x CD (Live Bait) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nOne of Murderous Vision's series of massive multi-disc compilations of rare material, Volume Two focuses on music recorded around the early 2000s with a combination of short-run CDR releases and never-before-released music; if you're getting heavy into this Ohio outfit's body of work, these compilations are crucial. One of the pre-eminent US purveyors of death industrial , Murderous Vision is actually a pretty varied project, with excursions into weirder tonal territory than your typical Cold Meat Industries release - this stuff can turn straight-up psychedelic on a dime, while still maintaining that grim, apocalyptic radiance. I'm a big fan of this stuff.\n\nThe entire first disc is an unreleased Murderous Vision album that was recorded from 2006 to 2008; produced around the same time as the Lifes Blood Death's Embrace album, this twelve-song collection, titled Cathartic Drifts In A Sea Of Sadness, lays on the same kind of grim and sprawling darkness that album focused on. Fusing together qualitieies of classic early dark ambient, vague neo-classical elements, late-80's \"ritual ambient\", morbid Cold Meat Industries-style death industrial, and various occult imagery, Drifts is dense stuff. The symphonic synths of opener \"In Hell We Will Burn...Together\" conjure a very similiar vibe to the more \"orchestral\"-sounding dungeon synth that was appearing in the 2000s, but then mixes in commanding spoken-word vocals, ceremonial percussion and thunderous, almost militant tribal drumming with a rich acoustic presence, and creepy stabs of staccato strings. When \"Upon Both Flesh And Soil \" picks up from there, Petrus ascends into an even more cinematic scope as subtle, sublime Berlin School-style synths drift alongside mysterious voice transmissions, melting electronic signals, and faint but noticeable clouds of crackle and buzz.\n\nIt's dark, dark stuff, with those offbeat sudden turns into melodramatic blackened industrial that sounds like some alien wargoat reciting from ancient texts amid colossal blasts of huge, distant percussive rumble, looped Satanic strings, and pulsating, tumor-like rhythms; man, I absolutely love this era of Murderous Vision, his weird riff on European death industrial felt like it was suffused with whatever the hell was infecting the water and soil in northern Ohio. Like I've mentioned elsewhere, the vast bulk of the Cathartic Drifts material feels akin to a meeting point of Brighter Death Now, Kerovnian's black ambient, and the druggy ritual industrial sounds of groups like Psychonaut 75, Zero Kama , Herbst9 and Sigillum S, so there's definitely much to offer here if you're inclined to that sort of music. Oh and it grows stranger by the moment, oddly hopeful synth-murk smeared in filmic orchestrated blur whirling around troubling film samples of acts of violence and depravation, opening into rich fields of multi-layered electronic ambience, brief moments that feel like they could have seeped into this from a rain-damaged cassette copy of Tangerine Dream's score to The Keep, more pummeling kettledrum-esque rumble and ghostly clacking underscored with huge swathes of grinding sub-surface vibration, long sprawls of perverted religious musical forms, amorphous sinister driftscapes and heavy, rhythmic zoned-out trance states , monstrous chanting choirs and swells of mesmeric Teutonic synthesizers (like on the killer \"Structures And Pathways\" that sounds like Tangerine Dream held hostage by members of Les Legions Noires) , endlessly grinding stone and stygian throb of inhuman machinery, those drums and other percussion surfacing constantly throughout the seventy-minute-plus albumin all manner of forms to propel you further and further into the album's strange and often psychotropic interior abyss, but finding onesself standing amid emotional desolation with a haunting coda of acoustic strum and twang, keys, and layered voices that has a straight-out Swans feel to it.\n\nIf I'm ever wandering therough a skull-lined catacomb system on LSD, I'd want to have this \"lost\" album pouring into my ears. It's one of the coolest \"unreleased albums\" that I've heard.\n\nWe move to the second disc, where you get a mixture of out-of-print Live Bait CDR releases such as the 2009 Frozen In Morphia disc and a privately-issued 3\" disc, capped off with another unreleased track, this one from 2006. Still trawling the abyss, beautifully so, but with some more unexpected and experimental forays into rhythmic structure. The eight-song Morphia (directly influenced by Aleistar Crowley's Diary Of A Drug Fiend) materializes in a thick fog of geo-physic subduction tremors, active drumming that veers from tribal ritual vibe to martial intensity and focus, more male and female voices emerging over spooky piano and spectral string sections, spoken word incantations and morbid poetics drifting over swirling noctural ambience. It's more collaborative than other MV releases from that era, and goes into some interesting directions. Almost every single track here gives itself over to some new drumming pattern, often fully present and up front in the mix as slow hypnotic beats rumble beneath smears of dreary synth, folky strum and intricately fingerpicked melody, again hinting at that bleak psychedelia that Petrus really started to get into towards the latter half of the decade. Of course, that gloomy title track is followed by the smoldering death industrioal of \"Through The Motes Of Dust \" and the sickening morgue-drone of \"Clawmarks In The Muck \" that pull you back down into stinking, sulfuric machine fumes and daemonic muttering, so the atmopshere on Morphia is, well, fairly amorphous. And then there's \"Secular Assault \" that comes out of nowhere as a full band emerges with this killer industrial dirge-metal assault, massively distorted riffs and slithering bass and slow motion earthmover drumming, monstrous seething screams buried in distortion; with weird dubby elements to the echoing snare and walking basslines, this one threw me for a loop, part Winter-esque deathsludge, part dub-infected delusion, part early Swans-style repetitious assault. I can't think of anywhere else in the Murderous Vision discography where he suddenly went full-on freakazoid scum-sludge like this, but it rules. It's a solid, offbeat, totally overlooked album from Murderous Vision, that closes with a nearly twenty-minute live performance of what sounds like a witch's sabbat . The last two tracks are similairy intriguing artifacts, the meandering piano that drives the neo-classical ritualism on \"Seas\", insane black metal-esque shrieks lurking in the depths and bearing witness to blinding blasts of kosmiche electronics into the upper atmopshere, while the unreleased \"Collective Murder\" draws its curtains down around some terrific orchestral dark ambience.\n\nWORMED Exodromos (BLUE VINYL) LP (Willowtip) 24.99\n\nExodromos (BLUE VINYL) IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nNow available on vinyl.\n\nAvant-garde psychedelic sci-fi slam-death? One of the few contemporary bands to come out of the \"brutal\" death metal underground that I've found to be at all worthwhile, Spain's Wormed have been offering a very strange, ultra-complex sound for over a decade now; although they've had a couple of crushing EPs come out over the past decade (like 2010's batshit insane Quasineutrality and a three-way split with Goratory and Vomit Remnants) and have made some notable appearances at extreme metal festivals like Maryland Deathfest, this is actually the first new album from Wormed in ten years, and sees the band pushing their sound into even more dizzying extremes of complexity and heaviness. They take the slamming, bone-crushing power of that whole Suffocation / Devourment / Cryptopsy end of the death metal spectrum and blasts it through a stargate, creating a vicious strain of mutant death metal woven from quantum physics hallucinations and eldritch alien horrors vomiting out of deep-space wormholes. On the band's long-awaited second album Exodromos, Wormed's vicious angular metallic crunch is further slathered in electronic textures and glitchy ambience and fused to confusing, near incomprehensible time signatures, and fronted by a singer who shifts between bestial pig-grunt vocals and an utterly bizarre, seemingly pitch-shifted gurgle that gives one the impression that you are, in all actuality, listening to the vocalizations of a giant insect. All of that would make this stuff weird enough, and put it right up my sci-fi metal lovin' alley, but Wormed take these concepts and musical complexity into such extremes that it manages to transcend the brutal death metal sound and becomes something much more outre.\n\nA bizarre concept album about the last surviving human being left in the wake of a universe-collapsing wormhole, this is some of the most complex, mind-melting death metal I've heard since the new Gorguts album. The songs on Exodromos spiral out into seemingly endless riff-whirlwinds, the blenderized rhythms and discordant riffing welded together with a malicious, reptilian intent, each song riddled with sudden and violently jarring tempo and time signature changes, the riffs as fucked-up and atonal as anything off of Gorguts's no wave-damaged death metal classic Obscura. But Wormed are just as skilled at suddenly dropping into a bone-crushing groove that feels like the sound of that Hadron Collidor starting to warm up, or slip into a vicious, stuttering, twisted math-metal workout. The drumming on this album is fucking mind-blowing, super technical and precise, virtuosic even, often lurching into sickening stop/start arrangements, guiding Wormed's churning deep-space chaos out of the angular, ultra-blasting progdeath and into some killer classic metal riffage or sweeping melodic guitars that offer a striking contrast with the jagged discordant blast. The album is littered with tracks like \"Solar Neutrinos\", which combines creepy spoken word passage and looping guitar ambience with weird synthesizer effects, an interlude amid the crushing mechanized death metal, and there are several short electronic noisescapes that start and end various tracks. On \"Multivectorial Reionization\", they detonate some robotic Meshuggah-esque deathchug that's so heavy that it'll rumble the walls of your stomach, and \"Spacetime Ekleipsis Vorticity\" slips into breathless torrents of cyborg-calliope fretboard insanity. More of that crazed prog-shred shows up on \"Stellar Depopulation\", and some of those rapid-fire tremolo picked melodies have a staccato feel that sort of reminds me of some of Mick Barr's (Orthrelm) stuff, like on the majestic closer \"Xenoverse Discharger\". These guys have turned into one of the most interesting tech-death bands out there, blending their downtuned bone-rattling extremity with epic kosmische electronics and the result sounds like nothing else. Exodromos comes highly recommended to fans of everything from latter-day Gorguts to Ulcerate and the sci-fi death metal of Nocturnus, Demilich and Timeghoul.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : WORMED-Exodromos (BLUE VINYL)\n\nSample : WORMED-Exodromos (BLUE VINYL)\n\nSample : WORMED-Exodromos (BLUE VINYL)\n\nGRIEF Depression 12\" (Fuck Yoga) 18.98\n\nDepression IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nGEROGERIGEGEGE, THE Senzuri Fight Back 7\" VINYL (Turbine Industries) 12.99\n\nSenzuri Fight Back IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nCELTIC FROST Danse Macabre 5 x CD + BOOK BOXSET (Noise) 89.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCONTROLLED BLEEDING Distress Signals I 2 x LP (Artoffact Records) 40.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFUOCO FATUO The Viper Slithers In The Ashes Of What Remains CASSETTE (Caligari) 5.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFULL OF HELL + MERZBOW Sister Fawn LP (A389 Records) 19.99\n\nSister Fawn IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nThat second disc that appeared with the skull-shredding collaboration between Baltimore grindbeasts Full Of Hell and Japanese noise legend Merzbow has finally made its way to vinyl. That double disc album that originally came out on Profound Lore was one of the fiercest fusions of extreme electronic noise and metallic chaos to come out that year; the Sister Fawn recording that followed the album proper was an interesting shift in sound, transforming the frenzied grindcore into something much more abstract.\n\nWhile the Sister Fawn disc was initially presented as something more of a companion piece, it actually holds up wuite nicely as an album all on its own. In fact, I gotta admit I thought this material is even cooler than the first half of their collaboration. Over the course of these five tracks, much of Full Of Hell's screeching grindmetal becomes absorbed into a cacophonous wall of industrial violence, their metallic aggression subsumed into Merzbow's swirling, screeching nebula. The tracks are longer, venturing into pummeling industrial junk-metal rhythms and howling feedback manipulation, blasts of crushing power electronics and more of that abject Swans-esque dirge that appeared on the first half. And squalls of apocalyptic jazz-infected noise erupt across tracks like \"Crumbling Ore\", delivering an acrid blast of sound that approaches Borbetomagus-like levels of intensity. The grindcore elements are still in here though, particularly on songs like the noise-damaged blast-assault of \"Merzdrone\" that welds a seemingly endless blastbeat to Merzbow's scorching electronics and shrill skulldrill distortion. The result is ferociously and psychedelic.\n\nIssued in a one-time pressing of one thousand copies on black vinyl.\n\nSIMONETTI, CLAUDIO Opera (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) LP (Rustblade) 44.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nWINDHAND self-titled (2023 REISSUE - VIOLET EDITION) 2 x LP (Relapse) 28.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nRelapse recently reissued this 2011 masterwork of psychedelic doom, originally out from Forcefield Records. But this revamped 2023 edition of Windhand's dreamy graveyard crawl has undergone a major overhaul, virtually to the point where it's a different release. I listened to my original Forcefield CD and compared it to this, and the re-mastering by the legendary Jack Endino has transformed the sound immensely - it has this huge cavernous depth that's really noticeable to me. I still love the withered, roughened spookiness of the original release, but this one is packing some considerable extra power. Not only that, but both the new CD and vinyl editions of Windhand's eponymous debut feature more than half an hour of bonus material that'll feed the fix for any hardcore Windhand fanatics. And this also features brand new artwork from the masterful Arik Roper, which enfolds the album in an even more ghoulish visual atmosphere.\n\nHere's my original take (lightly edited) on the five-song album proper (\"Black Candles\", \"Libusen\", \"Heap Wolves\", \"Summon The Moon\", \"Winter Sun\"):\n\nSo, here's where it all started for this remarkably popular doom metal outfit from Richmond, VA. It's easy to see what it is that caught everyone's ear with these folks, though, as Windhand skillfully capture the spirit of classic American doom metal while producing some really well-written songs with real staying power. And of course the presence of lead singer Dorthia Cottrell is a large p"
