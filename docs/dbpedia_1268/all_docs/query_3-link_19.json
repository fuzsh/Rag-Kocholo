Stay tuned!\n\nHere's a quick rundown of most of the other new releases and re-stocks that are on this week's new arrivals list:\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nAs always, that's just the beginning. There's much more mutant heavy music and misanthropic art to be found on our shelves and in our bins...keep reading below to check out all of the strange and extreme new music, film, and art that's included in this week's new arrivals list.\n\nYou can now click on the cover image for any title that we carry here at Crucial Blast to see a pop-up photograph of the actual item! Not all of our older titles that we have in stock have product photographs attached to them, but almost anything new that we get in stock will have this feature.

And it's in that latter territory that we find the debut EP from Snares Of Sixes, his latest creation. On the band's debut EP Yeast Mother: An Electroacoustic Mass, Snares Of Sixes makes a bold and confounding introduction, tangling the listener in confusional, highly aggressive avant-prog. The genre-shredding sound taps into a warped confluence of frenzied King Crimson-esque progressive rock, faint traces of frayed, heavily mutated black metal, haunting atmospheric touches, and abrasive electronics, and the result leaves us deliriously disoriented.\n\nWith tracks like \"Urine Hive\", \"Lions To Leeches\", \"The Mother's Throat\", Walton and company lurch through an escalating, ever-shifting frenzy of creepy, labyrinthine melody and pummeling percussive chaos, over-modulated riffage and schizophrenic time signatures, where android mutterings give way to hideous blackened shrieks and bouts of bizarre crooning, the sound stitched with veins of crushing metallic heaviosity, fractured electronica, and surreal atmopsherics as it reaches towards the menacing glitched-out tech-metal hallucination of \"Retroperistalsis\" that closes the EP.\n\nOften difficult, frequently nightmarish, this stuff easily ranks as one of Walton's more challenging and oblique offerings. And for us, one of his most fascinating. Features Marius Sjøli and Robert Hunter (Hollow Branches), Andy Winter (Winds), Pete Lee (Lawnmower Deth), Nathanaël Larochette (Musk Ox), and Don Anderson (Agalloch, Sculptured), among others.\n\nComes in a six-panel digipak.\n\nCYBER-PSYCHOS A.O.D.

Like the 2016 RRRecycled Music Series tape from Ames Sanglante, the harsh noise alter-ego of Quebecois artist Pierre-Marc Tremblay, that gutter-savant notorious for his legion of different, unique projects, bands, and endeavors that include Akitsa, Vilains Bonshommes, Departure Chandelier, Venusberg Cardinal, Contrepoison, Outre-Tombe, and running the Tour De Garde label. Ames Sanglantes is one of his oldest projects; with releases stretching all the way back to 1998. The project name roughly translates to \"Bloody Souls\", in keeping with the general macabre theme that catalyzes his musical expressions, and the sound of Ames Sanglantes has evolved a bit over the course of the project's nearly twenty-five year existence. On this Recycled tape (released in 2016, I believe), Tremblay's untitled noise excursions travel over a varied but rough topography that stretches out for a bit over half an hour, starting off with restraint but leading you into a crushing harsh noisescape by the end.\n\nSpecks of sharp, pointillist feedback emerge from a lo-fidelity haze of tape hiss, settling into a steady sinewave whine right before a sub-surface whirl of distant skree, mysterious subterranean flutter and quick bursts of bitcrushed noise starts to take over on the A-side. It is abrasive but pulled-back, allowing for the subtle interplay of Tremblay's feedback machinations with that muted and distant oceanic rumble to spread out multi-directionally. More blips of crushed glitch appear briefly, while that chthonic reverberation slides into a kind of pulsating rhythm. This hovers in a similar void-field as the monotonous, pungent industrial minimalism of Zone Nord and Davide Tozzoli's work under the N. banner. There's a strange semi-organic presence within the muffled, caustic dronescape that really becomes apparent when that tranquil static starts heaving and throbbing beneath the shrill tone-streams and it all starts to feel like you are holding a closed container of writhing grubs up to your ear. In part, meditative, but also a little bit ghastly as it all slowly takes the form of a seething chitinous mass of insectile chaos. Chattering, clattering movements bursts from the slow shifting murk, those 8-bit electronic noises bursting onto the scene like some malevolent Morse code transmission. But when it switches over to the b-side, take cover: those sounds are suddenly and monstrously amplified, erupting into a cacophonic throb with the distortion pushed into the deep red, frying out the signals and bathing everything in a massive level of crunch. All of the mid-range is scooped out, leaving a bass-heavy mass of over-modulated rumble and hiss. All quite cathartic, of course, and heavy on detail as is the norm with Âmes Sanglantes recordings. Tremblay was obviously taking inspiration from some of the U.S. titans of extreme psychedelic primitivist noise a la Macronympha and Richard Ramirez circa-Nature's Afterbirth / Bleeding Headwound.\n\nAs with all of RRRecords' Recycled Music Series, this material is recorded over a pop/rock cassette, with hand-scrawled titles on the duct-taped cassette and cover.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Recycled (1)\n\nSample : Recycled (2)\n\nSample : Recycled (3)\n\nFUDGE TUNNEL In A Word CASSETTE (Earache) 8.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAMANO, MASAMICHI Urotsukidoji II: Legend Of The Demon Womb 2 x LP (Tiger Lab) 32.00\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Urotsukidoji II OST - Kohouki / Sky Rape\n\nSample : Urotsukidoji II OST - Experiment in 1944 - Vrill Society HQ\n\nSample : Urotsukidoji II OST - Battle Atop the Roofs of Shinjuku\n\nTHIEVING BASTARDZZZ Complete Musical Disasters 7\" VINYL (SPHC) 6.50\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThis 7\" is a blast. Crude sleeve art and a terribly xeroxed insert sheet made me think I was getting another megadose of the total noisecore that SPHC has been battering me with lately, but this sixteen-song EP comes at you from a different direction: these goons out of Manchester, England play a brand of hardcore punk I don't hear too often anymore, a completely brain-damaged , glue-huffing gutter thrash that is weird as fuck. The songs veer from sloppy, discombobulated mid-tempo hardcore to hyperspeed, even borderline noisecore and back to gross jangly poppy punk shamble that makes me think of the Sockeye crew and their inebriated silliness. It's wild shit, totally chaotic and collapsing primitive hardcore and an absurdly mumbling vocalist and killer thrashcore riffs and random musical asides that go nowhere, with the a-side closing with the anthemic \"Greedy Bastards\" that sounds like they copped a certain Queen riff and twiste it towards their own atonal ends. Pretty glorious, actually. There's definitely an \"outsider hardcore\" vibe going on here, the speed and barreling violence of many of the songs reminioscemnt of classic thrashcore from Heresy, Siege or Larm (the latter being mentioned in the label's description of the 7\", in fact), but mushed into that goofball humerous delivery and intwined with the sort of gnarled, chaotic strangeness of stuff like Psycho Sin and the amazing no-fi clusterfuck HC of the UK band Genocide Association (which happened to include a young, pre-Earache Digby Pearson). Anyways, this platter is a ripper that takes the title of \" Complete Musical Disasters \" absolutely seriously, large chunks of it sounding quite poissbly improvised. Just as ridiculous are the song titles and lyrics, which include stuff like \"Aaaahhhh!\", \"I Love My Mum\", \"Cool Fabby Song\", \"Secret Pizza Eater\", and \"Elephant Song\". This EP makes me want to run straight up my walls and chow down on some cheese bread. Uncontrolled anti-musical fun.\n\nFRKSE Remove LP (Divergent Series) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nEarly recording from FRKSE, a still-enigmatic industrial outfit from Boton-based Rajen Bhatt that's been dropping massive rhythmic beats, dark punk industrial, and sumptuous gutter drones since the mid-oughts. Mostly lurking beneath the surface of the contemporary industrial / electronics movement, most folks probably know this persistant band from his more recent records on weirdo-hardcore powerhouse Iron Lung that came out around 2020, a stamp of approval in and of itself. At the onset of FRKSE's strange activity, though, the sounds leaned more towards the minimal, debuting with a similiarly minded silk-screened jacket with a simple handwritten insert card and single sigil marking its intent. Remove presents itself as a blank slate upon first handling, although the electronic and physical elements take form and aggression as soon as the wax starts to spin.\n\nHis connections and influence stemming from interests in the underground hip-hop scene rear their head early on as well. The album runs through nine songs, most of them somewhat brief sound-sculptures, and a carefully applied mixture of sound and improvisation fuels the encroaching, potentially dystopian atmopshere that begins to roll over the album. It's hard to pick out all of the instruments being utilized here; regularly armed with samplers, synthesizers, electronic processors, and vocals, it feels like there is some bass guitar snaking through this as well. I'm reminded of the often horrifying cacophony of 80's-era Missing Foundation at times but much more subdued, but even moreso the hypno-narcoptic boom-bap of early Scorn, albeit much more ruined and damaged by the unending reverberations of random machine sounds and faceless murmurs and errant electronic gunk that makes up modern city life. Nothing with FRKSE feels derivitive though. A punk-style count-off kicks it in, that monstrous slithering bass guitar presence mobing around slow-motion beats and swirling electronic noise. \"Rots The Primer\" emits a claustrophobic nightmare quality, distant rhythmic loops and echoes of abused inanimate objects slowly comes together into a sinister, neurotic and totally hypnotic industrial beatscape, recorded at just the right level of low-fidelity, oozing heaviness and dehumanized structures. Ululuating muezzin-esque calls carry over breaks of pure hiss, then sink back into the lurching, murky darkhop constructions of \"Engineer 1965 \" and \"To Fool A Brahmin\", the mighty breakbeat driven tension of \"Drunk On Power In The Dry State \", other songs erupting into a chaotic horror of tape-looped roiling monstrous voices and crushing bass-heavy noise. And every needle-drop feels like a sigh of resignation.\n\nI love the whole subterranean vibe of FRKSE's music here, sounding as if is occuring in some dead-end alley after midnight, a fusion of ritual and release, moments of fleeting transcendent beauty breaking off the surf of the musical churn and abrasive textures. But even at those flashes of almost post-rock like melody, FRKSE keeps the experienced anchored to an atmopshere of gleaming asphalt and distamt rumbling dumptrucks doing their rounds in the darkness, forgotten voices dissipating into manholes cracked slightly ajar, carving an inescapable, sludgy groove though the extremes of urban blight and intense isolation. This album has haunted me for awhile. It's long sold-out from the label, just a few copies left here on the shelf, but if any of those references or the power of the recent Iron Lung Records releases capture your nervous system and current anxieties as they've done to me, Remove comes recommended in all of its handmade, gritty obscurity.\n\nNIGHTMARE LODGE Blind Miniatures CD (Red Stream) 9.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Extinction\n\nSample : Tenia (Still Hooked Version)\n\nSample : Fugitive\n\nMARCH VIOLETS, THE The Palace Of Infinite Darkness 5 x CD + BOOK BOXSET (Jungle Records) 34.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Deep\n\nSample : The Face Of The Dragonfly (Richard Skinner Saturday Live)\n\nSample : Lighst Go Out\n\nSample : Snake Dance\n\nSample : Road Of Bones\n\nSample : Snake Dance (Extended)\n\nSample : Radiant Boys\n\nSample : MARCH VIOLETS, THE-The Palace Of Infinite Darkness\n\nCREMATION GROUNDS Abortion Sacrament CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 9.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSimilar to the recent online-only (thus far) release of the long-thought-lost Cremation Grounds full-length Lord Of Nerves, the 20-minute EP Abortion Sacrament is another recording that was produced in the late 2000s and had been thought lost for fifteen years due to the destruction of the hard drive that contained the original masters. As part of a recent organizing effort here at Crucial Blast, almost all of these recordings were recently rescued from that cursed external drive, and have been resurrected and remastered for your listening displeasure.\n\nComing from one of the preeminent entities of the Order Of The Warhead, the three-track Abortion Sacrament EP is the very first release that Cremation Grounds recorded around 2008-2009, and like other recordings of the era, dislodges a bog-damn of insanely misanthropic black noise / heavy electronics, gruesome blown-out industrial sludge, crushing harsh-noise-wall style constructions, and an overdriven recording style that may well have been itself the cause of that hard drive's suffering and collapse. Again, the gist of these tracks is pure in-the-red evil electronic obliteration, much of it crafted by the entities behind Cremation Grounds as a kind of \"meditation through abomination\" strategy, utilizing the recordings for deep meditative sessions typically accompanied by sacred entheogens, assorted psychedelics (both natural and otherwise), acts of self-debasement and self-abuse, extended scatalogical ritual, and the disintegration of the ego in the churning jet-black oceans of searing distortion and low-end rumbling rot that dominate the sessions.\n\nAbortion Sacrament does not have quite as much of the molten scum-dirge that is found on the Lord Of Nerves full-length. But these three tracks make up for it in all-out sense-wrecking chaos and over-modulated electronic violence. Drums, vocals and percussion all exist within the roiling black-static detonations of the title track and \"Spread Wide Upon Her Cremation Grounds (Adorned In Bone Ornaments)\", but they have been destroyed completely by walls of crumbling, crackling electronic distortion, with the occasional muffled roar of guttural, monstrous vocalizations breaking through the carnage.\n\nAs with the album, this material skews hard towards the harsh noise / black noise end of the sound spectrum, but likewise takes a great deal of inspiration from the diabolic filth of ancient, dissolving Finnish black/death demos. This sonic abhorrence crawls before the cracked and damaged altars of Macronympha, the no-fi bestial hiss of the earliest Beherit demos, classic Japanese noise a la Pain Jerk and Incapacitants, and the aura of eighth-generation dubs of Archgoat rehearsal tapes, all grown together into a swollen, pulsating, cancerous mass of cacophonous horror.\n\nThe EP is available on 3\" CD in DVD-size packaging, hand-numbered in an edition of 90 copies. Sacrament is also available on audio cassette in a limited run of 100 copies, with a bonus tape-only track on the B-side titled \"Enfolded In The Engorged Lips Of Kali\", another nineteen-minute harsh blackened heavy electronics meditation that was recorded around 2010. Both the 3\" CD and Cassette versions of Abortion Sacrament include full-color inserts and a vinyl Cremation Grounds sticker.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Spread Wide Upon Her Creamtion Grounds (Adorned In Bone Ornaments)\n\nSample : They Will Make Cemeteries Their Cathedrals And The Cities Will Be Your Tombs\n\nSample : Abortion Sacrament (Devil Rite)\n\nCATHEDRAL The Carnival Bizarre CASSETTE (Earache) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE DEAD THINK self-titled LP (Willowtip) 24.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nALLIN, GG Violent Beatings CD (ACME Records) 9.98\n\nViolent Beatings IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nOne of the more sonically extreme discs in the Allin catalog, this 2001 compilation is a fuckin' low-fi abomination. A reissue of one of the best sessions of abject noise punk from GG Allin, which has been out for awhile, but I'm just now getting it on the shelves. Like much of the later GG Allin output, it's atavistic hardcore punk filth, but this session boasts one of the harshest, most distorted recordings I think I've ever heard on an Allin album - oh hell yeah, Violent Beatings is one of my all time favorite discs from the Sewer Messiah. This recording is so fucked-up and noise-damaged that it strikes the same frayed nerve as stuff like Stickmen With Rayguns, Brainbombs, Flipper, Drunkdriver, No Balls, and Rectal Hygeneics. And that title? Couldn't be more fucking appropriate. It's one two three four and the blown-out homicide anthem \"Watch Me Kill The Boston Girl\" skids into you like an out of control Honda, a mere minute long blast of primitive hardcore with incredibly gnarly vocals pushed through a snarl of distortion and dented microphone. That hardcore punk element is all over the classic Watch Me Kill 7\" tracks (released on Fuckin' A / Stomach Ache Records in 1991) that consist of the first half of this disc, apparently remixed and remastered from the original four-track tape recordings, slamming one after another into the mutilation fantasia \"Castration Crucifixion\" a mid-tempo punk stomper, into the bizarre tribal exorcism \"Snakemans Dance\" that weaves reptilian noises and crude tribal rhythms and GG sneering psychotically over a simple but sinister sludgy guitar riff, producing some wickedly noxious psychedelic noise rock fuckery. And then it explodes into a shrapnel storm of infectious pogo violence via \"Slaughterhouse Deathcamp\" and the closing song \"Master Daddy\", that wash of omnipresent tape-hiss consistently smeared over top of everything, simultaneously catchy as hell, and garbled and grotesque; a bizarre Communion ritual is rasped over the blasphemous sludge-punk of \"Feces And Blood Bacteria Of The Soul\" that dredges up some more of the band's latent shithole psychedelia, twisted and gnarled blues guitar licks and discordant amp skree swirled into the slow-motion depravity, almost suggesting a viciously violent Butthole Surfers jam as the group and Allin stumble and stomp their way to the absolute blurr-chaos of the summit. Yeah man, this EP is a beast,; again, one of my favorites of the late 80s Allin canon.\n\nThe alternate recordings from the August 1988 \"Suicide Sessions\" is similarly hideous and wrecked as the band rams another five tracks of grime down your throat, from the Oi!-esque catchiness of \"Dagger In My Heart\", the vile mid-tempo metalpunk crusher \"Spread Your Legs Part Your Lips\", the \"classick\", almost surf rock-tinged \"Shit On My Prick\" with its brain-damaged atonal guitar soloing and simple, barbaric riff; \"Cornhole Lust\"'s borderline pigfuck atrocity that stands out on the set with its slower, shambling tempo, horrific vocal sounds, and gritty noise and distortion. The band's hardcore punk undercurrent rises to the surface on \"Kiss Me In The Gutter”, again demonstrating some completely berserk ear-fucking guitar skronk and solo. Oner of the real standouts on Beatings is the abject sludge of \"Drug Whore\", a dark and deliriant crusher that could almost pass for some unheard Hellhammer song, its grisly minor-key riffs grinding over you like a bulldozer, the noisy fretboard histrionics adding to the song's aura of depravity and chaotic frenzy, with Allin's ranting, seemingly freeform muttering and whispering and shouting drawling across the slo-mo scumbath. \"I Live To Be Hated\" is a perfect closer, another one of those rippin' nihilistic pogo-punk jammers that Allin and crew were able to just pluck out of the fetid air. What a glorious, abominable bloodbath.\n\nINTEGRITY / NOTHING Splitsville 7\" VINYL (Relapse) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSCALD HYMN / PERMANENT WAVES split CASSETTE (Phage Tapes) 8.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nEarly 2023 tape release from the mighty Phage, pairing two interesting newer dark-sound sculptors for well over half an hour of deep creep.\n\nScald Hymn brings two untitled tracks that are almost the exact same length; long warbling tones from chamber strings, perhaps sourced from the slow, improvised scrape and bow of a cello or viola, are delicately layered together to form a crepuscular blur of mournful-sounding drones and forlorn intonations. It's quite pretty, in a melancholic way, but as Scald (aka Erik Brown) proceeds into this dimly-lit subterreanean space, he begins to summon eruptions of garbled, metallic junk-noise, crashing metal against metal, electronics on electronics, as extreme high-frquency feedback tones scream out of the blackness like airbursts, as those stringed instruments continue to weep in anguish. In total, this side delivers a pretty powerful sonic experience, contrasting a sad sort of concrete noise poetry with blasts of absolutely excoriating, brutal cacophony. Solid stuff, with the intimate sound of fingers fumbling against knobs and dials, the sounds drifting through your brusied skull from some unmapped region between the scattershot junk/metal-blast collage of K2 or Hal Hutchinson, the hyperviolent carnage of Macronympha, and the febrile strands of intense feedback apllication pursued by Tourette.\n\nThe three pieces from counterpart Permanent Waves share a common lust for extreme feedback manipulation, as \"Belief In History\", \"Three Mirrors For Healing And Travel\", and \"Shear Force Impression Model\" unwind like besotted nightmares, sending streams of searing hiss and squeal over deeply warped singing and complete fucked-up pop-style vocals , the combination of all of this smearing and clotting together into an intricate abomination. Like Scald Hymn, this is a very personalized approach to harsh noise, forging a uniquely broken world of sound that grows more hideous and abrasive with each passing moment. The bits of musicality, random urban noise and natural sounds that appear become buried and crushed under the bludgeoning low-end, nerve-shredding skree, and bouts of abstracted electronic vomitus feel more and more like a mockery, until the humanity is scraped away and you are left sitting in the center of a storm of spastic, gurgling distortion and rudimentary rhythms. Somehow over the course of the twenty-minutes, this moves uneasily through haunting soundscapes and absolutely obliterating pandemonium.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : ��S C A L D H Y M N U n t i t l e d\n\nSample : ��P E R M A N E N T W A V E S S h e a r F o r c e I m p r e s s i o n M o d e l\n\nSTCLVR Post Self Abandonment CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 9.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nOne of my latest obsessions is the burgeoning field of what I describe as \"Death EBM\", a loosely-connected cadre of artists and bands from around the world heavily influenced by the classic 1980s \"Electronic Body Music\" movement spearheaded by the likes of Nitzer Ebb and Front 242. Heavily relying on sequencers, distorted Korg and Roland synthesizers, pummeling drum machines, aggressive vocals, and punk-as-fuck anti-authoritarian lyrics, those pioneers developed a hybrid of industrial music; electronic dance elements and punk rage that absolutely dominated the late 80s underground. That style of industrial dance music went in and out of fashion over the subsequent decades, though, with some artists heading in a more \"metal\"-centric direction, others polishing their sound to a sleeker, more commercial technoid style. But in recent years, I've been following a serious resurgence in this style that seems to be coming primarily out of the harsh noise / dark industrial / synth-punk underground, with many of these new heavy hitters appearing on the Phage Tapes label. This new breed of EBM retains the violent 4/4 syncopated aggression and searing, distorted synthesizer sounds of the original scene, but bring a virulent strain of violent, grotesque electronics and vocals to the aesthetic, infecting these heavier EBM attacks with death metal-style shrieks, charred and blackened keyboard melodies, jackhammer-powered industrial abrasion, and trace elements of other extreme music forms that turn the whole EBM sound on its head, producing something uglier, heavier, harsher, darker and more ferocious than ever before, often drenched in violent, visceral eroticism. Phage has been mapping this incredible deathscape in recent years, delivering punishing neo-EBM from artists like Choke Chain, Distruster, Plack Blague, Wvalaam Klous, Harsh R, Talk Show, Fox Nova Project, Human Vault, It Spoke In Tongues and a host of other crushers. This shit is amazing, and anyone who's diggin' this heavy new brand of EBM should dive into that label's catalog, STAT.\n\nOne of the best of these dancefloor / headroom annihilators is STCLVR. Pronounced \"Streetcleaver\", this mutant from somewhere in Western NY blew the tail end of 2023 apart with the slammin' electronic body-horror bomb Post Self Abandonment , which came out on 12\" vinyl through Phage right around Halloween. This cassette edition features the same material, and it's a beast. Merging caustic noise, power electronics influences, crumbling distortion walls, industrial metal, and monstrous vocals, this album builds upon the bulldozing EBM / synth-metal crush of the tracks from the Talk Show split cassette from 2022 (where I first encountered STCLVR's music, alongside the reissue of the Lovers album) and comes out even heavier (and more danceable) than ever. Ten tracks of brutal Death EBM that unleash a maelstrom of rabid electronic noise, horrifying death metal-esque screams and roars, gigantic rumbling industrial loops, vintage synthesizer arpeggios, and blasts of pummeling rhythmic power that invoke the hardest dance-floor eruptions of classic Belgian EBM. Equal parts harsh psychedelic noise, acid-damaged beast roars, lava-like distortion, and hardened beats that resemble Front 242, Nitzer Ebb, or Twitch -era Ministry filtered through a blackened cloud of rot and repulsion. The bass line that drives \"Scumbag Finesse\" immediately recalls the main theme from John Carpenter's iconic Assault On Precinct 13 score while adding chaotic, clanging rhythms, bursts of blast beat-level speed, and those ravenous shrieks; the propulsive four-on-the-floor power of \"Plowed\", underscored by grinding chord structures, erupts into a kind of electro-thrash savagery. The highly infectious beats that burn through the whiteout of \"Cocaine Winter\" join with melancholic synths, offering a discordian atmosphere that continues through the whole album; likewise, an element of Digital Hardcore seethes through songs like \"Sea Hag 2023\" and the menacing techno throb of closer \"Tarnish\", adding to the variety of rhythmic texture on the album. Forged from the black fire of mental and emotional struggle, STCLVR emerges anew, fearsome and unstoppable, and you can hear it through the entire album. Post Self Abandonment is triumphant.\n\nThe vinyl version of Post Self Abandonment is available via Phage Tapes.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Cocaine Winter\n\nSample : Scumbag Finesse\n\nSample : Crows Feet\n\nSample : Sea Hag 2023\n\nSA BRUXA Ritual CD (Dunkelheit Produktionen) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nULTRAVIOLENCE Psycho-Drama CASSETTE (Earache) 8.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nHANNUM, TERENCE Spectral Life LP (Shelter Press) 23.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAs a member of blackened kosmische architects Locrian, Terence Hannum has had a hand in harnessing some of the coolest, darkest synthscapes and blasts of sonic desolation I've listened to in recent years. When he's working solo, though, Hannum's work can take more minimal, amorphous forms. Now sold out from the label, Spectral Life was one of the first solo releases to appear from Terence Hannum, a member of Chicago-based kosmische crush ensemble Locrian. With sleeve art that draws from his visual art that is largely obsessed with strange abstract visions of hair, this Lp is a stunning abyssic zone-out, the core sounds are for the most part the same as Locrian's, drawing heavily from vintage space music, dark synthesizer-based soundscapes and carefully crafted blats of jet-black drone, and fans of that band's work will find much of he same dark, amorphous grandeur here. But Hannum does give this Lp a slight twist, the first side \"Invocation Of Deities\" rumbling forth on a billowing, faintly luminescent fog of murky percussive reverberations and distant metallic clank. It's got this fantastic malevolent vibe from the start, those swirling gusts of metallic rumble and rattle buried beneath a heavy blackness, and as it unfolds across its thirteen minute duration, Hannum unleashes a pulsating electronic drone that drills through the muted ambience, leading the side through some interesting shifts into looping cosmic chorales and darkly gorgeous synthdrift, evolving from a minimalist horror-movie score into something more unearthly, slipping downward in a beautiful multi-part finale that at one point resembles classic Tangerine Dream as heard through a wall of black soil, muffled and ghostly.\n\nWhen the other track \"Total Dissolution\" suddenly crashes in on the b-side, it's as a jarring din of crashing cymbals, abrasive metallic noise that seems to be looped round and round, circling swells of ominous droning drift. It's still quite eerie though, settling into an odd, almost ritualistic feel as the sounds continue to loop and circle each other, and creepy EVP-like voices surge out of the background, building to this swarming hive of clattery chaos that eventually blossoms into another powerful synth-drone. The second half of the side is gorgeous, transformed into a gleaming, noctilucent wash of midnight psychedelia, seraphic voices stretched wide over waves of distorted guitar and clustered keyboards.\n\nIssued in a limited edition of four hundred copies.\n\nRUDIMENTARY PENI Cacophony (2023 Remaster) CD (Sealed Records) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNew (2023) remastered reissue of the classic deathrock / wyrd-punk album Cacophony, presented in jewel case CD, vinyl, and cassette. Here's my write-up, slightly edited, of the previous Outer Himalayan edition :\n\nFew new releases this year have had me as jazzed as the sudden and rather unexpected surge of re-mastered Rudimentary Peni albums that have been coming out from Outer Himalayan. There's an upcoming reissue of the band's ferocious 2004 EP Archaic coming out in the next couple of weeks that I can't wait to get my hands on, but while we're waiting for that to materialize, we've picked up the second and third Rudimentary Peni albums that came out earlier this summer as part of this ambitious reissue campaign, both of which are pretty much essential for anyone into dark, macabre punk, early death-rock, and occult-obsessed hardcore.\n\nIt would be very hard to overstate just how influential these albums have been on an entire class of bands that followed in their wake, and you can now hear echoes of Rudimentary Peni's spiky, angular punk and bubbling madness lingering on albums from all kinds of hardcore punk, avant-rock and even black metal bands. They have always been grouped in with the early 80's anarcho-punk scene that flourished in Britain, but aside from their early connections with the band Crass (having released their 1982 Farce 7\" on Crass Records), Rudimentary Peni had very little in common both musically and thematically with most of the other punk bands that they were associated with. Their music was so much darker and more enigmatic than almost anything else happening in British punk at the time, with much of the unique sound and vibe coming from front-man Nick Blinko, a visionary lyricist and artist who has struggled with mental illness and long periods of hospitalization throughout the bands entire career, and who brought his increasingly deranged visions of disturbing deformed characters, rampant paranoia, and withered horrors to the bands music, drawing influence from the works of H.P Lovecraft and the occult. For fans of dark, outre punk rock, the Rudimentary Peni records are absolutely essential; all three of the band's albums are crucial slabs of twisted, menacing rock, and even their EPs are minor masterpieces of macabre weirdness. They've never put out a bad record, and I actually think that their more recent stuff, while heavier and different from their classic early records, is just as amazing as their earliest, most legendary recordings. All are classic albums of malevolent weirdo punk, presented with complete lyrics and lots of Blinko's amazing obsessive pen-and-ink artwork.\n\nThe follow up to Peni's seminal debut Death Church, 1989's Cacophony continued to pursue the band's melding of twisted, angular punk rock and cosmic-horror imagery, going so far as to become a kind of Lovecraft-obsessed death punk opera. Instead of paying homage to the author’s body of work work merely by trying to channel the \"The Music of Erich Zann\" like most other Lovecraft-obsessed bands, Peni instead created this weird concept album that retold the story of Lovecraft's actual life through a series of bizarre vignettes, the narrative unfolding across short, ferocious blasts of fast-paced punk, with some of the songs appearing as instrumentals with strange spoken word readings over top. The rest of the album features those short minute and a half long blasts of quirky singing and ferocious pogo hooks, dark, driving bass lines, spiky angular riffs and fast-paced drumming that sometimes surges into near-hardcore speeds, the songs often degenerating into a maniacal din of seemingly random voices, strange sinister whispering and squalls of ear-rupturing guitar noise. This is some of the coolest stuff that ever came out of the British punk scene of the 1980s, for sure. Songs like \"The Only Child\" are stomping, death rock-esque punk rock with some of the most disturbing lyrics you'll ever hear on an old punk record; other songs might contain just two words, \"flamelike / sunset\", repeated over and over, or turn into a string of bizarre gibberish. There's the metallic hardcore punk eruption of \"Nightgaunts\" that opens the album, the dark goth of \"The Evil Clergyman\", the dissonant noise rock of \"Brown Jenkin\" with that maddening, incessant police whistle blowing through the whole song, the jangly psychedelia and electronic hissing of \"Sarcophagus\" and drug-addled pop punk of \"Lovecraft Baby\". And all through the album, in between the band's blasts of heavy twisted punk, there are these short sections where a bunch of different voices will suddenly appear all speaking over one another, giving you the impression that you're listening to some weird Vaudevillian radio theatre performance taking place, playing out the strange events that make up this disturbing re-envisioning of Lovecraft's life and work. Brilliant.\n\nIt's crucial to have this classic album of creepy outsider punk available again. Sounds as good and as weird as ever, too.\n\nDEATH FACTORY Drone Footage CD (No Sides) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAlong with the excellent psychnoise experience of the Artifacts tape, this earlier disc also features main man Michael Krause teamed with William Sides to produce some more longform lysergic-laced post-industrial darkness. On this 2017 recording, Krause continues to handle the synthesizers, percussion, and electronic elements with Sides adding on the additional synths and electronic signals to produce a five-track ful length that gets even more demented than their other collaboration.\n\nDeath Factory's patented blend of coarse electronics, sculpted noise, and grinding rhythm-based loop-scapes with classic kosmischemusic and psychedelia\n\nA gruesome bass-squelch appears, writhing around in a clotted mess of ghostly feedback and synth blurp, an abberant blasphemy of something vaguely reminiscent of an Asiatic melody, while swarms of snarling electronics and whirring glitch dart and flit overhead; the sound of that opener \"Revelation of the Fendahl\" is a bizarre, semi-structured scaffold of trippy, twisted metal and bedraggled signal-waves. Despite the Dr Who reference in the title, this feels more and more schizophrenic as it unfolds, the sounds melting into one another and cereating a malformed mass of FX-fuckery. A prelude to the nearly half-hour \"Knight Forces\"? When that suddenly kicks in, it wipes the slate free of debris, initially laying down a faint filimient of high-tone feedback and an imperceptible mechanical thrum deep under the sdurface; an eerie minimalist noisescape that extends outwards over the epic duration of the piece. It borders on pure ambient presence, hinting at some of the most sparse early Prurient works, but posessed with Krause's signature attention to grimy detail. That spectral whine and whirr gets demolished by an abrupt blast of hideous gurgling synth and skull-scraping percussive overload, like hearing a corpse in the midst of a military blast-test that has been outfitted with numerous contacts mics - it's a frenzied and frankly somewhat nauseating sprawl of deranged effect-pedal violence and heavily amplified scrape and skree that has a real visceral effect on the listener. Definitely still in the borderlands, spying only the most loathsome aspects of electronic psych-spurt, backed by what sounds like mic'd metal or other objects being beaten into pieces. Some of the lower tones that the duo hits on this track are intense; the spaced-out effects and garbled chaos can sometimes evoke the pissed-off electronic overload of Bastard Noise, Pain Jerk, or even Actuary. Again, visceral. This is Death Factory at its most physically assaultive.\n\nThere's another \"shorter\" piece, \"Live in Kalamozoo\"; definitely sounds live, and sounds like the duo are doing some serious damage to the audience by way of waves of massive low-end synthesizer drone and grinding bass, ultimately unleashing their signature brain-scrambling devil-Moog hysterics that were probably rattling the beer cups out of everyone's hands. I can hear some people in attendance are seriously feeling it. That earthquake monster is followed by two more long-form noise attacks, \"Restraint is Hard\" and \"Neverwhere (for Crazy Andy) \" that again pull you into spare and threatening fields of electrified malfunction and malfeasance, streaking a low-end sub-strata of guttural synth with delay-soaked effects and that gnarled feedback twisted and shaped into something terrible. That contrast between large minimal sound spaces and bomb-blasts of distorted, mangled synthesizer seizure seems to be the driving MO behind the bulk of this disc. Yiou don't get as much of the wild LSD-wrecked psych-filth and faux-Moog monstrosities I usually hear with older Death Factory recorings. They are here, just held back, caged up, pulling at the chain but not being unleashed until the duo have buiilt everything up to an intended level of tension through those sprawling drone-fields and ascents onto immense death-ambient monoliths. But when they let loose with that Hawkwind-in-a-blender synthesier maelstrom that Krause has made his signature sound (and by god, he goes there, he transforms the last twenty minutes of this album into something terrifying and apocalyptic), and it feels like I've got Venusian vermin chewing my feet off as Planet X starts its approach to Earth and the skies burn black above me, it drives my endorphnes through the fuckling roof. This is something a little different. Still abrasive, but different.\n\nComes in a plastic DVD case.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Revelation Of The Fendahl\n\nSample : Restraint Is Hard\n\nSample : Neverwhere (For Crazy Andy)\n\nMANSON, CHARLES Walking In The Truth LP (TPOS) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nIGNIVOMOUS Hieroglossia LP (Nuclear War Now! Productions) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nPsychotic death chaos. This is what exudes from 2019's Hieroglossia, the third full-length album from this Australian band. It's actually been awhile (seven years) since these beasts destroyed me with their last one , Contragenesis, and their nihilistic, violently expressive energy remains as enveloping as it ever has. Ignivomous has been one of my favorite Aussie death metal bands for awhile, shaking off that now-pejorative \"cavernous\" cliche that has dogged so many of the bands from that region over the past fifteen years; these guys are clearly moved by the iconic Incantation-style of death metal that exists in the tangledd root-system of most of the Melbourne-area death metal scene, but just like most of their peers, Ignivomous push that aesthetic out into stranger, more nebulous fields of ectoplasm-smeared weirdness. Hell yeah.\n\nA rush of crushing, repetitious-but-hypnotic riffing blows in from some sulfuric source, the music beginning its continuous progression from those catchy, grinding deeath mertal riffs into more off-kilter, more technical guitar structures, blurs of droning single-chord noise, the rhythm section sinuously shifting from powerful tempo changes to gonked-out breakdowns to angularized grooves with sharp edges. Starting with the title track, each song unfurls into a crazed riff-collage, putrescent guttural roars echoing and stretching over and through the roiling violence. Getting deeper into Hieroglossia reveals what seems like a newfound predeliction for more bizarre guitar textures and riff assemblage, sudden dropouts into these almost synthlike dirges. When the drummer lets 'er rip and goes nuclear with the blastbeats, the songs like \"Circle of Scythes\" and \"Cloaked in Resplendent Perdition\" can begin to blur into an almost impenetrable wall of noise; these moments are constrained for a portion of the album, releasing total chaotic destruction at the peak of these gonzo complex melodies and skronky riffs. It never gets into Gorgutsian levels of confusional craziness, but this is definitely a more experiemntal and expansive album than the flesheating murkstorms of the previous album Contragenesis. Which, naturally, has me droolin'all over it. Fans of more conventional death metal might get irked over the increasingly whacked-out song structures and eccentric riff sequences - there are more than a few moments on the albbum where the songs seem to lead, uh, nowhere, these really offbeat formations and non-sequiters that challenge anything along the lines of \"traditional\" death metal songcraft. which makes it a difficult listen in someways, even when the more flowing leads and lumbering, doom-laden grooves kick in. And the guitar solos reach some absurd heigjhts of intensity, complexity, and dissonance, not to mention being slimed all over these eight songs.\n\nHonestly, I think Contragenesis is still my favorite album from the band so far, but the thorny insanity that Ignivomous delivere here is pretty undeniable. Some of the highlights for me included the razor-cyclone chaos of \"Shackles of the Demiurge \" and its wild lattice-work of hyperfast alien lead lines; the comparatively more straightforward pummelling that \"Thalassophobia \" delivers, while the drumming is relentless from beginning to end. \"Blood & Mercury\" evokes some of the alchemical imagery of previous work while clobbering you with what feels like you are listening to two copies of Onward To Golgatha, one playing forward, the other in reverse. \"Gaunt Redemption Parasite\" slips into an almost funereal doom-death crawl laced with stirring mournful leads and shifting rhythmic churn, then closes with a mysterious spoken word passage. And closer \"Vitriolic Swarm \" is the ultimate berserker eruption, blendin that blasting inchoate chaos and spine-snapping tempo/riff changes and confusiona time signnature and puzzling chord progressions all into one buzzing nightmare of outre death metal horror.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Hieroglossia\n\nSample : Cloaked In Resplendent Perdition\n\nSample : Vitriolic Swarm\n\nSLOGUN Days Of Agony CD (Bloodlust!) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFUCKED UP Live At Third Man Records LP (Third Man Records) 14.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Year Of The Rat\n\nSample : California Cold\n\nSample : Year Of The Ox\n\nBARONESS First/Second LP (Hyperrealist Records) 23.98\n\nFirst/Second IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nOnce again back in stock, on black vinyl - here's the old review from previous editions:\n\nThe early EP releases from Baroness have gone in and out of print over the years on different formats, and are once again available on vinyl through the folks at Hyperrealist, this time as a single limited-edition full length Lp that collects both the band's First and Second Eps remixed and remastered and presented in a gatefold package with all of John Baizley's awesome artwork, foil stamped lettering on the cover, and a printed inner sleeve.\n\nMonstrously epic sounding, thunderous sludge riffs and skillful dual-guitar harmonies come together with ripping d-beat hardcore aggression. Sort of like His Hero Is Gone busting out Fucking Champs-style harmonies? Although these songs all sound pretty apocalyptic, there is a great sense of melody throughout this CD - this stuff is really quite pretty and catchy at times.\"Tower Falls\" has got some awesome anthemic breakdowns and harmonies.\"Coeur\" is the shortest track at just over three minutes, yet still packs in killer memorable riffs and harmonies and odd (but awesome) riffs and chord phrasings. The final track,\"Rise\", is a monster, starting off with atmospheric finger tapping that stretches for several minutes before turning into a bulldozing sludge dirge . Awesome.\n\nOn on Second: The second EP from Baroness delivers more of their righteous and majestic post-crust-metal that we loved so much from their First CD, with technical instrumentals, lengthy psychedelia, and moody RODAN / JUNE OF 44 post-rock interjected with awesome Maidenesque / Fucking Champs-level guitar harmonies and crushing tech / sludge / crustcore. Super powerful, and Second also does a good job of capturing the band�s live energy. Killer stuff, BARONESS just keeps getting better and better with each release. And as with their first release, this disc has three songs, clocking in at around 21 minutes. Highly recommended to fans of Isis and Pelican, Disrupt and Neurosis, psychedelic crust, punishingly heavy metallic post-rock, stretched-out tarpit sludge, odd meters and complex arrangements and triumphant metal hooks.\n\nBLACK SAND DESERT Black Sand Desert 2 x CD (Phage Tapes) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nLULL That Space Somewhere CD (Cold Spring) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise to have this new Lull album pop up at the end of last year - like the label states, this is the first brand new album from Mick Harris's dark ambient project in fourteen years, long enough that I really didn't expect him to revisit the ice-cold stygian dronefields that he helped to trailblaze in the early 90s alongside Lustmord and Yen Pox. Lull has always been one of my all-time favorite dark ambient outfits, Harris just seems to have this spectacular touch for weaving impossibly deep webs of subterranean murmur and barren volcanic drift that stands out from anyone else in the field. Definitely muich more than just \"that electronic side-project from the former Napalm Death drummer\" to me.\n\nCovid-era sessions\n\nImpressionistic driftscapes that evoke oceanic vastness, an immense and empty terrain cast with an ominous, crepescular glow, somewhere on the razor's edge between twilight and nightfall. Fields of immensely ancient ice sprawling all the way to the horizon, the dim, fading solar glow rising over that distant flatline horizon, vaporous clouds of freezing air and condensation swirling upwards into the troposphere. A single, blinding beam of light shoots straight down into the ice-fields, stretching skyward from the surface like a lunar ray that ascends to the point of invisibility. Borealis-like smears of lightform shifting imperceptibly beyond the vanishing point. The pieces, titled \"Range\", \"Expanse\", \"Unplumbed\", \"Way\" feel like a fractured phrase, each one stretching from eleven to seventeen minutes and flowing together like a black haze of sound. Pieces of something approaching sonority slip beneath the surface of these glacial sheets of sound, bleeding into each other, blurring and melting together.\n\nMake sure you've got a good system for low-frequency playback. For an hour, Harris draws the listener through a boundless sonic environment, the drones and rumblings and reverberations and echoes moving constantly in all directions, washing over you again and anagin with huge swells of deep bass tones and lush chordal forms, spires of majestic tonality piercing through the gloom and shadow and casting a luminous glow across the billowing, gamboling cloudscapes, awe-inspiring choral textures rising out of unseeable depths. This is unmistakeably Lull, scultping vast and ominous sound into dramatic movements that completely surround you, quite different from the other early \"dark ambient\" and \"isolationist\" artists; Harris utilizes his layering of low-frequency / low-end soundscapes to create something almost symphonic, opener \"Range\" being a perfect specimen of this approach as the track unfurls into something akin to a cosmic event, with peaks and valleys of intensely cinematic magnitude arrayed into deeply moving formations. Aside from having an extremely subtle rhythmic substratum in his dronescapes, Harris and Lull usually brings a meditative element to this music that distinguishes it in the field, with series of forms and patterned movements that reveal themselves to the attentive listener, especially on the first two tracks of That Space Somewhere, \"Range\" and \"Expanse\". As the album moves into its second half, though, it feels more meteorological, those giant tectonic tones and reverberations giving way to a slightly more etheric sprawl of endless shimmer and metallic whirlpools. \"Unplumbed\" and \"Way\" develop into slightly more harrowing topographies, less physically visercal tjhan the begining of the album but no less immersive and evocative. Like waves of tone emitting from planetary-sized prayer bowls, rippling through the cosmos.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Way\n\nSample : Expanse\n\nSample : Range\n\nMURDEROUS VISION Ghosts Of The Soul Long Lost: Volume Two 2 x CD (Live Bait) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nOne of Murderous Vision's series of massive multi-disc compilations of rare material, Volume Two focuses on music recorded around the early 2000s with a combination of short-run CDR releases and never-before-released music; if you're getting heavy into this Ohio outfit's body of work, these compilations are crucial. One of the pre-eminent US purveyors of death industrial , Murderous Vision is actually a pretty varied project, with excursions into weirder tonal territory than your typical Cold Meat Industries release - this stuff can turn straight-up psychedelic on a dime, while still maintaining that grim, apocalyptic radiance. I'm a big fan of this stuff.\n\nThe entire first disc is an unreleased Murderous Vision album that was recorded from 2006 to 2008; produced around the same time as the Lifes Blood Death's Embrace album, this twelve-song collection, titled Cathartic Drifts In A Sea Of Sadness, lays on the same kind of grim and sprawling darkness that album focused on. Fusing together qualitieies of classic early dark ambient, vague neo-classical elements, late-80's \"ritual ambient\", morbid Cold Meat Industries-style death industrial, and various occult imagery, Drifts is dense stuff. The symphonic synths of opener \"In Hell We Will Burn...Together\" conjure a very similiar vibe to the more \"orchestral\"-sounding dungeon synth that was appearing in the 2000s, but then mixes in commanding spoken-word vocals, ceremonial percussion and thunderous, almost militant tribal drumming with a rich acoustic presence, and creepy stabs of staccato strings. When \"Upon Both Flesh And Soil \" picks up from there, Petrus ascends into an even more cinematic scope as subtle, sublime Berlin School-style synths drift alongside mysterious voice transmissions, melting electronic signals, and faint but noticeable clouds of crackle and buzz.\n\nIt's dark, dark stuff, with those offbeat sudden turns into melodramatic blackened industrial that sounds like some alien wargoat reciting from ancient texts amid colossal blasts of huge, distant percussive rumble, looped Satanic strings, and pulsating, tumor-like rhythms; man, I absolutely love this era of Murderous Vision, his weird riff on European death industrial felt like it was suffused with whatever the hell was infecting the water and soil in northern Ohio. Like I've mentioned elsewhere, the vast bulk of the Cathartic Drifts material feels akin to a meeting point of Brighter Death Now, Kerovnian's black ambient, and the druggy ritual industrial sounds of groups like Psychonaut 75, Zero Kama , Herbst9 and Sigillum S, so there's definitely much to offer here if you're inclined to that sort of music. Oh and it grows stranger by the moment, oddly hopeful synth-murk smeared in filmic orchestrated blur whirling around troubling film samples of acts of violence and depravation, opening into rich fields of multi-layered electronic ambience, brief moments that feel like they could have seeped into this from a rain-damaged cassette copy of Tangerine Dream's score to The Keep, more pummeling kettledrum-esque rumble and ghostly clacking underscored with huge swathes of grinding sub-surface vibration, long sprawls of perverted religious musical forms, amorphous sinister driftscapes and heavy, rhythmic zoned-out trance states , monstrous chanting choirs and swells of mesmeric Teutonic synthesizers (like on the killer \"Structures And Pathways\" that sounds like Tangerine Dream held hostage by members of Les Legions Noires) , endlessly grinding stone and stygian throb of inhuman machinery, those drums and other percussion surfacing constantly throughout the seventy-minute-plus albumin all manner of forms to propel you further and further into the album's strange and often psychotropic interior abyss, but finding onesself standing amid emotional desolation with a haunting coda of acoustic strum and twang, keys, and layered voices that has a straight-out Swans feel to it.\n\nIf I'm ever wandering therough a skull-lined catacomb system on LSD, I'd want to have this \"lost\" album pouring into my ears. It's one of the coolest \"unreleased albums\" that I've heard.\n\nWe move to the second disc, where you get a mixture of out-of-print Live Bait CDR releases such as the 2009 Frozen In Morphia disc and a privately-issued 3\" disc, capped off with another unreleased track, this one from 2006. Still trawling the abyss, beautifully so, but with some more unexpected and experimental forays into rhythmic structure. The eight-song Morphia (directly influenced by Aleistar Crowley's Diary Of A Drug Fiend) materializes in a thick fog of geo-physic subduction tremors, active drumming that veers from tribal ritual vibe to martial intensity and focus, more male and female voices emerging over spooky piano and spectral string sections, spoken word incantations and morbid poetics drifting over swirling noctural ambience. It's more collaborative than other MV releases from that era, and goes into some interesting directions. Almost every single track here gives itself over to some new drumming pattern, often fully present and up front in the mix as slow hypnotic beats rumble beneath smears of dreary synth, folky strum and intricately fingerpicked melody, again hinting at that bleak psychedelia that Petrus really started to get into towards the latter half of the decade. Of course, that gloomy title track is followed by the smoldering death industrioal of \"Through The Motes Of Dust \" and the sickening morgue-drone of \"Clawmarks In The Muck \" that pull you back down into stinking, sulfuric machine fumes and daemonic muttering, so the atmopshere on Morphia is, well, fairly amorphous. And then there's \"Secular Assault \" that comes out of nowhere as a full band emerges with this killer industrial dirge-metal assault, massively distorted riffs and slithering bass and slow motion earthmover drumming, monstrous seething screams buried in distortion; with weird dubby elements to the echoing snare and walking basslines, this one threw me for a loop, part Winter-esque deathsludge, part dub-infected delusion, part early Swans-style repetitious assault. I can't think of anywhere else in the Murderous Vision discography where he suddenly went full-on freakazoid scum-sludge like this, but it rules. It's a solid, offbeat, totally overlooked album from Murderous Vision, that closes with a nearly twenty-minute live performance of what sounds like a witch's sabbat . The last two tracks are similairy intriguing artifacts, the meandering piano that drives the neo-classical ritualism on \"Seas\", insane black metal-esque shrieks lurking in the depths and bearing witness to blinding blasts of kosmiche electronics into the upper atmopshere, while the unreleased \"Collective Murder\" draws its curtains down around some terrific orchestral dark ambience.\n\nWORMED Exodromos (BLUE VINYL) LP (Willowtip) 24.99\n\nExodromos (BLUE VINYL) IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nNow available on vinyl.\n\nAvant-garde psychedelic sci-fi slam-death? One of the few contemporary bands to come out of the \"brutal\" death metal underground that I've found to be at all worthwhile, Spain's Wormed have been offering a very strange, ultra-complex sound for over a decade now; although they've had a couple of crushing EPs come out over the past decade (like 2010's batshit insane Quasineutrality and a three-way split with Goratory and Vomit Remnants) and have made some notable appearances at extreme metal festivals like Maryland Deathfest, this is actually the first new album from Wormed in ten years, and sees the band pushing their sound into even more dizzying extremes of complexity and heaviness. They take the slamming, bone-crushing power of that whole Suffocation / Devourment / Cryptopsy end of the death metal spectrum and blasts it through a stargate, creating a vicious strain of mutant death metal woven from quantum physics hallucinations and eldritch alien horrors vomiting out of deep-space wormholes. On the band's long-awaited second album Exodromos, Wormed's vicious angular metallic crunch is further slathered in electronic textures and glitchy ambience and fused to confusing, near incomprehensible time signatures, and fronted by a singer who shifts between bestial pig-grunt vocals and an utterly bizarre, seemingly pitch-shifted gurgle that gives one the impression that you are, in all actuality, listening to the vocalizations of a giant insect. All of that would make this stuff weird enough, and put it right up my sci-fi metal lovin' alley, but Wormed take these concepts and musical complexity into such extremes that it manages to transcend the brutal death metal sound and becomes something much more outre.\n\nA bizarre concept album about the last surviving human being left in the wake of a universe-collapsing wormhole, this is some of the most complex, mind-melting death metal I've heard since the new Gorguts album. The songs on Exodromos spiral out into seemingly endless riff-whirlwinds, the blenderized rhythms and discordant riffing welded together with a malicious, reptilian intent, each song riddled with sudden and violently jarring tempo and time signature changes, the riffs as fucked-up and atonal as anything off of Gorguts's no wave-damaged death metal classic Obscura. But Wormed are just as skilled at suddenly dropping into a bone-crushing groove that feels like the sound of that Hadron Collidor starting to warm up, or slip into a vicious, stuttering, twisted math-metal workout. The drumming on this album is fucking mind-blowing, super technical and precise, virtuosic even, often lurching into sickening stop/start arrangements, guiding Wormed's churning deep-space chaos out of the angular, ultra-blasting progdeath and into some killer classic metal riffage or sweeping melodic guitars that offer a striking contrast with the jagged discordant blast. The album is littered with tracks like \"Solar Neutrinos\", which combines creepy spoken word passage and looping guitar ambience with weird synthesizer effects, an interlude amid the crushing mechanized death metal, and there are several short electronic noisescapes that start and end various tracks. On \"Multivectorial Reionization\", they detonate some robotic Meshuggah-esque deathchug that's so heavy that it'll rumble the walls of your stomach, and \"Spacetime Ekleipsis Vorticity\" slips into breathless torrents of cyborg-calliope fretboard insanity. More of that crazed prog-shred shows up on \"Stellar Depopulation\", and some of those rapid-fire tremolo picked melodies have a staccato feel that sort of reminds me of some of Mick Barr's (Orthrelm) stuff, like on the majestic closer \"Xenoverse Discharger\". These guys have turned into one of the most interesting tech-death bands out there, blending their downtuned bone-rattling extremity with epic kosmische electronics and the result sounds like nothing else. Exodromos comes highly recommended to fans of everything from latter-day Gorguts to Ulcerate and the sci-fi death metal of Nocturnus, Demilich and Timeghoul.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : WORMED-Exodromos (BLUE VINYL)\n\nSample : WORMED-Exodromos (BLUE VINYL)\n\nSample : WORMED-Exodromos (BLUE VINYL)\n\nGRIEF Depression 12\" (Fuck Yoga) 18.98\n\nDepression IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nGEROGERIGEGEGE, THE Senzuri Fight Back 7\" VINYL (Turbine Industries) 12.99\n\nSenzuri Fight Back IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nCELTIC FROST Danse Macabre 5 x CD + BOOK BOXSET (Noise) 89.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCONTROLLED BLEEDING Distress Signals I 2 x LP (Artoffact Records) 40.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFUOCO FATUO The Viper Slithers In The Ashes Of What Remains CASSETTE (Caligari) 5.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFULL OF HELL + MERZBOW Sister Fawn LP (A389 Records) 19.99\n\nSister Fawn IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nThat second disc that appeared with the skull-shredding collaboration between Baltimore grindbeasts Full Of Hell and Japanese noise legend Merzbow has finally made its way to vinyl. That double disc album that originally came out on Profound Lore was one of the fiercest fusions of extreme electronic noise and metallic chaos to come out that year; the Sister Fawn recording that followed the album proper was an interesting shift in sound, transforming the frenzied grindcore into something much more abstract.\n\nWhile the Sister Fawn disc was initially presented as something more of a companion piece, it actually holds up wuite nicely as an album all on its own. In fact, I gotta admit I thought this material is even cooler than the first half of their collaboration. Over the course of these five tracks, much of Full Of Hell's screeching grindmetal becomes absorbed into a cacophonous wall of industrial violence, their metallic aggression subsumed into Merzbow's swirling, screeching nebula. The tracks are longer, venturing into pummeling industrial junk-metal rhythms and howling feedback manipulation, blasts of crushing power electronics and more of that abject Swans-esque dirge that appeared on the first half. And squalls of apocalyptic jazz-infected noise erupt across tracks like \"Crumbling Ore\", delivering an acrid blast of sound that approaches Borbetomagus-like levels of intensity. The grindcore elements are still in here though, particularly on songs like the noise-damaged blast-assault of \"Merzdrone\" that welds a seemingly endless blastbeat to Merzbow's scorching electronics and shrill skulldrill distortion. The result is ferociously and psychedelic.\n\nIssued in a one-time pressing of one thousand copies on black vinyl.\n\nSIMONETTI, CLAUDIO Opera (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) LP (Rustblade) 44.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nWINDHAND self-titled (2023 REISSUE - VIOLET EDITION) 2 x LP (Relapse) 28.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nRelapse recently reissued this 2011 masterwork of psychedelic doom, originally out from Forcefield Records. But this revamped 2023 edition of Windhand's dreamy graveyard crawl has undergone a major overhaul, virtually to the point where it's a different release. I listened to my original Forcefield CD and compared it to this, and the re-mastering by the legendary Jack Endino has transformed the sound immensely - it has this huge cavernous depth that's really noticeable to me. I still love the withered, roughened spookiness of the original release, but this one is packing some considerable extra power. Not only that, but both the new CD and vinyl editions of Windhand's eponymous debut feature more than half an hour of bonus material that'll feed the fix for any hardcore Windhand fanatics. And this also features brand new artwork from the masterful Arik Roper, which enfolds the album in an even more ghoulish visual atmosphere.\n\nHere's my original take (lightly edited) on the five-song album proper (\"Black Candles\", \"Libusen\", \"Heap Wolves\", \"Summon The Moon\", \"Winter Sun\"):\n\nSo, here's where it all started for this remarkably popular doom metal outfit from Richmond, VA. It's easy to see what it is that caught everyone's ear with these folks, though, as Windhand skillfully capture the spirit of classic American doom metal while producing some really well-written songs with real staying power. And of course the presence of lead singer Dorthia Cottrell is a large part of their appeal as well, her bewitching, bluesy voice imbuing these lumbering Sabbathian dirges with a strange and earthy dark magick. They've received all kinds of accolades from the metal community since this album came out, which was followed buy a number of high-profile releases on Relapse Records. In my opinion though, Windhand has never sounded better than they did on this debut. It really takes something special to stand out amongst the hordes of Sabbath / Vitus-worshiping doom bands out there. While there's no mistaking the influence of those pioneers on Windhand's music, they twist that grim, despairing sound into something that feels both more personal and more unique, adding an extra heavy dose of psychedelic malevolence to their dark, mournful atmosphere. The guitarists bring a hefty amount of ultra-heavy droning power to the riffs, without sacrificing any of that hypnotic tone, and Cottrell's witchy moan drifts languidly and imposingly across it all, powerful and phantasmal, her deeply soulful wail echoing through a haze of reverb, having this far-off quality, rising like the smoke from a bonfire of dried, withered Eastern Redbud limbs burning low somewhere in the distance, hanging over the pulverizing psych-doom of songs like \"Libusen\" and \"Summon The Moon\". Great stuff.\n\nWith that striking vocal performance, the wrecking-ball-heavy grooves of the rhythm section of Nathan Hilbish and Ryan Wolfe, and the howling twin guitars from Asechiah Bogdan and Garrett Morris, Windhand's molten blacklight vibe becomes all-encompassing. The songs shift from menacing, insanely slo-mo heaviosity to some supremely brain-melting moments of jet-black space rock madness that emerge deeper into the album, where trippy Hawkwindian effects and cosmic guitar noise sweep across the pulverizing bluesy groove. Like the epic twelve-minute closure of \"Winter Sun\", which features guest vocals from Drew Goldy of RVA black metallers Bastard Sapling. Those are by far my favorite moments on Wimdhamd, delivering a picture-perfect combination of titanic riffage and sky-climbing delirium, the cumulative sound of the band achieving something so heavy and mesmeric, dark and threatening, everything steeped in a sort of rural dread that's echoed in the Appalachian ghostliness of the lyrics. Of course, all of this is what you'd probably expect from this kind of band, but Windhand do it better than most, one of the few bands I've heard that has succeeded in tapping into the same black energy as early Electric Wizard, while sounding utterly \"Virginian\" at the same time. Highly recommended if you're a devotee of the slow and low.\n\nThe bonus tracks are hidden early gems from the Windhand vaults. You get versions of \"Heap Wolves\" from their 2009 Practice Space demo and \"Black Candles\" from the Sound Of Music demo from the same year; both recordings have earlier drummer Jeff Loucks on the kit. Raw and rumbling. There's a remixed version of the song \"Amaranth \" from their split with Cough; this had previously shown up on Rue Morgue Magazine's 2012 Hymns From The House Of Horror III compilation. And the last two songs \"Black Candles\" and \"Winter Sun\" are pulled from a 2010 practice space demo. The practice space recordings and early demo material sound remarkably good, capturing that gritty, sinister vibe of the original version of the first album. It's all as pulverizing as anything you've heard from them.\n\nACTUARY / GNAW THEIR TONGUES split LP (Black Horizons) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nTwo Crucial Blast alumni teamed together for this solid split LP that came out in 2016 on the excellent Black Horizons label, with both bands belting out some bleak, intensely abrasive blackened noise dredged out of the sonic Styx.\n\nUnsurprisingly for anyone who's already borne witness to the often nightmarish electronic hellscapes that LA-area noise vets Actuary has previously unleashed, their material on the A-side of this record is suffocatingly dark and oppressive stuff. The two tracks (\"A Grand Tradition Of Overreaction\" and \"Concrete Outings \") each unfurl into huge swathes of rumbling machine noise and unnerving mewling drones that are further strafed with bits of malfunctioning high-voltage electronics, merciless junk-noise avalanches, screams of crushed computer hard drives, ultra-heavy low-end klaxon-like blasts, huge swells of violent, distorted throb and constant surges of immense, ravenous deep-space gamma-static. These guys have always worn their Bastard Noise influence proudly on their sleeve, and that style of fearsome psychedelic electronic overload pervades the entire side. All of their elements congeal into a roiling, fearsome, rhythmic mass of sound, hinting at times at the occult cosmic ambience of classic outfits like Herbst9 and Inade, while also emitting a hideous harsh-noise noise element that moves this into a far more abrasive and alien direction. The dread level is high here, every moment swathed in a strange apocalyptic vibe that both mesmerizes and discomforts, their controlled, heavy-as-fuck chaos issuing deadly levels of radiation.\n\nGnaw Their Tongues counters with an interesting blend of field recordings, free-form clatter and stygian ambience over on his side, with ululating voices and raucous shouting that at first manifests as feeling like you are racing through the dimly-lit back alleys of a Moroccan marketplace, but then quickly locates and plunges through a jagged hole in the earth as \"Blood Rites Of The Hex Temple\" descends through a black-fog delirium of dreadful orchestral brass, insectile percussion, whirring noise and booming tympani. Like some ketamine-fueled night-terror that is scored by a collaboration between Ligeti or Penderecki and Nurse With Wound, the rest of the side continues to unfold into an utterly chilling likeminded symphony of dread, as \"Into The Fire Thou Servant of Pain \" and \"As Above So Below\" spread out with blasts of dissonant and terrifying orchestral sound, gurgling murky electronics, swathes of witchy, screechy violin sections, groups of ceremonial chanting voices, tribal beats, and endless torrents of AMM-esque improvisational drumming, only later becoming possessed by the gibbering demonic shrieks that are Mories' trademark with this project. The use of acoustic sounds, freeform clatter and field recordings set this apart from what you might expect from a Gnaw Their Tongues experience. It's more of the band's signature sound, overwhelming and dense and abstract, and thoroughly hellish.\n\nVery nicely presented with a beautifully laid out and minimalist visual aesthetic, using some really striking landscape photography to match the desolation that was undoubtedly left in the wake of this recording. Limited to three hundred copies.\n\nCONTREPOISON Discography 2010-2012 2 x LP (Hospital Productions) 24.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAGHAST Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis CD (Eternal Pride) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFinally back in stock!\n\nThere was lots of strange musics that appeared on the periphery of black metal in the early 1990's, projects that were intrinsically linked to the black metal scene in one way or another but whose music didn't sound anything like actual black metal, at least not the kind of black metal that was becoming popular in the extreme metal underground. One of the best and most obvious examples of this kind of necro-mutation continues to be Abruptum, whose mix of deformed improvised riffing and crawling dungeon ambience went way over the heads of many fans of traditional Scandinavian black metal. Even more obscure was the band Aghast, a Norwegian duo of two women who only played together for a brief period of time and released just one album during their short existence, a limited edition release called Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis that came out on the Swedish industrial label Cold Meat Industry in 1995, and which has been an extremely difficult album to track down ever since.\n\nNot only did the ladies of Aghast come out of the early Norwegian lack metal scene, they were actually married to some of the most influential members of the scene at that time, Andrea Haugen (who would later go on to form the band Hagalaz Runedance) to Samoth from Emperor, and Tanja Stene to Fenriz from Darkthrone; you might also recognize Tanja Stene as the artist behind some of the iconic album artwork for Darkthrone, Burzum and Ulver from the early 90's, and it's safe to say that she's probably much more recognized for her contributions to early black metal art than her forays into ghostly black ambience. But Aghast's music is truly amazing stuff, and it was a crime that their album slipped into total obscurity for so long. At long last, Hexerei has finally been reissued, via Eternal Pride, and it's an amazing piece of nocturnal dread that fans of the more ambient ends of the avant-garde black metal spectrum, black ambience, and experimental horror film music will all fall in love with. The sound of Aghast is a mix of spectral, minimal synths, ghostly female vocals, and extreme layers of echo and other fx, but the way that Aghast shapes this sound into their mesmeric stygian drift is pretty unique. Heavy sheets of minimal low-end and swells of pulsating rumble drift slowly through expanses of vast emptiness, and above this dark ambience float dreamy female vocals, which vary from lusty narcotized moans to hair-raising witch-shrieks, echo-drenched chanting and demonic howls, like hearing Diamanda Galas leading a series of occult rituals in a huge cavern deep beneath the earth.\n\nThe music is sparse but chilling, with stretches of near silence opening up between the sounds of chimes and swells of orchestral strings, minimal violins and thick foglike ambience, everything obfuscated by a murky quality that gives the impression that this music has been moldering and decaying for years. Most of the music is without percussion, save for one track: \"Totentanz\", the most terrifying track on the album. Here, Aghast lay down a pounding tattoo of tympani drums that rumble beneath the sounds of wailing, laughing witches and processed strings, and it sounds a lot like the more percussive pieces from Goblin's fearsome soundtrack for Susperia, and I'd recommend Hexerei alone just for this awesome piece of psychedelic witch-ambience. But the whole album is fantastic, definitely very black and evil sounding and occulted, but unlike any other black ambient project that I can think of - really, the closest comparison that pops into my head when listening to Aghast is the creepy Japanese ghost-ambience of Onna-Kodomo, but the connection is more in spirit than actual sound. An amazing album of blackened dread and witchy ambience that is obviously highly recommended! Comes in a digipack featuring metallic silver print.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : AGHAST-Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis\n\nSample : AGHAST-Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis\n\nSample : AGHAST-Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis\n\nSample : AGHAST-Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis\n\nGEHENNA / BLEACH EVERYTHING Heavy Metal Suicide 7\" VINYL (Magic Bullet) 6.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nRIPPING CORPSE Dreaming With The Dead CD (Kraze) 10.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCORRUPTED / NOOTHGRUSH split LP (20 Buck Spin) 21.00\n\nsplit IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nCYBER-PSYCHOS A.O.D.

It's right there in the first fiew minutes that you can hear the early-Swans influence that more folks have been ascribing to Bestial Light, and when it all comes crashing down and that knuckle-dragging two-chord riff really takes over the joint and rubs your snout in the swill, it's tough to argue. Hardly a lick of the Hawkwindian / Acid Mothers Temple-esque cosmic wave-riding these guys dished out on the earlier Fuzz Club discs, but this is way more up my alley, naturally. That opening song has around six and a half minutes of some of the finest psychedelic scum-dirge that's skulked through this compound in a while.\n\nThat combo of sneering and sardonic post-punk, post-industrial clank, sauropod drum hammering, Iggy-on-'ludes ranting, and earth-shifting blasts of incredible atavistic heaviness keeps coming as you make your way through such sonic monsters as \"Piss Christ\" (which feels like the ugliest Birthday Party moments boiled down to an easily injectable hypno-trance), the dissonant clamor of \"Sacred Cunt Of The Universe\" that transmutes a hideous guitar chord and slowburn percussive power into stunning cinematic sprawl (with the group's psych roots really taking flight here, blazing and beautiful saxophone sounds ascending into the heavens while things turn all Floydian for a while), \"Eden In Reverse\" and its snotty snarl, once again two-note riff wrapped in bludgeoning bass guitar thud, scouring six-string atonality adding up to a perversely catchy hook that finally explodes into wild ferocity. But man, when these guys turn it around in a more atmopsheric and wondrous vista, they really knock it out; carefully layered among all that grueling sludgy dirge are a number of breathtaking sonic scenes that stop me dead in my tracks with each spin. The title track, though, materializes into a pure ritualistic drift of sound, echoing vocals and ominous droning synthesizers hovering in space for a bit before the album's most punishing No Wave-damaged power-dirge builds and builds and explodes into this almost militarized industrial-metal-esque battery that stretches on andd out, opening up at spots to let each of the musicians breathe within that monstrous staccato chug. After that it gets more relentless, the merauding bass slither ans sax squall of \"Self\" that shapes it into an unsettling personal (anti-)affirmation mantra, some more of that weird dusty twang emerging in \"Pleasure\" that warps the time signature into something even twitchier as that gives over to closer \"Levelling Dust\".\n\nKinda passes for an album from the cusp of the 80s/90s shift, which isn't a complaint on my end. I definitely dig the rawer and more spare production you give bands like this\n\nDrunkdriver, Brainbombs, Kilslug, Clockcleaner, early Melvins, maybe even fellow Dutchmen Gore to a smaller extent - a heavy vibe of ugly, difficult and damaged\n\nthat previous aggro \"space rock\" heard ion their excellent Subversive trilogy of albums was great stuff, the sort of lysergic, summoning sensory overload that's like the sort of thing the guys at Neurot often champion, but this divergence, either momentary or a sign of even mangier things to come, locked up with me at an almost genetic level\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Breeding\n\nSample : Levelling Dust\n\nSample : Sacred Cunt Of The Universe\n\nANGELA MARTYR The November Harvest CD (Avantgarde Music) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nDespite crafting some of the best \"doomgaze\" I've heard, Morgan Bellini's projects have been woefully under recognized, at least in my mind. His older work as Vanessa Van Basten was incredible, rivaling the sky-burning grandeur of Nadja with its massive melodic slowcore, blending the industrial-tinged pneumatic power of Swans and Godflesh while weaving various influences from classic darkwave, Teutonic psych / prog, Scadinavian black metal elements, and the \"post-metal\" (ugh, forgive me) crush of later Neurosis. Perhaps it was the band name (naming your band after a person, real or no, is usually a stumbling block for potential listeners), or the fact that Vanessa Van Basten were entirely instrumental. For whatever reason, even though one orf their later albums came out on the high-profile label Robotic Empire, the duo remained a cult entity. And that seems to be the case as well for Angela Martyr, again with the name, but this time a little more in synch with the feel and look of this slightly different band that's essentially a Bellini solo project. It's safe to say that if you are one of the few people who were as bewitched by Vanessa Van Basten as I've been, you may well connect with this semi-continuation of that kind of slow-motion, earth-moving, skull-crushing majesty. But it's pursuing that sound down a very different avenue. It's definitely something of a misfit on Avantgarde, a label best known for its, er, more avant-garde black metal offerings. If anything, this album shares some of that gauzy, glazed-over beauty you get from the stuff that comes out on the Avantgarde side-label Flowing Downward. In any case, 2016's The November Harvest is great stuff.\n\nTo date, it's the only album from the band. The label mentions the likes of Godflesh, Slowdive, and Dance Of December Souls / Brave Murder Day-era Katatonia as touch points for the music; as much of a hodgepodge as that might seem, it's actually pretty accurate once you get sucked into the monstrous undertow of Martyr's sound. Dissonant guitars ripple over the beginning of \"Deviant\" as it morphs into a dark, metallic gloom-pop melody, Bellini delivering his vocals in a droning, honeyed croon that meshes nicely with the driving heaviness and swirling sludginess; his multi-tracked vocals and sonorous tone slightly reminds me of a young Layne Staley crossed with a bit of Chino Moreno. That aforementioned black metal influence is so faint as to be almost imperceptible, heard in the swarming tremolo-picked guitar riffs that move in currents beneath the album's stately pace. Detuned guitars grind and lurch through the frequent time changes and sometimes angular songwriting. It's an arresting sound, dark and brooding, the drumming possessed of a somewhat industrial feel, and the overall sound is immense. The more I listen, the more I feel the spirit of the more imaginative and abrasive heavy alternative rock that was coming out in the early 1990s. Definitely a weird kind of lost nostalgia hovers over the album. But there's this pending apocalyptic atmosphere as well that clings to every crushng chord and soul-stirring lyric.\n\nSome of the songs feature guest performances: on \"Deviant\" and \"Serpent\", Bellini incorporates Valentina Soligo on strings (probably viola and violin, from the sound of it), to striking effect; for the songs \"Deathwish\" and \"Negative Youth\", he's joined by backing vocalist Igor Rojas, who assists with soaring, soulful harmonies with Bellini. Huge doom-laden grooves plow through \"Georgina\" and \"Deathwish\", the latter rumbling with killer guitar tone and strange, bluesy undercurrent even as it falls into an almost Jesu-like enormity. Darkening thunderclouds amass over each song. \"Serpent\" slips into even slower and more pulverizing downtuned heaviness, with the looming presence of funeral doom-like crush creeping through the gales of billowing guitar noise, which often expands into huge cloudscapes of dreamy distortion and looping noise. Time signatures become more complex on \"Negative Youth\" and \"On The Edge Of Next Time\" turns into a kind of industrial doom-pop with machinelike percussion and more of that funeral-doom guitar tone. At the end, the almost fourteen minute title track finale brings all of these sounds together into a massive industrial-tinged shoegaze / noise pop epic, with a midway detour into sprawling, lovely electronica, and it's awesome.\n\nActually, you know what? Do you miss the feeling you'd get from the expressive, textured rock of stuff like Hum, Failure, and Swervedriver? This brings it. Slower and much, much heavier, with the weight of a collapsing star, but man, it brings it.

With specific musical influences like Mercyful Fate and Black Sabbath fueling the sound of their eerie vision, the music on Head Of Night is total time-warp metal, transporting you to an alternate 1982 as soon as the opening strains of \"Ninth Tooth Of The Gravekeeper's Grin\" start to drift off the album. Out of all of the Paragon releases that I recently picked up, this might be my favorite alongside the latest Dimentianon. Packing in mood and might for nearly an hour, these folks hammer down twelve high-quality songs of haunted heaviness that are made all the more menacing thanks to the weird and witchy lead vocals of frontwoman Ameven. Her voice is tough, raw and unpolished, which I really dig, and materializes into all kind of angusihed moans and some surprisingly King Diamond-esque howls (the Mercyful Fate influence is pretty strong with these folks); those vocals are contrasted with more abrasive, gruff screaming from both her and multi-instrumentalist Matt Preston, amnd also drop some off-kilter harmonies here and there.\n\nThe album is a slab of primo throwback misery metal, and oh is crawling with riffs, massive riffs, galloping fast-paced riffs galore on stuff like opener \"Ninth Tooth Of The Gravekeeper's Grin\" (which sounds like it could have come off some little-known British 12\" import at the height of the NWOBHM, the heroic melodic leads screaming over their burly palm-muted power hymns. The track titles alone glow with occult mysstery and vintage horror visions (\"Secret Of Black Moss Lake\", \"House Of Wary Shadows\", \"Scroll Of The Lunar Tribe\") and that air of menace and darkness sinks into every song. And it blows my hair back when they suddenly downshift from that rapid-fire riffing and rocking tempo into some cavernois trad-doom heaviness, Ameven's husky singing rising over these killer church organ-style keys and swirling clouds of slow-motion spookiness. And those doom-laden moments are often crushing, with massive chugging, battering-ram riffs hitting like a sledgehammer. The proggier qualities become more and more apparent as you make your way through the album, encountering sudden, technical riff changes, a few wild time changes, extended lead guitar fireworks, passages of Hammond-esque sound and tricky effects-draped guitars and offbeat synth runs tangled on the instrumental \"Brooding Silence\" and maudlin closer \"Elegy Of Dreamtime\". All of that stuff floats quite nicely together, giving some ghostly ambience that surrounds the riff-fest and shredding that make up so much of Head Of Night and its rough, almost garagey production that also helps in giving it all an older, more classic early 80's sensibility. I'm usually a sucker for anyone that blends vintage trad doom and prog influences, and these folks deliver with their own gritty, slightly gnarly signature carved right into the heavy metal attack. Along with that obvious Fate element, the Tower is also reminiscent of cult heavy metallers Twisted Tower Dire, as well as touches of Judgement Of The Dead-era Pagan Altar, hints of Reager-period Vitus, and to a lesser degree, more contemporary femme-fronted doom metal bands like Witch Mountain and Windhand. And it sounds sincere as fuck, which goes a long way to endear this style of metal to me. The roughness of the vocals and Ghost Tower's odd proggy quirks and sometimes jarring stylistic shifts might be something of an acquired taste, perhaps. But if you're a fanatic for that aforementioned field of classic early 1980's power and majesty, man, this album's got it.\n\nThis Paragon CD reissue features an additional trio of songs at the end: a pair of songs recorded in 2010 (\"My Dear Killer\" and the weird experimental creepiness of \"Whispers From Beyond\"), and a 2008 demo track \"Sable Beldam\" that busts out some ripping lo-fi speed metal.\n\nOVO / CLAUDIO ROCCHETTI split 7\" VINYL (Wallace) 7.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nWhoah, here's another deep crate find of some older Ovo-relarted stuff, this Italian import pairs Ovo's avamt-garde sludge-punk / avant-metal with the occult soundscapery of Claudio Rocchetti. Both of these italian artists are pretty far from each other in regards to sound source, intensity, violence, etc.,\n\nPlease don't mind the kiddie-emo look of this 7\"s sleeve; the sounds engraved here are\n\nOvo's pair make me feel like I'm nodding off on allergy meds while the waste company is backing up their truck outside my window. It's in league with most of the duo's material that ends up on these splits: berserk, potentially unstable freakouts of unfettered cathartic expression, Stefania mixing together her haughty witchlike howl with fucking gross death metal-style guttural vomit. Musically you never know what you're getting; both of the Ovo songs are shiort, \"Carestia\" erupting into droning, noise-damaged bass-heavy and discordant sludge that lurches along violently until it all slams into a wall, while the cackling \"In A Corner\" at barely a minute and a half conjures a creeped-out ghostdrone vibe, atomizes into pure shriek, high-voltage electric buzzing, crushing blasts of glacial drums, but likewise ultimately going nowhere but thin air. Heavy? Yes. Improvised? Could be. These two always set my hair on end with everyt5hing I hear from them, so mission accomplished on that front.\n\nWhere this gets really intriguing is on the flip. The Claudio Rocchetti side is strangely copacetic with that grotesque and frightening avant-sludge on the first side. For almost five minutes, \"The Black Lake\" crumbles apart into a genuinely eerie-sounding electro-acoustic soundscape, one teeming with constant low-frequency electronic drones, fragments of minor-key acoustic guitar, , seemingly endless clusters of scrape and knock and rattle like a sudden rush of poltergeist activity during a doom-folk set, with some perfectly lovely female singing lilting over certain moments of the piece, an almost childlike, dazed tone to her voice as it seems to sync with those guitar chords for a moment, but then become untethered and adrift over the fields of microscopic, potentially malevolent acoustic noises. This feels like something that could have been shaped into a much longer, even more unsettling piece of abstract sound, so yeah, I'm definitely going to be on the lookout for more Rocchetti material after this. Oh, and the guy prints a quote from an Iron Maiden song in the insert, so that's neat.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : OVO - Carestia\n\nSample : CLAUDIO ROCCHETTI - The Black Lake\n\nMARCH VIOLETS, THE Play Loud Play Purple: Complete Singles 1982-1985 & More 2 x LP (Jungle Records) 34.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCREMATION GROUNDS Abortion Sacrament 3\" CD (Crucial Blast) 9.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSimilar to the recent online-only (thus far) release of the long-thought-lost Cremation Grounds full-length Lord Of Nerves, the 20-minute EP Abortion Sacrament is another recording that was produced in the late 2000s and had been thought lost for fifteen years due to the destruction of the hard drive that contained the original masters. As part of a recent organizing effort here at Crucial Blast, almost all of these recordings were recently rescued from that cursed external drive, and have been resurrected and remastered for your listening displeasure.\n\nComing from one of the preeminent entities of the Order Of The Warhead, the three-track Abortion Sacrament EP is the very first release that Cremation Grounds recorded around 2008-2009, and like other recordings of the era, dislodges a bog-damn of insanely misanthropic black noise / heavy electronics, gruesome blown-out industrial sludge, crushing harsh-noise-wall style constructions, and an overdriven recording style that may well have been itself the cause of that hard drive's suffering and collapse. Again, the gist of these tracks is pure in-the-red evil electronic obliteration, much of it crafted by the entities behind Cremation Grounds as a kind of \"meditation through abomination\" strategy, utilizing the recordings for deep meditative sessions typically accompanied by sacred entheogens, assorted psychedelics (both natural and otherwise), acts of self-debasement and self-abuse, extended scatalogical ritual, and the disintegration of the ego in the churning jet-black oceans of searing distortion and low-end rumbling rot that dominate the sessions.\n\nAbortion Sacrament does not have quite as much of the molten scum-dirge that is found on the Lord Of Nerves full-length. But these three tracks make up for it in all-out sense-wrecking chaos and over-modulated electronic violence. Drums, vocals and percussion all exist within the roiling black-static detonations of the title track and \"Spread Wide Upon Her Cremation Grounds (Adorned In Bone Ornaments)\", but they have been destroyed completely by walls of crumbling, crackling electronic distortion, with the occasional muffled roar of guttural, monstrous vocalizations breaking through the carnage.\n\nAs with the album, this material skews hard towards the harsh noise / black noise end of the sound spectrum, but likewise takes a great deal of inspiration from the diabolic filth of ancient, dissolving Finnish black/death demos. This sonic abhorrence crawls before the cracked and damaged altars of Macronympha, the no-fi bestial hiss of the earliest Beherit demos, classic Japanese noise a la Pain Jerk and Incapacitants, and the aura of eighth-generation dubs of Archgoat rehearsal tapes, all grown together into a swollen, pulsating, cancerous mass of cacophonous horror.\n\nThe EP is available on 3\" CD in DVD-size packaging, hand-numbered in an edition of 90 copies. Sacrament is also available on audio cassette in a limited run of 100 copies, with a bonus tape-only track on the B-side titled \"Enfolded In The Engorged Lips Of Kali\", another nineteen-minute harsh blackened heavy electronics meditation that was recorded around 2010. Both the 3\" CD and Cassette versions of Abortion Sacrament include full-color inserts and a vinyl Cremation Grounds sticker.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Spread Wide Upon Her Creamtion Grounds (Adorned In Bone Ornaments)\n\nSample : They Will Make Cemeteries Their Cathedrals And The Cities Will Be Your Tombs\n\nSample : Abortion Sacrament (Devil Rite)\n\nCATHEDRAL The Ethereal Mirror CASSETTE (Earache) 9.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAN ABSTRACT ILLUSION Woe 2 x LP (Willowtip) 33.99\n\nADD TO CARTADD TO CART\n\nL7 The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum LP (Real Gone Music) 27.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Lorenza, Giada, Alessandra\n\nSample : Must Have More\n\nSample : Bad Things\n\nSCHULZE, KLAUS Next Of Kin (OST) LP (Roundtable) 36.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nA cult slab of Berlin School horror-electronics that was recently issued in tandem with a new Blu-ray release of the film, which I have actually yet to see. I've certainly known about it, though; 1982's Next Of Kin has built up quite the buzz amongst horror film aficianodos in the past, earning a reputation as a tightly-made and atmopshere-heavy psychological horror film. Some circles have even referred to it as an Australian take on the giallo genre, but with heavy doses of chilly, spare ambience a la Kubrick's The Shining. I can't wait to see it, obviously. But this long-awaited vinyl edition of the original soundtrack is pretty enjoyable on its own, and a no-brainer for fans of Klaus Schulze's work.\n\nThe background to this soundtrack is one of the most convoluted things i have ever read.\n\nAs it stands, the music here is exemplary. The title theme pairs droning synth and a steady snare / kickdrum backbeat to excellent minimalist effect, a sorrowful minor-key melody taking shape over the course of the track. It exudes a powerful mounrful moodiness from the start. Synth-strings emerge as more expressive tom rolls and polyrhythmi"
