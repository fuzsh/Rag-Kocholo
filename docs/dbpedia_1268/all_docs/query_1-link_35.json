Productions) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nMan, if there's a record that I've picked up recently that just screams \"outsider metal\", it's this collection of recordings from an obscure Bulgarian band called Oberon. Nuclear War Now put this out a little while back, gathering together the band's 1993 Liquid Metal, all of their recorded material glued together with vomit, over-the-top blasphemy, and a totally batshit approach to songwriting and atmopshere. This stuff is nuts. Just from the sleeve art and the structure of the first song \"Devil's children\", it is obvious that these guys had been spendinh an inordinate amount of their free time listening and worashipping the jmusic of OG Satanic rippers Venom, working to channel that primitive black thrash sound and hellish imagery into their own frantic vision. Some of the classic early NWOBHM stuff clearly had an effect on them as well, as certain elements of that sound crop up here and there on songs like \" Hell Awaits You\". So far, so good, so slaytanic. But as you progress through these fourteen songs, something starts to sound increasingly wrong and warped, you realize that the guitar and bass sound inordinaztely blown-out and overmodulated, like they are being lined in directly to the recording deck. And then \"Guts Of Death\" comes on and it's this freaking whacked-out major key prog-punk type thing mixed with some more sloppy thrash / speed metal , screaming guitar solos that sound like they could have tumbled off an errant Molly Hatchet record, and those gross gurgling shrieks that occupy just about every corner of this record. By this point, I'm in love - within four songs, the dudes in Oberon have completely electrocuted my brain.\n\nAnd it's on from there to pretty instrumental guitar arpeggios blossoming into insane necrotic thrash that constantly sounds on the verge of falling apart, then jumping into these vicious mid-tempo mosh breaks, more bursts of freakazoid heavy metal shredding and barbaric blasting drums, the songs starting and stopping in often seemingly arbitrary points. With all this going on, it all sounds legit menacing too, even with those bizarre almost poppy parts that spring up every few songs. At it's core, this is primitive Venom worship but filtered through the depraved minds of these young guys, that underlying lo-fi blackthrash tearing through the bulk of the collection. It's just so undeniably weird, I mean really weird, delivered through a mixture of energetic but inexperienced instrumental prowess and a coompleteky zonked-out feel for how to write a song. The results are glorious. Now that I think about, it dawned on me that I originally learned about these guys after reading about 'em on the ever-awesome \"Noise Metal\" list put together by one \"MarsHottentot\"' on the RateYourMusic.com site, a list that's at this piint like some kind of lost biblical text for me , a kind of \"Nurse with Wound list\" for addicts of the most berserk, low-fidelity fringes of underground metal over the decades. It's crucial, and these guys belong on it. \"Deceiver\" is an insane blast of noisecore-esque ultra-chaos with crazed widdly shreddin, yet another wild diversion alongside the accidental prog bits, mutated formless thrash, brain-damaged erratic dirge workouts, long bouts of freeform screaming and gibberish, moments where it sounds like the whole band is trying to perform in the midst of a 7.0 earthquake; shit goes completely mental on the song \"Liquid Metal\", where it sounds like the guitarist is attempting to play the main riff from Metallica's \"Seek & Destroy\" while everything else is this fucked-up, sludgy lurching mess that feels like a largely improvised goon-punk freakout a la Kilslug or something. Looking at the notes , it states that this berserk chaos comes from the band' s \"Nine Circles Of Hell\" rehearsal tape recorded in March '93 in a local community center - imagine, if you will, a four-track collision of Witching Metal-era Sodom , Drunks With Guns, and Hanatarash. These recordings feel a bit like that. This stuff has apparently never been previously released, and it is brain-glazingly nuts. I'm talking about a Shaggs-like approach to speed/thrash, they've got the energy and aggression in spades, but the delivery comes out completely unique and disconnected, and thus inadvertantly brilliant. At least for me. Nuclear War Now mentions the far-away but like-minded strangeness of the Colombian \"ultra metal\" likes of Blasfemia, Parabellum, and Reencarnación, and that's pretty accurate as far as letting you know just how fucked up and psychotic Oberon's music is. Not for those seeking sanity in their metal, for sure. One of the best things I've experienced lately, I can tell you that.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : ��5F0 =0 4O2>;0\n\nSample : ��\"5G5= <5B0;\n\nSample : ��'8AB8;8I5\n\nSUNLESS Ylem LP (Willowtip) 24.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCHOP SHOP Recycled Music Series CASSETTE (RRRecords) 4.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Recycled (1)\n\nSample : Recycled (2)\n\nSample : Recycled (3)\n\nMORBID OPERA self-titled CASSETTE (TPOS) 6.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Love Is Death\n\nSample : Sledgehammer\n\nSample : War Dream\n\nTIR Mountains CDR (Elegy Records) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nHIGH NOON KAHUNA Killing Spree CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 10.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAs of early 2023, the band High Noon Kahuna is firmly in my personal list of my three best-loved, absolutely favorite local bands. I could be accused of a certain amount of bias, seeing as how I've been friends with some of the members of this band for over thirty years. But it's really about how strongly this band scratches my itch for bitchin' noise rock. And these guys dig at it like it's 1994. A full-on POWER trio, the Kahuna crew include dudes who have done time in some local institutions like seminal Maryland doom metal outfit Internal Void and mangy math-rockers Admiral Browning, as well as lesser-known but no less bangin' operations like the electronic-damaged slowcore duo Black Blizzard and the cult art-punks Vox Populi from West Virginia. So there's a lot of experience being funneled into this band.\n\nThe American post-punk vibe reverberates beneath everything these guys do, but that cymatic force arranges their pieces into new and energetic shapes. When thinking about how to describe High Noon Kahuna, the best I have been able to come up with is asking you to imagine the following brew: merge the raucous, ascerbic wit and muscular stage presence of God Bullies with a heavy smattering of early Sonic Youth, back when that latter band was still in the same zip-code as the NYC noise-skuzz crowd; add to that already-pungent mix a huge dose of bulldozing Melvins-level drone-crush that enters zones of eruptive metallic crunch just when you're not expecting it, and a chronically wicked guitar attack that is touched (in the head) by the cumulative energies of Dead Kennedys's East Bay Ray, vintage O.G. surf licks a la Dick Dale and Eddie Bertrand, and just a dank whiff of second wave black metal. All at once.\n\nSince they've started hitting the live circuit en force, the \"surfy\" aspect seems to be something that some people have focused on, but that's just one strand of the DNA; High Noon Kahuna are more brooding, soulful, and battering-ram heavy than you might otherwise guess, with a rhythm section ready to drive you into the dirt like a rusted nail. Take it from me, these guys rule. If it was indeed 1994, this band would have already been added to the Amphetamine Reptile roster in a heartbeat. Bit it's not, and they aren't, so we've got the goods. Come and see. Come and hear. The band self-released their debut full-legth album Killing Spree earlier in 2022, but with some brief touring on their horizon and my ongoing lust for analog, they've partnered up with Crucial Blast to deliver this audio cassette edition of the album. Not just that, but an entire half-hour-plus mass of sound on the b-side called \"Foreshadowing Vol. I\", a slammin' sound-collage of songs-to-be, tape-noise antics, crushing riff-workouts, and nascent hooks that can only be heard by playing the flipside of this particular little infernal machine.\n\nThis limited-edition cassette is released in a run of one hundred copies, with full color tape art on black shells.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Sand Storm\n\nSample : Black Lodge\n\nSample : Parachute\n\nCATHEDRAL The Carnival Bizarre CD + DVD (Earache) 15.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nLimited 2008 two disc (CD + NTSC/Region 0 DVD) release of the Metal band's third album including a bonus DVD (entitled Our God Has Landed) that contains a live show from 1992 plus eight promo video clips. Originally released in 1995, Carnival Bizarre proved to be arguably the defining document for the band. The album bridges the gap between the gritty Doom of the band's earliest recordings with the vibrant catchiness and quirkiness which became the band's trademark. Cathedral were formed by ex-Napalm Death vocalist Lee Dorrian and ex-Acid Reign guitarist Garry Jennings. Features a guest appearance by Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi on 'Utopian Blaster'. The package comes housed in a double CD jewel case and offers an essential slice of Metal history in one complete audiovisual set. 23 tracks.\n\n\" - label description\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : CATHEDRAL-The Carnival Bizarre\n\nSample : CATHEDRAL-The Carnival Bizarre\n\nSample : CATHEDRAL-The Carnival Bizarre\n\nLORD KAOS Thorns Of Impurity CD (Nuclear War Now! Productions) 13.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nALLIN, GG Freaks, Faggots, Drunks & Junkies LP (Aware-One Records) 16.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNow also available in a limited-edition 2022 \"shit mix” colored vinyl edition for all of you distinguished aesthetes out there.\n\nIn 2016 year of our lord, it's almost unfathomable that this rare beast could have once stalked the face of the earth. But when I need a real social palette cleanser, I turn to the late 80s GG Allin stuff. And this motherfucker is top of the pile, one of the filth-king's rattiest and nastiest albums. The fifth album from Allin and originally released on Gerard Cosloy's Homestead Records, Freaks captures the beast during my favorite period of his career: with this particular expression of his monstrous Id, Allin enlisted the talents of Bulge, who otherwise belched out a couple of rippin' thrashcore releases on Ax/ction and Fudgeworthy in the early 90s, and who featured members of Gonkulator, Jesus Chrust, and Psycho. Bulge's drummer Charlie Infection had already previously worked with Allin by including the song \"I Wanna Suck Your Cunt\" on the Welcome To Ax/ction Island compilation. Bulge was a relatively tighter, more \"stable\" band compared to Allin's previous backing group, so the team-up made sense.\n\nThat said, this album is a warzone: a pitch-shifted GG lays down the law with the spoken word intro \"My Revenge\", then throws us headfirst into a nineteen-song orgy of drug-damaged blues riffs and monstrously fucked-up hardcore punk. His vocals sound totally scorched here, like the man has been swilling gasoline in between vocal takes. \"Be My Fuckin Whore\"' offers a litany of degradation and misogynistic abuse set to primitive hardcore, with some almost Greg Ginn-level guitar warp going on when it rips into a solo, followed by the thirty-second noisecore-esque blast-chaos of \"Suck My Ass It Smells\". \"Dog Shit\" delivers what is possibly my favorite line from the guy, \"...Get the fuck outta my bread line...\", and that general mean-spirited, ragged hardcore attack makes up the bulk of Freaks.\n\nOther scorchers include sickoid mid-tempo rippers like \"Anti Social Masterbator\" (sic)and \"Last In Line For The Gang Bang\" that collectively climb right into your head and won't leave. You've got a nod to David Allan Coe via \"Outlaw Scumfuc\". And with the messed-up and overtly brain-damaged moments like the lumbering, tuneless skull-beating on \"Wild Riding\" and \"Crash & Burn\" , Allin and crew puke up a kind of Flipper / Kilslug / Black Flag-style scum-dirge that's swarming with gruesome guitar skronk, grating atonal synthesizer, go-nowhere sludgepunk riffing, and some of the more unsettling and orgasmic vocals we've heard from Allin. Goddamn awesome stuff. The closer \"My Bloody Mutilation\" is a drawn-out, industrial nightmare, a fog of clanking, metallic atonality and tortured invective screams, raving madness set to a oily black shimmer of deformed ambience, almost Abruptum-like in it's sheer abject hideousness. But if I had to give you just one reason to pick up this atrocity, it's the song \"Die When You Die\" (actually itself a sort-of cover of Destroy All Monsters's proto-punk classic \"You're Gonna Die\" ), a perfectly formed piece of anti-social, anti-human punk rock that has gone on to be covered by countless punk and black metal bands in the decades since. It's one of the greatest Allin songs of all time.\n\nBottom line is this- fans of fucked-up and demented 80s' hardcore who haven't heard this stuff are missing out. This is hanging out on the most terrible fringes of hardcore. The height of anti-social art-psychosis and chaos-invocation in the latter half of the 1980s. The Freaks album could sit nicely alongside other albums that I would term \"outsider hardcore\", in spite of some probable pushback from members of the punk scene. But GG and the Bulge beasts were not interested in working within the parameters of the then-current hardcore scene. This is so much more transgressive, more bizarre, more genuinely deranged and incontrovertibly misanthropic, more dissident and self-destroying in every possible way. Allin himself considered this album to be one of the best of his career. A sodomatic , Dionysian immolation rite, pursuing ultimate physical transcendence in a manner not unlike the Aghori sect. And man, nobody ever came close to hustling the way that GG did. It's a sight and sound to behold. Everyone else was performing theater. This was the real deal.\n\nDEAD MEADOW Force Form Free LP (Blues Funeral) 25.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : The Lure of the Next Peak\n\nSample : To Let the Time Go By\n\nSample : Force Form Free\n\nPRIMITIVE KNOT Undying Lands CD (Phage Tapes) 10.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nTHEOLOGIAN + BLACK SUN Black Fire Theology CDR (Annihilvs) 8.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCULTIC Whip Seduction (EXTRA LARGE) SHIRT (Crucial Blast) 20.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nReleased alongside the skull-stomping new Seducer (Expanded Edition) EP, the Whip Seduction shirt features a stunning, brand-new design by Cultic drummer and acclaimed illustrator Rebecca Magar. This design is exclusive to Crucial Blast, and features what could well be my favorite art from Rebecca / Wailing Wizard to date - for real, I'm possessed by an overwhelming impulse to get this tattooed on my person. Perfectly capturing the sleaze, filth, and carnal violence of Cultic's brand of atavistic, dungeon synth-soaked death metal, it's also one of the coolest designs that we've released over here at C-Blast. This is a highly quality three-color print courtesy of our collaborators at Forest Passage Printing, available on black 100% cotton Gildan garments.

CD (Avantgarde Music) 18.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThere are certain things that grab my attention when it comes to discovering new bands and artists. I try to pay attention to several outstanding Youtube channels that post amazing demos, and Bandcamp releases from bands I've never heard of. Sometimes, I'll be searching through Metal-Archives.com for research, and I'll end up chasing some killer obscure act from Slovenia down a deep and twisting rabbit-hole. And when I'm working on Discogs, there's stuff that I see that will reach out and grab me by the throat. I'm obsessive about reading the \"Style\" line in band and release listings on that site. You never know what you might find.\n\nLike a band described as \"Prog Rock, Dungeon Synth, Funk Metal.\n\nAlright, you' got me. And thus I stumbled across a band called Vrajitor’s Tenebrarium, a new (I assume) Finnish band with one member, a guy called Lord Vechi Vrăjitor, aka Juuso Peltola, who also plays in the black metal bands Warmoon Lord and Argenthorns. Avantgarde pouts out a lot of wild stuff (the label name is there for a reason), and when I picked up this debut album, covered in gloomy, wizard's castle-style artwork and beautifully designed in six-panel digipak, I couldn't wait to hear this thing. OK, so the whole \"funk metal\" tag is clearly someone being cheeky, but what it is, is some of the best Goblin / Italian prog-rock inspired mutation I've ever heard. This bizarre band wears its influences on its flowing, wizard-robe sleeves, but adds on a whole new level of groovy weirdness that's really different from the other Goblin-influenced outfits I listen to.\n\nKissed by gloriously nostalgic synthesizers, the opener \"Et Mors Pallida Venebit\" unfurls waves of majestic Tangerine Dream-esque electronics, symphonic grandeur, and huge-sounding church organs, all folded together into this striking keyboard-heavy introduction inhabited by a female vocalist that sounds like she wandered in from the Celtic Frost Into the Pandemonium sessions. A short but killer blast of synth-drenched darkwave then leads into the similarly synth-heavy prog rock of \"Rubedo\", filled with lush acoustic strings and spooky arpeggios that have an odd Fabio Frizzi vibe even as the metallic power chords and booming percussion kicks in. When this really starts to rock, it's fuckin' awesome. \"Rubedo\" has this distinctly 80's spook-prog vibe that's unmistakable, conjuring memories of both Frizzi and Goblin, as well as the weird gothic prog of Jacula and Devil Doll. The way this stuff is layered together with the crunchy, metallic guitars and driving backbeat is just spot-on, man. It's really not at all what I was expecting at first; it's the best type of surprise. Heavy, funky, pseudo-Italian goodness, where Vrajitor breathes much power and magic into the eleven songs, laying down infectiously catchy hooks and a hard rock backbone alongside all of his spirited weirdness. Some righteous saxophone shows up on \"Black Frog\" next to delicious woodwinds in the background, more elegant acoustic strings on \"Lucus Horribilem Atque Pestilentem\" as it erupts into a kind of Blue Oyster Cult-meets-Goblin ecstasy; the album feels mostly instrumental, although those feminine vocals and some echoing, chant-like voices do pop up throughout the album. The keyboards get even more Claudio Simonetti-esque as it winds through the labyrinth of moody progressive rock, heavy, crunching riffs, and soaring dark melody, but Vrajitor succeeds in giving this its own unique character, nimbly avoiding being another retro-Goblin-influenced outfit and producing a full, sensual piece of music that (despite the obvious influences) stands on its own as an incredible and original slab of occult Italo-prog. Those Tardo Pede In Magian Versus-era Jacula and Antonius Rex influences are every bit as prominent as the other stuff as well , especially whenever Vrajitor lays on that heavy liturgical pipe organ. The sounds of bouzouki (again, shades of Goblin's Suspiria) and clarinet spread through many of the tracks. There's some great experimental atonality in a few tracks, particularly the pair of songs that close the album, \"Exorcismus\" and \"Semper Victimas Vult \", which wrap it all up with Gregorian-style chanting and an air of an arcane ritual ceremony. Stunning production, too. This album fills the air around me, with all of its intricacies and nuances. I also can't get over how much sax action is happening here, too - the winding jazzy convulsions of \"Volantes Castrum\" are one of the best on E.N.L.D., especially when the horn segues into some straight-up heavy metal guitar heroics, killer shredding matched by the wild onslaught of chamber strings, piano and whooshing synth. And it is indeed very \"funky\", the drumming performance propelling the songs forward into huge, massive grooves, eve sliding into stuff like the quasi-disco delirium of \"Sanitarium Son\".\n\nIt's the ultimate in 70's style \"spook-prog\", free of any kind of retro-irony. I can't stop listening to this. If you're as into the aforementioned bands as well as stuff like Daemonia, Anima Morte, Morte Macabre, Giallos Flame, and even older stuff like Sacrifice-era Black Widow and Halloween -era Outsider , this seriously gets the highest possible recommendation from me.\n\nBAD BRAINS Soul Music For Bad People 7\" VINYL (Mumboclaat Records) 9.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : How Low Can A Punk Get?\n\nSample : Re-Ignition\n\nRUDIMENTARY PENI Death Church (2022 Reissue) CD (Sealed Records) 12.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNew (2022) remastered reissue of the classic deathrock debut Death Church, presented in jewel case CD and on vinyl in big foldout poster sleeve. Here's my write-up, slightly edited, of the previous Outer Himalayan edition :\n\nThis classic slab of macabre Lovecraftian avant-punk is available again, remastered from the original tapes. Like the other recent Peni reissues, this is essential for anyone into dark, macabre punk, early death-rock, and occult-obsessed hardcore.\n\nIt would be very hard to overstate just how influential these albums have been on an entire class of bands that followed in their wake, and you can now hear echoes of Rudimentary Peni's spiky, angular punk and bubbling madness lingering on albums from all kinds of hardcore punk, avant-rock and even black metal bands. They have always been grouped in with the early 80's anarcho-punk scene that flourished in Britain, but aside from their early connections with the band Crass (having released their 1982 Farce 7\" on Crass Records), Rudimentary Peni had very little in common both musically and thematically with most of the other punk bands that they were associated with. Their music was so much darker and more enigmatic than almost anything else happening in British punk at the time, with much of the unique sound and vibe coming from front-man Nick Blinko, a visionary lyricist and artist who has struggled with mental illness and long periods of hospitalization throughout the bands entire career, and who brought his increasingly deranged visions of disturbing deformed characters, rampant paranoia, and withered horrors to the bands music, drawing influence from the works of H.P Lovecraft and the occult. For fans of dark, outre punk rock, the Rudimentary Peni records are absolutely essential; all three of the band's albums are crucial slabs of twisted, menacing rock, and even their EPs are minor masterpieces of macabre weirdness. They've never put out a bad record, and I actually think that their more recent stuff, while heavier and different from their classic early records, is just as amazing as their earliest, most legendary recordings. All are classic albums of malevolent weirdo punk, presented with complete lyrics and lots of Blinko's amazing obsessive pen-and-ink artwork.\n\nLike I've mentioned at length in my write-ups of the reissues of Archaic, Cacophony and Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric, Rudimentary Peni are one of my all time favorite bands from the 80's British punk underground, a band that was often associated with the UK anarcho-punk scene but who was in fact off on some weird cosmic-horror-tinged death-rock trip that was totally unlike anything else going on at the time. The band's debut album Death Church was wholly unique when it came out in '83, from front man Nick Blinko's nightmarish, obsessively detailed black and white album art to the bizarre song writing and morbid atmosphere that hangs over the bands music. The macabre pogo power of the opening song introduces Death Church's relentless buzzsaw punk assault, leading the charge for these twenty-one tracks of ripping rocking mid-tempo angular deathpunk, the songs comprised of simple four-chord riffs twisted into sinister angular hooks, the bass guitar bouncing like Peter Hook on cheap crank, Blinko's howling vocals the closest he ever came to a traditional hardcore-style delivery. The whole album has its gnarled and blackened roots digging deep into the rotting carcass of early 80s hardcore, but this ended up sounding unlike anything else in punk at the time thanks to Blinko's demented lyrical visions and bizarre artwork and the band's ferocious, pounding hypnotic buzzbomb punk. On some of these songs, the band even reveals a weird sort of proto-black metal sound on tracks like \"Poppycock\", with its furious tremolo picking and speedy assault; for fans of the current wave of blackened punk outfits like Malveillance, Bone Awl and the like, there are moments on Death Church that could possibly provide an epiphany. That signature strain of Peni weirdness abounds, of course, with some of their punk-shanty stuff showing up on other tracks like \"Vampire State Building\" and the sepulchral shimmy of \"Flesh Crucifix\", all infested with bizarre squealing cries and the dank stink of the tomb. Can't recommend this album enough.\n\nBEHOLD...THE ARCTOPUS Cognitive Emancipation CD (Hathenter) 15.99\n\nCognitive Emancipation IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nADD TO CART\n\nBOAR You Will Never Be Happy CDR (Breaching Static) 7.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Slick\n\nSample : Becoming Nature One Pill at a Time\n\nSample : Summing Up Everything That Went Wrong\n\nDIE KREUZEN October File CD (Touch & Go) 14.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Among the Ruins\n\nSample : On the Streets\n\nSample : Pain/ Sick People\n\nSample : Open Lines\n\nWHITEHOUSE The Sound Of Being Alive CD (Susan Lawly) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nHere's an odd one: this new full-lengther is presented as a kind of \"Best Of\" package that focuses almost exclusively on the 2000s-era output from the highly influential UK power electronics group Whitehouse, charting their arc of anti-human lunacy and digital savagery from approximately 1998 through 2007. All of the material on Alive has been released before in one form or another, so it's of limited use to any longtime fans that already have all of the original releases. But if you're a newcomer to Whitehouse's noxious, spellbinding skree, this nearly seventy minute compilation will get you up to speed pretty quickly on the brand of mega-distorted synth-hate that the duo of William Bennett and Philip Best were spewing across that decade.\n\nAnd as a primer for that partocularl period of the band's career, it works well; the twelve tracks are culled from a combination of 2003's Bird Seed, 2001's Cruise, 2006's Asceticists, 2007's Racket, and 1998's Mummy And Daddy, and include such hideuous post-millenial \"hits\" as \"Wriggle Like A Fucking Eel\", \"A Cunt Like You\" and \"Why You Never Become A Dancer\". By this point, their sound had mutated from the fairly simplistic early power electronics and excruciating feedback-hate of their early, 80's-era records into a heavier, more maniacal strain of noise, fusing their shrieking, transgressive rantings to a brutal squall of over-modulated electronics, blown-out tribal rhythms (an element that Bennett would later explore at further length with his Cut Hands project), and their two-pronged vocal assault that often tips over into unrestrained insanity. This is troubling and abrasive and confrontational extreme art, occasionally laced with moments of skin-crawling nightmarishness that appear on tracks like \"Daddo\" and \"Philosophy\".\n\nMURDEROUS VISION Life's Blood Death's Embrace CD (Live Bait) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNIGHTSTICK Death To Music CD (Relapse) 14.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGRIEF Dismal LP (Fuck Yoga) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nGRAVESIDESERVICE Popes Pears (REISSUE) CD (Church of the Immaculate Deception) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nDEATHROW Deception Ignored (Reissue) LP (Noise) 34.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCELTIC FROST Vanity / Nemesis (Deluxe Reissue) CD DIGIBOOK (Noise) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCONTROLLED BLEEDING Body Samples 2 x CD (Artoffact Records) 17.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nDIMENTIANON Dreaming Yuggoth CD (Paragon) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nMan, I love this band. You want to see a group of musicians pull off some wild sleight-of-hand with their sound? Dimentianon do just that with their latest album, the first in a dercade from these USBM iconoclasts. I had raved about the off-kilter, slightly prog-damaged blackened death of their Collapse The Void LP, an album that likewise took the black/death vibe and twisted and carved it into something unexpected. Well, Yuggoth does the same but in a completely different manner; I haven't seen much chatter about the album online, but this has got to be one of the wildest discs of 2021. I was originally drawn to these guys being a fan of their other bands, with one member doing time in Evoken, and a couple members manning the awesomely horrific underground doom outfit Rigor Sardonicous. After digging in to their older work, I've heard a band who has been in a state of constant violent flux with each new record, while remaining pretty commited to visions of cosmic horror and nihilism that move through the music on every record. The Lovecraftian-themed title of Dreaming Yuggoth is a giveaway for an even deeper push into nihilistic philosophy and jet-black cosmology, but tyhe lyrics offer something more intimately anguished and existential. No mere \"bestial\" blast with these guys, especially with this latest album.\n\nThe first time I listened to Yuggoth I thought I had them pinned down, with the beginning of the album exploding into a warblast of cyclonic black metal and deathdoom heaviosity. But with each song Dreaming Yuggoth shifts and turns on itself, a slow and deliberate move towards slower, almost gothic rock like arrangements that dominate the second half of the album. It's pretty brilliant listening, at first being flayed by the churning mass of black/death barbarism of \"Undying Bliss\" a rage of atavistic blastbeats and hypnotic, primitive riffing that cycles continuously. Kind of reminds me of the weirder latter day Beherit stuff, but only vaguely. But then the band emits clouds of symphonic-sounding synth into the otherwise monstrous, ascendent chorus, those keyboards filling the chaos with an unusual , majestic presence not often heard in this style of extreme metal. And an even bigger curve is thrown when the song melts down into eerie doom/death, a trudging, cadaverous procession. This growing atmopsheric and melodic feel builds as it proceeds to create an undeniably dark and anguished soundcape. \"Dwelling Into Madness\" unfursl into more ghostly death-doom spiked with those ethereal keys before erupting into murky blackened deathblast and swirls of carnivorous havoc. This killer combination of black metal, deathdoom, and strangely dreamy slo-mo periods of cello, glockenspiel, and synths takes the listener on a winding path of unearthly, catchy classic metal riffing, galloping tempos, ferodicous , almost punk-like bursts of mid-tempo disorder, the music swinging into ravines of massive death metal groove and bone-crushing chug, all assembled into off-kilter song structures and riff changes, and flashes of surreal, dissonant ambient keys that act like a toxic mortar for the band's relentlless attack. And the eleven somgs definitely deliver an assault, lead singer Mike Zanchelli spewing his hideous, almost monotone toad-croak with some seriously pissed-off sounding energy, and every riff and groove hammered into the earth with muscular, indomitable force.\n\nBut in the midst of this, a song meerges like \"Smoke Rising\" with its gleaming arpeggios and shimmering cymbals, backing choral voices rising as Zanchelli's menacing whisper drifts on pained eulogies. There's a notable shift here, as the album begins a transfiguration into more rocking, lyrical forms, the later songs sounding almost reminiscent of some early 90s gothic gloom like Lycia, a heavy darkwave vibe emerging and coalescing with the inherent heaviness and aggression; it's one of my favorite moments on Yuggoth. It gets even more intense as the ethereal, mournful atmopshere shifts again into a masssive doom dirge at the end, a simple, catchy hook grinding away at the light. There's more glimmering, dimly-lit gloom with the title track, a brief instrumental piece that unfolds into chorus-tinged guitars unwinding minor key sorrow over droning keys for a moment. There's also these great, melancholy baritone vocals from keyboardist Don Zaros that become another presence in Yuggoth's progression, contrasting nicely with Zanchelli's vicious blackened growl; that combo moves through the rest of the songs. This shift is unexpected and haunting, transforming \"Beyond The Scree\" and \"The Infinite Talisman\" into a kind of dark, withering, gnarled gothic rock underscored by the band's metallic power, the stately, world-weary mood and meditative groove evoking Fields Of The Nephilim's later work, the more accessible My Dying Bride songs, even some of Enslaved's more recent rock-influenced sound. That deep, yearning singing amid Dimentianon's abrasiveness definitetly reminds me of Eld-era Enslaved, but the comparison stops there. These guys craft all of this into something more harsh and erosive, finally moving from that ominous, gothy slowness into the most ruinous deathdoom of the album on \"The Path Less Travelled\", then closing with a piano and synth instrumental that's evocative of some old European folk song.\n\nThis album is epic. That mixture of black / death metal and deathdoom with those gloriously somber darkwave elements and how the band merges then together really turns the whole thing into something rather unique.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Undying Bliss\n\nSample : Smoke Rising\n\nSample : The Infinite Talisman\n\nMELVINS King Buzzo LP (Boner) 17.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThe latest to wash ashore in this recent flood of Melvins-related vinyl reissues, the band's trio of \"solo albums\" that came out on Boner Records back in '92 have all been resurrected on wax for the first\n\ntime in twenty years, featuring the original music and accompanied by a poster and digital download code. Here's our old review for this stuff from when we originally got 'em in stock:\n\nIf you've been following the Melvin's for awhile, you know that those dudes love KISS. They love 'em so much that back in 1992, the Melvins issued a series of three EP's, one from each member (King\n\nBuzzo, Dale Crover, and then-bassist Joe Preston) presenting their own EP of original solo material; the discs were totally modeled after the original KISS solo albums from 1978 in both look and concept, mimicking the same cover art\n\nstyle and KISS-logo lettering, making this part homage, part prank. These are now pretty hard to find, but are absolutely crucial to Melvins fans as each of the EP's are like a slide-section of the member's creativity, and all are\n\ntotally crushing and weird in their own manner.\n\nKing Buzzo's 12 minute disc is the closest of the three to what the Melvins were doing at the time; The opener \"Isabella\" appears with a heavy, repeated tom-heavy drumbeat and softly buzzing feedback drone, as a crumbling ultra-distorted guitar and Buzz's veiled vocals enter. \"Porg\" marries a percussive Industrial loop of heavy machine clang to droning distorted guitar noise and layers of demonically possessed moans. \"Annum\" appropriates part of the key riff from \"White Rabbit\" and crafts a tense, understated pop song. The final track \"Skeeter\" is like a sludge-metal comedy bit, with some guy narrating a tour story over a rolling crushing guitar/heavy drums metalpunk dirge. Who's the guy? It's actually Dave Grohl from Nirvana and Foo Fighters, who also played drums on this disc, going under the name \"Dale Nixon\" due to legal issues with Nirvana's label, Geffen.\n\nKULTURA KURENIJA (SMOKING CULTURE) Cold Wires / Cement CD (Maa Productions) 12.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAUROCH Mute Books CD (Profound Lore) 13.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Tipharethagirion\n\nSample : Say Nothing\n\nSample : Cup Of Hemlock\n\nBAND, RICHARD Ghoulies (Original Soundtrack) LP + 7\" (We Release Whatever The Fuck We Want) 36.99\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Bring Forth The Ghoulies\n\nSample : First Incantation\n\nSample : Main Titles\n\nCAMERON, JOHN Psychomania LP (Trunk Records) 26.98\n\nPsychomania IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE FOR ORDER\n\nFinally back in print on vinyl, just in time for the brand-new deluxe Blu-ray/DVD reissue that's coming out through Arrow Video.\n\nMostly known for reissues of deep-cut jazz/psych obscurities, British label Trunk Records had put out a couple of horror-related albums that I'd been wanting to get in stock for years, but which had gone out of print. One was the Dawn Of The Dead Unreleased Soundtrack Music compilation that features the obscure Music De Wolfe library pieces from Romero's apocalyptic zombie epic, and this, the sublimely sinister and psychedelic long-lost John Cameron soundtrack to cult classic British occult biker film Psychomania. In the hazy post-Hammer landscape of 1970's-era British horror cinema, Psychomania has always stuck out with its deranged tale of a hell-raising, devil-worshipping biker gang calling themselves \"The Living Dead\", and their ill-fated bid for immortality via toad-fueled necromancy and crazed supermarket carnage. It's a hoot, with numerous memorable scenes of nutty biker action, half-baked occultism, and some fantastic dialogue; no wonder it's been heavily referenced by fans of British black magic schlock like Electric Wizard and Satans Satyrs.\n\nDespite the film's cult following in horror/occult cinema circles, Cameron's Psychomania score was apparently never released in its entirity, with the only official release of music from the film being the two-song Witch Hunt / Living Dead 7\" that came out in 1973, featuring two key themes from the film performed by Cameron's ad hoc psych outfit Frog that was formed specifically for the score. That original 7\" alone has commanded some hefty prices on the collectors market, so it was great to have the entire score finally released by Trunk around a decade ago. Now back in print, we're getting this disc on our shelves for the first time, and get to revisit this bizarre soundtrack and its terrific low-fi psychedelic sleaze.\n\nFor Psychomania, Cameron enlisted a group of British jazz musicians (going by the aforementioned \"Frog\" name) to perform his macabre arrangements, performing a set of tracks that craft an uncanny, hallucinatory atmosphere that kick in like good blotter, a killer mix of fuzz-encrusted psych and avant-garde gothic creep. The wah-fueled evil psych that plays over the opening \"Psychomania Front Titles\" combines airy flute with some seriously skuzzy funk bass and an infectious shuffling groove, producing some cool sinister instrumental rock; from there Cameron continues to exude a druggy, delirious atmosphere that goes well with the hell-raising, devil worshipping insanity on the screen, moving from spooky gothic organ and mesmeric krautrock grooves to minimal drones and echoplex-drenched piano, dropping in some raunchy garage-rock numbers like \"Motorcycle Mayhem\", belting out wailing female choruses and whirling gusts of witchy weirdness, and there's even some menacing keyboard-streaked tracks of hypnotic progginess that recalls the likes of Goblin. Some of the more memorable dialogue from the film is scattered among the musical tracks, and there are some lighter moments amongst all of the macabre fuzz-guitar jams, like the eerie woodwinds and gently plucked strings that form the nocturnal balladry of \"Abby's Nightmare\", and the unmistakably 70's-era folk rock that shows up on \"Riding Free\", the only track on the album that features actual singing. Some of the tracks feature brief cues that run only a few seconds in length, but there's plenty of longer tracks as well to sink your teeth into.\n\nThe whole score was re-mastered for this release, but as label boss Johnny Trunk discusses in his liner notes, it was a tough job due to the deterioration of the original studio reels; that produces a bit of murk in the sound quality, but that's fine by me. It's still a highly listenable release that fans of the film should be greatly pleased with. The back of the sleeve features liner notes from composer Cameron, Trunk and someone named Jogoku, with Cameron describing how he utilized a variety of experimental recording techniques to create his unearthly sounds, from prepared piano noises to processed vibraphones and Hammond organs that he ran through a bank of effects units. A real blast, still one of the kookiest horror scores of the era, highly recommended for fans of vintage psych-creep and sinister experimental weirdness.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : CAMERON, JOHN-Psychomania\n\nSample : CAMERON, JOHN-Psychomania\n\nSample : CAMERON, JOHN-Psychomania\n\nSample : CAMERON, JOHN-Psychomania\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS On The Stub Of Fate New Life Will Not Grow CD (Deleting Soul) 11.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : VARIOUS ARTISTS-On The Stub Of Fate New Life Will Not Grow\n\nSample : VARIOUS ARTISTS-On The Stub Of Fate New Life Will Not Grow\n\nSample : VARIOUS ARTISTS-On The Stub Of Fate New Life Will Not Grow\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS Autocrine (K2 / RISARIPA / VIVIANKRIST) CD (Phage Tapes) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSIMONETTI, CLAUDIO Demons (OST - PURPLE MARBLE EDITION) LP (Rustblade) 34.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAvailable on LP (limited to six hundred sixty-six hand-numbered copies on blue vinyl), digipack CD, and a deluxe steelbox set.\n\n\"They will make cemeteries their cathedrals, and the cities will be your tomb...\" Thus goes the prophetic warning that heralds the onslaught of razor-taloned, pus-spewing 80's horror insanity that is Lamberto Bava's Demoni, or Demons as it was titled for the American release. Outside of his work with the legendary prog rock outfit Goblin, my favorite solo score from keyboardist Claudio Simonetti has always been his nutzoid work for this gore classic. One of the decade's most infamous splat attacks, Demons was a high-energy assault upon your eyeballs, setting loose an army of flesh-ripping, pus-spewing horrors upon the helpless patrons of a sinister Berlin movie theatre, and setting the ensuing carnage to an insane soundtrack that combined Simonetti's bombastic score with a raucous heavy metal playlist that included songs from Motley Crue, Saxon and Billy Idol. For his part, Simonetti used the sort of spiraling gothic synthesizers that marked his work in Goblin, but combined them with hammering drum machine rhythms and harsh, staccato orchestral stabs for something that at times almost sounds like a cross between Goblin and the brutalist electro-funk of Tackhead. While this killer score was finally released in full via a 2003 CD on label Deep Red, it's only now that Simonetti's Demons is being issued on vinyl as a standalone score as a 30th anniversary reissue, along with brand new, definitive CD editions that contain never before released material.\n\nAnd man, I love every aspect of this score, it's maniacal Euro-disco throb and pounding mid-80s electro and orchestral sounds that fuels so many of these pieces, funky and ferocious and hallucinatory all at once. The propulsive murderous hypno-rock of \"Killing\" that Simonetti fleshes out with a wicked ascending string arrangement that turns it into one of the best action pieces I've ever heard, and the bizarre tribal rhythms and staccato drum machines that power the weird Gothic electro-funk of the main \"Demon\" theme, with it's weird sampled vocal noises and an ass-shaking synth riff make another memorable piece. Elsewhere, he incorporates screaming heavy metal guitar solos with pulsating synth, or stretches of jazzy organ and soulful female vocals that subtly mutate that signature funky theme; some of this is very experimental, like the unsettling combination of industrial rhythms and dissonant orchestral samples on \"Cruel Demon\", or the swirling cyclical synthdrones of \"Threat\" that transform into a quick blast of discordant strings; glitchy melodic fragments are layered over deep Moog drones, and backwards-masked noises and strange edits that produce a disturbing effect. This score is so catchy that it works perfectly even completely separated from the gross visuals of Bava's cinematic nightmare; it's all very deliciously 80's, and there's definitely a few moments on here that are very reminiscent of Simonetti's later Goblin work from the 80s, but much of it resembles a more gothic take on the industrial funk of Tackhead, which may look weird on paper but sounds goddamn phenomenal to my ears. An excellent reissue of one of my favorite film scores of all time, a classic blast of 80's Italian hyper-splatter that I love so much I had to pick up every single version for my own collection.\n\nThe LP and CD versions of this reissue feature a bunch of bonus material, including \"Demon's Lounge\", an awesomely jazzy version of the film's main theme complete with Rhodes piano and soulful female singing; demo versions of several of the main tracks; an eerie demo version of the main theme played on electric piano; a KILLER breakbeat version of the main theme from Simonetti's Simonetti Horror Project album from 1990; and it' capped off with a seriously bizarre (and surprisingly burly) heavy metal version of \"Demon\" performed by Simonetti's prog-metal outfit Daemonia in LA in 2002. And for the disc, there are also a couple of Quicktime videos included on the CD version of 1985 Italian TV commercials for the original Demoni soundtrack release that RULE, along with some additional photo galleries.\n\nIn addition, the super-limited deluxe boxset has that digipack CD as well as a bonus CD that features the entire score remixed and radically altered by the likes of Ohgr (Skinny Puppy), Cervello Elettronico, Simulakrum Lab, The Devil And The Universe, :Bahntier//, Needle Sharing and Leather Strip, as well as additional tracks from Fangoria scribe and electronic musician Chris Alexander and Creature From The Black, and also incudes a metal Demons badge, a full color art insert, and a postcard reproduction of the Metropol ticket seen in the film, all housed in a hinged tin box and limited to four hundred ninety-nine copies.\n\nASTHAROTH Gloomy Experiments + Demos 2 x CD (Dark Symphonies) 13.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nI still have copies of the Polish import Metal Mind reissue that just features the album itself along with eight bonus tracks taken from the demos, and is beautifully packaged in a glossy digipak. The more recent Dark Symphonies reissue expands upon that with jewel case packaging and a 20 page booklet loaded with new liner notes, album and recording info, pics, and complete lyrics, but even more importantly, a second disc that is packed with demo, studio, and live material, much of which has never been previously released. Very nicely done. I myself had to upgrade to this one just because of the whopping 65 minutes of additional recorded material on a second disc.\n\nHere's my older review of the music from the Metal Mind reissue :\n\nAnother older Metal Mind reissue that I'm just now discovering, Astharoth's 1990 debut Gloomy Experiments is a lesser-known prog-thrash obscurity from this Polish outfit that I just recently discovered after reading about them on some \"weird thrash\" list someone had posted online. Being someone who can never get enough oddball thrash, I went looking for this album after seeing them described as an unusual Voivod-influenced outfit, and Experiments turned out to be a great discovery. This stuff is a highly confusional brand of progressive thrash metal, pretty wonky stuff actually, and additionally stands out for being one of the few European thrash outfits of the time to have a female lead guitarist (Dorota Homme), who also contributes vocally for a really unique and eclectic style.\n\nThese guys were obviously drawing heavily upon both the otherworldly, spaced out dissonance of Voivod and the pummeling Teutonic thrash of bands like Kreator and Destruction with rampaging tempos and ferocious buzzsaw riffage, but that was then filtered through a quirky, somewhat spaced-out vision that rendered this into something much more unique. The guitars have a lush, textural feel, the vocals are a youthful snarl that matches the energy of the music, with introspective lyrics, and the songs shift between that furious thrash metal, strange almost jazzy guitar explosions, wild shredding, groovier rocking moments, some obvious post-punk influences, icy dissonant chords, all wound together into a set of nine sprawling, elaborately laid out songs that are delivered with an energetic, not too polished delivery. Intricate and brainy metal with lots of surrealistic atmosphere. Can't say I've heard anything quite like this album. The experimental, ambitious aspects make this something that fans of classic prog-thrash a la Coroner, Watchtower, Voivod, Mekong Delta and the like would want to check out, but Astharoth are much more prone to slipping out of their thorny thrash into sequences of chorus-drenched progginess that leads their album into unexpected directions. While Astharoth's Gloomy Experiments aren't essential if you're into progressive / weirdo thrash metal, their stuff is certainly interesting if you're into the weirder fringes of late 80s/early 90s thrash metal. This reissue pairs the album up with an additional seven bonus tracks that were recorded after the band relocated to the US in the early 90s, much of which gets into even more Voivodian territory.\n\nOK, so on to the second disc that comes with the Dark Symphonies reissue. This one is awesome, with loads of unique, non-album material. You get a total of fourteen tracks, remastered versions of every demo the band ever did. This stuff varies in quality both in terms of songwriting, performance, and recording quality, but it's all crucial listening if you are a fan. I love the chronological track order, tracing their music from the early, chaotic roots through to the more sophisticated prog-thrash of their album-era material. The songs that feature the combination of female and male lead vocals are really great, too: \"Wisdom Of The Blind\" sounds as much influenced by the punchy post-punk of Killing Joke and Ghost Dance as it is by Voivod, Watchtower and Testament. Actually, in some ways this band feels like it shares more genetic material with Anacrusis than anyone else I can think of. The non-album songs prove to be pretty intriguing, with some of this demo material going even deeper into prog-rock territory than they did on Experiments. You get the 1991 Wisdom Of The Blind demo tape (\"Wisdom Of The Blind\", \"Misplaced Senses\", \"Nameless\"), the 1992 Limits demo tape (\"Limits\", \"Egos Of Myself\", \"Accused\"), the 1994 Cycles Of The Sphere demo tape (\"Cycles Of The Sphere\", \"Denial\"), and the 1990 Self-Hatred demo tape (\"Toll Of Hypocrisy\", \"Self-Hatred\", \"Gloomy Experiments\", \"Circles Of Confusion\"). There is also a previously unreleased song, \"House Of Frustration\", and a live track (\"Drunk Hate \") that appeared on the Metalmania '89 compilation that came out on the obscure Polish cassette label Atomica.\n\nDEAD NEANDERTHALS Blood Rite CASSETTE (Utech) 9.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCOWS Daddy Has A Tail CD (Amphetamine Reptile) 14.98\n\nADD TO CARTTrack Samples: Sample : Sugar\n\nSample : Chow\n\nSample : Shaking\n\nELDER Spires Burn / Release (2022 BLUE MARBLE VINYL) 12\" (Armageddon) 17.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThe latest repress circa 2022, on blue marble vinyl.\n\nElder's latest slab of swirling downbeat metal follows up their Dead Roots Stirring album with a two-song ascent into more atmospheric territory. Released on vinyl only, the record begins with \"Spires Burn\", a slow-burning epic with all of the ingredients that make Elder one of the best current doom bands here in the States: those clear, powerful vocals that mesh perfectly with the soaring psychedelic leads and triumphant riffage so imbued with an aura of classic heavy metal; the sudden pitches into seriously-dark Sabbathian creep that the band contrasts with their slightly sunnier, more fist-raising anthemic moments; the swirling space-rock effects that come sweeping over the burning towers and scorched wastelands alluded to in the lyrics; and of course, the absolutely crushing riffage that evokes the meditative bulldozer crush of Sleep. And this song is some of the most rocking stuff I've ever heard from these guys, with some moves into grungy, shoegazy textures toward the end that sort of reminds me of a much heavier Smashing Pumpkins riff.\n\nThen there's the beginning to the second side, where \"Release\" opens up with an amazing melodic intro that's all cascading clean guitars and dreamy, chiming melody - its goddamn fantastic. This swirling melody works its way into the main part of the song as the whole band locks into this killer Kyuss-esque psych-crush that's equal parts soaring, occult-tinged rock and pulverizing Sabbathian low-end, the guitars spinning out these killer melodic leads later in the song that fall somewhere between Josh Homme and J. Mascis. Elder have never sounded so accessible as they do here, but it's simply based on the strength of the songwriting, definitely a big step up from their debut album. The doom is still in here, its just skillfully contrasted with a dark jangly rock sound that comes together just about perfectly on this record. One of the best new doom releases for 2012 alongside the new Pallbearer album.\n\nUNIVERS ZERO Ceux du dehors LP (Sub Rosa) 26.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nA recent 2022 vinyl reissue of this spook-prog masterpiece. here's my old review of the CD version; it has the same track listing, but features a remaster job for vinyl, and comes in a completely redesigned sleeve that is appropriately creepy-looking.\n\nRegular readers of the C-Blast list have no doubt noticed that I'm a HUGE fan of the legendary Belgian chamber-prog band, and their latest album Clivages was in fact the featured new release for the last Crucial Blast new arrivals list. I've never carried their back catalog here in the shop however, so in keeping with my ongoing effort to try to turn more of you people on to the devilishly dark and baroque prog of UZ, I've picked up almost their entire catalog of releases. For those of you who are unfamiliar with 'em, Univers Zero were one of prog rock's darkest and creepiest sounding bands, a classically influenced ensemble based in Belgium that was formed and guided by the unique vision of drummer Daniel Denis, who had played with French prog gods Magma for a brief period before forming UZ. The music of Univers Zero was distinguished by its connection to 20th century music, taking more inspiration from the dissonant sounds of composers like Bartok, Penderecki and Ligeti than from any of the then-current rock forms, and performing with classical instrumentation that included cello, violin, bassoon, viola, harmonium and piano, taking a good decade before they would finally start to utilize electric instruments. The music of Univers Zero, especially early on their first couple of albums, was also notably dark and oppressive, dissonant and sometimes shockingly heavy, a sort of gothic chamber-prog that would often incorporate Lovecraftian themes of cosmic horror into their song titles and imagery, thanks to Daniel Denis's long-running fascination with the works of H.P. Lovecraft (which was also noticeable in the names of two of his previous bands, Necronomicon and Arkham). Their Bartok-meets-Magma sound and the seriously creepy vibe that still informs their music up to the present day makes UZ one of my favorite prog bands ever, and their first three albums in particular (Univers Zero, Ceux Du Dehors and especially Heresie) are highly recommended listening to any fans of serious aural menace. Since the 1980's, the prog label Cuneiform Records (located right down the road from C-Blast HQ in Silver Spring) has been reissuing the Univers Zero catalog in high-quality editions, often fleshed out with bonus material and liner notes, and all of the available UZ titles on Cuneiform are now in stock here at Crucial Blast.\n\nWhile not as intensely bleak as they were on previous album Heresie, Univers Zero still travelled through dark lands on their third album Ceux Du Dehors from 1981, another absolutely essential album of creepy, sinister chamber-prog from the Belgian masters. As with the previous album,\n\nthese labyrinthine pieces move through sudden turns and complex arrangements, the music entirely instrumental save for some choral backing vocals, but the utter blackness of Heresie has dissipated here, the music still imbued with darkness and dread, but leavened a bit by some jazzier stylings and pieces that foreshadow the strange medieval sounds that Univers Zero would explore in more depth on subsequent albums. Some of their finest compositions are found here: the macabre delirium and bad-dream processional of \"Triomphe des Mouches\", the creepy carnival nightmare and medieval waltz of \"La Corne du Bois des Pendus\", the staccato martial aggression and sinister electronic noise blat of \"Combat\", the grim classical doom of \"La Tete Du Corbeau\". And \"La Musique D'Erich Zann\" is the album's token Lovecraft reference, an improvised piece (one of the few improv pieces that Univers Zero would include on a studio album) that's one of UZ's most abstract and hellish sounding recordings, a brief blackened dronescape of dungeon ambience, dripping atmosphere, atonal scraped cello strings, and wheezing discordant harmonium notes.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : UNIVERS ZERO-Ceux du dehors\n\nSample : UNIVERS ZERO-Ceux du dehors\n\nSample : UNIVERS ZERO-Ceux du dehors\n\nCATATONIC EXISTENCE Elect Me God, And I'll Kill You All CD (Epic Recordings) 16.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAs big a fan as I am of weird, messed-up industrial metal, I'd never heard of this obscure California outfit until now. Apparently best known for being a side-project from one of the guys in the notorious grindcore outfit Meatshits, Catatonic Existence popped up briefly in the mid 90s, releasing a split CD and a seperate split 7\" with the aforementioned 'Shits, and the two song I'll Kill You All! 7\" from 1994, before disappearing back into the boiling black sewer from which they emerged. The band was essentially a one-man effort from Guy Mulidor, with some additional contributions from Meatshits founder Robert Deathrage on vocals, sampling and keyboards, but it's quite different from the other stuff that these guys were doing. It's just as nihilistic and misanthropic, sure, but the music is a bizarre sort of primitive, industrialized electro-metal, not quite the Godflesh worhip that you might expect (although they are cwertainly an influence on this stuff). No, this is much weirder and much more fucked-up. Pounding double-bass drum machine rhythms and machinelike programmed pummel drill through songs like \"Guy Told Me To\" and \"The Last Temptation\", tinny thrash riffs buried in the mix beneath Mulidor's monstrous guttural gorilla-grunts, while the bass guitar and synths often break into these odd funk parts, even breaking out some actual slap-bass moves in some of the weirder moments. Also, this stuff us fucking loaded with samples, with long film samples from early 90s movies like Judgement Night and Needful Things as well as fragments of news reports and various other movies are strewn throughout the songs, and there are big chunks of this stuff when the metallic elements drop out and it turns into a demented kind of EBM, some fucked-up, meth-addled take on Front 242. It's not for all tastes, I can tell you that. The awkward song structures, the bizarre funk bass, the squelchy Wax Trax synths and weird bossa nova percussion breaks, the overload of samples and the willfully anti-human attitude, all turns this into a kind of outsider mecha-metal that manages to transcend being just another Godflesh clone. It's weirdly infectious, especially if you've got a taste for weirdo electro-sludge like Black Mayonnaise and stuff in that general vein.\n\nBOHREN & DER CLUB OF GORE Geisterfaust 2 x LP (PIAS Recordings) 28.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFIRE Issue 3 MAGAZINE (Fire) 14.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNOISE Demo Tapes 1991-1995 LP (SPHC) 13.98\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFIVE DOLLAR PRIEST The New York Post-Punk / Noise Series: VOL III DVD (Robellion) 14.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCYBER-PSYCHOS A.O.D.

Then I was hooked. I got my hands on everything I could, including this meeting between two of the UK and Dutch black metal underground's more deliberately obscure outfits, issued in a limited run of two hundred. It kills. The fetid glue that seems to pull this split together is that both bands would appear to share a reverence for the low-fi, fucked-up, anti-human aesthetics of Les Légions Noires scene outta France, and I'm always game for some LLN appreciation. With two songs from each band, The Realm Of Rats And Pestilence spills out of the speakers like a pile of offal and ancient grave dirt.\n\nSounding freshly unearthed, Adytum is pure raw black metal primitivism, spitting out \"Beneath The Ruins\" and \"Pestilence\" in wonderfully harsh and stumbling bursts of lopsided aggression and shrieking hatefulness. I love this band. Simple, back-and-forth punk-style drumming moves at loping tempos while the guitar is throttled into a heap of broken riffs, off-kilter melodies, weird stops and starts - oh man, and it's so bathed in hiss and room ambience that it feels like I'm right there in the crypt (or practice space, or whatever). Borderline \"outsider\" black metal, played with unabashed degenerate glee, the reverb-cloaked howls spewing visions of death-worship and curses and plagues, everything shifting between that hammering punk-like barbarism and the weirder, off-time chugging riffs and melodies. And then there's that total hard rockin' guitar solo stealing through the night at the end of \"Pestilence\"? It's legit shit, and hits the same nerve spot for me as do bands like Xeukatre, Vetala, early Black Cilice, and the Legion Blotan at large.\n\nSimilarly gonked-out are Darkness Enshrouded The Mist, a Dutch one-man band (I think) that hammers you with a slower, more deliberate strain of black metal, still on the stripped-down and primitive side, with mid-tempo minor-key riffs blended with subtle dissonance, but like their vinyl-mates in Adytum, there are these parts in \"A Realm Of Rats\" and \"Blood & Decay\" where the musicality starts to fray at the edges, the riffs coming out slightly awkward, which for me just adds to the clandestine vibe of this stuff. With that first siong, it's nearly as punk-warped as Adytum, rooted in an identifiable early 90's mode; however, that second song makes a hard left into spooksville, \"Decay\" immediately floating up in a wave of ectoplasmic murk, everything melting at the edges ass this blurry, bleary blackened noise-drone rides out the rest of the EP, barely obscuring the voices of worship that drift beneath the surface - teasing at something almost Moevot-esque as it eases into distant silence...\n\nDig in.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : A Realm Of Rats\n\nSample : A Realm Of Rats\n\nSUNLESS Ylem CASSETTE (Willowtip) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nCROWLEY, ALEISTER Poems And Invocations CASSETTE (TPOS) 7.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nThere have been a gajillion different versions of the collected wax cylinder recordings and acetates of the Great Beast (purportedly recorded between 1910 and 1914) since the 1970s that originally were recorded all the way back in 1920 as The Great Beast Speaks. These editions really started popping up on underground industrial/occult labels in the 1980s cassette culture, with versions put together by Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth and Incubator, and the oft-sourced LP edition on Goetia from 1986 (titled The Hastings Archives / The World As Power) being the first real complete vinyl release of these recordings (it was soon followed by another \"bootleg\" LP simply titled Aleister Crowley which included liner notes from Current 93's David Tibet - I've been looking for just a facsimile of those for years). And the terrific weirdo-culture label TPOS jumped into the fray as well, producing this cassette version of Crowley's famed spoken-word recordings in 1990 that has remained in print ever since, as far as i can tell. The specific track list and order on Poems And Invocations is exactly the same as the Goetia LP, so I suspect that these recordings were pulled from there, especially since the sound quality on Invocations is better than most of the other Crowley tapes that I've heard. I dig how TPOS made a point to delineate the ritual recordings from Crowley's poetry readings, with the former on the A-side and the latter on the back. Keeping these two different sessions slightly separated enhances the listening experience, at least for me.\n\nI'm not concerned with the debates surrounding Crowley's delivery of the legendary Enochian Calls and whether or not his pronunciations were correct - I'm just glad that I can hear the man doing his thing. For anyone interested in early 20th century magick, Thelema, Golden Dawn, etc., the four tracks are fascinating to listen to. Crowley invokes \"The Call Of The First Aethyr \" and \"The Call Of The Second Aethyr \", each one first attempted in the original Enochian text, then followed by his reading of the English translation. Obviously the fidelity on these ritual recordings are primitive and murky at best; the century-old technology used to record this work immediately left a patina of great age and aural obfuscation on the material; I've noticed that the recordings posted online have attracted some small following of ASMR fans who respond to the crackling, dust-caked, distant feel of the recording, the air filled with scratches of time and wear on crumbling grooves. That newfound aspect of this just makes everything around these Crowley recordings even weirder, as they find their way into the digital age.\n\nThe poetry featured on side two is of greater interest to me, actually. I'm a huge fan of his pornographic, scatological verse collected in his book White Stains; there are lines in there that black metal lyricists would have killed to come up with. The poetry recording is made up of ten individual spoken pieces, and as is the case with his written verse, the quality can vary. Pieces like the heartsick paean to love \"La Gitana\" and the flowing dreamstate of \"At Sea\" can somewhat resemble the surrealist visions of Breton, though not quite reaching the same ecstatic heights; also unusual is the declaratory meter of \"The Pentagram\", the bawdy tribute to whoredom \"One Sovereign For Woman\", the weird warnings of \"Fingernails\", and \"Excerpts From The Gnostic Mass\", which drifts off from your speakers like a homily, strange and profane. Lesser works like the self-referential \"The Poet\", his eulogy to \"The Titanic\", and the celebratory cadence of \"Hymn to the American People on the Anniversary of Their Independence\" are still important to hear, even if just as a historical piece. But the weirdest of all of this stuff is the song \"Viva La France\" at the very end, which Crowley belts out alongside piano accompaniment - it's a fittingly perverse and unexpected burst of jocularity from the guy, who here hardly sounds like the great degenerate and icon of \"evil\" of his era. I love it. I really get the impression from some of these readings that Crowley was a romantic at heart.\n\nAlongside Austin Osman Spare, there's no arguing that Aleister Crowley really was the most notorious and influential occultist of the 20th century, and he lives still, his voice a spirit revived from ancient pieces of wax and aluminum.\n\nMOTHER OF SIGHS self-titled CASSETTE (Anathemata Editions) 11.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nAnother great musical project from the husband and wife duo of Terence Hannum (Locrian / Axebreaker) and Erica Burgner-Hannum (Unlucky Atlas), here working as a stripped-out duo compared to the full band setup of their amazing dream-pop/post-punk outfit The Holy Circle. With their eponymous debut as Mother Of Sighs, the duo pay homage to the era of horror film soundtracks that produced their name (their moniker is a reference to the classic 1977 Argento film Suspiria and incoporate elements of the grim post-industrial dronescaping Terence crafts with Locrian, heavy doses of carcinogenic noise, and sweeping nocturnal synthesizers that merge together into something grand and terrible. Murky eletronics melt together into sinister forms as primal drum machine rhythms thud deep in the mix, the high end cut out of the mix as opener \"Black Bile\" spills out into a brackish, bleary stream of gothic drone, stacked keys and pipe organ-style tones swirling into simple and chilling melodies while tortured screams issue out of the distant blackness. Definitely aims and hits a high score on the creep-o-meter, avoiding rote \"retro\" synthesizier stylings for something much more abstract and suffocating. It's really more like the sort of blackened industrial that ANNIHILVS seems to specialize in. But then things take turns for the morose as stuff like \"Claustrum\" weaves in those ethereal vocals from Erica amid a mellowed-out groove that sounds like something on 4AD circa 1988 on a bad trip. Multi-tracked singing and spare beats and beautiful, bleak melodic structures form out of the amorphous shadows, leading to the heavier synth-driven doomwave of \"Anxia Corda\" , which is positioned in the middle of the EP perfectly; each piece of music has evolved to this point, materializing as a dark pulsating dream that seeps into your awareness. That feeling of gothic grandeur reappears as \"Ourself Behind Ourself\" drifts in over your head, and again we're descended into a strange but intensely emotional deathpop mutation, billowing minor key chords and incandescent church organ drones winding around those lovely vocals.\n\nThat pair of songs make up some of the best music I've heard these folks put together, summoning a certain level of nostalgic bliss from old darkwave and synth scores but warping it gradually into something more malefic; when that other half-chanted processed voice appears over the end of the former song, it's pretty unnerving, just as it is when those narcoleptic ululuations drop like heavy black clouds into the abyss with the latter. The way that the tape swaddles these blissed-out pieces amid the opening driftscapes and the lengthy midnight ether of closer \"Dysthymia\" is handled almost perfectly, balancing the pure ambience of those haunting electronic fields with oh-too-brief passages of languid melancholy...man, it's lovely stuff, even as it all makes your hair stabnd on end.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Dysthymia\n\nSample : Anxia Corda\n\nSample : Black Bile\n\nTORTURING NURSE Recycled Music Series CASSETTE (RRRecords) 4.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nLYSERGIC Void Dissociation CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 8.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nHere is another recent debut that immediately chewed my face off upon first contact. Coming from the fertile war-metal grounds of Alberta, Canada, the band Lysergic suddenly crashed into our reality at the beginning of May 2023 with this three-song blast of freakish, psychotronic black / death metal. The band remains anonymous but has tendrils digging into the Calgary metal underground. More importantly, this outfit delivers something I've been waiting for, a sound that channels the exact mental and emotional state I arrive at whenever I listen to stuff like Conqueror, Black Witchery or Revenge after shotgunning two bottles of cough syrup. For years, I've been waiting for this. And Lysergic brings it. Made up of three explosive tracks ( \"Erratic Noose Departure\", \"Maggot Crown Usurper\", \"Throne Annihilation\" ), the EP detonates eruptions of convulsive and hallucinatory war-blast that slips in and out of dimensional phase, merging a sulfuric whirlwind of barbaric riffs, hammering drum-machine generated tempos, electronic derangement, and foul vocal emanations with a fractured and downright psychedelic quality befitting its name. There is no lessening of the core brutality behind this specific sound; this shit is ferocious, a roiling mass of air-raid siren horror, raw and relentless blastbeat drumming, primitive chainsaw guitar, all glomming together with sickening, echoing snarls and moments of unmistakable Conqueror-worship. But this carnivorous blast-attack spins out of control pretty fast, those inhuman, reptilian vocals getting tangled and knotted in crazed amounts of delay and reverb, emitting a hallucinatory, tracer-like aural effect, joined in with what fast turns into a phantasmagoria of noxious electronic skree, over-the-top guitar noise, grinding loops of distant voices and sculpted feedback, the spaces between songs filling up with cacophonic, monstrous sound deformation. And when the tempo eventually shifts into a slower, sludgy muck, it all leads this tape into a foul final crush of collapsing sonic structures. It's fucked up.\n\nThis kind of trippy, noise-damaged war-metal mutation has been worming out of the rotten woodwork in recent years, and man, I can't get enough of it. Lysergic dive a little deeper into straight-up electronic noise and loop-abuse than many of its peers, but like I mentioned, these songs never stray from that signature black/death sound, stripping it down to its most atavistic fundamentals, the riffs and drums locking into a droning hypnosis, but then splattering all of it with a chain of wrecked FX pedals, barbed metallic feedback manipulations, and piercing high-frequency sound-waves. A twelve-minute scream from the edges of churning black chaos: Dimethyltriptykon Uprise. Final Rope Reprieve.\n\nHarsh stuff. If you've been prowling around the more grotesque edges of the \"bestial\" field in recent years, you've likely tapped in to some like-minded aberrations that push the limits of coherence and musicality; to my ears, this violent filth comes howling out of an adjacent DMT-damaged deathzone to the one that's populated by bands like Sect Pig, Methgoat, Nuclearhammer, Kapala, and Human Agony.\n\nThis cassette edition of Void Dissociation comes on purple cassette with full color artwork; the multi-panel sleeve includes the complete lyrics for the release.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Erratic Noose Departure\n\nSample : Maggot Crown Usurper\n\nSample : Throne Annihilation\n\nLORD KAOS Thorns Of Impurity 2 x LP (Nuclear War Now! Productions) 32.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nALLIN, GG Freaks, Faggots, Drunks & Junkies (2022 SHIT MIX VINYL) LP (Awareness) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNow also available in a limited-edition 2022 \"shit mix” colored vinyl edition for all of you distinguished aesthetes out there.\n\nIn 2016 year of our lord, it's almost unfathomable that this rare beast could have once stalked the face of the earth. But when I need a real social palette cleanser, I turn to the late 80s GG Allin stuff. And this motherfucker is top of the pile, one of the filth-king's rattiest and nastiest albums. The fifth album from Allin and originally released on Gerard Cosloy's Homestead Records, Freaks captures the beast during my favorite period of his career: with this particular expression of his monstrous Id, Allin enlisted the talents of Bulge, who otherwise belched out a couple of rippin' thrashcore releases on Ax/ction and Fudgeworthy in the early 90s, and who featured members of Gonkulator, Jesus Chrust, and Psycho. Bulge's drummer Charlie Infection had already previously worked with Allin by including the song \"I Wanna Suck Your Cunt\" on the Welcome To Ax/ction Island compilation. Bulge was a relatively tighter, more \"stable\" band compared to Allin's previous backing group, so the team-up made sense.\n\nThat said, this album is a warzone: a pitch-shifted GG lays down the law with the spoken word intro \"My Revenge\", then throws us headfirst into a nineteen-song orgy of drug-damaged blues riffs and monstrously fucked-up hardcore punk. His vocals sound totally scorched here, like the man has been swilling gasoline in between vocal takes. \"Be My Fuckin Whore\"' offers a litany of degradation and misogynistic abuse set to primitive hardcore, with some almost Greg Ginn-level guitar warp going on when it rips into a solo, followed by the thirty-second noisecore-esque blast-chaos of \"Suck My Ass It Smells\". \"Dog Shit\" delivers what is possibly my favorite line from the guy, \"...Get the fuck outta my bread line...\", and that general mean-spirited, ragged hardcore attack makes up the bulk of Freaks.\n\nOther scorchers include sickoid mid-tempo rippers like \"Anti Social Masterbator\" (sic)and \"Last In Line For The Gang Bang\" that collectively climb right into your head and won't leave. You've got a nod to David Allan Coe via \"Outlaw Scumfuc\". And with the messed-up and overtly brain-damaged moments like the lumbering, tuneless skull-beating on \"Wild Riding\" and \"Crash & Burn\" , Allin and crew puke up a kind of Flipper / Kilslug / Black Flag-style scum-dirge that's swarming with gruesome guitar skronk, grating atonal synthesizer, go-nowhere sludgepunk riffing, and some of the more unsettling and orgasmic vocals we've heard from Allin. Goddamn awesome stuff. The closer \"My Bloody Mutilation\" is a drawn-out, industrial nightmare, a fog of clanking, metallic atonality and tortured invective screams, raving madness set to a oily black shimmer of deformed ambience, almost Abruptum-like in it's sheer abject hideousness. But if I had to give you just one reason to pick up this atrocity, it's the song \"Die When You Die\" (actually itself a sort-of cover of Destroy All Monsters's proto-punk classic \"You're Gonna Die\" ), a perfectly formed piece of anti-social, anti-human punk rock that has gone on to be covered by countless punk and black metal bands in the decades since. It's one of the greatest Allin songs of all time.\n\nBottom line is this- fans of fucked-up and demented 80s' hardcore who haven't heard this stuff are missing out. This is hanging out on the most terrible fringes of hardcore. The height of anti-social art-psychosis and chaos-invocation in the latter half of the 1980s. The Freaks album could sit nicely alongside other albums that I would term \"outsider hardcore\", in spite of some probable pushback from members of the punk scene. But GG and the Bulge beasts were not interested in working within the parameters of the then-current hardcore scene. This is so much more transgressive, more bizarre, more genuinely deranged and incontrovertibly misanthropic, more dissident and self-destroying in every possible way. Allin himself considered this album to be one of the best of his career. A sodomatic , Dionysian immolation rite, pursuing ultimate physical transcendence in a manner not unlike the Aghori sect. And man, nobody ever came close to hustling the way that GG did. It's a sight and sound to behold. Everyone else was performing theater. This was the real deal.\n\nHYPER-ANNOTATION 001 BOOK (PostHuman Magazine) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nSAVAGE REPUBLIC Tragic Figures: 40th Anniversary Expanded Edition 2 x CD (Real Gone Music) 19.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nColossal 2022 reissue\n\nThe LP is available on red vinyl in a pressing of 2000 copies, packaged in a particularly striking gatefold jacket.\n\nHailing from a window of time in the 1980s when bands, partuclarly American ones, were taking the influence of paradigm-shifting post-punk like Public Image Ltd., Joy Division, Wire and Gang Of Four into more harrowing, aggressive, abject dimensions, the earliest Savage Republic music is dark and mesmeric and harsh on their debut album Tragic Figures from 1982. Along with the influence of the screeching atonality and anti-social skronk of the NYC No Wave crowd, this music also leeched some of the primal percussive power and dystopic deliria of the burgeoning post-industrial music scene, and found Savage Republic (for awhile at least) creating an abrasive clamor and more menacing attitude that would get comparisons, then and now, to other early 80s street-beaters like Swans and Big Black. I ended up discovering Savage Republic way later in life, which is aggravating; if I had heard this in my teens when I was utterly obsessed with Swans and the early proto-noise rock underground, Tragic Figures would've been rumbling out of my bedroom at all hours of day and night. When I finally had someone shove this record under my nose several years ago, it was kinda revelatory. This stuff was heavy, not in the metallic sense of course, but heavy in mood and 'tude, more aggressive and acerbi9c than what I might have expected to hear.\n\nThat cover image of Iranian military forces executing Kurdish rebels in 1979\n\nOn the first side, the music is tilted towards more of an instrumental breakout - the metal-on-metal percussive frenzy comes on strong as opener \"When All Else Fails\" bursts forth like a crazed protest assault, an array of rattling, stomping, clanking rhythms laid over each other while heavy bass and chugging distorted guitar grind out simple, sludgy, skull-mashing riffs. That wild rebeliious energy burns brightly throughout the album, from the aggressive tribal beats and menacing two-chord muck-punk of \"Attempted Coup : Madagascar Percussion\", the winding spiky guitar and multi-level polyrhtyms that energize \"The Ivory Coast\" as it rumbles and shakes, those sinister No Wave influences merging with that relentless syncopated drive on \"Next To Nothing\", on to the clanking industrial drone rock raga of the back-to-back \"Exodus\" and \"Machinery\" (whose pissed-off hardcore punk-style vocal delivery summons vivid visions of our slow moving apocalypse), te super-short ritual loop \"Zulu Zulu \", that crumbling mass of distortion, gnarly bass riffage, and burgeoning violence that underscores the satirical \"Real Men\". This stuff gets even more unnerving towards the end as anguished shrieks ring out over \"Flesh That Walks\"'s feral racket and cannibal manifestos. \"Kill The Fascists!\" is a pretty straightfoward junkyard symphony (recorded in the underground tunnels beneath UCLA) that speaks pretty clearly for itself, but it all drifts into oblivion when closer \"Procession\" disassembles the band's sounds into a hypnotizing haze..\n\nIt's all quite noisy and abrasive, paerticularly from the guitar, whose peformance delivers a tetanus-infected shock of slashing droning strings, burly and bass-heavy slow-motion power chord dirges, gusts of atonal skree, and some straight-up brain damaged shredding that takes me to some kind of malfunctioning nirvana state.\n\n- this is clearly the stuff that critic Robert Christgau was talking about in his old review of the album where he described Tragic as resembling \"Flipper doing Afropop originals?\".\n\nObviously fans of the more abject and twisted end of experimental sludge-punk are going to find some real meta to chew on here, if there was anything even close to a modern analogue to Savage Republic's early urban-conflict wardance it might be that Billy Bao stuff; there's no way that those guys weren't luistening to this stuff on repeat.\n\nThe other disc pulls all of the pre-Savage Republic recordings together, from when the group called themselves Africa Corps and recorded their music in UCLA area parking garages. And man, this stuff is great! Most of these tracks have never before been released; the majority of these songs were carried over onto the Savage debut (\"Attempted Coup : Madagascar\", \"When All Else Fails\", \"Real Men\", etc.), but here they sound even more immediate and cacophonic, record live together in a group frenzy, all of the heavy sludge-punk riffs even grungier and filthier here, the guitar's barbed-wire post-punk/No Wave-influenced raga-like drones and sharp biting chords and angry discordant scrapes pushed further up in the mix. There is so much clank and glass and pipe-banging mixed up with the trance-inducing drumming that it sweeps over your senses, random yelling and raging and howling in the background behind the main vocalist (momentarily reminding me of the most aggro moments from Cro-Magnon), with these general feeling of hysteria and anxiety and flailing hostility being unleashed.\n\nSome of these songs only appear here, like the fleeting junk-freakout \"The Vampire Bites \", the severely bizarre experimental tape-music spewed across \"Next To Nothing Weirdness\", and amazing ectatsic freeform explosions like \"Thee Three Preserves\" and \"Sliding Into Arabia\" with their imposing, crudely formed melodies informed by Middle Eastern scales\n\nthe eleven minute version of \"Procession (Into The Light)\" is completely mesmerizing, just an endless tribal rhythm delivered to a state of __________________\n\nand the burlier, murkier version of \"Exodus\" that whips up a spectacular drone-rock mantra\n\nI think that the \"Tragic Figures\" recordings of all of this are superior in the end, but hearing the musicians working out their ideas and attack together sounds great on this preface recording, definitely a recommended listen for fans of what the band would quickly evolve into\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Flesh That Walks\n\nSample : Machinery\n\nSample : Attempted Coup: Madagascar\n\nBOREDOM KNIFE Stalker CASSETTE (Crucial Blast) 9.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nFinnish musician Marko Neuman has been busy as hell lately. I'd been following his work previously via the assorted high-grade bands he has been in (Dark Buddha Rising, Overdose Support, Sum Of R, Ural Umbo, Waste Of Space Orchestra). But until very recently, I hadn't heard his noise project Boredom Knife. It made an impact on me, though. Checking out previous releases like the split with Crepuscular Entity ‎on Basement Corner Emissions or the Your Pain Is Getting Worse tape on Bent Window introduced me to a cruel, cold strain of harsh noise, a form of deep-field black static, flecked with elements of power electronics and K2-style junk-avalanche. I was already getting deep into it when Neuman sent me his latest recording, Stalker.\n\nThis twenty-three-minute release pairs two corresponding pieces, \"Envy\" and \"Snap\", the first a long and winding chaos-channel into the doom-laden intensity of the second. The atmosphere around this release is felt in the cold stare, the mindless gaze, and the resulting vortex of emotional destruction that was written in the postures of celestial forms long before the final act of exterminating envy and dominance occurred. Lines cut through the star-map of lethal obsession. The predetermined hunt.\n\nBoredom Knife's Stalker emits a cold, piercing gaze instantly, the first side \"Envy\" churning out a dense wall of hollowed-out drones, black static, bursts of corrosive hiss, and strange pulse-like rhythms buried deep within the core of this ghostly noisescape. While there's much to digest here for enthusiasts of the \"wall\", Neuman produces something much more complex and dramatic. Feedback and speaker-rumble are carefully probed and manipulated, vicious high frequency noise expressed through rivers of metallic skree that are easy to drown in. That first track gradually and deliberately evolves from the mechanical whirr, junk-style clatter, and mangled (but weirdly melodious) carnage at the beginning, morphing into a steady field of layered screech and endless hum, sharpened metal scrape and clusters of bizarre, almost subliminal gurgling that continue to resurface throughout the track. It conjures a hypnotic, possibly psychedelic state of sonic overwhelm, each layer of cruel noise obsessively carved and sculpted into a latter half of near-complete roar, before it finally circles back to a final stretch of rhythmic squelch, immutable drone, and hideous shattered distortion that resolves into a final noxious junk-loop at the end.\n\nThis brief bit of structured noise is instantly obliterated with the onset of the b-side \"Snap\". Everything is sucked inward, imploding in a vast mass of roaring, raging static. Some semblance of the humanity heard on the previous track is dragged to the surface and obliterated. This piece concludes Stalker with a blast of oppressive, dominating black static that remains almost constant over the entire runtime. Bits of machine-like jitter, traces of peripheral musicality, horrifying shrieks, it is all swirling inward, into itself, this titanic maelstrom of over-modulated electronics and eerie voice-like entities, teeth-grinding distortion, and covert structures of sound, all going down the drain forever. This is where Stalker really turns into something psychedelic, affecting your senses and your perception of the space around you as that chaos keeps seething and spinning, occasionally shooting out chunks of strange sonic debris and whiplash tentacles of high-end feedback. And then, for the first time, a volley of fearsome shrieks and howls come flying out of that chaos, incomprehensible screams of abject horror. Just for a moment, those nightmare distorted vocals blow your hair back, and it all suddenly collapses into itself, leaving you with a brief moment of deadened electrical thrum before it abruptly stops.\n\nI've listened to a number of Boredom Knife releases, and while much of his material shares this tenacious sadism and auditory blast-violence, this one gives me the creeps. Stalker finds that blood-specked middle ground between the gargantuan murderous PE of Slogun, and the obliterating heaviosity of classic harsh noise.\n\nTrack Samples: Sample : Snap\n\nSample : Envy\n\nCULTIC Whip Seduction ( XXL ) SHIRT (Crucial Blast) 22.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nReleased alongside the skull-stomping new Seducer (Expanded Edition) EP, the Whip Seduction shirt features a stunning, brand-new design by Cultic drummer and acclaimed illustrator Rebecca Magar. This design is exclusive to Crucial Blast, and features what could well be my favorite art from Rebecca / Wailing Wizard to date - for real, I'm possessed by an overwhelming impulse to get this tattooed on my person. Perfectly capturing the sleaze, filth, and carnal violence of Cultic's brand of atavistic, dungeon synth-soaked death metal, it's also one of the coolest designs that we've released over here at C-Blast. This is a highly quality three-color print courtesy of our collaborators at Forest Passage Printing, available on black 100% cotton Gildan garments.

Some of the craziest-sounding black / death metal I've heard lately appear to be emanating from that region of the world; it's as if the South Korean black metal scene is plagued with rabies. Take Sadomatic Rites. This brand new project crawled into my skull via the fantastic Rites of Pestilence Youtube channel, and I can't get it off me. I can’t get it off me. This is absolutely punishing black crud, low-fi and hand-made and totally horrendous, coming from the foul orbit of the Berserk Ritual Productions community of bands, all of which exists in a kind of bizarre, hyper-Satanic frenzy. That all-out Satanic madness fully infects the brain-damaged blackened gurgle of Rites, the totally incomprehensible vocals alluding to mindless acts of blasphemy and profanity, desecration and disturbed apocalyptic visions. This stuff is unapologetically obscene.\n\nThe original online demo (which initially was just two or three songs) slimed over me like a barely-sentient black oil spill, serving up a blast of stumbling necrotic doom with bizarre delay-drenched vocals, weird unidentifiable noises, and disturbing, ophidian hissing. Bass-heavy, and distorted to hell. The music violently lurches from side to side, from one sicko riff to the next, but sticking with a repetitive, hammering hypnotic attack where the anonymous monster behind this grinds out these filthy, fucked-up riffs ad nauseum That barbaric simplicity and anti-social gibbering combines with a kind of sludge-punk minimalism that stinks up the joint. Vocals echo over the satanic sludge through a thick haze of delay and other effects. The band blatantly cites the likes of Beherit and Ride For Revenge as its main influence (the band name itself is taken from a Beherit song, natch), and boy, you can definitely hear it. But over here, my ears also pick up guttural whispers of the messy, crushing, doped-out trudge of stuff like Upsidedown Cross, Kilslug, and Drug Problem-era Drunks With Guns. It all sounds so mangled, murderous, and likely psychotic. A glorious mess of loathing and antipathy. When things pick up the pace, like on the bumbling quasi-blast of \"Piss Your God's Grave\" (sic) and the tumbling havoc of \"Crawling Slaves of Jesus Christ\" (zero subtlety here, folks), Rites turns even more chaotic and damaged, a caveman thrash beat banging away beneath chaotic shredding, atonal guitar \"solos\", and those incessant, repulsive chant-like vocals. The abrupt tempo changes from manic hammering to gluey psychedelic pummel give me a wicked case of whiplash. Then there's the parts where it sounds like droning synth drifts up out of the gutter, adding a creepy ambience to this stuff; it's those moments that evoke the ancient weirdness of Drawing Down The Moon-era Beherit, not something that many bands are capable of pulling off. It's bonkers.\n\nBizarre, shambling, and insanely Satanic South Korean slime. Utterly primitive and vile. Accidentally experimental, and deliberately disgusting.\n\nLimited to one hundred copies with a digital download code, the tape sleeve covered in borderline-asemic devil-worship scrawl and baphometic sigils, and includes a 1\" Sadomatic Rites pin.\n\nGODFLESH Songs Of Love And Hate CASSETTE (Earache) 9.99\n\nADD TO CART\n\nWarehouse find of the original, still-sealed cassette edition of Songs, which features the same track listing as the LP version.\n\nEver since these Brits dropped their classic debut Streetcleaner on an unsuspecting underground in the late 80's, Justin Broadrick and G.C. Green continued to carve out their own unique language of pummeling riffage and unbelievably crushing drum machine programming, developing their sound into something that became increasingly obsessed with repetition and rhythm. The drum machine was one of Godflesh's most prominent identifyers, anchoring the hypnotic chugging bass and discordant riffage to a machine-like grind that took the Swans influence into even heavier, mechanistic territory, and there were few bands back then that came anywhere close to matching the sheer fucking heaviness of Godflesh. So when the band came out with Songs Of Love And Hate in 1996 and introduced their first album with an actual flesh-and-blood drummer behind the kit, it was surprising, as if the band was suddenly turning into an actual \"rock\" band.\n\nThe drummer on Songs... is Brian Mantia, one of the founding members of the avant-funk/metal supergroup Praxis and a former member of Bay Area funk rockers Limbomaniacs (am I the only person that actually remembers that band?), and here he lays down a massive breakbeat-heavy groove across the eleven songs, pumping old school hip-hop beats with steroids and creating an undercurrent of pummeling industrial rhythms that are funkier than anything Godflesh had recorded up to this point. It ain't no fun, though, as the entire album seethes with a dystopian negativity that stretches from the hallucinatory image of the statue of Christ against a backdrop of a twilight nightmare world of endless cemeteries and fire-belching factories that is featured as the album cover, to the jackhammer endtime anthems like \"Sterile Prophet\", \"Circle Of Shit\", \"Angel Domain\", and \"Frail\". The guitars are MASSIVE, Broadrick's detuned guitar grinding out huge quasi-Sabbath riffs locked into infinite trance-states, and clusters of atonal chords that churn and squeal like gears in some hellish machinery. Greene's bass grooves slither through each track, a menacing monolithic low-end presence that never relents. Jesus, this stuff is still as heavy as ever, a paranoid, apocalyptic vision sculpted out of industrial hip-hop rhythms and harsh slow-motion riffage. Essential.\n\nRUDIMENTARY PENI Death Church (2022 Reissue) LP (Sealed Records) 26.00\n\nADD TO CART\n\nNew (2022) remastered reissue of the classic deathrock debut Death Church, presented in jewel case CD and on vinyl in big foldout poster sleeve. Here's my write-up, slightly edited, of the previous Outer Himalayan edition :\n\nThis classic slab of macabre Lovecraftian avant-punk is available again, remastered from the original tapes. Like the other recent Peni reissues, this is essential for anyone into dark, macabre punk, early death-rock, and occult-obsessed hardcore.\n\nIt would be very hard to overstate just how influential these albums have been on an entire class of bands that followed in their wake, and you can now hear echoes of Rudimentary Peni's spiky, angular punk and bubbling madness lingering on albums from all kinds of hardcore punk, avant-rock and even black metal bands. They have always been grouped in with the early 80's anarcho-punk scene that flourished in Britain, but aside from their early connections with the band Crass (having released their 1982 Farce 7\" on Crass Records), Rudimentary Peni had very little in common both musically and thematically with most of the other punk bands that they were associated with. Their music was so much darker and more enigmatic than almost anything else happening in British punk at the time, with much of the unique sound and vibe coming from front-man Nick Blinko, a visionary lyricist and artist who has struggled with mental"
