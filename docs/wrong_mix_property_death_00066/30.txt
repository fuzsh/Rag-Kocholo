The Times-Picayune is marking the tricentennial of New Orleans with its ongoing 300 for 300 project, running through 2018 and highlighting the moments and people that connect and inspire us. Today, the series continues with that quintessential po-boy ingredient, Blue Plate Mayonnaise.

THEN: Once upon a time, in a little Gretna warehouse, Blue Plate Foods Inc., a subsidiary of the giant Wesson-Snowdrift Oil Co., started turning out mayonnaise -- or mynez, to use the local pronunciation -- bearing the Blue Plate name in 1929. In November 1943, Blue Plate moved into a sleek, white concrete mayonnaise factory with rounded glass-brick corners in Mid-City, at 1315 S. Jefferson Davis Parkway. The building became a local landmark.

NOW: Mayonnaise hadn't been made in the factory since 2000. After 2005's Hurricane Katrina, the building was rehabilitated at a cost of $25 million by HRI Properties and JCH Development and converted into 72 mixed-income loft apartments with a leasing preference for artists. The building is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Until the early years of the 20

For nearly 90 years, the Blue Plate brand and its iconic building have been inextricable parts of New Orleans, and Blue Plate products, including margarine, jelly, salad dressing and barbecue sauce, have been familiar sights in local kitchens. The popularity of all those Blue Plate food products apparently has extended to the Art Moderne building where the mayonnaise used to be made. This message is on its website: "Due to overwhelming demand and with no availability at this time, the waitlist for an apartment at Blue Plate Artist Lofts has been closed."
