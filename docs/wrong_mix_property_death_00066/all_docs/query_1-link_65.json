        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (WPEC) – Buying ammunition out of a vending machine is not something you see every day, but it could be in the future.\n\nThe company behind the American Rounds vending machines is now expanding to more states, according to CEO Grant Magers.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of requests to expand to Florida, we have some opportunities currently there. And so, it is in the plan,” Magers said.\n\nMagers said the company currently has more than 200 store requests from approximately nine states, and that number is growing daily.\n\nThe machines would be located in retail locations like grocery stores.\n\nBut before you can buy the bullets, the machine uses identification scanners to verify your age, combined with facial recognition.\n\n“It’s going to be a facial recognition scan, pair your picture to the ID. So that says OK, yes, this is the person that that owns the ID, that the faces match. And then, only then, can the transaction be complete,” Magers said.\n\nPalm Beach County residents have mixed feelings about the machines, especially when it comes to more people having access to ammunition.\n\n“We’re dealing with a lot of people getting killed right now. And we’re trying to protect our kids. That’s not gonna help,” resident Marie Rost said.\n\nGuns & Range Training Center owner Alex Shkop says since ammo doesn’t require a background check, he just sees this as an option for convenience.\n\n“Personally, I don’t see anything wrong with it. Because again, it’s just a commodity,” Shkop said.\n\nMagers says this is a safer and easier way to buy ammo.\n\n“Right now, ammo is sold, you know, on the internet, where any minor can click that they’re 21 or 18, or whatever that state law is, and they can have 2,000 rounds shipped to their house,” Magers said."
