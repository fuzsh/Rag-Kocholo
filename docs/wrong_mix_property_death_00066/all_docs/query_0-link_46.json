        "text": "In our business, we take every opportunity to use Moxey over cash. When we purchased a new office for our Baton Rouge location, we hired everyone from electricians and plumbers to painters and landscapers. For our entire renovation, we used over 25 different vendors and spent over $35K in Moxey!\n\nTracey & Bart Zimmerman American Printing\n\nI have used Moxey as a part of my business for many years. Moxey has a strong network of businesses that offer great service and value to me and my company. The Moxey team helped me save cash and increased my revenue so it's great to be able to share Moxey with fellow business owners. The referral program is easy, painless and allows me to say, 'I have a person' when asked about resources to help my fellow business owners thrive. I know Moxey will provide the same professional and responsive service to my contacts that I have experienced myself. I would definitely recommend Moxey to everyone who owns their own business.\n\nRoger Villerie Villere's Florist\n\nMoxey has had a huge impact on my business' growth and development. I've been able to renovate and expand my business, which helped me save a lot of cash in the process. I'd highly recommend any local business to be a Moxey member. You won't regret it.\n\nErick Martin Echo Tango"
