        "text": "News Release > Entergy Louisiana Begins Construction on $100M Reliability Project\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nEntergy Louisiana Begins Construction on $100M Reliability Project\n\n02/05/2018\n\nJENNINGS, La. – Construction will start Tuesday, Feb. 6, on Entergy Louisiana’s $100 million technological upgrade to its electric power transmission grid in Jefferson Davis Parish. The project will enhance reliability, increase transmission capacity and help ensure the availability of affordable power now and into the future for the parish.\n\n“This project represents Entergy Louisiana’s ongoing commitment to providing reliable, affordable electricity to our customers while helping grow our state’s economy,” said Chip Arnould, senior region manager of customer service for Entergy Louisiana.\n\nFirst announced in December, the upgrade covers approximately 900 square miles, almost all of which is within Jefferson Davis Parish, and encompasses the construction of some new transmission lines as well as rebuilding many existing lines. Both the new and rebuilt sections of line will use steel structures that can withstand winds of up to 140 miles per hour and employ reinforced high-voltage wire that will move power more reliably and efficiently.\n\nConstruction of the transmission lines will begin during the first week of February along Highway 395 between Grand Marais Road and Doise Road. The project’s traffic and signage plan has been approved by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and will include one lane closure of Hwy 395 (southbound/ eastbound) for the next few months. The plan includes flaggers stationed on either end of the work zone to ensure safety for both the crews and the public.\n\nIn total, the project will add or upgrade over 58 miles of transmission and distribution lines. Depending upon weather and other variables, the project will conclude by February 2020.\n\nEntergy has developed a detailed communication plan to keep communities, businesses, institutions and government agencies up-to-date on the project's progress. Entergy representatives will work closely with regulatory, governmental and other key stakeholders to develop detailed execution and traffic control plans.\n\nResidents should expect lane closures and possible traffic delays associated with this work. Residents will want to remain aware and exercise caution when entering construction zones as crews will be working in various areas daily. Adequate signage to help the public safely navigate around project work areas will be provided.\n\nEntergy has identified a few locations that will require brief service interruptions as a result of this project. Entergy will provide advance notice to all affected customers so customers can plan accordingly.\n\nEntergy Louisiana, LLC provides electric service to more than 1 million customers and natural gas service to nearly 93,000 customers in the greater Baton Rouge area. With operations in southern, central and northeastern Louisiana, the company is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation.\n\nEntergy Corporation is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, including nearly 9,000 megawatts of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Entergy has annual revenues of approximately $10.8 billion and nearly 13,000 employees.\n\n-30-\n\nentergylouisiana.com\n\nfacebook.com/EntergyLA"
