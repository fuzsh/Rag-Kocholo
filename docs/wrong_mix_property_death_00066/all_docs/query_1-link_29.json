        "text": "Jefferson Davis and His Generals: The Failure of Confederate Command in the West. By Steven E. Woodworth. Lawrence, KA: University Press of Kansas, 1990. 380 pgs.\n\nJefferson Davis and His Generals: The Failure of Confederate Command in the West. By Steven E. Woodworth. (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1990. Pp. 380. Cloth.)\n\nSteven E. Woodworths first book, Jefferson Davis and His Generals: The Failure of Confederate Command in the West, places the Southern failure in the Western theater of the Civil War clearly on the backs on Jefferson Davis and the generals he picked to lead the struggle for Southern Independence. Much like some of the generals discussed herein, the author is fearless in his opinions and judgments, willing to criticize long-admired heroes as well as uplift would be dogs and villains. Moreover, Woodworth includes additional bits regarding social issues such as balls, courtships, spa vacations, and weddings, leading some readers to wonder whether the Confederate generals were not more concerned with their place in Southern society then with victory. Ultimately, blame falls over most of those involved in the conduct of the war in the West.\n\nJefferson Davis receives both praise and criticism throughout the work. Jefferson Davis wanted no more than to be a general in the Civil War and most certainly did not expect to become president of the Confederacy. In establishing the command structure, he utilized his prior experience as Secretary of War to good use, creating a more modern staff then the North. However, one of Daviss primary faults appears immediately. Davis picked most of his generals in the West based upon politics and friendship, with the worst example of this being the bishop-general, Leonidas Polk. Polk, a very old friend of Davis who had not served in the military following his graduation at West Point, becomes the symbol of the all the errors which Davis committed. Davis picked the inexperience Episcopalian bishop as major general largely because of established friendship, then rationalized his usefulness. Polk proceeded to invade Kentucky, driving the necessary border state into Northern hands. He then repeatedly disobeys his commanding officers, executes commands poorly, and leads other generals into distrust of their commanding officer, until he finally dies. Generals like Polk gave the Western command an appearance of old ladies bickering over recipes and old slights. Only a few generals receive praise in the book: Albert S. Johnston, Braxton Bragg, Pat Cleburne, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, though are still presented with their faults.\n\nThe many follies and foibles of the generals appear related to the very causes of the war itself. Southern Honor and Southern Pride led these generals and Davis to hold to principals and values which sometimes prevented them from engaging in the most effective campaign. Each general believed in his own strength and genius, even if they lacked command experience, which most all of them did. Generals such as Pierre G. T. Beauregard, Joseph E. Johnston, and John B. Hood received substantial criticism for their various shortcomings, whether too much creativity, too much timidity, or vision limited to attacking.\n\nFor all that Woodworth reviews the entire Western Campaign and its generals, the focus of the work is on President Davis. Davis receives praise for some of his strategic decisions, but receives considerable criticism for his decision to divide the Western and Trans-Mississippi commands. This unnatural separation allowed Union to divide the South, as the divided command could not work together. Davis appointed weak generals to supervise weak generals and separated division artificially, leading to dangerous disputes as to authority and command. Davis remained loyal to his friends, well past the point where they caused considerable damage to his cause. He also failed to support his commanders adequately, whether with sufficient men and supplies, or supporting officers such as Bragg against unwarranted malicious campaigns. Overall, it was his choice of generals which paid horrendous dividends.\n\nDavis could not admit error. Full of pride, he always felt he had to be right at all times. Any decision he made was the correct one. He believed in his own military genius, but failed to fully understand the evolving nature of warfare. The author notes that Davis never understood Grant success at Vicksburg, even twenty years after the war. In the end, Davis is best summed up here: He was a brave, determined, hard-working, and intelligent man, trying desperately, but never quite succeeding, to fill a role that was simply too big for him. (pg 301-302) Davis comes out as a near-great whose failures compounded other problems which the South faced.\n\nOverall, Woodworth has crafted a very readable review of the leadership of the Western campaign for the Confederacy. Ultimately, his work presents the shortcomings of the generals in such a way as to cause the reader to wonder whether correct decisions by Davis, especially regarding commanders, would have resulted in a different result. At the very least, the Union benefited from the failures of the Southern leaders and thereby these failures assisted in the ultimate defeat of the South.\n\nPeter Pratt\n\nJefferson Davis and His Generals: The Failure of Confederate Command in the West. By Steven E. Woodworth. (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1990. Pp. 380. Cloth.)\n\nSteven E. Woodworth, an associate professor of history at Texas Christian University, is among the growing number of historians who profess that the Union and Confederacy won and lost the American Civil War in the vast expanse between the Appalachian Mountains and the valley of the Mississippi River. While the Eastern Theater, the realm of Robert Edward Lee and his legendary Army of Northern Virginia, has received more attention from Civil War historians, it has become customary to accept the prevailing argument that Civil War armies determined the future of the United States in the Western Theater. Drawing on the extensive holdings of the Jefferson Davis Association at Rice University, Woodworth examines the problems of Confederate command and the role of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in the decisive theater of the war in Jefferson Davis and His Generals: The Failure of Confederate Command in the West, winner of the New York Civil War Round Tables distinguished Fletcher Pratt Award.\n\nWoodworth begins his assessment of Daviss handling of the West by outlining his subjects credentials, establishing a central question, and explaining his methodology. At the wars inception, few Southerners seemed better qualified for the position of commander-in-chief than Kentucky-native Jefferson Davis. He was a West Point graduate, a Mexican War veteran, a three-time Mississippi senator, and an innovative secretary of war under President Franklin Pierce. Despite Daviss experience, the Confederacy failed in its bid for independence, and it is the fundamental purpose of Jefferson Davis and His Generals to explain how a man of his obvious qualifications could fall short of the goal he seemed so well prepared to attain (p. xii). In analyzing this problem, Woodworth dismisses the Confederate presidents previous supporters and detractors as either too hagiographic or overly critical and provides a broad in-depth study on the interaction of the unique personality of Jefferson Davis with the equally unique personalities of his generals within the crucible of war (p. xiii).\n\nThroughout the narrative, Woodworth examines nearly every controversy that arose concerning the Western Theater, including the violation of Kentucky neutrality, the failure to defend Tennessee, the inability to exploit the initial success at the battle of Shiloh, the clumsy division of the Western and Trans-Mississippi Theaters along the Mississippi River, the collapse of cooperation at Vicksburg, the defeat at Chattanooga, and the loss of Atlanta. According to Woodworth, the ultimate responsibility for all of these failures rests on the shoulders of President Davis, but he does not dismiss the role the department generals played. It is clear that field commanders shouldered some of the blame. After all, Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, Braxton Bragg, Simon Bolivar Buckner, George Bibb Crittenden, Earl Van Dorn, Nathan Bedford Forrest, John Bell Hood, Albert Sidney Johnston, Joseph Eggleston Johnston, John Hunt Morgan, John Clifford Pemberton, Gideon Johnson Pillow, Edmund Kirby Smith, Felix Zollicoffer, and others were a contentious and fastidious group. Davis hand picked a number of these men, and it was his responsibility as commander-in-chief to make sure they cooperated.\n\nWhile Woodworth defends Davis to an extent, referring to him as a man of great abilities and great determination, the Confederate president is the pivotal character in the authors estimation of the Confederacys failure to win the war (p. 314). Jefferson Davis and His Generals outlines four flaws that led to Daviss demise. First, Davis showcased a tendency to have too much faith in his friends. His failure to be objective in matters that concerned his comrades did immeasurable damage to the Confederate cause, especially in the cases of A. S. Johnston and Polk. Second, Davis demonstrated a propensity to quibble over technicalities and a desire to be recognized as always being right (p. 315). Davis occasionally let his pride distract him, and at one point he even allowed a disagreement with Secretary of War George Wythe Randolph to determine the overall strategy for dividing the Western and Trans-Mississippi Theaters along the Mississippi River. Davis also exhibited a proclivity to overwork himself to the point of illness. Physically weak and susceptible to bouts of neuralgia and dyspepsia, Davis was often bedridden and incapable of making sound decisions. Finally, [t]he Confederate president found it almost impossibly difficult not to be hesitant and indecisive (p. 316). Burdened with an amazing responsibility with almost no margin for error, Davis lacked the ability to make excruciatingly difficult decisions quickly, surely, and correctly (p. 316).\n\nIn the end, Woodworth provides a well-written and impeccably-researched account of Confederate difficulties in the West. Jefferson Davis and His Generals presents a captivating portrait of the Confederate president and does well to capture the complicated nature of Daviss personality. Ultimately, Woodworth concludes that Jefferson Davis was a brave, determined, hard-working, and intelligent man, trying desperately, but never quite succeeding, to fill a role that was simply too big for him (pp. 301-302).\n\nJason Mann Frawley\n\nTexas Christian University"
