        "text": "On June 17, 2015, Dylann Roof murdered nine black parishioners at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. That hate crime prompted South Carolina to remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of the state capitol, and communities throughout the country debated the continued presence of monuments to the Confederacy in the public square.\n\nThat December, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu signed an ordinance to remove four monuments. These include statues of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Confederate Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, as well as a commemoration of those who opposed Reconstruction. Over the past several weeks, after one monument was removed, a number of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations have rocked the city; at least five people have been arrested, and law enforcement has expressed concern over the number of heavily armed demonstrators. Landrieu says he plans to take down the remaining three.\n\nDavid W. Blight is a professor of American history and the director of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at Yale University.\n\nWhat strikes you as new about this particular controversy in comparison to other flare-ups in the past?\n\nWhat does seem unique about the New Orleans case is that they managed to get an ordinance or resolution through the city council and supported by the mayor. That's unusual — for a major city to take it upon itself to decide to move such big monuments. I don't know of many other cases where that has happened. But, of course, the broader context here is everything we have been living through since the massacre in Charleston, and to some extent before that because of protests against police shootings and so on. We have never before experienced a wave of concern about Confederate iconography, flags, memorials, etc. like we have in the year [plus] after Charleston. No one could have predicted it. You have a real resistance to this sort of thing that may not have materialized without that event.\n\nWhat was unique about New Orleans' war experience and the way the war is remembered there?\n\nFor one thing, New Orleans was occupied by the Union forces very early in the war, as early as April of 1862. So for most of the war, the city was occupied. However, after the war and during Reconstruction, New Orleans saw some of the worst violence against Reconstruction.\n\nAnd one of the memorials being removed is, in effect, a memorial to a massacre that occurred in New Orleans during Reconstruction. This is as much about the way Reconstruction is remembered or forgotten as it is Civil War heroes and iconography. New Orleans was a special case. There was a huge riot in New Orleans, which really turned into a massacre against the black community in 1866, and then there were acts of mob violence against black voters.\n\nAnd Beauregard, for whom one of the statues was erected, became part of post-war Louisiana life, correct?\n\nHe did. He didn't really become a scalawag, that is turning over to the Republican Party and so on, but he did express some positive sentiments about possible black rights, although I am not sure about black equality. He moderated a great deal.\n\nWe call it pivoting now.\n\nPivoting, yes! He went into business after the war, but his statue is of course a military statue. He is remembered in that monument for his role in the war, not during Reconstruction. In fact, Reconstruction is almost never commemorated in memorials or monuments. It's always the war.\n\nThe monuments are right in the heart of New Orleans. The equation here has become, for those resisting the monuments, and understandably, that anything Confederate is a memorial to white supremacy.\n\nThose who defend the monuments who have Confederate ancestors say that they weren't white supremacists, and that the monuments are about soldiers and sacrifice and valor. Where do those two arguments ever meet? You have to have descendants of Confederates willing to say that the cause was either deeply flawed or terrible. Yes, people fought with valor and courage, but for a cause that was holding back history. There are some white Southerners who do that, but they don't get much attention.\n\nI read a letter calling for the removal of the New Orleans monuments from a history professor at Tulane, Randy Sparks, in which he wrote, \"My ancestors were slave owners who fought for the Confederacy. I take no pride in that, nor am I ashamed of it. They were men of their time and place. But this is our time, and our place.\" I thought that was well-put.\n\nIt is. And if you were directly descended, what are you going to do, disown him? But Randy Sparks is a very good historian of slavery and the slave trade. He is doing his part to right the wrongs of history. But facing that past is never easy for people.\n\nIn New Orleans, the people charged with taking down the monuments have been disguising their identities, and companies have been afraid to do the physical work of removing them, because of threats. Is that normal in situations like this?\n\nNo. This is pretty new. Especially the stuff about guys walking around with AK-47s. That is terrifying and does seem new. The only way you can begin to interpret that is as a backlash. Friends in the South tell me there are far more Confederate flags, especially in rural areas, six months after Charleston than there were before. And Trump's election may have emboldened people as well.\n\nLet's step back from the Confederacy specifically, and consider this subject from a more generic perspective. Whether it's a statue to Saddam Hussein or whoever else, is there a case against erasing these things because they are part of history, and for looking at them for what they represent about the people who erected them in the first place?\n\nYes, of course there is. You can't erase everything from the past. If you set out to erase every Confederate monument that would take a few lifetimes. But having said that, these things are all about politics and the present.\n\nYou mentioned Saddam Hussein: You had a regime that took over a country and ran a brutal dictatorship and fell when he was deposed. It isn't surprising that monuments were pulled down. The problem with America is that this was a Civil War that involved the whole country, and the South couldn't go anywhere. The losers were not going to go away. About 6,000 of them went into exile in Brazil and England and Canada and other places, but even some of them came back.\n\nThe loser in this war was always going to be here. And the problem was that the \"lost cause\" tradition that these monuments tend to represent, because that's when they were put up — the late 19th, early 20th century — gained a deep, deep foothold, and not just in the South.\n\nBut there is an argument to be very careful when you erase history. It's a dangerous thing to do, because next year someone will want to erase history you think should be preserved. We went through all of this at Yale University last year with the changing of the name of Calhoun College.\n\nIf you were in charge of historical memory around slavery in the United States —\n\nIf you had a Cabinet position called \"Secretary of American Historical Memory\"? [Laughs.]\n\nYou might have to wait for another administration for that to happen. But are there principles you think should be followed?\n\nOne thing that is always an answer is: To build new monuments rather than tear down old ones. The only monument about black soldiers in the Civil War for a century was the famous one in Boston, the Shaw Memorial, a sculpture by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a magnificent monument in Boston Common. But it was alone. There now are a few.\n\nAre you still constantly amazed at the speed with which Confederates, especially Robert E. Lee, became heroes after the war throughout the entire country?\n\nIt took some time before Northerners of any scale warmed up to Lee, but it did happen by the turn of the 20th century. It happened in part because the Confederacy was allowed to craft its own legacy, to build its own memorials, to create its own story, and historical memory is always about the politics of who gets to control the story.\n\nLee is gone in 1870. He didn't write a memoir like Jefferson Davis, who wrote this long, turgid, 1,200-page defense of slavery and states' rights. Lee doesn't do that. And he was portrayed as this Christian solider-hero who fought for his home. Some of that is nonsense. Lee was a Confederate nationalist who fought for its cause and knew the cause. But in the popular memory, he became the military figure who was overwhelmed by, as he put it himself, superior numbers and forces. And fought to the bitter end as a good Christian.\n\nThere was something attractive about that in the 19th and early 20th centuries because they saw Lee as one figure among many whose image could begin to reconcile the country. And his image became as much the man who became a college president for a couple of years as it did the aggressive Confederate nationalist who fought to the bitter end to destroy the United States. Nobody puts that on a Lee monument.\n\nThis Q&A was conducted, edited and condensed by Slate contributor Isaac Chotiner.\n\nDavid W.
