        "text": "Ordering a Death Certificate\n\nWhat is a death certificate?\n\nA death certificate is an official legal document that includes information from a person's death record. In Pennsylvania, a death certificate is printed on specialized security paper that contains a raised seal. This document is frequently used for closing financial accounts, settling estates, claiming life insurance and pension beneficiary benefits, cancelling accounts or re-establishing the account holder contact with utility companies, and serving as documentation for a widow/widower to remarry.\n\nOur office only issues death certificates for deaths that occurred in Pennsylvania since 1906.\n\nYou will receive a certified \"No Record Certification of Death\" if you request a certificate and we cannot identify or find a record using the information you provided. Therefore, please provide as much information as possible to assist us in locating the requested death record.\n\nFor death certificates from other states: If you need a certificate for someone that died in another state, see the National Center for Health StatisticsOpens In A New Window' website for contact information.\n\nHow do I apply for a death certificate?\n\nFor online services: You may order a death certificate online (24 hours/day, 7 days/week) from Pennsylvania's only authorized vendor at mycertificates.health.pa.gov. In addition to the standard death certificate fee of $20, a $10 processing fee also applies. Payment is by credit card. Delivery options are first class mail through the United States Postal Service or pick up at a Vital Records Office.\n\nPlease note that the Department of Health processes requests for all orders. Online service providers collect your order and submit it to our office for processing. VitalChek is the only authorized vendor who collects orders on our behalf. All other online service providers convert your orders to a paper application. Therefore, expect a delay in service if you use an online service provider other than VitalChek.\n\nIf you ordered through another online vendor and have experienced a problem in obtaining the certificate, you will need to contact that vendor directly for resolution. If you believe a vendor provides inaccurate information about our services or fees, you may contact the consumer protection office in the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office or the consumer protection agency in the state where you reside or the state where the vendor is located for further assistance.\n\nFor walk-in services: Please see our Public Office page for office locations and hours of operation.\n\nFor mail services: You may complete an Application for Death Certificate and mail it to the address listed below. All certificates are mailed using First Class MailÂ®.\n\nDivision of Vital Records\n\nDeath Certificate Processing Unit\n\nPO Box 1528\n\nNew Castle, PA 16103\n\nWho can apply for a death certificate?\n\nYou must complete the following requirements to receive a death certificate.\n\nYou must complete an Application for Death Certificate.\n\nYou must show valid identification.\n\nYou must sign your application.\n\nYou must be an eligible applicant.

It may take longer if we need to resolve application issues, for genealogical requests, or if your application involves a subpoena, court order, or power of attorney. Requests for changes to a death record may also require additional processing.\n\nWhat is the cost for a death certificate?\n\nThe cost for a death certificate is $20 each regardless of the quantity that you order. This fee is established in accordance with Pennsylvania's Administrative Code of 1929. Payment is deposited upon receipt of your application and is not refundable."
