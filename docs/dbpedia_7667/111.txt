The Voice of OC has takenÂ at least one staffer from a publication close to its own heart.

The Voice of San Diego on Wednesday blogged about the departure of David Washburn, the nonprofit investigative site’s science reporter. He’ll be heading up to his former employer’s newborn Orange County counterpart –which is affiliated in name and spirit only–where he’ll serve as managing editor.

“It’s a great get for us,” Santana says. “It was something important to have in that one and two slot people who had a knowledge of each others’ working styles.”
