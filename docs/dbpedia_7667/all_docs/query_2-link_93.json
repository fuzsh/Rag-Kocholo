Mediation is a confidential process conducted by highly trained Court Mediators who assist the parents by facilitating a cooperative dialogue focusing on the developmentally appropriate needs of their children. It is the task of the Court Mediator to create a safe, neutral setting in which parents may discuss and resolve issues related to the parenting of their children.\n\nHow can child custody mediation help parents?\n\nA skilled and trained Court Mediator can encourage parents to focus on and understand the needs of their children and assist them in developing a parenting plan that considers the best interest of the child and the needs of each family member. What is discussed between the parents and the Court Mediator is not shared with anyone, including the Court. Child abuse is an exception to this rule.\n\nWho conducts the child custody mediation?\n\nChild custody mediation is conducted by Court Mediators who are skilled professionals with at least a Master's Degree and extensive clinical experience in the fields of psychology, marriage, family and child counseling. Statutory training requirements include: domestic violence and its effects on children; substance abuse; child sexual abuse; family dynamics; the effects of divorce and separation on children; and the developmental needs of children.\n\nHow does child custody mediation work?\n\nCourt Mediators understand that parents know their children better than anyone else and want to do what is best for them. The Court Mediator listens carefully to the concerns and ideas of each parent, and encourages the parents to listen to one another with an open mind. The goal is to help parents discuss and develop a parenting plan that reflects the developmental needs of their children and one that enhances the quality of their lives.\n\nHow do I access Family Court Services?\n\nMost of the work of Family Court Services is generated by court filings and petitions which are related to children in the Family Law and Juvenile Courts. We do offer, at no cost, mediation services to parents who want to resolve custody or visitation disputes without filing for a court hearing. This is called \"informal mediation\" and can be scheduled by calling (657) 622-6196 for an appointment. It is not necessary to have an attorney to participate in the mediation process.\n\nLegal Terms Related to Custody and Visitation:\n\nLegal Custody: The rights and responsibilities of parents to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of their children.\n\nJoint Legal Custody: Both parents share in the right and responsibility to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of a child.\n\nSole Legal Custody: One parent has the right and responsibility to make decisions relating to the health, education and welfare of a child.\n\nPhysical Custody:How much time the children spend with each parent; where the children live; how day-to-day responsibilities are fulfilled.\n\nJoint Physical Custody: Children spend a significant amount of time with each parent.\n\nSole Physical Custody: Children reside primarily with one parent and have visitation with the other parent.\n\nJoint Custody: This term means both joint legal and joint physical custody. Parents agree to share it all.\n\nVisitation: Times when one parent has the children and is fully responsible for them.\n\nSupervised Visitation: Visitation is limited to special situations in which a third party, specified by the Court, is present. Supervised, monitored visitation may occur when there is a need to protect children because of drug or alcohol abuse, child abuse or neglect, family violence, or other serious problems, or when children are getting to know an absent parent.\n\nWhat is a Parenting Plan?\n\nA Parenting Plan is an agreement between the parents that spells out the specific details of custody and visitation arrangements for their children.\n\nQuestion: What are some options for a Parenting Plan?\n\nOptions for Parenting Plans may differ, depending on the individual circumstances of each family and the age of the children.\n\nExamples:\n\nPrimary custody arrangements often include alternate weekends, a mid-week visit, and alternating holidays, special days and summer vacations with the other parent.\n\nJoint custody arrangements allow for the children to spend a significant amount of time in each parent's home.\n\nMinimizing the need for child care by arranging time so that each parent has the child during their days or hours off from work, when they can spend time with and care for the child, thus maximizing the children's time with both parents.\n\nGuidelines for various Parenting Plans may be obtained by calling Family Court Services (657) 622-6196.\n\nDo Court Mediators give legal advice?\n\nCourt Mediators are not attorneys and cannot advise anyone regarding legal practices or procedures. Court Mediators can answer questions about the court process.\n\nBack to top\n\nChild Custody Investigations: General Information\n\nThe Court may order an investigation in custody or visitation disputes if the judge believes that it is necessary to resolve complex issues such as safety of the children. Court Mediators and attorneys may also recommend to the Court that an investigation be conducted if, in their judgment, it would help to clarify allegations and promote settlement of issues in the best interest of the children.\n\nThe minimum educational requirements for a child custody investigator are established by law and the California Rules of Court. Generally, the investigator must possess a Masters Degree in Psychology, Social Work, Counseling, or Marriage and Family Therapy. Furthermore, investigators are required to have training in several areas including the developmental needs of children, family dynamics, domestic violence, safety assessment and child abuse. For more information on the education, training and experience requirements for child custody investigators see California Family Code 3110.5 and California Rule of Court 5.225c-i.\n\nThere are some tasks that are completed in every investigation, including the following: criminal history checks are completed on each parent; child protection agencies provide reports regarding investigations into allegations of child abuse involving the parents, any of the parent’s children and the children who are subjects of the child custody investigation. If pertinent, police reports and school records may also be obtained.\n\nThe investigator will also speak with relevant witnesses (social workers, teachers, therapists, law enforcement officials, and persons who have directly observed incidents.) The investigator will not speak to \"character witnesses,\" multiple persons who have observed the same incident, persons who want to offer their opinions about one of the parents, persons whose information is second hand, gossip, or not relevant to the investigation.\n\nYes, if a household occupant provides any caretaking for the child. The following persons will have background checks completed: Any adult relatives living in your home; cohabitating girlfriend or boyfriend; spouse, domestic partners.\n\nUnless ordered by the court, no criminal background check will be completed on an adult occupant in the home who does not participate in the caretaking of the child and does not fit the descriptions stated in the previous paragraph. However, a criminal background check may be conducted on this person, or if the investigator discovers information that may precipitate the need for a criminal background check.\n\nThe investigator will only speak to persons that have made direct observations of events or behaviors that are relevant to the issues identified by the court. You should be prepared to tell the investigator specifically what information the witness will likely report. Witnesses that tend to have more impact are those who are usually viewed as objective, such as police officers, school officials, and social workers.\n\nHowever, witnesses that may be viewed as aligned with one parent may also provide important information, especially if they have observed behaviors of one or both parents. Witnesses that are not likely to be spoken to are those who have observed events from the distant past (except for incidents of domestic violence or child abuse), character witnesses, etc.\n\nComplete the Parent Information Packet and provide it to your investigator. Have relevant documents, report cards, names and numbers of witnesses immediately available.\n\nThe time of each investigation varies. Such factors as complex issues, levels of conflict, or the availability of witnesses affects the time the investigator must spend to complete the investigation. The range varies, usually between 20 and 30 hours.\n\nNot usually. The costs of investigation are charged on an hourly basis to the parties. The costs of Partial Investigations have ranged from $600.00 to $3,500.00. Full Investigations have ranged from $1,200.00 to $4,500.\n\nOftentimes, yes. However, based on factors in your case, the judge may require the investigation to go forward even though both parties would like to make an agreement. This may occur when there are allegations of domestic violence, child abuse/negligence or substance abuse. In most cases the parties are allowed to make agreements.\n\nYes. Investigators are also trained court mediators. You may contact the Supervising Court Mediator, who can then schedule you for a mediation session.\n\nAll child custody investigations evaluate both parents. While there may be several allegations or concerns about the other parent, the court will want information regarding the quality of parenting of each parent.\n\nThere is one investigator assigned to each case.\n\nYou cannot require the investigator have any characteristics, such as gender, race, etc. The responsibility of the investigator is to conduct the investigation in an impartial manner, and to make an evaluation and recommendations based on the evidence obtained in the investigation. Investigators are trained to maintain objectivity and to focus primarily on the best interest of the children.\n\nChild Custody Investigations: Interviews/Home Visits\n\nThe interviews of the parents are approximately 45-90 minutes in length; interviews of the children vary in length.\n\nEach parent will be interviewed in person one-time. Parents may be contacted by the investigator if the investigator has follow-up questions or needs additional information. Usually children are interviewed once.\n\nIf you are having a Partial Child Custody Investigation there will not be a home visit. Partial Investigation interviews are conducted at the office of Family Court Services.\n\nIn Full Child Custody Investigations, the children may be seen in each parent’s home; however this is not required and is at the discretion of the investigator. Such factors as court orders, geographical distance, school and work schedules may preclude this from happening.\n\nIf the court ordered a Partial Child Custody Investigation, there will not be an in-home evaluation. If the court has ordered a Full Child Custody Investigation, the investigator will be coming to your home. Home visits will be limited to residences in the following counties: Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino.\n\nThe general limit is age 5. However, at the discretion of the investigator, younger children, may be interviewed. The investigator is trained in conducting interviews with children.\n\nChildren are interviewed alone. The investigator must make efforts to reduce the possibility that what the child reports is influenced by the presence of one of the parents. There are cases when the child and the parent are observed together, but the child must also be interviewed alone.\n\nA summary of what your child reports to the investigator will be provided in the investigative report. Interviews with children are not confidential. However, the investigator will not review the child’s interview with you.\n\nInterviews by phone present limits that may impact the quality of the interview. The investigator cannot observe non-verbal communication, nor engage in a discussion that is as spontaneous or thorough as a meeting in-person. However, there are circumstances that cannot be overcome, when a telephone interview must occur. Generally, if you reside in one of the counties adjacent to Orange County, or in Ventura County, you will need to appear in person for your interview.\n\nAttorneys are not permitted to be present.\n\nYou may need to miss work. Appointments for interviews are scheduled during regular Court business hours, between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. There are no evening or weekend appointments. It is likely your child will miss some school the date of the interview.\n\nChild Custody Investigations: After the Investigation\n\nAfter the investigation has been completed, contact between parents or a third party and the investigator is not allowed to occur. This restriction is in place to avoid the appearance of favoritism, bias or special treatment. However, you may contact the Supervising Mediator to address questions you may have.\n\nOnce the report is filed with the court, it cannot be changed. However, if there is new information the investigator may file an addendum to the report. If an addendum is filed, the investigator will state in the addendum whether or not the new information has any effect on the evaluation or recommendations made in the original report.\n\nYou (or your attorney) may object to the investigator's report at your court hearing. You may voice your concerns and disagreements with the report to the judicial officer hearing your case. You may subpoena the investigator to appear at the hearing; you can then question the investigator regarding those aspects of the report you disagree with. The subpoena must be served five (5) calendar days before the hearing.\n\nMore FAQs\n\nWhat are the requirements if I or the person that I want to marry is under 18 years-of-age?\n\nIf you are under the age of 18 and want to marry, you must have the approval of your parents and a Court Order (per Family Code Sections 302-304) approving the marriage before you can obtain a marriage license. Trained staff interview the parents of the underage party and the couple, and assess their readiness for marriage. A written report is then sent to the Court with recommendations to grant or deny the underage marriage request. It is the Court's decision to grant or deny the request.\n\nSeparating and divorcing can be difficult for both adults and children.
