        "text": "Four Washington County school board incumbents face four challengers\n\nFour of the seven seats on the Washington County Board of Education are up for election this year. All four incumbents are running and they, as well as four challengers, are progressing to the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nThe school board race is a nonpartisan election. Board members serve four-year terms, with about half of the board seats up for election every two years.\n\nWashington County Public Schools (WCPS) reported having more than 22,500 students during the 2023-2024 school year. The public school system, which has about 3,700 employees, is one of the largest employers in the county.\n\nThe school board participates in strategic planning for the school system, reviews and approves policies, evaluates the superintendent annually, considers program proposals, approves school calendars and helps develop and manage the budget as well as approving budgets. The school board does not have taxing authority. The school system receives most of its funding from the county and state governments with school board members submitting funding requests to the Board of County Commissioners.\n\nA raise goes into effect for the school board seats filled in this fall's election. Members will be paid $13,500 a year, while the board president will make $14,000 a year.\n\nMeet the candidates for Washington County school board\n\nVictoria Beachley\n\nBeachley, who will be 34 by the general election and lives in Hagerstown, is the mother of two young children. The youngest child uses birth to kindergarten services provided through the school system. She earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from North Carolina State University and has a graduate certificate in supply chain management from the University of Pennsylvania Global Campus. Beachley said she has experience in finance and supply chain operations management, having worked for JLG for several years. She and her husband, Ryan, own Sixth Avenue Custom furniture in Hagerstown and Carriage Hill Custom Cabinets in Frederick, Md. Beachley ran unsuccessfully for Washington County commissioner in 2022.\n\nWhy are you running for school board? As the mother of one child using WCPS services and another child approaching preschool age, Beachley said she cares about the public education system. Beachley also said she has been frustrated with the lack of board members who hear or listen to parents. \"It's always good to get a fresh perspective.\"\n\nMain issues: Ensuring the board is being fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars, focusing the money on students and staff. Improving the management of disruptive student behavior in classrooms.\n\nPieter Bickford\n\nBickford, who will be 53 by the general election, lives in Hagerstown. He is seeking a third term on the school board. A North Hagerstown High School graduate, Bickford earned a bachelor's degree in communications with a minor in politics from Ithaca (N.Y.) College. He is a marketing executive for High Rock Studios. Bickford has previously worked as a journalist for WBAL Radio in Baltimore and Hagerstown's WHAG-TV. He also was the editor-in-chief of a local events guide.\n\nWhy are you running for school board? The son and husband of educators, Bickford said he's always been fascinated with education. Despite the challenges, he said he enjoys the \"substantive work\" and being part of a school system committed to doing better for students.\n\nMain issues: Getting students with behavioral issues to the right program and getting them involved with those programs as quickly as possible. Bickford, as a parent, dealt with the issue of disciplinary problems in the schools when his child was bullied in school. He also said he wants to continue work related to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, which has created seismic shifts in education funding while getting some things right and other things still need to be figured out.\n\nCharles A. Burkett\n\nBurkett, 57, lives near Hagerstown. He graduated from Clear Spring High School and took classes at Hagerstown Business College and Antietam Bible College. He is a ministry support coordinator and elder/board member at Calvary Chapel of the Cumberland Valley. He has served as a substitute teacher for WCPS. He used to own Burkett's Deli at 23 N. Locust St. and CB Properties, which served as a landlord for some commercial and residential properties. He also started Servtec Inc., a commercial cleaning business he operated for about 20 years. Burkett said his four children were home-schooled with one attending WCPS for several years. He said he has/had foster children who attended WCPS. Asked why his children were home-schooled, Burkett said it was because of concerns with the direction the school system was heading regarding what was being taught as well as behavioral issues in schools. Burkett ran unsuccessfully for Washington County commissioner in 2018 and 2022. He was appointed to a vacancy on the commissioners board in 2021.\n\nWhy are you running for school board? Has concerns regarding school system spending and how behavior issues are addressed in schools.\n\nMain issues: Safe schools, fiscal responsibility and parents being able to \"opt in\" for their students regarding use of school library materials. He also said WCPS should permit home-schooled students to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs because their parents pay local taxes.\n\nAshley McCusker\n\nMcCusker, 37, of Hancock, is running for public office for the first time. She has two children in Washington County Public Schools. She is a graduate of Hancock Middle Senior High School and Allegany (Md.)

McCusker was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that was filed last year after the Maryland State Board of Elections rejected the Hancock Town Hall as the second of three early voting centers proposed by the Washington County Board of Elections and approved by the county commissioners. Her husband is Hancock Councilman Josh McCusker.\n\nWhy are you running for school board? Noting she has children in WCPS, McCusker said she's running as a \"voice for parents.\" As a parent, \"we feel unheard.\"\n\nMain issues: Will work toward more discipline in classrooms and consequences for students who are disruptive. Students and staff \"deserve a safe and productive school/work environment.\" She does not want a \"woke\" curriculum or \"porn\" or sexually explicit materials in school libraries.

She said she wants to keep education in Washington County \"proceeding in the right direction for students and teachers and the community.\"\n\nMain issues: Spickler said the students will always come first and she will look at how things affect students and their education. She also said teachers need support. The latter includes the school system offering competitive salaries, having guidance counselors, and having behavior analysts to help students with behavior issues.\n\nStan Stouffer\n\nStouffer, who will be 78 by the general election, lives near Funkstown.

This includes money to expand special education services, help youths whose first language is not English, provide competitive salaries, and expand programs to help students with behavioral issues.\n\nMelissa Williams\n\nWilliams, 74, of Smithsburg, is seeking a fourth term on the school board. She is a retired WCPS educator who worked in the school system for 35 years in various positions, including as a classroom teacher, resource teacher and administrator.
