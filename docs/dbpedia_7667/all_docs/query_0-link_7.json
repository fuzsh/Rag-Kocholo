He’ll be heading up to his former employer’s newborn Orange County counterpart –which is affiliated in name and spirit only–where he’ll serve as managing editor.\n\n“It’s a great get for us,” Santana says. “It was something important to have in that one and two slot people who had a knowledge of each others’ working styles.”"
