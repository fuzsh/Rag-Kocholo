        "text": "Voice has been the greatest gift to our family since we started attending in 2022. It is the first church where our teens truly felt connected relationally through the youth ministry and opportunities to serve. The sermons are impactful and the leadership real and transparent. There is also such support when we have gone through tough times. Most importantly, Voice feels like a place where God has placed us to serve in the real work the church is doing for the Kingdom. We are so grateful to be part of this community.\n\nVoice church has helped us through some of the darkest and toughest times in our lives. The pastors and community genuinely reflect the true embodiment of selfless love, welcoming everyone who comes in with open arms despite their background or beliefs. We are so grateful to call Voice our family.\n\nThey say home is where the heart is. We call Voice our home because the heart of God is reflected in our church community. Oh, and we are also here for the donuts! üòÇüç©\n\nSince it's launch in 2018, we've called Voice Church home. We love the pastors, the awesome worship, and all the friendly volunteers. We especially enjoy the truthful and challenging teachings which stay true to the Love, Grace, Forgiveness, Guidance, and Discernment of the Word of God.\n\nWhen we were looking for a church to call home, we never expected to also find a family. Voice is our family. Our pastors are so inviting, kind, knowledgeable, and above all humble. The people are REAL and so generous. We‚Äôre so honored to be a part of such a diverse and loving community!\n\nVoice Church embraced us with open arms when we moved to Southern California from the East Coast. We love being a part of Voice because of the impact it has on the community, the diversity, the humble and passionate leaders who genuinely love every person who walks through their doors. We are very thankful to have found Voice.\n\nWhat I love about being a part of Voice is how welcomed I feel when I show up. Everyone has been so encouraging and helpful with my quest to continually build a stronger relationship with God. Voice has provided me with so many amazing opportunities to worship and serve, all while being super inviting to become a part of the church family.\n\nI came to Voice on the recommendation of a friend who said it was a place that would meet me where I was at while also challenging me to grow through the teaching. That first week felt pretty good so I decided to stick around. And I kept sticking around. It‚Äôs been almost four years now and I find myself calling Voice home in a way I was never able to do with a church before.\n\nMy wife and I had been looking for a church home for over a year and we are so happy that we found Voice Church. We stand behind Voice Church's values, principles and spiritual formations and we couldn't be more excited. The culture being formed, the community that is being established and the people in the team is what has become contagious!\n\nMy wife and I have been attending Voice for several months, and now call it home. We enjoy the diversity, the location, the small community feel, and the leadership. The pastor and his wife are super refreshing, have a big heart, and very relateable. Messages are not boring, and laced with funny references and quick wit.\n\nLike the Nirvana song says \"...come, as you are...\""
