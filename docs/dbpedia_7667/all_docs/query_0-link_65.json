Additionally, smaller percentages of respondents listed their employers in various other locations, including Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Beijing, China; Boston, Massachusetts; Kent, Washington; Oakland, California; Oxnard, California; Pacoima, California; Riverside, California; Sacramento, California; and Venice, California. These diverse geographic locations reflect the global and regional scope of urban planning work undertaken by graduates of the Class of 2023. Furthermore, 10.34% of respondents provided N/A as their employer location as they are unemployed or actively seeking employment\n\nModality of Employment\n\nThe survey responses from the Urban Planning Class of 2023 provide insights into the work arrangements of graduates, reflecting a diverse range of work schedules. A significant majority, comprising approximately 62% of respondents, reported working on a hybrid schedule, indicating a blend of in-person and remote work arrangements. This flexibility in work arrangements suggests adaptability to changing workplace dynamics and a willingness to accommodate remote and in-person work preferences. Additionally, 14% of respondents reported working exclusively in-person, suggesting a commitment to on-site work environments or roles that require physical presence. Similarly, 14% of respondents stated that they work remotely, highlighting the prevalence of remote work opportunities within the urban planning field, especially in light of technological advancements and changing workplace norms. Furthermore, 10% of respondents provided N/A as their work arrangement, indicating unemployment or active job-seeking status.\n\nSalary\n\nThe survey responses from the Urban Planning Class of 2023 provide an overview of the gross salary distribution among graduates. The salary range spans from $15,000 to $110,000, with $15,000 representing the lower end of the spectrum, likely attributed to a graduate working part-time (31 hours or less per week). The average gross salary across all respondents is $78,998.20, reflecting the mean earnings among the cohort. The median gross salary, representing the middle value in the salary distribution, is $79,000.00.\n\nThe following survey results provide information and statistics regarding where our Class of 2023 Undergraduate Program graduates work, sector, position within the organization, location and salary ranges.
