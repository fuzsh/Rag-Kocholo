The reporter gathered excellent quotes that conveyed the true pain felt by those impassioned by the issue.\n\nSecond Place: Daniel Langhorne, Daily Pilot, Nordic Star\n\nThird Place: Emily Rasmussen, Orange County Register, “Fraternity Cuts Ties With CSULB Amid Sexual Misconduct Investigations”\n\nBest Music/Entertainment Review\n\nFirst Place: Paul Hodgins, Voice of OC, “South Coast Rep’s Season Opener Plays With a Classic and Gets Mixed Results”\n\nComments: Even though I have not seen this play, nor am I a fan of Jane Austin, Hodgins’ critique helped me understand the play and reasoning behind the critique he offers. Hodgins is obviously well versed in the subject and delivers an educated, fair review without being heavy handed or insensitive.\n\nSecond Place: Timothy Mangan, Voice of OC, “Living Composers Reign During Choral Arts Initiative Concert”\n\nThird Place: Peter Lefevre, Voice of OC, “The Chorale Brings ‘The Creation’ to Segerstrom . . . Finally!”\n\nBest Arts/Culture Review\n\nFirst Place: Dave Barton, OC Weekly, “OCC’s ‘Jim DeFrance: A Retrospective’ Is a Graceful Ode to Life’s Release”\n\nComments: Descriptive and eloquent, Dave reels the reader in and is a captivating writer. Outstanding job!\n\nSecond Place: Richard Chang, LA Weekly, “The Broad’s Jasper Johns Exhibit Is a Must-See Survey”\n\nThird Place: Dave Barton, OC Weekly, “Female Victimization and Childhood Trauma Inform a Muddled Show at Grand Central Art Center”\n\nBest Food/Restaurant Review\n\nFirst Place: Brad A. Johnson, Orange County Register, “Journeyman’s Food & Drink”\n\nComments: Brad does a wonderful job of giving the reader a sense of place and you can tell he really does his homework on the background of the restaurants. This review engaged me from the first graph to the very end. He’s entertaining and someone I would follow consistently because of the smooth writing skills.\n\nSecond Place: Edwin Goei, OC Weekly, “Mr. Taco Nice in Anaheim Does Tacos and Pizzas and Taco Pizzas”\n\nThird Place: Brad A. Johnson, Orange County Register, “Oliver’s Osteria”\n\nBest Travel Story\n\nFirst Place: Anne Marie Panoringan, OC Weekly, “A Trip Through the Santa Ynez Backroads”\n\nComments: Finding treasure: Isn’t that what we all want from our travel writers? Panoringan’s guide through the Santa Ynez backroads is a map to buried treasure that just happens to be in the reader’s own backyard. Panoringan writes colorfully and clearly, slipping a full itinerary so smoothly into the story that it doesn’t bog down the prose or get in the way of her insider tips. Truly a travel story worth daydreaming about.\n\nSecond Place: Jessica Kwong, Orange County Register, “Is It Too Soon for Tourists to Return to Puerto Rico?”\n\nThird Place: Patrice Marsters, OC Weekly\n\n“Size Matters: Feel As Tall As a Giant, As Small As an Ant in Tucson”\n\nBest Religion Story\n\nFirst Place: Gabriel San Román, OC Weekly, “Karen Estremo’s the Dragon and the Rose Is the Hub for OC Pagans”\n\nComments: This was an engaging story. The author avoided the all too easy trap of stereotyping non-mainstream religion and its practitioners and gave us a compelling and meaningful look at these individuals’ lives. It was a well-constructed story and well edited. Very good job!\n\nSecond Place: Deepa Bharath, Orange County Register, “Her brothers were molested by a priest as kids. Now, she’s trying to reconcile with the Catholic Church”\n\nThird Place: Susan Christian Goulding, Orange County Register, “For Christ Cathedral, Heat-Deflecting Quatrefoils Prove to be a Blessing”\n\nDavid McQuay Award for Best Columnist\n\nFirst Place: Norberto Santana Jr., Voice of OC\n\nComments: More than his ability to deliver well-written and well-thought out prose, the reporting Santana does is deep, targeted and human. The issues he tackles are not easy and he lets no one off the hook. It’s what columnists are supposed to do. And great columnists do over and over and over.\n\nSecond Place: Jonathan Lansner, The Orange County Register\n\nBest News Story\n\nFirst Place: Scott Schwebke with Beau Yarbrough, Orange County Register, “Victorville Prison Where Immigrant Detainees Held Built Atop Toxic Superfund Site“\n\nComments: Deeply reported story concerning public health, social justice and government transparency. Includes public document research as well as first-person anecdotal accounts of those affected now living in other parts of the country. An important story speaking for the disenfranchised.\n\nSecond Place: Priscella Vega and Julia Sclafani, Daily Pilot, “Arrests of white power leaders are a reminder of Huntington Beach’s painful past”\n\nThird Place: Spencer Custodio, Voice of OC, “OC Sheriff’s Deputies Begin Evicting Hundreds of Homeless People from Santa Ana River Bank”\n\nBest Investigative Story\n\nFirst Place: Nick Gerda, Voice of OC, “Millions in ‘Dark Money’ Flowing to OC Congressional Races”\n\nComments: The reporter reviewed federal data to build this story — a story that would not have been told if not for his efforts. He then tracked the money to see how it could affect “high-stakes” elections. He also made national comparisons. Campaign finance stories are difficult. In this case, the reporter went to great lengths to collect data and put it into perspective for the reader. He made a story about a complicated money trail intriguing. The graphic was super helpful, too. The reporter, in expert fashion, put into perspective the national impact on a local election. Very well done and deserving of recognition.\n\nSecond Place: Gustavo Arellano, LA Taco, “Priest Accused of Abusing Boys in OC in the 80s Turns Up in Peru”\n\nBest Beat Reporting\n\nFirst Place: Cindy Carcamo, LA Times\n\nComments: Of all of the coverage of what’s going on at our southern border, your reporting more than anyone else’s made me feel like I was there. You write with such detail, with such keen observations. You humanized this issue and helped me connect with it in a new way. My heart ached when I read about the mother who stopped breastfeeding her infant in case they were separated. You being present and in the moment with people, and then reporting back what you saw and heard, was such valuable work.\n\nSecond Place: Deepa Bharath, Orange County Register\n\nThird Place: Hillary Davis, Daily Pilot\n\nHonorable Mention: Theresa Walker, Orange County Register\n\nMarjorie Freeman Award for Best Humorous Story\n\nFirst Place: Brad A. Johnson, Orange County Register, “Worst thing I ate: A crime against barbecue in Irvine”\n\nComments: The clear winner in a very competitive category. So many great lines, but possibly the best was your afterthought that a pickle was a highlight of the meal.\n\nSecond Place: Kedric Francis, OC Family, “Fears of Being a Bad Dad”\n\nThird Place: Anne Marie Panoringan, OC Weekly, “Del Frisco’s Grille’s Updated Brunch Is a John Hughes Movie”\n\nNONTRADITIONAL (ADVOCACY JOURNALISM OR SPECIALTY PUBLICATION)\n\nBest Music/Entertainment Story or Review\n\nFirst Place: Daniella Litvak, The Orange Curtain Revue, “Shrew! At South Coast Repertory”\n\nComments: Daniella’s review was the only entry in this category that seriously critiqued how a production succeeded and could have improved. It was a fair opinion, giving plenty of context for a twist on one of Shakespeare’s most popular plays.\n\nSecond Place: Jessica Peralta, Halloween Every Night, “The 17th Door Is More Traumatic Than Ever – In a Good Way”\n\nBest News Feature Story\n\nFirst Place: Bradley Zint, Behind the Badge, “DUI death in La Habra underscores importance of safe driving”\n\nComments: This powerful, poignant story really stood out amongst the pack because it married both the importance of the police work described and the personal story of a victim of DUI. The article was very well done from start to finish, with many emotional moments and depth. Some details, like the family members coming across the crash scene, gave me chills – a testament to how well written and paced the article was.\n\nSecond Place: Elysse James, Behind the Badge, “Anaheim Police use unconventional methods to clean up problem houses”\n\nThird Place: Greg Hardesty, Behind the Badge, “Mental Health Day is a daily reality for members of Anaheim PD’s PERT”\n\nBest Arts/Culture Story or Review\n\nFirst Place: James Reed, Blue Door Magazine, “Singer Superlative”\n\nComments: Beautiful, crisp, descriptive writing really takes the reader to this property using all five senses. A captivating read up until the end.\n\nSecond Place: Erin Huffstutter, I Heart Costa Mesa, “Gabrielle’s Gift of Play”\n\nThird Place: Shawn Price, Halloween Every Night, “‘Frankenstein’ Turns 200”\n\nBest Feature Story\n\nFirst Place: Erin Huffstutter, I Heart Costa Mesa, “Metal Fab & Etch A Sketch”\n\nComments: A really interesting, well-written story about an influential, creative family. Tackles some complex issues of neighborhood changes while profiling talented people. Only suggestion is to cut to the meat of the story a little more quickly with a lede focused more on the subjects of the article.\n\nSecond Place: Greg Hardesty, Behind the Badge, “An OCSD patrol deputy’s day can go from routine to horror in a flash, as he can attest”\n\nThird Place: Bradley Zint, I Heart Costa Mesa, “Jumping Sheep”\n\nBest News Story\n\nFirst Place: Greg Hardesty, Behind the Badge, “APD targets illegal pot dispensaries, but they keep popping up like mushrooms”\n\nComments: This story stood out for the unique glimpse it offered readers inside a law enforcement investigation, complete with challenges, photographs and interviews with both police officers and people affected by the enforcement action. Really fascinating article.\n\nSecond Place: Greg Hardesty, Behind the Badge, “Armed neighbors detain attempted murder suspect in backyard until OCSD arrives”\n\nThird Place: Jessica Peralta, Behind the Badge, “Westminster PD Narcan instructor first to administer life-saving nasal spray in the field”\n\nBest Food/Restaurant Story or Review\n\nFirst Place: Erin Huffstutter, I Heart Costa Mesa, “The Next Chapter for Church’s”\n\nComments: Erin was able to convey a story about an establishment that is uniquely Costa Mesa, but relatable and identifiable to readers everywhere. Dick Church’s epitomizes the mixing of the “two Costa Mesas,” the blending of the old and the new. A great read.\n\nSecond Place: Elysse James, Behind the Badge, “Chow Time: ‘Slammin’ Salmon’ tacos at Anaheim Fire & Rescue Station 7”\n\nThird Place: Bradley Zint, I Heart Costa Mesa, “Go for the Green”\n\nMULTIMEDIA\n\nBest Blog\n\nFirst Place: Jackie Moe, Backstage SoCal\n\nComments: An interesting and useful blog on this musical topic\n\nBest News Broadcast or Video\n\nFirst Place: Rick Reiff and Scott Hays, “Sheriff’s Battles,” Inside OC With Rick Reiff\n\nBest Feature Broadcast or Video\n\nFirst Place: Rebecca D’Auria, “Close Calls,” Behind the Badge\n\nSecond Place: Rick Reiff and Scott Hays, “Who Are the Homeless?,” Inside OC With Rick Reiff\n\nThird Place: Shawn Price, “Eat, Drink And Celebrate Tim Burton Movies At Beetle House L.A.,” Halloween Every Night\n\nBest Use of Multimedia\n\nFirst Place: Jessica Peralta, “OCSD hosts annual helicopter training exercise for K9s,” Behind the Badge\n\nComments: Great use of video and high-resolution pictures. I also appreciate law enforcement becoming their own storytellers and a positive voice in the community. Plus the highlighted box on the site with their Twitter feed was terrific. Way to stay relevant with clever tweets on current topics and TV shows while not forgetting your mission.\n\nSecond Place: Norberto Santana Jr. and Susan Valot, “On OC: OC Kids on Immigration,” Voice of OC\n\nThird Place: Erin Huffstutter, I Heart Costa Mesa\n\nAward winners for the 2018 annual contest for work produced during 2017.\n\nTRADITIONAL (PRINT)\n\nBest News Story\n\nFIRST PLACE: Roxana Kopetman, Orange County Register\n\n“Same visa Trump uses at his hotel helps bring workers to Southern California fairs”\n\n​SECOND PLACE: Hannah Fry, Daily Pilot\n\n“‘It’s been a night from hell’: Homeless pushed out of Santa Ana River face uncertain futures”\n\nTHIRD PLACE: Nick Gerda, Voice of OC\n\n“Airport controversy heats up as supervisors award contract to low-ranked firm”\n\n​Best News Feature Story\n\nFIRST PLACE: Cindy Carcamo, LA Times\n\n“At Napa vineyards untouched by wildfires, the grapes must still be picked”\n\nSECOND PLACE: Margot Roosevelt, Orange County Register\n\n“Is Social Security cheating the disabled?
