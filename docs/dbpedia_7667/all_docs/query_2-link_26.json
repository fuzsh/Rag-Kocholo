Utilizing collective skills, we guide our designated programs in effectively revitalizing their commercial neighborhood districts. These efforts include building asset-based economic development strategies that achieve measurable results such as investment, business growth and jobs. We operate in accordance with the National Main Street Four Point Approach™ of organization, design, economic vitality and promotion.\n\nVision\n\nOrlando Main Street districts are organizationally sound, economically viable and vibrant centers of commerce that collectively showcase Orlando as a thriving urban city. Our districts inspire community and visitor engagement while creating a unique sense of place and local business prosperity through collaborative partnerships with businesses, stakeholders and residents.\n\nAbout Main Street America\n\nMain Street America™ is a movement. Main Street America has been helping revitalize older and historic commercial districts for more than 35 years. It is the leading voice for preservation-based economic development and community revitalization across the country. Made up of small towns, mid-sized communities, and urban commercial districts, Main Street America represents the broad diversity that makes this country so unique. Working together, the programs that make up the Main Street America network help to breathe new life into the places people call home.\n\nMain Street America is a mark of distinction. It is a seal, recognizing that participating programs, organizations and communities are part of a national movement with a proven track record for celebrating community character, preserving local history and generating impressive economic returns. Since 1980, over 2,000 communities have been part of Main Street America, bringing renewed energy and activity to America’s downtowns and commercial districts, securing $61 billion in new investment creating more than 525,000 net new jobs and rehabilitating 251,000 buildings."
