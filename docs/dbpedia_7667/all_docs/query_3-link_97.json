        "text": "Alfred Lunt was an American actor, particularly known for his professional partnership with his wife Lynn Fontanne (1887-1983). Lunt was one of Broadway's leading male stars.\n\nLunt was born in 1892 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father Alfred D. Lunt was active in the lumber business, while his mother Harriet Washburn Briggs was a housewife. Lunt's ancestry in both Maine and Massachusetts dated back to the colonial era. He was a distant descendant of Henry Lunt, an early settler of Newbury, Massachusetts. Lunt's paternal grandmother was Scottish American. Lunt's maternal ancestors lived in New England since colonial times, and including a number of Mayflower arrivals.\n\nAlfred D. Lunt died in 1893. The widowed Harriet married a Finnish-American physician, Dr. Karl Sederholm. The Sederholms eventually settled in Genesee Depot, Wisconsin, a small unincorporated community in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. Lunt was raised in Genesse Depot, along with three younger half-siblings, He attended Carroll College in nearby Waukesha, Wisconsin.\n\nLunt fist gained publicity in 1919, for his starring role in the comedy play \"Clarence\" by Booth Tarkington (1869-1946). He distinguished himself in a variety of theatrical roles, including in Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and Chekhov's \"The Seagull \". On May 26, 1926, Lunt married actress Lynn Fontane. The two became the preeminent Broadway acting couple. Their successes included a play written specifically for them, the menage a trois-themed \"Design for Living\" (1932) by NoÃ«l Coward.\n\nLunt started acting in films in the 1920s. His film debut was the silent drama \"Backbone\" (1923) for Goldwyn Pictures. Subsequent films included the South Sea romance \"The Ragged Edge\" (1923), the romantic comedy \"Second Youth\" (1924), the circus-themed comedy \"Sally of the Sawdust\" (1925), and the comedy film \"Lovers in Quarantine\" (1925).\n\nLunt's most successful film effort was the comedy film \"The Guardsman\" (1931). In the film, A jealous husband creates a second identity in order to woo his wife, and she plays along. Lunt played the role of the husband, and Lynn Fontane the role of the wife. It was a critical success, but not particularly successful at the box office. Lunt was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role, but the Award was instead won (in a tie) by Wallace Beery and Fredric March.\n\nLunt returned to being mostly a theatrical actor. He had a cameo in the World War II film \"Stage Door Canteen\" (1943), and appeared as himself in the documentary film \"Show Business at War\" (1943). During the 1940s, Lunt and and Fontane starred in several radio dramas. In the 1950s and the 1960s, they appeared frequently on television.\n\nLunt officially retired from the stage in 1958, at the age of 66. His last film appearance was the television film \"The Magnificent Yankee\" (1965), where he played the United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (1841-1935).\n\nLunt spend his last years in retirement at his summer home \"Ten Chimneys\" in in Genesse Depot. He died in August 1977, about a week before his 85th birthday. The cause of death was cancer. Fontane remained in \"Ten Chimneys\" until her own death in 1983. Ten Chimneys was afterwards converted into a house museum, and a resource center for theater.\n\nBuck Owens is a true legend in country music. Along with fellow performers Merle Haggard and Wynn Stewart, Buck helped popularize the Bakersfield Sound, or honky-tonk infused with electric instrumentation and rock influences. Growing up in Arizona, Buck picked cotton and learned to play the mandolin, the guitar and horns. He had his first radio program at age 16 and a year later, worked with the Mac's Skillet Lickers, whose lead singer was Bonnie Campbell. Bonnie soon became the first Mrs. Buck Owens; together, they had a son, Buddy. Buck and his young family moved to Bakersfield, California, in the early 1950s, where he worked as a session guitarist and played for a band called the Orange Blossom Playboys. After a few years of recording rockabilly songs (as \"Corky Jones\"), Buck signed a contract with Capitol Records in 1957. His first recordings floundered, and it wasn't until the spring of 1959 when he hit with \"Second Fiddle.\" That song only reached No. 24 on Billboard magazine's country singles chart, but it was the follow-up, \"Under Your Spell Again\" (which reached No. 4 in the fall of 1959) that Buck's future in country music was assured--and was it ever. After several top-five songs that flirted with the No. 1 spot (among them, \"Above and Beyond,\" \"Under the Influence of Love\" and \"Foolin' Around\"), he finally hit the top of the charts in June 1963 with \"Act Naturally.\" That song's four-week stay at No. 1 paled in comparison, though, to his incredible 16-week stay that fall with \"Love's Gonna Live Here.\" Eighteen more No. 1 hits, all in the Bakersfield tradition, followed during the next nine years. Many of them featured Buck's chief guitarist, right-hand man and close confidant, Don Rich. Together, Owens and Rich (the leader of Buck's backing band, the Buckaroos) polished their sound, which graced AM radio throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Buck parlayed his popularity on two country music TV shows: the syndicated \"Buck Owens Ranch Show\" and CBS' (and later syndicated) Hee Haw (1969). Through it all, he was an astute businessman, keeping control of his publishing rights and master tapes, purchasing several radio stations and forming a booking agency among them. He also recorded a live album in 1969 in London. Then, in 1974, Rich was killed in a motorcycle accident and Buck's life faltered. He recorded for Warner Bros. for a time in the mid- to late-1970s, but only one song, 1979's \"Play Together Again, Again\" (a duet with Emmylou Harris) was a substantial hit. Then, in 1988, he found renewed popularity when new country star Dwight Yoakam (whose own Bakersfield Sound was strongly influenced by Owens) asked him to duet on \"Streets of Bakersfield,\" which soared to No. 1. He still performs occasional shows at his Crystal Palace, and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1996. Buck Owens remains one of country music's most respected (if not underrated) legends.\n\nCamille Billops started as a sculptor and painter, became a filmmaker, and amassed a treasure trove of books, documents, and photographs related to black culture.She was born in Los Angeles in 1933 and studied art at the University of Southern California there and later switched to childhood education, the field in which she got her degree in 1960, at California State University.Her putting up her daughter Christa for adoption two years later, because she did not want to be a mother, became a source of controversy, especially when Billops later made a documentary about their reunion.In this period and into the 197os, with a white scholar of black theater in New York City named James V. Hatch who would become her husband, she presided over a 4,000 square feet artistic loft in the Soho neighborhood of that city which served as a hub for collaborations, a salon for musicians and other performers.A grant from the National Endowment for the Arts allowed her and Hatch to record over 1,200 oral histories about black artists.These interviews and the other material she and her husband collected are now houses at Emory University.Billops died in Manhattan on June 1st of 2019.\n\nCara Jocelyn Delevingne was born in London, England, to Pandora Anne (Stevens) and Charles Hamar Delevingne, a property developer.

With an Academy Award under his belt and a reputation as a powerful leading man, Casey Affleck has established himself as one of the most compelling and versatile actors in contemporary cinema. Throughout his career, he has consistently delivered performances of exceptional depth and nuance in a wide range of film genres.\n\nAffleck's breakout role came in Andrew Dominik's critically acclaimed character drama, \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007). His performance as Robert Ford, a young man consumed by a complex cocktail of admiration and resentment for the notorious outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), earned him widespread recognition, including Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\n\nHe solidified his critical acclaim with a starring role in his brother Ben Affleck's directorial debut, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" (2007). This gripping neo-noir followed two Boston-based private detectives searching for an abducted young girl. Affleck's performance, showcasing both vulnerability and determination, further cemented his reputation as a rising dramatic force.\n\nThe following decade saw Affleck continue to diversify his roles, venturing outside the realm of independent drama to blockbuster productions. He was seen in Christopher Nolan's ambitious sci-fi epic \"Interstellar\" (2014) alongside an ensemble cast including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. Affleck also appeared in Scott Cooper's gritty crime thriller, \"Out of the Furnace\" (2013), where he shared the screen with Christian Bale.\n\nHis versatility continued to shine with his performance in the independent film \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\" (2013), showcasing a quieter, more brooding side to his acting talents. That same year, Affleck turned his attention to production, establishing The Affleck/Middleton Project with John Powers Middleton as a platform to develop and produce a diverse array of film and television projects.\n\nAffleck's directorial work came to fruition with the release of the mockumentary \"I'm Still Here\" (2010), which he directed, wrote, and produced, featuring Joaquin Phoenix in a performance art piece that blurred the lines between fiction and reality. This experimental project demonstrated Affleck's willingness to challenge conventional storytelling formats.\n\nIn 2016, Affleck returned to the spotlight with his career-defining performance in Kenneth Lonergan's profoundly moving drama, \"Manchester by the Sea.\" His portrayal of Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken man coping with immense loss, earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. This raw and unforgettable performance cemented Affleck's status as one of the industry's finest dramatic actors.\n\n2016 also saw Affleck star in several other notable films, including the action thriller \"Triple 9\" (2016) and Disney's historical drama, \"The Finest Hours.\" He further expanded his range with roles in independent films like David Lowery's \"A Ghost Story\" (2017), a meditative exploration of loss and the passage of time.\n\nAffleck has continued to take on challenging projects that have pushed his boundaries as an actor. Most recently, he starred opposite Elisabeth Moss in the psychological thriller \"Light of My Life\" (2019), which he also wrote and directed.\n\nHis upcoming projects include a pivotal role in Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated \"Oppenheimer\" (2023), where he portrays theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer himself. Affleck is also slated to star in \"Slingshot\" (2024), a science fiction thriller set in space.\n\nCasey Affleck's talent for embodying complex, flawed characters with profound authenticity has made him one of the most sought-after actors in the industry. With his captivating performances, dedication to his craft, and his discerning eye for unique storytelling projects, the future remains bright for this remarkable actor.\n\nHis parents Henry C. DeMille and Beatrice DeMille were playwrights. His father died when he was 12, and his mother supported the family by opening a school for girls and a theatrical company. Too young to enlist in the Spanish-American War, Cecil followed his brother William C. de Mille to the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts, making his stage debut in 1900. For twelve years he was actor/manager of his mother's theatrical company. In 1913, Jesse L. Lasky, Samuel Goldwyn and DeMille formed the Lasky Film Company (which years later evolved into Paramount Pictures), and the next year went west to California and produced the successful six reeler, The Squaw Man (1914), of historical significance as the first feature length film produced in Hollywood. He championed the switch from short to feature-length films and is often credited with making Hollywood the motion picture capital of the world. Rather than putting his money into known stars, he emphasized production values. He also developed stars, notably Gloria Swanson. He produced and directed 70 films and was involved in many more. Many of his films were romantic sexual comedies (he is supposed to have believed that Americans were curious only about money and sex). His best-known were biblical/religious epics: Joan the Woman (1916), Die zehn Gebote (1923), KÃ¶nig der KÃ¶nige (1927), Im Zeichen des Kreuzes (1932), Kreuzritter (1935), Samson und Delilah (1949), and Die zehn Gebote (1956). From 1936 to 1945 he hosted and directed the hour-long \"Lux Radio Theatre\", which brought the actors and stories of many movies to the airwaves and further established him as the symbol of Hollywood. He appeared as himself in the classic Boulevard der DÃ¤mmerung (1950) with his former star Gloria Swanson as the fictitious disturbed former silent film actress Norma Desmond. His niece Agnes de Mille was the acclaimed choreographer of both the original Broadway production and film version of Oklahoma (1955).\n\nCharles Mesure was born Wednesday, August 12, 1970, in Somerset, England. When he was five, his family moved to Australia and he grew up in Sydney.\n\nHe studied law at Sydney University and was very active in SUDS, the school's dramatic society. He sang tenor in an a capella group called Cinco. After he graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney in 1995, he moved to New Zealand where he soon got his first TV gig on \"City Life.\" He also acted in plays at the Court and Circa theatres. He won Best Supporting Actor in 2003 for his role as DSS Kees Van Dam on \"Street Legal.\"\n\nIn 2004 he moved to the US and had guest roles on several hit series, notably 12 episodes of \"Crossing Jordan\" (including the landmark 100th episode) and two episodes of \"Without a Trace.\" Both featured him in season-ending cliffhangers.\n\nIn 2008, he returned to New Zealand for major roles in three series. He was nominated Best Actor in the TV Guide \"Best on the Box\" People's Choice Awards for his recurring role in \"Outrageous Fortune.\" His character, Detective Sergeant Zane Gerard, was responsible for the biggest cliffhanger in NZ TV history. The second series, the award-winning family adventure \"Kaitangata Twitch\" with Charles as dad Carey Gallagher, finished its 13-episode run in July 2010. The same month, the complex mystery \"This Is Not My Life\" began 13 episodes with Charles in the lead as Alec Ross, a man who suspects his perfect family and life aren't for real.\n\nCharles returned to the US in 2009 and was cast in \"V\" in the recurring role of mercenary Kyle Hobbes. He was a regular on the second season that ended in March 2011.\n\nIn July 2011, Charles was cast in the role of Ben Faulkner on the eighth and final season of \"Desperate Housewives.\" Ben was Australian, a self-made construction millionaire, a man both charming and ruthless, who moved to Wisteria Lane and was immediately claimed by Renee Perry -- \"Dibs!\" In the last episode of the series, Ben and Renee got married.\n\nIn 2013, Charles traveled to South Africa to play a drunken American playboy in \"Marple: A Caribbean Mystery,\" based on Agatha Christie's book, and to Miami for a final-season episode of \"Burn Notice\" where he was a criminal computer expert.\n\nIn January 2014, Charles filmed an action role in an episode of \"The Mentalist.\" Immediately afterward, he flew to Vancouver to play the role of Blackbeard in \"Once Upon a Time,\" sharing scenes with Colin O'Donoghue's fellow pirate Captain Hook.
