We’re out to top it!\n\nJoin us in kicking off NewsMatch 2018 during two days dedicated to sustaining journalism as a public service and building the revenue that supports your reporting.\n\nKEYNOTE: Kinsey Wilson, President, WordPress\n\nNo tool or technology has been more meaningful in powering the emergence of a new era of independent journalism and lowering the barriers for storytellers and news entrepreneurs than WordPress. Kinsey Wilson became president of the company in March after leading some of the journalism industry’s most significant digital efforts, as head of product and technology and then editor for strategy and innovation at The New York Times, executive vice president and chief content officer at NPR, and executive editor of USA Today.

News Revenue Hub shares tips and strategies on how to build those one-time donors into sustaining donors or members, whose monthly support for your news organizations can help ensure a steady source of revenue.\n\nPresenter: Mary Walter Brown, News Revenue Hub\n\nThe Four Ps of Sponsorships\n\nPrice, package, promote and place sponsorships to create the most value for your news organization and your sponsors.\n\nNonprofit newsrooms see growing sponsorship interest from small businesses, community groups and other nonprofits — and NewsMatch 2018 will match some small business donations as well as individual gifts. Whether you’ve created a news product, event or sponsorship opportunity, learn how to sell it. What is the competitive advantage that your organization, product or event offers to a sponsor and what are the best ways to get advertisers and sponsors to see the value? Ebony Reed, director of the Futures Lab at the Reynolds Journalism Institute and an Associate Professor at the Missouri School of Journalism, will lead this session. Reed has sold advertising, media products and worked as a journalist. She will detail how to figure out market value for products, events and other underwriting opportunities, and how to sell them in a hands-on, interactive 60-minute session.

Even if you don’t have a formal major gifts program yet, major gift opportunities can emerge out of smaller individual fundraising. Understand how to act on that, or take this opportunity to refresh your skills.\n\nPresenter: Diane Remin, MajorDonors.com\n\nBREAKOUT: Build an AR App\n\nAugmented Reality is here. Soon our websites, mobile devices and even glassware will have AR options. As a news industry we need to stay current with the options, and as news leaders, we need to be familiar with the technology as it grows. Kat Duncan, Senior Video Editor at the Reynolds Journalism Institute Futures Lab, will lead this session on how to build an AR experience to use in events, which many nonprofit newsrooms are offering to build audience, engagement and fundraising. The session provides a strong use case and a broader sense of how your site can use AR to build interactive content for readers and to broaden revenue opportunities. Before this 90-minute session, participants should sign up for a free trial subscription of Zap Works. Sign up at zap.works a few days prior to INN Days.\n\nPresenter: Kat Duncan, Futures Lab, Reynolds Journalism Institute\n\nINN Days Reception, 5:30 to 7:30 p.m.\n\nThursday, June 14\n\nBuilding the Business Skills that Build News\n\nINN Index: The state of nonprofit news\n\nYou’ve shared your data, and the headlines are in.

The documentary takes viewers to Montana — a frontline in the fight to preserve fair elections nationwide — to follow intrepid local journalist and INN Member John Adams, of Montana Free Press, working to expose the real-life impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. FEC decision and the way American elections are bought and sold. This Sundance award-winning documentary is directed and produced by Kimberly Reed, presenting the film with Adams and two other INN members featured in the documentary. From a journalist’s view, this film is notable in presenting strong voices from both right and left testifying to the impact of journalism. This is a film that is as important to advocates for news as it is to political finance reform. Join the director and our star members right after the screening in an invigorating discussion of the impact of Dark Money for all of us.\n\nPresenters: John Adams, Montana Free Press; Sheila Krumholz, Center for Responsive Politics and Edwin Bender, FollowTheMoney.org\n\nBREAKOUT: Community Engagement Powerhouses\n\nEngagement is part of audience building.

Fundraising partnerships. Exploring a merger. Licensing that new software, hiring the reporter you really want. Saving money on your newsroom rent. Recruiting a new board member. Almost every success you celebrate as a nonprofit news leader draws on a skill set that is rarely taught in J-school: negotiating. From creating the most beneficial and positive partnerships to resolving contentious issues, we’ll help you quickly build four fundamental skills and tactics that help you reach better outcomes with less stress.\n\nPresenters: Fran Scarlett and Sue Cross\n\nBREAKOUT: R-E-S-P-E-C-T: Power Dynamics and Workplace Success Strategies\n\nWell before #MeToo was a hashtag, INN was hearing from women in member organizations asking for tips to use their voices more effectively. Participants at any career stage will come out of this session with a renewed sense of how to navigate the #MeToo aftermath and strategies they can carry back and use throughout the year to be heard and use their authority effectively. This 90-minute session is geared to women but illuminating and welcoming to all. We’ll talk about challenges including:\n\nMessage dilution by apologizing, framing one’s message in a diminishing way, overusing polite tone and language.\n\nAvoiding confrontation and often taking on others’ responsibilities as a result.\n\nLack of awareness of physical presence and non-verbal communication which can result in projecting a lack of confidence and authority.\n\nSkill-building to teach strategies for overcoming these challenges.\n\nParticipants will create a Powerful Communication Roadmap customized to their own experience. This roadmap will serve as a guide back at the workplace.\n\nPresenter: Madhu Krishnappa Maron, Madhucoach\n\nINN Days 2018: Power Dynamics and Workplace Success Strategies from Institute for Nonprofit News\n\nBREAKOUT: Peer Group Meetups\n\nAs the INN network continues to grow, members have turned to peer groups to share ideas with similar organizations or job title holders. This will be a time at INN Days to gather any new or established small groups to brainstorm, share ideas, or vent in person.\n\nPeer groups: rural newsrooms, tribal affairs, development directors.
