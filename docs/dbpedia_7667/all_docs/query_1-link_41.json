The need is great here in this news desert. West is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. She is a mother and grandmother and is passionate about always telling truth to power and then hoping for the best.\n\nMarcia Parker\n\nPublisher, CALmatters\n\nBefore joining CALmatters more than a year ago as Publisher and Chief Operating Officer, Marcia Parker was Executive Director for Content for Penton Technology, overseeing a dozen tech news sites for business professionals and a thriving content marketing studio.

As publisher, Santana oversees all newsroom, engagement and fundraising operations and also writes a weekly Opinion column about Orange County government. In 2017, the Orange County Press Club recognized Santana as Orange County’s best columnist.\n\nBefore founding Voice of OC in 2009, Santana was a lead investigative reporter for the Orange County Register from 2004-2009, focusing on county government. He’s spent nearly two decades just focusing on local governments across Southern California, previously as a staff writer with outlets such as the San Diego Union Tribune and the San Bernardino County Sun.\n\nSantana began his journalistic career in the early 1990s as an apprentice reporter with Congressional Quarterly in Washington, D.C. covering daily floor action in the U.S. Congress and followed that up with a stint covering the territorial Senate for the U.S. Virgin Islands Daily News. In addition to his experience as a journalist, the Southern California native has a master’s in Latin American Studies, has worked as an elections analyst on National Endowment for Democracy programs across Latin America and was one of the founders of CubaNet.org, a website featuring the work of dissident journalists inside Cuba that has operated since 1995.\n\nAbout INN:\n\nThe Institute for Nonprofit News is a growing national network of more than 160 nonprofit news organizations dedicated to providing investigative and public service reporting.
