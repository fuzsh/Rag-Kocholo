        "text": "City budget talks kick off with modest increase in spending proposed\n\nCity budget talks kick off with modest increase in spending proposed\n\nCommissioners will be called on to set priorities in coming weeks\n\nJuly 12, 2024\n\nBy Beth Kassab\n\nResidents got a first glimpse at next year’s city budget — a $214.6 million proposal with a 3% or $6 million increase over the current year as property taxes remain a key driver of growth in the general fund.\n\nThe plan calls for the city to maintain the same property tax rate its held for 16 years, though residents will see additional fee increases for trash pick-up as a result of a contract negotiated last year and there are signals pointing to more fee increases for other services ahead.\n\nPublic safety remains the biggest expenditure in the general fund, rising from about 35% in 2024 to more than 42% in the new budget. The increase comes with four new proposed positions, including two new firefighters/emergency medical technicians, a fire logistics manager and a police grant and accreditation manager that will be upgraded from a part-time to a full-time position.\n\nWhile inflation continues to put pressure on wages and building costs, the city’s general fund will see almost 7% growth to nearly $83 million as a result of increases in home values, fees for services and Winter Park’s share of the state sales tax. Other funds are flat or seeing declines.\n\nThe water utility, for example, is expected to see declining cash flow as inflation pushes up the costs to maintain the system, according to the budget presentation. The water rates customers pay are driven by the state’s regulatory agency called the Public Service Commission, but the index for regular increases are “are likely insufficient to handle future demand for investment,” the presentation said.\n\nIn addition, the city-owned electric utility will “likely need to consider a rate increase” next year due to higher costs within the power portfolio.\n\nAlso at play is the future of the city’s Community Redevelopment Agency, which uses a portion of county tax dollars to fund projects in a special district that covers downtown. The city is looking to the county to extend the CRA (which otherwise would sunset in four years) and expand its borders, but the Orange County Commission has yet to take up the matter.\n\nOverall, there are about $126 million worth of projects in the city’s 25-year plan that don’t currently have a funding source attached to them. That means commissioners will need to continue to set priorities and make choices about how to manage the competing interests that come from wanting to maintain relatively low property taxes and fees for residents with improving services, infrastructure and amenities.\n\nThe proposed budget set aside a contingency of about $450,000, roughly the same as last year. The city’s reserves are expected to grow to about $21.2 million or about 27% of the recurring annual operating costs in the general fund, the proposal says. It would take about $2.7 million more to reach the goal of 30%.\n\nWinterParkVoiceEditor@gmail.com\n\nTo comment or read comments from others, click here →\n\nMedical office approved on corner of Aloma and Lakemont\n\nMedical office approved on corner of Aloma and Lakemont\n\nThe project led by a group of physicians will bring development to the long vacant lot\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nBy Beth Kassab\n\nA new medical office building will stand at the empty corner at Lakemont and Aloma avenues after the City Commission unanimously approved the project with conditions late last month.\n\nResidents objected to the height of the building and raised questions about traffic, particularly left-hand turns, but commissioners settled on conditions that they said would alleviate many of the concerns.\n\nThe nearly 18,000-square-foot proposal for the two-story building came after Verax Investments purchased the land from Fifth Third Bank earlier this year for about $2.7 million, according to property records. Verax is a real estate development group led by a group of local physicians including Dr. Ravi Gandhi, a well-known brain surgeon with Orlando Neurosurgery.\n\nThe development will herald a major change for the last wooded parcel of the intersection.\n\n“We all know that SR 426 is broken,” said resident Beth Hall. “Please don’t let this be the commission that breaks Lakemont.”\n\nThe developers agreed to preserve two live oak trees on the property.\n\nThey also agreed to build a 6-foot high wall on the edge of the property that backs up to residential lawns and the wall must be constructed before the building is started.\n\nAmong other conditions, the developers will also post signs prohibiting left-hand turns out of the property and give over a strip of the land to the city to eventually widen Lakemont. .\n\nWinterParkVoiceEditor@gmail.com\n\nTo comment or read comments from others, click here →\n\nWhat’s on the Aug. 20 ballot in Winter Park?\n\nWhat's on the Aug. 20 ballot in Winter Park?\n\nThere’s big focus on November because of the presidential election, but August is key for local races\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\nBy Beth Kassab\n\nWith so much attention already on November because of the presidential contest, it’s important for Winter Park voters to know Aug. 20 is just as crucial of an Election Day when it comes to deciding how your local tax dollars are spent or how our schools and our elections are run.\n\nThe way the August primary works in Florida can be something of a mystery even for those of us who have lived here for a while. A series of state and local rules determine whether races are decided in August or November based on whether the races are partisan and how many candidates are running.\n\nHere’s a preview of what to expect on the Winter Park ballot and keep following the Voice for more coverage of these Orange County races:\n\nYou are likely already hearing about (and being asked for money) for the most competitive races heading into August.\n\nThey are:\n\nOrange County Commission District 5: This is a technically non-partisan seat that is open because current Commissioner Emily Bonilla, who represents Winter Park, has reached her term limits. The candidates are: Former Maitland City Council member and former legislator Joy Goff-Marcil; former Winter Park Mayor Steve Leary; attorney Joel Antonio Montilla and Kelly Semrad, a UCF associate professor of tourism economics. If none of the four candidates receives 50% plus one of the vote in August, then the top two vote getters will face off in November.\n\nSupervisor of Elections: Glen Gilzean, who was appointed to the post earlier this year by Gov. Ron DeSantis after longtime Supervisor Bill Cowles left the job early, decided not to run. Vying for the now open partisan seat as registered Democrats are current School Board member Karen Castor Dentel, former Orange County Democratic chairman Wes Hodge, attorney Dan Helm and “Sunshine” Linda-Marie Grund, a real estate broker. Cynthia Harris, a non-profit executive who has also served as chairwoman of Valencia College Black Advisory Committee, according to her LinkedIn profile, qualified as a candidate without a party affiliation. Because there is an NPA candidate in the race, only registered Democrats can vote in August on the Democratic candidates. Then the winner will face Harris in November.\n\nTax Collector: Scott Randolph, the incumbent, and David Nelson Freeman qualified as Democrats for the partisan seat. Dennis Spencer Levy also qualified as a write-in candidate. Once again, because there is a write-in candidate, the August primary will be only for — and likely decided by — registered Democrats. The winner will appear on the November ballot with the write-in candidate.\n\nSchool Board District 6: This seat, which represents Winter Park, is open because Castor Dentel is leaving to run for Supervisor of Elections. The candidates are Jeni Grieger, a former teacher, and Stephanie Vanos, an education advocate. Because this is a nonpartisan race and there are only two candidates, it will be open to all voters and will be decided in August.\n\nProperty Appraiser: Amy Mercado, the incumbent, and Kevin Pribell are the only candidates in the race and both are Democrats. As a result, the ballot will be open to all voters and decided in August.\n\nState Attorney: Andrew Bain was appointed by DeSantis after the governor suspended Monique Worrell from office. Bain is running as an NPA and Worrell is running as a Democrat. In November, they will face whoever wins the August closed Republican primary. The Republican candidates are Thomas Feiter and Seth Hyman.\n\nPublic Defender: Bob Wesley is retiring from this post after 24 years, leaving the seat open. Melissa Vickers, a 21-year veteran of the office and former chief assistant, and Lenora Easter, also a former public defender in the district, are both running as Democrats. As a result the race is open to all voters and will be decided in August.\n\nAutomatically elected because of no opposition:\n\nClerk of Courts: Tiffany Moore Russell, the incumbent, is the only candidate who qualified and is automatically elected.\n\nComptroller: Phil Diamond, the incumbent, is the only candidate who qualified and is automatically elected.\n\nSheriff: John Mina, the incumbent, is the only candidate who qualified and is automatically elected. This is the first time an incumbent sheriff ran unopposed in Orange County since 2000.\n\nWinterParkVoiceEditor@gmail.com\n\nTo comment or read comments from others, click here →\n\nBlue Bamboo and city hammer out lease for old library building\n\nBlue Bamboo and city hammer out lease for old library building\n\nAfter what was, at times, a contentious discussion, the city took another step toward a new path for the old library\n\nJune 27, 2024\n\nBy Zoey Thomas\n\nThe Winter Park City Commission unanimously approved Blue Bamboo Center for the Arts’ lease agreement for the old library building after two hours of negotiations at a meeting Wednesday evening.\n\nEarlier this month, the Commission turned down a higher dollar proposal from Rollins College in a 4-1 vote to allow Blue Bamboo to take over the building. Mayor Sheila DeCiccio was the lone vote against the project then, but she voted to approve the lease this week.\n\nBlue Bamboo, a local nonprofit live music venue, plans to turn the building into a multicultural arts center by renting out rooms to other nonprofits — including Central Florida Vocal Arts and the Winter Park Chamber Music Academy. It drafted its proposed lease to the Commission with input from City Manager Randy Knight.\n\nDeCiccio presented several changes to the proposed lease, all of which she called “essential to protect the residents of Winter Park.” The mayor voiced concerns about the venue’s financial prospects throughout the meeting.\n\n“We’re dealing with a lessor who doesn’t have a proven financial record behind them,” she said. “If we’re going to take this leap of faith, we need to have some protections in there.”\n\nThe old library building will require at least $175,000 in renovations to bring it up to code, according to an inspection report presented by Vice Mayor Todd Weaver earlier this month. Blue Bamboo’s managing director, Chris Cortez, has said he has access to up to $800,000 for first-floor renovations alone in the three-story building.\n\nDeCiccio suggested requiring Blue Bamboo to provide evidence of available cash in the bank or a preapproved loan before beginning renovations on the building. Such documentation, which could include bank statements or a loan approval letter, would have to be submitted within one year.\n\nWeaver opposed the requirement, calling Blue Bamboo’s bank statements “none of our business.” Winter Park has no such terms for other nonprofits that rent city property, including historic home museum Casa Feliz or the Winter Park Library, he said.\n\nDeCiccio urged commissioners not to compare Blue Bamboo’s “unique position” to the city’s other leased properties. She was eventually outnumbered by her fellow commissioners, who agreed with Weaver that evidence of financial viability was both hard to define and unreasonable to demand.\n\n“Why are we looking so hard at finding ways to terminate the lease or get them out of the lease?” said Commissioner Craig Russell. “Do we want to go back to paying all the bills to have an empty building?”\n\nDuring public comment after the Commission’s discussion, however, Blue Bamboo Director Cortez said he had no problem proving viability by going through the building with a contractor, getting a bid and showing funds to the city.\n\n“I could’ve saved us a lot of time, but I was told to be quiet, so I let you guys sit there and work through that mess,” he said. “But it really isn’t necessary, because we think it’s very reasonable.”\n\nOther adjustments went more smoothly. While the original lease specified Blue Bamboo be given five year’s notice in the event of an eviction, and DeCiccio suggested a one-year notice, the commission compromised on two.\n\nAnother conversation, over the lease’s parking clause, lasted for several minutes until commissioners eventually agreed the lease’s language on the subject didn’t need changing — other than striking one line that repeated guidelines already listed in the city parking code.\n\nMark Horn, a musician living in Tavares, was one of 12 Blue Bamboo supporters who spoke during public comment. As a Seattle native who has visited jazz clubs across the country, Horn hopes the city recognizes how special Blue Bamboo is, he said.\n\n“We’re here talking about permitting Blue Bamboo to exist, and I hope very soon that convo shifts to, ‘How can we promote Blue Bamboo?’” he said.\n\nBlue Bamboo said the slight adjustments made to the proposed lease will not affect its business moving forward in a Facebook post following the meeting. It previously criticized the lease proposed by DeCiccio, which it said would sour the deal and only benefit the city.\n\nCommissioners are expected to vote for final approval July 12.\n\nWinterParkVoiceEditor@gmail.com\n\nTo comment or read comments from others, click here →\n\nCommissioners approve Storyville Coffee and more Christmas lights, but reject canal murals\n\nCommissioners approve Storyville Coffee and more Christmas lights, but reject canal murals\n\nThe board also decided to hire a town architect\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\nBy Beth Kassab\n\nCity Commissioners approved plans for a new building known as the Storyville Coffee project and doubled the public budget for Christmas lights, but rejected a proposal to paint murals to the canal bridges that connect the city’s famous chain of lakes.\n\nThe Storyville Coffee project from Full Sail founder Jon Phelps won unanimous approval by the board after a redo of its design to blend more closely with the surrounding Central Business District. The building on South Knowles Avenue will top 11,000 square feet and contain offices and a residence on the second and third floors.\n\nChristmas lights\n\nCommissioners this week also welcomed plans by the Park Avenue District to expand the city’s Christmas display, pledging another $50,000 from the general fund and what will likely be an additional $50,000 from the Community Redevelopment Agency Fund. The portion from the CRA board won’t be finalized until a later meeting of that board.\n\nThe new expenditures will come on top of the $96,000 already in the city budget for holiday decor.\n\nThe nearly $200,000 total commitment doubles the city’s expenditure on Christmas decorations and the newest portion will be provided as a match of up to $100,000 raised privately by the district.\n\nThe idea is for the display at Central Park and Park Avenue along with Hannibal Square and Morse Boulevard to be more immersive and attract more visitors to shop and dine in the area. A sample mood board for the additions includes lots more lights, magnolia flowers and oranges and immersive light experiences such as archways.\n\nCanal Murals\n\nCommissioners gave a thumbs down to an idea from the Public Art Advisory Board to commission artists to paint murals under the canal bridges that connect the Chain of Lakes.\n\nThe canals pose too harsh an environment for art, several commissioners said.\n\n“I love murals, but they have to be put in the right place,” Weaver said. “This is kind of a nasty environment for fine artwork.”\n\nCommissioner Craig Russell said he loved the idea and made a motion to pursue the murals, but it failed for lack of a second from another commissioner.\n\nTown Architect\n\nWinter Park will hire a town architect, likely as a contracted role to be called on as needed.\n\nFormer Mayor Phil Anderson, who just left his post in April, attended the meeting to support the idea.\n\n“I think it’s probably time for winter park to join Charleston or Carmel who have an expert available,” Anderson said.\n\nThe discussion of creating the new position comes as Mayor Sheila DeCiccio is finalizing a board to set design guidelines for the key business districts along Park, Orange and Fairbanks avenues. She noted the number of large projects coming up for approval and the need for additional eyes to help\n\nRussell expressed skepticism about the need for the role.\n\n“What are the unintended consequences of adding another chef to the kitchen?” he asked.\n\nCommissioner Kris Cruzada said he supported the idea in an effort to maintain the aesthetic of the city.\n\n“There’s a look and feel and we may need to have someone on board to protect that look and feel going forward,” he said.\n\nWinterParkVoiceEditor@gmail.com\n\nTo comment or read comments from others, click here →\n\nRollins makes pitch to turn old library into art museum\n\nRollins makes pitch to turn old library into art museum\n\nThe college wants to add 5,000 square feet to the building rather than pursue earlier plans for new construction\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\nBy Beth Kassab\n\nOfficials from Rollins College along with developer and philanthropist Alan Ginsburg made a pitch on Thursday to take over the old city library building and turn it into the college’s art museum complete with an auditorium, educational space and a 5,000-square-foot addition.\n\nThe conversation took place Thursday at a work session among city commissioners, who have tried for years to find a suitable use for the old brick building, including two failed requests for proposals.\n\nRollins President Grant Cornwell, who announced his retirement earlier this year, said the college was willing to shelve more expensive plans for new construction, the latest version of which were approved by the commission last year.\n\nCornwell said encouragement from Mayor Sheila DeCiccio and Ginsburg as well as a fundraising shortfall toward the $30 million for the new construction all weighed into the college’s decision to consider the old building.\n\n“The first reason we’re here is because the mayor asked us,” he said. “… If this all came together and we could repurpose the building, that’s something we have to take seriously.”\n\nHe said donors have committed about $18 million to the project, which may cover the cost of renovating the old library and would allow a new museum to open much sooner than if the college pursued all new construction.\n\nGinsburg, a former Rollins trustee who has helped the college develop several projects, called himself a “pro bono developer” on the proposal and pushed for the change in plans after he was approached to help finish fundraising for the more expensive version of the project.\n\nCity commissioners appeared largely open to the idea and agreed to allow City Manager Randy Knight to begin negotiations with Rollins, which would prefer to buy the land from the city, along with several other groups that have recently expressed interest in the building.\n\nThe concept will appear for more formal discussion at the next City Commission meeting in June.\n\nThe Blue Bamboo Center for the Arts, a nonprofit music venue, recently lost its lease in Winter Park and also expressed interest in repurposing the old library into a music venue and teaching space. Jeff Flowers, a former Maitland city commissioner and chairman of the Blue Bamboo’s board, also gave a short presentation at the work session.\n\nCommissioner Todd Weaver said the Orlando Opera as well as another group has also expressed interest in the building since the last request for proposal from the city yielded just one response.\n\nWinterParkVoiceEditor@gmail.com\n\nTo comment or read comments from others, click here →"
