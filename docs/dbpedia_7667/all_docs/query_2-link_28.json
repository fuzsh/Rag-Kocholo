        "text": "Orange County Needs You!\n\nDear Community Member -\n\nThe OC Health Care Agency’s (HCA) has published the Orange County Community Health Improvement Plan (OC CHIP) Plan update for 2024-26. The OC CHIP is a vital initiative designed to address the health needs and concerns of our community. It serves as a roadmap for improving health outcomes and promoting health equity for all residents. This plan was informed by population and neighborhood level data, which illustrated the disparities in health outcomes and disease burdens that exist by geography, race/ethnicity, gender, immigration status, sexual orientation, age, and ability.\n\nThe community’s input was crucial in shaping this plan to reflect the diverse needs and priorities of Orange County. HCA used a comprehensive stakeholder process to develop the OC CHIP. We worked together with our community-based partners to form shared goals and strategies that reflect, honor, and uplift the voices of our historically marginalized communities. We are grateful to the community members who participated during this process, sharing their lived experience and ideas so that we can continue to improve the public’s health. Central to the development and implementation of all programs was the focus on community collaboration, cultural competence, and consumer- and family-driven services. Serving the unserved and underserved is a focus, in addition to wellness, recovery, and resilience.\n\nPlease click on image to see the full report” The report will be also available in other languages soon.”\n\nAs a valued member of our community, we want to bring to your attention two important opportunities to make a significant impact on the health and well-being of Orange County: The Orange County Community Health Improvement Plan (OC CHIP) is recruiting community members and organizations to serve on the six priority area implementation workgroups and also to serve on the OC CHIP Steering Committee.\n\nThe following two links will take you to surveys through which you can voice your interest in joining us as we launch the implementation phase of the OC CHIP.\n\nWorkgroup Membership Interest Survey\n\nhttps://ochca.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8vTIoPXkzYnmlNA\n\nSteering Committee Membership Interest Survey\n\nhttps://ochca.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_abIxGALCOOaE8nk"
