        "text": "Top Lobbyist For Controversial Anaheim Hills Housing Development Has Deep Ties to Aitken Family\n\nTom Daly with Mayor Ashleigh Aitken and his wife Debbie at the State of the City Address on June 6, 2024.\n\nBy DUANE J. ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nTom Daly, a lobbyist retained by SALT Development, a Utah-based real estate firm that is planning to build 498 luxury apartments, single-family estates, and commercial space on ecologically-sensitive land in Anaheim Hills, has deep ties to the family of Mayor Ashleigh Aitken.\n\nBesides the fact Daly has been an advisor to the mayor, campaign finance records reviewed by The Anaheim Investigator show he was a member of the Democratic Foundation of Orange County, the political machine Wylie Aitken, her father, used to wield his influence over local politics.\n\nDaly’s relationship with the Aitkens goes back to the mid-1990s. It was Wylie who told the OC Weekly that he first met Loretta Sanchez through him. Yet not much is known about his links to the Democratic Foundation then because some public records of that era no longer exist.\n\nBut Form 460s that were later filed with the California Secretary of State reveal that the former state assemblyman pumped $15,050 into the Democratic Foundation from 2014 to 2018, even paying their $1,100 annual membership dues. He also gave them $4,000 in 2002.\n\nFrom the Secretary of State.\n\nAdditionally, other records disclose that Wylie himself wrote out big checks to help Daly in his bids for public office. Between the years of 2012 and 2017, he contributed about $6,500 to his state assembly campaigns, usually in dollar amounts ranging from $1,000 to $2,500.\n\nThough the elder Aitken “retired” as chairman of the Democratic Foundation in 2009, he still maintained a tight grip on the group through close allies like Dan Jacobson, a Tustin-based attorney, and Michael Penn, his son-in-law, who has been married to Ashleigh since 2002.\n\nNumerous photographs in the possession of The Investigator make it clear Daly was a featured guest at events sponsored by the Democratic Foundation. At one, he can be seen seated at a table not far from Penn. Across from them is Carrie Nocella, an executive with the Disneyland Resort.\n\nMayor Aitken isn’t the only person on the city council whom Daly has ties with. For example, he backed Councilman Stephen Faessel when he first ran for his seat. And Mayor Pro Tem Norma Campos-Kurtz’s resume states she was his district director for seven years when he served in the legislature.\n\nWylie Aitken with Daly in 2017.\n\nDaly also isn’t the only lobbyist for SALT Development. Peter Mitchell first began representing this firm in 2019. However, in paperwork filed with the city clerk since that time, not only does he continue to report them as being a “potential client,” but insists they never pay him for his services.\n\nMitchell is no stranger to the political arena. He is a consultant for several law enforcement unions, including the Anaheim Police Association. Perhaps it should be noted that the latter spent $92,556 to help Mayor Aitken get elected in 2022, according to campaign finance records.\n\nFurthermore, data from the Secretary of State shows the California Statewide Law Enforcement Association, which has 7,000 members, made a $2,500 contribution to the “Daly for Insurance Commissoner 2026” committee last year. Their website lists Mitchell as a consultant.\n\nThe Dalys with Berenice Ballinas, the Mayor’s Chief of Staff, and Peter Mitchell.\n\nSALT Development’s proposal for their 76-acre site in Anaheim Hills has been met with fierce opposition. Residents argue it will increase traffic, pose a serious fire risk, and have a harmful impact on wildlife. They further claim it will “change the character of neighborhoods” surrounding it.\n\nIn response, the firm says that only half of the land will be developed, the rest being kept as open space. Potential fire risks will be mitigated by adding a dozen hydrants and removing excess vegetation. Moreover, public access to the nearby Deer Canyon Park Preserve will be improved.\n\nFor the record, The Investigator emailed questions to both Daly and Mitchell. With respect to the latter, we wondered why he has spent the past five years working for SALT Development for free and asked if he ever expects to be compensated. So far Mitchell has ignored us.\n\nBut Daly, to his credit, did send us a reply. Responding to a question we posed about whether or not his pre-existing relationships with Mayor Aitken, her family, and other council members might have played a role in the firm’s decision to hire him, he wrote as follows:\n\nI was hired to join this project team, which will bring first-class housing and many community benefits, because I am deeply knowledgeable of Anaheim’s planning history as well as our current planning priorities. And I’m certainly aware of our pressing housing needs.\n\nAs an Anaheim native, I represented the community as an elected official for thirty-seven years. Fourteen of those were at our City Hall, where I participated in many complicated public hearings on housing proposals.\n\nI know literally thousands of residents, including the entire city council and city staff.\n\nHidden in Plain Sight: Controversial Disney Executive Sits on Chapman U Board Chaired by Mayor’s Husband\n\nMichael Penn and his wife Mayor Ashleigh Aitken celebrating his appointment as chair of Chapman University’s Board of Governors in February 2023.\n\nBy DUANE J. ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nLast September, Noah Biesada and Spencer Custodio, two reporters for the Voice of OC, came very close, albeit indirectly, to exposing the Aitken family’s curious relationship with Carrie Nocella, the director of External Affairs for the Disneyland Resort. In an article entitled, “Will Mickey Mouse Continue to Cast a Big Shadow Over Anaheim’s Election Campaigns?,” they wrote about the controversial Disney executive at length.\n\nBut in their story, they included what on the surface looks like a seemingly mundane fact about Nocella: “She currently teaches a class at Chapman University titled ‘Legislative Advocacy & Lobbying,’ according to her LinkedIn page.” Perhaps they felt Nocella’s latest teaching gig was inconsequential, so they never followed up on it. However, that tidbit of information contained a valuable lead: Chapman University.\n\nHad Biesada and Custodio run with the ball, they would have discovered Nocella serves on that university’s Board of Governors, a body that guides the educational mission of the school. Its current chair is Michael Penn, the husband of Mayor Ashleigh Aitken. And with a little more digging, they would have learned that she was appointed to it in 2018 while Wylie Aitken, the mayor’s father, was chair of the Board of Trustees.\n\nNames highlighted from a PDF file posted on the university’s website.\n\nIn our previous article, The Anaheim Investigator revealed that between 1991 and 1993, both Mayor Aitken and Nocella attended Rosary Academy, a small, elite Roman Catholic all-girls college-prep school located in Fullerton. Moreover, we also reported that the mayor, for whatever reason, inexplicably purged all messages which made reference to Nocella’s name from her personal Facebook account early in 2023.\n\nUpon graduating with a diploma in 1995, Nocella went to Chapman University on a vocal talent scholarship where she pursued a bachelor’s degree in legal studies, with a minor in political science. While there, she got elected president of their student government after being encouraged to run by her father, who did the same during his college days. “It was really cool following in Dad’s footsteps,” she told the Orange County Register.\n\nBetween 1997 and 1998, Nocella was an intern with the Campaign to Re-Elect Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, where she did “campaign strategy, labor outreach and strategy, fundraising, and event planning.” Besides the fact Sanchez was Chapman University alumna, her biggest benefactor was Wylie Aitken, a wealthy tort lawyer, who nurtured her rise to power with money, legal assistance, and political support.\n\nWylie Aitken and Sanchez in 2010.\n\nAfter completing her studies at Chapman University, Nocella packed up her bags and headed to Northern California to attend the McGeorge School of Law, which is located on the Sacramento campus of the University of the Pacific. She earned a juris doctor degree from them in 2002 and, upon passing the state bar exam, became an attorney, working at a wide variety of different positions in both the public and private sector.\n\nIn 2007, Nocella returned to Orange County and took up a government relations job with the Disneyland Resort. She later worked alongside Matthew Hicks, the son-in-law of Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Daly and his former district director. Hicks would eventually jump ship and be hired by Henry Samueli, a Newport Beach billionaire who owns the Anaheim Ducks. He is currently vice-president of Public Affairs for ocV!BE.\n\nFor a two-year period, Nocella was also an adjunct professor at the Chapman University School of Law, teaching a course in legislative advocacy. “The class was amazing,” said Kyndell Gaglio, a former student of hers who is now an attorney. “We had a slew of guest speakers–heavy hitters from the community such as State Senator Lou Correa, Anaheim Mayor Curt Pringle and Orange County Supervisor Bill Campbell.”\n\nNocella and Sanchez in 2015.\n\nNo story about this matter is complete without addressing the influence that Wylie Aitken and his wife, Bette, wielded over Chapman University. For more than two decades, not only was this couple among their biggest donors, showering them with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, but they were a catalyst in bringing about major changes to its law school, helping transform it into a world-class institution.\n\nIn a Facebook message that Aitken Aitken & Cohn, his law firm, posted in 2020, they reported he was “a key figure in supporting the founding of Chapman University Fowler School of Law and the Wylie Aitken Trial Courtroom, which is a state-of-the-art national courtroom.” They also added both he and his wife helped establish the Bette and Wylie Aitken Family Protection Clinic and Center for Lawyering and Advocacy Skills.\n\nBut Aitken’s involvement with the university wasn’t just limited to philanthropy. In 2004, he became a member of their Board of Trustees; twelve years later, he was made chair. Now at the zenith of his power, the lawyer was now in a position to make critical decisions about things other than management of the school’s finances–such as recommend or approve who gets appointed to other boards and committees.\n\nFrom the Facebook page of Aitken Aitken & Cohn.\n\nIn October 2018, Nocella was installed on the university’s Board of Governors, a body which guides the educational mission of the school. Bylaws then stated only the Board of Trustees can approve this appointment. Because meeting minutes are kept secret, it is not known who supported the Disney executive. However, the politician she had done an internship for had been a trustee since 2001: Sanchez. And Wylie was now chair.\n\nMichael Penn, who married Ashleigh Aitken in 2002 and began working at her father’s law firm soon thereafter, was already executive vice-chair of the Board of Governors when Nocella joined. Penn, who was appointed to it in 2014, graduated from the Chapman University School of Law with a juris doctor degree in 2004. After serving eight years (of which four were with Nocella), Penn finally became chair in February 2023.\n\nUnlike some board members, Nocella has attained rare celebrity status at the university. Not only has her work for the Disneyland Resort been viewed positively, but she has even been featured in videos used to communicate with the student body. Furthermore, Dr. Daniele Struppa, the school’s president, poses in photos with her at their annual event which lauds The Walt Disney Company for being a top employer of alumni.\n\nStruppa and Nocella in 2023.\n\nFor matter of record, The Investigator did email questions about Nocella to three key people named in this article: Loretta Sanchez, Wylie Aitken, and Michael Penn. Both Sanchez and Aitken replied within hours of us sending it. But Penn never responded. We got an automatic message which stated he would be out of the office until early January. However, it said he would check messages over the holidays. That was two weeks ago.\n\nWhen The Investigator asked Sanchez about the internship Nocella did for her campaign in the late 1990s–an experience that the Disney executive boasts about on her page on LinkedIn–and if she had any knowledge of Wylie ever meeting her, the former congresswoman told us that she didn’t remember. “I have no recollection of Carrie as an intern nor do I know how she met Wylie,” she told us.\n\nWith respect to Nocella’s appointment to the university’s Board of Governors in 2018, Sanchez stated she wasn’t involved in the nominating process and didn’t know how it worked: “The Governors are a different set of people than the Trustees. I’m not on the Nominating Committee for the Trustees so I really don’t even work on nominating Trustees let alone Governors. I do not know how Governors are selected.”\n\nAs to the extent of her relationship with Nocella, Sanchez told us most dealings were through her work as a congresswoman. “I would see Carrie at many community events as she or her staff were pretty active in the community,” she said. “Once in a while I would sit down to a meeting with her. One example was during the Unite HERE strike which I was attempting to help settle. I have not spoken to Carrie for four or five years.”\n\nNocella’s internship with Sanchez is listed on her LinkedIn page.\n\nThe Investigator also posed some of the exact same questions to Aitken, pretty much asking him point blank if he had ever met Nocella while she was performing her duties as an intern for the congresswoman’s political campaign. “I do not recall her working in the Sanchez campaign,” he told us. “We had a lot of good campaign volunteers and I may have met her but have no recollection.”\n\nNot only did Aitken deny that he did anything to help get her installed on the Board of Governors, but he downplayed how much power he exercised as chair of the Board of Trustees: “I did not have any involvement in her appointment to the Board of Governors and until that happened I was not aware she was a Chapman grad. The role of the Trustees is mainly ministerial.”\n\nWhen queried about the extent of his relationship with Nocella, he said as follows:\n\nMy relationship is at best distant since my understanding is as being allegedly involved in the ‘cabal’ she was not supportive of my daughter’s candidacy though I was aware of her title and role with Disney. In light of her relationship with Sidhu and Murray etc and other council members I would assume she was not excited that I was selected to be the chief negotiator with the Angels at the request of Tom Tait. As you know I was removed by Sidhu after his election and he named himself as chief negotiator. How did that go?\n\nBut whether or not Nocella backed his daughter’s candidacy apparently wasn’t that important to certain members of Aitken’s clan. For example, Penn, his son-in-law, has been longtime “friends” with Nocella on LinkedIn. Almost four years after Harry Sidhu beat his wife in the mayoral race, he “liked” an article written about the Disney executive she herself shared on that social media website in March 2022.\n\nFrom Penn’s LinkedIn page.\n\nGiven that evidence suggests Penn has closer ties to Nocella than Ashleigh, The Investigator is not surprised he didn’t reply to the question we sent him via email. In our third article about this matter, to be published at a later date, we will explore another angle to this story which reveals, among other things, that his dealings with the Disney executive appear to predate her 2018 appointment to the university’s Board of Governors.\n\nHidden in Plain Sight: Disney Exec Under FBI Investigation Went to Elite Prep School With Mayor Aitken\n\nPhotographs of Ashleigh Aitken (l) and Carrie Nocella (r) from a student yearbook published by Rosary Academy in 1992.\n\nBy DUANE J. ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nEarlier this year, someone with direct access to Mayor Ashleigh Aitken’s personal Facebook account proceeded to systematically purge it of all messages that made reference to the name of a family friend. Though there weren’t many items posted which mentioned it, there were just enough that would have raised quite a few eyebrows, especially among investigative journalists.\n\nIt is understandable Mayor Aitken would want to disassociate themselves from this person, at least publicly. The Federal Bureau of Investigation stated in an affidavit released in mid-2022 that they were an employee of an “influential company” and one of the ringleaders of a “cabal” running Anaheim. And the Los Angeles Times would eventually call them out by name: Carrie Nocella.\n\nUp until now, Aitken’s ties to Nocella, who is currently director of External Affairs for the Disneyland Resort, have mostly been the subject of rumors. But a year-long inquiry into this matter by The Anaheim Investigator has uncovered evidence which shows that a relationship has existed between the two. Furthermore, it appears to go back to the early 1990s when both women were still in their teens.\n\nPurged text is highlighted in yellow.\n\nThe Investigator has discovered that between 1991 and 1993, Aitken and Nocella attended Rosary Academy, a small, elite Roman Catholic all-girls college-prep school located in Fullerton. Enrollment data from a commercial website reports that Aitken started in 1989, whereas Nocella (whose maiden name is Leonard) began in 1991. Both graduated in 1993 and 1995, respectively.\n\nInformation that The Investigator has gleaned from a rare hardcopy of a student yearbook published by the private school in 1992 confirms this. For example, Aitken is identified as a “Junior” in one section; Nocella as a “Freshman” in another. Not only are there pages listing what campus clubs and activities they were involved in, but several photographs, including the two reproduced above.\n\nIt is not known at this time if they were classmates. But Rosary Academy’s compact size undoubtedly helped foster a more intimate learning environment, providing greater opportunities for increased social interaction among pupils. Its student population in the early 1990s hovered around 500; enrollment at public schools in the Fullerton Joint Union High School District often exceeded 1,500.\n\nBoth women still regularly keep in touch with their alma mater. Besides fundraisers, Aitken has occasionally been asked to speak at school functions. Nocella, however, plays a much more active role: she is listed on their website as being a member of their “Consultative School Board.” Moreover, her daughter is currently a student and is expected to graduate sometime next year.\n\nAitken speaking at Rosary Academy.\n\nIf this was all The Investigator had to report, this story would stop right here. But to paraphrase Winston Churchill, this article is not the beginning of the end; rather, it is the end of the beginning. Indeed, another piece is forthcoming and it will be far more revealing as it will show that the mayor isn’t the only member of her family who has befriended the controversial Disney executive.\n\nThe Investigator did make a good faith effort to reach out to Aitken and Nocella via email to ask them questions about their time at Rosary Academy and how their relationship formed. Additionally, Aitken was queried about the reason why messages that contained references to Nocella’s name were purged from her personal Facebook account. Neither women bothered to respond.\n\nHowever, an individual employed with the Disneyland Resort that saw the email we sent to Nocella did contact us.

ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nEvidence uncovered by The Anaheim Investigator strongly suggests Mayor Ashleigh Aitken has been a longtime friend of Molly Jolly, senior vice president of Finance/Administration for Angels Baseball, a relationship which appears to have been formed through their past involvement in the Girl Scouts of Orange County, a well-known non-profit organization that both women have championed.\n\nNot only does The Investigator have photographs of Aitken and Jolly mingling at a gathering of wealthy donors celebrating the opening of a Girl Scouts facility in Newport Beach, but has proof that they served on at least one committee together. Furthermore, Form 990s filed with the Internal Revenue Service show Jolly sat on the board of directors of that non-profit for at least eight years.\n\nOur inquiry into this matter started when we reported the mayor and five other council members attended a luncheon at Angel Stadium on June 6th hosted by the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce. Of the more than 200 photos taken of this event, at least a dozen show Aitken and Jolly seated together. In one shot, both women can be seen with Laura Cunningham, president and CEO of the Anaheim Chamber.\n\nJolly, Cunningham, and Aitken at the June 6th luncheon.\n\nThough it is unclear as to when the friendship between Aitken and Jolly first began, newspaper articles, annual reports, photos, and other materials reviewed by The Investigator hint both women started crossing each other’s paths roughly a decade ago when the future mayor began participating in “Celebrate Leadership” fundraisers for the Girl Scouts of Orange County, usually held at the Fashion Island Hotel in Newport Beach.\n\nIn 2013, Kelley Bennett, a high society columnist for the Mission Viejo News, reported that Aitken herself was one of six honored at that year’s fundraiser. “We are proud to recognize these exceptional women,” she quoted Nancy Nygren as saying, who was then-CEO of the non-profit. “They are each leaders in their respective fields and truly serve as role models for tomorrow’s female leaders.”\n\nWithin a year, Aitken and Jolly took on greater roles within the organization. For example, a Form 990 shows that while the latter was elected to the board of directors in 2014, the former eventually joined a committee tasked with organizing their annual “Celebrate Leadership” fundraisers. By 2016, Aitken was co-chair, and in one instance served alongside Jolly and others to plan the one for 2017.\n\nNames highlighted from a Girl Scouts calendar printed in 2015.\n\nOver the past decade, Aitken and her family have contributed thousands of dollars to the Girl Scouts of Orange County. Photos taken of a 2017 event celebrating the opening of the Argyros Girl Scout Leadership Center on the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach not only show her with Jolly, but Bette Aitken, her mother, standing in front of a sign which listed them as giving “$100,000 – $249,999” to help pay for it.\n\nIn 2019, Jolly became chair of the board of directors, increasing her visibility. But Aitken, for whatever reason, dropped out of sight. However, she continued to support the organization financially. According to an annual report published that same year, both Ashleigh and Bette donated between “$25,000-$49,999” to the non-profit–just as much as the Disneyland Resort and Angels Baseball Foundation did.\n\nJolly isn’t the only Angels Baseball executive Aitken has had dealings with before becoming mayor. A Form 990 filed in 2020 by Alzheimer’s Orange County shows she sat on the board of that non-profit the same time Dennis Kuhl, chair of that sports team, was a director. The Investigator also has evidence Kuhl has ties to another member of her family, something that will be disclosed in a future story.\n\nJolly in 2019.\n\nFor matter of record, The Investigator reached out to Aitken via email at least three times posing questions about the extent of her relationship with Jolly and whether ties to the executive would affect her ability to be fair and impartial in any future negotiations the city might have with the Angels Baseball team. But so far, the mayor has failed to respond to our requests for comment.\n\n[Update: An earlier version of this post stated Molly Jolly became chair of the board of directors of the Girl Scouts of Orange County in 2018. That is incorrect. She was elected in 2019.]\n\nAnaheim Chamber Luncheon at Angel Stadium Raises Questions About Mayor, Council Violating Brown Act\n\nMatt Cunningham, James Vanderpool, Molly Jolly, and Laura Cunningham having lunch with Mayor Ashleigh Aitken.\n\nBy DUANE J. ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nThe Anaheim Investigator has reviewed more than 200 photographs that were taken of a luncheon held at Angel Stadium on June 6th which not only clearly show Mayor Ashleigh Aitken sharing a table with Laura Cunningham, president and CEO of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, but Molly Jolly, senior vice president of Finance/Administration for Angels Baseball.\n\nIn one photo, the mayor can be seen talking to Matthew Hicks, vice president of Public Affairs for ocV!BE, a $4 billion mixed-use development surrounding the Honda Center that is controlled by Henry Samueli, a Newport Beach billionaire. In another, John Carpino, president of Angels Baseball and right-hand man for team owner Arte Moreno, is standing directly behind her.\n\nMayor Aitken was not alone at this event. Photos show Councilman Stephen Faessel sat at the ocV!BE table between Hicks and George Urch, their lobbyist. Councilwomen Natalie Meeks and Norma Campos-Kurtz were huddled together off to the side, not far from Mike Lyster, chief communications officer for the City of Anaheim. Fire Chief Pat Russell was also present.\n\nMayor Pro Tem Natalie Rubalcava and Councilman Jose Diaz were seated at the same table as Aitken was. So was City Manager James Vanderpool, who was stuck in the middle of Jolly and Matt Cunningham, Laura’s husband. Also joining them was Alicia Valadez-Gonzalez of Northgate Markets. One photo shows Berenice Ballinas, Aitken’s Chief of Staff, taking selfies with her.\n\nThe Anaheim Chamber of Commerce table.\n\nThe luncheon, an annual event that is organized by the Anaheim Chamber, typically brings in a little league baseball team from the local community to meet and interact with persons who played for Angels Baseball, both past and present. Some of the featured guests on June 6th included Patrick Sandoval, Chuck Finley, and Clyde Wright, three generations of Angels pitchers.\n\nThis year’s main sponsor was Visit Anaheim, the tourism industry promotion bureau, which paid $10,000 for the spot. SA Recycling, Manheim California, Republic Services, and Best Western Stovall’s Hotels each chipped in $2,750. And Anaheim Regional Transportation, Brewery X, Liuna Local 652, ocV!BE, Pacific Western Bank and Radiant Futures put up $1,750 a piece.\n\nNeither Mayor Aitken or any of the five council members who attended this luncheon responded to questions The Investigator emailed them asking about who paid for their tickets and what actions they took to avoid violating the Brown Act, the state law which regulates the conduct of elected officials at meetings. Instead, they directed our questions to Lyster.\n\n“The Brown Act,” he told us via email, “allows a majority of or all Council members to attend public events without discussing city business among themselves. Our Council members are made aware of and follow this practice.” Though Lyster is technically correct, there is one slight problem: tickets to this luncheon cost a whopping $200 per person and were “limited.”\n\nIt could be conceivably argued that despite the fact this event was “open” to the public, the steep price of admission created a barrier to access based on wealth and social class: only people with money could afford to attend. The Brown Act makes it illegal for public meetings to be held in facilities which require payment to enter, but that provision doesn’t seem to apply here.\n\nWith respect to the tickets that the mayor, city council, and city staff received from the Anaheim Chamber, Lyster said as follows:\n\nMayor Aitken, Mayor Pro Tem Rubalcava and Council Members Faessel, Diaz, Campos Kurtz and Meeks attended and were provided tickets.\n\nFor Aitken, Faessel and Kurtz, their tickets fall under ceremonial job duties as Aitken addressed attendees, Faessel did the invocation and Kurtz led the pledge of allegiance.\n\nFor Rubalcava, Meeks, Diaz and City Manager Jim Vanderpool, it will fall to them to list their tickets as part of a form 700 due in spring 2024.\n\nIn a follow up email, he confirmed the city didn’t pay for the tickets and that the Anaheim Chamber gave them away for free.\n\nCarpino, Aitken and Meeks.\n\nBecause this is a breaking news story, The Investigator is still in the process of gathering information about this luncheon. Last week, we filed multiple public records act requests with the city to see if there are any emails and other documents which might shed more light on this matter. If we find anything else significant to report on, a follow up article will be written.\n\nFor matter of record, The Investigator does not possess the legal expertise to determine if the mayor and city council violated the Brown Act. And even if Lyster is fundamentally correct, none of this changes the fact they were having private conversations with representatives from the Anaheim Chamber, Angels Baseball, and other business interests out of public view.\n\nInterestingly enough, there also seems have been a conscious decision by elected officials to keep this luncheon a secret. With the exception of a notation Aitken posted on her June calendar, nobody has talked about it. If it wasn’t for The Investigator’s dogged determination to expose what politicians do behind closed doors, the public would have never known it occurred.\n\nDid Mayor Aitken Mislead Journalists About Ducks Tickets She Gave to UFCW Local 324 Political Director?\n\nDerek Smith, political director for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 324. a union whose headquarters are based in Buena Park.\n\nBy DUANE J. ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nAn email currently in the possession of The Anaheim Investigator offers compelling evidence suggesting that Mayor Ashleigh Aitken might have deliberately misled journalists from a mainstream media outlet about the intended recipient of two city-owned tickets worth $350 to a Ducks vs. Bruins game which took place at the Honda Center on January 8th.\n\nIn a June 13th article entitled,”Anaheim Politicians Shower Staff, Campaign Donors with Free Event Tickets,” Noah Biesiada and Hosam Elatar, two reporters for the Voice of OC, a local news website, wrote about a Form 802 that Aitken filed which disclosed she gave these tickets to Derek Smith, political director for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 324.\n\nAccording to Biesiada and Elatar, records show Smith ran a committee “that spent over $138,000 promoting Aitken’s candidacy.” When asked why he got tickets, the mayor replied she “wanted to support a group that ‘represents Anaheim working families.'” But the reporters said they were “unable to confirm who actually used the tickets after she gave them to Smith.“\n\nForm 802 filed by Aitken.\n\nThough it’s not entirely clear as to what Biesiada and Elatar meant when they stated they were “unable to confirm who actually used the tickets,” The Investigator believes–and we admit this is speculative–that Aitken misled them by insisting she gave those tickets to the political director so that he could then pass them on to someone else at UFCW Local 324.\n\nHowever, The Investigator—which first broke the story about this quid pro quo between Aitken and Smith on May 9th–not only has an email written by the mayor herself proving he was the intended recipient of her largess, but we know as a fact the Ducks tickets she gave are “non-transferable” as they are only available electronically via smartphone through an app.\n\nIn an email dated January 5th with the subject header, “Ducks tickets for Sunday,” Lauren Torres, a city council services coordinator, received the following message from the mayor: “Hi Lauren,” wrote Aitken. “Can you please assign Sundays tickets suite to Derek Smith.” She included his email address and phone number, blacked out by the city clerk due to privacy laws.\n\nEmail proves tickets went to Smith.\n\nThe Ducks tickets that Aitken asked Torres to “assign” to Smith are not in paper form. They are only available electronically via smartphone through an app. The only way Smith could access them is through the email address he gave the mayor. Because tickets are “non-transferable,” nobody else could have used them unless Smith gave them control of his email account.\n\nPerhaps it also should be mentioned that if Aitken did indeed inform these reporters the tickets she gave to Smith were originally meant for somebody else, that could open her up to criminal prosecution. For example, Penal Code 115 does make it a felony under state law to knowingly file a Form 802 with the city clerk that contains false and inaccurate information.\n\nLast week, The Investigator sought further clarification regarding this matter and reached out to Biesiada and Elatar to ask them about what Aitken specifically told them about the tickets she gave to Smith. So far, neither of them have responded to our inquiry. Aitken was also contacted by us to learn more. Unsurprisingly, the mayor completely ignored our email.\n\nPhone Text Messages Show Mayor Aitken Secretly Met With Angels Baseball President John Carpino\n\nJohn Carpino, president of Angels Baseball team, at a private event held in Phoenix, Arizona in February 2023.\n\nBy DUANE ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nIn a recent article published in the Voice of OC entitled, “Who’s on the Hook for Angel Stadium Repairs?,” Hosam Elatar posed several questions to Mayor Ashleigh Aitken about issues related to Angel Stadium, including its pending assessment by a private consultant hired by the City of Anaheim. One thing she made perfectly clear: “The Angels have not reached out to me, nor has the city reached out to the Angels.”\n\nHowever, The Anaheim Investigator has uncovered evidence that Aitken not only secretly met with John Carpino, president of the Angels Baseball team, at a coffee shop in late February, but that the meeting she had with him might have dealt with the Angel Stadium assessment. Why? It was scheduled only thirty minutes before city officials toured the facility with a group of consultants interested in bidding for the job.\n\nPhone text messages The Investigator obtained under the public records act show Carpino initiated contact with Aitken on Thursday, February 16th. “Do you have time for coffee in the next few weeks?” he asked. “Yes, I do. Can you meet me at 8:30 at Bodhi coffee on Monday the 27th?,” the mayor responded. On February 26th, Aitken texted him again to confirm the meeting was still on. “Yes, looking forward to it,” he said.\n\nAitken confirming meeting with Carpino.\n\nWhen The Investigator carefully reviewed the February calendar that Mayor Aitken made available to the public which supposedly lists all of the meetings “requested” of her that month, absolutely nothing is mentioned about her having coffee with Carpino on the 27th. During the last week, she stated only two things occurred: a city council meeting and a meeting with “Disneyland representatives.”\n\nNo mention of Carpino meeting in the mayor’s calendar.\n\nIt isn’t a coincidence the secret meeting that Aitken had with Carpino at the Bodhi Leaf Coffee Traders shop in Orange was scheduled at 8:30 a.m. on February 27th. Approximately thirty minutes later, a group of consultants invited by the City of Anaheim gathered under the “Big A” sign to do a tour of Angel Stadium to bid on “a property condition assessment” of that facility. A sign-in sheet recorded that 25 persons attended.\n\nPartial screenshot of website listing Angel Stadium tour.\n\nFurthermore, several letters show that just days before their meeting, both Carpino and ArentFox Schiff LLP, a prestigious law firm retained by the sports team, demanded that the city cancel the tour of Angel Stadium, asserting it was a violation of the lease agreement–a claim vigorously rejected by City Manager James Vanderpool and City Attorney Robert Fabela. Carpino made sure to copy his letter to Aitken.\n\nSo far, the mayor hasn’t responded to questions The Investigator sent regarding the secret meeting she had with Carpino in late February. But perhaps it should be noted these types of behind-the-scenes political maneuvers with executives of the Angels Baseball team are part of the reason why former Mayor Harry Sidhu got into trouble with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was forced to resign his seat.\n\nBelow are letters exchanged in February between representatives of the Angels Baseball team and the City of Anaheim regarding the tour of Angel Stadium.\n\nCo-Founder of Weed Retailer Wrote Ballot Measure in 2021 to Legalize Cannabis Businesses in Anaheim\n\nThe front entrance to the Catalyst Cannabis Co. retail outlet in Santa Ana which is located right next to the 55 Fwy.\n\nBy DUANE ROBERTS\n\nEditor & Publisher\n\nDamian Martin, Esq., co-founder of Catalyst Cannabis Co., an expanding retail chain of “weed stores” with locations in Long Beach and Santa Ana, told The Anaheim Investigator via email he authored a measure in June 2021 that would have put the question of legalizing cannabis businesses before Anaheim voters the very next year had it collected the signatures needed to qualify for the ballot.\n\nIn the email, Martin said his firm had “retained the services” of Adam Spiker, vice-president of Spiker Rendon Consulting, Inc., a lobbyist with offices in downtown Los Angeles, to “pursue cannabis policy advancement and licensing through cannabis ballot measures in the L.A. County South Bay, particularly the cities of Redondo Beach, El Segundo, Hermosa Beach, and Manhattan Beach.“\n\n“However as also widely reported the South Bay projects began to go very poorly,” he typed. “[T]he cities were very opposed to us and our approach, and there were internal disagreements on project strategy, and, as a result, there was a falling out between Catalyst and Spiker Rendon, such that by March 2022, Catalyst and Mr. Spiker / Spiker Rendon were no long actively working together.”\n\nDamian Martin.\n\n“Prior to the falling out, Anaheim was a city that Catalyst was planning to pursue cannabis policy advancement and licensing with Adam Spiker / Spiker Rendon as our consultant using the ‘South Bay Model’, i.e., through a ballot measure…. I was asked by Mr. Spiker to draft (and then drafted) the initial version of what became ‘The Anaheim Cannabis Regulation and Land Use Measure’ in June 2021.”\n\nMartin said that after Catalyst and Spiker parted ways, his firm decided to completely abandon the initiative. “Other than the initial drafting, Catalyst did not play a behind-the-scenes role in trying to get ‘The Anaheim Cannabis Regulation and Land Use Measure’ going,” he said. Furthermore, he emphasized they were “not involved in any political / community coalition building” to support it.\n\nWhen Martin was asked about a similarly named, albeit differently worded measure the city clerk’s office received from Stacy Silva on October 15, 2021, he said he was unaware of it. Evidence The Investigator has uncovered shows that Silva has been employed as an office clerk at the Buena Park headquarters of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 324 at least since 2009.\n\nBy early 2022, Adam Spiker had adopted Martin’s measure as his own. A version of it was submitted to the city clerk’s office by Belal Dalati on March 21st. In an email sent roughly two hours before Dalati dropped by to file the required paperwork, Kenneth G. Spiker, Jr., president and CEO of Spiker Rendon Consulting, Inc., asked a city official if he could call him to discuss “our Anaheim Initiative.”\n\nBut it never made it to the ballot. On May 16th, Dalati withdrew the measure at the urging of Paul Kott and Bill Taormina, two prominent businessmen who were anti-pot and opposed to the legalization of cannabis businesses in Anaheim. Taormina would allege in a text message to Councilman Trevor O’Neil that Dalati had been “forced” to file it “by Jeff Flint and other ‘dope deal’ promoters.”\n\nAs we first reported, Todd Ament, president and CEO of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, Jeff Flint, president of Core Strategic Group, and Mayor Harry Sidhu approached UFCW Local 324 between 2019 and 2020 and cut a deal: that in return for a labor peace agreement in any ordinance they introduced to legalize cannabis businesses, the union was to pressure the council to vote “yes.”\n\nEarlier this month, Adam Spiker declined to speak to The Investigator about this affair citing ongoing “local and federal investigations.” Though we don’t know how he managed to muscle his way into the arrangement the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce made with UFCW Local 324, the Orange County Register reported in May 2022 he had been in close contact with both Ament and Flint."
