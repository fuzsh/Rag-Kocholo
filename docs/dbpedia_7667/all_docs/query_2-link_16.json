        "text": "Who We Are\n\nFounded in 1981, The Public Law Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit providing free legal services to low income residents and other nonprofits in Orange County. Last year, Public Law Center staff and volunteers provided over 65,000 hours of free legal services in handling over 4,500 cases benefiting low-income children, adults and seniors. The estimated value of this work is roughly $60 million in just the past three years. Our services include counseling, individual representation, community education and strategic policy advocacy and impact litigation to challenge societal injustices.\n\nOur Volunteers\n\nVolunteers can change somebody’s life. Last year, volunteers gave over 34,000 pro bono hours to assist our clients. Our volunteers include partners and associates at major law firms, in-house corporate counsel, solo and small firm practitioners, young lawyers, paralegals, law students, college students and an array of individuals concerned about ensuring access to justice. Our staff is committed to providing training, mentorship, samples, technical assistance, and Spanish and Vietnamese translation and interpretation to support our pro bono volunteers.\n\nWho We Serve\n\nWe serve a wide range of clients, including immigrants, minorities, veterans, seniors, children, and low-income residents of Orange County. The issues range from domestic violence, human trafficking, guardianship, housing, health, bankruptcy, asylum, family law, consumer fraud, immigration, discrimination, and advocacy. Our services range from training seminars to individual legal advice to full representation. We also provide extensive legal support to Orange County nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations so they can better meet their legal obligations, protect themselves from unnecessary litigation, and focus on delivering critical services to Orange County residents.\n\nPress\n\nHuntington Beach ordered to pay affordable housing group $3.5 million in legal fees\n\nMay 11, 2023, Orange County Register\n\nLawyers at PLC Address Housing Issues for Low-Income Clients\n\nMay 2023\n\nThe Four Women Leading Orange County’s Pro Bono Legal Services Organizations Embrace The Future\n\nMarch 2023\n\nWTLC Named Public Law Center’s Community Partner of the Year\n\nJuly 13, 2022, Fullerton Observer\n\nFor bargain-rate legal help, something isn’t always better than nothing\n\nMarch 27, 2022, Reuters\n\nKnobbe Martens Partner Christy Lea to Serve as 2022 President of Orange County’s Public Law Center Board of Directors\n\nJanuary 6, 2022, BusinessWire\n\nSanta Ana proposes to increase developer fees, push for local workers\n\nApril 18, 2022, OC Register\n\nHow Are OC Cities Planning To Spend Their Federal Neighborhood Grant Money?\n\nMay 3, 2022, Voice of OC\n\nLetters to the Editor: How a state bar plan could make shoddy legal service flourish\n\nFebruary 10, 2022, LA Times\n\nCalifornia must end legal abuse of borrowers by collection agencies\n\nAugust 24, 2021, CalMatters\n\n» All Press"
