        "text": "Gracey Van Der Mark, Mayor\n\nMayor Van Der Mark is the daughter of immigrant parents from Ecuador and Mexico who came to America in search of a better life. Raised with 10 brothers and sisters, she is a self-described fighter to give voice to the under-served. She grew up in Los Angeles where she met her husband Pieter. Gracey and Pieter are small business owners. They moved to Huntington Beach 23 years ago from Los Angeles to seek safety, quality of life and a family-friendly environment to raise their blended family of 7 children. Gracey is a proud grandmother to her first grandson, Ethan.\n\nAs Gracey's children grew older she became committed to serving her community. She was selected to serve on the Measure R Bond Oversight Committee for the Ocean View School District and was asked to serve on the Measure Q Bond Oversight Committee for the Huntington Beach City School District. Mrs. Van Der Mark also served on the City of Huntington Beach Finance Commission for three years.\n\nWhile serving on the Bond Oversight Committees, Mrs. Van Der Mark became more involved in local elementary school matters. As a result of her relentless research and ability to expose concerning curriculum, Gracey co-founded Concerned Parents of California, a parent-driven advocacy group. She planned, organized and executed numerous advocacy trips to Sacramento to meet with legislators on behalf of parents and children. She has been a guest speaker to parent and civic groups across Southern California helping parents understand and advocate for their children's safe and appropriate education.\n\nMayor Van Der Mark is extremely grateful for the quality of life afforded her and her family in Huntington Beach. She is 100% community-focused and passionately committed to preserving our previous suburban beach community for future generations to enjoy these same opportunities.\n\nRhonda Bolton, Council Member\n\nEmail Rhonda Bolton\n\nCouncilmember Rhonda M. Bolton was appointed to the Huntington Beach City Council in July 2021, filling the vacancy left by a resigning Councilmember.\n\nCouncilmember Bolton began her public service career as a legislative aide to a Member of the United States House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. She attended law school after her Congressional service and joined an AmLaw 100 firm where she spent fifteen years in private practice. Her work for the firm primarily focused on federal public policy, government relations, and regulatory matters.\n\nOver the course of her career, Ms. Bolton had the privilege of working to shape many landmark laws such as the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In addition, litigated dozens of cases at the federal district and appellate court levels regarding the interpretation of federal statutes and the scope of federal regulatory authority.\n\nWhile at the law firm, Ms. Bolton also became involved in work to support junior attorneys, helping to place them on the path toward success in challenging, large law firm environments. This work led to her involvement in heading up the firm’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and her expertise in this area led to her being tapped by a firm client, Kia Motors America, Inc., to develop and lead the company’s inaugural DEI initiative.\n\nAfter four years of helming an award-winning DEI and corporate philanthropy program for Kia, Ms. Bolton established the nationwide DEI consultancy IncludeMe LLC. The consultancy presently serves corporations across sectors, professional service firms, government agencies and non-profit organizations, guiding senior leaders in developing and executing strategies to build teams that maximize innovation, efficiency and employee engagement.\n\nCouncilmember Bolton devotes her “free” time to work with several non-profits supporting higher education and economic opportunity for under-represented students, reflecting her passion for equity and liberty for all people. Prior to her City Council appointment, she was appointed in January 2020 to the city’s Human Relations Task Force.\n\nCouncilmember Bolton holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from the University of Houston, and a Juris Doctor degree from the College of William and Mary School of Law.
