        "text": "When musician David Washburn had the chance to play trumpet for one of the “Star Wars” films as part of John Williams’ orchestra, he savored the moment.\n\n“The first time playing the score, the first thing they put on our stand was the suite,” Washburn said. “The room was electric. When the movie came out — I was in college — it was the biggest thing musically we had ever heard in a movie. To be able to play it was a dream.”\n\nWashburn, 59, of Huntington Beach has been in the trumpet section of Williams’ orchestra for about 20 years, recording on a variety of soundtracks, including “Star Wars” films “The Force Awakens,” “Rogue One” and “The Last Jedi.”\n\nWashburn has also performed with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra for 25 years, currently as the principal trumpet player.\n\nHe’s recorded more than 500 film soundtracks over the years, including “War for the Planet of the Apes,” “Spiderman: Homecoming,” “The Legend of Zorro,” “Troy,” “A Beautiful Mind,” “The Perfect Storm,” “Titanic” and “Deep Impact.”\n\nWashburn discovered he had a natural predilection for the trumpet as a child, possibly from his father, who played trumpet at the 1915 World’s Fair in the Bay Area. Washburn seriously took up the instrument at age 11.\n\nWashburn went on to attain his undergraduate music degree from the University of Southern California in 1980 and a master’s degree from the New England Conservatory in Boston. During this time, Washburn said he didn’t know if he would have the musical chops to make it professionally in the cutthroat industry.\n\n“I always knew I would play trumpet, but not necessarily at the professional level,” he said.\n\nFollowing his schooling, Washburn moved abroad to perform as the principal trumpet player of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. A few years later he returned stateside, claiming the Los Angeles Chamber position.\n\nEarly in his career, Washburn began to serve as the principal trumpet player for James Horner’s orchestra. Horner, who died in 2015, was an Academy Award-winning film composer who scored “Titanic,” “Apollo 13,” “Braveheart” and “Field of Dreams,” among others.\n\nWashburn’s reputation in the studio grew, and through word of mouth he landed a prestigious role in Williams’ trumpet section. He’s gone on to record about 20 movies with Williams, who is considered the greatest film composer of all time.\n\n“He is very friendly and supportive of the orchestra,” Washburn said of Williams. “He is very cordial with everybody, but knows what he wants when he’s on the podium.\n\n“You know you are working with someone who is really special. You just enjoy the moment with him making great music.”\n\nThe orchestra usually doesn’t practice. Each musician arrives at the recording session with the ability to sight-read the music on the spot.\n\n“We rehearse right there and then by the second or third time we are recording,” Washburn said. “Sometimes we record the first take.”\n\nAlthough Washburn enjoys recording soundtracks for movies, he loves performing live for an audience.\n\nHis favorite piece to play is Bach’s “Brandenburg Concerto No. 2.” Washburn is considered to be one of only a handful of trumpet players who can perform the complex composition.\n\n“It’s taken me around the world,” he said.\n\nHis ability to play at such a skilled level while still maintaining his trademark humility has endeared Washburn to his colleagues.\n\n“David is an incredible trumpet player and a beautiful musician,” said Tereza Stanislav, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra assistant concertmaster. “He has a warm sound and stunning virtuosity. He’s also an incredibly kind person. When he plays the trumpet, you can hear that in the warmth of his tone.”\n\nbenjamin.brazil@latimes.com"
