        "text": "Before and Afterschool Programs\n\nBefore and/or afterschool programs are available at middle schools through community partnerships. Most elementary schools offer an Extended Day Enrichment Program operated by Orange County Public Schools. Some elementary programs are operated by RFP selected out-sourced providers.\n\nOCPS Extended Day Enrichment Program\n\nThe Extended Day Enrichment Program offers supervision and a variety of enrichment activities for children in kindergarten through 5th grade. The program is fee-supported by those using its services. Daily activities include homework time, structured supervised free play, art, drama, crafts, music, dance and organized team games.\n\nSafety\n\nChildren in the program are carefully supervised. Parents or guardians are expected to sign their children in and out of the Extended Day Enrichment Program. Children are released to persons authorized in writing on the registration form on file with the program. Persons not recognized by the staff will be asked to show identification. Special instructions pertaining to a child's care should be given in writing to the program coordinator. Each Extended Day Enrichment Program has a telephone and voice mail for emergency communication.\n\nHours of Operation\n\nStandard hours of operation are 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. The program operates every day that school is in regular session. At the option of the principal, program services may be offered on teacher workdays, holidays and summer breaks. During these breaks, children may attend the Extended Day Enrichment Program of their choice with the principal's approval.\n\nFees\n\nThe fee schedule for the Extended Day Enrichment Program is uniform throughout the district. Fees are approved by the School Board of Orange County. An annual registration fee of $12 is required. A refundable deposit equal to two weeks' tuition is required for each student at the time of registration. All fees are weekly whether the child attends full time or part time. Credit cannot be given for absences. If a child is absent for a full week, no charge will be made for that week. Check with the site coordinator concerning payment dates and deadlines.\n\nFinancial aid is available through the OCPS scholarship program. More information is available from the program coordinator.\n\nA student will be withdrawn from the program for nonpayment of tuition. The Florida-State Constitution (Article VII, Section 10) requires tuition to be paid in advance. Late pick-up fees will be charged at the rate of $40 per hour in 15 minute intervals.\n\nHabitual tardiness in pick-up of children will result in dismissal from the program.\n\nStandard Weekly Fees\n\n1st and 2nd Child\n\nEach Additional Child\n\nMorning Only\n\n$27.40 per child\n\n$22.40 per child\n\nAfternoon Only\n\n$42.40 per child\n\n$37.40 per child\n\nMorning and Afternoon\n\n$52.40 per child\n\n$47.40 per child\n\nSummer Full Day\n\n$108.40 per child\n\n$103.40 per child\n\nVPK Extended Day Options AM Care Before VPK PM Session $48.40 PM Care After VPK AM Session $48.40\n\nScholarships\n\nA limited number of scholarships are available to assist families. Ask the Extended Day program coordinator for a scholarship application.\n\nIncome Tax Child Care Credit\n\nExpenses for school-age child care qualify for income tax child care credit. When completing Internal Revenue Service Form W-10, list the name of the dependent care provider as the School Board of Orange County, Florida, followed by the particular elementary school in parentheses. The address for the School Board of Orange County should be listed as P.O. Box 271, Orlando, Florida 32802.\n\nThe Taxpayer Identification Number is 59-6000-771. Weekly receipts are issued and need to be kept for income tax reporting. Account statements for tax purposes are available upon request. Please speak with the site coordinator."
