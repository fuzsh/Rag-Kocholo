This information can then be used to make decisions about how the Voice of OC will refer to these people, places and more in published articles. It can also serve as a knowledge base and go-to source for questions about topics that are important to the Voice of OC community.\n\nHow to use this wiki[]\n\nThis wiki is meant to be the first source for style questions for Voice of OC articles. The list of all articles on this wiki can be found by clicking on \"Style guide\" in the navigation menu. If you can't find an answer to a question here, consider creating a page that will -- at least eventually -- contain the answer, or edit/update an existing page. For style questions not covered here, consult the Associated Press style guide (which also has helpful information on punctuation and libel). For spelling questions not covered here or in the AP style guide, consult Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition."
