        "text": "Voice of San Diego has hosted interns since 2006. We created the program to inspire young journalists to pursue careers in investigative journalism. Our internship provides them with opportunities to explore their interests while working with practicing journalists who can provide valuable advice and mentoring. Voice offers three paid internships each year: winter, summer and fall.\n\nThe program is managed by Andrea Lopez-Villafaña, Voice Managing Editor. Lopez-Villafaña works with each intern to identify topics they’d like to explore and skills they’d like to develop during the internship. He provides coaching and guidance throughout the internship.\n\nInterns work on individual reporting projects and support other Voice journalists’ reporting efforts. Interns gain a better understanding of local civic affairs and how to produce compelling investigative storytelling that serves all San Diego communities. The goal is that, at the end of the program, each intern should have a variety of published stories to add to their portfolio.\n\nVoice’s internship program is made possible by the generous support of The Granada Fund and SDG&E.\n\nCurrent Intern\n\nSee Emily’s work.\n\nPast Interns\n\nSee Juan’s work.\n\nApply\n\nAre you an aspiring journalist? Would you like to apply to our internship program?
