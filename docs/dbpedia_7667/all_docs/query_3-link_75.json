        "text": "Everyone likes a good rematch.\n\nRemember the “blue wave” in 2018, when a pack of Trump-loathing political newbies unseated half of the GOP’s California congressional seats in the largest nationwide Democratic Congressional blitz since Watergate? Now Democrats want to protect what’s theirs and claw back a seat that flipped back during a special election. Buoyed by the president’s persistent unpopularity in the state and high expected turnout, party optimists even hope to expand further into solidly Republican rural California.\n\nBut California’s freshman Democrats now have a record — on impeachment, Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, criminal justice and their perceived closeness with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Republicans plan to hammer them on it. Below, a recap of the most competitive, interesting or consequential contests.\n\n— By Ben Christopher\n\nDistrict 1\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nFrom Sacramento’s northern exurbs to the Oregon border, from just west of Redding to just west of Reno, this district is larger than West Virginia. Its particular brand of anti-Sacramento conservatism is best represented by the yellow flag of the State of Jefferson — a California secession movement that never quite took, but never quite left the popular imagination either.\n\nThat strain is also apparent in the district’s electoral history. President Trump won here by 20 points in 2016. Republicans make up a higher share of the electorate than in any other California congressional district and they outnumber Democrats by 12 percentage points.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\n'Truly terrifying:' LaMalfa introduces bills to outlaw sex-change treatments in children\n\nAudrey Denney announces second congressional bid, underscores Camp Fire effects\n\nGreen New Deal activists make first 2020 endorsement in wildfire-burned California\n\nDistrict 4\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nStretching from Truckee to Kings Canyon, this is California’s foothill and mountain district. When California’s redistricting commission cobbled this 300-mile span together, it was to create a block of voters with shared concerns about land management, fire, national parks, mountain recreation and rural economic development. Electorally speaking, those varied communities have also tended to share a general preference for Republicans.\n\nBut over the last decade, the suburbs and its politics have been slowly creeping in. Sacramento’s metro area has been one of the fastest growing in California. And while the district remains one of the most Republican-leaning in the state, all those new voters, many fleeing the Bay Area in search of cheaper housing, have created the slightest of openings for less conservative candidates.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nRepublican Challenges Pelosi Mask Requirement at House Hearing\n\nTom McClintock voted against the coronavirus aid package. Here’s why\n\nDistrict 10\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nIt’s in the Central Valley, but the Bay Area’s fingerprints are all over it.\n\nThe Bay’s housing market has caused Tracy’s population to surge with super-commuters in recent years. During the Trump era, Bay Area campaign cash has made races here among the most expensive, and its weekend volunteers have poured over the hills into Modesto and Turlock.\n\nThough this is a seat Democrats nabbed from Republicans in 2018, it’s been leaning that direction for half a decade. In 2015, the number of registered Democrats surpassed Republicans, and Clinton beat Trump by 3 points.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nMcCarthy yanks Howze endorsement after 'disappointing' social media posts\n\nDemocrats winning money wars in several California congressional races\n\nDistrict 21\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nJutting from the southeastern edge of Fresno south to Bakersfield, this district has the highest poverty rate of any in the state.\n\nIt’s also long seemed to defy political logic. Registered Democrats have outnumbered Republicans by double digits for years. Trump was soundly defeated here in 2016. And yet, election after election, voters re-hired a Republican for Congress. That disequilibrium broke last year — barely. GOP Rep.

It’s also one of the state’s more conservative plots. Republicans outnumber Democrats, and Trump won here by nearly 10 points.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\n'We couldn't stand it any more': why disaffection with Devin Nunes is growing among his constituents\n\nRaise your hand if you have not been sued by Devin Nunes\n\nDistrict 25\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nThe three valleys that form the north Los Angeles suburbs — Simi, Santa Clarita and Antelope — have always been defined in opposition to their metropolitan neighbor. In the 1970s, Santa Clarita became synonymous with white flight, as L.A.’s middle- and upper-middle-class white residents and much of the L.A. law enforcement workforce fled crime, mandatory busing and urban living. This all gave the region a decidedly conservative bent: Simi Valley is home to the Reagan national library.\n\nBut those politics have been changing — partly in reaction to the Trump era but also as a function of diversifying demographics.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nMike Garcia is hoping he can hold on past November\n\nDistrict Profile: A Rematch in California's 25th\n\nEndorsement: Send Christy Smith to Congress\n\nGOP Rep.

Even so, the 2018 election pitting a Latino veteran political novice against a well-known Korean American former legislator was a nail-biter. It took two weeks of ballot counting before anyone was ready to declare the Democrat the victor.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nDemocrats are cozying up to corporate lobbyists despite purity pledges\n\nInternal poll shows tight race in California House district Democrats flipped in 2018\n\nEndorsement: Elect Young Kim to represent the 39th congressional district\n\nDistrict 45\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nHugging the west side of the Santa Ana Mountains, this inland Orange County district runs from Yorba Linda’s edge to Mission Viejo. Republicans still narrowly outnumber Democrats district-wide, with dark blue clusters around UC Irvine. And as with much of Orange County, President Trump and his flavor of GOP politics are unpopular with this affluent, highly educated electorate. Since 2014, the GOP share of the electorate here has declined 7 points — a more precipitous drop than in any other congressional district on this list.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nLawmaker stumps postmaster general with postcard question\n\nPoliticians are using Cameo to pay celebrities to make video endorsements, and it’s all legal\n\nMission Viejo Congressional Candidate’s Social Media Blocking Stirs First Amendment Debate\n\nDistrict 48\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nThis 50-mile stretch of Orange County coastline represents the high-water mark of the blue wave. In no California congressional district represented by a Democrat are the Dems outnumbered by a larger spread (5%) or did President Trump receive a higher share of the 2016 vote (46%).\n\nSo how did a Democrat capture the seat? Democrats are hoping it was due to a strong candidate and a lasting shift of otherwise conservative voters away from the Trumpified GOP.\n\nBut Republicans are counting on a simpler answer: Dana Rohrabacher.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nGOP zeroes in on just a handful of California House races\n\n2 Orange County supervisors defend restaurant that defied Newsom order\n\nDistrict 49\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nIt’s a political mishmash of historic Republican strongholds (affluent Rancho Santa Fe, the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, and San Clemente, home to President Nixon’s “Western White House”) alongside reliable Democratic voting blocs (seaside Encinitas, the UC San Diego Campus).\n\nIn practice, the district has a slight GOP-edge, an environmentalist streak and a recent history of voting for Democrats. In other words, a toss-up.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nLevin Discusses Congressional Climate Action Plan; Maryott Announces Environmental Platform\n\nElect Brian Maryott to represent the 49th congrElect Brian Maryott to represent the 49th congressional districtessional district\n\nBrian Maryott, GOP Rival to Rep.

Ranging from suburban to exurban to rural, this is one of the most Republican districts in the state. GOP voters outnumber Democrats by 10 points, and Trump won here by 15.\n\nBut Republicans are carrying some baggage into this election. Baggage called “former Congressman Duncan Hunter.”\n\nIn December of 2019, the Marine combat veteran from a San Diego political family — who spent the 2018 election accusing his opponent of ties to terrorism — pleaded guilty to misusing more than $200,000 in campaign contributions. Federal prosecutors said he misappropriated the funds for (among other things) bar benders, school tuition, extra-marital engagements and a cross-country flight for a pet bunny.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nVIDEO - Election 2020: the 50th congressional district\n\nQ&A: Darrell Issa, candidate for the 50th Congressional District\n\nQ&A: Ammar Campa-Najjar, candidate for the 50th Congressional District\n\nIn Unsolicited Nod, Barack Obama Endorses Campa-Najjar for Congress in CA50\n\nGOP’s hold on one of its few California House seats may be slipping\n\nLocal Democrats Angered By 50th District Candidate Campa-Najjar’s Interview With Far-Right Group\n\nDistrict 53\n\nLive Election Results\n\nAbout the district\n\nHooking north and east around San Diego proper before extending into the suburbs, this district has been solidly Democratic since the 1990s. These days its demographic profile is a pretty good description of the national party: majority non-white, a mix of urban core and inner suburbs, a few highly educated enclaves and a large LGBTQ neighborhood. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1.\n\nWhere is the district?\n\nEndorsements\n\nRelevant Stories\n\nCandidates’ Starkly Different Backgrounds Shape 53rd Congressional District Race\n\nGloves come off as Democrats fight for House seat in California"
