In his LACO Music Director inaugural season, which opens in September 2019 and continues through May 2020, Martín displays his passion for music spanning five centuries, his commitment to commissioning new works and his dedication to expanding the reach of LACO’s artistry through partnerships with preeminent and rising artists and leading presenters and venues. Marking an exciting new era for the Orchestra and classical music in Los Angeles, the season is also deeply personal for Martín, who introduces LACO audiences to several exceptional artists important to his own career arc. Following his prominent career as a flutist, Martín, who is the sixth Music Director to lead LACO since its inception in 1968, has risen to international acclaim as a conductor in recent years. Most recently, he led the London Philharmonic on a nine-concert European tour and was named Principal Conductor of the RTE National Symphony Orchestra, effective in September 2019.\n\nOver a season that features a major orchestral series, unique SESSION performances, Baroque Conversations concerts, In Focus chamber music evenings and more in over a dozen venues throughout Southern California, Martín conducts six concerts, presents four world premieres, all LACO commissions, a U.S. premiere/co-commission and a West Coast premiere. He presents the LACO debuts of three acclaimed guest artists with whom he has enjoyed particularly meaningful professional relationships, mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter, violinist Christian Tetzlaff and pianist Denis Kozhukhin, and also features pianists Jeremy Denk and David Fray, among other esteemed guest artists. Building on LACO’s relationships with three noted composers representing classical music’s diversity and breadth, he collaborates with Andrew Norman, who just concluded a seven-year tenure as LACO’s Creative Advisor and Composer-in-Residence, Derrick Spiva Jr., LACO’s first Artist Educator, and Juan Pablo Contreras, whose first LACO commission was premiered by the Orchestra in 2018-19. The artists, all based in L.A. but with international careers, are composing new LACO commissions to be premiered by Martín, with Norman inaugurating a three-year project, Spiva completing a trilogy and Contreras named LACO’s 2019-20 Sound Investment composer, a groundbreaking program established 19 years ago to engage audiences in developing a new piece of music. Martín welcomes guest conductors Nicholas McGegan, making his highly anticipated return to LACO’s podium for the first time in 30 years, and dynamic young artist Ruth Reinhardt, assistant conductor of Dallas Symphony. Additionally, Martín appoints critically acclaimed composer and 2019 Pulitzer Prize Winner Ellen Reid to succeed Norman as LACO’s Creative Advisor and Composer-in-Residence. Reid most recently appeared with the Orchestra as the 2017-18 Sound Investment composer. Her breadth of work spans opera, sound design, film scoring and ensemble and choral writing, is one of the most innovative artists of her generation. Her work “brims with canny invention” (LA Weekly) and has been lauded for its “sheer incandescence” (LA Times) and for being “accessible in the best way” (New York Times). Reid will work closely with Martín, playing an important role in LACO’s artistic trajectory over the next three seasons and creating new works for the orchestra on and off the concert hall stage.\n\nMartín extends the reach of LACO’s artistry and programming beyond the concert stage and deep into the community with the announcement of two Artists-In-Residence this season, American composer Missy Mazzoli, whose double bass concerto receives its West Coast premiere, and young British cello virtuoso Sheku Kanneh-Mason, whose 2018 U.S. orchestral debut with LACO was postponed due to his “command performance” at the Royal Wedding, which was viewed by more than one billion people worldwide. As part of his residency, Kanneh-Mason makes his Los Angeles debut at a recital in December 2019, co-presented by LACO and The Colburn School, at downtown L.A.’s Zipper Hall, with his sister, pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason. Sheku Kanneh-Mason is the first black musician to win a BBC Young Musician of the Year award and will perform with orchestras across Europe under the direction of Martín leading up to his LA performances. Mazzoli is one of the most in-demand American composers on the contemporary music scene and draws audiences equally into concert halls, opera houses and rock clubs. She – along with wild Up’s Christopher Rountree – also each curate SESSION performances, which, in partnership with the acclaimed immersive theatre company and design duo Four Larks, explore cutting-edge sounds and challenge traditional concert-going expectations.\n\nMartín introduces a LACO co-commission with the Gävle Symphony Orchestra from Albert Schnelzer, Burn My Letters: Remembering Clara, which was inspired by the legacy of Clara Schumann, a pivotal figure in Romantic music, and offers new perspectives on the woman who was recognized as a pianist in her lifetime but was largely overlooked as a composer. Clara Schumann is also spotlighted in a work by Sarah Gibson, the season’s fourth LACO-commissioned world premiere, presented in the In Focus series. Additionally, Martín leads three of Beethoven’s most revolutionary works, Symphony No. 7, Violin Concerto and Symphony No. 3, “Eroica.” The Orchestra also performs works by Schubert, R. Strauss, Berlioz, Prokofiev, Ravel, Stravinsky and Dvořák.\n\n“I am inspired by Los Angeles and its artistic vibrancy,” says Martín. “As I introduce myself to LACO audiences, I have chosen to create a broad, yet very personally resonant program, and so I am thrilled to be able to present three close musical friends. I have always been in awe of Anne Sofie von Otter’s artistry, and I’m so excited at the chance to work with her in my new musical home with LACO. Christian Tetzlaff and I have played chamber music extensively, and I coached Denis Kozhukhin as a guest lecturer at Madrid’s Reina Sofia School in recent years. Equally as important, I am elated to work with Andrew Norman, Derrick Spiva and Juan Pablo Contreras, artists whose extraordinary relationships with LACO have been so meaningful, to make them part of my first season as Music Director. With other exceptional artists like Nicholas McGegan, Ruth Reinhardt, Jeremy Denk, David Fray, Missy Mazzoli and Sheku Kanneh-Mason performing alongside LACO’s virtuosic players, there will be great musical depth, passion and scope.”\n\nLACO Board President Leslie Lassiter says, “Jaime’s fresh energy is evident in the rich diversity of musical experiences he’s planned for his first season at LACO’s helm. As we welcome him to Los Angeles and launch his tenure as Music Director, we can’t wait to share him with audiences – both those who already know us and those who don’t!”\n\nLACO performs throughout greater Los Angeles in West L.A., Santa Monica, Northridge, Glendale, Pasadena-San Marino, Costa Mesa (Orange County), Santa Barbara and downtown L.A.\n\nORCHESTRAL SERIES DETAILS\n\nThe 2019-20 season launches when Jaime Martín makes his inaugural appearance as LACO Music Director leading the world premiere of Begin, a LACO commission by Andrew Norman who wrote it to mark not only the beginning of Jaime Martin’s tenure but also as the beginning of a concerto he is writing for the Orchestra; Berlioz’ Les nuits d’été, featuring mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter; and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7 on Saturday, September 28, 8 pm, at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, and Sunday, September 29, 2019, 7 pm, at Royce Hall, UCLA.

Chamber Music LA is a collaboration with seven other chamber music presenters in Southern California. Four top-tier post-graduate string musicians from underrepresented communities continue in their second year as the first class of The Los Angeles Orchestra Fellowship, a program designed to increase diversity in American orchestras. Launched in August 2018, the groundbreaking program was conceived by a partnership of Inner City Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles (ICYOLA), the country’s largest African-American-majority youth orchestra; Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra (LACO), one of the world’s leading chamber orchestras; and USC Thornton School of Music, one of the country’s top music programs. Violinist Sydney Adedamola, violinist Ayrton Pisco, violist Bradley Parrimore and cellist Juan-Salvador Carrasco are gaining a 360-degree view of a career as an orchestral musician in this rigorous two-year training program.\n\nJAIME MARTÍN, praised as “a visionary conductor, discerning and meticulous” (Platea Magazine), takes the podium as Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra’s Music Director in the 2019-20 season. Following a prominent career on flute, he turned to conducting full time in 2013 and has since emerged not only as a talented technical conductor but also one with stylistic authenticity who is known for making deep connections to the musicians under his direction. In September 2019, he also becomes Principal Conductor of the RTE National Symphony Orchestra. He has been Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of Gävle Symphony Orchestra since 2013, and his time there has brought the orchestra a new level of international recognition through highly acclaimed recordings and touring performances. Martín is also Artistic Director of the Santander Festival, where over the last five years, he has brought financial stability and created a platform for some of the most exciting artists in their fields, ranging from symphony orchestras and baroque ensembles to education workshops and ballet companies. As conductor, he has worked with an impressive list of orchestras that includes the London Philharmonic, Frankfurt Radio Symphony, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Royal Scottish National, Swedish Radio Symphony, Barcelona Symphony, New Zealand Symphony, Queensland Symphony, Essen Philharmonic, Gulbenkian and Philharmonia Orchestras, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Deutsche Radio Philharmonie, and the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France. Autumn 2018 saw his highly successful debut performances with the London Symphony Orchestra and Christian Tetzlaff in Madrid and London, with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic and Joshua Bell, and with the Colorado Symphony and Pinchas Zukerman. In January 2019, he completed a nine-concert tour of Europe with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, including performances at the Gasteig in Munich and the Cologne Philharmonie. Martín made his conducting debut at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam with the Gävle Symphony in September and, later this season, he will undertake an extensive tour of Switzerland and an appearance at the Prague Spring Festival with Orquestra de Cadaqués. Other future orchestral debuts include engagements with the Melbourne and West Australian Symphony orchestras, Orchestre National de Montpellier, Staatskapelle Halle and Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Martín is recording a series for Ondine Records with the Gävle Symphony Orchestra, which includes the Brahms Serenades, Songs of Destiny, Brahms choral works with the Eric Ericson Chamber Choir, and a recording of the Brahms Piano Quartet, arranged by Schoenberg, which will be released in February 2019. He has also recorded Schubert Symphony No. 9 and Beethoven Symphony No. 3, “Eroica” with Orquestra de Cadaqués and various discs with the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra for Tritó Records. In 2015, he recorded James Horner’s last symphonic work “Collages” for four horns and orchestra with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Martín made his operatic debut conducting The Magic Flute at El Escorial Madrid and San Sebastian Festival in August 2012. His debut at the English National Opera in February 2013 conducting The Barber of Seville led to a return in autumn 2014 to conduct The Marriage of Figaro. As a flautist, Martín was principal flute of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, English National Opera, Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields and London Philharmonic Orchestra. A much sought-after soloist, he made a recording of Mozart flute concertos with Sir Neville Marriner, the premiere recording of Sinfonietta Concerto for Flute and Orchestra written for him by Xavier Montsalvatge and conducted by Gianandrea Noseda, and Bach works for flute, violin and piano with Murray Perahia and Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields for Sony. He was also a founding member of the Orquestra de Cadaqués, and while he has held the title of Chief Conductor with the orchestra since 2012, his association with them has spanned over 30 years. Martin is a Fellow of the Royal College of Music, London, where he was a flute professor. He now enjoys working with many of his former students in orchestras around the world.\n\nLOS ANGELES CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (LACO), ranked among the world’s top musical ensembles, marks an exciting new era in Southern California as it welcomes Jaime Martín in his debut year as Music Director. Martín builds upon LACO’s rich legacy as a preeminent interpreter of historical masterworks and, with eight ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming, a champion of contemporary composers. Headquartered in the heart of the country’s cultural capital, LACO is “more important with each passing year,” (Los Angeles Times), “America’s finest chamber orchestra” (Public Radio International) and “one of the world’s great chamber orchestras” (KUSC Classical FM). Martín’s appearance as LACO’s Music Director Designate in early 2019 was described by the Los Angeles Times, as “a thrilling performance, and the orchestra played like it was having the time of its life,” adding, “he will make fans very quickly.” Overseas, he has been praised as “a visionary conductor, discerning and meticulous” (Platea Magazine), and London’s The Telegraph said, “his infectious enjoyment of the music communicated to the orchestra and audience alike.” The Orchestra has made 32 recordings, including, most recently, a 2019 BIS Records release of works for violin and chamber orchestra that features Concertmaster Margaret Batjer and the world premiere recording of Pierre Jalbert’s Violin Concerto (a LACO co-commission). LACO, with offices located in downtown Los Angeles, has toured Europe, South America and Japan, and performed across North America.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nLACO recognizes the generous support of The Colburn Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Steinway is the official piano of Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.
