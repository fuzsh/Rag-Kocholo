The typical community houses, as those of the Iroquois tribes, were 50 to 100 ft long by 16 to 18 ft wide, with frame of poles and with sides and triangular roof covered with bark, usually of the elm; the interior -was divided into compartments and a smoke hole was left in the roof. A Mahican house, similar in\n\n516\n\nHABITATIONS\n\nform, 14 by 60 ft, had the sides and roof made of rushes and chestnut bark, with an opening along the top of the roof from end to end. The Mandan circular community house was usually about 40 ft in diameter; it was supported by two series of posts and cross-beams, and the wide roof and sloping sides were covered with willow or brush matting and earth. The fireplace was in the center. Morgan thinks that the oblong, round-roof houses of the Virginia and North Carolina tribes, seen and described by Capt. John Smith and drawn by John White, were of the community order. That some of them housed a number of families is distinctly stated. Morgan includes also in the community class the circular, dome-shaped earth lodges of Sacramento valley and the L-form, tent-shaped, thatched lodges of the higher areas of California; but the leading examples of community houses are the large, sometimes massive, manycelled clusters of stone or adobe in New Mexico and Arizona known as pueblos (q. v.). These dwellings vary in form, some of those built in prehistoric times being semicircular, others oblong, around or inclosing a court or plaza. These buildings were constructed usually in terrace form, the lower having a one-story tier of apartments, the next two stories, and so on to the uppermost tier, which sometimes constituted a seventh story. The masonry consisted usually of small, flat stones.laid in adobe mortar and chinked with spalls; but sometimes large balls of adobe were used as building stones, or a double row of wattling was erected and filled in with grout, solidly tamped. By the latter method, known as pisi construction, walls 5 to 7 ft thick were sometimes built (see Adobe, Casa Grande). The outer walls of the lowest story were pierced only by small openings, access to the interior being gained by means of ladders, •which could be drawn up, if necessary, and of a hatchway in the roof. It is possible that some of the elaborate structures of Mexico were developed from such hive-like buildings as those of the typical pueblos, the cells increasing in size toward the S., as suggested by Bandelier. Chimneys appear to have been unknown in North America until after contact of the natives with Europeans, the hatchway in the roof serving the double purpose of entrance and flue. Other forms, some community and others not, are the following: Among the Eskimo, the Jcarmak, or winter residence, for which a pit of the required diameter is dug 5 or 6 ft deep, with a frame of wood or whalebone constructed within 2 or 3 ft above the surface of the ground and covered with a dome-shaped roof of poles or whale ribs, turfed and earthed over.\n\n[B. A. H.\n\nEntrance is gained by an underground passageway. The temporary hunting lodge of the Labrador Eskimo was sometimes constructed entirely of the ribs and vertebrae of the whale. Another form of Eskimo dwellingisthehemispherical snow house, or ight, built of blocks of snow laid in spiral courses. The Kaniagmiut build large permanent houses, called barabarahy the Russians, which accommodate 3 or 4 fami-\n\n=¥**!£.\n\nESKIMO HOUSE, EAST CAPE, SIBERIA.\n\n(NELSON)\n\nlies; these are constructed by digging a square pit 2 ft deep, the sides of which are lined with planks that are carried to the required height above the surface and roofed with boards, poles, or whale ribs, thickly covered with grass; in the roof is a smoke hole, and on the eastern side a door. The Tlingit, Haida, and some other tribes build substantial rectangular houses with sides and ends formed of planks and with the fronts elaborately carved and painted with symbolic figures. Directly in front of the house a totem pole is placed, and near by a memorial pole is erected.\n\nSNOW HOUSE OF CENTRAL ESKIMO. A, FRONT VIEW; B, GROUND PLAN; C, SECTION, (BOAS)\n\nThese houses are sometimes 40 by 100 ft in the Nootkaand Salish region, and are occupied by a number of families. Formerly some of the Haida houses are said to have been built on platforms supported by posts; some of these seen by such early navigators as Vancouver were 25 or 30 ft above ground, access being had by notched logs serving as ladders.

The houses of the California tribes, some of which are above noted, were rectangular or circular; of the latter, some were conical, others dome-shaped. There was\n\nhistoric and early historic times. Another kind of dwelling, in use in Arkansas before the discovery, was a rectangular structure with two rooms in front and one in the rear; the walls were of uprightposts thickly plastered with clay on a sort of wattle.\n\nHOUSE CONSTRUCTION, MOUND WATTLE WORK.\n\nBUILDERS.\n\nPLASTERED\n\n(THOMAS)\n\nWith the exception of the Pueblo structures, buildings of stone or adobe were unknown until recent times.

Somewhat similar structures are erected by the Pueblos as farm shelters, and more elaborate houses of the same general type are built by the Apache of Arizona. As\n\nOsage, and some others were more substantial (see Earth lodge, Grass lodge). The dwellings of the Omaha, according to Miss Fletcher, \"are built by setting carefully selected and prepared posts together in a circle, and binding them firmly with willows, then backing them with dried\n\n••(•'\n\n:\n\nAPACHE HOUSE OF BRUSH AND CANVAS\n\nindicated by archeological researches, the circular wigwam, with sides of bark or mats, built over a shallow excavation in the soil, and with earth thrown against the base, appears to have been the usual form of dwelling in the Ohio valley and the immediate valley of the Mississippi in pre-\n\nNAVAHO HOGAN\n\n0\n\nI, EARTH LODGE\n\ngrass, and covering the entire structure with closely packed sods.

The frame is CHIPPEWA BARK HOUSE) built somewhat in panels formed by ribs and crossbars; these are covered with grass tied on shingle fashion. These grass lodges vary in diameter from 40 to 50 ft. The early Florida houses, according to Le Moyne's illustrations published by De Bry, were either circular with dome-like roof, or oblong with rounded roof like those of Secotan in North Carolina, as shown in John White's figures. The frame was of poles; the sides and roof were covered with bark, or the latter \"was sometimes thatched. TheChippewa usually constructed a conical or hemispherical framework of poles, covered with bark. Formerly caves and rock shelters were used in some sections as abodes, and in the Pueblo region houses were formerly constructed in natural recesses or shelters in the cliffs, whence the designation cliff-dwellings. Similar habitations are still in use to some extent by the Tarahumare of Chihuahua, Mexico. Cavate houses with several rooms werealso hewn in the sides of soft volcanic cliffs; so numerous are these in Verde valley, Arizona, and the Jemez plateau, New Mexico, that for miles the cliff face is honeycombed with them. As a rule the \"women were the builders of 'the houses where wood was the structural material, but the men assisted with the heavier -work. In the Southern states it was a common custom to erect mounds as foundations for\n\n[B. A. 32.\n\ncouncil houses, for the chief's dwelling, or for structures designed for other official uses. The erection of houses, especially those of a permanent character, was usually attended with great ceremony, particularly when the time for dedication came. The construction of the Navaho hogdn, for example, was done in accordance with fixed rules, as was the cutting and sewing of the tipi among the Plains tribes, while the new houses erected during the year were usually dedicated -with ceremony and feasting. Although the better types of houses were symmetrical and well proportioned, their builders had not learned the use of the square or the plumb-line; the unit of measure was also apparently unknown, and even in the best types of ancient Pueblo masonry the joints of the stonework were not '' broken.'' The Indian names for some of their structures, as tipi, MINNESOTA. (GILRLLAN) wigwam, -wickiup, hogan, and iglu, have come into use to a greater or less extent by English-speaking people.

The native and popular name for the Indians of the Queen Charlotte ids., Brit. Col., and the s. end of Prince of Wales id., Alaska, comprising the Skittagetan family (q.v.). By the natives themselves the term may be applied generally to any human being or specifically to one speaking the Haida language. Some authors have improperly restricted the application of the term to the Queen Charlotte islanders, calling the Alaskan Haida, Kaigani (q. v.). Several English variants of this word owe their origin to the fact that a suffix usually accompanies it in the native language, making it Ha/de in one dialect and Haidaga'i in the other. On the ground of physical characteristics the Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian\n\npeoples should be grouped together. Language and social organization indicate still closer affinities between the Haida and Tlingit. According to their own traditions the oldest Haida towns stood on the E. shore, at Naikun and on the broken coast of\n\nHAIDA MAN.\n\n621\n\nHAIDA\n\nBULr,. 30]\n\n(AM.\n\nMUS. NAT. HIST. )\n\nMoresby id. Later a portion of the people moved to the w. coast, and between. 150 and 200 years ago a still larger section, the Xaigani, drove the Tlingit from part of Prince of Wales id. and settled there. Although it is not impossible that the Queen Charlotte ids. were visited by Spaniards during the 17th century, the first certain account of their discovery is that by Ensign Juan Perez, in the corvette Santiago, in 1774. He named the N. point of the islands Cabo de Santa Margarita. Bodega and Maurelle visited them the year after. In 1786 La Perouse coasted the shores of the islands, and the following year Capt. Dixon spent more than a month around them, and the islands are named from his vessel, the Queen Charlotte. After that time scores of vessels from England and New England resorted to the coast, principally to trade for furs, in which business the earlier voyagers reaped golden harvests. The most important expeditions, as those of which there is some record, were by Capt. Douglas, Capt. Jos. Ingraham of Boston, Capt. Etienne Marchand in the French ship Solide, and Capt. Ceo. Vancouver (Dawson, Queen Charlotte Ids., 1880). The advent of whites was, as usual, disastrous to the natives. They were soon stripped of their valuable furs, and, through smallpox and general immorality,\n\nthey have been reduced in the last 60 years to one-tenth of their former strength. A station of the Hudson's Bay Company Avas long established at Masset, but is now no longer remunerative. At Skidegate there are works for the extraction of dogfish oil, which furnish employment to the people during much of the year; but in summer all the Indians from this place and Masset go to the mainland to work in salmon canneries. The Masset people also make many canoes of immense cedars to sell to other coast tribes. The Kaigani still occupy 3 towns, but the population of 2 of them, Kasaan and Klinkwan, is inconsiderable. Neighboring salmon canneries give them work all summer. Mission stations are maintained by the Methodists at Skidegate, by the Church of England at Masset, and by the Presbyterians at Howkan, Alaska. Nearly all of the people are nominally Christians. The Haida, Tlingit, and Tsimshian seem to show greater adaptability to civilization and to display less religious conservatism than many of the tribes farther s. They are generally regarded as superior to them by the white settlers, and they certainly showed themselves such in war and in the arts. Of all peoples of the N. W. coast the Haida were the best carvers, painters, and canoe and house builders, and they still earn considerable money by selling carved objects of wood and slate to traders and\n\nHAIDA WOMAN.\n\nMUS. NAT. HIST.\n\ntourists. Standing in the tribe depended more on the possession of property than on ability in -war, so that considerable interchange of goods took place and the people became sharp traders. The morals of the people were, however, very loose.\n\n522\n\nHAIDA\n\nCanoes were to the people of this coast what the horse became to the Plains Indians. They \"were hollowed out of single logs of cedar, and -were sometimes very large. Houses were built of huge cedar beams and planks which were \"worked out with adzes and wedges made anciently of stone, and put together at great feasts called by the whites by the jargon word \"potlatch\" (q. v.). Each house ordinarily had a single carved pole in the middle of the gable end presented to the beach (see Architecture). Often the end posts in front \"were also carved and the \"whole house front painted. The dead were placed in mortuary houses, in boxes on carved poles, or sometimes in caves. Shamans \"were placed after death in small houses built on prominent points along shore. Among the beliefs of the Haida reincarnation held a prominent place. An estimate of the Haida population made, according to Dawson, by John Work, between 1836 and 1841, gives a total of 8,328, embracing 1,735 Kaigani and 6,593 Queen Charlotte islanders. Dawson estimated the number of people on the Queen Charlotte ids. in 1880 as between 1,700 and 2,000. An estimate made for the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs in 1888 (Ann. Rep., 317) gives 2,500, but the figures were evidently exaggerated, for when a census of Masset, Skidegate, and Gold Harbor was taken the year after (Ann. Rep., 272) it gave only 637. This, however, left out of consideration the people of New Kloo. In 1894 (Ann. Rep., 280), when these were first added to the list, the entire Haida population was found to be 639. The figures for the year following were 593, but from that time showed an increase and stood at 734 in 1902. In 1904, however, they had suffered a sharp decline to 587. Petroff in 1880-81 reported 788 Kaigani, but this figure may be somewhat too high, since Dall about the same time estimated their number at 300. According to the census of 1890 there were 391, and they are now (1905) estimated at 300. The entire Haida population \"would thus seem to be about 900. The Alaskan Haida are called Kaigani. By the Queen Charlotte islanders they are designated Kets-hade (Q.'ets xa/de), which probably means 'people of the strait.' The people of Masset inlet and the N. end of Queen Charlotte ids. generally are called by their southern kinsmen Gao-haidagai (Gfao xa'-ida-ga-i), 'inlet people,' and those living around the southern point of the group are called Gunghet-haidagai {GA.' nxet-xd'-idAga-i), from the name of one of the most southerly capes in their territory. All of these latter finally settled in the town afterward known to whites as Ninstints, and hence came to be called Ninstints people.\n\n[B. A.

The principal chief of the Catawba about the middle of the 18th century, commonly known to the English colonists as King Haiglar. It is probable that he became chief in 1748, as it is stated in Go v. Glenn's letter of May 21, 1751, to the Albany Conference (N. Y. Doc. Col. Hist., vi, 722, 1855), that the Catawba king had died a year and a half before that time. This must refer to Haiglar's predecessor. Haiglar, though disposed to peace, offered his services to the governor of South Carolina when •war with the Cherokee broke out in 1759. He joined Col. Grant's forces and took an active part in the severe battle of\n\n524\n\nfit AIM\n\nHAIR DRESSING\n\nEtchoe (Itseyi), assisting materially in gaining the victory for the whites. He is described as a man of sterling character, just in his dealings and true to his word, acting the part of a father to his people, by whom he was greatly beloved. Seeing that strong drink was injuring them, he sent a written petition to Chief Justice Henley, May 26, 1756, requesting him to put a stop to the sale of spirituous liquors to the members of his tribe. In 1762 the Shawnee waylaid, killed, and scalped him while he was returning from the Waxaw attended by a single servant. Col. Samuel Scott, who was a chief in 1840, and signed the treaty of Mar. 13 in that year with South Carolina, was Haiglar's grandson. (c. T. ) Haim. A body of Salish of Kamloops agency, Brit.

Hainai. A tribe of the Caddo confederacy, otherwise known as Inie, or Ioni. After the Spanish occupancy their village was situated 3 leagues w. of the mission of Nacogdoches, in E. Texas; it contained 80 warriors, the same number assigned to the Hainai by Sibley in 1805, who perhaps obtained his information from the same sources. Sibley places their village 20 m. from Natchitoches, La. In manners, customs, and social organization the Hainai do not appear to have differed from the other tribes of the Caddo confederacy (q. v.), whose subsequent fate they have shared. By Sibley and others they are called \"Tachies or Texas\" (see Texas), as if that term applied to them particularly. The \"great nation called Ayano, or Cannohatinno,\" according to the narrative of the La Salle expedition in 1687, were not the Hainai, as has been sometimes supposed, or any tribe at all, properly speaking. Ayano, or hayano, is merely the Caddo -word for 'people,' while Kano-hatino (q. v.) is the Caddo equivalent for 'Red river,' presumably the same stream now so called. • The Indians simply informed the explorer that many people lived on Red r., a statement -which the French, in their ignorance of the language, construed to contain the definite name and synonym of a powerful tribe.

Hair dressing-. Many tribes had a distinctive mode of cutting and dressing the hair, and the style occasionally suggested the nickname by which the people were called by other tribes, as, for instance, in the case of the Pawnee, who cut the hair close to the head, except a ridge from the forehead to the crown, where the scalp-lock was Sli parted off in a circle, stiffened with fat and paint, made to stand erect, and curved like a horn, hence the name Patvnee, derived from pariki, 'horn.' The same style of shaving the head and roach ing the COMB OF BONE FROM A VIRGINIA hair was common MOUND; ABOUT T. (FOWK'E) among eastern and western tribes, who braided and generally hung the scalp-lock with ornaments. The Dakota and other •western tribes parted the hair in the middle from the forehead to the nape of the neck, the line, usually painted red, being broken by the circle that separated the scalp-lock, which was always finely plaited, the long hair on each side, braided and wrapped in strips of beaver or otter skin, hanging down in front over the chest. The Nez Perces of Idaho and neighboring tribes formerly wore the hair long and unconfined, falling loosely over the back and shoulders. In the S. W. among inost of the Pueblo men the hair was cut short across the forehead, like a \"bang,\" and knotted behind. The Eskimo wore the hair loose.\n\nWit\n\nHAIR DRESSING\n\nBULL. 30]\n\nThere was generally a difference in the manner of wearing the hair between the men and women of a tribe, and in some tribes the women dressed their hair differently before and after marriage, as with the Hopi, whose maidens arranged it in a whorl over each ear, symbolizing the flower of the squash, but after marriage wore it in simple braids. Aside from these ordinary modes of hair dressing there were styles that were totemic and others connected with religious observances or with shamanistic practices. Among the Omaha and some other tribes the child from 4 to 7 years of age formerly had its hair cut in a manner to indicate the totem of its gens; WOODEN COMB AND BIRCHfor instance, if the BARK CASE; HUDSON BAY turtle was the totem, ESKIMO. (TURNER) all the hair was cut off close, except a short fringe encircling the head, a little tuft being left on the forehead, one at the nape of the neck, and two tufts on each side; the bald crown above the fringe represented the shell of the turtle and the tufts its head, tail, and four legs. Generally speaking, the mode of wearing the hair was in former times not subject to passing fancies or fashions, but was representative of tribal kinship and beliefs.\n\nZUNI HAIR-DRESSING.\n\n(STEVENSON)\n\nThe first cutting of the hair was usually attended with religious rites. Among the Kiowa and other southern Plains tribes a lock from the first clipping of the child's hair was tied to the forelock (Mooney). Among many tribes the hair was believed to be closely connected with a person's life. This was true in a religious sense of the scalp-lock. In some of the rituals used -when the hair was first gathered up and cut from the crown of a boy's head the\n\n525\n\nteaching was set forth that this lock represents the life of the child, now placed wholly in the control of the mysterious and supernatural power that alone could will his death. The braided lock worn thereafter was a sign of this dedication and belief, and represented theman'slife. On it he wore the ornaments that marked his achievements and honors, and for anyone to touch lightly this lock was regarded as a grave insult. As a war trophy the scalp-lock had a double meaning. It indicated the act of the supernatural power that had decreed the death of the man, and it served as tangible proof of the warrior's prowess in wresting it fe-\">\" ' -^^t|\\R*& from the enemy. v„ \".„,,•. - -*:,*--.. i/ The scalper, however, was not always the killer or the first striker. WESTERN ESKIMO DRESSING The latter had MAN. (MURDOCH) the chief credit, and frequently left others to do the killing and scalping. With the Eastern or tim ber tribes, the scalper was usually the killer, but this was not so often the case among the Plains Indians. The scalp was frequently left on the battle ground as a sacrifice. Among the Dakota a bit of the captured scalp-lock was preserved for a year, during which period the spirit was supposed to linger near; then, when the great death feast was held, the lock was destroyed and the spirit Avas freed thereby from its earthly ties (see Scalp). There are many beliefs connected with the hair, all of which are interwoven with the idea that it is mysteriously connected with a person's life and fortune. One can be bewitched and made subservient to the will of a person who becomes possessed of a bit of his hair; conseOF SEMINOLE MAN. quently combings are HEAD (MACCAULEY) usually carefully burned. Accordingto Hrdlicka the Pima, after killing an Apache, purified themselves with smoke from the burnt hair of the victim. Personal joy or grief was manifested by the style of dressing the hair (see Mourning). Young men often spend much time over their locks, friends assisting friends in the toilet. The Pueblo and Plains tribes commonly used a stiff brush of spear grass for combing and dressing the hair, while the Eskimo and the JST. W. coast tribes used combs. A pointed\n\n526\n\nHAIBWORK-\n\nstick served for parting it and painting theline. These sticks were often carefully wrought, ornamented with embroidery on the handle, and kept in an embroidered case. Perfumes, as well as oils, were used,and wisps of sweet-grass were concealed in the hair of young men to add to their attractions. The Pima and Papago paint or stain the hair when it becomes bleached by the sun (Hrdlicka in Am. Anthrop., vni, no. 1, 1906), and the former, as well as other tribes of the arid region, often coated the hair completely with river mud to destroy vermin. Early French travelers in Texas and other Southern states mention a custom of the hostess to hasten to wash the head of a visitor Avith warm water, as a sign of good will and welcome. Among the Pueblo Indians the washing of the hair with the pounded root of the yucca plant prior to a religious rite was attended with much ceremony, and seems to correspond to the purification observances of the sweat lodge, which always preceded sacred rites among the tribes of the plains. See Adornment. (A. C. F. ) Hairwork. One of the most useful materials known to the Indians of the United States was hair, which, as a textile material, was generally more available than vegetal fibers. Hair was obtained from the dog, buffalo, mountain sheep, mountain goat, moose, deer, reindeer, elk, antelope, opossum, rabbit, beaver, otter, lynx, and other animals, and human hair was also sometimes employed. In more modern times horsehair was used to stuff balls, drumsticks, dolls, pads, pillows, etc., and tufts of it, frequently dyed, were attached as ornaments to costumes, pouches, harness, ceremonial objects, etc. False hair was -worn by the Crows, Assiniboin, Mandan, Mohave, and Yuma; and ceremonial wigs of black wool and bangs of natural or dyed hair, especially horsehair, were made by the Pueblos. Twisted or sometimes braided into cord, hair had a most extensive use, satisfying the multifarious demands for string or rope of great tensile strength, and was combined With other fibers in the warp or weft of textiles and basketry. According to Grinnell cowskin pads stuffed with the hair of elk, antelope, buffalo, or mountain sheep were commonly used instead of saddles by some of the Plains tribes in running buffalo and in war. Bourke (9th Rep. B. A. E., 474, 1892) says that mantles made of votive hair are mentioned as having been in use among the Lower California or southern California tribes in the 18th century, and quotes Parkman (Jesuits in North America, lxxxiv, 1867) to the effect that the Algonquians believed in a female manito who wore a robe made of the hair of her\n\n-HAIF KING\n\n[B.

See MStis, Mixed-bloods. Half King (Scruniyatha, Seruniyattha, Tanacharison, Tannghrishon, etc.). An Oneida chief; born about 1700; died at the house of John Harris, at the site of Harrisburg, Pa., Oct. 4, 1754. He appears to have first come into notice about 1748, at which time he lived at or in the vicinity of Logstown, Pa. (q. v.). According to some statements his residence was in this village, but according to others it was on Little Beaver cr., about 15 m. distant. It was to Half King that most of the official visitors to the Indians of the Ohio region, including Weiser, Gist, Croghan, and Washington, applied for information, advice, and assistance, Logstown being their stopping place for this purpose. He accompanied Washington both on his journey of 1753 and on his expedition of 1754.\n\nBULL. 30]\n\nHALF KING\n\nHalf King claimed that he killed Jumonville, the French officer, during the skirmish at Great Meadows, Pa., May 28, 1754, in revenge of the French, who, he declared, had killed, boiled, and eaten his father; and it was he who had advised Ensign Ward, when summoned by Contracoeur, the French officer, to surrender Ft Necessity, at the site of Pittsburg, Pa., to reply that his rank did not invest him with power to do so, thus obtaining delay. Half King was a prominent figure on the Indian side in the treaty with the Virginia commissioners in 1752, and for this and other services was decorated by Gov. Dinwiddie and given the honorary name \"Dinwiddie,\" which, it is said, he adopted with pride. On the advice of Croghan, he with other Indians removed to Aughquick (Oquaga) cr., Pa., in 1754. Half King has been confused with the Huron Half King of Sandusky, Ohio, known also as Pomoacan, and with his own successor, who bore the same popular title. His Delaware name was Monakatuatha. See Drake, Aborig. Races, 531,1880; Rupp, Hist. West. Pa., 71, 1846; Dinwiddie Papers, i, 148, 1883; Col. Records Pa., v, 358, 1851. (c. T.) Half King (Petawontakas, Dunquad, Dunquat, Daunghquat; Delaware name, Pomoacan). A Huron chief of Sandusky, Ohio, who flourished during the latter part of the Revolutionary war. Under employment by the British he aided the Delawares in their resistance to the encroachment of the white settlements beyond the Allegheny mts., and it was through his intervention that the Moravians of Lichtenau were saved from massacre by the Indians in 1777. According to Loskiel (Missions United Brethren, pt. 3, 127, 1794) he was joined by a large number of warriors, including Hurons, Ottawa, Chippewa, Shawnee, and others, besides some French, and his influence as a disciplinarian was such that he kept this mixed assemblage in good order, permitting no extravagance on their part. Sometimes more than 200 warriors lay all nightcloseto Lichtenau, but they behaved so quietly that they were hardly perceived. Loskiel also says that Half King \"was particularly attentive to prevent all drunkenness, knowing that bloodshed and murder would immediately follow.\" He insisted on the removal of the Christian Indians from the vicinity of Sandusky, believing it to be unsafe for them to remain there; he also protected the Moravians and their converts from maltreatment when the missionaries were sent to Detroit. Under the name Daunghquat he signed the treaty of Ft Mclntosh, Ohio, Jan. 21, 1785. The treaties of Greenville, Ohio, Aug. 3, 1795; Ft Mclntosh, July 4, 1805; Greenville, July\n\nHALONA\n\n527\n\n22, 1814, and Spring Wells, Sept. 8, 1815, were signed by Haroenyou (Harrowenyou), his son, not by himself; but the name \" Dunquad or Half King\" is appended to the treaty of Miami Rapids, Ohio, Sept. 29, 1817.

Halona {Hdlona 1'tiwana, 'middle place of happy fortune', 'middle ant-hill of the world', 'the ant-hill at the navel of the Earth Mother.'—Cushing). A former pueblo of the Zuni and one of the Seven Cities of Cibola of the early Spanish chroniclers, said to have been situated on both sides of Zuili r., on and opposite the site of the present Zuni pueblo, w. N. Mex. Only the mound on the s. side of the stream is now traceable, and a part of this is occupied by modern buildings erected by white people. While there seems to be no question that Halona was inhabited by the Zufii at the time of Coronado in 1540, it was not mentioned by name until Nov. 9, 1598, when the Zufii made a vow of obedience and vassalage to Spain at Hawikuh, Halona being designated as Halonagu (Ilcdonakwin,' Halona-place'). A Franciscan mission was established there in 1629, but the murder by the Zuni of their missionary in 1632 impelled the Indians to flee for protection to Thunder mtn., a mesa 3 m. away, where they remained for about 3 years. The mission was rehabilitated some time after 1643, and continued until the Pueblo outbreak of Aug., 1680, when the Zuni murdered Fray Juan de Bal, the Halona missionary, and burned the church. The Zufii again fled to Thunder mtn., where they remained until after the reconquest by Diego de Vargas in 1692. Meanwhile the pueblos in the valley, including Halona, had fallen in decay, and none of them was rebuilt. The present village of Zufii was reared on the N. bank of Zuni r., partly on the site of Halona, about the close of the 17th century. The population of Halona at the time of the revolt of 1680 was about 1,500, and Matsaki and Kiakima were visitas of its mission. See Bancroft, Ariz, and N. Mex., 1889; Bandelier (1) Doc. Hist.

Few implements are of so much importance to primitive men as the stone hammer and the several closely allied forms—the sledge, the maul, and the stone-head club, which may be described here rather than under the caption Clubs- All of these implements are employed, like the ordinary club, in striking blows that stun, break, crush, or drive, the only distinction to be drawn between\n\n-HAMMEES\n\n[B.

All are made of hard, heavy, tough materials, including stone, bone, ivory, antler, shell, and metal. Some are never hafted, while perhaps nearly all on occasion are used unhafted, one or both hands being employed accord^OFing to the weight of the implement. Haftings vary with the form and use of the object as well as with the region and the people. PITTED HAMMER Hammers employed in shaping stone, especially in the more advanced stages of the work, are usually unhafted and are held tightly in the hand for delivering heavy blows, or lightly between the thumb and fingertips for flaking or pecking. They may be natural pebbles, bowld ers, or fragments, but by prolonged use\n\nml\n\n..•j- •-,- .Ti>-.\" .-•-/ :&%i&^t$posed early occupancy by them. Their present village, composed of temporary cabins or shelters of wattled canes and branches and earth in summer, and of the natural caves and crevices in winter, is situated 115 m. N. of Prescott and 7 m. s. of the Grand canyon. The Havasupai are well formed, though of medium stature. They are skilled in the manufacture and use of implements, and especially in preparing raw material, like buckskin. The men are expert hunters, the women adept in the manufacture of baskets which, when lined with clay, serve also as cooking utensils. Like the other Yuman tribes, until affected by white influences during recentyears, their clothing consisted chiefly of deerskin and, for the sake of ornament, both men and women painted their faces with thick, smooth coatings of fine red ocher or blue paint prepared from wild indigo; tattooing and scarification for ornament were also sometimes practised. In summer they subsist chiefly on corn, calabashes, sunflower seeds, melons, peaches, and apricots, which they cultivate by means of irrigation, and also the wild datila and mescal, in winter principally upon the flesh of game, which they hunt in the surrounding uplands and mountains. While a strictly sedentary people, they are unskilled in the manufacture of earthen-ware and obtain their more modern implements and utensils, except basketry, by barter with the Hopi, with which people they seem always to have had closer affiliation than with their Yuman kindred. Their weapons in war and the chase were rude clubs and pikes of hard wood, bows and arrows, and, formerly, slings; but firearms have practically replaced these more\n\n[B. A. B.\n\nprimitive appliances. The gentile system of descent or organization seems to be absent among the Havasupai, their society consanguineally being patriarchal. They are polygamists, the number of wives a man shall have being limited apparently only by his means for supporting them. Betrothals by purchase are common, and divorces are granted only on the ground of unfaithfulness. The Havasupai occupy a reservation of about 38,400 acres, set aside by Executive order in 1880 and 1882. Their population was 300 in 1869, 233 in 1902, 174 in 1905. (H. W. H.)

A former Dieguefio rancheria under the Dominican mission of San Miguel de la Frontera, w. coast of Dower California, about 30 m. s. of San Diego, Cal. (A. S. G.) Hawaiian influence. The establishment of the whale and seal fisheries of the N. Pacific coast led to the presence in that region of sailors and adventurers of the most diverse races and nationalities, many of whom came into more or less lasting contact with the natives of the country. Toward the middle of the 19th century (Hale, Oregon Trade Danguage, 19, 1890) the Hawaiian language was spoken by about 100 Sandwich Islanders employed as laborers about Ft Vancouver, Wash. Doubtless some intermixture of these with the Indians took place. In 1891 there lived among the Kutenai an Indian nicknamed Xanaka. Murdoch (9th Hep. B. A. E., 55, 1892) notes that several Hawaiian words have crept into the jargon as used by the western Eskimo and white whalers and traders who come into contact with them, and one or two of these words have even come to be employed by the Pt Barrow Eskimo among themselves; but there is no evidence that the Chinook jargon contains a Hawaiian element. Swanton suggests that it is barely possible that the Haida custom of tattooing may have come from some Polynesian island, as its introduction is always said by the natives to be recent. Whether the idea of a ladder made of a chain of arrows, which occurs among the myths of Polynesians and the people of the N. W. coast, could have had a similar origin may be doubted, but it is nevertheless possible. The theory of Polynesian-American contact has been maintained by Ratzel, Schultz, and others, stress being laid on resemblances in art as exemplified by clubs, masks, etc., and in other ways. (A. F. c.)\n\nHAWIKUH\n\n539\n\nHawikuh (haioe 'leaves', wiku 'gum'). A former pueblo of the Zuiii and one of the Seven Cities of Cibola of early Spanish times, situated about 15 in. s. w. of the present Zuiii pueblo, N. Mex., near the summer village of OjoCaliente. Hawikuh was seen in 1539 by Fray Marcos de Niza, •who viewed it from an adjacent height a few clays after the murder, by the Zuiii of Hawikuh, of Estevanico, the former negro companion of Cabeza de Vaca. Fray Marcos referred to it by the name of Ahacus. In the following year Francisco Vasquez Coronado visited the pueblo with his advance guard, and as its inhabitants offered resistance, the village was stormed and captured, most of its people fleeing for safety to Taaiyalone, a mesa E. of the present Zuiii. Coronado referred to Hawikuh, under the name Granada, as the chief pueblo of Cibola, containing about 200 houses, and from there wrote his account of the journey to the viceroy Mendoza, Aug. 15, 3 540. A Franciscan mission was established at Hawikuh in 1629, at which time the pueblo contained about 110 houses. Owing to Navaho or Apache depredations in Oct., 1670, when many of the Zuni as well as the missionary of Hawikuh were killed, the pueblo was abandoned and never afterward permanently occupied. It is said that the roof timbers of the old church at Zuiii, which was erected about 1705, were those used previously in the Hawikuh chapel. A portion of the adobe walls of the latter building were still standing until about 1894, when the adobes were taken by the Indians to Ojo Caliente and there used in the construction of new houses.

There is little evidence to show what diseases prevailed among the Indians N. of Mexico prior to the advent of white people. The traditions of the Indians, the existence among them of elaborate healing rites of undoubtedly ancient origin, their plantlore, in which curative properties are attributed to many vegetal substances, and the presence among them of a numerous class of professed healers, honored, feared, and usually well paid, would seem to indicate that diseases were not rare, but actual knowledge and even tradition as to their nature are wanting. The condition of the skeletal remains, the testimony of early observers, and the present state of some of the tribes in this regard, warrant the conclusion that on the whole the Indian race was a comparatively healthy one. It was probably spared at least some of the epidemics and diseases of the Old World, such as smallpox and rachitis, while other scourges, such as tuberculosis, syphilis (precolumbian), typhus, cholera, scarlet fever, cancer, etc., were rare, if occurring at all. Taking into consideration the warlike nature of many of the tribes and the evidence presented by their bones (especially the skulls), injuries, etc., particularly those received by offensive weapons, must have been common, although fractures are less frequent than among white people.\n\n[B.\n\nA. H.\n\nAt the time of the discovery the Indians on the whole were probably slowly increasing in numbers. Frequent wars, however, had a marked effect in limiting this increase. Since their contact with whites most of the tribes have gradually diminished in strength, while some of the smaller tribes have disappeared entirely. Very few tribes have shown an increase or even maintained their former numbers. The most remarkable example of steady gain is the Navaho tribe. The causes of decrease were the introduction of diseases (particularly smallpox), the spread of alcoholism, syphilis, and especially tuberculosis, destructive wars with the whites, and increased mortality due to changes in the habits of the people through the encroachment of civilization. During recent years a slow augmentation in population has been noticed among a number of tribes, and as more attention is paid to the hygienic conditions of the Indians, an increase comparable to that in whites may be expected in many sections. The least hopeful conditions in this respect prevail among the Dakota and other tribes of the colder northern regions, where pulmonary tuberculosis and scrofula are very common. (See Population.) While preserving much of their robust constitution, the Indians—particularly those of mixed blood—are at present subject to many disorders and diseases known to the whites, although the pure bloods are still free from most of the serious morbid conditions and tendencies due to defective inheritance. They suffer little from insanity, idiocy, and rachitis. Cretinism is exceedingly rare, and general paresis, with a large number of serious nervous affections, has not yet been recorded among them. Diseases of the heart, arteries, and veins, serious affection of the liver and kidneys, as well as typhoid and scarlet fever are infrequent. Congenital malformations are very rare, although it is commonly heard among the Indians themselves that they do sometimes occur, but that the afflicted infants are not allowed to live. Fractures, and diseases of the bones in general, as well as dental caries, are less frequent than among the \"whites. There is considerable doubt whether cancer occurs in any form. Venereal diseases, while predominant among the more degraded Indians, are more or less effectually guarded against by others. The most common disorders of health now experienced among Indians generally are those' of the gastro-intestinal tract, which in infancy are due to improper feeding and particularly to the univei'sal consumption of raw, unripe fruit and vegetables, and in later life to the lack of or overindulgence in food,\n\nBULL,. 30]\n\nHEA8HKOWA-\n\nirregular meals, the preference for fat, crudely prepared food, and, recently, the misuse of inferior baking powders and excessive use of coffee. While most of the disorders thus introduced are of a minor character, others, particularly in infants, are frequently fatal. Other more common diseases are various forms of malaria, bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy, and. measles in the young. Whooping cough is also met with. Inflammation of the conjunctivas is common and often leads to ulceration, opacity, and defect in or even total loss of vision. Defective hearing is occasionally found in the aged, and there are rare instances- of deaf mutes. Eczema, favus, and acna3 are among the more ordinary affections of the skin. Tuberculosis of the lungs, and glandular tuberculosis, or scrofula, are frequent in many localities and are especially common among the reservation Indians in the colder parts of the United States, particularly in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana, due to their present mode of life. They live in small, insanitary hovels, which in cold weather are ill ventilated and often overheated and crowded, while their dress is heavier than formerly, their daily life less active, their food changed, and, what is most important, there is complete ignorance of the contagious nature of consumption. Some of these conditions, however, are being gradually bettered. Goiter is widely distributed, though seldom prevalent; it is found particularly among some bands of the Sioux, and it occurs also with some frequency among the Menoininee, Oneida, Crows, and White Mountain Apache. Albinism occurs among a number of the tribes; the cases, however, are quite isolated, except among the Hopi and to a lesser degree the Zufii. In 1903 there were 12 cases of albinism in the former and 4 in the latter tribe, all of the complete variety. Vitiligo is much more scattered, but the cases are few. Diseases and functional disturbances peculiar to women, including those of the puerperium, are much less common among Indians than among the white women of this country. Of diseases peculiar to old age, senile arthritis, which affects particularly the spine, and occasional dementia, are found. Senility proceeds slowly in the pure-blood Indian, and the number of individuals above 80 years of age, according to census returns (which, however, should be regarded with caution), is relatively greater than among the whites.

The singular Irinkowi, with the French suffix -ois, has become the familiar \"Iroquois.\" The term Nadowe in various forms (e. g., Nottaway) was applied by the Algonquian tribes generally' to all alien and hostile peoples. Champlain also called the Hurons Ochcdeguin and Charioquois, from the names of prominent chiefs. The Delawares called them Talamcdan, while the peoples of the \"Neutral Nation\" and of the Huron tribes applied to each other the term Attiwendaronk, literally, 'their speech is awry,' butfreely, 'they are stammerers,' referring facetiously to the dialectic difference between the tongues of the two peoples. In 1615 Champlain found all the tribes which he later called Hurons, with the exception of the Wenrohronon and the Atontrataronon, dwelling in Huronia and -waging war against the Iroquois tribes in New York. When Cartier explored the St Lawrence valley, in 1534-43,\n\n586\n\nHURON\n\nIroquoian tribes occupied the N. bank of the river indefinitely northward and from Saguenay r. eastward to Georgian bay, with no intrusive alien bands (despite the subsequent but doubtful claim of the Onontchataronon to a former possession of the island of Montreal), and also the s. watershed from the Bay of Gaspe w. to the contiguous territory of the Iroquois confederation on the line of the E. watershed of L. Champlain. The known names of towns of these Eaurentian Iroquois are Araste, Hagonchenda, Hochelaga, Hochelay, Satadin, Stadacona, Starnatan, Tail la, Teguenondahi, and Tutonaguy. But Cartier, in speaking, of the people of Hochelaga, remarks: \"Notwithstanding, the said Canadians are subject to them with eight or nine other peoples who are on the said river.\" All these towns and villages were abandoned previous to the arrival of Champlain on the St Lawrence in 1603. Of the towns of the Hurons, Sagard says: \"There are about 20 or 25 towns and villages, of which some are not at all shut, nor closed [palisaded], and others are fortified with long pieces of timber in triple ranks, interlaced one with another to the height of a long pike [16 ft], and reenf orced on the inside with broad, coarse strips of bark, 8 or 9 ft in height; below there are large trees, with their branches lopped off, laid lengthwise on very short trunks of trees, forked at one.end, to keep them in place; then above these stakes and bulwarks there are galleries or platforms, called ondaqua ( 'box ' ), which are furnished with stones to be hurled against an enemy in time of war, and with water to extinguish any fire -which might be kindled against them. Pei'sons ascend to these by means of ladders quite poorly made and difficult, which are made of long pieces of timber wrought by many hatchet strokes to hold the foot firm in ascending.'' Champlain says that these palisades were 35 ft in height. In accord with the latter authority, Sagard says that these towns were in a measure permanent, and were removed to new sites only when they became too distant from fuel and when their fields, for lack of manuring, became \"worn out, which occurred every 10, 20, 30, or 40 years, more or less, according to the situation of the country, the richness of the soil, and the distance of the forest, in the middle of which they always built their towns and villages. Champlain says the Hurons planted large quantities of several kinds of corn, which grew finely, squashes, tobacco, many varieties of beans, and sunflowers, and that from the seeds of the last they extracted an oil with which they anointed their heads and employed for various other purposes.\n\n[B. A. E.\n\nThe government of these tribes was vested by law in a definite number of executive officers, called \"chiefs\" (q. v.) in English, who were chosen by the suffrage of the child-bearing women and organized by law or council decree into councils for legislative and judicial purposes. There were five units in the social and political organization of these tribes, namely, the family, clan, phratry, tribe, and confederation, which severally expressed their will through councils coordinate with their several jurisdictions and which made necessary various grades of chiefs in civil affairs. In these communities the civil affairs of government were entirely differentiated from the military, the former being exercised by civil officers, the latter by military officers. It sometimes happened that the same person performed the one or the other kind of function, but to do so he must temporarily resign his civil authority should it be incumbent on him to engage in military affairs, and when this emergency was past he would resume his civil function or authority. In almost every family one or more chiefship titles, known by particular names, -were hereditary, and there might even be two or three different grades of chiefs therein. But the candidate for the incumbency of any one of these dignities was chosen only by the suffrage of the mothers among the women of his family. The selection of the candidate thus made was then submitted for confirmation to the clan council, then to the tribal council, and lastly to the great federal council composed of the accredited delegates from the various allied tribes. The tribes composing the Hurons recognized and enforced, among others, the rights of ownership and inheritance of property and dignities, of liberty and security of person, in names, of marriage, in personal adornment, of hunting and fishing in specified territory, of precedence in migration and encampment and in the council room, and rights of religion and of the blood feud. They regarded theft, adultery, maiming, sorcery with evil intent, treason, and the murder of a kinsman or a co-tribesman as crimes which consisted solely in the violation of the rights of a kinsman by blood or adoption, for the alien had no rights which Indian justice and equity recognized, unless by treaty or solemn coin pact. If an assassination were committed or a solemnly sworn peace with another people violated by the caprice of an individual, it was not the rule to punish directly the guilty person, for this would have been to assume over him a jurisdiction which no one \"would think of claiming; on the contrary, presents de-\n\nBULL. 30]\n\nHUBON\n\nsigned to '' cover the death \" or to restore peace were offered to the aggrieved party by the offender and his kindred. The greatest punishment that could be inflicted on a guilty person by his kindred was to refuse to defend him, thus placing him outside the rights of the blood feud and allowing those whom, he had offended the liberty to take vengeance on him, but at their own risk and peril. The religion of these tribes consisted in the worship of all material objects, the elements and bodies of nature, and many creatures of a teeming fancy, which in their view directly or remotely affected or controlled their well-being. These objects of their faith and worship were regarded as man-beings or anthropic persons possessed of life, volition, and orenda (q. v.) or magic power of different kind and degree peculiar to each. In this religion ethics or morals as such received only a secondary, if any, consideration. The status and interrelations of the persons of their pantheon one to another were fixed and governed \"by rules and customs assumed to be similar to those of the social and the political organization of the people, and so there was, therefore, at least among the principal gods, a kinship system patterned after that of the people themselves. They expressed their public religious worship in elaborate ceremonies performed at stated annual festivals, lasting from a day to fifteen days, and governed by the change of seasons. Besides the stated gatherings there, were many minor meetings, in all of which there were dancing and thanksgiving for the blessings of life. They believed in a life hereafter, which was but a reflex of the present life, but their ideas regarding it were not very definite. The bodies of the dead were wrapped in furs, neatly covered with flexible bark, and then placed on a platform resting on four pillars, which was then entirely covered with bark; or the body, after being prepared for burial, was placed in a grave and over it were laid small pieces of timber, covered with strong pieces of bark and then with earth. Over the grave a cabin was usually erected. At the great feast of the dead, which occurred at intervals of 8 or 10 years, the bodies of those who had died in the interim, from all the villages participating in the feast, were brought together and buried in a common grave with elaborate and solemn public ceremonies. In 1615, \"when the Hurons were first visited by the French under Champlain, he estimated from the statements of the Indians themselves that they numbered 30,000, distributed in 18 towns and villages, of which 8 were palisaded; but in a subsequent edition of his work Cham-\n\n587\n\nplain reduces this estimate to 20,000. A little later Sagard estimated their population at 30,000, while Brebeuf gave their number as 35,000. But these figures are evidently only guesses and perhaps much above rather than below the actual population, which, in 1648, was probably not far from 20,000. When the French established trading posts on the St Lawrence at Three Rivers and elsewhere, the Hurons and neighboring tribes made annual trips down Ottawa r. or down the Trent to these posts for the purpose of trading both with the Europeans and with the Montagnais of the lower St Lawrence who came up to meet them. The chief place of trade at this time was, according to Sagard (Histoire, i, 170, 1866), in the harbor of Cape Victory, in L. St Peter of St Lawrence r., about 50 miles below Montreal, just above the outlet of the lake, where, on Sagard's arrival, there were \"already lodged a great number of savages of various nations for the trade of beavers with the French. The Indians who \"were not sectarians in religion invited the missionaries into their country. In 1615 the Recollect fathers accepted the invitation, and Father Le Caron spent the year 161516 in Huronia, and was again there in 1623—24. Father Poulain -was among the Hurons in 1622, Father Viel from 1623 to 1625, and Father De la Roche Daillion in 1626-28. The labors of the Jesuits began with the advent of Father Brebeuf in Huronia in 1626, but their missions ended in 1650 with the destruction of the Huron commonwealth by the Iroquois. In all, 4 Recollect and 25 Jesuit fathers had labored in the Huron mission during its existence, which at its prime was the most important in the French dominions in North America. As the first historian of the mission, Fr. Sagard, though not a priest, deserves honorable mention. From the Jesuit Relation for 1640 it is learned that the Hurons had had cruel wars with the Tionontati, but that at the date given they had recently made peace, renewed their former friendship, and entered into an alliance against their common enemies. Sagard is authority for the statement that the Hurons were in the habit of sending large war parties to ravage the country of the Iroquois. The well-known hostility and intermittent warfare between the Iroquois and the Huron tribes date f roin prehistoric times, so that the invasion and destruction of the Huron country and confederation in 1648-50 by the Iroquois were not a sudden, unprovoked attack, but the final blow in a struggle which was already in progress when the French under Cartier in 1535 first explored the St Lawrence. The acquirement of firearms by the Iro-\n\n588\n\nHURON\n\nquois from the Dutch, was an important factor in their subsequent successes. By 1643 they had obtained about 400 guns, while, on the other hand, as late as the final invasion of their country the Hurons had but very few guns, a lack that was the direct cause of their feeble resistance and the final conquest by the Iroquois confederation of half of the country E. of the Mississippi and sr. of the Ohio. In July, 1648, having perfected their plans for the final struggle for supremacy with the Hurons, the Iroquois began open hostility by sacking two or three frontier towns and Teanaustayae (St Joseph), the major portion of the invading warriors wintering in the Huron country unknown to the Hurons; and in March, 1649, these Iroquois warriors destroyed Taenhatentaron (St Ignace) and St Louis, and carried into captivity hundreds of Hurons. These disasters completely demoralized and disorganized the Huron tribes, for the greater portion of their people were killed or led into captivity among the several Iroquoian tribes, or perished from hunger and exposure in their precipitate flight in all directions, while of the remainder some escaped to the Neutral Nation, or '' Hurons de la Nation Neutre,\" some to the Tobacco or Tionontati tribe, some to the Erie, and others to the French settlements near Quebec on the island of Orleans. The Tohontaenrat, forming the populous town of Scanonaenrat, and a portion of the Arendahronon of the town of St-Jean-Baptiste surrendered to the Seneca and were adopted by them with the privilege of occupying a village by themselves, which was named Gandougarae (St Michel). As soon as the Iroquois learned of the Huron colony on Orleans id., they at once sought to persuade these Hurons to migrate to their country. Of these the Bear people, together with the Bowl band and the Rock people, having in an evil day promised to remove thither, were finally, in 1656, compelled to choose between fighting and migrating to the Iroquois country. They chose the latter course, the Bear people going to the Mohawk and the Rock people to the Onondaga. The Cord people alone had the courage to remain with the French. The adopted inhabitants of the new town of St Michel (Gandougarae) were mostlj' Christian Hurons who preserved their faith under adverse conditions, as did a large number of other Huron captives who were adopted into other Iroquois tribes. In 1653 Father Le Moine found more than 1,000 Christian Hurons among the Onondaga. The number of Hurons then among the Mohawk, Oneida, and Cayuga is not known. Among the most unfortunate of the\n\n[B. A. E.\n\nHuron fugitives were those who sought asylum among the Erie, where their presence excited the jealousy and perhaps the fear of their neighbors, the Iroquois, with •whom the Ei-ie did not fraternize. It is also claimed that the Huron fugitives strove to foment war between their protectors and the Iroquois, with the result that notwithstanding the reputed 4,000 warriors of the Erie and their skill in the use of the bow and arrow (permitting them dextrously to shoot 8 or 9 arrows while the enemy could fire an arquebus but once), the Erie and the unfortunate Huron fugitives were entirely defeated in 1653—56 and dispersed or carried away into captivity. But most pathetic and cruel •was the fate of those unfortunate Hurons who, trusting in the long-standing neutrality of the Neutral Nation which the Iroquois had not theretofore violated, fled to that tribe, only to be held, with the other portion of the Huron people still remaining in their country, into harsh captivity^ (Jes. Rel. 1659-60). A portion of the defeated Hurons escaped to the Tionontati or '' Huron du Petun,\" then dwelling directly westward from them. But in 1649, when the Iroquois had sacked one of the Tionontati palisaded towns, the remainder of the tribe, in company with the refugee Hurons, sought an asylum on the Island of St Joseph, the present Charity or Christian id., in Georgian bay. It is this group of refugees who became the AVyandots of later history. Finding that this place did not secure them from the Iroquois, the majority fled to Michilimakinac, Mich., near which place they found fertile lands, good hunting, and abundant fishing. But even here the Iroquois would not permit, them to rest, so they retreated farther westward to Manitoulin id., called Ekaentoton by the Hurons. Thence they were driven to He Huronne (Potawatomi id., because formerly occupied by that tribe), at the entrance to Green bay, Wis., where the Ottawa and their allies from Saginaw bay and Thunder bay, Manitoulin, and Michilimakinac, sought shelter with them. From this point the fugitive Hurons, with some of the Ottawa and their allies, moved farther westward 7 or 8 leagues to the Pota"
