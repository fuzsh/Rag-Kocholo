        "text": "List of Choctaw Treaties is a comprehensive chronological list of historic agreements that directly or indirectly affected the Choctaw people, a Native American tribe, with other nations. Choctaw land was systematically obtained through treaties, legislation, and threats of warfare. Treaties were made with Great Britain, France, and Spain. Nine treaties were signed with the United States.[1] Some treaties, like the Treaty of San Lorenzo, indirectly affected the Choctaws.\n\nThe Choctaws considered European laws and diplomacy foreign and puzzling. The most confusing aspect of treaty making was writing which was impressive for a people who had not developed a written system. Choctaw history, as with many Native Americans, was passed orally from generation to generation. European cultural conventions require written treaties to prevent disputes about the contents of the agreement and to enable wider dissemination through copying. During treaty negotiations the three main Choctaw tribal areas (Upper Towns, Six town, and Lower Towns) had a \"Miko\" (chief) to represent them. Spain had the earliest claims to Choctaw country which was followed by French claims starting in the late 17th century. The United States, following the Treaty of San Lorenzo, laid claim to Choctaw country starting in 1795.\n\nBy the early 19th century pressure from U.S. southern states, like Georgia, encouraged the procurement of Native American lands. The Treaty of Fort Adams was the first in a series of treaties that ceded Choctaw lands. The Choctaws were relocated from their homeland, now known as the Deep South, to lands west of the Mississippi River. Approximately 15,000 Choctaws made the move to what would be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma.[2] About 2,500 died along the trail of tears. The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek required the Choctaws to sign away the remaining traditional homeland to the United States. There would be three waves of removals starting in 1831. After the final wave of removal in 1833, nearly 6,000 Choctaws chose to stay in the newly formed state of Mississippi. Despite the grant of citizenship and land to Choctaws that chose to stay, the newly settled European-Americans persistently urged the Mississippi Choctaws to remove, but they refused. Although smaller Choctaw groups can be found throughout the U.S. south, Choctaws are mainly found in Florida, Oklahoma and Mississippi.\n\nTreaties\n\n[edit]\n\nTreaty Year Signed with Location Purpose Ceded Land Charleston 1738 Great Britain Charleston, SC Trade and Alliance n/a Mobile 1749 France Mobile, AL Trade and Alliance n/a Grandpre 1750 France Choctaw Nation Ended Choctaw Civil War n/a Augusta 1763 Georgia Augusta, GA Established \"Indian/White\" boundaries n/a Mobile 1783 Great Britain Mobile, AL Land Cession, Boundaries defined n/a Mobile 1783 Spain Mobile, AL Trade and Alliance n/a Charleston 1783 Great Britain Charleston, SC Trade and Amity n/a Pensacola 1784 Spain Pensacola, FL Trade and Alliance n/a Hopewell 1786 United States Hopwell, SC U.S. to serve as protectorate, Choctaw Nation boundaries defined n/a Natchez 1792 Spain Natchez Peace, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Cherokees Nations boundaries defined n/a San Lorenzo 1795 Between Spain and United States San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain The treaty, without Choctaw participation, put Choctaw country under U.S. control n/a Fort Adams 1801 United States Mississippi Territory Re-defined Choctaw cession to England and permission for Natchez Trace 2,641,920 acres (10,691.5 km2) Fort Confederation 1802 United States Mississippi Territory Boundary re-defined, and lands ceded 10,000 acres (40 km2) Hoe Buckintoopa 1803 United States Choctaw Nation Small cession of Tombigbee River and redefined English treaty of 1765 853,760 acres (3,455.0 km2) Mount Dexter 1805 United States Choctaw Nation (Mississippi) Large cession from Natchez District to the Tombigbee Alabama River watershed 4,142,720 acres (16,765.0 km2) Fort St. Stephens 1816 United States Fort St. Stephens (Alabama) Ceded all Choctaw land east of Tombigbee River 10,000 acres (40 km2) Doak's Stand 1820 United States Natchez Trace, Choctaw Nation (Mississippi) Exchanged cession in Mississippi for parcel in Arkansas and prepare the Choctaws to become citizens of the United States 5,169,788 acres (20,921.39 km2) Washington City 1825 United States Washington, D.C.
