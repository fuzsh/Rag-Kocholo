There are no records of his leaving Texas, but his son John was found later residing in the Choctaw Nation. His grandson William H. McCoy was enrolled along with other Thompson relatives in the William C. Thompson et al vs. Choctaw Nation case. At the time he was residing near Marlow, Pickens County, Chickasaw Nation, IT (Stephens County, Oklahoma) Some family members believe he was killed by white vigilantes from Nacogdoches in an attack upon his Choctaw village near the Trinity river in 1840. I have not seen any support data to verify this.[1]\n\nWilliam McCoy. [2]\n\nResidence 1896 USA[3]\n\nYowani Choctaw Native Americans\n\nYowani (probably from the word for caterpillar) ('Yguanes/Yugani/Iguanes-Spanish') is a branch of the Choctaw tribe which became part of the Caddo Confederacy.[1] The Yowani were named for their village, the reason for the founding of a trading post and what became the European-American town of Shubuta, Mississippi nearby.[2] The Yowani continued to expand their holdings, eventually venturing into Louisiana, where they established close ties with the Caddo and adopted many of the Caddo customs.[1] When Louisiana became part of the United States under the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, many of the Indian tribes in the territory wanted to emigrate to less hostile environs. Spain agreed to allow the Yowanis and the Alabama-Coushatta to move to Spanish Texas. In 1824, a second group of Yowani received permission from Mexico to establish villages in Texas.[3] The Yowani gradually abandoned their original Mississippi homelands, and by 1850 most Yowani lived in Texas, Indian Territory, or in Rapides Parish, Louisiana.[4]\n\nDuring the Texas Revolution in 1836, the Yowani were a party to a peace treaty with the provisional government of Texas.[5] Following Texas's independence and the creation of the Republic of Texas, relations between Indian tribes and English-speaking settlers deteriorated. Under President Mirabeau B. Lamar, the Texas Army drove most of the Cherokee Indians out of Texas.[6] After a confrontation between a group of Indians and a few of the residents of Nacogdoches, which resulted in the deaths of at least three white men, a vigilante group set out after the offending Indians. Unable to catch the perpetrators, the mob sought revenge by attacking the peaceful and unsuspecting Choctaw village, where they murdered eleven.[7] The survivors split up, with most leaving Texas, at least temporarily. They believed Texas was a dangerous place for any Indian in 1840.[8]\n\nBetween 1840 and 1843, elements of the Mexican Militia, led by Vicente Cordova, fought a guerrilla war [9] utilizing remnant groups of displaced tribes, primarily Cherokee but including some Yowani Choctaw. The conflict culminated in the Battle of San Antonio in September 1842.[10] There, both Indian and Mexican regulars were involved in the Dawson Massacre[11] and the Battle of Salado Creek.[12] This was soon followed by the departure of Mexican troops from Texas soil.\n\nFor the remnant tribes, peace would come the following year with Sam Houston as Texas President. The Treaty of Birds Fort[13] brought an end to hostilities, especially for the Cherokee under Chief Chicken Trotter. Although only a few Choctaw were involved with the Cordova/Chicken Trotter group, the peace would have long-lasting effects on the Yowanis. Following the end of the Texas-Indian Wars, some of the Yowani returned to East Texas, where they settled with members of Chicken Trotter Cherokee and a few tribes to form the Mount Tabor Indian Community.[14] Most of the male members of the community served in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. In the early 20th century, several members of the Yowani Choctaw, led by William Clyde Thompson of Texas,[15] relocated to the Chickasaw Nation to be included in the Dawes Commission Final Rolls as citizens by blood of the Choctaw Nation.[16] A long political struggle ensued between 1898 and 1909. In 1905 all the Yowani were stricken from the Final Rolls of the Choctaw Nation.[17] Thompson appealed the matter to the United States Supreme Court.[18] After a favorable response[19] the families were included on a 1909 Choctaw reinstatement list giving them citizenship in the Choctaw Nation.[20]\n\nBirth\n\n1777\n\nChoctaw Nation, , Mississippi, USA[4][5]\n\nDeath\n\n1840\n\nYowani Choctaw Community, Nacogdoches, , Texas,USA[6][7]\n\nSources\n\n↑ JCT 5/20/05\n\n↑ Source: #S-216413371\n\n↑ Source: #S-216413371\n\n↑ Source: #S-2125745986\n\n↑ Source: #S-2125745987 Note: Information extracted from various family tree data submitted to Ancestry and The Generations Network\n\n↑ Source: #S-2125745986\n\n↑ Source: #S-2125745987 Note: Information extracted from various family tree data submitted to Ancestry and The Generations Network\n\nSource: S-2125745987 Title: Public Member Trees Author: Ancestry.com Publication: Online publication - Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2006.Original data - Family trees submitted by Ancestry members.Original data: Family trees submitted by Ancestry members.
