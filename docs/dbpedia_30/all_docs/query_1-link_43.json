In developing the papers students read current and historical texts, conducted interviews with tribal members and tribal employees, and developed survey questionnaires. Two reports discuss the lives of Choctaw chiefs Pushiaataha, 1764-1824, and Greenwood LeFlore, 1800-1865. Other historical reports cover early village life, codes of behavior and punishments, marriage and courtship practices, and 19th century missionary efforts among the Choctaw. An overview of Choctaw language includes the results of a survey of 36 students concerning their knowledge of Choctaw language and their attitudes toward instruction in Choctaw. A report on legends and superstitions also contains results of a survey of 31 students who were fairly knowledgeable about old Choctaw legends and superstitions but had few personal supernatural experiences. The final article discusses recent Choctaw economic development and housing trends and includes interviews with four employees of the Choctaw Housing Authority and a Choctaw-owned construction firm. Each report includes footnotes, bibliography, and black and white photographs.

Funded by a grant from the U S. Department of Education, under Title IV, Fiirt B, of the Indian Education Act, the Choctaw History, Culture, and Current Events (CHCCE) program in the tnbai Department of Education provided students the opportunity U; enter the world of scholarly research while learning a great deal about their tnfx\\ the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. While these papers do not represent pure, documented research and should not be used for scholarly purposes or citations, they lo represent an opportunity to look at historical texts and develop findings and conclusions seldom offered to Anient an Indian students at the secondary level. Edited by the CHCCE staff, the articles were corrected for typographical er rors, sources, footnote and bibliography entries were verified, and The drafts were expanded for clarity and completeness. In keeping with a respec t for the rhetoric and grammar of the past, direct quotations with variant spellings have been preserved by the editors, Tl::s volume is a result of an overall effort to make available to Choctaw high school students increased skills in research, study skills, reading, vim abulary development, and English composition, which will further iru tease their c ham es of success in college work. 1 am sureyou will enjoy, and learn from, their efforts as assembled ;n A CHOCTAW ANTHOLOGY II!

Although other Southeastern tribes practiced communal fields, no record of such fields among the Choctaws had been recorded, according to Peterson. Major crops included: \"several varieties of corn, beans, squashes, pumpkins, melons, and sunflowers.\" 2 Hunting was another means used by the Choctaws to provide necessary food from one crop season to another. Small animals were hunted throughout the year; however, deer and bear were the \"major game animals.\" 3 m«nu*<.fipt. MitMiippi Sl»l« Univ«f*itvl. P 6 Itwf . pp 6 1 a And. p S 9 ERJC 9 BBI £0Py AVAIUBli In the Tate fall « nd early winter\" the population among the Choctaws was \"dispersed somewhat,* because the men traveled to different areas to hunt, while \"the worfien, children and older people gathered nuts and fall fruits/ This 'population dispersal* led some writers to believe that the Choctaws \"were a migrant people/ Petef^on records that Halberts observation of this pattern in the late nineteCfitlC century, \"makes it clear that this was only one phase of the Chpctavar^ annual cycle.* 4 An eighteenth century French manuscript, quoted by Swanton, ' gives \"the best early account, of the Choctaw house and menage * The house is merely a cabin made of wooden posts of tfie size of tfje leg, buried in the earth, and fastened together with lianas {vines], wh&h make very flexible bands. The rest of the waS is of mud and there are no window*; the door » only from three to four feet in height. The catans are , covered with bark of the cypress or pine. A hole is left at the top of each gaNe-end to let the smoke out, for they make their Sres in die middle of the cabins, which are a gunshot c&st&nt from one another. . . . 5 Swanton also quotes a Mr. Mease, author of the \"Narrative of a Journey Through Several Parts of the Province of West Florida in the Years 1770 and 1771/ It is the description of a house in the town of Imoklasha (in Neshoba County, Mississippi), owned by a Choctaw Indian named Astoiabe. This house is nearly of a circular figure and built of day mixed with haulm [straw or grass]. Jpe top is conical and covered with a hind of thatch (the nature of] which I cou'd not make out. The inside roof is divided into four parts and there are cane seats raised about two feet from the ground which go round the building (I mean on the inside), broad enough to He upon, maksng the wall serve the purpose of a pillow. Underneath these seats or beds they keep their potatoes and pumps? ns cover'd with earth, but their corn « in a building by itself raised at least eight feet from the ground The fire place is in th$ middle of the floor, just as in some parts of the highlands of Scotland only they have no aperture at top to evacuate the smoke The door ss opposite one side (for the house is round without, yet on the inside it approaches near to the figure of an octagon) and is exceeding small m both height and breadth. 6 Cushman describes Choctaw housing as follows:' Mohn H SwAfifon.

In Muscogee country, one hundred fifty miles to the east of Choctaw country, was the large French, Alabama garrison. Mobile, the first French settlement in West Florida, was about one hundred fifty miles south. 9 *> Claiborne records that when missionaries began their work among the Choctaws ir 1818, the Choctaws \"were found iaa semi- civilized state, living in huts or cabins, cultivating small patches of com and beans in a very primitive fashion, and some of than owning herds of a small breed of horses and cattle \" Land was free; little cabins were built by the 'side of some bubbling spring.*' 0 According to Peterson, the population of Choctaw towns Varied- from \"seventy- five to approximately a thousand.\" The towns were made up primarily of individual houses, \"sometimes spread along a stream but in the north and east more tightly clustered within a fortified wall/ 1 1 \"Every village of any size was buff t around an open space, which H B Cu«hm«n, Hatt»yi?!ih*0 %x:tato, Chci k o^ ^^c^i frKtoni> «d Antf* D*bo <Nju> York Ru***l k Rwm»U, W72), p 173 OvaJ H Dr*vrw.

[the Choctaw tribe) intimately . . . , three geographical divisions were recognized m However, he felt 'hat *to introduce any order into the several town classifications* handed Gown, that four divisions were necessary. It «ecms pretty clear that the Sixtown Indians (Okla Hannali) and their immediate neighbor^ who lived m the southern-part of the old Choctaw territory, were early differentiated from the rest, the separation being partly linguistic and partly cultural Sometimes this division is limited absolutely to*ihe six towns which save it its name, but more often tt is extended to include certain neighboring towns, particularly Chkasswhay and Yowani , wfuc h seem to have shared in some measure the peculiarities of the group. Another smai] body, centraBy located, embraced those towns in which, early in the eighteenth century, lived the principal officials of the entire nation, the Kunsh&k or Cane towns being particularly noteworthy among them. The importance of this group is reflected in the name which Regs du RouUet gives to it, the Big People (Okla Chito). The remaining (owns were divided into two parties, one to the west known as the Tong People\" (Okla Faiaya), and one to the east, the \"People of the Opposite Side (or Party)\" (Okla tannap).\" Tom Goldman, a Mississippi attorney and an authority of Mississippi archeofogical sites and villages, made the following comments about Choctaw sites and villages: Wound 1700-1832, Choctaw towns were spread out; buildings may have been one-hundred yards apart. A village could have been four or five miles tong, so not all Choctaws knew everyone in their village. The Choctaws did not have a communal bond, as the Creeks did. There were no common fields or storage, just individual efforts. Each family in the village site had a summer house, a winter house, and a com crib for storage. Towns facing Alabama on the Tombigbee River were stockaded against raids from the Creeks. Towns in the interior had no stockades. The ideal locations for settlement were on hills near water, and \"Ano* D«bo. The ft * a rtfaS o/ th*Chocto u> RtpuM* (Nonn*ft, Okkhom* Urwtrsrty d Oklahoma Prttt, !«), pr 78 ~^ Uohn R Swanton.

The high banks were selected for dwelling sites; t.*low banks for farmland. All of the land had to be high enough to dry out for planting. Trobably fifty or sixty dwellings made up a town. The largest known Choctaw town was Coosa, in Lauderdale County. It had about 1200 residents, spread for miles. \"Summer houses were open and used just for sleeping. The small door was made of poplar planks. The houses were similar to the Seminole 'chickee.' Everything was kept in the winter houses. These houses were circular, made of logs stuck vertically in the ground, bound with vines, and plastered with mud. The houses had thatched roofs! (In this area, Johnson grass was used-about two acres of grass were needed per house). Farther south, palmettos were used. The fire was in the center of the dirt floor. The doorway entry was curved so that wind couldn't blow in. f his also deterred the enemy from entering quickly. \"Around the inside of the house was a platform three feet high and three feet wide, used for sleeping. Skins were used for padding. Many times the Choctaws would use certain animal skins for their children, because they wanted the children to take on the characteristics of that particular animal. One reason beds were not on the floor was to keep the fleas from getting on the beds. Rushes covered the floors. One reason many artifacts are found is because items became lost in the rushes. \"Village populations were based on the number of warriors. A large village with 600-700 people may have had 250 warriors. A large village would have one, two, or three subsidiary villages, of around 200 people. I think that during this time period, a realistic number of warriors would be an average of 4,000. \"There was probably a central area for ceremonies at most sites. If the village was big and prosperous enough, there was a large winter house for 200-300 people to meet. In the summer, they met in open areas. \"Each family had their own weapons, and these were hung on the wall. Weapons used were war clubs, tomahawks, throwing sticks, and bows and arrows. The Whitemen's weapons were used by the mid- / seventeenth century. The musket is an example. \"There were three districts and two moieties (tribal subdivisions) 0 ERIC 5 13 at this time. People within each village had a headman-a village chief, plus three or four assistants. These individuals were first called 'honored men', then 'captains', later. Choctaw women had a voice in tribal decisions, which were completely democratic. Elections were by vote of the tribe, at the 'pleasure' of the tribe. Elected officials could be voted out. \"The Choctaws believed in a single God, described as the 'Great Giver of Breath.' They did not worship the sun, but it was considered God's eye. They believed in life after death. They condemned adultery, robbery, murder, etc. They also recognized little people' and demons. \"Agriculturally, each family planted an acre and put com every three feet. Beans, squash, peas, and melons were planted among the corn. It is estimated the Choctaws could raise 250 bushels per acre and that they rased * surplus. There was a system of trails all over the Choctaw Nation -a myriad of trails between villages for constant commerce. The Choctaws were great travelers and had been to both coasts. Before the Whitemen, they traded stone, arrowheads, slaves, food, and pottery. After the Whitemen, they traded furs-mostly deerskins. Nearly everyone at that time wore buckskins. They traded with the English, French, and Spanish, for beads, tools, weapons, and cloth. \"In 1812, it was recorded that the Choctaws traded 38,000 deerskins during one season. Hunting began in October and continued all winter. Trading centers were in Mobile and Pensacola. A big trading center in this area was on the Tombigbee. When America' took over, trading was operated by the government. By the time the Choctaws left in 1832, they had better clothing, food, and shelter, much like the Whitemen. \" ! « * * * * Following is an interview with Calvin Becton, a resident of Philadelphia, Mississippi, and a collector of Indian artifacts. How did you become interested in finding village siies? There was a site near my house, and whenever farmers would plow through the field, they would uncover artifacts. I began collecting at that time, but became more interested after beginning work with the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. I have pursued this interest since.\" •Mnwrvww wmh Thorn*. I GoUnwv Armmry m U*. Mf-K*«n. MttMupv,, iO Jjnu*r v [<*K> fcRfctQPY AVAILABLE Generally, where have you located village sites? \"Mostly in Lauderdale, Kemper, and Neshoba counties in Mississippi, and some in Choctaw County and other counties in Alabama.*' How do you know where to look? 'Old maps are one of the best ways to begin. The French maps indicated a lot of village sites. Other maps have been made since the early French maps. Some of the survey maps can be used, but the survey lines on one map do not always agree with the survey lines on another map. Also, new survey maps do not always match old survey maps, so they offer some guidance, but are not always that reliable. It's beneficial to talk to farmers, especially those who walk behind the mules, chop cotton by hand, and realty know the land. They would be the ones who would be close to the ground and see the artifacts when they were turned up.' As that kind of farming has passed, with more pasture land and tree farming, the clues from these people who work the soil become L * and less available.* What \"clues* lead you to a site? \"Geographical features are important. In order for the Indians to farm, the soil had to be sandy loam which was easy for them to turn over with simple tools. It was necessary to have a year around water supply and to be in an area that was not frequently flooded. One example of a large village site that was near a spring, but no large creeks, was DeKalb. That was one of the largest Choctaw village sites in this area and the town of DeKalb has been built on that site. You also look for chips and shards, and over by Alabama, you will find shell mounds from the mussel shells that were gathered from the streams and discarded into the trash heaps.\" How many sites have you discovered? \"Roughly ten, besides 'outlying areas.\" What are some of the artifacts that you have found? \"Copper arm bands that were trade items after the white settlers moved in, beads, and a stone face that was probably for ceremonial use. I found about two-thirds of it. It has got the eye holes, and a place for the nose to fit and so forth. There is a piece of bone that has eight embedded pearls. It is about the size of, well, in between a golf ball and a baseball. Kennith York and I were talking to a medicine man about the identity of this object, and the man told Ken a little about it. He told Ken that it belonged to a medicine man, but he wouldn't say much else. I have also found weapons and weapon points. When I go to a site to dig, 1 take only a hunting knife or something like that, no shovels or any similar tools. I do not do any excavating; I look mainly for surface finds/ What unusual or interesting incidents have occurred while locating sites? 1 think the most unusual thing is the unpredictability of finds. Sometimes, I really anticipate finding a lot at a certain site and may find only two or three items; and sometimes, I won't be expecting much and find a lot buried under the top l^yer of dirt. At one site on the Little Yazoo River near the edge of Nieshoba and Kemper Counties, there was a burial site. I was in red claylsoil, and found these artifacts in a little patch of black soil which was presumably from a decomposed body. On the site, I found parts of a pocket knife, part of a flintlock, a flint, and the trigger mechanism from a flintlock gun, two mini-ball bullets that had been shot, one blue bead, dnd one white bead. According to talk, the blue beads were to be worn only by important people, like chiefs or medicine men. ! \"At Imoklasha, 1 spent a year digging with my knife and found a layer of black soil that marked a house site that had burned, as was indicated by the charcoal layer. It was approximately sixteen by iwenty feet, and right in the center was a rock-lined fire bed that was still intact. 1 know of two sites where the Choctaws got clay for their pottery. One was at Tucker [one of the seven Choctaw Reservation communities] and one was on the West Yazoo River. The one on the Yazoo still has trails visible where you could see that the people had gone down to get their clay. They had gone there for quite awhile, because the trails were really well worn. Another site that has been owned by the same family since settlement, was where the Choctaws can*e for camping and stickball. The name of this place in Choctaw means Big Canebrake/lt was probably a source of cane for the baskets and blowguns, and probably the families came there to camp and play stickball.*' What do you do with the artifacts that you discover? T do not give the artifacts away; I keep them on display. At one time, I had a little museum, but a tornado in April, 1981, came through and rolled the building used for the museum about two hundred yards. This messed up the classification. I had a different showcase/container for each site collection. Presently, I have an artifact house/museum in my backyard; and although 1 know from which site each collection belongs, I need to finish my reclassification.\" Do you keep maps and records of your searches? 1 do not keep maps, I do keep track of where and when I find things. I have been at this hobby for thirty to forty years. Many times, 1 find arrowpoints and artifacts that I don't know what they were used for. In many instances, arrowheads were used as money. Because Mississippi does not have many deposits of useable flint, most of the green stone and most of the flints that are found here, were traded into this area. They came from Tennessee and other areas.\" 15 The Choctaw \"village\" scene in Mississippi, although altered by the inevitable \"touch\" of time, progress, and necessity, has still retained much of the past. T ra ditions and customs compliment the surroundings, and the Choctaw language prevails. Claiborne records that the Choctaw \"tribe had a great pride of race The warrior's proudest boast was Chah ta se a ho cut ba (Chahta sia hok\" |. 16 1 am ( s Choctaw!\" This prtde is still very much alive!

When wrongdoings occurred, they consistently followed a strong code of honor. Prior to the advancement ami influence of the Whitemen, the Choctaw* . . . had no written Jaws, and their government rested alone on custom and usage, growing (Hit of their possessions and their wants; yet was conducted so harmoniously by the influence of their native genius and experience, that one would hardly bdkve that human society could be maintained with so Kttte artifice. 2 The Choclaw code and forms of punishment were consistent, not questioned, and evidently considered just-everyone seemed to know there would be definite results to certain actions and choices; therefore, their justice was swift and effective. Cushman says that the major crimes according to tribal law were \"homicide, blasphemy, theft and adultery.\" Punishment of offenders consisted of \"a mixed system of private and public punishment,\" depending on the offense.

A first offense resulted in fifty lashes; a second offense resulted in one hundred lashes; and a third offense resulted in \"death by rifle/ 6 Cushman continues: the ufie was invariably used as the instrument of exea 1 for the soul of the Choctaw who had been executed by hanging egarded as accursed never being permitted to join his people in th* f^ppy hunting grounds, but h» sprit must forever haunt the place where he was hung. 7 Whipping and Public Ridicule A woman who committed adultery was subjected to either whipping or public ridicule, unless she belonged to a larger or a more noted family than did her husband- 8 If a woman ran away with someone's husband, she might receive thirty-nine lashes (the same fate awaited a man who ran off wit h someone s wife), 9 or she might be put in a public place and be \"carnally known by all who . . .

The duty of the Tight horsemen\" was to find and punish criminals. 12 When the offense warranted whipping, he who had been condemned to receive th» punishment never attempted to evade it. He promptly presented himself near the church door , where, singularly enough, this punishment was inflicted Before the hour appointed the neighborhood assembled, where they chatted and smoked, never refenng [sjc | to the matter in hand. The culprit was as gay and as free as any of them Precisely at the moment designated the tight horsemen would appear. The crowd then went into the church, closed the door and struck up a hymn. At the same moment the culprit would say, 1 have come, I am ready;\" he would strip off his shirt, atevate his hands, and, turmng his back to the light horsemen, say \"proceed.\" He was severely scourged with a hickory switch. When fifteen or twenty strokes had been given he would turn each s>de to receive the blows, uttering no word and manifesting no pain. When the blows ceased, the church door was opened, and the whole assembly marc hed out and shook hands with the sufferer, thus manifesting their appreciation of hrs fortitude, and the subject was then and there dropped forever. M The Choctaws considered accidental killing or murder a crime of utmost seriousness, and this resulted in the implementation of \" . their severest law of . . . blood revenge, . . It was acknowledged among all, not only to be the right, but also the imperative duty of the nearest relative on the male side of the slain, to kill the slayer wherever and whenever a favorable opportunity was presented/ Only rarely did the guilty one flee, but if this did occur, \"any male member of the murderer's family . . . might become the victim of the avenger in blood. . . Once the relative's life was sacrificed, the murderer \"could return without fear of molestation; but the name of coward was given to hinv-an appellation more dreadful and kss endurable than a hundred deaths. ...\"A relative of the guilty one could request to be executed in Blood for-Blood Code »»M B Cu»hm*n, Manx* t>t the ChixtouXhtckatCw and NoHh*t Indtant. p 88 igF H Claihorn* .

According to the code, once she made the offer, and it was accepted by the victim's family, the son had no choice but to allow his mother her wish. For years after, he was \"often taunted by the relatives and friends of the old man he had slain, with the accusation of cowardice.\" Not able to stand the taunts and not willing to risk \"his eternal destiny\" by taking his own Kfe, he came up with an idea. He killed the son of the first man he had killed, dug his own grave, cleaned his rifle, sang the death song, and performed \"the farewell shaking of hands of his relatives and friends present\"; after which, \"the sharp rifle crack that immediately followed told but too plainly that . . . [he] was dead.\" 15 Not only could relatives be substitutes, but ~any one might take the place of the murderer, and in death of the substitute the law was satisfied, and the true criminal remained exempt.\" 16 A Choctaw man had the responsibility to see that his brother, if he had killed a man, was at the appointed time and place set for the execution. Gregg reports an incident involving brothers that makes it clear the finality with which the code was obeyed: \"When the day arrived, the murderer exhibited some reluctance to fulfill the pledge, when the other said to him, 'My brother, you are no brave -you are afraid to die -stay here and take care of my famify- 1 will die in your place' whereupon he immediately attended the appointed spot, and was executed accordingly.\" 17 Two travelers into the Choctaw Nation during the early nineteenth century recorded their observations of this rigid Choctaw code. The first account is by an English traveler: Fortescue Cuming observed that if one Choctaw maimed or mutilated one another in a fray, he lost h»s life The guilty one was given a few days, or if necessary, even a few months to settle hts affar. v At the end of the period the criminal must give himself up to the injured party, or one of his nearest relatives, who never failed to carry out the penalty to the fullest extent by shooting the offender ; \" **H B t'ufthman.

Following are accounts from Claiborne, Romans, Bushneil, and Swanton. Claiborne I heir criminal <.ode was very simple blood for blood This may be illustrated by the story of Pi m tubbee, a young Choctaw brave, who lived in the present county of Winston Shortly before the first emigration west, he quarreled with a warrior and killed htm on the spot He fled, but not so far that he did not know that he had to die, and that a day had been appointed when the Choc taws would assemble at a designated place, and he was *»xpit't ed to appear and surrender his life for the blood he had shed The day i arne, and the people met on the crest of a hill overlooking the valley of the Nan awy yah, about a mile from the sacred mound But the fugitive was not there, and the day was waning. At length, they perceived him rapidly approaching There was general rejoicing, for to have been derelict would have been a disgrace to his clan, and one of his kindred would have had to die m his place He excused his delay; that before his misfortune he had made a promise to attend a dance a long way off, and as tt was his last on earth, he desired to keep it, that after it was over he had traveled night and day, and was now ready to die w Claiborne In the winter of 1824 a party of Choc taws had been picking cotton for the planters near Rodney, and closed their labors with a frolic, the men got drunk, and the women concealed all the weapons they could get hold of. to prevent bloodshed A quarrel sprang up between two young men They were separated by the women Next day at noon they were seen standing with their rifles twelve feet apart They fired at the same moment and one fell dead The survivor immediately seated himself on the ground, stripped off his shirt, with 3 niece of charcoal drew, the outline of a heart )ust over his own, and chanted the death song.

The following day after . . . the murderer realized what he had done, and knowing he would have to die , . . . went to the relatives of the murdered man and told them he was ready to meet his doom, but asked that he be allowed to remain with them about two weeks longer, as he did not want to miss a dance to be held within that time. To this they consented, and during the following days he was given many small presents, as pieces of ribbon, beads, and tobacco He was treated by everyone . . . with the greatest respect and kindness; all endeavored to make his last days enjoyable. At last came the event on account of which his fife had been prolonged and for three days and nights all sang and danced The next day, just at noon, when the sun was directly overhead, was the time fixed for the execution. Shortly before that time his friends and relatives gathered at his house, where he jomed them. Ail then proceeded to the cemetery, for the execution was to take place on the edge of the grave that he himself had helped to dig, m a spot he had selected. The murderer stood erect at one end of the grave* and with his own hands parted his shin over his heart. Four of his male friends stood near with their hands on his shoulders and legs, to keep his body erect after death. His female relatives were on each side, and all were singing loudly. Soon he announced that he was ready. A relative of the murdered man advanced and, pressing the muzzle of a rifle against the murderer's chest, fired. 23 Swanton: A curious account of a murder, apparently grounded in jealousy, is thus related in detailing the proceedings of a congress of Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations opened at Mobile by John Stuart, the British agent, on December 3, 1771.

[where] this CouncU abandoned in principle the law of retaliation\" because the Choctaws agreed to the \"death of the Choc;aw who had killed the trader\"; however, the execution was cleverly delayed until after the white murderer was punished. 25 After the establishment of the \"light horsemen,\" the responsibility of punishing murderers was shifted from private and personal to the \"light horsemen.\" When a murder was committed, they gathered testimony and if one , was found guilty of wilful and malicious murder, they announced the verdict and appointed the time and place of execution. They never arrested the {guilty onej, and he never failed to appear. He repaired to the grave that had been already dug. knelt by the side of it . made a target on hts naked breast for the executioner, was instantly shot, the grave filled up, and he was never mentioned afterwards. 2 * \"The custom of leaving the murderer to be disposed of as the relatives of the deceased saw proper, was then set aside, and the right of trial by the light horse who acted in a three fe'd capacity -sheriff, judge, and jury was awarded to all offenders.\" They were 'composed of a brave and vigilant set of fellows, and nothing escaped their eagle eyes. . . . \" .^hDt^un./ NWapp. Slat* D*p* .nwnf of Arc h^a«d K»tofy Jackwn.

A \"doctor\" predicted the recovery of a Choctaw girl, but when she died, it was decided that \"her sudden demise was the result of a . , . witch ball shot from an invisible rifle in the hands of a witch\" whereupon the dead girls father killed the accused witch. *° Debo suggests that an incident witnessed and related by Adam Hodgson may have been the continuation of th^ preceding situation. He \"saw fifty or sixty Choc taws assembled in the woods to avenge the death of a woman who had been killed as a witch/ 31 In 1829, the Choc taws established a law enabling a person who had been accused of witchcraft the opportunity^ a trial. Whereas, if has been an old custom of the Choc taws to punish t>*rvons said to hi? wizards [sic] or witches with death, without giving mem any fair trial by any disinterested persons; and many have fallen victims under the influence of this habit We do hereby resolve, in general council of the north, east, and southern districts, that, in future, all persons who shall be accused of being a wizzard or witch, shall be tried before the chiefs and committees, or by any four captains, and if they be found guilty, they shall be punished at the discretion of the court. Be it further resolved, tha{ if any person or persons shall find at any plat e the entrails of a wtzzard or witch, the said entrail going from or returning to the body, the said body shall be put to death at the place where it may be discovered, and the said body shall be cut open, by a proper person, and an examination be made to see whether it has in it any entrails, and a report be made of &aid body. And it ts hereby further resolved, that no doctor shall have tht power to pass sentence of death upon any person or persons that may be accused of being a wizzard or witch: and any doctor so offending shaD suffer the penalty of death.

Suicide was viewed as an abhorrent act; and yet, a form of. suicide, through duels, was considered honorable and acceptable. An early missionary, Israel Folsom described such duels: A quarrel or disagreement between two warriors would often result in the challenge of one by the other. The ensuing duel really meant deatft-for both, and throu^n dying, each warrior proved his bravgry and the possession of \"an honest and sincere heart/ If one of the challenged should back out, he would be considered ^cowardly ami dishonest. There was a \"common saying among them, that a man should never quarrel, unless he &as willing to be challenged and to die.* After the challenge was . verbally given, face to face, the time and place were designated; and each of the challengers, along with their seconds, met. \"The two combatants then took Jheir plages unarmed about twenty feet apart, each with a second at his right sicfe with a rifle in hand. At a given signal, each second shot the combatant standing before him. That dosed J he scene/\" N * ' N Destiny of the Spirit Perhaps the Choctaw belief in the destiny of one's spirit involved in death by murder furthered the Sounds of the code. Thetf believed the soul entered a land of delight , ever warm, ever illumined by the beams of a vernal sun f and ♦ ever spontaneously pouring forth its varied productions in rich profusion, Here was a continued succession of dancing games, and V plays, and thus they gilded sweetly away in one continued scene of festivity \\and mirth. To enter this land of delight, no amendment of the life was J necessary, and none were excluded from a participation of its pleasures, except those who had committed murder of the most aggravated kind (SJosetp this happy land, and within sight of it , was the place to which ghosts of murderers went at death. By some uncontrollable destiny, they were un »le to find the bright path, which led to the land of the blessed, but were compelled to take another road . . to . . . their destination.

(primitive! custom.\" Prior to their dfij^rture from Mississippi, they initiated two principles that were to become the basis of their legal system. When they instituted the light hcfrsemen . . . they accepted the principle that law was a matter of tnhal concern rather than private revenge When they began to modify their ancient customs by deciwonsnfthe^ warriors in council, they recognized the legislative character of their legal code> J As with any civilization, changes brought about by time and trends affected the Choctaw code. After 1830, the death penalty was used for \"murder ,\"rape (second offense), robbing with dangerous weapons, and treason.\" In 1834, the \"killing of a witch or wizard\" was considered murder. In 1839, treason was defined as \"the act of a chief, captain, or citizen in signing a sale of Choctaw -land.\" ' Among other crimes were* theft, arson, selling intoxicating liquor, perjury, forgery, poigamy, adultery, gambling or bringing cards or any gambling device, disturbing religious services, bribery, carrying pistols, skinning dead animals on the range, disturbing the peace, and defacing public buildings r Today, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians strives to serve justice to all of its members. This is brought about, in part, through the development of the Choctaw Tribal Code, through the appointment of % judges who are tribal members, and through tribal control of Choctaw J Law and Order.

James Adair, an Englishman who traded with the Indians for forty years, deplored the \"British neglect of the Indians\" in this regard. Adair advised iSe British government of the type of missionary the Indians needed, voicing much concern over Use evils already experienced by the Indians under immoral and uneducated clergymen. 1 The Great Awakening, a period of religious revival in the middle eighteenth century, followed by the Great Revivals sixty years later, 'forged the framework\" for missionary endeavors. By 1800, emphasis was on \"personal piety\" and the masses, including Indians, Negroes, and other underprivileged people, not just for the \"New England Congregational ists.\" 2 Another factor that influenced the establishment of missions for the Indians was a law passed by Congress in March, 1819. This law, entitled \"An Act making provisions for the civilization of the Indian tribes adjoining the frontier settlements,\" provided financial support for missions, which \"no doubt encouraged the Missionary Board to undertake missionary work among the Indians \" To qualify for this support, missions had to teach the girls domestic arts and the boys mechanical arts. 3 \\ >Pfrc V L Rttnwjttf, Indon Mtunr* *nd M—Kxwno.'

Interest by the Choctaws in an educational program was at a time when \"Secretary of War, Calhoun, had urged Congress to provide for Indian education. . . .* In 1818, the Choctaws requested that a mission station be established at Eliot, located on the Yalobusha River. The Choctaw Council supported Choctaw education by allotting \"a major portion of its annuity\" when federal funds were not sufficient. Early missionary attempts by the French had not been successful. The Choctaws also had resisted Protestant missionaries until they were convinced that the missionaries were as interested in \"providing education and training as in converting them to Christianity.* 4 When the missionaries went among the Chickasaws and Choctaws, the Indians had already begun abandoning their old ways of \"roaming and hunting\" and had begun 'arming and raising cattle. The Choctaws and Chickasaws wanted their children to be taught \"the white man's way,\" and welcomed the missionaries. 5 In May, 1818, Rev. Cyrus Kingsbury of the mission at Brainerd, near Chattanooga, in the Cherokee Nation, was requested by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (jointly managed by the Presbyterians and Congregationalists), to go into the Choctaw Nation to establish a mission. His experience and knowledge of the \"Indian character\" were factors in this request. Mr. and Mrs. Loring S. Williams, also of the mission at Brainerd, and a Mr. Ladd, a hired man, left Brainerd May 25, and traveled by flat-bottomed boat \"down the Tennessee River for Colbert's ferry where they arrived on June 6.* Rev. Kingsbury left Brainerd May 30, after the Williams party had embarked, but arrived at Colbert's ferry the same day as the Williams group. Kingsbury went ahead to the Yalobusha settlement, then under control of Captain Perry, a half breed. \"The settlement was composed largely of half breeds, some of whom were owners of negro slaves.\" The Williams party, with the help of Kingsbury and Captain Perry who had set out to meet them, arrived at the Yalobusha settlement on June 27, 1818. 6 'JofcnH Petersen, Jr .

This service was attended by \"half breeds, two white men and the negro slaves.\" A site was chosen for the mission station, which was to be named \"Elliott, H in honor of the noted Apostle of the American Indians. It was located about two miles from Yabbusha River, about thirty miles above its influx into Yazoo River and in the present Grenada County, Mississippi \" The missionaries \"were unwearied\" in their work with the Indians, and directed their energies for many months toward erecting mission buildings. 4 On March 2H. 1 1819} after solemn fasting and prayer, the first missionary church was organised at Elliott, consisting of ten members, the entire missionary party, men and women Pending the completion of the regular s. hool h'Hise, on April 19, a school of ten pupils was opened m one of the r«x>ms of the Mission house Some of the pupils were from families living in distant parts ol the nation \"' A mill, storehouses, and stables were completed by mid-summer. In August. Dr William Pride, a physician, arrived at the mission, along with a blacksmith and farmer, Mr. Isaac Fisk. Other buildings and shops were erected, and \"soon furniture, wagons, and all kinds of agricultural implements were made at the mission. Its future was now secure.\" 1 : In 1820, \"Apuckshunnubbee and Moshulatubbee, with seven chiefs, visited Eliot and were highly elated at the progress of the pupils \"At that time, the Choctaw country was divided into three districts, known as the western, northeastern and southern, called Upper Towns, Lower Towns, and Six Towns Each district had a ruling chief, and each town a subordinate chief, captain, and warriors, who managed the local affairs of the people Eliot was located in the western district, over which, at that time.

M Haibert records that the site was \"on the South side of Oktibbeha creek overlooking an extensive prairie to the South.\" Mr. Kingsbury, with some laborers he had employed, began building a camp for shelter until a \"suitable house\" could be built. Because of storms and rains, It was several weeks before the mission house was completed.\" On March 23, 1820, \"a day of great rejoicing, Mr. Kingsbury moved into . . , {the mission house J, having lived four weeks in the wet smoky camp.\" Mr Kingsbury returned to Eliot, after having made \"arrangements for opening of a garden, a cornfield and the building of cowpens.\" 14 This second mission among the Choc taws was named May hew, in affectionate remembrance of Mr Mayhew and his descendents, missjonani-s among the Indians on Martha's Vineyard. Mayhew mission was s ftuated tn the northeastern corner of Oktibbeha county ( Mississippi ], and half a mile from Lowndes county on the east and the *ame distance from Clay county on the north.\" 5 s The establishment of another station and another school, \"echoed and re-echoed throughout the (Choctaw) Nation\" and applications from \"various parts of the Nation\" were made for stations and schools.

These annuities were for large tracts of land sold by the Choctaws to the United States.\" 16 Rev Cyrus Kingsbury, along with Mrs. Kingsbury, Rev.

The closing exercises of the first session of the Mayhew school were attended by many parents and friends, who were \"delighted at the improvement of their children.\" Chief Moshulatubbee attended with many of his chieftains and warriors, and made the following remarks: Such a thing was not known here when I was a boy I had heard of it, hut d*d not expect to see it I rejo>ce that i have lived to see it You must mmd your teat hers, and learn ail you can.

In 1818, Protestant ^missionaries made a lasting impression on the Choc taws, and their condition improved. Instruction in agriculture and a written form of the Choctaw language were part of this growth. An alphabet \"suggested by the Hon. John Pickering\" was used. The first hook printed was a spelling book, by the American Tract Society, in 1825. 4 D.G Brinton, M.D., editor of work by Rev. Cyrus Byington, refers to Byington as an \"eminent scholar and missionary, whose nam*? is inseparably connected with the later history of the Choctaw nation. . . ~ s Byington worked dtligeatly with the Choctaw language, with its difficult construction, to make it available for the \"missionary and philological student.\" In 1834, Byington completed the first draft of his Grammar.

The Choctaw language was important, not only because the Choc taws were the largest linguistic group in the Muskogean family, but also because \"Choctaw formed the basis for the lingua franca of the southeastern region. \" 1S Accor- \".ng to Badger in a 1978 publication, the majority of Mississippi Choctaws are \"bilingual and moderately literate in English.\" He states that cultural patterns will, in future generations, be only curiosities and relics, if the Choctaw language is not retained and fostered. 16 Thallis Lewis, a Choctaw tribal member, has worked with and among her people for many years in tribal educational programs. Two of these programs, Bilingual Education and English as a Second Language, involve language development, and this has enabled her to observe trends in the progression of language changes on the reservation. Through contact with C hot taws of many ages, she has seen two phases or distinctions of speech emerge: One, the older Choctaws speak the Choctaw language \"the old way.\" The entire word is pronounced and that pronunciation is the \"old Choctaw language.\" Two. speakers, both young and old, combine Choctaw and English within a sentence. This will happen particularly with words that describe or belong to something in the non Chocfaw culture; for example, words asscxiated with advanced technology.
