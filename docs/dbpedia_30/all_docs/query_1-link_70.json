Swanton INTRODUCTION In a wide area beyond the Mississippi River within the boundaries of the great States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma, there lived, at the earliest period of which we have historical record â that is, the first half of the sixteenth century â a group of tribes of the very first importance, but one which has been almost lost to sight by our ethnological students and its significance seriously underrated. This is owing in a measure to the fact that the period when these tribes played a prominent part in history was before they and their lands came under the control of the United States and the records of that period, preserved in foreign languages and largely buried in long unfrequented archives, were little known even to American stu- dents, and in part because by the time professional ethnologists were prepared to take the field the Caddo tribes had been uprooted from their historic seats, broken up, their separate rites and dialects ex- tinguished or confounded, and the merest shreds of their ancient culture preserved. The attention of students was naturally drawn away to tribes still retaining their early usages and ceremonials in some vigor. Wlien I undertook to assemble materials from the original sources bearing on the tribes of the lower Mississippi, the Caddo were not included, partly because they did not reach the Mississippi and partly because consideration of them was believed to involve a study of the stock to which they belonged, and work was at that time being conducted in it by Dr. George A. Dorsey of the Field Museum of Natural History. Thanks to the work of Dr. Dorsey, Dr. Wissler and his collabo- rators, Mr. Murie, Miss Fletcher, and more recently Dr. Gilmore, Dr. Lesser, Dr. Weltfish, and others, we now have a large body of material on the northern representatives of the Caddoan stock, but the little that has been done on Caddo proper shows clearly that, 1 2 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull, isa except in the matter of language, not much bearing upon the real aboriginal lives of these people may be expected through direct stud- ies. It is hoped that Dr. Lesser and Dr. Weltfish will be enabled to complete the investigations on the Caddoan languages they have so well begun. In the present work I have undertaken to bring together the principal materials relating to these Indians from Span- ish and French sources. For the translation and publication of them we are particularly indebted to the Texas State Historical Society and the students of the University of Texas, to Prof. Herbert E. Bolton, now librarian of the Bancroft Library in San Francisco, Dr. Carlos E. Castaiieda, Latin-American Librarian at the University of Texas, the Quivira Society, Mr. Frederick M. Chabot, Miss Mattie Austin Hatcher, and others who have brought these invaluable doc- uments regarding well-nigh forgotten people to the attention of historians and ethnologists. The Caddo Indians are noteworthy in many ways. They have given their name to one of the large lakes of northwestern Louisiana and a parish in that State, and contributed many place names to the region which they formerly inhabited. Their name has also been extended to one of the principal linguistic families of North America. To the western Caddo we owe the name of the largest State of our Union. Although not the first Texas tribe to appear in history, they made the greatest impression upon the explorers who visited the territory now occupied by it, so that finally, as just noted, the name which had become fixed to them was transferred to the Spanish, and later Mexican, province, and to the Republic and State which in turn succeeded. Fate decreed that the lands of the Caddo tribes should lie in the debated region between French and Spanish claims, and later between the possessions of the United States and those of Spain, and the Republic of Mexico, whose authority succeeded to that of Spain. Hence, they constituted a factor in the history of the Southwest of peculiar significance. Moreover, what we know of aboriginal Caddo culture, particularly the excellence of Caddo pottery, and its developed social and cere- monial organizations, and the influence exerted by them upon the surrounding peoples, make the Caddo a center of interest in their own right. There can be little doubt that they played a part in the history of the area before white contact even more important than their role after the advent of Europeans. In the subjoined material there are but few original notes, the greater part, as the title implies, being a compilation from the productions of earlier writers, including mainly the letters and reports of the missionaries Francisco Casanas de Jesus Maria, Fran- cisco Hidalgo, Isidro Felix de Espinosa, and Caspar Jose de Solis, SWANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 3 the Historia and Memorias of Juan Agustin Morfi, and the relation of La Salle's companion, Henri Joutel. The translations from Joutel are my own. Those from Casanas, Hidalgo, and Espinosa are mainly the ones made by Miss Hatcher; those from Soils are mainly those of Miss Kress, while those from Morfi's Memorias are essentially reproductions of the translations printed by Chabot, but I have found it necessary to introduce certain alterations and in one or two cases these are extensive. For the his- torical sections I have drawn upon numerous authors, early and late. I am particularly indebted to Dr. Castaneda for his assistance on many occasions and particularly in securing a photocopy of the Letter and Report of Fray Francisco Casanas. I am indebted to my friend, the late David I. Bushnell, Jr., for his interest and suggestions and for the use of the sketch by Eastman which constitutes plate 15. After most of the above was in type. Dr. Parsons' memoir made its appearance, its modest title, Notes on the Caddo, undoubtedly con- cealing the fact that it contains about all the ethnological material that may be expected from the remnants of the many tribes now covered by the name \"Caddo.\" Of course, one can never say that one has secured absolutely all such information, but it may be confidently assumed that this is as perfect a sample of these fragmentary materials as will ever be recovered. That which remains will be acculturation processes rather than the restoration of what we are pleased to call, but never is, primitive. Comparison of this with the insight into the customs and usages of the tribe furnished by the missionaries is interesting as showing in what direction and to what extent cultural losses have taken place, although there are preserved also data from the earlier time which were entirely missed by them. As might have been anticipated, the ancient tribal cult connected with the temples has disappeared along with those collective functions such as are assumed by our Depart- ments of State and War. The Ghost Dance and Peyote cults have acted powerfully to affect the former and immersion in white institu- tions the latter. What have survived are the minor social relations between individuals and families, much of the kinship terminology, customs connected with naming and marriage, with the relations brought about by marriage, some of the burial customs, and customs connected with medical practices and witchcraft. Notes regarding certain of these will appear below under the separate heads. DESIGNATIONS The name Caddo is applied collectively to a people now regarded as a single tribe, but which, when they were first known to Europeans, consisted of something like 25 tribes forming 3 or more confederated 4 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull. 132 groups besides some units that held themselves entirely separate. The largest confederation was in eastern Texas in the present coun- ties of Nacogdoches, Rusk, Cherokee, and Houston. They called themselves Hasinai, a word which appears in the historical narratives as Asinai, Assoni, Asenay, Cenis, etc., but since these tribes were on terms of closest intimacy and were constantly calling one another \"friends,\" or \"allies,\" the Spaniards early heard the native term meaning \"friends\" used and came to apply it to them. This word appears in the forms texas, texias, tejas, tejias, tei/sas, techan, etc., and hence these Indians were called Texas Indians and the word was subsequently applied to the province of Texas and taken over by the American colonists as that of the Republic and later State of Texas. The x in this word was not, however, pronounced by the Spaniards as it is in English. Sometimes it was made equivalent to Spanish j, which resembles German ch, but I have usually found that in the early Spanish narratives it is employed for the English sh, for which the Spanish language provides no specific sign. This fact is often indicated by synonyms which use s or ch, just as we find in the present instance. I, therefore, believe that the original pronunciation of Texas was Tayshas, although, as Bolton suggests, it may have been Taychas. It was not a specific term for the Hasinai but became such by accident. Casafias says: I notice that this name Tejas includes all the friendly tribes. The name is common to all of them, even though their language may be different. And, since this name is a general term, it must be used for no other reason than to indicate the long-standing friendship which they entertain towards each other. And, therefore, among all these tribes \"Tejias\" means friends. [Casa- fias, 1927, p. 286.] And Soils: We crossed the San Pedro River and afterwards came to a village that was very large and thickly settled with the Tejas Indians. This name comes from the word tecJii, which in our language means friend, and so Tejas Indians is the same as saying friendly Indians. [Soils, 1931, p. 60.] Bolton considers the terms \"Texas\" and \"Hasinai\" at some length : The testimony of the sources warrants the conclusion that before the coming of the Spaniards the word Texas, variously spelled by the early writers, had wide currency among the tribes of eastern Texas and perhaps over a large area; that its usual meaning was \"friends,\" or, more technically, \"allies\"; and that it was used by the tribes about the early missions, at least, to whom especially it later became attached as a group name, to designate a large number of tribes who were customarily allied against the Apaches. In this sense, the Texas included tribes who spoke different languages and who were as widely separated as the Red River and the Rio Grande. It seems that the Neches-Angelina tribes designated did not apply the term restrictively to them- ewANToN] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 5 selves as a name, but that they did use it in a very untechnical way as a form of greeting, like \"hello, friend,\" with which they even saluted Spaniards after their advent . . . The name Texas has been variously applied by writers, but it was most commonly used by the Spaniards, from whom the French and the English borrowed it, to designate those tribes of the upper Neches and the Angelina valleys, and this in spite of their knowing full well that among the natives the word had a wider application that has been indicated. Thei'e are many varia- tions from this usage in Spanish writings, it is true, but this, nevertheless, is the ordinary one. As a tribal name the term was sometimes still further narrowed to apply to a single tribe. When this occurred, it was most commonly used to designate the Hainai, the head tribe of the group in question, but some- times it was applied to the Nabedache tribe. As a geographical term, the name Texas was first extended from these Neches-Angelina tribes to their immediate country. Thus for the first quarter of a century of Spanish occupation, the phrase \"the Province of Texas\" referred only to the country east of the Trinity River ; but with the founding of the San Antonio settlements the term was extended westward, more in harmony with its native meaning, to the Medina River, and then gradually to all of the territory included within the present State of Texas. While the name Texas, as used by the tribes in the eastern portion of the State, was thus evidently a broad and indefinite term applied to many and unrelated tribes occupying a wide area, it is clear that the native group name for most of the tribes about the missions in the Neches and Angelina valleys was Hasinai, or Asinai. Today the term Hasinai is used by the Caddoans on the reservations to include not only the survivors of these Neches-Angelina tribes, but also the survivors of the tribes of the Sabine and Red River County. It seems from the sources, however, that in the early days the term was more properly limited to the former group. In strictest usage, indeed, the earliest writers did not include all of these. A study of contemporary evidence shows that at the first contact of Europeans with these tribes and for a long time thereafter writers quite generally made a distinction between the Hasinai (Asinai, Cenis, etc.) and the Kadohadacho (Caddodacho) group; these confederacies, for such they were in the Indian sense of the term, were separated by a wide stretch of uninhabited territory extending between the upper Angelina and the Red River in the neighborhood of Texarkana; their separateness of organization was positively aflSrmed, and the details of the inner constitution of both groups were more or less fully described ; while in their relations with the Europeans they were for nearly a century dealt with as separate units. Nevertheless, because of the present native use of the term and some early testimony that can not be dis- regarded, I would not at present assert unreservedly that the term formerly was applied by the natives only to the Neches-Angelina group. If, as seems highly probable, this was the case, in order to preserve the native usage we should call these tribes the Hasinai ; if not, then the Southern Hasinai. The name Hasinai, like Texas, was sometimes narrowed in its application to one tribe, usually the Hainai. But occasionally the notion appears that there was an Hasinai tribe distinct from the Hainai. This, however, does not seem to have been the case. As now used by the surviving Hasinai and Caddos, Hasinai means \"our own folk,\" or, in another sense, \"Indians.\" [Bolton, 1908, pp. 250-252.] Just as the Hainai were sometimes regarded as the Hasinai tribe par excellence, so in the confederacy on Red River were the Kado- hadacho eminent above all the rest. The name is derived from kadi, 6 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull. 132 or rather kaadi, ka'-ede, meaning \"chief,\" and Kadohadacho signifies \"real chiefs.\" Strictly, it was applied to one of a group of four bands (five, if one counts in the Cahinnio) but was first extended in the con- tracted form Caddo to all of the bands of this group and later to all of the related tribes, including the Hasinai. It is likely that the fact that it prevailed was owed as much to the simple character of the word as to the dominant position of the tribe. Since Caddo appeared as the name of a group of languages in Gal- latin's classification (Gallatm, 1836) a few pages before his similar use of \"Pawnee,\" it was selected by Powell in the form \"Caddoan\" to desig- nate a linguistic stock which included, besides the Caddo in the broad- est sense of the term, the Kichai, the Wicliita, with the Tawakoni, Waco, and their allies, the Pawnee, and the Arikara. The Adai were at first supposed to constitute a distinct family called Adaizan, but very shortly the connection of their language with Caddo was demon- strated by Dr. A. S. Gatschet. (Powell, 1891, pp. 45-46, 58-62). In the present study I shall use Caddoan as the name of the stock, Caddo to cover all the southern tribes the remnants of which are now classed under that term, and Kadohadacho for the group of four tribes on Red River which included the Kadohadacho proper, the Nasoni, Upper Natchitoches, and Nanatsoho. When I wish to designate the original Kadohadacho I will call it the Kadohadacho tribe or town. Following are names applied to the Caddo by various tribes: Arapalio: Tani'banen, Taui'bangniua, Tani'batha (Mooney). Cheyenne: Ota's-ita'niuw' (Mooney), U-tai-sI-ta (Ten Kate), Utaseta (Gatschet). Choctaw: Ka-lox-M-tce (Ten Kate). Comanche: At'-ta-wits (Ten Kate), Witune (Gatschet). Creek: Kul-hul-atsi (Grayson). Kiowa: Ma'se'p (Mooney), Mosi (Ten Kate). Omaha: Pa'thiÂ°wagabe (Fletcher and La Flesche). Pawnee: iSdawika, ^rawika (Gatschet). Osage: Hi^-sha (La Flesche). Quapaw: Soudaye (La Harpe), Su'-d0e (Dorsey). Tonkawa: Kalu-xnftdshu, Karo-xnjldshu, KSsseya, Kasseye'-i (Gatschet). Wichita: Da'sh-i, Dg'sa, Ni'ris-hari's-kl'riki (Mooney), Tfishash, Tawitskash (Gatschet).* The Choctaw and Creek names and the two first Tonkawa terms are corruptions of Kadohadacho. The Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Kiowa terms signify \"Pierced Noses,\" and the Caddo were so-called because of their custom of wearing nasal ornaments. The gesture indicating them in the sign language refers to the same custom. The Omaha name means \"Black Pawnee.\" Â» Hodge, 1907, 1910, ArtMea Caddoan, Caddo, Kadohadacho, etc. ; Mooney, 1896, pp. 953, 1043, 1081, 1102-1103.

THE CADDO TRIBES â¢ (Figure 1) Early in the seventeenth century, when Caddo came to the atten- tion of French and Spanish explorers and traders for the first time except for the De Soto expedition, most of them were gathered into three or four loose confederations. The Hasinai, often called Texas by the Spaniards, were the largest of these, occuping the greater part of the land now included in the Texas counties of Nacogdoches, Kusk, Cherokee, and Houston. The Kadohadacho, or Caddo proper, were at the bend of Red River in southwestern Arkansas and northeastern Texas. A third group lay farther south about the present city of Natchitoches, La., wliich perpetuates the name of its leading tribe. Between these last two lay a tribe known as Yatasi which at an earlier day appears to have belonged to still another group, but shortly after first contact with the whites it separated into two bands one of which united with the Kadohadacho and the other with the Natchitoches. Besides these groups there were certain tribes which had an in- dependent status though they were related to the others. The Cahinnio lived in a town on the upper Ouachita in 1687 and in the sixteenth century had probably been settled along Caddo River and about Caddo Gap, where they became known to the followers of De Soto as Tula Indians. They were, it is believed, closely connected with the Kadohadacho, with whom they undoubtedly ultimately united. The Adai lived in the neighborhood of the present Robeline, La., and camped at times along Red River above Natchitoches. They spoke a divergent dialect of Caddo and seem to have had a ruder culture than the other tribes excepting only the Eyeish. They had the unique distinction of harboring within their territory the first capital of Texas, and this, curiously enough, fell outside of Texas' later boundaries. The Eyeish lived almost directly west of the Adai, about the present San Augustine, Tex. They are called barbarous by early writers and were looked down upon by the surrounding Indians. 8 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bdll. 132 The tribes above enumerated, excepting the two last, did not live in groups which maintained the same constituent elements unchanged from generation to generation. Several, as noted in the case of the Yatasi, split into two or more divisions which, from time to time, established new associations. These will be noted as we take up the several groups. In the De Soto documents the following tribes or \"provinces\" are mentioned which were undoubtedly Caddo: Tula, Amaye or Maye, Naguatex, Hacanac, Nissohone, Lacane, Nondacao, Hais (or Aays), Soacatino (or Xuacatino or Xacatin), Guasco, Naquiscoga, Nagaca- hoz. Daycao is given as the name of a river and the word is un- doubtedly from the Caddo language. From the De Soto map we may add Animay and perhaps Cenoa. The word Tula is probably not from Caddo but it is believed that the province so named was oc- cupied by the tribe later called Cahinnio. Amaye or Maye seems to contain the Caddo word signifying a male human being. It may have been recorded by the Spaniards from the misunderstanding of an informant. Naguatex or, as we should pronounce it, Nawataysh, signifies \"place of salt\" and the people so designated may be set down as a branch of that tribe later known as Namidish. Hacanac, which appears but once, msij be identical with Lacane, and the latter certainly is a form of Nacanish. The Nissohone or Nisohone were the later Nasoni, the Nondacao the later Anadarko, and Hais the later Eyeish. Guasco appears in a list of Hasinai tribes given by Casanas, but I am unable to identify the Soacatino, Naquiscoga, and Nagacahoz although they bear undoubted Caddo names. Joutel men- tions a tribe allied to the Hasinai called Daquio whose name is pos- sibly related to that of the river Daycao. In Animay we seem to have Hainai, perhaps with maye, \"male person,\" added. Cenoa might be an attempt at Hasinai. (Bourne, 1904, vol. 1, pp. 135-141, 169-183; vol. 2, pp. 32-34, 148; Kobertson, 1933, pp. 194-201, 238- 257, map p. 418; Garcilaso, 1723; Final Keport of the U. S. De Soto Expedition Commission, 1939, pp. 230, 261-263, map 1.) Joutel in 1687 gives a long list of tribes said to be allied to the Hasinai and another long list of tribes hostile to them. In the first of these I am able to identify the following as Caddo : Joutel list Identity Cenis Hasinai Nassoni Nasoni Natsohos Nanatsoho Cadodaquis Kadohadacho Natchittos Natchitoches Nondaco Anadarko Nadaco Anadarko (?)

Jesus Maria de Casanas, after enumerating the nine tribes which made up the Hasinai nation, gives another list which partly repeats the first but contains some names which it is difficult to identify with any in his first list and he adds some new ones, including the tribes of the Caddo group and two non-Caddo tribes, the Kichai and the Bidai.

Towards the southwest he lists still another but again it contains no Caddo.

In his declaration before the Spanish authorities, St. Denis, who should have known these Indians well, stated that there were 11 Caddo tribes, the chief of which were the Asinai and their allies, the Navedachos, Nacaos, Namidis, Nacogdoches, Ainays, Nadacocos, Nacitos, and Nachoos. The last two belonged to the Kadohadacho, the Nadacocos were evidently the Anadarko, and the others are all readily recognizable except that we do not know what tribes were included under the \"Asinai and their allies,\" though they were perhaps the Neches and Nasoni. While the greater number of Casaiias' tribes are identifiable in subsequent lists, there are some which seem to disappear completely after his time. Among these are the Nechavi, but Nachawi (signi- fying \"Osage orange\") was the native name of Neches River and this was probably a band of Neches Indians or a syononym for the Neches Tribe itself since both are placed on Neches River not many miles apart. The Nacachau may be the Naquiscoga of the De Soto chronicles but it seems to have disappeared from history at an early date. Bolton thinks that the Nasayaya were a part of the Nasoni. The Guasco are important because of the fact that De Soto's followers met them in 1542. The Cataye are not heard of again. They may have been identical with the Caxo and Cachae. The Tadivas and Nabeyeyxa also cannot be identified after this time unless it is possible that the latter is a synonym for Nabedache. We seem to get hints that the complication exhibited by Caddo tribes was late and that, had we more data regarding them, we should find that there were actually a relatively small number of tribes and that the complication arose because these had separated into two or more sections the constituents of which not infrequently changed their associations. One case of the sort is supplied by the Yatasi, which divided at a very late date, part settling with the Natchitoches and part with the Kadohadacho. There was also a lower and an upper Natchitoches town connected respectively with the same larger groupings. While the Nasoni formed one town of the Kadohadacho, which sometimes bears their name, there was a second close to the Hasinai but, significantly enough, not rated as a true Hasinai di- B WANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 11 vision. Indeed, Bolton (1908, p. 270) suggests a third which ap- pears under the name Nasayaha or Nasayaya. At least these last lived close to the true Nasoni. The Nacono may also have been divided. We hear of a tribe called Nacao not reckoned among the true Hasinai but located on a creek called today Naconicho. A tribe called Lacane was encountered by Moscoso some distance farther east and it is altogether probable that it was a part of the same people. In other words, it looks as though the Nacono, Nacao, Naconicho, and Lacane were fragments of one tribe, and to these may be added Mooney's \"Nakanawan.\" I was told, indeed, by Caddo Jake that Nakanawan, or \"Nakahanawan,\" as he pronounced it, was another name for the Hainai but the Nacanish very likely united with them. It is possible that we should add the Nacachau to this list, a tribe which disappears very early in Hasinai history. Bolton (1908, pp. 260-261) has demonstrated that the Hainai were also called Cachae by Casaiias â in his later list referred to as Caxo, or, possibly Cataye. My own informants stated that the Hainai had several different names. A tribe early associated with the Hasinai, yet not constituting, according to Casaiias, one of the original group, was the Nadaco or Anadarko. It is evidently the one he calls Nadan in the list just quoted and goes back to the time of Moscoso, when we have the name in the form Nondacao. It retained its designation until a very late period and gave it finally to Anadarko, Okla. More puzzling than any of these cross-connections is that which is suggested between Casanas' Nabadacho and Nabiti, listed as two of the original Hasinai group. The first of these, usually called Nabe- dache but spelled more correctly by Casaiias in another place Nabay- dacho, was located on San Pedro Creek and it was in the Nabedache town that the first Spanish mission was established. The Nabedache are sometimes called San Pedros. The Nabiti he also calls Naviti, and they are evidently the Nabiri of St. Denis. But Bolton notes that this tribe seems to occupy a spot where Joutel found a tribe called Noa- diche, and this latter appears to bear the same name as the Naouydiche of La Harpe, a band of whom was found in 1719 well north of Red River in what is now Oklahoma (Bolton, 1908, p. 270; Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 6, p. 286; Beaurain, 1831, p. 204). In a French list in a letter by the Due de Linares (Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 6, p. 217) , we find the form Namidis, and knowing that one of the dialectic dif- ferences between eastern and western Caddo was a change from m to 10^ and that h and v are often used for w in Spanish, we seem to find a family relationship between the names Nabiti, Naviti, Nabiri, Namidis, Noadiche (for Nowadish) and Naouydiche. To these must also be added the Naguatex of the De Soto narratives which would be transliterated in English as Nawataysh. This does not prove, of 12 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull. 132 course, that these Nabiti-Namidis people were related to the Nabe- dache. The names are distinguished in later times, the former mean- ing \"place of salt\" while the latter is said to be the term for a berry like a blackberry borne on thorny trees. The philologist Gatschet, however, asserts that the ancient name of the Nabedache was Nawa- dishe (Hodge, 1910, vol. 2, art. Nabedache), and if his source of information was reliable, the two would appear to be brought to- gether. Such an identification would reconcile two confusing state- ments by Morfi (1935, pt. 1, p. 82; 1932, p. 5), one to the effect that the Texas proper inhabited the banks of the San Pedro though that was the country of the Nabedache when the San Pedro mission was founded, and the other that the Nabedache lived about the head waters of the Neches. It is true that Casailas does not locate his Nabiti on the Neches but he places them to the north of the other Hasinai townsâ except the Nadaco and Nasoni which lay farther east â and the Nabiti were probably nearer than any others to the headwaters of the Neches River. Undoubtedly we have two tribes called Nabedache and Namidi or Namidish distinguished at a very early period, and it must always remain doubtful whether they stemmed from one original group or whether the resemblance in their names is purely accidental. To sum up, then, we seem to have the following original Hasinai tribes: Hainai, Neches (or Neche), Nacogdoche, Nacono or Nacao or Naconish, Namidish (Nabiti) or Nawidish, Nasoni, Anadarko, and perhaps Nabedache, two of which, the Nasoni and Anadarko, were not reckoned as original Hasinai tribes while two others, the Nacono and Namidish, were represented by divisions outside of the Hasinai. The Kadohadacho confederation presents to us fewer difficulties. When first visited in 1687 it was found to consists of four tribes, Kadohadacho, Nanatsoho, Nasoni, and Natchitoches â the last two represented also in the Hasinai and Natchitoches confederations re- spectively â which lived close together and to which a fifth tribe, the Cahinnio, was sometimes added though this was established near the upper Ouachita. In early historic times part of the Yatasi were added to these after that tribe had been disrupted by the Chickasaw (Beaurain, 1831, pp. 185-186). The location of the Nasoni town in this group was pretty certainly that of the \"Principal Caddo village\" on the King map (pi. 2), and the site of the Kadohadacho village the \"Old Caddo village,\" northeast of it beyond Red River. The Natchitoches group consisted primarily of the tribe which gave it the name and the Doustioni. By 1690 a part of the Ouchita of the lower Ouachita River had joined these, and it may be assumed that the remainder did so at a later period but we have no information on that point. Tonti speaks of a tribe called \"Capiche\" as consti- SWANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 13 tuting part of this group but none bearing a similar name appears in any later document and it may be assumed that the tribe intended was the Doustioni or that it is a bad misspelling of Nakasa (or Nakase) (Cox, 1905, vol. 1, p. 45 ; Beaurain, 1931, pp. 32-33). The identity of these Nakasa causes some difficulty since they are mentioned only by Bienville {in Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 4, p. 439) in the account of his expedition from the Taensa villages to Red River in 1700 and in the account of this same expedition by Beaurain (1931, p. 33). The only Indians encountered on this part of the river by later travelers before reaching the Yatasi were Adai, and Bienville himself, in his discussion of the Indian tribes of Louisiana written about 1718, although making mention of his earlier expedition, drops the Nakasa from his narrative. He speaks merely of the Natchitoches, Doustioni, and Yatasi (those already brought down to unite with the two former) and the Adai living by themselves 7 leagues west (Bienville ms.). Since the Nakasa were found close to the Yatasi, they may have been a part of that tribe, a form of the name with the Caddo prefix na- and the k a misreading or miscopying of f. Such an identification is strengthened somewhat by Tonti, who encountered a tribe in about the same region which he calls \"Natches\" (Cox, 1905, vol. 1, p. 45). This may be interpreted as Yatasi plus the prefix na- and with the loss of a vowel between t and ch. The ch in French is, of course, pronounced like English sh and would therefore approximate s. The loss of the vowel is rendered probable by the mention by Iberville of a tribe on Red River called \"Natache.\" Such analyses may seem far- fetched to the ordinary reader, but not to one familiar with the manner in which Indian terms became distorted in copying. The name of the Avoyels tribe, for instance, appears in one or two documents as \"Houjets\" and in that case the identification is undoubted. The Yatasi, as has been said above, lived at an early period mid- way between the Natchitoches and Kadohadacho and subsequently separated into two parts, one of which united with each of these others. At one time they themselves may have constituted a group of the tribes since Tonti speaks of the three villages of \"Yataches, Nadas, and Choye\" which were \"together\" (Cox, 1905, vol. 1, p. 45). Tlie Nadas may possibly have been part of the Adai, the name here carrying the na- prefix. The Choye were seemingly the \"Chaye,\" listed by Joutel among enemies of the Hasinai (Margry, 1875-86, vol. 3, p. 409), but this helps us little in the determination of their relationship except that we may assume from the association they were a Caddo band. Lesser and Weltfish (1932, pp. 13-14), very recent students of the living Caddo, found the following tribes remembered : Hainai, Nabe- dache, Anadarko, Natchitoches, Yatasi, Nacogdoche, Haish, and Ka- 14 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [boll, isi dohadacho. Thej' list one more, evidently referring to a band living on the Kianiichi Kiver and named for it, though this may have been snbstituted for a more ancient appellation. Mooney's list (1896, pp. 1002, 1093), made abont 40 years earlier, contains no name resembling Kiamiohi but adds those of the Adai, the Nakanawan (probably in- tended for the Nakanish), the I'milha, a band of Quapaw, and the Yowa'ni, a band of Choctaw. These last are named from the sonthernmost Choctaw town from which it is to be assumed many of them came. The I'maha undoubtedly represented a hold-over from the time when the Quapaw Tribe lived beside the Kadohadacho and consisted of individuals which remained behind after the rest of their nation had gone to Oklahoma. (See pp. 86 to 89.) Lesser and Weltfish quote native informants to the effect that at one time all bands of the Caddo spoke divergent dialects except the Hainai and Nabedacho whose speech was identical. In fact, they claimed that the Xabedache Avere a branch of the Hainai rather than of the Caddo in general. The Hainai were the largest band and the Kadohadacho the second largest. They continue: The divorgence of Hainai dialeotioally from Caddo proper Is supported by a little evidence still obtainable in the form of a few remembered differences in words. These are of two types: Slight phonetic dift'erences of a dialectic character: and complete difference of word. In some cases the latter type of difference suggests adoption of foreign words, particularly of Spanish words; such oceur prominently for words which must be relatively recent in use, such HS the word for horse. In Caddo pro^H^r. the vocabulary shows instances of multiple synonymy, and more than one word for the same object, which may prove to have resulted from two factors : Adoption of foreign words, as Spanish, and preservation of usages of a number of the Caddo bands in the contemporary Caddo proper. Hainai kinship terms and usages also differ from those of Caddo proper. [Lesser and Weltfish. 1032, pp. 13-14.] By Caddo proper they mean the Caddo of the Kadohadacho \"which seems to have gnuiually eliminated whatever former dialectic differ- entiation existed, in favor of a common speech.'' The ancient sepa- ration between the Kadohadacho and Hasinai seems to have been perpetuated to the present day in the northern and southern bands of Caddo i-eported by Dr. Parsons (1941, pp. 8-9). This information agrees in almost every particular with what I learned when I visited the Caddo in 1912. Caddo Jake, one of the oldest of the Caddo at that time and one of the few Indians who knew the eastern or Natchitoches dialect, said that Xabedache was the same as Hainai, and that the Anadarko (Xadako) and Kado- hadacho were \"somewhat related.\" He affirmed that in some places you cannot understand Hainai, assuming that yon are a speaker of Kadohadacho. The Xacogdoche was the same as the Anadarko. He B WANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 15 added that he had heard the Adai, or \"Hadai\" as he called them, and the Haish converse and that their languages were \"about the same.\" Another Caddo, White Bread, confirmed the close relationship between Hainai and Nabedache, and held that the Kadohadacho, Nacogdoche, and Anadarko were related but considered the last mentioned a little different from the first two. In assigning the Adai to the same group he was evidently in error. Caddo Jake stated that the Natchitoches and Yatasi languages were the same and gave tlie following examples of their dialect:^ Natcuitoches Kadohadacho English AND Yatasi ha'dlkya do'haya now kya'ashik wa'a.sha I can't I'ntcl hayo'k'o waasha't okana'siwa I am not going to talk i'mr Iwl' eagle hi'dik'u nAsaiklQ'na in the evening ni'nuwa na'ba in the night hlnti'sak' sa'onts sao' bouee (sao also=a tent) koho'n ko'ho alligator wata'n ba'ta flsh tc !a6'k t !ao'x beaver ki'din yo'sa rouskrat na'mtsl na'otsl bear mado\" v/ado\" v/ildcat do' do'o rabbit ta'njl* t&'Bkhh buffalo do'ot dat mouse sl'n'ank'ai ci'wax f-quirrel h^'dik !ya hinik tsik kom- â¢ hame'tcal tca- now I am very tired payO'kin yo'konan of talking kiwa'yol' (Sp. co&aZJo) di'tama horse dr dl'ltsl dog kiwa'yoi'do'tsi do'titx colt kamta'gldan haha'otsaso (or) ha'owldawind I'tok' nI'k!o fire kato'k ! koko water ma'dat wa'dat dirt kQ'naklskaya'mta'ksa kwiska'oka east akani'gldaha'gadlsa ha'nlda'dis creek de'mas de'was pine The words for quail, duck, tame goose, a kind of wild goose, pigeon, parrot, chicken hawk :, screech owl. two other species of owl, crane, Â» The letters In the above words and those following carry values similar to those asso- ciat(!d with them in English : a, d, the sound of a in \"barn\" ; d like a in \"ability\" ; e like ai In \"fail\" ; I like ee In \"seek\" ; i like 1 in \"it\" ; o, 0, the sound of o in \"roU\" ; 6 like u in \"pull\"; m, a spirant; ', a brcatliing; ', a pause; /, givfs an explosive sound to the consonant preceding ; c is like nh In \"shall\" ; tc like tch in \"catch.\" 16 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull. 132 heron, wolf, fox, south, west, north, doctor, cedar, ash, elm, walnut, oak, tobacco, apple, sweetpotato, snake, deer, panther, raccoon, opos- sum, antelope, elk, and rat were said to be the same in all dialects.

This might mean that they all ran into connecting bays. POPULATION Statements regarding the population of the various Caddo groups in early times are very general and very unsatisfactory. We will take them in chronological order, considering first the Hasinai, then the Kadohadacho and Natchitoches groups, and finally the Adai and Eyeish. Father Anastasius Douay, in his account of La Salle's expedition into the Hasinai country in 1686, says of the confederation, which he terms a \"village,\" it \"is one of the largest and most populous that I have seen in America. It is at least twenty leagues long, not that it is evenly inhabited, but in hamlets of ten or twelve cabins, form- ing cantons, each with a different name\" (Cox, 1905, vol. 1, p. 232). He adds that there were two families to a house, but Joutel, during his passage through the same country a year later, notes that the s WANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 17 grass houses of the Hasinai held \"usually eight or ten families, some [dwellings] being sixty feet in diameter.\" The houses of the Nasoni were not as tall as those of the Hasinai proper but it is not clear that they accommodated fewer people (Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 3, pp. 345, 393). In 1691 the Spanish Franciscan missionary Casaiias says that these people were \"numerous.\" Farther on he informs us that \"some three or four hundred persons â more or less â ^liad died in that prov- ince during the month of March\" of the same year in consequence of an epidemic. Still farther on he is more detailed â and somewhat more moderate : According to the information I have received about three thousand persons among all the friendly tribes of the Tejias must have died during the epidemic which the Lord sent during the month of March, 1691. The disease was worse in some provinces than in others. As to our own province, I have already stated that the deaths probably reached the number of three hundred â in other provinces the number was sometimes greater, sometimes less. [Casanas, 1927, pp. 294, 303.] As he has already classed as \"Tejias\" all the Caddo tribes of every connection as well as the Kichai and Bidai, the larger figure must be interpreted as applying to them. In 1699 a Canadian who had lived several years among the Hasinai reported that they \"form but one village and the same nation\" and he estimated \"that they do not exceed six hundred or seven hundred men.\" [Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 4, p. 316.] Here the Hasinai alone seem to be meant, and they are called the most populous tribe of the region as they were by the missionaries Casanas and Hidalgo. According to Eamon, the four missions result- ing from his expedition of 1716 \"would comprise from four thousand to five thousand persons of all ages and both sexes\" (Bolton, 1908, p. 274). In the same year the missionary Espinosa recorded in his diary that he believed \"the Indians grouped around the three Quere- teran missions, not including the mission among the Nacogdoche and the Nacao, would number three thousand\" ; and after a residence there of some years he estimated the number of persons within the range of each mission at \"about one thousand\" (Bolton, 1908, p. 274). Eamon's estimate is probably the basis of Morfi's statement (1935, p. 187) that \"over 5000 Indians\" were gathered into the missions established by the former. A slight addition should be made to the sedentary Hasinai population by adding that \"Naouydiche\" band met by La Harpe on a northern branch of Red River. The chief had 40 warriors under him which would indicate 100 to 150 souls. (Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 6, p. 286) . In a note to the original manuscript of his History, Morfi adds that the Nacogdoche Indians were \"divided into twenty -two rancherias, in which there were one hundred and twenty w^arriors.\" The mission \"was established in the center of these rancherias, which spread for a 18 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [boll. 132 distance of ten leagues from south to north\" (Morfi, 1935, vol. 1, p. 230) . Populations of 400 to 450 and 100 to 150 are indicated. Bolton furnishes the following figures from the records of the Aguayo expedi- tion of the year 1721 : When Aguayo in that year re-established the missions that had been aban- doned some two years before, he made a general distribution of presents and clothing among the Indians at the different villages. At the mission of San Francisco de los Neches he gave the Neche chief the Spanish baston, token of authority, and \"clothed entirely one hundred and eighty-eight men, women, and children.\" . . . West of the Neches Asuayo had been visited by a hundred Nacono from down the river. At the mission of Concepci6n he requested the Hainai chief, Cheocas by name, to collect all his people. This took some time, as they were widely scattered, but several days later they were assembled, and Aguayo gave clothing and other presents to four hundred, including, pos- sibly, eighty Kadohadachos, who happened to be there on a visit [in fact to confer with St. Denis]. Similarly, at the Nacogdoche mission he provided clothing \"for the chief and all the rest,\" a total of three hundred and ninety; and at the Nasoni mission for three hundred. This gives us a total of less than fourteen hundred Indians who came to the missions during Aguayo's entrada to take advantage of the ever welcome presents. This number ap- parently included the majority of the five most important tribes, and probably Included some from the neighboring smaller tribes attached to the missions. [Bolton 1908, p. 275.] In 1777-1779 De Mezieres discovered that the Nasoni and Anadarko together had 25 men, the Nabedache 30, and the \"Texas\" (presum- ably the Hainai) 80 (Bolton, 1914, vol. 2, pp. 145, 263). Morfi (about 1783) notes that the Texas (Hainai) had 80 warriors, and the Nabedache were reduced to less than 40, but that the Nacogdoche numbered 300 warriors. He mentions also a tribe called \"Aliijitos\" almost as numerous as the last named but these were probably the Kichai (Morfi, 1935, p. 82). In 1805 Sibley {in Amer. State Pap., Indian Affairs, 1832, p. 722) reported about 40 men of the Anadarko, and 80 each of the Nabedache and Hainai. The Cincinnati Gazette (1818-20) states, on the authority of an Indian agent recently re- turned from Natchitoches, that the Anadarko numbered 120-130 in- cluding 30 warriors, the Nacogdoche 150 including 40 warriors, the San Pedro (Nabedache?) 130 with 30 warriors, the \"Naradachoes\" (Namidish?) 100 with 20 warriors, and the Texas (Neches or Hainai) 150 with 30 warriors (Sibley, 1922, p. 96). It is probable that the Texas were really the Hainai although the \"Eynies\" are said to be \"dispersed and mingled with other tribes of the vicinity.\" The Mexican Padilla (1820) has a somewhat exaggerated idea of the sizes of the tribes. He gives the Nacogdoche a total of 200, the Nadacos (Anadarko) 200, the San Pedro (presumably Nabedache) 500, the Texas (Hainai?) 400, and a tribe he calls \"Yuganis\" 150.^ In 1828 â¢ Padilla, 1919, pp. 49, 52 ; the \"Tuganfa\" may have been the Yowani band of Choctaw. swANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 19 Sanchez says there were 29 families of Anadarko (Sanchez, 1926, p. 279), and in 1934 Ahnonte (1925, p. 222) enumerates 100 \"Tejas\" and 300 Nacogdoche. In 1837 the Caddo, Anadarko, Nacogdoche, Nabedache and Eyeish together were said to number 225 (Muckleroy, 1922, p. 232). In 1847 Governor Burnet estimates about 50 families each of the Hainai, San Pedro, Nabedache, and Nacogdoche (School- craft, 1851, vol. 1, pp. 39-40). From another source we get 450 Anadarko in 1847 and in 1849, 450 Hainai (Schoolcraft, 1857, vol. 6, pp. 686-687). The first careful census was made by Jesse Stem in 1851 and showed 202 Anadarko and 113 Hainai, but a few others were then living apart in the Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory. There were over 100 warriors (Indian Affairs, 1851, p. 261) . In 1855 Neighbors reported 205 Anadarko but seems to have omitted the Hainai though in a letter to him Hill notes that there were then about 200 Waco, Tawakoni, Kadohadacho, and Anadarko north of Eed River (Indian Affairs, 1855, pp. 178, 184). In 1856 the number of Indians on the Brazos reservation had increased to 948 but the tribal affiliations are not in evidence (Indian Affairs, 1856, p. 173). In 1857 Neighbors reported 210 Anadarkos but some Caddo were still north of Red River (Indian Affairs, 1857, p. 265). When the Indians were removed to the north in 1859 they numbered 1,050 but the tribal affiliations were not recorded (Indian Affairs, 1859, p. 328), After the outbreak of the Civil War most of the Caddo fled to Kansas, and in 1864 150 Hainai were there (Indian Affairs, 1864, p. 319). In 1872, some years after their return to the reservation, 85 Hainai were counted in addition to the Caddo proper (Indian Affairs, 1872, p. 254). In 1873 the number had sunk to 60 but they were not separately enumerated again until 1876, when there were 30 (Indian Affairs, 1873, p. 224; 1876, p. 64). In 1877 the Caddo, Hainai, and some Delaware had a population of 643, which had been increased over the preceding year by the addition of 63 former absentees, principally Hainai (Indian Affairs, 1877, p. 112). In 1878 the Hainai are mentioned but not enumerated separately and they are omitted from all subsequent censuses of the Caddo population. Undoubtedly some of the Hasinai were returned under the heading of Caddo ; not all were covered by the name Hainai. If the Cahinnio are to be regarded as part of the Kadohadacho, Joutel's statement that they occupied 100 cabins in 1687 is the first in- formation vouchsafed us regarding the population of any part of this group, except that the De Soto chroniclers represent their supposed ancestors, the Tula Indians, as numerous (Robertson, 1933, p. 194; Bourne, 1904, vol. 1, p. 137). In 1718 Bienville (ms., see pp. 55-56 below) says that the Kadohadacho, under whom he seems to include 20 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull. 132 the Kichai, had about 200 men but that they had formerly counted 500-600. About the same time La Harpe estimated that there were then in the four Kadohadacho tribes, and including some Yatasi who had recently joined them, not more than 400 souls but that 10 years before they had counted 2,500 (Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 6, p. 264). In 1773 De Mezieres found 60 warriors among the Little Caddo, 10 more on the Prairie des Ennemis, and 90 among the Great Caddo (Bolton, 1914, vol. 2, p. 83) . He states that the great epidemic of 1777 had carried off more than 300 Kadohadacho, and about 1800 Sibley tells us that smallpox had destroyed about half of them. In 1805 the latter estimated 100 warriors belonging to the old nation, and as many more old men and strangers, and adds that there were 40 or 50 more women than men (Sibley, in Amer. State Pap., Indian Affairs, 1832, p. 721). An estimate dated about 1818-20 gives a Caddo population of 500 to 600 including 120 warriors (Sibley, 1922, p. 95). Padilla (1919, p. 49) raises the population figure to 2,000, perhaps including more tribes under that head, though he enumer- ates separately the Nacogdoche, Ais, San Pedro Indians, Texas, and Anadarko. Schoolcraft (1853, vol. 3, pp. 585, 596) gives a pop- ulation figure of 450 in 1825 and Peter B. Porter, 4 years later, the same. In 1834 Almonte estimates 500 over all and in 1836 there is another estimate of 250 warriors (Almonte, 1925, p. 222; Muckleroy, 1922, p. 241). However, a careful census by Stem, taken in 1851, showed 161 Caddo on the Brazos Reservation (Indian Affairs, 1851, p. 261) . As the Chickasaw Agent Upshaw had stated that there were then 167 Caddo among his people, the total at that time would seem to have been about 300 (Foreman, 1930 a, p. 181). In 1855 Neighbors reported 188 Caddo on the Brazos Reserve, and Hill re- ported that 200 Waco, Tawakoni, Caddo, and Hasinai were still north of Red River (Indian Affairs, 1855, pp. 178, 184). In 1856 the In- dians under Neighbors had increased to 948 but the tribes are not separately enumerated (Indian Affairs, 1856, p. 173). In 1857, 235 Caddo are returned, and still all had not been brought together, nor are we told what proportion of the 1,050 which Neighbors led out of Texas in 1859 were Caddo (Indian Affairs, 1857, p. 265). In 1864, after the greater part of the Caddo and Hasinai had fled to Kansas, there were 370 in that state (Indian Affairs, 1864, p. 319). In 1872, 392 were back on their old reservation, and in 1873, 401 are returned (Indian Affairs, 1872, p. 254; 1873, p. 224). In 1874 and 1875 they are not enumerated separately from the Hasinai (Hainai) and a band of Delaware, but in 1876 467 are separately listed (Indian Affairs, 1874, p. 100; 1875, p. 289; 1876, p. 64). In 1877 the Caddos, B WANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 21 including Hainai and Delaware, numbered 643 and the same figure is given in 1878 (Indian Affairs, 1877, p. 112; 1878, p. 112). In Beaurain's account (1831, pp. 32-33) of Bienville's expedition to the Natchitoches Indians and their allies in 1700, he states that the Natchitoches themselves had 200 men, the Doustioni 50 and the Yatasi, who had not yet settled with the Natchitoches and Kado- hadacho, 200 men more. In Bienville's own memoir of 1718 (ms., see p. 56), however, he says that the three tribes had 400 men when he visited them but that at date of writing they had been reduced to 80. La Harpe, who visited these people 1 year after Bienville pemied his memoir, states that they totaled 200 souls, but Beaurain in his account of La Harpe's expedition reduces this to 150 (Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 6, p. 254; Beaurain, 1831, p. 179). It is not clear whether the earlier estimates include the Ouachita or not, though as Bienville himself found part of them living on Ouachita River in a village of about 5 cabins and counting 70 men, it would seem as though they must have been left out of his later estimates of the Natchitoches (Margry, 1875-1886, vol. 4, p. 434). Part of the tribe had already joined the Natchitoches (Cox, 1905, vol. 1, pp. 44-45) and the rest probably followed them before 1718. It is, at any rate, a fair inference that the remnant are included in the later estimates of Bienville and La Harpe. In 1773 De Mezieres reports that there were only three warriors in the Yatasi town (Bolton, 1914, vol. 2, p. 78) , but in 1805 Sibley found 8 men there belonging to the original Yatasi tribe and 25 women besides children. Other men had come in, however, so that there were about 40 men altogether. The same year he reports that there were but 12 men and 19 women left of the Natchitoches (Sibley, m Amer. State Pap., Indian Affairs, 1832, pp. 722, 724). Schoolcraft (1853, vol. 3, p. 585) quotes a census taken in 1825 which reported 36 Yatasi and 25 Natchitoches. Some of these undoubtedly married with and became lost in the white and Negro population about them, but a part united with the larger bodies of Kadohadacho and Hasinai and followed their fortunes to Texas and Oklahoma. Caddo Jake, one of the principal informants of Mr. Mooney and myself, was a Natchitoches Indian. There now remain for consideration the two small aberrant tribes, the Adai and Eyeish. According to Beaurain (1813, p. 33), Bienville in 1700 visited an Adai village containing 50 warriors. In 1716 three French traders came upon an Adai village in which there were about 30 inhabitants (Beaurain, 1831, p. 135). Two years later, however, Bienville (ms., see p. 56) estimates 100 men alone. In 1721, accord- 22 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BOLL. 132 ing to Morfi, Aguayo found more than 400 Adai Indians (Morfi, 1935, pt. 1, p. 219). In 1805 Sibley (in Amer. State Pap., Indian Affairs, 1832, p. 722) reported that there were 20 men but a larger proportion of women. In 1825 an informant of Schoolcraft (1853, vol. 3, p. 585) gives the total Adai population as 27, and they are now entirely merged with the other Caddo. In 1716 the three Frenchmen mentioned above found that the Eyeish village consisted of 10 cabins (Beaurain, 1831, p. 135). The same year Morfi says there were \"seventy families settled in eight rancherias, occupying a distance of two leagues\" (Morfi, 1935, pt. 1, p. 230). In 1779 De Mezieres reported 20 families there (Bolton, 1914, vol. 2, p. 257). In 1801 most of this tribe is said to have been destroyed, but Sibley {in Amer. State Pap,, 1832, pp. 96, 722c) reported 25 souls in 1805 and an estimate made in 1818-20 doubles the number, while Padilla (1919, j). 49) gives a population of \"about 300\" and in 1828 we are told that there were 160 families (Muckleroy, 1922, p. 233). These last figures are evidently very much in error. Although the tribal name is remembered, the tribe itself is now wholly merged with the peoples which go under the name of \"Caddo.\" The more important of these estimates may conveniently be tabu- lated as follows, the figures in parentheses being obtained by multiply- ing the number of warriors by four : Hasinai Year and authority Warriors Total population 1699 (Anonymous Canadian) . 1716 (Ram6n) 1721 (Aguayo) 1779 (De M6zi6res) 1783 (Morfi) 1805 (Sibley) 1818-20 (Cincinnati Gazette) . 1820 (Padilla) 1834 (Almonte) 1847 (Burnet) 1851 (Stem) 1864 (Indian Office) 1872 (Indian Office) 1873 (Indian Office) 1876 (Indian Office) 600-700. 135-_-. 380 (?). 200-.-. 150..-. 200 (families). 100+ (2, 400-2, 890) 4, 000-5, 000 1, 378 + (540) (1,520) (800) 650-660 1,450 400 (800) 315 + 150 85 50 30 8WANT0N] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY Kadohadacho 23 Year and authority Warriors Total population 1700 (BienviUe) 1709 (LaHarpe) 1718 (Bienville) 1719 (LaHarpe) 1773 (Do M^ziSres) 1805 (Sibley) 1818-20 (Cincinnati Gazette). 1820 (Padilla) 1825 (from Schoolcraft) 1829 (Porter) 1834 (Almonte) 1836 (H.

The same is true of the Kadohadacho figures if we omit those of Padilla, H. M. Morfit, and perhaps Sibley. Relative consistency is introduced into the last three groups if we allow for swANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 25 the increase by immigration into the Yatasi tribe between 1773 and 1805, remember that the first two estimates of Adai population do not profess completeness, and ignore the last two estimates of Eyeish population which are patently too high. A possible check on Hasinai population is furnished by Father Anastasius' comment that their cantons contained 10 or 12 houses apiece. He also says, as already noted, that each house accommo- dated 2 families, but Joutel raises the number to 8 or 10. If we assume a dozen cantons, a very conservative estimate, and 4 indi- viduals to the family, we should attain a population of 10 or 12 by 2 by 4 by 12, accepting Anastasius' allocation of families to the house, or 10 or 12 by 8 or 10 by 4 by 12, using Joutel's estimate, anywhere from 960 to 5,760, This is not very satisfactory and it would seem that Aguayo's figures supply a more rational basis for determination since he claims to have clothed 1,378 adults, though this probably includes 80 Kadohadacho visitors. Although it is quite probable that there were some repeaters in this interesting process, if we subtract the 80 Kadohadacho, assume that the children were about as numerous as the adults, and that as many more may not have been reached, we shall arrive at a figure of nearly 4,000, which is as satisfactory as anything that could be suggested. About half that number should account for the 4 Kadohadacho tribes and the Cahinnio, and 1,000 for the Natchitoches group, while 400 apiece would be an ample esti- mate for the Adai and Eyeish. This makes a grand total of some- what less than 8,000, more than 600 below Mooney's estimate. I regard even that as an outside figure, and believe that the sudden diminution of the Kadohadacho, Natchitoches, and their allies, asserted by Bienville and La Harpe during the first 20 years of white contact, not to have reached the proportions they indicate in spite of the epidemic of 1691. Keduction in the numbers of these Indians was certainly real and it continued apparently with no considerable inter- ruption until about 1870, after which date a recovery began which has raised the Caddo from about 450 to nearly 1,000. If we regard 8,000 as an outside figure, it appears that they are not as far behind their numbers when the French and Spaniards first met them as the great losses they have suffered might lead one to expect. Blood from other races has undoubtedly entered into the present Caddo popula- tion, but the amount of Indian blood itself must have increased in the doubling of population which has taken place in the last 60 or 70 years. ORIGIN LEGENDS Like most tribes of the Southeast and Southwest, native Caddo myths pointed to an original home under the earth. According to Caddo Jake, an Indian of the Natchitoches tribe whom I interviewed 209071 â 41 n 26 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bdll. 132 in 1912, his people came out of the ground where two rivers met and in the point of hind between them. It was said to have been in the neighborhood of Sodo Lake, La. One of the two rivers was of course the Red. The other was perhaps a river mentioned by him called the River Ki'si, reputed to have originated from a vine called naatco'ot, \"raccoon intestines,\" which grows to a great length and has a smooth black surface. The Caddo were then very numerous and immediately began spreading out into villages in all directions. But the Choctaw lived near by, between them and the sea, and they killed many Caddo by waylaying them at night and clubbing them to death. Later many died of the smallpox, and the Caddo moved westward around the end of the lake and began hunting in the country beyond. They also began to divide and the several bands came to be called after the names of the foods they lived upon. The Hainai â ap- parently a part of them only â went to a place where there were many black berries growing on thorny trees which are called be'idatco. Hence they came to be known as Nabedache. Some Yatasi went out hunting and discovered pawpaws, which they began to eat, and these were afterwards known as \"Pawpaw People\" (Natchitoches, from Nashitosh). Jose Antonio Pichardo, however, was told that Natchi- toches was from an Indian word \"nacicit,\" signifying \"A place where the soil is the color of red ochre,\" and that it was applied originally to a small creek running through red soil. (Hatchett's translation of Pichardo's work quoted by Castaneda in Morfi (1935, vol. 1, p. 76) .) A part of the Kadohadacho found in the ground some bumble- bee honey, which they started to feast upon. From that they were called Da'ko, and hence Nadako, (Anadarko). Still later the Anadarko and Hainai crossed the Sabine and lived beyond it. Mooney supplies us with the following origin myth: They came up from under the groimd through the mouth of a cave in a hill which they call Cha' kanl'nd, \"The place of crying,\" on a lake close to the south bank of Red river, just at its junction with the Mississippi. In those days [the story continues] men and animals were all brothers and all lived together under the ground. But at last they discovered the entrance to the cave leading up to the surface of the earth, and so they decided to ascend and come out. First an old man climbed up, carrying in one hand fire and a pipe and in the other a drum. After him came his wife, with, corn and pump- kin seeds. Then followed the rest of the people and the animals. All in- tended to come out, but as soon as the wolf had climbed up he closed the hole, and shut up the x*est of the people and animals under the ground, where they still remain. Those who had come out sat down and cried a long time for their friends below, hence the name of the place. Because the Caddo came out of the ground they call it ind', \"mother,\" and go back to it when they. die. Because they have had the pipe and the drum and the corn and pumpkins since they have been a people, they hold fast to these things and have never thrown them away. From this place they spread out toward the west, follow- swANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 27 ing up the course of Red river, along whicli they made their principal settle- ments. For a long time they lived on Caddo lake, on the boundary between Louisiana and Texas, their principal village on the lake being called Sha\"- chUdi'ni, \"Timber hill.\" [Mooney, 1S96, pp. 109^-1094.] A version of this story given by Freeman, however, represents the events as having taken place after a universal deluge. He says: Prom the similarity of one of their traditions to the Mosaical account of the deluge it deserves notice. They say that long since, a civil war broke out amongst them, which so displeased Enicco, the Supreme Being, that he caused a great flood, which destroyed all but one family ; consisting of four persons, the father, mother, and children. This family was saved by flying to a knoll at the upper end of the prairie, which was the only spot uncovered by the water. Id this knoll was a cave, where the male and female of all the kinds of animals were preserved. After the flood had continued one moon, they set a bird, called by them 0-Wah, at liberty, which returned in a short time with a straw. The family then set out on a raft in search of the place, from whence this straw was brought, and, pursuing a west course for two leagues, they came to land ; where they saw a fish Toesha, and being much alarmed at its enormous size, they all shed tears; from this circumstance, they named the place Cha- canenah, or ground upon which tears have been shed. This fish remained for many years after, and was large enough for 30 men to encamp under. All the Mexican and Louisiana Indians are supposed to be the offspring of this family. It is said that some other of the nations have a similar tradition ; and that many of the tribes used to meet, on a certain day in every year, at the knoll upon which this family was supposed to have been preserved; and there offer sacrifices to the Supreme Being, for not destroying the whole race. [Freeman- Custis Expedition, 1806, pp. 28-29.] The site of this cave is here said to have been at an old village on the east side of Red Eiver in the latitude of Hervey, but Sibley places it at an older town site still higher up the river, on the south side about on the meridian of Ogden, Ark. They have a traditionary tale [he says] which not only the Caddoes, but half a dozen other smaller nations believe in, who claim the honor of being descendants of the same family ; they say, when all the world was drowning by a flood, that inundated the whole country, the Great Spirit placed on an eminence, near this lake, one family of Caddoques, who alone were saved ; from that family all the Indians originated. [Sibley, in Amer. State Pap., Indian Affairs, 1832, p. 721.] Part of this story appears again in Morfi's Memorias, quoted from a letter written November 17, 1763, by Cavallero Macarti, commandant of the post of Natchitoches, to Don Angel de Marto y Navaryete, governor of the province. Speaking of the Kadohadacho proper he says: Their history refers to their origin in this manner. On a hill some two leagues distant from the pueblo where they lived, there appeared a woman, called by them Zacado, and venerated by them as the first of their divinities, who in the same place raised her first children, instructing them to hunt, fish, to construct houses, and to dress themselves, and when they were skillful in these things she suddenly 28 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull. 132 disappeared from sight. The hill is still held in great veneration by those Indians, who consider themselves as the progenitors of the other nations. [Morfl, 1932, p. 6.] No myth describing the origin of man or his emergence above the surface of the earth has been collected from the Hasinai. All refer to the Kadohadacho and their associated tribes, unless we except some items of the origin legend contained among the Traditions of the Caddo, collected by G. A. Dorsey. The first of these relates how the people lived in a village called Old-Home-in-the-Darkness under ground, how they chose the Moon as their leader and traveled west- ward until they came to the surface of the earth. We also have the common story that part of the people were turned back before reach- ing the surface. The rest continued on westward. Their first vil- lage was called Tall-Timber-on-top-of-the-Hill, for the place was in black-jack timber near the top of a high hill. Going on farther west, they came to some mountains which they climbed, finding a lake on the top. Before this, Moon left them and was succeeded by Medicine-Screech-Owl, apparently the first child born after they had attained the surface of the earth. Gathering his people to- gether along the banks of the lake, the new leader said : These waters which are before you are the tears of your great chief, Moon, for before he was taken up into the heavens he came up to this mountain and shed tears for the wrongs he had done to his people. So we shall call this mountain Moon's-Tears-on-the-Mountain. [Dorsey, 1905, pp. 7-13.] This is interesting because it again brings in a place named from the shedding of tears, evidently an old element in the several myths. Another fragment of the origin myth is preserved in a letter writ- ten to Henry R. Schoolcraft, by William B. Parker, and dated March 14, 1855. According to this, the Caddo, Hainai, and Anadarko \"issued from the hot springs of Arkansas\" (Schoolcraft, 1854, vol. 6, p. 682). The several narratives agree in one important item, in locating the point of origin, or emergence, of the Caddo in the eastern part of their territories, or indeed east of theii* territories, and in repre- senting their movement as from east to west. This is contrary to an opinion regarding the origin of the Caddoan tribes which has been widely held and would bring them from the Southwest. It is partly due to a Pawnee legend, but I was told by the late James Murie that this legend belonged to only one of the Pawnee tribes and that two of the others claimed to have come from the east. It is also thought to have received confirmation from men- tion of Jumano Indians, supposedly Caddoans, on the Rio Grande. This tribe, or one of similar designation, â a name which should really be spelled Shumano â was on the steppe east of the Pueblo Indians in later times and was probably incorporated with the Wi- s WANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 29 chita (Hodge, 1907, art. Jumano). Sauer (1934, p. 68) thinks he has evidence that it was really a Nahuatlan group, and it was perhaps a part of the Suma disrupted by Apache invaders. Wichita tra- ditions seem to agree with those of the Caddo and the majority of the Pawnee in pointing to a movement from the east and north rather than the south and west (Gatschet, 1891, pp. 249-252) . This conclusion would be further supported if the linguistic relationship affirmed to exist between Caddoan and Iroquoian languages is borne out by future investigations. In the meantime we must wait upon the linguists and archeologists. HISTORY Our first historical references to the Caddo Indians are in the nar- ratives of the De Soto expedition. The Atayos visited by Cabeza de Vaca in 1528 were the Toho or Tohaha, both Tonkawan tribes, and not the Adai as has sometimes been thought (Cabeza de Vaca, 1905, p. 105). Cabeza encountered no Caddo. On or about the first day of October 1541, when De Soto's army was in a province called Cayas or Tanico in southern Arkansas, he set out with 13 horsemen and 50 foot to view another province known as Tula, which Biedma describes as fertile, and \"to see whether it was a land through which he might pass with all his men,\" or \"in which he could winter the people\" (Bourne, 1904, vol. 2, p. 32; Robertson, 1933, p. 194). \"And,\" says Eanjel, \"he returned from there in a hurry, and the Indians killed one horse and wounded four or five.\" The Cayas chief had described this province as \"the best populated land thereabout,\" and \"situated to the south.\" He added \"that he could give him a guide, but that he did not have an interpreter, for the speech of Tula was different from his ; and because he and his fore- bears had always been at war with the lords of that province, they had no converse, nor did they understand each other.\" Elvas, from whom the last two quotations are taken, amplifies Ranjel's terse comment on the ensuing struggle by saying : As soon as he arrived and was perceived by the Indians, the band was sum- moned. When fifteen or twenty Indians had gathered together, they came to attack the Christians. On seeing that they handled them roughly, and that when they took to flight the horses overtook them, they climbed on top of the houses, where they tried to defend themselves with their arrows ; and when driven from some would climb on top of others ; and, while they were pursuing some, others would attack them from another direction. In this way, the running lasted so long that the horses became tired and could no longer run . . . Fif- teen Indians were killed there and captives were made of forty women and young persons ; for they did not leave any Indian alive who was shooting arrows if they could overtake him. On October 5 the entire Spanish army set out for Tula and they reached it on the Tth, but, found it abandoned. De Soto had carried 30 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull, isz along the chief of Cayas, in accordance with his usual custom, but Elvas says that among the Cayas Indians \"he did not find a single one who understood the speech of TuUa.\" On Saturday morning, the day after their arrival, the Indians came to give them a brush, or a battle, and they had large, long poles, like lances, the ends hardened by fire, and they were the best fighting people that the Cliristians met v/ith, and they fought like desperate men, with the greatest valour in the world. That day they wounded Hernandarias, the grandson of the marshal of Seville, and, thank God, the Christians defended themselves so valiantly that they did not receive much damage, although the Indians tried to round up the whole force. [Bourne, 1904, vol. 2, p. 148; cf. Robertson, 1933, pp. 194-196.] So Kanjel; Elvas describes this encounter at greater length: As soon as [the Indians] knew [De Soto] was in Tulla, at the hour of dawn of the first night, they came in two bands from two different directions with their bows and arrows and long poles resembling pikes. As soon as they were perceived both those of horse and those of foot sallied out against them and there many Indians were killed, and some Christians and horses wounded. Some Indians were captured, six of whom the governor sent to the cacique with their right hands and their noses cut oIjE. He ordered them to tell him that if he did not come to make his excuses and obey him, he would go to get him; and do to as many of his men as he found what he had done to those whom he sent to him. He gave him the space of three days in which to come. This he gave them to understand the best he could by signs as he had no interpreter. After three days came an Indian whom the cacique sent laden with cowhides. He came weeping bitterly, and coming to the governor cast himself at his feet. He raised him up, and he made him a talk, but no one could understand him. The governor told him by signs that he should return and tell the cacique to send him an interpreter whom the people of Cayas could understand. Next day, three Indians came laden with cowhides and three days after that twenty Indians came. Among them was one who understood those of Cayas. After a long discourse of excuses from the cacique and praises of the governor, he concluded by saying that he and the others were come thither on behalf of the cacique to see what his lordship ordered; and that he was ready to serve him. The governor and all the men were very glad, for they could in no wise travel without an interpreter. The governor ordered him under guard and told him to tell the Indians who had come with him to return to the cacique and tell him that he pardoned him for the past and that he thanked him greatly for his gifts and for the interpreter whom he had sent him and that he would be glad to see him and for him to come next day to see him. The cacique came after three days and eighty Indians â¢with him. Both he and his men entered the camp weeping in token of obedience and repentance for the past mistake, after the manner of that land. He brought many cowhides as a gift, which were useful because it was a cold land, and were serviceable for coverlets as they were very soft and the wool like that of sheep. Nearby to the north were many cattle. The Christians did not see them nor enter their land, for the land was poorly settled where they were, and had little maize. The cacique of Tulla made his address to the governor in which he excused himself and offered him his land and vassals and person. No orator could more eloquently exjiress the message or address both of that cacique and of the other caciques and of all those who came to the governor in their behalf. [Robertson, 1933, pp. 196-199.] swANTON] CADDO HISTOEY AND ETHNOLOGY 31 Biedma tells much the same story. According to him, De Soto had 20 horsemen in his reconnaissance, and he mentions no infantry, but his account is probably defective in that particular. In attempting to seize some Indians, [he says] they began to yell and show us battle. They wounded of ours that day seven or eight men, and nine or ten horses ; and such was their courage, that they came upon us in packs, by eights and tens, like worried dogs. We killed some thirty or forty of them. In the attack made upon the main army after it reached their country, he says they were divided into \"three very large squadrons\" which came upon them from as many different directions. Later five or six Indians were sent who understood the Spaniards' interpreters. \"They asked who we were, and of what we were in search\" (Bourne, 1904, vol. 2, pp. 32-33). Garcilaso, as is his wont, enlarges considerably on these encoun- ters and adds various details which we can neither confirm nor deny. However, he agrees with Biedma that the attacking Indians were divided into three bands, and he agrees with our other authorities as to the valor of this tribe, their linguistic separateness, and their use of long lances. He also states that they deformed their heads, referring apparently to frontal head deformation, and he notes that they tattooed their faces, and particularly their lips (Garcilaso, 1723, pp. 189-194). After leaving these people De Soto marched to the southeast and came among others who seem to have been of an entirely different coimection. The Caddo relationship of these Tula people is not, of course, proved by the mere fact that their language was different from that of their neighbors, but is clearly shown by the fact that during the attempt of De Soto's followers to reach Mexico by land, they came among tribes that were undoubtedly Caddo and noted the resemblance in customs between them and the Tula people. Their western connec- tion is also indicated by the use of lances and the fact that they were much addicted to buffalo hunting. The name Caddo, moreover, per- sists in Caddo Eiver and Caddo Gap, which correspond to the location of these people as indicated in the relations. In any event, the later contact, to which reference has just been made, undoubtedly did occur with true Caddo tribes. On Jmie 5, 1542, about 2 weeks after De Soto's death, his successor in the governorship, Luis de Moscoso, led the surviving Spaniards westward and, after passing through two provinces where salt was made, he arrived among Caddo tribes near Red River about the middle of July. The first of these was called Amaye and lay perhaps 20 miles east of the river. It is es- teemed to have been Caddo from its association with known Caddo tribes and the resemblance between its name and the Caddo word designating a male human being. The next tribe or \"province\" lay 32 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull, m on Red River and bore a Caddo name, Naguatex or Nawatesh, meaning \"Place of Salt.\" This is represented as the most fertile and populous of all the provinces through which the army passed during this expe- dition, and though they plundered its granaries in July on their way west, when they returned in October these were refilled. Mentioned with the Amaye and Naguatex was a third tribe called Hacanac, iden- tical, it may be, with the Lacane. Here our Spaniards seem to have turned toward the southwest. They passed through two very poor provinces bearing Caddo names, Nissohone and Lacane, after which they reached a more populous one known as Nondacao. These three were evidently the Nasoni, Nacanish, and Nadako or Anadarko of later times. Beyond they came to the Hais Indians, the Eyeish or Haish of the more recent historical period, who were represented as warlike and much addicted to buffalo hunting. Next they reached Soacatino, a province in wooded country. It bears a Caddo name but is not cer- tainly identifiable in later Caddo history. Still farther on toward the south or west they reached a considerable province called Guasco, one which is barely noted in Casaiias' list. There they obtained con- siderable corn. Two other places bearing Caddo names, Naquiscoga and Nagacahoz, were visited and finally they came upon a river which bore the name Daycao, apparently derived also from the Caddo Ian- gauge. This was quite certainly the Trinity since beyond it their scouts captured some Indians living in wretched hovels whose speech none of the other Indians could understand. They were evidently Tonkawa or Bidai. On their return to the Mississippi River they followed the same route (Bourne, 1904, vol. 2, pp. 36-38; Robertson, 1933, pp. 239-258). Just before Moscoso and his men penetrated the Caddo country from the east, Coronado approached it from New Mexico, and it has been believed by some that he came in direct contact with these people. The belief is based upon his report that he encountered Indians called \"Teyas\" living in the northwestern part of what is now Texas, and the apparent impossibility of identifying them with any other tribe. Coronado describes his first encounter with these Indians as follows. After reaching extensive plains, probably the Staked Plains, with no more landmarks than as if we had been swallowed up in the sea . . . and while we were lost in these plains, some horsemen who went off to hunt cows fell In with some Indians who also were out hunting, who are enemies of those that I had seen in the last settlement [the Querechos], and of another sort of people who are called Teyas ; they have their bodies and faces all painted, are a large people like the others, of a very good build; they eat the raw flesh just like the Querechos, and live and travel around with the cows in the same way as these. [Winship, 1896, p. 581 ; Hammond and Itey, 1940, p. 186.] SWANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 33 It was the information obtained from these men, in many respects contradictory to what he had before been told, that induced Coro- nado to leave the greater part of his army and push on with 30 horsemen to the province of Quivira. Castaiieda notes that one of these Teya Indians was seen to shoot a bull right through both shoulders with an arrow. These people [he continues] are very intelligent ; the women are well made and modest. They cover their whole body. They wear shoes and buskins made of tanned skin. The women wear cloaks over their small under i)etticoats, with sleeves gathered up at the shoulders, all of skin, and some wore some- thing like little sanbenitos with a fringe, which reached half-way down the thigh over the petticoat. [Winship, 1896, p. 507; Hammond and Rey, 1940, p. 239.] The Relacion del Suceso states that two kinds of people travel around these plains with the cows; one is called Querechos and the other Teyas; they are very well built, and painted, and are enemies of each other. They have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows. They kill all of these they wish, and tan the hides, with which they clothe themselves and make their tents, and they eat the flesh, sometimes even raw, and they also even drink the blood when thirsty. The tents they make are like field tents, and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose, which come together and are tied at the top, and when they go from one place to another they carry them on some dogs they have, of which they have many, and they load them with the tents and poles and other things, for the country is so level, as I said, that they can make use of these, because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground. The sun is what they worship most. The skin for the tents is cured on both sides, without the hair, and they have the skins of deer and cows left over. They exchange some cloaks with the natives of the river for com. [Winship, 1896, p. 578 ; Hammond and Rey, 1940, pp. 292-293.] Castaiieda describes the Plains people as follows : These people are called Querechos and Teyas. They described some large settlements, and judging from what was seen of these people and from the accounts they gave of other places, there are a good many more of these people than there are of those at the settlements [on the Rio Grande]. They have better figures, are better warriors, and are more feared. They travel like the Arabs, with their tents and troops of dogs loaded with poles and hav- ing Moorish pack saddles with girths. When the load gets disarranged, the dogs howl, calling some one to fix them right. These people eat raw flesh and drink blood. They do not eat human flesh. They are a kind people and not cruel. They are faithful friends. They are able to make themselves very well understood by means of signs. They dry the flesh in the sun, cut- ting it thin like a leaf, and when dry they grind it like meal to keep it and make a sort of pea soup [mush] of it to eat. A handful thrown into a pot swells up so as to increase very much. They season it with fat, which they always try to secure when they kill a cow. They empty a large gut and fill it with blood, and carry this around the neck to drink when they are thirsty. When they open the belly of a cow, they squeeze out the chewed grass and drink the juice that remains behind, because they say that this contains the essence of the stomach. They cut the hide open at the back and pull it off 34 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [bull. 132 at the joints, using a flint as large as a finger, tied in a little stick, with as much ease as if working with a good iron tool. They give it an edge with their own teeth. The quickness with which they do this is something worth seeing and noting. [Winship, 1896, pp. 527-528; Hammond and Rey, 1940, pp. 261-262.] Castaneda gives the name of the large settlement of the Teyas, the first which they reached, as \"Cona.\" Guides were taken from them for Quivira, and though the first ran away in a few days. Coronado sent back for others and they were supplied promptly. Another important reference to these people is also furnished by Castaneda : There is a village, small and strong, between Cicuye [Pecos] and the prov- ince of Quirix [the Keres Indians], which the Spaniards named Ximena [Galis- teo], and another village almost deserted, only one part of which is inhabited. This was a large village, and judging from its condition and newness it ap- peared to have been destroyed. They called this the village of the granaries or silos, because large underground cellars were found here stored with corn. There was another large village farther on, entirely destroyed and pulled down, in the yards of which there were many stone balls, as big as 12-quart bowls, which seemed to have been thrown by engines or catapults, which had destroyed the village. All that I was able to find out about them was that, sixteen years before, some people called Teyas, had come to this country 'in great numbers and had destroyed these villages. They had besieged Cicuye but had not been able to capture it, because it was strong, and when they left the region, they had made peace with the whole country. It seems as if they must have been a powerful people, and that they must have had engines to knock down the villages. The only thing they could tell about the direction these people came from was by pointing toward the north. They usually call these people Teyas or brave men, just as the Mexicans say chichimecas or braves, for the Teyas whom the army saw were brave. These knew the peo- ple in the settlements, and were friendly with them, and they [the Teyas of the plains] went there to spend the winter under the wings of the settle- ments. The inhabitants do not dare to let them come inside, because they can- not trust them. Although they are received as friends, and trade with them, they do not stay in the villages over night, but outside under the wings. The villages are guarded by sentinels with trumpets, who call to one another just as in the fortresses of Spain. There are seven other villages along this route, toward the snowy mountains, one of which has been half destroyed by the people already referred to. These were under the rule of Cicuye. [Winship, 1896, pp. 523-524; Hammond and Rey, 1940, pp. 257-258.] Later he notes that the people of Quivira \"are almost of the same sort and appearance as the Teyas\" (Winship, 1896, p. 528; Hammond and Rey, 1940, p. 263). If these descriptions of the Tej^as Indians are trustworthy, it is im- possible to regard them as Caddo. They were evidently a Plains tribe with all the typical Plains characteristics. They were living in skin tents, and there is no evidence that these were mere temporary lodges occupied during the hunting season. Only 1 year later, Moscoso SWANTON] CADDO HISTORY AND ETHNOLOGY 35 passed completely through the Caddo country and seems to have found them occupying semisedentary villages with no intimation that their houses were of skins. If that had been the case the Spaniards would certainly have noted it as a singular differentiation from the houses of the Mississippi tribes. And inasmuch as the Indians of Quivira, who are generally regarded as Wichita, were already inhabiting grass houses, we should have to assume that the Caddo were roving about in a wild state and inhabiting tipis, while their relatives to the north were in good-sized grass dwellings. This is contrary to all of the informa- tion that has come to us regarding the Caddo and is not in accord with common sense. Assuming that the Querecho were Apache, as is generally believed, and that the Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, and Comanche, as well as the Arapaho and Cheyenne, had not in Coronado's time got so far south, we find some difficulty in identifying the Teyas wit"
