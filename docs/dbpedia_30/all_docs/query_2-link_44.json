I have the honor to submit herewith the manuscript of Bulletin 30 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, entitled \"-Handbook of American Indians,'1 which has been in preparation for a number of years and has been completed for publication under the editorship of Mr F. W. Hodge. The Handbook contains a descriptive list of the stocks, confederacies, tribes, tribal divisions, and settlements north of Mexico, accompanied with the various names by which these have been known, together with biographies of Indians of note, sketches of their history, archeology, manners, arts, customs, and institutions, and the aboriginal words incorporated into the English language. Respectfully, W. H. HOLMES, Chief. SIR:\n\nThe\n\nSECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,\n\nWashington, X). O. in\n\nPREFACE During\" the early exploration and settlement of North America, a multitude of Indian tribes were encountered, having- diverse customs and languages. Lack of knowledge of the aborigines and of their languages led to many curious errors on the part of the early explorers and settlers: names were applied to the Indians that had no relation whatever to their aboriginal names; sometimes nicknames were bestowed, owing perhaps to personal characteristics, fancied or real; sometimes tribes came to be known by names given b^^ other tribes, which were often opprobrious; frequently the designation by which a tribal group Was known to itself was emploj^ed, and as such names are oftentimes unpronounceable by alien tongues and unrepresentable by civilized alphabets, the result was a sorry corruption, varying according- as the sounds were impressed on Spanish, English, French, Dutch, German, Russian, or Swedish ears. Sometimes, again, bands of a single tribe were given distinctive tribal names, while clans and gentes were often regarded as independent autonomous groups to which separate tribal designations likewise were applied. Consequently, in the literature relating to the American Indians, which is practically coextensive with the literature of the first three centuries of the New World, thousands of such names are recorded, the significance and application of which are to be understood only after much study. The need of a comprehensive work on the subject has been felt ever since scientific interest in the Indians was first aroused. Many lists of tribes have been published, but the scientific student, as well as the general reader, until the present time has been practically -without the means of knowing any more about a given confederacy, tribe, clan, or settlement of Indians than was to be gleaned from casual references to it. The work of which this Handbook is an outgrowth had its inception as early as 1873, when Prof. Otis T. Mason, now of the United States National Museum, began the preparation of a list of the tribal names mentioned in the vast literature pertaining to the Indians, and in due time several thousand names were recorded, with references to the •works in which they appeal*. The work was continued by him until after the establishment of the Bureau, when other duties compelled its suspension. Later the task was assigned to Col. Grarrick Mallery, who, however, soon abandoned it for investigations in a field -which proved\n\nVI\n\nPREFACE\n\nto be his life work, namely, the pictography and sign language of the American Indians. Meanwhile Mr James Mooney was engaged in compiling a similar list of tribes, with their synonymy, classified chiefly on a geographic basis and covering the entire Western Hemisphere—a work begun in 1873 and continued for twelve years before either he or the members of the Bureau of American Ethnology knew of the labors of each other in this field. Soon after the organization of the Bureau in 1879, the work of recording a tribal synonymy was formally assigned to Mr Henry \"VST. Henshaw. Up to this time a complete linguistic classification of the tribes north of Mexico, particularly in the West and Northwest, \"was not possible, since sufficient data had not been gathered for determining their linguistic affinities. Mr Henshaw soon perceived that a linguistic classification of the Indian tribes, a \"work long contemplated by Major Powell, must precede and form the basis for a tribal synonymy, and to him, therefore, as a necessary preliminary, was intrusted the supervision of such a linguistic classification. By 1885 the Bureau's researches in this direction had reached a stage that warranted the grouping of practically all the known tribes by linguistic stocks. This classification is published in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau, and on it is based, with few exceptions, the present Handbook. Immediately on the completion of the linguistic classification, the entire force of the Bureau, under Mr Henshaw's immediate direction, was assigned to the work that had now grown into a Dictionary and Synonymy of the Indian Tribes North of Mexico. As his special field Mr Henshaw devoted attention to several of the Californian stocks, and to those of the North Pacific coast, north of Oregon, including the Eskimo. To Mr Mooney \"were given the great and historically important Algonquian and Iroquoian families, and through his wide general knowledge of Indian history and customs he rendered aid in many other directions. A list of Linguistic Families of the Indian Tribes North of Mexico, with Provisional List of the Principal Tribal Names and Synonyms (55 pp., octavo), was at once printed for use by the collaborators of the Bureau in connection -with the complete compilation, and although the list does riot include the Californian tribes, it proved of great service in the earlier stages of the \"work. The 2,500 tribal names and synonyms appearing in this list were taken chiefly from Mr Mooney's manuscript; the linguistic classification was the result of the work that the Bureau had been conducting under Mr Henshaw's supervision. Rev. J. Owen Dorsey assumed charge of the work on the Siouan, Caddoan, and Athapascan stocks; Dr W. J. Hoffman, under the personal direction of Major Powell, devoted his energies to the Shoshonean family, and Mr Jeremiah Curtin, by reason of his familiarhry with a number of the Californian tribes, rendered direct aid to Mr Henshaw\n\nPREFACE\n\nVII\n\nin that field. Dr Albert S. Gatschet employed his time and longexperience in the preparation of the material pertaining- to the Muskhogean tribes of southeastern United States, the Yuman tribes of the lower Colorado drainage and of Lower California, and various smaller linguistic groups. To Col. Garrick Mallery were assigned the French authors bearing on the general subject. With such aid the work received a pronounced impetus, and before the close of 1885 a large body of additional material had been recorded. Four years later the elaboration of the material pertaining- to the Yuman, Piman, Keresan, Tanoan, and Zunian stocks of the extreme Southwest was placed in charge of Mr F. W. Hodge, who brought it to completion. The work was continued under Mr Henshaw's supervision until, in 1893, ill health compelled his abandonment of the task. This is the more to be regretted as Mr Henshaw had in course of preparation a classification and nomenclature of the minor divisions of the ling-uistic stocks, which is essential to a proper presentation and a clear understanding of the subject. After Mr Henshaw's relinquishment of the work, Mr Hodge was given entire charge of it. But other official duties of members of the staff prevented the Handbook as a whole from making marked progress until 1899, when F>r Cyrus Thomas was intrusted with the task of revising the recorded material bearing on the Algonquian, Siouan, and Muskhogean families. In 1902 the work on the Handbook was again systematically taken up, at the instance of Secretary Langley, who detailed Mr Hodge, at that time connected immediately with the Smithsonian Institution, to undertake its general editorial supervision. The scope of the subjectmatter was enlarg-ed to include the relations between the aborigines and the Government; their archeology, manners, customs, arts, and industries; brief biographies of Indians of note; and words of aboriginal origin that have found their way into the English language. It was proposed also to include Indian names that are purely geographic, but by reason of the vast number of these it was subsequently deemed advisable to embody them eventually in an independent work. Moreover, it was provided that the work should be illustrated as adequately as time and the illustrative material available would admit, a feature not originally contemplated. To fully cover this vast field at the present time is impossible, by reason of the fact that research among the native tribes, notwithstanding the extensive and important work that has been accomplished in recent years, has not advanced far beyond the first stage, even when is taken into account the sum of knowledge derived from the researches of the Bureau and of other institutions, as well as of individuals. The lack of completeness of our present knowledge of the tribes was, perhaps, never better shown than when an attempt was made to carry out the enlarged plan of the Handbook. With its limited force the\n\nVIII\n\nPREFACE\n\nBureau could scarcely hope to cover the entire range of the subject within a reasonable time; consequently various specialists not directly connected with the Bureau were invited to assist—an invitation that was accepted in a manner most gratifying\". It is owing1 to the generous aid of these students that a work so complete as the Handbook is intended to be was made possible, and to them the Bureau owes its deep appreciation. That the Handbook has many imperfections there is no doubt, but it is hoped that in future editions the weak points may be strengthened and the gaps filled, until, as researches among the tribes are continued, the compilation will eventually represent a complete summary of existing knowledge respecting the aborigines of northern America. The scope of the Handbook is as comprehensive as its function necessitates. It treats of all the tribes north of Mexico, including the Eskimo, and those tribes south of the boundary more or less affiliated with those in the United States. It has been the aim to give a brief description of every linguistic stock, confederac3^, tribe, subtribe or tribal division, and settlement known to history or even to tradition, as well as the origin and derivation of every name treated, whenever such is known, and to record under each every form of the name and every other appellation that could be learned. These synonyms, in alphabetic order, are assembled as cross references in Part 2. Under the tribal descriptions a brief account of the ethnic relations of the tribe, its history, its location at various periods, statistics of population, etc., are included. Accompanying each synonjTm (the earliest known date always being given) a reference to the authority is noted, and these references form practically a bibliography of the tribe for those who desire to pursue the subject further. It is not claimed that every spelling of every tribal name that occurs in print is given, but it is believed that a sufficient number of forms is recorded to enable the student to identify practically every name by which any group of Indians has been known, as well as to trace the origin of many of the terms that have been incorporated into our geographic nomenclature. In many instances the treatises are satisfactorily illustrated; in others, much necessarily has been left to a future edition in order that the present publication may not be further delayed. The work of illustration was intrusted largelj7 to Mr De Lancey Gill.

In 1765 the settlement (the mission name of which was Santa Rosa, later changed to Santo Tomas) contained 166 persons, and in the vicinity were 612 others. In 1779 the pueblo had 851 inhabitants, and at least as early as 1794 it was peopled in part by Genizaros, or Indian captives and fugitives, chiefly Hopi, whom the Spaniards had rescued or purchased. In 1808 Abiquiu contained 122 Indians and 1,816 whites and mestizos. The town was thoroughly Mexicanized by 1854. See Bancroft, Ariz, and N. Mex., 280, 1889; Bandelier in Arch. Inst.

It is said in the Relation of 1660 that the Iroquois had warred upon them and two other tribes of the same locality. Du Lhut (1684) includes them in the list of nations of the region N. of L. Superior whose trade it was desirable should be turned from the English of Hudson bay to the French. Chauvignerie (1736) seems to connect this tribe, estimated at 140 warriors, with the Tetes de Boule. He mentions as totems the partridge and the eagle. They were reported by the Canadian Indian Office to number 450 in 1878, after which date they are not officially mentioned. (J. M. c.

( Wdbuna'ki, from wcibun, a term associated with 'light,' 'white,' and refers to the morning and the east; a hi 'earth,' 'land'; hence Wdbuna'ki is an inanimate singular term signifying ' eastland,' or 'morning-land,' the elements referring to animate dwellers of the east being wanting.—Jones). A name used by the English and French of the colonial period to designate an Algonquian confederacy centering in the present state of Maine, and by the Algonquian tribes to include all those of their own stock resident on the Atlantic seaboard, more particularly the \"Abnaki\" in the N and the Delawares in the s. More recently it has been applied also to the emigrant Oneida,\n\nBULL. 30]\n\n3\n\nABNAKI\n\nStockbridges, and Munsee about Green bay, Wis. By the Puritans they were generally called Tarrateena, a term apparently obtained from the southern New England tribes; and though that is the general conclusion of modern authorities, there is some doubt as to the aboriginal origin of this term. In later times, after the main body of the Abnaki had removed to Canada, the name was applied more especially to the Penobscot tribe. The Iroquois called them Owenunga, which seems to be merely a modification of Abnaki, or Abnaqui, the name applied by the French and used by most modern writers. The form Openango has been used more especially to designate the eastern tribes. Maurault (Hist, des Aben., 2, 3866) says: \"Some English authors have called these savages Wabanoaks, 'those of the east'; this is the reason they are called 'Abenakis' by some among us. This name was given them because they were toward the east with reference to the Narragansetts.\" Ethnic relations.—In his tentative arrangement Brinton (Len. Leg., 11, 1885) brings into one group the Nascapee, Micmac, Malecite, Etchimin, and Abnaki, but this is more of a geographic than a linguistic grouping. Vetromile (Abnakis, 20, 1866), following other authors, says that we should ' * embrace under this term all the tribes of the Algic [Algonquian] family, who occupy or have occupied the E. or N. E. shore of North America; thus, all the Indians of the seashores, from Virginia to Nova Scotia, were Abnaki.\" Maurault gives the following as the principal tribes of the Abnaki confederacy: Kanibesinnoaks (Norridgewock in part; see Kennebec and Norridgewock); Patsuikets (Sokoki in part) ; Sokouakiaks (Sokoki) ;Nurhantsuaks(Norridgewock); Pentagoets (Penobscot); Etemankiaks (Etchimin); Ouarastegouiaks (Malecite), the name Abnaki being applied in the restricted sense to the Indians of Kennebec r. All these tribes spoke substantially the same language, the chief dialectal differences being between the Etchimin and the other tribes of the group. The Etchimin, who formed a subgroup of the Abnaki confederacy, included the Passamaquoddy and Malecite. Linguistically the Abnaki do not appear to be more closely related to the Micmac than to the Delaware group, and Dr William Jones finds the Abnaki closely related to the central Algonquian languages. In customs and beliefs they are more nearly related to the Micmac, and their ethnic relations appear to be with the tribes N. of the St Lawrence. History.—The history of the Abnaki may be said to begin with Verrazano's visit in 1524. The mythical accounts of\n\nNorumbega (q. v.) of the early writers and navigators finally dwindled to a village of a few bark-covered huts under the name Agguncia, situated near the mouth of Penobscot r., in the country of the Abnaki. In 1604 Champlain ascended the Penobscot to the vicinity of the present Bangor, and met the \"lord\" of Norumbega, doubtless an Abnaki chief. From that time the Abnaki formed an important factor in the history of the region now embraced in the state of Maine. From the time of their discovery until their partial withdrawal to Canada they occupied the general region from the St Johns to the Saco; but the earliest English accounts indicate that about 1605—20 the s. w. part of the coast of Maine was occupied by other Indians, whose chief seat was near Pemaquid, and who were at war with the Abnaki, or Tarrateen, as the English termed them, who were more to the N; but these other tribes were finally conquered by the Abnaki and probably\n\nGROUP OF ABNAKI (\n\nPASSAMAQUODDY)\n\nabsorbed by them. Who these Indians were is unknown. The Abnaki foi^med an early attachment for the French, chiefly through the influence of their missionaries, and carried on an almost constant war Avith the English until the fall of the French power in America. The accounts of these struggles during the settlement of Maine are familiar episodes in American history. As the whites encroached on them the Abnaki gradually withdrew to Canada and settled chiefly at Becancour and Sillery, the latter being afterward abandoned by them for St Francis, near Pierreville, Quebec. The Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and Malecite, however, remained in their ancient homes, and in 1749 the Penobscot, as the leading tribe, made peace with the English, accepting fixed bounds. Since that period the different tribes have gradually dwindled into insignificance. The descendants of those who emigrated\n\nABNAKI from Maine, together with remnants of other New England tribes, are now at St Francis and Becancour, in Quebec, where, under the name of Abnaki, they numbered 395 in 1903. At the same time the Malecite, or Amalicite, were numbered at 801 in several villages in New Brunswick and Quebec, with about 625 Penobscot and Passamaquoddy in Maine. The present Penobscot say they number between 300 and 400, while the Passamaquoddy claim as many as 800 souls. Cwtoms and beliefs.—According to the writers on early Maine, the Abnaki were more gentle in manners and more docile than their \"western congeners. Yet they were implacable enemies and, as Maurault states, watched for opportunities of revenge, as did other Indians. Notwithstanding Vetromile's statement to the contrary, if Maurault's assertion (Hist. Abenakis, 25, 1866) applies to this tribe, as seems evident, they, like most other tribes, were guilty of torturing their prisoners, except in the case of females, who •were kindly treated. Although relying for subsistence to a large extent on hunting, and still more on fishing, maize was an important article of diet, especially in winter. Sagard states that in his day they cultivated the soil in the manner of the Huron. They used the rejected and superfluous fish to fertilize their fields, one or two fish being placed near the roots of the plant. Their houses or wigwams were conical in form and covered with birch-bark or with woven mats, and several families occupied a single dwelling. Their villages were, in some cases at least, inclosed with palisades. Each village had its council house of considerable size, oblong in form and roofed with bark; and similar structures were used by the males of the village • who preferred to club together in social fellowship. Polygamy -was practised but little, and the marriage ceremony was of the simplest character; presents were offered, and on their acceptance marriage was consummated. Each tribe had a war chief, and also a civil chief whose duty it was to preserve order, though this was accomplished through advice rather than by command. They had two councils, the grand and the general. The former, consisting of the chiefs and twTo men from each family, determined matters that •were of great importance to the tribe, and pronounced sentence of death on those deserving that punishment. The general council, composed of all the tribe, including males and females, decided questions relating to war. The Abnaki believed in the immortality of the soul. Their chief deities were Kechi Niwaskw and Machi Niwaskw, representing, re-\n\n[B. A. B.\n\nspectively, the good and the evil; the former, they believed, resided on an island in the Atlantic; Machi Niwaskw was the more powerful. According to Maurault they believed that the first man and woman wTere created out of a stone, but that Kechi Niwaskw, not being satisfied with these, destroyed them and created two more out of •wood, from whom the Indians are descended. They buried their dead in graves excavated in the soil. Tribal divisions.—The tribes included in the confederacy as noted by Maurault have already been given. In a letter sent by the Abnaki in 1721 to the governor of New England their divisions are given as follows: Narantsouuk (Norridgewock), Pentugouet (Penobscot), Narakamigou (Rocameca), Anmissoukanti (Amaseconti), Muanbissek, Pegouakki (Pequawket, Me.), Medoktek (Medoctec), Kwapahag, Pesmokanti (Passamaquoddy), Arsikantegou (Arosaguntacook), Ouanwinak (Wewenoc, s. edge of N. H.). The following is a full list of Abnaki tribes: Accominta, Amaseconti, Arosaguntacook, Etchimin, Malecite, Missiassik, Norridgewock (the Abnaki in the most limited sense), Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, Pequawket, Rocameca, Sokoki, and Wewenoc. The bands residing on St Croix and St Johns rs. spoke a different dialect from those to the southward, and were known collectively as Etchimin. They are now known as Passamaquoddy and Malecite. Although really a part of the Abnaki, they were frequently classed as a distinct body, while on the other hand the Pennacook tribes, although distinct from the Abnaki, were often classed \"with them on account of their connection during the Indian wars and after their removal to Canada. According to Morgan they had fourteen gentes: 1, Mals'-sum, Wolf; 2, Pis-suh/, Black Wildcat; 3, Ah-weh'-soos, Bear; 4, Skooke, Snake; 5, Ah-lunk-soo, Spotted Animal; 6, Ta-ma/-kwa, Beaver; 7, Maguh-le-boo', Caribou; 8, Ka-biih/-seh, Sturgeon; 9, Moos-kwa-suh/, Muskrat; 10, K'-che-ga-gong/-go, Pigeon Hawk; 11, Meh-ko-a/, Squirrel; 12, /Che-gwa/-lis, Spotted Frog; 13, Koos-koo , Crane; 14, Mii-daZ-weh-soos, Porcupine. According to Chauvignerie their principal totems were the pigeon and the bear, while they also had the partridge, beaver, and otter totems. The Abnaki villages, so far as their names have been recorded, were Amaseconti, Ammoncongan, Aquadocta (?), Arosaguntacook, Asnela, Aucocisco, Bagaduce, Becancour, Calais (Passamaquoddy} Grunasquamekook (Passamaquoddy), Imnarkuan (Passamaquoddy), Kennebec, Ketangheanycke, Lincoln Island, Masherosqueck, Mattawamkeag\n\nBULL. 30]\n\nABNAKI\n\n(Penobscot), Mattinacook (Penobscot), Mecadacut, Medoctec (Malecite), Meecombe, Missiassik (Missiassik), Moratiggon (?), Moshoquen, Muanbissek (?), Muscongus, Negas, Negusset (?), Norridgewock, Norumbega, Okpaak (Malecite), Olamon (Penobscot), Old Town (Penobscot), Ossaghrage, Ouwerage, Pasharanack, Passadumkeag (Penobscot), Passamaquoddy (village?), Pauhuntanuc, Pemaquid, Penobscot, Pequawket, Pocopassum, Precaute, Eocameca, Sabino, Sagadahoc, Sainte Anne (Malecite), St Francis, Satquin, Sebaik (Passamaquoddy), Segocket, Segotago, Sillery, Sokoki (village?), Taconnet, Tobique (Malecite), Unyjaware, Viger (Malecite), Wabigganus, Waccogo, Wewenoc (village?), (J.

E. of the Bio Grande and 20 m. s. of Manzano, in Valencia eo., N\". Mex. Whether the pueblo was built on both sides of the arroyo, or whether there were two pueblos successively occupied, has not been determined. It was first mentioned in 1598 by Juan de Onate; it became the seat of the mission of San Gregorio, founded in 1629 by Fray Francisco de Acevedo, who erected a large church and monastery, the •walls of which are still standing, and died there Aug. 1, 1644. Tenabo and Tabira were the visitas of Abo mission. Considering the ruins now on both banks of the arroyo as those of a single pueblo, the population during the early mission period was probably 2,000. Owing to Apache depredations many of the inhabitants fled to El Paso as early as 1671, and prior to the Pueblo insurrection of 1680 the village was entirely abandoned for the same cause. The Piros of Senecu del Sur claim to be the last descendants of the Abo people. See Vetancurt(1697), Cronica, 325, repr. 1871; Bandelier in Arch. Inst.

In shaping their numerous implements, utensils, and ornaments of stone, wood, bone, shell, and metal, the native tribes were largely dependent on abrading implements, of which there are many varieties. Of first importance are grinding stones and whetstones of more or less gritty rock, while\n\nABEAHAM- -ACCOMAO\n\nBULL. 30]\n\nless effectual are potsherds and rasp-like surfaces, such as that of the skin of the dogfish. Of the same general class are all sawing, drilling, and scraping tools and devices, which are described under separate heads. The smoothing and polishing implements into which the' grinding stones imperceptibly grade are also separately treated. The smaller grinding stones were held in the hand, and were usually unshaped fragments, the arrowshaft rubABRADING STONE, NEW loer and the slender neJERSEY.

A former Yuman tribe which, according to Father Garces, spoke the same language as the Yuma proper, and hence belonged to the same closely related Yuman division as the Yuma, Maricopa, and Mohave. As early as 1604-05 Juan de Ofiate found them in 8 rancherias (the northernmost -with 2,000 people in 160 houses) below the mouth of the Gila on the Rio Colorado, but by 1762 (Rudo Ensayo, 130, 1894) they occupied the left bank of the Colorado between the Gila and Bill Williams fork, and by Grarces' time (1776) their rancherias were scattered along the Colorado in Arizona and California, beginning about 38 m. below Bill Williams fork and extending the same distance downstream (Garces, Diary, 423-428, 450, 1900). At the latter date they were said to number 2,500, and while well disposed toward other surrounding tribes, regarded the Yuma and Mohave as enemies. Garces says of them: \"These Jalchedun [Alchedoma] Indians are the least dressed, not only in such goods as they themselves possess, but also in such as they trade with the Jamajabs [Mohave], Genigueches [Serranos], Cocomaricopas [Maricopa], Yabipais [Yavapai], and Moquis [Hopi], obtaining from these last mantas, girdles, and a coarse kind of cloth (sayal), in exchange for cotton.\" This statement is doubtless an error, as the Alchedoma raised no cotton, while the Hopi were the chief cultivators of this plant in the entire S.

A branch of the Esquimauan family inhabiting the Aleutian ids. and the N. side of Alaska pen., w. of TJgashik r. The origin of the term is obscure. A reasonable supposition is given by Engel (quoted by Dall in Smithson. Contrib., xxn, 1878) that Aliut is identical with the Chukchi word aliat, 'island.' The early Russian explorers of Kamchatka heard from the Chukchi of islanders, aliuit, beyond the main Asian shore, by which the Chukchi meant.the Diomede islanders; but when the Russians found people on the Aleutian ids. they supposed them to be those referred to by the Chukchi and called them by the Chukchi name, and the Chukchi often adopt the Russian name, Aleut, for themselves, though asserting that it is not their own. According to Dall, Unti.ng'O.n, 'people,' is the generic term which the Aleut apply to themselves, it being probably a form of the Eskimo Innuin, plural of Jnung, Jnuk. It is stated by various authorities that the Aleut differ markedly from the Eskimo in character and mental ability as well as in many practices. According to Dall the Aleut possess greater intellectual capacity than the Eskimo, but are far inferior in personal independence, and while the Aleuts' physiognomy differs somewhat from that of the typical Eskimo, individuals are often seen -who can not be distinguished from ordinary Innuit. Notwithstanding the differences, there is no doubt that the Aleut are an aberrant offshoot from the great Esquimauan stock, and that however\n\nmiLL. 30]\n\nALEXANDEOV8K\n\ngreat their distinguishing traits these have resulted in the lapse of time from their insular position and peculiar environment. Dall considers the evidence from the shell heaps conclusive as to the identity with the continental Eskimo of the early inhabitants of the islands as regards implements and weapons. The testimony afforded by language seems to be equally conclusive, though perhaps less evident. The Aleut language, though differing greatly from the dialects of the mainland, possesses many words whose roots are common to the Eskimo tongues. The Aleut are divided, chiefly on dialectal grounds, into Unalaskans, who inhabit the Fox ids., the w. part of Alaska pen., and the Shumagin ids., and Atkans who inhabit the Andreanof, Rat, and Near ids. When first visited by the Russians the Aleutian ids. had a much larger population than at present. As compared with the mainland Eskimo and the Indians the Aleut are now unwarlike and docile, though they fought well when first discovered, but had only darts against the Russian firearms and were consequently soon overpowered, and they speedily came under the absolute power of the Russian traders, who treated them with great cruelty and brutality. This treatment had the effect of reducing them, it is said, to 10 per cent of their original number, and the survivors were held in a condition of slavery. Later, in 1794-1818, the Russian Government interfered to regulate the relations between traders and natives with the result of somewhat ameliorating their condition. In 1824 the missionary Veniaminoff began his labors, and to hm is largely due most of the improvement, moral and mental. Through his exertions and those of his colaborers of the Greek church all the Aleut were Christianized and to some extent educated. The population of the Aleutian ids., which before the arrival of the Russians •was by their own tradition 25,000 (which estimate, judging by the great number of their village sites, Dall does not think excessive), in 1834, according to Veniaminoff, was 2,247, of whom 1,497 belonged to the E. or Unalaskan division and 750 to the w. or Atkan division. According to Father Shaiesnekov there were about 1,400 on the Aleutian ids. in 1848. After the epidemic of smallpox in that year some 900 were left. In 1874 Dall estimated the population at 2,005, including mixed bloods. According to the census of 1890 there were 968 Aleut and 734 mixed-bloods, total 1,702; in 1900 the statistics of the previous decade -were repeated. The following are Aleut villages: Aku-\n\nALGIC\n\n37\n\ntan, Attu, Avatanak, Belkofski, Biorka, Ohernofski, Eider, Iliuliuk, Kashiga, Korovinski, Makushin, Mashik, Morzhovoi, Nateekin, Nazan, Nikolaief, Nikolski, Pavlof, Pogromni, Popof, St George, St Paul, Sannak, Unga, Vossnessenski.

Schoolcraft to the AJgonquian tribes and languages, and used occasionally by other writers since his time. Algique is employed by some Canadian French essayists. Schoolcraft himself (Ind. Tribes, v, 536, 1855) includes the term in his list of words of Indian origin. The word seems to be formed arbitrarily from Alg, a part of Algonkin, and the English adjectival termination ic. (A. P. c.)\n\n38\n\nALGONKIAN\n\nALGONQUIAN FAMILY\n\nAlgonkian. A geological term used to designate an important series of rocks lying between the Archean and the Paleozoic systems. These rocks are most prominent in the region of L. Superior, a characteristic territory of the Indians of the Algonquian family, whence the name. Geologists speak of the \"Algonkian period.\" (A. P. C. ) Algonkin (a name hitherto variously and erroneously interpreted, but Hewitt suggests that it is probably from (Micmac) algoomeaking, or algoomaking, ' at the place of spearing fish and eels [from the bow of a canoe] '). A term applied originally to the Weskarini, a small Algonquian tribe formerly living on the present Gatineau r., a tributary of Ottawa r., E. of the present city of Ottawa, in Quebec. Later the name was used to include also the Amikwa, Kichesipirini, Keinouclie, Kishkakon, Maskasinik, Matawachkirini, Missisauga, Michacondibi, Nikikouek, Ononchataronon, Oskemanitigou, Ouasouarini, Outaouakamigouk, Outchougai, Pawating, Sagaiguninini, and Sagnitaouigama. French writers sometimes called the Montagnais encountered along the lower St Lawrence the Lower Algonquins, because they spoke the same language; and the ethnic stock and family of languages has been named from the Algonkin, who formed a close alliance with the French at the first settlement of Canada and received their help against the Iroquois. The latter, however, afterward procured firearms and soon forced the Algonkin to abandon the St Lawrence region. Some of the bands on Ottawa r. flecl w. to Mackinaw and into Michigan, where they consolidated and became known under the modern name of Ottawa. The others fled to the N. and is., beyond reach of the Iroquois, but gradually found their way back and reoccupied the country. Their chief gathering place and mission station was at Three Rivers in Quebec. Nothing is known of their social organization. The bands now recognized as Algonkin, with their population in 1900, are as follows. In Ottawa: Golden Lake, 86; North Renfrew, 286; Gibson (Iroquois in part), 123. In Quebec: River Desert, 393; Temiscaming, 203; Lake of Two Mountains (Iroquois in part), 447; total, 1,536. As late as 1894 the Canadian Indian Office included as Algonkin also 1,679 \" stragglers\" in Pontiac, Ottawa co., Champlain, and St Maurice, in Quebec, but these are omitted from subsequent reports. In 1884 there were 3,874 Algonkin in Quebec province and in E. Ontario, including the Temiscaming. Following are the Algonkin villages, so far as they are known to have been recorded: Cape Magdalen, Fgan, Hartwell, Isle aux Tourtes (Kichesipirini\n\n[B.
