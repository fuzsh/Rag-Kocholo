The agreement, which both parties had been negotiating off and on for thirteen years, was a watershed moment on the Southern Plains. The Comanche Treaty was the last in a series of 1785 agreements in which the Spaniards in Texas, following more than three decades of war, established peace with a group of formerly hostile tribes, known as the Norteños. The treaties proved successful since the Indians and the Spaniards maintained relative peace in Texas for the next twenty-ﬁve years, until relations were disrupted by the movement for Mexican independence and the ensuing arrival of American colonists from the United States. Until the late twentieth century few people were aware of the momentous agreements that had been reached two hundred years before. In 1975, however, the publication of Elizabeth A. H. John’s Storms Brewed in Other Men’s Worlds: The Confrontation of Indians, Spanish, and French in the Southwest, 1540–1795, dramatically changed the way people perceived relations between Indians and Euroamericans in Texas. Prior to Storms Brewed, an enormous narrative history that climaxed with the 1785 Spanish-Comanche accord, the few studies of the region’s Native Americans tended to neglect the colonial era entirely. They also portrayed the Indians as savage barbarians who presented an obstacle to civilization, which the American settlers were forced to heroically overcome in the nineteenth century. For example, one of the period’s most respected works, Rupert N. Richardson’s 1933 study, bore the title The Comanche Barrier to South Plains Settlement: A Century and a Half of Savage Resistance to the Advancing White Frontier, and only ten of two hundred pages dealt with the era prior to the Americans’ entrance into Texas. 1 John’s monumental effort focused exclusively on the colonial era and stressed the central role the various Indian tribes played in the Euroamerican settlement of the region between the Red River in Louisiana and the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Storms Brewed presented the Native Americans as rational beings who followed their own material interests in dealing with the\n\n[-11], (11)\n\nLines: 196 ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [-11], (11)\n\nxii\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\npreface\n\nSpanish and French newcomers. Using archival sources, John showed how the Indians closely interacted with the Euroamericans, forging advantageous military and trading alliances with whichever power they felt had the most to offer. The work expertly delineated the various tribes, pointing out that most of the region’s Indians did not primarily hunt buffalo from horseback, as a majority of movie-fed students believed (and still do), but that some were sedentary agriculturalists, while others hunted and ﬁshed near the Gulf Coast. In the quarter of a century since the publication of Storms Brewed, all worthwhile scholarly studies of the colonial Southwest, no matter how focused on the Euroamerican settlement of the region, have had to consider the importance of the area’s Indians. 2 John’s book also launched a series of monographs on the individual Indian tribes of Texas and Louisiana, which traced their histories into the nineteenth century and beyond. A majority of the works focused on the numerous Comanches, the classic buffalo hunting tribe of the region. 3 Fewer studies looked at the Lipan Apaches and the Tonkawas, other tribes that primarily rode horses and hunted game. 4 A number of books examined the history of the settled, farming Caddoan-speakers from the precolumbian era up to the late twentieth century. 5 A few scholars studied the coastal Karankawas and ﬁnally succeeded in demonstrating that they were not primarily cannibals, as most Texas schoolchildren have traditionally been taught. 6 Histories of the Cherokees, Delawares, Shawnees, and Alabama-Coushattas, tribes that immigrated to the region in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, were also written. 7 Of all the area’s Indians, scholars neglected only the Atakapas, a group of people that hunted and ﬁshed near the Texas and Louisiana coasts. 8 These works successfully overcame the triumphalist nature of the regions’ Native American historiography by matching the quality of the sophisticated studies of Indians that had already been completed for the Northeast, Southeast, and Great Lakes regions of the United States. Despite the recent multitude of individual tribal studies, only a few scholars have followed John’s example of producing a general history of all of the region’s Indians and their relations with Euroamericans. William B. Gannett’s 1984 doctoral dissertation examined the conﬂict between the various tribes and the American settlers of Texas during the period of Mexican independence and the Lone Star Republic. 9 This work was hampered, however, by the fact that the author did not consult any Spanish language sources and that he dealt with the Indians by location rather than as a whole. More interesting was Howard Meredith’s 1995 book, which traced the movements and cultures of the various tribes that were placed on reservations in the Indian Territory—present day Oklahoma—during the late nineteenth century. 10\n\n[-12], (12\n\nLines: 21\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds:\n\n[-12], (12\n\npreface\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\nxiii\n\nUsing traditional native dances as a metaphor for the relationship between Southern Plains tribes and Euroamericans, Meredith’s book concentrated on the Indians’ dealings with the federal government in the twentieth century and neglected the many groups of the region that did not end up in southwestern Oklahoma. Three years after the publication of Meredith’s work, David La Vere produced the ﬁrst complete overview of Texas’s Indian tribes in a fortysix page introduction to his edited work of native oral histories that the Works Progress Administration gathered during the Great Depression. 11 La Vere succinctly traced the history of the various tribes from precolumbian times to the 1930s, paying particular attention to how the Indians’ material culture evolved following the arrival of the Euroamericans. This book was followed in 1999 by Gary Anderson’s revolutionary study of the Indian economy of the Southwest between the beginnings of Spanish settlement in the late sixteenth century and the advent of the Americans’ domination of the area in the early 1800s. 12 Through the innovative use of a wide variety of archival sources, Anderson persuasively demonstrated how many tribes altered their lifestyles following the Spanish and French intrusion in order to forge a thriving exchange-based economy relatively independent of the Euroamerican newcomers. Finally, in 2004 La Vere built upon his previous short essay by using secondary works and published primary sources to produce an excellent book-length history of the Texas Indians from their arrival in the region to the present. 13 Although the past quarter of a century has witnessed a profusion of scholarly studies of the region’s Native Americans that have greatly altered and made clearer our understanding of the various groups’ experiences in Texas, no author has yet taken up John’s unstated challenge of producing a successor to Storms Brewed, a detailed narrative history that would trace the tribes’ interactions with Euroamericans from the establishment of peace at the signing of the Comanche Treaty to the Indians’ expulsion from the state just prior to the Civil War. During this period of three quarters of a century, the Native Americans continued to play a very important role in the area. For the ﬁrst half of the era the Indians maintained a numerical superiority over the Euroamericans that allowed them to inﬂuence the region’s economic, military, and diplomatic affairs to a heretofore unrecognized degree. Although the fortunes of the various tribes declined rapidly following Texas independence, the Indians were not the barriers to civilization that previous scholars have described, but were a race of people desperately trying to survive in the face of overwhelming hostility. By the end of the period almost all of the few remaining Indians were forcibly driven from Texas. This book, then, attempts to ﬁll the void in the literature by being a worthwhile successor to Storms Brewed and, thus, examines the relations between\n\n[-13], (13)\n\nLines: 216 ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [-13], (13)\n\nxiv\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\npreface\n\nthe Indian tribes and the various Euroamerican groups in Texas and the Near Southwest from 1786 to 1859. In order to maintain clarity, however, this work is more limited geographically than Storms Brewed. Many readers have complained that John’s book, by going back and forth from New Mexico to Texas and Louisiana over a period of two and a half centuries, was confusing and nearly impossible to follow. Actually, the respective colonies’ Indian affairs bore very little relationship with one another and, therefore, Storms Brewed was actually two separate books rolled into one. This study concentrates on Texas and a region I call—with apologies to Dan Flores—the Near Southwest, an area bordered on the east by the Red River, on the west by the Llano Estacado, on the south by the Nueces River, and on the north by the Canadian River. Throughout the period encompassed by this book, events in this zone—which traverses the political boundaries of Texas, Louisiana, and the Indian Territory—impacted all the area’s tribes while having little if no effect on the Native Americans in New Mexico. I also decided to begin this book a decade earlier than the conclusion of Storms Brewed, which ended, for little apparent reason, with the agreement reached between Spain and the United States in the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo. In reality, John’s study built toward the agreement reached in San Antonio in October 1785—and one concluded a few months later between the Western Comanches and the Spaniards in New Mexico—and terminated soon thereafter. In part, this was a consequence of the fact that the English language translation of the Béxar Archives (the most important original unpublished source for colonial Texas) abruptly ends in 1789. As a result, few of the abovediscussed works deal in any signiﬁcant way with Indian-Euroamerican relations in the thirty-year period between the last decade of the eighteenth century and the American colonization of Texas in the 1820s, when English sources again become plentiful. Therefore, the histories of important tribes such as the Lipan Apaches, Tonkawas, Karankawas, and Atakapas, remain incomplete due to the continued scholarly neglect of the Spanish and French sources of the period. One of the most important contributions I hope to make with this book, then, is to ﬁll the gaping hole that remains in the studies of Native Americans in Texas and Louisiana from around 1790 to 1825 or so. Therefore, I have thoroughly examined original microﬁlmed copies of the Béxar Archives from 1789 to 1836, as well as other contemporary Spanish language sources held at the Center for American History at the University of Texas. In addition, I have traveled to Seville, Spain, to look at the most important source for Spanish Louisiana, the Papeles Procedentes de Cuba, which contains, for the most part, French language documents held in the Archivo General de Indias.

This work pays particular attention to the Indians’ population, for I believe that one of the most important keys to the tribes’ success or failure was their numbers in relation to the region’s Euroamericans. Simply put, the Native Americans maintained their dominance in Texas and the Near Southwest only as long as they outnumbered the Hispanics, French, and Americans in their midst. I have also maintained a focus on the various tribes’ locations and trading and military alliances, for the Indians played a very important role in [-15], (15) the diplomatic affairs of the region well into the nineteenth century. Even after the general decline of the Native Americans following Texas independence, the different tribes followed widely disparate paths as they vainly attempted to Lines: 224 maintain their position in the state.

Unfortunately, Texan antipathy to the Native Americans was * PgEnds: Pa so intense that the state’s citizens were not satisﬁed until only but a handful of Indians were driven from its borders. This book, then, narrates the story, formerly only told in piecemeal, of the Indians of Texas and the Near Southwest [-15], (15) from the late eighteenth century to the middle nineteenth century, a period that began with the Native Americans dominating the region but ended with their disappearance from it altogether. Special thanks must be given to four people, in particular, who helped me produce this book. Three of them are friends and colleagues, as well as being among the foremost experts on colonial and antebellum Texas. Mike Campbell, Don Chipman (now retired), and Gregg Cantrell (now at Texas Christian University) all read the manuscript and corrected errors I had made concerning the non-Indian Near Southwest, as well as providing important suggestions that greatly improved the original manuscript. The fourth person is my wife, Sophie Burton, who received a Fulbright Award in 2002 to conduct research in Spain on her own dissertation, and allowed me to tag along with her to Seville. Not only did she help me translate the documents I found in the Archivo General de Indias, she also read this manuscript countless times. I now have to repay the debt by doing the same for her.

Dominance The Indians of Texas and the Near Southwest to 1786\n\nFor as long as ﬁfteen thousand years the descendents of people who migrated from Asia dominated the area now known as Texas. These ﬁrst Texans, who came to be known as Indians, adapted to the various changes in climate that occurred during the ﬁfteen or so millennia and established successful and complex cultures in the different regions they settled. Diverse groups of people, speaking numerous languages, adopted various methods that allowed them to survive, raise families, establish religious beliefs, and pass their knowledge on to succeeding generations. Some raised food crops in fertile river valleys, while others hunted animals and gathered wild fruits and nuts along the Gulf Coast and west into the interior. The various tribes arranged themselves advantageously; some moved about in small groups and others remained sedentary in populous towns. Although warfare was not uncommon, it was rarely destructive. In fact, many of the Texas Indians cooperated with one another and established extensive trade networks among themselves and with others of different regions. All embraced various creation myths and engendered beliefs about what occurred following death. By ad 1500 the Indians of Texas and the surrounding area to the north and east—the Near Southwest—were prosperous and thriving. 1 The situation began to change in the sixteenth century with the arrival of Europeans in North America. The newcomers and the native Texans ﬁrst came into contact with each other in the early sixteenth century when the Spanish explorers Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Francisco Coronado, and Luis de Moscoso separately traversed regions of the Near Southwest between the years 1528 and 1542. Although it would be another century and a half before the Spaniards permanently settled in Texas and the French in Louisiana, these initial forays, together with the Spanish colonization of New Mexico in the early seventeenth century, brought two things to the Indians that would change their lives dramatically: disease and horses. Disease started to ravage the native population of Texas shortly after initial contact, long before the Spanish and French reestablished direct contact with indigenous peoples in the late seventeenth century. Many Texas tribes adjusted well to horses, however, and\n\n[First Page] [1], (1)\n\nLines: 0 to ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [1], (1)\n\n2\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nhad incorporated them into their culture before the Europeans returned, thus greatly increasing their ability to hunt buffalo and to wage war. By the time the Spanish and French intruders did come back, the natives had adapted to the changes wrought by both disease and horses and remained the dominant force in Texas and the Near Southwest. 2 Disease began to affect the Indians of the region almost immediately following the Spanish arrival on the mainland. Because of their isolation from the Eastern Hemisphere the natives of America lacked immunity to the sicknesses that had developed across the ocean. European diseases with the ability to diffuse in advance of direct transmission, such as typhus, plague, and smallpox, caused great population loss and cultural disruption among the tribes of Texas. Epidemics of smallpox, measles, and cholera decreased population fertility, and sporadic infections killed those who were born between outbreaks. Some tribes lost as much as 95 percent of their population. Following the introduction of European diseases into the region in the early sixteenth century, at least eight recorded epidemic “events” occurred in the Near Southwest over the course of the next two hundred years. 3 These epidemics caused some tribes to disappear, while others were forced to change their lifestyle in response to the population loss. Because of the great demographic and economic changes brought on by the European presence in North America, remaining tribal groups often altered themselves culturally to forge unity with other bands in a process known as ethnogenesis. Threatened tribes created new communities tied together by intermarriage, adaptation of language, and the emergence of a new culture, effectively reinventing themselves in order to adapt to the new reality. Over time almost all of the Indian groups in the region went through the process of ethnogenesis in order to adjust to a growing European population presence. 4 Tribes living near the Gulf Coast of Texas were the ﬁrst to be affected by the foreign diseases. By 1680, on the eve of the European return, the population of the Karankawas, who lived along the Gulf Coast of Texas from Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay, had been reduced to about eight thousand individuals. During colonial times the larger Karankawan cultural entity consisted of ﬁve principle tribes tied together by language and culture. The Cocos were the most northeastern group, living primarily along the lower reaches of the Brazos and the Colorado rivers. The Carancaguases made their camps southwest of the Cocos, around Matagorda Bay. 5 The Cujanes were located near San Antonio Bay, along the lower San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers, while the Coapites lived eastward near Aransas Bay. The southernmost Karankawa tribe, the Copanes, roamed the area between Copano Bay and the mouth of the Nueces River. 6\n\n[2], (2)\n\nLines: 32\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds: [2], (2)\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n3\n\nThe ﬁve tribes shared the same Karankawan language and had similar manners and customs. The Karankawas were unusually tall; men frequently attained statures approaching six feet and were noted for their strong and robust physiques. Like most Texas Indians, the Karankawas painted and tattooed their bodies and also pierced the nipples of each breast and the lower lip with small pieces of cane. To ward off mosquitoes they often smeared their bodies with a mixture of dirt and alligator or shark grease. Karankawa men usually went naked, or wore just a deerskin breechclout; the women wore skirts of Spanish moss or animal skin that reached to the knees. 7 Although many natives died as a result of the epidemics, and some bands were forced to join with others to offset population losses, the Karankawas still maintained a hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout the European invasion. The Karankawa method of subsistence dictated that the members of the ﬁve different tribes arrange themselves into groups of only about ﬁve hundred people. As with most nomadic tribes, each group was a separate political entity. Leadership was divided between a civil chief, usually a tribal elder, and a war chief, a younger man probably appointed by the civil chief. The bands spent the fall and winter along the shoreline and the estuaries of the Texas Gulf Coast, where they ﬁshed and hunted deer. In the spring the Karankawas divided into smaller bands of about ﬁfty people and moved inland to establish camps along the rivers and creeks that emptied into the coastal bays. In these prairie riverine camps, located no more than thirty miles from the shore, the Karankawa women and children spent the summer collecting the fruits of various plants such as mustang grape, prickly pear cactus, and Texas persimmon, and the men hunted buffalo and deer. The Karankawan bands relocated when the local resources had been exhausted, usually after a few weeks at the camp. To facilitate mobility, the Karankawas lived in portable wigwams that consisted of a willow pole frame covered with animal skins and rush mats, structures large enough to accommodate seven or eight people. The Karankawas, like other nomads, kept their tools and other material possessions to a simple minimum, and like the other native Texas tribes they used stone tools and weapons before the permanent arrival of the Europeans. They crafted light baskets and pottery, lining both with asphaltum, a natural tar substance found on Gulf Coast beaches. Their principal means of transportation was a dugout canoe made by hollowing out the trunk of a large tree. Each canoe was large enough to carry an entire family and their household goods and was excellent for short voyages across the shallow, placid waters of lagoons and inlets. 8 In the interior, to the south of the Karankawas, resided a group consisting of as many as six hundred different bands that is now collectively known\n\n[3], (3)\n\nLines: 48 to ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [3], (3)\n\n4\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nas the Coahuiltecans. The numerous bands of Coahuiltecans seasonally migrated throughout one of the harshest regions of North America, eking out a marginal existence by collecting nuts and fruits, mainly prickly pear cactus and pecans. The men also hunted deer, and tribal members captured small reptiles. Constantly on the move, the Coahuiltecans constructed low, circular huts by placing reed mats and hides over bent saplings. The only container the Coahuiltecans had was either a woven bag or a ﬂexible basket. Spending most of the year under the hot Texas sun, Coahuiltecan men were nude much of the time, and the women wore deerskin skirts. Like the more successful Karankawas, the Coahuiltecans formed small bands of patrilineal kin groups led by a headman with limited authority. European diseases caused great displacement among the impoverished Coahuiltecans. By the end of the seventeenth century, perhaps as few as twenty thousand roamed throughout the entire sweep of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. 9 Another hunting and gathering group residing near the Gulf Coast was the Atakapas. Even though by the beginning of the eighteenth century they were less numerous than the Coahuiltecans, the Atakapas were more prosperous than the people living in the interior. The six thousand or so Atakapanspeakers consisted of four principal tribes: the Atacapas, Akokisas, Bidais, and Deadoses. The Atacapas and Akokisas lived near the sea and depended primarily upon gathering, hunting, and ﬁshing for subsistence. The Akokisas roamed the area around Galveston Bay and the lower Trinity River; the Atacapas lived to the east along the lower reaches of the Neches and Sabine rivers. The Bidais and Deadoses lived farther upland, between the Trinity and the Neches, and practiced small-scale agriculture while hunting deer, bear, and occasionally buffalo. 10 Although the Atakapas, particularly the Bidais and Deadoses, lived in relatively permanent villages, they were divided into separate bands, each led by a headman. In the summer the Atakapas lived in conical dwellings constructed of poles interwoven with vines; in winter they lived in bearskin tents. They manufactured pottery and cane baskets and also used skin pouches as containers. Physically, the Atakapas were short, dark, and stout. They dressed in skimpy animal skins and adorned their bodies with tattoos. Reﬂecting their close relationship with the sea, the Atakapas believed that they had emerged from the ocean in large oyster shells and had survived a large deluge by moving upland. 11 Although the introduction of European diseases affected the Gulf Coast Indians, the epidemics caused the greatest disruption between the two sedentary, agricultural tribes of the Near Southwest, the Caddoan-speaking Caddos and Wichitas. The huge population losses forced them to greatly constrict their\n\n[4], (4)\n\nLines: 56\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds: [4], (4)\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n5\n\nfarming boundaries and to rearrange the ways in which they constructed their villages. The Caddos lived on the western edge of the Eastern Woodlands in permanent villages that originally had stretched from the Trinity River north to the Arkansas. Their forest homeland allowed them to be the most productive farmers of Texas, and the surplus food raised in the Caddo ﬁelds led to the development of a sophisticated political and religious system dominated by a hereditary elite. A well-deﬁned hierarchy, led by a chief known as the caddi, exercised political power at the individual tribal level. A religious leader, called the xinesi, presided over several communities that supported him materially and treated him with great reverence. 12 Agriculture determined the arrangement of the Caddo living quarters. They lived in scattered dwellings in the midst of their ﬁelds, all of which were grouped around a central village where the elites lived. Temple mounds dominated the villages that served as ceremonial centers. Several families—about twenty people—occupied each Caddo house, well-constructed dwellings made of grass and reeds resembling a haystack. Although both men and women planted corn, beans, squash, and watermelon in the spring, during the summer men hunted for deer, bear, and small game in the surrounding forest, and the women collected wild fruits and nuts. After harvesting the crops in the fall, the men went on extensive winter hunts, sometimes heading west to stalk buffalo. Expert craftsmen fashioned quality bows made of the pliable wood of the Osage orange and also some of the ﬁnest pottery in North America. The Caddos traded these items, in addition to salt and food products, north to the great mound-building chiefdom and population center at Cahokia and west to the Pueblo villages of New Mexico. Living at the crossroads of four major trails where the Eastern Woodlands met the Great Plains, the Caddos relied heavily on trade. 13 Extreme drought, which began around 1350, combined with the introduction of European diseases two centuries later, forced the Caddos to forsake the construction of temple mound complexes, abandon the Arkansas River Valley, and move south. By the late seventeenth century, the Caddo population dropped from perhaps as many as 250,000 to as low as 15,000. The Caddos had by this time formed three loose confederacies, still dominated by the politicalreligious elite. The Kadohadacho confederacy, located near the bend of the Red River, consisted of four tribes. Farther downstream three tribes composed the least populous of the three confederacies, the Natchitoches. To the west, along the upper reaches of the Neches and Angelina rivers in east Texas, the largest confederacy, the Hasinais, consisted of nine major tribes. Two independent Caddoan-speaking tribes, the Aises and the Adaes, lived between the Hasinais and the Natchitoches. 14\n\n[5], (5)\n\nLines: 68 to ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [5], (5)\n\n6\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nThe Caddos’ linguistic kinsmen, the Wichitas, lived on the eastern edge of the Great Plains in the Arkansas River Valley. The cultural differences between the two tribes arose primarily because the Wichitas lived on the prairie and consequently relied much more on buffalo hunting than the Caddos, who lived in the forest. To maximize their productive capabilities, the Wichitas adopted a semisedentary lifestyle. In the spring and summer, they lived in ﬁxed, extended villages near their well-kept ﬁelds. The Wichitas spaced their grass lodges—which were very similar to the Caddo dwellings—at about ﬁftyfoot intervals, and between them built open-sided ediﬁces to dry and store meat and food. Being prudent, the Wichitas made sure they had good supplies of preserved food to see them through hard times. One of their most important staple items was dried pumpkin, which Wichita women prepared by cutting the hulls into long, narrow strips and weaving them into easily stored and transportable mats. In the fall, after the crops had been harvested, dried, and stored in underground pits, the entire tribe headed west to the prairies for the annual winter hunt. During this period, when the men hunted among huge buffalo herds, Wichita families lived in portable tepees made of skins. On the hunt, women skinned the buffalo and smoked the meat; on returning to their village in the spring, they tanned the hides and fashioned them into blankets and robes. Women also made earthenware pots and other cooking utensils, as well as deerskin and wolfskin pouches for storage. 15 To facilitate their farming and hunting lifestyle, the Wichitas arranged themselves in numerous independent villages that often stretched for miles. Each village was headed by a principal chief and a subordinate, both chosen by the men on the basis of physical prowess and leadership abilities. The chief ’s power was not absolute, however, and the warriors could remove him at any time. A council of the entire tribe, including women, debated important matters. Solutions to problems were reached by consensus, and dissenters were free to join other villages rather than adhere to decisions they opposed. The egalitarian nature of the Wichita political system stands in marked contrast to the hierarchical system of the Caddos. The Wichita religious system also differed from that of the Caddos in that it did not revolve around an authority ﬁgure such as the xinesi. Instead, various shamanistic societies, open to anyone who cared to join, paid homage to the important deities by performing certain ceremonies and dances. 16 While the Wichita differed culturally from their linguistic kinsmen the Caddos, they shared a susceptibility to disease; by the end of the seventeenth century the Wichita population had plummeted by more than 90 percent. The great population loss forced the 20,000 remaining Wichitas to change the manner in which they set up their villages. Instead of living in loosely arranged\n\n[6], (6)\n\nLines: 80\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds: [6], (6)\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n7\n\nsettlements of thatched houses scattered across several miles, the Wichitas shifted to compact villages located in close proximity to other towns. They also built ditches and stockades around their villages for defensive purposes. By 1700 the Wichitas had begun a southward migration that continued well into the eighteenth century. The Kichais were the southernmost of the ﬁve Wichita tribes, living along the Red River in present Lamar County, Texas. North of the Kichais were the Tawakonis, whose villages were on the Arkansas River south of presentday Tulsa. The Iscanis and the Guichitas established towns upstream on the Arkansas at the mouth of Deer Creek. The Taovayas, which became the largest Wichita group, lived to the northeast in twin villages on the Verdigris River. 17 The Texas Indians were forced to adapt not only to disease but also to horses. The Spaniards brought horses to New Mexico in the early 1600s, and by the end of the century the Indians of the region had acquired many of the animals either by seizing runaways or by poaching them from the newcomers. The horse, which ﬂourished in the open, arid country, added to the hunting abilities of the natives, increasing their range and ease of travel. Horses quickly became a commodity in the villages of most of the tribes, an item that brought wealth and power to the owners. By the time the Europeans returned to the Near Southwest in the early eighteenth century, most of the Texas Indians— including some newcomers—had to some extent incorporated the horse into daily life. In fact, a few tribes completely changed their mode of living because of the possibilities afforded by the Old World animal. 18 The Athabascan-speaking Apaches were the ﬁrst Texas tribe to successfully adapt to the horse. They had emigrated from Canada to the plains of New Mexico and west Texas during the thirteenth century. The buffalo-hunting Apaches were divided into small, nomadic bands of a few hundred people, with each band led by a chief who gained his position through displays of bravery and wisdom. The role of chief, however, was mostly advisory as the Apaches had no mechanism for enforcing authority beyond the use of peer pressure. They lived in portable buffalo-skin tepees and dressed skins to use for clothing. The Apaches quickly entered into trading arrangements with the various Pueblo villages of New Mexico, providing them with buffalo products such as dried meat and skins in return for corn, beans, blankets, pottery, and turquoise. The Spanish conquest of New Mexico in the late sixteenth century upset this proﬁtable arrangement as the Spaniards exacted heavy tax burdens on the Pueblos. The Spaniards also brought disease, which caused the number of Indians in the region to decline by two-thirds. Although the Apaches were, for the most part, spared the worst of the diseases, the declining population of the Pueblo villages robbed them of their major source of an essential dietary\n\n[7], (7)\n\nLines: 88 to ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [7], (7)\n\n8\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nelement. Therefore, many of the Apaches on the Great Plains began to establish rancherías, where they built huts and tended their own patches of corn and beans. 19 By the middle of the seventeenth century, the Apaches had come into contact with Spanish horses. Mimicking the Spaniards and the Pueblos, the Apaches mounted horses and found that they greatly added to their hunting success. Horses also increased the Apaches’ range and raiding efﬁciency, and the tribe obtained even more Spanish animals through forays along the entire northern frontier of New Spain. Apache warriors also acquired horses by trading with the Spaniards in New Mexico for Indian slaves. The decimation of the Pueblo people made the Spaniards desperate for manpower, and they sought other Indians to be used as slaves, even though Indian bondage was ofﬁcially illegal in the Spanish empire. One Apache tribe, the Lipans, took advantage of this situation and moved eastward into central Texas, where they raided other tribes. The Lipans captured Indian slaves and sold them for Spanish horses in the underground market that had been established in New Mexico by Spanish smugglers. The raiding not only allowed Lipan warriors to add to their possessions, it also afforded them honor and status, conferrals that depended upon success in battle. 20 The Lipan Apaches, whose near monopoly of the possession of horses allowed them to dominate the prairies of Texas during the latter decades of the seventeenth century, were actually an amalgamation of peoples from different tribes. The success of the Lipan Apaches after their acquisition of the horse drew other shattered groups toward them and their way of life. Various Apache groups combined with Coahuiltecan bands from the lower Rio Grande, and with the tribe known as the Jumanos—already a product of ethnogenesis—to form the Lipans. The Lipan Apaches numbered around ﬁve thousand individuals as a whole. The tribe’s new power, however, forced other Indians to acquire horses and challenge Apache control. By 1680, on the eve of Spanish and French settlement, the tribes of the Near Southwest that had been victimized by the Lipan Apache slave-raids, like the Wichitas and Caddos, had incorporated the horse into their cultures through trade, theft, or seizure of runaways. Along the Gulf Coast, the Karankawas, Coahuiltecans, and Atakapas adopted horses to a much lesser extent than the other tribes. 21 The Apaches’ success also attracted tribes from outside the area, most importantly the Shoshonean Comanches, whose adoption of the horse eventually made them the dominant tribe of the region. The Comanches emerged from the Rocky Mountains and immigrated to the southern Plains in the late seventeenth century. In this new region they learned the art of horsemanship, and by the early 1700s they had successfully wrested control of the High Plains from\n\n[8], (8)\n\nLines: 10\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds: [8], (8)\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n9\n\nthe Lipans, who were driven deeper into central Texas. The Comanches used their horses to hunt buffalo, whose products provided for most of their needs. They ate buffalo meat, used easily portable buffalo-skin tepees for shelter, and utilized buffalo skins for clothes and blankets. 22 Clearly, the Comanche lifestyle revolved around the acquisition of the horse and pursuit of the buffalo. Their nomadism caused the Comanches to adopt a ﬂuid structure, allowing band size and leadership to change with necessity. The knowledge that all of the twenty thousand or so Comanche individuals were one of the nuhmuhnuh, or “people,” allowed them to forge tight bonds and at the same time maintain an extremely ﬂexible system. The Comanches divided into small bands, each led by a peace chief chosen on the basis of his leadership abilities. His authority was limited to internal matters, and he could only give advice. A council of men sought to reach a consensus on important matters. If anyone disagreed with a decision, they were free to join another group. 23 While peace chiefs and their councils provided direction for the internal workings of the group, war chiefs led the warriors in actions that deﬁned what it meant to be a Comanche male: hunting, ﬁghting, and thieving. Comanche success depended on the ability to obtain horses—often through theft—in order to hunt buffalo. The best way for a Comanche man to obtain wealth, honor, and status was through warfare and the plundering of horses from the enemy. Horses were a medium of exchange to the Comanches; an individual could obtain women, weapons, and other necessities of life through ownership of horses. The most successful warriors obtained status through their actions and attracted other followers into battle, leading to the acquisition of more horses and increased opportunities for a prestigious standing in the band. Comanche men gained glory by dying in battle, but death at the hands of the enemy also demanded the vengeance of the living, which only escalated the constant raiding and plundering. Due to the heightened importance of warfare, Comanche men formed military societies that reinforced the martial ethos of the tribe. Ultimately, this aggressive behavior allowed the Comanches to become the paramount tribe in Texas. 24 The Tonkawas, in addition to the Lipan Apaches and the Comanches, also came to orient their culture toward nomadism lived primarily on horseback. By the late seventeenth century the Tonkawan cultural group began the process of ethnogenesis when a number of ethnic groups who roamed the southern Plains between the middle Rio Grande and the middle Arkansas River came together as a result of changes wrought by the European intrusion. Ultimately, the tribe consisted of the Tonkawan-speaking Tancagues and Mayeyes as well as the intermingled Coahuiltecan Ervipiames and Caddoan Yojuanes.

Reﬂecting the diverse origins of the tribe, Tonkawan society was divided into thirteen matrilineal clans. Individual membership in the clans cut across band divisions and bound the tribe together. Unlike the Apaches and Comanches, the Tonkawas hunted deer more than buffalo and added small mammals, birds, reptiles, ﬁsh, and shellﬁsh to their diets. In addition to game, the Tonkawas also ate a large assortment of plant foods, including herbs, roots, fruits, and seeds. Rather than living in buffalo-skin tepees, the Tonkawas constructed small, conical huts covered with brush or hides. The tribal members had few baskets and mats and obtained pottery from other tribes. Animal skins provided the scant clothing worn by Tonkawa men and women. Males wore earrings, necklaces, and other ornaments of shell, bone, and feathers, and both males and females tattooed their bodies. 26 By the late seventeenth century about one hundred thousand Indians lived in Texas and the Near Southwest. Some hunted buffalo on horseback, others employed the horse to hunt yet subsisted primarily on farm products, and others lived by hunting small game and gathering fruits and nuts. Two new European groups, the French and the Spanish, also settled in the region in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The French came to Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi Valley hoping to establish a colony of settlers and slaves that would proﬁt through trade and the development of cash crops. The Spaniards occupied Texas with soldiers, priests, and only a few settlers, with the goals of preventing the French from expanding farther southwestward into their territory and of converting the natives to Christianity. Although both empires would fall short of attaining their goals, the dominant Indians of the region proved far more receptive to French trade than to Spanish religion. In the ﬁnal decades of the seventeenth century, two groups of Indians—the Karankawas and the Hasinais—rebuffed the ﬁrst French and Spanish efforts to settle in Texas. In spite of these failures, representatives of the two countries returned in the early eighteenth century to stay. France and Spain had previously been enemies, but in 1700 the Bourbon grandson of France’s King Louis XIV, Philip V, ascended the throne of Spain, and the two nations became cautious allies for the greater part of the century. Each allowed the other to settle Louisiana and Texas, respectively, without threat of invasion or conquest. In fact, the French actually helped the Spaniards reoccupy east Texas so that they would be nearer to Louisiana. In the hope of establishing trade with New\n\n[10], (10\n\nLines: 12\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds:\n\n[10], (10\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n11\n\nSpain, a French Canadian, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, founded the post of Natchitoches on the Louisiana-Texas frontier in 1714. In spite of St. Denis’s assistance and the alliance with France, the Spaniards jealously maintained their mercantile system and ultimately forbade legal French trade in their colonies. 27 Although the French were barred from establishing legitimate trade with New Spain, the Indians permitted them to settle in their midst, this time because of the ﬁrearms and manufactured goods the Gallic interlopers provided. Guns, balls, and powder were the most important items the French sold to the natives. Weapons allowed the Indians to hunt more efﬁciently and also enhanced their military prowess. In return for their trade goods, the French wanted, among other things, buffalo skins, deerskins, and bear’s fat. The In[11], (11) dians had traditionally obtained these items for their own use, and guns made it easier for the tribesmen to be successful while hunting.

The French also pro[11], (11) vided the Indians with vanity items such as beads, combs, vermillion, mirrors, copper bracelets, and strips of scarlet colored cloth. 28 The Indians’ need for these goods opened the door for French settlement. By 1718 the French had established New Orleans as the capital of Louisiana, a colony that encompassed the entire Lower Mississippi Valley and also included the Gulf Coast east to Spanish Florida. Originally managed by several jointstock companies, the Louisiana colonists hoped to turn a proﬁt by raising crops and trading with the natives. French settlers established plantations along the Mississippi River and its tributaries and had African slaves shipped in to work their tobacco and indigo ﬁelds. French traders also traveled to the interior regions and arranged commercial alliances with the various Indian tribes. For numerous reasons—the lack of a truly valuable cash crop, the poor health of the settlers, and warfare with some of the natives—the jointstock companies failed, and in 1731 management of the colony reverted to the Crown. For the most part, immigration to Louisiana from Africa and France came to an end at this point. By 1737, however, nearly 2,500 Frenchmen and 4,500 slaves lived in the French colony. 29\n\n12\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nAlthough Louisiana had failed to make money for its stockholders, Natchitoches had succeeded in becoming the main funnel through which trade goods ﬂowed from French Louisiana into Texas and the Near Southwest. Following St. Denis’s failed attempt to introduce French goods into New Spain, the French Canadian had turned to the Caddo tribes to assist him in forming trading partnerships with the Indians of the region. By 1731, in addition to Natchitoches, the Caddos had allowed the French to establish trading posts at the Yatasi village on Bayou Pierre about ﬁfty miles northwest of town, and at the Kadohadacho village just above the bend of the Red River. From these posts, French traders circumvented the limited Spanish presence in east Texas to barter with many other tribes, most particularly the Hasinais and the Wichitas. While the French trade enriched the Caddos, living in close proximity to the Europeans continued the population decline. By midcentury the Kadohadacho confederacy had been reduced from four tribes to two, the Hasinais dropped from nine to four, and only the Yatasis and Natchitoches remained of the third group. Population loss combined with the increase in economic activities designed to attain French goods also caused the Caddos to do away with the religious position of the xinesi. 30 To gain greater access to French trade goods and to escape the attacks from their Siouan Osage enemies to the northeast, the Wichitas continued the southward migration they had begun in the previous century. By the 1750s the Tawakonis and Iscanis had moved from the Arkansas Valley to form villages near the Kichais in the area between the Sabine and Red rivers in east Texas. The Taovayas, along with the Guichitas and a few Iscanis, established the most important Wichita settlement at a place that would be one of the landmark villages of the southern Plains for the next half century. The excellent site they chose was on the Red River just west of the thin sliver of forest known as the Western Cross Timbers. On the north bank of the river, in present-day Jefferson County, Oklahoma, the Taovayas constructed an impressive fort with a twelvefoot-high stockade, surrounded by a deep trench. French traders ﬂocked to the villages (which was the farthest point upstream that could be reached by boat) to exchange goods with the tribes, who they referred to as the Panis Piques, or Pricked Pawnees, because of their tattoos. The Panis Piques also cemented a very proﬁtable alliance with the Comanches who lived to the west, and the Taovayas, Guichitas, and Iscanis established themselves as middlemen in the lucrative trade between the Comanches and the French. Comanches provided the Panis Piques with buffalo skins in return for a portion of the French goods the three Wichita tribes were receiving. The Panis Piques also supplied the nomadic Comanches with agricultural products from their ﬁelds, including the transportable mats the women wove from dried pumpkins.

Whereas the Osages were well supplied with weapons from other French traders, the Lipans increasingly found themselves outgunned by the Comanches and Wichitas. Therefore, the two tribes constantly preyed upon the Apaches for slaves, selling mainly women and children to French traders who distributed them throughout Louisiana and the West Indies. 31 Through their trading partnership, the natives and the French in Natchitoches developed particularly close ties. The two groups entered each other’s settlements with great ease, and the Louisiana-Texas frontier truly became a “middle ground,” where people from both cultures met, lived, and worked on equal terms. Indians traveled to the French village of Natchitoches to trade, drink, or meet with ofﬁcials, including St. Denis, the commandant of the post. Each year, usually in the fall or spring, many Indian chiefs—mainly Caddos or Wichitas—went downstream to receive annual gifts. Five hundred Natchitoches Indians lived nearby and provided the settlers with much-needed food and supplies. Bonds became so intimate that the Natchitoches chief, La Tete Platte (Flathead), chose to be baptized. He was buried among the French upon his death in 1755. Although not common, occasionally Frenchmen married natives under the auspices of the Catholic Church. For instance, Charles Dumont married a Natchitoches woman named Angelique, while Jean Baptiste Brevel married Anne, of the Kadohadacho tribe. Other Frenchmen developed liaisons with Indian women when they visited the native villages to trade. 32 The commercial partnership established by the Indians and French of the region was crucial to their respective economic successes. The trade stretched across the Atlantic Ocean to France where craftsmen produced the manufactured goods the Indians desired. The trade merchandise was then shipped to New Orleans where merchants purchased the goods, transferred them to smaller boats, and sent the items upriver to traders in Natchitoches. The traders, in turn, hired engagés to accompany them into the Indian villages in late autumn. The Indians, following the completion of their winter hunts, returned to the villages in the spring to exchange peltries for trade goods, which the Frenchmen would then take back to Natchitoches. Once the Red River attained high enough water levels—usually by April—the merchants sent the furs downstream to New Orleans and the cycle would begin anew for the following year. By 1766, at the end of the French period, most of the six hundred or so people who lived in Natchitoches—including 269 African slaves—were indirectly involved in some portion of the Indian trade. Although the French also planted tobacco and raised livestock, they were just as dependent on the trade as their Indian partners. 33\n\n[13], (13)\n\nLines: 152 ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [13], (13)\n\n14\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nThe Spaniards in New Spain weakly responded to the French settlement of Louisiana by occupying Texas with priests and soldiers, and a few settlers. In an effort to forestall any further French incursions, the Spaniards chose to try and win the Indians’ allegiance for their Crown by converting them to Christianity. Thus, Franciscan missionaries rather than settlers and traders spearheaded the Spanish efforts in Texas. The priests idealistically hoped to go forth with only a few soldiers for protection and seek out those Indians who wished to accept the Christian faith. The tribes would then, in Spanish terms, be “reduced” to mission life and made to “congregate” around a church built in an Indian village for religious instruction. Spanish soldiers constructed a presidio nearby to protect the priests and the local tribe from enemies. Royal regulations prevented the priests and soldiers from forcing the natives to convert or from providing them with weapons. The missionaries were only allowed to distribute items of “civilization” such as livestock, clothes, and agricultural tools. The priests wanted to teach the natives the Spanish lifestyle in order to transform them into productive subjects of the Spanish Crown who would also serve as bulwarks against foreign invasion. Although the idealistic program of the Franciscans attracted a few converts in Texas, most of the region’s natives responded with indifference, and, in some cases, with hostility. 34 By 1731 the Spaniards had anchored Texas at three vital points: the Louisiana-Texas frontier, Matagorda Bay, and San Antonio. In a futile attempt to monitor French activities, the Spanish established the Texas capital at Los Adaes, about ﬁfteen miles west of Natchitoches, near the Adaes Indian town. A presidio, manned by sixty undersupplied soldiers, protected a mission the Franciscan priests founded for the natives. The priests maintained two other missions in east Texas: one stood at the Ais Indian village, west of the Sabine River near present St. Augustine; the other was located among the Nacogdoches tribe, a member of the Hasinai confederacy. Along the lower reaches of the Guadalupe River, the Spaniards founded the mission-presidial complex known as La Bahía to protect Matagorda Bay and to attract Coahuiltecan and Karankawa Indians. Forty soldiers were stationed at La Bahía, which would be relocated to the lower San Antonio River in 1749. Although Los Adaes was the capital of Texas, San Antonio was the largest and most important establishment in Texas. Forty-four soldiers were stationed on the banks of the San Antonio River, in a presidio that protected ﬁve missions established for the Coahuiltecan tribes. Fifteen families from the Canary Islands became Texas’s ﬁrst civilian settlers when they founded the villa of San Fernando de Béxar among the San Antonio missions and presidio in 1731. The Isleño immigration, however, did little to counter the numbers of French and Indians\n\n[14], (14\n\nLines: 16\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds:\n\n[14], (14\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n15\n\nin the region as they raised the total Spanish population of Texas to only a little over ﬁve hundred people. 35 Actually, it would have mattered little how many Spaniards were sent to Texas because only a few of the Indians responded to the Franciscans’ invitation. Well supplied with French goods, no Hasinai, Ais, or Adaes Indian ever agreed to live in either of the three missions in east Texas. In 1744 the governor of Texas noted that Mission Nacogdoches had one priest and two soldiers, “but it does not and never has had one Indian reduced to mission [life].” Two decades later a visitor found that the missionary “had not one Indian to whom he could minister, nor had there been one during more than the forty years of this mission’s existence.” In 1768 a Franciscan priest regretfully concluded that “there is no hope, not even a remote one, of the reduction and congregation” of any of the east Texas tribes. Although a few Karankawas were initially attracted to the mission at La Bahía, they abandoned it in 1723 after killing the Spanish commander of the presidio. In addition to detesting the regimentation of mission life, the Karankawas were uncomfortable with the site of the mission: it had shifted farther inland in 1726 and 1749 and was located outside their familiar coastal environment. 36 The Coahuiltecans were the only Indian group of the region attracted to the Franciscans’ inducements. Poverty and pressure from Lipan Apache raiders combined to cause the Coahuiltecans to seek refuge in the missions at San Antonio and La Bahía. These missions, particularly the ones at San Antonio, greatly improved the economic well-being of the Coahuiltecans because the priests taught the Indians how to divert water from the San Antonio River to irrigate their newly established ﬁelds. Very quickly the mission Indians produced enough corn, beans, and other vegetables to supply not only themselves but also to sell to the nearby soldiers and settlers. Cattle herds offered a second food source for the Coahuiltecans, and each mission established an outlying ranch some distance from the establishment where herders tended the animals. The Indians also learned how to weave, and they began to produce cotton and woolen clothes and blankets. 37 Despite the economic success of the missions, the Coahuiltecan population declined throughout the eighteenth century. The Franciscans housed the heretofore nomads in closely concentrated quarters, which exacerbated the spread of epidemic diseases. Infant mortality rates were high under such conditions. The amount of work the Indians were expected to perform was far greater than what hunters and gatherers normally expended and, as a consequence, the Indians often ran away. Therefore, priests and soldiers used force to keep the natives in the ﬁelds. Given the high child mortality rate and the continued problem with runaways, the population at the missions could\n\n[15], (15)\n\nLines: 168 ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [15], (15)\n\n16\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nnot sustain itself. To maintain them, the priests had to continually recruit more Coahuiltecans. By the middle of the century, however, very few Coahuiltecans survived outside the church walls of San Antonio and La Bahía, and the numbers at the missions continued to fall. 38 While the Coahuiltecan population declined, the number of cattle, horses, and mules in the mission ranches—as well as those of the settlers at San Antonio—increased dramatically. An intense period of drought in the ﬁrst two decades of the eighteenth century had caused the great buffalo herds to disappear from the region south of the San Antonio River, just as the Spaniards settled in Texas. Their cattle thrived in the absence of the buffalo, which were kept from returning to the area by the spread of mesquite. Whereas buffalo refused to forage on mesquite, Spanish cattle and horses fattened up on the plant and their population grew inordinately. By the 1760s at least twenty thousand head of cattle roamed the open ranges between San Antonio and La Bahía. Actually, the numerous Spanish livestock affected the Texas Indians much more than the few Spaniards ever did. Some Indian groups raided the Spanish cattle herds to replace the buffalo as a food source; others poached horses to enrich their own herds or to sell to the French in Louisiana who were desperate for mounts. Nonetheless, the Franciscans continued to hope that some of these Indians could be reduced to mission life. 39 The availability of Spanish livestock, combined with the effects of disease and Lipan Apache pressure, caused members of a number of different tribes— mainly Tonkawas, Atakapas, and Karankawas—to come together in a community located in the middle Brazos River Valley. From this settlement, which the Spaniards called Ranchería Grande, men stole livestock from the nearby Spanish ranches. The Indians consumed the beef, but exchanged the horses with Hasinai, Bidai, Akokisa, and Coco traders who, in turn, dealt them to Frenchmen in Louisiana. The success of Ranchería Grande, however, attracted even more Apache raiders. In the hope of gaining protection from the Lipans, the Indians on the Brazos requested that the Spanish authorities establish a mission for them in 1745. The Spaniards responded by erecting three missions and a presidio along the San Gabriel River in 1748–49. The three missions grouped the Indians on the basis of tribal and linguistic similarities. One mission contained the Tonkawan Ervipiames, Mayeyes, and Yojuanes; another congregated Atakapan Akokisas, Bidais, and Deadoses; a third mission sheltered the Karankawan Cocos and Carancaguases. Lipan warriors attacked the missions almost immediately after their opening, making it apparent to the tribesmen that the Spaniards could not offer any meaningful protection from the Apaches. Most of the Indians left the San Gabriel missions soon thereafter; the Atakapas and Karankawas moved south toward the coast, while the\n\n[16], (16\n\nLines: 18\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds:\n\n[16], (16\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n17\n\nTonkawas relocated to the northeast to gain greater access to French Louisiana. The Spaniards ﬁnally abandoned the empty establishments in 1756. 40 The Franciscans persisted in trying to induce Indians to settle among them, despite the failure on the San Gabriel. In 1754 they established a new mission for the Karankawas, Nuestra Señora del Rosario, about four miles up the San Antonio River from the settlement at La Bahía. All of the Karankawan tribes occasionally visited the station to receive food and gifts, and two hundred or so actually agreed to be baptized in the ﬁrst ﬁfteen years of its existence. Most of the time, however, the Karankawas avoided Mission Rosario, preferring to remain near the coast. Nonetheless, Franciscan priests maintained the station in hope of attracting converts. The Franciscans had even less success with the mission they founded for the Bidais and Akokisas near the mouth of the Trinity River in 1756. No Indians settled at the mission, which was situated in a malarial lowland with unpotable water. The Spaniards abandoned the station after fourteen useless years. 41 The most spectacular missionary failure, and the one that best illuminates the weakness of the Spanish position in Texas, was the Franciscan effort to bring Christianity to the Lipan Apaches. The Apaches had begun making raids upon San Antonio to steal livestock almost as soon as the town was founded in 1718. For the next three decades the Lipans and Spaniards fought occasionally as the Indians sporadically assaulted the missions and civilian settlements, to which the presidial soldiers responded with punitive expeditions. By 1749, however, incessant Comanche and Wichita slave raiding—made much more effective by the increased availability of French ﬁrearms—forced the beleaguered Apaches to negotiate a peace treaty at San Antonio, and their conduct toward the Béxar community improved accordingly. The slaving expeditions, though, increased in the 1750s as Tonkawas and Caddos joined with the Comanches and Wichitas to plunder the Lipans. The raids induced the Apaches to ask their ally to establish a mission and presidio in their country in hope of gaining protection from their enemies, whom the Spaniards grouped together under the name of Norteños. The Spaniards responded by constructing a mission-presidial complex for the Apaches on the San Saba River northwest of San Antonio in 1757. 42 Although the Lipans desired Spanish military protection, they had no intention of being reduced to mission life or accepting Christianity. While a few Apaches visited the mission as they passed through the area on their way north to hunt buffalo, none agreed to give up their nomadic lifestyle and settle down. The Norteños, meanwhile, believed that the mission would provide the Lipans with a safe refuge from which to make retaliatory attacks. Therefore, in March 1758, 2,000 Norteño warriors, half of whom were carrying French\n\n[17], (17)\n\nLines: 188 ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [17], (17)\n\n18\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nguns, gathered near the mission on the San Saba. They planned to kill any Lipan they encountered and to frighten the rest of the tribe from ever returning. The Norteños, led by a fully armed Comanche chief dressed in a French army ofﬁcer’s uniform, surrounded the mission and forced the priests to let them inside the walls. When the native force found there were no Apaches present, they turned on the Spaniards, killing eight (including two priests, one of whom they decapitated), and set ﬁre to the mission. 43 The brutal attack caused the Spanish to seek retribution against the Norteños. In August 1759, Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla led an expedition consisting of 360 Spanish troops and 176 Indian allies—130 Lipan Apaches and forty-six Coahuiltecans—out from the San Saba. Two months later Ortiz Parrilla’s troops attacked the Norteños at the Taovaya village on the Red River. The well-armed natives outnumbered the Spanish-Indian force, however, and Ortiz Parrilla’s men could not penetrate the Taovayas’ palisaded village, over which ﬂew a French ﬂag. The stunned Spanish colonel was forced to retreat to the San Saba River after suffering ﬁfty-two casualties. Realizing that the Apaches feared coming to the area, in 1762 the Franciscans abandoned the mission and constructed two others for the Lipans, jointly known as El Cañón, on the headwaters of the Nueces River. The Indians avoided these missions as well, and the Spaniards discontinued them and the presidio on the San Saba nine years later. 44 By the 1760s the region’s Indians had endured having Europeans in their midst for over half a century, and almost all had come to prefer the French and their manufactured goods over the Spaniards and their religion. Nonetheless, in 1763 the Indians lost their French ally when, as a result of the defeat in the Seven Years’ War, France ceded Louisiana to Spain and turned over their possessions east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain. It became crucial to the natives of the Near Southwest, as well as to the merchants who remained in Louisiana, that Spain continue the liberal French trading policies with the Indians and not adopt the Franciscan methods that had been so ineffectual in Texas. Without weapons, the Texas Indians—in particular, the Norteños, who were seen as enemies of Spain—would be at the mercy of the Osage Indians who lived in present-day Missouri and Arkansas and had access to British traders, now poised on the east bank of the Mississippi River. Other traders, mainly Frenchmen, simply crossed the river illegally and ascended the Arkansas River to provide the Osages with weapons and manufactured goods in exchange for furs, as well as for horses and Indian slaves plundered from the Texas tribes. The Osages particularly targeted the Caddos and Wichitas on their raids.

The Spaniards, however, put these policies into effect in a piecemeal fashion that took nearly two decades to complete. Matters were complicated by the fact that Spain administered Louisiana and Texas separately; the Captaincy-General of Havana controlled Louisiana, and Texas remained under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in Mexico City. In 1769, Louisiana governor Alejandro O’Reilly initiated a reformed Spanish Indian policy in his colony. After reviewing past events, Governor O’Reilly realized that the only way to win the allegiance of the Indians was to forgo missionary efforts and to follow French methods. Tribes that had been French allies, however, would now have to pledge an oath of ﬁdelity to Spain. In return, the Spanish government would provide the tribe with annual presents and would designate distinguished leaders as chiefs, digniﬁed by decoration with great and small medals. Although O’Reilly utilized French trading policies, he made signiﬁcant modiﬁcations. Instead of being free to trade any items to any French trader who arrived at their villages, under the new policy the Indians could deal only with licensed traders, who were closely supervised by the government. The Indians were also forbidden to deal in Indian slaves and livestock, since Indian slave trade was open to abuse and dealing in livestock promoted theft from fellow Spaniards in Texas. Despite the alterations of the French trade methods, the Indians of the region would ﬁnd them acceptable, and eventually the Spaniards in Texas would adopt the same guidelines. 46 Among the tribes subject to the reformed policy was a group of newcomers to the Near Southwest. These newcomers were emigrants from the French Gulf Coast—an area delivered to Great Britain at the end of the Seven Years’ War—who had been victimized by English slave raiders from South Carolina and did not want to live under British rule. The tribes—Apalaches, Biloxis, Pascagoulas, Taensas, and a few others—shared a similar culture; they were sedentary agriculturalists who supplemented their farm produce by hunting for wild game in the forest. All of the tribes, except the Siouan Biloxis, were of Muskhogean language stock, but differences in dialect caused the various groups to adopt a pidgin grammar, called Mobilian Jargon, that served as a lingua franca. Living near the French towns of Biloxi and Mobile they had, in a similar fashion to the Natchitoches Indians, developed a pattern of close interaction with the colonists. They regularly provisioned the French towns with venison, corn, and other supplies. Women sold herbs, foodstuffs, and\n\n[19], (19)\n\nLines: 211 t ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [19], (19)\n\n20\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nbaskets to the French, and men earned wages by rowing pirogues and carrying trade merchandise. The Apalaches, having already accepted Catholicism while living near a Franciscan mission in Spanish Florida, insisted that a priest live in their town. The other tribes, however, did not accept the Christian faith. 47 These tribes began to cross into Louisiana following the transfer of the French Gulf Coast to the British in 1763. The French administrator of the colony—the Spanish did not take actual possession until 1766—allowed the Indians to settle near Rapides Post, a small village on the Red River, located midway between Natchitoches and the Mississippi River. The Frenchman welcomed the tribes, noting that they could give assistance to the boats heading upriver to Natchitoches, as well as providing foodstuffs for the city of New Orleans. The ﬁrst group to arrive at Rapides, the Apalaches, had established a village there by the beginning of 1764. During the following decade, the other tribes joined the Apalaches and settled on the banks of the Red River, as well as on nearby Bayou Bouef, a stream ﬂowing south directly to the Gulf of Mexico. By 1773 the one hundred or so Indians living near Rapides outnumbered the small French population by two to one. The Indians established farms and successfully began raising livestock. The tribes once again maintained close ties with the local Europeans; the Apalaches even used the Catholic priest at Natchitoches to baptize their children, whose godparents were often leading citizens of the old French town. 48 Creek and Choctaw refugees from east of the Mississippi also relocated to the Rapides district. The Alabamas, a Creek tribe, lived near the junction of the Coosa and Talapoosa rivers, near present-day Montgomery, in the eighteenth century. Another Creek tribe, the Coushattas, were associated with the Alabamas and resided in nearby villages. After the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War a group of Alabamas abandoned the area, moved to Louisiana, and established a village on the Red River above Rapides Post. A Choctaw group, called the Yowanis, lived north of Lake Pontchartrain before 1763, but moved to the Rapides district soon thereafter and settled on Bayou Bouef. As with the other tribes, the Alabamas and the Yowanis planted crops, raised livestock, and exchanged peltries for manufactured goods with the local French traders. 49 The emigrant Indians established close ties with the Red River’s dominant tribe, the Caddos, who were the ﬁrst group originally living west of the Mississippi to transfer their allegiance from the French to the Spanish. In early 1770, representatives of the four remaining Red River Caddo tribes met in Natchitoches with Athanase de Mézières, the newly appointed commandant. De Mézières was a Frenchman who had lived in Natchitoches since the 1740s and was a widower of the daughter of the town’s founder, St. Denis. He had traded with all of the Caddo tribes and had advised Governor O’Reilly\n\n[20], (20\n\nLines: 21\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds:\n\n[20], (20\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n21\n\nto adopt French methods of dealing with the Indians. In April, in front of de Mézières and the town’s leading citizens, the Natchitoches, Yatasis, Petit Caddos, and Kadohadachos established formal ties with Spain in return for receiving annual presents and having licensed traders stationed at their villages. Their chiefs, most notably Tinhioüen of the Kadohadachos and Cocay of the Yatasis, received the high distinction of being designated medal chiefs by de Mézières. As a result of the agreement, well-established French traders from Natchitoches returned to the Caddo villages, and the commerce, which remained highly important to both groups, resumed once again. 50 Although de Mézières also reached agreements with other Norteño tribes such as the Hasinais and the Wichitas, in addition to the Tonkawas and Atakapas, whole-scale Spanish reforms in Texas greatly complicated relations between the Indians and the Euroamericans of the colony. In 1767 the energetic reformist-minded king of Spain, Charles III, sent the Marqués de Rubí to Texas to inspect the situation there and make recommendations for improvements. As a result of Rubí’s report, the king issued the Regulation of 1772, a document designed to dramatically transform the way Spain administered Texas. Realizing that most of the province’s Indians had not responded to the ministrations of the Franciscan priests, the new rules mandated the adoption of the system Spain employed in Louisiana, that of dealing with the Indians through trade and gifts. Therefore, the Regulation of 1772 called for the abandonment of all missions and presidios in Texas, except those at San Antonio and La Bahía. Now that the French threat from Louisiana was gone, the king saw no need to maintain the capital at Los Adaes, and it, along with the few hundred settlers who lived there, was moved to San Antonio. The king also forced the Franciscans to abandon the three useless missions in east Texas. In addition, the regulations called for making peace with the Norteños at the expense of breaking the alliance with the Apaches. Departing from past policy, the king also authorized Spanish troops to launch active, offensive campaigns against enemy tribes such as the Lipans. 51 Although the Spaniards followed the king’s orders and abandoned the missions and presidios in east Texas the year after the orders were issued, it took much longer to complete the peace process with the Norteños and to initiate warfare against the Apaches. Spanish administrators in Mexico were unable to forget the massacre on the San Saba River and had doubts about the sincerity of the Norteños’ desire to make peace. Viceregal ofﬁcials blocked any attempts to provide the Indians of Texas with trade goods and also blocked de Mèzières’s efforts to negotiate a treaty with the Comanches. Things began to change in 1776 when viceregal control over Indian affairs in Texas was superseded by the creation of the Interior Provinces. This new administrative unit, which\n\n[21], (21)\n\nLines: 228 ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [21], (21)\n\n22\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nconsisted of all of the northern provinces of New Spain (including Texas, but not Louisiana), was detached from the jurisdiction of the viceroy and brought under the control of a commandant general who reported directly to the king. Free to deal with the Indians as he pleased, in 1778 the commandant general authorized de Mézières to establish peace and trade with the Norteños in order to launch a campaign, in conjunction with Spanish troops, against the Lipan Apaches. The following year, however, Charles III vetoed the plan because of Spain’s entry in the struggle against Great Britain that had risen out of the American War of Independence. It would not be until 1783, following the end of the war, that the Norteños and the Spaniards resumed their peacemaking efforts. 52 In the meantime, the Indians of Texas found other sources of European manufactured goods to supplement the meager amounts provided by the Spaniards. The Wichitas gained access to British goods through their fellow Caddoan speakers, the Skidi Pawnees, who lived on the Missouri River. The Skidis established commercial ties with British traders from Illinois who supplied the Pawnees with arms and ammunition in return for horses. The Wichitas eagerly entered into this trade, using the Skidis as middlemen, and resumed their raids upon the horse herds of San Antonio and La Bahía. In addition, illegal French traders bypassed Natchitoches and entered the Panis Piques villages by traveling up the Arkansas and crossing overland to the Red River. Comanches traveled to the Wichita villages to exchange goods with the traders. 53 The Indians of coastal Texas obtained trade goods from British ships that entered the rivers and bays to exchange items with the Karankawas and Atakapas. In fact, the Spanish abandonment of east Texas actually made it easier for these tribes to deal with illegal traders. In 1772 the Spanish commander of the presidio at La Bahía encountered a group of Cocos, Carancaguases, and Bidais near the mouth of the Brazos River hunting deer for British traders. At the mouth of the Trinity River the Spaniard met some Cocos, Akokisas, Atacapas, and Bidais awaiting the arrival of British traders who provided them with arms, ammunition, and other goods, in return for deerskins and Spanish horses and mules. These Indians also established commercial alliances with illegal French traders from Natchitoches as well as Opelousas and Attakapas, Euroamerican posts recently established in southwestern Louisiana. 54 The Lipan Apaches were the only tribe in Texas without direct access to European traders. Although the Spaniards failed to conclude the alliance with the Norteños in the 1770s, Spanish policy makers strove to isolate the Apaches. The Lipans desperately needed weapons to defend themselves for they were still subject to Norteño raiders seizing horses. Despite the Spanish attempts\n\n[22], (22\n\nLines: 23\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds:\n\n[22], (22\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n23\n\nat isolation, however, the Lipans entered into a commercial alliance with the Karankawas and Atakapas who had access to the illegal British and French traders. Like the other Indians of Texas, the Apaches preyed upon the Spanish horse herds in order to gain merchandise for trade with their Indian partners. 55 As the number of tribes receiving European manufactured goods increased, the number of Indians residing in the few remaining missions declined. In fact, the Regulation of 1772’s focus on dealing with Indians through secular means rather than spiritual had pointed toward the demise of the Franciscan missions altogether. By the 1780s the six Coahuiltecan missions (ﬁve in San Antonio and one at La Bahía) contained few Indians, and those that remained had become well-instructed Christians. Many other Coahuiltecans had been absorbed into the Hispanic communities through marriage or work. As a result, in the following decade, Spanish ofﬁcials began the process of secularizing the San Antonio missions by converting them into parishes and placing them under the control of secular priests who ministered to Christians rather than trying to convert pagans. Although the Franciscans maintained control over the mission at La Bahía for years, very few Coahuiltecans remained within its walls. 56 By the mid-1770s Karankawas rarely visited Mission Rosario. In 1778 a group of Karankawas, led by a Coapite apostate named José María, massacred a group of Spanish sailors who had landed in Matagorda Bay. Emboldened by their success, the Karankawas then attacked the mission. The Spanish commander at La Bahía responded by assembling a force of 167 men to punish the attackers, but the Karankawas used their knowledge of the marshy lowlands to successfully avoid their pursuers. Although the Spanish authorities proposed an elaborate plan for a war of extermination against the Karankawas, it was never carried out. The few Karankawas living near Mission Rosario abandoned the area completely, and in 1781 the Franciscans closed the station and transferred all the church ornaments and cattle to the missionaries at La Bahía. 57 Thus, following a century of close contact with the French and Spanish intruders, the natives of Texas and the Near Southwest had successfully forced the Spaniards to give up their efforts to convert them to Christianity and to adopt the European lifestyle. The various tribes had also compelled the Spaniards to provide them with the weapons and trade goods they desired. When the legal Spanish trade faltered, as it often did in the late eighteenth century, the Indians could turn to other sources to obtain the necessary items. Disease, however, remained a problem for the natives of the region, and their population had continued to decline during the 1700s. In 1777–78 a smallpox epidemic spread through the area and seriously reduced the number of people\n\n[23], (23)\n\nLines: 248 ———\n\n0.0pt Pg\n\n——— Normal Pag PgEnds: TEX [23], (23)\n\n24\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nin all the tribes. In spite of the sickness, the Indians of Texas and the Near Southwest still outnumbered the Euroamericans and remained the dominant force in the area. By the end of the American War of Independence in 1783, the Euroamerican and Afroamerican population of Louisiana, including West Florida (reconquered by Spain during the war), stood at 30,000 people, of whom just under half were free. Most of the settlers and their slaves lived along the banks of the Mississippi River, and their presence in the Red River Valley remained slight. Only about one hundred people (three-fourths French and one-fourth slave) lived at Rapides. The settlers planted corn and other vegetables and also raised horses and cattle. Despite losing as many as forty individuals during the epidemic of 1777–78, the three hundred or so Indians residing near the post not only outnumbered the settlers and slaves, they also had many more head of livestock. The 150 Pascagoulas that lived on the Red River were the most numerous of the area’s Indians. Mingomita, medal chief, led the tribe, which owned two hundred horses and thirty head of cattle. About thirty Apalaches resided in a village close to the Pascagoulas. Their chief, Denis, owned thirty horses and one hundred head of cattle, while the rest of the tribe had another one hundred horses and ﬁfty cows. At least thirty Alabamas and twenty-ﬁve Taensas lived nearby on the Red River. The Yowani Choctaws and the Biloxis resided in settlements along Bayou Boeuf. The sixty or so Indians were said “to have many horses.” Although the settlers complained occasionally that the Indians stole their livestock, the tribes at Rapides maintained friendly relations with the local French population and the commandant of the post, Valentin Layssard. In addition to raising livestock, the tribes grew foodstuffs, hunted deer, and exchanged peltries for manufactured goods with French traders, who occasionally provided the Indians with illegal rum. Ties between the Rapides Indians and Spanish ofﬁcials were close enough that in 1784 Louisiana governor Esteban Miró asked the Yowanis, Pascagoulas, and Biloxis to help track a maroon community of slaves residing near Lake Borgne. Although the tribesmen were willing to assist, the runaways (including their leader, San Malo) were captured before the Indians could join their pursuers. 58 While the emigrant Indians dominated Rapides Post, the growth of Natchitoches following the Spanish accession of Louisiana threatened the welfare of the nearby Caddoan allies. In the late eighteenth century Natchitoches was the only Euroamerican settlement in the Near Southwest that had a larger population than the surrounding natives. Despite the best intentions of the local French settlers, their increase had a deleterious effect on the local Adaes, Natchitoches, and Yatasi tribes; disease caused their decimation, they ceded their lands to the Euroamericans, and they turned to alcohol in despair.

Trade with the Indians continued to dominate the town’s economy. During the 1770s, a little over one hundred men—twenty-ﬁve natives of Louisiana or Canada, thirty natives of France, and forty-seven of unknown French origin—signed contracts in Natchitoches that enabled them to legally carry out commerce with the natives. Many others entered Texas illegally to trade. Despite the importance of the Indian trade, the cash crop of tobacco became increasingly signiﬁcant as the Spanish government heavily promoted\n\n26\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\ndominance\n\nits development. By 1791, eighty-three of the town’s 175 households engaged in tobacco cultivation, raising more than 700,000 pounds. To work their ﬁelds, the tobacco planters brought in more slaves, easily accessible from English and French sources. Over half (101) of the households owned slaves; eight planters owned twenty or more bondsmen. Raising cattle and horses to sell downriver was yet another way to earn a living in Natchitoches. Most settlers raised livestock, and by 1787 the townspeople owned over 2,700 head of cattle and 1,000 horses. 59 The expansion of the tobacco plantations and ranches occurred at the expense of the traditional Indian allies who lived near Natchitoches. In 1778 Tsaoua Camté, either a Natchitoches or a Yatasi Indian, sold a large tract of land upstream from the French town, to Manuel Trichel and his mother-inlaw, Magdeleine Grappe. Trichel and Grappe family members were veterans of the Indian trade, but they began raising livestock on their newly acquired land. Eventually, enough ranchers were attracted to the area that it became known as the settlement of Campti. In 1780 Hyamoc, medal chief of the Natchitoches tribe, sold land containing twenty arpents frontage to another trader, Jean Baptiste Laberry. Soon thereafter, Laberry made the transformation from Indian trader to tobacco planter. By 1790 he owned twenty-eight slaves, making him the fourth largest slave owner in town, and raised 23,000 pounds of tobacco. In 1787 the Yatasis sold land at their village to Paul Bouet Lafﬁtte, a trader who had established a ranch nearby on Bayou Pierre earlier in the decade. By the end of the 1780s Lafﬁtte had 350 cattle and seventy horses on his ranch. 60 Living in close proximity to the Euroamerican settlers around Natchitoches proved deadly to the local Caddoan tribes. Their numbers had already declined dramatically before the epidemic of 1777–78 reduced the tribes even further. By the early 1780s only about ﬁfty Adaes, led by medal chief Quemsy, survived in their old village ﬁfteen miles west of Natchitoches. About the same number of Natchitoches Indians remained in their village, now located on the Red River, six miles above the old French town. Cocay, medal chief of the Yatasis, had perished in the recent epidemic and was succeeded by his brother-in-law, who died soon thereafter. Only about seventy-ﬁve Yatasis remained on Bayou Pierre. In addition to raising crops and hunting, the desperate Indians sought to make ends meet by doing odd jobs for the inhabitants, such as rowing boats or carrying goods on horseback. Often, they used their pay to obtain liquor in the many cabarets in town. Occasionally, the natives were forced to seek other means to get drunk. In 1785 Adaes chief Quemsy paid for drinks in a tavern with his Spanish medal. The post’s commandant returned the medal to Quemsy, making “him know the grave mistake he had committed,” and ﬁned the cabaret owner. Unfortunately, the three tribes’ example of misery\n\n[26], (26\n\nLines: 27\n\n———\n\n0.0pt\n\n——— Normal PgEnds:\n\n[26], (26\n\ndominance\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n\n27\n\nset an undesirable precedent that almost all of the tribes of the region would ultimately be forced to follow. 61 The 1,500 or so Caddos, the other group of Indians living in the jurisdiction of Louisiana, remained powerful despite losing perhaps a third of their population during the epidemic of 1777–78. The Kadohadachos lived in their ancient homeland near the bend of the Red River, about two hundred miles above the French town. A series of logjams, known as the Great Raft, which greatly impeded river trafﬁc, prevented Euroamerican settlement above Campti and protected the tribe from the intrusion that plagued the Indians who lived downstream. Medal chief Tinhioüen, who was said to be “held in very high esteem by all” the tribes of the region, continued to lead the Kadohadachos. Tinhioüen also had inﬂuence over his downstream kin, the Petit Caddos, who lived on the Red River about eighty miles below the Kadohadachos. Despite the close relationship both tribes maintained with French traders, the betterarmed Osages continued to wage a damaging war against them. In the spring of 1781 the Osages attacked the two tribes and stole almost all of their horses. As a result, Tinhioüen demanded protection and more arms from Spanish ofﬁcials, who were helpless to prevent the Osage raids. Finally, in 1785 Governor Miró mediated a peace between the Osages and the Kadohadachos. In May the headmen of both tribes traveled to New Orleans for a formal conference held in the presence of the town’s notable citizens. Although Tinhioüen doubted the good faith of his Osage counterpart, Governor Miró assured the Kadohadacho caddi that the Span"
