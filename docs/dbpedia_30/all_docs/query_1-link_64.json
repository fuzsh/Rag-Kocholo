Swanton INTRODUCTION Each of the larger tribes which formerly occupied portions of the Gulf region of our country had its own peculiar characteristics, and this was as true of those known to have belonged to the same linguistic stock as of tribes alien to one another in this respect. One associates with the Natchez a developed solar worship with a temple and perpetual fire, absolutism in government, and tragic funeral rites; with the Creeks a highly developed clan system, a confederate organi- zation second in North America above Mexico to the Iroquois only, striking annual ceremonies, and prowess in war; with the Chickasaw warlike prowess of a still higher order, second to none except perhaps that exhibited by the Iroquois, and a social organization reminiscent of both Creeks and Choctaw. The feeling of a student for the Choctaw, however, might be described as of a powerful indefinite- ness. Although during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the disparity in numbers between this tribe and the Creeks was probably not so great as it later became, the Choctaw were always, it is believed, the more populous and they appear to have been six or eight times as numerous as the Chickasaw. They lived as near to the French as the Creeks did to the English and much nearer than the Chickasaw. The important relation they bore to French colonial dominion, since they covered the flank of the Louisiana colony and the mouth of the Mississippi, was well recognized, and relations between them and the French, Spaniards, and Americans in succes- sion were constant and intimate. Friends and foes alike testify to their courage, and a modified form of their language had become a trade medium which extended throughout most of the territory of the present States of Mississippi and Louisiana and along the whole of the lower Mississippi River. Yet how poorly press agented were the Choctaw is shown by the fact that this trade language received its name either from the Chickasaw or the little Mobile tribe. The fact of the matter is there were few customs observable among them sufficiently striking to attract the attention of European travelers— little “ copy stuff,” in other words, such as would interest officers of a | 2 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [Butt, 103 trading corporations or missionary societies or governmental func- tionaries back home, or such as could be used to circulate explorers’ narratives. Seemingly their unique way of disposing of the dead was the only feature of their lives thought worthy of much publicity, and that is about all that is purely Choctaw which most early writers vouchsafe us. Although a certain political centralization had been attained it was not so absolute as to have become spectacular or oppressive, and therefore interesting to white men. There were no complicated re- ligious ceremonials to arrest the attention of the foreigner and the intelligence of the native, and it is the general testimony that the Choctaw were less inclined to display their superiority to other people by trying to kill them than is usual even in more civilized societies. The significant things about them are told us in a few short sentences: That they had less territory than any of their neigh- bors but raised so much corn that they sent it to some of these others in trade, that their beliefs and customs were simple, and that they seldom left their country to fight but when attacked defended them- selves with dauntless bravery. In other words, the aboriginal Choc- taw seem to have enjoyed the enviable position of being “ just folks,” uncontaminated with the idea that they existed for the sake of a political, religious, or military organization. And apparently, like the meek and the Chinese and Hindoos, they were in process of in- heriting the earth by gradual extension of their settlements because none of their neighbors could compete with them economically. Absence of pronounced native institutions made it easy for them to take up with foreign customs and usages, so that they soon distanced all other of the Five Civilized Tribes except the Cherokee, who in many ways resembled them, and became with great rapidity poor subjects for ethnological study but successful members of the Ameri- can Nation. It is generally testified that the Creeks and Seminole, who had the most highly developed native institutions, were the slowest to become assimilated into the new political and social organ- ism which was introduced from Europe. The Chickasaw come next and the Cherokee and Choctaw adapted themselves most rapidly of all. As was said above, the story of the meek makes less exciting reading in the world to-day than the story of the aggressive, but perhaps man killing and large scale appropriation of values will not always appeal to human beings as the noblest objects of contempla- tion. However, the fact that human interest during the last two centuries has been of this character accounts for the relatively meager amount of material which it has been possible to collect for the present undertaking. While the French have left us two elab- orate descriptions of Natchez institutions and activities and a num- SWANTON] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 3 ber of shorter ones, I know of but one single effort to describe the Choctaw in a similar manner, and that relatively feeble. It is con- tained in an unpublished French Relation which I have dated tenta- tively about 1755, though it is very likely that it was written some- what earlier. It is one of the many valuable documents in the Edward E. Ayer collection of the Newberry Library, Chicago, a photostat copy of which was obtained by Mr. F. W. Hodge for the Bureau of American Ethnology at the instance of the writer some years ago. That section dealing with the Choctaw I translated into English, and it was published in 1918 as Volume V, part 2, of the Memoirs of the American Anthropological Association. The only other French writer on this tribe worthy of mention is Bossu, who does vouchsafe us some original observations, but is much briefer than his compatriot. The next writer to pay more than incidental attention to this tribe was Bernard Romans, who traveled through the territory now constituting the States of Mississippi and Florida and some other parts of the Southeast in 1770 and 1771. Volume I of his narrative was printed in New York in 1775, but Volume II was never sent to press, apparently, probably on account of the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. Copies of this work are exceedingly rare, but it contains valuable information regarding the Indians of the Gulf area, particularly the Choctaw. Of a much later period and very different in character is “A History of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Natchez Indians” by the missionary, H. B. Cushman, printed in 1899. The author presents his material in a rambling and highly emotional manner, but he had lived practically all his life in close contact with the Choctaw Indians and was nearly as well acquainted with the Chickasaw. His materia! is often of a kind that can not be duplicated. He is our only authority on certain phases of ancient Choctaw life and in consequence it has been necessary to quote him extensively. Mr. Bushnell’s little study of the Choctaw of Bayou Lacomb, Louisiana, is the only modern attempt to give an account of any Choctaw band from an ethnographical point of view and is correspondingly valuable. Henry S. Halbert was a Choctaw en- thusiast who derived considerable important information from that section of the Choctaw Indians who remain in the State of Mississippi. On certain special aspects of Choctaw life, such as their former geographical distribution, their migration legends, and their burial customs, his work is unsurpassed. Mention should also be made of the contributions of Rev. Alfred Wright, an early Choctaw missionary, to the Missionary Herald during the years 1828 and 1829, which in particular seem to give us the key to primitive Choc- taw religion. The other writers mentioned in the bibliography merely furnish us with details upon special phases of the native culture. 4 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BuLL, 103 Even more than in my previous papers, I have pursued the policy in this bulletin of constructing a source book for the tribe under dis- cussion. On account of the rapid disappearance of the ancient customs, little can be gathered at the present day that has not already been recorded in a much more complete form. I have, however, added some notes obtained from one of the eastern Choctaw Indians named Olmon Comby and a considerable body of material from an- other eastern Choctaw, Simpson Tubby, for many years a preacher in the Methodist Church. HISTORICAL SKETCH The history of the Choctaw people since they first came to the knowledge of Europeans may be illustrated from many documentary sources and is capable of elaborate treatment. A few salient points are all that the present work calls for. Halbert has pointed out that the “Apafalaya” chief and river and the “ Pafallaya” province mentioned by the De Soto chroniclers Ranjel and Elvas, respectively, evidently refer to the Choctaw, or a part of them, since the Choctaw were known to other tribes as Pa*s- falaya or “ Long Hairs.” They were then, it would seem, approxi- mately in the territory in southeastern Mississippi which they occu- pied when they were again visited by Europeans. There are notices of them in some Spanish documents dating from toward the close of the seventeenth century, and they immediately took a prominent position in the politics of colonizing nations when the French began settling Louisiana in 1699. Like the Creeks and Chickasaw, they were subjected to pressure from the Spaniards, English, and French, especially the two latter nations, each of whom enjoyed the support of a faction. These internal differences eventuated in civil war during which the Sixtowns, Chickasawhay and Coosa Choctaw - supported the French interest and were finally successful, peace being made in 1750. The ascendency of the English east of the Mississippi, secured by the peace of 1763, soon tended to allay all re- maining internal difficulties. With the passage of the Louisiana Ter- ritory into the hands of the United States an end was put to that intriguing by the representatives of rival European governments of which the Choctaw had been victims. The Choctaw were never at war with the Americans. A few were induced by Tecumseh to ally themselves with the hostile Creeks, but the Nation as a whole was kept out of anti-American alliances by the influence of Apushmataha, greatest of all Choctaw chiefs. (PL.1.) However, white settlers began pouring into the region so rapidly that the Mississippi Territory was erected in 1798 and Mississippi became a State in 1817. Friction of course developed between the white col- SwaNTOon ] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 5 onists and the original occupants of the soil, whose removal to lands farther west was clamorously urged by the settlers and ultimately agreed to by the Choctaw themselves at the treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, September 27 and 28, 1830. By this treaty they secured a tract of land along Red River, in the southeastern part of the present State of Oklahoma, to which the bulk of the tribe emigrated in 1831, 1832, and 1833. The first emigrants suffered cruelly, but those who went later sowed their fields promptly and experienced fewer hardships than the Indians of most of the other expatriated tribes. A portion held on in their old territories, though bands of them joined their western kindred from time to time, 1,000 in 1846, 1,619 in 1847, 118 in 1848, 547 in 1849, 388 in 1853, and more than 300 in 1854. A con- siderable body still remained, numbering 1,253 in 1910 and 1,665 in 1930. In 1855 the Chickasaw, who had at first enjoyed the privilege of settling indiscriminately among the Choctaw, were given a sepa- rate territory west of the latter, and an independent government. The history of the Choctaw national government in Oklahoma would constitute an interesting contribution to our knowledge of native American capabilities in the handling of their affairs under a frame imported from abroad. Like the governments of the other four red republics of the old Indian Territory, it is now of course a thing of the past, the Choctaw being citizens of Oklahoma and of the United States. THE ORIGIN LEGEND There are two forms of the Choctaw origin legend, and both are suggested in the following passage from Du Pratz, which perhaps contains our earliest reference to it: According to the tradition of the natives this nation passed so rapidly from one land to another and arrived so suddenly in the country which it occupies that, when I asked them from whence the Chat-kas came, to express the suddenness of their appearance they replied that they had come out from under the earth. Their great numbers imposed respect on the nations near which they passed, but their wholly unmartial character did not inspire them with any lust of conquest, so that they entered an uninhabited country the possession of which no one disputed with them. They have not molested their neighbors, and the latter did not dare to test their bravery; this is doubtless why they have grown, and augmented to their present numbers.” Romans (1771) says: These people are the only nation from whom I could learn any idea of a traditional account of a first origin; and that is their coming out of a hole in the ground, which they shew between their nation and the Chickasaws; they tell us also that their neighbours were surprised at seeing a people rise at once out of the earth? 1Du Pratz, Hist. de La Louisiane, 11, pp. 216-217. Paris, 1758. 2 Romans, B., Nat. Hist. of E. and W. Fla., p. 71. New York, 1775, 6 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BuLu. 103 Adair, a still earlier English writer, does not give a Choctaw migration story distinct from that which he obtained from the Chick- asaw.2 In the latter the Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Chakchiuma are represented as having come from the west “as one people.” How- ever, he vouchsafes us our earliest description of the hill of Nanih Waiya, the site of the hole out of which Romans tells us this nation came, About 12 miles from the upper northern parts of the Choktah country, there stand on a level tract of land, the north-side of a creek, and within arrow-shot of it, two oblong mounds of earth, which were old garrisons, in an equal direction with each other, and about two arrow-shots apart. A broad deep ditch inclosed those two fortresses, and there they raised an high breast-work, to secure their houses from the invading enemy. This was a stupendous piece of work, for so small a number of savages, as could support themselves in it; their working instruments being only of stone and wood. They called those old fortresses Nanne Yah, “the hills, or mounts, of God.” * As usual, Adair has allowed himself to be carried away by his theory of a Hebrew origin of the American Indians. The “ Vanne Yah” is actually Nanih Waiya, and, although he has translated the first word correctly, the second certainly has no reference to the Hebrew Yahweh. Most recent authorities, including the noted Choc- taw student, H. S. Halbert, spell this name Nanih Waiya. Halbert says: The adjective Waiya signifies ‘“ bending,” “leaning over,” but it is difficult to see the appropriateness of the term as applied to the mound. According to the conjecture of the writer, the term was originally applied to the circular rampart, which the Choctaws may have considered a kind of bending hill. And in process of time the name could have become so extended as to be applied to the mound and rampart conjointly, and ultimately restricted to the mound alone, as is now the case in popular usage.° Schermerhorn (1814) tells us that An old Indian gave ...a very rational explication of the [Choctaw] tradi- tion, that they sprung out of the mound between the forks of Pearl River. The banks of these streams are a marsh, and at that time probably formed an impassable ravine. There is an embankment, which served as a fortification from one branch to the other, and which, with the ravines, encloses an area of nearly three miles. He observed to the agent, S. Dinsmore, “that their ancestors, when they arrived in this country, knew net what the inhabitants were; for their own protection, therefore, they cast up this mound, and en- closed and fortified this area, to plant their corn, and as a defence against enemies. This mound served as a place for look-out, to give notice of the approach of invaders. When this was accomplished, they sent out their hunters to see what were the inhabitants of the land. These on their return reported, that they could dwell in safety, that the land was good, and game in abundance. a 3See Forty-fourth Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethnol., p. 174. 4 Adair, Hist. Amer. Inds., pp. 377-378. 5 Pubs. Miss, Hist, Soc. II, p. 224, For another explanation of the name see p. 13. Swanton] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 7 On this they left their encampment as it may be called, and settled in different parts of the country. From this arose the tradition that they sprung or crept out of the mound.” ° Dr. Gideon Lincecum, another early authority, accepts the same translation of Nanih Waiya as does Halbert, but adds that the hill was so called because “it leaned toward the creek ”; Catlin renders the name “the sloping hill”; Alfred Wright, “the stooping or sloping hill”; Cushman, “the leaning mound.” That some physical pecu- liarity gave rise to the name is probable, but with the lapse of time its exact nature has been lost and it is unlikely that it can be re- covered. On the other hand, some plausible suggestions may be made regarding the localization of the origin legend at this place. As intimated above, there are two forms of this story, one treating Nanih Waiya as the point of exit to the upper world of the ancestral Choctaw, the other as their center of distribution after they had immigrated from the west. It is probable that the tradition of a western origin was in part correct, but whether it was so or not the prominence of the hill in Choctaw history is easily accounted for, because (1) it is a conspicuous landmark in the midst of one of the most fertile sections of the old Choctaw country, (2) within a mile there is a considerable cave tending to localize the tradition of a subterranean origin which nearly all southeastern tribes enter- tain, and (3) the word waiya happens to be very similar to another Choctaw word, waya, which signifies “to bear,’ “to bring forth.” Indeed, Nanih Waya may have been the earlier form, but it is less common to find a term of purely mythic significance etymologized over into a physical description than evolution in the opposite direc- tion. However, we must not forget the statement of Schoolcraft’s Chickasaw informant to the effect that the Indians of that tribe called the mounds in their country “navels.” As Halbert points out, the spelling “ Warrior,” which appears on some of our maps instead of Waiya, is a barbarism. The next description of the mound, or rather the mound system, is by Doctor Lincecum : I visited this celebrated mound in 1843. I found it a rounded off, oblong square, 200 yards in circumference at its base; 80 feet in height, with a flat space on the top 52 yards in length by 25 yards in width. The whole mound was thickly set with forest trees. 200 yards to the north of it is a lake, which I suppose to be the place whence they carried the earth to construct the mound. Speaking of the earthen rampart, he continues: I went all around this earth wall. ... It seemed to be a complete circle, and from one and a half to two miles in circumference, the southeastern portion ®Schermerhorn, Report on the Western Indians, in Mass. Hist. Soc. Coll., series 2. vol. II, p. 17. 8 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BULL. 103 cutting the bluff of Nunih Waya creek. Many places in the wall were still eight feet in height. The two gaps in the wall had never been filled up.’ Prof. Calvin S. Brown has published a brief but very interesting account of the Nanih Waiya earthworks, arranged from the manu- script notes of B. L. C. Wailes, who visited them on the 5th of December, 1854. I visited the Indian mounds and entrenchment in the fork of Nanawaya and Tallahaya, identified by tradition as the place of origin or the birth-place of the Choctaws, who held it in superstitious reverence as their mother. The height of the principal mound is at least 50 feet; it is a parallelogram with corners rounded by plowing; dimrensions 180 or 200 feet east and west by perhaps 100 or 105 [1507] feet north and south. Some 200 yards to the north of the high mound is a cone covering more extent, but only about 10 feet high. Some small mounds nearly obliterated are between the two large ones. The wall or entrenchment goes around three sides of the mound and in many places in the woods has trees of 4 feet diameter growing upon it. The height in the most elevated places is near 10 feet, the width 30 or 40 feet; in other places it dwindles away to a slight embankment; in the clear land east of the mounds it can scarcely be traced owing to the constant plowing. Many gaps or gate-ways have been left in the wall, some of them 100 feet wide. The enclosure embraces about a section or square mile. * More detailed is the description by Halbert: Nanih Waiya is situated on the west side of Nanih Waiya Creek, about 50 yards from it, in the southern part of Winston County, and about four hun- dred yards from the Neshoba County line. The mound is oblong in shape, lying northwest and southeast, and about forty feet in height. Its base covers about an acre. The mound stands on the southeastern edge of a circular rampart, which is about a mile and a half in circumference. In using the word “circular” reference is made to the original form of the rampart, about one-half of which is utterly obliterated by the plow, leaving only a semi- circle. This rampart is not, or rather was not, a continuous circle, so to speak, as it has along at intervals a number of vacant places or gaps, ranging from fifty to one hundred and fifty yards in length. All the sections near the mound have long since been levelled by the plow, and in other places some of the sections have been much reduced. But on the north, where the rampart traverses a primeval forest it is still five feet high and twenty feet broad at the base. The process of obliteration has been very great since 1877, when the writer first saw Nanih Waiya. Some of the sections that could then be clearly traced in the fields on the west have now (1899) utterly disappeared. About two hundred and fifty yards north of Nanih Waiya is a small mound, evidently a burial mound, as can be safely stated from the numerous fragments of human bones that have been exhumed from it by the plow and the hoe. The great number of stone relics, mostly broken, scat- tered for hundreds of yards around Nanih Waiya, shows that it was the site of prehistoric habitations. In addition to this, the bullets and other relics of European manufacture evidence the continuity of occupancy down within the historic period. The magnitude of these ancient works—the mound and a A Ee 7 Pubs. Miss. Hist. Soc., vim, pp. 530, 542, footnotes, ® Brown, Calvin 8S. Archeology of Mississippi, Mississippi Geological Survey.

It should here be stated that the symmetry of the mound has been somewhat marred by a tunnel which was cut into it in the summer of 1896 by some treasure-seekers, who vainly hoped to unearth some wonderful bonanza from out the deep bosom of Nanih Waiya.’... The ravages of civilization have still spared some traces of two broad, deeply worn roads or highways connected with the mound, in which now stand large oak trees. The remnant of one of these highways, several hundred yards long, can be seen on the east side of the creek, running toward the southeast. The other is on the west side of the creek, the traces nearest the mound being at the northeastern part of the rampart, thence running towards the north. Many years ago this latter road was traced by an old citizen of Winston County full twenty miles to the north until it was lost in Noxubee swamp, in the northeastern part of Winston County.” Correct measurements of the works are contained in Doctor Brown’s book. The famous Nanih Waiya ... stands in Winston County about ten miles south-east of Noxapater. The name signifies in Choctaw “slanting hill.” It is a typical rectangular mound, 218 feet long by 140 feet wide at the base, thus covering seven-tenths of an acre. The axis is north-west by south-east. The dimensions of the flat top are 132 feet by 56 feet, the area being one- sixth of an acre. The height is 22 feet, in some places nearly 25 feet. The slopes of the mound are covered with trees; the top seems to have been culti- vated. A heavy rain set in during my survey of the site, July 6, 1917, and prevented a completion of my study. I visited the site again on August 3, 1923, and located one section of the earth-wall or rampart near the residence, more than half a mile from the great mound. This section of the wall is now 2.5 to 4 feet high and about a hundred yards long. The resident on the farm states that four sections of the earth-wall still exist. The low mound about 250 yards to the north- east of the great mound is now about 7 or § feet high, and very much spread by cultivation. Artifacts are scarce. The great Nanih Waiya retains its original height and is still in a state of excellent preservation, tho the small mounds and the wall have been much reduced. This historic mound should be preserved for all time to come.” The writer examined this interesting spot in May, 1918, and took photographs of the principal mound and the small mound. (PI. 2.) From a former owner he learned definitely that the top had been cultivated, as Professor Brown supposes. The interest of the site itself and the web of traditions attaching to it should move the State of Mississippi to adopt Professor Brown’s recommendation by ob- taining permanent possession of it and securing the old structures for all time against the destructive influences to which they are now exposed. ® Pubs.

The large mound is without doubt that upon which the public buildings were placed. From what Halbert says, the smaller mound is identi- fied as a burial mound, while the engirdling rampart is undoubtedly just what almost every visitor to the spot from Adair down has taken it to be, the remains of a work defending the settlement about the mounds and undoubtedly crowned with a stockade interrupted at intervals by towers. It was in such a good state of repair when Adair wrote that it does not seem likely it had been long abandoned. The first and most natural supposition is that this was a Choctaw town stockaded to protect their northern frontier against the Chickasaw. We know from several of the older writers that the stockaded towns of the Choctaw were on their east against the Creeks and their north against the Chickasaws; indeed, the compiler of the French Relation of 1755 mentions a town called “ Ougoulatanap,” “ War- riors’ town,” which he describes as “ near the Chiquachas on the trail from the Alibamons, and has a fort, because these two nations are very often at war together.” This may have been on the site of Nanih Waiya itself, although from Adair’s description it is probable that the latter had been abandoned as a permanent native residence shortly before French and English explorers arrived, a fact which would not have prevented the appearance of those “ bullets and other relics of European manufacture ” to which Halbert refers, since the place no doubt had many temporary occupants long after it had been given up as a permanent residence. The large mound is of a type characteristic of the Creeks, Chickasaw, and lower Mississippi tribes rather than the Choctaw, a possible indication that the group repre- sents two distinct periods and as many distinct tribes. Several later versions of the migration legend may now be given. The first is from Catlin (1832-1839) : The Choctaws a great many winters ago commenced moving from the country where they then lived, which was a great distance to the west of the great river and the mountains of snow, and they were a great many years on their way. A great medicine man led them the whole way, by going before with a red pole, which he stuck in the ground every night where they encamped. This pole was every morning found leaning to the east, and he told them that they must continue to travel to the east until the pole would stand upright in their encampment, and that there the Great Spirit had directed that they should live. At a place which they named Nah-ne-wa-ye (the sloping hill) the pole stood straight up, where they pitched their encampment, which was 1 mile square, with the men encamped on the outside and the women and children in the center, which remains the center of the old Choctaw Nation.12 Nanih Waiya is hardly the center of the old Choctaw Nation except in a metaphorical sense. Somewhat older is the version which Gat- #2 Smithsonian Report for 1885, Part II, p. 213. SWANTON J CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 11 schet, and after him Halbert, considered “ the most circumstantial.” It was communicated to the Missionary Herald by Rev. Alfred Wright, and published in 1828. They say, that the Creeks, Chickasaws, and Choctaws emigrated together, from a distant country far to the west. The Creeks were in front; the Choc- taws in the rear. The Choctaws emigrated under the conduct of a great leader and prophet. While residing at the west, they were led to believe, that there Was a good country at a great distance towards the rising of the sun, and they were induced to take a long and perilous journey in search of it. Some of them state, that in consequence of the great distance, their provisions failed, and they stopped during the warm season to plant corn to furnish themselves with food for the remainder of the journey. Their great leader and prophet had the direction of all their movements on their journey. He carried the hobuna, sacred bag, containing all their sacred things, and a long white pole aus the badge of his authority. When he planted the white pole, it was a signal for their encamping. He was always careful to set this pole perpen- dicularly, and to suspend upon it the sacred bag. None were allowed to come near it, and no one but himself might touch it. During the time of their encampment, whether for one night or more, the pole was invariably found to alter its position, and incline towards the rising of the sun. This was a signal for them to proceed on their journey. The pole continued to incline towards the east until they reached Nunih waiya, and there it remained in its perpendicular position. From this they concluded, that they had found the country of which they were in search. They remained at this place under the direction of their leader, and there adopted their civil policy. This account seems probable. For it is evident that the present inhabitants of this part of the country must, at some former period, have emigrated from the west. The Chickasaws are said generally to retain a traditional knowledge of the emigra- tion of their ancestors from the west. The Choctaws in this part of the nation appear generally to have lost all knowledge of such an event, and refer their origin to Nunih waiya. The aged interpreter before mentioned supposes, that when the Choctaws arrived at the country they now inhabit, they killed or drove out by force, the former inhabitants, and having obtained possession of their land by injustice and violence, they wished to erase from their history the memory of such a transaction, and from motives of policy, endeavored to prevent the knowledge of their emigration from being transmitted to posterity, and therefore inculeated the belief that they were created at Nunih waiya, where he supposes they adopted their regulations. And in this way he under- takes to account for the prevalence of this belief; and also for the ignorance of the Choctaws with respect to their emigration from the west.” The motive mentioned has certainly operated in some cases, but it is rather more likely that a subterranean origin myth became local- ized at Nanih Waiya for historical, social, and topographical reasons, some of which have already been given, and the immigration from the west is probably correct as applying to at least a part of the Choctaw people. But if Wright’s narrative is considered “ circumstantial,’ what shall be said of that written by Dr. Gideon Lincecum and published 18 The Missionary Herald, Vol. xXIv, pp. 215-216, Boston, 1828. 12 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [Buty 103 by the Mississippi Historical Society? Here we have an elaborate story which purports to detail the various movements of the tribe during that ancient migration, the councils they held, the speeches delivered, and the motives that actuated the various leaders and factions in a manner worthy of a Spanish chronicler, and in fact recalling the Fidalgo of Elvas. However, there can be no question that Lincecum knew the Choctaw thoroughly, and much of the tale is interesting on account of the ethnological information which it contains, whether it be part of the original story or a later ampli- fication. It is put into the mouth of a native informant. We will, therefore, take the liberty to incorporate the entire narrative, which begins abruptly, thus: The chief halted the advance body of Choctaws on a little river to wait until scouts could be sent forward to explore the region of country round about; and to give time for the aged and feeble and those who were overloaded to come up. Many of the families were loaded with so many of the bones of their deceased relatives that they could carry nothing else, and they got along very slowly. At this stage of their long journey there were a greater number of skeletons being packed along by the people than there were of the living. The smallest families were heaviest loaded; and such were their adoration and affection for these dry bones that before they could consent to leave them on the way, they would, having more bones than they could pack at one load, earry forward a part of them half a day’s journey, and returning for the remainder, bring them up the next day. By this double traveling over the route, they were soon left a great distance in the rear. They would have preferred to die and rot with these bones in the wilderness, sooner than leave them behind. The minko looked upon the notions of the people in regard to the extraordi- nary and overwhelming burthen of bones as a great evil; and he cast in his mind for some plausible excuse to rid the people of a burthen that was as useless as it was oppressive to them. And now the scouts had returned and the reports they made of quite an extensive excursion were very favorable and encouraging. They stated that everywhere, and in all directions, they found game of all sorts, fish and fowl and fruits in abundance; tall trees and running brooks; altogether they looked upon it as the most desirable and plentiful region they had found during their pilgrimage. They also stated, that the most convenient place they had found, for a winter encampment, lay in a southeasterly direction at the junction of three large creeks, which coming together at the same point, formed an im- mense lowland, and a considerable river. In the fork of the first and the middle creeks lay an extensive range of dry, good lands, covered with tall trees of various kinds, grapes, nuts, and acorns; and rivulets (bok ushi) of running water. For the multitude, it was distant eight or ten days’ travel, and the route would be less and less difficult to that place. At the rising of the sun on the ensuing morning, the leader’s pole was observed to be inclining to the southeast, and the people were moving off quite early. The nights were becoming cooler, and they desired to have time to prepare shelter before the winter rains should commence. The chief, with the Isht Ahullo, who carried the sacred pole, went in front, and being good walkers, they traveled rapidly until they came to the place which had been designated. Great numbers of the stronger and more athletic people came up the same day. SWANTON] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 1 BS Early on the next morning the chief went to observe the leader’s pole, which, at the moment of sunrise, danced and punched itself deeper into the ground; and after some time settled in a perpendicular position, without having nodded or bowed in any direction. Seeing which the chief said, “It is well. We have arrived at our winter encampment.” He gave instructions to the tool carriers to lay off the encampment for the iksas and mark on posts their appropriate symbols. He ordered them to allow sufficient space for the iksas, having par- ticular regard to the watering places. It was several days before the people had all reached the encampment. Those who were packing the double loads of bones came in several days later, and they complained of being greatly fatigued. They mourned and said, “The bad spirit has killed our kindred; to pack their bones any further will kill us, and we shall have no name amongst the iksas of this great nation. Oh! when will this long journey come to an end?” There were plenty of pine and cypress trees and palmetto; and in a short time the people had constructed sufficient tents to shelter themselves from the rain. Their hunters with but little labor supplied the camps with plenty of bear meat; and the women and children collected quantities of acorns and oksak kapko, and kapun (large hickory nuts, and scaly barks). It was an extremely plentiful land, and the whole people were rejoicing at the prospects for a pleasant and bountiful winter. Their camps being completed, the chief gave instructions, to have sufficient ground prepared to plant what seed corn might be found in the camps. Search was made by Isi maleli (Running Deer) for the corn. He found a few ears only; they had been preserved by the very old people, who had no teeth. The corn they found was two years old, and they were very much afraid that it was dead. The minko suggested to Isi maleli, that as the tool carriers had iron [!] implements with which to break the ground, it would be best to detail a sufficient number of them to prepare ground to grow it. So the minko called out twenty of the tool carriers for the purpose, and appointed the wise Isi maleli, to direct them, and to select the soil for growing the corn properly, and to preserve it when it matured. One end or side of the encampment lay along the elevated ground—bordering the low lands on the west side of the middle creek. Just above the uppermost camps, and overhanging the creek, was a steep little hill with a hole in one side. As it leaned towards the creek, the people called it the leaning hill (nunih waya).™\" From this little hill the encampment took its name, ‘ Nunih Waya,” by which name it is known to this day. The whole people were healthy at Nunih Waya. Full of life and cheerfulness, they danced and played a great deal. Their scouts had made wide excursions around the encampment, and finding no signs of the enemy in any direction, they consoled themselves with the idea, that they had traveled beyond his reach. The scouts and hunters, on returning into camps, from their exploring expeditions, were often heard to say, “The plentiful, fruitful land of tall trees and running waters, spoken of by our great and wise chiefs, who saw it in a vision of the night, is found. We have found the land of plenty, and our great journey is at an end.” They passed through their first winter at Nunih Waya quite pleasantly. Spring opened finely. Their few ears of corn came up well and grew off wonderfully. The creeks were full of fish and the mornings rang with the turkeys and singing birds. The woods everywhere were full of buffalo, bear, deer and elks; everything that could be wished for was there, and easily procured. All were filled with gladness. 13a The spelling of Nunih Waiya is not quite accurate. 14 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BuLL. 103 And when the time for the green corn dance was near, the hunters brought into the camps wonderful quantities of fat meat, and they celebrated this dance five days. They did not eat of their corn, but that it might be properly called the green corn dance, they erected a pine pole in the center of the dance ground, and upon this they suspended a single ear of green corn. When they had finished this, their forty-third green corn dance in the wilder- ness, the people began to be concerned as to the probabilities of their having to journey further. Many of them declared that if the sacred pole should indicate a removal, it would be impossible for them to go farther, on account of the great number of bones that had accumulated on their long journey. They could not carry the bones, neither could they think of leaving them behind. The chief had for some time been considering the great inconvenience the marvelous amount of bones had become to the nation. He knew very well, the feelings of the people on the subject, and how difficult it woul! be to get them to consent to abandon the useless encumbrance. He could see very plainly, that should they have to go further, a portion of the people, under their present impressions in regard to the dry bones, would be most certainly left behind. On hearing the murmuring suggestions of so many of the people, every day, about the bones of their deceased relatives, and the sacred duty incumbent on the living to preserve and take care of them, he was convinced that the subject must be approached with caution. Yet, the oppressive, progress-checking nature of the burdens was such that they must be disposed of in some way. He called a council of the leaders of the iksas, and in a very prudent and cautious manner, consulted them in behalf of the suffering people, enquiring of them at the same time, if it was possible to invent any means that would aid them in the transportation of their enormous packs of useless dry bones. It was a subject they had not before thought of, and they required a day or two to make up their minds. Time was granted to them, and in the meantime the minko convened with many of the people [to consult] about it. The council met again, and there was some discussion, but nothing conclu- sive. They were loath to speak of the bones of their deceased friends and relatives. They had packed their bones a great way, and for years; but there had been no conversation, no consultation, on the subject. There were among the young people, many who were carrying heavy packs of bones, who had never heard, and who really did not know, whose bones they were carrying. They had grown up with the bones on their backs, and had packed them faith- fully, but never having heard the name of their original owners, they could tell nothing, nor did they know anything about them. That the spirits hovered about their bones to see that they were respectfully cared for, and that they would be offended and punished with bad luck, sickness, or even death for indignities, or neglect of their bones, every one knew. It was a great indignity to the spirits to repeat the names they were known by during their mundane existence. The greater part of the living who were then in the camp, had been born and reared in the wilderness, and were still packing the bones of those who had lived long before and of whom they knew nothing. Yet they worried along with heavy loads of these dry bones on their journey, in gocd faith, and in a full belief of its necessity as a sacred duty. The leaders of the iksas, who were not in council, were carrying heavy loads of bones themselves which they could not consent to part with; and they esteemed it a subject of too much delicacy to be caviled about in a council. They did not wish to say anything further about it, anyway. SwaNTon J CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 15 One of the Isht ahullos,* who was an old man, and who had long been a secret teacher, among the women and children, on the nature and wants of the spirit world and the causes that made it necessary to pack the bones of the dead, arose from his seat and said: “Some people can make very light talk about the bones of our deceased friends and relatives. Those sacred relics of our loved ones, who have passed away from our sight are to be irreverently stigmatized by the name of ‘ oppres- sive burthen,’ ‘useless incumbrance,’ and the like. Awful! And it was our chief who could dare to apply the uncivil epithet to the precious and far-fetched treasures. From all these things, I am forced, unwillingly, to infer that the next thing the chief has to propose for your consideration will be for you to east away this ‘ oppressive burthen.’ Shameful! (Hofahya.) This thing must not be. This people must not cast away the precious remains of the fathers and mothers of this nation. They are charged by the spirits, who are hovering thick around us now, to take care of them; and carry them whithersoever the nation moves. And this we must not, we dare not fail to do. Were we to cast away the bones of our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, for the wild dogs to gnaw in the wilderness, our hunters could kill no more meat; hunger and disease would follow; then confusion and death would come; and the wild dogs would become fat on the unscaffolded carcasses of this unfeeling nation of forgetful people. The vengeance of the offended spirits would be poured out upon this foolish nation.” The council before which the Isht ahullo made this appeal to the religious sentiment of the tribe was only an assembly of the leaders of the iksas. The people were not present, and did not hear it. The chief, however, was fully apprised of the secret action of these bad men; and to counteract their dark and mischievous influence on the minds of the people, he dismissed the Isht ahullos, and leaders of the iksas, with a severe reprimand, telling them plainly that he had no further business for them to attend to. Then turning to the Isht ahullo, and at the same time pointing at him with an arrow, [he] said: “When you again get in council with the lazy, bad hearted men to which you belong, tell them that the time has come when you must be cautious how you meddle with the affairs of this nation. Hear my words.” The minko, returning to his tent, sent for Long Arrow, to whom he com- municated his designs as to the disposition of the dry bones; after which he directed him to send the tool carriers to the iksas, and instruct them to summon every man, woman and child, except the leaders of the clans and the conjurers of all grades. The minko said: “Tell the people to assemble at the dance ground early in the day, to- morrow. I wish tv consult them on important national business. Let the people, except those I have named, all know it before they sleep.” In accordance with the notice sent by the chief, the entire tribe, male and female, old and young, except the yushpakammi™” and the leaders, came. These were not found in the great assembly. But the healthy, clean washed, bright, cheerful people were all present, and seated at the time the minko came to his place on the council ground. The minko looked around on the multitude, and very calmly speaking, ad- dressed them as follows: “Tt is to you my brothers, my sisters, my countrymen, that I wish to declare my thoughts this day. I lock around upon the bright, cheerful countenances of the multitude and I feel assured that you will hear my words; and that you will hearken to my counsels. You are a great people, a wonderful people, a 14 “6 Miracle Workers,” “ Conjurers.” 18 “* Wizards.” 16 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [Buty 103 people of strength, of unparalleled courage and untiring, patient industry. Your goodness of heart has caused you to work and hunt, far beyond the needs of your families, to gain a surplus, to feed a lazy, gluttonous set of hangers on, whose aim it is to misdirect you, whose counsels are all false, and whose great- est desire is confusion and discord amongst this peaceful, happy people. I know the meaning of my words. I speak them boldly and intentionally, I do not catch you in a corner, one at a time, and secretly communicate to you messages from the spirit land; packing you with enormous and insupportable burthens, to gratify wicked and discontented spirits, who are, as you are told, hovering about the camps, threatening mischief. But I call you all in general council and standing up in this bright sunlight, with every eye upon me, and declare in language that cannot be mistaken, words of wisdom and truth. I bring no message from the spirit land. I declare to you the needs and interests of the living. I have no visions of the night; no communications from the dis- contented spirits, who it is said are hovering around our camps, threatening disaster and death to the living, out of spite for having been rejected from the good hunting ground, to tell you of; but openly, in this bright day, I communicate to you, in deepest solicitude, the long cherished thoughts of a live man; which, when fully carried out, cannot fail to establish peace, harmony, concord and much gladness to this great live nation. I speak not to the dead; for they cannot hear my words. I speak not to please or benefit the dead; there is nought I ean do or say, that can by any possibility reach their condition. I epeak to the living for the advancement and well being of this great, vigorous, live multitude. Hear my words. “From new motions and indications made by the sacred pole, which I have never witnessed before, I was led to conclude that our forty-three years’ journey in an unknown country had come to its termination. And to avoid hindering and annoying the whole people with what I had on my mind to be considered, I called yesterday (pilashash) a council of the leaders of the iksas, and all the conjurers, for the purpose of examining and deciding on the most prudent course to pursue, in case it should be finally ascertained, that the leader’s pole had settled permanently. “They all came, and after hearing my propositions, they put on wise faces, talked a great deal of the unhappy spirits of our dead friends, of their wants and desires, and of the great dangers that would befall the people, if they failed to obey the unreasonable demands made by the spirits, through the lazy Isht ahullos, conjurers and dreamers, who, according to their own words, are the only men through which the spirits can make manifest to the nation their burthensome and hurtful desires. Finding that they had nothing to say, nor did they even surmise anything on the subject of the affairs and interests of the living, I dismissed them as ignorant of, and enemies to, the rights of the people, and, therefore, improper agents for the transaction of their business. They were dismissed on account of their secret, malicious designs on the people, and their inefficiency in the councils of the nation. I immediately sent out runners to convene the people in general council to-day. You are all here, except the secret mongers, and the leaders of the clans, whose mouths and tongues have been tied up by the Isht ahullo and yushpakammi. The nation is present to hear my words; in them there is no secret or hidden meaning. You will all hear them, and let everyone, who is a man, open his mouth this clear day, and openly and fearlessly pour out his full and undisguised feelings on the topics which will be presented. “From signs which I have just named, I conclude, and I find it the prevailing impression of this multitude of self-sustaining people, that our long journey of Swanton] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 17 privations and dangers in the pathless wilderness has ended. We are now in the land of tall trees and running waters, of fruit, game of many kinds and fish and fowl, which was spoken of by our good chief, who is missing, in the far off country towards the setting sun. His words have come to pass. Our journey is at an end, and we shall grow to be a nation of happy people in this fruitful land. ; “Let us now, like a sensible people, put the nation in a suitable condition for the free enjoyment of the inexahustible bounties that have been so lavishly spread in this vast country for the use and benefit of this multitude. Let us lay aside all useless encumbrance, that we may freely circulate, with our families in this widely extended land, with no burthen to pack, but such as are neces- sary to sustain life and comfort to our wives and little ones. Let us eall this piace; this, Nunih Waya encampment, our home; and it shall be so that when aman, at his hunting camp, in the distant forests, shall be asked for his home place, his answer will be, ‘Nunih Waya.’ And to establish Nunih Waya more especially as our permanent home, the place to which when we are far away, our thoughts may return with feelings of delight and respectful pleasure, I propose that we shall by general consent and mutual good feelings select an eligible location within the limits of the encampment and there, in the most respectful manner, bring together and pile up in beautiful and tasteful style the vast amount of bones we have packed so far and with which many of the people have been so grievously oppressed. Let each set of bones remain in its sack, and after the sacks are closely and neatly piled up, let them be thickly covered over with eypress bark. After this, to appease and satisfy the spirits of our deceased relatives, our blood kin, let all persons, old and young, great and small, manifest their respect for the dead, by their energy and in- dustry in carrying dirt to cover them up, and let the work of carrying and piling earth upon them be continued until every heart is satisfied. These bones, as we all know, are of the same iksa, the same kindred. They were all the same flesh and blood; and for us to pile their bones all in the same heap and se- curely cover them up will be more pleasing to the spirits, than it will be to let them remain amongst the people, to be scattered over the plains, when the sacks wear out in the hands of another generation who will know but little and care less about them. “You have heard my talk. I have delivered to you the true sentiments of my heart. When it comes to my time to depart for the spirit land, I shall be proud to know that my bones had been respectfully deposited in the great mound with those of my kindred. What says the nation?” Some little time elapsed; and there was no move among them. The multitude seemed to reflect. At length, a good looking man of about sixty winters, arose in a dignified manner, from his seat, and gravely said: “Tt was in my boyhood, and on the little river where we had the great fish feast, that my much respected father died. His family remained and mourned a whole moon, and when the ery-poles were pulled down, and the feast and dance had ended, my mother having a young child to carry, it fell to my lot, being the next largest member of the family, to pack on the long journey, the bones of my father. I have carefully carried them over hardships and diffi- culties, from that little rocky river to the present encampment. Such has been my love and respect for these sacred relics, that I was ready at any time to have sacrificed my life sooner than I would have left them, or given them up to another. I am now growing old; and with my declining years come new thoughts. Not long hence, I too must die. I ask myself, who in the coming generations will remember and respect the bones of my father? Will they 18 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [Buiy.103 not be forgotten and scattered to bleach and moulder on the carelessly trodden plain? I have sought with a heart full of anxious sorrow, for a decent and satisfactory resting place, in which to deposit the bones of my long lost father. I could think of none. And I dare assert, that there are thousands in hearing of my voice, at this very moment, whose faithful hearts have asked the same embarrassing questions. I am happy in the acknowledgment, and I trust with much confidence, that the whole people will view this important matter in the same satisfactory light. The wise propositions of our worthy chief have answered perplexing questions and have fully relieved the unsettled work- ings of many anxious hearts. “Tt is true, as our wise chief has already suggested, that we can now witness the wonderful and never before heard of sight of a live nation packing on their backs an entire dead nation, our dead outnumbering the living. It is a pleasure to me, now that my eyes have been opened by the chief’s proposition to the propriety of placing these relics of the dead nation to themselves, that we have power and time to do as he suggests, and most reverently to secure them from being tumbled among our greasy packs, and from the occasional dropping of the precious bones, through the holes in the worn out sacks to be lost forever. Let us, in accordance with the wise and reasonable proposition of our minko, fetch all the sacred relics to one place; pile them up in a comely heap; and construct a mound of earth upon them, that shall protect them from all harm forever.” And the people rose up and with one voice, said, “It is well; we are content.” The minko stood up again and said that in that great multitude there might be some whose feelings in regard to the disposition of the bones of their dead friends would not permit them to pile them with the dead nation. Then they all shouted aloud, “It is good, it is satisfactory.” Men were then appointed to select an appropriate place for the mound to be erected on, and to direct the work while in progress. They selected a level piece of sandy land, not far from the middle creek; laid it off in an oblong square and raised the foundation by piling up earth which they dug up some distance to the north of the foundation. It was raised and made level as high as a man’s head and beat down very hard. It was then floored with cypress bark before the work of placing the sacks of bones commenced. The people gladly brought forward and deposited their bones until there were none left. The bones, of themselves, had built up an immense mound. They brought the cypress bark, which was neatly placed on, till the bone sacks were all closely covered in, as dry as a tent. While the tool carriers were working with the bark, women and children and all the men, except the hunters, carried earth continually, until the bark was all covered from sight, constituting a mound half as high as the tallest forest tree. The minko kindled the council fire, and, calling an assembly of the people, told them that the work on the great monumental grave had been prosecuted with skill and wonderful industry. He said that the respect which they had already manifested for the deceased relatives was very great; that notwith- standing the bones were already deeply and securely covered up, the work was not yet completed. Yet it was sufficiently so to allow them to suspend opera- tions for a season. Winter was drawing near; the acorns and nuts were beginning to fall and were wasting. The people must now scatter into the forests and collect the rich autumnal fruits which were showering down from every tree. That done, the people must return to the encampment; and as the tool carriers had produced seed corn enough for all to have a little field. each family must prepare ground for that purpose. Then, after the corn was SwaNTOn J CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 19 grown and the new corn feast and dance celebrated and over, the nation could again prosecute the work on the mound, and so on, from year to year, until the top of the great grave of the dead nation should be as high as the tallest forest tree. And it should be made level on the top as much as sixty steps (habli) in length, and thirty steps in width, all beat down hard, and planted thick with acorns, nuts and pine seeds. “‘ Remember my words,” said the chief, “and finish the work accordingly. Now go and prepare for winter.” And the people gladly dispersed into the distant forests. Fruit was found in great quantities and was collected and brought into camp in very large amounts—acorns, hickory nuts, and most and best of all, the otupi (chest- nuts), all of which was secured from the worms by the process of drying them by smoke and incasing them in small quantities in airtight mud cells, in the same manner, that the mud daubers (lukchuk chanuskik)™ preserve their spiders. Their hunters were very successful; and at midwinter, when all the clans had returned to their camps, they found themselves rich in their sup- plies of so many things that were good for food, they concluded that as the best way of expressing their unfeigned gratitude (yokoke ahni) to the great sun they would celebrate a grand, glad feast, and joyous dance, before they commenced the work of clearing and breaking ground for their cornfields. So they cleaned out the dance ground, and planted the pole with the golden Sun in the center of it. The people collected and, with much joy and gladness of heart, feasted and danced five days. The amount of ground necessary to plant what corn they had was small, and was soon planted. Then having nothing else to be working at, a thought- ful old man, pointing to the great unfinished mound (yokni chishinto) said, “the weather is cool and pleasant, and the grave of your dead kindred is only half as high as a tall tree.” Taking the timely suggestion of the man, thousands went to work, carrying dirt to the great mound. Afterwards, it became an honorable thing to carry and deposit earth on the mound at any time they were not engaged at work in their domestic vocations. The winter over, spring with its green foliage and singing birds and its grand flourish of gobbling turkeys came slowly on. Corn was planted and the companies of hunters went forth. The camps were healthy. -Those who were planting soon finished it, and engaged actively forthwith in throwing earth upon the already huge mound. Their corn flourished well, producing enough, after preserving a portion of their fields for seed, to supply a full feast for the green corn dance. At the Nunih Waya encampment, everything went well and there were no complaints. Their hunters made wide excursions, acquainting themselves with the geography of the country to the extent of many days’ journey around. But, as yet, they had discovered no signs of the enemy, or of any other people. In this happy condition of health and plenty—for they had enlarged their fields and were harvesting abundant crops of corn—years rolled round; the work on the mound was regularly prosecuted; and at the eighth green corr dance celebrated at Nunih Waya, the committee who had been appointed at the commencement, reported to the assembled multitude that the work was completed and the mound planted with the seeds of the forest trees in accord- ance with the plan and direction of the minko, at the beginning of the work. The minko then instructed the good old Lopina, who had carried it so many years, to take the golden sun to the top of the great mound and plant it in the center of the level top. 16 Tukchuk chanushik. The dance as employed by men is probably wholly imaginary. 20 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BuLL. 103 When the people beheld the golden emblem of the sun glittering on the top of the great work which, by the united labor of their own hands, had just been accomplished, they were filled with joy and much gladness. And in their songs at the feast, which was then going on, they would sing: “ Behold the wonderful work of our hands; and let us be glad. Look upon the great mound; its top is above the trees, and its black shadow lies on the ground, a bowshot. It is surmounted by the golden emblem of the sun; its glitter (tohpakali) dazzles the eyes of the multitude. It inhumes the bones of fathers and relatives; they died on our sojourn in the wilderness. They died in a far off wild country; they rest at Nunih Waya. Our journey lasted many winters; it ends at Nunih Waya.” The feast and the dance, as was the custom, continued five days. After this, in place of the long feast, the minko directed that, as a mark of respect due to the fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, for whom they had with so much labor prepared such a beautiful and wonderfully high monumental grave, each iksa should come to the mound and, setting up an ornamental pole for each clan, hold a solemn ery a whole moon. Then, to appease the restless spirits of the deceased nation and satisfy all the men and women with what they had done with the sacred relics of their dead, the Choctaws held a grand and joyous national dance and feast of two days. And returning to their tents, they remembered their grief no more. All the people said that their great chief was full of wisdom; that his heart was with the people; and that his counsels had led them in the clean and white paths of safety and peace. Each of the iksas selected very tall pine poles, which they peeled and made white and ornamented with festoons of evergreens and flowers. Then in most solemn form, they performed the ery three times every day, during one whole moon. Then at the great national pole pulling, they celebrated a grand feast and dance of two days. The rejoicing of the na- tion was very great, and they returned to their camps with glad hearts, remem- bering their sorrows no more.’™ Afterward, when a death occurred, and the bones had been properly cleansed, they were deposited in a great cavity which had been constructed for that purpose, as the work of the mound was progressing. It was the national sepulchral vault; and thither the bones of all the people that died at Nunih Waya were carried and neatly stowed away in dressed leather sacks. Thus arose the custom of burying the dead in the great monumental sepulchre. And when a member of a hunting party of more than two men or a family died, too far out in the forest to pack home the bones, which could not be cleaned in the woods—for the bone pickers never went hunting—it was deemed sufficient to appease the wandering spirit to place all his hunting implements close to the dead body, just as death had left it. In such cases it was not lawful to touch the dead, and they were covered with a mound of earth thirty steps in cireum- ference and as high as a man’s head. If death occurred at the camp of an individual family in the far off hunt, the survivors would, during the cry moon, carry, in cane baskets and [on] the blade bones of the buffalo, a sufficient amount of earth to construct a mound of the above dimensions. If there should be but two men at a camp, or a lone man and his wife, and one should die, the survivor had to carry the dead body home. Life for life, was the law; and every life had to be accounted for in a Satisfactory manner. It would not answer for a man to return home and report that his hunting companion or his wife had been lost or drowned, devoured by wild beasts or died a natural death. ee a Eee 16a Ag will be seen later, the pole-pulling ceremony was of later date than the custom of burying in mounds. SwANTON ] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 21 He must show the body. There are occasionally found among the great number of tumuli scattered over the land, mounds of larger dimensions than ordinary ones. These mounds were constructed by females. Upon the death in camp of a man who had an affectionate wife, his mourning tekchi (wife), regardless of the customary time to cry, would throw down her hair and with all her strength and that of her children would carry earth, and build upon the mound as long as they could find food of any kind that would sustain life. They would then return to camp, worn out skeletons. Now, my white friend, I have explained to you the origin, and who it was that built the great number of mounds that are found scattered over this wide land. The circular, conic mounds are all graves, and mark the spot where the persons, for whom they were built, breathed their last breath. There being no bone pickers at the hunting camps to handle the dead, the body was never touched, or moved from the death posture. Just as it lay, or sat, as the case might be, it was covered up, first with either stones, pebbles, or sand, and finished off with earth. In this way the custom of mound graves originated from the great mound grave, Nunih Waya, and it prevailed with the Choctaw people until the white man came with his destructive, sense-killing ‘“ fire water,” and made the people all drunk. After getting in possession of this information, in regard to the origin and make of the mounds, I took pains to excavate quite a number of them, which were found on the “second flat” along the Tombecbee river. They contained invariably a single human skeleton. The bones generally, except the skull, were decomposed. The crania of most of them weuld bear handling, when first taken out, but when exposed to the air they soon fell to ashes. Along with the ashes of the bones, in most cases, would be found five or six arrow points, a stone ax, and not infrequently a stone skin-dresser. In all cases, the bones would be found enveloped, sometimes lying on the side, feet drawn up; at other times in a sitting posture, either in sand, pebbles, or small stones. In one or two cases, the coals and the charred ends of the pine knots that lighted up. the last sad night of the deceased, lay in front and near the bones, under the sand. As soon as the national cry was over, the poles pulled down, and the great dance celebrated, the families dispersed into the far off hunting grounds where they enjoyed the game and fruits, until midwinter; when they returned to their homes to prepare and put their fields in order for the coming planting time. The seasons at Nunih Waya were good every year; and they had on hand corn in abundance. Their mode of putting it away, in small lots, in air tight earthen cells, preserved it, from year to year, for an indefinite period, as sound and fresh as new corn. To keep it dry and entirely excluded from the air, was all that was necessary, to preserve it for any length of time in the same condition in which it was when put up. Feeling themselves permanently settled after the mound was completed, they planted larger crops and were beginning to construct good, dry houses in which to dwell. The next year after the mound was finished, haying a very large crop of corn, they celebrated the green corn dance, eating nothing besides the corn. On the first day of the feast, and at the time the people had assembled to receive instructions in regard to the manner of conducting the ceremonies, the minko came upon the dance ground, and calling the attention of the multitude said: “We are a brave and exceedingly prosperous people. We are an industrious people. We till the ground in large fields, thereby producing sustenance for this great nation. We are a faithful and dutiful people. We packed the bones of our ancestors on our backs, in the wilderness, forty-three winters, and at the 22 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BuLu. 103 end of our long journey piled up to their memory a monument that over- shadows the land like a great mountain. We are a strong, hardy, and very shifty [!] people. When we set out from the land of our fathers, the Chata tribe numbered a little less than nineteen thousand. We have traveled over a pathless wilderness, beset with rocks, high mountains, sun-scorched plains, with dried up rivers of bitter waters; timbered land, full of lakes and ferocious wild beasts. Bravely we have battled and triumphed over all. We have not failed, but are safely located in the rich and fruitful land of tall trees and running brooks seen in a vision of the night, and described by our good chief who is missing. And we number now a little more than twenty-one thousand. As- suredly we are a wonderful people. A people of great power. A united, friendly people. We are irresistibly strong (hlampko).” Then turning and pointing with his hand, he said: “Behold the sacred pole, the gift of the Great Spirit. To it we are to attribute all our success. When the enemy pursued on our track, its truthful indications gave us timely notice to escape from danger. When we wavered in the trackless desert it leaned and led us onward in the paths of safety. When we reached the swift, wide river, it bowed its ominous head; we crossed to Nunih Waya. Here it danced and made many motions, but did not in- dicate for us to go farther. As a leading light to our feet and as a great power, it has conducted us from the far distant West (hush ai akatula) to the rising sun; to the land of safety and plenty. It is a sacred relic of our pilgrimage in the unknown regions. As such we must preserve it for the coming generations to see and remember the potent leader of their fathers in the wilderness. It is proposed by the wise Isht ahullo, who has faithfully carried the sacred pole ever since the virtuous and ingenious Peni ikbi™ died, that a circular mound, forty steps in circumference at the base, as high as onee and a half the length of the sacred pole, be erected eastward from the great monument, on the high ground towards the middle creek; and that inasmuch as your good, lazy Isht ahullos, yushpakammi, dreamers, spirit talkers and medicine men, did not find it convenient to assist you in the con- struction of the great monument for the dead nation, let them be required to construct with their own hands, this mound for the leader’s pole to rest on. They pretend to be always dealing with spirits and sacred things, and no other men should be allowed to work on the mound, that is to constitute a resting place for the sacred pole. The work must be performed and finished by the sacred conjurers, in accordance with the plan and directions of the wise Isht ahullo, who carries the leader’s pole, and who is this day appointed to superintend the work.” The pole-bearing Isht ahullo marked off the ground, and placing the sacred pole in the center of it, summoned the whole of the conjurers and sorcerers to commence the work. They came, but they were so extremely awkward and lazy that the work progressed quite slowly. The Isht ahullo, who was superintendent of the work, exerted his whole power to encourage them to facilitate the building of the mound. It was all to no effect. They grumbled from morning till night and moved so slowly at their work, that a child could have done as much work as they accomplished in a day. The superintendent shortened their daily supply of food. They did less work and grumbled more. He made their daily food still less. They, with but few exceptions, ran off into the woods, and scattering themselves among the camps of the hunters, sponged upon them until the hunters, becoming tired of them, drove them 17“ Canoe Maker.” SwaNTon] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 23 from their camps like dogs. They returned to Nunih Waya, but did not resume their work. The superintendent of the work complained to the chief. The chief called the tool carriers and instructed them to go out, and select a piece of land, that would not interfere with the claims of the iksas. “ Lay out a plot of land, twenty steps square for each one of the yushpakammi, who is not found engaged at work on the mound; and set the idle conjurers to work on it, preparing the ground to plant corn. We are settled permanently now, and every member of the nation, who is healthy, must perform sufficient labor to produce, at least, as much food and raiment as he consumes. This people shall not labor and sweat to support a lazy, heartless set of men, whose only duty is falsehood, and whose influence disturbs the quiet of the nation.” The tool carriers laid off the little plats of land, but the conjurers paid no attention to the order for them to work it. The chief then appointed a day for the people to meet in council for the purpose of taking into consideration the bad character of these lazy men and the demoralizing influence they exerted in the nation. The whole number of the conjurers were also summoned to attend the council and defend their right to enjoy all the privileges of the camps, with entire exemption from labor or any visible calling. On the day appointed for the council, all the people who were out hunting came. But of the spirit talkers and conjurers, there were not exceeding thirty in the assembly, and they were all known to be industrious men. Mes- sengers were sent to warn them to the council. They were not to be found in the camps; and it was discovered that a great number of women were missing. The assembly immediately broke up and parties were sent out to capture and bring home the women at least. After several days diligent search, the parties all returned and reported that the conjurers must have gone off on the wind; for they could discover no trace nor sign of them in any direction. Nor did they ever know certainly what went with them. At the time this thing occurred there were so many people absent from the encampment that they were unable to make an estimate of the number that were missing but from the number of children left without mothers in the camp, it was known to be very considerable. As far as could be ascertained, they were the wives of men, without exception, who were out hunting. It was distressing to see the great number of small children who were running to and fro in the camps, and to hear their incessant lament. “Sa ishka muto” (Where is my mother) was heard in all directions. They were mostly small children, and generally of young mothers who had abandoned both them and their absent husbands and run off with the lazy conjuring priests and medicine men. At midwinter, when the hunting parties had all returned, an effort was made to ascertain the number of women who had left their families to follow the conjurers and priests. From the best computation they could make, the number was nearly 200, and it so much excited the bereaved husbands and the people generally against the Isht ahullo and conjurers of every grade, that it was with much difficulty the minko found himself able to dissuade them from fall- ing upon the few that were left, and who were faithfully at work on the mound. In their rage [they cried] that the whole mass of lazy Isht ahullo, conjurers, Spirit talkers, and medicine men were all alike—enemies to the men that fed them, and seducers and prostituters of the women who clothed them. They de- clared that there was no good in them, and that they ought not to live. This manifestation of the low, gross nature of the priests and conjurers depreciated 24 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [Buxu. 1038 their standing with the whole people. It sank them to a degree of infamy and suspicion from which they have never recovered. To this day they are pushed aside in decent company and looked upon with scorn and contempt. The Isht Ahullo, who was so long the bearer of the sacred pole, had always deported himself as a good, industrious man; and it was from his management that the investigation of their conduct, and the flights of the conjuring priests had been brought about. After a time with the small band of Isht ahullos that had been left he completed the mound in good style and, planting the sacred pole permanently on its top, he desired the chief to call the nation to its examination, and if the work met with the approbation of the people, he wished them to receive it and discharge him and his workmen from further duties in regard to the sacred pole. When the peopie came, they gave their approbation of the comely propor- tions of the mound by a long continued shout. And by another uproarious shout congratulated themselves on the certainty that their long journey in the wilder- néss had most assuredly ended. At this, the sacred pole began jumping up and punching itself deeper and deeper into the ground, until it went down slowly out of sight into the mound. At witnessing the wonderful manifestation of the settling pole, there were no bounds to their rejoicings, and they danced and brought provisions, making a glad celebration that continued three days and nights on the occasion of the departing sacred pole. Having sufficient ground cleared to produce as much bread as they needed, and a large surplus, the people had time to construct houses to dwell in and to keep their surplus provisions dry and safe. They constructed their houses of earth at Nunih Waya, and that fashion prevailed until the white people came to live in the nation with them. The larger game was becoming scarcer and the hunters were extending their excursions wider. The people, however, were producing such abundant supplies of corn that they did not require a very great amount of meat and the hunters were extending their explorations more for the purpose of becoming acquainted with a wider range of country and for their own satisfaction than from neces- sity. Time rolled on, the people were healthy, and had increased at a very great ratio. They had extended their settlements up the Nunih Waya creek, and out in the country between Nunih Waya and Tuli Hikia creeks, to half a day’s journey; and they were growing corn over the entire district. About thirty winters after they had stopped at Nunih Waya, a party of hunters who had progressed a little farther north than usual, fell in with a camp of hunters belonging to the Chickasha tribe. After finding that they spoke the same language with themselves, the Chahtas approached their camp in a friendly manner, and remained several days. The older men amongst them being familiar with the traditional history of the journeyings of their respec- tive tribes, took much pleasure in communicating to each other an account of their travels. From the point where the two tribes separated, the Chickashas diverged widely to the left, found an extremely rough and scarce country for some time, but at length emerging from the mountains on to the wide spread plains, they found the buffalo and other game plentiful. They continued to travel, with only an occasional halt, to rest the women and feeble ones, until they came to the great river, at the place called by them, sakti ahlopulli (bluff erossing)—white people call it now Chickasaw Bluffs, said the old man. They made shift to cross the great river, and traveling onward, the leader’s pole came to a stand at a place now called Chickasha Old Town in a high and beau- tiful country. The leader’s pole stood at this place three winters, at the end of which time the pole was found leaning to the northeast. They set out again, and crossed another big river (at little prairie, near Huntsville, Alabama). The SWANTON] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 25 pole remained there erect only one winter. At mulberry time the ensuing summer the pole was found leaning almost directly to the south. They packed up, and crossing many bold running rivers, the pole still leading onward, until they came to a large river, near where it emptied into the great okhuta (ocean). At this beautiful country (below where Savannah, Georgia, now stands) the pole stood erect many winters. The fish, opa haksum [opahaksun], oka folush (oysters, clams) and all manner of shell fish and fowl, and small game were plentiful. The people obtained full supplies of provisions with but little labor. In process of time, however, the people became sickly, and they were visited with a very great plague. They called the plague hoita lusa (black vomit) be- cause the people died, vomiting black matter, resembling powdered fire coals and fish slime. All that took it were sick but a day or two and died so fast that the people became frightened and ran off, leaving great numbers of the dead unburied. They followed the leader’s pole back nearly over the same route they went, until finally they returned to the place where the pole made its first stand (Chickasha Old Towns). Here it stood again, and remained erect until it rotted. After the Chahtas had found where their brother Chickashas had located, they paid occasional visits to their country. But the Chickashas, becoming suspicious that the Chahtas were seeking some advantage, gave them orders not to extend their hunts north of a certain little river. The Chahtas paid no attention to the proclamation sent by the Chickashas, and it turned out that the Chickashas attacked and killed three or four of their hunters who had camped north of the interdicted river. When the news reached Nunih Waya, the people were grieved; for they had felt proud of finding their Chickasha brethren and were preparing to cultivate their friendship. The minko, thinking it possible that there might be some mistake in the matter, sent an embassy to the chief of the Chickasha nation, to ascertain the cause of the murderous conduct of his hunters. The Chickasha ehief ordered the Chahta embassy to be scourged and sent back with no other answer. The Chahtas were very much enraged. They had received an indig- nity that they could not account for; and they felt mortified in the extreme. The Chahta chief did not feel willing to go to war with them, and made up his mind to give orders to his hunters to abstain from hunting beyond the river named by the Chickashas. But before he had time to carry his peace plans into action, all the hunters north of Nunih Waya had been attacked at their camps on the hunting grounds. Great numbers of the men had been killed, and their women carried off captive. Those hunters who had escaped from the attacked camps reported that the Chickashas were very numerous, and that their warriors were very large and overpowering in battle. The present generation of the Chahta people had never seen any people but their own tribe; and the news of the captured women, murdered hunters and the vast hordes of rushing irresistible warriors that were pouring down into their hunting grounds from the Chickasha country, had frightened the Chahta people into a fearful panic. Some of them had already proposed to evacuate their comfortable homes at Nunih Waya and seek some safer country for their wives and little ones to dwell in. But they did not ponder the matter long. The spies coming in, reported that great numbers of the Chickashas had their camps, and were killing up the game in two days’ travel of Nunih Waya. The Chahta minko kindled the council fire; and calling a national council, submitted for their consideration the whole matter of the Chikasha depreda- tions; and called upon them to investigate the subject and decide on the proper course to pursue in the case. The people promptly assembled and were con- 54564—31——3 26 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BuLL. 103 fessedly very much alarmed. Some of the young warriors moved that the Chahta people should rise at once and kill every Chickasha they could find within the limits of their hunting grounds. Others who were not quite so fiery thought that a precipitate move on the part of the Chahtas would only bring disaster, while there were others who advocated immediate flight as the only chance for safety. At length, old Long Arrow, who had always been leader of the tool carriers, arose and said: ‘ “JT am old now, and cannot, if I desired, make much of a flight. I shall remain at Nunih Waya. My bones shall sleep in the great mound. JI am also opposed to precipitate movements. Let us prepare plenty of arms and make systematic movements. Let us organize one hundred companies, with ten active men in each, and a prudent, brave warrior to lead each company. Let these hundred companies be sent forward immediately, with instructions to examine and ascertain the force and position of the enemy; but not to make battle, except when they are attacked. Let them stay a long time, and be seen in many places, as by accident, in the day time; but at night, let them scatter and sleep without fire in dark places. In the meantime, let all those who remain in the encampment go to work and throw up a high circular earth wall that shall include the two mounds and space enough to contain all the women and children, as well as the aged and infirm, in case of a siege. All this completed and all the corn and other provisions that can be had stored away inside of the great wall, we shall be ready to increase our forces; hunt down the enemy and scalp them wherever they may be found.” The multitude breathed easier and looked brighter. The minko then spoke to the people, giving them great encouragement. He said: “The great war talk of the long tried friend of the people, Long Arrow, is full of wisdom, and his words brace the flagging spirits of the nation. His counsels lead to safety, and his instructions and plans to victory. Let the people not hesitate. Turn out your hundred companies of warriors. Send them out immediately. Appoint wise men to lay off and direct the work on the earth wall and let all that can carry a load of dirt as large as his head be found busily engaged from day to day, until the wall is completed. Be industrious. Let every one do his duty in this great work. Let all people be brave and faithful and danger cannot approach you.” And the people answered and said: “Tt is a good talk. Lay off the ground; we are ready for the work; it shall rise up as a cloud in a summer’s day.” The companies were organized the same day and took their departure the next day. Men were appointed to lay off and superintend the work on the earthen wall. The people, old and young, stringing themselves around the entire circle, threw up the earth from the outside of the wall to the height of two men, in eight days. And they left two gaps in the wall, of five steps each. One at the east and the other at the west, for the ingress and egress of the people which they did not intend to close until Nunih Waya should be actually - invaded by the enemy. | The minko then organized his whole effective force and ordered them to make arrows and war clubs as fast as possible and bring them into the mound of the sacred pole, where he had a house erected, in which to deposit them.” The above is, of course, cut out of the middle of a very much longer narrative, although the volume in which it is contained seems to give 138 Lincecum in Pubs. Miss. Hist. Soc., vil, pp. 521-542. SWANTON ] CHOCTAW SOCIAL AND CEREMONIAL LIFE 27 us no explanation of the reason for its incomplete state. The core of the narrative is plainly a genuine Choctaw origin myth; the ques- tion is how much of the elaboration is native and how much due to Lincecum himself. That there has been a certain amount contrib- uted by both goes without saying, and later influences are discernible here and there, as when “iron” tools are mentioned. At the same time I am inclined to regard it as a fairly elaborate origin myth in which, as in so many of the kind, the initiation of the customs and ceremonies of the tribe is incorporated Thus the explanation of one of the Nanih Waiya mounds is bound up with the explanation of the origin of Choctaw burial customs, the beginning of the “ green corn ” dance appears to be introduced, and the origin of the almost con- tinuous wars of later times between the Choctaw and Chickasaw, as well as the first use of a stockade. The legend is no doubt absolutely correct in describing the earthen rampart at Nanih Waiya as a defence against Chickasaw incursions, however much it may exag- gerate the importance attached to this particular fortification. In his attempts to account for the origin of the two mounds within the enclosure the narrator is not so fortunate. According to him, the larger mound is a burial mound, and the smaller a mound prepared for the sacred pole, while as a matter of fact the small mound was the burial mound, there being no indication that the principal struc- ture was used for that purpose. As I have stated already, it was probably intended as a foundation for the public buildings of the town, which were, it is true, devoted in part to religious purposes. The two gaps are evidently the places where the two “ highways ” described by Halbert entered, and no doubt they were the old gate- ways of the fort. The accounts given by Cushman have been touched up even more by the imagination of the recorder. He says: Their tradition, in regard to their origin as related by the aged Choctaws to the missionaries in 1820, was in substance as follows: In a remote period of the past their ancestors dwelt in a country far distant toward the setting sun; and being conquered and greatly oppressed by a more powerful people resolved to seek a country far removed from the possibility of their oppression. A great national council was called, to which the entire nation in one vast concourse quickly responded. After many days spent in grave deliberations upon the question in which so much was involved, a day was finally agreed upon and a place of rendezvous duly appointed whence they should bid a final adieu to their old homes and country and take up their line of march to seek others, they knew not where. When the appointed day arrived it found them at the designated place fully prepared and ready for the exodus under the chosen leadership of two brothers, Chahtah and Chikasah, both equally re- nowned for their bravery and skill in war and their wisdom and prudence in council; who, as Moses and Aaron led the Jews in their exodus from Egypt, were to lead them from a land of oppression to one of peace, prosperity and 28 BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY (Buby. 103 happiness. The evening before their departure a “Fabussa” (pole) was firmly set up in the ground at the centre point of their encampment, by direc- tion of their chief medicine man and prophet, whose wisdom in matters per- taining to things supernatural was unquestioned and to whom, after many days fasting and supplication, the Great Spirit had revealed that the Fabussa would indicate on the following morning, the direction they should march by its leaning; and, . . . would indicate the direction they must travel day by day until they reached the "
