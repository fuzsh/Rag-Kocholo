Text: Yowani / Named in honor of a small group of Choctaw Indians who, at one time, lived southeast of here. Little is known of their history. No great battles were fought which would leave the Yowani name to posterity. No great men came from their group. No outstanding events, in which they had a part, seem to have taken place. In short, we here honor these Indians so that they will not have gone "unhonour'd and unsung". / Their name is corrupted from Hiowanne, the Choctaw name for cutworm or caterpillar. / United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service
