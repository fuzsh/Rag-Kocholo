        "text": "April 30, 2022\n\nThis memoir by actress Claire Bloom whose semi-glittering career stretches from 1951 to now (first major role : Charlie Chaplin’s Limelight) divides into two parts, pre-Roth and post-Roth.\n\nPre-Roth is eyebrow raising. This part is a decorously-phrased shag-and-tell session : first up was Richard Burton who was married, of course – they were secretly together for 5 years – she calls him “my first and greatest love” but he wouldn’t have said the same. Second guy was Laurence Olivier, who she just didn’t like (“we were both just using each other”). Third one was Yul Brynner who dumped her for Kim Novak. Could she possibly carry on shagging only top movie and stage stars? Sure she could – next one was Rod Steiger, this time she married him.\n\nBut alas, he was a depressive method actor :\n\nWhen Rod was performing Benito Mussolini or Al Capone at a film studio, he seemed to think it necessary to play Mussolini and Capone at home.\n\nI can see that just might become tiresome.\n\nAfter a second marriage and a one night stand with Anthony Quinn, she met Philip Roth (they were in their 40s). This was the part I was interested in, and it was worth waiting for.\n\nThere were some years of happy harmonious famous actress and famous author luvviness, one book and play and film after another. But then the red mist came down over the Roth brain. It started to go wrong when he published Operation Shylock which he thought was his masterpiece. And so do I! It’s brilliant! But the reviews came in, especially a viperish bosom-biting by John Updike, and it kind of deflated and was overlooked and Roth was devastated. After that, no more Mr Nice Guy. Actually there hadn’t been much of Mr Nice Guy before then, but now it became nasty.\n\nI never read such a harrowing account of mental torture. She was a feeble doormat with a needy daughter and an old mother, and he didn’t take kindly to any of that. In fact on various occasions he would out of the blue at breakfast present her an envelope containing a typed letter which would state categorically that her daughter was only allowed to stay with them for a maximum of three weeks per year, otherwise he would divorce her. That kind of thing. He was a freaky frightening freak. Clever and charming too, that always makes it worse. He would be all nice and loveydovey one day and ice cold, menacing and hateful the next day, the domestic version of Jeckyll and Hyde. I bet a lot of non-famous women have experienced exactly the same kind of behaviour.\n\nThere’s a great book called Roth Unbound by Claudia Pierpont, essential for all Roth readers. In that book she interviews the Roth himself and assesses all his voluminous fiction through the prism of his life, which is fair play because he was constantly writing versions of his life into his books. (Roth’s own version of his marriage with CB is in I Married a Communist which I have not yet read.) Referring back to the Claire Bloom saga in Roth Unbound I was quite shocked that whilst Claudia Pierpont refers several times to Leaving a Doll’s House she almost airbrushes all the really bad stuff out of the story. (I need to take a look at the big notorious biography by Blake Bailey and see how this poisonous material is handled there.)\n\nDifferent voices telling the same story, books cross-examining each other, gossip, trashtalking, hearsay, scandal…\n\nSeptember 30, 2015\n\nAh, but it's delicious! Juicy literary gossip, why not?\n\nI chanced upon this book and read it mostly for the insight into Philip Roth. The first half of the book is about many other relationships, but it's worth getting through it for the second half, the seventeen year relationship with Roth. It was absolutely fascinating. Bloom gives us everything an ex wife would, and then much more: the deep, the fine, the humor, the ugly, the disturbed, the person of such a great mind as is Roth.\n\nConsidering the book was written by an actress, we really get a good story with some serious character development of both: Roth and Bloom. And Even though Roth was a monster, I found myself oddly sympathizing with him, his erratic behavior, his tortured being, even as what he did to Bloom (asking for a billion dollars for every year of her life?) was insane and cruel and selfish and so ludicrous, I laughed. And I wished more than anything that she would stop being the rug he wiped his feet on, that she'd slam the hell of the phone down and never speak to him again.\n\nWhets the appetite for learning more about Roth.\n\nOctober 18, 2008\n\nI don’t read autobiographies as a rule so I don't have much grounds for comparison.\n\nBloom sometimes sums up characters very well, as she does with Olivier (a boring man when not speaking other people’s lines) and Anthony Quinn, a revolting individual in every way. Her daughter, Anna Steiger, is a singer. Her mother makes much of the prizes she won. I had never heard of her before but that’s not surprising since she seems to sing opera most of the time.\n\nShe did not behave so well in her life. After forming extremely critical views of Quinn she slept with him – a man she couldn’t stand! How sad is that? And she certainly treated her daughter very badly, allowing her husband, Philip Roth, to dictate if and when she could see her. The author is aware of these short-comings but that doesn’t make them alright. On the other hand, there’s no point writing an autobiography if you aren’t prepared to come clean, and you have to admire her for being so honest.\n\nThis book is most interesting when dealing with her marriage to Philip Roth. She is clearly an intelligent person with a knack for making bad decisions in her personal life. After a string of affairs with married men, usually fellow actors she was playing with – or playing under – she married Rod Steiger, then an unsavoury guy called Elkins. But marrying Roth was an act of extreme stupidity – there was a great deal of evidence from his own hand as to what he was really like. It is a good account of being married to a manipulative psycho and details her own ludicrous passivity in the face of endless provocation. There is a fair bit of psycho-analysis in this section of the book, somewhat more analytical than anything which precedes it. My guess is she got some of this from her own analyst. Some of the generalities I don’t like. Women lacking a father seek out a father-figure in a lover. They do? All of them? It’s a bit deterministic and mechanical for my taste. No doubt there are cases, no doubt there are exceptions.\n\nRead\n\nNovember 3, 2020\n\nA fascinating memoir of actor Claire Bloom's career and relationships.\n\nOctober 9, 2013\n\nIf you're interested in either life in the theater and films or the writing life, this will be of some interest. More specifically, if you want the dirt on Olivier, Burton, Anthony Quinn and others in bed and out of it or the fly on the rotting wall view of Philip Roth, this is for you. Bloom tries to be honest and revealing, but there is an undercurrent of self-acceptance in her apologies for sleeping with men she either didn't like much (Olivier) or actively disliked (Quinn) and\n\nselling out both herself and her daughter for any man in her life.She also is clearly as dedicated to her career as Roth and those around her pay the price. Having said that, her portrait of Roth--the main reason for interest in this book--is convincing. Jaundiced-- as any portrait of a hurtful, betraying ex would be-- it nevertheless captures the detachment, need, narcissism, cruelty, humor, brilliance and lack of emotional resonance evident in his books.The truth is, it doesn't matter much that Roth is clearly a troubled and twisted person: what matters are his books. Since there was always something about them that I disliked (the obsession with self and sex as all) I was very interested to read this. Also, his projection onto her of all his own misdeeds, and his quite impressive psychological torture toward her emanating from his own obvious sense of wrongness and guilt were fascinating to me as a woman who had a similar experience. What you are really left with is a portrait of how a woman can annihilate herself emotionally while appearing to be successful and strong, which is both a revelation and a warning.\n\nSeptember 18, 2016\n\nIn her earlier book, LIMELIGHT AND BEYOND, Claire Bloom concentrates on her life as a performer and tells many stories about how she approached her roles. She also mentioned that there had been some unpleasantness in her career, but she refrains from going into details.\n\nWith this memoir, she goes into the details and I found it fascinating. One of the \"draws\" for an effective memoir is the \"There but for the Grace of God go I\" aspect, and this one has that in abundance. Essentially, we learn about a sensitive and talented actress who has a crippling fear of being deserted. As a consequence, she stays in a variety of unhealthy relationships. While her performances may invite envy from other performers, her personal life is a harrowing trip of self-doubt on an emotional rollercoaster.\n\n\"Across my path there had passed good, affectionate men whose overtures I had ignored; they were not exciting enough, I said to myself. ... I chose instead difficult, if talented, men who could never bring me contentment. I seemed to need to meet a challenge, to re-create the lack of certainty of my early childhood.\"\n\nThose talented men included Richard Burton, Rod Steiger, Hillard Elkins and Philip Roth. Her stories about life with them are never explicit or bashing. Indeed, she makes brief mention that her marriage to Elkins opened her up to become more of a sexual adventurer. The reader expecting more details will be disappointed. However, her writing style incorporates a beautiful use of language and is always engaging. This is an actress with writing talent.\n\nMuch of the last third of the book revolves around her relationship with Philip Roth, a man who was fighting his own demons and who used manipulation as a cruel tool. The writer doesn't excuse her contributions to the failure, but it is difficult not to scream at the book, \"Just leave him!\" Or as her friend, Gore Vidal, warned her when she asked if she should begin a relationship with Roth, \"No. You have already had Portnoy's complaint. Do not involve yourself with Portnoy.\"\n\nAlthough the focus of this memoir is on her relationships, there were some omissions about her experiences with some famous productions that I wish she had included. For instance, there is no mention of her roles in CHARLY, THE ILLUSTRATED MAN, or THE HAUNTING. However, she does talk about her experiences working on DAYLIGHT, the Sylvester Stallone action thriller!\n\nAs I write this review, Claire Bloom is now 85-years old. I think it unlikely that we will hear more from her. What she has written is very worthwhile, though, and has my recommendation.\n\nNovember 27, 2012\n\nI've always thought that Claire Blooms is lovely and elegant and an excellent actress. She can't write, but that's not the problem, for me, with her memoir. I commend her for what appear to be attempts at honesty, but I was stunned to learn about her unadmirable qualities. Her blindly sophomoric adulation of a series of men, a virtual parade, is sad but also often stupid. Sleeping with the married Richard Burton when she was a very young woman, sleeping with Anthony Quinn, whom she seemed to despise in the work environment, getting involved with several others that were equally wrong for her. What is wrong with this woman? Her failed marriage to Rod Steiger did yield motherhood, and she keeps emphasizing that her only daughter, Anna, is the most precious person to her. More's the pity, then, that she so often hurt Anna. The coup de grace, of course, is the 17-year relationship, a couple of years of which were marriage, with Philip Roth. I love the artistry of Philip Roth. If 1/10 of what Bloom reports about her time with him is true, he is basically impossible to live with and a person of myriad problems. But this memoir is Bloom's. My biggest problem is trying to understand how Bloom, a supposedly intelligent and certainly a talented woman, could demean herself so slobberingly to the dictates of Roth - ESPECIALLY to the detriment of her own daughter. I think Bloom should be very, very grateful that Anna did not break with her completely given the way mother treated daughter at Roth's behest. How disappointing to see that Bloom could behave like a love-sick fool, be so lacking in self respect, and be so hurtful and awful as a mother. Bloom claims to have grown and learned. I hope so, but the taste in my mouth is sour.\n\nSeptember 11, 2021\n\nShort, but a good read. No second author listed, so I think she pretty much wrote it herself, and she is a fine writer. But it was odd to have the memoir of a mostly British life written or edited for American readers, so you find weird things like: \"Bristol, an important city in western England.\" (Thanks, I'd heard of it!) Perhaps she's still trying to imply that Americans are provincial and ignorant of foreign lands (she's not wrong).\n\nMostly I'm reviewing this book so I can provide my list of her lovers in decreasing order by the extent to which they deserved to be lovers of such a remarkable, intelligent, and talented woman (though she sounds pretty high-maintenance):\n\n1. Richard Burton—the love of her life and, arguably, she was the true love of his; Liz was more a trophy for him and an obsession, but he and Bloom seem made for each other, and given the circumstances and the polyamorous culture of the theater world, he treated her damn well.\n\n2. Rod Steiger—this was the one normal, stable relationship in her life. Rod was devoted to her and gave her a a daughter (Anna Steiger, now an opera singer) etc. He deserved better from Bloom, but she dumped him for no. 5.\n\n3. Laurence Olivier—their affair lasted pretty much the duration of their work together on Richard III, playing king and queen. Very symmetrical. He knew that she was really in love with Burton, and Claire knew that he was devoted to Vivian Leigh—also very symmetrical. Leigh knew about the affair, too, and the two women became friends without ever mentioning it. All very symmetrical and very British. Coincidentally, a quarter-century later Olivier and Bloom played the estranged Marquis and Marchioness of Marchmain in \"Brideshead Revisited,\" but the characters were divorced and estranged so they never shared a scene and were never at Castle Howard at the same time during shooting, though no. 6 visited her there and warned her (he and Bloom both being Jewish) not to do things like finger the curtains and ask how much per yard and added, \"No Yiddish before breakfast.\" He felt insecure and out of place there; she didn't. But I digress; see below for more on no. 6.\n\n4. Anthony Quinn—Bloom depicts him as an egotistical piece of shit who had a professional grudge against her from the start and gave her one grudge-fuck just out of spite (she refers to it as a seduction and regrets it). He TOTALLY didn't deserve to score with her.\n\n5. Hillard Elkins—while reading this part of the biography, knowing I would write this list, I was convinced that he would be bottom of the list because I couldn't imagine that no. 6 could be any worse, but I was wrong (see below). And I won't kink-shame Elkins or anything, but he was a buffoon and a liar, a parody of the 1970s Hollywood swinger. Really, really tacky, and these are mostly the grounds on which I would call him undeserving. He was no fun to be married to, and the daughter despised him, too, though not nearly as much as she despised ...\n\n6. Philip Roth—holy crap. I was kind of bracing myself to learn that he was self-absorbed, philandering, uncouth—like Larry David's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" character, but with a cerebellum and a libido—but I was not prepared for just how evil and venal and money-grubbing and psychopathic and misogynistic Roth was. Their marriage was just a really long con that he played on her, starting with a prenuptial agreement that stripped her of any rights, ending with massive lawsuits reaching, comically, into the billions of dollars, and in between there was the publication of \"Deception,\" a book which essentially vilifies Bloom and holds her up to public mockery and taunts her with bragging about cheating on her, which she was not willing to see for what it was until the long drawn out divorce that WAS because he had been cheating on her with the woman that became his companion right after (Inga Larsen, whom Bloom pseudonymizes, but without much rancor, as \"Erda\"). The Roth-Bloom marriage also coincided with his nervous breakdown, though that doesn't excuse anything about his behavior. Ironically, one of the points of disagreement between the two, which is exaggerated for dramatic effect in \"Deception,\" was the extent of anti-Semitism in Britain vs. America. Roth felt Bloom turned a blind eye to British anti-Semitism; she thought American anti-Semitism was just as bad. I'll leave it to psychoanalysts to explore the extent to which this reflects or feeds into Roth's bombarding her with vicious legal actions in the wake of their divorce, which left her destitute. Everything about Roth's sick, twisted psyche has to do with sex, anti-Semitism, Jewish identity, paranoia, self-doubt, self-hatred, money, ego, and lust all in one nasty little tangle. No prize for noticing this; every single one of his books is about this. Roth was a genius, make no mistake, but in his personal life he was a monster. \"Operation Shylock,\" which is maybe his most brilliant book, was the product of the psychotic ordeal described by Bloom. One bright spot here is that Roth was infuriated by Bloom's book and spent the last years of his life commissioning a hagiographical biography of himself that would set the record straight, and then all in one fell swoop a few months ago the biography itself was discredited by the revelation that its author is himself a child sex predator who bonded with Roth on their shared misogyny. So now forever after Roth's attempt to write his own life will be dismissed as a whitewash and it will be known that Bloom had his number all along. Another bright spot: Roth thought that \"Shylock\" would be the capper to his career, his magnum opus that would establish his reputation, his \"Grapes of Wrath\" or \"Moby-Dick,\" but it came out to only tepid reviews. It was one such tepid review, by John Updike in The New Yorker, which pushed Roth over the edge into psychosis. Happily, Updike—who, as a novelist, was worth about five Roths and, as a human, about twenty or a hundred—lived long enough to learn this from Bloom's book, and I hope he found it gratifying and that he poured himself a highball and went and sat on his deck in Connecticut in his topsiders and cardigan and looked out at the golf course and sighed contentedly.\n\nOh, and Roth didn't deserve to date Mia Farrow either. But I digress.\n\nJanuary 8, 2022\n\nOnly a woman as sour as Claire Bloom could make me feel so much sympathy for Philip Roth.\n\nAugust 1, 2018\n\nI read this book a number of years ago, and I enjoyed it, though I remember Claire Bloom coming across as sweet but also rather weak-willed and wishy-washy. Having just finished I MARRIED A COMMUNIST by Philip Roth I thought I'd re-examine my impressions.\n\nThe one really poignant relationship described in this book is actually not a romantic one, it's Claire Bloom's longtime friendship with American writer Gore Vidal. Vidal was wealthy, aristocratic, and gay, and notoriously supercilious, rude, and impatient with just about everyone. But Claire Bloom does a wonderful job of describing how the two of them enjoyed a lifelong friendship that was always full of unspoken regret and the poignant \"if-only\" feeling sensitive women often get from gay men.\n\nPhilip Roth comes across as a complete ass-clown and a jerk. And no, I don't think Claire Bloom is making anything up. If anything, I think she's covering up a lot of horrible stuff. After reading Roth's \"reply\" novel, I MARRIED A COMMUNIST, I can see a lot of stuff I didn't see before. Claire Bloom talks about how Philip Roth had an almost paranoid fear of being ridiculed for being Jewish. He provoked fierce arguments with strangers over nothing. His fear was driven by self-hatred, I surmise. But what's interesting is that in his book Roth tries to project a lot of this stuff onto Claire Bloom. It's obvious that he was drawn to her because she's Jewish but evidently didn't \"look\" Jewish to a street tough from Newark (if that's what Roth thought he was.) Anyway, Claire says once that she's proud of being Jewish but doesn't spend a lot of time worrying about it, and that's that. But Roth, in his book, has to make \"Eve Frame\" a shrill, hysterical anti-Semite who is perpetually haunted by the horrible, ugly Jewish faces all around her. Now if that's not a classic case of projection, I'll eat my hat!\n\nSumming up, Claire Bloom might have had her problems, but compared to Philip Roth she comes across as sanity itself. On finishing the book I felt that I liked her a lot and Philip Roth really missed the boat. Oddly enough, the one thing I found annoying in this book is the way she keeps flaunting her atheism. It's not just that she's not religious, she keeps saying stuff like, \"I find the idea of God ridiculous and stupid. God is such a repellent concept to me.\" After the fourth or fifth time, I got the real point. God is the only man Claire Bloom isn't afraid to challenge. He let her down, just like all the others, but He is the only one she ever stood up to!\n\nJuly 29, 2013\n\nI actually loved this book. I saw her in Richard III some time last year and I thought I should check out some of her films (I guess you can say she is kind of new to me). When I found out she wrote a book, I had to get it. To be honest, it's not boring. Even her mother and father's life (which she explains in the book) was interesting. I must say that I was a little shocked about the affairs that she had or how many she had, but she's an actor. It's what they do, I guess. A must read.\n\nApril 13, 2012\n\nIf I made as many bad relationship and parenting choices as she did, I wouldn't write a book about it!\n\nJune 10, 2023\n\nThis memoir is interesting on a number of levels: hardship endured in the war years during Bloom’s formative years; the acting career of a beautiful, talented and ambitious Jewish woman; the sexual encounters, love affairs and in particular her relationship and marriage with the genius writer but flawed man, Philip Roth. If l am totally honest, l read this book for the insights into Roth.\n\nClaire Bloom has had a fascinating and full life. As memoirs go, Bloom’s writing, despite being revealing is often stilted in style and for this she often comes across as pretentious and selfish, even obtuse. She does, however, attempt to probe into the life events that defined her. Bloom was not forgiving of her father for his inadequacies, as she poignantly recounts. Additionally, her meritorious rise via Charlie Chaplin is covered, and also acknowledged in connection with how her talent overshadowed her younger brother’s needs. Conversely, the ‘candour’ about relationships with some of the greatest leading actors of the 20th century seem to lack depth. Bloom had affairs with Richard Burton and Laurence Olivier. She is dismissive of Burton’s first wife and his love letter excerpts are examples of affection that are trite, in comparison to the ones he wrote Liz. Bloom later befriends ‘Larry’s’ ex-wife Vivien Leigh with little compunction over the fling. Her encounters with Yul Brynner and Anthony Quinn are portrayed ambivalently, almost like career transactions (Quinn had been on a mission to sack her).\n\nIn contrast, Bloom’s relationship with Roth was long and complex. Together for 17 years before finally marrying, the marriage lasted 5 years. This time the candid narrative rocks with the manipulation and perversity of a brilliant, narcissistic man. Bloom states that Gore Vidal had forewarned her. The relationship was set entirely on Roth’s terms, based not only upon his predication to his writing but also compelled by a neurotic aversion towards Bloom’s daughter from her marriage to Rod Steiger. Maybe Roth could not reconcile the fact that he had never fathered a child. Bloom recounts how Roth gave her the ultimatum - him or the daughter. Incredibly, Bloom acquiesced to Roth’s terms but this does not appease him. Breakdowns, torment and anguish follow. A pre-nuptial agreement termed ‘unconscionable’ is also given focus. Roth comes out looking both miserly and stricken. After publication of Bloom’s memoir Roth wrote what many claim to be his “revenge novel” in ‘l Married a Communist’. Roth’s biography by Blake Bailey’s is a tome to be consulted for further perspective.\n\nClaire Bloom played Nora in Ibsen’s wonderful rendition of conflicting female independence and petulance. I do hope a full biography of Bloom is delivered one day because for me, she never played the victim nor was she the victor. She did not ‘leave’ a Doll’s House, she was pushed.\n\n3.5 stars rounded up.\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\n3 stars for the writing but 5 stars for the content. Gossipy, but also insightful. And of course, the Philip Roth relationship- which was the whole point of reading this book.\n\nNovember 9, 2014\n\nI picked this up used for a dollar at Shakespeare and Company in Berkeley. i thought it would be a light but engrossing travel read, and it was. The writing is \"okay\"--many of the tales that were summarized could have benefited from being stretched into scenes with a little dialogue--but what really makes the book interesting is the insight it gives into the psychology of a woman in the mid-twentieth century who was saved by her career, and the disturbing mindset of male-dependency. The long, blow-by-blow chapters covering her marriage to and divorce from Philip Roth (who, if only a fraction of what she says about him is true, is a mind-fing piece of work) are too long but, having written the book a year or two after the divorce, I suppose she can be forgiven for that.\n\nFebruary 25, 2008\n\nI agree with much of what is said below. Claire Bloom is not a good writer. Nor do I think she is particularly intelligent. It makes me wonder how she maintained a relationship with Roth for as long as she did. That being said, I did think this book contained quite a lot of good dirt. I read it in a day, it was just that addicting. Bloom is quite the little vamp :) I loved reading about her various love affairs (pre Philip Roth). And if 'I Married a Communist' is at all based on his relationship with her, he must really have hated her daughter. I give this one 3 stars for keeping me entertained throughout. Far more enjoyable than the Tom Cruise book.\n\nMay 16, 2018\n\nI enjoy memoirs, and this book’s title intrigued me. I would have chosen to read it regardless of the author’s marriage to Philip Roth. Furthermore, given that this accomplished actor does share candidly about her life – admitting mistakes without making excuses – and draws upon her therapy sessions to understand choices she made, I find it hard to judge its literary merits. Yet, possibly because of her generation (Bloom was born in 1931) and/or nationality (British), her writing lacks the depth and self-reflectiveness that prompts me to read memoirs. If I had not taken this book with me on a vacation, I would not have finished it.\n\nOctober 15, 2021\n\nWhat a mess. I read this book because I wanted to learn more about Philip Roth. What I learned was not a surprise. But what I learned about Claire Bloom in this was that she did not do well as a mother to her only child. She really did seem to sacrifice her daughter to maintain an unsustainable, unhappy relationship with Roth. We would all do better in hindsight, so I don’t wish to throw stones.\n\nJuly 29, 2020\n\nI guess if you showed up for the gossip, there's no point complaining about all the gossip. Still, how dreary to be drug through the details of a famous person's divorce from another famous crazy person. (Yes, Virginia, the rich are different, as F. Scott has it).\n\nFebruary 27, 2024\n\nI read this out of curiosity evoked by reading a book by Phillip Roth. I guess I was curious about the person who married him. Like so many times when you peek behind the curtain, it was less than Illuminating.\n\nJuly 3, 2013\n\nOh my God is this woman an idiot when it comes to men. Painful!\n\nMay 30, 2018\n\nOuch! (But Richard Burton comes off relatively well, at least in comparison).\n\nOctober 27, 2021\n\nRead this because I read \"I Married a Communist\" and I saw in a review that it was in part a response to this effort here\n\na she said he said kind of deal\n\nhe said some seriously damning things about her so i wanted to see what she had said in the first place to trigger him so badly\n\nLet me preempt the remainder here with my interest in all this\n\nI have never heard of her not being a thespian connaisseur and certainly not a fan of theatre or the works of Willy The Sheikh\n\nHim I have read many times but always found it VERY heavy albeit funny at times but clearly disturbed beyond belief by his background and childhood of unlove\n\nSo she tells us all about her childhood wartime in England and all that abandoned by father etc etc hers was no picnic either\n\nHer sexual politix deeply rooted in her generation born 1931 which can be best summarized as to any question in the phrase: \"You must ask my husband\"\n\nMost women of that generation sadly were programmed thus\n\nShe sleeps with any man who asks her it seems insofar as he is a name\n\nSad depressing state of affair for her i should say and for us to read about\n\nThe first few guys are way more boring than watching paint dry as is her time with them we yawwwwwwwwwwwnnnn and then we yawn\n\nThen enters Roth somewhere between neurosis and psychosis. Freud would say that the earlier the wounds were received the more likely psychosis will appear, neurosis comes from wounds received a tad later in childhood\n\nGod knows what they did to him in Newark .... but loox like he got a full deck of cards and never ever recovered\n\nShe is not interesting to me never warmed to her; her unhealthy clinging to her daughter seems really pathetic he had a point there shown very well in \"I Married a Communist\" But she has courage to tell this sad story\n\nSo many say here she cannot write. I thought that to be unfair she writes well enough to do a bio\n\nWe kind of guess she glossed over many of HER shortcomings altho she did show us some\n\nThere are many such damaged collateral funk-ups from the 30s 40s period traumatized one way or the other by the Second Great Butchery\n\nIt is a great read once you sashay past the boring actors she bedded/married\n\nNow we also are told that Roth The Monster wrote an account of the times he really lost the plot and that opus is titled:\"Operation Shylock: A Confession\"\n\nSeems like it should be a natural port of call after the book here and \"I Married a Communist\" But I may give it time before I delve anew into the darkness and pain that is Roth ....\n\nRead Leaving The Doll's House .... the tale told here is about humanity\n\n© shan 2021\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nI began reading this book to learn about her 5-year relationship with Richard Burton. Whether Miss Bloom understands it or not, she disclosed that she was little more than a booty call, one of countless women used by him and tossed away. She was never the prize that he sought, the woman he'd divorce Sybil for, and the ultimate ticket to superstardom that he finally found in Elizabeth Taylor. She was just someone he kept on a string and for her to pretend it was a great love affair shows a lack of self-awareness.\n\nThere is something cold and brittle about her writing and about her. To me, her portrayal of Doc Martin's awful mother always seemed not far from her real personality. This is essentially a boring book written by a sad and immature woman. I do not recommend it and could not finish it. I just did not want to read any more about her abysmally poor life decisions, especially those that affected her daughter.\n\nAugust 8, 2020\n\nI read this primarily for the sections in which Claire Bloom discusses her relationships with Richard Burton and Charles Chaplin. The writing is matter of fact and not quite as transparent as would make this more compelling a read for the reader. (Sally Field's memoir from 2018 is a gold standard for transparency in this ilk.) Claire Bloom is blessed with many natural talents and the opportunities to use them in theater and film over a very long life. I especially enjoyed the story of her audition and the filming of \"Limelight,\" Charles Chaplin's masterpiece about life in the theater, in which she plays ingenue/ballerina to Chaplin's doting rescuer/lover/clown.\n\nDecember 16, 2020\n\nThe name Claire Bloom was legend when I was growing up but I had imagined she was a silent film star and long deceased. When I saw the book at the book store I was happily surprised and hoping to find out more about the past of a famous actress from the 40's and 50's. What I had not known was that Ms. Bloom was Jewish and had experienced some unpleasantness while growing up. Her choices when it came to men reflected the sense of abandonment she had suffered all her life due to her father's having abandoned the family several times. I was saddened over Ms. Blooms experiences, and was left wanting to know more. The book was too short (a compliment).\n\nMay 8, 2017\n\nThere is no depth or reflection here. It is quite a catalogue of woes, and there is a sincerity and honesty in the telling.\n\nBut.... As a piece of writing, it is not at all distinguished, and there is not much nourishment as in something left to reflect on, observations worth mulling over, whether in agreement or disagreement. It is, sadly, like some of the worst celebrity autobiogs on the shelves. Which is a pity, because I think with better editorial direction this could have been a far better book.\n\nApril 11, 2021\n\nI love Philip Roth, but Bloom’s portrait of him as the most terrible of husbands rings true to me. She’s no stylist, but she has some highly entertaining stories about the various men she’s been involved with (Burton! Olivier! Quinn! Steiger! Roth!). And the details of her marriage—mph! She gets her revenge most excellently and with class."
