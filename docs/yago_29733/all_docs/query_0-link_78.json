        "text": "September 17, 1996\n\nClaire Bloom Looks Back in Anger at Philip Roth\n\nBy DINITIA SMITH\n\new major American novelists have as eagerly breached the boundaries of fact and fiction as Philip Roth. In book after book he has skirted perilously close to autobiography, naming characters \"Philip\" and turning his own life inside out for public inspection and even condemnation. But now Roth is playing a role in someone else's book, and the portrait is even less flattering than anything he might have written himself.\n\nNext month, Little, Brown & Company will publish a scathing memoir by Roth's former wife, the actress Claire Bloom. The book, called \"Leaving a Doll's House,\" paints the author as a self-centered misogynist and tells a bitter if one-sided story of a love gone sour.\n\nAdvance copies of the book have been circulating, and the gossip is considerable. Those few friends of the couple willing to speak publicly about their relationship profess that it seemed fine to them. \"He's tense; she's tense,\" Gore Vidal said from his home in Ravello, Italy. \"Each is neurotic. They were together 17 years; it couldn't have been all that bad.\" Like most of the couple's friends, Vidal is trying to distance himself from the memoir. \"It's always best to stay out of other people's divorces,\" he said. \"And their civil wars.\"\n\nBut true to the age of confessional television and tell-all biographies, drawing people into the sometimes unsavory details of a personal civil war is what this book is all about. And as everyone knows, war can be profitable.\n\nMs. Bloom has a contract from Vanity Fair for \"a lot of money,\" said her agent, Tina Bennett of Janklow & Nesbit Associates. The magazine has forbidden Ms. Bloom to talk about the book until it publishes an excerpt, scheduled for next month, Ms. Bennett said. Holly Wilkinson, a press agent for Little, Brown, said that an article based on an exclusive interview that Ms. Bloom has already given New York magazine would follow.\n\nMs. Bloom, approached by a reporter for an interview the other day, said: \"I am just desolate. I cannot talk to you.\"\n\nRoth isn't talking either. The writer, who changes his phone number frequently and is famously reclusive, could not be reached and did not respond to messages sent through friends. His agent, Andrew Wylie, returned none of a series of phone calls. In the absence of comments from the principals and their friends, there is only the memoir.\n\nIn the book, Ms. Bloom describes Roth, who achieved early fame for \"Portnoy's Complaint\" and won the National Book Award last year for \"Sabbath's Theater,\" as a man filled with \"a deep and irrepressible rage\" toward women. Ms. Bloom says Roth forced her 18-year-old daughter by a previous marriage to move out of the house because he regarded the girl as a rival for her attention and because the girl's conversation \"bored\" him.\n\nMs. Bloom contends that she nursed Roth through his period of highest literary attainment in the late 1970's and mid-80's, when he wrote such works as his trilogy, \"Zuckerman Bound,\" and \"The Counterlife,\" in which he named two characters \"Philip.\" But when she and Roth separated, sometime in late 1993 and early 1994, said Ms. Bloom, he sent her a bill fining her $62 billion -- a billion dollars for every year of her life -- because she refused to honor a prenuptial agreement. The agreement, she said, stipulated that Roth could terminate their marriage with no further responsibility to her and that their apartment and other possessions would revert to him.\n\nThe memoir begins with an account of Ms. Bloom's early life in London as the daughter of a devoted mother and a feckless father who seemed to have no real job. She had romantic relationships with several of her leading men, she writes, including Richard Burton, Yul Brynner and Sir Laurence Olivier.\n\nMs. Bloom eventually married the actor Rod Steiger, and they had a daughter, Anna. A second marriage followed, to the producer Hillard Elkins.\n\nMs. Bloom was 47 when she began her romance with Roth. In the memoir, the opening scene of their relationship reads like a parody of the daily life of two cultivated New Yorkers, with Roth on his way to his psychoanalyst, and Ms. Bloom on her way to her yoga class.\n\nFriends warned Ms. Bloom not to get involved with Roth. \" 'This is a mistake,' I said when she started,\" Vidal recalled. \" 'Do not involve yourself with Portnoy.' \"\n\nAgainst all advice, Ms. Bloom writes, she began living with Roth in his country house in Connecticut. There, Ms. Bloom, says, she helped Roth improvise the dialogue for his books, playing role games with him and coming up with lines that appeared in his novels.\n\nBut soon there were signs of trouble. Roth was suspicious and mistrustful, she said, and pressed her to send her daughter elsewhere. In the memoir, Ms. Bloom expresses guilt for having done so.\n\nBut the real problems began when Roth had a knee operation, she said, and became addicted to sleeping pills and an anti-anxiety drug. She writes that a terrible depression ensued, and that the couple took refuge on Martha's Vineyard in the home of their friend William Styron, who has written a moving book about his own depression.\n\nLater, when Roth wrote \"Deception,\" he named the character of the deceived wife \"Claire,\" Ms. Bloom writes, changing it only after she begged him to do so. Still, as if teasing his readers, Roth reserved the name of \"Philip\" for the book's narrator.\n\nDespite all, Ms. Bloom asked Roth to marry her, she said, and he agreed provided she signed the prenuptial agreement. Within two years, the marriage was in trouble, and the couple divorced in 1995.\n\nMs. Bloom ends the memoir on a poignant note, describing one of her last meetings with her former husband in a restaurant in New York where they joked and laughed. Waxing lyrical, she muses about Roth's inviting her back to \"our beautiful 18th-century farmhouse,\" now basking \"in the warm, fading light as never before.\" \"And then Philip took my hand,\" Ms. Bloom writes.\n\nBut that scene, she confesses, is \"fiction.\""
