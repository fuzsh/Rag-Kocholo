        "text": "I read her memoir about her relationship with Philip Roth. She wrote that he was a darling but turned into a monster after they married. She really made him out to be a psychopath but he wrote some great work after their divorce. This is the only memoir I’ve read that includes Roth so I don’t know if her story has been verified.\n\n[quote] She was an un-fucking-believably good Orlena Grimaldi on As the World Turns.\n\nI didn't realize she had been on a US soap.\n\nR20 Unfortunately she inherited her father physique.\n\nR21 I tried to read that piece of fiction but it was so dripping with BILE that I began to distrust everything. I desisted after 60 pages.\n\n[quote] It was cool.\n\nR19 I suspect her critics would suggest that her complete persona was cool. She was as cold and cerebral to the point of frigidity.\n\nThe BBC for some unknown reason asked her to play Karenina. She is as cold as Siberia. The production is as cheap as a railway waiting room and it isn't a patch on the brilliantly-photographed production starring Vivien and Ralph Richardson.\n\nHer Karenina is paired with Albert Lieven (whose career relied on submissive Nazis) and Sean Connery (who, prior to grooming and trimmed eyebrows, had such deep dimples in his cheeks that he looks like a pantomime doll).\n\n[quote] The two Bloom movies I most remember are \"The Clash Of The Titans\", and \"The Haunting\n\nShe's appeared in LOTS more important movies than those two.\n\nShe's appeared with the best; Chaplin, Olivier, Burton, Mason, Newman, and Hopkins as well as Steiger, Brynner and De Mille in 125 movies over 74 years.\n\nShe lost her virginity to Richard Burton, and they had an on-off affair over many years. Until one day:\n\nShe found him locked in 'a fervent embrace' with the American actress Susan Strasberg, seven years her junior, who bore a striking resemblance to Bloom. Claire paused only long enough to yell 'F*** off, the pair of you!' before slamming the door.\n\nShe was especially beautiful in Look Back In Anger.\n\nShe had terrible taste in men.\n\nShe married Roth because she liked the image of \"the famous writer\" as her husband."
