        "text": "Hazardous Exposure\n\nMalcolm Rayner, the village hypochondriac, has a splinter. When it is easily removed and he realises the consultation is nearly over, he mentions a cough. Jennifer gets a letter from the Pharmaceutical Council saying that Mrs Tishell no longer needs supervision so Jennifer worries that she will be moving on. Bert is miserable about Jennifer leaving and Al tells him he should do something to get her to stay. When Malcolm returns to the surgery, Martin listens to his chest and fears it could be serious. He asks Malcolm if he has ever worked with asbestos. A worried Malcolm drowns his sorrows in the local, and PC Penhale gets called to pick him up. Malcolm remembers that he fitted the insulation at the police station and in other houses in the village. Penhale puts up asbestos warning notices all over the village.\n\nListen With Mother\n\nDuring an examination, Mrs Tishell is smitten by Martin holding her hands and staring into her eyes, and falls head-over-heels in love with him again. Two military policemen call at the police station looking for Mike Pruddy. Al pretends not to know Mike, then goes to warn him the army are looking for him. Louisa has shocking news for Martin.\n\nChristmas Special: The End of Time, Pt. 1\n\nIt's the Tenth Doctor's final journey - but his psychotic nemesis the Master has been reborn, on Christmas Eve. With both determined to cheat death, the battle ranges from the wastelands of London to the mysterious Immortality Gate. Meanwhile, the alien race Ood warn of an even greater danger approaching, as a terrible shadow falls across the entire Universe.\n\nChristmas Special: The End of Time, Pt. 2\n\nThe Doctor faces the end of his life as the Master's plans hurtle out of control. With the sound of drums growing louder, and an ancient trap closing around the Earth, the Doctor and Wilf must fight alone. But sacrifices must be made, and the deadly prophecy warns: \"He will knock four times.\""
