        "text": "The first thing you notice as you step across the threshold of Claire Bloom’s home is a painting of Charlie Chaplin on the wall facing the door. Chaplin made her a star by casting her alongside him in Limelight in 1952 and became a mentor. His presence in her living room is a reminder of her extraordinary longevity as an actress.\n\nBloom performed with all the late greats of the British stage and screen, including Gielgud, Scofield, Olivier and Burton, and has sustained a career of more than 60 years. Her thespian and romantic lives have often overlapped. She had affairs with Olivier and Burton. And her high-profile husbands included the Oscar-winning actor Rod Steiger and, most famously and painfully, Philip Roth.\n\nNow, at 78,"
