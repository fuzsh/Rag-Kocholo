        "text": "Few careers in cinema can boast as illustrious a start as that of Claire Bloom. Born in Finchley in 1931, Bloom was a young actress starting out in theatre when she was spotted by the playwright Arthur Laurents, who suggested her to Charlie Chaplin for Limelight (1952), in which she was cast as the dancer Thereza.\n\nYour story in cinema commences in the most incredible way with Chaplin’s Limelight. But I wanted to start by asking how your interest in acting began. You had an aunt who worked in theatre – was she an influence?\n\nDid you go to the theatre and cinema much as a girl growing up in the 1930s and 40s?\n\nYou studied at Central and Guildhall for short periods. Did you learn anything useful there?\n\nSo it was really a case of learning on the job with the guidance of your colleagues in the theatre. And you were appearing in Peter Brook’s production of Ring round the Moon in 1949 when you heard that Chaplin wanted to see you for the role of Thereza in Limelight.\n\nDid you spend much time with Chaplin before shooting started?\n\nWas Chaplin very specific in his direction of you?\n\nYou had some stage experience and had been in one film, The Blind Goddess, before Limelight. Did acting for the camera come naturally to you?\n\nWhat are your memories of seeing Limelight for the first time?\n\nI guess the immediate reception of the film was complicated by Chaplin’s political problems at the time.\n\nAnd as quite a start to a young actress’s career…\n\nAfter Limelight you were contracted to Alexander Korda.\n\nThe film suffered from that comparison but it stands up very well now. Your scenes with Hildegarde Neff are particularly good. It’s a great dynamic: you as this English innocent abroad, she as this worldly German woman with secrets. How was it to work with her – and of course James Mason?\n\nSo what did you think of being labelled an “English rose” by the press at this time?\n\nIn 1955 you made Richard III in which, as Lady Anne, you have that extraordinary scene with Olivier. What was acting with him like?\n\nYou’d been in a lot of Shakespeare and period drama by this time. Was it important for you to start engaging with modern work and the Royal Court revolution with your part in Tony Richardson’s film of Look Back in Anger?\n\nHelena is such an interesting character in that she’s initially the only one to stand up to Jimmy, but ends up getting seduced: a bit like Lady Anne with Richard, in fact. Did you find that transition challenging?\n\nYou could relate?\n\nYour career and Burton’s intersected from an early age, on stage and screen. How was it to reunite with him for a final time on The Spy Who Came In from the Cold?\n\nYou were always getting some strong roles on TV around this time, such as Anna Karenina, opposite Sean Connery as Vronsky.\n\nYou mentioned that the Cukor film of Romeo and Juliet was a great inspiration for you. How was it to work with him on The Chapman Report in 1962? In a tonally odd film, your scenes stand out as the most intense: this self-destructive character, going through these encounters with men, has a touch of Blanche DuBois about her, a role you later played to great acclaim in the theatre.\n\nThe following year brought another memorable film in the shape of Robert Wise’s The Haunting. Did you enjoy this foray into horror?\n\nI understand that Julie Harris kept her distance from you during the shoot.\n\nWhat’s your view of the method?\n\nA Doll’s House has been an important work for you on both stage and screen – and you titled your second memoir after it. Tell me about your connection to Ibsen’s play.\n\nHow was it to transfer your performance to film?\n\nAnd from Ibsen to… Clash of the Titans!\n\nIn Brideshead Revisited you’re opposite Olivier again, playing Lady Marchmain. I believe you turned that part down initially.\n\nAfter Brideshead, Stephen Frears’ Sammy and Rosie Get Laid brought you right up to date in a racially diverse and turbulent contemporary London setting. The film is hard to see now but feels so relevant these days. What attracted you to the role of Alice, which I think Hanif Kureishi wrote with you in mind?\n\nThe film is upfront in its politics yet there’s a mystery to Alice that makes her one of the most compelling characters.\n\nHow was your experience on Doctor Who, in which you were playing the Doctor’s mother, apparently?\n\nThere was also some mystery to your most recent role, in Stephen Poliakoff’s Summer of Rockets.\n\nDo you have any other projects yet to be released?\n\nIt’s a strange time to be celebrating a 90th birthday. How do you feel about the future of the creative industries at the moment? Are you optimistic that audiences will return to theatres and cinemas when they can, or are people just satisfied with watching at home now?"
