        "text": "CLAME BLOOM? Of course—that girl in Chaplin's “Limelight.” But wasn’t she the nymphomaniac in “The Chap man Report”? And that witchy neurotic in “The Haunting”? One and the same. The girl is a woman.\n\nOnly in recent years—and roles—has the 33 ‐ year ‐ old Britisher managed to shake one of the most precarious labels in show business: the perennial ingenue. Such was the lingering impact of the Chaplin film and her exquisite portrayal of the youthful ballerina, still somewhat overshadowing the rather erratic caliber of the films that have followed. Time is changing things.\n\nToday, as Mrs. Rod Steiger and the mother, of a 4‐yearold daughter, Anna, she lives in a quiet, tree‐shaded sector of Brooklyn Heights, travelling widely for carefully‐chosen film, stage and television commitments. “I’m older now,” she said last week during a restaurant chat, “and it's a professional advantage if you’re anxious to branch out and experiment toward things that are different.”\n\nPhysically, Miss Bloom remains well in bloom, with delicate features and a soft voice suggesting a Botticelli madonna. The alert, intelligent eyes and roguish verbal postscripts are entirely her own. So is her ready laugh‑ the light, musical peal of a contented woman. Her man ner is courteous, friendly and reserved.\n\n“I hope ‘The Outrage’ comes off well,” she said of her new M‐G‐M vehicle, coming up shortly. “It seemed a right thing to do and it's a good actress’ part.” The new drama is actually “Rashomon” No. 3. First came the famed Japanese picture, which Michael and Fay Kanin adapted into the Broadway play teaming, and forever, Mr. and Mrs. Steiger.\n\n‘Rashomon’Revisited\n\n“The new picture has a post‐Civil War setting. We worked for three weeks in the mountains near Tucson, then back in the studio area. Basically it's the same story. I’m the wife again, Laurence Harvey is the husband and Paul Newman plays the bandit, a Mexican. In outline, it's still four different versions of an act of violence, as four people see it. Edward G. Robinson is the fourth, a confidence man. It's people seeing things as they like to—we all do, don’t we? There's a little bit of truth in all of it, The wife, for instance, sees herself as a bruised violet, but she's‐ more aggressive here than in the picture or the play.”\n\nShe had this to say of her director, Martin Ritt. “He's a gentle, charming, gifted man with a lovely, gruff exterior he likes to think people notice.” Miss Bloom smiled pensively. “No, the picture's in black and white, not color, and I think it's wise for the stark content. ‘The Brothers Karamazov,’ I think, would have been better without it. Not so garish.”\n\nMiss, Bloom laughed and shook her head. “Color. ‘Alexander the Great,’ my worst picture, had it. Wasn’t it awful! As for ‘Brothers,’ that was my return to Hollywood, after working abroad. I enjoyed making the picture, though. ‘The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm’ had color too, but it came through rather heavy‐handedly. That was another return, in a way. I had just had a baby and I did the picture under duress, as a way of getting back into circulation.\n\n“But it was ‘The Chapman Report’ that saved my—brain. I did it sort of back‐to‐back with ‘Grimm.’ It was such a well‐written part and George Cukor is a divine director of women. I thought the ending a little pat and tidy. And then what happened?” She chuckled. “After the picture I had three more offers to play nymphomaniacs. Wouldn’t you know it?”\n\nGift of Tongues\n\nVisiting Italy with Mr. Steiger last year, Miss Bloom quietly made two unreleased movies. “Rod was there, also making two. Linguistically, there's no problem today. I used what little Italian I know. They help you. One was a four‐part picture called “High Infidelity.” I play opposite Charles Aznavour, and I’d better not tell too much about the plot. We had a good young director named Elio Petri—one to watch. The other was “The Schoolmaster of Vigevano,” opposite Alberto Sordi. It's what I’d call a grotesque comedy, involving a poor teacher and a driving, ambitious woman.”\n\nMiss Bloom believes, as do others, that films are primarily a director's medium. “Take ‘America, America.’ The whole thing was Kazan's personal stamp. The director is certainly important. I loved working with Tony Richardson in ‘Look Back in Anger.’ He gives you enormous freedom to experiment, even improvise. In a way Ritt does, too. Cukor is just the opposite. He likes you to stick to the script.\n\n“As much as I like visiting Hollywood to work, Rod and I prefer life in a big city, with so much activity—the four changing seasons. We lived for a while in Greenwich Village near Sheridan Square, but it seemed no place to raise a child. So we bought a house in Brooklyn —yes, Brooklyn,” she :added, smiling. “And we love it. No we don’t swap final advice about scripts. That can be dangerous, living together. As for our little Anna, her main interests are rope‐skip‑ping and anything pertaining to the ballet. I took her to the children's section of the Metropolitan Museum the other day and she adored it.”\n\nThe word, ballet, prompted a mention of “Limelight”\n\n“It's still my favorite role and picture,” Miss Bloom noted rather wistfully. “The extraordinary artistry of Mr. Chaplin. I see where it's coming back here in that festival at the Plaza Theater. I wonder if now I could judge the picture fairly. I Wonder if it again.”"
