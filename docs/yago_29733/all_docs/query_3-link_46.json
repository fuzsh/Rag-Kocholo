        "text": "Film Forum\n\n209 West Houston St.\n\nTuesday, May 24, $25, 8:00\n\n212-727-8110\n\nwww.filmforum.org\n\nBorn Patricia Claire Blume in England in 1931, Claire Bloom has had an exemplary nearly sixty-year-career onstage and in film, beginning in 1952 in Charlie Chaplin’s Limelight and continuing with such cinematic classics as Sir Laurence Olivier’s Richard III (1955), Richard Brooks’s The Brothers Karamazov (1958), Tony Richardson’s Look Back in Anger (1959), Ralph Nelson’s Charly (1968), Stephen Frears’s Sammy and Rosie Get Laid (1987), Woody Allen’s Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), and Tom Hooper’s The King’s Speech (2010). In her 1996 memoir, Leaving a Doll’s House, the thrice-married Bloom, whose husbands have included actor Rod Steiger and author Philip Roth, wrote, “I have tried to shed light on an unfinished journey. It has been a trip worth taking. And understanding does away with regret.” Bloom, who has played opposite such icons as Richard Burton, Paul Newman, Sean Connery, and the aforementioned Allen, Olivier, and Chaplin, will be looking back at her career, most likely without anger, on May 24 at Film Forum in a special evening moderated by film historian Foster Hirsch. Don’t miss this rare opportunity to see one of film’s most underrated starlets, up close and personal."
