The term of the COA is 10 years from the date of purchase and is valid to the original purchaser only. We have an outstanding reputation for the thoroughness of our research, for our business integrity and for our service to our clients. We financially stand behind our COA which is one of the main reasons we've been able to stay in business for so long (since 1981)!\n\nWithin the 10 year COA period, each hand-signed item is guaranteed to pass PSA/DNA or JSA authentication or we will refund your full purchase price."
