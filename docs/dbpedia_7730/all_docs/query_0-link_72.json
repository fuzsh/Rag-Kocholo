        "text": "18 August 2022\n\nToday Marks four years since the passing away of Kofi Annan, Former Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\nKofi Annan, in full Kofi Atta Annan, (born April 8, 1938, Kumasi, Gold Coast (now Ghana)—died August 18, 2018, Bern, Switzerland), Ghanaian international civil servant, who was the secretary-general of the United Nations (UN) from 1997 to 2006.\n\nKofi Annan was the Seventh Secretary General of the United Nations and he served as UN Secretary-General from January 1997 to December 2006. During that time, he led a comprehensive programme of reform that sought to revitalize the United Nations and make the international system more effective.\n\nIn 2001, he and the United Nations were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.\n\nKofi Annan, the late United Nations Secretary-General, championed everything from stronger human rights and peacekeeping operations around the world, to revitalizing the UN itself by insisting on creating a new dynamic deputy chief role, an effective ethics office and the mantra of zero tolerance for sexual exploitation.\n\nKofi Annan joined the UN at the age of 24, first working as an administrator at the World Health Organization and then becoming head of personnel for the UN mission in Cairo, deputy director of the UNHCR in Geneva and eventually deputy UN secretary-general.\n\nIn 1993, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali nominated him under-secretary-general for peacekeeping, putting him in charge of 75,000 peacekeepers around the world.\n\nAfter his tenure as Secretary General, he set up the Kofi Annan Foundation in 2007 to mobilise leaders of all sectors to provide leadership where it is needed.\n\nYour Legacy Will Remain A True Inspiration For All of Us\n\nMay Sou Rest In Peace\n\n#KofiAnnan"
