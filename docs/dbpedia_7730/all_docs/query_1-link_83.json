        "text": "File photo taken on June 30, 2012 shows then UN and Arab League Envoy to Syria Kofi Annan during a press conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Former Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate Kofi Annan passed away at the age of 80 on Saturday, the Geneva-based Kofi Annan Foundation announced. (Xinhua/Xie Haining)\n\nGENEVA, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate Kofi Annan passed away at the age of 80 on Saturday, the Geneva-based Kofi Annan Foundation announced.\n\n\"It is with immense sadness that the Annan family and the Kofi Annan Foundation announce that Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate, passed away peacefully on Saturday 18th August after a short illness,\" the Foundation said in a statement issued Saturday.\n\nA diplomatic source said that Annan died in a Swiss hospital, and his wife Nane and their children Ama, Kojo and Nina were by his side during his last days.\n\nBorn on April 9 of 1938 in Ghana, Kofi Annan served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. He and the UN were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe was the founder and chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation, as well as chairman of The Elders, an international organization founded by Nelson Mandela.\n\nCalling Kofi Annan as \"a son of Ghana\", the Kofi Annan Foundation said in its statement that Annan was particularly committed to African development and deeply engaged in many initiatives, including his chairmanship of the Africa Progress Panel and his early leadership of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.\n\n\"Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his deep compassion and empathy. He selflessly placed others first, radiating genuine kindness, warmth and brilliance in all he did,\" the Foundation said.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday expressed \"profound sadness\" for Annan's passing, saying the former UN chief was \"a guiding force for good\".\n\n\"In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,\" Guterres said in a statement.\n\n\"I was proud to call Kofi Annan a good friend and mentor. I was deeply honored by his trust in selecting me to serve as UN High Commissioner for Refugees under his leadership. He remained someone I could always turn to for counsel and wisdom -- and I know I was not alone,\" Guterres said.\n\nWhile mourning the former UN chief, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein described Annan as \"irreplaceable\" and called him as \"humanity's best example, epitome of human decency and grace\".\n\n\"There are some human beings who will seem irreplaceable to us, rare human beings. Kofi Annan is high among them,\" Zeid said.\n\n\"He was a friend to thousands and a leader of millions. To me -- like to so many in the UN, he was my immediate boss when I was thirty-one years of age -- and what a boss!\" he added.\n\nAccording to Zeid, Annan was \"always courageous, direct in speech, but never discourteous\"."
