        "text": "Kofi Annan was born in 1938 in Kumasi, Ghana. He is a part of a rather prominent family of the Ghanaian Aristocracy and is also the grandson and nephew of three tribal chieftains. In his early to mid-teens, he attended several schools until finally settling on the Methodist boarding school of Mfantsipim, it was here that Annan learned that “Suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere.” This life lesson would later play a big role in not just Annan’s career, but his life as well. He graduated from Mfantsipim in 1957, the same year that Ghana finally managed to declare its independence from Great Britain. He then attended multiple universities all over the world such as the former “Kumasi College of Science and Technology (now Nkrumah University), Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, and finally the MIT school of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts.” (Biography.com) In college, he received multiple degrees including a Masters of Science, International Relations, and he even went on to learn English, French, and several other African languages.\n\nKofi Annan has been a civil servant all his life from when he first started as a Budget Officer for the World Health Organization, all the way to his extremely decorated career as Secretary-General. After leaving his first job at the UN, Annan found himself as the Assistant Secretary-General for multiple branches of the United Nations including Human Resources, Management and Security Coordinator; Program Planning, Budget and Finance and Controller, and Peacekeeping Operations. In response to his heavily criticized passiveness during the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, Annan expressed regret at the fact that he “could and should have done more to sound the alarm and rally support,” according to a March 2004 BBC article.” (Biography.com) It was not until 1997 that Kofi Annan was finally elected by the UN Security Council to become Secretary-General. During this point of his life, Annan went onto to accomplish many things, most notably his five-point call to action plan he formed in 2001 in response to the growing spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Because of this plan, Annan was able to create a Global AIDS and Health fund as well as earn the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001. In 2006, Annan finally retired from his position as Secretary General and returned home to Ghana.\n\nA big part of Kofi Annan’s life is his stalwart belief that the rights of every man, woman, and child must be protected, that peace should be the ultimate goal for humanity, and even that our world is precious and we must do everything in our power to protect and preserve our planet’s natural beauty. In the video listed below, Annan is interviewed about his personal perspectives on the topic of climate change, the wasting of natural resources, and the ever-growing sphere of Industrialization all throughout the world’s nations and how it is our duty to protect rather than extort our planet.\n\n(Credit to skollfoundation. “Kofi Annan: The World I’m Working To Create.” YouTube, YouTube, 12 Aug. 2013, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4ILV4IL-PA.)\n\nAs Annan mentions in his video, the safety and protection of the planet, and of ourselves is not just the responsibility of the minority, those who have major political power, but that everyone is responsible for everyone’s welfare. He wishes to create a world in which humanity focuses on the needs of not just individuals, but the needs of everyone, then he believes that the world will become a much safer place to be for all life on Earth.\n\nKofi Annan may have retired as Secretary-General, but that did not stop him from forming the Kofi Annan foundation in 2007 which had the intent of helping protect against threats to peace, development, and human rights. According to the Kofi Annan Foundation: He “Was elected to become a member of the Global Elders, an independent group of global leaders who work to defend peace and human rights.” (Kofi Annan Foundation). Annan was appointed to co-chair the African Personalities Panel to help find a peaceful resolution to the violence after the 2007 presidential election in Kenya. Annan even was appointed by the UN to the Arab League’s envoy to Syria where he developed a six-point plan to find a peaceful resolution to the raging civil war. Unfortunately, due to the stubborn nature of the Syrian Government and the Rebels, as well as the Security Council’s inability to find a solution, they were unable to find peace for Syria.\n\nI personally believe that Kofi Annan is a very admirable and respectable man who truly tries and has done great good in the world. From helping to spread global awareness for AIDS/HIV and for fighting to help those who are suffering from oppression, mass genocides, and ethnic cleansing. Kofi Annan has never shyed away from a daunting task, and even though he has had his fair number of setbacks, he has never let them define who he is. I also believe him to be a very level-headed and realisitc man, he sets goals that are acheivable and plausible, but arranges them in such a way that they all go towards his bigger goal of creating a truly peaceful earth. Now while many phlianthropists, international foundations, and other social activists claim to want world peace and creating a better world for all, very few of them actually follow through with what they say, either due to them giving up because the project failed or simply because they truly do not mean what they say. Kofi Annan however, has and continues to do great work in the defense of human rights and in the defense of the planet’s sustainability. Yes he has had setbacks, and yes he may not have all the support in the world, but regardless of all these things, Annan still manages to find ways to make positve changes in this world, even if at that point in time, they might seem small and insignificant, they all contribute to his major goal of creating a new world of peace and stability. I would like to close with quote from Annan that I think best represents what he has been trying to work towards all these years.\n\n“We are not only all responsible for each other’s security, we are also, in some measure, responsible for each other’s welfare.”\n\n-Kofi Annan\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Kofi Annan Biography.” Kofi Annan Foundation, http://www.kofiannanfoundation.org/kofi-annan/.\n\n“Kofi Annan.” Biography.com, A&E Networks Television, 28 Apr. 2017, http://www.biography.com/people/kofi-annan-9185694."
