        "text": "Kofi Annan, the soft-spoken and patrician diplomat from Ghana who became the seventh secretary general of the United Nations, projecting himself and his organization as the world’s conscience and moral arbiter despite bloody debacles that stained his record as a peacekeeper, died on Saturday in Bern, Switzerland. He was 80.\n\nHis death, at a hospital there, was confirmed by his family in a statement released by the Kofi Annan Foundation, which is based in Switzerland. It said he died after a short illness but did not specify the cause.\n\nAwarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, Mr. Annan was the first black African to head the United Nations, doing so for two successive five-year terms beginning in 1997 — a decade of turmoil that challenged that sprawling body and redefined its place in a changing world.\n\nOn his watch as what the Nobel committee called Africa’s foremost diplomat, Al Qaeda struck New York and Washington, the United States invaded Iraq, and Western policymakers turned their sights from the Cold War to globalization and the struggle with Islamic militancy.\n\nAn emblem as much of the United Nations’ most ingrained flaws as of its grandest aspirations, Mr. Annan was the first secretary general to be chosen from among the international civil servants who make up the organization’s bureaucracy.\n\nHe came to be likened in stature to Dag Hammarskjold, the second secretary general, who died in a mysterious plane crash in Africa in 1961. Mr. Annan was credited with revitalizing the United Nations’ institutions, shaping what he called a new “norm of humanitarian intervention,” particularly in places where there was no peace for traditional peacekeepers to keep.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
