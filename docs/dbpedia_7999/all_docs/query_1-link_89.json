        "text": "While many of his peers chase production fads or accept every sponsorship opportunity that arises, deadmau5 remains true to a single vision which he masterfully executes; his thousands of fans who attend his immersive audio-visual shows attest to that fact.\n\nDeadmau5 has become an iconic figure in electronic music culture with his distinctive mouse head helmet, winning numerous awards while championing music piracy as an activist cause.\n\nJoel Thomas Zimmerman (born January 5, 1981) is a Canadian electronic music producer and DJ.\n\nJoel Thomas Zimmerman was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario and soon after discovered an affinity for music and computers, becoming interested in producing tracks using computer-aided music software (CAM). By 1998 he had begun producing his own tracks using various computer-assisted music (CAM) programs – becoming widely renowned electronic music producer with his stage name deadmau5.\n\nAfter graduating from Westlane Secondary School, Zimmerman worked at T-shirt printing shops and canneries in order to save up for studio equipment. He began composing music licensing companies before earning the moniker Deadmau5 through an Internet chat room where he described a mouse that had passed away due to maximum character limitations of the program he was using for such chat sessions.\n\nZimmerman has released four full-length albums since 2005; Get Scraped was released through ZOOLOOK Records in July 2005; Vexillology by Play Records followed a year later introducing his signature musical style, mixing progressive house with techno.\n\nIn 2007, Zimmerman launched his own record label, mau5trap, in partnership with Ultra Records and Ministry of Sound. Their initial release, Random Album Title, featured Kaskade singles such as Faxing Berlin and I Remember on it.\n\nHe is best known for his productions in the genres of progressive house and electro house.\n\nDeadmau5 stands out among producers and DJs with his distinctive sound, which features complex beats, synthesizers, and heavy basslines – his trademark style has made him one of the world’s most-beloved electronic dance music artists. Not content to focus solely on his musical productions however, Deadmau5 also uses his success to give back to society through various charitable projects.\n\nHe has collaborated with various musicians such as Kaskade and Skrillex, appearing on a variety of television shows and festivals as well as making donations to charitable causes such as cancer research and animal welfare.\n\nDeadmau5 has gone beyond his expertise in progressive house and electro house to explore other genres of electronic music, namely dubstep. Dubstep is an underground genre of electronic dance music characterized by heavy basslines and syncopated rhythms, making it immensely popular throughout North America and around the globe. Many artists incorporate its sounds into their musical style.\n\nDeadmau5 is an innovative and diverse producer with an eclectic repertoire within progressive house. By exploring his discography or attending one of his live performances, you can gain more insight into his genre-spanning style.\n\nHe has received several awards for his music.\n\nDeadmau5 has made his mark through his music as well as live performances. His stage persona can be recognized by the distinctive mau5head mask he wears; an iconic part of his stage presence.\n\nHe is a multi-platinum Grammy and Juno Award nominated producer, having released several critically acclaimed albums. He has collaborated with artists like Kaskade, MC Flipside and Rob Swire of Pendulum; additionally he established a charitable foundation which provides donations and fundraising efforts in support of various causes.\n\nDeadmau5 is perhaps one of the most outspoken DJs out there, known for his long list of feuds and Twitter storms that frequently surface. A native Torontonian, Deadmau5 also makes waves with his self-deprecating potshots at an industry full of overblown egos; but when he gets into his groove nothing else comes close."
