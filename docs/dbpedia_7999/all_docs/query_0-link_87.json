        "text": "“The legendary Canadian DJ accepted the award from Billboard Canada President Mo Ghoneim and Chief Commercial Officer Elizabeth Crisante at the Canadian Live Music Industry Awards on June 4.\n\nThis past Tuesday (June 4), deadmau5 was inducted into the Canadian Music Week (CMW)’s Music Industry Hall of Fame. President of Billboard Canada Mo Ghoneim and Chief Commercial Officer Elizabeth Crisante were on stage at Toronto’s Frontenac Ballroom at the Westin Harbour Castle to present the award.\n\n“It is a singular honour to be part of history in the making as we induct deadmau5, Joel Zimmerman, into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame,” announced Crisante.\n\nThe announcement was accompanied by a three-minute video montage celebrating Zimmerman’s illustrious 25-year career. Clips from concerts of rowdy crowds dancing in front of stages adorned with deadmau5’s iconic cube, Zimmerman at the helm, played on big screens in the ballroom.\n\n“I promised I wouldn’t cry,” he said, tongue-in-cheek. “I’d like to thank my agent, my manager, my team, friends, family and Canada. Toronto in general is where I love being and I plan on staying put,” said Zimmerman, holding his newly acquired trophy. “This is great, this means a lot to me. Thank you!”\n\n“It’s crazy,” he said of receiving the award in the interview. “It feels a little not right, but I am so grateful. It’s my first [Hall of Fame or lifetime achievement] award, which is cool yet scary. It’s like ‘well, good run dude.’”\n\nHe’s nowhere near done, he clarified, but appreciates the honour — especially in Canada, which is so meaningful to the Niagara Falls, Ontario-born artist."
