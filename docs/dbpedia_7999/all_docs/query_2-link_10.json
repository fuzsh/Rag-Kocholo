As you are partying and presumably even consuming alcohol, you need to stay hydrated as you are usually under the Canadian summer sun and can also be dehydrated. You can stay cool by wearing a toque (Canadian term for a knit cap), sunscreen, and sunglasses, and you can also cool down with frequent breaks in shaded areas or beer gardens. You should also make sure you get protective earbuds, as the vocals and bass sounds can damage your ears, and if you are someone who is standing right in front of the speakers, it is important to use earplugs. Make sure you are also paired up with a buddy or a member of your crew, and they can look out for you, and you can do the same. You can also set up meeting points at the festival grounds if you get lost in the crowd, so you don't panic and can easily reunite with your friends or family.\n\nEssential Items to Carry During a Music Festival in Canada\n\nIt is important to carry essential things to a music festival in Canada as you may not leave the grounds for long hours, and having essentials helps you in times of need. You may need things like:\n\n1. Backpack or a fanny pack\n\n2. Portable power bank and a phone charger\n\n3. A government-issued ID (driver's licence or Canadian passport)\n\n4. Deodorant (a small travel-sized one)\n\n5. A basic first aid kit with bandages, antiseptic wipes, and pain medication\n\n6. Any allergy medication or prescribed medications you regularly take\n\n7. Sunscreen (a high SPF is recommended for the Canadian sun)\n\n8. Tampons, sanitary pads, or menstrual cups\n\n9. Wet wipes and toilet paper (festival porta-potties can run out of supplies)\n\n10. A lighter, and if you smoke, carry your own smoking accessories (or a vape pen if allowed)\n\n11. Canadian snacks and candy like Smarties, Coffee Crisp, or maple candies to have if you get dehydrated"
