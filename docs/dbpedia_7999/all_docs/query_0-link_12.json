        "text": "Origin: Canada\n\nJoel Thomas Zimmerman (Niagara Falls, January 5, 1981), known professionally as Deadmau5 (pronounced “dead-mouse”), is a Canadian electronic music producer, DJ, and musician. He received his first keyboard for Christmas when he was a teenager. His music career began in the late 1990s. After he graduated, he worked with an online music licensing company and as a programmer. Zimmerman released his debut studio album, titled Get Scraped on July 26, 2005. Deadmau5 mainly produces progressive house music. In 2007 Zimmerman started his own record label, mau5trap records, and in 2008 he won his first Juno Award for dance recording of the year for “All U Ever Want,” a collaboration with Billy Newton-Davis. Zimmerman’s Deadmau5 stage persona was easily identifiable by the oversized “mau5head” mask that he wore while performing.\n\nShare\n\nTags"
