        "text": "Here is Rock and Roll Hall of Fame expert Charles Crossley, Jr’s detailed analysis of the 2016 nominees (reposted here with permission from his message board):\n\nHere's my yearly analysis of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominee Ballot. Each year, the nominating committee (I refer to them as the \"nomcom\") select a group of acts eligible for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Acts are eligible 25 years after their first national release. The nominating committee is composed of rock critics, music industry executives, managers, a few musicians, one or two music historians and a few people I’m not sure who they are. . . . Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine is Chairman of the R&RHoF, Joel Peresman is CEO of the R&RHoF Foundation, Greg Harris is CEO of the R&RHoF Museum, and Jon Landau, manager of Bruce Springsteen, is President of the R&RHoF Nominating Committee. The Foundation oversees the Museum, the Library and Archives, the nominating and induction processes, fundraising and the induction ceremony, its biggest fundraiser.\n\nIt seems many people define rock as “white boys playing loud”, with maybe a few exceptions that seem to prove the rule. Many others have a broad definition of rock using one rule of thumb or another. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame uses a broad definition, pointing back to the beginning of rock in the late 40s on. Personally, I define rock from the perspective of Alan Freed, the disc jockey who popularized the term “rock and roll” to refer to the music rather than just sex. Freed played what we would call early R&B and doo wop, and called that “rock and roll”. I define rock and roll as any music Freed played and any music that is derived from what Freed played. And that covers a lot of music. . . .\n\nMy analysis started as a reaction to many theories about who the nomcom nominates. People have written that the nomcom nominates this type of act or that type of act. The analysis has now grown beyond a tool of disproving theories to just being plain interesting.\n\nSo, first, let’s look at this year’s R&RHoF nominee ballot:\n\n*The Cars\n\n*Cheap Trick\n\n*Chic\n\n*Chicago\n\n*Deep Purple\n\n*Janet Jackson\n\n*The J.B.'s\n\n*Chaka Khan (Note: this is as a soloist, not as a member of Rufus)\n\n*Los Lobos\n\n*Steve Miller (Note: unless the R&RHoF changes its mind, this is just Steve Miller, and not the Steve Miller Band)\n\n*Nine Inch Nails\n\n*N.W.A\n\n*The Smiths\n\n*The Spinners\n\n*Yes\n\nNext, let’s look at the subgenres represented.\n\nNote: artists don’t like being labeled by subgenres or styles. It’s not how they usually look at creating music, and they see it as a type of pigeon-holing that keeps people from hearing their music. That said, fans, radio stations and retailers use subgenres or styles to help them sort through the myriads of acts to find acts that to them seem similar. I don’t mean to offend any artists, but please understand – this is how fans view music acts.\n\n2 – Alternative\n\n1 – Dance pop\n\n1 - Disco\n\n1 - Funk\n\n1 – Jazz rock\n\n1 - Metal\n\n1 – New wave\n\n1 – Philly soul\n\n1 – Pop rock\n\n1 – Power pop\n\n1 – Progressive rock\n\n1 - Rap\n\n1 – Roots rock\n\n1 – Soul\n\nNext, by members, including birthplaces. Asterisks (*) indicates members who will most likely be inducted, either because they appeared on two important recordings or because, in the case of Nine Inch Nails, they were Trent Reznor (yes, I'm blunt)....

My preference is that they induct everyone down through Tommy Bolin.\n\n*Janet Jackson\n\nb. 16 May 1966 in Gary, Indiana\n\nThe J.B.'s *William \"Bootsy\" Collins - bass (B. 26 Oct 1951, Cincinnati, Ohio)\n\n*Johnny Griggs - congas (birthdate ??? birthplace ???)\n\n*Clyde Stubblefield - drums (B. 18 Apr 1943 in Chattanooga, Tennessee)\n\n*Frank \"Kash\" Waddy - drums (birthdate ???, birthplace (Cincinatti, Ohio???))\n\n*St. Clair Pinckney - flute & baritone saxophone (B. 17 Sep 1930-D. 11 Feb 1999, Atlanta, Georgia) (birthplace ???, cause of death (lung cancer???))\n\n*Phelps \"Catfish\" Collins - guitar (B. 17 Oct 1943, in Cincinnati, Ohio-D. 06 Aug 2010 in Cincinnati, Ohio of cancer)\n\n*Bobby Byrd - piano (B. 14 Aug 1934 in Toccoa, George-D. 12 Sep 2007 in Loganville, Georgia of lung cancer)\n\n*Robert \"Chopper\" McCullough - tenor saxophone (birthdate ???, birthplace ???)\n\n*Clayton \"Chicken\" Gunnels - trumpet (birthdate ???, birthplace ???)\n\n*Darryl \"Hasaan\" Jamison - trumpet (birthdate ???, birthplace ???)\n\n*John \"Jabo\" Starks - drums (B. 26 Oct 1938 in Mobile, Alabama)\n\n*Hearlon \"Cheese\" Martin- guitar (Birthdate???

So, being the first, there’s bound to be a number of musicians left off the list. Please appreciate the craziness of pulling from disparate sources and double-checking. To see how I arrived at this list, please click this link: http://ourrockandrollhalloffame71305.yuku.com/reply/30780/The-JAMES-BROWN-BAND-The-JBs#reply-30780Note 2: I tried to include every member that was on at least two of James Brown’s major R&B hits during the 70s as well as probably one of the J.B.’s albums. I say “probably,” because no one seems to have listed which musicians appeared on any of the J.B.’s albums except the first one, and that one remained unreleased until 2014. I have used the musicians listed on the J.B.'s compilation Pass The Peas: The Best Of The J.B.'s to help confirm which musicians were on any of the J.B.'s albums.Note 3: The James Brown Band was James Brown’s backing band until they walked out because of financial disagreements in 1970. The J.B.’s were created and named when James Brown hired the Pacemakers as his backing band in 1970. So, the only members of the James Brown Band I’ve included are the ones who have passed through the ranks of the J.B.’s during the 70s and played on at least two James Brown R&B hits and one J.B.’s album. The big question mark is Alfred “Pee Wee” Ellis – did he or didn’t he?\n\n*Chaka Khan (Note: this is as a soloist, not as a member of Rufus)\n\nB.

Richmond, California - D. 30 Oct 2009, Paradise, California)\n\n*Byron Allred - keyboards (B. 27 Oct 1948, Logan, Utah)\n\n*David Denny - guitar (note: member of Frumious Bandersnatch) (B. 05 Feb 1948, Berkeley, California)\n\n*Greg Douglas - guitar (B. 11 Oct 1949, Concord, California)\n\nKenny Lee Lewis - guitar, bass (B. birthdate ???, Pasadena, California)\n\nJohn Massaro - guitar (B. birthdate ???, birthplace ???)\n\nGordy Knudtson drums (B. birthdate ???, birthplace ???)\n\nBilly Peterson bass (B. birthdate ???, Minneapolis, Minnesota)\n\nNine Inch Nails *Trent Reznor (b. 17 May 1965 in Mercer, Pennsylvania)\n\nChris Vrenna\n\nRon Musarra\n\nRichard Patrick\n\nGary Talpas\n\nNick Rushe\n\nDavid Haymes\n\nLee Mars\n\nJames Wooley\n\nJeff Ward\n\nRobin Finck\n\nDavid Lohner\n\nCharlie Clouser\n\nJerome Dillon\n\nAlessandro Cortini\n\nJeordie “Twiggy Ramirez” White\n\nAaron North\n\nJosh Freese\n\nAlex Carapetis\n\nJustin Meldal-Johnsen\n\nIlan Rubin\n\nJosh Eustis\n\nPino Palladino\n\nNote: Interestingly, Reznor, instead of hiring new musicians like he usually does, brought back Finck and Cortini and kept Rubin for Hesitation Marks and the following tours. So, there are no new members added to the roster. I’m not convinced that changes the probability that the R&RHoF would only induct Trent Reznor as Nine Inch Nails. But it does add one more consideration.N.W.A *Ice Cube (b. O’Shea Jackson on 15 Jun 1969 in Los Angeles, California)\n\n*Easy-E (b. Eric Lynn Wright on 07 Sep 1963 in Compton, CA-d. 26 Mar 1995 in Los Angeles, California of complications from A.I.D.S.)\n\n*Dr. Dre (b.

No cause of death given, but Jackson had been diagnosed with liver and brain cancer.)\n\n*Bobby Smith (B. 10 Apr in Ferndale, Michigan-D. 16 Mar 2013 in Orlando, Florida at the age of 76 from complications of pneumonia and influenza.)\n\n*Henry Fambrough (B. 10 May in Ferndale, Michigan)\n\n*Philippé Wynne (B. 03 Apr 1941 in Detroit, Michigan, D. 13 Jul 1984, Oakland, California at the age of 43 of a cardiac arrest; died on stage)\n\nGeorge Dixon (B. birthdate???, New Orleans, Louisiana)\n\nEdgar \"Chico\" Edwards (B. birthdate???, Ferndale, Michigan -- D. 03 Dec 2011, place of death??? Cause of death???)\n\nG.C. Cameron (B. 21 Sep 1945, Jackson, Mississippi)\n\nJohn Edwards (B. 25 Dec 1944, St. Louis, Missouri)\n\nNote: there is an argument as to whether the Spinners were really from Ferndale, or if they were actually from next door Royal Oak TownshipYes\n\n*Jon Anderson - vocals (b. 25 Oct 1944, Accrington, England)\n\n*Tony Kaye - keyboards (b. 08 Jul 1952, Leicester, England)\n\n*Peter Banks - guitar (b. 15 Jul 1947, Barnet, London, England-d. 07 Mar 2013, Barnet, London, England of heart failure)\n\n*Bill Bruford - drums (b. 17 May 1949, Sevenoaks, England)\n\n*Chris Squire - bass (b. 04 Mar 1948, Kingsbury, London, England-D. 27 Jun 2015, Phoenix, Arizona, of acute erythroid leukemia)\n\n*Steve Howe - guitar (b. 08 Apr 1947, Holloway, London, England)\n\n*Rick Wakeman - keyboards (b. 18 May 1949, Perivale, London, England)\n\n*Alan White - drums (b. 14 Jun 1949, Ferryhill, England)\n\nPatrick Moraz - keyboards (b. 24 Jun 1948, Morges, Switzerland)\n\nGeoff Downes - keyboards (b. 25 Aug 1952, Stockport, England)\n\nTrevor Horn - vocals (b. 15 Jul 1949, Durham, England)\n\nTrevor Rabin - guitar (b. 13 Jan 1954, Johannesburg, South Africa)\n\nBilly Sherwood - guitar/keyboards, bass (b. 14 Mar 1965, Las Vegas, Nevada)\n\nIgor Khoroshev - keyboards (b. 14 Jul 1965, Moscow, Russia)\n\nBenoit David - vocals (b. 18 Aug 1953, Montreal, Quebec, Canada)\n\nOliver Wakeman - keyboards (b. 26 Feb 1972, Gerrards Cross, England???)\n\nJon Davison - vocals (b. 16 Jan 1971, Laguna Beach, California)\n\nNote: I’m guessing the R&RHoF will only induct the first two lineups of Yes. However, my preference would be that they induct everyone down through Billy Sherwood. The late Chris Squire is on record as saying he would have preferred that everyone would be inducted.\n\nNext, by previous inductions. Clyde McPhatter was the first person to be inducted more than once into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as a soloist and as a member of the first incarnation of the Drifters. So, when someone is inducted more than once, we say he has joined the Clyde McPhatter club.\n\nThis year, we have two possible new members to the Clyde McPhatter Club. Depending on who the R&RHoF chooses to honor as the J.B.’s, Bobby Byrd, previously inducted with the Famous Flames, and Bootsy Collins, previously inducted with Parliament/Funkadelic, could both be inducted for a second time.\n\nNext, by race, depending on which members are inducted with the bands and groups:\n\nBlack: 6\n\nChic, Janet Jackson, the J.B.’s*, Chaka Khan, N.W.A, The Spinners\n\nNote: If Holly Ferris, who played on the last few James Brown hits from his heyday and the J.B.’s last 70s albums, as well as served as musical director for James Brown from 1986 on until Brown died, is inducted with the J.B.’s, the J.B.’s would technically move to the mixed race category.\n\nWhite: 7\n\nThe Cars, Cheap Trick, Deep Purple, Nine Inch Nails, Steve Miller, The Smiths, Yes\n\nMixed: 2\n\nChicago, Los Lobos\n\nNote: Chicago, normally considered white, has percussionist Laudir De Oliveira, and Los Lobos, normally considered Hispanic, has saxophonist Steve Berlin.\n\nNext, by gender, depending on which members are inducted with the bands and groups:\n\nMale: 85, although if they decide to induct the Steve Miller Band vice just Steve Miller, it could be as high as 98\n\nFemale: 5\n\nNext, by nationality based on place of birth, with the United States, Great Britain and Mexico further broken down by states/countries. This list includes every band and group member from above with an asterisk by their name:\n\nUnknown:\n\n19\n\nBrazil: 1\n\nMexico: 1\n\nSonora: 1\n\nUnited Kingdom: 19\n\nEngland: 17\n\nScotland: 1\n\nWales: 1\n\nUnited States, 52:\n\nAlabama: 1\n\nCalifornia: 11\n\nGeorgia: 4\n\nIllionis: 10\n\nIndiana: 2\n\nLouisiana: 1\n\nMaryland: 2\n\nMassachusetts: 1\n\nMichigan: 3\n\nMinnesota:

Radio Sessions, in which he revealed many of his frustrations with the induction process. A portion of the interview was posted on YouTube. Here is our transcript, lightly edited for clarity:\n\nLA Radio Sessions: Let’s talk a little about the procedure, because people forget from year to year. I hear all these wide accusations that it’s all a Rolling Stone magazine Hall of Fame and this and that.\n\nDave Marsh: I’ve been on the Nominating Committee for more than 20 years and Jann wouldn’t have me in the magazine if I had a gun to his head. And I probably wouldn’t be in the magazine if you had a gun to my head! There are a couple of people from Rolling Stone, as there should be, in every version of the Committee, which did change shape and get a little smaller this year.\n\nLA Radio Sessions: Can we talk about that at all?\n\nDave Marsh: There was a perception that it was too big and we were spending a lot of time just naming names and then voting on them and not having enough of a discussion. And the whole process… it’s actually... this is one of those moments where it’s unfair to a given individual who everybody, or almost everybody, slams all the time, because it was his perception. But that’s not anybody’s business outside of the Committee, so I can’t talk about it. I think that’s a broad enough hint. [Ed. Note: he is surely talking about Jann Wenner]\n\nWhether you want to go out to dinner with somebody or not is irrelevant if they perceive something and help you make it better. And this is a slightly different approach and I think it’s a much better ballot than the last couple of years. Last year had a very good result off a relatively weak ballot, I think. This year, it’s much more difficult for the voters to make a mistake. And before we go any farther, let me say this, ok? This is… this is a hard thing to say, because I have a real commitment to this institution. And I think it was a wise and important thing to create it. But. The fact of the matter is, it is the only hall of fame in the world that convenes a group of experts to make its ballot and then gives the voting over to people who know less than a smidgen as much as the people who are in that room. It’s an insipid process. It really is.\n\nThat’s not the first time a Nominating Committee member has criticized the choices of the Voters, the majority of whom are Hall of Famers. Marsh seems to think that this year’s ballot is deep enough that no matter who the voters choose, it will be a solid induction class.\n\nDave Marsh: The first Rock and Roll Hall of Fame classes, the first couple years, there were 10, 15 people that got in… What were you going to do, say “yes” to Chuck Berry and “no” to Buddy Holly? But it’s not like there isn’t still the wealth of… some of the people are more obscure and some of the people are more controversial... and keeping the tent as big as it needs to be is a continuing problem. But in the end, doing it five people a year is just completely frustrating. And it takes something that could be really, really great. And because they pay for the event with the TV show, I guess, I’ve never been able to figure it out on any other basis, that tail wags that dog every year.\n\nThis is a startlingly frank admission from a member of the Nominating Committee, acknowledging the influence the Rock Hall’s television partners (currently HBO) have over the process.\n\nDave Marsh: It’s kind of heartbreaking because… one of the things that happens is simple. People die. Darlene [Love] could have died without getting in the Hall of Fame. This has been such a holocaustal year for great musicians dying, that’s really foremost in my mind. Everybody is getting older. It’s not just those early British invasion bands who have turned 70, hell, the early British invasion bands are worrying about 80! It’s a few years off, but it’s going to happen. If you were born in ‘38 or ‘39 it’s gonna happen. Sam Moore will be 80 this year. So you’re going to start losing people that you shouldn’t lose without honoring them while they’re alive. And the longer you wait, the fewer people who actually remember how great something was.\n\nAnd I’ll just use, because they’re on the ballot, and because it’s been an ongoing conversation, and because it’s the strangest area where the Hall of Fame’s inductees are weak… is hard rock bands. And the notion that Deep Purple [Ed. Note: keyboardist Jon Lord died in 2012], who are a great band by any definition of rock and roll. They made record after record. I know I took them for granted for way too long. And there’s a bunch of people like that, whether it’s somebody whose style is pretty much forgotten and discarded, like Marc Bolan, who is not on the ballot, and to the best of my knowledge has never been on the ballot, but who was the spirit of rock and roll. I would say in historical terms, one of the luckiest things that ever happened to David Bowie was Marc Bolan’s car crash. I don’t mean that to say anything mean about David exactly, but Marc was just something extraordinarily special. And when you’ve got a process that won’t even let you get around to that fact, because there are other even bigger problems that have to be addressed... It’s frustrating. Not because anybody wants it to be frustrating.\n\nThen you got the whole problem… this is something for which radio needs to be taken to task, and particularly the genuinely evil Lee Abrams period. This continuing confusion about what the relationship between white rock and black rock ought to be, or is. And make no mistake, you have to talk about it like that, they have the same root. And they travelled at some points, and the paths have diverged quite extremely, and then again they always come back together. The musicians always know what the connection is. You never have any trouble explaining that to a musician, or at least not a musician who is worth talking to. So these are the all the limits within which that ballot got created.\n\nI say this partly because I’m tired of pretending a whole bunch of things… it’s the Cream magazine person in me that wants to say, hey, there’s right, there’s wrong. Yes, we will never agree with anything the way we all agreed on Elvis. Yes, the same thing should be true of James Brown, and it never will be. And that we need to reckon with. We also need to reckon with the fact that people think they know the history of rock and roll, and I will tell you right now, 750 people are going to get this ballot, there are not 750 people in the world, on the surface of the earth, who can adequately comprehend what has happened since 1955. It’s just simply, you know… God knows, if you stick me in with a bunch of electronic acts, or those brit-pop things from the Duran Duran period, or there’s all kinds of nooks and crannies or sometimes rivers, that missed me.\n\nLA Radio Sessions: Right, of course. Missed all of us.\n\nDave Marsh: I remember talking to Jon Landau, who is one of the original rock critics who is still alive that I’m closest to, and him saying to me at a certain point, “You know, it’s all going to be different now.” And we were up to about 1966 or 1967. And I thought about it as a person who didn’t much care for what came out of San Francisco, give or take Sly and Creedence. And yeah, it’s going to be different, we’re not going to agree the way we used to. And that’s what he was thinking about too. So when we talk, yes I’m on the Nominating Committee, no, I’m not a person who agrees with everything the Nominating Committee does, or with all the ways in which it’s compelled to do its job, but at the same time, I’m very proud to be part of it. And the institution, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is not a bad idea, it’s a very good one. Because somebody needs to do this. And we need always to be criticizing ourselves and each other and having people outside the process doing the same thing.\n\nThe only thing I can add to that is that I believe this to such a point that after about six months I realized that I should have been been supporting KISS getting into the Hall of Fame all along, for the simple reason that now all those idiots have to shut the f**k up about it. [laughter] I went, “Oh, really? This all dies down? I should have voted for them!”\n\nIt’s always fascinating when Nominating Committee members speak on the record about the induction process. It is nice to hear that they can be as frustrated with the system as their critics, but it also seems clear that any major changes will have to come from the top.\n\nShortly after voting began in the official 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Fan Poll, unusual voting patterns began to emerge. After just 48 hours of voting, the top five artists (Chicago, Yes, The Cars, Steve Miller and Deep Purple) had over 14 million votes each and had 86% of all votes. During the same time period, fellow classic rock nominee Cheap Trick could only garner 525,000 votes, just 0.64%, compared to the 17% each the leaders were receiving.\n\nTo get a sense of how real fans vote (this is the 10th year of our poll!), let’s look at some vote distributions from various internet polls where you can cast a ballot for multiple artists (all results as of 10/14/2015).\n\nFirst, the Future Rock Legends poll (5100 total votes, must vote for five artists):\n\nNext, the Cleveland.com poll (7277 total votes, can vote for up to eight artists):\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Poll (4920 total votes, can vote for up to six artists):\n\nAnd finally, the official Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Fan Poll (over 158 million total “votes,” can vote for up to five artists):\n\nRock Hall Museum President Greg Harris was touting last year’s record 59 million votes in the fan poll, which took two months. This year, they shattered that record in less than 48 hours, but examining the results, it’s not hard to wonder if there aren’t non-human hands at work. The Rock Hall failed once again to publish any rules about the poll, just urging people to “vote often.” Unfortunately, the one poll that is the easiest to game is the one that counts.\n\nOne of the reasons this is so outrageous is that there are a lot of real fans of the nominated artists who are spending a lot of time voting and urging others to vote. But they can’t compete with scripts that can cast one million votes per hour.\n\nThe Rock Hall needs to remove this poll, scrap the results, and replace it with one that is fair and secure. The first two years of the fan poll, the Rock Hall enlisted online poll professionals PollDaddy to host the poll. Beginning last year, they took the poll into their own hands which has led to nothing but erratic results (last year, Nine Inch Nails received 22% of the vote; this year, just 0.3%, which is strange to say the least).\n\nLet’s also not forget that the lack of rules with the fan poll is symptomatic of the induction process in general. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is the only major award that doesn’t use an independent accounting firm to tally the results from their voters.\n\nOn Friday, June 19th, Ed Christman from Billboard broke the story that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has let go many long-serving members of its Nominating Committee. So, what do we know so far?\n\nQ: How many people from the Nominating Committee were let go?\n\nA: The Billboard article’s headline says “at least 16 nominating members” were dismissed, but in the article, it is framed more as speculation from sources that “as many as 16 of the 42” members are gone. In the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Chuck Yarborough spoke to an ousted member who says the letter from Jon Landau stated the Rock Hall intended “to reduce the size of the committee by a third” to allow for “more flexibility in terms of discussion.” Reducing the Committee by a third would bring it down to about 28 members.\n\nQ: Who was let go?\n\nA: Billboard lists four names: “veteran A&R executive Joe McEwen, a blues and R&B expert; Greg Geller, a label executive specializing in reissues; Arthur Levy, a senior writer at a number of major record labels; and Bob Merlis, one of the industry's most renowned publicists who is now independent but was at Warner Bros. Records from the early 1970s through the 1990s.” Former L.A. Times critic Bob Hilburn confirmed on Twitter that he was dismissed as well. (Roger Friedman reports that Joe Levy was also let go, but it seems possible he mixed him up with Arthur Levy.)\n\nQ: Who is still on the Committee?\n\nThere are a lot of question marks here, but Billboard confirms that Landau, Questlove, Cliff Burnstein and Seymour Stein are still involved. It’s probably safe to assume that Museum president Greg Harris is still in. Robbie Robertson, Rick Krim, Paul Shaffer and Rob Light are all deeply involved in the Induction Ceremonies each year. Beyond that, it’s difficult to say. Hopefully more names will be confirmed soon. Here is a full list of Nominating Committee members over the last 30 years.\n\nQ: Why did the Rock Hall target the experts on the Early Rock and R&B Influencers subcommittee?\n\nA: Billboard frames a lot of their story around the idea that the Rock Hall “wiped out more than half of the Hall's Early Rock and R&B Influencers subcommittee.” It’s true that four of the seven members on that committee were let go, but that leaves at least 10 other members who were potentially on other subcommittees that are now gone too. As of five years ago, there were three subcommittees: one on progressive rock and heavy metal; one on hip-hop; and one on early rock and rollers and rhythm & blues.\n\nQ: So what does this mean for future ballots? Will early rock and R&B influencers be ignored?\n\nA: Anymore than they already are? At this point it’s impossible to say. McEwen, Geller, Levy and Merlis aren’t the only people well versed in those eras. All of them had been serving on the Nominating Committee for over 24 years. If their recommendations hadn’t been fully reflected on the ballot by now, perhaps it’s time for others to have a chance to sway the overall Committee. We have evidence in recent years that new members are more effective in getting artists onto the ballot.\n\nQ: Does this have anything to do with artists inducted as “Early Influences”?\n\nA: Not directly. Those artists are chosen by a separate committee. The Rock Hall hasn’t named a true “Early Influence” inductee since 2000. The three since then (Wanda Jackson, Freddie King and the “5’ Royales) were all artists who had been previously nominated on the Performer ballot.\n\nQ: Why did the Rock Hall let go of those specific people?\n\nA: Billboard: “But some Hall of Fame watchers worry that this latest move by Landau and Jann Wenner -- widely seen as the dominating figures in the Hall -- is meant to reduce the focus on the pioneers so that going forward the Hall can focus on artists who came to the fore in the 1980s and soon the 1990s, who might still have more cache with mainstream music fans and HBO, which broadcasts the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's show.”\n\nEver since HBO got involved, we have been speculating about how this may affect the inductions (more stars, bigger names).\n\nYarborough: “Is this really a move to get younger meat in the seats, or rather, younger rockphiles through the turnstiles, so to speak? Well, I believe it is, just by the evidence in our own back yard. . . What scares me is that it seems the history of rock 'n' roll is going to take a huge hit in exchange for pandering – yes, I said pandering – to the younger masses.”\n\nRoger Friedman believes Jann Wenner may move the eligibility date for artists down to 20 years: “Replacing nominators with younger people who have no attachment or feel for rock origins, and moving up the eligibility means Wenner can continue to skip over acts he doesn’t like and move on to more recent stars.” More Friedman: “There’s also a theory that Wenner will now try to force in groups like Journey or Kansas so that the HBO show turns into 80s nostalgia.” (C’mon Roger, Jann Wenner forcing in Journey and Kansas? Are you insane?)\n\nBefore removing his tweets, Rob Tannenbaum speculated that the Nominating Committee cuts were potentially in retaliation for members speaking to him for his recent Rock Hall story.\n\nSome less conspiratorial theories: Maybe these Nominating Committee members didn’t participate or couldn’t make it to the meetings. Maybe they pushed the same names year after year. Maybe they aren’t familiar with some of the more recently eligible artists.\n\nIs any of this true? At this point, we just don’t know. Perhaps Jon Landau will speak to Billboard as he promised on Friday.\n\nQ: Billboard, Yarborough and Friedman all paint this move as a negative for the Rock Hall. But is it really a bad thing to shuffle the deck once per decade?\n\nA: We have long been advocates of term limits for Nominating Committee members. Each person brings their own expertise and experience to the table, but after 10 years, it’s probably time to change the dynamic in the room. Hopefully Landau and Wenner invite new people to the meeting and don’t just try to lock it down to existing members. Ideally, this would create a ballot full of previously overlooked artists who had never had a chance to be inducted before.\n\nQ: Sound great, but will this really change anything?\n\nA: After the 2006 inductions, the Nominating Committee went from a bloated 72 members down to 31. So how did this affect the 2007 ballot? The biggest change was the number of nominees, which dropped to nine, down from sixteen.* But of the nine nominees in 2007, six had been nominated the previous year. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\n\nSo, when the nominees get announced in October, don’t expect a ballot full of Def Leppards, Weird Als and Grandfunk Railroads. Any changes will be gradual and cautious, just like they have always been.\n\n* - It would be interesting if the ballot contracts to only nine or ten names again to basically force the Voting Committee to induct who the Nominating Committee wants (*cough* Chic *cough*)."
