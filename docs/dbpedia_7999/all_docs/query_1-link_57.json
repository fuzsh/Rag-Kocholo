        "text": "Dive into a compelling discourse on the PBD Podcast where host Patrick Bet-David, together with guests Jeremy Boreing, Tom Ellsworth, and Vincent Oshana, dissects the expansive impact of media on society, from its role in normalizing social constructs to acting as a tool for political persuasion. With the backdrop of Boreing's latest film, \"Lady Ballers,\" the episode navigates the nuanced challenges that media producers face with controversial content, and critiques the recent corporate narrative shifts in giants like Disney, questioning the repercussions of moving away from their traditional roots.\n\nFurther enriching the conversation, the panel tackles the concept of 'zombie companies' and the economic domino effect of interest rates, while also delving into the societal ripples of national identity in an era of globalization, particularly through the lens of immigration and cultural heritage reclamation in countries like Hungary and Argentina. In closing, the episode bridges the complexities of moral leadership, the sanctity of personal values, and the importance of frank debate in an increasingly divided world, presenting a deep dive into the delicate balance between cultural preservation and the evolution of social norms. Join these thought leaders for a multifaceted exploration of how entertainment, business, and politics intersect to shape our collective future.\n\nBob Iger has had a long careerâ22 years at ABC, then 23 at Disney (after Disney acquired ABC). He started as a bottom-level crew member on television sets and eventually became CEO of Disney for 15 years. He led Disney through momentous changes in technology, global expansion, and its noted acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. He still looks back at his career in mild disbelief as an incredible, lucky ride of a lifetime.\n\nThis book is a retelling of his professional career, with his leadership principles woven in. Youâll learn why being an optimist is good for your career, how to take big risks, why you should always sweat the details, and how to fire someone respectfully.\n\nWhen Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar Animation Studios, started his career, he had one goal: Create films using computer-generated animation. Despite a multitude of challenges, Catmull worked tirelessly to advance the technology of computer animation and, eventually, co-founded Pixar to marry his love of animation with his expertise in computer technology.\n\nThrough the journey of Pixarâs creation, Catmull developed leadership strategies that fostered creativity in the workplace while ensuring that the company remained profitable and successful. In Creativity, Inc., Catmull breaks down the most important factors in building and sustaining a creative culture. From removing fear from failure and protecting new ideas, Catmull explains the ways Pixarâs creative culture allowed it to grow into the animation behemoth it is today.\n\nBob Iger has had a long careerâ22 years at ABC, then 23 at Disney (after Disney acquired ABC).
