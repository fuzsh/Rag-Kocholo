        "text": "YOUNG PEOPLE REGULARLY INHABIT THE UNREGULATED SPACE OF THE SCHOOL WASHROOM, which has consequences for their gendered subjectivities that often go unexamined. Asking students to express their experiences and understandings of what occurs in this gendered space is the first step to achieving gender justice in schools, or what Martino (2012) calls, \" a transgender imaginary \" , one that denaturalizes gender as derived from biological sex, and that honors the local and specific knowledge of \" 'sissy-boys', 'feminized fags', and gender-variant individuals \" and so on, to gain insight into \" the embodied experience and dynamics of gender expression \" (p. 223). A school that makes room for various gendered subjectivities and identities, that allows students to question the gender binary, is aligned with anti-transphobic and anti-oppressive pedagogies (Kumashiro, 2000). In this paper, I showcase and analyze students' photovoice projects commenting on the school washroom and other school spaces to access their subjugated knowledge (Foucault, 1980), those knowledges \" that have been disqualified as inadequate to their task or insufficiently elaborated: naïve knowledges, located low down on the hierarchy, beneath the required level of cognition or scientificity \" (p. 82). In pursuit of a socially just project, I access student voice through photovoice, which I conceive as having the possibility to be a queer (if not genderqueer) methodology because of its ability to destabilize \" the spaces it flags \" (Noble, 2005, p. 165). This paper will take the form of a photo essay derived from a larger project on secondary school students' understanding of gender expression and its intersections with the gendered and social space of the school washroom. The photographs are the works of two particular students under the pseudonyms, Callie E. and Trina D., who explicate their understandings of their school space through photovoice (Thomson & Gunter, 2007). Thematically, I divided the students' photographs into two categories according to both the photographic content, as well as the students' own explanations of their pictures. These categories are, light, or, what was visible, and dark, or, what was shadowed. Callie specifically stated that the light and the shadows were important to her; in her photography class held at the school, she had learned how to capitalize on these elements through the development process.\n\nThis article analyses five public consultation meetings about revisions to an LGBTQ-related school board policy on unceded Coast Salish territory in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. These meetings focused largely on the new provision that students in publicly funded schools be allowed to use the washroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Almost all of the objections to the policy revisions were articulated by parents of non-queer, or not openly queer students. We found that these parental concerns centred around two perennial issues in Canadian educational studies; namely, how schools regulate students’ gender identities and expressions, and the role of the state in publicly funded schooling. We conclude by drawing upon emerging literature on best practices for trans youth in schools to offer alternative visions for how these issues can be better addressed with the public, and parents in particular.\n\nIn this article, we explore power relations in space by examining how the intersections of gender and disability are discursively represented in washroom signage. To do so, we analyze various washroom signs found in public spaces and airports that the authors encountered in their travels in North America, Hawaii, and Europe and how they depict bodies in spaces, times, and contexts. We discuss dominant discursive representations of gender and disability in relation to constructions of family, caregiving roles, and cultural location. We argue that washroom signs constitute gendered and disabled subjects and mediate their subjectivities. Furthermore, they function to regulate bodies in space, influencing notions of who belongs, who belongs where, and how different bodies are de(valued).\n\nIn this paper we argue that school toilets function as one civilising site (Elias, 1978) in which children learn that disabled and queer bodies are out of place. This paper is the first to offer queer and crip perspectives on school toilets. The small body of existing school toilet literature generally works from a normative position which implicitly perpetuates dominant and oppressive ideals. We draw on data from Around the Toilet, a collaborative research project with queer, trans and disabled people (aroundthetoilet.wordpress.com) to critically interrogate this work. In doing this we consider 'toilet training' as a form of 'civilisation', that teaches lessons around identity, embodiment and ab/normal ways of being in the world. Furthermore, we show that 'toilet training' continues into adulthood, albeit in ways that are less easily identifiable than in the early years. We therefore call for a more critical, inclusive, and transformative approach to school toilet research.\n\nThis article offers a detailed analysis of two school board-level policies in British Columbia, Canada that address the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender, Two Spirit (LGBQ and TT) youth to demonstrate how the language of the policy holds meaning and re/produces particular knowledges. Rather than offer an analysis that sees ?at-risk? youth or LGBQ and TT issues ?as a problem to be solved?, this article proposes reading of the policies and the youth who are the subjects of these policies as complex and exceeding the identities that the policy constructs for them. Drawing upon Bacchi, Foucault and Butler, this article frames an analysis of the value and limits of policy geared toward LGBQ and TT as problematization, where identities are explored as contradictory and produced through the manner in which the policies are constituted. The article suggests ways in which queer theory offers a questioning of normativities that is beneficial to policy analysis.\n\nBased on interview data garnered from two transgender university students (transman and transwoman) and a reflexive narrative analysis, this research found that some transgender students experience overt forms of gender discrimination, violence, and stigma on campus spaces. Particularly troubling are the inadequate athletic facilities, social organizations, and counselling resources available to trans students. There is a need to have more readily available staff members educated on trans needs and human rights. That said, some narratives emphasize the activist and resilient roles some trans students undertake to make campuses a safer and more gender-inclusive space for trans and cisgender communities. Given the small sample size, the goal of this paper is to raise larger awareness toward the social issues present amongst transgender students, and emphasize the need for further research on gender diversity, marginalization, stigma, and best practices within campus spaces.\n\nThis paper offers a critical analysis of Adam, a female-to-male transgender character on the Canadian television show Degrassi. I critique the hegemonic discourse of being ‘born in the wrong body,’ a narrative that is represented as the trans experience. Through a close reading of Adam, I provide a critical analysis of the shortcomings and restrictions of transnormativity. I argue Adam is normalized as the ‘right’ kind of trans person through medical discourses of transition and his adherence to social norms of masculinity, heterosexuality, Christian morality, class, whiteness and ability. While this narrative affords Adam certain privileges and a sense of belonging within the plot of Degrassi, as a representation, it contributes to the further disenfranchisement of trans persons of colour, working-class trans persons, trans persons with disabilities, and gender-nonconforming persons."
