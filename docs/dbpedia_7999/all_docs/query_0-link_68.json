        "text": "Melanie Stewart October 26th, 2022 - 4:00 PM\n\nSanta isn’t the only one who is going to SLEIGH this December! Check out Deadmau5 at Story Nightclub on December 4th.\n\nJoel Zimmerman was born in Niagara Falls, January 5th, 1981. He rose to fame in 2008 when his song “Faxing Berlin” found its way onto the playlist of DJ/producer Pete Tong‘s radio show. Deadmau5 soon became a leading figure in progressive house music.\n\nCanadian electronic music producer and Mau5trap label head Deadmau5 is one of the most prominent figures in the contemporary dance scene. He is similarly instantly recognizable with his helmet costume just like Marshmello and Daft Punk. At the launch of his career in the late 2000s, he went worldwide with 2009’s For Lack of a Better Name. As time went on, he held out as a Top Ten fixture on the U.S. and Canadian Dance charts, going platinum in 2010 with 4×4=12 and chart topping three times in a row with Album Title Goes Here (2012), While (1<2) (2014) and W:/2016ALBUM/ (2016). Deadmau5 is also a gamer and contributed to the popular soundtracks of Grand Theft Auto, Need for Speed and further.\n\nIn 2020, Zimmerman shortened his works, Mau5ville: Level Complete, into a singular work. In that same year, he dropped “Bridged by a Lightwave,” in collaboration with another Canadian artist Kiesza.\n\nFind your tickets here: https://www.tixr.com/groups/story/events/deadmau5-53907\n\nLocation: Story\n\nAddress: 136 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139\n\nShow Time: 11:00 p.m.\n\nTicket Price: $50 (GA), $1,500-$6,000 (VIP+)\n\nAge: 21+\n\nLive Photo Credit: Mehreen Rizvi"
