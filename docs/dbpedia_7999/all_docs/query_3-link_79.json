        "text": "Early Years: 2006-2008\n\nJoel Zimmerman was born on January 5th 1981 and grew up in Naigara Falls, Ontario in Canada. Obsessed with computers as a child he progressed to working in local studios, co-producing local radio show ‘The Party Revolution’ and contributing to the 1999 rap metal album of Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee.\n\nHis first release was an electro house track in 2006 with Steve Duda entitled ‘This Is The Hook’ under the alias B.S.O.D. (Blue Screen Of Death). Although the track was intended to ridicule the formulaic tendencies of mainstream house, featuring a synthesized voice announcing each component of the track, it proved to be an unexpected success. ‘This Is The Hook’ went to number one in the Beatport download charts and even resulted in B.S.O.D. remixing a Christine Aguilera track.\n\nDuring this early stage of his career Zimmerman continued to utilize his tech skills, working for music software company Image Line (now FL Studios) and set up his own web developer company that he called Deadmau5. He had come up with the name after finding the body of a mouse that had crawled into one of his computers and had died. He abbreviated it from ‘dead mouse’ to Deadmau5 for use as a log in for an online chat username.\n\nIn 2006 he started producing his first solo tracks released as Deadmau5: ‘Cocktail Queen’ and ‘Faxing Berlin’. ‘Faxing Berlin’ (which would be re-released in 2009 and enjoy significant success).\n\nThe two tracks gave an early indication of the wide range of styles that Zimmerman would build his Deadma5 career upon. ‘Cocktail Queen’ shows his upfront house side, with pounding kick drum and snare underpinning a fierce analogue bass riff. ‘Faxing Berlin’ is more understated and melodic and feels more like a trance track than it does house. Zimmerman’s ability to straddle the house and trance genres - whilst also often incorporating techno elements – have been key to his success, with his tracks just as home in the set of a big room trance DJ as that of an underground house DJ.\n\nThough Zimmerman returned to his BSOD collaboration with Duda in 2007 for a number of releases the momentum of his Deadmau5 alias soon took hold. ‘Faxing Berlin’ had - via DJ Chris Lake - arrived on the desk of Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong and who promptly played it on his show and helped propel it into being one of the big dance tracks of the year. In July of the same year Zimmerman set up his mau5trap label.\n\nBy 2008 the momentum really began to build, seeing Deadmau5 enter the DJ Magazine readers’ top 100 poll at #11 and become the most awarded artist at the Beatport Awards. 2008 also saw Deadmau5 record a BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix and release no less than 28 tracks plus numerous remixes. The releases were typically diverse, ranking from the up front electro of ‘Dr Funkenstein’ through the big room party house of ‘Hi Friend’ to the blissed-out tech house of ‘I Remember’ with Kaskade. Also in 2008 Zimmerman hooked up again with Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee as part of the electro four piece outfit WTF?\n\nLater Years: 2009 to Present"
