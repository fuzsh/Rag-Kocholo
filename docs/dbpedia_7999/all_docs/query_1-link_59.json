        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nScript written by David MacIntyre.\n\nBorn January 5, 1981, in Toronto, Ontario, Joel Zimmerman, more well known as deadmau5, has made a name for himself in the electronic dance music scene for his progressive house sound. As a producer, he's worked with many different artists but he has also found success with his own music. For this list, we've chosen our entries based on a combination of the artist's fan favorites and their most commercially successful songs. We've narrowed it down to the best songs that Deadmau5 has produced for his own records or as standalone singles, as opposed to songs he has produced for other artists or remixes he's done of other artists' songs. Welcome to WatchMojo.com, and today we're counting down our picks for the top 10 Deadmau5 songs.\n\nSpecial thanks to our users meneertje25, Ren√© van Gool, aldqbigsquare, reneetjuh21, James Benbow, Josias Rodrigues, Ridinspinaz04, Alfonze1, Kenny Gumbs, and malloy for submitting the idea on our Suggest Page at WatchMojo.comsuggest read more..."
