In the UK she retained her record for the most number-one singles for a female artist; \"4 Minutes\" becoming her thirteenth. At the 23rd Japan Gold Disc Awards, Madonna received her fifth Artist of the Year trophy from Recording Industry Association of Japan, the most for any artist. To further promote the album, Madonna embarked on the Sticky & Sweet Tour; her first major venture with Live Nation. With a gross of $280 million, it became the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist then, surpassing the previous record Madonna set with the Confessions Tour; it was later surpassed by Roger Waters' The Wall Live.

This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: \"Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity.\" İnalcık also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. Hence, this reveals that similar to today's modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and that the world was more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of \"schooling\" was also similar to today's modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by Mehmed the Conqueror. He built eight madaris that were built \"on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these.\" The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.\n\nquestion: Who traveled abroad to get an education at madaris?, answer: Ottomans | question: How many madaris were started by Mehmed the Conqueror?, answer: eight | question: How would a student matriculate to the next level of schooling in the Ottoman Empire?, answer: complete the classes in the lower one | question: Where were Ottoman madaris built?, answer: near mosques | question: When was the first Ottoman madrasa built?, answer: 1331\n\n[ \"messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness\", \"subconsciousness\", \"mental\", \"physicist\", \"mind\" ]\n\n[ \"How do receive information from the physical world?\", \"What type of consciousness is similar but not identical to consciousness itself?\", \"What is the nature of the fundamental character of reality?\", \"According to the author, who would have particular trouble in accepting that reality is fundamentally mental?\", \"What is the main thing that we experience?\" ]\n\n\"The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds....

The claimed losses were 4000 Turks and 400 Russians. 3. In the south about 30000 Turks slowly moved east to the main Russian concentration at Gyumri or Alexandropol (November).

The Turks failed to press their advantage, the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks retired west. Orbeliani lost about 1000 men out of 5000.
