Competition Archery Media did a podcast with Justin Huish, the only U.S. archer in history to win two gold medals at a single Olympics.

Huish won the men’s individual gold and was part of the men’s team that won gold, both at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Ga.

In the podcast with CAM, Huish talks about his rise to the top of the archery world. He also talks for the first time to a media outlet about his famous fall from that peak.

Huish quit the 2000 U.S. Olympic team after he was arrested in California for possession of marijuana for sale.

He talks about the freak injury that preceded his arrest and his subsequent attempts to make a comeback, which extend to today. Huish finished 11th at the 2020 USA Archery Target Nationals and fifth at the 2020 U.S. Open in August.
