        "text": "Movie star Geena Davis flubbed her latest “shoot” yesterday – losing her bid to make the Olympic archery team after low scores at semifinal competitions in New Jersey.\n\nStill, the plucky actress is unbowed by defeat.\n\n“My goal from the beginning – and it continues to be – is just to see how good I can get,” said Davis, 43.\n\n“So I’ll just keep flinging arrows.”\n\nDavis placed 24th out of 28 woman archers competing at Brookdale Park in Bloomfield, N.J. She needed to place at least 16th to continue competing in the semis.\n\nUltimately, only three women will win a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.\n\n“I’m completely exhausted,” Davis admitted at day’s end, noting she’d been on an eight-hour-a-day training schedule.\n\n“I’m going to sleep for two days,” she said, laughing.\n\nBut while she’d prepared well for competition, she admitted she was unprepared for the crowd of media who huddled in yesterday’s drizzle to watch her shoot.\n\n“It was like being at a premiere,” she quipped.\n\nThe star of “Thelma and Louise” and “The Accidental Tourist” – for which she won an Oscar in 1988 – took up archery two years ago, inspired by watching Justin Huish win two gold medals at the 1996 Olympics.\n\nDavis will train next to qualify for the world archery championships, to be held in Beijing in 2001, said Don Rabska, who has also coached actor-archer Paul Sorvino and former Yankee Goose Gossage."
