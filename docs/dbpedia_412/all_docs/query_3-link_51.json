        "text": "Richard“Butch”Johnson is not a man who seeks headlines, but every four years, he seems to find them.\n\nJohnson, 52, is in Beijing, getting ready to compete in his fifth Olympic Games as a member of the U.S archery team.\n\nAlthough a man of few words, Johnson talked about his Olympic experiences recently at his home in Woodstock.\n\nQ What got you into archery?\n\nA I always had a fascination with it and there was a shop that opened up in Webster, Mass. My brother-in-law went there and I went with him. I had these little fiberglass piece-of-junk bows that you couldn’t hit anything with before that. But I got down there and enjoyed the challenge. I was 15.\n\nQ When did you know the Olympics were in your future?\n\nA I guess it was in 1992. I had been shooting compounds (bows) as opposed to the regular re-curve style. I just decided to go to the (Olympic) trials with no expectation of making the team. I was just there to try it, see if I liked it and consider doing more of it. Next thing you know, I was on the team. I surprised everyone, especially myself.\n\nQ It sounds easy, how difficult is it?\n\nA Very. Anybody can shoot an arrow, but there’s a lot of factors. Shooting 77 yards (70 meters), a lot of factors come into play — wind, lighting, everything. (You’re) aiming at a 4-inch circle at 77 yards. It doesn’t take much to miss it.\n\nQ How much practice does it take? A Year round, I probably average about two hours a day on an off-year. This being an Olympic year, I’m probably shooting 4 to 6 hours per day. You get a little burned out. In the fall, you hang up the bow, maybe do a little bow-hunting, and just chill out.\n\nQ Let’s talk about your Olympic experiences, how about 1992 (Barcelona)?\n\nA I was like a fish out of water. It was a whole learning experience. I enjoyed it a lot, but I went back to (compound-style) shooting for a year after it until I decided I wanted to try and get a medal. It was a humbling experience. I did well enough to make the team, but I finished around 20th.\n\nQ Atlanta, 1996?\n\nA It was pretty exciting, especially being the home country. Fans were going crazy (as Johnson and his teammates, Justin Huish and Rod White, took home a team gold medal in archery). It was probably the most memorable day of my life. Individually, I was about 18th, I lost to one of the top Korean guys, but I shot extremely well in the team round.\n\nQ Did you have a lot of fun at the Atlanta Olympics?\n\nA We definitely had our fun. It’s a lot better in your own country. You feel more at home, you can read the signs, talk to people (laughs) and that helps. China… it’s kind of scratch your head and point.”\n\nQ Sydney, 2000?\n\nA It was kind of scary, because it was extremely windy. The winds were terrible and made it difficult. We finished with a team bronze and I placed around 20th individually.”\n\nQ 2004, Greece?\n\nA Forget that one. That was a nightmare. The stadium was beautiful, but it wasn’t good for archery. They have a seasonal wind that comes through, and in the individual competition, we probably had 30-40 mph winds. The stadium was like a horseshoe and the wind was hitting you from the right and left. It was bouncing around. World-class archers, who never miss a target, missing frequently — it was a joke.\n\nQ What do you look forward to in Beijing?\n\nA The world’s getting better, there are countries that four years ago weren’t a threat that are now very good. We have, very possibly, the strongest (archery) team we ever had. I feel really positive about getting a medal.\n\nQ Do you want to do better individually?\n\nA Absolutely. Team-wise, I’m doing good enough, I’m not happy right now with some things that I’m doing. I’m making some small, minor adjustments in the equipment and trying to play with it, to get those few extra points and make myself competitive. You hope to be on top of your game, you tailor your training to peak at that time, but you never know.\n\nQ You were in Beijing last year, shooting in the stadium you will compete in for the Olympics. How does it look?\n\nA The stadium is very impressive, probably the nicest we’ve had. There’s a beautiful metal roof with the shooting line out of the sun. They’ve done a lot of work and were quite ready last August already.\n\nQ It’s a communist country. Was there any tension?\n\nA No. People were extremely nice. They had helpers everywhere running around in orange shirts. If you had a question, you get them, and they found someone who spoke English. Except for the weather, I’m looking forward to it. It’s very hot and humid and, hopefully, they cut down on the pollution. A lot of people walk around with respirators on.\n\nQ Will you try again in 2012?\n\nA Very possibly, as long as I don’t get too burned out. Why not, I’ll try out. If I don’t make it, I had a good run.\n\nQ Are you satisfied with your career?\n\nA You always want the individual Olympic medal, but so do 63 other people, and they’re all good. I’m happy to have a couple of medals now and, hopefully, I will come back with a couple more."
