        "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO – One arrow – one measly arrow from 70 meters – separated Brady Ellison from a likely Olympic archery gold medal Friday.\n\nStill, the 27-year-old Arizona native living in Globe rebounded from a shootout loss in the semifinal to win an individual bronze medal, the first of his three Olympic career. He is the first American to win an individual medal since Vic Wunderle, who took silver in 2000, and the first with Arizona ties to do so since Justin Huish’s gold in 1996.\n\nOh, and he did it all after dislocating his kneecap Wednesday.\n\n“I’ve had problems with my left knee since 2011 when I blew it out the first time,” said Ellison, explaining that he slipped on the linoleum floor in his room at the Athletes Village, hurting himself as he tried to avoid falling.\n\n“I’m all taped up and got it stabilized, and we did it. If you saw me out there balancing on one leg, I was trying my glute and my quads to fire, trying to get my subconscious to trust that leg again. (Thursday) was hard to adjust. Today was a lot better. The doc (Kevin Pierce) helped me out a tremendous amount.”\n\nBICKLEY: Phelps an enormous boost to Phoenix\n\nEllison already was through to the round of 16 going into Friday, his deepest Olympic individual run. He edged his U.S. teammate Zach Garrett 6-4 then beat Japan’s Takaharu Furukawa 6-2 to move into the semifinals against South Korea’s Ku Bonchan.\n\nSouth Korea won the team gold but its top archer, world No. 1-ranked Kim Woojin, lost in the second round of individual eliminations and Lee Seungyun in the quarterfinals. That left Ku, who shot a 10 in a one-arrow shootout to beat Australian Taylor Worth and advance to face Ellison.\n\nAgain, it would come down to a shootout after the archers stood even 5-5 after five sets of three arrows each. Ellison, shooting first on perhaps the most important arrow of his career, scored eight. Ku was closer to center with a nine.\n\n“It was a little bit windy,” Ellison said. “I shot a bad shot and left the door wide open for him.”\n\nBOIVIN: On sexism, TV coverage at Rio Games\n\nAdmitting later that the shootout rattled him and made him angry, Ellison had two bad-for-him sets in the bronze medal match before shooting three 10s in the third set on the way to 6-2 win over Sjef van den Berg of the Netherlands. Ku won gold 7-3 over France’s Jean-Charles Valladont.\n\nThat gave Ellison his third Olympic bronze, the others in team, at what he said is only the halfway point (10 years) of his elite career. If so, he could have two more Olympic chances to improve on third place, but at least his trophy case now is complete with an individual medal from all major competitions.\n\n“It was hard” coming back after the shootout, Ellison said. “My first two ends sucked because of it. I walked back after shooting a 26 (in the second set) and I told coach I need to get my head back into this match and quit focusing on the last one, then stepped up and shot 30.”\n\nOn that bad knee.\n\nOlympic archery medalists with Arizona ties\n\n1984 (Los Angeles): Rick McKinney (U.S., individual silver medal).\n\n1988 (Seoul): Jay Barrs (U.S., individual gold/team silver), Rick McKinney (U.S., team silver), Debra Ochs (U.S., team bronze).\n\n1996 (Atlanta): Justin Huish (U.S., individual gold/team gold).\n\n2004 (Athens): Alison Williamson (Great Britain, individual bronze).\n\n2012 (London): Brady Ellison (U.S., team bronze)\n\n2016 (Rio): Brady Ellilson (U.S., individual bronze/team bronze)."
