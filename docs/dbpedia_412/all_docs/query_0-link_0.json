        "text": "Justin Huish was one of the unlikely stars of the 1996 Olympics. A young competitor (21) in an unknown sport, nobody expected big results from him. His only significant victories at the senior level had come at the 1993 US collegiate championships (not a varsity sport), and the 1995 US Target Championships, and he had only been on the US National Team since 1994. With his baggy pants, backwards cap, sun glasses and ponytail, the laidback youngster defeated all opposition in Atlanta to win gold medals in both the individual and team competitions. This led to a minor popularity boost for the sport â€“ actress Geena Davis picked up the sport and competed in the Olympic Trials for Sydney. But Huish dealt with other issues at that time. Although still competing, in February 2000 he was arrested for the sale and possesion of marijuana to a police informant. Huish resigned his spot on the national team, pleaded \"no contest\" and was sentenced to 120 days in prison. After he was released, Huish attempted to qualify for the Olympics in 2004, but failed."
