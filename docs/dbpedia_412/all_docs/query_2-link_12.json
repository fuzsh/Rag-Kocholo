        "text": "Archery\n\nIf American archery someday emerges as a world power, Thursday could be looked upon as the day the sport became cool.\n\nIt was the day Justin Huish gave the little-exposed game a shot square in the bull’s eye - ‘90s style.\n\nRegardless of its future, archery ushered in an enticing new ambassador.\n\nHuish, the 21-year-old ponytailed, backward-cap-wearing Simi Valley, Calif., resident became Andre Agassi Thursday. He became Michael Jordan.\n\nArchery has a new hero. A gold-medal-wearing hipster who had an overflow crowd on its feet, and many in tears, as he encouraged them via waving arms to cheer him to an eventual easy win in the gold-medal match of the men’s individual tournament.\n\nAt the forefront of Huish’s fan club: 21 family members who often led the more the 5,400 fans in a wave.\n\nIt was archery brought to you by MTV.\n\nDrained from his 8-hour day - in which he won four matches in hot, sometimes rainy weather - Huish was awash in shock minutes after winning the top prize.\n\n“Man, this thing is heavy,” said Huish, who because of his long sideburns, baggy shorts and sunglasses would be pegged by most as a college student rather than an Olympic gold medalist.\n\nHuish is the first U.S. male to win archery gold since Jay Barrs did it in Seoul in 1988."
