The duo was well-matched with Frederick winning 6-4. Frederick had defeated Akshara Vijay in the semi-finals 7-1. Vijay advanced to take the bronze 7-3 in her match against Savannah Vanderweir.\n\nNicholas D’Amour shot an impressive gold medal match against second-seed Brady Ellison. The St. Thomas native only dropped a single nine over three sets to win 6-0. D’Amour faced Olympic gold medalist Justin Huish in the semi-finals where Huish had a strong start, but then lost 4-6. Huish went on to win bronze, marking his first national podium finish since returning to the sport three years ago.\n\nThe compound men’s bracket featured a number of close matches from the quarter-finals to the gold medal match-up between James Lutz and Sawyer Sullivan. The finals came down to a single point difference after the duo shot perfect 30s closing things out with Lutz winning 148-147. With a solid third-seed qualification, Kris Schaff locked up the bronze.\n\nToja Ellison, the top-seeded compound woman, brought the gold home after a 145-144 win over Paige Pearce.
