This time I think you're\n\nway out of line. You not only don't know his equipment, you don't know Justin\n\nHuish. Your geographic proximity isn't helping either. My experience with\n\nJustin stretches over 9 years and I have NEVER seem him do ANYTHING to justify\n\nyour attack. Do I think he's God's gift to archery ? No, but I have NEVER\n\nseen him exhibit excessive ego or an \"ugly american\" attitude. How many trips\n\nhave YOU taken with Justin ? How many times have YOU shot with him ? What's\n\nyour problem ? What did he do to embarass YOU ? Win the Olympic Games ? Show\n\ntotal courtesy to his competitors ? Yeah he did that. Sorry you were\n\nembarassed. Run a victory lap after winning the Gold Medal ? Yeah, he did that\n\ntoo. Sign autographs for every kid in reach ? Spend time in the stands with\n\nthe spectators ? Put his TWO gold medals around ANYONE's neck that wanted to\n\ntry 'em on ? Promote youth archery ? Yeah he did that too. Sorry you're\n\nembarassed. Meanwhile he'll go on promoting archery, helping grow the sport\n\nand occasionally kicking my ass in competition. Too bad you're embarassed\n\nabout it.\n\nRonny Yurong wrote:\n\n> go get your attitude adjusted, nobody deserve what you have said about\n\n> JUSTIN, especially when you cannot beat him in archery,\n\nWhether the previous poster can beat him in archery, or anything else,\n\nis completely beside the point.\n\nI had read that Justin Huish is a bit on the energetic, flamboyant side\n\n(...for an archer, perhaps).

If you get to know these folks a little better you\n\nrealize that they are generally great people.\n\nPerhaps this is what is happening with Justin Huish.\n\nThe shot through the garage and such was pretty clearly a publicity\n\nthing. It would be stupid to do this on a routine basis, it just isn't\n\nsafe.\n\nIt's especially stupid since there are places to shoot in California.\n\nYou might have to drive for a while, but folks in California are used\n\nto driving.\n\nMarty Sasaki\n\nKen Laux wrote:\n\n> Whether the previous poster can beat him in archery, or anything else,\n\n> is completely beside the point.\n\nThanks you..\n\n> I had read that Justin Huish is a bit on the energetic, flamboyant side\n\n> (...for an archer, perhaps).

To me that is a\n\nterrible lack of sportsmanship. Then of course, you could run over to\n\nhis shop(the one his parents opened to support his hobby) and check it\n\nout for yourselves.\n\n> ...one thing I do know, though: I don't want to live next door to a guy\n\n> who shoots arrows through his garage at a target across the street!

He shoot from across the street,\n\ninto and through his garage. Must have been a scary time in Simi Valley.\n\nI know in my town (Sunland,CA, just minutes from his) this would not be\n\nallowed under any circumstance\n\nJust my opinion\n\nî—“\n\n<< From: William Pearson <buff...@jps.net>\n\nDate: Thu, 03 June 1999 02:28 PM EDT\n\nMessage-id: <3756C961...@jps.net>\n\n>>\n\n<< While I don't know his equipment, I do know what part of his makeup you\n\nDO NOT want.

I have found out that he always\n\nhas been preoccupied with schedules, personnal committments, and with whatever\n\nit took for him to stay focused. I have found that with a little patience for\n\nhim to adjust his focus from what he is doing at the moment you aproach him to\n\nfocus then to your meeting is rewarding. He has posed for photos, joked about\n\nmy daughter to me, and never ignored a request that was waited for.\n\nRemember just being preoccupied is not a measure of his attitude.\n\nAnthony Moscarelli"
