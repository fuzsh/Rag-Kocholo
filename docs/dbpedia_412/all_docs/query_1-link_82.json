        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS — A potential Hollywood movie exists somewhere on the U.S. archery team. The men are ranked No. 1 in the world. So is Brady Ellison, a self-proclaimed “country boy” from Arizona who overcame leg braces as a child to become a possible Olympic gold medal winner. USA Archery could hand the screenplay to Hollywood.\n\nAfter all, it owes it one.\n\n“The Hunger Games,” Suzanne Collins’ runaway hit about a teenage girl who survives a post-apocalyptic game of life and death with a bow and arrow, has made archery hip. The U.S. Olympic Archery Trials began Saturday at the Grace Center for Athletics and Community Service with a few dozen fans in attendance.\n\nBut underneath the most important competition on U.S. soil this year is a sport that is exploding like Collins’ books sales.\n\n“It’s been crazy, to be honest,” USA Archery CEO Denise Parker said. “Our clubs are literally being overrun.”\n\nFor the first time, USA Archery’s under-20 group has more competition members than over 20 with the largest age group 15-17. Two years ago, USA Archery’s website averaged 14,277 visitors per month.\n\nIn March it had 30,585.\n\nThe Twitter account @USArchery had 675 followers in 2010. Today it has 2,912. Its number of Facebook fans has jumped from 1,700 two years ago to more than 5,800.\n\n“It’s funny because we used to have issues,” Parker said. “OK, how do you get clubs to promote their programs and get people to come in? Now, the clubs are saying, ‘We’re good. We’re full. How do we develop more clubs to accommodate all the kids coming in, especially young girls?’\n\n“It’s amazing the impact a Hollywood movie can make.”\n\nArchery has had PR hits before. “Rambo” helped in the early ’80s, but USA Archery didn’t need to target bitter Vietnam vets. “The Hunger Games” has produced about $400 million and has nearly every teenager in America eager to shoot arrows and be a hero, or heroine.\n\nUSA Archery had a hand in it, too. Khatuna Lorig, seeking her fourth Olympic team, gave star Jennifer Lawrence 15 archery lessons in spring 2011.\n\n“For archery it’s great,” said Lorig, in second place with 94.5 points behind Miranda Leek’s 97.75. “It’s a unique sport, an awesome sport, a very old sport. I think it deserves this big break, thanks to ‘The Hunger Games.’ “\n\nHowever, every aspiring young archer will get a quick reality check. They can rent cheap equipment at clubs, but if they show promise, a big-time bow will cost about $2,000. Colleges do not have archery scholarships.\n\nBut when’s the last time Hollywood had a hit movie about a basketball player?\n\n“I’ve had very few kids who walked away and didn’t say, ‘Oh, that was so cool!’ ” Parker said.\n\nFor USA Archery, the timing couldn’t be better. Ellison, 23, has helped make archery one of the potential breakout sports for the entire U.S. Olympic Team. The U.S. hasn’t won an Olympic medal since a men’s team bronze in 2000. The women last won in 1988 with a team bronze.\n\nJustin Huish was the last gold medalist in 1996.\n\nThe big improvement started in 2006 when the USOC started a national training center in Chula Vista, Calif. Ten of the 16 competitors at the Trials train together in Chula Vista.\n\n“Individualized training, at some point it’s good but you can’t have much competitiveness,” said U.S. coach Kisik Lee, hired in 2006 after coaching Australia through two Olympics and 16 years coaching the strong South Korean team. “We’re staying together and sleeping together and every day they’re competing against each other. They make themselves more hungry, more strong.”\n\nEllison won bronze at last year’s World Championships, and his international events have placed him No. 1 in the world. In two years, the U.S. women have jumped from 14th to seventh.\n\nParker, a three-time Olympian and a team bronze medalist in ’88, remembers training in Salt Lake City and traveling every three months to train under her coach in Indiana.\n\n“What’s really neat to see is somebody like Brady,” she said. “He broke out. He’s the first one who started winning internationally. When all the other athletes see somebody under the same training situation and same coach, they see that we are capable. That’s a huge mental hurdle.”\n\nAs expected, Ellison leads the men’s competition with 112.00 with Jake Kaminski at 102.00 and Joe Fanchin at 83.25. In the women, Jennifer Nichols holds the important third and last spot with 89 points with Heather Koehl in fourth with 84.75.\n\nToday’s competition begins at 9 a.m. with four round-robin matches and three more at 1:30 p.m. with points compiled for each win and bonus points for their three-arrow score average. The top scoring three men and women will go to London.\n\nJohn Henderson: 303-954-1299, jhenderson@denverpost.com, twitter.com/johnhendersonDP\n\nPotential breakout Olympic sports for the U.S.\n\nArchery\n\nMen ranked No. 1 and so is Brady Ellison, the World Championship bronze medalist. U.S. men haven’t medaled since team bronze in 2000, and an individual hasn’t since Vic Wunderle won silver in 2000.\n\nDiving\n\nThe U.S. hasn’t won a medal since 2000, but Troy Dumais could break that streak in his fourth Olympics. He won two silvers in the 2009 World Championships in Rome, and David Boudia is ranked second in the world in platform.\n\nFencing\n\nMariel Zagunis won gold at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, and she’s been better since. She won world titles in 2005, 2009 and 2010, and 21-year-old Daryl Homer is ranked No. 1 in saber."
