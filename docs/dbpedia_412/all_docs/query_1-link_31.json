He is now ranked No. 2 in the world behind Marcus D'Almeida of Brazil.\n\nKaufhold, 20, made her second Olympic team.

Justin Huish, a ponytailed, backwards-cap wearing phenom, swept individual and team titles.\n\nHuish, now 49 years old, competed at the trials for Paris and was eliminated before the final stage.\n\nU.S. athletes qualified for 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nThe 2024 U.S. Olympic team roster of athletes updated as they qualify.\n\nOlympicTalk,"
