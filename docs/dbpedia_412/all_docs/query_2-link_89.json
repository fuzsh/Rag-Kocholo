        "text": "BLOOMFIELD, N.J. -- Geena Davis already has an Oscar. Now she's shooting for a medal.\n\nThe 43-year-old actress, who took up archery two years ago after watching the Olympics on television, is ranked 22nd in the nation and is competing this weekend to qualify for the next Olympic team.\n\n\"I have learned as an adult that I'm fairly athletic,\" said Davis, a 1974 Wareham High School graduate, yesterday, the day before the semifinals of the U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nThe star of \"Thelma and Louise\" and \"The Accidental Tourist\" -- for which she won an Oscar in 1988 -- has surprised archers with her quick rise in a sport that doesn't normally capture the kind of attention it got yesterday.\n\nCamera crews surrounded Davis, wearing a floppy blue hat and sunglasses, as she calmly fired off 60 arrows in Brookdale Park to a target 70 meters away. Her coach, Don Rabska, said she had to work to distinguish the clicking sound her bow made from the clicking cameras.\n\n\"If she would make the team, it would be unbelievable for our sport,\" said Denise Parker, the top-ranked woman in the nation. \"The question is, does she want to be in the spotlight in this environment?\"\n\nDavis had kept her hobby a secret from Hollywood and the public for two years, despite winning a tournament or two, until she finished 29th out of 300 women in Ohio to qualify for the Olympic semifinals. Four of the 32 semifinalists dropped out, making Davis one of 28 competing today.\n\nThat number will drop by Monday to eight, who will compete next month in California for three team spots and one alternate spot at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.\n\nMany called Davis' chances slim at best to become an Olympian, saying she is competing against higher-ranked archers who have trained more than twice as long.\n\nBut Justin Huish, a 1996 Olympic gold medalist, said yesterday, \"I wouldn't be surprised one bit if Geena Davis made the Olympic team.\"\n\nHuish, 24, said he shot with Davis last week in a private yard in the San Fernando Valley and \"a couple of times, she shot better than me.\"\n\nDavis first learned she had shooting ability while going through FBI training to shoot handguns for the 1996 film \"The Long Kiss Goodnight,\" said Rabska. But she had no interest in firing handguns in her backyard, he said.\n\nShe wanted to try shooting with a bow and arrow after watching Huish win two gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics.\n\n\"He made it look so elegant and interesting,\" she said.\n\nShe met with Huish, who thought initially that Davis \"wanted to shoot archery just as a stress reliever.\"\n\nShe told him she wanted to go to the Olympics.\n\nRabska, an archer for more than 30 years, said Davis has mastered a concentration during her acting career that helps her as an archer. Archery, he said, is all about finesse and mental toughness.\n\nDavis has been practicing five hours a day, shooting about 300 arrows. She had a target range set up on the set of her latest film, \"Stuart Little.\" She also goes to the gym five days a week to work out on the treadmill and lift weights.\n\n\"She's shooting well right now, better than I've ever seen her,\" said Rabska.\n\nSaid Davis \"I don't feel that I've yet discovered how good I can get.\"\n\nPhoto by The Associated Press\n\nAcademy Award winning actress Geena Davis practices for the semifinals of the U.S. Olympic Archery Team Trials at Brookdale Park in Bloomfield, N.J. yesterday. Davis is in a field of 28 women seeking one of three spots on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team."
