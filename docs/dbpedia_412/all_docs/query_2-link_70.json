        "text": "The likes of Noah Lyles, Novak Djokovic and Scottie Scheffler have secured gold on a day of massive finals across Paris.\n\nMarquee names winning medals has been the story of the day. Djokovic defeated Carlos Alcaraz to win the men’s singles gold medal in tennis, Scheffler caught fire in the final round of the men’s golf to add a gold medal to his list of accomplishments, and Lyles won the men's 100-meter dash in a photo finish for the ages.\n\nMeanwhile, on the last night of the swimming program, the U.S. women won the final race, the 4x100m medley relay, to clinch gold medal supremacy over rivals Australia.\n\nMedal table | How to follow\n\nThe uneven bars final is about to get underway, and Suni Lee has the lucky position of going last in the lineup of eight competitors vying for individual medals. This means she'll know exactly what score she needs to earn a spot on the podium.\n\nAlgeria's Kaylia Nemour is the favorite to take gold, but reigning Olympic bars champion Nina Derwael will put up a fight to defend her title. Defending world champion Qiu Qiyuan is also in the mix.\n\nBrady Ellison’s quest to become the first American archer to win individual gold in the 21st century fell just short. Millimeters short.\n\nIt would have been the first U.S. individual gold in archery since Justin Huish in 1996. Instead, Ellison adds a silver to go with the bronze he won in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. He leaves Paris with two medals, after winning the bronze in the mixed team event.\n\nSouth Korea's Kim Woo-jin exits Paris with three golds in individual, men's team and mixed team. South Korea swept all five archery golds.\n\nIt came down to Kim Woojin of South Korea against the American Brady Ellison in the men's individual archery.\n\nEllison was 4-2 up before a fightback meant it was 4-4 and a final set. At this point, both men managed three straight 10s! It would thus be decided by whoever was closest to the target with one arrow.\n\nBoth competitors managed another 10 but Ellison's was 3mm further off the centre than Kim's.\n\nWhat a final.\n\nPlaying only 500 miles from the Spanish border, Jon Rahm is destroying the field in today’s final round at Le Golf National and potentially cruising to a gold medal. A front-nine 31 puts him at 5-under on the day, 19-under for the men's golf competition, and in the solo lead by three shots.\n\nAfter a pair of opening pars, Rahm birdied the third, made a 13-footer for birdie on No. 4, a 23-footer for birdie on No. 6, rolled in two more short ones Nos. 7 and 9. Most impressively, though, might've been a par-save on the 218-yard par-3 8th. After missing the green badly left, Rahm left a difficult chip 16 feet short of the hole. Making the putt, the 29-year-old let out a long exhale, as his three-shot lead went untouched.\n\nJapan's Hideki Matsuyama and England's Tommy Fleetwood are currently tied for second, while Xander Schauffele, who entered today as a co-leader, is four-shots back at 15-under.\n\nTom Kim, a South Korean who can gain an exemption from the country's mandatory military service requirement by winning an Olympic medal, is three shots back from a potential bronze. He's 13-under with seven holes to play.\n\nThe United States women's indoor volleyball team have clinched a spot in the quarterfinals at the Olympics, beating France 3-0.\n\nIt has been a tough road for the defending gold medalists, who lost their opener to China and needed five sets to get past Serbia in their second game. Winless France pushed them to 29-27 in each of the first two sets Sunday before the Americans finished it off 25-20 in the third.\n\nThe U.S. will learn its exact seeding and quarterfinal opponent later today at the conclusion of group play.\n\n(Also, if you're in Paris and plan on attending a volleyball match, be advised that the temporary grandstands are very wobbly when the mass of fans start cheering and moving. It's a bit of a thrill ride.)\n\nIt’s Sunisa Lee's turn to take center stage at Bercy Arena. Lee is the only American to qualify for the uneven bars event final. (Simone Biles finished ninth and only the top eight qualify.) A bronze medalist in this event in Tokyo, Lee will have her work cut out for her here.\n\nThe third-best qualifier, she will compete last in a very competitive field. Algeria’s Kaliya Nemour has an incredibly difficult routine — a 7.1 start value — and if she nails it, she will be tough to beat. The reigning Olympic gold medalist, Nina Derwael from Belgium, and reigning world champion Qiu Qiyuan of China will also have strong hopes of winning a medal.\n\nSomething to look out for: earlier this year, Lee was working on what would be a signature move were she to nail it in competition — a full twisting layout Jaeger. She has yet to attempt it in Paris but if she throws it here, it will certainly up the difficulty on her own routine.\n\nThree years ago, Lee was devastated when she failed to win gold in Tokyo. Exhausted and overwhelmed after winning the all-around gold, she felt like she didn't have what was needed to excel.\n\nFelix Lebrun, the 17-year-old French table tennis star, has just won the bronze medal in men’s singles.
