        "text": "Shooting with poise and accuracy beyond his years, Justin Huish, 21, won a gold medal yesterday by defeating four opponents from four nations at Stone Mountain, Ga.\n\nHuish, of Simi Valley, Calif., who shoots with a baseball cap on backward to keep his long hair in place, won by defeating Magnus Petersson of Sweden, 112-107. ''I will wear this gold medal everywhere I go,'' Huish said. ''I can't believe I won.''\n\nHuish survived a quarterfinal with Michele Frangilli of Italy. In a shoot-off, Frangilli and Huish hit bull's-eyes, scoring 10 points. But in the second round, Frangilli shot first and scored only 9. Huish hit the bull's-eye to advance to the semifinals, where he defeated Paul Vermeiren of Belgium, 112-103.\n\n''Sometimes it seems like I'm in a fog,'' Huish said. ''I just see gold in my sight and let it rip.'' CHRISTOPHER CLAREY"
