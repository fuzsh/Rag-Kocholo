        "text": "She already won an Oscar – and now sexy Geena Davis is shooting for Olympic gold.\n\nThe flame-haired star of “Thelma and Louise” is an expert with a bow and arrow and has qualified as a finalist for the women’s Olympic archery team.\n\n“Geena is one of the top 32,” Kathleen Frazier of the National Archery Association confirmed yesterday.\n\nDavis desperately wants to keep her athletic skills under wraps to avoid a media circus – and won’t talk about the possibility she could represent the United States.\n\nBut she told a pal, “I would really love to make the Olympic team.”\n\nThe statuesque beauty was one of 300 women competing last month in Oxford, Ohio, for a semifinals berth.\n\nThe upcoming finals in Bloomfield, N.J., will determine who will fill three slots, plus an alternate, on the U.S. Olympics team.\n\nDavis shot to cinematic superstardom when she won an Oscar for best supporting actress as a quirky dog trainer who falls for William Hurt in the 1988 drama “The Accidental Tourist.”\n\nSources said the 42-year-old stunner was inspired to take up achery by the gold-medal victories of American archer Justin Huish at the 1996 Games in Atlanta.\n\nHuish became the first American archer to win two gold medals in the same Olympics when he grabbed the top prize in the men’s individual competition as well as a team gold.\n\n“She was watching the Olympics and she got into it about two years ago. She took lessons and she practices five hours a day, every day,” one source said.\n\nIf Davis makes the team, it would be the first time a Hollywood star has gone to the Olympics.\n\nDavis began her professional career as a Zoli model, then landed her first movie role in 1982 as a soap actress dressed only in bra and panties in “Tootsie.”\n\nHer other movies include “Beetlejuice,” “Earth Girls Are Easy,” “The Fly” and “A League of Their Own.”\n\nThe thrice-divorced stunner’s ex-husbands include actor Jeff Goldblum and action director Renny Harlin."
