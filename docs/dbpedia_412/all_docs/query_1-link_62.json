        "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- For Brady Ellison to say he’s shooting his best archery ever going into his third Olympics is a lofty statement.\n\nEllison, of Globe, was ranked No. 1 recurve archer in the world for almost two years from 2011-13 and currently stands No. 6. He was on the U.S. men’s silver medal-winning team at the 2012 Olympics and, with Rio teammates Zach Garrett (No. 3 in the world) and Jake Kaminski (No. 26), hopes to finish one step higher on the podium this time.\n\nSouth Korea, Netherlands, France and defending gold medalist Italy are other team medal contenders. The U.S. – Ellison, Kaminski and Jacob Wukie – upset Korea in the 2012 Olympic semifinals before losing 219-218 to Italy in the gold-medal match.\n\nTeam scoring is different in Rio, where archery will be held at the Sambodromo, built in 1984 for the Rio Carnival samba parade. After a ranking round on Friday, 12 teams will compete head-to-head Saturday based on set points instead of cumulative scoring. Set scoring also is used in individual competition. In team, each archer shoots two arrows per set and the set winner earns two points (or one each for a tie). The first team to five points is the winner.\n\nEllison, 27, is no fan of the set system for the team event.\n\nMORE: #Rio2016 coverage from azcentral sports and USA TODAY Sports\n\n“It’s a joke,” he said. “It takes away from our sport. I don’t know any other sport where you can make a huge detrimental mistake and still win. Individually, we’re used to it. In the team rounds, there’s no place for it.”\n\nWorld Archery, the sport’s international federation, believes team competition will be more exciting and easier to follow using the set system, increasing interest for spectators and TV viewers.\n\nEllison shot at the Sambodromo in a test event last year. “It should be quite an amazing venue for archery,” he said. “It’s super small and super tight and the fans are a lot closer than before. The walls are higher so hopefully not as much wind (as at the Lord’s Cricket Ground in London). It’s going to be more like Beijing (in 2008).”\n\nAt his first Olympics, Ellison was 27th individually, then moved up to 17th in London.\n\nHe’s had some major life changes since London including a second marriage, to Slovenian compound archer Toja Cerne, in April. He left the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif., and moved to Globe, where he was born before growing up in Payson and Glendale.\n\n“For me, it’s a lot better,” Ellison said. “I didn’t like California. There wasn’t a lot I could do over there to get away and have fun. Now I can jump in my boat and go to Roosevelt Lake. I’m in the best place I’ve been in a long time.”\n\nEllison plans to continue shooting into his 30s, at least through the 2020 Tokyo Olympics when he and his wife would like to start a family.\n\nEllison is the latest in a string of Olympic archers with Arizona ties going back to 1976 that includes medalists Jay Barrs, Justin Huish, Rick McKinney, Alison Williamson (Great Britain) and Debra Ochs. His one remaining goal is an Olympic individual medal.\n\n“It’s the one I’m missing” from major indoor and outdoor meets, said Ellison, the 2016 World Indoor bronze medalist. “It’s important, but it’s just another tournament. If I shoot good enough to do it, I’ll do it.”"
