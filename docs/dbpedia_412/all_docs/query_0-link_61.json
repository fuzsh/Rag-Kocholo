Wunderle trailed from the start of the final round as Fairweather won in windy conditions, 113-106. Wunderle, 24, was a wunderkind in archery, twice winning the world junior championships in the early 1990s. Fairweather went ahead 28-25 at the end of the first round of three arrows and was never threatened. Wunderle was a surprise finalist, getting past South Korea's Oh Kye-moon in the quarterfinals, 108-105. Oh had the Olympic record for 12 arrows when he shot 115 in Atlanta and was the bronze medalist behind Justin Huish of the United States. Huish was not around to defend his title. The freewheeling archer resigned from the American team earlier this year because of marijuana possession charges. The South Koreans were poised to dominate the archery competition. They swept all the women's medals and the men had taken the top three spots in the ranking competition. Yet the top-ranked South Korean, Jang Yong-ho, lost in the round of eight. Oh fell to Wunderle and Kim Chung-tae bowed out against Magnus Petersson. In the semifinals Wunderle edged Petersson 108-107 and Fairweather defeated Wietse van Alten, Netherlands, 112-110. Van Alten took third over Petersson in the bronze-medal match."
