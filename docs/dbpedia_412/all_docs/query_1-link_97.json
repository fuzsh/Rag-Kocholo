        "text": "Are you a lover of sports or history? Planning a visit to Balboa Park? If you’ve answered Yes and Yes, make sure you head over to the free San Diego History Center in Balboa Park!\n\nTheir current Inside/Out exhibit is titled Summer of Sports. A large display case contains fascinating sports artifacts and ephemera from the San Diego History Center Collections.\n\nThe Olympic Games return this summer, and the display takes this into account. But it mostly focuses on local sports and San Diego history.\n\nThere’s also a great video that you can watch concerning San Diego’s own skateboarding legend Tony Hawk!\n\nThe Inside/Out display case contains all sorts of San Diego sports pins and patches. Do you recognize some of these?\n\nAlice “Lefty” Hohlmayer was a Hall of Fame player in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. In her later life she resided in San Diego.\n\nThe next photo is from an old ZLAC program. ZLAC was founded in San Diego in 1892 and is the oldest continuously operating women’s rowing club in the world.\n\nOne part of this historical sports exhibit concerns Palisade Gardens, a skating rink that opened in 1946 on University Avenue in North Park. It was the first post-World War II commercial structure completed in San Diego. It closed in July 1985.\n\nThe steel and leather roller skates are circa 1930s.\n\n…\n\nThanks for visiting Cool San Diego Sights!\n\nI post new blogs pretty often. If you like discovering new things, bookmark coolsandiegosights.com and swing on by occasionally!\n\nI live in downtown San Diego and love to walk around with my camera! You can follow Cool San Diego Sights via Facebook or X.\n\nIt’s not often you get to visit where Olympic athletes train!\n\nToday, my favorite part of the Celebration of Champions event at the Chula Vista Elite Athlete Training Center was checking out where Olympic archers hone their skills. There was more to see than the immense indoor and outdoor archery ranges. My eyes and mind were captivated by a large museum-like display of the history of archery at the Olympic Games.\n\nPlease enjoy the following photos. To learn more, read the captions!\n\n…\n\nI live in downtown San Diego and love to walk around with my camera! You can follow Cool San Diego Sights via Facebook or Twitter!\n\nFor 23 years the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista has been utilized by hundreds of Team USA athletes. It has now transfered ownership from the United States Olympic Committee to the City of Chula Vista. Although the large 155-acre facility is now called the Chula Vista Elite Athlete Training Center, it remains one of the most important U.S. Olympic and Paralympic training sites. And now non-Olympic athletes, including people who live in the community, will have a chance to develop their sporting skills here, too!\n\nToday, a fun Celebration of Champions event was held to showcase this state-of-the-art facility to the public, and to honor local achievers. I’d never visited the place, so of course I had to go check it out!\n\nAnd I took some photos! As usual, read the captions!\n\n…\n\nI live in downtown San Diego and love to walk around with my camera! You can follow Cool San Diego Sights via Facebook or Twitter!\n\nYou can easily explore Cool San Diego Sights by using the search box on my blog’s sidebar. Or click a tag! There are thousands upon thousands of fun photos for you to share and enjoy!\n\nRight now, the world’s most amazing sand sculptures are standing on the B Street Pier on San Diego’s Embarcadero. They were created by a select group of international sand masters for the 2015 U.S. Sand Sculpting Challenge. These talented sculptors are world-class artists, as you can see from the following images. My photos were taken on Saturday morning shortly after the gate opened. All of the competing artists were on the pier adding the final touches to their incredible artwork. The sculptures will be officially judged this afternoon.\n\nThe theme of the U.S. Sand Sculpting Challenge this year is the Olympic Games. Many of the sand masterpieces had a classic, sculptural relief appearance. Every one was sensational.\n\nThe competitive event, which takes place downtown at the edge of our beautiful bay next to the Cruise Ship Terminal, continues through Labor Day weekend. If you can’t make it, enjoy these photos!\n\n…\n\nFollow this blog for more photos of cool stuff! Join me on Facebook or Twitter."
