        "text": "By Jake Finch\n\nAmelia Aboujawdah thought archery sounded cool. She overheard her parents talking to her brother about taking lessons and decided she wanted to take them, too.\n\nA month into her newfound sport, she's hooked.\n\n\"It's a lot of fun,\" the Thousand Oaks 12-year-old said. \"I just really like it. I want to take it as far as I can.\"\n\nAmelia shared her thoughts in between her turns shooting at the target range at Tapo Canyon Park in Simi Valley. It's run by the Conejo Valley Archers and open every Saturday morning. Amelia's parents, and many others, take their kids there to try out the sport when an interest in archery blooms. And it's not just kids; plenty of adults pull back on the bowstrings.\n\n\"Typically, we get people every weekend who are new,\" said Conejo Valley Archers Vice President David Dragan, a longtime archery enthusiast who coaches for the club.\n\nArchery has received renewed attention lately with the popularity of \"The Hunger Games\" young-adult book trilogy that spawned a recently released movie. The main character is an archer.\n\n\"It's always been popular,\" he said. \"It's one of those quiet sports. We don't toot our own horn. But right now, we're seeing a tremendous surge in interest because of the entertainment industry.\"\n\nDon Smith, who works at Archery Sports in Simi Valley, agrees. Since the books have come out and especially with the release of the movie, his shop has seen a definite increase in business, especially among young women.\n\n\"I can't tell you what the percentage increase in our business because we can't get enough bows in here\" to meet the demand, he said. \"Most of the manufactured recurves come from overseas, and it's getting tough getting them in. There's been quite an increase in recurve bows. Now 'The Avengers' is coming out, and that's going to have archery in it.\"\n\nArchery Sports recently relocated to Santa Susana Pass Road and features an indoor range where lessons are offered. Dragan said the next-closest indoor archery range is in Long Beach, making Archery Sports a popular destination for training.\n\nWith the coming 2012 Summer Olympics and the promise of Brady Ellison, Dragan fully expects to see another increase in interest in archery. Ellison, 23, already has won numerous gold medals in both team and individual world competitions and is favored, Dragan said, for the gold in London\n\nAnother time Dragan saw archery become openly popular was after the 1996 Summer Olympics when Simi Valley's Justin Huish won two gold medals for the U.S. It was the last time the U.S. came home with the gold, and Huish is said to have inspired actress Geena Davis in her unsuccessful Olympic bid.\n\n\"Archery is completely ageless,\" said Dragan, who helped coach Davis and said she was a naturally gifted athlete. \"But we've calculated all of this and we've determined that it takes seven years of dedication to the sport to achieve the top levels of achievement. That's thousands of hours of practice.\"\n\nThere are two types of bows in archery, the recurve, which is used in Olympic competition, and the compound shooters, which were originally designed for hunting. Newcomers are always started on a recurve bow.\n\n\"What we teach is archery form,\" Dragan said. \"And safety.\"\n\nOf course, plenty of people out on the Saturday morning when Amelia was shooting weren't looking to earn medals. They just like archery.\n\nEmily Nauert started working with a bow and arrows when she was 7. Now 15, she still enjoys practicing. Why?\n\n\"I don't have to be running around all over the place,\" she said.\n\nThe club holds open practice sessions for anyone interested in archery. The cost is $5 a person and equipment is provided. The club's mission is to foster the growth of archery, and it does this by coaching promising youths through its Junior Olympic Archery Development program and maintaining the range at Tapo Canyon Park.\n\nThe club currently boasts three national champions and several state champions. Membership totals about 260, Dragan said, with several top-level certified coaches."
