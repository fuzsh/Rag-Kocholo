        "text": "A \"brief history of archery.\"\n\nThe contents of this page were copied from the \"South African Archery Portal\" (www.archerysa.co.za/index.htm).\n\nPre 25,000 BC\n\nThe discovery of the first stone arrowheads in Africa tends to indicate that the bow and arrow were invented there, maybe as early as 50,000 BC.\n\nIt was probably developed in conjunction with the invention of the spear thrower.\n\nA short bow would be a better hunting weapon when used to stalk animals in wooded areas, rather than carry around long spears.\n\nThe shape of the earliest bows can only be guessed at, as broken or worn out bows would probably end up on the cooking fire, reshaped into different tools or just thrown away.\n\n25,000 - 18,000 BC\n\nFire hardened points used on the arrows. Flint arrowheads shaped to a point and inserted into a slot and tied with sinew to the front of the arrow. Feathers were glued and tied with sinew to the arrow shafts.\n\n18,000 - 9,000 BC\n\n11,000 BC - In a burial tomb in San Teodoro Cave, Sicily, a skeleton was found with a fragment of a flint arrow head embedded in the pelvis. Arrow shafts found in Germany are dated to approx. 9,000 BC.\n\n9,000 - 6,000 BC\n\nBows are found in Denmark that date from approx. 8,000 - 6,000 BC.\n\nThese bows are one piece made from yew or elm and are 'tillered'. (Even amount of bend on top and bottom limbs.)\n\nTassili rock fresco depicting archer in Egypt from about 7,500 BC.\n\n6,000 - 3,000 BC\n\n5,000 BC - the Egyptians use the bow for hunting and in warfare against the Persians.\n\n3,300 BC - a 45 yr. old man dies on the Similaun Glacier in the Alps near the present day border between Italy and Austria. His preserved body is found on 11th. September, 1991.\n\nAfter many years of research, \"Oetzi\" has revealed how he once lived and worked.\n\nHe was dressed in leather clothes with a grass waterproof cloak and shoes stuffed with grass as protection against the weather.\n\nHe also had a framed backpack, a utility belt containing tools, a quiver containing 14 arrows, a flint dagger and most amazing of all, a copper axe.\n\nThe reason why the discovery of the copper axe caused such interest is that it pre-dates the generally accepted development of copper smelting by almost 1,000 years.\n\n(So now the history books have to be revised.)\n\nAfter detailed analysis of body tissue and hair, it was discovered to contain high amounts of copper and arsenic, which can only come about from prolonged exposure to copper ore and the smelting process. This indicates that he mined the copper ore, probably from ancient mines found 120km. to the South in Italy and then melted the ore in a furnace to create the copper axe.\n\nHis quiver had a protective flap to keep the feathers dry on the arrows.\n\nThe wooden arrows were fitted with flint arrowheads. Some of his arrows were shorter than the others and seemed to have been made by a right-handed person indicated by the direction of the thread used to tie on the feathers. The other arrows were longer and made by a left-handed person. Why he had two different lengths of arrows remains unknown.\n\nOne possible scenario on how he lived his life is that during the winter he would travel to the copper mines. There he would mine the ore and make copper axes, possibly to trade for other items. During the summer, he would take flocks of sheep up the mountain passes to graze, maybe using his bow and arrow to protect the sheep from wolves and also for hunting. He may have traded some arrows for one of his copper axes during his travels. (For more details, see the BBC Horizon TV documentary \"Ice Mummies\".)\n\nRefer also to the Primitive Archer Magazine at http://www.primitivearcher.com for more recent information.\n\n3,000 - 1,000 BC\n\n2,800 BC - The 'Composite Bow' first appears. The Egyptians further developed this type of bow. Made from wood, tipped with animal horn and held together with animal sinew and glue. The unstrung bow resembled a 'C' shape and required two people to string it. The bowstrings were made from 'catgut' obtained and made from sheep's intestines.\n\nThe arrows were extremely light and when used with the composite bow, could be shot 366 metres ( 400 yards ) and the armour of the day was no protection against such weapons.\n\nThe Egyptians used archers on the back of light chariots. These were organised into highly trained units able to quickly out-flank an enemy army with devastating effect.\n\nEgyptian bow and arrows from\n\napprox. 2,300 BC-1400 BC.\n\nBow length = 62\"-68\" (160-173cm)\n\nArrows made from reeds with hard foreshafts 8\"(20cm) long bound into the shaft with very fine linen thread then tipped with flint heads. The fletchings are 3\"(7.5cm) long feathers glued to the shafts with shellac.\n\nArrow length = 34\"-37\"(86-94cm).\n\nArrow weight = 0.4-0.5oz(10-14gm).\n\n2,600 BC - Pyramids of Caral, situated about 125 km north of Lima in Peru, South America were built to form a large city complex. The large stepped pyramids even exceed the size of the pyramids in Egypt for sheer volume of material used. The neighbouring river was used to irrigate crops of cotton, which was then woven into fishing nets to trade with the coastal fishing villages in exchange for fish. This peaceful trading city was thought to exist for the next 600 years.\n\n(Archaeological digging is still revealing how these ancient city dwellers lived.)\n\n2,500 BC - Akkadians conquered Sumeria with infantry archers.\n\n1,500 - 1027 BC - First mention of Crossbows in China.\n\n1479 BC - 1426 BC - The King of Egypt, Thutmose III, was reported to be a highly skilled warrior in archery and horsemanship, often giving public displays of his skill. He expanded the Egyptian empire to cover Syria and Sudan. Many temples and monuments were built to commemorate his triumphs.\n\n1288 BC - Battle for Kadesh between the Pharaoh Ramses II and the Hittite King, Mutallu. The highly mobile Egyptian archers on the back of chariots were able to defeat the Hittite army.\n\n1260 BC - 1240 BC - Philoctetes had been bequeathed the bow and arrows of the Greek hero Heracles in return for lighting his funeral pyre, thus he became a notable archer. On the way to the siege of Troy he was incapacitated by a snakebite and was left behind. After a seer revealed that Troy could be taken only with the aid of Heracles' bow and arrows, the Greek warriors Odysseus and Diomedes went to Philoctetes and persuaded him to accompany them to Troy. There he was healed of his wound and killed Paris, son of the King of Troy, by which action he paved the way for the city's fall through using the 'Trojan Horse'.\n\n1209 BC - Merneptah, son of Ramses II (Pharaoh of Egypt) used his archers to defeat an invading army of Libyans, who lost nearly 9,400 men in the battle.\n\n1,200 - 700 BC - Assyrian archers shot from chariots while the charioteer held a shield for protection.\n\nIn China, the nobility of the time attended special schools where they were taught archery, music, rituals, charioteering, mathematics and writing.\n\n1,000 BC - 400 AD\n\n490 BC - 'Battle of Marathon', Athenian infantry of 11,000 men with long spears, swords and armour defeated Persian archers after a rapid charge to avoid the shower of arrows. The Persian army of 15,000 men were flanked by the infantry and lost 6,400 men killed in retreat back to their ships. The Athenians only lost 192 men. According to legend, an Athenian messenger was sent from Marathon to Athens, a distance of about 40 km(25 miles), and there he announced the Persian defeat before dying of exhaustion. The modern marathon race is based on this story.\n\n360 BC - Macedonian - archers on horseback used to support other cavalry troops.\n\n327 BC-326 BC - Indian prince, Porus, who ruled the region between the Hydaspes (Jhelum) and Acesines (Chenab) rivers at the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of the Punjab. Porus resisted Alexander, but with his elephants and slow-moving infantry bunched, he was out-flanked by Alexander's mobile cavalry and mounted archers in the battle of the Hydaspes. Impressed by his techniques and spirit, Alexander allowed him to retain his kingdom.\n\n260 BC - Hannibal used cavalry archers.\n\n250 BC - Parthians (Iran/Afghanistan) were excellent horsemen and archers. In battle they would often shoot their arrows back towards the enemy while pretending to flee.\n\nThis could be where the phrase \"a Parthian Shot\" became today's phrase \"a Parting Shot\".\n\n221 BC - Qin Shihuang, First Emperor of China. Discovery of his 'Terracotta Army' in 1974. The burial pits contain approx. 6,000 life size figures.\n\nTerracotta CrossBowman. He is wearing plated armour over a battle robe.\n\nPainted Reconstruction. Colour version based on original paint samples.\n\nBronze CrossBow Bolts. Triangular points on circular stems; 200mm long.\n\nReconstructed CrossBow. Body is 720mm long. Has bronze trigger mechanism. Estimated range is 800 metres.\n\n53 BC - Parthians tried to invade Rome with some success, but bows and arrows were not much good against garrison walls.\n\n37 BC - Roman troops invaded Parthia, but lost many 1,000's to hit and run tactics.\n\n200-300 AD - The late Han/Jin Period.\n\nBow: Length: 130 cm. Width: 0.6 cm - 3.2 cm. Thickness: 0.6 cm - 4.6 cm. Arrow: Length: 73.5 cm.\n\nGraphical reconstruction of the Niya Bow by Stephen Selby.\n\n(from original on display in the Revolutionary Museum in Beijing, China.)\n\nAn example of a Magyar (Hungarian) composite recurve bow.\n\nFor more detailed information on the materials and construction of the bow, refer to\n\nhttp://www.atarn.org/magyar/magyar_1.htm\n\n288 AD -\n\nSebastian commanded a company of the Preatorian Guard for the Roman Emperor, Diocletian. After his secret belief in Christianity was revealed, he refused to renounce his faith. The emperor ordered that he be bound to a stake and shot to death with arrows. He was left for dead after several arrows, but a friend discovered that he was still alive and nursed him back to health. Later he proclaimed his Faith from the steps of the Emperor's Palace.\n\nThe guards were ordered to beat him to death with clubs and his body was thrown in the sewer. His body was recovered by friends and buried in the catacombs.\n\n376 AD - the Pope, St. Damascus, built a Basilica over Sebastian's tomb which is now one of the seven principal churches in Rome.\n\nNow St. Sebastian is the Patron Saint of Archers.\n\n400 - 1000 AD\n\n434 AD - Attila the Hun - Reined as King from 434-453AD. The Huns used composite recurve bows from horseback with deadly effect on opposing armies.\n\nThe Hun kingdom was located in modern-day Hungary. Attila embarked immediately upon a series of wars extending Hun rule from the Rhine across the north of the Black Sea as far as the Caspian Sea. Some historical accounts number his army between 300,000 to 700,000 troops, which for those times, is a huge force of arms. The defeat of his army by the allied Roman and Visigoth armies at Chalons in 451 AD thwarted his first campaign into Western Europe. The following year, he invaded Northern Italy, nearly securing Ravenna, but halted at the request of Pope Leo I and returned home to his capital near present day Budapest. He died in 453 AD, supposedly choking to death of a nosebleed while in a drunken stupor after marrying another wife.\n\n552 AD - 'Battle of Taginae', the Byzantine emperor, Justinian I sent his commander, Narses, with an army of 20,000 men into Italy, where, at the Apennine village of Taginae near the Flaminian Way, he defeated the Goths. The Goth commander, Totila, had ordered his army to use only spears, was fatally wounded. The victory, credited to imperial archers, allowed Narses to march through Italy and eventually liberate Rome.\n\n500 - 900 AD - Byzantines used mounted archers and then a cavalry charge against the Saracen's, Vandal's, Goth's and Frank's. The Avars used mounted archers using stirrups to stand while shooting, thus increasing their accuracy.\n\n900 AD - Byzantines changed to using archers on foot.\n\n1000 - 1200 AD\n\n1066 AD - The Battle of Hastings - King Harold of England was waiting for the invasion of William of Normandy.\n\nIt is believed that King Harold was killed by an arrow through the eye which resulted in victory for William.\n\nPart of the Bayeux Tapestry showing King Harold struck by the arrow.\n\n1099 AD - Crusades. English knights and crossbowmen attack the Mohammadean army that mainly consisted of archers on horses armed with composite bows.\n\n1100 AD - 2nd. August. William II, King of England, is killed by an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrel while hunting in the new forest. Sir Walter flees the country. Also in the hunting party is William's brother who succeeds him as Henry I and immediately takes possession of the treasury. There is suspicion that this may not have been an accidental shooting to gain the throne of England.\n\n1100-1135 AD - Henry I proclaimed that an archer would be absolved of murder, if he killed a man during archery practise.\n\n( An ironic touch.)\n\n1147-1149 AD - Crusades ?.\n\n1189 - 1192 AD - Crusades. King Richard killed with a crossbow bolt shot by a defender using one of the attacking army's crossbow bolts. The bolt didn't kill Richard outright, but the wound became infected after the arrow head was cut out.\n\n1200 to 1300 AD.\n\n1208 AD - Temujin became Great Khan of the Mongols, better known as Genghis Khan.\n\nThe Mongols were expert mounted archers that used high stirrups which allowed them to shoot in any direction. They used composite bows ( 70 - 160 lb. draw weight ) and released the bowstring with a thumb ring that increased the killing range of the bow to 275 metres ( 300 yards.) The maximum range of their bows was about 550 metres ( 600 yards. )\n\nThe unarmoured soldiers wore silk under-shirts to minimise the injury from arrows. The loose silk shirt would wrap around the arrow head without being cut. This would allow the clean removal of the arrow by slowly pulling on the shirt, thus stopping cuts from barbed arrow heads and also reduce the risk of infection.\n\nTheir tactic against an opposing army would be to send in a small attack force, engage and then retreat with the opposing army giving chase. This small force would then lead the army to a pre-arranged ambush site, where the army would be surrounded by archers and showered with arrows. The heavy cavalry would then move in to finish off.\n\nThe Mongol army used ruthless tactics against cities, sometimes killing the entire population. This would spread fear through the region, making capture of further cities easier.\n\n1211 - 1294 AD - The Mongol Empire spreads as far as Austria, Russia, Syria, Persia, Vietnam, Korea and China.\n\n( See the TV Documentary \"Storm from the East\" which details the Mongol conquests.)\n\n1227 AD - pipe rolls list a person named Robert Hood as a fugitive. ( Robin Hood ? )\n\n1242 AD - Battle of Taillebourg - English army lost to French - 700 crossbowmen used.\n\n1252 AD - 'Assize of Arms' - those men owning land worth between 40-100 shillings were required to equip themselves with a sword, dagger, bow and arrows. Those owning less than 40 shillings worth of land had to equip themselves with bow and arrows. All men between the age of 15 to 60 years old were ordered to equip themselves.\n\n1298 AD - Battle of Falkirk - English army defeats Scots. The English knights charged the Scottish archers, scattering them, then the English archers attacked the remaining army.\n\n1300 to 1400 AD\n\n1307 AD - William Tell - because William refused to bow towards a hat placed on a pole as a sign of imperial power, has was ordered to shoot an apple off his son's head.( He was known as an expert crossbowman. ) He succeeded in shooting the apple.\n\nThe story of his feat also stated that he had a second crossbow bolt hidden behind his belt in case he failed and killed his son, he would have quickly reloaded and killed the official who had ordered him to shoot the apple off his son's head.\n\n1333 AD - 19th July - Battle of Halidon Hill. Scottish army is defeated by Edward III of England demonstrating for the first time the full potential of the English Longbow in battle.\n\n( 22,000 Scottish heavy cavalry defeated by 2,000 English archers and 500 knights.)\n\n1340 AD - English ships of war had archers who used arrows with half-moon shaped heads to cut down the rigging of the opposing French ships.\n\n1346 AD - 26th August - Battle of Crecy - Edward III of England leads his army against the French. Some accounts of the battle say that the English archers had kept their flax bowstrings dry by putting them under their helmets as it had been raining the day before.\n\nThe French force of crossbowmen attacked from the front, but maybe due to the rain, many misfired or the bowstrings snapped. The English archers showered them with arrows before they could reload. Most of the crossbowmen fled. The French cavalry then charged, but were decimated by the English archers.\n\n1,542 French knights are killed with only 50 English killed.\n\nFrench crossbowmen shown on the left using 'cranks' to pull the bowstring back while the English longbowmen on the right showered them with arrows.\n\nDetail of Crossbow with Windlass.\n\n1356 AD - 19th September - 'Battle of Poitiers' - Edward III of England defeats King John II of France. The English troops took up positions on marshy ground near a river and when the French knights charged, they became bogged and easy targets for the English archers. King John is taken prisoner and held in the Tower of London. A ransom of 3,000,000 gold crowns is demanded for his release.\n\n1400 to 1500 AD\n\n1400 AD - Byzantines were defeated by Turkish archers on horses.\n\n1440 AD - The bow shown at left is a 'Centre Shot Stone Bow' from an painting dated about 1440 AD. It is interesting to note the split bowstring shown, as this type of bowstring/cable set-up has recently been used on the modern Compound Bows to do away with using the usual cable guard set-up.\n\n1415 AD - 25th October - Battle of Agincourt - Henry V of England army was attacked by the French army near Calais. The French brought 60,000 to the field of battle, including several hundred mounted knights representing all of the most important families in France. This force faced a mere 6,000 English soldiers, mainly archers. The opposing forces faced each other for several hours waiting to see who would move first. Henry sounded the attack, whereby the archers advanced a short distance and planted a row of stakes in front of them. This prompted the French to attack with a knight's charge. This charge was repelled, but the retreating force ran into the second wave of French knights and other cavalry units. This caused mass confusion in the French attack.\n\nThe English archers continued to shower arrows down on the French until finally running out of arrows. The archers then attacked with swords, daggers and even the mallets they had used to drive in the stakes.\n\nSome accounts state as many as 10,000 French knights and soldiers were killed, with only 100 English soldiers killed. Other accounts state only 29 English killed. Either way it was a testament to the effectiveness of organized units of archers equipped with heavy warbows against the best plate and mail armor of the time.\n\nThe Battle of Agincourt showing longbowmen to the front with knights behind.\n\nExamples the various types of arrow tips used during the 15th. Century.\n\nThe 'barbed' arrow tips were the most common used.\n\nThe small triangular tips without 'barbs' were used to pierce the chainmail armour.\n\nThe 'half-moon' arrow tips were used to shoot through the rigging ropes of opposing ships.\n\n1450 AD - Earliest surviving ballad, \"Robin Hood and the Monk\".\n\n1472 AD - The practise of Archery was declining due to shortage of bowstaves.\n\n1457 AD - James II, King of England, first decreed that the sports of football and golf should be banned as they interfered with archery practise.\n\n1477 AD - Edward IV, King of England, bans the early version of the game of cricket as it is interfering with compulsory archery practise.\n\n1492 AD - Leonardo da Vinci. Sketch design of siege crossbow by Leonardo da Vinci, done when he was employed as a siege engineer in the court of Francis I of France.\n\n1500 to 1600 AD\n\n1500 - 1550 AD - The ballads about Robin Hood \"Lyttell Geste of Robyn Hode\".\n\n'Robin and the Knight', 'Robin, Little John and the Sheriff', 'Robin and the King' and 'Robin Hood's death'.\n\nMaid Marion is not part of the original stories, but may have been added to later tales.\n\n1508 AD - The use of crossbows was forbidden in England, to increase the use of the longbow.\n\n1509 AD - Henry VIII, King of England, at age 18 proves himself an accomplished archer.\n\n1510 AD - King Henry purchased 40,000 yew bow staves from the Doge of Venice.\n\n1513 AD - Sept. 9th.'Battle of Flodden', fought near Branxton, Northumberland. James IV, King of Scotland, crossed the border on 22nd. August with an army of about 30,000 men supported by artillery. Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, gathered an army of about 20,000 to oppose him. Fearing that the Scots would retreat to the border, Surrey issued a challenge to James, who agreed to wait until September 9th. to fight. The battle began in the late afternoon. The Scots fought stubbornly, but the English 2.5 metre long bill (a staff ending in a hooked-shaped blade) proved superior to the Scottish 4.5 metre long spear and English archers proved decisive on the Scottish right. By nightfall the Scottish army was annihilated. James was killed, together with at least 10,000 of his men.\n\n1520 AD - Henry VIII demonstrates his skill with the longbow at a summit meeting hosted by the French King, where he repeatedly shot into the centre of a target at a distance of 220 metres ( 240 yards ).\n\nHenry VIII demonstrating his skill with the longbow.\n\n1520 AD - the musket is invented and will soon replace the bow as a weapon of war.\n\n1521 AD - General Cortes of Spain used crossbowmen in his conquest of Mexico.\n\n1534 AD - King Henry orders that 30,000 bows be made and kept at the Tower of London.\n\n1545 AD - King Henry's flagship \"Mary Rose\" sinks in the Solent near Portsmouth, England. The remains are recovered in 1982 from the fine silt that has preserved the hull and its contents. Over 100 longbows were found all made from fine-grained yew. The yew was shaped into a 'D' section with sapwood on the back of the bow and a thicker section of heartwood on the belly. This worked as an efficient natural lamination giving the bow strength. Boxes of arrows were also found, bound in bundles of 24 and kept apart with a pierced circular leather disc to prevent crushing the goose flight feathers. The shafts were 800mm long, 10mm diameter and made from ash wood. A nock was cut into the base of each shaft and reinforced with a v-shaped horn insert. It has been estimated that the range of these longbows with a 41 kg ( 90 lb.) draw weight could have been up to 250 metres. Also other records indicate that a practised archer could shoot up to 12 arrows per minute.\n\nImagine what an army of a thousand archers could do to an opposing force.\n\nThe reports of the sky darkening with arrows were a matter of fact!\n\nRoger Ascham published his book 'Toxophilis' (Lover of the Bow) which was the first book written in English about archery.\n\n1588 AD - 10,000 soldiers on the English fleet, armed with muskets, defeated the Spanish Armada. ( The decline of bow and arrow in warfare is now assured. )\n\n1595 AD - all bows were ordered to be exchanged for muskets.\n\n1600 to 1700 AD\n\n1625 AD - Picture of a foot soldier about to release his longbow. He also holds his pike at the ready to defend against possible cavalry attack, but it is obviously also being used as a way to determine the proper elevation to hit distant targets.\n\nHe has a sword for close combat. Note the two finger draw of the bowstring.\n\n1644 AD - Tipper Muir - last battle in which English archers were used.\n\n1673 AD - The archery tournament known as the 'Ancient Scorton Arrow' was founded in Yorkshire, England. ( It is the oldest archery tournament still held today.)\n\n1676 AD - The Royal Company of Archers first practised 'Clout Archery' using longbows to shoot at a 31\" diameter white target at distances between 180 to 240 yards.\n\n1700 to 1800 AD\n\n1708 AD - One of the most notable incidents involving archery in Sikh history relates to the death of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the 10th Guru and a co-founder of the Sikh religion. In 1708, 2 Pathan assassins attempted to kill him. One stabbed him in the chest, but the Guru responded with his sword and beheaded the attacker. The other Pathan was dealt with by the Guru's guards. The Guru's wounds were tended to by a Dr. Cole, I believe. Now, around this time, Guru Gobind Singh Ji had received a gift of a new, powerful bow. While his wounds were healing, he could not resist the temptation of trying the new bow out. Sadly, drawing the bow re-opened his chest wound and it began bleeding profusely. As a result, he died in October 1708, but by then the Sikh faith was well established.\n\nSikhs were known to hunt game for sport and as a means of sharpening their martial skills.\n\nIt is evident from historical records and paintings, that short recurve bows were used, probably shot using a thumb ring.\n\n(This article was kindly supplied by Harjinder S. Obhi of London, England.)\n\n1798 AD - The Sultan Selim, witnessed by the British Ambassador, shot an arrow 889 metres ( 972 yards ).
