        "text": "3,300 BC\n\nA 45 yr. old man dies on the Similaun Glacier in the Alps near the present day border between Italy and Austria. His preserved body is found on 11th. September, 1991. After many years of research, “Oetzi” has revealed how he once lived and worked. He was dressed in leather clothes with a grass waterproof cloak and shoes stuffed with grass as protection against the weather. He also had a framed backpack, a utility belt containing tools, a quiver containing 14 arrows, a flint dagger and most amazing of all, a copper axe. The reason why the discovery of the copper axe caused such interest is that it pre-dates the generally accepted development of copper smelting by almost 1,000 years. (So now the history books may have to be revised with a new date.)\n\nAfter detailed analysis of body tissue and hair, it was discovered to contain high amounts of copper and arsenic, which can only come about from prolonged exposure to copper ore and the smelting process. This indicates that he mined the copper ore, probably from ancient mines found 120km. to the South in Italy and then melted the ore in a furnace to create the copper axe. His quiver had a protective flap to keep the feathers dry on the arrows. The wooden arrows were fitted with flint arrowheads. Some of his arrows were shorter than the others and seemed to have been made by a right-handed person indicated by the direction of the thread used to tie on the feathers. The other arrows were longer and made by a left-handed person. Why he had two different lengths of arrows remains unknown.\n\nOne possible scenario on how he lived his life is that during the winter he would travel to the copper mines. There he would mine the ore and make copper axes, possibly to trade for other items. During the summer, he would take flocks of sheep up the mountain passes to graze, maybe using his bow and arrow to protect the sheep from wolves and also for hunting. He may have traded some arrows for one of his copper axes during his travels.\n\n(For more details, see the BBC Horizon TV documentary “Ice Mummies”.) Refer also to the Primitive Archer Magazine at http://www.primitivearcher.com for more recent information.\n\nMore recent investigation of the body, a flint arrowhead has been found embedded in his left shoulder. Someone had shot him in the back with an arrow not long before he died. It may be the cause of his death from loss of blood and hypothermia after fleeing from the person who had shot him. More DNA investigation has now found that the clothing worn by “Oetzi” has three different blood stains on it. This may have come about from “Oetzi” defending himself from several attackers, before fleeing into the mountains, or he may have even been the attacker and had come off second-best. This may explain the injury from an arrow in the back.\n\n3,000 – 1,000 BC\n\n2,800 BC – The ‘Composite Bow’ first appears. The Egyptians further developed this type of bow (Fig. 3). Made from wood, tipped with animal horn and held together with animal sinew and glue. The unstrung bow resembled a ‘C’ shape and required two people to string it. The bowstrings were made from ‘catgut’ obtained and made from sheep’s intestines. The arrows were extremely light and when used with the composite bow, could be shot 366 metres ( 400 yards ) and the armour of the day was no protection against such weapons. The Egyptians used archers on the back of light chariots. These were organised into highly trained units able to quickly out-flank an enemy army with devastating effect.\n\n2,600 BC – Pyramids of Caral, situated about 125 km north of Lima in Peru, South America were built to form a large city complex. The large stepped pyramids even exceed the size of the pyramids in Egypt for sheer volume of material used. The neighbouring river was used to irrigate crops of cotton, which was then woven into fishing nets to trade with the coastal fishing villages in exchange for fish. This peaceful trading city was thought to exist for the next 600 years.(Archaeological digging is still revealing how these ancient city dwellers lived.)\n\n2,500 BC – Akkadians conquered Sumeria with infantry archers.\n\n1,500 – 1027 BC – First mention of Crossbows in China.\n\n1479 BC – 1426 BC – The King of Egypt, Thutmose III, was reported to be a highly skilled warrior in archery and horsemanship, often giving public displays of his skill. He expanded the Egyptian empire to cover Syria and Sudan. Many temples and monuments were built to commemorate his triumphs.\n\n1,000 BC – 400 AD\n\n490 BC – ‘Battle of Marathon’, Athenian infantry of 11,000 men with long spears, swords and armour defeated Persian archers after a rapid charge to avoid the shower of arrows. The Persian army of 15,000 men were flanked by the infantry and lost 6,400 men killed in retreat back to their ships. The Athenians only lost 192 men. According to legend, an Athenian messenger was sent from Marathon to Athens, a distance of about 40 km(25 miles), and there he announced the Persian defeat before dying of exhaustion.\n\n360 BC – Macedonian – archers on horseback used to support other cavalry troops.\n\n327 BC-326 BC – Indian prince, Porus, who ruled the region between the Hydaspes (Jhelum) and Acesines (Chenab) rivers at the time of Alexander the Great’s invasion of the Punjab. Porus resisted Alexander, but with his elephants and slow-moving infantry bunched, he was out-flanked by Alexander’s mobile cavalry and mounted archers in the battle of the Hydaspes. Impressed by his techniques and spirit, Alexander allowed him to retain his kingdom.\n\n260 BC – Hannibal used cavalry archers.\n\n250 BC – Parthians (Iran/Afghanistan) were excellent horsemen and archers. In battle they would often shoot their arrows back towards the enemy while pretending to flee. This could be where the phrase “a Parthian Shot” became today’s phrase “a Parting Shot”.\n\n221 BC – Qin Shihuang, First Emperor of China. Discovery of his ‘Terracotta Army’ in 1974. The burial pits contain approx. 6,000 life size figures of soldiers, archers and cavalry, including horses. Each figure is different and may have been based on actual living persons of the time.\n\nA huge burial mound exists nearby and may be the tomb of the First Emperor. Legend says it contains vast riches, but also a curse to any who violate the tomb. To date, the burial mound has not been explored.\n\n400 – 1000 AD\n\n434 AD – Attila the Hun reined as King from 434-453AD. The Huns used composite recurve bows from horseback with deadly effect on opposing armies. The Hun kingdom was located in modern-day Hungary. Attila embarked immediately upon a series of wars extending Hun rule from the Rhine across the north of the Black Sea as far as the Caspian Sea. Some historical accounts number his army between 300,000 to 700,000 troops, which for those times, is a huge force of arms. The defeat of his army by the allied Roman and Visigoth armies at Chalons in 451 AD thwarted his first campaign into Western Europe. The following year, he invaded Northern Italy, nearly securing Ravenna, but halted at the request of Pope Leo I and returned home to his capital near present day Budapest. He died in 453 AD, supposedly choking to death of a nosebleed while in a drunken stupor after marrying another wife.\n\n552 AD – ‘Battle of Taginae’, the Byzantine emperor, Justinian I sent his commander, Narses, with an army of 20,000 men into Italy, where, at the Apennine village of Taginae near the Flaminian Way, he defeated the Goths. The Goth commander, Totila, had ordered his army to use only spears, was fatally wounded. The victory, credited to imperial archers, allowed Narses to march through Italy and eventually liberate Rome.\n\n500 – 900 AD – Byzantines used mounted archers and then a cavalry charge against the Saracens, Vandals, Goths and Franks. The Avars used mounted archers using stirrups to stand while shooting, thus increasing their accuracy.\n\n900 AD – Byzantines changed to using archers on foot.\n\n1200 to 1300 AD\n\n1208 AD – Temujin became Great Khan of the Mongols, better known as Genghis Khan. The Mongols were expert mounted archers that used high stirrups which allowed them to shoot in any direction. They used composite bows ( 70 – 160 lb. draw weight ) and released the bowstring with a thumb ring that increased the killing range of the bow to 275 metres ( 300 yards.) The maximum range of their bows was about 550 metres ( 600 yards. ) The unarmoured soldiers wore silk under-shirts to minimise the injury from arrows. The loose silk shirt would wrap around the arrow head without being cut. This would allow the clean removal of the arrow by slowly pulling on the shirt, thus stopping cuts from barbed arrow heads and also reduce the risk of infection. Their tactic against an opposing army would be to send in a small attack force, engage and then retreat with the opposing army giving chase. This small force would then lead the army to a pre-arranged ambush site, where the army would be surrounded by archers and showered with arrows. The heavy cavalry would then move in to finish off. The Mongol army used ruthless tactics against cities, sometimes killing the entire population. This would spread fear through the region, making capture of further cities easier.\n\n1211 – 1294 AD – The Mongol Empire spreads as far as Austria, Russia, Syria, Persia, Vietnam, Korea and China. ( See the TV Documentary “Storm from the East” which details the Mongol conquests.)\n\n1227 AD – Pipe rolls list a person named Robert Hood as a fugitive. (Robin Hood ?)\n\n1242 AD – Battle of Taillebourg – English army lost to French – 700 crossbowmen used.\n\n1252 AD – ‘Assize of Arms’ – those men owning land worth between 40-100 shillings were required to equip themselves with a sword, dagger, bow and arrows. Those owning less than 40 shillings worth of land had to equip themselves with bow and arrows. All men between the age of 15 to 60 years old were ordered to equip themselves.\n\n1298 AD – Battle of Falkirk – English army defeats Scots. The English knights charged the Scottish archers, scattering them, then the English archers attacked the remaining army.\n\n1520 AD – Henry VIII demonstrates his skill with the longbow at a summit meeting hosted by the French King, where he repeatedly shot into the centre of a target at a distance of 220 metres ( 240 yards)\n\n1520 AD – the musket is invented and will soon replace the bow as a weapon of war.\n\n1521 AD – General Cortes of Spain used crossbowmen in his conquest of Mexico.\n\n1534 AD – King Henry orders that 30,000 bows be made and kept at the Tower of London.\n\n1545 AD – King Henry’s flagship “Mary Rose” sinks in the Solent near Portsmouth, England. The remains are recovered in 1982 from the fine silt that has preserved the hull and its contents. Over 100 longbows were found all made from fine-grained yew. The yew was shaped into a ‘D’ section with sapwood on the back of the bow and a thicker section of heartwood on the belly. This worked as an efficient natural lamination giving the bow strength. Boxes of arrows were also found, bound in bundles of 24 and kept apart with a pierced circular leather disc to prevent crushing the goose flight feathers. The shafts were 800mm long, 10mm diameter and made from ash wood. A nock was cut into the base of each shaft and reinforced with a v-shaped horn insert. It has been estimated that the range of these longbows with a 41 kg ( 90 lb. ) draw weight could have been up to 250 metres. Also other records indicate that a practised archer could shoot up to 12 arrows per minute.\n\n(Imagine what an army of a thousand archers could do to an opposing force. The reports of the sky darkening with arrows were a matter of fact!)\n\nRoger Ascham published his book ‘Toxophilis’ (Lover of the Bow) which was the first book written in English about archery.\n\n1922 – “Robin Hood” – movie staring Douglas Fairbanks as Robin Hood.\n\n1931 – FITA (International Archery Federation) is formed.\n\n1934 – The state of Wisconsin is granted the first bow hunting season in the USA.\n\n1937 – Bow sights are first used at the NAA National Tournament, USA with a ‘sighted’ archer, Emil Pikula, winning second place.\n\n1938 – Ben Pearson is credited with beginning the mass production of Archery beginning in March of 1938- I believe his company to have been the largest manufacturer of archery equipment between 1939 and 1967- which (at periods) during that time frame employed around 8oo employees. Ben Pearson was among the first inductees of the Archery Hall Of Fame in 1972 (he passed away in 1971), also he is in several other halls- National Bowhunters Hall of Fame – The National Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame- Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame – Arkansas Outdoor Sportman Hall Of Fame – Arkansas Bowhunters Hall of Fame- also received the Compton Medal of Honour in 1967 from the National Field Archery Association.

(This article kindly supplied by Ben Pearson Jr.)\n\n‘The Adventures of Robin Hood’ (a movie classic), made in 1938 with Errol Flynn (as Robin Hood), Olivia de Havilland and Basil Rathbone.\n\nWarner Brothers Pictures hired Mr. Howard Hill (a famous bow hunter) to coach Errol Flynn to perform as a convincing archer in his roll as ‘Robin Hood’ in the movie. When Mr. Hill was unable to complete Mr. Flynn’s training because of conflicting commitments, Hill asked Robert Tatsch to finish fine tuning Flynn’s skills where necessary. Robert, who was 17 years old at the time and an accomplished archer in his own right, accepted the assignment. In appreciation Mr. Hill gave Robert his old competition tonkin bamboo bow (65 lbs. draw and 65″ in length) and Mr. Flynn took Robert on a weekend sail to Catalina Island on his yacht ‘Sorrocco’ following the completion of filming.\n\n1939 – James Easton experimented with making aluminium arrows.\n\nHoward Hill’s bow hunting exploits with a longbow are covered in films and magazines.\n\n1941 – Larry Hughes used aluminium arrows to win American National Championships.\n\nHenry Bitzenburger invented his famous fletching jig.\n\n1942 – Hoyt Archery Co. is started by Earl Hoyt Jr.\n\n1946 – Easton’s first trademarked aluminium arrows “24 SRT-X” produced.\n\n1951 – Max Hamilton introduced ‘Plastiflech’ vanes to replace feathers.

However, he realized that the crossbow had the potential, as it once did, to become an effective close-range hunting tool by modern standards. Horton began experimenting with crossbow designs in his workshop, creating crossbows for his personal use. The word quickly spread about his crossbows and it was then that the Horton legacy was born. From the very first prototypes, Horton’s designs proved to be rugged, compact and accurate. Horton’s vision brought the crossbow out of the dark ages and into the forefront of modern big game hunting. Moving his operation to the United States, Horton has led the crossbow crusade, becoming the world’s largest maker of modern crossbows.
