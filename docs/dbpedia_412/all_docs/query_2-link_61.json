        "text": "Olympic champion archer Justin Huish was sentenced Wednesday to four months in jail for selling marijuana.\n\nHuish pleaded no contest last month to a felony charge of selling marijuana from his Simi Valley home. He could have been sentenced to six months in jail but the judge, citing no prior criminal history, ordered him to jail for four months. He begins his sentence July 11.\n\nThe 25-year-old archer did not comment after sentencing. Judge Herbert Curtis considered a letter written by Huish to the court and his family.\n\n\"The people found the letter compelling,\" Deputy District Attorney Ron Carpenter told the judge.\n\nHuish's lawyer, Robert Sanger, told Curtis, \"He acknowledges very clearly that he did something wrong.\"\n\nHuish was arrested Feb. 15, 2000, after police witnessed an apparent drug deal outside the home. A detective stopped a man leaving the home and found a plastic bag of marijuana in his pocket.\n\nThe man told a detective he bought the marijuana from Huish, and officers returned with a search warrant, finding a briefcase containing several half-ounce plastic bags of marijuana.\n\nHuish originally pleaded not guilty, arguing that he was providing the marijuana for an HIV patient. Huish was later ordered to stand trial on possession and drug sale charges which, if he was convicted, could have led to a three-year prison term.\n\nHuish won two gold medals at the 1996 Olympics. He quit the U.S. team last year after his arrest, telling the archery federation he did not want his case to interfere with his team's preparation for the Sydney Games.\n\nHuish's roommate and co-defendant, Brian Mastrangelo, was convicted by Curtis in a nonjury trial on three misdemeanor charges for allowing drug sales at the home and for possessing martial arts weapons."
