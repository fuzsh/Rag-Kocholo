        "text": "Woodstock archer Richard “Butch” Johnson will be one of the four recipients of a prestigious Gold Key award presented by the Connecticut Sports Writers’ Alliance on Sunday, April 30 at the Aqua Turf Club in Southington.\n\nThe five-time Olympian will be joined by Dwight Freeney of the Atlanta Falcons, Farmington High School boys soccer coach Steve Waters and former Cheshire High School swim coach Ed Aston at the 76th annual event.\n\nJohnson attended Bartlett High School in Webster. Mass., but moved to Woodstock where he trained for competition in his backyard.\n\nJohnson first began his Olympic odyssey in 1992 on a whim. He decided to go to the Olympic trials with no expectation of making the U.S. team, but surprised himself when he was chosen.\n\n“I was like a fish out of water,” Johnson told The Bulletin in 2008 of his Barcelona experience. Johnson could not be reached for comment on this story,\n\nHe failed to finish in the top 10 but got the experience which paid off in 1996 at the Atlanta games.\n\nJohnson failed to medal individually in Atlanta, but the U.S. squad (which included Johnson, Justin Huish and Rod White) captured the team gold medal.\n\n“It was pretty exciting, especially being the home country. Fans were going crazy. It was probably the most memorable day of my life,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson and the U.S. team won a team bronze medal in 2000 in Sydney and then it was off to Greece in 2004.\n\n“Forget that one. That was a nightmare,” Johnson said. “The stadium was beautiful, but it wasn't good for archery. They have a seasonal wind that comes through, and in the individual competition, we probably had 30-40 mph winds. The stadium was like a horseshoe and the wind was hitting you from the right and left. It was bouncing around. World-class archers, who never miss a target, missing frequently - it was a joke.”\n\nDespite the difficulty, the U.S. team finished just outside the medal hunt in fourth place.\n\nJohnson also competed in the Beijing games in 2008.\n\nJohnson won team gold medals at the Pan American games in 1999 and 2007 and individual silver and bronze medals at the Pan American games in 1995. He has also won countless national titles.\n\nMost recently, Johnson finished second in the 2012 National Target Championships and won a silver medal in the 2012 Hoyt World Open.\n\nFreeney is still an active player for the Falcons.\n\nAs of Saturday, he had played in 13 games with three sacks this season.\n\nFreeney, who was born in Hartford and played high school football at Bloomfield, is a seven-time Pro Bowler, a three-time First Team All-Pro selection and a Super Bowl champion.\n\nIn 34 seasons at Farmington, Waters has led the Indians to nine state titles and 529 wins. He has a record of 529-82-48 and his teams have made 14 state finals.\n\nAfter 37 years coaching the Cheshire girls swim team and 33 coaching the boys, Ed Aston stepped down in 2011 as one of the most successful swim coaches in state history.\n\nAston, who went to Croft High in Waterbury and swam for Southern Connecticut State, finished with 824 wins, 43 state championships and a historic dual meet win streak of 281 straight wins."
