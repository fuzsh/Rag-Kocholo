        "text": "Hollywood actress Geena Davis is shooting for success in a new field - as part of the US Olympic archery squad.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress is bidding to join the team for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, and has qualified for for the semi-finals of the squad's trials on 22-24 August.\n\nThe 42-year-old Thelma and Louise star only took up the sport two years ago, after being inspired by the success of young American archer Justin Huish, who won two gold medals in the 1996 Olympics aged 21.\n\nDavis asked her manager to fix her up with a qualified teacher - and was introduced to Huish.\n\nShe began competing in tournaments six months ago - and managed to keep her second career secret until recently.\n\n\"My family and friends knew I was doing it all along,\" she said.\n\n\"But I've been fortunate that we've managed to keep it out of the public knowledge. I'm so grateful that the archers keep it private so I was able to concentrate on improving.\"\n\nPractising on film sets\n\nLast month she finished 29th out of 300 women in the US national championships in Ohio, with the top 32 qualifying for this month's semi-finals at Bloomfield, New Jersey, where that number will be reduced to eight.\n\nTarget: Geena's hoping to make the Sydney Olympics\n\nThe finals are held in California in September, when only three women and one substitute can qualify.\n\nShe said: \"I'm pretty pleased with how far I've come. I've been fortunate to discover in my adult life that I have a fair amount of athletic ability. As a child, I was uncoordinated and shy.\"\n\nDavis has no plans to give up her acting career - while making her forthcoming film Stuart Little she was given a target next to the stage to get into practice during breaks.\n\nShe explained: \"It's interesting because you can get the adrenaline going and wonder if you can control the nerves. But the way I'm approaching this is that I've already won. I had no idea that I'd be this good.\"\n\nBut Davis, who won a best supporting actress Oscar in 1988 for The Accidental Tourist, has no plans to make a film about her sport - even though she starred in the baseball movie A League Of Their Own.\n\nShe said: \"I don't think there's a huge demand for archery in Hollywood.\""
