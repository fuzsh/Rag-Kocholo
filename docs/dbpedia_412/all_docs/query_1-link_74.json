        "text": "One of the earliest records of the inhabitants of the Korean peninsula comes from the Chinese over six millennia ago. They spoke of \"Dong-Yi,\" a derisive term for eastern barbarians.\n\nBut the Chinese had paid the descendants of the Koreans a great compliment, for the Chinese character Yi could be interpreted as an amalgam of two other characters: tae (or \"big\") and gung (or \"bow\"). Six thousand years later Koreans have carried their big bow high at the Olympics, with South Korea having won 25 medals in archery since 1984.\n\nStone-age sport\n\nOriginally invented as a method of survival, historians date archery's roots back more than 25,000 years. The earliest artwork showing the bow and arrow turned up in Egypt, drawn about 5,000 years ago. While the Egyptians used bows to hunt, they also used them as weapons of war.\n\nWith each improvement to the bow, a civilization could go from wandering tribe to conquering empire. The Assyrians carved out an empire with the help of the invention of the recurve bow in 1,500 BC. By using curved limbs instead of the straight ones found on traditional longbows, archers were able to get more power and accuracy with each release.\n\nTribes from the Asian steppes such as the Huns, Magyars and Mongols were known for their mounted archers. The English thrived during the Middle Ages with the help of the longbow.\n\nGuns for hunting and warfare, archery for fun\n\nWith the invention of gunpowder, the bow and arrow's popularity waned, and archery was relegated to more of a sporting pastime. But in 1879, the sport regained popularity when brothers J. Maurice and William H. Thompson founded the National Archery Association. Like all Confederate soldiers, the pair was forbidden to own firearms at the close of the American Civil War and saw the bow and arrow as a natural choice.\n\nAlthough wood has been replaced with fibreglass, carbon graphite and aluminum on most modern bows used in Olympic competition, the overall design remains much the same.\n\nArchery became an official Olympic event in 1900. It was featured again in 1904, 1908 and 1920, then dropped from competition due to lack of organization and interest. The sport resurfaced as an Olympic event in 1972, and has undergone numerous rule changes since 1984. Team events were introduced in 1988.\n\nIn the early exhibitions, British bowmen were usually on top, but since 1972, South Korea and the United States have been the most consistent nations in the sport. The U.S. currently leads the archery medal count with 29.\n\nCanada has never won an Olympic medal in archery. Lucille Lemay Jackson had the highest finish by a Canadian in 1976 when she placed fifth in the women's individual event."
