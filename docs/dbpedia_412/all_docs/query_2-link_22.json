        "text": "Justin Huish is a self-proclaimed California kid, with a ponytail hanging from under a backward cap and eyes peering through mirrored sunglasses. He's also an Olympic archery champion.\n\nHuish had consecutive 10s to open the men's gold-medal match and never trailed Thursday in a 112-107 victory over Sweden's Magnus Petersson. And in a sport where the loudest sounds usually are the whoosh of the arrows, this dude's performance was anything but serene.\n\nDuring the medals round, the 21-year-old Huish pumped his fists and waved his arms to encourage a cheering home crowd of more than 5,000.\n\n\"I had too much energy and I had to get it out somehow, and that was a way for me to release it,\" said Huish of Simi Valley, Calif. \"Every time they cheered for me, they gave me the score I needed. I wanted to get them back involved with it and make it feel like they were down there shooting with me.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Huish briefly tied the Olympic scoring record with a 169-162 victory over Cho Shang-Ling of Taiwan. Later, Michele Frangilli of Italy set an Olympic 18-arrow match record with a 170 against Stanislav Zabrodsky of Ukraine. Huish beat Frangilli in the next round.\n\nBADMINTON: South Korea's Bang Soo-hyun, the 1992 silver medalist, defeated 16-year-old Mia Audina of Indonesia 11-6, 11-7 to win the women's gold medal. Denmark's Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen took the men's title, beating China's Dong Jiong 15-12, 15-10. Hoyer-Larsen was the only non-Asian to medal in the Games. The South Korean team of Gil Young-ah and Kim Dong-moon won the gold medal in mixed doubles, defeating Ra Kyung-min and Park Joo-bong, also of South Korea, 13-15, 15-4, 15-12.\n\nCANOE/KAYAK: The U.S. team had five boats competing on Lake Lanier. All five failed to advance past the semifinals. John Mooney and Peter Newton came close to the fourth place they needed to qualify for a chance at a medal but were edged at the finish by Australians Peter Scott and Grant Leury in the 1,000-meter two-man race. Two-time Olympian Mike Harbold was seventh in the 1,000-meter kayak semifinals; team captain Joseph Harper finished last in the 1,000-meter canoe; the four-woman kayak team, needing a second-place finish, ended up fourth, and the four-man kayak crew came in last.\n\nEQUESTRIAN: World champion Franke Sloothaak shook off the affects of a bloody spill and rode a clear second round to help Germany win the team show-jumping gold in Conyers, Ga. Ulrich Kirchhoff jumped a clear round under pressure in the third slot to set up Olympic champion Ludger Beerbaum, who clinched the crown for Germany with a faultless final ride. Germany finished on a two-round total of 1.75 faults for a comfortable victory. The United States, which had three riders turn in clear rounds, took silver on 12 faults.\n\nFIELD HOCKEY: Australia won the women's gold medal, defeating South Korea 3-1. The Netherlands beat Britain 4-3 in a penalty shootout after the bronze-medal match ended 0-0. Malaysia beat the Americans 4-1, leaving the U.S. team 0-7 in Atlanta and 0-26-4 in Olympic history.\n\nRHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS: Bulgaria, the defending world champion, finished first in the preliminary round. Italy and Germany were knocked out along with the last-place United States. The U.S. team has only been around for three years, and this was just its second international competition. At the first, last year's World Championships, the United States finished 15th out of 23 countries. It qualified for the Games as the host team. Individually, Ekaterina Serebryanskaya, who tied for first at last year's World Championships, was in first place after two rounds of preliminaries, slightly ahead of fellow Ukrainian Elena Vitrichenko.\n\nTABLE TENNIS: Liu Guoliang of China won the gold medal in men's singles, giving China a sweep of the four golds in the sport. It also won three silvers. Liu defeated Wang Tao of China 21-12, 22-24, 21-19, 15-21, 21-5. In the bronze-medal game, Joerg Rosskopf of Germany defeated Petr Korbel of the Czech Republic 21-17, 19-21, 21-18, 21-19.\n\nTEAM HANDBALL: A 24-23 loss to Angola left the U.S. women winless and in last place in the eight-team field. Denmark beat Norway 23-19 to reach the gold-medal game against South Korea, which continued its pursuit of a third consecutive gold in the event by beating Hungary 39-25.\n\nYACHTING: Americans Kris Stookey and Louise Van Voorhis had a chance to win a medal in the women's 470 class, but they struggled to an 11th-place finish in the final race and dropped from third to fourth with 47 points overall. Defending gold medalists Theresa Zabell and Begona Via Dufresne of Spain won the gold with 25 points. The United States won nine medals in 10 events in Barcelona four years ago but has managed only one bronze in the eight events decided so far in Savannah, Ga. Yevhen Braslavets and Ihor Matviyenko of Ukraine clinched the gold in men's 470 on Tuesday and chose not to race, finishing with 40 points. The silver medal went to John Merricks and Ian Walker of Britain with 61 points, one better than bronze medal winner Vitor Rocha and Nuno Barreto of Portugal.\n\n_ TIMES WIRES"
