        "text": "Geena Davis is one of the nation's best with a bow and arrow, but she doesn't like to talk about it much.\n\nThe actress is a finalist to make the U.S. Olympic archery team after competing in the semifinals against 299 women last month in Ohio.\n\n\"Yes, Geena Davis is one of the top 32,\" National Archery Association spokeswoman Kathleen Frazier said Thursday. She just wants to keep a low profile.\"\n\nDavis, who won the supporting actress Academy Award for the 1988 movie The Accidental Tourist, was one of 300 women competing July 12-16 in Oxford, Ohio, for a semifinals berth.\n\nThe Aug. 22-24 finals in Bloomfield, N.J., will determine three slots, plus an alternate.\n\nPaul Bloch, Miss Davis' publicist, wouldn't comment on her archery skills.\n\nThe 1996 gold medal victories of American archer Justin Huish in Atlanta inspired Miss Davis, a source close to the actress, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.\n\nHuish became the first American archer to win two gold medals in the same Olympics when he took home the top prize in the men's individual as well as a team gold.\n\n\"She was watching the Olympics and she got into it about two years ago. She took lessons and she practices five hours a day, every day,\" the source said.\n\nDavis' movie credits include Beetlejuice, Earth Girls Are Easy, The Fly and A League of Their Own.\n\nÂ©1999 The Associated Press.
