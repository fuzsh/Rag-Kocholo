Nearly. After setting an Olympic record that was broken less than an hour later, the U.S. team was nearly perfect in a shoot-off to gain the bronze medal in men's archery Friday. Paced by individual silver medalist Vic Wunderle of Mason City, Iowa, and Atlanta gold medalists Butch Johnson of Woodstock, Conn., and Rod White of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, the United States beat Russia 29-26 in the overtime round. Both teams tied 239 through nine rounds. U.S. coach Lloyd Brown made a one-arrow shootoff part of his practices so the archers could get used to the feeling of a tension-filled finale. In the three-arrow shoot-off, Johnson and Wunderle each hit a 10 while White hit a nine, just one point from a perfect score. Russia ended with a total of 26. \"We have to thank our coach for the shootoff practice,\" said White. \"We wanted to come home with some hardware, so we're happy.\" \"We've practiced that situation,\" said Johnson. The Americans had to scramble after wasting a seven-point lead with nine arrows to go. \"It was looking real good but it went away fast,\" said Johnson. \"We shot really well early in the match,\" said Wunderle. \"Russia shot well and it made for a close, exciting finish.\" In the quarterfinals, the Americans teamed for 255 points. However, South Korea, on its way to the gold medal, scored 258 less than an hour later. The previous mark was a 249 by another South Korean trio in 1996 at Atlanta, a team that lost to an American threesome for the gold. Four years ago, Johnson and White joined individual gold medalist Justin Huish to gain the team gold. Huish resigned from his spot on the archery team after he was charged with marijuana possession earlier this year. In the gold medal match, South Korea was never threatened. Jang Yong-ho, Oh Kyo-moon and Kim Chung-tae beat Italy 255-247. Italy beat the United States in the semifinals, 244-241. In the quarterfinals, the South Koreans bettered the American Olympic mark of 255 with 258 against Ukraine, missing the world record by two. South Korea took three of the four medals, led by a sweep of the women, with record-setting performances in both team and individual competition. The men, after taking the top three spots in the ranking phase, failed to gain an individual medal."
