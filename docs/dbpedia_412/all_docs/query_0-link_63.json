Huish was featured on TV in Bud Greenberg’s documentary.\n\nThe only child of two skilled archers, Huish began shooting with his father when he was just 14. He proved to be a quick learner and immensely talented. In 1992 he won the 18-and-under National Championship, and although only one class away from earning his Associate’s Degree in General Education, he decided to focus on archery and put his education on hold.\n\nIn 1993 he was arrested and pleaded \"no contest\" to vandalism for spray-painting \"KKK\" on the property of an African-American couple. He received three years probation and was given community service. Just two years later, he won the 1995 National Target Championships. The free-spirited Huish, known for his grunge-chic ponytail, sunglasses and earring, went on to dominate the competition during the 1996 Olympics. His father once described him as being like a \"little kid who hasn’t learned fear yet,\" and went on to say that Justin has a strong sense of self-esteem, which aids him during competition.\n\nLegal troubles, however, plagued him once again in early 2000 when he and his roommate, Brian Mastrangelo, reportedly sold marijuana to a police informant. On 25 February 2000, Huish surrendered to the police and was ordered to stand trial.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nEvents\n\nWork : Prize 1992 (National Championship, archery)\n\nCrime : Arrest 1993 (Vandalism)\n\nWork : Prize 1995 (National Target Championships)\n\nWork : Prize 1 August 1996 in Atlanta (Olympic Gold Medal, men's individual archery)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nWork : Prize 2 August 1996 in Atlanta (Olympic Gold medal, men's team archery)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nCrime : Trial dates 25 February 2000 (Selling marijuana)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nSource Notes\n\nDiana K.
