He also talks for the first time to a media outlet about his famous fall from that peak.\n\nHuish quit the 2000 U.S. Olympic team after he was arrested in California for possession of marijuana for sale.\n\nHe talks about the freak injury that preceded his arrest and his subsequent attempts to make a comeback, which extend to today. Huish finished 11th at the 2020 USA Archery Target Nationals and fifth at the 2020 U.S. Open in August.\n\nlimbwalker\n\n· Genesis 21:20\n\nJoined Sep 26, 2003\n\n·\n\n25,655 Posts\n\nI'd say he's doing alright.

Mike Plummer-seeded around 14th, took out the top seed and ended up beating Justin in the finals. The wind was brutal and Justin had a four on his last round which opened the door for Mike to win-and he did. Justin was seeded sixth. While the competition was obviously missing Brady, Jack and Jacob, most of the other top shooters were there\n\nlimbwalker\n\n· Genesis 21:20\n\nJoined Sep 26, 2003\n\n·\n\n25,655 Posts\n\nIncidentally, Justin had a match vs. Mark Hainline at that event.

That wind looked crazy and I was estimating that it was 18-25 mph (maybe gusting to 30mph) based on what I saw the flags doing. Any chance you happen to have an actual wind reading?\n\nnakedape\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Sep 28, 2015\n\n·\n\n499 Posts\n\nWell, there wasnt just the pot selling incident. There was the hate crime incident as well. Though it was later expunged by a judge, those types of things tend to linger as indicator of ones character even 20 some years later.\n\nChris\n\nIt also makes me wonder whether he shot while he was high...\n\nI don't smoke weed, but have competed in sports again people who do. Many of them smoke before they compete, they said it helps them calm their nerves and be more focused.\n\nSeattlepop\n\n· Is that a cookie?\n\nJoined Dec 8, 2003\n\n·\n\n5,419 Posts\n\nIt also makes me wonder whether he shot while he was high...\n\nI don't smoke weed, but have competed in sports again people who do.

We didn't stick around for the Gold medal matches, as a storm was due to blow in. I assume it did.\n\nMichael Plummer was outstanding and deserves recognition. From trying NTS to regaining his own form, with Glenn's guidance. That's some phenomenal stuff. If there were a gold medal for grit, Michael deserves it.\n\nAs for Justin, I have nothing but props. He's a pleasure to be around, with a great attitude, a competitive spirit and still plenty of game.\n\nSeattlepop\n\n· Is that a cookie?\n\nJoined Dec 8, 2003\n\n·\n\n5,419 Posts\n\nWell, the 2018 Vegas Shoot champion lost his title for THC\n\nI looked that up and it is interesting for sure. What I didn't learn is whether he was high while he was shooting. For example, he may have rolled one the night before to relax. Don't THC markers stay in your system for up to a month after indulging? He also had beta blockers in his system. I've never heard of marijuana being a performance enhancer.

The American flag was straight out and the banners were really whipping.\n\nArrowbender\n\n· Can't keep em straight\n\nJoined Nov 7, 2018\n\n·\n\n9,575 Posts\n\nAnd in the UFC, the two brothers Nate and Nick Diaz, top UFC fighers and top stoners.\n\nyeah, me and you can't walk straight after getting high, but the \"pro\" potheads not only manage but excels.\n\nIf the Diaz brothers fought stoned (and I'd bet they didn't, but just tested positive for traces of massive past use), the question would be how much more they could have achieved if they hadn't. It doesn't exactly do miracles for your reflexes or reaction time.\n\nThe only sporter I ever knew who actually sported stoned, was an amateur-level hobbyist soccer player who thought it \"put him into the zone\". It mostly just made him not realize his performance was actually rubbish until the team benched him.\n\nIt's a banned substance, but more in the sense that no one wants to be shooting next to the drunk or the coked-up guy either."
