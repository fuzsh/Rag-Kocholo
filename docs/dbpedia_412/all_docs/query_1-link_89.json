        "text": "OP\n\nTHF Trophy Hunter\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 5,513\n\nUSA's first medal, silver, comes in archery\n\nBy Jeff Metcalfe, The Arizona RepublicUpdated 13h 23m ago\n\nLONDON � It took a score of 10 by Italy's Michele Frangilli on the final arrow of Olympic men's team archery Saturday to turn a possible gold medal into silver for the USA.\n\nBy Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrady Ellison of the USA celebrates after a victory against South Korea in the men's archery semifinals on Saturday.\n\nEnlargeClose\n\nBy Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrady Ellison of the USA celebrates after a victory against South Korea in the men's archery semifinals on Saturday.\n\nSponsored LinksBut on balance, being the first U.S. medalists in the London Olympics and winning the first U.S. archery team medal since 2000 outweighs even the agony of a one-point loss, 219-218, at an almost full Lord's Cricket Grounds.\n\n\"I'm very excited to talk to you with a silver medal around my neck,\" world No. 1-ranked Brady Ellison said. \"I do believe there was a couple of chances with Jake (Kaminski) and (Jacob) Wukie both stepping up and shooting 10. If I would have shot 10 to back them up, it could have swung the match. But everything happens for a reason, and I'm really excited about the silver medal.\"\n\nBLOG: The latest from the London Olympics\n\nThe medal is the first for all three Americans, who lived and trained together in Chula Vista, Calif., in recent years under Kisik Lee, a former South Korean national team coach. Lee joined USA Archery in 2006 and, using biomechanical training, elevated the men from a 10th-place finish in the 2008 Beijing Olympics to the brink of a gold medal.\n\nItaly, silver medalists behind South Korea in 2000 and 2008, led by four points halfway through the 24-arrow final. Then Kaminiski and Wukie shot 10 to open the third end, but Ellison scored his only 8 in three rounds to temper the rally.\n\nThe USA trailed by one point going into the final three arrows. Kaminski shot 8, Wukie 10 and Ellison 9. Italy's Marco Galiazzo, the 2004 Olympic individual champion, hit 8 on two of his final three shots, so Frangilli needed 10 to avert a three-arrow tiebreaker.\n\n\"I felt incredible pressure,\" Frangilli said about his shot, which came close to landing outside the 10-point center of the target. \"I tried to empty my head and find my technique. I knew I hit the golden area. I've been chasing this for 16 years.\"\n\nThe USA flirted with missing out on a medal altogether after falling behind by two points halfway through its quarterfinal against Japan but rallied to win 220-219. In the semifinals against three-time defending gold medalist South Korea, the Americans hit 10 on seven of their final nine arrows to pull off a 224-219 upset.\n\n\"That's kind of how archery goes,\" Kaminski said. \"We always start off a little slow. We have the confidence we're going to finish and really drive it home at the end. Japan had an extreme advantage shooting a match and not having a bye. We couldn't read the wind, especially with these huge stands. It totally influences and changes everything.\"\n\nEllison, who is a native of Arizona and whose parents live there, joins a distinguished list of Olympic archery medalists with ties to the Grand Canyon State, including Rick McKinney (individual silver, 1984), Jay Barrs (gold, 1988) and Justin Huish (gold, 1996).\n\n\"I was happy with how I shot, but not so much in that gold medal match,\" said Ellison, 23, who starts individual eliminations Monday. \"I had a lot of arrows that felt really good and just missed. My last one (9) went off left, and I knew I needed that arrow to give us a little more pressure.\n\n\"This is the first (U.S.) medal of the Games. I do wish it could have been a different color, but I thank the Lord I got a silver medal and I'm blessed and fortunate to be here.\"\n\nJank Custom Knives\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2221263301484173/"
