Exhausted from the thrill of his individual gold medal the day before, Justin Huish came through again yesterday to help win another title in Stone Mountain, Ga.

On his last three arrows, the Californian erased a 3-point deficit for the United States, which went on to beat South Korea, 251-249, and win its first gold medal in the team event.

Italy won the bronze with a 247-244 victory over Australia. (AP)
