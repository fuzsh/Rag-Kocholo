Justin Huish (born January 9, 1975 in Fountain Valley, California) is an internationally known American archer. Growing up, his parents ran an archery pro shop, but Huish did not take up shooting until he was 14. He practiced by standing on a neighbor's lawn and shooting arrows across the street, through the front door of the garage, through the back door of the garage, and into a target in his backyard. When he was 15, he won his first local tournament. He made the U.S. archery team at 18.

Huish won gold medals in the men's individual and team competitions at the 1996 Summer Olympics. He had a somewhat dramatic appearance, with wraparound shades, a backward baseball cap, a ponytail, and an earring. His performance was later credited with encouraging Geena Davis to take up archery.

Justin Huish qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics, but withdrew after he was arrested for selling marijuana.
