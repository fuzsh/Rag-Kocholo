        "text": "Roger Daltrey is taking the Who's Tommy on tour – and Pete Townshend will not be joining him. The band's singer has announced a UK solo tour that will revisit the 1969 rock opera, enlisting Pete's younger brother, Simon Townshend, on lead guitar.\n\n\"Great to see Roger performing Tommy with his band in 2011,\" Pete Townshend said. \"It is wonderful to hear the way Roger and his new band re-interpret the old Who songs. I will be there in spirit, and Roger has my complete and most loving support.\"\n\nDaltrey has been performing solo, off and on, for years. He toured with Simon Townshend last year, calling his new band No Plan B. In March, No Plan B performed Tommy at Bournemouth's O2 Academy. They followed this up with a Teenage Cancer Trust gig, where Pete Townshend appeared as a guest on The Acid Queen and Baba O'Riley. Daltrey dedicated the gig to the Who's late bassist, John Entwistle. \"John always had the loudest voice,\" he said. \"He had the voice of an angel.\"\n\nThe Who's last performance was in March, performing Quadrophenia at the Royal Albert Hall. But while the band once planned a full Quadrophenia tour, this now seems unlikely. After performing at last year's Superbowl half-time show, Pete Townshend suggested the group might be coming to an end. The guitarist is suffering from partial deafness and serious tinnitus. \"I can't really see any way around the issue,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"If my hearing is going to be a problem, we're not delaying shows – we're finished.\"\n\nDaltrey's Tommy tour begins on 3 July at Alcester's Ragley Hall."
