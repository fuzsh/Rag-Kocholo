        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — A Rock & Roll Hall of Famer is heading to Indianapolis for a June 27 show that may surprise some of his fans.\n\nRoger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, is including the Murat Theater at the Old National Center in a 9-city tour through the Midwest and Northeast. It’s a short-but-frenetic schedule, with all the shows happening during two weeks in June.\n\nThe twist? It’s a “semi-acoustic” set, featuring far different, and undoubtedly quieter, versions of the hits that his band made famous.\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Guinness Book of World Records listed The Who as the “Globe’s Loudest Band,” for a 126db concert in London. The Who essentially retired the category — Guinness no longer recognizes it, saying the change happened out of concern that further “amping up” competition could lead to hearing damage. Guinness still does recognize The Who as the “First band to destroy their instruments.”\n\nFor the largely unplugged Indianapolis show, the promoter promises “Who gems, rarities, solo nuggets and other surprises.”\n\nDaltrey also plans to take questions from the audience during the shows.\n\nSome familiar names will join Daltrey as part of his touring band: Simon Townshend, the younger brother of founding Who guitarist Pete Townshend. Billy Nicholls, Jody Linscott, and Katie Jacoby have also toured with The Who in the past.\n\nIt will be Daltrey’s first time touring the United States since a series of 2022 concerts with The Who. The tour went through Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan, but skipped Indiana.\n\nDaltrey’s team is also touting his role in a new effort to raise money and awareness about teenage cancer.\n\nDaltrey played harmonica on a brand new version of “Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero),” composed by Mark Knopfler. The new edition, out this month, features dozens of famed musicians contributing their favorite instruments.\n\nThe release will go to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust, a cause Daltrey knows well as the co-founder, along with Pete Townshend, of Teen Cancer America. Daltrey also served as the curator for the Teenage Cancer Trust before stepping down earlier in 2024."
