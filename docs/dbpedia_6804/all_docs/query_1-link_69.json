        "text": "In this case, I have no opinion.\n\nSo I'm curious to hear when others think Daltrey was at his vocal best!\n\nNever really thought about it, as his voice held together pretty well as he aged. Maybe Quadrophenia? \"The Real Me\" and \"Love Reign O'er Me\" are prime examples.\n\nLikewise, never thought about it because he has always sounded great to me. Even on their last studio album, I thought, yeah this guy still has it.\n\nBut if we are going to pick a moment then it's that scream. I think you know the one I mean!\n\nIn terms of power - 1973\n\nIn terms of technique? 2023 summer tour\n\nThat's good he is (and I think its reflective of how much respect he pays to his vocal chords)\n\nThe exact peak of Roger’s entire vocal career was 3:50 into “You Better You Bet”.\n\n“I know I’ve been wearing crazy clothes… and I look pretty crappy sometimes!”\n\nHe always was good. Still is. I'd say that his peak all things considered was around 1970-1973. Subsequent 1970s albums were muddy in its sound and the songwriting wasn't as good.\n\nHe probably sang as well as he was ever going to sing for the WHO ARE YOU album, so I put it post-QUADROPHENIA.\n\nHe did stay strong for a long time.\n\nPrior to Tommy (1968-69) his vocals were good, but a bit underutilized. Tommy, Live at Leeds and (especially) Who’s Next, Daltrey’s dynamic singing was taken up to the next level.\n\nWho’s Next is his best vocal performance album in my opinion\n\nTo be honest, I think he is the most constant Who members. He is very good from beginning to end (1978. The rest is not really the Who).\n\nSo I'd say around Sell Out but that's mainly because that's my favourite Who album. But I still think Tattoo is his best vocal performance. It takes guts and talent to show such vulnerability.\n\nYou're livin' in the past, man! You're hung up on some singin' from the 60s, man!\n\nI would have to agree with those who say Quadrophenia. \"Love, Reign O'er Me\" has to be his best vocal on record, he's reaching heights he never had before, and never would again."
