        "text": "Would Mr. Daltrey really go back to the Who if his solo album was a smash-hit? He seems sure of it in this article, but is there some indication to the contrary in what he says between the lines? I`m not sure.\n\nRead on and do your own evaluation of this.\n\nWho does what in the Who?\n\nSolo Daltrey talks to Tony Stewart\n\nWHAT’S HAPPENED to the Who? Pete SHOULD be writing and recording for the Who. John Entwistle SHOULD be concentrating on the Who’s future, but he’s too busy with Rigor Mortis and solo albums. Now I hear Roger Daltrey’s working on a solo album. So come on lads, get together and let’s have a new album and a tour.\n\nThat’s an extract from a reader’s letter.\n\nBut Roger Daltrey is quite resolute. “Christ,” he spits, “I’m all for the Who, crikey. First I thought about any problems a solo set might involve if it was successful, but I can’t see it creating any. I wouldn’t have done it if I thought there were.”\n\nRock’s stage matador pauses, and as he contemplates his next statement he glances over the grounds of his Sussex house. “John’s done solo albums,” he continues, “and it hasn’t made any difference. The Who have never had a front man or anything — we’re all just individuals anyway. I don’t think it can really make any difference at all.”\n\nInvariably the petty bitching begins when an established band member decides to make his own album. But in the case of the Who, a good few people will claim that the solo activities are just a consequence of the band taking a long lay-off – which doesn’t really answer anything.\n\nThe question should be: How will all this benefit the band? Rather than: Isn’t it going to detract? Because it isn’t too presumptious to claim that neither Daltrey nor Entwistle are the creative core of the Who, but Townsend is.\n\nRoger considers their extended holiday as a time to relax and find new interests.\n\n“I’ve been doing so much, little things,” he says: “And it’s so nice to do them. To have a year off is a great thing.” He recalls: “When I worked in a factory I used to say, ‘If I can make it and have a year off I’m going to bloody enjoy myself — and I have.”\n\nPart of that enjoyment has been his album, which came together over five weeks during January and February.\n\nDaltrey says: “It just came out of the ‘Tommy’ thing with Lou Reizner, and it was good to learn something about singing outside the group. That’s the only reason, and it’s as simple as that.\n\n“I’d like it to be a successful album, but that still wouldn’t make me a solo artist. I’d still be coming from within the Who.\n\n“If anything, it’s going to help the Who — that’s how I see it. Because I’ve learned a lot about singing that I would never have learned with the Who.\n\n“But,” and he smiles, “I think Pete’d only be too pleased if the album wasn’t successful.”\n\nHe is apparently aware of the risk of a Rod-and-the-Faces situation arising, however improbable it is.\n\n“I don’t think it could happen,” he decides. “Like I say it happens to them because on his albums he plays the same music that the Faces play. I don’t know why they bother to make records really. Theirs sound exactly the same as his.\n\n“Also there’s the fact that Rod made it before the Faces, which was a very awkward position — the Faces come from around Rod Stewart, rather than Stewart coming from within the Faces. I don’t think I could stand that situation, I’d ‘ate to have that.\n\n“I only did it when the Who weren’t working anyway. Now we’ve just been getting ready to start our new album… and hopefully that’ll put me back into the Who — and I’ll know more about me and about different ways of singing. It can only help.”\n\nBut why is it that our vocalist has decided after nearly a decade within the Who to step out and show himself at this stage.\n\nQuite simply, he replies: “I don’t think I’ve been a good enough singer up until recently. In ‘Tommy’ I sang something that really meant something for the first time.\n\n“Now I have a completely different outlook to singing. Before I was just a mad rocker. I still am at heart, but that’s the Who part.\n\n“That was another big problem with the album. I mean, rock ‘n’ roll is a huge part of my main love in music, and I can’t do it on my own. If I did a rock ‘n’ roll album it’d be like the Who. So that was part of the difficulty.\n\n“That’s why I used orchestrations. And I love orchestras. I really do. Plus the fact” — and he snorts a laugh —”there’s not much else you can use.\n\nDURING THE PAST few years Daltrey has been considered one of rock’s finest singers. So he must be sensitive to the critical response to “Daltrey” when it’s released in mid-April.\n\nWell, I’ve heard Daltrey’s album and its easily one of the finest this year. With songs by Leo Sayer and Dave Courtney, and the production of Adam Faith, there is now a document of Daltrey’s character – something unusual, considering he doesn’t write himself. But several of the cuts can be seen as biographical. Especially the opener, which presents him as a busker — or according to the title, “One Man Band”.\n\n“I think all musicians are sort of one-man bands,” he explains, “with all their frustrations, and what they want to do. That’s basically the theme of it — and that’s how the writers saw me.\n\n“They wrote it for me, they really did. We talked for months. I had really long discussions with Terry (Faith) and Dave about all the problems involved.\n\n“Jokingly I said to Dave: `Why don’t you write me a bleeding album?’ A week later he knocked on the door with all the demos. He literally went home and wrote it in a week. Five weeks later we finished the album. That’s how quick it was.” Already a few eyebrows will be raised querying the talents of Faith as a producer. But dear Budgie accomplishes anything he sets his mind to — and this is no exception. However. Roger has been producing Ellis, so why, why didn’t he produce himself? The reason, he says is that he needs directing by somebody not inextricably involved in the singing. And he believes the Who also need a producer for the same reason. “Not for sound quality,” he points out concerning the Who’s case.” That became incredible. But just little things we’d overlooked. Some of the new stuff we’ve done — and this is why we’re getting a producer back in — sounds great, but when you listen to it, is it really the Who? “There’s no mad Moon drumming, it’s all a bit too clean. That’s why you need a producer, because we’ll be involved with it concerning the total sound, but you need somebody else there who’ll say: `Where’s Moon’s crazy drumming?’\n\nSo you lose part of the band’s character.\n\n“You tend to, yes. Another thing,” he elaborates. “We need a producer because we waste such a lot of time in the studios.\n\n“If you learn a song the first take is usually the best one. You go on routining and routining, and sure it gets musically a bit better, and it gets tighter, but it loses something else.\n\n“It doesn’t need to be that tight. It needs to be as tight as we are, but we’re pretty tight even when we’re loose. But if you get it overtight and overclean it stops being the Who.”\n\nHowever we return to our original theme of this album not detracting from the Who. He says that only if the Who quit road-work will he form a band — “but we ain’t going to,”he states irrevocably.\n\n“Because I really want to get the Who back on the road. I love working with the Who. If I can just make two albums like this a year, and they do reasonably well, I’ll be ‘appy.\n\n“Maybe if the Who come off the road again, like they have done for the last year, then I might go on the road with a band. But just as long as the Who don’t suffer.\n\nAs the Who near completion of their Battersea, London, studios – “we’ve got a lead coming out of the back of the Battersea Power Station,” Daltrey jokes — with Townshend mid-way through writing the next album, which they insist will be a concept album to equal the standard of “Tommy”, the band have tour plans for late this year. So the chance of Daltrey touring alone is remote.\n\n“We’re all keyed up to have two years of really grafting like we used to, Daltrey says. “We’d better get going soon, or we’ll be too bloody old.”\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.
