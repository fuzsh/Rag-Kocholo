At one point listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's loudest band, the Who was known for their riotous performances, but also for their innovations in the still relatively young genre of rock. In 1969 they released the first-ever rock opera, Tommy, about a deaf, blind, and mute pinball champion, and over the years the Who's songs \"would do as much for the acceptance of rock music as a valid art form as the Beatles did,\" Jeff Miers noted in the Buffalo News. Even though Townshend wrote the Who's lyrics, the band's original manager, Chris Stamp, told Peter Castro of People that \"I think Townshend's voice as a writer would never have been heard without Roger's interpretation. . . . I don't think Pete has that sensibility of carrying off those characters he creates. I think Pete understands that because in his solo stuff he never gets to that 'self' that is so clear when he's writing for Roger. It only jells when he knows that voice is coming out of Roger's mouth.\"\n\nFor most of his professional life Daltrey has sung songs written by others—usually Townshend—but as he established himself as a solo artist in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during the Who's multiple apparent break-ups, Daltrey began to collaborate with other songwriters in creating lyrics for his own songs. \"I'm a very strict taskmaster when it comes to lyrics, because I have sung the best in rock 'n' roll,\" Daltrey told Craig Rosen of Billboard, referring to Townshend's lyrics for the Who. Because he was so used to excellent lyrics, Daltrey explained, it took him many years to be satisfied with his own writing efforts; it wasn't until his 1992 album Rocks in the Head that he thought he had it right. After that, he told Rosen, \"My ambition totally in life is to write a hit song [for the Who].\" That did not happen, since The Who never recorded another album after that, but Daltrey and the other surviving members of the band continued to tour together intermittently into the twenty-first century.\n\nWhen Daltrey isn't singing, he can often be found acting. In addition to his numerous film and television roles, which have ranged from a rock star to the king of the fairies, he also played Scrooge in the Madison Square Garden's stage production of A Christmas Carol in 1998. \"I have no regrets [about my career] at all,\" Daltrey told Denis Hamill in the Buffalo News. \"I think I've made the most of what small talent I have. I've been incredibly lucky. Looking back, I've won the lottery every day of my life.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nbooks\n\nContemporary Musicians, Volume 3, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1990.\n\nContemporary Theatre, Film, and Television, Volume 34, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2001.\n\nGammond, Peter, The Oxford Companion to PopularMusic, Oxford University Press (Oxford, England), 1991.\n\nNeill, Andy, and Matt Kent, Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere: The Complete Chronicle of the Who, 1958-1978, forewords by Roger Daltrey and Chris Stamp, Sterling Publishing (New York, NY), 2002.\n\nStrong, Martin C.
