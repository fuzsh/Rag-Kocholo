        "text": "Whether classic rockers or crooners, 80-year-old performers are not usually in the business of mining new territory. And why should they, especially if there’s a decades-long body of work filled with unquestioned fan favorites to be leaned on?\n\nRoger Daltrey apparently didn’t get that memo.\n\nAt the outset of his concert Tuesday night, June 25, at the Meadow Brook Amphitheatre — one of just 11 the Who frontman is playing in this month in North America — Daltrey told the boomer-dominated crowd that the show was “a great kind of experiment. It’s always been a dream of mine to do something different than the Who.” That was indeed the case over the course of nearly two hours as Daltrey and his facile nine-piece band offered a wide-ranging survey of his career and his musical range, playing the favorites — yes, in a different way — and digging deep, including some surprising and heartfelt cover songs.\n\nThe result was as illuminating as it was entertaining, an organic and authentic presentation that, unlike the maelstrom that is the Who, gave Daltrey a great deal of room to explore and deliver even the most well-worn material with fresh, and refreshed, perspective. The acoustic-based instrumentation also gave him more room to sing with nuance and not have to compete with arena-sized amplification.\n\nNowhere was this truer than the ensemble’s version of the Who’s epic “Won’t Get Fooled Again.” Having boasted that there were “no synths in this band, none whatsoever” on stage, the song’s electronic tattoo was recreated with violin (Katie Jacoby) and accordion (Geraint Watkins) for a warmer-sounding rendition that still retained the song’s propulsive energy.\n\nAnd, as promised before the tour, Daltrey coached the crowd through the tunes’ famed, throat-shredding scream rather than doing it himself.\n\nThe rest of the night was filled with similar delights — from the get-go. After noting that “it’s wonderful to be back in Michigan. Michigan was the first place where a radio station played a Who record,” Daltrey — sporting a long-sleeved aquamarine T-shirt, jeans, sneakers and sunglasses — launched the 20-song set with Who mate Pete Townshend’s “Let My Love Open the Door,” commenting afterward that “it’s a shame that wasn’t a Who song.” A spirited cover of Largo’s “Freedom Ride” underlined Daltrey’s own feeling of creative liberation, while “Who Are You” felt both faithful and fresh, and looser, amidst the expanded, acoustic-based instrumentation.\n\nThere was plenty of Who throughout the night, from A-list hits such as “Substitute,” “Squeeze Box” and “Baba O’Riley” (again led by Jacoby’s violin) to more obscure fare like “Naked Eye” and “Tattoo.” For “The Kids Are Alright,” meanwhile, Daltrey added a new verse that addressed issues of aging and mortality but also gratitude for having reached this station in life still virile enough to perform. The group also played “Going Mobile” from 1971’s “Who’s Next,” which Daltrey said the band had never played live and was sung by guitarist Simon Townshend, Pete’s younger brother and, like Jacoby, a mainstay in the Who’s touring band.\n\nDaltrey’s solo work was sampled via “After the Fire,” Leo Sayer’s “Giving It All Away” and “Waiting For a Friend” from the “McVicar” film soundtrack, written by band member Billy Nichols. Daltrey paid warm tribute, too, to fellow artists he admires — Paul Simon with his “The Boy in the Bubble” and John Fogerty with Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Have You Ever Seen the Rain,” lauding that band’s performance as his favorite at the original Woodstock festival 55 years ago.\n\nDaltrey was in a chatty mood throughout the night, too — sometimes gleefully cantankerous but certainly honest as he spoke about the late Keith Moon’s addition to the Who and about the prospects for that band touring again. “I can’t’ really answer that question,” he said, adding that Pete Townshend’s various proclamations about the Who’s future leave him “confused.” “I’m not saying no. I’m not saying yes. I just want (Townshend) to turn up,” Daltrey explained.\n\nHe did, however, bemoan his “bloody big mouth” decision to have fans submit questions to be read and answered on stage.\n\n“Little did I know how many would come in, and how boring they would be,” he groused early on. He dismissed most — though Who aficionados were likely intrigued that he no longer speaks to longtime touring keyboardist John “Rabbit” Bundrick after a “rather large falling out.” Daltrey’s most complete answer was about the inspiration for the song “Early Morning Cold Taxi” from “The Who Sell Out” album in 1967; “In those days nobody had cars,” Daltrey explained. “A taxi got us from whatever woman’s house you ended up in to whatever dump you lived in…After warm bed, the taxi seat was very cold.”\n\nThe troupe finished the night with a ferocious take on Mose Allison’s “Young Man Blues,” a onetime Who staple that, Daltrey lamented, has fallen out of the band’s repertoire. Hey may be a proverbial old dog these days, but Daltrey showed on Tuesday that it doesn’t keep him from finding some new tricks.\n\nRoger Daltrey moves outside of the Who with latest solo tour"
