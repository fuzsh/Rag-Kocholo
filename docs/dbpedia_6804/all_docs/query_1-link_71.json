        "text": "One of the great music events in New Jersey each summer is the British Invasion Festival in Atlantic City. The free one-day event on the deck of the Golden Nugget casino, which this year took place on Saturday, July 20, featured three top notch tributes to some of Britain’s best music: Beatles tribute Britain’s Finest, Slow Hands Band, The Music of Eric Clapton and Who tribute Who’s Next. While it was the same line-up as in 2023, each band once again shined!\n\nUnlike last year when I almost missed it, British Invasion Festival had been on my radar screen for the past couple of months. When the time came last Saturday morning, I was more than happy to motor south, travel my way, take the highway that’s the best to get my kicks on Garden State Parkway – well, it doesn’t rhyme, but I guess you get my point! Following are some highlights I captured.\n\nKicking off the event were Britain’s Finest. Founded in Los Angeles in 2011, the band’s current lineup includes Jay Nixon (as Paul McCartney), Ruben Amaya (as John Lennon), Robert Bielma (as George Harrison) and Brendan Peleo-Lazar (as Ringo Starr). Their set focused on songs The Beatles played during their touring years between 1962 and 1966. Some of the tracks included Please Please Me, I Want to Hold Your Hand, I Should Have Known Better, I Feel Fine and Roll Over Beethoven. Here’s set opener From Me to You, the third single by The Beatles, released in April 1963 and their first to top the UK singles chart.\n\nHere’s another sample of Britain Finest: All My Loving, off With the Beatles, the lads’ second UK album from November 1963. The song also appeared separately as a single in Canada where it became their third chart topper after She Loves You and I Saw Her Standing There.\n\nThen it was time for Slow Hands Band. The Eric Clapton tribute came together in March 2018 when the Ramblin Dawgs, an original blues rock band from New Jersey, added two members. Their impressive current line-up features Carlos “CDawg” DC (lead guitar, lead vocals), Steven Raphel (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Matt Ali (slide guitar), Dennis Matusche (keyboards), Kenneth Thorstenson (bass) and Raul Diaz Cobo (drums), along with Erica Taylor (background vocals) and another talented background vocalist. They kicked off their set with Tell Me the Truth by Derek and the Dominos, a short-lived English-American blues rock band formed in the spring of 1970. The song was included on the group’s sole studio album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.\n\nIn addition to other Derek and the Dominos classic like Bell Bottom Blues and Layla, Slow Hands Band also touched on Clapton’s solo period and his time with Cream, a band I’ve loved for many moons. I captured and was tempted to post Sunshine of Your Love, but I already featured their rendition of the song in last year’s post. As such I decided to go with another classic, popularized by Cream: Crossroads. Originally titled Cross Road Blues, it was written and recorded by Delta blues guitarist Robert Johnson. Cream included their version, arranged by Clapton, on their third album Wheels of Fire, a combined studio and live album that came out in June 1968 in the U.S., followed by the UK in August of the same year.\n\nRounding out the British Invasion Festival were Who’s Next. This longtime Who tribute band from Long Island, New York, who I’ve seen several times over the past 6 to 8 years, features Bill Canell (as Pete Townshend), Doug Zahn (as Roger Daltrey), Will Shelley (as John Entwistle) and Rich Savarese (as Keith Moon). Once again, Who’s Next blew the roof off the place. Here’s their set opener I Can’t Explain, the first single The Who released under their name in December 1964. In case you’re wondering, their debut was Zoot Suit, which they put out under the name The High Numbers in July of the same year.\n\nThe set of Who’s Next also included other classics, such as Who Are You, Bargain, Pinball Wizard, Love, Reign o’er Me and Won’t Get Fooled Again. And the epic Baba O’Riley, the final track I’d like to highlight in this post. The song first appeared in August 1971 on The Who’s fifth studio album Who’s Next. It also became a single in Europe in October of the same year.\n\nAm I planning to be back next year? You better, you better, you bet!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Britain’s Finest website; Slow Hands Band website; Who’s Next website; YouTube\n\nIt’s Wednesday and I hope this week has been kind to you so far. Once again, the time has come to take a closer look at another song I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date.\n\nOne of my longtime favorite bands are The Who. Since I’ve already covered many of their popular songs, I decided to pick a tune that outside of fan circles is less widely known: Anyway Anyhow Anywhere.\n\nMore casual listeners, who are primarily familiar with classics like My Generation, Pinball Wizard and Won’t Get Fooled Again, probably find Anyway Anyhow Anywhere sounds a bit underwhelming. However, not only is it a pretty good early tune by the English rock band, but it also has some intriguing aspects.\n\nTo start with, the song that first appeared as a non-album single in the UK in May 1965 was co-written by guitarist Pete Townshend and lead vocalist Roger Daltrey. Most of the group’s tunes were solely penned by Townshend. Anyway Anyhow Anywhere also represents one of the first songs using guitar feedback. According to Wikipedia, it was the first to use the effect in the guitar solo.\n\nThe use of feedback throughout the song was crucial, Townshend stated. He explained The Who “were trying to achieve the sound which we get on the stage at present, all in a commercial song that will sell.” Speaking of live, here’s a great clip of the tune, captured in 2000 at London’s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nAnyway Anyhow Anywhere was the second single The Who released under that name and their third overall. The debut, Zoot Suit/I’m the Face appeared under their initial name The High Numbers. Anyway Anyhow Anywhere became their second top 10 single in the UK, reaching no. 10. It also made the top 40 in France, climbing to no. 38. But unlike its predecessor, I Can’t Explain, it missed the charts in the U.S. and in Australia. Anyway Anyhow Anywhere was subsequently included on the October 1971 singles compilation Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy.\n\nIn the liner notes of that album, Townshend recalled the following about the tune: Roger Daltrey helped a lot with the final arrangement and got half the credit. Something he does today for nothing, bless him. I was lying on my mattress on the floor listening to a Charlie Parker record when I thought up the title. (It’s usually title first with me.) I just felt the guy was so free when he was playing. He was a soul without a body, riding, flying, on music.\n\nListening to the compulsory Dizzy Gillespie solo after one by Bird was always a come-down, however clever Gillespie was. No one could follow Bird. Jimi Hendrix must have been his reincarnation, especially for guitar players. The freedom suggested by the title came restricted by the aggression of our tightly-defined image when I came to write the words. In fact, Daltrey was really a hard nut then, and he changes quite a few words himself to toughen the song up to suit his temperament. It is the most excitingly pig-headed of our songs. It’s blatant, proud and, dare I say it, sassy.\n\nThe studio recording was the first by The Who, which featured Nicky Hopkins on piano. At the time, Hopkins was a session musician. Widely considered to be one of the greatest studio pianists in the history of popular rock music, Hopkins worked with many other artists, particularly The Rolling Stones, playing on all of their studio albums from Between the Buttons (1967) through until Tattoo You (1981), except for Some Girls (1978).\n\nFollowing are some additional insights by Songfacts:\n\nLike many early songs by The Who, “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” captures the band enjoying the unfettered freedom of youth: they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, wherever they want. Pete Townshend, who wrote the lyric, described it as “anti-middle age, anti-boss class, and anti-young marrieds.”\n\nThis was The Who’s second single, following “I Can’t Explain.” Their producer at the time was Shel Talmy, who could wrangle a lot of noise into something coherent. After “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” was released, the group made their first album with Talmy: My Generation. The title track to that one was another feat of controlled chaos and a defining hit for the band, but The Who had their manager, Kit Lambert, produce their next one, breaking their contract with Talmy and setting off a legal battle that ended up giving Talmy royalties on every Who recording into 1971.\n\nThis contains one of the first uses of feedback on a record. The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey recalled to Uncut magazine October 2001: “We were doing this feedback stuff, even before that. We’d be doing blues songs and they’d turn into this freeform, feedbacky, jazzy noise. Pete was getting all these funny noises, banging his guitar against the speakers. Basically, the act that Hendrix is famous for came from Townshend, pre-‘I Can’t Explain.'”\n\n“‘Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere’ was the first song when we attempted to get that noise onto a record and that was a good deal of time before Hendrix had even come to England,” Daltrey continued. “The American pressing plant sent it back thinking it was a mistake. We said, ‘No, this is the f—ing noise we want. CUT IT LOUD!'”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nSometimes the brain or whatever I have inside my skull works in mysterious ways. Until Saturday early in the morning, I completely had forgotten about the British Invasion festival in Atlantic City. Suddenly, the one-day event at the Golden Nugget popped up in my head and I thought, ‘dang it, I probably missed it!”Luckily, it was happing later on that very day, and I’m happy to share some impressions!\n\nAs the name suggests, the annual event focuses on British music that took America by storm starting in the mid-’60s. Of course, The Beatles were instrumental in popularizing British acts in the U.S. when their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964 changed the music world forever. Appropriately, their music was featured in Atlantic City, delivered by a fun tribute band called Britain’s Finest. There were also two other great tribute groups: Who’s Next (can you guess the band?) and Slow Hands, a tribute to Mr. Slowhand, Eric Clapton.\n\nSaturday was the third or fourth time I made the trip from central New Jersey down to Atlantic City for this festival. And while it’s a bit of a hike, based on my previous experience, I was reasonably sure I wouldn’t take much of a gamble here! Like in the past, the nine-hour live music marathon on the deck of the Golden Nugget kicked off at around 2:00 pm. Each tribute act got to play an afternoon and an evening set. This post covers the evening gigs.\n\nSince the aforementioned appearance of The Beatles on Ed Sullivan is considered to mark the beginning of the British Invasion, appropriately, Britain’s Finest were the first act. Founded in Los Angeles in 2011, the band’s current lineup includes Jay Nixon (as Paul McCartney), Ruben Amaya (as John Lennon), Robert Bielma (as George Harrison) and Brendan Peleo-Lazar (as Ringo Starr). Even though the lads are Americans, they do a lovely job imitating the British accents by John, Paul, George and Ringo. How about the music? Here’s their neat rendition of Please Please Me.\n\nWell, let’s shake it up, baby, now with one more tune: Twist and Shout, a perfect set closer!\n\nI guess it takes many hands to cover the music by Eric Clapton and Slow Hands do a nice job with it. This eight-piece from Freehold, N.J. has been around for about five years. They include Carlos DC (lead guitar, lead vocals), Steven Raphel (rhythm guitar, background vocals), Matt Ali (slide guitar), Dennis Matusche (keyboards), Kenneth Thorstenson (bass) and Raul Diaz Cobo (drums), along with Erica Taylor (background vocals) and another talented background vocalist. Here’s the neat opening of their set, a one-two punch of Cream’s Sunshine of Your Love and Eric Clapton’s Motherless Children – my kind of music!\n\nClosing out this fun evening were Who’s Next, an amazing tribute I’ve seen on various occasions over the past six years or so. They’ve been around for a long time and currently feature Bill Canell (as Pete Townshend), Doug Zahn (as Roger Daltrey), Will Shelley (as John Entwistle) and Rich Savarese (as Keith Moon). Meet the new boss, same as the old boss! If you don’t recognize these iconic lines, let the music do the talking. It won’t fool ya!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Britain’s Finest website; Slow Hands Facebook page; Who’s Next website; YouTube\n\nHappy Wednesday and welcome to another installment of Song Musings where I take a closer look at tunes I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. Today, I’m happy to explore You Haven’t Done Nothin’ by Stevie Wonder, one of my longtime favorite artists.\n\nWritten by Wonder, You Haven’t Done Nothin’ first appeared on his 17th studio album Fulfillingness’ First Finale, which came out on July 22, 1974. It also was released separately on August 7 as the record’s first single.\n\nThe funky song featured background vocals by The Jackson 5 who prompted by Wonder sang the “Doo da wops” in the chorus. The politically aware tune became Wonder’s fourth no. 1 hit in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 and his tenth to top the Hot Soul Singles, which today is known as the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\nExcept for the bass, which was supplied by Reggie McBride, Wonder played all instruments on the recording, including Hohner Clavinet, hi-hats, crash cymbal, keyboard horns and drum programming. The use of the Hohner Clavinet is reminiscent of Superstition, one of Wonder’s signature tunes that had come out in October 1972. Here’s a great live version. Doo da wop, baby!\n\nFulfillingness’ First Finale is the fourth of five albums of Wonder’s so-called classic period, which arguably marked the high point of his career. In contrast to the predecessor Innervisions, which was focused on social consciousness, Fulfillingness’ First Finale overall projected a more reflective, personal and decidedly somber tone.\n\nFulfillingness’ First Finale was Wonder’s second album to hit no. 1 on the Billboard 200 and his third in a row to top the Soul LPs chart, which today is called Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. It yielded Wonder his second prestigious Album of the Year in a row and two other Grammys in March 1975 at the 17th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nFollowing are some additional tidbits from Songfacts:\n\nThis song is an angry, acidic attack on US President Richard Nixon, who two weeks after the release of Fufillingness’ First Finale resigned over the Watergate scandal and left the White House in disgrace. Shortly after Nixon’s resignation, Wonder issued this statement: “Everybody promises you everything but in the end, nothing comes out of it. I don’t vote for anybody until after they have really done something that I know about. I want to see them do something first. The only trouble is that you always hear the president or people say that they are doing all they can. And they feed you with hopes for years and years. I’m sick and tired of listening to all their lies.”\n\nWonder recorded this song at The Record Plant in Los Angeles. Around this time, he would keep a studio booked if he was in the New York or Los Angeles area, and work when inspiration struck, which could come at very odd times since he wasn’t controlled by daylight.\n\n…Robert Margouleff and Malcolm Cecil, who guided Wonder’s work at the time, were the engineers and associate producers on the album. Margouleff recalls Michael Jackson showing up with a tutor, and a party atmosphere when the Jackson 5 did their vocals. “Everyone was so blown away with the harmonies they did,” he said.\n\n…1974 was a strange and turbulent year in America, with the Watergate scandal dominating headlines, but riots in Boston and the acquittal of Ohio National Guardsmen who shot students at Kent State University also making news. This song reflected the outrage and anger many Americans were feeling. It was not just a #1 R&B hit, but also topped the Hot 100, the only politically charged song to do so that year. Other #1s that year were far more lightweight lyrically. They include “Seasons In The Sun,” “Kung Fu Fighting” and “(You’re) Having My Baby.”\n\nThere is some serious lyrical dissonance in this song, as the biting lyrics are accompanied by upbeat music. Wonder explained: “The best way to get an important and heavy message across is to wrap it up nicely. It’s better to try and level out the weight of the lyrics by making the melody lighter. After all, people want to be entertained, which is all right with me. So if you have a catchy melody instead of making the whole song sound like a lesson, people are more likely to play the tune. They can dance to it and still listen to the lyrics and hopefully think about them.”\n\nThe Who singer Roger Daltrey covered this for his 2018 solo album As Long As I Have You. [I reviewed the album here at the time – CMM] Daltrey told Billboard that recording the song gave him an opportunity to express his frustrations with the state of the world.\n\n“It felt right for where we are politically around the world at the moment,” he explained, “because there’s so much frustration with the state of our nations and the politics. There’s an incredible anger out there, and all it is anger. It seems to be very unfocused. It just feels like we don’t seem to be moving on from where we are in the ’70s, when that song was written, so I sang it with a little more anger than I think Stevie ever sang it. But the lyrics apply just as much today as they did then.”\n\nThe title is a pretty egregious double negative, literally meaning you have done something, the opposite of what’s intended. “You Haven’t Done Anything” would be correct.\n\nIt’s far from the first hit song that’s a double negative: “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” is a classic example.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nWelcome to another installment of The Sunday Six! Hope you join me on my first musical excursion in September 2022.\n\nDelicate Steve/Looking Glass\n\nUsually, I like to kick off this recurring feature with jazz, which for some reason seems to be a natural fit for a Sunday, especially during the morning. But it’s also good to shake up things every now and then. So here’s my first proposition for today: Delicate Steve, the stage name of American multi-instrumentalist Steve Marion, who has been active since 2010. His sound has blended elements of progressive rock, folksy twang, African rhythms, surf rock and 1970s pop. Marion is a sought after artist, having collaborated with the likes of The Black Keys, Paul Simon and Tame Impala. Looking Glass is a great-sounding track from Marion’s latest album After Hours released July 8. According to his website, it was “written and recorded on a 1966 Fender Stratocaster that reignited his love for the instrument.”\n\nThe Kinks/Living On a Thin Line\n\nAfter a cool guitar instrumental, the next stop on our trip are the ’80s. If you’re well familiar with my music taste, you may be a bit surprised I picked a tune by The Kinks. After all, I’ve said more than once that while they are among my favorite British bands, I particularly dig their ’60s output. That’s still the case, but there are exceptions. One is Living On a Thin Line. Written by Dave Davies, the tune is from The Kinks’ 21st studio album Word of Mouth, which appeared in November 1984. Man, I love it! Are we going to see a reunion of The Kinks? “We’ve been talking about it,” Ray Davies told The Washington Post in January 2021. “I mean there’s a lot of material and, you know, it could still happen.” Now, you really got me!\n\nBob Dylan/Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\n\nHow do you move from ’80s Kinks to ’60s Bob Dylan? To borrow from a famous ad for sneakers, ‘just do it!’ The year is 1966. In May of that year, Dylan released his seventh studio album Blonde on Blonde, which I think is fair to say is widely considered to be among his best records. His accolades include the induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999 and a no. 38 ranking in the most recent 2020 update of Rolling Stone’s list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Here’s the terrific opener Rainy Day Women #12 & 35. I just love the sound of the raucous brass band, which is a perfect match to the line, Everybody must get stoned!\n\nDolly Parton, Emmylou Harris & Linda Ronstadt/After the Gold Rush\n\nDolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt are three artists I’ve really come to appreciate over the past five years or so. Bringing big acts together for an album doesn’t guarantee a successful outcome, but I feel in this case it worked – for the second time! The case is Trio II, the second collaboration album by these dynamite ladies, which came out in February 1999. While the songs had been recorded in 1994, seven years after the appearance of Trio, it actually took 12 years for these renditions to be released. Why? Label disputes and conflicting schedules. Whatever the reason, this record was worth the wait. Here’s one of my all-time favorites: After the Gold Rush, a tune written by Neil Young who first recorded it as the title track of his third studio album from September 1970. The angelic harmony singing gives me goosebumps every time I listen to the tune. This is so beautiful that it can make me well up!\n\nThe Doors/Roadhouse Blues\n\nOkay, it’s time to shake off the goosebumps and kick it up a few notches with a great blues rocker by The Doors. Roadhouse Blues, written by Jim Morrison with the music credited to the band, is the opener of their fifth studio album Morrison Hotel released in February 1970. In case you’d like to read more about the record, fellow blogger Music Enthusiast recently covered it. Songfacts notes, When Jim Morrison got drunk, he liked to sing blues numbers at The Doors jam sessions. This [is] one of the songs he came up with at one of those inebriated sessions. Interestingly, Road House Blues also appeared separately as the B-side to the album’s only single You Make Me Real. Don’t get me wrong: I dig you You Make Me Real. I just find it surprising Road House Blues was a B-side. In my humble opinion, it would have deserved release as its own A-side single. Ladies and gentlemen, from Los Angeles, California, The Doors!\n\nRoger Daltrey/As Long As I Have You\n\nOnce again, the time has come to wrap up another Sunday musical excursion. For this last tune, we return to the current century and Roger Daltrey. I trust the longtime lead vocalist of The Who needs no further introduction. What perhaps you may be less aware of is Daltrey’s tenth solo album As Long As I Have You, which came out in June 2018. The soulful record was Daltrey’s first solo effort in 26 years. In September 2015, Daltrey was diagnosed with viral meningitis during The Who Hits 50! North American tour, forcing the band to reschedule the remaining dates until 2016. This almost led Daltrey to scrap his solo album, for which he already had eight tracks. When his longtime partner in crime Pete Townshend heard the songs, he encouraged Daltrey to finish the project. Townshend also offered to play guitar on it. For more information, you can check my review I published at the time. I’ll leave you with the title track, a cover of a tune first released by American soul singer Garnet Mimms in 1964. It was co-written by Bob Elgin and Jerry Ragovoy. Check out Daltrey’s killer voice!\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist featuring all of the above tunes. Hope you find something you dig!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Delicate Steve website; The Washington Post; Songfacts; YouTube; Spotify\n\nOnce again it’s time for tough decisions, decisions. The letter “d” in my music library revealed artists I’ve featured repeatedly here like Roger Daltrey, Dion, Deep Purple, Dire Straits and The Doors, to name some. And then there’s Donovan who by comparison I’ve covered less, so Donovan Phillips Leitch shall be the chosen one for my weekly desert island exercise.\n\nWhile I can’t claim to be a Donovan expert, I can safely say I know more than two songs by the Scottish singer-songwriter, so I actually had to make a true decision which one to pick. If memory serves me right, Colours and Universal Soldier were the first two Donovan tunes I encountered. At the time, I was actively playing acoustic guitar and taking lessons. Especially Colours with its three chords was easy to learn, even if you didn’t have the skill set of a Jose Feliciano or Paul Simon – and I didn’t, not even at my best!\n\nBack to the task at hand, which is answering the existential question, if I had to move to a desert island and could only take one Donovan song, which one would I pick? I decided to go with Sunshine Superman. I’ve always loved how this tune combines folk, blues and psychedelic music. It also turned out there’s a back story behind the song I had not been aware of.\n\nDonovan wrote Sunshine Superman in response to the break-up with Linda Lawrence at the end of 1965. After the couple had dated for a short time, Lawrence, the former girlfriend of Rolling Stones founding member Brian Jones, ended the relationship, not wanting to repeat getting the attention of being a music artist’s girlfriend.\n\nSunshine Superman first appeared as a single in July 1966, leading up to Donovan’s third studio album with the same title, which was released the following month, except for the UK. The tune became his first big hit and his only song to top the Billhoard Hot 100 in the U.S. Due to a contractual dispute, the single didn’t appear in the the UK until December 1966. The album was pushed back as well until September that year. Sunshine Superman (the single) still did pretty well, climbing to no. 8 of the Offical Singles Chart. Sunshine Superman also proved to be popular in Australia (no. 4), The Netherlands (no. 2) and Germany (no. 7).\n\nFollowing is how Donovan played Sunshine Superman in January 2007 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles. This is taken from a DVD, Donovan: Live in L.A. at the Kodak Theatre, which appeared in January 2008. It’s a more funky version – not bad!\n\nWhat else is there to say? Let’s take a look at Songfacts:\n\nIt’s not a normal love song, the singer told Mojo magazine June 2011. “On the face of it, the song is about being with Linda again. But sunshine is a nickname for acid. The Superman is the person capable of entering higher states because it’s not easy to go into the fourth dimension and see the matrix of the universe in which everything is connected. The line, ‘everybody’s hustling’ referred to the pop scene at the time, where you could lose yourself very easily. Gyp (Mills – Donovan’s lifelong friend and tour manager) would always keep my feet on the ground; we had left home at 16 to busk so we could see fame for what it is.”\n\nDonovan was good friends with The Beatles, and they were both making very innovative and trippy music at the time. Donovan’s producer Mickie Most told him not to play the Sunshine Superman album to Paul McCartney under any circumstances, because he knew McCartney would be tempted to do something similar.\n\nDonovan recalled to Uncut magazine: “My arse was being sued by Pye after Sunshine Superman so, my masterwork, sat on the shelves for seven months. If you date it, it was at least a year and a half before Sgt Pepper and I remember Mickie saying to me, ‘Don’t play it to McCartney’ but of course everybody was sharing with everyone else and nicking from each other.”\n\n“I played it to McCartney anyway,” he continued. “But they were already there, anyway, and George Martin was doing something similar with The Beatles, working out arrangements from ideas they had in their heads. George Martin was The Beatles’ guy and John Cameron was my guy and they both had an appreciation of jazz which was key.” Originally, the “Sunshine Superman” single was subtitled “For John And Paul,” a reference to Lennon and McCartney.\n\nA few additional tidbits:\n\nA busy session guitarist called Jimmy Page played lead guitar on the recording of Sunshine Superman.\n\nSunshine Superman is considered to be among the first overtly psychedelic pop songs.\n\nApparently, the tune made The Beatles’ video for A Day in the Life, in which it supposedly can be seen to spin on a turntable. Of course, the nerd in me had to check it out. While there is very brief footage of a spinning record around the 4:00 minute mark, frankly, I find it impossible to name it. Perhaps you need to be on a controlled substance to see it! 🙂\n\nThe trippy clip also features other music artists like Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull. At around 38 seconds, there’s a guy on the left side, who could be Donovan, though I’m not sure – again, a mind-enhancing pill might help! 🙂\n\nThe story behind Sunshine Superman had a happy end. In October 1970, Linda Lawrence became Donovan’s wife, and they remain together to this day. How many other music artists can you name, who have been married for 50-plus years?\n\nDonovan, now 75 years old, is still active and maintains a website, where you can listen to his most recent single Gimme Some of That, which came out in October 2021.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; Donovan website; YouTube\n\nThe most famous line-up of my all-time favorite band The Beatles existed from August 1962 until September 1969 when they collectively recorded their last song appropriately titled The End, the final track of the Abbey Road album – not a bad duration for a band, given the music business oftentimes is dominated by larger-than-life egos. Yet as productive as The Fab Four were, these seven years look pretty moderate compared to the groups featured in this post, who have been rocking for more than 40 years – in one case even reaching 60 years!\n\nFollowing are three criteria a band needed to satisfy to be considered for the post. They need to have at least one remaining original member. A group’s duration was measured in terms of active years, not how long they have been together on paper. For example, while Deep Purple were founded in 1968, they “only” have played together for 48 years, not 54 years, if you consider their break-up between 1976 and 1984. Last but not least, I solely included bands I like.\n\nFollowing I’m highlighting six groups in chronological order of when they were founded with one tune from each. A Spotify playlist at the end of the post includes those tracks, plus songs from a few additional bands meeting the above criteria. Altogether, I decided to include 10 picks. Let’s get to it.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nThe Rolling Stones, formed in 1962, have been active for an incredible 60 years, making them the longest-running band on this list. With Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, they still have two original members who have been key to the group. It’s also noteworthy that Ronnie Wood has been part of the line-up since 1975. Sadly, the Stones lost their long-time drummer Charlie Watts last August. He had joined them back in 1963. To date, the Stones have released 30 studio albums, 33 live records and 29 compilations, among others. On November 23, 2021, they finished their most recent tour (No Filter Tour) in Hollywood, Fla. Here’s Jumpin’ Jack Flash, which first appeared in May 1968 as a non-album single.\n\nThe Who\n\nApproximately two years after the Stones, in 1964, another dynamite British rock band was formed: The Who. Like their compatriots, the group has two original and essential members to this day, guitarist Pete Townshend and lead vocalist Roger Daltrey. Counting various breaks along the way, The Who have been active for 50 years. Their catalog includes 12 studio albums, 16 live recordings and 32 compilations, among others. Just on Monday this week, The Who announced a 2022 North American tour, The Who Hits Back, scheduled to kick off on April 22 at Hardrock Live in Hollywood, Fla. – the very same venue where the Stones wrapped up their tour last year. Messrs. Daltrey and Townshend and their band are playing New York’s Madison Square Garden on May 26 – damn, this is tempting! Here’s Going Mobile from my favorite Who album Who’s Next.\n\nDeep Purple\n\nOn to my favorite hard rock band of all time, Deep Purple, who were initially established in 1968. One of the founding members, drummer Ian Paice, remains part of the group’s current formation. Two additional present members, bassist Roger Glover and lead vocalist Ian Gillan joined in 1969, and as such were part of the group’s classic line-up that also included guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and organist Jon Lord. Deep Purple’s discography encompasses 22 studio albums, 45 live records and 28 compilations. The band is also touring this year starting in May, mostly in Europe. Here’s the epic Child in Time, a track from their fourth studio album Deep Purple in Rock released in June 1970 – the first to feature the classic line-up.\n\nAerosmith\n\nThe bad boys from Boston were formed in 1970. Remarkably, four of the group’s current five members are co-founders: Steven Tyler (lead vocals, harmonica, percussion), Joe Perry (guitar, backing vocals), Tom Hamilton (bass) and Joey Kramer (drums, percussion). Second guitarist Brad Whitford joined in 1971. While Perry and Whitford, respectively, had five and three-year interruptions in-between and missed the 1982 Rock in a Hard Place album, Tyler, Hamilton and Kramer have played on all of the band’s 15 studio records to date. Aerosmith’s catalog also includes six live records and 16 compilations. On January 31, the group announced the cancellation of their European tour that had been planned for June and July, citing uncertainty around the pandemic. Here’s Janie’s Got a Gun, one of my favorite Aerosmith tunes off their 10th studio album Pump, released in September 1989.\n\nAC/DC\n\nAustralian rock and rollers AC/DC have been around since 1973. Not counting their hiatus between 2016 and 2020, this amounts to 45 years. Lead guitarist Angus Young remains as the only founding member. There are three other longtime members: Phil Rudd (drums), Cliff Williams (bass, backing vocals) and Brian Johnson (lead vocals), who first joined the band in 1975, 1977 and 1980, respectively. AC/DC’s catalog features 17 studio albums, three live records and two box sets, among others. Here’s Play Ball, a great track from the group’s 16th studio album Rock or Bust that appeared in November 2014, featuring all of the above members.\n\nU2\n\nThe last group I’d like to highlight in this upfront section of the post are Irish rockers U2 who were formed in Dublin in 1976 under the name Feedback. It’s the only band on this list whose current members were all co-founders. That being said, their present line-up is not the group’s initial formation, which during their first year also included a second guitarist, Dik Evans, the older brother of David Evans known as The Edge. U2’s other members are Paul Hewson (Bono), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums). To date, the band’s discography consists of 14 studio albums, one live record and three compilations, among others. U2 were most recently on the road in 2019 for the second part of The Joshua Tree Tour. I caught one of the shows during the first part of that tour in 2017 – my only U2 concert so far, and a memorable experience! Here’s Red Hill Mining Town, a track from my favorite U2 album The Joshua Tree that came out in March 1987.\n\nFollowing is the aforementioned Spotify list.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; The Who website; Deep Purple website; Aerosmith website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWelcome to a new Sunday Six and another hot weekend, at least in my area of Central New Jersey. This is the latest installment of my recurring weekly feature that celebrates music I love in different flavors and from different periods, six tunes at a time.\n\nIn some cases, my picks are songs that I earmarked over the course of the week. On other occasions, the posts are coming together pretty spontaneously at the last minute. This one predominantly falls into the latter category. I’m happy with the way it turned out. Hope you find something in here you dig!\n\nColin McLeod/Old Soul (featuring Sheryl Crow)\n\nStarting this week’s set is Colin McLeod, a Scottish singer-songwriter and farmer I had not heard of until yesterday. McLeod got my attention when I spotted a clip on Facebook, featuring a song he recorded with Sheryl Crow and included on his new album Hold Fast, which was released on June 18. The mellow atmospheric tune spoke to me right away – I love these types of coincidences! For a bit of additional background, here’s an excerpt from his Apple Music profile: Raised on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of Scotland’s Outer Hebrides archipelago, MacLeod amassed a wide array of influences, from regional folk and pop to widescreen Springsteen-esque rock, before leaving the island in 2009 to test his mettle as a performer. An A&R scout from Universal caught one of MacLeod’s gigs in Aberdeen, which resulted in the release of his debut album Fireplace, which he issued under the moniker Boy Who Trapped the Sun in 2010. The experience left a bad taste in his mouth, so, exhausted and homesick, he returned to the Isle of Lewis, where he spent his days raising sheep and growing crops. It proved to be a fortuitous move. Inspired by the sights, sounds, smells, and stories of his remote part of the world, MacLeod was able to parlay those experiences into his music, culminating in the release of the acclaimed Ethan Johns-produced Bloodlines, his first collection of songs to be issued under his own name. McLeod’s new album is his sophomore release. Old Soul was written by him. Call me crazy, I can hear a bit of Bono in his voice. I also think his vocals beautifully blend with Sheryl Crow’s.\n\nBuddy Guy/Kiss Me Quick (featuring Kim Wilson)\n\nOn to some great electric guitar blues. Yes, it’s quite a leap. But you see, that’s the thing about The Sunday Six – it can be arbitrary. If you’re into the blues and see the names Buddy Guy and Kim Wilson, you know you’re in for a treat. What can I say about the amazing Buddy Guy? He’s the last man standing from the old Chicago blues guard, who played with the likes of Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf and Little Walter. Guy who is turning 85 in July is a force of nature. I’ve been fortunate to see him live twice over the past five years. Wilson, of course, is best known as the lead vocalist and frontman of blues rockers The Fabulous Thunderbirds. I’d love to see these guys as well! So what do get when combining the two artists? A nice blues shuffle titled Kiss Me Quick that appeared on Guy’s 17th studio album appropriately titled Born to Play Guitar, which won the Grammy for Best Blues Album in 2016. The tune was co-written by Richard Fleming and producer Tom Hambridge. Makes me want to listen to the entire bloody album!\n\nThe Who/The Real Me\n\nLet’s kick things up a notch with The Who and The Real Me. Why pick the second track from side one of Quadrophenia? To begin with, The Who’s sixth studio album from October 1973 is one of the gems in their catalog. Another reason why I chose this particular tune is John Entwistle and his outstanding bass work. As a former hobby bassist, perhaps I pay closer attention and get a little bit more excited about bass runs than some other folks. All I can tell you is this: Seeing The Ox with The Who at New York’s Madison Square Garden in 2001 was an unforgettable event. In typical fashion, Entwistle was standing pretty much motionless on one side of the stage, while Pete Townshend launched from one windmill attack to the other, Roger Daltrey engaged in impressive lasso acrobatics with his microphone, and Zak Starkey (yep, Ringo Starr’s son) was working that drum kit. It was really something else! Sadly, Entwistle passed away about six months after that show in Las Vegas, the day before The Who were scheduled to kick off their 2002 U.S. tour. He was only 57 years old – what a loss!\n\nSeals & Crofts/Summer Breeze\n\nTime to slow things down again. And since summer is in full swing, here’s one of the warmest sounding tunes I can think of in this context: Summer Breeze by Seals & Crofts. Every time I hear this song, it puts me at ease. Behind the soft rock duo were multi-instrumentalists James Eugene “Jim” Seals and Darrell George “Dash” Crofts. Summer Breeze, the title track of their fourth studio album from September 1972, probably is their best known song. It peaked at no. 7 and no. 6 on the U.S. and Canadian mainstream charts, respectively. The album marked their commercial breakthrough. Seals & Crofts also scored two other hits: Diamond Girl (1973) and Get Closer (1976). Unlike Summer Breeze, I had to sample these tracks to remember them. Then the hits stopped, and in 1980, after their record company had dropped them, Seals & Crofts decided to go on hiatus. They have since reunited a few times. There are also younger torch bearers. Wikipedia notes in 2018, Jim Seals’ cousin Brady Seals and Darrell Crofts’ daughter Lua Crofts began touring as Seals and Crofts 2, performing Seals & Crofts music as well as some originals.\n\nThe Zombies/She’s Not There\n\nThe first time I heard She’s Not There was the cover by Santana from their excellent 1977 Moonflower album. Since it certainly sounds very much like a Carlos Santana tune, I simply assumed it was their song. Only years later did I find out She’s Not There was written by Rod Argent, the keyboarder of The Zombies. The tune first appeared in the UK in July 1964 as the British rock band’s debut single. Two months later, it came out in the U.S. She’s Not There was also included on The Zombies’ debut album. In this case, the self-titled U.S. version was first out of the gate in January 1965. The U.K. edition, titled Begin Here, appeared in April that year. As was common at the time, there were some differences between the two versions. After the breakup of The Zombies in 1969 and a couple of impersonating bands, Argent and original lead vocalist and guitarist Colin Blunstone reunited in 2000, moved to the U.S. and recorded an album, Out of the Shadows, released in 2001. Starting from 2004, they began touring again as The Zombies. There have also been three additional albums since, released under the name Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent/The Zombies. The most recent one, Still Got That Hunger, appeared in October 2015. The band is still around. Ticketmaster currently lists some gigs for 2022.\n\nGregg Allman/My Only True Friend\n\nThe time has come again to wrap up things. My final pick is by Gregg Allman. He and The Allman Brothers Band were a very late discovery for me. Fortunately, it happened just in time to see them once in New Jersey on their very last tour in 2014, a couple of months before their final curtain at the Beacon Theatre in New York. After exploring the band, I also got into Gregg Allman’s solo catalog. I particularly dig Low Country Blues from January 2011 and his final album Southern Blood, which I got on vinyl. It came out in September 2017, four months after Allman had passed away at the age of 68 due to complications from liver cancer. Even though I had only become fond of his music a few years earlier, his death really moved me. I still get emotional about it. There was something very special about Gregg Allman when he was singing and hitting those keys of his Hammond B3. I can’t quite explain it. Here’s Southern Blood’s opener My Only True Friend, the sole track on the album that was co-written by Allman. The other writer was Scott Sharrad, lead guitarist and musical director of Allman’s backing band. You can read more about the album here.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Apple Music; YouTube\n\nOne thing I love about music blogging is how much I learn about artists I didn’t know or only had heard of by name. Oftentimes, I find myself stepping through one door only to find many others I’ve yet to open. Frankly, I probably would have run out of ideas a long time ago, if it were any different! Plus, I’d get bored if I only wrote about music and artists I know.\n\nThe latest example is Bettye LaVette, a versatile vocalist who has been active since 1962. I included her in two previous posts, most recently on Saturday in a piece about artists who have covered songs by The Rolling Stones. LaVette’s great rendition of Salt of the Earth led me to take a closer look at the album that includes her version of the tune. I was quickly intrigued by what else I found on Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook, which was released in May 2010. Her soulful, at times somewhat fragile voice reminds me a bit of Tina Turner and is right up my alley.\n\nWhile LaVette enjoyed some chart success early in her career, for decades, she was more of a cult figure in soul circles. At least in part that was due to bad luck with record labels. After LaVette recorded what was supposed to become her first full-length album Child of the Seventies, Atlantic Records decided not to move forward with the project, apparently without giving her any explanation. In 1982, Motown’s Lee Young, Sr. signed LaVette to the storied label, which led to the recording of her first released album Tell Me Lie. However, following a corporate shake-up, Young was removed, the label never promoted LaVette’s record, and it failed to chart.\n\nFast-forward to 2000 when a French collector and label owner called Gilles Petard discovered the tapes for the aforementioned Child of the Seventies album in Atlantic Records’ vaults. He liked what he heard, licensed the tracks and released them under the title Souvenirs in France on his Art & Soul label. Around the same time, Let Me Down Easy – In Concert, a live recording of LaVette in the Netherlands, appeared on the Dutch label Munich. The two near-simultaneous releases created new interest in LaVette as a recording artist and resulted in a contract with label Blues Express.\n\nIn January 2003, LaVette released A Woman Like Me, only her third full-length studio album. It won the W.C. Handy Award in 2004 for Comeback Blues Album of the Year and the Living Blues critic pick as Best Female Blues Artist of 2004. LaVette’s recording career was finally going somewhere. She has since released eight other studio albums and won additional awards, including a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation (2006), Blues Music Award for Best Contemporary Female Blues Singer (2008), Distinguished Achievement Award from The Detroit Music Society (2015) and Blues Music Award for Best Soul Blues Female Artist from The Blues Foundation (2016). LaVette is also in the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame and has been nominated three times for a Grammy.\n\nLaVette is an unusual artist. According to her website, she is no mere singer. She is not a song writer, nor is she a “cover” artist. She is an interpreter of the highest order. Bettye is one of very few of her contemporaries who were recording during the birth of soul music in the 60s and is still creating vital recordings today. This certainly becomes obvious when listening to Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook, which brings me back to the album. Let’s get to some intriguing interpretations!\n\nThe opener is a funky version of The Word by The Beatles. While the John Lennon–Paul McCartney co-write, which was included on the Rubber Soul album from December 1965, is barely recognizable, I find LaVette’s take pretty cool. It’s got a bit of a James Brown vibe, and I can almost hear his “uhs” in the background.\n\nHow about some Led Zeppelin reimagined? Here’s All My Love, a song I’ve always dug. Co-written by John Paul Jones and Robert Plant, the tune first appeared on Zep’s eighth and final studio album In Through the Out Door released in August 1979. Check this out – damn!\n\nLet’s move on to Pink Floyd and Wish You Were Here. The title track of their ninth studio album from September 1975 was co-written by David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Who would have thought a Floyd track could ever sound so soulful!\n\nNights in White Satin is one of my favorite songs by The Moody Blues. Written by Justin Hayward, the track appeared on Days of Future Passed, one of the most beautiful concept albums of the ’60s. Here it is in Bettye LaVette style – amazing!\n\nLet’s do two more. First up is another great funky rendition: Why Does Love Got to be So Sad by Derek and the Dominoes. Co-written by Eric Clapton and Bobby Whitlock, the tune appeared on the band’s sole studio album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs from November 1970. Groovy!\n\nLast but not least, here is the closer Love, Reign O’er Me, a highlight on the album. It captures LaVette’s unedited live performance during the Kennedy Center Honors in December 2008 in tribute to Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, who were among the honorees that year. Townshend wrote the tune for The Who’s sixth studio album Quadrophenia that came out in October 1973. Here’s the actual footage from the Kennedy Center. Messrs. Daltrey and Townshend almost seem to have a Led Zeppelin moment. Check this out. This is friggin’ intense!\n\nInterpretations: The British Rock Songbook, which appeared on U.S. label Anti-, was co-produced by Rob Mathes, Michael Stevens and LaVette. It reached no. 1 on the U.S. Billboard’s Top Blues Albums, staying in that chart for 39 weeks. The album also enjoyed some mainstream success in the U.S., climbing to no. 56 on the Billboard 200. Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook became one of the three aforementioned Grammy nominations for LaVette.\n\nThanks to great images on Discogs, I was able to look at the album’s liner notes that reveal some interesting things about LaVette’s approach to interpretations. “I never think of a song as a record,” she is quoted. “I think of songs as songs. I don’t think of a Rolling Stones recording. I think of the Rolling Stones singing this song and now I’m going to sing it. That helps me tremendously…There’s no process of ‘how can I make this different.’ I hear it immediately differently. It’s very hard for another singer to satisfy me. No matter where a singer went with the vocal, if I can think of somewhere else to go, then wherever they went no longer interests me.”\n\nIn addition to the vocal approach, LaVette also took artistic freedom with the lyrics, which she changed significantly on a number of songs. “I think the most difficult thing about putting the album together was that many of the words didn’t make sense to me,” she said. “These songs belong to white fans who are now in their fifties…The biggest hang-up was I didn’t want to disrespect them because I knew that there are people who have altars built to many of these songs…When I got into them I realized there were things worth saying but I had to make them things I could sing about.”\n\nSo what do some of the artists who wrote the original songs think of LaVette’s renditions? Following are some quotes from a sticker on the CD’s jewel case. Again, I have Discogs to thank for featuring some great images. “A great record. Put me in the Bettye LaVette fan club” (Keith Richards). “Bettye is reinventing and reclaiming a soul singing tradition all at once” (Pete Townshend). “Bettye is blessed with an instantly recognizable voice full of power & emotion” (Steve Winwood). “Bettye has recorded an amazing version of ‘Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me'” (Elton John).\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Discogs; YouTube"
