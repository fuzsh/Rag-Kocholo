        "text": "Here`s a great one done by Tony Stewart with Mr. Daltrey, being almost as outspoken as ever. But only just.\n\nRead on to find out more!\n\nThe Who: triumph and a threat\n\nIt happened to The Beatles, but it won`t affect The Who. And Roger Daltrey now prepares to do three years hard labour.\n\nReport: Tony Stewart\n\nROGER DALTREY lives in Sussex, away from it all in a house you could lose an elephant in. The grounds are so vast that he can point into the horizon — and you’re still not sure whether his land goes further than the natural boundary you can see. You get there by train, arriving at a tranquil country station, and then riding along narrow high-hedged lanes in a Range Rover.\n\nOn our particular visit it was hot. So hot that Daltrey wore only a brief pair of white jeans cut at the knees, displaying a fine, bronze physique, as we wandered around the gardens of his estate.\n\nIt is the country, and a most convivial place to rap. To do so we sat on the lawn, which is decorated with a miniature tinkers caravan. However, amid this idyllic setting, there is a note of realism. Daltrey has been mixing concrete, and that means preparing for the rigours of the road. It helps him get fit, he says.\n\nOur conversation developed naturally through the subjects of his own solo work, the new Who concept album, Ken Russell’s film version of “Tommy”, and three years hard labour for the band, and Daltrey displayed all the enthusiasm of a man going back to the work he loves — performing.\n\nHe’d also displayed some misgivings about the Who’s business affairs.\n\n“I’m giving you a scoop here,” he said, “but I’ve got to speak out for once.”\n\nHowever, after the interview he decided he didn’t want to wash all the dirty linen on a public washing line.\n\nWhat he did say was: “The Who’s suffered, and we’re starting to suffer internally, which really is bad”. And that’s enough to indicate all is not well.\n\n“This is what worries me,” he continued. “It’s happened to the Stones and the Beatles, and it’s the same bloody problem”.\n\nBut to clarify his point, he added: “Oh, I’m not worried about the music. It hasn’t altered anything within the group as far as I feel towards playing is concerned. That’s one good thing about the Who, whereas it wasn’t with the Beatles. There’s no chance of anything changing there at all,” he emphasised, “we’re completely solid on that.”\n\nIt’s best to leave it at that, so concentrating on Daltrey, the Who and their music. On a happier note, this piece could quite easily be subtitled what the Who did on their holidays.\n\nThe word holiday is used quite loosely, even though Daltrey — as he sits chewing grass — displays a nifty shade of brown on his torso. Right enough, they’ve relaxed, but the band have not been totally idle these past two years.\n\n“It’s not really been inactivity y’know, there’s been a lot going on,” he explains. “We just felt we had to have that time off to re-think. I think it’s paid off with the new music we’ve done. It definitely has come together as being new.\n\n“Hopefully, once we get the new stuff on stage we’ll be able to forget what we used to do, or at least a lot of what we used to do, we’ll just keep the good bits and get rid of all the rubbish.\n\n“You can only do this type of thing after having a couple of years off away from what you’re doing,” he explains. “By working every night we just kept our old bad habits.\n\n“So we’ll wait and see. But I’m very optimistic and really pleased. Musically we’re stronger now than we’ve ever been. And as far as getting back on the road is concerned, we’ve never been more definite about anything.\n\n“Like I say,” and a mischievous grin creases his face, “we’ve had a lot of other problems.” He allows himself a knowing chortle.\n\nDaltrey went on to emphasise that the Who’s volume of productivity doesn’t match their volume of sound. And he feels their critical discrimination is quite strict.\n\n“The Who don’t just go in and record ten songs for an album ’cause we need an album.\n\n“Every album has been far more than that. And that’s why we’ve been waiting for the time when we would release something really worth releasing. It’s here now, and by Christ it’s worth releasing.\n\n“We’re not like Slade, or even the Stones come to that, who can just go in and make a whole load of songs and release them. We don’t thrive on that sort of scene. That’s why we do find it difficult these days to get singles.\n\n“We,” he continues, “work hard to make records and make them into more than just a piece of plastic and songs.”\n\nThe Who’s new single, “5.15” is released this week and shortly there’s the double album “Quadrophrenia”.\n\nDALTREY’S personal success recently has been his solo album, the single from it — “Giving It All Away” — and then “I’m Free” from Reizner’s production of “Tommy”.\n\nBut Daltrey, who still possesses his harsh London accent and amiable working-class characteristics, still underrates his own ability — and this seems due to lack of self-confidence rather than feigned modesty.\n\nSpeaking of “I’m Free” he says: “I don’t think it’s the people who are acquainted with ‘Tommy’ who have bought the single. I get the feeling that it’s a lot of old ladies — who like it because it sounds like ‘Big Country’ in the middle. And that terrifies me.\n\n“But if anything, its a success because of the lack of Who material.”\n\nThat logic, however, doesn’t tie in with the fact that bassman John Entwistle’s solo endeavours weren’t so well accepted.\n\nDaltrey disagrees. “John made the mistake of having faith enough to dish up his album and say ‘there it is, release it’, which is what I wasn’t prepared to do. Instead of John’s album being properly launched like ours, it fell out the door.”\n\nGoing back to his own success, he continues: “It had to be big,” he stresses, reasoning: “There I was, the singer with the Who. I could have kept cosily within the four members and had a cosy little ride all the way along, but I was putting my balls on the line — so I wanted it to sell, mate. There would’ve been no point having it come out, and do as John’s things do, just sit there. Not that that’s any fault of his.\n\nNOW DALTREY intends to record a follow-up set when he has the time.\n\nHe says: “I’ve written one song of my own and it’s given me a lot of confidence. I hope to find more of a direction on the next one.\n\n“I’ll make it between the Who tours and the “Tommy’ film and everything else — because the Who are going to be working a helluva lot in the next 18 months.\n\n“See, it’s difficult. I think it’d be a mistake to become too — err, what’s the word? — too ambitious at the moment. Because that would start to distrupt the Who.\n\n“I’d hate to get into the situation Rod Stewart had with the Faces. It’s a bloody shame really.\n\n“If the Who are working every day for the next three years, there won’t by any Daltrey albums – don’t worry about that. And that suits me fine. I don’t want to get too ambitious about it.”\n\nNOW, WHAT about the Who’s “Quadrophrenia” album. What is it like musically, I inquire?\n\n“Phenomenal. It really is. I mean Pete’s writing is,” he’s at a loss for superlatives.\n\n“There’s no doubt who is the best rock ‘n’ roll writer after listening to this one. It really is amazing.\n\n“If you want to know the real simple story,” he eventually says of Townshend’s concept, “he goes to the seaside and comes back again.”\n\nDaltrey laughs and buries his nose in a mug of tea.\n\n“Maybe that’s completely wrong, because I haven’t heard it put together. But it’s like `Tommy’, in that I didn’t know what that was about until it had been out about three months.” Chris Stainton played on the sessions, but otherwise it’s basically a group album. Then there’s the “5.15” single. “It’s one of the best Who singles since ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’. And it’s probably the most commercial since ‘Pinball Wizard’ — a really tough rocker, with a lot of the old Who in it. It’s the same with the album, he says. “Who’s Next” got a bit flat and became linear. Although it’s got a helluva lot more on top of it than `Who’s Next’ — in the form of synthesisers and brass and that this new one is stronger than ever.\n\n“But this one’s really got the old Who back. It’s got the clarity and good recording of `Who’s Next’… but it’s got the old `My Generation’ Who there.\n\n“I’ll play you a bit later,” he said, confidentially, “I’ll give you a little preview.\n\n“I can’t explain it… Pete’s writing has gone a whole way past lyrics, and is improving in arrangement.\n\n“A lot of the things that went on in the past — like ‘Tommy’ and that — were cut as rough songs and arranged in the studio by the group, with ideas from the group.\n\n“But now the songs have arrangements around them, and we couldn’t make them better. It’s a whole different way of working. When you hear it you’ll know what I mean.’\n\nI heard two impressive tracks in Daltrey’s barn-studio, and I agree. As well as returning to the old rock ‘n’ roll underlay, the arrangements still hum of grandeur, not unsimilar to “Tommy”.\n\nRather conveniently, this brings us to the film of the rock-opera, which will be directed by Ken Russell. In January the band, with Daltrey, as a 16-year-old Tommy, start the soundtrack, and in April shooting begins.\n\n“I think Ken Russell can make ‘Tommy’ bigger than it’s ever been,” Daltrey states dogmatically. “It means a lot to a lot of people, but it didn’t sell that many records, especially in Britain.\n\n“If Russell can get it over to a lot more people, good luck to him, because I think it says a helluva lot more than ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’. Making a film makes ‘Tommy’ immortal, and that’s as far as I ever want to go. At least it’ll be finished then.”\n\nAs a final question, I couldn’t resist asking Daltrey if he fancied being a film star?\n\nHe laughed.” I’ll be in a film, and hopefully a successful film, but it doesn’t make you a film star.”\n\nNo, but it makes you a hard grafter.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nWould Mr. Daltrey really go back to the Who if his solo album was a smash-hit? He seems sure of it in this article, but is there some indication to the contrary in what he says between the lines? I`m not sure.\n\nRead on and do your own evaluation of this.\n\nWho does what in the Who?\n\nSolo Daltrey talks to Tony Stewart\n\nWHAT’S HAPPENED to the Who? Pete SHOULD be writing and recording for the Who. John Entwistle SHOULD be concentrating on the Who’s future, but he’s too busy with Rigor Mortis and solo albums. Now I hear Roger Daltrey’s working on a solo album. So come on lads, get together and let’s have a new album and a tour.\n\nThat’s an extract from a reader’s letter.\n\nBut Roger Daltrey is quite resolute. “Christ,” he spits, “I’m all for the Who, crikey. First I thought about any problems a solo set might involve if it was successful, but I can’t see it creating any. I wouldn’t have done it if I thought there were.”\n\nRock’s stage matador pauses, and as he contemplates his next statement he glances over the grounds of his Sussex house. “John’s done solo albums,” he continues, “and it hasn’t made any difference. The Who have never had a front man or anything — we’re all just individuals anyway. I don’t think it can really make any difference at all.”\n\nInvariably the petty bitching begins when an established band member decides to make his own album. But in the case of the Who, a good few people will claim that the solo activities are just a consequence of the band taking a long lay-off – which doesn’t really answer anything.\n\nThe question should be: How will all this benefit the band? Rather than: Isn’t it going to detract? Because it isn’t too presumptious to claim that neither Daltrey nor Entwistle are the creative core of the Who, but Townsend is.\n\nRoger considers their extended holiday as a time to relax and find new interests.\n\n“I’ve been doing so much, little things,” he says: “And it’s so nice to do them. To have a year off is a great thing.” He recalls: “When I worked in a factory I used to say, ‘If I can make it and have a year off I’m going to bloody enjoy myself — and I have.”\n\nPart of that enjoyment has been his album, which came together over five weeks during January and February.\n\nDaltrey says: “It just came out of the ‘Tommy’ thing with Lou Reizner, and it was good to learn something about singing outside the group. That’s the only reason, and it’s as simple as that.\n\n“I’d like it to be a successful album, but that still wouldn’t make me a solo artist. I’d still be coming from within the Who.\n\n“If anything, it’s going to help the Who — that’s how I see it. Because I’ve learned a lot about singing that I would never have learned with the Who.\n\n“But,” and he smiles, “I think Pete’d only be too pleased if the album wasn’t successful.”\n\nHe is apparently aware of the risk of a Rod-and-the-Faces situation arising, however improbable it is.\n\n“I don’t think it could happen,” he decides. “Like I say it happens to them because on his albums he plays the same music that the Faces play. I don’t know why they bother to make records really. Theirs sound exactly the same as his.\n\n“Also there’s the fact that Rod made it before the Faces, which was a very awkward position — the Faces come from around Rod Stewart, rather than Stewart coming from within the Faces. I don’t think I could stand that situation, I’d ‘ate to have that.\n\n“I only did it when the Who weren’t working anyway. Now we’ve just been getting ready to start our new album… and hopefully that’ll put me back into the Who — and I’ll know more about me and about different ways of singing. It can only help.”\n\nBut why is it that our vocalist has decided after nearly a decade within the Who to step out and show himself at this stage.\n\nQuite simply, he replies: “I don’t think I’ve been a good enough singer up until recently. In ‘Tommy’ I sang something that really meant something for the first time.\n\n“Now I have a completely different outlook to singing. Before I was just a mad rocker. I still am at heart, but that’s the Who part.\n\n“That was another big problem with the album. I mean, rock ‘n’ roll is a huge part of my main love in music, and I can’t do it on my own. If I did a rock ‘n’ roll album it’d be like the Who. So that was part of the difficulty.\n\n“That’s why I used orchestrations. And I love orchestras. I really do. Plus the fact” — and he snorts a laugh —”there’s not much else you can use.\n\nDURING THE PAST few years Daltrey has been considered one of rock’s finest singers. So he must be sensitive to the critical response to “Daltrey” when it’s released in mid-April.\n\nWell, I’ve heard Daltrey’s album and its easily one of the finest this year. With songs by Leo Sayer and Dave Courtney, and the production of Adam Faith, there is now a document of Daltrey’s character – something unusual, considering he doesn’t write himself. But several of the cuts can be seen as biographical. Especially the opener, which presents him as a busker — or according to the title, “One Man Band”.\n\n“I think all musicians are sort of one-man bands,” he explains, “with all their frustrations, and what they want to do. That’s basically the theme of it — and that’s how the writers saw me.\n\n“They wrote it for me, they really did. We talked for months. I had really long discussions with Terry (Faith) and Dave about all the problems involved.\n\n“Jokingly I said to Dave: `Why don’t you write me a bleeding album?’ A week later he knocked on the door with all the demos. He literally went home and wrote it in a week. Five weeks later we finished the album. That’s how quick it was.” Already a few eyebrows will be raised querying the talents of Faith as a producer. But dear Budgie accomplishes anything he sets his mind to — and this is no exception. However. Roger has been producing Ellis, so why, why didn’t he produce himself? The reason, he says is that he needs directing by somebody not inextricably involved in the singing. And he believes the Who also need a producer for the same reason. “Not for sound quality,” he points out concerning the Who’s case.” That became incredible. But just little things we’d overlooked. Some of the new stuff we’ve done — and this is why we’re getting a producer back in — sounds great, but when you listen to it, is it really the Who? “There’s no mad Moon drumming, it’s all a bit too clean. That’s why you need a producer, because we’ll be involved with it concerning the total sound, but you need somebody else there who’ll say: `Where’s Moon’s crazy drumming?’\n\nSo you lose part of the band’s character.\n\n“You tend to, yes. Another thing,” he elaborates. “We need a producer because we waste such a lot of time in the studios.\n\n“If you learn a song the first take is usually the best one. You go on routining and routining, and sure it gets musically a bit better, and it gets tighter, but it loses something else.\n\n“It doesn’t need to be that tight. It needs to be as tight as we are, but we’re pretty tight even when we’re loose. But if you get it overtight and overclean it stops being the Who.”\n\nHowever we return to our original theme of this album not detracting from the Who. He says that only if the Who quit road-work will he form a band — “but we ain’t going to,”he states irrevocably.\n\n“Because I really want to get the Who back on the road. I love working with the Who. If I can just make two albums like this a year, and they do reasonably well, I’ll be ‘appy.\n\n“Maybe if the Who come off the road again, like they have done for the last year, then I might go on the road with a band. But just as long as the Who don’t suffer.\n\nAs the Who near completion of their Battersea, London, studios – “we’ve got a lead coming out of the back of the Battersea Power Station,” Daltrey jokes — with Townshend mid-way through writing the next album, which they insist will be a concept album to equal the standard of “Tommy”, the band have tour plans for late this year. So the chance of Daltrey touring alone is remote.\n\n“We’re all keyed up to have two years of really grafting like we used to, Daltrey says. “We’d better get going soon, or we’ll be too bloody old.”\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

We rarely see artists speaking so freely of their earnings these days, or at all. A top roadie, as mentioned in the article, was earning a fair amount of money as £70-a-week is the same amount as £944 these days (2020). Not too bad if you didn`t have any expenses towards hotels, travel or food.\n\nRead on!\n\nDaltrey\n\nTea in the country with the Who singer\n\nInterview by Tony Norman\n\nWE ARE SITTING in a small pub opposite Wadhurst station. In this quiet corner of East Sussex the watery winter sun filters down through proud trees and touches real green grass. It is the kind of grass we used to have in the cities. It is untouched by smoke, fumes and grime. The freshness stands out; it’s a different colour.\n\nPublicist Keith Altham and myself are creatures of the town. Our first instinct on arriving in this pleasant place was to head for warmth and booze. Outside there is real peace. Outside there is an element of space. Outside there really is unspoilt countryside. But inside there are two people insensitive to it all. One is telling the other wild and wonderful tales of Keith Moon, the well-known eccentric musician.\n\nThe door swings open and in walks Roger Daltrey, his brown boots smeared with mud. His blue jeans are tight and tatty – “uncool” to thousands who dig his music. A huge white sweater keeps out the cold. Not exactly everyone’s picture of a superstar perhaps, but what the hell? Daltrey is on holiday.\n\nWe drive to his house through country lanes at speeds touching 80 m.p.h. Roger is feeling fine driving his new Aston Martin. I am in the front, feeling nervous and exhilarated at the same time. Altham is in the back feeling sick. But we make it and on arrival inspect the 1929 vintage motor in the garage. It’s in fantastic condition, straight out of a Bogart movie. It’s even got white-walled tyres. A magnificent machine.\n\nThis beautiful house is not unlike Toad Hall in “Wind In The Willows”. It was built in 1610 and has that indefinable quality modern homes of concrete and glass lack.\n\nWe talk over a steaming mug of tea, and he tells me: “We decided to take this break while we were on an ‘up’. Around the middle of last year our playing was really going downhill. We had a lot of hassles getting the stage thing together, and that’s what The Who really exists on.\n\n“You see, ‘Tommy’ had to go. We were bored playing it, and we felt it was holding us back in the end. But having made the decision to drop it, we found we had a huge gap to fill. It really seemed impossible. “With ‘Tommy’ we were doing over two hours on stage. When you’re just doing a string of different songs, that seems a mighty long time.\n\nProgress\n\n“We finally sorted it out by pulling in the new songs from ‘Who’s Next’ and still using some of ‘Tommy’ as well as the old singles and things like that. In the end we were going down better than ever.\n\n“I think ‘See Me, Feel Me’ will always be in our act. You know the words are really true. It’s through them (the audience) that we hear the music; through them we progress. But what we really need for the future is another chunk of Who music, rather than a batch of different songs.”\n\nThe Who are keen to get a film together, and they have some ideas floating around.\n\n“It won’t just be about a group on the road,” Roger explains. “We want a film that will reflect what Rock means to The Who, and to the general public. The fact that we all have different views has made it difficult, but we do have one idea in common. But I don’t want to discuss it really. In the past we’ve done too much talking; this time we don’t want to run before we can walk.”\n\nHow about albums? When will the next be released?\n\n“Well, we’ve got some tapes of some shows we did in San Francisco. Glyn Johns says they are better quality than ‘Live At Leeds’. The trouble is, there’s only one song that we haven’t released before.”\n\nAfter “Live At Leeds” and “Mighty, Meaty”, didn’t he think the record-buyers would be tired of getting old songs? When would there be some fresh material on the market?\n\n“We’ll have to have a discussion about the ‘live’ stuff. I wouldn’t like to say whether we will release it. We have some other songs in the can from the ‘Who’s Next’ sessions, but really we want to hang off until we can get the big one (i.e. the film and an album to go with it). That will be the biggest thing we’ve ever done.”\n\nI ask him about his wealth, and the comfort surrounding him, in relation to the Capitalist Society.\n\n“We are living in a Capitalist Society and I’m not prepared to be a total anarchist. Even Communist societies aren’t that different.\n\nIn debt\n\n“So if you live in this sort of society, you’ve got to play the game. I’d like to know what these people would have done if we’d blown it and been in debt for a few thousand pounds.\n\n“Would they have bailed us out? When we say we don’t make money here (Britain), we mean it. We just about cover our living expenses and the cost of putting the show on the road.\n\n“Our last tour pulled in £12,000 and our company was £25,000 in debt.”\n\nI ask him for a breakdown on their expenses. It reads like this: ten roadies at £30-a-week; two top roadies at £70-a-week; three 4-ton-trucks — one rented at £60-a-week and two bought at around £3,000 each; plus things like petrol, hotels, equipment lights and even a portable stage (when required).\n\n“The reason we use so much equipment,” says Roger, “is that we are trying to change the ballrooms into some sort of theatre. Okay, we have made money in the States. But none of us ever try to hide anything. If you like, we’re capitalist bastards. But then, I was when I was working in a factory for £ 7-a-week.”\n\nSo now, he’s made his money. Wouldn’t he be prepared to give it all away?\n\n“No!” replies Daltrey, all neatly in perspective. “Why should I? I just wanted to be in a group, that’s all.\n\n“We always made a living, but we’ve only made real money in the past two years. Look, I’ll tell you the truth. Up to two years ago we were getting £50-a-week plus expenses.\n\n“Three years ago I had to sell my car to get the deposit for a house. So really we’ve only just started getting big money; money that doesn’t have to go straight back into our bellies.”\n\nTrouble\n\nWhen were The Who in the most trouble financially?\n\n“That would be just before we released ‘Can’t Explain’,” he said. “If we’d gone down then, we would have faced a debt of £60,000. We were getting 50 quid a night, and Pete was smashing guitars worth £200 and amps worth twice that, every night!\n\n“None of us had a car, and one of our managers had to get a job in a film to help pay our bills. It took us three years to pay off those debts.\n\n“Mind you, our standard of living went up. At the start we were getting £15-a-week and I was living in the back of the removals van we used for gigs.” He pauses and laughs: “A removals van! Even then we were thinking big!”\n\nDid the big debts worry him at the time?\n\n“No, not really. I always felt we were going to do it. I worry more now when I look back and think what trouble we could have got ourselves into. Still, at the time we were confident.\n\n“It’s funny, with The Who. We’re all so different, but when things start going badly we all pull for one another. It`s like being married to three people.\n\n“Why do we get on together? Well, in our stars we have the four elements, earth, fire, air and water. Maybe that’s got something to do with it.\n\n“We first started to get a really good reaction around the time we got our residency at The Marquee in Wardour Street. It all escalated from there. It happened so fast, it was amazing. You had the feeling anything could happen. We were the kids’ group.\n\n“It was the time of the big Mod cult, and there was nobody to represent it. We saw the opening, and they accepted us. It was a good time. You really felt part of some sort of youth culture. But where has that old sense of urgency gone now? Where’s the excitement?\n\n“When I see what’s in the singles charts, it’s depressing. It should be the place to look for the music the kids are digging today. But those records are bought by the mums and dads.\n\n“At one time the kids told the musicians what they wanted.\n\n“Now they sit back and let the musicians preach to them. Like on gigs they are saying: ‘Come on, show me what you can do. See if you can cheer me up.’\n\nTakeover\n\n“If they want to burst that frustration bubble, they’ve got to show their feelings.\n\n“One day they’re all going to get so bored, they’re gonna go out and smash windows. Then we’ll have a whole new rock’n’roll era. It’ll be starting all over again.\n\n“In many ways, football has taken over from rock. There is more of the urgency/stardom thing there. There is more competition, and the players know how to please their audience. If they don’t play well they get booed. It’s not a complacent job, whereas for the past 18 months, being a rock musician has been. The kids on the terraces really care about their team; they used to feel that way about their favourite group.\n\n“I don’t think television is helping to bring excitement back to rock. What we need is another ‘Ready Steady Go’, a show that really means something to the kids.\n\n“I mean ‘Top of the Pops’ is like an extension of the Engelbert Humperdinck show; a 40-year-old man’s view of a 12-year-old girl’s knickers.”\n\nHe is convinced we have the talent here, and that the sense of urgency he referred to can return, but the mass-media people have got to wake up.\n\n“Whether they want to admit it or not,” concludes Daltrey, “considering the size of our country, we’ve got the best rock musicians in the world.”\n\nUnspoilt\n\nBefore heading back to town he shows me round the grounds. From the back of his house there is a clear view across an unspoilt valley. No ugly electricity pylons, no filthy roads.\n\nWe think of the people who are battling through the rush of the city.\n\n“In a way, it’s their decision,” he says.\n\n“I’d rather be down here earning £ 15-a-week than chasing a big wage in London.”\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nThese interviews conducted in the actual homes of the rock-stars at the time are actually very great. I guess that for the journalist it helps that object of interest is more relaxed when interviewed at home.\n\nRead on!\n\nSlowly, Who go forward step-by-step\n\nRoger Daltrey talks to NME`s Richard Green\n\nIt`s not all that often that a carton of “Big Value Bounce,” a stereoscopic viewer, three dogs and a joke machine that utters maniacal laughs play any sort of part in an interview. On the other hand, it is as infrequently that I visit the country seat of Roger Daltrey who looks like a contestant for the title of Pop Squire Of Hurst.\n\nRoger has been living for getting on for two years in what is described as a cottage but is, in fact, a lot larger, in deepest Buckinghamshire. Jimmy Page doesn’t live all that far away but the locals don’t seem to have been unduly affected.\n\nAs befits his quieter-than-of-late-life, Roger was up a ladder fixing the roof over a rear porch when I arrived on a sunny afternoon. He descended in his wellington boots, old jeans and shirt and suggested an excursion to the Green Man. This turned out to be an ancient local inn where Roger is well-known and very popular.\n\nChuckles\n\nThe landlady showed us a thing called a bag of laughs that costs two quid and emits piercing chuckles and yells. Roger and I decided it was really impersonating Kit Lambert, the Who’s co-manager.\n\nAfter recovering from the shock of the machine, we talked about the new album, “Tommy,” where the Who are at today and what surprises are up their sleeves.\n\n“We could have done a better `live’ album if we’d done it over a number of dates,” Roger admitted. “But `My Generation’ and `Magic Bus,’ are just unbelievable, complete freedom, it just flows.”\n\nPete Townshend had played me some of the album on tape at his home and when I mentioned this, back at Roger’s house, he replied: “It’s best heard on tapes, I’m afraid albums are on the way out. Oh, It’s so untogether today. Let’s talk about Squidgy — Tricky Dicky.\n\n“Do you want me to play the album, I’ve heard it enough. I’d rather play Simon and Garfunkel. Let’s go without sounds.\n\n“Let’s see what drink we’ve got… out come the dregs. What can we offer you? Cup of tea? Right, one cup of Rosey. One thing you could put right, a lot of people have said that the audience must have been dubbed on the album but it’s not been. The only thing that’s been dubbed are a few voices towards the end where they got a bit weak.”\n\nWhile various people tried to control an assortment of dogs who were intent on mischief and Roger went to organise tea, I had a look round the house. It is about four hundred years old and has ridiculously low beams everywhere — it’s rumoured that it was initially designed for Jimmy Clitheroe!\n\nSets of books with titles like “The World Of Children” line the shelves in the lounge and loads of amps and tape equipment litter the floor. An empty carton of “Bounce” dog food was on a chair and the steroscopic viewer — a kind of three-dimensional peep show — on a cupboard.\n\nA lot of the furniture is of the old-fashioned variety which is so much in vogue and as a contrast, Roger has added an extension to the main building to be used for a bedroom and studio.\n\nHe is digging a pond and the well is covered with an old mangle. The olde-worlde appeal of the house if offset by Roger’s shiny American sports car standing in the drive.\n\nThe car has a Woodstock sticker on it and I told Roger that the Who come over very well in the film of the festival. That pleased him, but he wasn’t so enthusiastic about the event itself.\n\n“It was a nightmare,” he groaned. “We got there at six and we didn’t go on ’til six the next morning! It was murder — no food and no water. Oh… “\n\nRoger’s voice on the new album sounds to me a lot stronger than before and of this view, he said “I’ve been singing like this for a long time now, we’ve just not had it on record.\n\n“We’ve been going into the studio and I haven’t known the songs – Pete doesn’t like to do songs on stage before we record them. He’s writing songs that suit my voice better, before I had to fit my voice to the songs.\n\n“Pete’s writing better than ever now, he went through a bad stage after ‘Tommy.’ John’s writing a lot now as well, that’s coming on well. And the recording is so much better, we’re recording at Pete’s and he digs the engineering side so much.”\n\nOur chat was interrupted by the arrival of a pleasant young Irishman called Cecil McCartney, who brought with him his album, “Om.” He sat on the floor and immediately attracted the attention of one dog who discovered a melted bar of chocolate in his back pocket. Cecil’s pocket, not the dog’s.\n\nDefended\n\nRoger was gradually coming to and he sprang right on the defensive when I mentioned Pete smashing his guitar into the stage at Woodstock and then throwing it away.\n\n“He gave it away,” he protested. “He has a game with it but he doesn’t smash it. Pete has no respect for the guitar, he uses it just as an instrument to make what he wants to do.”\n\nRoger is, however, happy with the way things are going for the Who just now and he agrees that within the group all is a lot better. “We just know ourselves a lot better,” is the way he puts it. It’s certainly taken them a long time to find out.\n\nThe Who is a weird group in terms of advancement. Everyone knows how good it is but it takes a couple of hit singles and an album for the Who to be on everyone’s tongues.\n\nYet without this tangible success the Who can still go out for considerable money. There are “Who periods” and Roger knew what I meant when I mentioned them.\n\n“‘Tommy’ was the next stepping stone from `My Generation,'” he conceded. “It took a long while but there it is. One of the basic problems of pop is there are too many analysts. They should either like it or not, if it does something to them or not. They don’t have to go into it. “I can understand people not liking `Tommy’ at all. Why not? That’s a difficult question. Mainly because… well, the actual recording of it at the time was fantastic — for us to get into something like that — but we’re past that now.\n\n“We perform it much better on stage and it’s very hard to like the album after you’ve done it on stage. It was a real turn on before we did it on stage.\n\n“The New York Metropolitan will be the last time we will feature it, though we may play parts of it, perhaps a bit different, other times. It’s becoming a bit of a monkey, like the breaking of the gear, people expected it.”\n\nWhat, then, does Roger see as the next “stepping stone” for the Who?\n\n“I dunno, really,” he replied. “Maybe we’ll do a five album opera on a torso called Deborah! The Who will always be a 3-D group, they always have been. That album — we’d been playing for two hours when most of it had been recorded. It was at its peak to most of the audience. The last four numbers on the album were the last four numbers of the act.\n\n“On `Shakin’ All Over,` `My Generation’ and `Summertime Blues’ the voices can be a lot better, but to the audience it just doesn’t matter because we’re a 3-D group.\n\n“Everytime we say we’re gonna sing `Summertime Blues` a big cheer goes up and it’s great to hear it because the voices aren’t that good by then.”\n\nThe Who are off on another American tour within the next couple of weeks or so and that should keep the Yanks happy for a while. If Pete is writing as well as Roger believes — and a track from the next album that Roger played me leads to believe that he is — then a comment that Pete made to me on the phone after our last chat may make sense after all.\n\nCalling him about a concert, I said it was a shame that `The Seeker` wasn’t going up very fast. “It doesn’t really matter, does it?” he replied quite nonchalantly.\n\nIf you have a large collection of the following magazines, don`t throw them out, but contact me as I would be very interested in these: Creem, Circus, Hit Parader and Metal Edge.\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article. With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nThis is a refreshingly honest interview with the one and only frontman of the Who. This one should be read by all as Mrs. Charone conducted a really good interview here. Nice one, Barbara!\n\nRead on!\n\nRoger rides a rock horse\n\nExclusive Roger Daltrey interview by Barbara Charone\n\nIt was rather bizarre actually. There was this enormous inflatible lady, red satin knickers and racy black lace. But she was headless. And there was this silver space capsule plummeting towards earth. But it wasn`t really moving. And there was a patient Roger Daltrey saying “Lola B flat”. And an even more patient Ken Russell saying “Lola A flat”. It was really rather strange.\n\nThe fantasy and illusions stop for lunch. The inflatible lady stays behind in a dingy studio at Shepperton while the rest of the less plastic crew take time out from the very last day of shooting `Lisztomania` for lunch.\n\nFranz Liszt climbs out of the space capsule and suddenly becomes Roger Daltrey. Roger Daltrey, actor, climbs out of some fancy grey threads into some scruffy denims and becomes Roger Daltrey, rock singer. We are back to square one.\n\nThe atmosphere is decidely more realistic inside the practical but unglamorous canteen. The food is the same standard, barely edible stuff found in any cafeteria but the clientele is more attractive. People from wardrobe and makeup, directors, sultry female extras, all sorts.\n\nROAST CHICKEN\n\nRoger Daltrey looks up from his roast chicken, casting an eager eye over the colourful crowd. He is very tired today, feeling the blunt edge of continuous work for the last 18 months. Not content to stay home and mind the pigs, Roger Daltrey has been busy lately.\n\nWe were talking about this dead end rock has run into. “It`s nothing to do with getting old,” says a member of the world`s only intact and unchanged rock and roll band. “It`s just learning things, growing up and becoming mature. It`s the growing up that`s anti-rock. Rock isn`t refusing to grow up, it`s the people that buy it; it`s what they want to hear. That`s what doesn`t want it to change.\n\n“It`s still only the four people in the band. That`s why we`ve lasted because kids want to see the Who, see those four people. You can`t just turn it off, go somewhere else and expect people to put up with it.\n\n“If the Who went onstage like the Pink Floyd, with an incredible light show, and stood there like four dead people that sounded great, our fans wouldn`t put up with that. Nothing is going to change. So what do you do?” The singer asked passionately. “What do you do?”\n\nIf you are the Who, you do a great number of things. You let the machinery unravel, slowly, allowing individual components to function without group environments, positively hoping that frustrations will disappear and the machinery emerge well oiled and more impressive than before.\n\nWhile not known for their intimate comradeship offstage, the Who have seen even less of each other over the last 18 months with each member pursuing various cinematic and musical projects.\n\nThis Summer the individual components are being fused together again for the recording of the first Who album since `Quadrophenia`. Before examing the machinery in toto, let us briefly turn our attention to one energetic cog in the cycle.\n\n“This album is very positive,” said Roger Daltrey referring to `Ride A Rock Horse`, his second solo album released next week. “The first one was a bit negative. If I`d been too positive then, it would have done the Who a lot of damage. I`m not insecure about doing a solo album now, which I was before. It`s not a matter of proving anything. It`s just that I love singing.\n\n“It`s more the way I sing ya know?” he looked up intently making you understand instantly. “Like when I did my first album everyone said `oh Daltrey`s gone soft`. But that was just a side of me that got overshadowed in the Who. This one`s got more balls to it. It`s not wishy-washy at all. And the strings,” he says becoming excited,” aren`t any of that Mantovani stuff.”\n\nSolo albums are a curious breed of record, alternating between the good and the not so good, sometimes sinking to new depths of tastelessness. There is no Court of King Arthur concept here, simply 10 musical songs. You remember, those catchy refrains that last a couple of minutes and are easily hummed? That`s right, songs.\n\n“What I tried to do is get all my different influences on the album. There are little bits throughout that you can hear. One song, `Near To Surrender`, is me old soul days. It reminds me very much of an Otis Redding song, not the actual sound but the way it feels, “(emphasis on the feel).\n\n“Little touches are thrown in all the songs. Like on `Hearts Right` there`s a solo bit that`s very Beach Boys with a little Stevie Wonder thrown in.” The singer laughs. “And `Milktrain,`” he says of a song vocally reminiscent of the Who`s `Dogs`, “reminds me of Syd Barrett, it sums up 1967, that whole flower power period.\n\n“And `Ocean`s Away` has that water bit which is `Quadrophenia`. Of Course,” – he flashes a very large grin, eliciting looks of approval from nearby tables filled with the sultry female extras – “the Who stinks all the way through it. The Who are all over the record.”\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nBut only in spirit and inspiration. Like his last solo album, which exposed someone named Leo Sayer to the world, Daltrey has chosen to record songs by less familiar names. This wise move achieves two purposes, simultaneously showing off Daltrey`s voice and new songwriters. Who wants yet another version of the same old songs?\n\n“As usual I didn`t write any of the songs. But if I can`t write, at least I can expose other people because there`s so many artists that can`t get heard. I`d love the album to be a success because the people I`m trying to expose are worthy of getting a bit of success at last. Russ Ballard (who produced the album) has been around for years. He`s Mr Underated.\n\n“I could have produced the album myself but it wouldn`t have been as good as what Russ did. Producing yourself on record is like trying to direct yourself in a film. What`s good to you isn`t necessarily the best you can do. You`ve got to get that something else.”\n\nOn the album songwriters like Paul Korda, Bugatti and Musker, Philip Goodhand-Tait, and Ballard, are exposed to an even wider public than before. As if this isn`t enough, Daltrey plans on allowing undiscovered talent to grow and mature on this record label, Goldhawke, of which his album is the first release.\n\n“I feel very good about the record company. The Who should have been doing that a long time ago. When Track was set up those were the original intentions but it backfired.\n\n“In the early days Track was really good. There was Hendrix and Arthur Brown. Then nothing. They lost interest in their own company which is sad. I hope that never happens to me.”\n\nPaul Korda, who wrote three very good songs on `Ride A Rock Horse` is presently in Memphis recording an album for Goldhawke, singing like a `male Nina Simone`. And there are more extraordinary plans.\n\n“We`ve got a group of young girls,” pause for decadent giggles, “who can really sing. And we`ve got this 16-year-old girl we found doing `Lisztomania`. We were doing a scene for a live concert. All the audience were young girls, the blue knicker brigade” – pause for more decadent giggles.\n\n“At dinner they used to get up and entertain each other. And this one girl got up without a microphone and sang `River Deep Mountain High` and I couldn`t believe it! It was incredible. So we signed her up.”\n\nAnd there`s the story about the guy who works in a `bloody tailor shop` and wrote a song for Roger. In a business continually low on enthusiasm, Roger Daltrey is an enigma, constantly full of enough energy and excitement to infuse any project despite the necessary voltage. Reacquainting themselves with each other again, the Who need an electrical shock.\n\n“The Who need to get all that energy back together as a unit. At the moment we`re having problems finding that sorta energy. I`d like to see the Who back as a good rock and roll band,” Roger says with the vengeance of a real fan. “We are having a lot of problems. I won`t try and hide the fact that we are.”\n\nI wondered if the problems merely revolved around not working together for a long time.\n\n“It`s that and – well the group vehicle seems to have found it`s limitations on the surface. I think once we get down to it and really do it, we`ll find new boundaries. But at the moment, it all feels a bit cramped.”\n\nWith all the recent ballyhoo about the overwhelming `Tommy` film, one could easily attribute the band`s queasy feelings about communal confinement to the film. But the problems are deeper than just a fixation with that deaf, dumb, and blind boy.\n\nFRUSTRATION\n\n“No, the film hasn`t affected us,” Roger says somberly. “The problems started before the film. It`s us taking ourselves too seriously. That`s the main problem. You`ve got to draw the line somewhere.\n\n“It definitely got to the point where it wasn`t fun anymore,” he says echoing similar statements made in the Press by Pete Townshend. “And if it ain`t fun why bother?\n\n“It doesn`t all have to be fun but I`ve always enjoyed it. But it`s really a group thing. Pete`s having terrible problems with wanting to play again, play in the situation we were playing in. To me, it`s all down to us. You`ve got to go onstage and try to get better and better. Some nights you don`t succeed but after a length of time you do get better.\n\n“Pete seems to want to be able to get better immediately when nothing has changed. I understand his frustration `cause he doesn`t want to jump, when they say jump. But then again, it`s also entertainment.”\n\nFor a long time now, critics have suggested that while elevating them to new heights of commercial and artistic acceptance, the `Tommy` album has done nothing but hold the band back. Daltrey disagrees.\n\n“It`s not `Tommy` that held us back. Nobody wanted to listen to what we were doing. `Who`s Next` holds up much better than `Tommy` but nobody wanted to take it seriously. Nobody wanted to give it the amount of thought they gave `Tommy`, just because it was 10 songs and no great, big, bloody thing about a spastic. It was just a bunch of songs rescued from another concept (Lifehouse).\n\n“The whole head of the group was good at that time. We`d had the huge thing of `Tommy`. We were out there playing because we really wanted to play. No big heavy numbers. It was great,” Roger sighs in fond memory. “That was the most enjoyable period of my time with the group.\n\n“The only thing I was down about then was a fear that the Who were getting overshadowed by the synthesiser. It didn`t happen because we took the songs onstage and did without it.\n\n“In `Quadrophenia` we got drowned in it,” he laughs, “and funny enough `Drowned` was the only song that pulled us out. That was my main argument, you`ll never get the Who to play like machines. We`re not robots.”\n\nSure enough the inevitable happened. Taking `Quadrophenia` on the road without using additional musicians and destroying what made the Who great, meant using complicated tapes of backing tracks. Being a band that thrived more on emotion than mechanics, the Who would often start before the tapes and the tapes would sometimes start before the Who. On a good night they started together.\n\n“What happened with rock and roll music is that it got caught up in technology. Even though it takes leaps and bounds when new sounds come out, nothing really changes. There`s a parallel everywhere. Only technology changes. Rock took on an enormous race between 1964 and 1974 and that`s slowing down. Suddenly it`s got nowhere to go.\n\n“Rock isn`t going to change,” Daltrey says, old passions returning. “All you can do is keep writing the same kind of songs. You can`t let it die. So much has been done but I can`t see something new coming along. That`s why being flexible is so important.\n\n“And, at the moment, the Who isn`t very flexible,” – he says the word like it`s made out of plastic. “That`s where we`re finding the crunch at the moment.”\n\nThis being 1975, several founding rock bands seem to be feeling that same crunch. Traffic have broken up. Punters put bets on this being the Stones` last American tour. Time off the road becomes longer than time touring. The Who are the last salvation of a dying era. Do they feel that pressure to stay together?\n\n“I don`t give a shit about that. I don`t care whether they expect us together or not. As long as the next thing we do is 1 per cent better than `Quadrophenia` then I`ll be well satisfied. The album will be a straight album, no concepts and it will get done this Summer. We`ve attempted to start it already,” he says delicately of the fragile situation called making records.\n\nSeveral weeks ago there was a lovely Saturday afternoon when the sun shone all day and temperatures were pleasantly warm. A perfect day for a rock and roll concert but the schizoid bill at the Crystal Palace Garden Party hardly excited any followers.\n\nInstead it was a very long day of pretty much unexceptional music and so it was with much pleasure that I watched the Who that same night, on a `Second House` re-run, going through their paces at last year`s Charlton concert.\n\n“That`s the Who,” Roger says of the days the band played live. “Either we own up and say that`s what we do or we pack up. I just don`t know.”\n\nWe sat in silence for a few minutes, cups and saucers clanging away in the background. Movie people getting ready to go back to a world of illusions. Finally I asked the dreaded question. Is no more Who a reality now?\n\n“Yeah”, he says hesitantly, “very much more. I can accept it now. I couldn`t two years ago. And the reason I think I can accept it now is because maybe we have done as much as we can do. It`s nothing to do with existing outside the Who. I could have done that years ago; we all could have, no doubt about that.\n\n“It`s just you get to a point where maybe,” optimistic emphasis on the maybe, “maybe you`ve just done as much as you`re ever gonna do within that framework. That`s being really honest.”\n\nBut certainly you don`t want to believe that? “I keep telling myself it isn`t true,” Roger laughs returning to his more boisterous self, shedding the serious overtones. I`ll be in there fighting till the last bloody second but like I said, I could accept it now.”\n\nThose are harsh words coming from, perhaps, the Who`s most dedicated fan, who through the years has continually spoken of the Who as some magical society, capable of possessing extraordinary powers. All of which is very true.\n\nSeveral devout Who admirers expressed surprise over the band`s recent appearance at star-studded, Hollywood-type premieres held round the world to signal the opening of the film event of the year. Some disillusioned followers didn`t understand what Ann Margret, champagne and caviar had to do with rock.\n\n“You`ve got to go in and say this is a film, it`s just bloody show biz. You`ve got to get into that head. It`s just a laugh, nothing more serious than that.\n\n“Those premieres did Pete a lot of harm. He got all these paranoias about who the hell is going to like the Who now. I mean our fans still like us,” Roger says sincerely, almost trying to convince Townshend even though he`s not here. “The film ain`t important at all. It`s the Who that`s important.”\n\nIt is 1975 now and the Who have grown up. But so have the audience. `Quadrophenia` completed the circle. The Who must begin another circle or abandon the vehicle.\n\nLunchtime was over now. Roger Daltrey had to stop being a rock singer and become an actor again. The inflatable lady still wore red satin knickers and racy black lace. The space capsule was still plummeting towards earth. I thought about the Who survival. “Lola B flat” barked Ken Russell. It was really rather strange.\n\nI have personally transcribed this from the original paper. Any errors in the text from the original magazine may not have been corrected for the sake of accuracy.
