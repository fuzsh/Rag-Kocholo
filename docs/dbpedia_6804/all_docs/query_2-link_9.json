        "text": "The Who may officially be over if recent remarks from Roger Daltrey are to be taken seriously.\n\nDaltrey recently gave an interview to The Times. In the interview, the legendary singer was asked about the future of The Who. He said he couldn’t give a definitive answer because he’s not the one who writes the songs. (As we all know, Pete Townshend does that.) However, he did say, “[Pete and I] need to sit down and have a meeting, but at the moment, I’m happy saying that part of my life is over.”\n\nIn December 2023, Townshend made similar remarks to Record Collector. He said, “I think it’s time for Roger and I to go to lunch and have a chat about what happens next.”\n\nTownshend then added, “Because [the final summer tour stop] shouldn’t feel like the end of anything, but it feels like the end of an era.”\n\nAs far as performing and touring goes, Townshend stressed that it all depends on a few factors. Among them is whether an idea would be doable and profitable. Perhaps the most important factor is whether an idea would even be fun to do. Believe it or not, Townshend said he’s had a lot of fun on the road lately, even though he’s said in the past he’s not super fond of touring.\n\nThe Who’s Tommy Coming Back to Broadway\n\nThe future of The Who is uncertain, but there’s one thing fans can look forward to and that the return of The Who’s Tommy on Broadway.\n\nBack in October 2023, Playbill reported the revival of The Who’s Tommy is slated to open on March 28, 2024 at the Nederlander Theatre. The show had a sold-out run in Chicago this past summer at the Goodman Theatre. Additionally, it’s also being dubbed as a “newly reimagined production.” The original run of The Who’s Tommy opened on Broadway in 1993 and went on to win five Tony Awards.\n\nTownshend is attached to the revival. He said in a statement, “I can’t wait to see how this newly empowered show connects with younger Broadway audiences today.\n\nHe added, “I hope the younger ones come, for they will identify in an entirely new and important way with Tommy’s tumultuous life.”\n\nThe Who: Their 10 Most Iconic Lyrics\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
