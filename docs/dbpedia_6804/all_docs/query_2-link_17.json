        "text": "Pete Townshend, co-founder, guitarist and principal songwriter of The Who, says he’s feeling like less of a main band member and more of a substitute musician most days.\n\nTownshend, 78, expressed his feelings in a recent interview with Mojo, sharing that bandmate Roger Daltrey is the one who typically chooses the musicians that go on tour with them.\n\n“I have not chosen any of the musicians I tour with — not even (drummer) Zak (Starkey),” Townshend told the music magazine. “When Roger brings me onstage I am filling the shoes of a guy called Frank Simes, who Roger tours with solo, and who is a guitar player and musical director.”\n\n“I am happy to do it,” Townshend added. “Someone reading this will say, ‘Stop f------ complaining, Townshend, and put a band together of people you do want to use.’ But that scares the shit out of me.”\n\nREAD MORE: Legendary classic rock star hints at farewell tour before ‘crawling off to die’\n\nEarlier this year while promoting his rock opera “Tommy,” Townshend admitted during a New York Times interview that a final tour would would be more about finances rather than the love of performing.\n\n“I don’t get much of a buzz from performing with the Who,” Townshend told the publication at the time. “If I’m really honest, I’ve been touring for the money. My idea of an ordinary lifestyle is pretty elevated.”\n\nTownshend is set to release a 14-disc set titled “Live in Concert 1985-2001,” which features nine of his rare solo concerts, on July 26. Meanwhile, “Tommy” is currently on Broadway at New York’s Nederlander Theatre.\n\nMore music coverage\n\nLegendary classic rock star is ‘f------ sick’ of the internet. ‘It’s ruined live shows for me.’\n\nLegendary rock star calls former band ‘f------ a--holes’ at solo show\n\nCelebrated rock drummer returns to cult favorite band after 13 years\n\n80s music legend hated the movie based off her biggest hit. ‘It sucked.’\n\nBruce Springsteen thanks fans in Europe after postponing shows to recover from ‘vocal bug’"
