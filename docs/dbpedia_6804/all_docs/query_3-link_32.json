        "text": "In the annals of rock history, few bands have made as indelible a mark as The Who. The band's journey began in 1961 when Roger Daltrey, the charismatic frontman, brought Pete Townshend into the fold. This pivotal moment shaped the band's future and the rock music landscape. Over the years, The Who has become synonymous with Daltrey's vision, a testament to his leadership and artistic direction. Despite the changing times and lineup, it remains, at its core, \"Roger's band,\" as Townshend himself acknowledges.\n\nThe current iteration of The Who is a collective of musicians handpicked by Daltrey. This includes the likes of drummer Zak Starkey and guitarist and musical director Frank Simes, who tours with Daltrey during his solo ventures. Townshend, despite his legendary status, views his role as stepping into the shoes of Simes when performing with The Who. It's a dynamic that speaks volumes about the collaborative spirit of the band, where personal choices take a backseat to the collective sound that defines their iconic status. Townshend, for his part, expresses contentment in this arrangement, albeit with a hint of trepidation at the thought of assembling his own ensemble.\n\nAs The Who continues to evolve, so does Roger Daltrey's musical journey. His solo band, which includes Simon Townshend, Pete's brother, offers him a different kind of creative satisfaction. In a conversation back in 2020, Daltrey revealed a sense of relaxation and freedom on stage with his band, a stark contrast to the \"different animal\" that is The Who.\n\n[Source: Classic Hits Today]"
