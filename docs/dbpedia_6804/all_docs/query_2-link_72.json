        "text": "Here`s a great one done by Tony Stewart with Mr. Daltrey, being almost as outspoken as ever. But only just.\n\nRead on to find out more!\n\nThe Who: triumph and a threat\n\nIt happened to The Beatles, but it won`t affect The Who. And Roger Daltrey now prepares to do three years hard labour.\n\nReport: Tony Stewart\n\nROGER DALTREY lives in Sussex, away from it all in a house you could lose an elephant in. The grounds are so vast that he can point into the horizon — and you’re still not sure whether his land goes further than the natural boundary you can see. You get there by train, arriving at a tranquil country station, and then riding along narrow high-hedged lanes in a Range Rover.\n\nOn our particular visit it was hot. So hot that Daltrey wore only a brief pair of white jeans cut at the knees, displaying a fine, bronze physique, as we wandered around the gardens of his estate.\n\nIt is the country, and a most convivial place to rap. To do so we sat on the lawn, which is decorated with a miniature tinkers caravan. However, amid this idyllic setting, there is a note of realism. Daltrey has been mixing concrete, and that means preparing for the rigours of the road. It helps him get fit, he says.\n\nOur conversation developed naturally through the subjects of his own solo work, the new Who concept album, Ken Russell’s film version of “Tommy”, and three years hard labour for the band, and Daltrey displayed all the enthusiasm of a man going back to the work he loves — performing.\n\nHe’d also displayed some misgivings about the Who’s business affairs.\n\n“I’m giving you a scoop here,” he said, “but I’ve got to speak out for once.”\n\nHowever, after the interview he decided he didn’t want to wash all the dirty linen on a public washing line.\n\nWhat he did say was: “The Who’s suffered, and we’re starting to suffer internally, which really is bad”. And that’s enough to indicate all is not well.\n\n“This is what worries me,” he continued. “It’s happened to the Stones and the Beatles, and it’s the same bloody problem”.\n\nBut to clarify his point, he added: “Oh, I’m not worried about the music. It hasn’t altered anything within the group as far as I feel towards playing is concerned. That’s one good thing about the Who, whereas it wasn’t with the Beatles. There’s no chance of anything changing there at all,” he emphasised, “we’re completely solid on that.”\n\nIt’s best to leave it at that, so concentrating on Daltrey, the Who and their music. On a happier note, this piece could quite easily be subtitled what the Who did on their holidays.\n\nThe word holiday is used quite loosely, even though Daltrey — as he sits chewing grass — displays a nifty shade of brown on his torso. Right enough, they’ve relaxed, but the band have not been totally idle these past two years.\n\n“It’s not really been inactivity y’know, there’s been a lot going on,” he explains. “We just felt we had to have that time off to re-think. I think it’s paid off with the new music we’ve done. It definitely has come together as being new.\n\n“Hopefully, once we get the new stuff on stage we’ll be able to forget what we used to do, or at least a lot of what we used to do, we’ll just keep the good bits and get rid of all the rubbish.\n\n“You can only do this type of thing after having a couple of years off away from what you’re doing,” he explains. “By working every night we just kept our old bad habits.\n\n“So we’ll wait and see. But I’m very optimistic and really pleased. Musically we’re stronger now than we’ve ever been. And as far as getting back on the road is concerned, we’ve never been more definite about anything.\n\n“Like I say,” and a mischievous grin creases his face, “we’ve had a lot of other problems.” He allows himself a knowing chortle.\n\nDaltrey went on to emphasise that the Who’s volume of productivity doesn’t match their volume of sound. And he feels their critical discrimination is quite strict.\n\n“The Who don’t just go in and record ten songs for an album ’cause we need an album.\n\n“Every album has been far more than that. And that’s why we’ve been waiting for the time when we would release something really worth releasing. It’s here now, and by Christ it’s worth releasing.\n\n“We’re not like Slade, or even the Stones come to that, who can just go in and make a whole load of songs and release them. We don’t thrive on that sort of scene. That’s why we do find it difficult these days to get singles.\n\n“We,” he continues, “work hard to make records and make them into more than just a piece of plastic and songs.”\n\nThe Who’s new single, “5.15” is released this week and shortly there’s the double album “Quadrophrenia”.\n\nDALTREY’S personal success recently has been his solo album, the single from it — “Giving It All Away” — and then “I’m Free” from Reizner’s production of “Tommy”.\n\nBut Daltrey, who still possesses his harsh London accent and amiable working-class characteristics, still underrates his own ability — and this seems due to lack of self-confidence rather than feigned modesty.\n\nSpeaking of “I’m Free” he says: “I don’t think it’s the people who are acquainted with ‘Tommy’ who have bought the single. I get the feeling that it’s a lot of old ladies — who like it because it sounds like ‘Big Country’ in the middle. And that terrifies me.\n\n“But if anything, its a success because of the lack of Who material.”\n\nThat logic, however, doesn’t tie in with the fact that bassman John Entwistle’s solo endeavours weren’t so well accepted.\n\nDaltrey disagrees. “John made the mistake of having faith enough to dish up his album and say ‘there it is, release it’, which is what I wasn’t prepared to do. Instead of John’s album being properly launched like ours, it fell out the door.”\n\nGoing back to his own success, he continues: “It had to be big,” he stresses, reasoning: “There I was, the singer with the Who. I could have kept cosily within the four members and had a cosy little ride all the way along, but I was putting my balls on the line — so I wanted it to sell, mate. There would’ve been no point having it come out, and do as John’s things do, just sit there. Not that that’s any fault of his.\n\nNOW DALTREY intends to record a follow-up set when he has the time.\n\nHe says: “I’ve written one song of my own and it’s given me a lot of confidence. I hope to find more of a direction on the next one.\n\n“I’ll make it between the Who tours and the “Tommy’ film and everything else — because the Who are going to be working a helluva lot in the next 18 months.\n\n“See, it’s difficult. I think it’d be a mistake to become too — err, what’s the word? — too ambitious at the moment. Because that would start to distrupt the Who.\n\n“I’d hate to get into the situation Rod Stewart had with the Faces. It’s a bloody shame really.\n\n“If the Who are working every day for the next three years, there won’t by any Daltrey albums – don’t worry about that. And that suits me fine. I don’t want to get too ambitious about it.”\n\nNOW, WHAT about the Who’s “Quadrophrenia” album. What is it like musically, I inquire?\n\n“Phenomenal. It really is. I mean Pete’s writing is,” he’s at a loss for superlatives.\n\n“There’s no doubt who is the best rock ‘n’ roll writer after listening to this one. It really is amazing.\n\n“If you want to know the real simple story,” he eventually says of Townshend’s concept, “he goes to the seaside and comes back again.”\n\nDaltrey laughs and buries his nose in a mug of tea.\n\n“Maybe that’s completely wrong, because I haven’t heard it put together. But it’s like `Tommy’, in that I didn’t know what that was about until it had been out about three months.” Chris Stainton played on the sessions, but otherwise it’s basically a group album. Then there’s the “5.15” single. “It’s one of the best Who singles since ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’. And it’s probably the most commercial since ‘Pinball Wizard’ — a really tough rocker, with a lot of the old Who in it. It’s the same with the album, he says. “Who’s Next” got a bit flat and became linear. Although it’s got a helluva lot more on top of it than `Who’s Next’ — in the form of synthesisers and brass and that this new one is stronger than ever.\n\n“But this one’s really got the old Who back. It’s got the clarity and good recording of `Who’s Next’… but it’s got the old `My Generation’ Who there.\n\n“I’ll play you a bit later,” he said, confidentially, “I’ll give you a little preview.\n\n“I can’t explain it… Pete’s writing has gone a whole way past lyrics, and is improving in arrangement.\n\n“A lot of the things that went on in the past — like ‘Tommy’ and that — were cut as rough songs and arranged in the studio by the group, with ideas from the group.\n\n“But now the songs have arrangements around them, and we couldn’t make them better. It’s a whole different way of working. When you hear it you’ll know what I mean.’\n\nI heard two impressive tracks in Daltrey’s barn-studio, and I agree. As well as returning to the old rock ‘n’ roll underlay, the arrangements still hum of grandeur, not unsimilar to “Tommy”.\n\nRather conveniently, this brings us to the film of the rock-opera, which will be directed by Ken Russell. In January the band, with Daltrey, as a 16-year-old Tommy, start the soundtrack, and in April shooting begins.\n\n“I think Ken Russell can make ‘Tommy’ bigger than it’s ever been,” Daltrey states dogmatically. “It means a lot to a lot of people, but it didn’t sell that many records, especially in Britain.\n\n“If Russell can get it over to a lot more people, good luck to him, because I think it says a helluva lot more than ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’. Making a film makes ‘Tommy’ immortal, and that’s as far as I ever want to go. At least it’ll be finished then.”\n\nAs a final question, I couldn’t resist asking Daltrey if he fancied being a film star?\n\nHe laughed.” I’ll be in a film, and hopefully a successful film, but it doesn’t make you a film star.”\n\nNo, but it makes you a hard grafter.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nMr. Entwistle was invited to speak about his solo album “Rigor Mortis Sets In” and as the story goes; The album was completed in less than three weeks, ultimately costing $10,000 in studio time and $4,000 in liquor bills.\n\nIt wasn`t a big success sales-wise, but as long as you have fun making it…\n\nRead on!\n\nRigor Mortis and the happy funeral\n\nJohn Entwistle talks to Tony Stewart\n\nTHE ROOM is deathly silent, apart from the occasional rumble of a stomach going by. We are gathered together on this day for a belated funeral service. Yet instead of a foreboding, gloomy atmosphere prevailing, we’re smiling and swallowing lager.\n\nBut the Man, who oft dresses in black, is serious enough. His hands are placed firmly on the bar top, which acts admirably as a pulpit, and he speaks sincerely, almost mournfully.\n\n“Rock n roll is still dead,” he proclaims morosely to the congregation. “Rigor Mortis has set into rock ‘n’ roll, and a lot of the music that has evolved from it is unrecognisable”. Yes, I’d heard of bastard music.\n\nA grin cracked open my face as John Entwistle elucidates on the name of his band, Rigor Mortis. He didn’t chose that name idly, as you’ll now realise.\n\nBut he admits: “I very much doubt whether anyone, other than me, has realised what the title’s all about.”\n\nSo I smile sacrilegious and glance at the coffin decorating their “Sets In” album sleeve. Neat carpentry, think I, as John continues to talk of his death, and the resurrection for which he’s responsible.\n\n“So I thought” – he elaborates on his former point – “I should try to go back to the roots and reconstruct it. Y’know, try and write new stuff.”\n\nIt came to pass he did. Gawd, he really did. And with a headstone brandished across the inner sleeve, the first real rock ‘n’ roll album of the `70s appeared. You see, Entwistle insists that the good music just ran out of time, and while he had some to spare he looked at what went down and perpetuated its essence. “On ‘Rigor Mortis Sets In’,” he explains, “I tried to chop bits out of other people’s heads. Like, chop bits out of what’s been going on for the past twelve years and transform it. “On my solo albums the chord sequences used to drive me nuts, because they weren’t like anything I’d heard before. And I made sure they weren’t – and so it took me a lot longer to get the thing together. “But with Rigor Mortis it’s simpler, because you can’t write rock ‘n roll without using rock`n`roll riffs.” Entwistle does owe a lot to real rock`n’ roll; songs like “Donna” and all the dance-craze items.\n\nTake his composition “The Dangle”, for instance. “The actual song,” says John “is imitating ‘Land Of A 1000 Dances’, and ‘Do The Jerk’. When I thought of writing a rock n roll thing, I thought I’d got to do a mickey take of the best songs… and those dance songs – y`know twisting and all that business.\n\n“But when I started I thought of about seven dances. One was called ‘The Boxer’, where you punch the person next to you on the nose. And I had to whittle them down to the arrangement.”\n\nThere’s a similar type of influence on two other tracks on the album. The first is “Peg Leg Peggy”, which has some absolute monsters of characters such as “big-mouth Winny” and “four-eyed Fanny”.\n\nEntwistle explains: “All I tried to do was take ‘Short Fat Fanny’ and ‘Boney Maroney’ a bit further and create some real freaks.”\n\n`Roller Skate Kate’ — the story of a young thing who meets a gruesome end while skating down the fast-lane of the motorway, silly bitch — is the supreme sad sob story. So more than a little of the music and theme is borrowed from Ricky Valens’s “Donna”. Entwistle comments: “It takes that song to the absurd, and has an unbelievable death happening.” By George, now you understand the purpose of the good gent’s Rigor Mortis, and hopefully will see the connection between death and life. Likewise you’ll appreciate the view that past insipid reincarnations of this sacred music haven’t been rock ‘n’ roll at all. They were a con. Of course, besides his Rigor Mortis involvement, Entwistle still plays bass with the Who (even now Battersea residents are boarding up their windows as the band go into the studio), and he also has his solo ventures to consider — and there again it’s his humour that carries the Lyrics. His wit will split your knickers — honest, you’ll laugh that much. Remember “Whistle Rymes”? “My first solo album,” he says, “was a conglomoration of all the Who’s stuff that was written by me — and it was described by the person who strung the tape together as something that made him want to jump out of the window. It screwed him up mentally. “I mean, there was ‘Boris The Spider’, ‘Cousin Kevin’, `Fiddle About’ — y’know it was so totally black.\n\n“‘Smash Your Head Against The Wall’ dealt with the devil and heaven and hell and reincarnation. Then ‘Whistle Rymes’ dealt with a lot of disillusionment. I wrote it on piano and I was in a very minor mood at the time.\n\n“So I just wanted to get out of that bag, and get into something up-tempo that you could dance about to.\n\n“The Rigor Mortis album is still black humour, but funnier on the surface than the other albums were.”\n\nBesides the artistic comparisons (and the aim of bringing back rock ‘n’ roll), Rigor Mortis could arguably be described as a shrewd gimmick to bring Entwistle into the public eye, thus persuading people to look back over his solo work.\n\nEntwistle agrees on this point, but says it was not the fundamental intention.\n\n“It might happen that way, but it wasn’t meant to,” he explains. “I really just wanted a band to play my stuff on stage — so that I could do gigs and do television shows.\n\n“I wanted to protect myself, but I also wanted to project the new style. I was hoping it’d be more commercial, and that people would realise that this was nice to listen to — and would then trace the steps back.\n\n“That’s what I did with Neil Young. I bought his latest album, and then bought the earlier ones.\n\n“That was what happened to the Who in the states when `Tommy’ was a hit. A lot of people started buying ‘The Who Sell Out’ and ‘My Generations’ albums.\n\n“Also, Rigor Mortis was the most obvious way to project my new material.”\n\nSadly, as Entwistle puts more and more time into Rigor Mortis, the characters in Entwistle’s solo project go into suspended animation.\n\nHence mourners present were: Boris The Spider, Uncle Ernie, Cousin Kevin, Whiskey Man and Ten Little Friends.\n\n“There won’t be another solo album until next year now,” he says. “I want to keep on with Rigor Mortis. I want to get a second album out.”\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nWould Mr. Daltrey really go back to the Who if his solo album was a smash-hit? He seems sure of it in this article, but is there some indication to the contrary in what he says between the lines? I`m not sure.\n\nRead on and do your own evaluation of this.\n\nWho does what in the Who?\n\nSolo Daltrey talks to Tony Stewart\n\nWHAT’S HAPPENED to the Who? Pete SHOULD be writing and recording for the Who. John Entwistle SHOULD be concentrating on the Who’s future, but he’s too busy with Rigor Mortis and solo albums. Now I hear Roger Daltrey’s working on a solo album. So come on lads, get together and let’s have a new album and a tour.\n\nThat’s an extract from a reader’s letter.\n\nBut Roger Daltrey is quite resolute. “Christ,” he spits, “I’m all for the Who, crikey. First I thought about any problems a solo set might involve if it was successful, but I can’t see it creating any. I wouldn’t have done it if I thought there were.”\n\nRock’s stage matador pauses, and as he contemplates his next statement he glances over the grounds of his Sussex house. “John’s done solo albums,” he continues, “and it hasn’t made any difference. The Who have never had a front man or anything — we’re all just individuals anyway. I don’t think it can really make any difference at all.”\n\nInvariably the petty bitching begins when an established band member decides to make his own album. But in the case of the Who, a good few people will claim that the solo activities are just a consequence of the band taking a long lay-off – which doesn’t really answer anything.\n\nThe question should be: How will all this benefit the band? Rather than: Isn’t it going to detract? Because it isn’t too presumptious to claim that neither Daltrey nor Entwistle are the creative core of the Who, but Townsend is.\n\nRoger considers their extended holiday as a time to relax and find new interests.\n\n“I’ve been doing so much, little things,” he says: “And it’s so nice to do them. To have a year off is a great thing.” He recalls: “When I worked in a factory I used to say, ‘If I can make it and have a year off I’m going to bloody enjoy myself — and I have.”\n\nPart of that enjoyment has been his album, which came together over five weeks during January and February.\n\nDaltrey says: “It just came out of the ‘Tommy’ thing with Lou Reizner, and it was good to learn something about singing outside the group. That’s the only reason, and it’s as simple as that.\n\n“I’d like it to be a successful album, but that still wouldn’t make me a solo artist. I’d still be coming from within the Who.\n\n“If anything, it’s going to help the Who — that’s how I see it. Because I’ve learned a lot about singing that I would never have learned with the Who.\n\n“But,” and he smiles, “I think Pete’d only be too pleased if the album wasn’t successful.”\n\nHe is apparently aware of the risk of a Rod-and-the-Faces situation arising, however improbable it is.\n\n“I don’t think it could happen,” he decides. “Like I say it happens to them because on his albums he plays the same music that the Faces play. I don’t know why they bother to make records really. Theirs sound exactly the same as his.\n\n“Also there’s the fact that Rod made it before the Faces, which was a very awkward position — the Faces come from around Rod Stewart, rather than Stewart coming from within the Faces. I don’t think I could stand that situation, I’d ‘ate to have that.\n\n“I only did it when the Who weren’t working anyway. Now we’ve just been getting ready to start our new album… and hopefully that’ll put me back into the Who — and I’ll know more about me and about different ways of singing. It can only help.”\n\nBut why is it that our vocalist has decided after nearly a decade within the Who to step out and show himself at this stage.\n\nQuite simply, he replies: “I don’t think I’ve been a good enough singer up until recently. In ‘Tommy’ I sang something that really meant something for the first time.\n\n“Now I have a completely different outlook to singing. Before I was just a mad rocker. I still am at heart, but that’s the Who part.\n\n“That was another big problem with the album. I mean, rock ‘n’ roll is a huge part of my main love in music, and I can’t do it on my own. If I did a rock ‘n’ roll album it’d be like the Who. So that was part of the difficulty.\n\n“That’s why I used orchestrations. And I love orchestras. I really do. Plus the fact” — and he snorts a laugh —”there’s not much else you can use.\n\nDURING THE PAST few years Daltrey has been considered one of rock’s finest singers. So he must be sensitive to the critical response to “Daltrey” when it’s released in mid-April.\n\nWell, I’ve heard Daltrey’s album and its easily one of the finest this year. With songs by Leo Sayer and Dave Courtney, and the production of Adam Faith, there is now a document of Daltrey’s character – something unusual, considering he doesn’t write himself. But several of the cuts can be seen as biographical. Especially the opener, which presents him as a busker — or according to the title, “One Man Band”.\n\n“I think all musicians are sort of one-man bands,” he explains, “with all their frustrations, and what they want to do. That’s basically the theme of it — and that’s how the writers saw me.\n\n“They wrote it for me, they really did. We talked for months. I had really long discussions with Terry (Faith) and Dave about all the problems involved.\n\n“Jokingly I said to Dave: `Why don’t you write me a bleeding album?’ A week later he knocked on the door with all the demos. He literally went home and wrote it in a week. Five weeks later we finished the album. That’s how quick it was.” Already a few eyebrows will be raised querying the talents of Faith as a producer. But dear Budgie accomplishes anything he sets his mind to — and this is no exception. However. Roger has been producing Ellis, so why, why didn’t he produce himself? The reason, he says is that he needs directing by somebody not inextricably involved in the singing. And he believes the Who also need a producer for the same reason. “Not for sound quality,” he points out concerning the Who’s case.” That became incredible. But just little things we’d overlooked. Some of the new stuff we’ve done — and this is why we’re getting a producer back in — sounds great, but when you listen to it, is it really the Who? “There’s no mad Moon drumming, it’s all a bit too clean. That’s why you need a producer, because we’ll be involved with it concerning the total sound, but you need somebody else there who’ll say: `Where’s Moon’s crazy drumming?’\n\nSo you lose part of the band’s character.\n\n“You tend to, yes. Another thing,” he elaborates. “We need a producer because we waste such a lot of time in the studios.\n\n“If you learn a song the first take is usually the best one. You go on routining and routining, and sure it gets musically a bit better, and it gets tighter, but it loses something else.\n\n“It doesn’t need to be that tight. It needs to be as tight as we are, but we’re pretty tight even when we’re loose. But if you get it overtight and overclean it stops being the Who.”\n\nHowever we return to our original theme of this album not detracting from the Who. He says that only if the Who quit road-work will he form a band — “but we ain’t going to,”he states irrevocably.\n\n“Because I really want to get the Who back on the road. I love working with the Who. If I can just make two albums like this a year, and they do reasonably well, I’ll be ‘appy.\n\n“Maybe if the Who come off the road again, like they have done for the last year, then I might go on the road with a band. But just as long as the Who don’t suffer.\n\nAs the Who near completion of their Battersea, London, studios – “we’ve got a lead coming out of the back of the Battersea Power Station,” Daltrey jokes — with Townshend mid-way through writing the next album, which they insist will be a concept album to equal the standard of “Tommy”, the band have tour plans for late this year. So the chance of Daltrey touring alone is remote.\n\n“We’re all keyed up to have two years of really grafting like we used to, Daltrey says. “We’d better get going soon, or we’ll be too bloody old.”\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.

With credits to the original writer of the article from all of us music fans!\n\nHere is a very good article from way back. Excellent writing and some interesting stories in this one.\n\nRead on!\n\nBeginning a superb series by Los Angeles NME correspondent Chris Van Ness on the WHO and\n\nPete Townshend\n\nThe tenth floor of the Radisson Hotel in Denver smelled like propane gas with just a tinge of that universal room freshener that makes all hotels smell the same. Peter Rudge, key member of the Who’s management team, and I were walking down the hallway discussing preparations for my interview with Peter Townshend.\n\nAs we walked past an open doorway, Rudge stopped suddenly and stared in horror at the interior. The curtains were piled on the floor under the window ledge, the furniture was stacked crazily on one corner, the carpets were half torn off the floor and there were several holes in the walls where light fixtures used to be.\n\n“My God!” Rudge screamed as he pulled a list of room assignments from his pocket, “Is that Moon’s room?”\n\nThe panic passed quickly, however, as Rudge realised that the room was simply being renovated and drummer Keith Moon was probably asleep on the floor below.\n\n“That looked like Moon’s room in Memphis,” Rudge explained, “It cost us $1,400 to pay for the damages.”\n\n“What happened?” I asked.\n\n“He got bored,” was all Rudge answered.\n\nAS WE DISCOVERED after a couple of phone calls, both Moon and “Ox” (John Entwhistle) were safe in their rooms recovering from a long session at the Denver Playboy Club. Moon, it seems, likes to hang out and drink at Playboy Clubs.\n\nIt was still an hour until the time I was supposed to meet with Townshend, so Rudge asked me if I would like to use that hour to talk with Roger Daltry, known to the group as “Dippity Doo”. A call to “Dippity” found him washing his stage clothes in his sink. No, he couldn’t talk now, because he had to have something clean to wear for that evening’s concert.\n\nCuriously enough, when I was first introduced to Peter Townshend, he was stooped over his laundry bag sorting dirty clothes to be washed. The Who are, if nothing else, a very clean group.\n\nObsessed\n\nPETER TOWNSHEND is a man obsessed with whatever it is he is doing at any given moment. Whether it is a concert, a recording session or a rare interview, Townshend primes himself for the event. And if his energy flow is interrupted, he does not hesitate to show his temper.\n\nDuring the concert that evening, two of his six amplifiers were giving him trouble, so he simply kicked them off the back of the stage.\n\nDuring the early moments of our interview, a maid knocked on the door asking to clean the room, and she was greeted by a loud “Oh, fuck!” and a curt dismissal.\n\nFriday, the day before, had been a day off for the Who, so Townshend had had a chance to rest and set himself for an interview.\n\nOur talk was not the kind of informal question-and-answer session a performer of Townshend’s stature might grant to the press during a fleeting twenty-minute break.\n\nIt was, rather, over several hours of concentrated dialogue during which Townshend spoke very honestly and openly and seemed to go out of his way to verbalise any thoughts he had about the questions I posed.\n\nIn many ways the following is the most relevant and rewarding interview I have ever conducted. The Who are unquestionably one of the two top rock groups in existence (the other being the Rolling Stones), and both Townshend and I were aware of that fact. And that awareness seemed to be the bond that held us together for those few hours and made the communication so free and simple.\n\nThere was an urgency, if you will, on both of our parts to get the following story out as honestly and succinctly as possible.\n\nAs Townshend went down the hall to get some Coke to drink, I took a look around the room. Displayed prominently were a classical Martin guitar and a vintage “Les Paul” model — both of which Townshend is afraid to use on stage, as he has a habit of cracking or smashing his instruments.\n\nThe book he was currently reading, Angela Davis’ If They Come in the Morning, was on the dresser, and his stereo cassette player sat next to it. Interestingly enough, the cassettes in the case were all of classical music (from Bach to Vivaldi to Wagner, etc.) with one exception: Bark by the Jefferson Airplane.\n\nTownshend returned; set about eight cans of soda on the table and sat directly across from me as if prepared for a long siege.\n\nHow has a group like the Who managed to stay together so long without any apparent conflicts or threats of splitting up?\n\nWell, there have been lots of breakups threatened – quite a few in the early days, like ’65 and ’66 just previous to us coming to the States. And one fairly recently when we were trying to get the Lifehouse film together.\n\nIt sort of ended up me against the world — that sort of thing. In that particular case, I had one idea about what the group should be doing, and the group had another idea.\n\nReally, the whole thing about that occurrence was the fact that I felt that where the Who was at — and this probably still applies today — was very much a reflection, if, you like, of what’s happening to rock and roll as a whole.\n\nWe’re a rock barometer within ourselves, I feel — not so much for people watching the group, but within ourselves. We’ve got our finger on a pulse, if you like. And I felt that we were beginning to cliche ourselves in so many different ways, and that we really needed to shake ourselves up fantastically if we were going to stay in a position of being a band that was really saying what needed to be said.\n\nAnd I don’t mean that lyrically. A lot of people pick that up and say, “You’re not that lyrically heavy, anyway.” I just mean, to use very blunt terminology, we were becoming less of a rock band and more of a circus act.\n\nI felt that the stream of rock was splitting up the way it did a while back with the black and the white rock and roll. The Chuck Berrys went one way, and the pop scene went the other way. I mean it was a dreadful pop scene, but Chuck Berry’s still there waving the banner for that time and that place. He’s waving the banner desperately, but all it does is tell you about the Fifties; it doesn’t tell you about today.\n\nSo basically the group felt that we were better waving the banner for the Who and for the Sixties, if you like, that we weren’t attempting to do anything new; because we weren’t capable of doing it.\n\nI mean, that’s like asking the Who to be the new Beatles. And I thought that we were capable of doing that; I thought that we were capable of getting a film together and working on new formulas and things — new sounds on stage using tapes and using synthesis and just using all the technical things that are available, but also using a whole other sort of new energy from within the group, as well. And combining it all together in one fell swoop, we could really sort of capture what was going on.\n\nWhere was all of this new energy going to come from?\n\nWell, at the moment — to get back to the break-up thing — what happened in a way is that I think maybe the group isn’t capable of doing it now — although I think it was wrong not to try. But then, I think the Who are the Who are the Who are the Who, and we’re very much stuck with that. And if we want to do anything different, we’re going to have to break up; because we’ve got too many preconceptions of ourselves and too much ingrained in our own sort of history and our own way of doing things — which admittedly works, but it’s not changing at the same rate as the audience needs the change.\n\nI think the people will always like the Who as long as they stay together, because they are the Who; but I don’t think we’ll always be a rock and roll band — not at the rate things are going.\n\nI don’t really quite know whether that’s an indication of the fact that we might break up sometime; but there’d be no need now, because we’re so musically refreshed.\n\nI mean, we came out of the whole film problem with a fantastic amount of energy and zest just to play and just to have fun.\n\nWe got so brought down by the problem of what we were trying to get into that we ran back and picked up the guitars and banged away — as if to say “Fuck everybody!”\n\nThe Who was originally Roger’s group. Did that ever present any problems when you took over as lead guitarist?\n\nI never really “took over”.\n\nThere’s a guy working with us at the moment on a film script whose name is Nik Cohn who was really sort of pleasantly surprised at how much Roger worked within the group — like amazed that he did not work with the group. The fact is that Roger steered the group in a lot of different directions.\n\nHe steered me onto lead guitar; it could have been very easy for me not to have ever played lead, but he wanted to sing. He’s steered us through various situations, and he’s very, very powerful within the group.\n\nRather than me being the all-powerful writer, he, in his own way, allows me to write.\n\nThis is like a hint about the way we co-operate with one another. We try to make it as egoless as possible, and it gets more egoless as we go along.\n\nAt the beginning, it really was more of a situation where I felt that the only way I was ever, ever, ever going to make myself felt was through writing; so I really got obsessed with writing rock songs, and I probably concentrated far more on that than on any other single thing in life.\n\nI just used to go back after gigs and write and write and write all the time. I must have about two or three-hundred demos – from the period of “My Generation” up to “Pictures of Lily” — of unreleased things, some of which are quite good.\n\nThe difficulty in those days was that Roger freaked once totally – and this is like the first time we nearly broke up.\n\nHe got into a very very heavy scene because of the group taking drugs, because he wasn’t into it and wanted us to stop and we wouldn’t stop.\n\nAt that particular time, it was pills — ups — and we must have made a fairly repulsive scene babbling away at one another.\n\nAnyway, Keith and John and I were in Sweden, and Roger was there in body if not in spirit, and we were all leaping away like mad. Then one day, after a gig, Roger just freaked completely and tried to beat up Keith.\n\nThat was sort of the culmination of lots of events — lots of threats where Roger used to try to find answers to problems by using aggression. If you didn’t see something his way, he’d argue with you for about ten minutes and then say, “Look, don’t say anything or I’ll smash you in the mouth”.\n\nAnd that went on and on, until in the end the group just wouldn’t take it any longer — not because we were right and he was wrong, but because there was no way of finding out who was right using that method. Finally, Roger just sat in a chair and said, “Look, I don’t want to be kicked out of the group; I promise I`ll never use violence again”.\n\nAnd it was one amazing sort of transformation he went through — from being one of the most aggressive, violent people I know to being one of the most peaceful people I know. But I think it must’ve caused some frustrations.\n\nThe difficulty with that then came to be that he didn’t then say what he thought; he found other ways of getting the group to do what he wanted the group to do.\n\nSome of these are very, very strange, and I don’t think even he understands quite how he does this.\n\nI’m sure I don’t.\n\nI’m not suggesting there’s anything subversive, but it’s a strange group to fry and analyse and try to figure out how it works.\n\nI think Roger’s got a lot more to do with it than people imagine.\n\nIf you have a large collection of the following magazines, don`t throw them out, but contact me as I would be very interested in these: Creem, Circus, Hit Parader and Metal Edge.\n\nIf you have a music-related web-page where this fits – please make a link to the article.

We rarely see artists speaking so freely of their earnings these days, or at all. A top roadie, as mentioned in the article, was earning a fair amount of money as £70-a-week is the same amount as £944 these days (2020). Not too bad if you didn`t have any expenses towards hotels, travel or food.\n\nRead on!\n\nDaltrey\n\nTea in the country with the Who singer\n\nInterview by Tony Norman\n\nWE ARE SITTING in a small pub opposite Wadhurst station. In this quiet corner of East Sussex the watery winter sun filters down through proud trees and touches real green grass. It is the kind of grass we used to have in the cities. It is untouched by smoke, fumes and grime. The freshness stands out; it’s a different colour.\n\nPublicist Keith Altham and myself are creatures of the town. Our first instinct on arriving in this pleasant place was to head for warmth and booze. Outside there is real peace. Outside there is an element of space. Outside there really is unspoilt countryside. But inside there are two people insensitive to it all. One is telling the other wild and wonderful tales of Keith Moon, the well-known eccentric musician.\n\nThe door swings open and in walks Roger Daltrey, his brown boots smeared with mud. His blue jeans are tight and tatty – “uncool” to thousands who dig his music. A huge white sweater keeps out the cold. Not exactly everyone’s picture of a superstar perhaps, but what the hell? Daltrey is on holiday.\n\nWe drive to his house through country lanes at speeds touching 80 m.p.h. Roger is feeling fine driving his new Aston Martin. I am in the front, feeling nervous and exhilarated at the same time. Altham is in the back feeling sick. But we make it and on arrival inspect the 1929 vintage motor in the garage. It’s in fantastic condition, straight out of a Bogart movie. It’s even got white-walled tyres. A magnificent machine.\n\nThis beautiful house is not unlike Toad Hall in “Wind In The Willows”. It was built in 1610 and has that indefinable quality modern homes of concrete and glass lack.\n\nWe talk over a steaming mug of tea, and he tells me: “We decided to take this break while we were on an ‘up’. Around the middle of last year our playing was really going downhill. We had a lot of hassles getting the stage thing together, and that’s what The Who really exists on.\n\n“You see, ‘Tommy’ had to go. We were bored playing it, and we felt it was holding us back in the end. But having made the decision to drop it, we found we had a huge gap to fill. It really seemed impossible. “With ‘Tommy’ we were doing over two hours on stage. When you’re just doing a string of different songs, that seems a mighty long time.\n\nProgress\n\n“We finally sorted it out by pulling in the new songs from ‘Who’s Next’ and still using some of ‘Tommy’ as well as the old singles and things like that. In the end we were going down better than ever.\n\n“I think ‘See Me, Feel Me’ will always be in our act. You know the words are really true. It’s through them (the audience) that we hear the music; through them we progress. But what we really need for the future is another chunk of Who music, rather than a batch of different songs.”\n\nThe Who are keen to get a film together, and they have some ideas floating around.\n\n“It won’t just be about a group on the road,” Roger explains. “We want a film that will reflect what Rock means to The Who, and to the general public. The fact that we all have different views has made it difficult, but we do have one idea in common. But I don’t want to discuss it really. In the past we’ve done too much talking; this time we don’t want to run before we can walk.”\n\nHow about albums? When will the next be released?\n\n“Well, we’ve got some tapes of some shows we did in San Francisco. Glyn Johns says they are better quality than ‘Live At Leeds’. The trouble is, there’s only one song that we haven’t released before.”\n\nAfter “Live At Leeds” and “Mighty, Meaty”, didn’t he think the record-buyers would be tired of getting old songs? When would there be some fresh material on the market?\n\n“We’ll have to have a discussion about the ‘live’ stuff. I wouldn’t like to say whether we will release it. We have some other songs in the can from the ‘Who’s Next’ sessions, but really we want to hang off until we can get the big one (i.e. the film and an album to go with it). That will be the biggest thing we’ve ever done.”\n\nI ask him about his wealth, and the comfort surrounding him, in relation to the Capitalist Society.\n\n“We are living in a Capitalist Society and I’m not prepared to be a total anarchist. Even Communist societies aren’t that different.\n\nIn debt\n\n“So if you live in this sort of society, you’ve got to play the game. I’d like to know what these people would have done if we’d blown it and been in debt for a few thousand pounds.\n\n“Would they have bailed us out? When we say we don’t make money here (Britain), we mean it. We just about cover our living expenses and the cost of putting the show on the road.\n\n“Our last tour pulled in £12,000 and our company was £25,000 in debt.”\n\nI ask him for a breakdown on their expenses. It reads like this: ten roadies at £30-a-week; two top roadies at £70-a-week; three 4-ton-trucks — one rented at £60-a-week and two bought at around £3,000 each; plus things like petrol, hotels, equipment lights and even a portable stage (when required).\n\n“The reason we use so much equipment,” says Roger, “is that we are trying to change the ballrooms into some sort of theatre. Okay, we have made money in the States. But none of us ever try to hide anything. If you like, we’re capitalist bastards. But then, I was when I was working in a factory for £ 7-a-week.”\n\nSo now, he’s made his money. Wouldn’t he be prepared to give it all away?\n\n“No!” replies Daltrey, all neatly in perspective. “Why should I? I just wanted to be in a group, that’s all.\n\n“We always made a living, but we’ve only made real money in the past two years. Look, I’ll tell you the truth. Up to two years ago we were getting £50-a-week plus expenses.\n\n“Three years ago I had to sell my car to get the deposit for a house. So really we’ve only just started getting big money; money that doesn’t have to go straight back into our bellies.”\n\nTrouble\n\nWhen were The Who in the most trouble financially?\n\n“That would be just before we released ‘Can’t Explain’,” he said. “If we’d gone down then, we would have faced a debt of £60,000. We were getting 50 quid a night, and Pete was smashing guitars worth £200 and amps worth twice that, every night!\n\n“None of us had a car, and one of our managers had to get a job in a film to help pay our bills. It took us three years to pay off those debts.\n\n“Mind you, our standard of living went up. At the start we were getting £15-a-week and I was living in the back of the removals van we used for gigs.” He pauses and laughs: “A removals van! Even then we were thinking big!”\n\nDid the big debts worry him at the time?\n\n“No, not really. I always felt we were going to do it. I worry more now when I look back and think what trouble we could have got ourselves into. Still, at the time we were confident.\n\n“It’s funny, with The Who. We’re all so different, but when things start going badly we all pull for one another. It`s like being married to three people.\n\n“Why do we get on together? Well, in our stars we have the four elements, earth, fire, air and water. Maybe that’s got something to do with it.\n\n“We first started to get a really good reaction around the time we got our residency at The Marquee in Wardour Street. It all escalated from there. It happened so fast, it was amazing. You had the feeling anything could happen. We were the kids’ group.\n\n“It was the time of the big Mod cult, and there was nobody to represent it. We saw the opening, and they accepted us. It was a good time. You really felt part of some sort of youth culture. But where has that old sense of urgency gone now? Where’s the excitement?\n\n“When I see what’s in the singles charts, it’s depressing. It should be the place to look for the music the kids are digging today. But those records are bought by the mums and dads.\n\n“At one time the kids told the musicians what they wanted.\n\n“Now they sit back and let the musicians preach to them. Like on gigs they are saying: ‘Come on, show me what you can do. See if you can cheer me up.’\n\nTakeover\n\n“If they want to burst that frustration bubble, they’ve got to show their feelings.\n\n“One day they’re all going to get so bored, they’re gonna go out and smash windows. Then we’ll have a whole new rock’n’roll era. It’ll be starting all over again.\n\n“In many ways, football has taken over from rock. There is more of the urgency/stardom thing there. There is more competition, and the players know how to please their audience. If they don’t play well they get booed. It’s not a complacent job, whereas for the past 18 months, being a rock musician has been. The kids on the terraces really care about their team; they used to feel that way about their favourite group.\n\n“I don’t think television is helping to bring excitement back to rock. What we need is another ‘Ready Steady Go’, a show that really means something to the kids.\n\n“I mean ‘Top of the Pops’ is like an extension of the Engelbert Humperdinck show; a 40-year-old man’s view of a 12-year-old girl’s knickers.”\n\nHe is convinced we have the talent here, and that the sense of urgency he referred to can return, but the mass-media people have got to wake up.\n\n“Whether they want to admit it or not,” concludes Daltrey, “considering the size of our country, we’ve got the best rock musicians in the world.”\n\nUnspoilt\n\nBefore heading back to town he shows me round the grounds. From the back of his house there is a clear view across an unspoilt valley. No ugly electricity pylons, no filthy roads.\n\nWe think of the people who are battling through the rush of the city.\n\n“In a way, it’s their decision,” he says.\n\n“I’d rather be down here earning £ 15-a-week than chasing a big wage in London.”\n\nThe original music paper this article came from (pictured at the top) is for sale!\n\nSend me an e-mail if you are interested.
