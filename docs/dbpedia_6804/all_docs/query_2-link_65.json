        "text": "Roger Daltrey Gets Dark About Turning 80: ‘I’m On My Way Out’\n\nRoger Daltrey turned 80 on March 1, and the often blunt and forthcoming Who frontman had some pretty dark things to say about it.\n\nIn a new interview with U.K.’s The Times, Daltrey said, “I have to be realistic: I’m on my way out. The average life expectancy is 83, and with a bit of luck, I’ll make that, but we need someone else to drive things.”\n\nDespite needing “someone else to drive things,” Daltrey is hitting the road in North America this June on what he calls a “special semi-acoustic” tour. During the tour, he’ll perform hits and rarities from The Who and share stories from his career. (Fingers crossed they won’t hit you like a ton of bricks like his whole “I’m on my way out” comment.)\n\nDates for Daltrey’s tour are below, with full ticket details available at TheWho.com.\n\nJune 12 – Wolf Trap – Vienna, VA @ Filene Center\n\nJune 14 – Niagara Falls, ON @ OLG Stage at Fallsview Casino\n\nJune 16 – Bethel, NY @ Bethel Woods Center for the Arts\n\nJune 18 – Port Chester, NY @ The Capitol Theatre\n\nJune 20 – Boston, MA @ Leader Bank Pavilion\n\nJune 22 – Lenox, MA @ Tanglewood – The Koussevitzky Music Shed\n\nJune 25 – Detroit, MI @ Meadow Brook Amphitheatre\n\nJune 27 – Indianapolis, IN @ Murat Theatre at Old National Centre\n\nJune 29 – Highland Park, IL @ The Pavilion at Ravinia\n\nWhat Does This Mean for The Who?\n\nBoth Daltrey and Pete Townshend have made comments in the press about the uncertain future of The Who.\n\nIn January, Daltrey said in another interview with The Times that he couldn’t give a definitive answer because he’s not the one who writes the songs. (Townshend, of course, has always been the band’s primary songwriter.)\n\nHowever, Daltrey did say, “[Pete and I] need to sit down and have a meeting, but at the moment, I’m happy saying that part of my life is over.”\n\nIn December 2023, Townshend made similar remarks to Record Collector. He said, “I think it’s time for Roger and I to go to lunch and have a chat about what happens next.”\n\nTownshend then added, “Because [the final summer tour stop] shouldn’t feel like the end of anything, but it feels like the end of an era.”\n\nAs far as performing and touring goes, Townshend stressed that it all depends on a few factors. Among them is whether an idea would be doable and profitable. Perhaps the most important factor is whether an idea would even be fun to do. Believe it or not, Townshend said he’s had a lot of fun on the road lately, even though he’s said in the past he’s not super fond of touring.\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
