        "text": "12 songs into his set in Florida\n\nThe Who’s Roger Daltrey was forced to abandon his concert in Florida on Saturday night (11th February) over apparent fears he might damage his voice.\n\nDaltrey’s show at the 2,180-capacity Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater served as a warm-up for his headline slot at the Rock Legends Cruise this week.\n\nDaltrey complained of indigestion and not being able to hear his band mates during the set, and the performance came to a halt 12 songs in during The Who’s ‘Naked Eye’.\n\nGuitarist Simon Townshend, son of Pete Townshend, had earlier taken over lead vocal duties on The Who’s ‘Going Mobile’ and his own track ‘The Way It Is.’\n\n78-year-old Daltrey told the audience: \"I’m going to do myself some serious damage here and I’m not going to do it because I’ll never sing again!\n\n\"I’m sorry! You’ll have to ask for refunds. I’ll try and make it up to you. I’m really, really sorry. I am not a robot! I am definitely not a robot! I’m not doing this to myself anymore. Thank you so much for coming.\"\n\nRoger Daltrey abandons concert in Florida:\n\nDaltrey hasn’t released an official statement, however many fans have taken to social media to share what happened.\n\nOne attendee wrote: “He sounded excellent, especially at the beginning of the show (he opened with I ‘Can See For Miles’). Just so weird how it all went down. He stopped 4 or 5 songs right in the middle and made a few different excuses why (the sound, his hearing, and then being sick). I was astonished. Hope he’s OK.”\n\nAnother supportive fan said: “Thank you for giving it a go. Things started great and I know you tried your hardest to keep going. Take care of yourself and feel better!”\n\nA fellow gig goer wrote: “Feel better soon. I have to admit we were disappointed last night. But you need to take care of your health.”\n\nThe Rock Legends Cruise set sail from Florida yesterday (13th February) and Daltrey appears on a bill that features Deep Purple, George Thorogood, Randy Bachman, Lou Gramm, The Marshall Tucker Band, Roger Trout and many more.\n\nLast month, The Who announced the Hits Back! UK tour for July 2023 visiting outdoor venues and one arena.\n\nThe band will be flanked by a full orchestra each night on the nine-date tour that visits Hull, Edinburgh, London, Derby, Bristol, Durham, St Helens and Brighton.\n\nTickets are on sale from Absolute Radio Tickets now.\n\nThe Who’s Hits Back UK tour dates:\n\nJULY 2023\n\nHull Sewell Group Craven Park – Thu 6th\n\nEdinburgh Castle – Sat 8th\n\nEdinburgh Castle – Sun 9th\n\nLondon The O2 – Wed 12th\n\nDerby The Incora County Ground – Fri 14th\n\nBristol Badminton Estate – Sun 16th\n\nDurham Seat Unique Riverside – Wed 19th\n\nSt Helens Totally Wicked Stadium– Fri 21st\n\nBrighton The 1st Central County Ground – Sun 23rd\n\nRock stars who are related to other celebrities:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
