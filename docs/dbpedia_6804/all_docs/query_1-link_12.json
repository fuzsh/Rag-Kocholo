        "text": "Look closer to find nine song titles: Squeeze Box; Won’t Get Fooled Again; Pinball Wizard; Baba O’Riley; Magic Bus; I’m a Boy; Who Are You; I Can See For Miles; Join Together\n\nRoger Daltrey\n\nRobert Roger Harry Daltrey CBE, was born on March 1st 1944, in East Acton, west London, England, one of three children. His father, Harry Daltrey, fought in World War II at the time, and came home a few years later. Acton is the same working-class suburban district that produced fellow Who members Pete Townshend, and John Entwistle.\n\nDaltrey attended Victoria Primary School and then Acton County Grammar School along with Townshend and Entwistle. He ranked at the top of his class in the English state school system. That led to his enrollment at the Acton County Grammar School. His parents hoped that he would continue on to study at university, but Daltrey turned out to be a self-described “school rebel” and developed a dedicated interest in the emerging rock and roll music scene instead.\n\nHe made his first guitar from a block of wood, a cherry red Stratocaster replica, and was lead singer in a skiffle band called the Detours. They told him to bring a guitar. Within a few weeks he showed up with it. When his father bought him an Epiphone guitar in 1959, he became the lead guitarist for the band; soon afterwards he was expelled from school for tobacco smoking.\n\nTownshend wrote in his autobiography, “until he was expelled Roger had been a good pupil.”\n\nDaltrey is the founder and lead singer of the rock band the Who, which released 14 singles that entered the Top 10 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including “I Can’t Explain”, “My Generation”, “Substitute”, “I’m a Boy”, “Happy Jack”, “Pictures of Lily”, “Pinball Wizard”, “Won’t Get Fooled Again”, and “You Better You Bet”. Daltrey began his solo career in 1973, while still a member of the Who. Since then, he has released eight studio albums, five compilation albums, and one live album. His solo hits include “Giving It All Away”, “Walking the Dog”, “Written on the Wind”, “Free Me”, “Without Your Love”, “Walking in My Sleep”, “After the Fire”, and “Under a Raging Moon”. In 2010, he was ranked as number 61 on Rolling Stone‘s list of the 100 greatest singers of all time.\n\nDaltrey is famed for his powerful voice and energetic stage presence.\n\nHe was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 1990, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. The Who are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide. He and Townshend received Kennedy Center Honors, 2008, The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA, May 21st 2016.\n\n-credit Wikipedia\n\nThe artwork:\n\nEach illustration has one of the first prints sold to benefit a non-profit.
