        "text": "Sixty years after forming the Who, rocker Roger Daltrey is back on tour. And he says fans can expect a stark departure from his previous shows.\n\nThe Who, with bassist John Entwistle, guitarist Pete Townshend and drummer Keith Moon, conquered the charts with such hits as “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” “My Generation,” “I Can See for Miles,” “Substitute” and “You Better You Bet” and fattened its artistic legacy with ambitious works including rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia.\n\nAARP Membership— $12 for your first year when you sign up for Automatic Renewal\n\nGet instant access to members-only products and hundreds of discounts, a free second membership, and a subscription to AARP the Magazine.\n\nJoin Now\n\nThe British rock band also raised the live performance bar with Moon’s savage bashing and Townshend’s guitar windmills. Daltrey rose as one of the most iconic showmen in the rock era, a golden-maned, bare-chested howler in a fringed suede coat twirling a microphone.\n\nBreakups, reunions, infighting, substance abuse and reckless behavior also crop up frequently on the group’s résumé. Keith Moon died at 32 of a sedative overdose in 1988. Entwistle died at 57 of a heart attack in 2002.\n\nDaltrey, 80, and Townshend, 79, have continued to carry the battle-frayed banner, but are they in the final stretch? Who knows — not even Daltrey. He spoke to AARP from his farm in Sussex, England, where he lives with his wife, Heather, and shares details of his new tour, his relationship with Townshend and the secrets to his long marriage.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThis tour’s intimate approach is a radical departure from the last two big Who tours.\n\nI’ve got some different instrumentation. I’ve got a squeeze-box, piano, no synthesizers. Violin, mandola. It allows me to open up some of the old Who classics in ways that present them as different songs. It’s really refreshing to have the freedom to not be tied to tape loops and to be able to generate sounds and moods that get washed out in really loud rock ’n’ roll. Of course, Townshend’s lyrics are so good, they work in any formula.\n\nYou’re not just singing Pete’s songs.\n\nI do loads of songs. I have a long solo recording career. I do those and songs I recorded with other people. I did an album, Going Back Home (2014) with Wilko Johnson. It’s very breezy, down-home, different from anything Pete would have written. It’s absolutely liberating. The whole idea is, it’s a miserable world out there at the moment. Let’s have a good night out. If anything can dig us out of the hole the world’s in, music will do it. I get a chance to get closer to the audience. They can leave questions at the box office, and I go through them before the show and answer the interesting ones onstage.\n\nWhat are fans most curious to know about you?\n\nThe color of my underpants. I really don’t know. They never cease to amaze me, especially the really loyal fans, who seem to turn up at every show. Actually, they’re all mad. I think it’s a psychosis. I do appreciate their support, but I do find it peculiar.\n\nIn 2011, you staged the Who’s Tommy on a solo tour. Was it challenging to tackle that on your own?\n\nThat’s what I liked about it. I like things that challenge me. I don’t like to just go through the motions of what we always did. [When] I did the orchestra shows with Tommy, that’s the first time it was ever played in its entirety. Even in its day, we never ever played “Welcome.” I ended up with an opinion that Tommy is probably the best opera ever written.\n\nIn April, Pete told The New York Times, “I don’t get much of a buzz from performing with the Who. If I’m really honest, I’ve been touring for the money.” Are we looking at the end days of the Who?\n\nI can’t do it for the money, and I don’t want to be out there with someone doing it only for the money. I go out there to deliver whatever energy I’ve got to my audience. I know how hard it was to work and buy those tickets. I did that in the early days, watching my first rock heroes in the late ’50s after saving up four to six weeks to buy a ticket. I don’t want to go and watch someone dialing it in. I don’t want to work with someone like that. So perhaps it is the end unless his attitude changes and he can try and find the passion for it again.\n\nShopping & Groceries\n\nWalmart+\n\n$20 off a Walmart+ annual membership\n\nSee more Shopping & Groceries offers >\n\nAre you going to do something about it? Talk to him?\n\nHow can I do anything about it? It’s not my problem. It’s his. My commitment is always there. I’m committed to not half doing it. It’s painful. If he’s going to go on tour with that attitude, my job becomes twice as hard. He seems to do it all in the press. And then I read about it and discuss it with you. Talk your head out, Pete. If you 100 percent want to do it, I’ll be there for you. If not, why would I want to?\n\nIf he throws in the towel, how do you see your career going forward?\n\nI’ve got a solo career, and I’m very happy in it. I don’t need to earn oodles of money. I’m a musician, a singer. I can play bar mitzvahs and funerals. There could be more of those coming up. We did what we did, and I’m very, very grateful for it. I shall miss it. But I can’t half do it. It would be cheating our fans. It would be cheating everything we stood for.\n\nHas your relationship with Pete mellowed since 1961?\n\nNo. I think the world of him. He’s a difficult cuss. He will say the same thing about me. He’s the north pole and I’m the south pole. Somewhere in between there is incredible chemistry. I put this group together in the first place. I’ve been with him since he was 16. Remember, I was the only straight one, with three addicts.\n\nHow did you navigate that chaos?\n\nSomeone had to control them. I was married very early on with a wife and a baby at 19 years old. I had no alternative but to make this band work. I did not want to go back to sheet metal work. Whereas they were party animals who just wanted to have a good time.\n\nYou had discipline the others lacked, but you were also known as a brawler.\n\nWhen you’re dealing with somebody who’s just had two bottles of brandy and was spitting at you and kicking you, you kind of had to be a brawler. It’s how it worked. I don’t question it.\n\nDespite the mayhem, did you sense the Who was bound for greatness?\n\nA singer never sees the band. You are center stage, and you feel them. I used to be out front listening. I knew that our first drummer was completely wrong. Before Keith Moon joined, we were like every rock ’n’ roll band on the circuit. As soon as Keith joined, within a week, we were unique. The Who made headlines for smashing equipment and trashing hotel rooms. You didn’t approve or participate. I recognized its value. It got us noticed. It’s like a kid in a ghetto spraying his name on a wall. That doesn’t mean I particularly liked it. I especially didn’t like paying for it. It cost us a great deal of money.\n\nYou, Mick Jagger and Robert Plant are considered among the best showmen in rock history. What does it take to be a great rock singer?\n\nMick Jagger is possibly the best front man there ever will be. Him and James Brown. Without James Brown, Mick would have never learned his stage show. Freddie Mercury was a great singer and entertainer. It’s horses for courses. I can’t be objective. I always felt I was kind of introverted on stage. Swinging the microphone, I was just kind of trying to knit everything up into this ballet: Keith’s mad drumming behind me, Pete’s Mexican jumping bean windmill lunacy on one side and John standing completely stoic on the other. I used to feel the microphone whizzing about, and by God, it used to whiz about. Like I say, I’ve never seen it, so I don’t know.\n\nYou’ve released 10 solo studio albums and lots of other recordings. Did you ever consider leaving the Who?\n\nI had a chance to go solo in 1973 when I had a huge solo record, my first, called Daltrey. I was actually selling more records than the Who, and the record company was worried about me creating a Rod Stewart/Small Faces situation. It’s my band! I’m not leaving the band. We were not doing anything at the moment. Pete was writing another load of songs, and I had to wait for them. But I wanted to keep singing.\n\nIn terms of skills, what have you gained and lost over time?\n\nMy voice is better than ever. My hearing has suffered terribly. Mostly it suffered from the factory rather than the band. I used to be on a grind wheel all day, grinding welds on belt grafts. We had no ear defenders in those days. I think that did more damage to my ears than ever the Who did, even though I call my right ear my Entwistle ear and my left ear my Townshend ear.\n\nWhat is behind the band’s influence and longevity?\n\nAll I can say is that Pete wrote songs from a perspective totally different from almost anybody else out there. When it comes to be studied in the future, not in our lifetimes, they will realize that he was up on another level. He was writing internal songs that spoke to a different part of you than most pop music did. And he was talented enough to put voice structures and chord structures together so that his songs don’t seem to date, whereas quite a lot of pop and rock songs you listen to years later, you think, By God, that sounds old-fashioned. You hear “Baba O’Riley,” for instance, it sounds as fresh as the day it was made.\n\nWas there an upside to growing up in a poor neighborhood?\n\nWe didn’t have much money, but we were incredibly wealthy because we had a fantastic community. We were post-war. We really knew how to support each other. But now everyone is divided, and everyone has to have a neurosis.\n\nYou and Heather tied the knot in 1971. What’s your secret to a lasting marriage?\n\nShe’s starting to like me. There’s no secret. I got lucky. I’ve got a lovely family. I like rural life. I like country people. It got so heavy for me in the late ’60s, early ’70s. It got unbearable to go out and get shoved under the lens of a microscope. I moved to the countryside and bought myself a farm. I love it. It kept me grounded. It kept me from going off the rails.\n\nWhat’s the status of the Keith Moon movie you’ve been working on for so long?\n\nWe’re looking for directors. As soon as I get a director, I can do the final draft of the script. I think I’ve found the perfect Keith Moon, at least a good prototype. I would like for people to realize why we loved him so much and how clever and smart he was, but also how flawed he was. He was the most extraordinary man I ever met in my life. I want to make a proper film. Cinema seems to have lost its way. Film should be bigger than TV, brighter than TV. What they make now for streaming are these fuzzy, dull pictures for small screens that go on forever. We are going backwards.\n\nAnything else you’d like to say?\n\nMake mine a large whiskey."
