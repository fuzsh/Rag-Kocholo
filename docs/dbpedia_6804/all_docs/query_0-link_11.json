        "text": "Roger Daltrey had some interesting words about The Rolling Stones in a new interview.\n\nSpeaking with The Coda Collection, Daltrey said when asked about the Stones, “You’ve got to take your hat off to [Mick Jagger.] He’s the number one rock ‘n’ roll performer. But as a band, if you were outside a pub and you heard that music coming out of a pub some night, you’d think, ‘Well, that’s a mediocre pub band!'”\n\nDaltrey’s words seem to reflect Paul McCartney’s similar thoughts about The Rolling Stones. Sir Paul said in an interview with The New Yorker last month, “I’m not sure I should say it, but they’re a blues cover band, that’s sort of what the Stones are. I think [The Beatles’] net was cast a bit wider than theirs.”\n\nOf course, The Rolling Stones don’t seem to care about what their contemporaries think of them. After all, when you’re on average making $10 million per tour stop, you tend not to hear the haters over the “Cha Ching” sound of metaphorical cash registers.\n\nRolling Stones: Their 50 Best Songs Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
