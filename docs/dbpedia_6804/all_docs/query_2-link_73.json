        "text": "The Who’s co-founder and lead vocalist Roger Daltrey will perform at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in Bethel, NY, on Sunday, June 16 (6-16-2024) as part of his 2024 nine-date North American solo tour. The concert starts at 7:30 p.m.\n\nTICKETS: See Roger Daltrey in concert for as low as $3.\n\nThe tour kicks off on June 12 in Vienna, VA, and concludes on June 29 in Highland Park, IL. The “My Generation” singer will be joined by special guest “Suddenly I See” pop-rock icon KT Tunstall for select dates.\n\nDaltrey’s touring band will include Pete Townshend’s brother Simon Townshend (guitar), Billy Nicholls (mandolin), Jody Linscott (percussion), Doug Boyle (guitar), John Hogg (bass), Katie Jacoby (violin), Steve Weston (harmonica), Geraint Watkins (keyboards-accordion) and Scott Devours (drums).\n\n“I’ve done all those years with The Who, and I’ve done my solo stuff and charity gigs and all that,” Daltrey told Billboard. “I just want to branch out and do something different ... I’m just determined to enjoy myself and explore the freedom I’ve got to do what I want to do on this tour, and let’s see where it ends up.”\n\nWhere to buy Roger Daltrey concert tickets:\n\nTicketmaster has limited standard admission seating available for Roger Daltrey’s June 16 concert at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in Bethel, NY, but greater availability and deals are offered by Vivid Seats, SeatGeek or StubHub.\n\nRight now, fans can score tickets for as low as $3 before fees. Here’s a look at the best prices available:\n\nVivid Seats: Starting at $4\n\nSeatGeek: Starting at $3\n\nStubHub: Starting at $3\n\nPrices are noted at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\n\nRelated: Lionel Richie and Earth, Wind & Fire performing in Buffalo, NY: How to get tickets as low as $8\n\nWhere else is Roger Daltrey playing?\n\nSee the complete list of tour dates and where to buy tickets below:\n\nJune 12 - Wolf Trap – Filene Center - Vienna, VA (TICKETS)\n\nJune 14 - OLG Stage at Fallsview Casino - Niagara Falls, ON (TICKETS)\n\nJune 16 - Bethel Woods Center for the Arts - Bethel, NY (TICKETS)\n\nJune 18 - The Capitol Theatre - Port Chester, NY (TICKETS)\n\nJune 20 - Leader Bank Pavilion - Boston, MA (TICKETS)\n\nJune 22 - Tanglewood – The Koussevitzky Music Shed - Lenox, MA (TICKETS)\n\nJune 23 - Mohegan Sun – Uncasville, CT (TICKETS)\n\nJune 25 - Meadow Brook Amphitheatre - Detroit, MI (TICKETS)\n\nJune 29 - The Pavilion at Ravinia - Highland Park, IL (TICKETS)\n\nWhat is Roger Daltrey’s setlist?\n\nDon’t ask! Roger Daltrey recently shared in his interview with Billboard that one of his pet peeves about “concerts these days” is concert-goers insisting they need to know the setlist before attending, taking the fun out of the surprise, according to him.\n\nHowever, if you must know, Daltrey did reveal he’d be playing “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” and based on past setlists, fans can expect more “The Who” favorites like “Won’t Get Fooled Again”, “Baba O’Riley,” “The Kids Are Already” and others. Although, the setlist will likely vary from city to city."
