        "text": "You will need to read up a bit regarding rock history. Daltrey and Townsend famously used Jagger and Richards as their role models in terms of stage presence and Townsend nicked Keith’s way of playing the guitar.\n\nThe Stones never tried to hide their inspirations. But they created a totally unique and original sound with great songs, which has been imitated by thousands of rock groups ever since, The Who included. Read Townsends bio if in doubt.\n\n“Biggest imitators”, says the guy who post a video of Blind Faith, featuring Stevie “Ray Charles” Winwood, Eric “Freddie King” Clapton and Ginger “Elvin Jones” Baker.\n\nUsing that premise, no one is original.\n\n“Standing on the shoulder of giants”.\n\nWell, if we are going to discuss it in that \"precise\" way, then it really must be said that the whole white blues-rock stuff from the late 60's as a subgenre was based on imitation of original black musicians. After all, that's why the covers are so frequent on those albums and fans of that genre don't mind so much \"tribute to...\".\n\nAnd that’s why Tommy is on another level compared to Let It Bleed, because Tommy doesn’t imitate anything. Unlike Let It Bleed, or any other Stones' record, Tommy is an indigenous work of art.\n\nI know what you are saying, and you are right that the Who were a much more ambitious band than the stones. But their rock operas don't give me the kind of pleasure that 'sticky fingers' or 'beggars banquet' do.\n\nWell your hero Roger knows the score (and always openly has) with Jagger but you don't seem to grasp it and agree with him, I am sure if the Who were as successful or as well known worldwide as the Stones you would be far happier.\n\nAnd Townshend thought little of him musically until the late 60's in relation to his other bandmates as witnessed in the excellent Who documentary Amazing Journey.\n\nPete said that Roger was: \"Just..... a singer!\"\n\nThat is an opinion not everyone agrees with. Many of us think he's written some of his best songs this century.\n\nTommy is very ambitious yes but at times a bit of an over reach and it works way, way better live than the tame studio recordings.\n\nWell, unlike your hero Mick, Mr Daltrey as a frontman had to fight hard to take the attention away from Pete Townshend and Keith Moon.\n\nVery shortsighted, in my opinion.\n\nObviously, you regard The Who higher than The Stones, fair enough, but you are not very objective with your views on those 2 very different bands.\n\nTommy is every bit as imitated as something The Stones did. Townsend imitates The Beach Boys and composition music, which had in part already been done in England by The Beatles and The Kinks. The ‘rock opera’ thing was already made by Brian Wilson who was inspired by Gershwin.\n\nTommy is a record made when the path for such music was already laid out.\n\nJust because The Who took a different path than The Stones, doesn’t make them any more original.\n\nI'll give Pete credit for working to expand the bounds of the rock album format, but at times, Tommy sags under the weight of its lofty pretensions. There are great moments in there, but it can also be tedious. It's one of those albums that I admire more than I enjoy. I would agree that the live presentation was more visceral and potent.\n\nNo, you obviously don't know. Actually, for writing Tommy, Pete Townshend was influenced by psychedelic rock album S.F. Sorrow by the English band Pretty Things. Released in December 1968, S.F. Sorrow was probably the first rock-opera ever released.\n\nThis is getting a bit silly and Mick ain't my hero but if you want to go that angle early on he had to compete with Brian Jones for attention on stage.\n\nRoger is great and it was smart & cool that he came up with the onstage mic lasso bit as he is not a natural or fluid mover to begin with.\n\nI feel very similarly to you and iam a Who fan."
