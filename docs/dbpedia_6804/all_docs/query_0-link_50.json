        "text": "There are two events in popland that can always be depended upon to produce major excitement: the debut of a new act with legitimate superstar potential and the return of a group of authentic superstars.\n\nIn the new category is the Tubes, the San Francisco rock‐theater troupe and the musical equivalent of such satirical acting groups as the Committee and the Credibility Gap. Originally scheduled for October, the Tubes's New York debut will finally take place on Nov. 6 when the group launches a four‐night run at the popular Greenwich Village rock club, the Bottom Line.\n\nIn the “old” category is the Who, the English hard rock quartet and one of the world's most popular rock acts. The Who begins its most extensive tour of the United States since 1971 on Nov. 20 in Texas, where it becomes the first rock act to play the Summit, Houston's new $18‐million sports and entertainment\n\nSeven musicians and eight dancers comprise the nucleus of the Tubes performing company, and four 25‐inch television monitors are also a necessary part of the group's elaborate stage decor. In order to accommodate this extravagant act, the rock club will lengthen its stage by 14 feet and increase its depth by five feet.\n\n“There were a million bands in San Francisco four years ago when we started our group,” observes Fee Waybill, the Tubes's 25‐year‐old lead singer, “so we were determined to be weird enough to draw attention to ourselves.”\n\nThey have evidently succeeded. The Tubes's “weird” persona has been hailed by many critics as the sophisticated mating of rock and theater to date. Currently the act takes the form of a series of sassy production numbers that parody rock heroes like Bryan Ferry as well as a wide‐ranging batch of other subjects including the radicalization of Patty Hearst, Rodgers and Hammerstein's “South Pacific,” and the movie moneymaker “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.”\n\nDuring the course of the 90‐minute performance, Waybill appears as “Fee‐del” Castro, Henry Kissinger, Tom Jones, “Little Earl” (the leader of an Osmond‐Brotherstype group called “Little Earl and the Pearls of Wisdom”), and finally as “Quay Lewd,” an arrogant, dumb English rock superstar in the style of Rod Stewart, Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant or the Who's Roger Daltrey. Dressed in 14‐inch platform boots, standing in a thundercloud of glitter, fending off groupies, he leads the audience in a nonsensical rock anthem entitled “White Punks on Dope.”\n\n“People take a lot of things too seriously,” says Waybill of his group's attitude toward English hard rock. “We're lighthearted and we enjoy ourselves by making fun of some of pop and rock's more outstanding turkeys.”\n\nThose who do not share the Tubes's attitude towards English hard rock and take it very seriously indeed will flock to the Who. The group's tour will include 19 cities and 20 concerts during a threeweek period that will end on Dec. 15. After a six‐week hiatus the group will resume their trek through early spring, when they take another rest before hitting the road again.\n\nNo dates have yet been announced for a New York City appearance. When the group played a special engagement at Madison Square Garden last June, some observers reported that the Who — now 11 years old seemed unrehearsed, lackluster, and a little too old for the shenanigans required of rock musicians. Whether or not the Who will be able to regain their old confidence this time around and sustain a tour of such length is the big question.\n\nRecycled Hits\n\nThe success of Ray Stevens's rhythmic, country version of the pop standard “Misty,” as well as the Ritchie Family's sleek disco version of the 1940's “Brazil,” has suddenly made the revival and rearranging of pop hits from the past one sure way to achieve a new hit. Currently on the pop mu sic popularity charts, for example, are “I Only Have Eyes for You,” crooned sweetly by Art Garfunkel; the Doris Day mid‐1950's hit, “Secret Love,” given an impassioned reading both in English and Spanish by Freddy Fender; and “Indian Love Call,” trilled gleefully by Ray Stevens.\n\nOther popular disco reworkings include Frankie Valli's “Our Day Will Come,” a hit for Ruby and the Romantics 12 years ago; the English arranger‐producer Biddu's version of Michel Le Grand's “Summer of '42”; Esther Phillips's uptempo “What A Difference A Day Makes,” originally a vehicle for Dinah Washington in 1959; “Summer Place '76,” Percy Faith's new arrangement of his 12‐year‐old hit; and a merry updating by bassist Ron Carter and flutist Hubert Laws of “Anything Goes.”\n\nMost major music publishers are in agreement that the trend towards new versions of standards and past pop hits is going to continue. “Artists who want hits,” explained one publisher, “know that recycling a proven song of yesteryear gives one a headstart towards having a new hit. Even those artists who write their own material know they have a much better shot with something proven.”\n\nVideo Rock\n\nPlans are now being drawn up to establish the Bottom Line as the point of origin for a series of one‐hour stereo video cassettes featuring prominent rock and folk performers. These cassettes will be rented on a weekly basis by Projectivision, a video distribution company, to bars and restaurants that possess specially designed seven‐foot television screens manufactured by the Advent Corporation in Cambridge, Mass. There are 3,500 of these monster‐sized TV screens currently in operation across. the United States and they've proved a popular diversion with eaters and drinkers. ■"
