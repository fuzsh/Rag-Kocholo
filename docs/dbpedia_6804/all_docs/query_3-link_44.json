        "text": "In June and July 2022, Roger Daltrey embarked on his first UK solo tour since 2011. In crafting a completely new show, Roger decided to perform not only Who hits but also Who rarities, solo hits, and other songs from his incredible near 60-year career, performed with a new semi-acoustic rock-based band. He also decided to share some anecdotes with the audience from his life in and out of music by way of a Q and A. The result was a tour received ecstatically by fans and enjoyed by Roger and all who took part. Now, Roger plans to take it far afield in 2024 and will be headed to Bethel Woods Center for the Arts on June 16, joined by special guest KT Tunstall."
