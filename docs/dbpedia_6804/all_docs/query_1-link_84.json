        "text": "Roger Daltrey, one of the U.K.s greatest singers, is striking out across the U.K. this November, a return to performing that cannot come soon enough for THE WHO legend.\n\n\"The truth is singers need to sing,\" says Roger. \"Use it or lose it.\"\n\nThe show, which will comprise of a unique mix of music and conversation, is built around Roger's musical journey and encompasses nearly every style imaginable — including blues, rock, country, soul and metal.\n\nDuring the evening, the 77-year-old rocker will dig into his incredible back catalog, pulling from his nine solo albums, album with Wilko Johnson and even reinterpreting a few WHO classics and rarities.\n\nThis is a show for real music fans and will give a unique insight into how all these great songs came about; what the influences were and where the sounds originated. As with everything Roger does, it will be totally real and authentic and lots of it — a plethora of songs with some questions answered and rock and roll stories along the way — nothing phoned in.\n\n\"Throughout my life, I have sung with so many great musicians, from the heavy rock of THE WHO and Wilko Johnson, to the Irish lilt of THE CHIEFTAINS,\" Roger says. \"On this tour I want to take the audience on a musical journey through my career as a singer, with a show of songs and sounds that explores and surprises. I look forward to having closer contact with my audience than festivals and arenas allow. Leaving time to chat.\n\n\"It's important to get our road crew working again. Without these guys, the halls would go silent. It's also clear that live music is an important part of all our lives, something to free us from the groundhog days that life has become. This pandemic has brought home to me what an important part of me singing is and it's made me determined to get back onstage ASAP. See you soon!\"\n\nTour dates:\n\nNov. 07 - Birmingham, UK - Symphony Hall\n\nNov. 09 - Manchester, UK - O2 Apollo\n\nNov. 11 - Nottingham, UK - Royal Concert Hall\n\nNov. 15 - London, UK - LondonPalladium\n\nNov. 17 - Brighton, UK - Brighton Centre\n\nNov. 19 - Southend-on-Sea, UK - Cliffs Pavilion\n\nNov. 21 - Oxford, UK - New Theatre Oxford\n\nNov. 24 - Glasgow, UK - SEC Armadillo\n\nNov. 26 - Newcastle, UK - O2 City Hall\n\nNov. 29 - Liverpool, UK - Empire Theatre\n\nDec. 01 - Portsmouth, UK - Guildhall\n\nDec. 02 - Bournemouth, UK - International Centre\n\nTickets go on sale this Friday, September 10 at 9 a.m.\n\nRoger's solo career began in 1973 with the single \"Giving It All Away\", which reached No. 5 in the U.K. chart. It was a track from his first solo album \"Daltrey\", released that same year, which he followed up with eight more albums, including 2018's acclaimed Top 10 U.K.-charting \"As Long As I Have You\", as well as his collaboration with Wilko Johnson in 2014 on their Top 5 album \"Going Back Home\".\n\nAs frontman of THE WHO, one of two remaining founding members of the British rock institution and perhaps the most exciting live bands of all time, Roger is rightly recognized as the one of the great vocalists. Timeless songs like \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", \"Substitute\", \"My Generation\", \"Behind Blue Eyes\" and \"The Kids Are Alright\" are just some of THE WHO's greatest hits."
