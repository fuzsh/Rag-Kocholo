        "text": "The Who’s Roger Daltrey says the iconic British-born rock band may not be able to tour the United States again due to high costs and financial risks.\n\nDaltrey says the chances are “very doubtful” that the band will hit the States.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nSpeaking to USA Today while promoting the band’s most recent live album, The Who with Orchestra: Live at Wembley, the 79-year-old frontman said, ” I don’t know if we’ll ever come back to tour America,” he shared. “I never say never, but at the moment it’s very doubtful.”\n\nHe added, “We cannot get insured and most of the big bands doing arena shows, by the time they do their first show and rehearsals and get the staging and crew together, all the buses and hotels, you’re upwards $600,000 to a million in the hole. To earn that back, if you’re doing a 12-show run, you don’t start to earn it back until the seventh or eighth show.”\n\nDaltrey finished, “That’s just how the business works. The trouble now is if you get COVID after the first show, you’ve (lost) that money.”\n\nFor those who want to catch the band, The Who has European tour dates slated this summer, beginning on June 14.\n\nIn other The Who news, Daltrey recently noted that he has “an actor in mind” for the forthcoming Keith Moon biopic. Moon, of course, was the wild former drummer of The Who, who died in 1978.\n\nCheck out the European tour dates for The Who below.\n\nThe Who 2023 Tour Dates:\n\n06/14 – Barcelona, ES @ Palau Sant Jordi\n\n06/17 – Florence, IT @ Firenze Rocks, Visarno Arena\n\n06/20 – Berlin, DE @ Waldbühne\n\n06/23 – Paris, FR @ La Défense Arena\n\n07/06 – Hull, UK @ Sewell Group Craven Hill Park\n\n07/08 – Edinburgh, UK @ Edinburgh Castle\n\n07/09 – Edinburgh, UK @ Edinburgh Castle\n\n07/12 – London, UK @ The O2\n\n07/14 – Derby, UK @ The Incora County Ground\n\n07/16 – Bristol, UK @ The Badminton Estate\n\n07/19 – Durham, UK @ Seat Unique Riverside\n\n07/21 – St Helens, UK @ Totally Wicked Stadium\n\n07/23 – Brighton, UK @ The 1st Central County Ground\n\n08/28 – Sandringham, UK @ Royal Sandringham Estate, Norfolk\n\nPhoto by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images"
