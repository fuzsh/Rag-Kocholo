        "text": "Starring: Bruce Lee, John Saxon, Jim Kelly, Ahna Capri\n\nIn his final film appearance, Bruce Lee goes undercover to spy on a reclusive crime lord named Han (believed to control an Opium trade) by participating in his brutal martial arts tournament. At the tournament Lee encounters two Vietnam war buddies, Roper and Williams, who are each having to fight for different reasons. Lee’s job is to get the information and the three off of the crazy island alive! Enter the Dragon is the first Chinese martial arts film produced by a Hollywood studio and includes some of the most badass fight scenes in movie history!\n\nStarring: Joaquin Phoenix, Jonah Hill, Rooney Mara\n\nAfter nearly dying in a car accident, the last thing Oregon slacker John Callahan intends to do is give up alcohol. Encouraged by his girlfriend and a charismatic sponsor, Callahan reluctantly enters a treatment program and discovers that he has a knack for drawing. The budding artist soon finds himself with a new lease on life when his edgy and irreverent newspaper cartoons gain a national and devoted following.\n\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric Kyles\n\nReverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is a solitary, middle-aged parish pastor at a small Dutch Reform church in upstate New York on the cusp of celebrating its 250th anniversary. Once a stop on the Underground Railroad, the church is now a tourist attraction catering to a dwindling congregation, eclipsed by its nearby parent church, Abundant Life, with its state-of-the-art facilities and 5,000-strong flock. When a pregnant parishioner (Amanda Seyfried) asks Reverend Toller to counsel her husband, a radical environmentalist, the clergyman finds himself plunged into his own tormented past, and equally despairing future, until he finds redemption in an act of grandiose violence. From writer-director Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver; American Gigolo; Affliction) comes a gripping thriller about a crisis of faith that is at once personal, political, and planetary.\n\nThis electrifying journey through the public and private worlds of pop culture mega-icon Grace Jones contrasts musical sequences with intimate personal footage, all the while brimming with Jones’s bold aesthetic. A larger-than-life entertainer, an androgynous glam-pop diva, an unpredictable media presence – Grace Jones is all these things and more. Sophie Fiennes’s documentary goes beyond the traditional music biography, offering a portrait as stylish and unconventional as its subject.\n\nStarring: Ron Perlman, Judith Vittet, Daniel Emilfork, Dominique Pinon\n\nIn a not-so-distant surrealist future, a demented scientist unable to dream steals the dreams of young children so that he may stave off aging and subsequent death. In order to procure these dreams Krank employs a bio-mechanical kidnapping cult that grabs young children and houses them on a remote ocean rig (hence The City of Lost Children). But when carnival strongman and former Russian sailor named One (Ron Perlman) seeks to find his kidnapped brother, along with the help of a little orphan girl, he fights brings the whole operation down. Made by the same creators of Delicatessen and Amelie, The City of Lost Children invokes an entirely different world; one with a talking brain housed in a tank, clones, conjoined twins, and a circus performer with trained fleas.\n\nStarring: Angela Bassett, Taye Diggs, Regina King, Whoopi Goldberg\n\nThrough good times and bad, Stella and Delilah have always had each other. Now, Stella’s so busy building a life that she’s forgotten how to really live. But Delilah is about to change all that. What starts as a quick trip to Jamaica, end as an exhilarating voyage of self discovery as Stella learns to open her heart and find love – even if it’s with a man 20 years her junior.\n\nStarring: Christina Ricci, Thora Birch, Gaby Hoffman, Ashleigh Aston Moore, Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith, Rosie O’Donnell, Rita Wilson\n\nWaxing nostalgic about the bittersweet passage from childhood to puberty in this tender coming-of-age tale, four childhood girlfriends — Teeny, Chrissy, Samantha and Roberta — recall the magical summer of 1970. During their walk down memory lane, they reconcile experiences with boys, secrets, bullies and more.\n\nStarring: Andy Nyman, Paul Whitehouse, Alex Lawther, Martin Freeman\n\nExperience three spine-tingling tales of terror to haunt your dreams. A debunker of all things paranormal, Professor Phillip Goodman (Andy Nyman) has devoted his life to exposing phony psychics and fraudulent supernatural shenanigans on his own television show. His skepticism is put to the test, however, when he receives a file of three chilling, inexplicable cases: a night watchman (Paul Whitehouse) haunted by disturbing visions as he patrols an abandoned asylum; an edgy young man (Black Mirror’s Alex Lawther) involved in a hellish car accident deep in the woods; and a wealthy former banker (Sherlock’s Martin Freeman) visited by the poltergeist spirit of his unborn child. Even scarier: each of the these macabre stories seems to have a sinister connection to Professor Goodman’s own life. Will they make a believer of him yet?\n\nStarring: Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, Eddie Albert, Hartley Power\n\nOverwhelmed by her suffocating schedule, touring European princess Ann takes off for a night while in Rome. When a sedative she took from her doctor kicks in, however, she falls asleep on a park bench and is found by an American reporter, Joe Bradley, who takes her back to his apartment for safety. At work the next morning, Joe finds out Ann’s regal identity and bets his editor he can get exclusive interview with her, but romance soon gets in the way.\n\nStarring: Regina Hall, Tiffany Haddish, Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah, Larenz Tate, Mike Colter, Kate Walsh\n\nBest friends Ryan, Sasha, Lisa and Dina are in for the adventure of a lifetime when they travel to New Orleans for the annual Essence Festival. Along the way, they rekindle their sisterhood and rediscover their wild side by doing enough dancing, drinking, brawling and romancing to make the Big Easy blush."
