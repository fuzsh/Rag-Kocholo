        "text": "Instead of waiting, I decided to post this while my thoughts were still fresh. I have a lot to say about this movie. No, movie, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not talking extensively about you because I liked you.\n\nI wouldn't have been as upset with this movie if it had been an episode recap, with some more insight into the characters. I wouldn't have even minded a movie with a different plot and characters. Trying to do both in two hours is utterly ridiculous and it makes for a nonsensical slop of goo. Unfortunately, the way the movie cuts up RahXephon the series leaves no linear, discernible plot, no character development, and it doesn't even flesh out the character it wanted to. Haruka's perspective should have been much more interesting than this.\n\nBest friends forever.\n\nI'm not opposed to making a love story out of RahXephon. The original series hinged on a memory of a relationship. However, both Haruka and Ayato were developed during the series. It didn't seem silly, it didn't seem forced and their interactions didn't end in . . . I'm never going to get over that. Purge. Purge the horrible sex scene from memory, Nikki, like you did with that Trilby game.\n\nThe movie takes Haruka's perspective throughout the events, but said events have been altered to accommodate a rather pathetic plot, compared to the original series. Taking Haruka's perspective wouldn't have been a bad decision, if only there had been more original artwork. I mean, what about her relationship with Sayoko? I wouldn't have minded watching that. Or her college days, or her relationship with Itsuki. That would have been interesting. Anything other than pining for a boy she loved when she was fourteen. Or seventeen. Whatever. Haruka's had more than one goal throughout the series and that fleshed out her character. She interacted with other characters. In order to make that though, I think the whole film would have had to have been original, without the episode recaps.\n\n. . . No, not at all, honey, why would you ask that?\n\nHowever, as an episode recap, the movie fails as well. After just having watched the series, most of my notes consisted of, \"No, they didn't do that, they did this.\" And it angered me slightly. There's the addition of a scene where Haruka knocks out Ayato with drugs and takes him away with her. In the original show, he went along with her, which showed that he was interested in understanding his world. Why would they change that? Other than to have a little romantic moment? I don't get it. I found myself constantly comparing the movie to the series, which lead to many complaints on my part. The fact is, the series is a complex piece of work and the movie is an extremely simple one.\n\nThe movie can't even tell a linear story. I try and think back about what it was, but I just want to remember the series instead. It follows Ayato and Haruka, who met at fourteen, but then the Mu came and invaded. Haruka was separated from her boyfriend due to alien technology and then she grew up and joined the anti-Mulian faction, and retrieved Ayato from his mother. And suddenly, he's piloting the RahXephon, with no problems. There's no conflict, there's no real story being told. If they wanted to play on Ayato's temper, then show the actual scenes where he doesn't want to pilot the RahXephon. Don't show scenes surrounding it and expect only fans of the series to fill in the void that was left. I guess the conflict is, \"Will they ever get together again?\" But the series already answered that.\n\nMy biggest issues with the movie are the facts they changed to accommodate their new plot, including what they did to a few of the side characters. Instead of being driven by Reika's death to break out Tokyo Jupiter, Ayato dreams of possibly seeing her again. I don't really understand why he would worry about Haruka, when he never saw her die. I'd understand his difficulty in believing she was alive if he had good reason to think she was dead, but we're never given that or even commentary from Ayato on what the split did to him. He has plenty good reason to believe Reika's dead in the series because she . . . died in front of him. And he reacted to it. Simple as that.\n\nIf the film was pandering to fans, it failed at that as well. I would consider myself a fan and every other line, I thought, \"She didn't say that, she said this. See, I even have it in my notes.\" The worst offender had to be Asahina, in which the footage from episode 19 is used to drive home this idea that when your blood turns blue, you forget your human memories (but Ayato's blood turned blue halfway through the film and he still remembered Haruka . . . oh, right. Plot convenience). Her anxiety comes from losing her memories, rather than the far more complex subject of understanding she has this Mulian side and whether or not she can accept it. For that matter, her attraction to Ayato is placed at the beginning of the film and it never plays out. The movie simplifies plot elements in order to make them fit into a two hour time slot. Red blood, good. Blue blood, bad. Human, good. Mulian, bad. Ayato, good. Quon, bad. I much preferred the gray areas of the series, where there really was no \"good\" or \"bad.\" It never tells you at the end whether Ayato's blood is blue or red. Ambiguity is your friend, movie!\n\nCutting out the complexity of the series leads me to another point of anger. There was no real antagonist in the series, which I thought was beautiful. Here's a series that doesn't just hand out roles, everyone's complex, everyone has their reasons for doing what they have, and they're all interesting because of that. I loved it that Ayato's parentage was never clearly defined. Movie tells you immediately, yes, Ayato's mother was Maya and she had him because she wanted to. The film immediately makes Maya more of a sympathetic character, because she was a mother and she was sacrificing her destiny to have her child. Maya from the series was cold and distant, and even when she told Ayato she loved him, there was that moment of silence that made you question everything she said. And it wasn't just Maya who received this treatment. In order to fill in typical movie roles, Bahbem was given the title of \"villain,\" another character I never saw as an outright antagonist. Don't get me wrong, he did bad things, but the series never treated him like an outright horrible human being. And the horrible things he did do in the series were little ticks. He was more of an observer. He wanted to see his plan played out. In the movie, he's groping Quon while she's asleep, he has a whole, \"This cannot be!\" moment, and it's just cliche.\n\nBut what about the other side characters? Elvy and Makoto pop up out of nowhere, with no introduction whatsoever. It's another, \"Remember these people? You liked them in the series, right?\" Sou has a few lines, but even his development with Kunugi is cut. Kim is completely cut out of the film, so you don't even get his reason for wanting to protect their world. But we haven't even discussed Quon and Itsuki yet, have we? I think that was my breaking point, along with the sex scene. Why don't we cut out the complex relationship between these two characters and simplify it so that it can mirror Haruka and Ayato's relationship! That will . . . not work. Because Itsuki and Quon are never explored as characters in the film, they're just the foil. They're not even the foil to the relationship; you don't see enough of them. Quon is referred to as the \"wrong\" instrumentalist, which I take issue with. What happened to your duality, RahXephon, your inspirations from music? What happened to having the two voices that represented a male and female voice on a piano? No? We're going for good vs. evil now? Meh.\n\nYou ask if she has a boyfriend AFTER sex?\n\nBut what about the relationship that this plot revolves around? Is it as developed as Haruka and Ayato's relationship in the series, which built-up slowly and wasn't a pairing of two cardboard stand-ups? Oh, you know the answer to that. No. They're cardboard stand-ups. I have no issue with sex in a fictional work. It doesn't even bother me that he's 17 and she's 30. What bothers me is that if this is pandering to the fans, then I remember that dream world he entered where his lust for Haruka was realized and he was afraid of it. He was afraid of Asahina touching him in front of her boyfriend. These fears come from a natural place and they make sense for his age. Those scenes aren't included in the movie, so I'm guessing they wanted the viewers to forget about it. But how can you ask an audience to forget an integral part of Ayato's psyche, yet expect the audience to remember all those episodes where Ayato and Haruka were developed? It makes very little sense.\n\nThat's not to say that the film is entirely horrible. Okay, I'm going by one line only, but it was an interesting line and by that time, I was willing to take anything. In Haruka's dream, she tells herself that her dream has come true. Her dream has been realized due to Ayato's presence, who plagued her dreams before, suggesting that he is utilized to see her dream through. I am intrigued by this because most dream women are, well, women. I think it goes back to the idea of the great goddess, a being of destruction and creation, so the idea of a man being a dream figure is out of the question. Or, if there is a dream man, it's usually reclaiming a childhood. Which could be the case for Haruka. Realizing her dream means living out the relationship she had in her younger years. But it's more than that. It's not only about reclaiming her childhood. This goes back to one of the central themes of RahXephon, the duality of male and female counterparts, at least. Just as Haruka is a dream figure for Ayato, so is Ayato for Haruka. And that was interesting. I wish the movie had done more of that. Instead, it falls back into drivel.\n\nBy the end of the film, I realized I had no idea what these characters were fighting for. In the series, it was about realizing a dream. Ayato and Quon are simply tools to achieve that dream. The film makes Ayato a . . . god figure? Something about how he can start time again if Haruka claps her hands and believes? If there was supposed to be a completely different plot, it lacks any cohesion due to the scenes from the actual series. Not only that, the movie is missing any depth, which the series had in spades. I stand by my final note as the credits rolled by: \"That was horrible.\"\n\nIf I wanted to remember how much I liked the series, I would watch it again. And I would have much preferred watching the series a third time instead of watching this movie. I guess that's the power of a really good show. And I can't add a little note here where I bitch about Twin Peaks because I haven't seen Fire Walk With Me yet. Until next Thursday, which will start The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a Second Time. The BBC version, of course.\n\nOh, Makoto, you crazy nut. At least you never change."
