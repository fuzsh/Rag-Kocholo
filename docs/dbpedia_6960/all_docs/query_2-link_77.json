Audio description is available for this screening upon request.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2013, tubas were stolen from high schools across Southern California. While reporters focused on the thieves, Director Alison O'Daniel, who is hard of hearing, was curious about the impact on the students and school communities. She wondered how these thefts were altering the sound of the bands, which ultimately led her to question the role of sound itself and what it means to listen. In The Tuba Thieves, O'Daniel explores the question of sound, prioritizing a hard-of-hearing form of storytelling in which information collides and is allowed to be misunderstood. In prioritizing Deaf and hard of hearing communication, she generates new sensitivity to sound and meaning.\n\nThe Tuba Thieves follows the stories of Nyke Prince, a Deaf woman who is given a drum kit; Geovanny Maroquin, a high school saxophone player impacted by the tuba thefts; and Sam Quinones, an L.A. Times reporter seeking answers. Various Los Angeles musicians are also highlighted, performing in Deaf spaces and presenting concerts frequently (mis)interpreted as silent.\n\nMary travels from Honduras to the US border looking for her son, a migrant kidnapped in Mexico. During her journey, she meets other mothers that are looking for their sons and she understands the magnitude of the disappearance crisis in the region. Francisco, the dean of the Pesh community, is confronted to the extinction of the tropical forest, the migration of his sons and the vanishing of his own language. He begins a journey to the heart of the jungle in order to find a cure to such changes. “Toshkua,” a word that means “to disappear” in the Pesh language of Honduras, tells the story of those who struggle against disappearance, from Central America to the US.\n\nMary viaja desde Honduras hasta Estados Unidos en busca de su hijo, un migrante secuestrado en México. Durante su travesía, se une a otras madres que buscan a sus hijos a lo largo del país y entiende la magnitud de la crisis de desapariciones en la zona. Francisco, el decano de la etnia pesh, se enfrenta a la destrucción de la selva de la Mosquitia, a la emigración de sus hijos y a la desaparición de su propio idioma. Él emprende un viaje hacia el corazón de la selva para entender las razones de estos cambios. “Toshkua,” una palabra que significa “desaparecer” en el idioma pesh de Honduras, cuenta la historia de las y los que luchan contra la desaparición, desde América Central hasta Estados Unidos.\n\nLudovic Bonleux\n\nLudovic Bonleux has directed five documentaries about violence and politics in Mexico.
