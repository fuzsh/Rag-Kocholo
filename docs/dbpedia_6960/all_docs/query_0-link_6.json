I'll think of something.\n\nMany divisive films exist in cinema, but they follow a trend: there is always a unique proportion, significantly greater than or equal to 5% among my cinephile acquaintances, that loves the film and defends it. John Waters, Jean-Luc Godard, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Dusan Makavejev are excellent examples of this.

Filmed together in mid-1960s Sweden, the two docu-hybrid features make commentary on societal norms and values, but differ in which they assail. The first work contains much on class conflict and political movements -- within a story of two lovers coming from very different belief systems -- while the second focuses its content on more frank discussions of sex, religion, and femininity.\n\nBranded as \"the same movie,\" after seeing (Yellow) you'll recognize the set-up here with similar patterns in the first act.…"
