        "text": "I am Curious (Yellow) is a blend of fiction and documentary where all of the performers play [small variations on] themselves, as themselves. It tells the story of Lena, a searching and rebellious young woman, and her personal quest to understand the social and political conditions in 1960s Sweden, as well as her bold exploration of her own sexual identity.\n\nA year later Sjöman released a companion film, I Am Curious (Blue), edited from unused footage and reshoots, telling Lena's same story of pouting self-discovery with different material.\n\nYellow and blue are the two colors of the Swedish flag.\n\nReferences:\n\nI Am Curious (Yellow) (Matt Langdon)\n\nI Am Curious\n\nI Am Curious (Yellow) (Rumsey Taylor)"
