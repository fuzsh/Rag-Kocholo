        "text": "From today's perspective, it seems all much ado about nothing, but the brouhaha caused by the 1967 Swedish film, I Am Curious Yellow, directed by Vilgot Sjoman, who has died aged 81, helped it remain the most financially successful foreign film in the US for 23 years. It also paved the way for movies like Last Tango in Paris (1972).\n\nAfter being shown in a cut version in Britain, the film was seized by the US customs, pronounced obscene and banned because of its nudity and sexual explicitness. A federal appeals court then ruled that it was protected under the first amendment, which allowed it to be released in March 1969 - though only in New York and New Jersey.\n\nUnconvincing as it sounds, the main interest of I Am Curious Yellow was its blend of newsreels, cinéma verité techniques and loose narrative structure, much influenced by Jean-Luc Godard. In it, a sociologist (Lena Nyman) conducts interviews with workers, women and young people about Vietnam, Martin Luther King and the Swedish class structure. \"Do we have a class system in Sweden?\" she asks. \"It depends on the people,\" comes the reply. \"Undress them, and they're all the same; dress them, and you have a class system.\" Therein lies the key to the film; Nyman and her screen boyfriend begin to copulate - in the bedroom, outside the royal palace, in a tree, on the grass and in a pond.\n\nSjoman's interest in most of his films was to expose sexual and social taboos: a girl is raped by a dog (off-screen) in 491 (1964), a study of juvenile delinquents, and incest was the main theme in My Sister My Love (1966), based on the Jacobean classic, Tis Pity She's a Whore. The latter starred Bibi Andersson, who was to appear in 13 of the films of Ingmar Bergman, Sjoman's friend and mentor.\n\nSjoman was born in Stockholm, the son of a construction worker, and took various jobs while writing unperformed plays. He turned one of them into a novel, which he eventually adapted as a screenplay for Gustaf Molander's Trots (Defiance, 1952), about the difficulties of an adolescent couple - it was similar to Bergman's Summer with Monika of the same year, and both featured Harriet Andersson. Sjoman's first film as a director, The Mistress (1962), also owed much to Bergman in the account of a girl (Bibi Andersson) torn between her love for an older and a younger man.\n\nA few years later, I Am Curious Yellow, made for $160,000, brought Sjoman international fame. He followed it with I Am Curious Blue (1968) - yellow and blue are the colours of the Swedish flag - which used material left over from the earlier film. Blushing Charlie (1970), a typical mixture of sex and politics, was the first feature shot in Super 16 - invented by Sjoman's director of photography, Rune Ericson - but his subsequent films were less successful.\n\nThey included Till Sex Us Do Part (1971), about a frustrated married couple who believe that if they make love to each other, they will die, and I Am Blushing (1982), Sjoman's answer to Apocalypse Now, about a film director named Gunnar Sjoman making a movie in the Philippines, based on Joseph Conrad's Victory and starring Larry Hagman. Meanwhile, the director's mistress (Bibi Andersson) gets involved in a movement to free political prisoners.\n\nSjoman's last film was Alfred (1995), about the Swedish engineer who founded the Nobel prize. He is survived by his wife and three children."
