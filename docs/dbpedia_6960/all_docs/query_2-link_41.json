        "text": "I Am Curious (Yellow) by Vilgot Sjöman\n\nFIRST EDITION / THIRD PRINTING [1968] GROVE PRESS\n\nVintage paperback in very good condition.\n\nSome shelf / rub wear to cover; tanning. Inside, printed on acid-free paper, pages are still bright, white and read good as new. Binding is tight; minor crack inside front cover between spine and first page [see last photo]\n\nOne of the most significant films of the 1960s is I Am Curious Yellow, which was made by the Swedish director, Vilgot Sjoman, whose earlier films include My Sister, My Love and 491 . This volume presents the full text of the scenario, together with 266 stills from the picture. Also included is an appendix of pertinent testimony about the film by key witnesses in the U.S. District Court case.\n\nTold in a quasi-documentary style, this companion piece to Jag är nyfiken - en film i blått (1968) deals with topics such as class society, non-violent resistance, sex, relationships, and tourism to Francoist Spain."
