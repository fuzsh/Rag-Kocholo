Collection of six vintage studio still photographs from the US release of the 1967 Swedish film.\n\nVilgot Sjoman's controversial erotic drama, utilizing both dramatic and documentary filmmaking techniques, stars Sjoman's then lover, actress Lena Nyman, as a young theater student examining the social and political mores of 1960s Sweden, and her own sexuality. Parallel is the plot of the actors and filmmakers reacting as themselves to the film they are in the process of making.\n\nSeized by customs upon entry to the US and banned from numerous US cities for sexually explicit scenes, it was found, in 1969, not to be obscene by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, opening the door to more frank and explicit subject matter in American film.\n\nThe companion to Sjoman's 1968 film \"I Am Curious (Blue),\" which was initially intended to be combined with \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\" as one three and a half hour film.\n\n8 x 10 inches. Near Fine, most with very slight even fading.\n\nCriterion Collection 180. Vogel, Film as a Subversive Art.\n\n[Book #148773]"
