        "text": "60/100\n\n[I jointly reviewed Yellow and Blue.]\n\nSometimes I get overly excited when a film isn't even remotely what I expected it to be. (Jury's still out on whether that's the case with Pig.) Knowing of I Am Curious—Yellow only via its reputation as a quasi-pornographic succès de scandale, I was gobsmacked to discover, back in 2008, that it's much less Rochelle, Rochelle (\"A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk\") than La Chinoise, which was released the same year. There's a fair amount of nudity, to be sure, but it's not particularly erotic in nature—more of a hippie ethos, clothes as tyranny. Even the ostensibly explicit stuff is quite tame, unless you're the type to get worked up by light, playful kisses on a flaccid penis. Instead, we mostly get Lena Nyman (as \"herself\") attending various protests and interviewing random Swedish citizens about the nation's class system, interspersed with meta-fictional debates featuring Sjöman (with whom Nyman, or at least \"Nyman,\" is romantically involved; I'm unsure whether that was the case in real life; doesn't matter) and the crew, as well as random postmodern tomfoolery that extends to in-film marketing of the diptych's other half. (\"Buy our film, the only film in two versions: one yellow, one blue!\" \"Buy the yellow, buy the blue, buy our film 'cause it is two!\") Curiosity really is the watchword here, from sincere political interrogations to a bit in which someone randomly holding up a knapsack kicks off a contest for viewers to guess its contents (with the prizes reiterated each time the knapsack subsequently reappears)."
