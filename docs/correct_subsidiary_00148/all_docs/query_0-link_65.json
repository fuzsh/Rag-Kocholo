        "text": "Oracle announced the general availability of Exadata Exascale, an intelligent data architecture for the cloud, delivering high performance for AI, analytics, and mission-critical workloads. The new service integrates Exadata’s database architecture with cloud elasticity, aiming to reduce infrastructure costs by up to 95% for organisations of any size.\n\nExadata Exascale is now accessible with the Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure and Oracle Database 23ai on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Future availability is planned for Exadata Cloud@Customer, OCI Dedicated Region, and multi cloud environments.\n\n“Exadata Exascale is the future architecture for all Oracle Database cloud services,” said Kothanda Umamageswaran, SVP, Exadata and Scale-Out Technologies, Oracle. “By cutting infrastructure costs significantly, it enables small workloads and businesses to leverage Oracle Exadata’s benefits in the cloud.”\n\nThe service offers a virtualised database-optimized infrastructure with shared compute and storage pools, enabling hyper-elastic scaling and pay-per-use economics. Organisations can use the Exadata platform for all data workloads, starting at hundreds of dollars per month.\n\nLuis Mediero, director of Cloud and Data Solutions at Quistor, highlighted Exascale’s scalability and efficiency. “Its ability to scale efficiently will allow us to move all workloads to high-performance environments with minimal migration time,” Mediero said. “Exascale’s scalability will enable us to grow resources quickly and with minimal costs.”\n\nExadata Exascale features elastic, pay-per-use resources without extra IOPS charges, an intelligent storage cloud with RDMA capability, AI Smart Scan for faster AI vector searches, low-latency OLTP IO, and intelligent analytics with data-intensive SQL query offloading. It also includes database-aware intelligent clones for easy creation of development, test, or recovery copies.\n\nCarl Olofson, research VP at IDC, noted the significance of Exadata Exascale in the context of AI and cloud. “Oracle’s Exadata Exascale combines Exadata and cloud benefits with pay-per-use, a near-infinite resource pool, and hyper-elasticity affordable for any size organisation. Oracle has put forth the challenge. Who will respond?”"
