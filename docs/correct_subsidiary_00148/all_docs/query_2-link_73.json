Consumer GPS receivers have come down to a price that makes them accessible to most average consumers. In addition, technology improvements are creating smaller and smaller receivers that can be incorporated into a wide range of devices, such as watches and automobiles.\n\nGPS receivers can even allow a user to mark points along a path, or waypoints, and can guide users back and forth along this path.\n\nSome systems even integrate locally stored maps, providing a user with a graphical reference to their current location.\n\nthe present invention can provide a spatial, or location, context for communications networks, such as the Internet, cable television systems, or telephone systems, by associating unique identifiers with spatial locations.\n\nthe present invention may further utilize such a spatial context to enhance current classification, search, automation, and directory organization systems.\n\nthe present invention may assign unique identifiers to a device, or the present invention may use Internet Protocol (\"IP\") addresses, media access control (âMACâ) addresses, telephone numbers, or street addresses as such a unique identifier.\n\nIP Internet Protocol\n\nMAC media access control\n\nSpatial locations returned by the present invention can include, but are not limited to, a set of coordinates. Such coordinates may be based on terrestrial systems, such as radio beacon navigation systems; satellite-based systems, such as GPS; celestial-based systems, such as The World Geodetic System's WGS84 standard or North American datums such as NAD27; or other such spatial location systems.\n\nthe spatial context provided by the present invention can express geographic areas by creating a set of one or more waypoints, or by combining a waypoint with a distance.\n\nthe present invention may allow association of events with certain geographic areas such that, when a receiver or other device is determined to be within a geographic region, audio, video, or other sensory-stimulating content can be presented.\n\nPresented content can include, but is not limited to, advertisements, public service information, user-created content, and user-requested content.\n\nthe present invention may determine that a device is within a geographic region through a variety of means, including integration with GPS or other spatial determining systems and by having a user manually enter such information.\n\nthe present invention can integrate such information with locally stored maps, and the present invention may also integrate with modern, network-accessible mapping technologies such as those provided by Etak, MapQuest, and Mapblast. Such integration can allow the present invention to display maps and other information that is constantly up to date.\n\nthe present invention may include a business directory.\n\na directory maintained by the prior art may be constantly updated.\n\nthe present invention can assign a unique identifier to point of sale terminals or other equipment owned by a business or other entity, and each time such equipment processes a sale or performs some other pre-defined event, the location of such equipment may be reported to a directory.\n\nthe present invention can maintain an accurate list of business locations.\n\nSuch dynamic directory information coupled with location identification equipment, can allow the present invention to easily guide a user to a given business, government office, or other desired location. This can be seen as an improvement over the prior art as many people place a value on finding nearby services; having a spatially oriented, network integrated automation capability for things such as reminders; and for control of other systems.\n\nFigure 1 is a block diagram illustrating primary components of the present invention.\n\nFigure 2 is a block diagram of the general logic of a user client device.\n\nFigure 3 is logic diagram providing additional details of the location engine, illustrated as item C in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates a sample Geobookmark Table.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates a sample Client Position Table.\n\nFigure 6 illustrates a sample Location Context Media Table.\n\nFigure 7 illustrates a sample Event Queue Table.\n\nFigure 8 illustrates a sample service_table.\n\nFigure 9 illustrates a sample service_class_table.\n\nFigure 10. is a process flow diagram for a location-enabled service search.\n\nFigure 11 is a process flow diagram for a location-enabled reminder.\n\nFigure 12 is a process flow diagram for location-enabled automation.\n\nFigure 13 is a timeline diagram of a DHCP client/server message exchange.\n\nFigure 14 illustrates a sample IP Packet Header.\n\nFigure 15 illustrates a sample spatial transmission protocol exchange.\n\nBlock 100 represents a typical, network-capable, extensible, electronic device or architecture.\n\nSystem 100 may comprise sub-components incorporated as built-in elements or accessible through common data channels, buses or network links.

Stored geobookmarks can provide a desired location context for a spatially relevant information service.\n\nthe present invention provides for the use of spatial information across applications, from Web searching to asset management, thereby improving over the prior art.\n\nusers cannot currently utilize spatial information across a plurality of web sites.\n\na user even if a user enters a home address or zip code at a bank's website to find local ATM machines, a user must still reenter their address at a website to find a dealer for some product, such as bicycles.\n\nusers may even be required to reenter such information on the same vendor's page each time they return, even if the location context of their search is the same. Yet, the same information can often be used for many uses, which is an object of the present invention.\n\nthe present mvention provides for the seamless, platform-independent sharing of geobookmarks across devices, services, and applications.\n\nthe present invention further provides sharing of geobookmarks among technologies and implementations (stationary, mobile, semi-permanent), including optional, events or content associated with such geobookmarks, such as audio, video, or maps.\n\nFigure 2 is a logical diagram illustrating a preferred client implementation of a System 100 device. Such a client machine can incorporate location contexts with other items such as events and directory queries. Figure 2 is provided for enabelment and best- mode purposes, and is not intended to limit the invention to this process.\n\nFigure 3 is an expanded view of a portion of item Figure 2, specifically item C, Location Determination Process, and illustrates logic which may be used in a preferred embodiment for various means of location determination. These location determination means may include, but are not limited to, automatic determination, such as through GPS or LORAN systems; such as through geocoding or other such systems, and manual processes. Figure 3 further illustrates steps for selecting a location context for a given task or use.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates a data table, Geobookmark Table, which can provide an organization mechanism for recording location contexts in memory or on media.\n\nOne aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention can allow extensive geobookmark interaction, configuration, storage, sharing, and transmission. This table illustrates a basic data table design supporting these capabilities.\n\nFigure 5 illustrates a sample Client Position Table (CPTable).\n\nTables such as CPTable can associate client system network addresses with location contexts including, but not limited to, current or previous client locations, and to store such contexts.\n\nCPTable illustrates a table for storing such items as part of a preferred embodiment for recording client positions and network addresses.\n\ncommon CPTable fields can store information such as IP Address; Location Context Parameters, such as Latitude and Longitude or others; the time at which information was received, modified, or created; hostnames and DNS domain names; other unique record identifiers; and other related data fields.\n\nThis table illustrates a preferred embodiment of a client position and network address recording means, and is not intended to limit the present invention.\n\nCPTable may be stored in a database systems such as DB 204.\n\nFigure 6 is an illustration of a Location Context Media Table (LCMTable). It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for delivering location relevant media to clients. This may be achieved by storing content or pointers to such content, along with spatial or geographic areas of relevance, in a table. Such a table can then be compared to current client positions and other positions, such locations in which a user of a client device may be interested. By performing such comparisons, content of interest may be identified, and such content may be presented to a user when a user is located within the location constraints defined as an area of relevance with respect to such content.\n\nLCMTable Location Context Media Table\n\nLCMTable is an example of such a table, and illustrates a preferred storage means. LCMTable is not meant to constitute the only possible design, but rather illustrates key elements of such a table as part of a preferred embodiment. For instance, if location sensitive media is to be transmitted, it may be desirable to have a more sophisticated design that includes other fields, or further normalizing the table in a manner that may add additional features. Such features may include the ability to associate content with multiple location contexts. LCMTable may be stored in a database system like DB 204, or DB 212.\n\nFigure 7 illustrates a sample Event Queue table. It is an object of the present invention to provide location context triggered automation through the association of location contexts with a range of items such as audiovisual content, and other processes.\n\nFigure 7 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a data table designed for such associations.\n\nAlternatively contemplated embodiments may include additional fields, depending on specific implementations. Such fields may include, time constraints for content presentation or event durations, or those required for further normalization of an Event Queue table, such as associations between multiple events and a single location context, or multiple location contexts with one event.\n\nAn event queue table may be stored in a database system such as DB 204.\n\nFigure 8 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a service table.\n\nService_table can contain a list of categorized or classified services and their geographic location and/or availability.\n\nService_table may store information about SERVICE IDENTIFIERS, SERVICE LOCATION IDENTIFIERS, SERNICETYPE or SERNICECLASS or category SUBCLASSES, which are typically more specific sub-categories, SERVICE AVAILABILITY TIMES, and SERVICE PROVIDERS.\n\nthe SERVICEID field may uniquely identify each row or service, by type of service, location and provider or OID (object id) number.\n\nthe OID may be an ITU-T recommendation X.208 (AS â .l) style OID. This is the method for IA â A (www.iana.org) private enterprise numbers.\n\nType of service may be defined by CLASS and SUBCLASS fields, which may be numeric ids relating to another table for normalization purposes, identified as service_class_table, containing service classes or categories, and a CLASSID field which may be used as a key field.\n\nSuch classifications may be used in conjunction with, may be mapped to, or actually be industry standard classifications such as SIC or NAICS codes.\n\nService_table may be stored in database systems such as DB 204, DB208, or in an LDAP server such as DB 210.\n\nFigure 9 illustrates a sample data table, service_class, which illustrates a preferred embodiment of a table supporting item classifications, as described in the previous description for Figure 8. This table may also be stored in a database system such as that provided by DB 204, DB 208, or DB 210.\n\nFigures 10 through 12 are flow charts illustrating preferred embodiments of several anticipated applications of the present invention. These applications include location relevant search, reminder automation, and remote control automation, respectively.\n\nFigure 13 is a timeline diagram of a DHCP client/server message exchange.\n\nFigure 13 illustrates specific client server request and response messages and shows where in this process a client would receive an offer (DHCPOFFER) containing configuration information from the DHCP server.\n\nDHCPOFFER DHCPOFFER\n\nthe present invention supports a plurality of applications across multiple disciplines and uses. However, it is helpful in describing aspects of the present invention to distinguish two general types of use. The first of these types of use is one in which a user typically interacts with a client device providing a System 100 capabilities. The other, more autonomous of these use types predominantly involves interactions between systems or devices, wherein at least one system has implemented components of System 100.\n\na system centric method may not typically utilize a permanent local interface.\n\nSuch a system centric method can be illustrated by envisioning the present invention implemented with servers and routers, which typically have a shared local console (usually textual rather than graphical), which is used only intermittently.\n\na primary means for configuring and adjusting system centric devices is commonly provided via a network interface, which is often a text based CLI, such as with Cisco routers.\n\na system centric implementation can be contrasted with a user-oriented system, in which a local user interface may be a primary interface for controlling a device, and may be very frequently.\n\na user centric embodiment of the present invention provides for robust user interaction and configuration control via a user interface.\n\na user-centric model it is common for a user to determine, mark, store, share, and exchange multiple spatially relevant geobookmarks, and to utilize them across a plurality of functions and uses. It may also be common for a user to use multimedia functionality, such as Multimedia Device 106 of in Figure 1, to record and play content associated with location contexts.\n\nmultimedia functionality such as Multimedia Device 106 of in Figure 1\n\na user interface may also be used as a typical content delivery mechanism, such as a Web browser or mail client, or for the reception of digital audio and video streams as with a traditional radio and television or set-top box.\n\na system centric model is typically concerned with the location of a given system, and thus location context marking is typically less relevant.\n\na system centric model may provide additional management and configuration tools, which may be conducted over a network via protocols such as via Trivial File Transport Protocol (TFTP) and/or SNMP.\n\nTFTP Trivial File Transport Protocol\n\nSNMP Network-to-Network Protocol\n\nthe system may store the current client location, and the system may store other location context information.\n\nlocation context information may not be the location of the system or even a location where the system or its user has visited, but may be other contexts, such as a location that was used for a location context directory search, or other items.\n\nother information may be determined, transmitted, or stored, such as but not limited to a system's host and domain name. Such information may typically be stored in a data table similar to CPTable, illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nthe present invention supports several spatial information transmission methods, which can be divided into two broad categories, traditional protocol methods and packet header methods.\n\na spatial transmission method based around traditional protocol methods may transmit information as part of a message in text or binary form. Examples of this method include incorporation as part of an URL; as a field of a message header or body; as a document cookie; as an e-mail header or body; and via direct transmission as a message of a custom protocol designed for this purpose.\n\nAn example of a custom protocol exchange is illustrated by Figure 15.\n\na client may be configured to continuously send position information to a server as quickly as location determination occurs. Testing has shown that handheld receivers, such as those manufactured by the Garmin corporation, will provide position data streams approximately once per second, hi an alternative embodiment, a client may be configured to send position information at an interval. For example, a client instructed to send position information at a rate slower than its ability to resolve or send location information. Such rates may vary depending on client implementation type, and may range from once per second to once a week or longer.\n\na client may also base server updates on locally stored position information, such that server updates only occur when a client detects location change.\n\na client may be polled for position information. That is, a server may drive information exchanges by contacting a client and asking for location information.\n\na server may also function as an intermediary between client devices and other systems, using a method commonly called publish and subscribe.\n\na client machine can publish position or other information to a server, and other systems connect to a server and subscribe to such published information.\n\nan alternative embodiment of the present invention provides for inclusion of spatial information in network packet headers, such as, but not limited to, Internet Protocol Packet Headers and Transmission Control Protocol Headers.\n\nSuch packets are part of widely used protocols, with a well defined structure that includes items such as a source IP address, a destination IP address, and other information, including Port number, Type of Service, Time to Live, Window Options, and Checksums.\n\nsuch protocols provide an \"Options\" section, which allows a packet to contain additional information.\n\nthe structure of a typical IP packet header is illustrated in Figure 14.\n\nInco â orating spatial information into packets at a source device, or in intermediate devices in a transmission can provide another means for conveying spatial information.\n\nPacket-based spatial information can also provides a means for precise geographical mapping of network equipment, such as servers, routers, bridges, and gateways. Packet-based spatial information can also allow the determination of geographic transmission paths, and geographical network. Such maps are not possible using current technology.\n\nmapping efforts do not provide a true geographic representation of transmission facility locations or data paths, but rather base their information on the address or location of a network provider's home office or registered office, which may have little relationship to the path of Internet datagrams.\n\nAS Autonomous System\n\nCAIDA Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis\n\nthe present invention essentially provides a spatial context across multiple network access methods and devices, both with and without an attached GPS, for stationary, mobile, and semi-mobile scenarios.\n\none aspect of the present invention can associate spatial location identifiers with one or more network address, such as an IP address, by a plurality of methods used separately or in combination.\n\na client may connect to a server, such as DB 204, when network connectivity is achieved.\n\na client may then transmit a continuous stream of position updates to such a server.\n\na server can store these positions in a data table, such as CPTable, illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nClient IP addresses or other unique identifiers associated with a client may also be stored in DB 204, as may other data, such as the current time.\n\na server may assume that a client implementing a continuous transmission method in which a client spatial location changes is equipped with a GPS or other location determination equipment. Such an assumption is reasonable, as a client may not be capable of determining a change in location without such equipment. Thus, for example, location based triggering mechanisms and location based service search mechanisms or processes may search CPTable table to identify recent entries by the same client. If such recent entries are found, they may reasonably be concluded to be the position of the client. Such assumptions may assist the present invention in creating a more seamless user experience, as the present invention may periodically prompt a user for a current spatial location if a GPS or other location determination device can not be detected.\n\nthe preceding example should not be construed as limiting the present invention to this method, as there are other methods, such as a client/server message exchange, as well as added levels of sophistication that may be incorporated, such as secure signatures.\n\na client may connect to a server via a Web browser to initiate a search or other location relevant action.\n\nMessages from clients with location determination devices attached may only slightly differ from messages from clients without location determination devices.\n\nBoth types of message consist of a start-line, zero or more header fields, an empty line indicating the end of the header fields, and possibly a message-body.\n\nThis defined structure makes it easy for processes to separate the header from the body and parse these components separately.\n\nthe header fields are generally simple text with a line beginning with a field name, then a colon ' : ', followed by the field value.\n\nThis structure also makes it easy to parse to extract header fields and values by a variety of means, including Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs.\n\nCGI Common Gateway Interface\n\nclient messages When a client equipped with a Web browser connects to a Web server, client messages typically include a header. Such a header may include a number of fields, including the client IP address, and an optional header field called a Cookie, which may be used to store persistent but mutable information on the client. Such information may be stored in a data store within a current client Web page document, and such information may be communicated to servers or server processes. An aspect of a preferred embodiment of the present invention may use such a\n\nCookie to transmit location context information and to store it on the client and in a database, so that a user of the system will not have to repeatedly enter location information from use to use and from session to session.\n\nThis information may also be used as a default location context for systems without a location determination device or in which a location determination device is not functioning.\n\nthis cookie may be used by systems to which a location dete â nination device is attached, but for which a user prefers to use a fixed location context rather than a current location. Such cookies may also be re-used by other Web sites and other applications, and even across multiple devices.\n\nCookie header fields were originally designed to only be available to a site setting such a Cookie, however there are well known techniques in the field for making use of cross site Cookies, including redirection, a technique used by Microsoft, Inc., HTML â IMG> tag references, as used by DoubleChck, Inc. These techniques, coupled with the fact that such information is also recorded into a database along with a client IP address, allows for use of such information in any application with access to the database information.\n\na Web server may, upon receiving a Web page request, extract a client IP address from the REMOTE_ADDR header field.\n\nIP addresses determined from such header fields may be used as a basis for a search of a CPTable for recent entries that would indicate that a client is sending position updates. If such a search is successful, a server may thus realize the client has a location detection capability of its own and incorporate that location into activities at the site, such as location-based searches.\n\nthe server may then use a document cookie if it is present, or, upon receiving a location-based service request, such as a search for services, the present invention may prompt a user for geocoding or other manual means of location determination. If a user performs such manual location determination and decides to store the location context as the default, the server may then set a cookie to the recently entered location context.\n\na simple spatial Cookie may look like:\n\nthe cookie name is GEOS and it contains a latitude and longitude separated by a colon ':' character which has been specially encoded as part of the HTTP protocol.\n\nother information may be included as metadata, such as that describing formatting and other spatial information aspects.\n\na preferred embodiment may also include other information such as that identifying other aspects of the client or the user, or include other Cookies that may relate to a spatial Cookie, or GeoCookie.\n\nthe system may allow the inclusion of other information with the location context. Such information may include, but is not limited to, a name, descriptive text and range constraints, associated queries, content events, and automation.\n\nthe present invention may provide user interface elements, such as hardware or software form fields, buttons, and dials, which can be use to store these geobookmarks and related digital information in a permanent storage, such as a local DS 112 or a remote DB 204 or DB206.\n\nthe present invention can allow such items to be shared and transmitted as files or pointers to files via common communications means, such as E- mail, and shared access to common systems such as Web servers and FTP servers.\n\nthe present invention may facilitate re-use, transmission, and sharing of geobookmarks and related events by defining a common geobookmark structure using modern methods and encodings.\n\nSuch methods and encodings include, but are not limited to, MIME and XML documents and XML Document Type Definitions (\"DTD's\").\n\nan object of the present invention to provide the use of location triggered or driven events and automation, such as reminders, multimedia events, and remote control through such geobookmarks.\n\nthe present invention introduces the concept of an event queue (\"EQ7\"), as illustrated in Figure 7.\n\nEQ7 event queue\n\nSuch an event queue may be enhanced by an optional timing constraint mechanism, such as the \"cron\" function described later in this specification.\n\na user may utilize controls on UI 104 to associate location contexts with events such as multimedia recordings.\n\nUI 104 may have convenient, hardware or software control for marking the current location as a location context, along with default settings for a range of available options, and with an option to use this context or previously stored contexts as part of a location triggered event.\n\na user may mark the location, include a default range, and store a voice recording for the message \"pick up milk and eggs.â This combination of location context and audio may be saved into the event queue.\n\na process interacts with the queue by comparing a current client position with location contexts of items in a queue and activates items when a client reaches a proximity defined by location contexts, such as playing the reminder when the user returns by the grocery store.\n\na client will be within the location context of the events, at the instant they are created, and possibly for some time thereafter, until the client leaves the proximity. Since this is a common scenario, and it is undesirable to in this example immediately hear a reminder, the present invention provides for a UI 104 control and default behavior which may be set to first require the client to either leave the context before being activated or to wait for some time period to elapse prior to activating the event.\n\nAn additional aspect of the present invention may provide a flexible time constraint mechanism and specification ability to be included as an event constraint.\n\nThis time mechanism may be one similar to the UNIX cron facility, outlined later, yet abstracted or made easier to use.\n\nSuch a time mechanism may allow users to specify flexible timeframes, such as every minute or hour; or every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday; or at 4:00 on Mondays, or after 5:00 PM on weekdays; thereby providing rich time-entry capabilities.\n\na benefit may be derived by using various methods for comparing a queue, including by polling, callbacks, and interrupts, depending on the environment and use of the system. Those skilled in the arts of electronics and computer science should be readily aware of such methods.\n\nan aspect of the present invention also allows location- triggered events to interact with other systems over a network.\n\na user may choose to create a location context such as a range of five miles from their home, and to associate a time frame such as after 5:00 pm on weekdays, with an event to turn on the home air-conditioning and the walkway lights.\n\nthe present invention provides for the association of a location context and an optional timeframe, with a flexible set of events.\n\nthe present invention provides for the entry and association of contexts, events, and timeframes in a list such as represented by EQ7, in combination with a process that compares location contexts of list items with current client location information.\n\nclient location information may be stored in CPTable, or may have been received with aforementioned transmission methods.\n\nthe present invention may execute events, which may be represented in fields in EQ7 as process names, either locally or via a network when appropriate constraints are met.\n\ninteraction of the present invention and such events may be easily accomplished with those system and vendors providing standard or well defined and shared interfaces to their equipment, such as XI 0 home controllers.\n\nOther system integration may require custom programming or setup, or may not be possible if a vendor chooses to maintain an exclusive interface.\n\nnetwork resources may be listed in a Directory or database, but due their dynamic nature may be more apt to utilize service location mechanisms and protocols such as those described later, including a publish and subscribe methodology or lookup, and discover and join functions provided by technologies such as the Jini Technology Platform, which is discussed later.\n\nSuch a directory should be well organized, and may contain items such as services, products, and other items for which a location context can be incorporated.\n\nitems such as services, products, and other items for which a location context can be incorporated.\n\nan organization may be derived through the use of SIC codes, NAICS codes, and other industry classification codes, such as product codes and other useful classifications depending on the field.\n\nUI104 can provide some quick search capabilities for commonly searched for items by assigning commonly used items to user interface controls such as buttons, or creating custom lists and menus.\n\nuser interface controls such as buttons, or creating custom lists and menus.\n\none aspect of preferred embodiment includes a quick find capability for emergency services, such as local police stations, hospitals, and fire departments, as well as a means for locating and interacting with nearby mobile emergency units such as patrol cars.\n\nSuch quick search capabilities can allow a mutable set of commonly searched for items to be more easily conducted by associating items such as ATM machines with a given button or dial, or in a short list or menu, including the storage of multiple sets or quick button and list configurations that may be recalled and used. For example, a person may wish to use a different quick list when in a different locality.\n\na preferred embodiment along with review of and selection from a highly structured directory, allows custom search strings to be entered and searched for either separately or in conjunction with selections from directory categories. Such customization may be achieved using common user interface controls and methods, such as the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or Dynamic HTML elements like Javascript, and through use of local and remote storage elements such as DS112 and DB204 or DB206.\n\nCGI Common Gateway Interface\n\nDynamic HTML elements like Javascript\n\nthese interface controls and methods will be readily understood by those skilled in design of systems such as those employing modern Internet technologies.\n\nthese quick menu items and buttons may be found by browsing a list of well defined categories,, and then selected to be included in a set of common items, or quick list or menu.\n\na user may initiate a search for an item, such as services, via a user interface using the methods and hierarchy described for setting location context and methods to specify search criteria.\n\na process such as a process running on a System 100 device or remote server like DB 204, such as a Java program or CGI script initiated by or receiving the request, may then incorporate the location context and search criteria into a query for directory items.\n\na directory may include organized and categorized items, and a location context.\n\nSuch a location context may include a bounding polygon, such as a rectangle, thus being described by a bounding set of coordinates.\n\nSuch a bounding polygon may be stored in a data table, such as service_directory, as illustrated in Figure 8.\n\nSuch a table may be stored in a database system such as DB 204, or DB 208, or may be organized in other ways, such as a directory rather than a table. In such instances, said directory may be stored in LDAP server DB 210.\n\na search query such as a SQL or set-logic query\n\nSuch a query may find all Notary Public service providers, or ATM machines, or whatever item is described by the service class or category, within a desired geographic area.\n\nthe results of such a query may be returned to a client device as a list or map, with features for selecting either view or a combination of both views via controls on UI 104.\n\nthe present invention can also provide directory validation capabilities.\n\ncompanies such as Verizon and Vindigo publish electronic directories, such as the Yellow Pages. Many of these systems share directory information, such as addresses, pertaining to various businesses and services listed therein. Thus, electronic directories at different websites or other locations may share a common source, or may be based in whole or in part on Government information, such as U.S. Census information. Companies such as Vindigo offer the ability to search for services close to a user, along with other features, such as allowing users of the system to help validate or add value, through features such as reviews.\n\nthe present invention provides a method for adding automatic directory validation through inclusion of merchant processing such as electronic cash registers, credit card processing equipment, and other point of sale (POS) equipment in the directory validation process.\n\nthe present invention can generally determine that, if a merchant or POS transaction takes place at a given location, this is indicative that a merchant or service identified by a terminal ID is conducting business at the specified location at the time of a transaction, hi a preferred embodiment, such a terminal may have System 100 capabilities, such as a built-in or attached location receiver or GLD 108 capability.\n\nthe present invention provides for a process for merchant transactions to initiate an electronic process which checks the directory listing of a merchant including location with the information from merchant transactions thus automatically validating the directory on a continuous basis rather than the common method of intervallic updates based on sales of advertisements or directory space as is currently used.\n\nthis content may be sent at any point that the system determines the IP address of the client, a therefore not be dependent on a client initiate an action such as a search or other action.\n\nOne such method of address determination was described above using the CPTable and the continuous client send transmission method.\n\na location content such as in a database table such as a Location Context Media Table, illustrated in Figure 8, where media files are stored with along with a location context and other information such as the dimensions of the media like it's time duration or on screen dimensions and resolution.\n\na location context such as the dimensions of the media like it's time duration or on screen dimensions and resolution.\n\nthe location relevant content may be effectively distributed to clients over the network.\n\nan Internet audio stream such as an Internet radio\n\nany combination of advertisements that fill an advertising time slot, such as three minutes may be used.\n\na three minute time slot may be filled by two one and a half minute ads, or by one three minute ad or by a one minute ad and a two minute ad or any combination that fits within the overall allotted advertising time or space.\n\ndifferent clients at different locations may receive different location based advertisements while the client users are perhaps listening to the same audio stream such as a radio broadcast.\n\nthe advertisers and their service points or stores are usually local to the station, which is usually a reasonably effective method for advertising as a station has a limited broadcast range.\n\nthe present invention provides for a more effective distribution of content such as ads, by including the location context of the user and providing for content substitution based on this criteria. So, for instance three users in different countries listening or viewing the same site, listening to the same audio, or watching the same video stream or channel at the same time or essentially the same time, can be presented with different content based on where they are located.\n\nthe present invention it is not necessary to have precise time slices for substitution, although this may be beneficial. That is it is still useful to use location determination without defining an absolute time granularity to the content. Having the knowledge of client or consumer location still provides greater precision than traditional methods. For instance a business may create multiple ads that are say 1 minute and 27 seconds with slightly different content such as references to different store locations in each ad, thus still affording a more focused content delivery or reception based on the client or users location.\n\nthe location relevant media may be incentives from vendors and merchants such as discounts on purchases or coupons.\n\nincentives from vendors and merchants such as discounts on purchases or coupons.\n\nSuch a functionality can be achieved in a simple sense, for example by a merchant including some method of identifying that the user or customer received a location based incentive such as a key word to use at the store location or point of sale.\n\na System 100 client device such as a PDA to communicate with the client device, such as via extensible interface 114 which may be a USB port or infra-red communications, or similar link to transfer electronic coupons or other discounts or incentive items.\n\nextensible interface 114 which may be a USB port or infra-red communications, or similar link to transfer electronic coupons or other discounts or incentive items.\n\nsuch digital incentive information may be stored in a data table like LCMTable along with location context information. Additionally, such digital incentives may be delivered to the client as soon as the system becomes aware of the client's Internet address and location context. Another aspect of a preferred embodiment may not use a storage of such content in a table, but rather through a network transaction or communication with providers of digital incentives about the locations of clients and/or their network addresses. In a preferred embodiment both of these content delivery mechanisms may be utilized either separately or in conjunction.\n\na client with an onboard GPS connects to the network such as in a vehicle.\n\nthe location of the client device is communicated with a server using a previously described transmission method. This information is then stored in a table like CPTable.\n\na process comparing client locations to location contexts in LCMTable determines that the client is within the location context of digital content in the table which is an electronic advertisement and coupon. The process then delivers this content to the client, which contains an incentive component. The user upon seeing or hearing the incentive on the multimedia device 106, or UI 104 of System 100, decides to utilize this incentive. Inserts a portable storage device such as the previously mentioned USB portable memory into extensible interface 114 and downloads the incentive.\n\nthe user being close the location where the incentive was to be valid at, as would be the case since the content was delivered based on location context originally, enters the location and at the point of sale inserts the USB portable memory device in a point of sale terminal or device at the location intended for the receipt of digitally offered incentives, and this digital discount, coupon or other incentive is incorporated into the point of sale transaction.\n\nthe user of System 100 above may have a visual display comprised of a software aspect such as a current Web browser technology, use a voice control, to stop temporarily the delivery of more content, and issue a command similar to \"right clicking\" in a modern Web browser, which results in a menu including a save option allowing storage to the plugged in media.\n\na visual display comprised of a software aspect such as a current Web browser technology\n\nvoice control to stop temporarily the delivery of more content, and issue a command similar to \"right clicking\" in a modern Web browser, which results in a menu including a save option allowing storage to the plugged in media.\n\nmethods can be employed such as those provided for by the HyTime standard, ISO/IEC 10744:1992 and related technologies.\n\nthe scheduling module of HyTime defines an architecture for the abstract representation of arbitrarily complex hypermedia structures, including music, interactive presentations, multi-track sequences, and so on. Its basic mechanism is a simple one: the sequencing of object containers along axes measured in temporal or spatial units.\n\nthese digital incentives may be acknowledged via system 100 with a control such as dial, button, or command such as a voice control via UI 104 and/or multimedia capability 106, and rather than having to be downloaded, the acknowledgement is recorded in a system such as a DB 204 with information identifying the user such as a digital certificate, like those provide by VeriSign, or via other authentication, and through means at the merchant's site for which the incentive is valid can utilize the acknowledged incentive, such as with a point of sale terminal with a network access capability. It is an aspect of the present invention to use position as an aspect of content distribution, which may enable increased performance for the user and network providers. In the current Internet and content distribution infrastructure such as television and radio, content is delivered from everywhere to almost everywhere.\n\nspatial information can play important roles in fields like surveying, architecture, asset management, network management and telecommunications line costing which is calculated with a mileage component.\n\nThis discussion will describe some aspects of a more system centric approach and attempt to use network management including analysis and asset management, to illustrate the salient features of the present invention applicable to these environments.\n\nAsset management can begin to become difficult even in moderately sized networks of approximately just several hundred systems.\n\nOne large site such as a large company or government agency can easily have thousands of workstations, servers, and other equipment.\n\nthe problem is even more amplified in large distributed systems such as major telecommunications providers which may have many thousands of routers alone distributed globally.\n\nmany systems include software management agents that allow custom text strings and identifiers to be entered such as an address or other location identifier, there are often flawed processes or time demands that cause the identifiers to not be entered, or because the fields typically allow free form typing, mistakes are made in the input and invalid data, are entered.\n\na company may try to be proactive and enter the information before the device is shipped, but last minute changes in the destination of the device cause it to be installed in a location different that what is entered.\n\nnetwork growth occurs, often in rapid manner, sometimes minor to massive shifts of network resources occur.\n\na network company or telecom company may be expanding globally and in order to simultaneously meet demand in one region or country, it may make significant upgrades to newer more powerful equipment in one area and shift the replaced assets to new countries or regions and any location information may again not be updated.\n\nthe present invention provides a system and method for inco â orating an assets location as identified by means other than just addresses, to aid in tracking of computing and network assets.\n\nthe present invention provides for a means of inco â orating the location technologies, transfer methods, and encodings that are discussed herein, into the management process thereby providing the ability to determine the location of assets connected to and not directly connected to the network.\n\nOne method of the present invention uses methods similar to those described for user centric systems, whereby a network device such as a router, or even a collection of devices, can determine their location via a single or shared connection to an automatic location determination device such as a GPS.\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention which is not limited to the system centric method, but may be more common in these embodiments, is the packet header method.\n\nthese packets may either be saved, or a sample may be saved, or additionally, they may be opened at intermediate or end points in order to extract the transmitted spatial information and associated network addresses.\n\nthe packets maybe stored and analyzed outside of real-time, or the information may be extracted such as address and location and stored in a data table like CPTable. It may also, be useful to utilize this method with lower level protocols wherein the packet or frame allows for, or even if it doesn't allow for, but may potentially not be disturbed by the inclusion of spatial information in the message or header, hi some instances this information may be associated with physical addresses such as MAC addresses instead of or in combination with an IP address. In one aspect of a preferred embodiment, this information such as network addresses, associated locations, and time may be used as an aid to network management including traffic management and geographical mapping of the network.\n\none device such as a device with a system 100 capability, may use a wireless capability to recognize other devices nearby and associate its own location with these nearby elements and store or transmit this information using a transmission method like those previously described.\n\nCPE customer premise equipment\n\nISP Internet Service Provider\n\nOne aspect of the present invention may use the location of the router or switch providing service and associate that position with the network addresses of the devices for which it is providing routes to the network. This association may then be recorded or transmitted using any of the aforementioned transmission methods previously described.\n\nthe associated network address may be a physical layer address such as a MAC address in circumstances where those addresses can be ascertained, or other network addresses such as IP addresses.\n\na client/server management architecture is used such as is currently supported with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).\n\nSNMP Simple Network Management Protocol\n\nMIB Management Information Base\n\nthe MIB can be a confusing concept as it describes both an abstract mechanism and specific instances or implementations.\n\nthe MIB essentially describes device components, and attributes and the interface to the values of those elements, and a method for reading them to determine device specific information, and a method for setting them to sometimes control configuration, it is valuable for devices with spatial attributes such as a known location to be able to have MIB elements that address these spatial aspects.\n\na remote management agent may be able to alter this value to control the rate at which such a device sends spatial information to a server.\n\nMIB objects like those just described for the management and interaction of devices with spatial characteristics or capabilities.\n\nMIB objects including spatial extension entries (the last five entries), listed in an inverse method organized by oid, may look like the following:\n\nWAN wide area network\n\nthe present invention may inco â orate the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), sometimes referred to along with an earlier protocol the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) or collectively DHCP BOOTP; along with other service discovery and join capabilities like those provided by the Jini Connection Technology, Service Location Protocol and others either separately or in combination, including features for persistent naming over time and place via the inco â oration and extension of services such as The Handle System (www.handle.net).\n\nDHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n\nBOOTP Bootstrap Protocol\n\nBOOTP collectively DHCP BOOTP\n\nservice discovery and join capabilities like those provided by the Jini Connection Technology, Service Location Protocol and others either separately or in combination, including features for persistent naming over time and place via the inco â oration and extension of services such as The Handle System (www.handle.net).\n\nDHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n\nBOOTP Bootstrap Protocol\n\nDHCP captures the behavior of BOOTP relay agents [7, 23], and DHCP participants can interoperate with BOOTP participants [9]. Due to some errors introduced into RFC 1531 in the editorial process, this memo is reissued as RFC 1541. \"Additionally from the introduction in section 1.\n\nDHCP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n\nDHCP provides configuration parameters to Internet hosts.\n\nDHCP consists of two components: a protocol for delivering host- specific configuration parameters from a DHCP server to a host and a mechanism for allocation of network addresses to hosts.\n\nDHCP is built on a client-server model, where designated DHCP server hosts allocate network addresses and deliver configuration parameters to dynamically configured hosts.â\n\nDHCP Several important aspects of DHCP are the ability to allow delivery of information to a client before it has an IP address using hardware addressing, the ability to send initialization code such as operating system images or executable code, and the extensibility of functions by using the DHCP options fields.\n\ninitialization code such as operating system images or executable code\n\nthe system may use the inherent capability of DHCP to deliver code to clients which enable participation in spatial services, and other items such as the addresses of spatial servers and service providers within the DHCP options fields, thus providing an automatic configuration of the client for spatial activities and the automatic discovery of spatial servers and systems, reducing or eliminating the need for user intervention and configuration.\n\nJini Java based software architecture\n\nJini model offers some helpful features for a number of uses.\n\nlookup, discovery and join which in a general sense allow a device to locate and join a Jini 'federation' of devices and resources and to both announce services they provide or to use announces services of other resources. This is a handy capability, especially as we move toward the network appliance age and the local area wireless age where devices may recognize a local resource over a wireless link such as provided by the new Bluetooth wireless standards.\n\nJini model inco â orates a transaction model, a leasing model and a flexible security model and an abstract approach to services that allow a service to be any object such as machine instructions such as Java code.\n\na service to be any object such as machine instructions such as Java code.\n\nother means can be used to achieve these capabilities the Jini provides a core functionality that is useful as the bases for further discussion and a reference platform for this functionality.\n\nJini and other protocols such as Service Location Protocol are LAN oriented or ente â rise (one business or company even if it is across sites, such as via a virtual private network (âVPN\").\n\nVPN virtual private network\n\nthe Handle System is a persistent naming authority as described on the Systems' home Web page (http://www.handle.net):\n\nthe Handle System is a comprehensive system for assigning, managing, and resolving persistent identifiers, known as \"handles,\" for digital objects and other resources on the Internet. Handles can be used as Uniform Resource Names(\"URN's\").\n\nthe Handle System includes an open set of protocols, a namespace, and an implementation of the protocols. The protocols enable a distributed computer system to store handles of digital resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary to locate and access the resources. This associated information can be changed as needed to reflect the current state of the identified resource without changing the handle, thus allowing the name of the item to persist over changes of location and other state information. Combined with a centrally administered naming authority registration service, the Handle System provides a general pu â ose, distributed global naming service for the reliable management of information on networks over long periods of time.â\n\nSuch persistent naming provides a useful mechanism for storing persistent identifiers despite changes in location and time, which are related areas of the current invention. For instance, but not indented to limit the present invention, one use would be to store persistent handles for services such as pointers to location based service providers or servers to enable long term service location and other features, and to extend ente â rise technologies into the Wide- Area Network realm.\n\npersistent handles for services such as pointers to location based service providers or servers to enable long term service location and other features, and to extend ente â rise technologies into the Wide- Area Network realm.\n\nDHCP Dynamic Hossion Control Protocol\n\nJini Technology Jini Technology\n\nService Location Protocol The Handle System and related technologies to provide for the auto-configuration of clients and auto- discovery of and participation in spatial services over a wide area network such as the Internet.\n\na client may comiect to a network, and being originally set to dynamically determine its network configuration make a DHCPDISCOVER client broadcast request.\n\na server then hearing the request may respond with a DHCPOFFER request offering configuration parameters, which may include by the nature of the protocol a boot image containing code, which in this scenario may include capabilities for participation in the spatial layer, or other configuration items which may help the client to locate a spatial service such as the IP address and possibly port of a server, or a persistent handle from a persistent naming authority that has additional configuration information such as code itself or pointers to such items, or service and/or server addresses.\n\na typical DCHP client/server message exchange is illustrated in Figure 13, which is extracted from page 15 of RFC-2131.\n\na company may have a list of environmental hazards, or perceived environmental hazards in the United States such as geographic information system with the coordinates or geographic descriptors for ground level radiation, radon levels, or power transmission facilities, h addition some other party such as a candidate to purchase land, or other real estate may wish to quickly evaluate any risk associated with their future purchase based on its location relevant to such hazards.\n\na person may be interested in buying a home or real estate in a certain geographical area, say a given county.\n\ncompetition may be tough and their may be an advantage to knowing immediately when something comes available within an area.\n\na person may subscribe to a notification service that compares the address of new properties as they become listed from various sources to a location context defined by a user and associates and event or several events such as to send them e-mail or voice mail or other notification when a new property meets the location context they have defined.\n\na real estate agency or association may choose to publish such information in a spatial exchange environment, or to otherwise allow this information to be utilized in such a manner.\n\nthe present invention provides for a set of data tables or spatial object repositories, and processes for supporting these types of transactions on a publish and subscribe basis, which is a mechanism that will be understood by someone with skill in the art of computer science.\n\nthe present invention provides a means for using location contexts across disparate uses.\n\nspatial information such as finding services, products, landmarks, resources and relevant information.\n\ncurrent systems require repeated entry of the same location information across uses, such as from one Website to another and even at the same site at each search or on return visits, the same information, when recorded, may be suitable to a plurality of uses and situations whether stationary or mobile.\n\nOne reason for this missing cross functionality is due to a lack of common means for expressing location, some sites use zip code, some use address, city or state, some use shipping zones or other regional boundaries.\n\nAn additional object of the present invention is to extend current common information structures and standards to achieve an improved directory by adding spatial characteristics, object classes, and metadata.\n\nthe X.500 and LDAP directory standards include some foundation object classes that are collections of required and allowed attributes and standard attribute names, however there are no current object classes or attributes for expressing spatial information.\n\nCommon data formats and added information describing the content of the location information can help to achieve a more universal use.\n\nthe present invention inco â orates and expands upon modern information standards including metadata and content standards including the use and/or extension of the standard LDAP Directory Object Classes, the definition of a Spatial Markup Language via and XML Document Type Definition, and the Content Standard for Geospatial Metadata (CSGM), along with supporting and extending a plurality of data formats, like various methods for specifying coordinates and references (multiple decimal and hour/minute/second encodings, NMEA strings, and others), multiple spatial reference systems including (geodetic, celestial, barycentric (gravicentic, such as the current International Celestial Reference Frame), multiple datums (WGS84, NAD27), multiple ellipsoid references, time reference systems (GMT, UTC, UT1, UT2, TAI(atomic time), Sideral) and standard file formats including SP3 and PJNDEX.\n\nthe FGDC website is located at (http://www.fgdc.gov) with a specific section on metadata.\n\nthe objectives of the standard are to provide a common set of terminology and definitions for the documentation of digital geospatial data.\n\nthe standard establishes the names of data elements and compound elements (groups of data elements) to be used for these pu â oses, the definitions of these compound elements and data elements, and information about the values that are to be provided for the data elements.\n\nthe standard was developed from the perspective of defining the information required by a prospective user to determine the availability of a set of geospatial data, to determine the fitness the set of geospatial data for an intended use, to determine the means of accessing the set of geospatial data, and to successfully transfer the set of geospatial data.\n\nthe standard establishes the names of data elements and compound elements to be used for these pu â oses, the definitions of these data elements and compound elements, and information about the values that are to be provided for the data elements.\n\nthe standard does not specify the means by which this information is organized in a computer system or in a data transfer, nor the means by which this information is transmitted, communicated, or presented to the user.\n\nthe standard does not really address some important aspects of the information for use in computer and other automated systems.\n\nthe standard By reading the standard and reviewing published spatial information published as adhering to the standard one can begin to see why this is so.\n\nmetadata may be present to describe the spatial information content, such as the distribution means or contact information, much of that information is encoded in a form meant for human consumption as was the intent.\n\nobjectclass spatialObject requires objectClass spatialObject allows simpleSpatialCoordinates simpleSpatialCoordinatesType fullSpatialDescriptor fullSpatialDescriptorType fullSpatialMetadataEntry\n\nthe Extensible Markup Language is the universal format for structured documents and data on the Web.\n\nstructured data think of such tilings as spreadsheets, address books, configuration parameters, financial transactions, technical drawings, etc.\n\nPrograms that produce such data often also store it on disk, for which they can use either a binary format or a text format. The latter allows you, if necessary, to look at the data without the program that produced it.\n\nXML is a set of rules, guidelines, conventions, whatever you want to call them, for designing text formats for such data, in a way that produces files that are easy to generate and read (by a computer), that are unambiguous, and that avoid common pitfalls, such as lack of extensibility, lack of support for internationalization/localization, and platform-dependency.\n\nthe present invention may utilize XML to formulate and XML Document Type Definition or DTD describing common fields and structure for the exchange of spatial information.\n\nthe present invention may define a SpatialXML for this pu â ose. hi its simplest form XML provides for methods of describing the content of information in a file, as opposed to HTML which provides a formatting or display language.\n\na simple XML does not require and DTD and one can immediately use XML by placing worthwhile tags in a file that describe the content within them.\n\na document containing and address may be arranged as follows:\n\ntags do not describe the content, but merely there position in a table, thus making it hard to rely on such a method for the accurate determination of the content and thus ability to make use of it in a sophisticated, automated fashion.\n\nGMT Greenwich Mean Time\n\nUTC Universal Coordinated Time\n\nNTP simply Network Time Protocol\n\ncron it is a common feature on most systems with a UNIX based operating system to include a functionality called cron or cron jobs.\n\na preferred embodiment of the present invention may inco â orate time constraints in conjunction with location contexts and automation such as reminders and remote control.\n\nThis cron method is used to illustrate a method that may be used in a preferred embodiment for specifying such time constraints, and to aid in the description of how such scheduling may be accomplished, yet it is not intended to limit the invention to this method.\n\nthe sixth field of a line in a crontab file is a string which is usually a command that is executed by the operating system.\n\nthe string is the word 'date' which can be ignored, as this particular discussion is merely meant to illustrate a method for specifying scheduling or time constraints.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nTheoretical Computer Science (AREA)\n\nBusiness, Economics & Management (AREA)\n\nRemote Sensing (AREA)\n\nFinance (AREA)\n\nStrategic Management (AREA)\n\nAccounting & Taxation (AREA)\n\nDevelopment Economics (AREA)\n\nDatabases & Information Systems (AREA)\n\nRadar, Positioning & Navigation (AREA)\n\nSignal Processing (AREA)\n\nComputer Networks & Wireless Communication (AREA)\n\nEconomics (AREA)\n\nComputer Security & Cryptography (AREA)\n\nMarketing (AREA)\n\nGeneral Business, Economics & Management (AREA)\n\nGame Theory and Decision Science (AREA)\n\nMathematical Physics (AREA)\n\nEducational Administration (AREA)\n\nEducational Technology (AREA)\n\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation (AREA)\n\nData Mining & Analysis (AREA)\n\nGeneral Engineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nInformation Transfer Between Computers (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nL'invention concerne une architecture logicielle et matÃ©rielle mise en oeuvre sur un rÃ©seau local ou Ã©tendu, qui permet d'obtenir un contexte intÃ©gral de localisation spatiale.
