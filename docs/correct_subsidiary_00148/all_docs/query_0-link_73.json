He revolutionized conventional management thinking with the New York Times best-seller, \"The Innovator's Dilemma,\" which explored the radical paradox that great companies fail by making the \"right decisions\" in the \"wrong\" situations. The idea behind Professor Christensen's book \"The Innovator's Solution\" is don't sell products and services to customers; address their jobs to be done. The Jobs to be Done theory is the focus of his forthcoming book, \"Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice.\" By understanding what causes customers to \"hire\" a product or service, businesses can improve innovation track records and uncover new growth opportunities.\n\nA widely sought after speaker, advisor, and board member, Professor Christensen's research continues to be applied to national economies, start-up, and Fortune 50 companies, as well as to early- and late-stage investing. He is also an experienced entrepreneur, having started three successful companies: CPS Technologies, innovation consulting firm Innosight, and investment firm Rose Park Advisors specializing in disruptive innovation.\n\nYuri van Geest is a passionate professional, author, international keynote speaker and entrepreneur on exponential emerging technologies. He has a strong background in corporates, agencies, central government, startups, and his own innovation company Trend8.\n\nYuri is co-author of the bestselling book called Exponential Organizations with Salim Ismail, Mike Malone and Peter Diamandis. The book is about the fundamentally new ways startups and corporates are organized internally and externally to deal with disruption, exponential technologies and accelerated change. This the first book by Singularity University Press globally.\n\nYuri is the Dutch Ambassador of Singularity University, Managing Director of the Singularity University Summit Europe and a triple alumnus of the Singularity University, Exponential Medicine and Exponential Finance. He was co-founder/lead organizer of successful corporate hackathons and non-profit events & communities like Quantified Self Europe and Amsterdam, Mobile Monday Amsterdam, Lean Startup NL and TEDxAmsterdam. Yuri was a key member of the Topteam Creative Industry within the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation in the central Dutch government which focused on driving innovation at the ecosystem level.\n\nYuri speaks at large conferences for presidents, CEOs, CFOs, CIOs, CMOs, and CHROs, and Boards about how to execute successful corporate transformation in a time of fast-paced change. He also offers workshops (mentor/host), and training on the implementation of methodologies, practices and tools to help your organization to become an Exponential Organization.\n\nYuri is also passionate about Liberal Arts, Ethics, Values, and Socratic Design Workshops (a new emerging field he's very excited about).\n\nMatt Soderberg is a principal with Deloitte Consulting's Strategy and Operations group and is the Finance Operations Improvement Leader for the U.S. Matt has over 18 years of finance related experience, and focuses on delivering large scale Finance Transformation programs for industry leading clients.
