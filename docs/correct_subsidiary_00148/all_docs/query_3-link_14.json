Mem. 8549003 (Aug. 16, 1985)\n\nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE\n\n[2] Oracle is an information technology company that develops, manufactures and markets computer software. As the world's leading supplier of information management software, Oracle is the second largest software company in the world. Its customers are primarily domestic and foreign governmental agencies and large domestic and multinational companies. Oracle's principal place of business is located at 500 Oracle Parkway; Redwood City, California.\n\n[3] This appeal concerns the Tax Court's construction of 26 U.S.C. § 927(a)(2)(B) (the \"Statute\") and corresponding Temporary Treasury Regulation § 1.927(a)-1T(f)(3) (the \"Temporary Regulation\"),1 both of which relate to the Foreign Sales Corporation (\"FSC\") tax benefit accorded income generated from qualified export property. The issue decided by the Tax Court -- an issue of first impression -- is whether licenses of master recordings of computer software qualify as export property under the Statute and the Temporary Regulation. The Tax Court construed the Statute and the Temporary Regulation categorically to exclude licenses of master recordings of computer software from qualifying as export property for purposes of the FSC tax benefit.\n\n[4] The resolution of the legal issue before the Court on this appeal will control the result in a case now pending before the Tax Court in which Oracle is the Petitioner.2 As Oracle's principal place of business is located within this Circuit, any appeal of Oracle's case would lie in this Court. Accordingly, Oracle has a direct interest in the outcome of this appeal.\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n[5] Oracle fully supports the arguments made by Appellant Microsoft Corporation in its opening brief (\"Microsoft Br.\"), but submits that there is an additional reason why the Tax Court's decision must be reversed, namely that the Tax Court, having first misconstrued Section 927(a)(2)(B), then misinterpreted the Temporary Regulation to exclude licenses of master recordings of computer software from the scope of export property. As Oracle sets forth herein, by correctly construing Section 927(a)(2)(B) and the Temporary Regulation, the Temporary Regulation harmonizes with the language and purpose of the Statute and encompasses licenses of software masters within the definition of export property.\n\n[6] Of particular importance to this case is the fourth sentence of the Temporary Regulation, hereinafter referred to as the \"Master Recording Provision,\" which states:\n\nA license of a master recording tape for reproduction outside the United States is not disqualified under this paragraph from being export property.\n\nThe Tax Court ruled that this sentence by its terms, applies only to the music recording industry, and held that master recordings of both sound recordings and motion pictures -- but not computer software -- qualify as export property.\n\n[7] The Tax Court's ruling is contrary to the plain meaning of the words the Treasury Department used in the Temporary Regulation, and is contrary both to the language of the Statute and Congress's purpose in enacting the DISC and FSC statutes. By including the above-quoted language in the Temporary Regulation, the Treasury Department confirmed what is, at a minimum, implicit in the Statute: that licenses of master recordings of copyrighted content that are distributed on films, tapes, records and similar reproductions qualify as export property for purposes of the FSC tax benefit, as long as the copyrightable subject matter embodied in the master was produced -- through the research, development and programming necessary to produce the master -- in the United States. Because copies of computer software are both \"tapes\" and \"similar reproductions\" within the meaning of the Statute and the Temporary Regulation, master recordings of computer software fall within the Master Recording Provision.\n\n[8] Accordingly, royalties received from licenses of computer software masters qualify for the FSC tax benefit.\n\nARGUMENT\n\n[9] Section 927(a)(2)(B) provides that copyrights generally do not qualify as export property for purposes of the FSC tax benefit. The only exception is for copyrighted works on \"films, tapes, records or similar reproductions, for commercial or home use.\" The Statute states as follows:\n\n(2) Excluded Property -- The term \"export property\" shall not include . . . .\n\n(B) patents, inventions, models, designs, formulas, or processes whether or not patented, copyrights (other than films, tapes, records, or similar reproductions, for commercial or home use), good will, trademarks, trade brands, franchises, or other like property.\n\n(The parenthetical contained in the Statute is hereinafter referred to as the \"Similar Reproductions Parenthetical.\")3\n\n[10] This statutory language, by its plain terms, permits the export license of any copyright right in a copyrighted work to qualify for FSC benefit so long as the copyrighted work is in the physical form of a film, tape, record or similar reproduction. The Tax Court, however, ruled that the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical applies only to motion pictures and sound recordings, and that computer software does not fall within its purview. This is a misconstruction of the Statute. As noted in the Microsoft Brief, at pp. 19-21, Congress expressly rejected such limitations when it enacted the Statute. The Tax Court's ruling also makes no sense in light of the language and purpose of the Statute.\n\n[11] A \"similar reproduction\" within the meaning of the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical is a reproduction that, like a copy of a motion picture or sound recording, consists of a copyrighted work that is recorded on a tangible medium, where the job-creating value in producing reproductions from the original recording is small in comparison to the job-creating value of producing the master of the work. The type of medium used to make the copies from a master recording defines the ease of reproduction. Motion pictures, sound recordings and computer software all use similar types of media for duplication and employ similar duplication processes.4 Reproductions of sound recordings, motion pictures and computer software share the characteristics that the content of the recordings are creative works that are recorded on a master and distributed to end users by making copies of the creative works from the master recording.\n\n2. The Statute Includes Licenses Of Master Recordings Within The Definition Of Export Property.\n\n[12] While Section 927(a)(2)(B) generally excludes intangible property from being export property, it expressly excepts \"films, tapes, records or similar reproductions\" from the exclusion. But since \"films, tapes, records or similar reproductions,\" if manufactured in the United States, are themselves tangible property, they would need no exception to the intangible property exclusion from export property. It is also clear that the transfer of all substantial rights in a copyright (that is, a sale of the copyright itself) does not qualify as export property. As the tax treatment of these two forms of property would be clear even in the absence of the parenthetical, Congress must have been addressing a different form of property relating to copyrights, a form of property that falls between the two ends of the spectrum, by including the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical as part of the Statute. What Congress was addressing was a license that transfers some, but not all, of the copyright rights in a creative work embodied in a film, tape, record or similar reproduction, e.g., a master recording exported with a right to reproduce.\n\n[13] As discussed in detail below, this is what the Treasury Department said in the fourth sentence of the Temporary Regulation, i.e., that films, tapes, records or similar reproductions qualify as export property when such reproductions are used as masters that are licensed to make further reproductions of the same type overseas. The Master Recording Provision simply makes explicit and reinforces that which Congress intended in the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical in the Statute.\n\n3. The Plain Language of The Statute Applies To All Copyrighted Creative Works -- Not Just Motion Pictures And Sound Recordings -- That Are Distributed In The Form Of Films, Tapes, Records And Similar Reproductions.\n\n[14] In order to interpret properly the statutory language, it is necessary to focus on the meaning of the term \"copyright,\" as this is the threshold of what is both qualified property and non-qualified property for FSC purposes. There are two attributes of the term \"copyright\" that are important in ascertaining the meaning of the statutory language: (1) the types of creative works that are entitled to copyright protection, and (2) the specific rights that copyright law affords to the creator of a work entitled to copyright protection.\n\n[15] Section 102 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 102, generally affords copyright protection to \"works of authorship,\" a term that is broadly defined to include literary works, musical works, dramatic works, pantomimes and choreographic works, pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, sound recordings and architectural works. Computer programs are entitled to copyright protection. See 17 U.S.C. § 117. Copyright protection arises by operation of law when the \"work of authorship\" becomes \"fixed in [a] tangible medium of expression.\" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Thus, the word \"copyright,\" as used in Section 927(a)(2)(B), encompasses all works of authorship, including computer software, within the meaning of Section 102(a) of the Copyright Act.\n\n[16] The Copyright Act is specific as to the discrete rights that the law grants the creator of a \"work of authorship.\" Generally, Section 106 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106, grants the owner of a copyright the exclusive rights to make copies of, prepare derivative works based on, distribute copies to the public of, conduct public performances of and publicly display the work. The term \"copyright\" as used in Section 927(a)(2)(B) necessarily embraces this entire panoply of rights.\n\n[17] The Similar Reproductions Parenthetical set forth in Section 927(a)(2)(B) saves \"films, tapes, records or similar reproductions,\" from the general exclusion from the definition of qualified property. There is no language in the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical that excludes from its protection any of the types of works that receive protection under copyright law. There simply is no basis for the notion that the parenthetical includes some copyrighted subject matter and excludes others, provided that the copyrighted subject matter is embodied in films, tapes, records or similar reproductions.\n\n[18] The Tax Court's observation, Op. at 30 (Excerpt of Record (\"ER\") at 522), that copyright concerns content, not media, does not lead to a different conclusion. That is because the Tax Court incorrectly interpreted what the \"content\" of the reproduction must be in order to fall within the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical. As noted above, the Tax Court ruled that the content had to be a motion picture or sound recording. But Congress nowhere expressed any intent that the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical be limited to the entertainment industry. Indeed, as explained in the Microsoft Brief at 19-21, Congress expressly rejected an entertainment industry exception when it enacted the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical. The content that qualifies under the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical is a creative work that is recorded onto a master, and is distributed to end users by making further reproductions of that creative work onto a film, tape, record or similar reproduction from the master recording. Characterizing the issue as \"media versus content,\" as the Tax Court did, misses the mark. The question of whether computer software is export property within the meaning of the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical, we submit, takes into consideration both the content -- must be a creative work that is copyrighted -- and the media -- it must be copyrighted content that is contained on a film, tape, record or similar reproduction. Because computer software consists of copyrighted material that is contained on a film, tape, record or similar reproduction, it qualifies as export property under the Statute. Indeed, magnetic tape is one of the types of media upon which computer software was commonly contained during the years at issue. For such computer software, the question of whether it is \"similar\" to films, tapes or records does not even arise -- it IS a tape.\n\n4. The Legislative Purpose.\n\n[19] The Foreign Sales Corporation, or \"FSC,\" statute, 26 U.S.C. § 921 et seq., including the section at issue in this appeal, Section 927(a)(2)(B), was enacted in 1984. In pertinent part, it is identical to its predecessor, the Domestic International Sales Corporation, or \"DISC,\" statute, 26 U.S.C. § 993(c)(2)(B), which was enacted in 1971. Pub. L. No. 92-178, § 501 (1971). The congressional purpose in enacting both the DISC and FSC statutes was to preserve domestic jobs by encouraging companies that produce products intended for foreign markets to perform their production operations in the United States and to export the products, rather than to produce the products overseas. As the House Report in support of the DISC statute stated:\n\n[T]he committee agrees . . . that it is important to provide tax incentives for U.S. firms to increase their exports. This is important not only because of its stimulative effect but also to remove a present disadvantage of U.S. companies engaged in export activities through domestic corporations. Presently, they are treated less favorably than those which manufacture abroad through the use of foreign subsidiary corporations.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 92-533, at 1872 (1971); accord, S. Rep. No. 92- 437 (1971), reprinted in 1971 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1996. The mechanism of the statute was to provide a tax benefit, in the nature of a tax deferral, with respect to foreign-source income derived from the sale or lease of qualifying \"export property.\"\n\n[20] The statutory language that includes \"similar reproductions\" within the meaning of export property was the subject of discussion during the legislative debate over the DISC statute. The legislative history indicates that taxpayers whose products consist of easily-reproduced copies of master recordings that are created through intensive efforts within the United States should be entitled to the same favorable tax treatment -- even where the copies are made abroad -- as other exporters of tangible property.5 For example, in the music industry, the valuable jobs necessary to bring their product to market include the music writing, performance, production and recording activities. By contrast, making copies or reproductions of the record for sale to the public is largely mechanical, and is of minimal jobcreating value. Accordingly, in the DISC statute Congress specifically saved \"films, tapes, records and similar reproductions\" from the copyright exclusion. Therefore, the income derived from the sale or license of such reproductions would qualify for the DISC' (or, later, the FSC) benefit, irrespective of where the copies of those recordings were made. The lone requirement was that the original recordings from which the copies were to be made had to be produced in the United States.\n\n[21] From the standpoint of compliance with the domestic job-creation/preservation purpose of the FSC statute, providing FSC benefit for master recordings of computer software is on a par with that for master motion picture and sound recordings. As with motion pictures and sound recordings that are made in the United States, but licensed to overseas distributors for reproduction abroad, the valuable jobs needed to create computer software products are located in the United States. That is, the research and development, writing, production, debugging and all of the substantial technical and other jobs necessary to create the original work take place in the United States. The computer software reflecting this work is then recorded onto a master and is distributed to end users by making copies from the master onto various media. The job activity of stamping out copies is small in comparison to the work involved in creating the master.6 Like motion pictures and sound recordings, computer software may be copied onto tapes or compact discs with ease, at minimal cost.\n\n[22] The Treasury Department plainly recognizes this reality, as reflected in its recently published regulations under 26 U.S.C. § 861, which observe that a characteristic of computer programs is \"the ability to make perfect copies at minimal cost.\" Treas. Reg. § 1.861-18(f)(3).7 Thus, to construe \"similar reproductions\" as embracing computer software is fully consistent both with Congress's job-creation/preservation purpose and with Congress's express inclusion of films, tapes and records within the definition of export property.\n\n5. The Tax Court Erroneously Relied On Overseas Job Creation To Disqualify Computer Software.\n\n[23] In erroneously ruling that the Temporary Regulation excludes licenses of master recordings of computer software from qualifying as export property, the Tax Court relied on its conclusion that \"exporting a computer software master with a right to reproduce abroad sends adaptation, localization and manufacturing jobs offshore,\" Op. at 37 (ER at 529), and, accordingly, that \"granting FSC benefits to copyrighted computer software with the right to reproduce abroad would undermine the basic policy of withholding tax incentives from export transactions that create manufacturing production jobs overseas.\" Id.\n\n[24] The Tax Court's concerns in this regard are misplaced. Congress's purpose in enacting the DISC and FSC statutes was to encourage U.S. companies to maintain or establish manufacturing operations in the United States. That the export of a computer software master might entail the creation of some jobs overseas is not a reason to disqualify activities that also created more and better jobs in the United States. The Tax Court cites no legislative history or other authority to support its rationale. What is relevant is that jobs would be maintained or created in the United States by the activity Congress sought to encourage -- not that some additional jobs might also be created overseas. Indeed, it is often the case that jobs are created overseas by the export of a product manufactured in the United States -- someone would have to unload the pallet from the ship, for example -- but this would hardly disqualify that export from qualifying for FSC benefit. In fact, the very same types of overseas jobs the Tax Court identified, such as translation, localization, reproduction and distribution jobs, result just as much from the export of masters of motion pictures and sound recordings as from the export of computer software masters. Contrary to the Tax Court's rationale, eligibility for FSC benefit is not affected by the fact that a software producer might have employees outside the United States performing jobs separate and apart from the creation of the master recording that is licensed to the distributor. Activities conducted by a taxpayer's Controlled Foreign Corporation after the transaction to which the FSC benefits pertain have no bearing on the FSC transaction. Treas. Reg. § 1.927(a)-1T(c)(1).\n\nB. The Tax Court's Interpretation Of The Temporary Regulation To Exclude Computer Software From Qualifying As Export Property Is Contrary To The Plain Language Of The Temporary Regulation.\n\n[25] The Tax Court relied on its misconstruction of the Statute to misinterpret the Temporary Regulation. If the Tax Court had correctly construed the Statute, it could not have interpreted the Temporary Regulation as it did without doing violence to the Statute's language and purpose. In any event, the plain language of the Temporary Regulation compels the conclusion that licenses of master recordings of computer software qualify as export property. Oracle here sets forth the proper interpretation of the Temporary Regulation, which, unlike the Tax Court's interpretation, harmonizes with the Statute's language and purpose.\n\n[26] The Temporary Regulation consists of four sentences.8 The first merely repeats the Statute's language, and should be interpreted just as we argue the Statute should be interpreted, as set forth in the preceding section of this brief.\n\n[27] The second sentence of the Temporary Regulation concerns two different forms of property transfers: (1) the transfer of all substantial rights in a copyright and (2) the sale of copyrighted articles. The Tax Court, albeit somewhat cryptically, appears to have interpreted the second sentence to exclude computer software masters from qualifying as export property. See Op. at 33-35 (ER at 525-27). As demonstrated below, the second sentence has no application to the copyright right at issue in this case -- i.e., a license of a master recording for purposes of making reproductions.\n\n[28] The third sentence of the Temporary Regulation merely provides that copyrighted computer software articles may be on any form and still qualify as export property. The Tax Court erroneously seized upon this sentence to rule that the Temporary Regulation distinguishes among copyrights based upon their content. Op. at 33 (ER at 525). Neither Congress nor the Treasury Department, however, distinguished among copyrights based on their content. Rather, the Treasury Department distinguished among different types of copyright rights.\n\n[29] The fourth sentence, the Master Recording Provision, is the part of the Temporary Regulation that applies to the property at issue in this case -- i.e., licenses of master recordings of computer software. The Tax Court erroneously ruled that this provision applies, by its terms, only to licenses of master sound recordings. As we explain below, however, the fourth sentence provides that licenses of computer software masters qualify as export property.\n\n1. The Master Recording Provision Applies To Computer Software.\n\n[30] In interpreting the Master Recording Provision, the words \"master recording\" should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. The plain meaning of \"master,\" as used in this context, is a recording from which duplicates are made.9 The plain meaning of \"recording\" is simply something such as \"sound, visual images or data,\" that has been \"recorded\" on something such as a disc or magnetic tape in a reproducible form.10 Thus, a \"master recording\" is a recording of a creative work that can be copied onto discs or tapes, or similar types of media.\n\n[31] The Treasury Department did not distinguish among films, tapes, records or similar reproductions when it promulgated the Master Recording Provision. The Master Recording Provision refers only to master recording tapes. As noted above, as with sound recordings, \"tapes\" are one of the types of media on which both computer software masters and computer software are contained.11 The plain, unambiguous language of the Master Recording Provision squarely encompasses a computer software master recording.\n\n[32] The Tax Court, however, ruled that the Master Recording Provision encompasses only sound recordings. Op. at 34 (ER at 526). But if this were true, then licenses of master recordings of motion pictures would not qualify as export property -- a position that neither the Tax Court nor the Commissioner has advanced, because it is clearly not the law. The Tax Court's explanation for the omission of master motion picture recordings from the Temporary Regulation -- that \"it was unnecessary [for the Treasury Department] to refer to motion pictures in the fourth sentence because the legislative history reflects that copyrights in motion pictures fall within the exception and the motion picture industry did not lobby for modification,\" Op. at 34 (ER at 526) -- is untenable, for the following reasons. First, Congress does not legislate through legislative history. Rather, laws are contained in statutes and regulations. See, e.g., American Rivers v. FERC, 201 F.3d 1186, 1209 (9th Cir. 2000). Congress legislated the inclusion of motion picture masters within the definition of export property through the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical of Section 927(a)(2)(B), not a floor debate.\n\n[33] It also makes no sense to suggest that the Secretary would intend a regulation to apply only to two specific industries (i.e., the motion picture industry and the sound recording industry), but then write a regulation that mentions only one of those two industries. The more plausible interpretation of the Master Recording Provision is that the words \"master recording tape,\" like the words of the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical that it implements, are not limited to a specific industry. Instead, those words of the Temporary Regulation are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning. The Temporary Regulation was drafted broadly enough to cover master recordings of all copyrightable works that are copied onto \"films, tapes, records or similar reproductions.\" This interpretation avoids the anomalous implications that would necessarily flow from the Tax Court's interpretation: i.e., that when the Treasury Department promulgated regulations clarifying Congress's meaning, it nevertheless elected to leave portions of the Statute dealing with motion picture masters unclarified relying instead on a colloquy in a floor debate from years earlier to clarify the application of those portions of the Statute to the motion picture industry, see 117 Cong. Rec. 34, 894 (1971) (Statement of Rep. Mills) -- because it was the music recording industry, rather than the motion picture industry that had lobbied Treasury for the clarification.\n\n[34] Moreover, the predicate that underlies the Tax Court's tortured logic -- its assertion that the Treasury Department did not include master recordings of motion pictures in the Temporary Regulation \"because the motion picture industry did not lobby\" for such a clarification -- is flatly wrong. In a pleading filed in Oracle's pending Tax Court case, the Commissioner cited a letter from RCA staff Vice President Melvin Cornfield to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, dated January 15, 1973. (The letter is attached in an addendum to this brief). Significantly, the letter requests an amendment that specifically mentions \"movie films\" as qualifying masters, thus disproving both the Commissioner's contention and the Tax Court's erroneous explanation as to why the Master Recording Provision mentions only sound recordings, and yet also applies to motion pictures but not to computer software. The language sought by RCA would have added the following sentence at the end of the regulation:\n\nFurthermore, a movie film, master tape or record master licensed abroad to be used in producing individual film copies, tapes or records qualifies as export property if the requirements of this section are otherwise satisfied since such property is licensed abroad for commercial use.\n\nThe Treasury Department, however, rejected the proposed language that would have been specific to the motion picture and sound recording industries in favor of the more general language ultimately included in the Temporary Regulation. The Treasury Department instead adopted a broader exception for master recordings that is not limited to the sound recording industry, the entertainment industry generally, or, indeed, to any particular industry or industries.\n\n[35] Finally, the Tax Court's interpretation of the Master Recording Provision to cover both film masters and masters of sound recordings even though film masters are not expressly mentioned in the Temporary Regulation would violate the principle of construction \"expressio unius et exclusio alterius\" -- \"the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another thing.\" See, e.g., Longview Fibre Co. v. Rasmussen, 980 F.2d 1307, 1312-13 (9th Cir. 1992); Chicago v. Envtl. Def. Fund, 511 U.S. 328, 338 (1994). Applying that principle here, if (as the Tax Court ruled) only sound recordings are encompassed within the language of the Master Recording provision, then licenses of masters of other copyrighted works -- including motion pictures -- could not qualify as export property. Because it is beyond question that licenses of masters of motion pictures do qualify as export property, the words \"master recording tape\" of the fourth sentence of the Temporary Regulation must be broad enough to cover film masters as well as master sound recordings. We submit the Master Recording Provision is broad enough to encompass licenses of master recordings of all copyrighted works that are reproduced on films, tapes, records or similar reproductions.\n\n2. The Temporary Regulation Does Not Distinguish Copyrights In Computer Software From Copyrights In Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings. It Distinguishes Amongst Different Kinds Of Copyright Rights.\n\n[36] The Tax Court, relying on the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation, erroneously ruled that the Temporary Regulation excludes master recordings of computer software -- but not master sound and motion picture recordings -- from qualifying as export property. The second sentence provides:\n\nAlthough a copyright such as a copyright on a book or computer software does not constitute export property, a copyrighted article (such as a book or standardized, mass-marketed computer software) if not accompanied by a right to reproduce for external use is export property if the requirements of this section are otherwise satisfied.\n\n(Emphasis added). As demonstrated below, the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation is irrelevant to the issue in this case, as it does not address licenses of master recordings. That topic is addressed in the fourth sentence of the Temporary Regulation.\n\na. Congress Did Not Intend To Distinguish Motion Pictures And Music From Computer Software, And The Temporary Regulation Does Not Do So.\n\n[37] The legislative history of the Statute confirms Congress intended that motion pictures and music recording be treated the same as other copyrighted works for purposes of the DISC and FSC statutes. The House Report on the DISC statute contains the following explanation:\n\nAlthough generally the sale or license of a copyright does not produce qualified export receipts (since a copyright is generally not export property), the sale or lease of a copyrighted book, record, or other article does generally produce qualified export receipts.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 92-533, at 69 (1971), reprinted in 1971 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1825, 1883 (emphasis added). The legislative history makes no distinction between \"books,\" \"records\" and \"other articles.\" Rather, the legislative history refers to all of these types of articles in the same phrase, without distinction, confirming that Congress intended that the sale of a copyrighted book, record or other article (such as a copy of computer software) were all to be treated the same for purposes of the definition of export property.\n\n[38] In implementing the Similar Reproductions Parenthetical in the DISC regulations, the Treasury Department adopted the above- quoted portion of the legislative history which became the basis of the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation,12 but modified it as follows:\n\nAlthough a copyright such as a copyright on a book does not constitute export property, a copyrighted article (such as a book) if not accompanied by a right to reproduce it is export property . . . .\n\nTreas. Reg. § 1.993-3(f)(3). The words \"such as a\" that precede the word \"book\" make it clear that \"book\" is referenced merely as an example of a copyrighted article. That is, the DISC regulation could have listed other examples -- it could have said \"although a copyright such as a copyright on a book, film, tape, record, computer software or other article does not constitute export property, a copyrighted article (such as a book, film, tape, record, computer program or other article) if not accompanied by a night to reproduce it is export property . . . .\" The Treasury Department did not specifically list all such articles in the regulation. Instead, it used the general term \"copyrighted article,\" citing \"a book\" as an example. Given that the legislative history refers to both books and records, the language chosen by the Treasury Department cannot mean that the \"copyrighted article if not accompanied by a right to reproduce\" provision of the regulation applies only to books, but not to records, tapes, films and other articles.\n\n[39] Similarly, when the Treasury Department published the FSC regulations in 1987, it added to the lone example that was set forth in the DISC regulation (a \"book\") the example of \"standardized, mass- marketed computer software.\" The FSC regulation., like the DISC regulation, prefaces the words \"book\" and \"computer software\" with the words \"such as\" in order to indicate these are merely examples of the term \"copyrighted article.\" Accordingly, it is clear that the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation -- which is derived directly from the legislative history of the Statute -- applies equally to all copyrighted articles.\n\n[40] The second sentence is an affirmative statement that a copyrighted article -- be it a book, shrink-wrapped computer program, videotape, music CD or any other copyrighted article -- is export property. Moreover, it reiterates that a copyright, including a copyright on a book, computer program, motion picture or music recording, if sold, is not export property. On the other hand, a license of a master recording to make copies for international distribution is not addressed by the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation at all, much less disqualified by it from the definition of export property. As we now explain, that particular copyright right -- the only right at issue in this case -- is addressed only in the fourth sentence of the Temporary Regulation.\n\nb. The Temporary Regulation Distinguishes Licenses Of Master Recordings From Transfers Of Other Copyright Rights.\n\n[41] There are a number of different rights a copyright owner might convey to another. For example, the copyright owner could transfer all substantial rights in the copyright. This would constitute a sale of the copyright.13 At the other end of the spectrum, an owner of a copyright could sell or lease a copyrighted article to the end-user, without conveying any rights in the copyright itself.\n\n[42] Along the continuum between these ends of the spectrum are a number of other possible transactions involving copyright rights. Specifically, as the Commissioner has recognized, with respect to computer programs, these copyright rights include, in addition to ownership of all substantial rights in the copyright and the right to sell a copyrighted article:\n\n(i) The right to make copies of the computer program for purposes of distribution to the public of the copies by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease or lending of the copies; and\n\n(ii) The right to prepare derivative computer programs based upon the copyrighted computer program.\n\nTreas. Reg. § 1.861-18(c)(2). While perhaps not as detailed or as sophisticated as the more-recently published Section 861 regulations, the Temporary Regulation, which was published in 1987 (before transactions in computer software were as commonplace as they are today), similarly recognizes that there are distinct copyright rights. The Temporary Regulation provides, through a combination of the second and fourth sentences, that the right to distribute copies together with a license right to make such copies of the computer programs for purposes of distribution qualifies as export property, whereas a complete transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright does not qualify.\n\n[43] The most plausible reading of the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation is that it concerns only the two types of transactions at the opposite ends of the spectrum -- that is, the sale of all substantial rights in the copyright, and the sale of a copyrighted article. The first clause of the second sentence, \"Although a copyright such as a copyright on a book or computer software does not constitute export property,\" refers to a sale of the entire copyright. Thus, the Temporary Regulation provides that the transfer of a copyright itself does not constitute export property. The second clause of the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation states that \"a copyrighted article (such as a book or standardized, mass marketed computer software) if not accompanied by a right to reproduce for external use is export property . . . .\" In this clause, the Temporary Regulation simply makes clear that the copyrighted article is export property -- that is, the mere fact that a tangible article is copyrighted does not disqualify it from qualifying as export property.\n\n[44] The copyright right implicated in this case, however, is neither of these. Instead, it is the copyright right to make reproductions of copyrighted works in the form of films, tapes, records or similar reproductions, from a master recording, under a license, for purposes of distribution to end users. It is the Master Recording Provision (contained in the fourth sentence of the Temporary Regulation) -- not the second sentence -- that addresses this specific right. The fourth sentence states: \"However, a license of a master recording tape for reproduction outside the United States is not disqualified under this paragraph from being export property.\" Thus, to the extent that the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation might otherwise have been read to address a license of a master recording, the Master Recording Provision clarifies that the second sentence does not so apply.\n\n[45] On the other hand, transactions in which all substantial rights to the copyright itself are sold would not qualify as export property under the second sentence of the Temporary Regulation. Nor would they qualify as export property under the Master Recording Provision. That is, the general exclusion from export property of intangible property cannot be avoided simply by selling a copyrighted article and transferring all substantial rights to the copyright with the copyrighted article. Thus, if a copyrighted music record were sold, and the transaction included a conveyance of all substantial rights in the copyright, the property sold would not qualify as export property. It is for this reason that the Master Recording Provision is specifically limited to reproduction licenses (and then only to certain types of easily-reproducible copyrighted articles). By contrast, a sale of a master recording would be equivalent to selling the copyright itself, and would be well beyond a mere license allowing to a distributor the copyright right to make copies of the master for purposes of distribution.\n\n[46] Contrary to the Tax Court's conclusion, Op. at 34 (ER at 526), the proper interpretation of the Temporary Regulation creates no conflict between the different parts of the Temporary Regulation. The second clause of the second sentence refers to one type of transaction -- the license or sale of a copyrighted article -- and the fourth sentence speaks to a different type of copyright transaction -- the license of a master recording for purposes of making copies for distribution to the public. Both are export property and both qualify for FSC benefit.\n\n[47] The interpretation of the Temporary Regulation advanced here is the logical one, focusing on whether the \"similar reproduction\" shares the characteristics of reproductions of films, tapes and records, in that the copy can be made with relatively little effort in comparison to the work required to create the master; that the copy can be made with minimal expense; that the reproduction is of a creative work that is recorded on a master recording; and that the property is distributed by making copies of the recording onto media in the form of films, tapes, records and similar reproductions. Motion pictures,) sound recordings and computer software are all used by the end user in the form of a film, tape, record or similar reproduction, and all are subject to the same treatment under the Temporary Regulation:\n\n(i) A copyrighted article may be sold without any right to reproduce, and qualify as export property (Temporary Regulation, second sentence, second clause);\n\n(ii) All substantial rights to the copyright may be sold, but would not qualify as export property (Temporary Regulation, second sentence, first clause);\n\n(iii) A master recording may be licensed so that the reproductions may be made abroad, and the license would qualify as export property, provided that the reproductions are on films, tapes, records or similar reproductions (Temporary Regulation, fourth sentence).\n\nThis construction harmonizes the statutory language with the language of the Temporary Regulation, and is therefore the preferred, and indeed, the correct interpretation. See, e.g., Coca Cola Co. v. Comm'r, 106 T.C. 1, 19-20 (1996) (\"Regardless of whether the regulation at issue is legislative or interpretive, it is appropriate to ascertain whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose to determine whether the regulation carries out the congressional mandate in a proper manner.\") The Tax Court's decision and the Commissioner's interpretation of the Temporary Regulation violate this principle.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[48] For all of the reasons set forth herein, as well as those set forth in Appellant's Opening Brief, the Judgment of the United States Tax Court should be reversed.\n\nRespectfully submitted, David A. Hickerson WEIL, GOTSHAL & MANGES LLP 1501 K Street, N.W. Suite 100 Washington, D.C. 20005 202/682-7105 Counsel for AMICUS CURIAE ORACLE CORPORATION\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n[49] Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32(a)(7)(C) and Ninth Circuit Rule 32-1, 1, David A. Hickerson, undersigned counsel for Amicus Curiae Oracle Corporation, hereby certify that the Brief for Oracle Corporation is proportionately spaced and has a typeface of 14 points or more. The Brief for Oracle Corporation, excluding the items specified in Fed. R. App. P. Rule 32(a)(7)(B)(iii) contains 6,963 words.\n\nDecember 26, 2001\n\nDavid A.

Comm'r, and consolidated cases, Docket Numbers 13298-98 through 13301-98. Oracle's case has been stayed by the Tax Court pending the resolution of this appeal.\n\n3This appeal -- like Oracle's pending Tax Court case -- concerns the years prior to Congress's amendment of 26 U.S.C. § 927(a)(2)(B). The amendment specifically includes computer software within the definition of export property for tax years after 1997. Congress provided that no inference as to prior law should be drawn from the amendment. 26 U.S.C.A. § 927, as amended by Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-34, § 1171, 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. (111 Stat.) 788, 987.\n\n4The types of media used in making reproductions of computer software -- i.e., magnetic tapes, compact discs and the like -- are the same or similar to the media used in the motion picture and sound recording industries. When amending § 927(a)(2)(B), Congress expressly noted, in terms of the relevant technology, that \"computer software is virtually indistinguishable from the enumerated films, tapes and records.\" H.R. Rep. No. 105-148, at 518 (1997), reprinted in 1997 U.S.C.C.A.N. 912.\n\n5See 117 Cong. Rec. 34,894 (1971) (statement of Rep. Mills) (remarking that the reproduction of duplicates may be considered \"incidental assembly,\" which would not prevent the print of a film produced in the United States -- i.e., the master -- from qualifying as export property).\n\n6For example, in 1992, Oracle paid approximately 18 times as much in salaries to employees engaged in product development activities compared with those engaged in manufacturing and distribution activities.\n\n7These regulations, titled \"Classification of Transactions Involving Computer Programs,\" provide rules for classifying transactions involving the transfer of computer programs as sales or licenses of copyright rights, sales or leases of copyrighted articles, or the provision of services, or of know how, under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. See Treas. Reg. § 1.861-18(a).\n\n8The Regulation is reproduced in an addendum to this brief.\n\n9Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1990) defines \"master\" as including \"being or relating to a master from which duplicates are made.\"\n\n10Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1990) defines \"recording\" as a \"record,\" which is, in turn, is defined to include \"the state or fact of being recorded,\" and \"to cause (as sound, visual images, or data) to be registered on something (as a disc or magnetic tape) in reproducible form.\"\n\n11Indeed, during the years at issue, the majority of Oracle's software masters were distributed on tape.\n\n12The Commissioner, in a General Counsel Memorandum, expressly recognized that \"this part of Treas. Reg. 1.993-3(f)(3) is based upon the underlying legislative history of the DISC provisions,\" citing and quoting the above-quoted House Report. Gen. Couns. Mem. 39449 (1985), 1985 IRS GCM LEXIS 126. See also Tech. Adv. Mem. 8549003 (Aug. 16, 1985).\n\n13Under the regulations issued under section 861 of the Code, whether a sale of a copyright has occurred is determined by examining whether \"there has been a transfer of all substantial rights in the copyright.\" Treas. Reg. § 1.861-18(f)."
