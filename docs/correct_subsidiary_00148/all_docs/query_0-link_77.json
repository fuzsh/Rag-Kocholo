        "text": "Marketing automation saves time. It automates repetitive tasks, reduces human error, and helps you achieve better results. Instead of doing things manually, you can focus on more strategic tasks, such as campaign planning and design, goal development, research, brand consistency, KPI measurement, and more.\n\nEmail marketing automation is what many people think of when they hear the term \"marketing automation.\" However, it does more than automate email campaigns. For example, marketing automation software can streamline the following tasks:\n\nLead generation, nurturing, and scoring\n\nAudience segmentation and targeting\n\nUpsell and cross-sell activities\n\nCustomer loyalty and retention programs\n\nAnalytics and reporting to optimize marketing and content strategies (that is, tweaking the subject headings or send times)\n\nA/B testing to see which headlines, offers, copy, or images work best\n\nMarketing automation software also works to enhance your customer data and build better customer profiles. You can use this data to improve the customer experience (CX) by creating tailored, personalized experiences across channels.\n\n1\n\nHigher conversion rates\n\nWhen marketing campaigns are handled through marketing automation, clean customer data makes it easy to identify and target the right people. When the right offers are made to the right contacts, in real time, the chances are much higher of making a sale.\n\n2\n\nLess time—and resources—wasted on ineffective campaigns\n\nOpportunity and revenue data pulled in from the CRM system provides complete visibility into what’s working and what’s not. This means marketers can stop planning based on intuition. They can use data to make informed decisions, especially about continuing to invest in campaigns that may not provide the required financial returns.\n\n3\n\nKeep everything in order\n\nMarketing automation makes everything run smoother. It sorts out transactions, aligns activities, creates doable schedules, and aligns internal teams to achieve goals.\n\n4\n\nIncreased employee productivity\n\nWith the right marketing automation solution, your employees no longer spend time on manual, repetitive tasks. They can focus on more strategic issues. Marketing automation makes their jobs easier, more productive, and more engaging.\n\n5\n\nDrive and optimize revenue growth\n\nBecause of all the capabilities in the best marketing automation software, it is easy to drive revenue and grow your bottom line.\n\nData silos between sales and marketing teams are removed.\n\nThe amount of money spent on marketing programs is optimized.\n\nMore marketing qualified leads are generated faster.\n\nKey accounts are easily identified.\n\nIt is easy to enrich first-party customer data so it's easy to score and prioritize leads.\n\nCampaign results are improved thanks to clean and complete customer data across geographies and instances.\n\nGreater ability to guide prospects through the buying journey by delivering the right messages at the right time through the right channel.\n\nImproved capability to measure every stage of the buying cycle.\n\nSuccessful identification of the most effective campaigns and go-to-market strategies.\n\nAnalytics that allow you to predict the revenue outcomes of marketing and sales efforts.\n\n6\n\nImproved customer retention levels\n\nMarketing is not finished once a customer is acquired. Customer retention is just as necessary as customer acquisition. Marketing automation supports loyalty programs. It provides upsell and cross-sell opportunities and other initiatives that build strong and lasting customer relationships."
