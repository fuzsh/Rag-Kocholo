A list of Oracle entities is available here. Please select a region and country to view the registered address and contact details of the Oracle entity or entities located in each country.\n\nOracle may use data analytics and algorithms to help recruiters sort through candidate and application information. Algorithms help reduce the application or resume review time and assist in identifying candidates based on professional qualifications, skills, and experience commensurate with the relevant requisition. The algorithms analyze that data and compare it to our historical data on successful and unsuccessful candidates. Automated results are always evaluated by Oracle recruiters and are never the sole source of considering a candidate for employment.\n\n4.

We may also receive personal information about you from other sources, such as from references, in connection with background or employment checks, target companies where Oracle conducts due diligence related to a potential acquisition of your employer, and from third party sources like professional headhunters or recruiting firms, data brokers or if allowed by applicable law other sources such as Sites. Sites include, without limitation, social sites or platforms you have joined, where you have created a public page or profile or otherwise given permission so that recruiters can access and use your information. They also can include vendor sites where Oracle has invited you to participate in assessments, evaluations or online interviews. Online video interviews are subject to supplemental privacy terms.\n\nOracle may process the following categories of personal information for our recruitment activities as further described in Section 5 of this Privacy Policy:\n\nIdentifiers such as name, email address, and contact details\n\neducational background\n\nemployment background\n\njob qualifications and work eligibility, including your nationality, country of residence, and visa and immigration status\n\njobs in which you have expressed an interest or for which you would like to submit an application\n\nCV, resume or transcripts, and any supporting documentation attached to your resume such as copies of certificates and diplomas\n\nemployment references\n\ncompensation details, such as salary information, depending on your region\n\nbackground check information, such as a verification of your educational and professional background, and other relevant information subject to Oracle policies and applicable laws\n\ninformation about your personality, competency, ability and suitability for a position\n\ndata from surveys conducted by Oracle or by third parties on behalf of Oracle\n\npublicly available information, such as social media or other online resources where your information is made publicly available\n\ncertain types of sensitive personal information as described in Section 12 below\n\n5.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Oracle Recruiting Privacy Policy (Privacy Policy), when you use a third party site or Oracle provided technology (such as Zoom) to participate in an online video interview, you consent and agree to the use of your personal information as set out in this Supplemental Privacy Policy; such third party sites or Zoom may maintain their own terms of use and privacy policies for your use of those platforms, for which Oracle disclaims any responsibility. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Privacy Policy.\n\nPersonal information captured in a video recording may include personal information such as your voice and image.

Oracle reserves the right to make an offer or deny an interview, in its sole discretion, to candidates who submit an interview through this process, or who elect an accommodation to interview through phone or in some cases, in person with an Oracle recruiter. Any candidate, who Oracle determines in its sole discretion, has tampered with a video, shares unlawful or prohibited Content or violates Oracle’s Terms of Use, understands that all Content may be used as set out in the Terms of Use, including, to provide Content to law enforcement."
