In this context, \"necessarily be infringed\" means that such claim or claims are technically necessary to implement the IETF Standard at issue, and \"reciprocity\" means that Tekelec will commit to the above outlined licensing terms if the prospective licensee also commits to license its necessary patent(s) and/or patent applications under the same terms for the implementation of the IETF Standard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tekelec reserves the right to assert its patents against any use or product or portion thereof that is not necessary for compliance with the IETF Standard. Tekelec does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this disclosure and accepts no liability for any damage or loss resulting from reliance on information in this disclosure. Tekelec encourages parties to make their own independent evaluation of the relevance of any of Tekelec's intellectual property rights. Also, notwithstanding the foregoing, Tekelec reserves the right to assert its patents (including the right to claim past damages) against any party that asserts a patent it owns or controls (either directly or indirectly) against Tekelec or any of Tekelec’s affiliates or successors in title or against any products of Tekelec or any products of any of Tekelec’s affiliates either alone or in combination with other products, and any license granted hereunder shall be null and void with respect to such party.\n\nIf any claim or claims of the above-listed Oracle patents and/or patent applications are necessary for practicing any of the listed IETF publications, and such publications or part thereof are adopted as an IETF RFC, any party desiring to implement the RFC will have the non-exclusive right to use such patent claim or claims, that in the absence of a license would necessarily be infringed, under reasonable, non-discriminatory terms, with reciprocity, to implement and fully comply with the RFC. In this context, \"necessarily be infringed\" means that such claim or claims are technically necessary to implement the IETF RFC at issue, and \"reciprocity\" means that Oracle will commit to the above outlined licensing terms if the prospective licensee also commits to license its necessary patent(s) and/or patent applications under the same terms for the implementation of the IETF RFC.
