        "text": "Context Media\n\nThe Redwood Shores, Calif.-based database kingpin, which also is building up its collaboration and content management businesses, declined to comment. Industry observers, however, said the Context Media purchase would fit in nicely with Oracle's attempt to broaden its reach to repositories beyond the Oracle database-centric world.\n\n\"What they get is a very good content-integration product and some expertise in rich media,\" said Connie Moore, an analyst at Forrester Research.\n\nContent integration ties together document management and works with repositories from different vendors, Moore said. &#8220;So not only can you search all the repositories at one time, but also update the documents and put them back in.\"\n\nOracle isn&'t the only company on a content management-related acquisition binge. Rival IBM has been snapping up document- and records-management and related companies for several years. Over the past two years, in the wake of its billion-dollar acquisition of Informix, IBM has added Venetica to bolster content repositories, Green Pastures for document management, Tarian for records management, Ascential for data integration and Trigo for product information management."
