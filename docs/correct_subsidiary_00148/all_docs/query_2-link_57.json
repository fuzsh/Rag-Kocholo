        "text": "Almost as long as commercial software has been available to businesses, ERP software has also been around in some form. ERP technology has long been a cornerstone of both SAP and Oracle’s efforts to bring together financial records for enterprise businesses.\n\nIt can be hard to tell the difference between SAP vs. Oracle ERP from the outside because the ERP software market appears, at least at first glance, fairly homogeneous. In addition to consolidating and streamlining internal business processes, both these systems integrate sales departments, manufacturing and supply chains for financial accounting. Furthermore, they each provide centralized databases for the entire enterprise to refer to when making critical business decisions, acting as a single source of truth. As a result of this centralized database, enterprise corporations are able to increase their use of business intelligence software as financial data across the company is stored in one place.\n\nAlthough both SAP and Oracle claim to have solutions for all sizes of businesses seeking growth, the price tag may be prohibitive if not impossible for a smaller or medium-sized company. For rapidly expanding businesses with lots of moving parts, including procurement, supply chain and multiple locations, the software is worth the money.\n\nSAP\n\n4.5\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\nQuote-based (reportedly starts around $108 per user per month)\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nIntegrates with the SAP HANA technology\n\nStandout features\n\nMultilanguage and multicurrency support\n\nQuote-based (reportedly starts around $108 per user per month)\n\nIntegrates with the SAP HANA technology\n\nMultilanguage and multicurrency support\n\nEditor's Take\n\nFirst launched by five former IBM employees in 1972, SAP has grown into one of the largest business software players in the industry. SAP’s products are designed to help businesses efficiently centralize and streamline key processes and data to make smarter, better decisions in real-time, mitigate and manage risk and drive more profitable growth.\n\nSAP’s HANA computing platform is one of the most powerful of its kind and it is upon this platform that SAP’s Business One ERP software is based. With customers as big as Microsoft, as niche as Carhartt and as small as the Great Lakes Cheese Company, SAP has software options for any kind of business.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nFree 14-day trial\n\nBoth cloud and on-site deployment available\n\nIncludes benefits administration module and numerous software integrations\n\nLacks transparent pricing\n\nOracle\n\n4.1\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing\n\nQuote-based (reportedly starts at $625 per month)\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nAI-based risk management and mitigation\n\nStandout features\n\nReviewers highlight as great option for financial and resource management\n\nQuote-based (reportedly starts at $625 per month)\n\nAI-based risk management and mitigation\n\nReviewers highlight as great option for financial and resource management\n\nEditor's Take\n\nAnother early Silicon Valley startup, Oracle was first formed as Software Development Laboratories in 1977. As with SAP, the company has grown into one of the largest and most ubiquitous of business software players in the game with hundreds of thousands of customers big and small using various Oracle products to maximize profits and streamline business operations.\n\nOracle offers a cloud-based platform, meaning customization, updates and support are all quicker and easier than an on-site system. Businesses from Chipotle to Spotify to Red Bull Racing have all used the Oracle Cloud to develop, expand and grow their organization.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nHighly ranked by businesses big and small in 2022 TrustRadius report\n\nComprehensive financial suite with strong budgeting, pricing and accounting\n\nIntegrates with other Oracle Cloud applications to provide cohesive view of all parts of a business\n\nPricing is not publicly available\n\nA high degree of financial focus is evident in both SAP’s and Oracle’s ERP offerings. Accounting and reconciliation-based financial software are common features and present the ability to simplify recordkeeping, consolidate across departments and locations and integrate sales and procurement across entire supply chains.\n\nIn addition to supporting multiple currencies and languages, both platforms provide regulatory compliance settings and forms as well as real-time data management. To facilitate faster analysis of diverse financial records and increase revenue, these features also incorporate advanced computing capabilities, such as AI and machine learning (ML).\n\nSAP Business One Professional Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP\n\nAccounting\n\nStandard features such as accounts payable (A/P), accounts receivable (A/R) and fixed asset management\n\nStandard and advanced features covering accounts payable to asset management retirement and amortization\n\nBudgeting\n\nBasic budgeting features for managing and executing general planning\n\nAdvanced tools including asset lifecycle management in addition to standard budgeting features\n\nPricing\n\nStraightforward pricing tools to manage product pricing\n\nPricing tools can match market, currency, exchange rate and calculate profit margins, rebates and discounts\n\nHuman Resources (HR)\n\nWell-designed employee portal, payroll and e-recruiting functionality to help with both retention and employee turnover\n\nGood reporting capabilities including visual representations\n\nCRM\n\nIntegrates marketing, sales and finance to create a whole story of customers to help with contextual sales\n\nGood marketing support\n\nAI and ML\n\nHANA computing platform is basis of all SAP offerings and AI digital assistant “CoPilot” makes data accessible\n\nAI tools like Digital Assistant are built into all parts of Oracle software and use natural language to sort databases\n\nAccounting\n\nAccounting features, such as A/P, A/R and fixed asset management are offered by both SAP and Oracle ERP systems.\n\nWith Oracle, financial management and reporting are made more reliable and governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) requirements are incorporated. Oracle is proud of its risk management solutions, which help to enforce enterprise-wide compliance and automate some industry-specific compliance requirements.\n\nHowever, SAP’s risk management tools can still help your business identify and better understand risk factors and prevent cash leakage as well as enforce policies.\n\nWith Oracle, you can implement tools based on common processes. For example, the Asset Management to Retirement module covers the entire lifecycle of an asset, from acquisition to amortization to disposal. A point-of-sale (POS) approach is also used in “Transaction to Cash Position,” integrating it with long-term financial information.\n\nBudgeting\n\nSAP’s software contains relatively basic budgeting capabilities, such as managing and executing general planning. However, Oracle’s ERP system is significantly better.\n\nOracle offers a specialized tool called “Asset Lifecycle Management,” which enables you to utilize the financial potential of your equipment and other facilities as well as handle typical budgeting needs for businesses.\n\nPricing\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, Oracle’s offerings outdo SAP’s basic features as well. With Oracle, you can adjust your base prices based on market segment, currency, exchange rate and more. It can also manage profit margins, rebates and discounts using set guidelines.\n\nHR\n\nIn terms of HR management SAP offers a plethora of additional tools beyond what Oracle brings to the table. Several HR functions may be managed by SAP and users are able to find critical information about them all in one place. In addition, employees can access and update their information through a dedicated portal.\n\nIn addition to payroll, SAP ERP software provides e-recruiting functionality that helps companies retain employees and reduce turnover.\n\nEven though Oracle’s reporting capabilities aren’t as robust as SAPs, the visual representations allow for quick communication. If you’re looking to make more HR decisions based on data, this aspect could be especially important to you. By visualizing your company’s data, you will be able to see the history and future of your company quickly.\n\nCRM\n\nWith Oracle, you can plan campaigns and budgets on a single platform while SAP offers cross-functional processes relating to finance, procurement and marketing.\n\nSAP’s Customer Account Management tools can help your business with nearly every aspect involving the customer. Providing access to your customers’ histories allows you to deal with lead generation more effectively. Additionally, this tool integrates with marketing, sales and finance, giving you a complete picture of your customer’s history with the business and potential ongoing needs. With more knowledge of your customers, you can market in context and use smarter selling strategies.\n\nSales-order management gets high marks from us for both solutions. SAP casts a wide net and supports distributors of every size and across every industry segment. Oracle’s strengths are its reporting and data features.\n\nFeatured Partners\n\nAI and ML\n\nBoth SAP and Oracle integrate AI, machine learning and automation into their software but each uses these tools in different ways. SAP’s HANA computing platform, first introduced in 2008, essentially drives all of SAPs offerings providing automation, predictive analytics and machine learning tools throughout SAP’s products. In addition to its platform being built on HANA, SAP also offers an AI-driven digital assistant called “CoPilot,” which helps individuals access the deep analytics and data without requiring a human brain to dig through old reports.\n\nOracle’s software features the use of AI and ML as well as with tools, such as Supply Chain Finance, Accounts Payable and more driven by embedded AI. The company also offers its Digital Assistant AI to help customers get the most out of the platform. Oracle offers analytics and big data tools that use natural language processing to aid managers with database searching and analysis. Oracle also offers Oracle Database which offers similar benefits to SAP’s HANA platform."
