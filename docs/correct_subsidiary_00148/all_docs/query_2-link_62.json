In this context, \"necessarily be infringed\" means that such claim or claims are technically necessary to implement the IETF Standard at issue, and \"reciprocity\" means that Tekelec will commit to the above outlined licensing terms if the prospective licensee also commits to license its necessary patent(s) and/or patent applications under the same terms for the implementation of the IETF Standard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tekelec reserves the right to assert its patents against any use or product or portion thereof that is not necessary for compliance with the IETF Standard. Tekelec does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this disclosure and accepts no liability for any damage or loss resulting from reliance on information in this disclosure. Tekelec encourages parties to make their own independent evaluation of the relevance of any of Tekelec's intellectual property rights.
