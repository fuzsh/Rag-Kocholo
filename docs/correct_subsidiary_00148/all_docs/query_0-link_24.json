Mr. Daniel Harple Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors since June 28, 2007 Member of the Board since April 16, 2007 Prior to co-founding GeoSolutions, Dan was Founder, Chairman and CEO of Context Media, Inc., an enterprise software firm he founded in 1999. Context Media's purpose was to materially improve the way all digital media (unstructured data) is discovered and accessed within disparate enterprise content repositories and systems. The company won numerous industry awards (eWeek, Seybold, Demo, etc.) and was the seminal industry player in defining the Enterprise Content Integration (ECI) market segment. The company differentiated itself with its patented \"pipeline technology,\" designed and built as an open interoperable services oriented architecture (SOA) for disparate content systems real time integration. The product set enabled enterprise wide collaboration and access to content previously locked in disparate silos, i.e., the \"unified view.\" Key customers spanned multiple market segments- Sony, Bertelsmann (Media & Entertainment), CMP (Publishing), Citigroup (Financial Services), and General Dynamics, among others. Context Media was successfully acquired by Oracle Corporation in July 2005, forming the basis for Oracle's Enterprise Content Integration (ECI) strategy, and is now a foundational element embedded across multiple product lines: the Oracle Collaboration Suite, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise search, and Oracle Data Hubs. Context Media's investors included leading venture capital firms and corporate partners. The following firms provided funding to the Company- New Enterprise Associates, Adams Capital Management, Macromedia/Adobe, Lehman Brothers, and Silicon Valley Bank. Prior to Context Media, Dan's efforts centered on media research in a new company that he co-founded, Context Labs, with artist/producer/inventor Todd Rundgren. Context Labs focused on exploring and developing technologies to enhance our daily media experiences (audio, video, music, etc.), in the convergence of traditional media delivery systems with the web. This research led to Dan's founding of Context Media, emphasizing the enterprise access and distribution of distributed disparately located media and related unstructured data. The Context Labs research vehicle involved conceptualizing and collaborating on Todd Rundgren's Patronet.com, an on-line entertainment/relationship concept. Patronet technology seeded the industry for artist media interactivity, influencing early successful sites by Peter Gabriel and David Bowie, and subsequently became the core technology for Artistent.com, the onetime online entertainment portal founded by former Atlantic Records president, Danny Goldberg. Prior, Dan was Senior Vice President at Netscape, where he reported to the CEO, Dan merged the company he founded, InSoft, with Netscape in late 1995. InSoft developed the first generation of Internet media streaming and Internet telephony/ collaborative applications. These products resulted in NetscapeConference, and the Netscape Media Server. This work provided the seminal contribution to the Real time streaming protocol (RTSP). Mr. Harple was also instrumental in putting together the first generation industry wide group to focus on interoperable real time audio and video. Core components of this work on collaborative computing and streaming media resulted in a significant patent in these areas. Multiple \"firsts\" came of the InSoft/ Netscape relationship; (1) first commercially available shared white board, (2) Netscape LiveMedia Developer's Platform, (3) Netscape LiveAudio, (4) Netscape LiveVideo, (5) Major telephony integration efforts with Lucent, (6) Work on the Real time Protocol (RTP), and H.323 Standards. InSoft's application, Communique!, was the industry's first commerical-grade VoIP multipoint audio/video collaborative conferencing product. These technologies now provide some of the core infrastructure for the way multimedia and real-time interactive communications are utilized on the Internet, e.g., Webex, NetMeeting, SKYPE, etc., and offered the first commercial products integrating the convergence of traditional telephony services with the internet protocol (IP). Dan has an extensive list of publications, along with a long list of public speaking at events such as COMDEX, Networld/Interop, Internet World, SunWorld, Content World, Seybold, McQuillan Next Generation Networks Conference, and Commencements, etc. He has received numerous awards, including Inc. Magazines's Entrepreneur of the Year, the Red Herring Watch Award, the Upside Hot Startup Award, and the NEA Presidents Award.
