Filling out its content-management software line, Oracle acquired some of the technology assets and people from a small privately held company called Context Media. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Before the acquisition, Context Media employed 37 people, according to Oracle. The purchase gives Oracle software designed specifically for moving documents between different storage systems, such as a Windows file server and content-management system. Oracle intends to add the content-integration software to its content-management server, which is called Oracle Content Services 10g and is expected to be released shortly, according to Rich Buchheim, senior director of enterprise content management strategy at Oracle. The company also intends to use the Context Media software in its Oracle Fusion middleware to add content-management capabilities to its packaged application product lines, Buchheim said. He would not say how many Context Media employees came to Oracle in the acquisition.
