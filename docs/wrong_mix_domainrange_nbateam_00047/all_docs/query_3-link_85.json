        "text": "Entering his 15th season, Bulls forward Pau Gasol has checkmarks next to pretty much everything on his basketball checklist. He’s a two-time NBA champion, five-time All-Star, he’s made the All-NBA Second and Third team twice, respectively, won two silver medals at the Olympics with Team Spain, and at age 35, is averaging a double-double for a Chicago Bulls team that has sights on contending in the East.\n\nOff the court, Gasol spends a lot of time watching basketball and thinking about food. So we caught up with him recently to talk about his favorite food show on Netflix, the role of traditional big men in today's NBA, and how he feels now that a certain former teammate is about to hang it up...\n\nWhere were you when you heard about Kobe’s retirement?\n\nI was home watching games, which is what I do most off nights. I read the article he tweeted from the Players’ Tribune. It was surprising, especially with Kobe playing 20 seasons—it seems like he was just going to play forever. But you know, there’s a time for everyone. I think it was very classy how he announced it. And the timing of it was great. Now it allows him to have fun and enjoy this last season, and take the question out of the media’s mouth.\n\nHe’s called you one of his favorite teammates. When you first got to the Lakers, did it take time for you two to build a chemistry?\n\nThere was a chemistry and understanding right away. When I first got there, he came to my hotel room, it was like 1 A.M. I just flew in from Los Angeles to Washington after my physical was completed. He said, “Hey, welcome. Now let’s win a championship.” It was that winning desire that he obviously had and that I had after coming from a difficult situation in Memphis where we weren’t so successful. I was thankful for that opportunity.\n\nKevin Durant said the media has been treating Kobe Bryant like shit this season. Do you think the coverage has been unfair?\n\nI agree that the criticism he has been receiving has been a bit unfair. I think what KD was trying to say is that Kobe is a legend, and you have to show him more respect than criticizing him now for shooting a low percentage and shooting tough shots. He’s had an unbelievable career. He’s one of the greatest to ever play the game. The people who do criticize him at this point isn’t appreciating him. But you know, there’s a lot of media and a lot of angles. They’re just doing their job. But I can see how that can be upsetting and unfair.\n\nIf you had to give a farewell gift to Kobe, what would you give him?\n\nMan, that’s a tough one. The hardest people to give gifts to are the ones who have access to anything they want. So, it’s really hard to shop for a guy like that. Maybe a fun week in Barcelona, put together a trip for his family, go to a winery, have some wine tasting, go to a nice restaurant and hang out. Something laid back. I think at the end of the day, the most important thing is spending time with family and people that you care about and sharing nice moments together.\n\nEveryone around the league is talking about the Warriors and teams have implemented smaller lineups to try and emulate their success. As a more traditional big man, is there pressure to change your approach in order to fit in?\n\nA little bit. You have to evolve with the game. I come from a game where big men were more of a factor. But nowadays, the game has evolved and it’s more of an uptempo game. Three pointers are more of a factor. But not everyone can play like Golden State. Not everyone has a Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. That’s the thing some teams make a mistake on. You can’t replicate that. You have to play to the strength of your personnel. If you don’t have those type of players who are unique you’re not going to play that way.\n\nYou lost to the Warriors in late November, which was their 14th straight win to start the season. As a fan, were you rooting for the streak to continue, for it to reach 30, maybe 40 wins in a row?\n\nNot really. I wanted that Lakers record to stay because of Bill Sharman [note: Sharman was the head coach of the coached the ‘72 Lakers to 33 straight wins, an NBA record. Sharman passed away in 2013]. I knew him well and have a lot of respect and appreciation for him. I spoke at his funeral service. I wanted him to keep that record.\n\nWho’s the toughest NBA team you’ve ever played against?\n\nThe early 2000s Lakers with Shaq and Kobe. That was a difficult team to beat. San Antonio to me is another team. They’ve done incredibly well, won five championships in 15 years. They’ve been the most consistent franchise and have built a culture of continuity, keeping their core and adding the right pieces around it. And Boston, when we played them twice in the Finals. They were pretty tough.\n\nWhat about the toughest player you’ve gone up against?\n\nI’ve always said physically it had to be Shaq just because of how powerful he was. But I’ve played against a lot of incredible players in my career, the three I have the most respect for are Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, and Kevin Garnett.\n\nToughest teammate, and you can’t say Kobe.\n\nI’m probably leaving a lot of people out, but I have to say Shane Battier. He’s a guy I respect a lot. He does all the little things. He would bring that physical toughness and just knew how to play the game really well. I was really happy for him when he went to Miami and won a championship.\n\nYou’re a big food guy. Is there anything that you wouldn’t try?\n\nI’m very adventurous as far as trying things. There are things like insects, worms, or brains that I wouldn’t particularly love to try. Would I try it? Maybe. It depends on the day. But I’m definitely not like, “I can’t wait to have some worms!”\n\nWhat’s the most adventurous thing you have tried?\n\nI was in South Africa, and I don’t know if it was lamb brains or pig intestines, but it was something weird. I was hungry and I said why not. It was a buffet place and you just pick up everything for yourself. I didn’t know what it was, but I just ate it because I was hungry.\n\nWhen you’re on the road during the season, are you in the hotel flipping through channels and watching all the food shows on TV?\n\nI really love Chef’s Table on Netflix, that one is very well done. It’s really nicely produced and you see a personal aspect of the chef and not just the food itself. All the other shows—like the reality shows—I’m not that interested in.\n\nSo you’re not marathoning Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\n\nNo, no. Definitely not.\n\nPeople eat dinner really late in Barcelona, so I assume the NBA schedule and not getting out of the arena to your dinner reservation until past 11 P.M. isn’t that much of an adjustment.\n\nNo. I’m fine having dinners late. But in a lot of cities you can’t find a lot of quality food that late. Obviously you can get bar food but that’s not what you want to have.\n\nHave you picked up any guilty pleasures, like fast food or chain restaurants, from all your time traveling around the United States?\n\nI used to go to this placed called Houston’s when I played in Memphis and Los Angeles. They had great barbeque ribs. Benihana is cool too. I’d go to those places every now and again, like once a month.\n\n\"I’m not a fan of this deep dish pizza. To me, it’s just a cake of melted cheese. I like the thin-crusted pizzas better.\"\n\nWhat about Chicago-style deep dish pizza?\n\nI’ve tried it. I’m not a fan of this deep dish pizza. To me, it’s just a cake of melted cheese. I like the thin-crusted pizzas better.\n\nYou established the Gasol Foundation with Marc, and you’ve talked about wanting to be involved with philanthropic efforts and initiatives when you retire. Where did this desire to give back and spend your free time enriching the lives of others come from?\n\nI think it came from our family. Both of my parents worked in the medical field, so it was in us genetically, and we grew up around it as well. One of my desires as a kid was to become a doctor. I did go to medical school but I had to give it up after a year because basketball and med school don’t really go together [laughs]. That’s always been a passion since I was a teenager, so now I’ve found ways to have an impact through my philanthropic efforts. That’s my way to fulfill that desire and passion.\n\nWas that a tough decision for you to choose basketball over becoming a doctor, a career that was probably at the time less risky, would have made you financially stable and fulfilled a passion?\n\nIt was because it was a gamble. Even though I believed I had a good chance to be a pretty good basketball player, my parents were very reluctant for me to give up my medical career. I always told them if basketball didn’t work out after a year or two I would go back to med school and pick up my studies. So that’s how I convinced them.\n\nSo your parents were definitely more in favor of you finishing med school.\n\nThey were okay with me pursuing basketball. But they wanted me to try and do two or three classes a year while I was playing semi-professionally and not completely give it up. I did that for a year, and it was extremely demanding. That’s when I told them I needed to concentrate fully on basketball and we went from there.\n\nYou’ve accomplished so many things in your career. Is there one thing you feel like you still need to accomplish to complete your career?\n\nIf I could win a gold medal at the Olympics, I could retire right after that [laughs]. But I just want to keep doing what I’ve been doing. After 15 years in the NBA, to keep playing at this level, I think it’s pretty remarkable. I take a lot of pride in that.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed."
