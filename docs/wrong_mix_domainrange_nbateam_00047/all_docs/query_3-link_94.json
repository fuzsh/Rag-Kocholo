        "text": "(CBS) After having a renaissance year in his first season with the Bulls, Pau Gasol has been named the all-NBA second team center.\n\nThe honor comes after Gasol averaged 18.5 points (20th in NBA) on 49 percent shooting while also recording 11.8 rebounds (fourth) and 1.88 blocks (ninth) per game. It's the fourth time in Gasol's career that he's made an all-NBA team. He made the third team in 2008-'09 and 2009-'10 and also made the second team in 2010-'11.\n\nGasol was joined on the second team by Sacramento's DeMarcus Cousins, Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge, Oklahoma City's Russel Westbrook and the Los Angeles Clippers' Chris Paul.\n\nCleveland's LeBron James and Golden State's Stephen Curry were unanimous members of the first team. They were joined by New Orleans' Anthony Davis, Houston's James Harden and Memphis' Marc Gasol.\n\nThe third team was comprised of the Los Angeles Clippers' DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin, San Antonio's Tim Duncan, Golden State's Klay Thompson and Cleveland's Kyrie Irving.\n\nGasol inked a three-year deal worth around $22 million last July, then became Chicago's most consistent performer. He played in 78 of 82 regular-season games on a team riddled with injuries, helping the Bulls to a 50-win campaign and trip to the Eastern Conference semifinals that ended in a loss in six games to LeBron James and the Cavaliers.\n\nGasol also was named an All-Star for the fifth time, starting opposite of younger brother Marc of the Grizzlies in the game. They became the first brothers to start the All-Star Game together."
