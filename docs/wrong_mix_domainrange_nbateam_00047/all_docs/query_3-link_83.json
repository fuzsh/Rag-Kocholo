        "text": "Jim Cavan@ @JPCavanContributor I\n\nBest Potential Free-Agent Landing Spots for Pau Gasol During 2014 Offseason\n\n0 of 8\n\nJae C. Hong/Associated Press\n\nDuring his six seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, Pau Gasol racked up three All-Star appearances and a pair of championships, forever cementing his status as one of the key cornerstones of the Kobe Bryant era.\n\nSadly, the power forward’s L.A. tenure may be coming to an end.\n\nGasol will officially become a free agent on July 1, joining Carmelo Anthony as the early highlights of a class that could include LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and a host of others.\n\nWith the future of the Lakers in flux, Gasol—who turns 34 on July 6—would be wise to survey the league landscape, to pinpoint the teams that give him the best chance of securing a third ring and further enhancing his already sterling NBA legacy.\n\nTaking both financial flexibility and championship potential into account, we’ve compiled the eight best landing spots for the versatile power forward.\n\nAnthony may be garnering a lion’s share of the headlines, but where the savvy Spaniard ends up could yield an equally compelling shakeup.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\n1 of 8\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nOn paper, the fit that exists between Gasol and the defending champion San Antonio Spurs is nothing if not compelling. Indeed, Pau’s game is tailor-made for Gregg Popovich’s pass-happy, space-centric system.\n\nWith just $53 million in committed salaries heading into the offseason, San Antonio has some change to spare. Still, for Gasol to don the silver and black, he'd most likely have to take a pay cut.\n\nNot an extreme one, mind you. Even if San Antonio offered Gasol something along the lines of three years, $45 million, they would still be well below luxury tax territory. Similarly, if Gasol were to accept something closer to three years, $30 million, the Spurs would have more than enough room to touch up the roster’s fringes.\n\nThe potential frontcourt logjam between Gasol, Tim Duncan and Tiago Splitter could give both parties pause, but if these Spurs have taught us anything these past 15 years, it’s that unselfishness and adaptability are part of the franchise’s DNA.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\n2 of 8\n\nTOM MIHALEK/Associated Press\n\nBack in May, James Barragan of the Los Angeles Times cited the Chicago Bulls as one of a handful of teams Gasol would be keeping an eye on this summer.\n\nAnd while Gasol would indeed make for an intriguing fit alongside Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah, BlogABull’s Jay Patt points out that pulling off such a coup would likely entail some creative accounting:\n\nAnother option is attempting to engage the Lakers in sign-and-trade discussions involving Carlos Boozer. I'm not sure how receptive the Lakers would be to those talks, but they do have a ton of cap space and acquiring Boozer wouldn't ruin their 2015 plan.\n\nDoing a sign-and-trade involving Taj Gibson could be another option, as it would give the Lakers a young, valuable asset on an affordable contract. However, that would entail Gasol agreeing to an even smaller deal.\n\nThe Bulls also have the option of amnestying Boozer, thereby freeing up the requisite room, although his deal may be worth more as an expiring contract, at this point.\n\nGasol would certainly be an all-around upgrade over Boozer or Gibson. It’s getting the Lakers to go along that could prove the more difficult part.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\n3 of 8\n\nJae C. Hong/Associated Press\n\nOf the five teams entering the 2014 offseason with the lowest payrolls, the Phoenix Suns boast by far the most immediate playoff upside. If you’re Gasol, that’s an intriguing scenario indeed.\n\nIf there’s one area where the Suns could use help, it’s in the frontcourt, where last year, Phoenix leaned on the likes of Miles Plumlee, Markieff Morris, Marcus Morris and Channing Frye to be its big-body bulwarks.\n\nIt should be noticed the two have been mentioned in tandem: Back in February, ESPN's Marc Stein reported the Suns were interested in executing a trade for Gasol.\n\nTeamed with Goran Dragic, Eric Bledsoe (assuming whatever offer sheet he receives is matched), Gerald Green and the rest of Phoenix’s young core—not to mention the three first-round draft picks coming down the pike—Gasol would give the Suns instant Western Conference credibility.\n\nAs one of many teams purportedly interested (per Yahoo! Sports' Marc Spears) in Kevin Love, Phoenix is clearly in the market for a game-changing forward. Gasol may not boast Love’s talent or upside, but as a proven presence on a cheaper deal, he may be the ideal consolation prize.\n\nMiami Heat\n\n4 of 8\n\nLynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nIn a recent piece for ESPN, Brian Windhorst reported the Miami Heat had been discussing options for adding Carmelo Anthony to their Big-Three core:\n\nGetting James, Wade, Bosh, Haslem and Andersen to take pay cuts significant enough to open a significant slot for Anthony undoubtedly will be complex. It would require reductions that could stretch into the tens of millions over the next few seasons. Sources say the Heat's plan is to sell the players they wish to keep on the long-term benefits of making such a sacrifice.\n\nIf the Heat do indeed keep LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in the fold, but somehow strike out on the Melo sweepsteaks, Gasol would be a compelling secondary option.\n\nAssuming Gasol would be willing to sign for less, that would broaden—albeit slightly—Miami’s options for rounding out the roster.\n\nGasol would be an ideal fit: someone with the kind of steady paint presence to keep the defense honest and the vision necessary to spot open shooters along the perimeter.\n\nIf the Heat learned one lesson in its five-game finals drubbing at the hands of the Spurs, it’s that there’s no such things as too many good passers. Adding Gasol would prove they’ve taken it to heart.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\n5 of 8\n\nTony Gutierrez/Associated Press\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Marc Stein, the Dallas Mavericks will have Gasol (as well as Carmelo Anthony) squarely on their radar screen come July 1.\n\nIt’s assumed that Mark Cuban will be pursuing the two as potential compliments to Dirk Nowitzki, although with the Dallas cornerstone’s contract set to expire, that’s not necessarily a guarantee.\n\nStill, the Mavericks stand to have only $27 million committed this summer, giving them enough room to add two max or near-max level players (Nowitzki included) should Cuban decide to go that route.\n\nThe Mavs owner has seldom been shy about dipping into tax territory, a point he’ll no doubt be emphasizing during the aforementioned meetings. Whether he can prove to Gasol (and Anthony) that Dallas has a plan in place to fill out the roster, however, remains to be see seen.\n\nNew York Knicks\n\n6 of 8\n\nSeth Wenig/Associated Press\n\nYou knew we were getting to this one sooner or later.\n\nAs things stand, the New York Knicks lack the requisite cap room to pay Gasol his due. But with former coach Phil Jackson at the helm, Gasol may be willing to consider a sign-and-trade, perhaps involving the expiring deal of Amar'e Stoudemire, Tyson Chandler or Andrea Bargnani.\n\nIn fact, the Knicks, could structure a deal whereby his pay is back-loaded in later years, keeping them flexible in the short term while using Gasol as a draw—albeit an aging, ancillary one—for future free agents in 2015, when New York’s books will be virtually cleared.\n\nIn hiring Derek Fisher to be the franchise’s next head coach, Jackson’s plan to transform the Knicks into a triangle-centric team is well under way. Adding Gasol will only help Jackson legitimize the strategic transition to the rest of the roster.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\n7 of 8\n\nMark J. Terrill/Associated Press\n\nAs things stand, Pau joining brother Marc Gasol and the Memphis Grizzlies may be the longest shot we’ve discussed yet. The reason: ESPN’s March Stein is reporting the Grizzlies and Zach Randolph are discussing an extension that would keep the stalwart forward in Memphis.\n\nIf the deal should fall through, however, what better way for Gasol to bookend his career than by joining his brother on Beale Street?\n\nMemphis could also work out a sign-and-trade with the Lakers, giving L.A. a slightly younger power forward capable of being a short-term cornerstone. If Gasol were to take a discount to return to his former team, Memphis would be in a better position to reinforce what has been a somewhat shaky depth chart in recent years.\n\nCall it a fairy tale if you will; we’ve certainly seen weirder.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\n8 of 8\n\nAlex Gallardo/Associated Press\n\nIf the Bryant and Gasol-led Lakers can suffer through one more forgettable season, they have as much chance as anyone of reaping the free-agent rewards next summer.\n\nIndeed, if Gasol’s remarks on his personal blog are to be believed, Kobe’s word promises to be a key factor in the former’s decision-making this summer (h/t to InsideSoCal.com’s Mark Medina).\n\nRe-signing for the Lakers is a possibility, but I’m not sure whether to say it’s a remote one. If there’s anything or anyone who could make me stay it’s Kobe Bryant. I’d stay for him, but there’d have to be significant changes. I’ve said it many times: I want to be in a team that has a solid chance to win another tournament and where I can be an important factor in the game.\n\nGasol is right to survey the NBA landscape, to gauge which team stands the best chance of helping brighten his legacy.\n\nWhich is why, when all’s said and done, the simplest solution—staying put and hoping history and legacy are quick to aid—may be the best.\n\nX"
