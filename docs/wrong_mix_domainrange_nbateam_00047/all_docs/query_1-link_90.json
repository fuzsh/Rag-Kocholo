        "text": "The giant man was sprawled on the hardwood, hoisting the ball in the air with both hands, his mouth open, his eyes shut. The 1994 Nuggets, an eighth seed, had just stunned No. 1 seed Seattle to win a first-round playoff series. It was probably the best day in the history of the Nuggets. “And it was probably the worst day of my life I can remember, other than my dad dying,” said current Nuggets coach George Karl, who coached Seattle back then. “Losing that game on your home court, and being the first No. 1 seed ever (to lose), that’s pretty powerful.”\n\nThe indelible image of Dikembe Mutombo still haunts Karl, all these years later. There’s one thing that can help erase that memory. A Nuggets’ victory over the Lakers tonight in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series, which, if it happens, would cap one of the great playoff comebacks in franchise history.\n\n“Maybe I can put another one up on the board that rocks history again,” Karl said Friday.\n\nHe hopes to mirror the 1994 win tonight, on his 61st birthday, by winning only the third Game 7 in Nuggets’ history. The sixth-seeded Nuggets trailed 3-1 before stunning the Lakers with a Game 5 victory at the Staples Center, followed by a sledgehammer to the forehead win in Game 6 at the Pepsi Center.\n\n“Game 7 is going to be fun, I’m nervous already,” Karl said. “I’m turning 61 years old, and I haven’t been nervous this early in a long time.”\n\nHistory suggests the Nuggets have little shot. Only eight teams have rallied from a 3-1 deficit, most recently the Suns defeating the Lakers in 2006. And that Lakers loss was Kobe Bryant’s sole Game 7 loss. He’s 4-1 in Game 7s.\n\nThe Lakers have the experience, not only with Bryant, but with big men Andrew Bynum, Pau Gasol and Metta World Peace, making his first appearance of the series after coming off a suspension.\n\nThe Nuggets, though, have all the momentum.\n\nAfter Denver won Game 6, the question was raised in the locker room if any Nuggets had ever played in a Game 7 (the answer is no), to which someone shouted, “Most of the Nuggets haven’t even been in the playoffs!”\n\nBut, after Bynum suggested that close-out games are actually kind of “easy” before Game 5, it was the Nuggets who began asserting their advantage in speed, energy and depth.\n\n“We’re confident, the way we’ve been playing. We feel we can go there and get us one,” said Denver forward Al Harrington, a veteran team leader. “We had a lot of ups and downs this season, but this team has been very resilient. And that definitely helped us build the character that we’re showing.”\n\nWhile the Lakers are wondering what has hit them, with both Bryant and coach Mike Brown calling out Bynum and Gasol after the Game 6 loss, the Nuggets seem to grow in confidence by the day. The Nuggets are the youngest team in the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nKarl said his team is embodying the “teamness” he preaches as key to winning.\n\n“I think there’s more of that on this team than we’ve seen in a long time,” he said of his team’s unselfishness. “There’s no question that with the ego of basketball, there’s more laughter about it than serious debate of who should have a piece of the spotlight. I don’t know how long it will last, but I hope it lasts a long time. I still think that in these moments, the more focus you have on being a team, the more success you’re going to have.”\n\nUnlike L.A., Denver has no go-to player, no one guy who can make or break a game, a la Carmelo Anthony or Alex English. That might be part of what is giving the Lakers trouble. In this series, different players have ascended, from Kenneth Faried and JaVale McGee in the low-post to Ty Lawson and Andre Miller on the perimeter. By relying on no one, the Nuggets can rely on everyone.\n\nThe biggest task tonight will be controlling Bynum and Gasol, each of whom are coming off awful games, each motivated after being called out by their coach and superstar teammate.\n\nFor Denver, a fear is finding a way for one more game to stop the high-post playmaking of Gasol complemented by the low-post brawn of Bynum.\n\n“I have no doubt the Lakers are going to come out with the best game they’ve played all series,” Karl said. “We just have to be better.”"
