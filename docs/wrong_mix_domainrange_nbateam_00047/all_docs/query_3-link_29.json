        "text": "In 2014, Pau Gasol was contemplating what would be the next stop of his NBA career. He proudly bled Purple and Gold as he served as one of the cornerstones of the Lakers for seven seasons and helped them to win back-to-back world championships in 2009 and 2010.\n\nPau still felt that it was time to leave Los Angeles. As he became a free agent, the star big man sought a greener pasture, and he identified the Windy City as a perfect destination.\n\nA challenging and rejuvenating call\n\nAs he gained plenty of interest from the Oklahoma City Thunder, San Antonio Spurs, and the Miami Heat as a prized free agent, Pau ultimately picked the Chicago Bulls as his landing spot — inking a three-year deal worth $22.3 million.\n\nPau believed it was a good decision to become a Bull. As such, he enjoyed joining Chicago as his decorated run in L.A. went blurry at the latter portion.\n\n“I came to the Bulls to rejuvenate myself, reenergize myself, to be motivated again,” Gasol said. \"I wanted to be challenged and I wanted to be in a winning situation. The time with the Bulls was fueled by the difficult time I had in L.A. the last couple of years, injuries, coaching issues, and trade rumors (part of the annulled Chris Paul deal). It fueled me.”\n\nStill a special run for both Pau and the Bulls\n\nSigning Gasol proved to be a solid one for the Bulls as the Spanish great instantly helped them in the 2014-15 season by finishing with the third-best record in the East (50-32).\n\nRefreshed by his new beginnings in Chicago, Pau averaged a strong 18.5 points, 11.8 boards, 2.7 assists, and 1.9 blocks for 78 games — securing an All-Star nod as well as an All-NBA Second Team selection.\n\nAmid his regular-season brilliance, a hamstring injury-riddled Pau from competing for the Bulls in the playoffs. And his inconsistent availability in their second-round clash against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers served as a massive dent in their eventual postseason exit.\n\nWhile Gasol only played two seasons in Chicago, he will always have a soft spot for the city as it helped him reignite his basketball fire. Now a Basketball Hall of Famer, Pau stands proud that he once regarded himself as a Bull."
