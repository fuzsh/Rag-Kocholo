        "text": "DENVER — During one of his final visits here as an opposing player, in December of 2019, Carmelo Anthony was tugged forward, invited to gaze at the future. He was questioned about the eventual end of his storied career — which officially arrived with a retirement announcement on social media Monday after 19 NBA seasons — and asked to envision where his jersey would one day be hung.\n\n“This is where it should be retired, to be honest with you,” Anthony said that night. “Just my opinion, man. The history is here. This is where it all started.”\n\nThen, Anthony smiled, acknowledging the complication attached to the idea of raising his No. 15 into the Ball Arena rafters.\n\n“Joker’s got 15 now,” Anthony said, referring to Nikola Jokić, who Monday night will try to lead the Nuggets to the NBA Finals for the first time in their history. “(So) we’ll see. We still have time for that.”\n\nAnthony is right. There will be plenty of time for logistics, but this is not that time. Anthony is officially stepping away from basketball at the brightest moment in Nuggets history. With a 3-0 lead over the Lakers, Denver is about to play for a championship, something no combination of players and coaches have ever done for this franchise since it joined the NBA in 1976.\n\nBut before Jokić, Jamal Murray, Michael Malone and Denver’s supporting cast charged toward this moment, no one got as close as Anthony. He arrived in Denver as the third pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, representing long-dormant hope for a franchise that hadn’t won a playoff series in nearly a decade and had won only 17 games the previous season. The franchise had largely become an afterthought in a vibrant, growing city. They were rudderless, uninspiring, taking up residence in basketball purgatory.\n\nMelo changed that all from Day 1.\n\n“I hadn’t really played with a guy of that stature coming in,” Ryan Bowen, a current Nuggets assistant coach who was a veteran forward for Denver during Anthony’s rookie season, told The Athletic in 2019. “It was a whole different level everywhere you went. It wasn’t, ‘Hey, here’s your normal draft pick.’ You could tell this guy was a superstar.\n\n“But he didn’t have any sort of arrogance about him. He came in and worked hard. He just wanted to be one of the guys.”\n\nIt took Anthony only six games to author his first 30-point performance. During a 17-game stretch at the end of the season that helped propel Denver to its first playoff appearance in eight years, Anthony averaged 25.1 points and never scored fewer than 20. It was an early sign of what Anthony would become in Denver: a walking bucket who could score with the NBA’s very best. He did with style, his jersey quickly becoming one of the league’s best sellers. Fans began filling up the Pepsi Center once again, and during each of Anthony’s seven full seasons with the team, they were treated to playoff basketball in large part because of his dominance.\n\nNot since perennial All-Star and franchise scoring leader Alex English had led the Nuggets in the 1980s had fans seen a player so consistently great at putting the ball in the basket.\n\n“Melo is the one player who I thought would have broken my scoring record if he had stayed with the Nuggets,” English once said.\n\nBy the 2008-09 season, the Nuggets had built their most complete roster around Anthony, a group guided by head coach George Karl and the steady hand of veteran point guard Chauncey Billups. The team won 54 games, earned the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference and quickly breezed into the conference finals and a matchup with Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers. Anthony averaged 27.5 points in the series, which was tied 2-2 after a rousing 19-point home win during Game 4. The Nuggets could almost taste it. Instead, they were dealt another serving of playoff disappointment, losing the final two games of the series as the Lakers marched toward another NBA title.\n\nA little more than a year later, in August of 2010, Anthony requested a trade out of Denver. Anthony began that season with the Nuggets, continuing to score 25 points per game, but at the trade deadline in February of 2011, he was sent to the New York Knicks for a boatload of players, future draft picks and swaps, the last of which gave Denver the rights to the No. 7 pick in the 2016 draft. The Nuggets used that selection on a guard named Jamal Murray, a parting gift that could result in the championship Anthony and so many before and after him couldn’t capture for Denver.\n\nThe backlash against Anthony was swift. His request came before the player empowerment era that has made superstar team swaps all but routine. The perception was that Anthony was seeking a bigger market, that he didn’t believe he could fully grow his career in Denver. For his part, Anthony has said he didn’t want to be a part of a rebuild he believed was coming after the Nuggets suffered a first-round playoff exit in 2010.\n\n“We’re supposed to be building, not rebuilding,” Anthony said on the “All The Smoke” podcast in 2021. “And I went to them. I’m like, ‘I don’t want to go, but if y’all going to rebuild, it’s time for me to go somewhere else.'”\n\nWhen Anthony finally returned to Denver as an opponent with the Knicks in March of 2013, the Nuggets won in a blowout — one of their franchise-record 57 wins that season — and the crowd chanted, “Who needs Melo?” by the game’s end.\n\nBut time can be a healing balm. For his part, Jokić, who was only 8 years old when Anthony was drafted by the Nuggets, has gained an understanding of what Anthony meant to basketball in Denver, how he helped rejuvenate a fan base that had suffered through one of its darkest stretches before his arrival.\n\n“He had a huge impact here, especially because he was leading the team to the playoffs,” Jokić said in 2019. “He had an impact with this team, of course, and the people of Denver.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\n‘This is where it started:’ Nikola Jokic, Carmelo Anthony and the number that links two Nuggets stars\n\nThis current Nuggets team — which has won at least one postseason series in four of the past five years, has advanced to two conference finals and is one win away from playing in the championship series — has set a new standard by which all future versions of the team will be measured. But when Anthony landed here 20 years ago next month, the Mile High City had rarely experienced what he brought to the game.\n\n“We kind of started or created a different culture here,” Anthony said during that 2019 visit. “The uniforms changed, we changed the colors, and the vibe in Denver was different. The aura in the city, the energy was different. We were a part of that change.”\n\nThe Knicks (ironically, Anthony’s second team) coincidentally have retired the No. 15 twice (Earl Monroe, Dick McGuire; Anthony wore No. 7 in New York). So there is precedent for what should be an easy decision for the Nuggets whenever Jokic joins Anthony in the waiting line for the Hall of Fame.\n\nRaise ’em both to the rafters.\n\n(Photo of Carmelo Anthony: Garrett W.
