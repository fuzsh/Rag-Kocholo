        "text": "Whether he meant to or not, Carlisle opened the door for speculation that the Mavs could be open to dealing Odom for a player of relevance. It would require packaging him with say, Shawn Marion ($8.6 million next season), for a high-dollar player another team wants to get out from under the contract, for example Pau Gasol in Los Angeles or Amare Stoudemire in New York.\n\nBryant scoffed at the idea that there was uncommon “restraint” required in his performance against double teams so aggressive that Denver’s Andre Miller said afterward: “I told him that we weren’t going to let him beat us, and we were going to make him trust his other teammates. He did that.” Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum in Game 7 became the first teammates in NBA playoff history to combine for at least 30 points, 30 rebounds, 20 offensive rebounds and 10 blocks in a game. Blake concluded after Gasol’s Game 7: “You saw the hunger.” And Gasol will need to bring that intensity much earlier in this series. “Got to continue to play the same way,” Gasol said.\n\nAs he stepped foot into the Lakers’ practice facility, Kobe Bryant had every right to appear upset. The Lakers suffered an embarrassing 113-96 Game 6 loss Thursday to the Denver Nuggets, setting up Game 7 Saturday at Staples Center. Bryant hardly liked the effort Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum provided; they combined for 14 points on five-of-21 shooting. And, despite nursing intestinal flu symptoms, Bryant suited up and scored 31 points on 13-of-23 shooting. Yet, there Bryant stood outside the trainer’s room greeting reporters with a smile. Part of it was attributed to his improved health. “It’s been a tough couple of days,” Bryant said, “but I feel a lot better.”\n\nYou can call him soft, you can call him invisible, you can call him a Houston Rocket … but as long as he’s still dressed in a Lakers uniform, he will still do anything it takes for the Lakers to win. He’s not doing cartwheels about his situation, but he’s not giving up on it. He not thrilled, but he’s not Lamar Odom. “I get as much satisfaction out of setting the pick and making the pass to the man hitting the winning shot as I would if I made that shot myself,” said Gasol afterward. “I’m OK with my changed role here, less touches, more sacrifices, so bet it.”"
