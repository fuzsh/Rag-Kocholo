        "text": "Today the NBA announced their 2008-09 all-NBA teams and four international players were amongst them.\n\nDirk Nowitzki of Germany was named to the all-NBA first team. The selection marks the 7-0 forward’s fourth selection in five years to the first team. he missed last year’s team when Kevin Garnett and LeBron James were named as the first team’s forwards.\n\nDirk received the least amount of votes for the first team this year with 383 total votes. He was joined by NBA MVP LeBron James (610), whom was the only unanimous selection this year. Also named to the first team were guards Kobe Bryant (604), Dwyane Wade (572), and center Dwight Howard (598).\n\nYao Ming of China was selected as the center for the all-NBA second team. The 7-6 center received 354 total votes. This is Yao’s second selection to the All-NBA second team; he has been chosen for the third team thrice. The other players on the second team was Chris Paul (424), Brandon Roy (189), Tim Dundan (378), and Paul Pierce (330).\n\nOn the NBA’s all-league third team were Pau Gasol (165) of Spain and Tony Parker (158) of France. the two Europeans received the most votes for the third team. They were joined by two Denver Nuggets Carmelo Anthony (116) and Chancey Billups (131), and a rejuvenated Shaquille O’Neal (68) of the Phoenix Suns.\n\nAll four international players that made all-NBA teams were from the west, and of the fifteen players named to the teams, ten (66%) were from the western conference. This is the first time that Pau Gasol and Tony Parker have made one of the All-NBA teams, the two along with Brandon Roy, are the only first-timers amongst the fifteen players on the three teams.\n\nThe All-NBA Teams were chosen by a panel of 122 sportswriters and broadcasters. The media voted for All-NBA First, Second and Third Teams by position with points awarded on a 5-3-1 basis."
