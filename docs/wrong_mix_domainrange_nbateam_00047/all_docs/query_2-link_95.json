        "text": "For months now, fans of Purdue’s Zach Edey have been wondering just where he would land in the NBA Draft. Now, experts are saying what they think of him joining the Grizzlies. I was personally happy to see Edey picked in the top 10 of the draft. For a while, experts were saying that scouts weren’t digging Edey’s performance and that he would likely go later in the draft. But, over the past several weeks, Edey has been inching up in those draft predictions, and he ended up going No. 9 in the draft.\n\nWhat Experts Think of Purdue’s Zach Edey Joining the Grizzlies\n\nPurdue’s Zach Edey was selected as the No. 9 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft by the Memphis Grizzlies. One reaction that’s getting a lot of attention is from Grizzlies star Ja Morant, who posted a video on his Instagram story that has been going viral on social media. The post is a scene from Rush Hour 3 that’s supposed to be having some fun with Edey’s incredible height. This is all in good fun, of course, because the Grizzlies have plenty of tall players, including Marc Gasol, Pau Gasol and Steven Adams. I think Morant is pleased with the pick. After all, during Edey’s four years at Purdue, he averaged 18.2 points and 9.6 rebounds per game and was named AP Player of the Year twice. Two other Grizzlies players, Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr., also took to social media their their support. Bane wrote, “LETS GOOOOO,” while Jackson posted three salute emojis in approval.\n\nMatt Norlander, a senior writer, analyst and podcast host for CBS Sports and CBS Sports Headquarters, is all smiles when it comes to this move. “Zach Edey is, by definition and achievement, a once-in-a-generation player,” he said in a social post. “It’s a great night for college AND the NBA that a traditional big—one of the only guys in history to win back-to-back NPOYs—gets taken so high in the modern game. The Grizzlies will not regret this pick.”\n\nThe College Basketball Report is also stoked about the pick and shadows what I was saying earlier about people thinking he would go so late in the draft. “So much for ‘no skill’ ‘just tall’ ‘undrafted’ or ‘second-round at best,” they said on X. “Zach Edey proved the haters wrong and is LOTTO.” I’m so happy for Purdue’s Zach Edey and can’t wait to watch him grow in the NBA.\n\nRanking the Top NBA Superstars Today\n\nAnne Erickson started her radio career shortly after graduating from Michigan State University and has worked on-air in Detroit, Flint, Toledo, Lansing and beyond.
