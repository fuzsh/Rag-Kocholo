        "text": "Awesome week in Las Vegas! What a way to kick off season 7 of the Legends Of Sport podcast with engaging interviews and the best crew in the biz! Thanks to our friends at USA Basketball, National Basketball Association (NBA) and NBA Summer League. Big shoutout to our collaborators at Fujifilm and Momento. Check out our podcast on iHeartMedia and all major podcast platforms as well as our LOS YouTube channel.\n\nI am thrilled to have been inducted into the 2024 class of the California Sports Hall of Fame! Thank you to Christian Okoye and everyone who made last night’s event so wonderful. Congrats to my fellow inductees: Rodney Peete, Marshall Faulk, Scott Boras, and AC Green. Thank you to all the people in my life who have helped me along the way and believed in me as my dream blossomed into a long career. It was a very timely bookend to my 45 year career as a sports photojournalist. As I pivot off the court, I am excited for the many projects I am doing as we continue to build Legends Of Sport as a content and event platform. Stay tuned for updates soon!\n\nI had a fantastic time at NBA House in Vancouver for Game 2 of the Finals! Chatted about my career shooting 40 NBA Finals and a watch party with 7x champ Robert Horry. Thanks to Ashton Lawrence and the great team from NBA Canada plus Keith Leinweber and the team at Victory Creative Group, Inc. Canadian NBA fans ROCK!!"
