        "text": "Portland Trail Blazers\n\nArvydas Sabonis\n\nSabonis will always be a prime example of what could have been. The Lithuanian star was fantastic on the court, but we’ll always wonder about the heights he could have reached had he not gone to the NBA so late (31 years old) and if injuries hadn’t spoiled his time in the league. Head coach Red Auerbach, the 9-time champion with the Celtics, said it best: “If he hadn’t suffered so many injuries, Sabonis would have been the best center in history,” Auerbach said.\n\nDespite his impressive size, Sabonnis could play as a forward, center, and guard, he could even play on the wing. His first stint with the Blazers went from 1995 to 2001, and he came back for a second in 2002-03. In Europe, he played for Zalgiris, Valladolid, and Real Madrid, with whom he won the EuroLeague in 1995. He lost in the Conference Finals against the Lakers in 2000, and he averaged 12 points, 7,3 rebounds, and 2 assists, and now he enjoys retirement watching his son Domantas Sabonis succeed with the Sacramento Kings.\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nTom Meschery\n\nThe forgotten pioneer. The one that has been a bit left out of the conversation when it comes to international players. Way before Petrovic in 1993, Tom Mescery (1938) was the first European -and the first non-American- to have his jersey retired (number 14 by the Warriors). A Chinese-born Russian who later got the American nationality -which is why he’s not always considered a foreigner- he played for the Warriors between 1961 and 1967, and then he went to the Seattle Supersonics between 1967 and 1971. He averaged 12,7 points and 8.6 rebounds.\n\nHe was also the first European All-Star in 1963, he lost in the finals in 1964 and 1967 against the Celtics and Sixers, respectively. Meschery became a poet after retiring and even became a well-known novelist.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nRolando Blackman\n\nRolando Blackman’s (1959) number 22 hangs in Dallas alongside Dirk Nowitzki’s in Dallas. He was essential for the Mavericks in the 80s before he went to the Knicks in 1992 after spending 11 years in Dallas. In fact, Blackman is the second-highest scorer in Mavericks’ history, only behind Nowitzki. He was an excellent mid-range shooter, he averaged 18 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 3 assists. He’s also remembered for the fight he had with Petrovic in 1992. He reached his peak in 1992 in the final that the Knicks lost to the Rockets.\n\nNew Jersey Nets\n\nDrazen Petrovic\n\nPetrovic (Croatia 1964) had a killer look in his eyes and was fiercely competitive. He arrived in America in 1989 to prove that European players ought to be respected; he became the first European player to catch the NBA by storm, and although he didn’t leave his mark with the Blazers in his first two seasons, the next three with the New Jersey Nets proved what he could do. He took the Nets to the playoffs for the first time in six years and he averaged 22.3 points in his last season in the best league in the world.\n\nThe Croatian forward, who had stints with Sibenka, Cibona, and Real Madrid, passed away in a car accident in 1993; his number-3 jersey was retired by the Nets a few months later. The basketball ‘Mozart’ couldn’t finish his work and will remain incomplete for the rest of time as we wonder what could have been.\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nHakeem Olajuwon\n\nThe best African player in history. Everyone knew Olajuwon would be great from the moment he was selected ahead of Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton at the 1984 draft. The devastating center that Knicks coach Pat Riley and Spurs star David Robinson referred to as “a guy you can do nothing against.” Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria, 1963), dominated the NBA for long stretches of the 90s to win the ring in 1994 and 1995 with the Rockets, who retired his number-34 jersey after 17 years with the franchise.\n\nHe was a bruising center with a mobility that resembled modern centers more than the style of the time. Olajuwon was the best shot-blocker in history with 3.830 blocks, he averaged 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 2,5 assists, and he’s only one of four players in history to register a quadruple-double, which means he had double digits in points, assists, rebounds, and blocks in the same game.\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nPatrick Ewing\n\nAnother giant whose magnitude goes beyond his size. As the 7ft-tall, number-1 pick in the 1985 NBA draft, Patrick Ewing (Jamaica, 1962), left a fascinating mark in the sport throughout his 17 seasons in the NBA, 15 of which he spent with the Knicks, who retired his number-33 jersey in 2003. His clashes on the paint with Olajuwon, another dominant center at the time -especially at the 1994 Finals that the Knicks lost to the Rockets-, was a staple of his career in the league, but he had the misfortune of playing at the same time and in the same conference as Michael Jordan, in addition to always lacking a team that could contend for a championship.\n\nHe was chosen as one of the best 50 players in the league, he was an 11-time All-Star, and averaged 21 points and 9.8 rebounds. The fact that he earned a spot on the 1992 Dream Team that won the Olympic gold says everything we need to know about ‘Big Pat.’\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nVlade Divac\n\nAnother fierce competitor from the Balkans, and one of the most notable members of the Yugoslavian squad that won the World Championship in 1990. Vlade Divac (Serbia, 1968) landed in the NBA in 1989 to play for Magic Johnson’s Lakers. Divac was a center with a talent for assisting, he lost the 1991 finals against the Chicago Bulls and he revitalized his career between 1999 and 2004 with the Sacramento Kings before returning to the Lakers in 04/05 to put an end to his career.\n\nSacramento retired Divac’s number 21. He averaged 11,8 points, 8,2 rebounds, and 3 assists per game in his career. He arrived in the NBA in the same year as his friend Drazen Petrovic, whom he had a strained relationship with after an incident in the 1990 World Championship final against the Soviet Union where a fan handed Divac a Croatian flag that he tossed in the ground, which didn’t sit well with Petrovic since he was born in Croatia.\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nPeja Stojakovic\n\nThe Serbian forward (1977) was a pure shooter, one of those players who lived by the three. He’s revered in Sacramento, as well as his fellow countryman Vlade Divac as part of the team that reached the 2002 Conference Finals against the Lakers despite losing in the end. That remains the best outcome from the franchise since the Kings landed in Sacramento in 1985.\n\nStojakovic carved a spot in the NBA with the California franchise between 1999 and 2006 wearing the now-retired number 16. Although he gave the Kings his best moments, he won a ring in 2011 with Dallas alongside Nowitzki. He averaged 17 points, 4,7 rebounds, and 2 assists while shooting 40% from three.\n\nLos Ángeles Lakers\n\nPau Gasol\n\nHe’ll have the time of his life seeing his number 16 going up in the air to join other all-time greats like Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neale, Kareem Abul-Jabbar, and Wilt Chamberlain. There are so many nights and epic memories alongside ‘The Black mamba’ where they formed the perfect duo to win the championship in 2009 and 2010. His six and a half seasons in Los Angeles have taken his name to legend status. Gasol averaged 17 points, 9,2 rebounds, and 3,2 assists in his time in the league.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nMarc Gasol\n\nMarc is the first Spanish player to have their jersey retired -number 33-, if we consider the time of the announcement and not the time of the ceremony. The Grizzlies made the decision in 2019 before the Lakers did the same for his brother, but the ceremony hasn’t taken place yet. Gasol had his greatest accomplishment that same year after winning an NBA ring with the Raptors, but he dedicated 11 seasons to the Grizzlies, where he had six playoff appearances and was the first European to be selected as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2013.\n\n‘Big March’ (1985) averaged 14 points, 7,4 rebounds, and 3,4 assists. Some voices around the list have asked that both brothers should have their jerseys retired.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nDirk Nowitzki\n\nLoyalty, versatility, and longevity. Many adjectives can be used to describe the man who took the Dallas Mavericks to the summit of the NBA. Nowitzki (Germany, 1978) pledged his undying love and loyalty to Dallas -he played 21 seasons for the Mavericks, not even Kobe spent so much time with the same team-. Dirk didn’t move like a 7-footer because his range and versatility made him a positionless star. Nowitzki was the first European to win the MVP (2007) and took the Mavericks to the championship in 2011. The first and only title in franchise history.\n\nDirk served as a bridge between the previous era of dominating big men in the paint with the modern era of big men that play like guards. His flawless mid-range jumper was one of the many highlights of his game. Nowitzki wanted to wear the number 14 on his back, but when he heard he couldn’t he just decided to flip the numbers to ‘41,’ the same number that now hangs from the rafters at American Airlines Center. Everyone hopes that Luka Doncic will be the next “blond European” to win a ring for Dallas.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nSteve Nash\n\nA North-American that wasn’t born in the U.S. became one of the best passers in the history of the league. Steve Nash (1974) was born in South Africa and grew up in Canada. He jumped to superstardom during his time with the Phoenix Suns (2004 - 2013), and he distributed the ball like few have done before or after him. Nash was the assist leader in four seasons and is in fourth place on the all-time assist leader board behind John Stockton, Jason Kidd, and Chris Paul.\n\nA two-time MVP in 2005 and 2006, and an 8-time All-Star, the former Brooklyn Nets coach is only missing the championship ring that he couldn’t win during his 19 seasons in the league. He averaged 14,5 points and 8,5 assists per game while shooting 43% from three. The Suns retired his number-13 jersey.\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nYao Ming\n\nYao Ming (China, 1980) never reached the heights that were expected of him as the fourth tallest player in NBA history (7 ft 6 in), but he remains the only Asian player to have their jersey retired by an NBA franchise. The Rockets gave him the honor of retiring number ‘11’ after nine years with the team, from 2002 to 2011.\n\nAs the first pick in the 2002 draft, he left an impressive mark in his first year by blocking Shaquille O’Neal three times, but even though he was a perennial All-Star, injuries hampered his career, and never made it past the second round of the playoffs. He retired in 2011 at only 30 years old and averaged 19 points and 9,2 rebounds per game.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nManu Ginóbili\n\nHis incredible on-court intelligence defined Manu Ginobili (1977), in addition to his steady hand and strong character. Another star who spent his entire career with one franchise like Nowitzki, the Argentinian legend was part of that Spurs Big Three alongside Tony Parker and Tim Duncan -considered the best Big Three in history for all that they accomplished- he brought played in San Antonio between 2002 and 2018 and won four rings (2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014). He was a great orchestrator, and an amazing shooter, he’s also the only forward in history to win the EuroLeague, the NBA, and the Olympic gold medal. He averaged 13,3 points and 3.8 assists. With all these accolades, how could the Spurs not retire his number 20?\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nTony Parker\n\nIt was easy for Tony Parker (France, 1982) just based on his look standing at only 6 ft 2 in, but he said everything he needed to on the court as the first European player to win Finals MVP (2007). Another member of the Spurs’ Big Three alongside Ginobili and Duncan, the French star had unmatched court vision that allowed him to work as the hinge of the team. He was known for his floater, his pump fakes, and his speed. He played for the Spurs between 2001 and 2018 before ending his career with the Hornets in 2019. The 4-time NBA champion averaged 15,5 points and 5,6 assists, and he had his jersey retired in 2019 at AT&T Center."
