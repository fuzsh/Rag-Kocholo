        "text": "When it comes to disaster films, 1972’s “The Poseidon Adventure” had all the right ingredients: A stong script, excellent visuals, and a solid cast from top to bottom. It’s no wonder “The Poseidon Adventure” is considered a classic by many. Then we have the 2006 remake “Poseidon,” which lacked most of the original’s ingredients.\n\n“Poseidon” faithfully follows the formula for a disaster movie: 1) Feature a lot of characters; most of which will die. 2) Introduce the main character briefly, so we get to know them throughout the film. 3) Create at least one character we can all hate and one character we like. 4) Make the struggle to survive the centerpiece of the film. 5) Kill hundred of extras for shock value.\n\nJust like in the 1972 film, an ocean liner is overturned by a “rogue wave” that leaves it floating upside down. The ship’s captain (Andre Braugher) assures the passengers, who were just celebrating New Year’s Eve, that they will be safe in the ship’s ballroom. This despite the fact the ballroom is made mostly out of glass. Yet, no one stops to wonder how much pressure the glass can withstand.\n\nOh, and for some random reason, the evening’s entertainment is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nDeciding the Skipper is full of crap, a few daring souls decide to save themselves by escaping up. The brave include the heroic Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), the former Mayor of New York, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), her fiance Christian (Mike Vogel).\n\nThe guy we’re supposed to hate is the obnoxious Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon). Also along for the rise is the rich but suicidal Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), a mother (Jacinda Barrett) and her son Conor (Jimmy Bennett) and a stowaway (Mia Maestro).\n\nFun fact: The Latin guy who sneaked her on the ship is subsequently crushed while trying to escape in an elevator shaft because, as we all know, it just doesn’t pay to be a minority in these films.\n\nAside from Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, the rest of the cast is mostly forgettable. The one thing I do remember clearly is wishing Kevin Dillon’s character would suffer a horrible death. Which he did, and the entire theatre erupted into cheers.\n\nAs the audience, we should care if these people live or die. But we don’t, because none of the characters are well developed in my opinion. Sure, we know something about each one, but there’s no emotional attachment to any of them.\n\nThe truth is that the only character that is well-developed in this movie is the ship itself. If you had any doubts where the film’s $160 million budget went, just look at the sets.\n\nThe movie has a running time of 98 minutes, so there’s very little time to take everything in. Events move so fast that I wondered if this was supposed to take place in real-time. The pacing is bad enough, but “Poseidon”also asks that you believe some clichéd stuff. For example:\n\nMike Vogel gets his leg trapped under something which himself and two others cannot lift. It takes another person to free his leg just enough so he can slide it out. Fortunately, this is a movie, and Vogel is left with a nothing but a minor cut.\n\nLater a man manages to swim in boiling water, and others run through some flames without getting get burned or catching fire. The entire cast is able to swim really well underwater, and they can all hold their breath for substantial periods of time despite being out of breath just before going underwater.\n\nBut that’s not all…\n\nA woman and her child get swept away and slammed against the wall by the water, but they survive unhurt. Only one person decides to see if the woman and the kid are okay. And boy aren’t they lucky there is a life raft conveniently placed right next to where the survivors exit the ship?\n\nTo top it all off, the Poseidon sinks, just as two helicopters conveniently turn up to save the survivors. As the film wraps up, some ‘uplifting’ music plays and we’re supposed to be happy that only 6 of the many thousands on that cruise ship survived."
