        "text": "Poseidon/Poseidon 666\n\nIntro[]\n\n''Poseidon'' is a 2006 Action/Adventure movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen. It's based on the 1969 novel ''The Poseidon Adventure'' by Paul Gallico.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe Poseidon, a huge cruise ship on its way from Southampton to New York during the new year eve, capsizes after being struck by a rogue wave. Before sinking, a small group of survivors guided by an ex-marshal decides to reach the bottom of the ship and get rescued.\n\nPoseidon 666[]\n\nPoseidon 666 (also known as Poseidon Rises and Poseidon 2) is a 2016 American supernatural horror film directed by Nick Lyon and produced by The Asylum. It is a sequel to Poseidon (2010) and stars Jamie Bamber and Keesha Sharp. It was released on Paramount Pictures on the United States on 2016, on the 45th anniversary of the sinking of the Poseidon. The film received generally unfavorable reviews, and users on social media noted the film's similarity to Poseidon (2006) and Trial 666 (2016).\n\nPlot (Poseidon 666)[]\n\nForty five years after the sinking of the original, the second Poseidon, Poseidon II, begins its maiden voyage to the original wreck site when strange things begin to occur after the ship's arrival. The passengers start turning into ghosts, and as a result, the ship sinks."
