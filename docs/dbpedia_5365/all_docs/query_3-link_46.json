        "text": "Updated on 25/12/2020\n\nBeing one of the few texts that was added to the text list this year, Euripidesâ play Women of Troy is definitely a daunting task for English and EAL students to tackle due to the lack of resources and essay prompts available. In fact, the only materials that can be found on the internet are those analysing the older translation of the play (titled The Trojan Women). That is why we are here to help you as much as we can by offering you a mini-guide for Women of Troy, in the hope that you can get a head start with this play.\n\nWomen of Troy is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nContents\n\nSummary\n\nHistorical Context\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nThemes\n\nCharacters\n\nLSG-Curated Essay Topics\n\nA+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nExtra Resources\n\n1. Summary\n\nWomen of Troy is a tragedy which takes place in the immediate aftermath of the Trojan war, critiquing the atrocities committed by the Greeks to both people of Melos and Troy. By constructing a play in which women are able to dominate the stage and exude their genuine despair in response to their impending enslavement, Euripides shifts the perspectives from epic tales of Greek and Trojan male heroes to the conversely affected women who suffered at the hands of the heroes, while simultaneously providing both the contemporary and modern audience with a unique insight into the true cost of war. This is especially significant because the society was pervaded by patriarchal values, where women were subordinated to their male counterparts. Euripidesâ proto-feminist works were not well received by his peers at the time of writing as womenâs personal thoughts and pain were not commonly discussed in the Hellenic repertoire.\n\n2. Historical Context\n\nThe Trojan war occurred as a result of the conflict between Greece and Troy and was said to last for over 10 years. According to a tale, during a festival on the Olympus, Athena, Aphrodite and Hera were fighting over a golden apple. They chose a random mortal, which was Paris who would then be the Prince of Troy, to decide who the most beautiful goddess of the three was. As a reward for picking her, Aphrodite promised Paris that he would be married to the most beautiful woman in the world, which was Helen â wife of Menelaus, the Spartan prince. Aphrodite had her son Eros (a cupid) enchant Helen and Paris so that they would fall endlessly in love with each other. Helen then escaped from Menelausâ palace to be with Paris, starting the war between Greece and Troy. Menelaus was enraged and he convinced his brother Agamemnon to lead an expedition to retrieve Helen. The Greek army was commanded to attack the Trojans. The siege lasted for more than 10 years until the Greeks came up with a strategy to abduct Helen from the palace. The Greek soldiers build a giant wooden horse and hid in there to get in the citadel of Troy, attacking them in the middle of the night and winning the war. After the war, the Greek heroes slowly made their way home, however, the journey home was not easy. Odysseus took 10 years to make the arduous journey home to Ithaca because Poseidon agreed to punish the Greeks for the atrocities committed before and after their victory.\n\n3. Themes\n\nWar\n\nLove and Lust\n\nEuripidesâ works often warn the audience of the detrimental effects brought on by excessive passion, asserting that it is best to moderate emotions and exhibit sophrosyne (the power of self-control over oneâs emotions). He often criticises the goddess of love, Aphrodite, for enchanting mortals and leading them into a life governed by love and lust. In this play, he purports that it is inherently Aphroditeâs fault that the Trojans are fighting against the Greeks, as it is Aphrodite who makes Paris and Helen endlessly fall in love with each other.\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nIn Women of Troy, Euripides presents a particularly acerbic critique on Menelausâ 'uncontrollable lust' in 'sen[ding] a hunting party to track down Helen' as he juxtaposes the cost of the Trojan war being and the prize that they receive.\n\n'tens of thousands dead' Â\n\n'giving up the pleasure of his family and children'\n\n'these Greeks [beginning] to die'\n\nâ All that in exchange for one woman - Helen\n\nHis chastisement is further bolstered by Cassandraâs rhetorical question asking 'they kept on dying, for what reason'. This manoeuvres the audience into acknowledging the pointlessness of the Trojan war as it is not worth risking so many lives over Helen or any minor military conflict. In doing so, Euripides once again lambastes the actions of those vindictive and bloodthirsty Greeks.\n\nCost of War\n\nThe play primarily focuses on the loss and pain of the Trojan civilians that survived the war, are sieged in the city after the war and are eventually either killed or enslaved after the fall of Troy. While the Trojan war is the setting of many famous classical works being examined by various different angles, not many focus on the consequences suffered by women. This enables Euripides to raise the question of whether or not such victory is worth fighting for while simultaneously inviting the audience to emulate the playwrightâs disapprobation of such a violent and brutal resolution of conflict.\n\nYou can also use the evidence from the above to justify your arguments on the cost of war. They all aim to magnify the extent to which the Trojan people, as well as the Greeks, have to suffer as result of this pointless war.\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nWe can also discuss how wars affect beliefs and their peopleâs faith. In the Hellenic society, gods have always been a significant part of their life as it is believed that mortalsâ lives are always under the influence of divine intervention. This is evidenced through the ways in which Hellenic people build temples and make sacrifices to the gods, thanking the gods for allowing them to live prosperous lives and begging for their forgiveness whenever they wrong others. This is why it is significant when Hecuba referred to the gods as 'betrayers' in her lamentation, implying that there is a change in attitude in time of tragedy. Events such as this make people question their fate and belief, galvanising them to wonder 'what good [gods] were to [them].\n\nIntegrity and Sense of Duty\n\nSome characters in Women of Troy are also fundamentally driven by their sense of duty and integrity, and act according to their moral code regardless of what the circumstances may be. Hecuba, for instance, sympathises with the Chorus of Troy and acts as a leader even when she loses her title and her home. She is held responsible for her actions but is still governed by her honesty and integrity as Helen makes her plea. Talthybius is also governed by both his sense of duty and integrity. Despite his understanding of Hecubaâs circumstances, he still follows his order and ensures that the Trojan women are allocated to their Greek households. However, he does not disregard her sense of morality and treats Hecuba with understanding and sensitivity.\n\nHelen, on the other hand, does not demonstrate the same degree of moral uprightness. In time of tragedy, she chooses to lie and shift the blame to others to escape her execution. She prioritises her own benefits over everyone elseâs and allows thousands of others to suffer from the impacts of her treachery in eloping with Paris.\n\nGod/Fate\n\nThe prologue of the play opens with a conversation between Poseidon and Athena, foreshadowing their divine retribution against the Greeks. Witnessing the immediate aftermath of the Trojan war, they curse the war which they ironically themselves initiated, thus condemning the horrific injustice of the conflict and the actions of its vengeful and blood thirsty so-called heroes. This is evidenced through the ways in which they punished Odysseus by creating obstacles on his journey home.\n\nHowever, it can also be argued that the gods in Women of Troy themselves act as a symbol of injustice in a way. From the feminist view, the fall of Troy and the enslavement of Trojan women demonstrate the godsâ lack of care as they disregard the monstrosities that occur to women after the Greeksâ victory. The divine intervention which is promised in the beginning casts the following injustices cursed upon the women of Troy in a different light as it can be argued that the gods caused the war. While their retribution against the Greeks can be seen as a means to punish the heroes, it is evident that that they are more concerned about the sacrilege committed and the disrespect they receive after the Trojan war than the injustices suffered by women. This thereby humanises the gods and fortifies the notion that they also have personal flaws and are governed by their ego and hubris.\n\nThe idea that there are forces beyond human control is enhanced, and Poseidon and Athenaâs pride proves that humans are just innocent bystanders at the mercy of the gods. It can be argued that the chain of unfortunate events are unpredictable as they are determined by gods, whose emotions and prejudices still control the way they act. On the other hand, the characters in the play do at times make choices that would lead to their downfall and tragic consequences. For instance, it is Menelaus who decided to go after the Trojans just because of one woman and he was not enchanted or under any influence of divine intervention.\n\nGender Roles\n\nEuripides centres his play on Trojan women, enabling the discussion on the cause and effect of war. Given that females' points of view were not commonly expressed in plays or any forms of art works, Euripidesâ decision to have his play focus on women allows the Athenian audience, comprised of mainly male Athenians, to observe a part of the military conflict that was not seen before.\n\nThe protagonist Hecuba, for example, is portrayed as the archetypal mother. While this image is presented during the aftermath of the Trojan war, Euripides also uses Hecuba as a representative of contemporary Hellenic women as this archetype is universal for all circumstances. It is evident that Euripidesâ play mainly focuses on Hecubaâs grief, with her lamentation dominating the prologue. This implies that the protagonist, in this instance, also acts as a diatribe against the patriarchal society which allows women to suffer greatly as a result of war and military conflict. However, this play differs from other plays written by Euripides in that he also explores a womanâs burden and responsibility as a leader, allowing the audience to understand the difficulties of being a woman of power in time of crisis.\n\n4. Characters\n\nHecuba\n\nMother of Troy\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nIn employing the simile comparing herself to 'a mother bird at her plundered nest', Hecuba reminds the audience of her endless love for the city of Troy, implying that the devastation of her own home also further deepens her pain. In this scene, Hecuba is portrayed as a female leader who rules with her passion and love. Â\n\nThe image her (Hecuba) as an empathetic Queen is also exemplified through the ways in which she 'weep[s] for [her] burning home'. As the term 'home' invokes connotations of warmth and affection, Hecubaâs endearment for the city she governs is established, accentuating the portrayal of Hecuba as a leader with a passion for her duties.\n\nThis in turn propels the audience to be more inclined to feel commiseration for her when she is held responsible for her cityâs destruction. As the representative of Troyâs leadership that enables such brutality to occur leading to the wars, Hecuba bears the guilt and responsibility for '[giving] birth to all the trouble by giving birth to Paris' and consequently, for the cataclysmic consequences that ramified from Parisâ involvement with Helen (although she is simply an innocent bystander) â Social accountability for war\n\nMother of Her Children\n\nPotential Textual Evidence:\n\nFrom the outset of the play, the former queen of Troy is portrayed as a miserable mother suffering from the loss of her own children and 'howl[ing] for her children dead' (echoed by the Chorus, referred to as 'howl of agony'). By employing animalistic language in describing Hecubaâs act of mourning over Hectorâs death, Euripides intensifies the magnitude of her emotional turmoil as it is likened to a loud and doleful cry usually uttered by animals â It is almost not humanly possible to endure so much pain.\n\nThis notion is bolstered by the image of Hecuba drowning in 'her threnody of tears' as it engages the pathos of the audience, establishing her as a victim of war and emphasising the poignant story that is to be unveiled.\n\nThe simile comparing herself to a woman 'dragged as a slave' in her lamentation further fortifies Hecubaâs portrayal as a victim of a play. Here, the juxtaposition between her former title 'by birth [as] Troyâs...Queen' and her current state magnifies the drastic change in life and the loss she suffered, compelling the audience to better sympathise with Hecuba. â Powers can be ephemeral in times of crisis.\n\nTalthybius\n\nTalthybius is sympathetic towards women, establishing himself as a complicated figure with a strong sense of integrity. This is epitomised through the ways in which he employs euphemistic language when announcing the dreadful news to Hecuba. He tries his best to be sensitive and mitigate the impacts of Hecubaâs daughter death to her, announcing that Polyxena 'is to serve Achilles at his tomb' and that 'her fate is settled', 'all her troubles are over'. He was being sensitive and subtle instead of abruptly delivering the news. While he represents an enemy state, he shows that men can also be compassionate, contradicting the Phallocentric belief that men should only be governed by cool logic.\n\nChorus of Trojan Women\n\nIt can be argued that Hecuba acts as the paradigm of the Trojan women as her pain (i.e. the deaths of her children, slavery, the devastation of her city), in a way, represents the suffering of the majority of Hellenic women in times of war, which enhances Euripidesâ condemnation of a society where military conflicts can easily be facilitated. The Chorus of the play often echoes her deepest pain, establishing a sense of camaraderie between female characters of the play.\n\nIn this play, the Chorus acts as the voice of the 'wretched women of Troy', representing the views of the unspoken who are objectified and mistreated by their male counterparts. After Troy lost the war, women were seen as conquests and were traded as slaves, exposing the unfair ethos of a society that was seen as the cradle of civilisation. By allowing the Trojan women to express their indignation and enmity as a response to their impending slavery, Euripides is able to present a critique on the ways in which women were oppressed in Ancient Greece.\n\n5. Literary Devices\n\nSimile (e.g. dragged as a slave)\n\nEuphemism (e.g. serve Achilles at his tomb â euphemism for death)\n\nSymbolism (e.g. Hectorâs shield or Troyâs citadel)\n\nAnimal imagery (e.g. howl of agony)\n\nRhetorical question (e.g. for what reason)\n\nWhy are these important? Watch how we integrated literary devices as pieces of evidence in this essay topic breakdown:\n\n[Modified Video Transcription]\n\nTIP: See section '7. A+ Essay Topic Breakdown' (below) for an explanation of our ABC approach so that you understand how we've actually tackled this essay prompt.\n\nStaged in a patriarchal society, Women of Troy was set during the immediate aftermath of the Trojan war â a war between the Greeks and the Trojans. Hecuba is the former queen of Troy, who suffered so much loss as the mother of her children as well as the mother of Troy. She lost her son Hector and her husband in the Trojan war, her daughter Polyxena also died and Cassandra was raped. After the Greeks won, women were allocated to Greek households and forced into slavery, including the queen of Troy. Â She was also the mother of Paris, the prince of Troy. It was purported that Paris and Helen were responsible for initiating the war as Helen was governed by her lust for Paris and left Menelaus, the Spartan prince, for this young prince of Troy. Consequently, Menelaus was enraged by this elopement and declared that he wanted Helen dead as a punishment for her disloyalty. Helen defended herself and lied that it was against her will, crying that she was kidnapped and blamed Hecuba for the fall of Troy and for the conflict between the two sides. However, Menelaus did not believe what Helen had to say and decided to bring her back to her home on a separate ship.\n\nThe play ended with the Greek ships leaving Troy, which was then on fire. The Trojan were singing a sad song together as they left to prepare for their new lives as slaves living in Greek households.\n\nThe playâs main focus is on the suffering of women, as exemplified by the way Euripides chose to portray Hecubaâs loss and Cassandraâs helplessness.\n\nSo, our essay prompt for today is\n\n'How does Euripides use the structure of the play to explore the role of women and their suffering in time of war?'\n\nThis is indeed one of the more challenging prompts that VCAA wouldnât probably give, the reason being that it is a language/structure-based prompt. It requires you to have a much more profound knowledge of the text, and it is not always easy to spot language features, especially in a poetic sounding play like Women of Troy. There is just so much going on in the text! While it is not super likely that you will get this prompt for the exam, I have seen a lot of schools give language/structure-based prompts to students for SACs as it gives them an opportunity to challenge themselves and look for textual evidence that will distinguish them from their peers. These types of evidence are definitely worth looking for because they can also be used as evidence to back up your arguments for theme-based or character-based prompts (learn more about the different types of prompts in How To Write A Killer Text Response).\n\nNow letâs get started.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe first thing I always do is to look for keywords. The key words in this prompt are 'structure, 'role of women' and 'suffering'.\n\nWith the structure of the play, we can potentially talk about:\n\nCharacter-related evidence (e.g. strong female character base)\n\nLanguage-related features (metalanguage/literacy devices)\n\nPlot-related features (order of events) â irony, foreshadowing\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nIn a male-dominated, patriarchal society, women are oftentimes oppressed and seen as inferior. Their roles in the society were limited, they were only seen as domestic housewives and mothers. It is important to look for evidence that either supports or contradicts this statement. Ask yourself:\n\nIs Euripides trying to support the statement and agree that women are simply creatures of emotions who should only stick with domestic duties?\n\nOr is he trying to criticise this belief by showing that women are so much more than just those being governed by their emotions?\n\nSince this play primarily focuses on the cost of war and how women, as innocent bystanders, have to suffer as a result of the Trojan war, it should not be difficult finding evidence related to womenâs suffering. It might include:\n\nHecubaâs loss (she lost her home and children)\n\nHecubaâs pain (being blamed for Troyâs ruin)\n\nCassandraâs helplessness despite knowing her fate, surrendering and accepting her future\n\nAndromacheâs 'bitter' fate having to give up her child\n\nThe Chorus voicing their opinion â slavery\n\nOnce a prompt is carefully broken down, it is no longer that scary because all we have to do now is organise our thoughts and write our topic sentences.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nP1: Euripides constructs a strong female character base to contradict the prevailing views of the period that women are inferior to their male counterparts.\n\nIt is significant that Euripides chose to have a strong female protagonist, as the character herself acts as a diatribe against the patriarchal society, contradicting any engrained beliefs that pervaded the society at the time. An example of evidence that can support this statement is the way in which Hecuba dominates the stage while giving her opening lamentation. The lengthy nature of the monologue itself enables Euripides to present his proto-feminist ideas and go against the Hellenic gendered prejudice.\n\nWe can also talk about Hecubaâs leadership and her interaction with the Chorus of Trojan women. She refers to them as 'my children' and employs the simile 'a mother at her plundered nest'. The way the Greek playwright constructs the relationship between characters is worth mentioning as Hecuba in this play is portrayed as a compassionate and empathetic leader, showing that women are also capable of leading others in a way that engenders a sense of camaraderie between them.\n\nAnother good thinking point is to talk about how Helen acts as a paradigm of a group of women who had to turn to deception and go against their integrity to survive in time of tragedy.\n\nP2: Euripidesâ selective use of language and literacy devices in portraying womenâs pain and suffering further enables him to portray the ways in which women, as innocent bystanders, are oppressed in time of war.\n\nAn example of a metalanguage used in this play is the animal imagery the Chorus used to depict Hecubaâs pain. By referring to her pain as a 'howl of agony', they intensify the magnitude of Hecubaâs pain as the term 'howl' is usually used to describe a loud cry usually uttered by animals like wolves. This implies that Hecuba, who acts as representative of Hellenic women, has to suffer from an emotional turmoil that is far beyond bearable, which in turn further fortifies the audienceâs sympathy for her, as well as the Trojan women.\n\nAnother piece of evidence that I would talk about is the simile 'dragged as a slave'. It was used to describe Hecuba, the former queen of Troy. By likening someone who used to be at a position of power to 'a slave', Euripides underscores the drastic change in circumstances that occurred as a result of the Trojan war, magnifying the tremendous amount of loss Hecuba experienced. Furthermore, the image of the protagonistâs devastated physical state enhances the dramatistâs condemnation of war as it allows him to elucidate the detrimental impacts such violence and dreadfulness impose on innocent bystanders.\n\nThere is, of course, plenty of other evidence out there such as the way in which Cassandra is portrayed as a 'poor mad child', her helplessness in surrendering to her 'wretched' fate with Agamemnon who wanted her for himself. We can also talk about the inclusive language positing, 'our misery', 'our home', used by the Chorus in echoing Hecubaâs pain, etc.\n\nThe use of symbolism can also be discussed. For instance, the citadel in the city of Troy in the epilogue acts as a metonym for Hecubaâs resistance before entering slavery. The image of it crumbling exemplifies womenâs helplessness and enhances the notion that they are still in positions of explicit subjugation.\n\nP3: While Euripides primarily focuses on portraying womenâs pain and suffering, he does not completely vilify men or victimise women, maintaining an unbiased view so as to underscore the importance of integrity through his characterisation of both male and female character.\n\nThe last body paragraph of our essays is often the one used to challenge the prompt, showing the assessors our wealth of ideas and depth of knowledge. Basically, what we are saying is 'while our playwright is obviously pro-women, he definitely does not condone everything women do and criticise everything men do'. Â In this way, we have the opportunity to explore the ways characters are constructed and the ways they are used in the play to convey its meaning.\n\nIf I were to write an essay on this, I would talk about Talthybius and Helen, mainly because they are both complex characters that the audience cannot fully love or hate.\n\nTalthybius is surprisingly sympathetic towards women, establishing himself as a complicated figure. This is epitomised by the ways in which he employs euphemistic language when announcing the dreadful news to Hecuba. He tries his best to be sensitive and mitigate the impacts of Hecubaâs daughter's death to her, announcing that Polyxena 'is to serve Achilles at his tomb', that 'her fate is settled' and 'all her troubles are over'. He was being sensitive and subtle instead of abruptly delivering the news. While he represents an enemy state, he shows that men can also be compassionate, contradicting the Phallocentric belief that men should only be governed by cool logic.\n\nSimilar to Talthybius, Helen is also a complicated figure as she is both a victim of fate and a selfish character. It is possible for the audience to sympathise with her as she is merely a victim of fortune in that she was bewitched by Aphrodite and governed by her love for Paris, the prince of Troy. However, the ways in which she shifts the blame to Hecuba and makes her pleas preclude the audience from completely sympathising with her they, in a way, render her as a self-absorbed and repugnant character. This notion is further fortified by the fact that she cared so little for the 'tens of thousands' lives taken on her behalf as the phrase quantifies and magnifies the cataclysmic consequences of her lust for Paris.\n\n6.

A+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nQuote-Based Prompt:\n\n'Who can forget these sufferings? Time will bring no relief.' There is no villain in Women of Troy because everyone in the play suffers. Do you agree with the statement?\n\nThe following comes essay topic breakdown comes from our A Killer Text Guide: Women of Troy ebook:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe quote mentions long-lasting sufferings, and the prompt seems to ask who suffers, and who is responsible. If youâve been reading this guide in order, a lot of similar ideas from the last four essays might jump out here - I think thatâs okay, because ideally you do get to a point where you can ârecycleâ some of your quotes and ideas between essays (and the examiner wonât have to read all your practice essays anyway!).\n\nWhile Iâll be doing a little bit of recycling here, I want the main take-away point from this essay to be around framing. Even if youâre using similar ideas that youâve already seen, the trick is to explain and frame your analysis in a way that answers every prompt specifically. This is best done through how you thread your arguments together, and how you make those links. Weâll get into this as we plan.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nFor now, letâs recap these ideas of suffering and responsibility. Hecuba and the Trojan women suffer, and they argue Helen is responsible - but Helen also suffers, and she argues that the gods are responsible. The gods, as we know, are insulated from suffering because of their divine and superhuman status. So, are they the villains?\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nThis is a similar progression of ideas that we have seen before, but I want to ground them in this cycle of suffering-responsibility.\n\nP1: The eponymous women of Troy certainly suffer, and in many of their eyes, Helen is a villain.\n\nP2: However, Helen does not see herself that way - and she is not incorrect. She too seems to suffer, and she sees the gods as the main villains who are responsible.\n\nP3: Euripides may see the gods as careless and negligent beings, but he doesnât necessarily depict them as cruel; rather, the excessively passionate war itself is depicted as the true enemy, and villains are those who revel in its cruelty.\n\nAs you might notice, parts of this plan are recognisable: weâve started a few of these essays with a first paragraph about the Trojan womenâs suffering, developed that in paragraph two by contrasting with Helen, and ending our analysis with the gods. But when reusing some of those ideas, itâs important to make sure they answer the specific question by modifying and adding new ideas as needed - this way, you donât rewrite essays for new prompts and risk losing relevance, but you do reuse ideas and tailor them to new prompts every time.\n\nThe contention for this one will be: the Trojan War undoubtedly has its winners and losers, and few of these characters agree on who the responsible villains are, with some blaming Helen (P1) while she herself blames the gods (P2). However, the gods only form a part of the picture - rather, Euripides depicts war itself as the villain, lambasting those who take pride in inflicting cruelty in the midst of war (P3).\n\nIf you'd like to see an A+ essay on the essay topic above check out our A Killer Text Guide: Women of Troy ebook.\n\n8.
