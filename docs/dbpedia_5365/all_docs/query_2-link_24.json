        "text": "I am not pregnant anymore but just trying to get the baby name buzz back in my system. I am trying to add some new fresh names to my boys list since my girls list is getting quite large. I have been liking mythological names lately. I have a few on my list but came across Poseidon nn Cy or Poe. [name_m]Just[/name_m] wanted your thoughts on it! I know to some it may be a lot of name for a child or adult but I like it. This will be my first name post since losing our baby so dont be too harsh!\n\nWDTY of these combos?\n\nPoseidon William\n\nPoseidon John (my bfs name, his fathers name and my fathers middle name)\n\nPoseidon Leo ( my grandfathers name)\n\nOther combos are welcome\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nI think it is one of the more out there Greek baby names I have to admit! Boys names after Gods are often like this though. I do like wacky names though so I am really on board with it, especially with the classic middle! If you can think of a cute nn then it is definitely a good consideration X\n\nMy friend’s husband actually loves that name for a boy, and had they had a boy, they more than likely would have went with it. Instead, they had a [name_f]Pandora[/name_f] nn [name_u]Dory[/name_u]. :] I don’t think it’s awful, but I agree with the AP that it is one of the more “out there” ones.\n\nSome other ideas:\n\nAres\n\n[name_m]Zeus[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Perseus[/name_m] nn [name_u]Percy[/name_u] <3\n\nOrion\n\nAvalon\n\nOdin\n\nRaiden\n\nOsiris\n\n@escg33k- I love how they chose [name_f]Pandora[/name_f] for a girl! I have that name on my girls list as well. I agree it is more out there but I like the way it sounds and if we find a nickname that could work that would be good or I want to have a down to earth middle name in case he would want to use that instead. Like how The Rancic’s use [name_m]Duke[/name_m] for their sons name but his real name is [name_m]Edward[/name_m].\n\nI love the names you suggested! I hate how our last name ruins a lot of good names. We can never use names ending in S or X. They dont flow correctly into our last name. I have [name_m]Odin[/name_m] on my list already, [name_m]Raiden[/name_m] isnt bad either. I love [name_m]Perseus[/name_m], [name_m]Zeus[/name_m], Ares and even [name_m]Osiris[/name_m]. I wish we could use them.\n\n[name_m]Poseidon[/name_m] is wonderful. It’s very powerful, but it’s magical and one of those names that draws you in. Would you consider elaborating the [name_m]Leo[/name_m]-combo a little? I think [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m]'s so over the top mighty and masculine, I’d like some more fun in the middle. [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m] [name_m]Leopold[/name_m] or [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m] Leofric would be pretty cute methinks!\n\nThere’s also Hyperion, Triton, Chiron, [name_m]Endymion[/name_m], Ganymede, Palaemon.\n\nAnd the [name_m]Roman[/name_m] Gods, [name_u]Neptune[/name_u], [name_m]Jupiter[/name_m], [name_m]Mars[/name_m], [name_u]Mercury[/name_u] (always loved this one!) and [name_m]Auster[/name_m].\n\nOh I love your descriptions of names [name_m]Ott[/name_m]! I completely agree with you, at first I questioned it but I honestly have become fond of it. It’s just such a unique and like you said powerful. You always suggest the most interesting names. I never thought about expanding on on [name_m]Leo[/name_m]. I do like [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m] [name_m]Leopold[/name_m] and I have never heard of Leofric. [name_m]How[/name_m] do you pronounce that?\n\nI do like how suggested Triton that is a neat one that stood out to me and I like the way it sounds with my last name. I also like [name_m]Mars[/name_m], [name_u]Neptune[/name_u] and [name_u]Mercury[/name_u]! So magical and awesome.\n\n[name_m]Poseidon[/name_m] isn’t my style, but I admit I like the vibe and it would be cool to meet a [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m]! I am really crushing on [name_m]Leo[/name_m] [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m] right now to be honest!\n\nIt’s too bad -s doesn’t work because Ares, [name_m]Achilles[/name_m], and others are so great!\n\nI’m not great at suggesting mythological names, but [name_m]Apollo[/name_m] is one of my guilty pleasures. [name_m]Ajax[/name_m] (I imagine an x ending is also not a good fit?), [name_m]Jove[/name_m], [name_u]Mercury[/name_u], [name_u]Neptune[/name_u], and [name_u]Orion[/name_u] are also pretty cool too.\n\n@[name_m]Ott[/name_m]- I am right there with you! I also blame my bf/future husband for having a terrible last name hahah I love him dont get me wrong but that darn last name ruins greatness! Are these suggestions for first names or middles? Because I see a lot I like as middles for [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m] and first names without using [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m]. Okay I was saying it wrong haha but now I see the correct pronunciation I like it much more!\n\nNames I like with [name_m]Poseidon[/name_m]:\n\n[name_m]Altair[/name_m]- I love [name_m]Altair[/name_m] with out a doubt\n\n[name_m]Evander[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Hector[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Lysander[/name_m]\n\n[name_m]Perion[/name_m]- I know the double P but this is amazing to my ears atleast.\n\n[name_m]Silvan[/name_m]- this sounds so regal together\n\n[name_m]Vulcan[/name_m]- this keeps the powerful and cool vibe going\n\nIxion\n\nI honestly didn’t realize you can have fun in the middle spot with this name, I thought it would have to almost be classic in the middle but these are way better!"
