        "text": "2. The Ondine legend in the arts\n\nThe name Ondine, also known as Undine, Undin or Undina, derives from the Latin word “unda” (wave), and it was used to nominate a category of supernatural females including nymphs, limnads, nereids, naiades and mermaids, associated with the classical element water [7]. Although the classical 15 books Metamorphoses by Ovid (Publius Ovidius Naso, 43 BCE-17/18 CE) already described creatures similar to nymphs [7], the man behind the term “ondine” seems to be Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), better known as Paracelsus [8]. In his alchemical writings, he stated that each of the four classical elements was inhabited by invisible, spiritual counterparts of Nature, thus the elemental being associated with water was named undine [2].\n\nOndines have origin in Greek mythologic figures known as Nereids, attendants of the sea god Poseidon [2]. Paracelsus first mentioned Ondine in his writings after he found the story in the German poem Der Ritter von Staufenberg (1480), and in 16th century a nymph named Ondine was also cited in the poem Hylas, written by Pierre de Ronsard (1524–1585) [2]. However, the main author associated with the popular fairytale “Undine” is Friedrich Heinrich Karl, the German Baron de la Motte-Fouqué (1777–1843), who in 1811 wrote the novella Undine [9]. It probably exerted an influence on Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875), who wrote in 1836 the adaptation The Little Mermaid [10]. In 1842, Aloysius Bertrand (1807–1841) introduced the prose poem in French literature, publishing a collection entitled Gaspard de la Nuit, including a poem called Ondine [11]. In 1908, Maurice Ravel (1875–1937) composed a “hard to play” piano suite named Gaspard de la Nuit, which first movement was also called Ondine [12].\n\nThe play Pelléas et Mélisande, written in 1892 by Maurice Maeterlinck, was in part based on the Ondine myth (1862–1949) [13], and it was adapted to the opera in 1902 by Claude Debussy (1862–1918) [14]. Likewise, contemporary composers were stimulated by that play, as the symphonic poem Pelléas et Mélisande (1903) by Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) [15], the Opus 46 (1905) by Jean Sibelius (1865–1957) [16], and the incidental music Opus 80 (1912) by Gabriel Urbain Fauré (1845–1924) [17]. Other operas associated to the myth include the librettos Ondine (1816), by E.T.A. Hoffmann (1776–1822) [18]; Undine (1845), by Albert Lortzing (1801–1851) [19]; and Undina (1869), written by Vladimir Sollogub (1813–1882) [20] to the opera by Pyotr Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) [21]. More recently, Yukie Nishimura (1967-) also composed a piano piece called Undine in 1988 [22].\n\nBallet choreographies related to the myth include Les Sylphides (1909), produced by Michel Fokine (1880–1942) [23]; and Ondine (1958) by Sir Frederick Ashton (1904–1988) [24] performed by Margot Fonteyn (1919–1991) [25].\n\nIn 1939, Jean Giraudoux's (1882–1944) play Ondine introduced to the public the concept of loss of automaticity of all functions, including breathing, moving, seeing and hearing, as Ondine's curse: “Since you went away, I've had to force my body to do things it should do automatically. I no longer see unless I order my eyes to see (…) I have five senses, thirty muscles, even my bones to command; it's an exhausting stewardship. If I relax my vigilance for one moment, I may forget to hear or to breathe” [26]. Ondine's husband probably died because he renounced to breathe [2]. Although in an excellent review of the ancient stories Nannapaneni et al. [2], found no versions in which Ondine cursed her husband, the later writers freely developed the water nymph fairytale. In one of these versions, Ondine was a beautiful nymph blessed with immortality and eternal youth; however, she could lose her gifts if she gave birth to a human child. When she felt in love with a man, he swore to her: “My every waking breath shall be my pledge of love and faithfulness to you!” That choice of words would become fateful; they happily married and had a baby, thus she became human, grew old and lost her beauty. One day, she caught her husband sleeping with another woman; she woke him up and cried: “You pledged faithfulness to me with your every waking breath, and I accepted that pledge; so be it; for as long as you are awake, you shall breathe, but should you ever fall asleep, your breathing shall cease.” [27].\n\nThe Ondine's legend continued to live in arts, through sculptures such as Undine Rising from the Waters (1880) by Chauncey Bradley Ives (1810–1894) [ ] [28], and the Undine (1930) by Giuseppe Renda (1800–1899) [29]. There is also a huge collection of paintings including Ondine (1843) by Jacques-Laurent Agasse (1767–1849) [30]; Undine (1872) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896) [ ] by John William Waterhouse (1849–1917) [31]; In the Waves (Ondine) (1889) by Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) [ ] [32]; Ondine (Silver Fish) (1899) by Gustav Klimt (1862–1918) [33]; and Undine at the Window (1915) by Arthur Rackham (1867–1939) [ ] [34].\n\nSeveral movies were produced inspired by the myth. Andy Warhol (1928–1987) directed the film The Loves of Ondine (1967) [35], and the animated motion picture by Walt Disney Productions The Little Mermaid also popularized the legend in 1989 [2]. It became a Broadway's stage musical, produced by Disney Theatrical and nominated to Grammy award in 2007, with music by Alan Menken (1949-) [36]. One of the stories from anthology film Shake, Rattle & Roll III (1991) featured a lake creature named Undin [37], and the Irish movie Ondine (2009) told the story of a fisherman that caught a beautiful young woman in his net [38]. The 2013 Polish short documentary film titled “Our Curse”, by Tomasz Sliwinski (1979-), was Oscar-nominated; it recorded the first six months of his son Leo, with CCHS, “fighting against a curse of a cruel goddess Ondine” [39].\n\n3. The Ondine's curse in medicine\n\nSeveringhaus and Mitchell [1] cleverly coined the term Ondine's curse in 1962 to describe a failure of respiratory center automaticity, which is especially important during sleep. Autonomic respiration depends on a feedback mechanism related to the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, as well as the pH of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid [40]. Respiratory control is regulated in two areas situated in medulla and one in pons: (1) the dorsal respiratory group, consisting of inspiratory neurons near the solitary nuclei of the medulla; (2) the ventral respiratory group, a column of inspiratory, expiratory and rhythm-generating neurons extending from the cervical cord C1 to below the facial nuclei; and (3) the para-brachial/Kölliker–Fuse complex (located in dorsolateral upper pons), which controls switching between inspiration and expiration [40,41]. The three groups of neurons are paired bilaterally, however even a unilateral injury may produce several degrees of hypoventilation or apnea [41].\n\nThere are about ∼1000 congenital cases of Ondine syndrome published in medical literature, most of them CCHS due to a chemical disorder of breathing control [3]. It seems to be related to a mutation of the proneural HASH-1 gene, causing impairment of development of noradrenergic neurons [3].\n\nAcquired Ondine syndrome was first reported due to bulbar poliomyelitis [42], being later related to trauma, encephalitis, brainstem infarction and hemorrhage [[4], [5], [6]]. Furthermore, respiratory disturbances (including CSA) were also associated with cavernous malformation, osmotic demyelination syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Leigh syndrome, heterotopia of the inferior olive, mitochondrial and degenerative disease (eg, multisystem atrophy) [4,[43], [44], [45], [46]]. Primary brainstem tumors, particularly gangliogliomas, have also been cited as a cause of Ondine syndrome [[46], [47], [48]]. Postoperative complications resulting in CSA were described after high cervical chordotomy for cancer pain [49], microsurgery for brainstem tumors such as meningioma with clear cells [50], and hemangioblastoma [41]. Likewise, dissecting vertebral artery aneurysm evolved with Ondine syndrome after endovascular treatment [40], while delayed presentation compatible with radionecrosis occurred two years after the resection of a cerebellar hemangioblastoma [51].\n\nSince CCHS can be lethal without adequate treatment, immediate respiratory care is required, including intubation, tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation and intensive monitoring [40]. The pharmacological treatment seems to be ineffective to CSA [4,5], while oxygen supplementation may produce variable results in this population, sometimes increasing hypercapnia and further delaying the diagnosis [43]. CCHS commonly requires lifelong ventilatory support for all patients during sleep, and approximately one-third of patients need continuous assisted respiration when awake [5,52]. Although the literature suggests usefulness of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in some cases [4], full-time ventilatory patients may benefit from diaphragm pacers, an alternative mode of ventilation that affords mobility and a more normal lifestyle [52].\n\nThe association of neurologic illness with sleep disorders is common, and both combined may have huge negative impact on the individual and society [53]."
