        "text": "Roman name : Neptune (Planet named after him)\n\nPoseidon is the brother of Zeus and is the god of the sea, storms, earthquakes, and horses. He is also the protector of seafarers and the guardian of many Greek cities and colonies.\n\nPoseidon was born to the Titan parents Cronus and Rhea, who ruled the world before the Olympian gods. He was swallowed by Cronus along with his siblings, but was freed by Zeus, who became his king and ally. Poseidon helped Zeus in his war against Cronus and the Titans, and became the supreme god of the sea after their victory.\n\nPoseidon then divided the world with his brothers Zeus and Hades, who got the sky and the underworld, respectively. Poseidon married his sister Amphitrite, the goddess of the sea, but he also had many affairs with other goddesses and mortal women. Some of his famous children include Triton, Polyphemus, Orion, Theseus, Pegasus, and Bellerophon.\n\nPoseidon was worshipped as the lord of the sea, who controlled all the waters and aquatic creatures. He was also feared as the earth-shaker, who caused earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions with his trident, which was forged by the Cyclopes. He was also revered as the tamer of horses, who created the first horse and taught humans how to ride them.\n\nPoseidon had many temples and shrines throughout Greece, but his most famous sanctuary was at Sounion, where he was honored. His other cult centers include Corinth, Delphi, Troezen, and Isthmia. His sacred animals were the dolphin, the horse, and the bull. His Roman equivalent was Neptune, who shared many of his attributes and stories.\n\nPoseidon is a majestic god who represents both the beauty and the danger of Greek mythology. He is a symbol of strength, authority, creativity, but also of wrath, rivalry, and violence. He is admired as the master of the sea and the creator of horses, but also dreaded for his destructive and unpredictable actions. He is Poseidon, the god of the sea, storms, earthquakes, and horses in Greek mythology.\n\nPoseidon recommends:\n\nThe Teams of Poseidon\n\nIf Poseidon was a fan of modern sports, he would support:"
