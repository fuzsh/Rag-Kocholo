        "text": "This is a giant, FX-driven retread of The Poseidon Adventure from 1972, about the ocean liner that is hit by a freak wave and completely capsizes, leaving passengers no choice but to clamber up from the ceiling of the wrecked stateroom - the chandelier now a shrunken mound of cracked baubles - up to the exposed hull. It was an unsinkably entertaining film that triggered the 1970s craze for those spectacular disaster movies produced by Irwin Allen, such as The Towering Inferno, Earthquake and The Swarm, which addressed the worrying issue of killer bees. Spielberg's Jaws siphoned off a little of this enthusiasm itself.\n\nBut the new Poseidon, directed by Wolfgang Petersen of Das Boot fame, is too cool to go in for the out-and-out corniness and the multifarious and heartfelt character drama that made those movies so lovable. It also, incidentally, does not feature the ensemble-casting of ageing Hollywood stars that was de rigueur for the 70s disaster movie, with a row of their faces in boxes along the bottom of the poster. Our hero is Josh Lucas, a star who once played bad guys and is now repositioning himself, less plausibly, as an action-romantic lead. He plays the professional gambler in the ship casino, who proves to have a heart of gold by leading a small group of stout-hearted adventurers, including former fireman Kurt Russell, up to safety in the face of pleas from the captain to remain where they are until help arrives.\n\nIn the original film, the ethnic sub-division was Jewish, typified by the gutsy and likable performance from Shelley Winters. Now this group has been replaced by Latinos: Mía Maestro plays the feisty stowaway and Freddy Rodríguez (from Six Feet Under) is the waiter whose plot function is to provide knowledge of the ship's layout. I am sorry to say that Poseidon revives the dishonourable tradition of creating one token black in a notionally important job: ship's captain. There is also a gay man with a single diamond earring, played by Richard Dreyfuss, the one folk-memory link back to the 70s glory days. He has been dumped by his partner and is on the verge of throwing himself overboard when he sees the big wave coming towards him - and changes his mind about suicide. I wanted to see much more of this kind of big, brassy, sentimental flourish.\n\nSo where's the beef? The original Poseidon had a strident, unapologetic message: when disaster strikes, do we strike out for freedom like bold risk-takers and entrepreneurs, or sit back and wait for the authorities to do something? That was a real argument the first time around. Not now. It would slow up the all-important action. Kurt Russell's job is to be over-protective of his daughter, played by the glassy-eyed Emmy Rossum, and there are some very yucky lines in which he disapproves of her burgeoning womanly sexuality. \"Do that top button up!\" he says, taking offence at her décolletage. \"You mean - the twins?\" taunts Emmy. It's the kind of dialogue that leaves no toe uncurled.\n\nThe big set-pieces are impressive, but there are some outrageously unconvincing moments from the hundreds of tuxed extras who must run around panicking. When the big wave first strikes, they do a lot of hammy am-dram bumping into the shattered furniture, almost shouting \"rhubarb, rhubarb!\" at each other. Their faces are eloquent of people who aren't quite up to the job of emoting. It will be a minor treat to rent the DVD, and freeze-frame some of the more choice wooden expressions."
