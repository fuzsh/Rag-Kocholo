        "text": "Regarding this Show --\n\nI make no apologies. The goal was simple: Universal wanted to revise the Posedon show. The #1 goal was to \"make the story understandable\" and #2 was to \"make the show more entertaining..\" At the same time, they wanted the show to have more for kids and families. Okay all would-be attraction designers - what would YOU do? And realize Universal had already done two revisions to the attraction - but they were what I would call band-aid changes. They did what many of you seem to perfer - they tired to keep everything the same and change some lines here and there, add a few more lights. But that doesn't really do anything on a canvas as large as this. You have to think out of the box and really get into something new. Add to the equation that you have to use the existing format, the rooms, the screens, the basic set-up of chamber and effects. You have to tell the story in the walk-through format.\n\nOkay - now lets talk about \"the Keeper\" that many of you are so fond of. Am I missing something? Since when do you like going to professional theme park and seeing 20 and 30 year olds playing a 70 year old looking man, who it turns out is hundreds or thousands of years old, and who ultimately turns out not be a man, but a God? So if he was Zeus all along, why was he taking us into a known trap? And why does he wear a bad beard and wig? And then - for all of you people so sensitive to the reality of the show - did it bother anyone that his LIVE performer transforms into CGI animated character? And as to the content of the show - nothing happened in the first two scenes. Nothing.\n\nSo - Take the goals above and mix with a very small budget, and 12 weeks to do it all, and have at it. I am very proud of the show that we accomplished. That is to say, I and my team, and the Universal technical support team, that did the impossible. The show now has better ratings, and as pointed out by one of you here, the ratings improve as they continue to get the finale effects on line on a more consistent basis.\n\nAs to the choices I made - and yes, I wrote, directed, produced and designed the show -- here are there reasons. It's not some random thing -- it was very purposeful.\n\nTaylor - I wanted a character audiences could indentify with and they they would LIKE.\n\nDarkennon - I wanted a VILLAIN - someone that could be EVIL and that could attack Poseidon.\n\nWhy Poseidon as a HERO? Well for all of you purists - its just not correct that Poseidon was a villain. And Zeus and Poseidon battling for Earth isn't correct either. So - lets get off this notion that the previous show was somehow \"true\" to mythology. It wasn't --\n\nIt was called Poseidon's Fury - and they decided to keep that name, though I had proposed a change - The Haunted Temple of Poseidon. I thought, since the \"fun houses\" at Halloween use walk-through effectively, that there was good parallel in calling this a Haunted Temple. (That would have slightly changed the writing as well...)\n\nAs to the concept and design -- Pre-Show sets up Taylor as your host who TRIES his best to deal with the \"strnage things\" going on --\n\nACT I - establishes the backstory of what has gone before, it then sets up a RIDDLE that holds the key to what lays ahead, and then cleanly sets up the Villain - and all in a way that allows Taylor to react and discover things as he goes. (Compare that to the previous show in there - honestly people, there is no comparison because nothing dramatic happened previously ecxcept that they shined lights on cieling paintings.)\n\nACT II - CHamber of Death -- People are TRAPPED. No escape unless they can find something -- find it or die. No way out - until Taylor by chance finds the object of magic -- and in doing so, brings to life the Guardian --- who then casts the spell that opens the doorway to Poseidon's Chamber.\n\nACT III - Poseidon's Chamber -- for all of you jaded people who KNOW the secret of the room - next time WATCH the faces of the guests who don't know whats coming. You will see that they are quite awestruck -- as a magic trick, it works well. As to the rest of it - the focus, the staging, the storytelling is CLEAR now. We realize what is up.\n\nAnd, as pointed out by others -- if you saw the show early in the SUmmer - the finale effects were not firing as consistently as we had liked. Now the show is building up its reliabilty - and mjore and more of the effects are in.\n\nI agree with several people here -- its easy to be jaded and cynical about things. Espeically when you don't go on line to achieve things. But here, I end where I started - I make no apologies. THe show is clearer. Kids love the show (although Tiny ones have to leave as it gets a little scary for them) - Adults love the show too though. The ratings have gone up. People applaud at the end of this show - something that never happened previously. I'm proud of this on all counts - but when you add that we did it on a small, tight budget, and in 12 weeks, it is only that much more incredible.\n\nI urge those of you who thought it wasn't all that great, to see it again with an open mind. I cannot agree with anyone who thinks the previous show was a gem -- sorry. It was really not good on most any level - dramatically and from an entertainment point of view - it lacked any heart, it had no humor, and it certainly was not engaging.\n\nI welcome your comments - its always good to get feedback. Now -=- for your specific comments --\n\nBarry - flashlights probably wouldn't help in Latin Class.and as to your other comments- Darkennon is in a way related to all classic villains. Thanks for the obvservation. As to the \"GreeK' your comment regarding English here means that MOST motion pictures are wrong then? You know - when we see them reading the words in Bibles from other eras, when we see Roman and Greeks words in movies that are also in English - its a CONVENTION used to facilityate a story. And by the way -- just so you know -- Poseidon's Fury isn't a REAL story. Its fantasy and action adventure.\n\nMr. Nonacho - we found one of the brightest ones we could find - so you're right. I'll try to find out what the spec and model is.\n\nBarry - Cute -- that observation about Greek and English. And also the comparison to Darth Maul. Nice.\n\nCoiley the SPring SPrit e- I love you - you GET it - you have a sense of what creating a show is all about -- and you understand the nature of storytelling. THANKS for the positive words and thoughts --\n\nMIB999999 - I don;'t understand your hang up on DARKENNON - he was created because in actuallity it is MORE believeable that a HIGH PRIEST challenged the gods in a way that would make him evil and capable of using humans as nothing more than sacrifical lambs. To make Poseidon a VILLAIN is wrong-headed. I am suprised you don't understand that. And what is WRONG with an original character? THINK ABOUT THIS - you need to have, in a show that takes place in 12 minutes - INSTANTLY RECGONIZABLE ICONS -- so that people KNOW what your intent is. THIS IS NOT MOVIE MEDIUM where you have TIME to establish character and intent -- - THINK when you criticise.\n\nTony M - the entire notion that ZEUS was actually this guy in a bad wig and bad fake beard is insulting! You all go on about \"reality\" and then take the entire basis of the original show - a young actor playing an OLD man who is actually a centureies old GOD, who becomes a CGI animated character -- I mean COME ON!!!\n\nAll I am saying is - instead of being caustic and smug in your replies people -- THINK about things and find positive solutions. If there was ONE idea in here that was a great suggestion, I'd probably use it. As it is - these endless remarks that are \"cute\" do nothing to really help, nor are they valid criticisms.\n\nI look forward to additional comments.\n\nGary,\n\nThanks a lot for responding to the complaints lodged on this board. Hopefully people will be able to see the show in a new light, and not be totally jaded by their love of the old show.\n\nI enjoyed the old show- but mostly for the major show effects. The stone cartouche door, the water vortex and the room drop. Three wonderful effects, which, unfortunately, were hindrered by a story and set-up that was certainly not the best in the world. You and your team managed to create a better attraction through a more compelling story.\n\nHaving watched many an attraction rehab before, the fact that you guys were able to go from concept to completed product in such a short time is nothing short of amazing.\n\nThe old show was a very passive experience. The audience wasn't involved at all. There was no immedieate sense of danger. You've managed to cover most of the points of why the old show was lacking in comparison to the new one.\n\nOther comments...\n\nDarkennon is evil. As such, (and if the Internet Movie Database is correct, because I wouldn't have ever guessed it was him...) Jeffrey Combs was an excellent choice for the part. The man is very good with deliciously evil parts as evidenced in his recurring role on Deep Space Nine and his small, albeit creepy turn in House on Haunted Hill (which, if we all recall, was partially filmed at IOA). Christina Pickles' Goddess character also stands out. I still get goosebumps when the music swells, the door rolls open and she says \"Your trident comes home... returns to your hand.\"\n\nSpeeding up the cartouche works a lot better than when it moved so slooooowly before. Gives the guest less time to realize its not really stone. Combine that with the louder sound effects, and the effect is much more realistic.\n\nMaking the Chamber of Sacrifices more three dimensional... ie: the frame around the emergency exit doorway, and the painting that helps cover up the hidden door's seperation from the wall.\n\nOne of my favorite improvements... after the strobe goes off and the walls for the smaller chamber fly away... you're standing in complete darkness for a good 6-7 seconds or so. What's great about this? You've already been transported to Poseidon's Chamber. You just can't SEE anything because the Octopus' tentacles are blocking any light from getting in. The lights fade up as the tentacles unwrap themselves... one of my biggest complaints about the old show was it seemed like a movie was starting. They needed a segue between no projection and the start of the film so they created the Octopus. Unfortunatrely, it didn't really explain why you can see perfectly... it really made it seem like a film. The new use of the Octopus segue is spectacular- its such a small detail, but it adds so much to the realism.\n\nOne point that hasn't been brought up yet... the new show has a WONDERFUL score. From the queue music that sounds very Haunted Mansion-esque, to the swelling theme in the Chamber of Death as the door slides open... it's nice really, because, unlike the old show, the main theme and variations thereof follow you from room to room. Works extremely well, in my opinion. Something I think we can ALL agree on, is that IOA has the single best collection of original attraction and area music of just about anywhere, and as such, the new music is in good company- and yet a few more tracks I would love to have on CD. The old show's score was actually good as well, but it only really stood out in the final chamber.\n\nIf I have only one complaint about the entire redo- it's that the lightning in the queue wasn't replaced with the excavation work lights, ala DL's Indy. But if I had to guess, I would assume that their absence (Although not complete absense, as the two main lights in the final portion of the queue were replaced... to reinforce the idea of an electricity generator) was due to budgetary purposes.\n\nI could keep going on with the praise, but I'll just close with saying Bravo to you and your team. Congratulations on giving guests of Islands of Adventure what's basically a brand new attraction- one that's compelling, and as exciting as some of the other offerings in the park.\n\n-CoileyTheSpringSprite\n\naka kungaloosh1937@hotmail.com"
