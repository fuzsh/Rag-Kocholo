        "text": "It’s when religion and politics swirl together that things get murky. The belief that salvation is granted only to some people —those who work for it—is another way of saying, “God helps those who help themselves.” Politicians who align with that statement often use it to justify laws that push vulnerable people on the margins further out.\n\nI remember Jesus being fairly specific about God wanting us to help others. I suspect Jesus would have substituted Scott’s word “fight” with “love.” Resolve to show LOVE to yourselves, others and those you love. And know that part of God within you will be LOVING you all the way.”\n\nTo present-day eyes, the way Scott bullies and screams at his followers is a wild display of 1970s-style leadership. The injured are dragged along for their own good. The frightened are told to pull themselves together and keep moving. There is one path. One leader. He is the most charismatic and assertive man in the pack, so he insists they get behind him or risk being consumed in the fires, literally.\n\nInterested in more stories like this?

Women are called emotional, fat, old and weak. One character, Belle Rosen, played by the incomparable Shelley Winters, begs to lead the team through a treacherous underwater pass because she has experience in endurance swimming. Scott rejects her request and plows forward alone, only to need rescuing by Belle, who dies as a result of the extra time it takes to free him underwater. His bullish insistence on performative heroics is Belle’s demise."
