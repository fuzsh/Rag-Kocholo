        "text": "Adapted from Edward. R. Edingers The Eternal Drama: The Inner Meaning of Greek Mythology. And Jungs intro to Man and His Symbols\n\nRead excerpt of 1st chapter: What Is Mythology?\n\nCosmogony: Myths of Creation\n\nSeveral versions of how the cosmos came into existence (Bible has 2 books of Genesis, which tell somewhat different stories)\n\nSimplest story: Out of Chaos, the earth (Gaia) emerged and gave birth to the Sky (Uranus), and together they created their progeny.\n\nIndicates that the creative act itself involves exposure to chaos.\n\nCreation means that something new came into the world that didnt previously exist.\n\nChaos is the womb of all things yet to be.\n\nNothing new can emerge until one is willing to reach into the chaos and pull it out.\n\nProcess of splitting/bifurcation then occurs.\n\nProcess of achieving consciousness involves a splitting into opposites.\n\nThings can remain in a state of oneness only in the unconscious.\n\nIn consciousness, they must divide into opposites\n\nThen we have the experience of conflict.\n\nConsciousness (the tree of knowledge of good and evil) creates through a tension of opposites, the force of which keeps all dynamic systems activated and morphing, ever becoming new through this tension of opposites.\n\nHeraklitos, the pre-Socratic philosopher, posits that strife is the eternal creator. All is always becoming. Nothing ever truly is. The logos sets it all in motion and gives birth to the order that emerges through chaos. Thus, as Heriklitos so eloquently puts it, One can never step twice into the same river. Not only is the river changed, but you are changed as well.\n\nPlato also embraces this idea, but for him, the material/physical world is always in a state of flux. For him, logos means quite the opposite of what it meant to Heraklitos (also spelled Heraclitus). To Plato's mind, Logos constitutes the world of Form where Truth expresses a state of immutable Oneness.\n\nCarl Jung then takes this idea and broadens it to describe the Collective Unconscious that he considers the metastructure, or the architecture, of the psyche. This collective unconscious, Jung believes, is the mythic structure that provides the foundation of consciousness. His writing explores how people from all times and all places share core myths that become the underpinnings of consciousness, culture, and communication. For Jung, these archetypes comprise the mythic unconscious and express themselves in our dreams and in the stories we tell (think literature, fairytales, movies, news, etc.). Stories that have an archetypal structure strike a chord in our conscious lives as well as in our unconscious minds.\n\nWe are the stories we hear and the stories we tell.\n\nEarly mythology is peopled with kings paranoid about losing their power who feel compelled to destroy whomever threatens to usurp the throne, even if it means devouring their own offspring. Likewise, many siblings compete for power, and in their efforts to seize power, demonstrate every sort of travesty imaginable.\n\nOppression always backfires ultimately, though. It works in the beginning but soon becomes too much, and a hero emerges to right the wrong.\n\nURANUS\n\nUranus imprisoned his children (The Titans and Cyclopes) because he felt they posed a threat. .\n\nCyclopes: giant race with one round eye; confined in the earth.\n\nTitans: giant race overthrown by the Olympian gods.\n\nGaia is upset by their imprisonment and encourages her son Kronos to revolt against his father, Uranus.\n\nKRONOS\n\nKronos waylays Uranus and castrates him.\n\nThe drops of blood that hit the earth become the Erinyes/the Furies.\n\nThe genitals that fell into the sea give birth to Aphrodite, goddess of love.\n\nThe Cyclopes-- with their one round eye and burial beneath the earth-- represent a psychic aspect that has not yet split into doubleness. The roundness suggests a certain primordial wholeness (repressed by Uranus).\n\nConsequences of Uranuss castration: birth of desire (Aphrodite) and punishment (Furies).\n\nFreud and the castration complex: The son wants to supplant/overthrow the father and claim his power/authority.\n\nThis overthrow is necessary because power seeks to perpetuate itself and to eliminate all threats to its authority. Parallel to the psyche, an age-old principle must be overthrown before growth and change can occur. (Remember culture-epoch theory?)\n\nThe newly emerging power must overcome the outmoded or oppressive power and, ironically, becomes the new oppressor with his own power issues, which will eventually cause him to abuse his authority and lead to his own overthrow. This is the dialectic process at play once again: The thesis is opposed by its antithesis, bringing about a synthesis of the two, which then becomes the new thesis, and on and on it goes (Socrates' dialectic method, Hegels historical dialectic, and the Communist Manifesto come to mind).\n\nKronos, when told by an oracle that one of his offspring would depose him, tried to circumvent the event and began to swallow all his children as a means of forestalling this doom.\n\nZEUS is the son of Kronos and Rhea. Rhea tricked Kronos so that he wouldn't devour her newborn infant, Zeus. She replaced the baby with a stone, which Kronos then swallowed, thinking he'd done away with his son's potential usurpation of the royal power. Rhea then hid her son on the isle of Crete until he was strong enough to challenge his father. Ultimately, Zeus returned to overthrow his father and instituted a changing of the gods. In Jungian depth psychology, this exemplifies how a whole dynasty of psychic authorities must eventually be overthrown by a new ruling class.\n\nThe devouring parent is an image universally encountered. In this case, the oracle told the father that he would be overpowered by his son, so he takes drastic measures to avert that disaster. However, as the Greeks tell us in myth after myth, story after story, the oracles truth will always come to passtheres no escaping it. Fate will out, and as Jung says, You meet your destiny on the path you take to escape it.\n\nKronos, a Titan, was cast out in a war between the gods and the Titans.\n\nTwo other noteworthy Titans: Prometheus (literally means forethought) and Atlas.\n\nAtlas punishment for losing the war was to hold up the Earth-- forever.\n\nTitans became sacrifices for humanitys well being. In psychological terms, the archetypal contents that these meta-structures represent went into the service of the ego.\n\nPrometheus, still rebelling against the pantheon of gods, sides with humanity and gives humans fire in the bargain. (Remember that fire is the primordial technology that distinguishes humans from animals. [You could argue that animals make art or that they experience love or even that they speak their own language, but animals never make fire. Remember as well, that fire kindles our love affair with technology as the basis for our other creature comforts.]\n\nPrometheus was assigned to supervise the separation of the sacrificial meat to determine which part should go to the gods and which part to humans.\n\nBefore this time, gods and humans had eaten together, so the myth goes, but now the new races of gods and humans eat separately. Psychologically, this demonstrates the separation of the ego from its archetypal origins.\n\nPrometheus deceives the gods by wrapping the bones and gristle into an enticing package of skin but leaves the nourishing meat for humans.\n\nZeus punishes humans for this duplicity by depriving them of fire, but Prometheus steals fire and is finally punished by being chained in the Caucasus Mountains where his liver will be eternally eaten away by a bird of prey each day (some say a vulture while others say it was Zeus eagle) only to have it grow back each night, and so forth and so on for all eternity. Eternal recurrence\n\nThis myth tells of the nature of the emerging consciousness:\n\n1st there is the separation of what belongs to gods and what to humansthe ego gaining nourishment/energy for itself;\n\n2nd humans gain firelight and energy: consciousness and the effective energy of will to carry out conscious intention are thereby created.\n\nThe price to pay for this violation (because of the acquisition of consciousness, which occurred as a direct result of meat and fire/psychic nourishment and energy) is that by day (the time of light and consciousness), Prometheus suffers his eternal wound. Therefore, consciousness can be seen as inflicting the wound, which means that Prometheus pays for human consciousness with his suffering (much like Christàa lot of ink has been spilled on this parallel). For, Prometheus so loved the world that he sacrificed himself to promote human development. Sound familiar?\n\nAs another tangent of this myth, Prometheus was also punished indirectly by the punishment meted out to his brother, Epimetheus (literally means afterthought), who received the gift of Pandora (or should I say the booby prize?) Pandora literally means gifts given by all the gods.\n\nPandora myth: Zeus took revenge on Prometheus by sending an evil which would counterbalance the benefits of the gift of fire. He told Hephaistos, the craftsman god, to create a maiden, his most beautiful creation, a woman who would be invested with gifts from each and every god. Athena taught her womens work (Athena is goddess of weaving, wisdom, and war, and is tauted at the cleverest of all the gods); Aphrodite endowed her with beauty; Hermes gave her a deceitful nature; the Charities and the Horae adorned her with beautifully delicate clothing, flowers, and a golden crown. Hermes, the messenger, took Pandora to Epimetheus as a gift. Prometheus, still loving humans, locked away in a casket all the evils that might plague the world. This was given to Pandora as a dowry. Prometheus had warned Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus (beware of Greeks bearing gifts), but Epimetheus forgot and married Pandora. Remembering too late his brothers warning, he forbade Pandora to open the box. One day her curiosity got the better of her and she opened it, releasing all the scourges to humankind. Only hope remained. Some say it was Prometheus who gave humans desire and wild hope. The myth tells that before the arrival of woman/Pandora, men lived without evil and hardship. With her coming, they fell from grace and have suffered ever since in a dangerous and unhappy world.\n\nPandora and fire are somewhat equivalent in that fire is energy and one of the aspects of energy is desire. Pandora becomes the object of desire. As the ego is given the powers of desire, will, and longing, it also receives the contents of Pandoras box: the sufferings of human life. (Note the parallel to Adam & Eve). Being born into ego consciousness is both blessing and curse, with joy and suffering going hand in hand.\n\nAs described in these myths, the unconscious state is paradise, and the expulsion from paradise (the archetypal primordial, undifferentiated unconscious, as represented by the creator gods and goddesses) is the equivalent of birth into the ego-conscious state wherein suffering and strife work to develop the individual Self (remember Heraklitos' idea of strife as the creative force).\n\nPrometheus, then, becomes the consciousness-bringing principle itself.\n\nIn Aeschylus Prometheus Bound, Prometheus says that until his interference in the affairs of humankind, they wandered aimlessly, like children, without reason and with no purpose  until I taught them to discern the seasons by the rising and the obscure setting of the stars. Numbers I invented for them, the chiefest of all discoveries; I taught them the grouping of letters, to be a memorial and record of the past, the mistress of the arts and mother of the Muses. I first brought under the yoke beasts of burden, who by draft and carrying relieved men of their hardest labors; I yoked the proud horse to the chariot, teaching him obedience to the reigns, to be the adornment of wealth and luxury. I too contrived for sailors sea-faring vessels with their flaxen wings . He also gave them divination, medicine, metallurgy; in short, all the human arts are from Prometheus.\n\nMythic parallels can be found in Greek, Hebrew, and Christian stories.\n\nThere is an advocate in the archetypal realm, whether it be Prometheus, Christ, or Isaiah to assist the ego in overcoming the isolation and suffering.\n\nTwo main aspects of the psychological meaning:\n\n1) consciousness is accompanied by suffering\n\n2)the ego doesnt have to do all the suffering alone.\n\nCHAPTER 3: OLYMPIAN GODS\n\nEarly civilized minds took it as self-evident that there were beings who were immortal and were fundamental, guiding sources and presences.\n\nIn psychological terms, they can be seen as inhabitants of the collective unconscious, which are, in turn, expressions of the archetypes.\n\nArchetypes are the psychic entities that continue to exist unchanging and unchanged while the momentary individual egos come and go. (Platos physical world of becoming and the spiritual world of Being come to mind. Plato also speaks of a connected consciousness that interpenetrates all human psyches, and he therefore contends that all knowledge is merely a re-collection of what we already know and have know since the birth of our individual souls from the womb of the original source/Form.)\n\nArchetypes are the fingerprints of what Jung calls the collective unconscious. They form the deep structures of the mythic psyche (Greek word that literally means, the breath of life). He argues that these mythic structures/archetypes keep us all connected to primal symbols and memories.\n\nHistorical experiences that illustrate some basic and universal feature of the human psyche turn into myth, so there is, in a certain sense, an interchange between history and myth.\n\nIndividual egos live out historical processes whereas archetypal images exist in a mythological dimension that penetrates, permeates, and transcends all individuals at all times in all places. This psychic bond is based on archetypal images and symbols.\n\nThese mythic structures then unify all humankind in a primal knowledge whose truths are revealed in the highly interpretive language of symbol and image. These mythic forms are the ever-veiled and eternally revealed wisdom of the collective unconscious the interpersonal, transpersonal, collectively shared psyche. (Think: Platos Ideal Form).\n\nThe collective unconscious, in essence, bonds single cells into one organism whose whole is more than the sum of its parts. All peoples at all times have shared identical images in dreams and stories and spirituality. The details differ, but the story remains the same. (The Virgin birth, for example, or the holy trinity/triple goddess are common to many religious traditions.)\n\nIliad gods and humans are active on the same stage. Literally, gods and humans were both bodily present on the battlefield. Gods pick their favorites, as well, and then fight one another vicariously through these heroes.\n\nIn psychological sense, we can take this interplay between humans and gods to be the interpenetration between ego experience and archetypal factors signified by the gods. In other words, the nature of psychological experience is that our actions and experiences are constantly shaped and supported by archetypal urges and powers.\n\nNumbers can also be symbolic. Plato and Pythagoras and Einstein agreed that number is the highest possible expression of truth.\n\nTodays philosophy is brought to you by the number 12. 12 Olympian gods, the pantheon (pan=all, theo=gods); 12 hours of day & 12 hours of night; 12 tribes of Israel; 12 apostles of Christ; 12 signs of the zodiad; 12 labors of Heracles.\n\n12 is related to the symbolism of wholeness, to the mandala and the quaternity, and is often associated with sacredness.\n\nAs the ego looks in the direction of the Self, the transpersonal center of the psyche, it tends to experience the Self not as a unity (at least not at first) but as a multiplicity of archetypal factors that one can think of as being represented by the Greek gods.\n\nSeen as one unity: the pantheon. From the viewpoint of depth psychology, the gods stand for the archetypes, the basic patterns within the human psyche that exist independent of personal experience. We all have all of them present, and it is in our best interest to honor all of them at appropriate times and in any given situation because without this balance we run the risk of overidentification with one element and thereby do violence to all the others. In turn, this sort of extremism throws our psyche out of whack and we can only see one facet of ourselves and the world.\n\nHubris is a Greek word which is usually translated as \"overweening pride\" or \"the pride that goeth before a fall\" and comes from a verb meaning \"to do violence to the gods.\" It is hubris that ultimately brings about the fall of Greek heroes because their arrogance insults the gods and disrespects their turf. There are lots of myths that deal with this theme and many that show what happens to people who worship only one of the gods to the exclusion of the others. Balance for the Greeks is key to happiness and harmony.\n\nThe gods/archetypes are templates on which the individual life is formed.Mythologically, these eternal patterns are thought of as gods, existing in a special place apart from ordinary human experience (whether it be heaven, MountOlympus, or the sacred mountain). Whatever the identification or description is ascribed to this special place apart, it remains a realm beyond the personal.\n\nYahweh (YHVH) in Hebrew mythology: a sky god who inhabited Mount Sinai, which was quite similar to MountOlympus as well as the heaven of Christians and Muslims alike.\n\nThe abode of the gods generally has a perfect, eternal, untarnished quality (i.e., streets of gold).\n\nPsychologically, the Olympian realm is a projection onto the outer world of an inner statea state that is eternal, unchanging, and a realm of spirit as opposed to matter.\n\nOlympian existence emphasized the misery of mortality.\n\nThere exists an eternal psyche (or something symbolized by an eternal psyche) that is of greater duration than the ego.\n\nFor Jung, the collective unconscious is analogous to the abode of the archetypes/gods. In his purely psychological views, the heavenly realm of the Greek gods is seen as apart of the human psyche, which is beyond time and space and beyond the control of the conscious personality.\n\nThe Olympian gods, then, can be understood as translations of psychological realities into externalized realities.\n\nThe twelve gods chart the eternal or impersonal dimension of the psyche. The Greek pantheon forms a set of archetypal principles, and we can thus talk about an Aphrodite principle, a Zeus principle, an Ares principle, etc. (much the same as Nietzsche delineates in his discussion of the Dionysian and Apollonian principles in his essay, The Birth of Tragedy)\n\nWe observe and experience these principles in different ways, but they provide us a means of making meaning. Without these unifying principles, we could never hope to communicate. (Keep in mind that one of the major distinctions between humans and animals is that humans are capable of symbolic thought.)\n\nWe observe these archetypes and principles in others, recognize them in ourselves (if we are at all self-reflective), and encounter them in our dreams.\n\nThe closer we come to approaching our individual state of wholeness (what Jung calls individuation), the more likely we are to have had at least brief encounters with most, if not all, of these divine principles, for all humans contain within themselves these deeply imbedded psychic structures; we all contain within our psyche traits analogous to the Olympian Pantheon.\n\nThe Greek Pantheon: a holy trinity & paternal authority principle>Zeus + Poseidon + Hades\n\nZEUS= The ultimate authority ruling over the three-fold paternal authority principle, made up of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hadeswho can be seen as different manifestations of the same basic principle).\n\nSky god, supreme deity, comes closest of all the members of the Pantheon to embodying the whole Self, even though he represents only the masculine side.\n\nAssociated with wind, rain, thunder, lightning, Zeus is master of spiritual phenomena since the spirit world is signified by the sky and the will of the gods by the manifestations of the weather.\n\nZeus is divine agent of justice and judgment, embodiment of law, punisher of transgressions (hurling thunderbolts)\n\nZeus personifies creative energy, which sought to fertilize/impregnate (through rape when he met resistance), and sought conquest after conquest. An energy continually striving to realize new consciousness and new fruits of itself.\n\nHera, his wife and sister, jealous of his numerous love affairs with mortal women, fiercely opposed him, exacting revenge on the women he had sex with. Shes the feminine embodiment of the Self. She teaches women the same lesson the gods teach heroes and villains alike: when you overstep the boundaries between human and divine realms, whether as the perpetrator or the victim, theres hell to pay!\n\nEvery gain of the ego must be paid for by punishment for having appropriated the divine energy. This psychological fact is seen time and again in the consequences meted out to Zeus mortal sex partners.\n\nThe same archetypal dynamic can also be seen in the union of the divine and the human that occurs in the Christian world: the Annunciation, or the announcement by the Holy Ghost to Mary that she was pregnant.\n\nZeus and Hera are counterbalancing, married opposites that function in an eternal reconciliation of tensions: Zeus role is to create, to generate as many offspring as possible by as many different mothers as possible; Heras role is to resent it and attempt to frustrate and punish individuals who succumb to Zeus desires. Note the parallel in the book of Job where Yahweh is divided against himself, the other part of him appears as Satan.\n\nHere you can see the ambiguity in the world of archetypes. Value neutral, the archetypes are not interested in the comfort and well-being of the human ego but are more interested in something beyond the individuals ability to value or understand.\n\nImagery of Zeus strikes a strong parallel to the first hexagram of the I Ching (the ancient Chinese oracle). Zeus embodies pure yang energy-- primal creative power, which is light-giving, active, strong--whose essence is the power of energy and whose image is heaven.\n\nAs this principle appears psychologically, it can be seen as masculine, self-righteous, moral authority, vengeful of transgressions. If a person falls into unconscious identification with this power principle, he will find himself acting and reacting as though he himself were the Law, the ultimate authority. On the other hand, making an objective connection/association with this principle rather than falling into identification with it, can lead to the capacity for objective judgment and appraisal. The way these archetypal powers manifest in our psychology is a matter of degree and balance. The key is to recognize and utilize them without establishing an all-consuming, fixating overidentification with that particular element or principle. (Aristotle calls this the \"Golden Mean\" and Greeks such as Pythagoras express this idea mathematically as the Pythagorean rectangle or the golden spiral. This mathematical expression is seen everywhere in nature and can be seen as the archetypal balancing act of the universe.)\n\nZeus is the personification of law and judgment, suggesting that human principles of law and justice arise from deep within the psyche.\n\nPOSEIDONbrother of Zeus, also an authority principle, but signifies authority from below rather than from above. Lord of the sea but has dominion over the earth. Poseidon the earth-shaker brings earthquakes and tidal waves.\n\nPoseidon, ruler of the sea, is an earthy version of Zeus; manifested from either the unconscious depths of our psyche or from outer circumstance.\n\nFelt in the earthly impact of concrete life events beyond ones control. Embodiment of the urge for retribution.\n\nI Ching parallel: hexagram 51The Arousing (Shock, thunder)=the Poseidon principle. Yang line develops below 2 yin lines and presses upward forcibly. This movement is so violent that it arouses terror. It is symbolized by thunder, which bursts forth from the earth and by its shock causes fear and trembling. This is the inner earthquake of fear that imbues a reverence for god. The superior man is always filled with reverence at the manifestation of god; he sets his life in order and searches his heart so that people will not harbor any secret opposition to the will of god.\n\nWhen life events shake your emotional or psychological foundations, dreams may include images of storms, earthquakes, or tidal waves, which serve to activate this principle.\n\nThe Poseidon personality would have some similarities to the Zeus personality, but this authority and effectiveness would be more apt to manifest in terms of concrete powerpolitical and economicas opposed to intellectual or spiritual power."
