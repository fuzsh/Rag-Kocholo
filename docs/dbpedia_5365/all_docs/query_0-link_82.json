        "text": "Opening Statement\n\nPerhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise that the most popular films of the Nixon era were epic disaster movies. Of all such action-adventures, however, none was as big [or as entertaining] as Ronald Neame's The Poseidon Adventure – by John Gilpatrick, November 28, 2016\n\nThe Aesthetic Dangers Facing Cinema\n\nWhat I’ve begun to realize is that The Poseidon Adventure is not a good film in any critical sense of the word, but it’s praiseworthy nonetheless. The egregious exposition, the excessive emotionality, and the banal action combine into an exploration of any viewer’s most primal instincts – by Alex Moore, November 29, 2016\n\nRules for Surviving Disaster Movies\n\nThe years and decades that followed would see dozens of similar movies tread this path—but we can look to The Poseidon Adventure for at least a few baseline rules for how to avoid the inevitable death traps that will claim the lives of many a disaster movie character – by John Gilpatrick, November 30, 2016\n\nRelated Review: The Wave\n\nWhat The Wave does differently than those modern disaster flicks draws it closer to the height of the 1970s mainstays. Through a small group of characters and an isolated event, the film is no less harrowing than its globe-trotting counterparts – by Aaron Pinkston, December 1, 2016\n\nFurther Streaming: Disaster Films\n\nAs we’ve talked about throughout this week’s look at disaster films, they can be the ultimate popcorn movies, warts and all. There is no lack of the genre available on streaming services, including the prominent run from the mid-1990s that are highlighted below – by Aaron Pinkston, December 2, 2016"
