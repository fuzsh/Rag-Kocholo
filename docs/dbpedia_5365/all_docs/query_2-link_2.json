I was waiting for the appearance of sea monsters, but then I saw the name of the cruise ship, Poseidon, in the beginning.\n\nIf you enjoy watching “Titanic,” you may find this movie “Poseidon” as interesting. Or you’ll really dislike it. Those who enjoy this movie may think of their favorite movie about the cruise ship, while those who dislike the movie may think that this is a generic version of “Titanic.”\n\nThis movie was released in 2006, about nine years after one of the all-time great movies, “Titanic.” If this movie was released long before the infamous movie, I believe that the rating would have been higher than current ratings because the idea of the cruise ship sinking is similar.\n\nThe story tells how, basically, the cruise ship starts to sink. People on the ship try to survive. There is some love here and there, but that does not seem like the main focus. If it was, I did not notice much. I would say the genre of the movie is action, and possibly thriller.\n\nThis movie really made me think that I need to be better at swimming. It made me not want to go on a cruise ship anytime soon. I mean, the COVID-19 pandemic probably makes the cruise ship experience less fun anyway.\n\nOverall, I leave the rating to the audience to decide whether you enjoy the movie. Oh, and do not watch the movie if you plan on going on a cruise ship!\n\nRotten Tomato Rating: 33%\n\nRotten Tomato Audience Rating: 43%\n\nIMDb Rating: 5.7/10\n\n*The ratings are from 10/23/2020."
