        "text": "Hello everyone! ðŸ™‚\n\nWelcome to â€˜Bradleyâ€™s Basementâ€™ blog and Iâ€™m Tim Bradley!\n\nIâ€™ve seen the 1972 film â€˜The Poseidon Adventureâ€™ on Disney+ This is an intense disaster film which I enjoyed watching. Itâ€™s astonishing a disaster movie like this was made in the 1970s. It makes you think how a film like this compares to todayâ€™s standards. Many have claimed that this is a classic film.\n\nIâ€™m pretty sure Russell T. Davies was inspired by this film to write the â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ 2017 Christmas Special called â€˜Voyage of the Damnedâ€™. This is especially when the film is set on New Yearâ€™s Eve/New Yearâ€™s Day; the Poseidon ship topples over; and our characters attempt to escape the sinking ship. ðŸ™‚\n\nThe luxury liner Poseidon is on her final voyage from New York City to Athens. Unfortunately during the New Year celebrations, the ship is overturned by a tsunami. Passengers and crew are trapped inside the ship and a preacher attempts to lead a small group of survivors in order to get to safety. ðŸ™‚\n\nAnother intriguing parallel between the â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™ episode â€˜Voyage of the Damnedâ€™ and this film is that some of the main characters get killed off when trying to escape the sinking ship. It makes for high intense drama. There are also certain moments where the characters have a chance to develop.\n\nI do think the film should have been called â€˜The Poseidon Incidentâ€™ instead of â€˜The Poseidon Adventureâ€™. Considering itâ€™s a disaster film, thereâ€™s less thrills of an adventure when your life is endangered and a ship is about to sink into the ocean. Iâ€™d be really terrified if I were in that situation.\n\nInterestingly, this film got a sequel called â€˜Beyond the Poseidon Adventureâ€™. The film itself is based on the 1969 book of the same name by Paul Gallico. The film was also produced by Irwin Allen, who produced TV shows such as â€˜Lost In Spaceâ€™, â€˜The Time Tunnelâ€™ and â€˜Voyage to the Bottom of the Seaâ€™.\n\nThere was a TV remake in 2005 and a cinematic remake called â€˜Poseidonâ€™ with Kurt Russell in 2006, but Iâ€™ve not seen those yet. Amazingly, this film features a stellar cast of actors who Iâ€™ve seen in other things. I was delighted to see the cast of actors when watching them in this dramatic disaster movie.\n\nGene Hackman stars as Reverend Frank Scott, the preacher who leads a number of survivors to get off the Poseidon ship. Gene Hackman is well-known for playing Lex Luthor in the â€˜Supermanâ€™ films with Christopher Reeve. It was good to see him in this and interesting to see him play a sort-of hero.\n\nThereâ€™s Ernest Borgnine as Detective Lieutenant Mike Rogo, who questions Frank Scottâ€™s leadership. Red Buttons (who Iâ€™ve seen in 1977â€™s â€˜Peteâ€™s Dragonâ€™) stars as James Martin. I liked his scenes with Carol Lynley as Nonnie Parry the singer who became scared when they had to overcome obstacles. ðŸ™‚\n\nRoddy McDowall stars as Acres, an injured waiter, and Stella Stevens stars as Linda Rogo, Mike Rogoâ€™s wife. Shelley Winters (who Iâ€™ve seen in â€˜Winchester â€™73â€™, 1977â€™s â€˜Peteâ€™s Dragonâ€™ and the 1960s â€˜Batmanâ€™ TV series) stars as Belle Rosen, who gets to save Frank Scottâ€™s life from drowning. ðŸ˜€\n\nJack Albertson (who Iâ€™ve seen as Grandpa Joe in â€˜Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factoryâ€™) stars as Manny Rosen, Belleâ€™s husband in the film. Thereâ€™s also Pamela Sue Martin as Susan Shelby (who I think fancies Frank Scott in this) and thereâ€™s Eric Shea as Robin Shelby, Susanâ€™s brother in the film. ðŸ˜€\n\nThe film also has Arthur Oâ€™Connell as Chaplain John and Leslie Nielsen as Captain Harrison. Thereâ€™s also Fred Sadoff as Lincarcos, Bryon Webster as Purser, Jan Arvan as Dr. Caravello, Shelia Mathews as the nurse, John Crawford as the chief engineer, Bob Hastings as M.C. and Erik Nelson as Tinkham.\n\nâ€˜The Poseidon Adventureâ€™ has been an enjoyable film to watch lately. Itâ€™s tragic that not all the characters you expect to survive in the film survive. Then again, I was expecting that since this is a disaster film. It seems to have been well-put together with good writing, performances and drama. ðŸ™‚\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nBye for now!\n\nTim. ðŸ™‚"
