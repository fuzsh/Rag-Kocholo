        "text": "You might see people opining that the story of say the Star Wars movie Rogue One is built upon a question that no one really needed answering – why has an exhaust port connected to vital systems of the Death Star been left unshielded? You might also think that latching on to such minutiae, minor characters or embellishing an established story was the preserve of modern Hollywood film studios or fanfiction produced by people who just want more from their favourite stories and characters; however, it is a much older and well-established literary idea than you might think. Some of the most famous writers and stories are just such embellishments and ‘fanfiction.’\n\nWilliam Shakespeare put words in Mark Antony’s mouth for the ‘Friends, Romans, countrymen’ funeral oration he gave for Julius Caesar; different words than recorded by the likes of Appian, BC II.144-147, who may even have had a report of what was said in 44BC. When it came to speeches given before or during the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides admitted to making “the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various occasions, of course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what they really said.” (Thucydides I.22.1)\n\nEven the Iliad itself is a poetic retelling of a (seemingly) historical event embellished with fantasy elements and loans from other older works and myths such as the Epic of Gilgamesh. If I were being mean, I would say that a modern equivalent for the Iliad in terms of genre fiddling is the movie 300, which took the historical setting of the Persian invasion of Greece and the Battle of Thermopylae and added various fantastical elements such as monsters and seemingly divine beings… It could even be argued that the Odyssey is merely a spin-off of the Iliad, latching on to one specific character in Odysseus and telling a story of his attempts to return home on the background of the Trojan War.\n\nAnd the same can be said of Virgil’s Aeneid, which does something similar thing, rehashing/remaking the genre outlines of the Iliad and the Odyssey, only with a more minor and “fairly vague” (Williams (1985), 28) character. And yet, the Romans had created an entire mythos on the foundation of their city around this “fairly vague” character centuries before Virgil composed the Aeneid, possibly replicating how Greek colonists created connections between their new homes and the mythology of the Aegean world (Kinsey (2012) 18).\n\nSo what does the Iliad tell us about Aeneas that would make him a viable and attractive candidate for the Romans to build a foundation myth around?\n\nBeyond his personal survival of the Trojan War, the most attractive thing about Aeneas as a link back to the ‘old world’ of the Aegean was his genealogy. He was a member of the Trojan royal family, specifically its offshoot branch that ruled the city/area of Dardania, the troops of whom he commanded during the Trojan War for his grandfather, Capys, then ruler of Dardania.\n\nIn terms of his place in the Trojan royal family, Aeneas was connected to King Priam in two ways. Through his grandmother, Themiste, who was a (half-)aunt of the Trojan king, Aeneas was a first cousin once removed of Priam (Themiste having married Capys, despite them being first cousins). Through his patriarchal line – Anchises > Capys > Assaracus, he was also a second cousin once removed of Priam, with Assaracus being a brother of Priam’s grandfather. This made Aeneas both a second and third cousin of Priam’s children, including Creusa, who would be Aeneas’ first wife.\n\nHowever, even more useful for the Romans in terms of legitimacy and prestige was the identity of Aeneas’ mother. Whilst tending his herd of cattle on Mount Ida, Anchises was seduced (on the meddling of Zeus) by the goddess Aphrodite (Illiad 2.819 cf. 5.247, 5.313), who then gave birth to Aeneas. The Julians would claim divine descent from Venus/Aphrodite through Aeneas’ son, Ascanius, whom they identified with Iulus, the mythical ancestor of the entire clan. Another version has Iulus be the son of Aeneas and Creusa, while Ascanius was Aeneas’ son by Lavinia.\n\nThis divine heritage would prove of considerable help to Aeneas during the Trojan War, as his position within the Trojan royal family and captain of Dardanian forces saw him serve as a prominent lieutenant to his cousin, Hector. This in turn saw him play an active role in the fighting and shows himself to be a brave and skilled warrior and leader.\n\nHe is recorded slaying several named men – Crethon and Orsilochus, sons of Diocles, Aphareus, son of Caletor, Medon and Iasus and Leocritus, son of Arisbas (Iliad 5.541, 13.541, 13.541, 17.343). Some prominent Greeks thought twice about fighting Aeneas alone – the Trojan prince challenged Menelaus, but had to withdraw when the Spartan king brought back up (Iliad 5.541), a lesson that Aeneas seemingly learned for when he later challenged Idomenus, the Trojan brought his own back in case the Greek replicated Menelaus, which he did, leading to a group fight rather than a duel (Iliad 13.500). In Books 6 and 11, he is seen in prominent leadership roles, charged by Helenus (another son of Priam) with organising the defence of Troy, alongside Hector, and then assaulting the walls of the Greek camp. Aeneas also rallied the Trojans when they were in trouble during the fighting over the corpse of Patroclus (Iliad 17.323).\n\nHis achievements saw Aeneas “honoured by the people like a god” (Iliad 11.58). This also might seem like a comment on his divine heritage, but then Aphrodite being his mother was supposed to be a secret (Anchises was struck by lightning from Zeus for bragging about his divine liaison). Furthermore, others in the Iliad are described with similar words, although this would seem to present “honoured by the people like a god” as a known demonstrating a form of respect.\n\nIt could be that Aeneas was not above holding himself in high regard. He claimed to be as good as Hector (Iliad 5.467; cf. 6.78), and in Book 16, he shows shock and anger when Meriones luckily avoids being killed by his spear throw. Aeneas’ self-confidence even went as far as to display annoyance at Priam for not honouring him sufficiently, despite his ability and skills (Iliad 13.460). It can only be speculated as to what was at the heart of this annoyance with Priam as Homer does not go into any detail. Might the Trojan king have been put out by the love showed by the Trojans to this Dardanian captain, over and above his own children, except Hector?\n\nWhile he did fight and defeat several individuals, it could be that Aeneas was brave and confident beyond his actual martial ability. The likes of Idomenus and Menelaus might have been wary of Aeneas’ prowess, but it came to the next level of fighters, Aeneas was found somewhat wanting.\n\nWhen he squared up to Diomedes alongside Pandarus, not only was his colleague killed, but Aeneas lost his great horses (descended from the immortal steads of Zeus), fails to defeat the now unarmed Diomedes and is then severely wounded by his opponent throwing a huge stone at his hip (Iliad 5.225).\n\nAnd yet, while he had failed to make much impression against perhaps the second best warrior of the Greeks, Aeneas allowed himself to be talked into squaring up to the Greeks’ greatest warrior, the rampaging Achilles.\n\nTo be fair, it was Apollo who encouraged this challenging of Achilles, and Aeneas was initially inclined to not listen due to recognising his own limits in the face of the skill of Achilles; however, Apollo points out that Aeneas is the son of Aphrodite, while Achilles is only the son of a nymph and will therefore be protected in the duel.\n\nAfter an exchange of threats and insults, during which Achilles reveals that the two have fought before, hitherto unmentioned, that Aeneas had been lucky to survive, and that the Trojan was only taking up this gauntlet again for the potential glory to increase his chances of ruling Troy (Iliad 20.84-109).\n\nWhen the duel begins, it is a quick affair. Aeneas strikes first, his thrown spear finding its mark, only for it to rebound harmlessly off Achilles’ armour made by Hephaestus. Achilles’ first strike knocks Aeneas’ shield from his hands.\n\nUnarmed, Aeneas looks to lift a large stone to defend himself, but the sword-wielding, swift-footed Achilles is going to strike the fatal blow… and then… nothing. Aeneas was not struck down. Instead, he was whisked away from danger by divine intervention.\n\nThis was not the first time the gods had deigned to save Aeneas – he had only survived his duel with Diomedes due to first Aphrodite and then Apollo (Iliad 5.225; cf. 5.344). This would have been enough to suggest that Aeneas and anyone descended from him was divinely protected, but the climax of the (second) duel with Achilles will have removed all doubt.\n\nInstead of Aphrodite or Apollo, it was Poseidon who saved Aeneas from Achilles (Iliad 20.291-340). This raises a significant question – whilst Aphrodite was his mother and Apollo had always viewed him as a favourite, why did Poseidon, who had sided with the Greeks throughout the war, come to Aeneas’ aid (Iliad 20.291-340)?\n\nEven before looking for reasons given in the sources, you would be forgiven for thinking that this was only further fuel to the notion of a significant destiny surrounding Aeneas and his descendants, one that the Romans would not be slow to play up.\n\nAnd when you then read Poseidon’s own reading of the situation, you can see why the Romans might have felt that Aeneas was a worthy progenitor.\n\n“Now look you, verily have I grief for great-hearted Aeneas, who anon shall go down to the house of Hades, [295] slain by the son of Peleus, for that he listened to the bidding of Apollo that smiteth afar—fool that he was! nor will the god in any wise ward from him woeful destruction. But wherefore should he, a guiltless man, suffer woes vainly by reason of sorrows that are not his own?—whereas he ever giveth acceptable gifts to the gods that hold broad heaven. [300] Nay, come, let us head him forth from out of death, lest the son of Cronos be anywise wroth, if so be Achilles slay him; for it is ordained unto him to escape, that the race of Dardanus perish not without seed and be seen no more—of Dardanus whom the son of Cronos loved above all the children born to him [305] from mortal women. For at length hath the son of Cronos come to hate the race of Priam; and now verily shall the mighty Aeneas be king among the Trojans, and his sons’ sons that shall be born in days to come.”\n\nIliad 20.294-308\n\nNot only did the god of the seas, storms and earthquakes think that Aeneas did not deserve to die for following the poor advice of Apollo in squaring up to Achilles, Poseidon almost seems to think that the line of Dardanus is not fated to be extinguished at Troy. Or at least that Zeus does not want the line of Dardanus to die out (Iliad 20.303-305).\n\nThat still does not necessarily explain why Poseidon himself needed to act to save Aeneas. If Fate was on the Dardanian prince’s side, presumably any god could have saved him, including Aphrodite (although she had proven susceptible to injury when she tried to save Aeneas from Diomedes) or Apollo. Of course, having yet another god acting in Aeneas’ favour, and one of the ‘Big Three’ no less, along with the claims of the coming glory for him and his line only makes him more attractive to the Romans.\n\nThis declaration by Poseidon on Aeneas also contains two other important characteristics of Aeneas. It highlights Aeneas’ piety – “whereas he ever giveth acceptable gifts to the gods that hold broad heaven” (Iliad 20.299), something which could be reflected in the divine aid he received on several occasions. Even his listening to Apollo’s poor advice could be seen as piety towards the gods. He also showed piety in other ways, such as his leading of the attack on Idomenus to recover the body of his dead brother-in-law and in his carrying of his injured father away from the sack of Troy. Pseudo-Apollodorus considered Aeneas to have been pious enough that “the Greeks [spared] him alone” (Ps-Apollodorus, Epit. V.21).\n\nThe second extra characteristic given to Aeneas by Poseidon is that he was “a guiltless man” (Iliad 20.297), and therefore spared the destruction of Troy, which was to be seen as the result of wrathful gods punishing offences inflicted on them by the Trojans (cf. Iliad 4.160-168, 13.622-625, 16.384-392, 21.522-524). The guilt of the Trojans might be the cheating of Poseidon, Apollo and Hercules by Priam’s father and predecessor as king, Laomedon, for services rendered to the city – the gods having built Troy’s walls and Hercules having saved Laomedon’s daughter from a sea monster (cf. Edwards (1991) 325).\n\nAeneas’ piety, his not being a descendent of Laomedon (great uncle/nephew through Themiste and first cousin twice removed through Capys) and the potential that the Dardanians were not tarnished by the abduction of Helen (Edwards (1991) 325) all seem to have shielded him from Trojan guilt.\n\nThis in turn seems him posited as the ‘one just man’ in the Iliad, a trope that appears in other ancient works such as Utnapishtim’s survival of the deluge in the Epic of Gilgamesh, Lot’s escaping from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah for protecting two angels from a mob in the Book of Genesis and Baucis and Philemon escaping the flood of Phrygian Tyana for showing theoxenia towards Zeus and Hermes in Ovid’s Metamorphosis. Of course, Aeneas was not the only survivor of the Fall of Troy, with his father and son escaping the city with him and several other refugees joining up with him to form the group who would settle in Italy.\n\nGiven that he was a Trojan prince, might there have been an element of anti-Greek sentiment in the Roman choice of Aeneas as their ‘progenitor’? The opponents of the Roman state in the 4th/3rd centuries BC included the Greek city-states of Magna Graecia, that is southern Italy and Sicily. Claiming descent from one of the oldest Greek enemies in Troy differentiated the Romans more from the Greeks who had had such an influence on their actual origins and culture.\n\nCertainly, if the Romans had wanted to pick a Greek survivor of the Trojan War, they had plenty to choose from. For example, Diomedes not only took part in the successful sacking of Troy, emerging from the Trojan Horse, he was favoured enough by the gods for his nostoi turn home to Argos to only take 4 days. He then emigrated to Italy, where he became the founder of many towns and cities, including Beneventum and Brundisium. Surely, he would be a suitable candidate should the Romans have wanted a Greek ancestor. Indeed, Diomedes appears in the Aeneid – called “the bravest of the Greeks” (Aeneid 1.96) by Aeneas – as a potential ally of Turnus against Aeneas, only for the former Argive king to state that he had fought enough Trojans and encourage the Rutulian king to make peace with Aeneas (Aeneid 11.282-284).\n\nTo sum up then, whilst Aeneas might not appear in the Iliad as much as we might think given that he receives a Roman spin-off, he receives enough attention to present a multi-faceted character with numerous attributes that would be found attractive to a people searching for a progenitor.\n\nHe was (1) royal, both among the Dardanians and a scion of the Trojan royal family; he was (2) a skilled warrior, capable of defeating or at least worrying some of the best amongst the Greeks; he was also (3) brave enough to show a willingness to take on men he had little chance of beating; more than once he is shown to be a (4) leader of men; his (5) piety towards his family and the gods, along with his origins, fed into his being (6) guiltless and just; his origins were not only royal, they were (7) divine through his mother, Aphrodite, and Poseidon posited that he was in some way protected by (8) destiny/Fate. And most importantly for his usefulness as a connection between the archaic Aegean to ancient Italy, Aeneas was (9) a survivor of the Trojan War through a combination of all of the above traits.\n\nBibliography\n\nEdwards, M.W.
