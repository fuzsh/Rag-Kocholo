        "text": "The new thriller “Contagion” revisits a conundrum that has bedeviled many filmmakers over the years: how do you make a movie about a virus, a villain that isn’t even visible? Epidemic movies have sidestepped the problem by focusing on the aftermath of a deadly plague, as with “The Omega Man” (1971) and “12 Monkeys” (1995), both set in postapocalyptic wastelands. Another option is to invent a disease with outlandish symptoms, as in “The Crazies” (1973), in which the infected turn homicidally insane, or “28 Days Later” (2002), in which they become zombies.\n\nBut unlike many of its predecessors, “Contagion,” which tracks the global spread of a lethal flulike virus, resists the sheen of science fiction or fantasy and instead stresses the chilling plausibility of its nightmare situation.\n\n“It’s an ultrarealistic film about a pandemic, and that’s the key phrase,” the film’s director, Steven Soderbergh, said. “We were looking for something that was unsettling because of the banality of the transmission. In a weird way, the less you trump it up, the more unsettling it becomes.”\n\nWith a large all-star cast (Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law) and a sky-high body count, “Contagion” — which Warner Brothers will release on Sept. 9 — belongs to the fitfully popular Hollywood genre of the disaster movie. “It’s an Irwin Allen movie, at the end of the day,” Mr. Soderbergh said, referring to the so-called master of disaster behind “The Poseidon Adventure” and “The Towering Inferno.” “We’re doing exactly what he did, using a lot of movie stars and trying to scare a lot of people.”\n\nMr. Soderbergh was speaking last month in his office space-cum-painting studio in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, where, having announced his imminent retirement from directing, he will soon be spending a lot more time. Propped against the walls are some of his recent pieces: a pair of striped canvases in red and gray hues and a portrait of the abstract painter Agnes Martin. Mr. Soderbergh, 48, sounded matter-of-fact about the career change. “I’m interested in exploring another art form while I have the time and ability to do so,” he said. “I’ll be the first person to say if I can’t be any good at it and run out of money I’ll be back making another ‘Ocean’s’ movie.”\n\nBesides “Contagion” he has completed the action film “Haywire,” set for a January release, and will shoot only three more movies, all in the coming months: “Magic Mike,” inspired by the actor Channing Tatum’s experiences as a stripper; a big-screen version of the 1960s TV hit “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”; and a long-planned Liberace biopic. It’s a suitably eclectic finish to a more than two-decade career that has zigzagged between low-budget experiments and Hollywood entertainments that are, in their way, no less sneaky. “Contagion” is yet another example of the restless intelligence that Mr. Soderbergh has applied to familiar templates, rethinking the particular challenges of each genre he takes on.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
