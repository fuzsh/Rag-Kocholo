        "text": "The Titans of the title are not the literal Titans of Greek mythology (giants born of Uranus and Gaea). The term as used is the generic 'titan,' meaning \"one that is gigantic in size or power.\"\n\nThe Stygian witches in the film refer to the Kraken and Medusa as titans.\n\nClash\n\nWhen used as a noun, clash can be defined as a violent or sharp conflict. The movie Clash of the Titans refers to a violent conflict between the Titans and the Olympians. The preposition \"of\" does not necessarily mean \"between\" as you seem to be implying.\n\nIn other words, saying clash of the titans doesn't necessarily mean it was a clash between titans.\n\nWrath\n\nWrath as a noun has two potentially pertinent definitions in context of the movie Wrath of the Titans.\n\nstrong vengeful anger or indignation\n\nretributory punishment for an offense or a crime : divine chastisement\n\nThe plot of Wrath includes the Titans striking back in retribution for the events of the first film. Kronos himself makes an appearance in attacking the army of Andromeda with Ares.\n\nTitans, by definition, include Hades, Zeus, Poseidon, etc...\n\nThe main conflict in the movie is between Hades and Perseus, since Perseus is more or less the defender of humans and just so happens to be the son of Zeus, who tricked Hades into being the lord of the underworld.\n\nThe \"clash\", therefore, is between Hades and Zeus, who are both Titans and who have different opinions as to what they want from mortals. Zeus wants admiration and reverence, Hades is more content to have their fear. In a \"see this from 30,000 feet\" aspect, Hades is pitting his Kraken against Zeus' son, in an epic battle to see who will control the mortals."
