        "text": "ENGINEER JOE: Well, he (John Crawford- 1926) went from The Poseidon Adventure into The Severed Arm (1973) which I KNOW you've seen (everyone has) during your high school or college years. That's the one where 5 men are trapped in a cave and they draw straws with the intent to kill and eat the loser in order to survive. Hapless victim of circumstance no sooner has his arm severed than the rescuers arrive. Shortly thereafter the other 4 men are killed off one by one by a maniac who severs their arms. Coincidence? Costars the most underrated of all the actresses who played Gidget, Deborah Walley. John Crawford plays \"Doc.\" From there he went into Towering Inferno (1974) Desperate Women (1978) Tilt (in which Brooke Shields did for the late 1970s fad of flashy pinball what Linda Blair did for Roller Boogie) Elvis and the Beauty Queen (as Vernon Presley) and the studio-released horror film with the most inane name to surface in the 1980s- The Boogens (1982) in which a western town, not unlike my hometown, is overrun by...wellllll....Boogens. His cinematic swansong that was, and I was among the lucky few to pay to see it in its brief run, drawn in by that stupid title and by the fact it was the only film playing in town. His career ended with an appearance on Hardcastle And McCormick in 1986. In short- it was a steady downhill skid after Poseidon although he made at least three films a year each year after that. Had been in films since the 1940s. Went from starring opposite the likes of Janet Leigh and Eleanor Parker and Stella Stevens, to starring alongside....Boogens. That says something sad about Hollywood, 'though I am not sure what.\n\nJim, I also remember two rather campy horror films that featured \"Poseidon\" stars:\n\n1. Shelly Winters in \"The Devil's Daughter\", an ABC TV film that debuted in the mid-70s (when ABC ran the Tuesday & Wednesday night movies); and\n\n2. Carol Lynley, I believe, was in a movie called \"Picture Mommy Dead\".\n\nThose two films I chose NOT to watch in their entirety.\n\nI did, though, get to see Carol Lynley in \"Return To Peyton Place\", the film where she prances down the streets of the small town exclaiming \"I'm an author!!!\", after her book was accepted for publication.\n\nAt least that film had the wonderful line near the end of the film where, after the Town Council overrode the School Board's decision to ban Carol's character's story, and reinstate her stepfather as high school principal (to the chagrin of Mary Astor's Roberta Carter), the official vote was one \"Nay\", by a man who states \"I don't like unanimous decisions. They're not good for a Democracy!!\".\n\nI also remember seeing another special showing of \"Poseidon Adventure\" in 2002, again at the Queen Mary (the film was shown at the bottom of the Exhibit Hall, near where the surviving characters were heading).\n\nInteresting facts: the film's director, Ronald Neame, said \"It's a wonder my dear friend Shelly Winters didn't drown trying to talk underwater\". He referred to the fact that she \"violated the Central Rule\" of \"Only the Director yells 'CUT!'\".\n\nIf Tom Hanks gets cast in the remake, that lesson is noteworthy, as he used that in his film \"Nothing In Common\" (one of the last ones starring Jackie Gleason).\n\nThat night they also had the woman who played the passenger who uttered the line of \"The Purser's right!!\". I can't remember her name, but she said that's what she will be remembered for (she long since retired from acting).\n\nAlso, Stuntman Ernie Orsatti was interviewed, and he admitted that when they filmed that scene, he made a tremendous blunder, wearing white socks, not something one does when attending a formal night on an ocean liner.\n\nYes, they found a pair of dark socks in wardrobe.\n\nBTW, Jim, what part did John Crawford play in \"Towering Inferno\"?\n\nSheila Matthews was the Mayor's wife, and Erik Nielsen was the building maintenance supervisor.\n\nThe other interesting casting notes from \"Towering Inferno\": Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery (for the \"B&B\" serial fans), and \"Bobby Brady\" Mike Lookinland. I'm presuming people remembered Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain, and William Holden in the film, as well as Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones.\n\nAnother interesting thought: Tom Hanks was mentioned as the rebellious priest. Imagine if his counterpart was played as a contemporary, not a mentor; we could cast Peter Scolari as Father John. Tom Hanks & Peter Scolari remained friends from their \"Bosom Buddy\" days (Peter Scolari was even cast in one of Tom Hanks early films).\n\nPerhaps the \"bun lady\" could be played by their former castmate Holland Taylor, if Ms. Taylor is still actively taking film and TV roles (yes I remember her from the NBC series about tabloid newspapers - that was unfortunately cast after Princess Diana's death - and \"George of the Jungle\").\n\nI also thought of another \"Greek Wedding\" tie-in: if Nia Vardalos plays Susan, then the actress who played her cousin Nikki could be Linda; that would be a \"casting coup\", IMHO.\n\nNow \"The $64 Question\": if we could be in a remake of \"Poseidon Adventure\", who would we be?\n\nI mentioned playing the role of the the waiter grumbling about Nonnie Parry singing \"Morning After\", but I'll let another Listmember play that part (this is assuming that one of the ladies here on ET plays \"Nonnie\": how good are your singing voices? \"I'd end up being thrown overboard\" ).\n\nInstead, I can be Father John, but only if \"J.T.\" can be Reverend Scott; either that, or I'm the Captain to his Linargos.\n\nIn the latter casting, I can deliver the description of Poseidon to \"Linda's\" statement, \"So that's the cat this ship is named after\"; no I won't have the statute resemble anyone here, to give new meaning to \"Quite an ill-tempered fellow\".\n\nUnfortunately our characters will still get killed off, \"such is life\".\n\nOkay: who would want to be which character???\n\nRight, I will now attempt this for a third time. Should it fail I will unplug the bloody thing and lob it out of the window.\n\nThere seems to be a pattern developing between the Poseidon Adventure and other disaster movies. A bit like Six Degrees....\n\nJOHN CRAWFORD (Chief Engineer Joe) (b.1926) - played Mr Callahan in The Towering Inferno.\n\nBOB HASTINGS (New Year's party M.C.) (b.1925) - is the voice of Commissioner James \"Jim\" Gordon in the 80's and 90's Batman movies. He also appeared in Airport 75 with Karen \"Twitchy-Eye\" Black and Terror n the 40th Floor with John \"Blake Carrington\" Forsyth.\n\nCHARLES BATEMAN (First Officer Larsen) - appeared in many 80's soaps including Dallas, Santa Barbara, Days Of Our Lives etc.\n\nERNIE F ORSETTI (Terry, Susan's date) (b.1940) - appeared in Towering Inferno as Mike Powers. He was also the stunt co-ordinator on such films as The D.A., Cheaper By The Dozen, Black Knight and Big Momma's House.\n\nORWIN C HARVEY (Falling Man) (b.1926) - a circus high diver by early profession, he also stunted in Earthquake, Towering Inferno and Hindenburg.\n\nLARRY HOLT (Falling Man, again) - also stunted in Earthquake, Towering Inferno and Rollercoaster. I assume he was one of the unfortunates who was mashed flat early on in the film.\n\nDid anybody mention that Sheila Allen was married to Irwin Allen?\n\nERIK L NELSON (Tinkham, Bridge Officer) also played Wes (Untility Worker) in Towering Inferno.\n\nELIZABETH ROGERS (Woman next to Tinkham - what the hell?) - being a personal friend of Irwin and Sheila Allen, she was given the part of Lady In Buoy Chair in Towering Inferno.\n\nDoes anybody know what film Shelley Winters starred in, set on the Isle of Wight about a man who kills his nagging wife? I think it's Something To Hide (1972) but I'm not sure.\n\nCheers,\n\nBoz"
