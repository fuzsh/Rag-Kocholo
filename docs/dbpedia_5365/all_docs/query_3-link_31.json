        "text": "This post is an odd one, the Disney film acts more as a sequel than an adaptation to Plato’s legend.\n\nThe original story is quite short, at least the version I read is. So in the beginning of time, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades seize power from Cronus and Rhea. Zeus gains power over the heavens, Hades of the Underworld and Poseidon of the seas. On the one lonely little island and a married couple and their daughter Cleito. The island is a sparse little place and Poseidon becomes confused as to why they are so happy when they have so little. He falls in love with Cleito and swears to rebuild the island to make it prosperous. And he does, it becomes bigger, more lush, teeming with animals, and they build walls and racecourses etc. it’s all very impressive. They name the island Atlantis after Atlas, Cleito’s oldest son when they crown him king. To ensure peace, Poseidon sets down the commandment that no human shall take up arms against another, whoever disobeys will be terribly cursed. So for many years, the people of Atlantis live by these laws and are peaceful and happy. And as time goes by, they grow more and more prosperous. Poseidon, satisfied with what he sees, decides to take century-long nap at the bottom of the see, figuring the people are fine without him. But over time, the people begin to lose their goodness and instead cheat, lie and steal to the point where Atlantis has become a dangerous place. When Poseidon wakes and sees the ruins of his neglected kingdom and is devastated, for now he must carry out his curse. So he causes a terrible storm and Atlantis is swallowed by the sea, yet the people don’t die. They live in Atlantis still, paying their penance and waiting to be discovered.\n\nCool eh? Now let’s move on to the Disney film. Our protagonist, named Milo Thatch, is nothing like you’ve ever seen in a Disney film; he’s not muscular, he’s not popular or royal, and depending on your taste in men, he’s not particularly handsome. I personally have a soft spot for him. But the point is, our hero is a skinny bespectacled nerd that works in a boiler room at a museum and wants to convince the curators to fund his search for Atlantis, a quest his grandfather had dedicated his life to. The problem is, nobody will take him seriously. That is, until a sultry woman basically kidnaps him and takes him to her employer Mr. Whitmore. Despite an ominous setting, Mr. Whitmore turns out to be a friend of Milo’s grandfather and is willing to fund a massive expedition to find Atlantis. I don’t want to give too much away, since not many people have seen this movie. But that’s part of the problem, this film didn’t do that well at the box office and as much as I love it, it does have a few serious flaws. The first is that it couldn’t decide whether to be an animated adventure or to be what people have come to expect from a Disney film. On the more mature side, it has a truly epic scene where the Leviathan that guards the gate to Atlantis destroys the submarine and kills most of the crew on the expedition. The romance between Milo and Kida, the princess of Atlantis is one of my favourites. It’s very understated, they spend most of their screen time together just talking and exploring together. They don’t even kiss! But the chemistry between the two is just great. The animators tried a new look with the characters that I enjoyed, but didn’t fly with everyone, it’s not the smooth lines and pretty characters we saw in Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast, it’s very rough and rectangular (Milo’s fingers are literally rectangles). But instead of diving in with this new approach, Disney caved into the pressure to throw in the Disney elements where they didn’t belong. For example, Milo literally shouts out “We’re going to rescue the princess!” and in my opinion, they wimped out on the villain. He had the potential to be so diabolical, and instead they settled for the same old greedy guy. Greed is an interesting flaw in a villain when done right such as Gaston, but this guy (and I won’t say who) is just boring.\n\nSo that’s my take, I definitely understand why Atlantis: The Lost Empire flies under the radar a lot of the time but I personally really enjoy it, despite its flaws. If only they had just gone all out and hadn’t been afraid of being too mature. (Maybe the reaction to Hunchback scared them off heavy material?). The original legend however will likely be around forever. My cousin (who has a blog that you can view here if you’re interested http://kylasbookshelf.wordpress.com/) told me once that she thinks Atlantis was a musing by the philosopher Plato regarding whether or not utopia is really possible. But whatever the origins, the legend has struck a chord with many people. There have been plenty of people, like Milo, that spent their lives searching for this lost city. It has reached the fame of the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot. For this reason, I give the original the win because the mystery has entranced people for hundreds of years and will likely last hundreds more. Point original!\n\nOriginal:6 Disney: 8\n\nThank you for reading! Despite losing this round, I highly recommend that all y’all see Atlantis, it’s really underrated! Next up: The Legend of Hua Mulan Vs. Mulan!\n\nCheers!\n\nMichelle"
