        "text": "Hello Everyone.\n\nThis morning (today is my day off) I saw the 10:45 AM showing of POSEIDON.\n\nMy thoughts: right now, save your money. The characters, I thought, were so-so, and the plot rather unbelieving.\n\nWARNING:\n\nPLOT PIECES COMING UP!!!!\n\nPOTENTIAL SPOILERS!!!\n\nIt's somewhat sad when the best part of the film is the initial disaster sequence, with the wave striking the ship, and the scenes of people being thrown around and overboard.\n\nAlso, I am not an expert scientist or geologist, so someone will have to explain: where does a \"Rogue Wave\" come from,? The sea quake story in The Poseidon Adventure was more plausible.\n\nKurt Russell was the Mayor of New York: RIGHT!!! Like nobody would have recognized him earlier.\n\nThe story between Richard Dreyfus and the stowaway: forget about it. Her death scene was anti-climatic: she's desperate to see a family member in the hospital, then is supposed to be symbolizing self-sacrifice in one way. Once she's dead, then that was it for her story. Guess her family will never know what happened to her.\n\nThe person trapped under a heavy prop, with a cut on his leg, yet he's able to walk and swim so well afterwards. RIGHT!!!\n\nI also noted that the impending moments of doom were such that I was thinking \"could you please have the elevator fall\", or the obnoxious person get killed (his death one \"could foresee a mile away\").\n\nWhy were the propellers still operating, after everything else seemed to be out of commission. Also, even when one set is disabled, with a hugh fire/explosion scene, the others go on undisturbed.\n\nI also thought is silly that there just happened to be a life raft handy near the survivors, just as the ship was settling.\n\nEven the ship sinking seemed unrealistic: was it settling, trying to float, right-siding itself, or \"all of the above\"? The ship's end seemed rather comic. Perhaps the producers were trying to evoke \"TITANIC\".\n\nIf one watches and listens closely, you'll see the subtle references to the plot of The Poseidon Adventure, though without Gene Hackman's semonizing.\n\nI was not impressed (though I'm glad there were no terrorists) and will not go see it a secord or third time.\n\nI will, though, look forward to seeing what everyone else thinks of the film.\n\n>>Also, I am not an expert scientist or geologist, so someone will have to explain: where does a \"Rogue Wave\" come from,? The sea quake story in The Poseidon Adventure was more plausible.<<\n\nWell, not really. Rogue waves are whipped up by the weather and more to the point, the existance of rogue waves...once thought to be a mariner's fantasy...now stand as a documented fact. The Discovery Channel had something on this recently and included photos of one such wave a bit over 90 feet high washing over a supertanker which was lucky enough to survive. I'll offer a few links for more information on this:\n\nShip-sinking monster waves revealed by ESA satellites\n\nnswseakayaker.asn.au/mag/47/roguewaves.html\n\nEPN\n\nWaves caused by siesmic disturbances are known as tsunamis. See the following for some discussions on how they work;\n\nTsunami and Earthquake Research | U.S. Geological Survey\n\nAs I'm sure you can see, tsunamis behave very differently from rogue waves. Hope this helps.\n\nI saw it last night and now what I think of this movie which is a remake of 1972's The Poseidon Adventure is well it is much better than that terrible made for TV remake broadcasted last November but it is still disappointing and I can understand John's disagreement with this new remake.Such as how can the propellers that are the bow thrusters be still be spinning when the diesel engines are out of commission or in other words since the diesel engines are not operating how are the bow thrusters receiving the electricity needed for the bow thruster motors? You do need the diesel engines which are geared to generators to generate the electricity needed to move the ship.I also thought that it was ridiculous that as the survivors jumped off the ship through the disabled bow thruster that there was a life raft waiting there for them.How thoughtful it must have been for the movie's director to place the life raft there.My honest opinion is save your money and rent or buy the original 1972 Poseidon Adventure instead.\n\nI thought it was a BIG improvement over the made for TV version that's for sure!\n\nThe characters were kinda weak. Dryfus actually stole most of the scenes he was in I thought.\n\nThe special effects were very good I thought.\n\nAs for the ending being unrealistic with the life raft floating not far from them? That was no worse than the Greek Helicopter rescue team being near the survivors in the original at the exact time the entered the shaft area.\n\nI think they updated the story sufficiently to keep up with the newer ships. But if you are skeptical, go to the matinee and pay the lower admission price.\n\nMy two cents: I liked it. Not a blockbuster, but entertaining enough to kill 2 hours on a rainy afternoon."
