        "text": "1972\n\nDirector:Ronald Neame is famous for a number of films including Meteor (1979) which we showed this term.\n\nBEFORE THE FILM\n\nRemember that this film predates Towering Inferno, so some parallels like the singer singing in the ball room on the ship and the club in the building are reversed in time rather than the order seen.\n\nIt is not uncommon for films for marketing purposes to try to have a \"hit song\" as the title song. This is the case even for disaster movies and as far back and The High and the Mighty (1952), the films \"theme song\" was an immensely popular hit.\n\nAlso be aware that a tidal wave in the middle of the ocean is about a foot or two high, so the idea that a luxury liner could be overturned by a tidal wave mid ocean is ridiculous.\n\nThis is the first of the big disaster movies. Although it is often contrasted with Airport (which we have discussed as to just how much of a disaster movie is it?), it is often compared to that film.\n\nThe disaster strikes early in the film, and much of the film deals with the attempt of a small number of people to escape from the ship. Unlike, Airport in which a relatively few number of people are actually endangered on the Golden Argosy flight, the Poseidon holds a far larger number of people. The number who actually die is much greater than the number of people potentially killed by the bomber on the flight.\n\nLike Airport, Titanic and some of the other films, this film deals with people on an isolated journey. In Airport, however the focus of the film is on the airport itself - virtually a small city vaguely cut off by the snow storm. None the less all the trappings of \"civilization\" are there. Here civilization seems further away. In Towering Inferno there is still a strong connection with the surrounding city. The Poseidon Adventure has a truly isolated group of people.\n\nThemes:\n\nIsolated journey\n\nShip of Fools - group of people basically unknown to one another\n\nReligious Imagery\n\nThe film has been held to have the most \"religous\" subtext of any of the disaster films of the 1970's. although earlier films like War of the Worlds certainly contain religious elements and The Last Wave is overtly religious, although not Christian. \"Tag line\" \"Hell, turned upside down\"\n\nTwo sea stories are well known for their religious allegory - The Flying Dutchman: A captain swears that he will sail around the Cape of Good Hope if it takes forever. God hears him and soys \"OK. it will\" and it does. The second is Herman Melville's classic novel Moby Dick or The White Whale: A story of a ship: The Pequod (stabber of God? - also the name of a tribe of Indians virtually exterminated by colonists). Highly symbolic with incredibly religious theme.\n\nPoseidon - the name of the ship is also the name of a god from classical mythology not only of the sea, bt of storms and earthquakes - a kind of change where the easrt sea and sky can go from being friendly to being inimical.\n\nPerhaps the expanse of the ocean is easily likened to the expanse of the sky.\n\nLeadership\n\nIt has also been argued that the film deals with a question of leadership. What can you say about the nature of leadership in the film?\n\nPhotogrpahy\n\nIn what ways are the themes or ideas of the film handled? What variables are manipulated? camera placement, editing, sounds, music. Compare for example with Kamaradschaft shown this past Saturday with its documentary style, black and white photography.\n\nAFTER THE FILM\n\nReligious references:\n\n2 Ministers - with different attitudes towards religion.\n\nChristmas tree\n\nBoy knows way out. \"And a child shall lead them\" Isaiah 11:6\n\nDefying and cursing God\n\nCompare Flying Dutchman, Moby Dick\n\nDo you think you are God?\n\nPagan vs. Christian\n\nPoseidon (pagan god)\n\nGreece as destination (ancient? place of Poseidon) Also Crete is site of earthquake.\n\nIsrael and Moses\n\nVisual Imagery\n\nAppearance of \"saviour\" from above (Red Buttons)\n\nRescuers seen above\n\nHelicopter take people into sky at end of film\n\nFires and water below.\n\nMinister's self sacrifice immolation\n\nConservative or Subversive?\n\nConservative or subversive film? What does Keane say?\n\nDoes film demand \"order\" or does it \"turn order on its head?\"\n\nMany disaster films are conservative. This one seems to argue positively for religion as guiding principle, but don't challenge or ciriticize God. Film is willing to allow for a \"detached\" divinity and taking action on one's own through the \"God within\", but criticism is dangerous. Scott's downfall begins when he says \"Not this woman\" and then attacks God for allowing them to come \"that close\" and then letting Mrs. Rogo die. He then dies (Moses-like) without getting saved or to the promised land.\n\nNature of leadership?\n\nDo we follow or go it on our own?Should we follow orders? When? Under what circumstances?\n\nWhom do we follow? Is there a question here about following false messiahs?\n\n\"Find God within ourselves\"\n\nShip's officers give wrong directions (stay in ball room) Captain give order against his will for full steam ahead Medical crew is wrong (go to bow) Police officer and minister are two main characters, but other \"forces of authority\" (ship's officers are wrong and should not be followed).\n\nWho lives? Who dies:\n\nSTARS\n\nGene Hackman .... Rev. Frank Scott DIES\n\nErnest Borgnine .... Det. Lt. Mike Rogo LIVES\n\nRed Buttons .... James Martin LIVES\n\nCarol Lynley .... Nonnie Parry LIVES\n\nRoddy McDowall .... Acres DIES\n\nStella Stevens .... Linda Rogo DIES\n\nShelley Winters .... Belle Rosen DIES\n\n==============================================\n\nCO-STARS\n\nJack Albertson .... Manny Rosen LIVES\n\nPamela Sue Martin .... Susan Shelby LIVES\n\nEric Shea .... Robin Shelby LIVES\n\nPeople# who live# who die Number of women = 4; Mrs. Rogo, Mrs. Rosen, Nonnie Parry, Susan Shelby2 (50%)2 (50%) Number of men= 6; Rev. Scott, Mr. Rogo, James Martin, Acres, Mr. Rosen, Robin Shelby4 (66.6%)2 (33.3%) Total People=106 (60%)4 (40%) Number of women - girls=31 (33.3%)2 (66.6%) Number of men - boys=53 (60%)2 (40%) Number of girls=11 (100%)0 (0%) Number of boys=11 (100%)0 (0%)\n\nIs Keane selective in what he chooses to cite? He says \"the weak survive. More men die than women\" Do they? Only by including Arthur O'Connell as Chaplain John. But since he is never in the group that escapes the ballroom should he be counted?\n\nIn the film, one can organize people from strongest to weakest and by sex:\n\nMEN\n\nMinister Scott\n\nDet. Lt. Rogo\n\nMr. Martin\n\nMr. Rosen\n\nAcres (injured)\n\nWOMEN\n\nMrs. Rosen\n\nSusan Shelby\n\nNonnie Parry\n\nMrs. Rogo (ill when first seen)\n\nBoth the strongest and weakest of each category dies.\n\nLiminality\n\nThere are many points of transition in the film:\n\n(a) movement across ocean (ship is in neither continent)\n\n(b) New Year's midnight (not in either year)\n\n(c) Mrs. Rosen in present relives past\n\n(d) Mrs. Rogo in present relives past\n\n(e) pagan to Judeo-Christian (Poseidon is pagan; Christmas tree is pagan)\n\n(f) ship is on last voyage and will be junked (between active and inactive)\n\nTransition moments are dangerous"
