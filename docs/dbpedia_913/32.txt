A bit about us...

The Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre (NAHC) was established to capture Nhill's proud aviation history, spanning more than 100 years. In particular, it's a tribute to more than 10,000 young men and women who trained at the Nhill RAAF Base during World War II.

It's currently home to five aircraft. This includes an Avro Anson (which is almost completely rebuilt), a fully rebuilt Wirraway, an airworthy Tiger Moth, a deSoutter, and an operating Link Trainer (flight simulator). Come and see our collection.

We are open on Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-4pm, as well as public holidays, and we have free RV camping available. We're excited to welcome you to Nhill.
