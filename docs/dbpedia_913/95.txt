Nhill is a thriving country town located halfway between Melbourne and Adelaide that offers visitors a picturesque backdrop. Nhill is surrounded by beautiful national parks. In 1897, a major tornado swept through Nhill destroying most of the town. The post office, built in 1887, survived the tornado and still stands today. The townâ€™s commercial centre boasts attractive parks, and gardens within the median strip.

Short-term parking is available for self-contained vehicles at Nhill Aerodrome, free of charge and has a time limit of 96 hours. Bins and toilets are accessible at this location, and pets on leads are permitted.

Nhill is definitely worth a visit, as the quaint little town has ample events and places of interest. The Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre is located at the nearby airport, and here guests can view displays of aircraft undergoing restoration. The Nhill show is held in October each year and attracts many visitors to town. The show consists of rides, show animals, farm machinery, horse riding shows and numerous other activities, all of which conclude with a fantastic fireworks display.
