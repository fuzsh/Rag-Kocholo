        "text": "The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) is responsible for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the six state-owned airports, which includes the state’s main commercial airport, Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport, and a network of five general aviation airports throughout the state: Block Island, Newport, North Central, Quonset and Westerly.\n\nThe direct economic impact of our state’s five general aviation airports is approximately $37 million. That number expands to $50 million when indirect economic benefits are factored in. Over the past 15 years, approximately $70 million has been spent in upgrades to the terminal and airfields at the state’s general aviation airports. Such upgrades range from apron and taxiway improvements to increased lighting, better landscaping and terminal enhancements.\n\nNewport State Airport is located in Middletown, Rhode Island, and has two runways: one that is just under 3,000 feet and the second, which is 2,673 in length. UUU serves the corporate community and visitors to the year-round festivals in nearby Newport.\n\nThe general aviation airports, except for Quonset State Airport, are nestled inside of neighborhoods. Maintaining a balance between promoting aviation growth and development while being sensitive to neighboring community concerns is an ongoing operations and communications commitment for RIAC.\n\nRIAC recently undertook a strategic business and master planning process for all five of Rhode Island’s general aviation airports. To accomplish this multi-year undertaking, RIAC formed an internal task force comprised of experts in the fields of infrastructure, planning, finance, legal and property management and relied on consultants to help evaluate business development opportunities and potential infrastructure needs."
