In particular, it's a tribute to more than 10,000 young men and women who trained at the Nhill RAAF Base during World War II.\n\nIt's currently home to five aircraft. This includes an Avro Anson (which is almost completely rebuilt), a fully rebuilt Wirraway, an airworthy Tiger Moth, a deSoutter, and an operating Link Trainer (flight simulator). Come and see our collection.\n\nWe are open on Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-4pm, as well as public holidays, and we have free RV camping available.
