        "text": "If you're in eastern Australia, it's been pretty hard to avoid small talk about the cold this past week.\n\nLarge parts of the country faced their coldest morning of the year so far, as the clear skies and icy air caused the mercury to plummet, with several June records being set across Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Melbourne reached lows of 2.2 degrees Celsius, while it was a chilly 7.7C in Brisbane.\n\nIn Hobart, the lowest recorded temperature was 7.2C and it hit -3.3C in Canberra.\n\nAnd temperatures on Monday morning could be colder still for some, according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).\n\nSo, in the midst of this bitter cold snap, where have the chilliest places been so far?\n\nAnd while we're at it, which town holds claim as Australia's coldest?\n\nLet's take a look at the stats.\n\nThe week that was\n\nUnsurprisingly, it was the alpine areas that clocked the lowest overall temperatures during this cold-snap, with Thredbo dropping down to -9C on both Tuesday and Thursday morning, according to BOM data.\n\nThis was also Australia's coldest temperature of the year to date.\n\nBut what about places outside of the snowfields, where cold temperatures aren't the drawcard?\n\nWith that lens on, it was Cooma, a little further east, which was the coldest place in Australia, dropping to –8.9C on Thursday at its airport.\n\nAs for the coldest day-time temperatures, you can spare a thought for the two people that live in Liawenee — in the centre of Tasmania – where the maximum temperature was no higher than 2.4C last Sunday.\n\nIt's worth noting, while Queensland was never going to get a look in when it came to the overall coldest temperatures, it did have the most extreme temperatures compared to what's normal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Williamson Airfield – north of Rockhampton – dipped to a low of 0C, which was 11.7C below its average for June.\n\nTambo and Biloela were also more than 10C below average that day, with their minium temperatures plunging to well below zero.\n\nWhere were records set?\n\nIt was also the coldest June morning on record for some places, according to BOM.\n\nThis includes places in Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland.\n\nSeveral other places have also experienced their coldest temperature in more than 10 years during this event.\n\nSome of the highlights include:\n\nLongerenong, Victoria. Maximum of 7.9C on Friday 14th June — coldest day in 27 years\n\nNhill, Victoria. Maximum of 8.3C on Friday 14th June – coldest day in 22 years\n\nKeith, South Australia. Maximum of 8.9C on Friday 14th June– coldest day in 18 years\n\nWestmere, Victoria. Minimum of -5.7C on Wednesday 19th — coldest temperature on record (data to 2006)\n\nStrathbogie, Victoria. Minimum of -6.6C on Wednesday 19th — coldest morning in 18 years\n\nMortlake, Victoria. Minimum -3.5C on Wednesday 19th — coldest morning in 18 years\n\nStrahan, Tasmania. Minimum -2.9C on Thursday 20th — coldest morning in 41 years\n\nAustralia's coldest town overall\n\nSo, that's where it's been coldest recently.\n\nBut, while we've got the history books open, which town lays claim to being Australia's coldest in general?\n\nIt sounds like a simple question to answer in theory, but there are a few different ways you could look at it, and it also depends how you define a 'town'.\n\nSo, for the sake of a well-rounded dinner table discussion, we've taken a look at a few different metrics.\n\nMinimum temperatures (the coldest morning temperatures)\n\nMaximum temperatures (the coldest daytime temperatures)\n\nWe asked the BOM to look at these for July, which is the coldest month of the year, and across the year as a whole.\n\nBearing in mind there are a lot of places in Australia which either don't have observations, or haven't had weather station data for as long as others.\n\nThe coldest morning temperatures\n\nWhen it comes to the coldest minimum temperature ever recorded in Australia, that title goes to Charlotte Pass.\n\nOn June 29, 1994, it dropped down to -23C at the Kosciuszko Chalet.\n\nOf course, extremes like that only come around once in a blue moon, so if we're talking about a place that's consistently the coldest, it's better to look at the average minimum temperatures.\n\nAgain, we're only going to mention places outside of the alps here.\n\nIn the depths of winter, the place that gets the coldest minimum temperatures is Cooma, in New South Wales, followed by Liawenee in Tasmania.\n\nCooma, NSW: -2.6 °C (47 years of data)\n\nLiawenee, Tas: -1.5 °C (22 years of data)\n\nWhen it comes to the coldest mornings averaged across the year as a whole it's the other way around.\n\nLiawenee, Tas: 1.7 °C (21 years of data)\n\nCooma, NSW: 4.2 °C (44 years of data)\n\nThe coldest daytime temperatures\n\nNow, let's take a look at what's going on during the day.\n\nThis is where Liawenee, in Tasmania, steps up to the podium once again.\n\nIt has the lowest maximum temperatures in Australia during July, averaging 5.6C.\n\nThat's followed by Lake St Clair, in Tasmania.\n\nLiawenee, Tas: 5.7 °C (21 years of data)\n\nLake St Clair, Tas: 7.2°C (31 years of data)\n\nLiawenee also has the coldest maximum temperatures averaged across the year, with Tunnack, also in Tasmania, coming in second in that category.\n\nLiawenee, Tas: 12.2 °C (21 years of data)\n\nTunnack, Tas: 15.4 °C (25 years of data)\n\nBOM senior forecaster Sarah Scully said there was some common characteristics about these locations that made them the coldest.\n\nThat was their proximity to the mountains, and their distance from the coast.\n\n\"[Places in the] plateaus or tablelands surrounded by mountain ranges get the cold air drainage from the mountain ranges,\" she said.\n\n\"And they're also away from the coast, of course.\n\n\"The earth can lose the infrared radiation much quicker and cool down much quicker [than the ocean], so those coastal locations end up, during the winter months, almost being warmed by the sea surface temperatures.\"\n\nIf you're curious about the coldest temperature for each state, look at the list below.\n\nWhat about the coldest capital city?\n\nThe data shows our capital cities have really got nothing on the inland regional areas when it comes to being cold.\n\nBut since that's where the majority of the population is, we've also crunched the numbers on Australia's coldest city.\n\nFor most metrics, that title goes to our nation's capital, Canberra.\n\nDuring July, it has both the coldest day and night time temperatures.\n\nIt's also got the coldest minimum temperatures when averaged out across the year.\n\nWhen it comes to the coldest maximum temperature across the year, however, Hobart wins that round."
