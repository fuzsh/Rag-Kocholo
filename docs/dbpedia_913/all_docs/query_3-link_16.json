        "text": "Over 4,000 visitors enjoyed a spectacular airshow on Saturday April 13th . Planes had been flying all week but on the morning of the airshow they were coming in from every direction, including the DC3 ‘Gooney Bird’ up from Melbourne . Over 100 planes arrived from every corner of Australia.\n\nPaul Bennet's aerial display was, in the words of one visitor, “heart stopping flying, incredible machines and very talented, brave or maybe mad pilots”.\n\nThe precision stunt work kept your heart in your mouth as planes seemed to almost kiss wings and skimmed the ground as if they were mowing the lawn.\n\nIn between the incredible sky jinks, there was time to stroll around the many and varied ground displays, a plethora of planes, a variety of vintage vehicles and a creative collection of crafters.\n\nVisitors to the Crafter's Fair were treated to demonstrations of ancient and new crafts with many of them asking lots of questions and even having a go on the spinners wheel, woodworking tools , and clay.\n\nJane Bunn, Channel 7’s popular weather presenter was a delight as our VIP for the opening ceremony. Other special guests included Borg Sorenson who built our Wirraway , and Tim Bone the celebrity chef.\n\nAngela Stevenson from the Australian Womens Pilots’ Association engaged the crowd with fascinating insights into the history of women in Aviation while her cohorts flew circuits overhead.\n\nThe Pacific Belles were as popular as ever with their wartime hits, and together with the Nhill Dimboola Brass band they made a pleasant break from the thrumming of engines overhead.\n\nMany visitors commented on the warmth and welcome they felt not only at the show but in our town. Everywhere you looked there were happy, smiling faces from toddlers to snow tops.\n\nThe general consensus from the visitors was that this was an outstanding event, with an oft recurring question throughout the day of “when is the next one?”\n\nThe Airshow committee would like to thank the many volunteers who made this day not only possible but such a resounding success.\n\nTRAVEL RAFFLE RESULTS\n\n1st Prize ~ DANIEL GLADDIS, Nhill\n\nSponsored by\n\nJOURNEY BEYOND\n\n2nd Prize ~ SUSAN KORREL, Minyip\n\nSponsored by\n\nCARTIER WORLD TRAVEL BALLAN\n\n3rd Prize ~ WAYNE MADDEN, Dimboola\n\nGenerously donated by\n\nJOHN & JEANETTE McLEOD\n\nMODRA'S APPARTMENTS\n\n4th Prize ~ DAMIEN ARISTIDES, Horsham\n\nSponsored by\n\nTHE MERCURE BALLARAT, HOTEL & CONVENTION CENTRE\n\n& THE BALLARAT WILDLIFE PARK\n\nCongratulations to all the winners, sincere thanks to those who donated the amazing prizes. Everyone who bought a ticket had a special prize they really hoped to win. A big thankyou to all who supported the raffle by buying or selling the tickets, you are the ones who made it such a success.\n\nSmall communities, working together can achieve so much!"
