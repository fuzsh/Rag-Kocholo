Nhill is located on the Western Highway, halfway between Adelaide and Melbourne. At the 2016 census, Nhill had a\n\npopulation of 1,749. \"Nhill\" is believed to be a Wergaia word meaning \"early morning mist rising over water\" or \"white mist rising from the water\".Nhill is the administrative headquarters for Shire of Hindmarsh and residents are mainly employed in either farming or food processing, most notably in grain and fowl.\n\nThe town is home to a community of Karen people.

In 2012, there were over 100 Karen residents in Nhill.\n\nHistory\n\nThe formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Nhill sits are the Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagik Nations.
