        "text": "Mostly dry with warmish days and coolish nights\n\nSummary\n\nNotwithstanding the relatively cool and wet end to the year, Victoria's weather in 2008 was mostly characterised by dry conditions with the clear skies promoting relatively warm days and relatively cool nights. The main influential and repetitive feature of the synoptic weather maps during the year was a persistence of high-latitude blocking anticyclones over Western Australian longitudes. This feature directed relatively dry air over the continent for much of 2008. Towards the end of the year, sea surface temperatures rose steadily over waters to the north of Australia, and allowed for the invasion of considerable moisture across Australia. An archive of previous annual summaries for Victoria is also available, as are summaries for other states and many other climate summaries and diagnostics.\n\nRainfall\n\nRainfall was below average in most Districts, but there were some pockets of near to average totals. The wettest place overall was Falls Creek (Rocky Valley) with 1766.2 mm. There is a map of total rainfall below. There is a map of rainfall deciles below.\n\nMaximum temperature\n\nThe hottest day was 44.1°C at Longerenong on 1 Jan. The warmest days on average were 24.2°C at Mildura Airport. The coolest days on average were 9.0°C at Mount Baw Baw, followed by 9.0°C at Mount Buller. The coldest day was −5.0°C at Mount Hotham on 10 Aug. Some sites had their coldest day (lowest maximum temperature) on record. There is a map of mean maximum temperatures below. There is a map of maximum temperature anomalies below.\n\nMinimum temperature\n\nThe coldest night was −9.0°C at Falls Creek on 17 Aug. The coolest nights on average were 2.3°C at Falls Creek. The warmest nights on average were 12.2°C at Gabo Island Lighthouse. The warmest night was 30.6°C at Hopetoun Airport on 11 Jan. Some sites had their warmest night (highest daily minimum temperature) on record. There is a map of mean minimum temperatures below. There is a map of minimum temperature anomalies below.\n\nWind\n\nThe strongest wind gust was 148 km/h at Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse on 21 Jul.\n\nFurther information\n\nDr Harvey Stern\n\nClimate Meteorologist\n\nVictoria Climate Services Centre\n\nBureau of Meteorology\n\nPhone (03) 9669 4956\n\nEmail climate.vic@bom.gov.au\n\nExtremes\n\nHottest day\n\nHighest temperature 44.1°C at Longerenong on 1 Jan Warmest days on average\n\nHighest mean daily maximum temperature 24.2°C at Mildura Airport Coolest days on average\n\nLowest mean daily maximum temperature 9.0°C at Mount Baw Baw\n\n9.0°C at Mount Buller Coldest day\n\nLowest daily maximum temperature −5.0°C at Mount Hotham on 10 Aug Coldest night\n\nLowest temperature −9.0°C at Falls Creek on 17 Aug Coolest nights on average\n\nLowest mean daily minimum temperature 2.3°C at Falls Creek Warmest nights on average\n\nHighest mean daily minimum temperature 12.2°C at Gabo Island Lighthouse Warmest night\n\nHighest daily minimum temperature 30.6°C at Hopetoun Airport on 11 Jan Wettest overall\n\nHighest total rainfall 1766.2 mm at Falls Creek (Rocky Valley) Highest wind gust\n\n148 km/h at Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse on 21 Jul\n\nMaps\n\nAnomaly in mean maximum temperature for all of Australia\n\nMean maximum temperature for all of Australia\n\nAnomaly in mean minimum temperature for all of Australia\n\nMean minimum temperature for all of Australia\n\nRainfall deciles\n\nRainfall totals\n\nRecords\n\nRecord lowest annual daily maximum temperature Lowest daily maximum\n\ntemperature\n\nin 2008 (°C) Previous annual\n\nlowest Years of\n\nrecord Annual\n\naverage Portland (Cashmore Airport) 8.5 8.7 27 17.5\n\nRecord highest annual daily minimum temperature Highest daily minimum\n\ntemperature\n\nin 2008 (°C) Previous annual\n\nhighest Years of\n\nrecord Annual\n\naverage Horsham Polkemmet Rd 29.2 28.2 50 8.2 Melbourne Airport 27.3 = 27.3 39 9.5 Bundoora (Latrobe University) 28.5 28.1 28 9.5\n\nSummaries\n\nIn this table, key sites have been highlighted to make them easier to find.
