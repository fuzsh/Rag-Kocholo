        "text": "[EDIT – APRIL 2024] This challenge was originally intended to be completed in 2021 however it was derailed for a few reasons, not least of which were the tough COVID lockdowns in Victoria but also some of my own failings. However I’ve left the article in its original form referencing 2021, and I very much intend on completing this challenge at some point in the future.\n\nBecause we’re all having to stay closer to home right now I’ve been missing travelling in my aircraft. I was starting to run out of ideas of places to go that weren’t in another country (or even just in another state) and was getting a little down about only being able to go to the same local airports over and over again.\n\nIt was my wife’s idea to be fair. She was the one who suggested I had everything I need in my own backyard to get me out and exploring again, something to do on those days when I have some spare time and want to go see new places.\n\nSo thanks to her, I’ve set myself the goal of being able to say I’ve landed at every airport in my home state of Victoria before the end of 2021.\n\nFor the purposes of this challenge an ‘airport’ is considered a certified aerodrome by CASA. So I won’t be taking into account private landing strips or uncertified airports. That would make the list too long, and some of them I may not be able to get my aircraft into anyway. So I’m just counting those airports open to General Aviation aircraft with a CASA certification.\n\nKeep an eye on this page to see updates through the year, you can use the interactive map below to see where I’ve been and where I still need to head to.\n\nI’d love to hear any tips or advice you may have on this challenge as well – use the comments field below.\n\nThe Rules (or What determines a ‘Landing’)\n\nI must land the aircraft myself\n\nI must come to a complete stop and taxi off the runway onto the apron\n\nA missed approach or a touch and go does not count as a landing\n\nCurrent status (updated: 26th Feb 2021)\n\nI have currently landed at 23 out of 43 airports = 53%\n\nMap of Victorian Airports I’ve landed at\n\nZoom in and out and click on airports on this interactive map. Green are ones I’ve visited so far, red are ones I still need to land at.\n\nList of Victorian Airports – Table"
