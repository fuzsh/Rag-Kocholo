        "text": ".29\n\nBuilt by N.V.Koolhoven at Waalhaven Aerodrome, Rotterdam, Netherlands.\n\n95 hp Cirrus Hermes III engine\n\nThis was the third F.K.41 built, and was modified at the Koolhoven factory with the modified tailplane and redesigned nose cowlings devised by the Desoutter Aircraft Co for its British production\n\nNV Koolhoven received an order for a new FK.41 placed by A.W Gregory, Sydney NSW.\n\nAugustus F.W.Gregory had been wounded in France while flying with Royal Flying Corps in WW1, returned to Australia in 1918 and went on to a varied civil career as a commercial pilot, flying for Adastra Airways, Butler Air Transport and several flying schools. In 1929 he registered a sales business A.W.Gregory Aircraft Co Ltd\n\n7.29\n\nGregory wrote to Civil Aviation Board, Melbourne on 11.7.29 advising that he had ordered a \"Desoutter\" on behalf of Mrs. F. M.Terry, which would be shipped to Australia. He requested a registration ending in \"BT\" or \"FMT\". CAB declined the request and allocated the next sequential registration VH-ULX28.8.29\n\nRegistered G-AALI Desoutter Aircraft Co Ltd, Croydon Aerodrome, London\n\n28.8.29\n\nFlew Rotterdam to Croydon Aerodrome as G-AALI for inspection by Desoutter Aircraft Co.\n\n29.8.29\n\nFlew from Croydon back to Rotterdam. The original Koolhoven high set tailplane was refitted.\n\nDismantled and packed at Rotterdam for shipping to Australia\n\n9.29\n\nAssembled at Mascot Aerodrome, Sydney. First test flight by Travis \"Tommy\" Shortridge\n\n17.9.29\n\nRegistered VH-ULX Mrs. Florence M. Terry c/- Aero Club of NSW, Mascot Aerodrome, Sydney NSW 2.10.29\n\nAustralian CofA issued\n\n10.29\n\nChange of ownership: A.W. Gregory Aircraft Co Ltd, Sydney\n\n9.11.29\n\nChange of ownership: Allan J. Ritchie, Sydney 5.1.30\n\nForced landing on Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney, no damage. Pilot A.W.Gregory, owner A.J.

J. Ritchie 10.30\n\nRepairs completed and a new undercarriage installed. Test flown Mascot by Guy Menzies\n\n29.5.31\n\nCofR expired. Ritchie advised CAB that aircraft will not be flown for some time due to engine overhaul\n\n11.4.32\n\nTestflown Mascot by F.C. Higginson\n\n14.4.32\n\nCofA renewed at Mascot. Original Cirrus Hermes III replaced by Cirrus Hermes II\n\n6.32\n\nCAB report: ULX is currently based at Cloncurry Qld\n\n8.32\n\nCAB report: ULX is now based at Archerfield, Brisbane where it has been hired by commercial pilot\n\nKenneth R. Frewin and maintained by his business partner, ground engineer Mr. D. Milne.\n\n24.8.32\n\nVisited Mascot, pilot Ken Frewin. CAB inspector submitted a report on the aircraft's poor condition\n\n27.10.32\n\nCofA suspended by CAB due owner Ritchie not rectifying the faults notified to him by CAB\n\n11.32\n\nEngineer D. Milne wrote to CAB advising that the aircraft will be reconditioned shortly. In protesting the grounding order, he stated that during the fortnight prior, pilot Ken Frewin had flown the aircraft from Brisbane to Melbourne return, Sydney return and Toowoomba return. He was criticial of Frewin's lack of care of the aircraft when away from Milne's maintenance\n\n5.33\n\nMajor overhaul at Archerfield completed by Qantas Ltd\n\n8.5.33\n\nCofA renewed at Archerfield.\n\nCAB wrote to Aircars Pty Ltd advising that, after a review, it had decided to reduce the approved\n\nMaximum All up Weight for VH-ULX, the only aircraft of its type on the Civil Register\n\n8.33\n\nCAB report: ULX is being operated by Moxon Motors, Brisbane, flown by pilot Frank Higginson\n\n10.33\n\nFrank C. Higginson, Brisbane wrote a long letter to CAB bitterly protesting their decision to reduce the payload for VH-ULX which he is hiring from Aircars Pty Ltd. He is flying it for his living and the arbitrarily lowered weight limit will not allow 2 passengers to be carried. He has flown over 300 hours in this aircraft and it performs well with 2 passengers on board.\n\n14.11.33\n\nCAB inspector reported that Higginson had arrived Archerfield from Boonah Qld with 2 passengers.\n\nCAB Head Office Melbourne wrote to Higginson threatening suspension of his pilot licence over this event. Higginson wrote a masterful reply attaching his fuel docket to prove he had carried reduced fuel to keep the MAUW below the limit. CAB responded that no further action would be taken at this time.\n\n21.12.33\n\nMinor damage while taxying to the Qantas hangar at Archerfield, pilot Higginson. Quickly repaired\n\nFlown extensively by Higginson, including a trip to New Guinea in late 1933\n\n1.8.34\n\nMinor damage at Coffs Harbour NSW. Repaired and flown to Archerfield 3.8.34\n\n14.10.34\n\nEngine overhaul certified complete by engineer J. C. Carpenter\n\n16.10.34\n\nCofA suspended by CAB because a list of defects notified to Aircars Pty Ltd had not been rectified\n\n11.34\n\nA.J. Ritchie of Aircars Pty Ltd advised CAB that he wants to have the aircraft ferried to Mascot for an overhaul by Tugan Aircraft. The aircraft has been left unattended at Archerfield since resignation of staff\n\n8.11.34\n\nFerried Archerfield to Mascot by J. C. Carpenter\n\nAirframe overhaul at Mascot by Tugan Aircraft\n\n16.12.34\n\nBadly damaged at Mascot when engine failed on takeoff at 200 feet, resulting in a forced landing down-wind. Pilot J. C. Carpenter, owned Aircars Pty Ltd.\n\n(Aircars Pty Ltd took legal action 30.3.36 in Sydney Supreme Court against:\n\n- J.C.Carpenter over the alleged overhaul carried out on the engine that failed at Mascot 16.12.34. and\n\n- C.E.Murrell over his refusal to pay the agreed price for VH-ULX due to the condition of the same engine)\n\n17.12.34\n\nChange of ownership: C. E. Murrell, Sydney NSW\n\n22.6.35\n\nTailplane damaged when struck by the propeller of taxying Clancy Skybaby at Mascot. VH-ULX was parked and pilot J. C. Carpenter was out of the aircraft\n\n22.6.35\n\nRepairs to VH-ULX completed by Tugan Aircraft (same day)\n\n17.8.35\n\nForced landing at Cootamundra NSW, no damage. Pilot J. W. Fraser, owner C. E. Murrell\n\n22.8.35\n\nMinor damage in forced landing at Hillston NSW. Pilot J. W. Fraser, owner C. E. Murrell30.12.35\n\nDamaged at Southport Qld when struck a stump on the beach while joyriding, pilot Verne Cerche\n\n4.1.36\n\nForced landing on beach Diggers Head, Coffs Harbour NSW due engine failure. No airframe damage.\n\nPilot Verne Cerche, owned C.E.Murrell\n\n5.36\n\nCofA suspended by CAB because of the poor condition of the aircraft when inspected at Mascot.\n\nCAB memo to Head Office from the Mascot office: \"This aircraft is no longer flown by Murrell and Carpenter. It has been used for extensive joyriding at Mascot, operated by ticket-sellers and any pilot who is available is engaged to fly the machine. The ticket-sellers have no interest in the condition of the aircraft so long as they can sell flight tickets and spend the profits at the local hotel - an undesirable element on Mascot aerodrome.\"\n\n6.36\n\nChange of ownership: W. T. Fountain, Fountain's Garage, Mudgee NSW\n\n8.36\n\nRepairs to defects completed at Mascot and aircraft test flown.\n\nDuring the routine weighing using CAB scales it was found that the empty weight of the aircraft had increased from 1086 lbs to 1303 lbs, probably caused by heavier wood used in various repairs over the years. This meant the payload was reduced to only 17 pounds (lbs)\n\n14.8.36\n\nTest flown Mascot, pilot D. McMaster\n\n21.8.36\n\nFlown Mascot-Mudgee by D.McMaster, continued to Dubbo NSW for an air pageant where he flew joyrides. McMaster then attended an air pageant at West Wyalong NSW where he again flew joyrides.\n\nHe arrived at Cessnock NSW for an air show but because a CAB inspector was present, did not carry out joyrides.\n\nCAB investigate these events and send warning letters to Fountain and McMaster\n\n9.36\n\nCAB Mascot memo: VH-ULX is housed in Joe Palmer's \"lock-up\"on the aerodrome while owner Fountain is undecided about the empty weight problem. Fountain had spent a considerable amount having the aircraft reconditioned but it is now not a commercial proposition due the lack of payload.\n\n28.9.36\n\nFountain wrote a lengthy letter to CAB pleading for a reconsideration of payload ruling. He needs to carry 300 lbs to operate the aircraft commercially. He had paid for the best men at Mascot to recondition his aircraft. He objected to it being considered the same as the British Desoutters, stating that it was built in Holland and differs from the Desoutters by having a Fokker wing with excellent weight-lifting capability. He is aware that his aircraft has successfully carried a payload of 950 lbs.\n\nCAB internal memos are sympathetic to the owner's plight. They record that Fountain is having cabin fittings stripped from the aircraft and has managed to reduce the empty weight by 100 lbs.\n\nA CAB letter to Fountain suggests he replace the fuel tanks with smaller DH.80 Puss Moth design tanks.\n\nCAB wrote to the manufacturer Koolhoven seeking advice. Their response is that that the original payload would be safe but the undercarriage should be strengthened to a modification plan\n\n11.36\n\nChange of ownership: Wilson P. Milligan & Duncan Knox, Sydney NSW\n\n25.12.36\n\nTurned over on to back after landing on beach at Brunswick Heads NSW. Pilot Donald F. McMaster and two passengers unhurt. He was conducting joyrides and while taxying on the beach alongside the river, a wheel dropped in soft sand and the aircraft tipped over on to its back in shallow water.\n\nRepaired\n\n7.37\n\nCivil Aviation Branch had written to the manufacturer Koolhoven seeking advice on VH-ULX's payload problem. Based on their response, CAB approved payload increase to the originalCofA, subject to the undercarriage being strengthened in accordance with a modification devised by Koolhoven\n\n11.37\n\nVH-ULX was one of six aircraft participating in Captain Mendham's Flying Circus, attending country air pageants to conduct flying displays and joyriding.\n\n10.11.37\n\nCrashed at Condobolin NSW, completely wrecked\n\nPilot Donald Dawson, accompanied by the owner Duncan Knox, was fourth aircraft to arrive at Condobolin for an air display the following day. Newspaper reports state that while \"stunting\" at low altitude over the town, the engine failed and an emergency landing was attempted on a vacant block. The aircraft struck a power line and part of a wing was torn off, before hitting a tree and coming to rest in the front garden of a house. Children at the house and the two on board escaped serious injury.\n\n30\n\nBuilt at Croydon Aerodrome, London by Desoutter Aircraft Co Ltd as a production Desoutter II.\n\n120 hp DH Gipsy III engine 17.10.30\n\nBritish CofA issued: Desoutter Aircraft Co Ltd, Croydon Aerodrome Two new Desoutters were ordered by Australian Desoutter agent Hart Aircraft Service, Essendon.
