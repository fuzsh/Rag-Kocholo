Because of its position halfway between Melbourne and Adelaide, Nhill had the first official aerodrome in country Victoria (1923). Nhill also had many of the early pioneers in aviation land during the period 1919 to 1939. The present air field was established in 1937 a strategic landing field midway between Melboure and Adelaide and shortly after an Aeradio facility was built providing important navigation and weather services for the Melbourne-Adelaide air route.",
