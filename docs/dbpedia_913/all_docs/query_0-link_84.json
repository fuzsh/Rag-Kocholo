So far I've seen nothing to fill me with confidence.. The only change of note so far is having to pre book parking. In my experience there was nothing wrong with the parking arrangement previously.\n\nPost by colford on\n\nFor those who susbscribe to the Temora Aviation Museum newsletters and had advice of the pre-sale of tickets for WDU 2024 opening at 10AM today, already on presale as of 9.15AM. So if you want tickets, book NOW, selling fast! Ticketmaster member pre-sale is tomorrow morning at 9.15AM AEST and general public they go on sale Monday.\n\nCalum, re Airshows DownUnder at Shellharbour, I understand from talking to some people that there were some issues with general public parking in previous years where majority were trying to access closest carpark(s) and they ended up with it overflowing, traffic banking up and then trying to redirect people. Pre booking parking allows them to ensure people go to carparks where there is capacity to have them park and not get turned away or redirected.\n\nPost by 11SQNLDR on\n\nFlights and tickets x 3 secured for Warbirds Downunder for myself and my two lads\n\nMy first trip to Temora and I'm really looking forward to it. Staying in Cootamundra for a couple of nights so will enjoy a couple of NSW country pubs as a bonus\n\nWe will visit the AWM in Canberra on the Sunday and flight back to Perth that evening.\n\nPost by colford on\n\n11SQNLDR, a handy Ando Recognition Chart.\n\nAndo Recognition Chart by Colin Ford, on Flickr\n\nUsually found roaming along the flightline near crowd central, microphone in hand, providing a comprehensive commentary on what is flying and its history, plus getting pilots to relate what it is like flying the aircraft they have been flying. Part of the \"fabric\" of a TAM Aircraft Showcase or major event.\n\nPost by colford on\n\nAustralian Airshow scene for 2024 just got a bit more interesting with Paul Bennet Airshows announcing the arrival of Hawker Sea Fury and ex-Reno air racer 'Sawbones' in Australia from the USA. Will be interesting to see at which Australian airshow it makes its debut. Hopefully it will be joining the lineup for Warbirds Downunder 2024 at Temora in October. Going back a few years since I last saw a Hawker Sea Fury performing at an Australian airshow.\n\nJust checked, what I think was either first or forerunner of Warbirds Down Under, November 2011.\n\nSea Fury Temora Nov 2011 by Colin Ford, on Flickr\n\nSea Fury Temora Nov 2011 2 by Colin Ford, on Flickr\n\nScheme on this new one is a lot easier and interesting for photography."
