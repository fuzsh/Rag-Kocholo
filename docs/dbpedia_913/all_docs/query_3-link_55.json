        "text": "Communications\n\nCommunication systems in Australian civil aviation range in scope and complexity from small operations to large international airports and cover a variety of modes.\n\nAviation communication, for example – that is, communicating with aircraft – can involve wireless radio, flags, flares, aircraft marking schemes and signals among other things. Radio was first used in aviation in 1917 and in 1930 the International Commission for Aerial Navigation mandated the carrying of a wireless on any aircraft with ten or more people aboard.[i] Radio began to be used in civil aviation after World War I. Ultra high frequency began to be used in navigation in the early 1940s. This was followed by a very high frequency (VHF) omni-directional radio range (VOR) system.\n\nThe world’s first control tower was opened in 1921 at Croydon Airport in London.[ii] Australia’s first control towers were built by the Department of Civil Aviation between 1938 and 1940 at Archerfield, Mascot and Parafield using British designs which were also being emulated in Commonwealth and other countries. Communications in control towers were to grow to cover several functions including ground control, airport control, local or ‘Tower’ control (which deals with operational runways) approach and terminal control and the issue of flight data.\n\nPublic spaces in larger terminals have evolved from modern to postmodern places filled with a myriad of communication modes and devices: flight directory boards, intercoms, mobile technologies, signage, visual communication and industrial and interior design. Private working places have undergone similar transformations.\n\nPost September 11 2001 has seen heightened concern in the civil aviation industry over surveillance and inflight communication. In a 2007 edition of the magazine Flight Safety Australia, it was noted that: ‘In these days of locked cockpit doors, communication between flight and cabin crew has never been so important. With most contact between the flight deck and cabin via the interphone, CASA [Civil Aviation Safety Authority] cabin safety inspector Susan Rice says pilots and cabin crew should consider the effectiveness of how they are communicating’.[iii]\n\nHeritage Sources\n\nThis story is well represented in various locations, museums and collections that are distributed throughout the country.\n\nSeveral of Australia’s early air traffic control towers, at Archerfield, Essendon and Parafield, survive today and are nominated in the Australian Heritage Database as places with potential Commonwealth Heritage values. Llandilo International Transmitting Station, in Shanes Park in NSW, is listed in the Commonwealth Heritage List for its role in the operation of international air routes in Australia[iv]. These and other communications infrastructure, such as the Nhill Aeradio Station in Victoria and the Hobart/Cambridge Aeradio Station in Tasmania, are a small part of the remaining historical infrastructure that has shaped Australian aviation and illustrates this central theme.\n\nCollections, museums and archives also hold significant collections relating to aviation communication. The Powerhouse Museum holds important examples of communication systems and radios that were used in aircraft and ground stations. One such object is the pedal-powered generator, which was invented by Alfred Traeger. The generator provided reliable power for wireless radios in areas far from domestic electricity supplies or sources of batteries. Reliable radio communication changed the lives of people living in the rural areas, and was instrumental in the development of the Royal Flying Doctor Service[v]. The Airways Museum holds a significant collection of objects and archival material relating to communication systems used in aviation, such as the Marconi S.W.B.8 HF transmitter, flight service consoles and various HF radio transmitters. Other museums that contain communication materials are the South Australian Aviation Museum (SAAM) and the Australian Aviation Museum (AAM) in Bankstown, NSW.\n\nMuseums, Collections & Archives\n\nPlaces\n\nPeople & Organisations"
