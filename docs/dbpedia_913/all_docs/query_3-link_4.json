Briggs of the Royal Australian Air Force, and landed in Messrs Moll Bros. paddock, a mile east of the town. They were returning from an exploring flight over the Lake Eyre region of northern South Australia, and were met in Nhill by Messrs Herbert Moll, S. C. Moll and F. K. McKenzie, who was intensely interested in aviation since its inception. Lieut. Briggs said, \"Why don't you make this an aerodrome? It is ideal for the purpose and is exactly half-way between Melbourne and Adelaide.\" Today Nhill is not only the oldest inland airport in Victoria, but it is one of the chain of great aerodromes that extends from Brisbane to Perth. Herb. Moll said that he was prepared to grant the paddock at an infinitesimal rental to the aviation authorities. After protracted negotiations by Mr McKenzie with the late Colonel Brinsmead and the Minister for Defence, the ground was inspected by officers of the civil and military departments and the area was ultimately proclaimed a Government landing ground.\n\nNIGHT FLYING DEPOT\n\nIn 1928 Messrs. Moll Bros sold the property to Mr H. L. Bond, who decided to cut it up into building allotments. Mr McKenzie's work seemed to have gone for nothing when Mr I. S. Young, a Lieutenant in the R.A.A.F. in the war, and a former president of the Nhill branch of the R.S.L. came to the rescue and placed his horse training track north of Halpin Park, at their disposal.\n\nMany of the world's most celebrated aviators of both sexes have landed on the aerodrome, including C. W. A. Scott. Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith. \"Battling\" Butler. Jimmy Mollison. Bert Hinkler and Amy Johnson. Nhill was a control station for the East-West air race, and also for the SA. Centenary race from Brisbane to Perth.\n\nMr McKenzie was not satisfied, until he had an assurance from the P.M.G.'S Department that Nhill's claim would be taken into consideration when the mail route for night flying was established - and it has been established - the work of preparing the aerodrome has begun, the wireless beam tower has been erected, also the meteorological station, and the identification tower on which will be placed a flashing neon light. The area of the drome will be surrounded with coloured electric lamps at 50-yard intervals. It is expected that the aerodrome will be officially opened during a visit by the Minister tor Defence, members of the R.A.A.F., and representatives of various aero clubs.\n\nNote: There are several inconsistencies in this report. 1924 August, Glenferness Street Aerodrome complete. 1927 September, Aerodrome transferred to Young and Sutherland’s paddock now known as Blackwood’s on north side of Park Street opposite school, then known as Halpin Park. This was temporary and a paddock to the west of Blackwood’s house became the aerodrome and continued to be used for all events mentioned above. 1937 April 19.

McKenzie of the Nhill Free Press Office, Nhill for the establishment of an RAAF flying training school at that centre.
