We had quite the turnout.”\n\nA 2005 photo by Nathan Clay of Luscombes at Kittie Hill Airport.\n\nA 2005 photo by Nathan Clay of a Luscombe at Kittie Hill Airport.\n\nAs of 2013, the FAA Airport/Facility Directory data described Kittie Hill as having 3 turf runways, the longest being the 3,450' Runway 7/25.\n\nAll 3 were described as being “in poor condition”.\n\nThe owner & manager were listed as Charles Densford.\n\nKittie Hill was said to have 71 based aircraft, of which 13 were homebuilt,\n\nand to conduct an average of 62 takeoffs or landings per day.\n\nAccording to Cynthia Grant, “The number of aircraft - that number has always puzzled me;\n\nI think there were probably 71 hangars & maybe 60 or so flyable airplanes up until a couple of years ago.\n\nSome hangars were used to store non-flyable airplanes, airplane parts, and a couple contained non-aviation 'stuff'.\n\nThe 62 daily operations number was probably true in the 1990s when there was a flight school on the field, but there hasn't been that much activity in several years.\n\nThere is a hangar shortage in the Austin area so the hangars were usually full.\n\nThe economic downturn in 2008 probably gave us an extra 5 years.”\n\nA circa 2008-2013 aerial view looking east at the large number of small hangars on the northeast side of Kittie Hill Airport.\n\nAlso visible are 2 single-engine aircraft, portions of 3 grass runways, and the segmented circle marking.\n\nA 10/31/13 aerial view looking west depicted the 3 grass runways & multiple hangars at Kittie Hill Airport,\n\nbut only a single aircraft was visible parked outside.\n\nThe 2013 Sectional Chart depicted Kittie Hill Airport as a public-use airport having a 3,400' unpaved runway.\n\nCynthia Grant reported in on 1/1/14, “I kept my plane there for 20+ years.\n\nKittie Hill has been sold to developers - it is basically closed as of yesterday.”\n\nA 2014 aerial photo showed a sad & dramatic difference:\n\nevery single hangar & building at Kittie Hill Airport (more than 30) had been removed at some point between 2013-2014.\n\nThe runways still remained intact though.\n\nA 2015 aerial photo showed residential streets starting to cover the site of Kittie Hill Airport.\n\nA sad sight for anyone who appreciates grassroots aviation: a 2019 aerial view looking north shows houses covering the site of Kittie Hill Airport, unrecognizable as a former aifield.\n\nThe site of Kittie Hill Airport is located northeast of the intersection of Ronald Reagan Boulevard & Hero Way.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nPenn Field, Austin, TX\n\n30.23, -97.76 (South of Downtown Austin, TX)\n\nA circa 1917-18 photo of a Jenny biplane at Penn Field.\n\nAs America entered World War I & saw a need for aviators,\n\nmany US cities stepped up & provided facilities to encourage training in the new art of flying.\n\nAustin was no exception, with local boosters jockying to get Army Air Corps training opportunities for the Central Texas area.\n\nIn 1917 the Austin Chamber of Commerce secured options on 1,700 acres south of Austin,\n\nsome of which had been part of the Blocker Ranch.\n\nGeneral George Squire, chief signal officer of the United States Army Signal Corps,\n\ndeemed 150 acres suitable for a landing field; he approved the site in September 1917.\n\nPenn Field was named after Austin aviator Eugene Doak Penn, who died while training in Italy on 5/20/18.\n\nIt was established for use of the School of Military Aeronautics conducted by the University of TX for the federal government.\n\nIt was not until 1918 before planes started landing at Penn Field, and in doing so they encountered several obstacles.\n\nLt. John McCurdy, commander of advanced cross-country & formation flying at Kelly Field,\n\nmade a flight into the field & approved it except for the rocks & cornstalks.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce appointed a cleanup committee,\n\nand on 4 Sundays in September volunteer labor, including Boy Scouts & boys from the Deaf & Dumb Institute\n\npicked up & hauled away 317 truckloads of rocks from the surface.\n\nLt. McCurdy subsequently began bringing in flights of 12-20 planes several times a week.\n\nIn March 1918 the University of TX was authorized to establish a radio school at the site.\n\nThe university took up the option on the land & purchased 318 acres for $40,000.\n\nA railway track was laid to the site, and by November 1918 five brick buildings totaling 168,000 square feet were constructed.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce has insisted on brick buildings since they intended for them to be used as factories after the war.\n\nA circa 1917-18 photo of soldiers training at Penn Field.\n\nA circa 1917-18 photo of JN-4 trainers at Penn Field. (courtesy of Rob Schmidt).\n\nA circa 1917-18 photo of members of the Austin community meeting officers at Penn Field. (courtesy of Rob Schmidt).\n\nAfter the war ended in 1918 the Penn Field site was auctioned off to the highest bidder for $107,000.\n\nThe Woodward Truck Body Company installed machinery there & manufactured wooden truck bodies\n\nuntil the plant was destroyed by a tornado on 5/4/22.\n\nThe buildings were reconstructed, and the Woodward Furniture Factory went into operation in them\n\nand manufactured furniture during most of the Great Depression.\n\nPenn Field was not depicted on the February 1934 Austin Sectional Chart or the 1955 USGS topo map.\n\nOver the years the state of the Penn Field buildings began to deteriorate.\n\nIn the fall of 2000 the buildings were renovated into modern office space.\n\nThankfully, the developers chose not to tear down the old brick buildings, but instead they built within them.\n\nThe buildings are completely modern inside with an aged exterior that hints at its history.\n\nA circa 2007 aerial view looking south at the buildings which remain at the site of Penn Field.\n\nA 2008 photo looking north at the Penn Field building.\n\nA 2010 photo of a fountain at Penn Field which appears to have been constructed of 2 airplane wings.\n\nA January 2022 photo looking southeast at the Penn Field building.\n\nThe site of Penn Field is located east of the intersection of South Congress Avenue & Alpine Road West.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nUniversity Airport, Austin, TX\n\n30.345, -97.71 (Northwest of Austin Mueller Airport, Austin, TX)\n\nA November 1927 photo of 2 Waco GXE biplanes & a hangar at University Airport (courtesy of Jeff Morrison).\n\nUniversity Airport was owned & operated by the University of Texas in Austin.\n\nAccording to the book “Austin, Cleared For Takeoff” by William Ragsdale (courtesy of Rob Schmidt),\n\nWebb Ruff began fixed base operations at University Airport in 1925.\n\nThe earliest photo which has been located of University Airport\n\nwas a November 1927 photo of 2 Waco GXE biplanes & a hangar (courtesy of Jeff Morrison).\n\nA November 1927 photo of 2 Waco GXE biplanes inside a hangar at University Airport (courtesy of Jeff Morrison).\n\nAn advertisement for the University Aerial Service Company appeared in the 8/23/28 issue of Aviation Magazine (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nThe 1929 Rand McNally Air Trails Map (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed University as a commercial airport consisting of a 2,500' square landing area.\n\nThe operator was listed as S.W. Ruff.\n\nThe Airport Directory Company's 1933 Airport Directory (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed University as a commercial airport consisting of a 2,500' square sod landing area.\n\nThe hangar was said to have \"University\" & \"Austin\" painted on the roof.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of University Airport was on the 1934 Austin Sectional Chart.\n\nThe location of University Airport, as depicted on a 1936 TX State Highway Department map (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nAn aerial view looking north at University Airport,\n\nfrom The Airport Directory Company's 1938 Airport Directory (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nThe directory described University as a commercial airport having 2 sod runways in an L-shape:\n\na 3,420' north-northeast/south-southwest & 3,130' west-northwest/east-southeast.\n\nThe hangar was said to have \"University\" & \"Austin\" painted on the roof.\n\nEmma Carter Browning, a pioneer in Austin aviation, and her husband, barnstormer Robert Browning Jr.\n\nstarted a Fixed Base Operation, Browning Aerial Services, at University Airport in 1939,\n\nand trained many thousands of aviators in the years to come.\n\nUniversity Airport, as depicted on the 1940 Austin Sectional Chart (courtesy of David Brooks).\n\nA 1940 aerial view (courtesy of Rob Schmidt) depicted University Airport as having 3 unpaved runways & a building along the west side.\n\nA 5/19/40 photo of an unidentified woman hand-propping an aircraft at University Airport (courtesy of Jeff Morrison).\n\nThe Airport Directory Company's 1941 Airport Directory (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed University as a commercial airport having 2 sod runways in an L-shape:\n\na 3,420' north-northeast/south-southwest & 3,130' west-northwest/east-southeast.\n\nThe hangar was said to have \"University\" & \"Austin\" painted on the roof.\n\nA circa 1942 photo (courtesy of the UT library, via David Brooks)\n\nof unformed cadets undergoing aviation training at University Airport.\n\nA 1943 aerial view looking north at University Airport, from the 1945 AAF Airport Directory (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nIt depicted the field as having 3 unpaved runways.\n\nThe April 1944 US Army/Navy Directory of Airfields (courtesy of Ken Mercer) described University Airport as having a 2,600' unpaved runway,\n\nand also indicated that Navy flight operations were conducted from the field.\n\nThe Haire Publishing Company's 1945 Airport Directory (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed University as having 2 asphalt runways in an L-shape: 3,000' north/south & 2,090' northwest/southeast\n\n[this was the only reference among several directories of University having a paved runway, so this may have been in error].\n\nThe field was said to be a \"class 2\" airport, privately owned & operated.\n\nThe field was said to have a hangar, and the manager was listed as Robert Browning.\n\nBrowning Aerial Services relocated from University to Austin's Robert Mueller Airport in 1946.\n\nThe February 1949 Austin Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) depicted University as having a 3,400' unpaved runway.\n\nUniversity Airport was evidently closed at some point in 1949,\n\nas a 9/26/49 aerial view looking west (courtesy of Jeff Morrison) showed the hangars being reused for non-aviation commercial puposes.\n\nUniversity Airport was no longer depicted on the 1950 Austin Sectional Chart (courtesy of David Brooks).\n\nAccording to the book “Austin, Cleared For Takeoff” by William Ragsdale (courtesy of Rob Schmidt),\n\non 7/21/52 Webb & Myrtle Ruff deeded the 23 acres of University Airport to the Northway Crest Development Company.\n\nUniversity Airport was no longer depicted at all on the 1954 USGS topo map.\n\nThe last photo which has been located showing any trace of University Airport was a circa 1960 aerial view (courtesy of John Lane).\n\nAccording to John, “It shows the University Airport site after closure but most of the buildings are still standing.\n\nThe location is Airport Boulevard at Lamar Boulevard (Dallas Highway back then)\n\nacross from the Jefferson Chemical Company near the International-Great Northern Railway (Southern Pacific) tracks.”\n\nA 1964 aerial photo showed that the site of the former University Airport had been redeveloped.\n\nGalen Blake reported in 2010 about a hangar-shaped building used by Alamo Glass, near the site of University Airport.\n\nGalen reported, “This building has been extensively remodeled on the south half (right side) of the building\n\nbut remains in a more original state on the north half (left side) of the building.\n\nIn the un-remodeled side of the building (north), there are roof trusses and some posts on the side of the building but none in the interior of the building ... similar to a hangar.\n\nI can offer no definitive proof on the original nature of these buildings.\n\nThe folks occupying these buildings are working for their respective companies & are not much interested in talking about subjects other than their own work.\n\nIf anyone wants to investigate this possible connection to the old airport further, they should contact the building owners directly.”\n\nHowever, John Thywissen reported in 2011 that county tax records show this building to have been built in 1945 or 1947,\n\nand that it is located just south of the University Airport site.\n\nA 2015 aerial photo did not show any recognizable large-scale trace remaining of the former University Airport.\n\nAlly Leon reported that Red Velvet purchased the former University Airport hangar in 2017.\n\nA May 2017 photo (courtesy of William Tate) showed the former 3-arched roof University Airport hangar,\n\nwhich

Airport hangar,\n\nwhich had been reused as TX Discount Furniture, after the brick front had been removed.\n\nWilliam Tate reported in 2019, “University Airport... There are at least 2 hangar buildings remaining on North Lamar Boulevard.\n\nOne, the wide,shorter building is currently Alamo Glass.\n\nThe 3-arched longer building was a cheap furniture store for many years.\n\nIt had a brick front added long ago that disguised the shape of the structure.\n\nIn the 1949 photo, this is the one that has 'Service' painted on the roof.\n\nBoth buildings were still there last time I was in the area. Austin is changing fast.\n\nThe chemical company across Lamar in that photo has been replaced with masses of apartments & condos.”\n\nA 2/18/19 photo (courtesy of Ally Leon) of the former University Airport hangar, beautifully modernized as the Red Velvet facility.\n\nAlly Leon reported, “We have completely remodeled the space, and have won multiple architecture & design awards for the renovations done to the former airplane hangar.”\n\nA 2/18/19 photo (courtesy of Ally Leon) of the interior of the former University Airport hangar, beautifully modernized as the Red Velvet facility.\n\nA 12/18/19 photo by Roy Stedman of the former 3-arched roof University Airport hangar, which has been beautifully modernized.\n\nRoy reported, “The 3-arch hangar structure next to the brick Alamo Glass ex-hangar has been rebuilt into an events center.\n\nRoy Stedman noted, “The location is at the intersection of Airport Boulevard & Lamar.\n\nFurther southeast, Airport Boulevard goes past the old Robert Muller Airport & ends somewhere in the highway mess at the Austin Bergstrom Airport.\n\nI believe Airport Boulevard was constructed around or post-closure of University Airport,\n\nbut its location would have been well-known so probably contributed to the name.”\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nHaile Airport, Austin, TX\n\n30.32, -97.72 (Northwest of Austin Mueller Airport, Austin, TX)\n\nHaile Airport, as depicted on the August 1940 Austin Sectional Chart (courtesy of David Brooks).\n\nHaile Airport was not yet depicted on the January 1939 Austin Sectional Chart.\n\nAccording to Austin Explorer, Haile Airport was established in 1939 by Doc Haile, in what is now the neighborhood of Skyview.\n\nThe small facility was on 50 acres & primarily used for general aviation.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of Haile Airport was on the August 1940 Austin Sectional Chart (courtesy of David Brooks).\n\nThe Airport Directory Company's 1941 Airport Directory (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed Haile as a commercial airport having 3 sod runways, with the longest being the 2,800' north/south strip.\n\nThe field was said to have a hangar.\n\nDuring WW2 some GI flight training reportedly took place at Haile Airport.\n\nThe only dated photo which has been located showing Haile Airport in operation\n\nwas a 10/24/43 aerial view looking north from the 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock).\n\nIt depicted Haile Airport as an open grass area with a few small buildings on the southwest side.\n\nThe April 1944 US Army/Navy Directory of Airfields (courtesy of Ken Mercer) described Haile Airport as having a 2,300' unpaved runway.\n\nThe 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock) described Haile Airport\n\nas a 98 acre triangular property within which was a 2,300' x 1,900' sod all-way landing area.\n\nThe field was said to have 2 metal hangars, with the largest measuring 100' x 70'.\n\nHaile Airport was described as being owned & operated by private interests.\n\nThe Haire Publishing Company's 1945 Airport Directory (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed Haile as a \"class 1\" airport, privately owned & operated.\n\nThe field was said to have a total of 4 gravel runways, with the longest being the 2,800' north/south strip.\n\nThe field was said to have 2 hangars. The operator was listed as the Haile Flying Service, and the manager was F. R. Haile.\n\nAn undated aerial view looking south (courtesy of Jeff Morrison) depicted Haile Airport as having 2 unpaved runways,\n\nwith 2 hangars & a dozen light aircraft on the south side.\n\nThe last depiction which has been located of Haile Airport was on the February 1950 Austin Sectional Chart (courtesy of David Brooks).\n\nIt depicted Haile as having a 2,300' unpaved runway.\n\nAccording to the book “Austin, Cleared For Takeoff” by William Ragsdale (courtesy of Rob Schmidt),\n\nDoc Haile had sold his remaining aircraft & terminated operations by the end of 1950.\n\nHaile Airport was no longer depicted at all on the August 1950 Austin Sectional Chart or the 1954 USGS topo map.\n\nA 1952 aerial photo showed houses had been built over most of the Haile Airport site, but 1 (or possibly 2) hangars remaining standing.\n\nBy the time of a 1964 aerial photo, the site of Haile Airport had been densely redeveloped, with only one hangar remaining.\n\nA 1995 USGS aerial photo showed the site of Haile Airport has been densely redeveloped,\n\nwith the only remaining trace being the former hangar (the white building just above the center of the photo).\n\nA 2004 photo of the front of the former Haile Airport hangar, with \"Haile Flying Service\" still faintly legible over the hangar door.\n\nAs of 2004 the only remaining sign of Haile Airport was one of its metal hangars.\n\nThe decaying structure served as storage space for Howard Nursery on Koenig Lane,\n\nwith \"Haile Flying Service\" still faintly ledgible over the hangar door.\n\nThe hangar was constructed of a metal frame with a corrugated metal surface that is attached to the frame with metal wire punched through the paneling.\n\nInside there was a large central area for plane storage, surrounded by spaces used for offices or storage spaces that occupied walled-off areas where the ceiling was lower.\n\nA 2004 photo of the back of the former Haile Airport hangar.\n\nA 2004 photo of the interior of the former Haile Airport hangar.\n\nA 2004 photo of lettering which remains in the interior of the former hangar,\n\ninstructing that all \"Must strictly adhere to Civil Air Regulations.\"\n\nA circa 2005-2006 aerial view looking south at the remaining former Haile Airport hangar.\n\nTwo 2008 photos by Dick Merrill of the front & back of the former Haile Airport hangar.\n\nDick reported, “It doesn't look like the property has been sold yet.”\n\nTyler Kee reported that the Haile hangar was demolished in November 2013.\n\nA December 2013 photo by Tyler Kee of the site of the Haile Airport hangar, now removed.\n\nA 12/26/17 photo by Mike Jankowski of the wooden sign which previously hung in the interior of the Haile Airport hangar, instructing that all \"Must strictly adhere to Civil Air Regulations\".\n\nMike reported, “My friend has the sign from the Haile hangar hanging in his garage/shop in Georgetown, TX.

Field / San Marcos Airport, San Marcos, TX\n\n29.864, -97.914 (Southwest of Austin, TX)\n\nSan Marcos Intermediate Field #30, as depicted on the 1934 San Antonio Sectional Chart.\n\nThe original airport for the town of San Marcos was located on the southeast side of the town.\n\nIt apparently was originally established by the Civil Aeronautics Administration as an Intermediate Field,\n\none of the network of such fields which were established along commercial airways between major cities.\n\nThe original San Marcos Airport was evidently established at some point between 1929-31,\n\nas it was not yet listed at all in the 1929 Commerce Department Airway Bulletin (according to David Brooks).\n\nThe earliest reference to the San Marcos Airport which has been located was in the 1931 Commerce Department Airway Bulletin (according to David Brooks).\n\nIt was listed as the CAA Intermediate Field #30.\n\nThe earliest depiction of the airfield which has been located was on the 1934 San Antonio Sectional Chart, which depicted it as Site #30.\n\nIn 1934 the field was evidently redesignated as Site #31 (according to David Brooks).\n\nIn 1940 the field was redesignated yet again as Site #31B (according to David Brooks).\n\nThe only photo which has been located showing San Marcos Intermediate Field in operation\n\nwas a 10/24/43 aerial view looking north from the 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock).\n\nIt depicted “San Marcos Intermediate Field (Thompson Airport)” as an open grass area.\n\nJames Patton recalled, \"I began taking flying lessons at the old San Marcos Airport in 1944.\n\nI'm sure it was one of the emergency landing fields sited by the CAA, because it had the standard rotating airways beacon.\n\nRagsdale Flying Service of Austin operated the field, which also trained students at Southwest Texas State Teachers College\n\nunder the War Training Service (WTS), a sister government entity to CPTP & others.\n\nIn 1944 my first instructor still wore his khakis with WTS wings, so WTS must have been disbanded a short time before.\n\nSeveral privately-owned airplanes were residents, among which were a Culver Cadet & a Buhl Pup.\n\nFor training, Ragsdale operated one or two J3 Cubs, a Piper J5 Cruiser, and a Meyers OTW biplane.\"\n\nThe San Marcos Airport was depicted as a municipal/commercial field on the 1945 San Antonio Sectional Chart (courtesy of John Voss).\n\nThe 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock) described “San Marcos Intermediate Field (Thompson Airport)”\n\nas a 100 acre T-shaped property within which were 2 sod runways, measuring 2,900' northeast/southwest & 2,610' WNW/ESE.\n\nThe field was said to have a single wood & metal 100' x 60' hangar.\n\nSan Marcos Intermediate Field was described as being owned & operated by private interests, but “used as CAA Intermediate Field Site #31B”.\n\nThe 1946 Haire Publishing Company Airport Directory (according to David Brooks) listed the field as CAA Site 31B.\n\nAt some point between 1946-48 the airport was apparently renamed as \"Thompson Field\",\n\nas that is how it was listed in the 1948 Haire Publishing Company Airport Directory (according to David Brooks).\n\nThe 1948 San Antonio Sectional Chart (according to David Brooks) also depicted the field as “Thompson”.\n\nThe January 1949 San Antonio Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) depicted Thompson Field as having a 2,900' unpaved runway.\n\nThe 1950 San Antonio Sectional Chart (according to David Brooks)\n\ndescribed Thompson as having 2 crossing runways (with the longest being a 2,900' turf strip),\n\nand indicated the field sold gas, and carried out minor & major repairs.\n\nThompson Field, as depicted on the 1953 USGS topo map.\n\nThompson Field was depicted on the August 1953 San Antonio Sectional Chart as having a 2,900' unpaved runway.\n\nThompson Field was evidently (briefly) renamed San Marcos Airport,\n\nas that is how it was labeled on the February 1954 San Antonio Sectional Chart.\n\nThe Thompson Field / San Marcos Airport to the southeast of the town was evidently closed at some point in 1954,\n\nit was no longer depicted on the August 1954 San Antonio Sectional Chart.\n\nIt was eventually replaced by a new San Marcos Municipal Airport, southwest of the town,\n\nand the original airfield was apparently abandoned.\n\nA 4/22/58 aerial view showed an open field, with no recognizable trace of Thompson Field.\n\nJames Patton reported in 2004, \"Reacting to a fit of nostalgia, I drove to that location last year.\n\nThe hangar & beacon are both gone & the area is under cultivation.\"\n\nA 1/31/09 aerial photo did not depict any trace remaining of San Marcos Intermediate Field.\n\nThe site of Thompson Field is located southeast of the intersection of River Road & Old Martindale Road, just southwest of Thompson Road.\n\nThanks to David Brooks for pointing out this

miles southwest of the town,\n\nalong the southeast side of Route 81 (what would eventually become Interstate 35).\n\nThe San Marcos Municipal Airport was not depicted on the 1955 San Antonio Sectional Chart (according to David Brooks).\n\nAccording to a 4/23/84 article (courtesy of George Wilhite), “Lowman Airfield was opened in the mid-1950s.”\n\nThe earliest airfield directory reference to the San Marcos Municipal Airport which has been located\n\nwas in the 1957 Aviation Week & Business Flyers Airport Directory (according to David Brooks).\n\nThe earliest depiction of the San Marcos Municipal Airport which has been located\n\nwas on the 1958 San Antonio Sectional Chart (according to David Brooks).\n\nAccording to George Wilhite, Joe Gafford operated the airport starting in the

Churchill, and the operators were listed as Gafford Aero Repair & San Marcos Aviation.\n\nThe 1964 USGS topo map depicted San Marcos Municipal Airport as having one paved northeast/southwest runway & an unpaved crosswind runway,\n\nand 5 hangars along the northwest side.\n\nAfter the much larger Gary AFB (northeast of the town of San Marcos) had been closed by the military\n\nand became the new San Marcos Municipal Airport,\n\nthe original San Marcos Municipal Airport was sold to Robert Lowman in late 1966,\n\nand the field was renamed Robert Lowman Airport in 1967 (according to David Brooks).\n\nA circa 1950s-70s photo of Lowman Airport operator Joe Gafford with my George Wilhite's Piper Cub (courtesy of George Wilhite).\n\nA 1967 aerial view by George Wilhite looking northeast at Lowman Field.\n\nLowman Airport was depicted on the 1968 San Antonio Sectional Chart (courtesy of David Brooks)\n\nas having a single 3,300' paved runway.\n\nA 5/31/68 photo by George Wilhite of his Piper J-3 Cub (NC70455) parked by the fuel pump at Lowman.\n\nGeorge recalled, “Gafford Aero (Joe Gafford A&P/IA/pilot) was the FBO operator who rented hangars, sold fuel & did aircraft maintenance.”\n\nPeter Maese recalled, “Robert Lowman Airport... AFROTC flight training was conducted there.\n\nI received my private pilots license there in 1970 while attending Southwest TX State University.\n\nTom Webb was the chief pilot for the flight school. Many young ROTC students received their initial license at Lowman.”\n\nA 1973 aerial view depicted Lowman Airport as having a single paved northeast/southwest runway, along with the unpaved crosswind runway.\n\nSeveral hangars were located on the northwest side of the field, around which could be seen a total of 7 light aircraft.\n\nA May 1975 aerial view by George Wilhite looking east at Lowman Field,\n\n“shows the damage from a wind & rain storm from the night before.”\n\nAn August 1975 photo by George Wilhite of a nighttime view into a Lowman Field hangar,\n\n“looking toward the lighted hangar highlights my Cub & Mr. Emmett McCoy's PT-22 (it possibly carried the Navy designation).”\n\nAccording to George Wilhite, Joe Gafford operated Lowman Airport until his retirement in 1975.\n\nThe last aeronautical chart depiction which is available of Lowman Airport was on the December 1976 San Antonio Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Lowman as having a single 3,300' paved runway.\n\nLowman Airport was still depicted on the 1980 San Antonio Sectional Chart (according to David Brooks).\n\nRobert Lowman Airport was still listed as an active airfield in the 1982 AOPA Airport Directory (courtesy of Ed Drury),\n\nand described as having a single 3,300' asphalt Runway 4/22 & a 2,200' gravel Runway 17/35.\n\nLowman Airport was apparently closed (for reasons unknown) at some point in 1982,\n\nas it was marked “Closed” on the 1982 San Antonio Sectional Chart (according to David Brooks).\n\nA 4/23/84 article entitled “Lowman Field closing June 7” (courtesy of George Wilhite) said,\n\n“San Marcos City Council members this week voted to close down Lowman Airfield as of June 7.\n\nThe field had been used primarily by ultralight aircraft for the last few years.\n\nLowman had been closed to the public since December 1980.”\n\nLowman Airport was no longer listed among active airfields in the 1985 TX Airport Directory.\n\nA 1986 aerial photo showed that the outline of both former runways was still perceptible,\n\nbut all of the pavement of the former Runway 4/22 had been removed except for a small portion along the northeast end,\n\nwhich still had a closed runway \"X\" marking at its very end.\n\nThe former hangars still remained standing,\n\nand were apparently being reused for some commercial purpose.\n\nA 1995 USGS aerial view looking north showed the site of Lowman Field to remain in the same status as seen in 1986,\n\nwith the closed-runway “X” symbol still visible on the northeast end of Runway 22.\n\nGarry Mangum recalled of the original San Marcos Airport,\n\n\"It was used for some time after it closed as a general aviation field for the flight of radio-controlled aircraft.\n\nI flew there at couple of events on Memorial Day weekend during the late 1990s.\n\nIt sadly had to close also due to development.\"\n\nThe former airfield was no longer depicted at all (even as an abandoned airfield) on the 1998 World Aeronautical Chart.\n\nA 2018 aerial view looking north shows the site of Lowman Field is unrecognizable as a former airport,\n\nbut several former hangars remained standing along the northwest side.\n\nThe airfield site is located south of the intersection of Interstate 35 & Redwood Road.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSince this site was first put on the web in 1999, its popularity has grown tremendously.\n\nIf the total quantity of material on this site is to continue to grow,\n\nit will require ever-increasing funding to pay its expenses.\n\nTherefore, I request financial contributions from site visitors,\n\nto help defray the increasing costs of the site\n\nand ensure that it continues to be available & to grow.\n\nWhat would you pay for a good aviation magazine, or a good aviation book?\n\nPlease consider a donation of an equivalent amount, at the least.\n\nThis site is not supported by commercial advertising –\n\nit is purely supported by donations.\n\nIf you enjoy the site, and would like to make a financial contribution,\n\nyou may use a credit card via :\n\nPlease consider checking the box to make a monthly donatation.\n\nFor a mailing address to send a check, please contact me at: paulandterryfreeman@gmail.com\n\nIf you enjoy this web site, please support it with a financial contribution.\n\nOr if you prefer to contact me directly concerning a contribution (for a mailing address to send a check),\n\nplease contact me at: paulandterryfreeman@gmail.com\n\nIf you enjoy this web site, please support it with a financial contribution.\n\n____________________________________________________"
