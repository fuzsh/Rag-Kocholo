        "text": "Notes\n\nThe Monthly climate summary, usually published in the first week of the following month, lists the main features of the weather in Victoria using the most timely and accurate information available on the date of publication; it will generally not be updated.\n\nThis statement has been prepared based on information available at 11 am on Friday 2 August 2024. Some checks have been made on the data, but it is possible that results will change as new information becomes available.\n\nIn some situations, some or all of the rainfall is in the form of hail or snow. In these cases the totals given are for the water equivalent: the depth of liquid water that results from melting any frozen precipitation. There can be significant 'undercatch' of snow in strong winds, meaning the true precipitation can be higher than that reported.\n\nAverages for individual sites are long-term means based on observations from all available years of record, which vary widely from site to site. They are not shown for sites with less than 10 years of record, as they cannot then be calculated reliably.\n\nThe median is sometimes more representative than the mean of long-term average rain.\n\nThe Rank indicates how rainfall this time compares with the climate record for the site, based on the decile ranking (very low rainfall is in decile 1, low in decile 2 or 3, average in decile 4 to 7, high in decile 8 or 9 and very high is in decile 10).\n\nThe Fraction of average shows how much rain has fallen this time as a percentage of the long-term mean.\n\nWhere temperature area averages are mentioned, they are derived from the ACORN-SAT dataset."
