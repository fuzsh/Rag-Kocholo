I believe it was built to bring guests to Lupin Lodge,\n\nbut was too dangerous to land there.”\n\nKen Anderson recalled, “We knew it as Ames Airport. I believe it was owned by the Ames family.\n\nHe worked in Sunnyvale & flew to & from work as an executive in the 1940s/50s.”\n\nScott Peranto recalled, “Small airstrip with crosswinds.\n\nI remember hearing of someone landing there & taking the wings off the plane & trucking it down the mountains.”\n\nRegular use of Ames Airport may already have ceased by 1953, as a 1953 aerial photo showed the T-hangar had been removed at some point between 1948-53.\n\nBut the runway remained intact.\n\nThe last airport directory listing which has been located of Ames Airport was in the 1954 Airport & Business Flying Directory (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling).\n\nIt described Ames Airport as a “Limited” airfield, having a single 1,800' unpaved northwest/southeast runway.\n\nRemarks included, “Hazardous, sloping, soft when wet.\"\n\nAmes Airport was not depicted on the 1955 USGS topo map.\n\nA 1956 aerial photo showed the Ames Airport runway remained distinct, but without any sign of recent aviation use.\n\nThe last aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Ames Airport was on the September 1957 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Ames as a private airfield, “Hazardous”, having a mere 1,800' unpaved runway.\n\nAmes Airport was evidently closed, for reasons unknown, at some point between 1957-58,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the April 1958 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nA 1968 aerial photo showed a dramatic change in the status of Ames Airport compared to 1956,\n\nwith most of the runway surface having been removed or overgrown.\n\nA 2021 aerial view shows the northwest/southeast clearing remains of the former Ames Airport runway.\n\nAs of 2023 the county assessor's map (courtesy of Doug Rice) depicted Airport Road on the site of Ames Airport.\n\nThanks to Doug Rice for pointing out this airfield.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nBoulder Creek Airport / Hilton Airport, Boulder Creek, CA\n\n37.153, -122.159 (Southwest of San Jose, CA)\n\nBoulder Creek Airport, as depicted on the August 1943 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nAccording to an article in the 8/11/46 Santa Cruz Sentinel (courtesy of Monte Miller), Harold Hilton built a 900' airfield on his property in 1939,\n\nand lengthened the runway to 1,800' before WW2 stopped further work.\n\nAn article in the 9/7/41 Santa Cruz Sentinel (courtesy of Monte Miller) reported on Gus Zeitler's crash in his Taylorcraft at Hilton Airport.\n\nHilton Airport / Boulder Creek Airport was not yet depicted on the August 1942 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of Boulder Creek Airport was on the August 1943 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Boulder Creek as an auxiliary airfield.\n\nAccording to the article “Hilton Airport above Boulder Creek is expected to be ready for use by Redwood commuters soon” in the 8/11/46 Santa Cruz Sentinel (courtesy of Monte Miller),\n\nHarold Hilton lengthened his runway to 3,000'.\n\nThe 1947 USGS topo map depicted Boulder Creek Airport on the opposite (west) side of Route 236 compared to later depictions, which may have been an error.\n\nThe earliest photo which has been located of Boulder Creek Airport was a 1953 aerial view.\n\nIt showed Boulder Creek Airport to have an unusual configuration, with a single northwest/southeast runway with a pronounced curve.\n\nNo aircraft were visible on the field.\n\nThe 1955 USGS topo map depicted Hilton Airport in a very unusual configuration, with a single northwest/southeast runway with a pronounced curve.\n\nTwo small buildings were depicted on the east side.\n\nThe only photo which is available of Hilton Airport was an 8/13/56 USGS aerial view (from the UCSB Library, courtesy of Kevin Walsh).\n\nIt showed Hilton Airport to have a single northwest/southeast runway with a pronounced curve.\n\nSome small buildings (possibly hangars?) were located to the east of the runway, but no aircraft were visible on the field.\n\nAccording to an article in the 9/10/59 Santa Cruz Sentinel (courtesy of Monte Miller), Harold Hilton sold his airport to the developers of a golf course,\n\nwith the second 9 holes of the golf course planned to encircle the airport.\n\nAn article in the 6/19/64 Santa Cruz Sentinel (courtesy of Monte Miller) reported on Elmer Tunnisen's crash in his Luscombe at Hilton Airport.\n\nThe last depiction which has been located of Boulder Creek Airport was on the June 1966 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Boulder Creek Airport as having a 2,800' unpaved runway.\n\nBoulder Creek Airport was evidently closed at some point in 1966,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the June 1966 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nAccording to the website of the Boulder Creek Golf & Country Club, the second 9 holes of their golf course opened in 1966,\n\nwhich was apparently the point at which the airport property became a golf course.\n\nThe 1970 USGS topo map depicted the Boulder Creek Golf & Country Club occupying the site of Hilton Airport.\n\nA 2018 aerial view showed no trace remaining of Hilton Airport, with the site covered by the Boulder Creek Golf & Country Club.\n\nThe site of Hilton Airport is located at Hilton Drive, appropriately enough.\n\nThanks to Monte Miller for pointing out this airfield.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nHoover Lake Airstrip, Morgan Hill, CA\n\n37.153, -121.445 (Southeast of San Jose, CA)\n\nA 6/11/65 aerial view showing Hoover Lake Airstrip under construction (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling).\n\nPhoto of the airfield while in use has not been located.\n\nHoover Lake Airstrip was not yet depicted on a 1953 aerial photo, the 1955 USGS topo map,\n\nor San Francisco Sectional Charts from 1960/68/71/80/93/97.\n\nThe Hoover Lake Airstrip was constructed in the spring of 1965 by landowner Frank Coit,\n\na colorful fellow from Mendota, CA who made his fortune improving the vegetable production industry.\n\nHis success in farming allowed him to buy 18,000 acres in the mountains for hunting & fishing.\n\nAccording to longtime Henry Coe State Park Volunteer Teddy Goodrich, Coit had the private runway created so that he could fly his plane in & out of the ranch.\n\nCoit brought friends & a few famous people to the ranch over the years.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of Hoover Lake Airstrip was a 6/11/65 aerial view showing the runway under construction.\n\nA 1966 photo (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) by Frank Coit’s friend Ken Newton showing his sons Kenneth & David inspecting Hoover Airstrip's construction.\n\nHoover Lake Airstrip had a single 2,600' gravel northwest/southeast runway.\n\nIt appears to have been a “one way” airstrip in that landing from the northwest & and taking off from the southeast were not advisable.\n\nIt’s named for nearby Hoover Lake which was in turn named for Theodore Hoover, elder brother of U.S. President Herbert Hoover.\n\nKen Newton & his son Kenneth flew with Frank Coit from the airstrip around September 1970.\n\nKenneth remembered that the man who constructed the airstrip, Murry Hopkins, “had engineered the strip with a slight upgrade at one end,\n\nand Frank started the take-off from that slightly elevated point, I guess to get a bit of a running start.”\n\nUnfortunately in December 1970, five years after constructing the airstrip, Coit died in a plane accident.\n\nThe 1971 USGS topo map depicted Hoover Lake Airstrip as a single unpaved northwest/southeast runway, generically labeled as “Landing Strip”.\n\nA 1971 aerial view depicted Hoover Lake Airstrip as having a single unpaved northwest/southeast runway, with no buildings or other improvements.\n\nAccording to Teddy Goodrich, his family sold the entire ranch to California in 1980 to settle his estate, with the land becoming Henry Coe State Park.\n\nThis effectively closed the airstrip since it's illegal to land aircraft in a state park without permission.\n\nBarry Breckling was a California State Park Ranger & spent 30 years working at Henry Coe State Park after Coit’s property had been incorporated into it.\n\nAccording to Barry, there are have been a few incidents over the years involving the closed Hoover Lake airstrip:\n\n“Prior to my arrival [at the park]... a plane had crashed at the Hoover strip.\n\nThe engine & other parts were taken but parts of the plane remained & it kept on being reported by pilots as a possible new crash.\n\nFinally CHP received the report of a crash & wanted to see if it was a new crash.\n\nCHP picked me up in their helicopter & I directed them to the site.\n\nAfter the confirmation that it was the old crash, we went out & removed what remained of the crashed plane.”\n\nBarry shared another story: “I got a report of a plane on the Hoover strip.\n\nWhen I arrived, I saw a man and a woman down towards the lake & there were miscellaneous items of clothing hanging in a tree.\n\nThe man came up to the plane (fully dressed) and I cited him for landing in the park.\n\nLater he went to our superintendent's office begging to have the citation voided. It wasn’t.”\n\nBarry’s journals also include mention of the military using Hoover Airstrip for training operations:\n\n“In the 1980s we started seeing a large military 4-engine prop plane [presumably a C-130] flying near the Hoover strip.\n\nPeople would parachute out of the plane & then after a while a helicopter would land on the Hoover strip & apparently pick up the parachuted guys.\n\nAs I recall, it was determined that they were the Air National Guard & the park superintendent allowed them to continue their exercises but in a limited manner.”\n\nIn a 2/14/88 journal entry, Barry noted: “Lance, the son of a park volunteer, reported finding a plane on the Hoover Strip.\n\nThere were 4 males & 1 child. The men were fishing & drinking beer, boasting that they fly into Coe all the time.\n\nOne of the men at the plane asked Lance if he know what a poacher was.\n\nNot being a bit dumb, he answered something like, 'Isn’t it something you cook eggs in?'\n\nThen Lance said, 'You sure have a neat airplane, can I take a picture of you standing by it?'\n\nThe photograph of course included the plane’s number. The pilot ended up with a heavy fine.”\n\nThe 1996 USGS topo map depicted Hoover Lake Airstrip in an unchanged fashion.\n\nA 1998 aerial view looking northeast depicted Hoover Lake Airstrip as having a single unpaved northwest/southeast runway, with no buildings or other improvements.\n\nA 1999 hiking map (courtesy of Kevin Walsh) still depicted Hoover Lake Airstrip as a single northwest/southeast runway, labeled “Landing Strip (Closed)”.\n\nA 2006 hiking map (courtesy of Kevin Walsh) no longer depicted Hoover Lake Airstrip, but instead showed the Hoover Lake Trail going along the runway alignment.\n\nA 2006 photo of the large metal pipes which were laid down as closed-runway “X” symbols at each end of the Hoover Lake Airstrip runway, with vibrant Goldfield flowers covering the

as the 1965 bulldozer photo.\n\nAccording to Kenneth, he took the photo with the same Leica M3 camera & Kodachrome film his dad used for the other photos over 40 years before.\n\nKenneth noted that to him it seemed a portion of the airfield just behind David in the photo had eroded away – that it used to be wider at that point.\n\nA 2018 aerial view looking northeast showed the Hoover Lake Airstrip runway remained recognizable, with a closed-runway “X” symbol at the southeast end.\n\nAn undated (2020 or earlier) photo of the Hoover Lake Airstrip.\n\nA 2022 photo looking east at the closed-runway

-121.837 (East of San Jose, CA)\n\nAlum Rock Airport, as depicted on the May 1933 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nAccording to the article “An Airport on Alum Rock Avenue?”,\n\n“Right after WWI, many young men bitten by the flying bug during the war bought surplus planes cheaply & established airfields around the country.\n\nThe grain field east of Calvary Cemetery on the north side of Alum Rock between Capitol Avenue & White Road became just such a site.\n\nA young Reserve Lieutenant named Johnny Johnston (or Johnson depending on the source) started it up sometime around 1919.\n\nThe field was located across the street from today’s Orchard Supply Hardware block.\n\nIt was not really an ideal location because, in order to land, pilots had to precipitously dip their planes’ noses after clearing the giant eucalyptus trees which lined both sides of Alum Rock Avenue.”\n\nAccording to San Jose historian Clyde Arbuckle’s book History of San Jose, there was a “huge, widespreading Valley Oak in the middle of the field” which had to be avoided!\n\nArbuckle (an amateur flyer himself) says that the neighbors in this sparsely settled area were “a friendly lot who endured” the dust storms\n\nchurned up on the south side of Alum Rock by Johnston’s propeller wash “long after the novelty had worn off.”\n\nJohnston made quite a name for himself by taking passengers on 10-minute flights at $10 a crack.\n\nArbuckle adds “most of the early aerial movies of the Santa Clara Valley were taken from his ‘ship’.”\n\n“On one occasion, [Johnston] swooped down over White Road & dropped a rope ladder into a speeding automobile\n\nto permit aerial acrobat Franklin Rose to climb from the vehicle to the plane,” according to Arbuckle.\n\nAn even more ambitious stunt involved strapping the casket of a deceased “aviation enthusiast”\n\nto the top of Johnston’s plane and delivering it directly to a cemetery.\n\nThis was billed as the “first airplane funeral in history” – perhaps it was also the last?\n\nBy 1927, the patience of Alum Rock neighbors & worn thin and they sued to have the airport removed “as a nuisance.”\n\nThe facilities were moved in 1929 to a “more satisfactory” site on King Road south of Story.\n\nA 1931 Airway Bulletin (courtesy of Bill Grasha) described Alum Rock Airport as a commercial field located 1 mile east of San Jose & 1/4 mile east of the race track.\n\nIt was described as a rectangular 120 acre sod field measuring 2,646' x 2,250'.\n\nA hangar was said to be maked “SAN JOSE”, and it offered fuel.\n\nAlum Rock Airport founder Johhny Johnston was killed in a crash of an air mail flight in which he was a passenger in 1932 at age 34.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of Alum Rock Airport was on the May 1933 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Alum Rock Airport as an auxiliary airfield.\n\nA 1934 Airway Bulletin (courtesy of Bill Grasha) described Alum Rock Airport as an auxiliary airfield located 4 miles east of San Jose.\n\nIt was described as a rectangular sod field having a 1,800' northwest/southeast runway.\n\nA hangar was said to be maked “SAN JOSE”, and it offered fuel.\n\nThe 1936 Airport/Facility Directory (according to Bill Grasha) described Alum Rock Airport as having an 1,800' runway,\n\na hangar with \"San Jose\" painted on the roof, and facilities to service aircraft.\n\nAn undated photo of wrecked planes at Alum Rock Airport after a “howling storm” in the 2/10/38 San Francisco Examiner (courtesy of Bill Grasha).\n\nThe last depiction which has been located of Alum Rock Airport was on the February 1939 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Alum Rock Airport as an auxiliary airfield.\n\nAlum Rock Airport was evidently closed at some point between 1939-40,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the 1940 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nA 2018 aerial view showed no trace remaining of Alum Rock Airport.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, “Today reminders of the airport are visible in suburban city streets of San Jose's Alum Rock district.\n\nA minor residential street called Pala Avenue is located approximately at the original runway.\n\nThe oddly-named cross streets, Avenues A, B and C, are believed to be named for lettered airport Taxiways A, B and C upon which they were constructed.”\n\nThanks to Bill Grasha for pointing out this

location on a 1941 aerial view (according to Jonathan Westerling).\n\nStanley Hiller was an early pioneer in helicopter development.\n\nHe opened a factory on East Palo Alto's Willow Road in the late 1940s, initially under the name of United Helicopters, but renamed Hiller Helicopters in 1948.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of this facility was a 1948 photo a variety of Hiller helicopters\n\n(including the UH-4 Commuter, UH-12, and Stanley Hiller's original HillerCopter) in front of the “United Helicopters Inc.” plant.\n\nThe earliest aerial view which has been located of the Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield was a 1948 aerial photo.\n\nIt depicted the factory on the east side of Willow Road. A taxiway led toward a curious northwest/southeast runway, short but wide, marked with a large “X”.\n\nThe Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield was not yet depicted on the February 1948 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Tim Zukas),\n\nor subsequent aeronautical charts from the 1950s-60s.\n\nA 1949 aerial view looking east at the Hiller Aircraft Company Factory Airfield (courtesy of Kevin Walsh)\n\ndepicted the Hiller Factory on the south side of a grass airfield.\n\nA 1949 aerial view looking south at the Hiller Aircraft Company Factory Airfield (courtesy of Kevin Walsh)\n\ndepicted 3 single-engine fixed-wing aircraft parked next to the Hiller Aircraft plant (ironic since Hiller only manufactured helicopters).\n\nThe roof of the helicopter plant was painted “Hiller-Copters Palo Alto”.\n\nA May-September 1950 photo of the first US Navy Hiller, HTE-1 125532 C/n 163, seen flying in front of the Hiller Helicopters plant.\n\nA 4/18/52 photo of Stanley Hiller & Netherlands Prince Bernhard flying HJ-1 Hornet N8190H C/n 2003, an early civil prototype of the Hiller HJ-1 ramjet-powered helicopter, at the Hiller plant.\n\nA circa 1952 aerial view looking east at the Hiller Aircraft Company Factory Airfield (courtesy of Kevin Walsh).\n\nThe 1953 USGS topo map depicted the Hiller Aircraft factory, labeled simply as “Factory”, but did not depict any airfield.\n\nA 1956 aerial view (from the UCSB Library, courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) depicted the Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield as having a short northwest/southeast runway, marked with several helicopter landing spots,\n\nand a row of 5 helicopters parked east of the factory on the west side.\n\nThe Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield was not depicted on the April 1959 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart.\n\nThe 1961 USGS topo map showed that several additional buildings had been added around the Hiller Aircraft factory.\n\nIt had also gained a “Heliport” to the east of the factory, along with a short northwest/southeast “Airstrip”.\n\nA 1961 photo of Hiller UH-12E4 N532V C/n 942 (which had been converted to the 4-seat “flying station wagon” configuration with a stretched cockpit) flying at the Hiller plant.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, “From the early 1960s to 1969, its Palo Alto plant served as a CIA cover for the production of the CORONA reconnaissance satellites.\n\nHiller was purchased by Fairchild Aircraft in 1964.”\n\nA 1965 aerial view (from the UCSB Library, courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) depicted the Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield at perhaps its peak of aircraft production,\n\nwith over 20 helicopters visible parked northeast of the factory.\n\nThe 1968 USGS topo map showed that even more buildings had been added around the Hiller Aircraft factory.\n\nHowever the heliport was no longer depicted, and the “Airstrip” had lost half its length compared to the 1961 depiction.\n\nThe last photo which is available of the Hiller Aircraft Company Factory Airfield was a 1968 aerial view (from the UCSB Library, courtesy of Jonathan Westerling).\n\nIt showed a dramatic difference compared to the 1965 photo only 3 years before,\n\nwith all of the helicopter parking spots being empty, presumably due to the facility having shifted to production of satellites instead.\n\nThe 1973 USGS topo map still depicted the Hiller factory, but no longer depicted the runway.\n\nA 1980 aerial photo showed that streets & buildings had been constructed over the site of the Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield,\n\nbut the factory building remaining standing.\n\nA 1991 aerial photo showed the Hiller Aircraft factory building had been replaced by several other buildings,\n\nerasing the last trace of this site of early helicopter technological development.\n\nA 2015 aerial view showed no trace remaining of the Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield.\n\nAs of 2018, street maps show many of the buildings covering the site of the Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield comprise the operations of Facebook.\n\nThe site of the Hiller Aircraft Factory Airfield is located northeast of the intersection of Willow Road & O'Brien Drive.\n\nThanks to Kevin Walsh for pointing out this airfield.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSan Jose Airport (original location) / Pacific Airmotive Airport, San Jose, CA\n\n37.335, -121.836 (East of Reid Hillview Airport, CA)\n\nThe original San Jose Airport, as depicted on the 1932 San Francisco -

Barnick.\n\nThe original San Jose Airport, as depicted on a 1950 map (courtesy of Kevin Walsh).\n\nA 4/1/50 aerial photograph (from the UCSB Library, via of Douglas Bauer) depicted San Jose Airport as having an unpaved northwest/southeast runway,\n\nalso showing the additional buildings which had been built “when airport was part of Civilian Pilot Training Program prior to WWII.”\n\nA circa 1951-52 photo at San Jose King Road Airport, which Douglas Bauer reported is “My favorite photo, showing Gee Bee's Cessna 140A, mom, dad, our dog Daisy, and your's truly holding my mom's hand.”\n\nDouglas Bauer recalled, “My father, Richard Bauer, worked at Gee Bee Aero between 1951-59 at the King Road Airport.\n\nThe airport & Gee Bee Aero were owned by Herman & Marion Barnick.\n\nOur family lived on the King Road Airport in one of the old barracks during 1951-52. I was an airport kid there between 1951-59.\n\nI can recall walking from the large hangar office to the northwest to our home in the last barracks building. Leaving the hangar, you walked past the 'flight office' with it's observation deck.\n\nNext was a larger cafeteria building with 2 adjoining classrooms. The cafeteria had several larger stoves, cookware, silverware, tables & chairs.\n\nIt looked like it was abandoned overnight! At the time, several tables were stacked on each other to make room for a Link Trainer which the flight school used at the time.\n\nNext was a classroom that contained another Link Trainer & randomly stacked classroom chairs. Likewise for the next classroom.\n\nFinally one arrives at the barrack buildings. I can still remember the smell of freshly-cut hay from the adjoining fields.\n\nSpeaking of smells, there were dairy farms at each end of the runway (Cunningham & Story Roads) so when the wind was right, the smell of cow crap!\n\nAnd last, the walls of the flight school office, the cafeteria, and both classrooms were covered with WW II cartoon instructional posters.\n\nThey were humorous in nature & emphasized the consequences of doing something wrong.\n\nUsually some student pilot in a Ryan PT-22.

Note the windsock on top of the small tower cab on top of the hangar.\n\nI suspect that instruction was given from there on tower light signals.\n\nI remember getting a 1940's 'broom handle' style aircraft microphone & an actual tower light gun from the flight office, and play directing traffic from the observation deck of the flight office.\n\nThe instructors were very kind & patient with a 4 and 5 year old!”\n\nDouglas Bauer recalled, “On drag race days we would ferry several of the flight school's airplane over to Reid Hillview airport\n\nand operate jointly from Howard White's Garden City Aero flight school - such was the nature of competition in those days!\n\nIn the 1958-59 time frame, Gee Bee Aero's flight school consisted on one Cessna 140A, two Luscombe 8A's, one Cessna 170B, and one Cessna T-50 (Bamboo Bomber).\n\nWhatever aircraft was scheduled for flight training was flown to Reid Hillview before the start of the drag race.\n\nI loved drag race days because by 1958-59 I had grown enough to reach the rudder pedals.\n\nI would get dual instruction in at least one of the ferried aircraft to RHV albeit a 5 minute flight each way!\n\nNevertheless, I was sitting in the left seat as a 11 & 12 year old!”\n\nA still of original San Jose Airport from a late 1950s movie by Steve Busnell (courtesy of Douglas Bauer).\n\nDouglas Bauer noted it showed “the flight school office with its observation deck.\n\nThere were 2 or 3 white wooden benches on the observation deck, and they were probably placed in the flight office to keep the drag race spectators off of the deck.”\n\nA postmark (courtesy of Douglas Bauer) commemorating his 1/4/59 “Last Flight from San Jose's original airport.\n\nAccording to a document (courtesy of Douglas Bauer), the original San Jose Airport was sold in 1959,\n\nand Gee Bee Aero moved to nearby Reid-Hillview Airport.\n\nA 1960 aerial photo showed houses completely covering the site of the original San Jose Airport.\n\nThe original San Jose Airport was still depicted as an “Abandoned Airfield” on the 1961 Sectional Chart (courtesy of Kevin Walsh),\n\nwhich wasn't even appropriate for emergency use since the airport property had been covered with houses by that point.\n\nA 2015 aerial view showed no trace of the original San Jose Airport.\n\nThanks to Jonathan Westerling for pointing out this airfield.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nValley Airport / Morgan Hill Airport (original location) / Morgan Hill Airmen Landing Strip / Sutter Airfield (Q99), Morgan Hill, CA\n\n37.148, -121.652 (Southeast of San Jose, CA)\n\nMorgan Hill Airport, as depicted on the March 1951 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nThis is the tale of yet another general aviation airport which has been swallowed up by suburban development.\n\nNo airfield was yet depicted at this location on the 1945/46/47/48/49 San Francisco Sectional Charts.\n\nThe earliest reference which has been located of an airfield at this location was in the 10/29/45 Airman's Guide (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling).\n\nIt described the “Valley (Morgan Hill)” Airport as having a 1,700' unpaved runway.\n\nThe 1947 Haire Airport Directory (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) described Morgan Hill's “Valley Airport” as a private airfield\n\nhaving 2 unpaved 1,700' runways oriented north-northwest/south-southeast & west-northwest/east-southeast.\n\nThe manager was listed as Margaret Wissler.\n\nMorgan Hill Airport still was not depicted on the March 1950 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nThe earliest depiction of Morgan Hill Airport which has been located was on the September 1950 San Francisco Sectional Chart.\n\nIt depicted Morgan Hill Airport as having a 2,400' unpaved runway.\n\nBob Hollar recalled, “Dad was a Dodge dealer in nearby Gilroy & based his 170A there [at the Morgan Hill Airport] from 1952 to about 1960 when we moved from the area.\n\nIt must have been built around 1949 or so as it was well established when we came in 1952.\n\nIt was a very active local airport with 6 or 7 wood hangars mostly without doors, and probably a dozen aircraft based there.\n\nNo facilities, everybody kept several drum of avgas in their hangars (can't do that any more).\n\nI can remember many time stroking the drum pump for dad after a flight.\n\nAbout 1957 everybody got together & installed a row of makeshift runway lights down the west side of the runway\n\nand a rotating light of some kind on top of dad's hangar to get some limited night capability.\n\nI think they were plugged into an extension cord to a time clock on the power pole. Not quite 'code' but it worked.\n\nIt was a nice little airport - everybody took turns mowing the grass every couple of weeks, and usually had 3 or 4 picnics every summer.\n\nAs I remember there were some pretty healthy trees on the south end of the runway, and power lines right on the north end road ditch;\n\nit made operations in the marginal weather we often got with coastal fog a bit interesting.\n\nI remember that airport well, I made my first landing there at age 13.”\n\nBob Cannon recalled, \"On a cross-country to Gilroy in 1954 in my Champ I stopped in at Morgan Hill.\"\n\nThe 1955 USGS topo map depicted Morgan Hill as a single runway, labeled simply as “Landing Strip”.\n\nThe Aerodromes table on the 1955 San Francisco Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed Morgan Hill as having a single 2,400' bare runway.\n\nThe earliest photo which has been located of the Morgan Hill Airport was a 1956 USGS aerial photo (courtesy of Jim Unruh).\n\nIt depicted Morgan Hill as having a single northwest/southeast runway, with 5 individual T-hangars at the northwest end.\n\nThe 1962 AOPA Airport Directory described Morgan Hill Airport as having a single 2,430' oiled Runway 13/31.\n\nA 1965 Barclay Maps street map (courtesy of Kevin Walsh) depicted “M.H.

grass strip known as Warm Springs Airport,\n\nto decide on how to form a glider club.\n\nFellows from Ames Research & Lockheed who loved to fly, felt by pooling their money to purchase a glider, they could start a club.\n\nWarm Springs Airport was located at the southern end of Mission Ridge, easy towing & landing when soaring on the long ridge.\n\nWhile at Warm Springs, the club held 2 soaring contests.\n\nSome of the gliders attending the first one were; 2 slick LK’s (Lister-Kaufmann), a swell Pratt Reid (side by side),\n\nthe Ames club TG-3, Les Arnold’s TG-3 Redwing, and Ted Nelson’s

Parkway.\n\nThanks to Chris Kennedy for pointing out this airfield.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nLivermore Intermediate Field / Livermore Naval Outlying Landing Field /\n\nLivermore Sky Ranch / Livermore Municipal Airport, Livermore, CA\n\n37.69, -121.79 (East of Oakland, CA)\n\nLivermore Intermediate Field, as depicted on the 1929 Rand McNally Standard Indexed Map of CA with Air Trails.\n\nThe original airfield for the town of Livermore was located only a mile northwest of the center of the town.\n\nThe date of construction of the Livermore Airport has not been determined.\n\nIn 1929 the Livermore Airport was designated an Intermediate Field by the Civil Aeronautics Administration,\n\n(according to Dan Sebby of The CA State Military Museum),\n\none of a network of fields which were designated to serve as emergency landing fields\n\nfor commercial aircraft operating on airways between major cities.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of the Livermore Intermediate Field\n\nwas on the 1929 Rand McNally Standard Indexed Map of CA With Air Trails (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nIt depicted the Livermore airfield along with the adjacent beacons along the east/west airway.\n\nThe earliest photo which has been located of the Livermore Airport\n\nwas an undated aerial view looking northwest from the 1930 Richfield Airport Directory (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling).\n\nIt depicted the airport as a grass field with an airway marker along the southwest corner & a Richfield beacon along the east.\n\nLivermore Airport was depicted on a 1932 map (courtesy of Kevin Walsh) as “Airport Site 33”.\n\nA 1939 aerial view from the Alexandria Digital Library @ UC Santa Barbara (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling)\n\ndepicted Livermore Airport as consisting of an irregularly-shaped grass field, with an airfield circle marking in the center,\n\nand a few small buildings on the northeast side.\n\nThe 1940 USGS topo map depicted the “Livermore Airport” as an outlined area.\n\nNo buildings were depicted within the outlined area,\n\nbut one small building was depicted along the southern edge of the property.\n\nThe December 1941 San Francisco Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) depicted Livermore Intermediate Field as Site 33 along the Airway.\n\nAccording to Dan Sebby (of The CA State Military Museum), “On 3/24/42 the Navy Department acquired the 111 acres of the Livermore CAA Intermediate Field\n\nthrough Federal condemnation against the airport owner, James Anderson.\n\nThe airport was commissioned as Outlying Field Livermore.\n\nOn 11/27/42, the site was expanded by 150 acres, which was acquired through the Federal condemnation process against Gandolfo Gudetti.\n\nThis acquisition allowed for a north/south runway.”\n\nDan continued, “OLF Livermore supported the training at NAS Livermore by providing an emergency airfield for the student pilots\n\nas well as providing an 'off-site' location for training.\n\nOLF Livermore was one of 12 OLFs that surrounded NAS Livermore.\n\nDuring this period the primary aircraft using OLF Livermore would have been the Stearman N2S Kaydet,\n\nthe Naval Air Factory N3N 'Yellow Peril', and the Timm N2T Tudor primary training aircraft.”\n\nA 1943 U.S. Navy Plan of “Outlying Field 'L', Livermore Intermediate” (courtesy of Brian Rehwinkel)\n\nindicated the field was attached to NAS Oakland, and consisted of 261 acres owned by the U.S. Government.\n\nThe field was depicted as an irregularly-shaped property within which was a single unpaved 3,700' east/west runway.\n\nAn information sheet described the runway as heavy sod & gravel,\n\nand noted “Construction now in progress, caution advised.”\n\nThe 1945 Army-Navy Directory of Airfields (according to Dan Sebby of The CA State Military Museum)\n\ndescribed OLF Livermore as having 2 sod & gravel runways (4,000' north/south & 3,7'' east/west)\n\nand that no fuel or oil storage existed on-site.\n\nAccording to Dan Sebby (of The CA State Military Museum), “After NAS Livermore transitioned\n\nfrom being a pilot training installation to being a deployment staging area for Carrier Air Groups,\n\ncarrier type aircraft such as F6F Hellcat, F7F Tigercat, and F4U Corsair fighters,\n\nTBM Avenger torpedo bombers, and SB2C Helldiver dive bombers\n\nwould have used the site for emergency landings & for overflow staging when the main base reached capacity.”\n\nThe March 1945 San Francisco Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy) depicted the field as “Livermore (Navy)”.\n\nThe 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock) depicted the “Livermore Naval Air Station Auxiliary (27704 Livermore Intermediate Field)”\n\nas a 260 acre field within which were 2 gravel & sod runways, measuring 4,000' north/south & 3,700' east/west.\n\nThe field was said to have no hangars or services.\n\nAccording to Dan Sebby (of The CA State Military Museum), “After World War II,\n\nNAS Livermore operated as a home for Naval Reserve aircraft until 1950,\n\nwhen that installation [NAS Livermore] was transferred to the Atomic Energy Commission.\n\nThis transfer resulted in all of the remaining OLFs associated with NAS Livermore becoming surplus to the needs of the U.S. Navy.”\n\nHowever, the date at which the Livermore OLF was evidently relinquished for civilian use may have been somewhat earlier,\n\nas it was depicted as a civilian airfield (“Livermore Sky Ranch”)\n\non the March 1949 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nIt depicted the field as having a 4,000' unpaved runway.\n\nA 1949 aerial view depicted the Livermore Airport as having 2 grass runways,\n\nwith the word “Livermore” marked in large letters on the north side of the east/west runway.\n\nThree small hangars were located on the northeast side of the field, around which were visible 3 light aircraft.\n\nAn August 1952 GSA “Supplement to Report of Excess Real Property” (according to Dan Sebby of The CA State Military Museum)\n\ndescribed the facilities at OLF Livermore as including:\n\n4,000' gravel runway, 3,700' sod runway, 3 hangars, wood-frame flight operations building,\n\nwood-frame line shack, and a 51' high steel beacon tower.\n\nAccording to Dan Sebby (of The CA State Military Museum), “The General Services Administration quit-claimed the site to the City of Livermore on 10/22/53.\n\nStarting in 1953, the City of Livermore operated the site as an airfield. The airport was then known as the Livermore Sky Ranch.”\n\nThe 1953 USGS topo map labeled the field both as “Naval Auxiliary Air Field (Inactive)” & “Livermore Sky Ranch”.\n\nSeveral small buildings were depicted on the northeast side of the property, and an Airway Beacon was depicted on the east side.\n\nA 1958 aerial view (from the Alexandria Digital Library @ UC Santa Barbara, courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) depicted Livermore Airport as a very popular field,\n\nwith over 30 aircraft parked on the northeast side.\n\nThe April 1959 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Paul Columbus)\n\ndepicted Livermore Sky Ranch as having a 4,000' unpaved runway.\n\nThe 1961 USGS topo map labeled the field as “Municipal Airport”.\n\nA single east/west runway was depicted, with a taxiway leading to a ramp with several small buildings on the northeast side of the property.\n\nThe Beacon was depicted on the east side.\n\nThe 1964 Jeppesen Pilot's Guide (courtesy of Chris Kennedy)\n\ndepicted the Livermore Municipal Airport as having a single 4,000' unpaved east/west runway,\n\nwith 2 taxiways leading to several small buildings (hangars?) on the north side of the field.\n\nThe beacon was depicted on the southeast corner of the property.\n\nA 1965 aerial view (from the Alexandria Digital Library @ UC Santa Barbara, courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) depicted Livermore Airport as a very popular field,\n\nwith several dozen aircraft parked on the north & east sides, including a Douglas DC-3 airliner.\n\nThe last aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of the original Livermore Airport\n\nwas on the June 1965 San Francisco Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nIt depicted Livermore as having a 4,000' unpaved runway.\n\nDan continued, “In December 1965 the site was developed for residential use\n\nand Livermore Municipal Airport was opened approximately 1 mile west of former Livermore OLF.”\n\nHowever, the date of closure of the original Livermore Airport may have been a few months later,\n\nas a 1966 aerial photo still showed at least 4 single-engine aircraft visible on the field.\n\nHousing was crowded around the northern edges of the property, but the airfield area was still completely intact.\n\nThe original Livermore Airport was no longer depicted on the June 1966 San Francisco Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy).\n\nIt instead depicted the new Livermore Airport, which had been constructed a mile to the west of the original field.\n\nA 1979 aerial view showed that housing had covered the site of the original Livermore Airport.\n\nA 2006 aerial view showed no remaining recognizable trace of the former Livermore OLF.\n\nDan Sebby (of The CA State Military Museum) reported in 2007, “The site currently contains hundreds of residential lots, an elementary school, and 2 parks owned by the City of Livermore.”\n\nThe site of the original Livermore Airport is located southwest of the intersection of North Murrieta Boulevard & East Airway Boulevard, appropriately enough.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSanta Clara Valley Airport, Santa Clara, CA\n\n37.39, -121.99 (Northwest of San Jose, CA)\n\nA 1948 aerial view depicted the Santa Clara Valley Airport as having a single northwest/southeast paved runway.\n\nJust after World War II, 10 investors bought 250 acres in Lakewood Village\n\nand built the Santa Clara Valley Airport (according to the Lakewood Village Neighborhood Association).\n\nThe land was graded for a single runway with a parallel taxiway & a ramp on the west side,\n\nand a single hangar was constructed with a mechanic’s shop & a small office.\n\nGeorge Brown recalled, “One of the 10 investors who started the Santa Clara Valley Airport was my grandfather, Walter Brown.\n\nAs a kid I clearly remember my father, George Brown, taking me out to the airport - to go flying, talk to others, etc.\n\nHe was a WW2 fighter pilot in the Pacific Theater. Eventually he bought a Stinson Station Wagon which he complexly restored.\n\nI believe that the field support crop dusters in it's days.\n\nWe had a small concrete pad halfway down the main strip to load the planes - they would land at the threshold, get off at the pad,\n\nthen get back on & use the rest of the runway for take off - a far cry from today.\n\nEventually we graded a dirt strip on Lafayette Street just north of Agnew & the crop dusters worked from there.\n\nWayne Clevengar owned the company - flying old Stinson observation planes from WW2, with a second (lower) wing added & repowered with big radial engines.\n\nCrop duster operations eventually moved to the San Jose Muni Airport.”\n\nNo airfield at this location was depicted on the February 1948 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Tim Zukas).\n\nThe earliest chart depiction of the Santa Clara Valley Airport which has been located was a 1948 aerial view.\n\nIt depicted the field as having a single northwest/southeast paved runway with a parallel taxiway.\n\nThree hangars were located on the west side of the field, around which were parked a dozen light aircraft.\n\nThe earliest chart depiction of the Santa Clara Valley Airport which has been located\n\nwas on the March 1949 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nIt depicted the field as having a 3,000' hard-surface runway.\n\nA circa late 1940s - early 1950s aerial photo looking northwest (courtesy of Arleigh Movitz),\n\nshowing the relationship of the Santa Clara Valley Airport (lower-left) to

(courtesy of Arleigh Movitz).\n\nAn undated aerial view looking north at Santa Clara Valley Airport in the 1950 Air Photo Guide (courtesy of Kevin Walsh).\n\nThe guide described Santa Clara Valley Airport as having a 2,900' hard surface runway, and listed the manager as Robert Liddell.\n\nAn advertisement for Santa Clara Valley Airport from the 1950 Air Photo Guide (courtesy of Kevin Walsh).\n\nThe 1952 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling)\n\ndepicted the Santa Clara Valley Airport as having a 3,000' paved runway.\n\nThe 1953 USGS topo map depicted Santa Clara Valley Airport as having a single 2,000' runway,\n\nwith a parallel taxiway on the southwest side, and a total of four buildings (hangars?) along the west side of the field.\n\nThe Aerodromes table on the September 1954 San Francisco USAF Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy)\n\ndescribed the Santa Clara Valley Airport as having a single 3,000' bituminous runway.\n\nUnfortunately, less than a decade after it had opened, the life of the Santa Clara Valley Airport started to draw to a close.\n\nIn 1954 the City of Sunnyvale launched a plan to annex 129 acres from the County,\n\nincluding the airport property, at the northeast corner of Lawrence Station Road & Bayshore Highway.\n\nThis annexation was intended to enable development of the property, and it took place the following year.\n\nThe 1955 USGS topo map depicted the Santa Clara Valley Airport in an identical fashion as on the 1953 topo map.\n\nIn what would become a common story for many post-WW2 general aviation airports,\n\nthe land of the Santa Clara Valley Airport was sold for development in 1955, and the airport presumably closed in the same year.\n\nAlthough the Santa Clara Valley Airport was still depicted\n\non the March 1955 San Francisco Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy),\n\nthe Aerodromes table said that the field was already \"Closed to all operations.\"\n\nThe runway length had already been reduced somewhat,\n\nas it was described as a single 2,100' bituminous strip with a total of 2,900' available.\n\nThe Oakmead Fire Station occupied a former Santa Clara Valley Airport hangar (donated by Arthur Monte) for one year,\n\nuntil a replacement station was built.\n\nBy the time of the March 1956 San Francisco Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy),\n\nSanta Clara Valley Airport was no longer depicted at all.\n\nA 1956 aerial view (from the Alexandria Digital Library @ UCSB, courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) showed that the site of Santa Clara Valley Airport had already been covered by housing.\n\nHowever the former hangar (used by the Fire Department) still remained at the site (just below the center of the picture).\n\nAccording to Rick Turner, “After the Sunnyvale Fire Department was through with it,\n\nMike Coutches purchased the hangar, dismantled it & moved it to the Hayward Airport.\n\nSince 1958 the former Santa Clara Valley Airport hanger has been use by Mike's American Aircraft Sales at Hayward.”\n\nBy the time of the 1961 USGS topo map, Santa Clara Valley Airport had been replaced by a network of new residential streets & the Fairwood School.\n\nA 1965 aerial view (from the Alexandria Digital Library @ UCSB, courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) showed that the site of Santa Clara Valley Airport had been further covered by housing,\n\nbut the foundation of the former hangar still remained (just below the center of the picture).\n\nA 1968 aerial view showed no remaining trace of the Santa Clara Valley Airport.\n\nAs seen in the February 2004 USGS aerial photo, not a trace appears to remain of Santa Clara Valley Airport.\n\nA 2007 photo (courtesy of Rick Turner) of the former Santa Clara Valley Airport hangar,\n\nas it has been reused as American Aircraft Sales at the Hayward Airport.\n\nThe site of Santa Clara Valley Airport is located northeast of the intersection of Interstate 101 & the North Lawrence Expressway.\n\nThanks to Arleigh Movitz for pointing out this airfield.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nParks AFB, Dublin, CA\n\n37.73, -121.9 (East of Oakland, CA)\n\nA 1946 aerial view depicted Camp Parks as having 2 dirt runways.\n\nNo airfield was yet depicted at this location on a 1939 aerial photo.\n\nCamp Parks was built as Navy Base during WW2, and was commissioned in 1943 as home to the Navy Seabees.\n\nAt some point between 1943-46 an airfield was constructed on the north side of Camp Parks.\n\nThe earliest depiction which has been located of the Camp Parks airfield was a 1946 aerial view, which depicted Camp Parks as having 2 dirt runways.\n\nNo aeronautical charts have been located which depicted the Camp Parks airfield.\n\nCamp Parks was disestablished by the Navy in 1946.\n\nIn 1951, the Navy reacquired control of most of the land, and transferred the property to the Air Force.\n\nAlthough construction of Air Force facilities began in 1951, the official transfer of ownership did not occur until 1953.\n\nThe facility was renamed Parks Air Force Base & functioned as a basic training center, overseas replacement depot,\n\nand air base defense training area during the Korean War.\n\nAn 11/14/51 preliminary master plan (courtesy of Ron Plant) depicted 2 unpaved runways at Parks AFB.\n\nRon Plante observed, “The smaller northwest/southeast runway is marked 'Abandoned Navy air strip (grass top)'.\n\nIt’s my guess this was built during WWII to transport patients of the Camp Shoemaker Naval Hospital, about 2 miles to the southeast.\n\nThe longer east/west runway is marked 'Proposed 7,000’ grass top mock landing strip',\n\nand I’m sure that was a training area for the USAF’s air base ground defense school.”\n\nDon Read recalled, “I was sworn into the Air Force on 7/11/52, and left the next day for Parks AFB by train with a large group of others.\n\nSo, the base was fully operational in July of 1952.\n\nAfter Basic Training I & a few others were flown by an Air Force military plane to Keesler AFB in Mississippi.\"\n\nDon pointed out that the airfield at Parks was \"was operational.\n\nPerhaps not on a large scale, but for transporting students to other facilities for further training. At least for that.\"\n\nThe 1953 USGS topo map did not depict any runways at Parks.\n\nThe post headquarters of Parks AFB in the 1950s (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling).\n\nA 1958 aerial view (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) depicted a similar configuration of the Parks AFB airfield – 2 unpaved runways.\n\nIn Jonathan's words, it is possible that “the planned airfield there was simply graded but never built.”\n\nIn July 1959, the installation at Parks was transferred to the Army.\n\nOn the 1959, 1963, and 1964 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Charts, \"Parks AFB\" was depicted, but without any airfield.\n\nFrom 1959-73, Parks was operated in a standby status under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Army, Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nIn 1964, 6th Army declared the entire installation excess,\n\nbut was directed by the Department of the Army to retain 1,600 acres for National Guard & Navy use.\n\nA 1966 aerial view showed that the east/west runway had been improved with a narrow paved surface at some point between 1958-66.\n\nHowever, it was marked at each end with closed-runway “X” symbols.\n\nBy 1973, the Army determined that Camp Parks was needed as a mobilization & training center\n\nfor Reserve Components in the event of war or natural disaster.\n\nThe 1980 USGS topo map did not depict any runways at Parks.\n\nIn 1980, the Army officially designated Camp Parks as a semi-active installation,\n\nrenamed it Parks Reserve Forces Training Area, and declared it a subinstallation of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nMark Allen reported, \"I live a couple of miles from the former Parks AFB.\n\nAs of the mid 1980s there was still some aviation activity at Parks.\n\nWhen the base was at it's low point, one of the caretakers kept his PA-28 Piper Cherokee there.\n\nBy then the runway was so trashed that he actually landed on an adjacent paved road.\n\nI remember clearly the first time I saw the plane, I thought that somebody had made an emergency landing!\n\nI told the Livermore tower controller about it who told me the story.\"\n\nAlthough not depicted on aeronautical charts, the Camp Parks airfield was depicted (labeled \"Landing Strip\") on the 1989 USGS topo map.\n\nIn 1992, Parks RFTA became a subinstallation of HQ, I Corps, and Fort Lewis, WA.\n\nIn 1994, Parks RFTA became a direct-reporting installation of Fort McCoy, WI.\n\nAs of 2003, the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area was still an active military installation.\n\nA November 2002 photo by Ron Plante looking along a former Parks runway.\n\nRon indicated “The airfield site was a medical training area & helicopter LZ.”\n\nA February 2005 aerial photo by Jonathan Westerling looking south at the remains of the Camp Parks runways.\n\nJonathan observed, “With the winter rains everything is green – you can see what appears to be a helipad halfway down the large runway,\n\nand a structure of some sort at the west end of the smaller cross runway.”\n\nTim Tyler indicated in 2010, “They still run the Combat Lifesaver course there a couple times a year.”\n\nAn 8/28/12 aerial view showed the remains of the 2 Parks runways to remain recognizable.\n\nThe Camp Parks airfield is located in the northern part of the Camp Parks base, a half mile north of Broder Boulevard.\n\nThanks to Jonathan Westerling for pointing out this

Centerville Airport as having a northwest/southeast unpaved runway.\n\nThis general aviation airport was one of the hundreds of such fields\n\nwhich were established across the U.S. in the period immediately after the end of WW2.\n\nAnd like many of those fields, it did not last long,\n\nas surrounding development squeezed the airport out of business.\n\nCenterville Airport was evidently established at some point between 1945-46,\n\nas it was not yet depicted at all on the March 1945 San Francisco Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy).\n\nThe earliest depiction of Centerville Airport which has been located was a 1946 aerial photo.\n\nIt depicted Centerville Airport as having a northwest/southeast unpaved runway.\n\nThere did not appear to be any hangars, but a total of 10 single-engine aircraft were visible on the north side of the field.\n\nThe earliest ground-level photo which has been located of Centerville Airport was a March 1946 photo by Bill Larkins (courtesy of Jay Sherlock) of NC13401, a 1933 Waco PLA Sportsman.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Center Field\n\nwas on the 1948 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Tim Zukas).\n\nIt depicted Center Field as having a 2,600' unpaved runway.\n\nA 1948 aerial view showed that several hangars had been erected on the north side of the field,\n\nand the number of aircraft visible on the field had increased to 16.\n\nA 1950 aerial view from the Alexandria Digital Library @ UC Santa Barbara (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling)\n\ndepicted Centerville Airport as having a single northwest/southeast runway with a parallel taxiway,\n\nand several small buildings along the north side of the field.\n\nNeil Burkhart recalled, \"My father in-law was a long time resident of Fremont, he moved there in the early 1950s.\n\nHe told me 'The Airport' was originally off the South side of Mowry Avenue\n\nat the location of the current Albertsons / SaveOn Superstore near Blacow.\n\nHe said there were lots of glider ops out of it when it was on Mowry as well.\"\n\nThe 1952 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling) depicted “Center” as having a 2,500' unpaved runway.\n\nThe 1953 USGS topo map (courtesy of Kevin Walsh) depicted Centerville Airport as having a single northwest/southeast runway,\n\nparallel to the south side of Blacow Road.\n\nThis had replaced the considerably wider runway area to the southwest.\n\nA few small hangars were depicted on the northwest corner of the field, along the south side of Blacow Road.\n\nThe field was evidently renamed \"Center\" within the next year,\n\nas that is how it was depicted on the September 1954 San Francisco USAF Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nThe runway length had also been reduced somewhat, to only 2,000'.\n\nCenter Field was still depicted with a 2,000' unpaved runway on the March 1956 San Francisco USAF Sectional Chart (courtesy of Chris Kennedy).\n\nAn undated (1956 or later) sign for the \"Fremont Airport\", from \"Fremont - The first 30 years\" (courtesy of Timothy Swenson).\n\nAlthough the sign says \"Fremont Airport\", it was supposedly located at the corner of Fremont Boulevard & Mowry Boulevard,\n\nso it was presumably referring to the field which was otherwise known as \"Centerville Airport\".\n\nAn undated (circa 1950s?) view of planes at hangars from \"Fremont - The first 30 years\" (courtesy of Timothy Swenson).\n\nAlthough the picture is supposedly of the \"Fremont Airport\", it was presumably referring to the field which was otherwise known as \"Centerville Airport\".\n\nA 1959 aerial view showed that the size of the Centerville Airport property had shrunken drastically,\n\nwith the area to the south of the runway evidently no longer part of the airport.\n\nThe runway was by that point a narrow strip, very close to the road.\n\nThe number of aircraft on the field had grown to 20, but the airport's days were obviously numbered.\n\nCenter Field was listed in the 1960 Jeppesen Airway Manual (according to Chris Kennedy) as having a single 2,000' unpaved runway.\n\nDouglas Bauer recalled, “I flew out of Centerville Airport when I started taking glider lessons at 13 1/2 years old [1960] with Les Arnold at his Sky Sailing operation in 1960.”\n\nThe last depiction which has been located of Center Airport was on the March 1961 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart.\n\nIt depicted Center Airport as having a 2,000' unpaved runway.\n\nCenter Airport was apparently closed at some point between 1961-62,\n\nas it was no longer depicted on the 1961 USGS topo map\n\nor the October 1962 San Francisco Local Aeronautical Chart (according to Chris Kennedy).\n\nA 1966 aerial view showed that housing had covered the southeastern part of the former Center Airport.\n\nThe hangars still remained standing on the northwestern part, for the time being.\n\nA 1979 aerial view showed that the former hangars had been covered by a large building,\n\nerasing any trace of Centerville Airport.\n\nAs seen in the February 2004 USGS aerial photo, not a trace appeared to remain of Centerville Airport.\n\nThe site of Centerville Airport is located on the south side of Blacow Avenue, southeast of its intersection with Mowry

Francisco, CA)\n\nA 1943 diagram of the location of NOLF Heath (courtesy of Brian Rehwinkel).\n\nThis site has been the location of 2 separate airfields over the years.\n\nThe northern portion of the property was originally the location\n\nof Naval Outlying Landing Field Heath, a WW2 military airfield.\n\nAccording to Brian Rehwinkel, a square-shaped 160 acre plot of land was leased from the Heath family sometime in 1942 or early 1943\n\nfor use as an Navy outlying field to support flight training operations at NAS Oakland.\n\nThis field was originally designated Field “H”, or by its Bureau of Aeronautics # 22817.\n\nBrian remarked, “One interesting side story is that in August 1943 NAS Moffett Field staff requested that Heath OLF (and another Livermore field, Abel OLF)\n\nbe reassigned from NAS Livermore to NAS Moffett Field for use in the airship training program.\n\nThe request was made, in part, so these fields could be used in landing procedure training due to the congestion at Moffett Field.\n\nThe staff at NAS Livermore, in an August 1943 memo, indicated they could not operate effectively without these fields.\n\nI do not know if the Navy ever used these fields for blimp operations, but it is not very likely.”\n\nThe earliest depiction of NOLF Heath which has been located was a 1943 diagram (courtesy of Brian Rehwinkel).\n\nIt depicted Heath simply as a square-shaped outline.\n\nThe earliest aeronautical chart depiction which has been located of Heath\n\nwas on the August 1944 Regional Aeronautical Chart (courtesy of Jonathan Westerling).\n\nIt depicted “Heath (Navy)” as an auxiliary airfield.\n\nThe 1944 \"US Army & Navy Directory of Airfields\" (according to John Voss) described NOLF Heath as having a 3,100' runway,\n\nand indicated that it was one of the 14 NOLFs assigned to NAS Livermore.\n\nNOLF Heath was evidently abandoned at some point between 1944-45,\n\nas it was no longer depicted at all on the March 1945 San Francisco Sectional Chart (according to Chris Kennedy).\n\nThe earliest photo that has been located of Heath NOLF was a 1946 aerial view.\n\nIt depicted the field simply as an open grass field, without any hangars or other improvements.\n\nNo airfield at this location was "
