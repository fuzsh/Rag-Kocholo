By raising awareness about emerging security concerns in the airport community, this session will assist decision-makers in understanding organizational risks and identifying strategies to improve security outcomes.\n\nModerator:\n\nDeborah Flint, President and CEO, Greater Toronto Airports Authority\n\nPanelists:\n\nDavid Gates, Supervisory Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nNada Semaan, President and CEO, Canadian Air Transport Security Authority\n\nBeyond the Canvas: Legal Considerations for Art at Airports\n\n103\n\nArt can be a powerful visual tool to enhance the airport customer experience, create a sense of place, and speak to the communities the airport serves. Airports frequently display art that they acquired or have on loan and sometimes even integrate art into construction projects. What happens when airports need- or want- to relocate or even destroy installations? Art can convey a message, but does the airport want to avoid or create a forum for free expression? What contract language and policies should airports consider using to achieve their goals? The panel will discuss many of the legal- and practical- considerations for a successful airport art program.\n\nModerator:\n\nYovannie Rodriguez, Chief Administrative Officer, Greater Orlando Aviation Authority\n\nPanelists:\n\nLee Kaminetz, Assistant General Counsel, San Diego County Regional Airport Authority\n\nEvan Wilson, Deputy General Counsel, Metropolitan Airports Commission\n\nWilliam Wright, General Counsel & Governance Officer, Edmonton Regional Airports Authority\n\nESG – Responding to Investors and Stakeholders\n\n104A\n\nHas your airport recently received questions from stakeholders regarding ESG? If not, the questions are likely coming from investors and insurers. Come to this session to hear about how airports are developing their ESG materials, including perspectives from those that are starting from their sustainability reports, as well as airports starting from scratch. This session will also include an overview of the work that the ACI-NA cross-committee task group has undertaken on reporting and metrics.\n\nModerator:\n\nCandace McGraw, Chief Executive Officer, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport\n\nPanelists:\n\nChris Bergstrom, Executive Director, UBS Financial Services Inc. | Public Finance\n\nChris Poinsatte, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport\n\nDave Bannard, Attorney at Law, Kaplan Kirsch Rockwell\n\nSmarter Operations- Improving Airport Operational Efficiency & Safety with Advanced Technology\n\n104B\n\nAn array of technologies are arriving at airports that promise to increase operational efficiency, enhance situational awareness, optimize resource allocation, and improve margins of safety. In this session, we’ll survey several of these capabilities and discuss how they can be effectively utilized in the airport environment.\n\nModerator:\n\nEddie Clayson, Director of Airport Maintenance, Salt Lake City Department of Airports\n\nPanelists:\n\nJuan Gomez, Chief Executive Officer, Synaptic Aviation\n\nJoe Mahaz, Founder and Senior Advisor, EDI, An Arora Company\n\nIan Redhead, Deputy Director, Kansas City Aviation Department\n\nMike Youngs, Vice President Information Technology, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport\n\nYour Future Workforce is 10-Years-Old\n\n104C\n\nThe workforce challenges our industry are experiencing now are in part due to a lack of awareness of aviation career opportunities amongst students. Educating and engaging students about the airport industry at an early stage not only inspires their passion but also equips them with essential skills and knowledge required for future employment opportunities. Learn about the pivotal role that school outreach programs – aimed at students as young as elementary school – play in fostering a strong future talent pipeline.\n\nModerator:\n\nPeter Gargiulo, President, 4QD Strategy Consulting LLC\n\nPanelists:\n\nJamie Rhee, Commissioner, Chicago Department of Aviation\n\nNerissa Sugars, Director of Communications & Air Service, Hollywood Burbank Airport\n\nTanisha Lewis, Vice President for Diversity, Inclusion and Social Impact, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority\n\n10:15 AM – 10:45 AM\n\nNetworking Break\n\nPromonade Lobby\n\n10:45 AM – 12:00 PM\n\nEducational Sessions\n\nAchieve the Next Level of Smart Airports - Outcome-Driven Computer Vision Strategy\n\n102\n\nThe AI-driven future of travel has arrived. Computer Vision is helping to reshape the transportation industry at every level from streamlining the passenger experience, to improving gate turnaround, to reducing your carbon footprint. As the industry continues to evolve, converging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and federated learning will enable the next generation of prescriptive and adaptive data-driven outcomes benefiting passengers, the industry and sustainability. In this session, we’ll explore how a computer vision infrastructure that is manageable, scalable, and resilient, drives real-time insights and delivers all the outcomes that an airport needs – improving the passenger experience, operational efficiency, safety and security, sustainability, and revenue generation.\n\nModerator:\n\nWayne Arvidson, Global Director, Market Development & Strategy, Dell Technologies\n\nPanelists:\n\nPatrick Blattner, Chief Executive Officer, The Indoor Lab LLC\n\nDeclan Byrne, Director, Commercial Aerospace & Energy, PTC\n\nJared Mossman, Account Executive, Genetec Inc.\n\nBeyond the Runway: Airport Commercial Development\n\n103\n\nAirport properties accommodate different types of tenants and serve many different purposes. What is – and what should be- the FAA’s role in airport development? What is the status of the Draft FAA Policy Regarding Processing Land Use Changes? Will the new FAA Reauthorization Act revise the wording of Section 163 which restricts FAA’s authority over airport land use? What creative approaches can airports consider in lease models while adhering to their grant assurances? This panel of attorneys will discuss the ways in which airports can develop their land while adhering to their legal and regulatory obligations and maintaining the control they need.\n\nModerator:\n\nBrian Werst, General Counsel, Spokane International Airport\n\nPanelists:\n\nAmy Gonzalez, General Counsel, San Diego San Diego County Regional Airport Authority\n\nPeter Kirsch, Partner, Kaplan Kirsch & Rockwell, LLP\n\nPaul Tomme, Legal Counsel, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport\n\nHold Your Charge\n\n104A\n\nElectricity has become a hot topic at airports, as stakeholders identify increased needs and airports with Net Zero plans find electricity to be a critical path item. This session will provide a c-level suite look at electricity management at airports, from projected needs, infrastructure considerations, working with stakeholders, and managing the new and different kinds of risks that come with electrification.\n\nModerator:\n\nBridget Rief, Vice President of Planning and Development, Metropolitan Airports Commission\n\nPanelists:\n\nAlex Chapman, Director – Environmental, Social, and Governance, Vantage Airport Group\n\nKaty Glynn, Account Executive, Smart Buildings – Energy Performance Services, Siemens Industry, Inc.\n\nJim Szczesniak, Chief Operating Officer, Houston Airport Systems\n\nAirport Safety Management at a Crossroads\n\n104B\n\nWith the rollout of airport safety management system (SMS) requirements in the United States and ongoing efforts to in Canada to “modernize” its airport SMS programs, airport safety was a topic of intensive focus even before high profile safety incidents in the U.S. prompted the FAA’s March 2023 “Safety Summit”. In this session, we’ll explore the next steps U.S. and Canadian airport operators can take on their safety journey, with a focus on SMS, apron safety, safety data analysis, and effective safety promotion.\n\nModerator:\n\nSteve Hennigan, Chief Operating Officer, Southwest Florida International Airport/Lee County Port Authority\n\nPanelists:\n\nScott Ayers, Airport Manager, Safety Management & SMS, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport\n\nKathleen Henderson, Senior Director, Operations, Environment and Regulatory Affairs, Canadian Airports Council\n\nTara Perez, General Manager, Corporate Safety, Delta Air Lines Inc.\n\nRon Reichel, Airport Safety Management System Manager, Sacramento County Aviation Department\n\nSusie Scott, Director of Corporate Safety, Delta Air Lines Inc.\n\nWhen Does It Stop?: Managing Your Airport’s Brand in Perpetual Crisis\n\n104C\n\nAirport professionals face a barrage of crises any given day. From macro events like global pandemics and significant security events to micro disruptions like unhappy passengers and flight delays, airports are continually in a crisis response and recovery mode at every level. Each crisis impacts the airport’s brand and reputation within its community, threatening its competitiveness and ability attract new passengers and air service options. This session will highlight the strategies and tactics airports are deploying to proactively manage what they can and respond to what they can’t, all to protect the airport’s brand.\n\nModerator:\n\nKate O’Rourke, Manager of Public Relations and Marketing, Fredericton International Airport Authority\n\nPanelists:\n\nGreg Chin, Communications Director, Miami-Dade Aviation Department\n\nSabrina LoPiccolo-Kane, Manager, Marketing, San Diego County Regional Airport Authority\n\nJustin Meyer, Interim Director of Aviation, Kansas City Aviation Department\n\n12:00 PM – 1:15 PM\n\nNetworking Lunch\n\n101, 201-203\n\n1:15 PM – 2:15 PM\n\nEducational Sessions\n\nEvolving World of Risk Management for Airports\n\n102\n\nWith emerging risks, increased insurance premiums, retentions and pullbacks, this session will focus on how airports can manage and mitigate their risks in an evolving environment.\n\nModerator:\n\nTatiana Starostina, Chief Financial Officer, Los Angeles World Airports\n\nPanelists:\n\nCatrina Gilbert, Vice President, Risk Management, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport\n\nMichael Hill, Chief Financial Officer, Charlotte Douglas International Airport\n\nPaul Brigley, Vice President Finance & Chief Financial Officer, Halifax International Airport Authority\n\nMaking it All Work: Labor and the Law\n\n103\n\nAirport managers know firsthand how much work it takes to keep things going, and how many people it takes to do it. Employees of airports, contractors, airlines, Federal agencies, law enforcement, and concessionaires are all critical. While airports can regulate some speech and expressive activity in some ways, activity involving unions and organizing may implicate other legal principles. Social media and other forms of personal expression can also raise legal issues for airports as employers. How should airports think through these issues? How can airports contractually protect their operations from labor disruptions? And what do recent legislative initiatives and court cases tell us about the ability of the airport sponsor to mandate certain wages and benefits for workers? The panel will address these and other legal issues.\n\nModerator:\n\nChristina Marshall, Partner, Anderson & Kreiger LLP\n\nPanelists:\n\nMelissa Allison, Partner, Anderson & Kreiger LLP\n\nGale LaRoche, Senior Human Resources Consultant, ADK Consulting & Executive Search\n\nEric Smith, Partner, Kaplan Kirsch & Rockwell, LLP\n\nResiliency – Bending, but Not Breaking\n\n104A\n\nResiliency is about being prepared for both the unexpected, as well as the slow-moving, impactful when-they-occur events.

What do these developments mean for airport operators and the communities they serve? How will the affect airport infrastructure in the near, mid-, and long-term future? Most importantly, what can your airport be doing to prepare? Come for a discussion of these and other key topics as we help you not to fear the eVTOL.\n\nModerator:\n\nThomas Jewsbury, Executive Director, St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport\n\nPanelists:\n\nTom Anderson, Chief Operating Officer, Urban Air Mobility, Archer Aviation, Inc.\n\nKevin Cox, Chief Executive Officer, Ferrovial Vertiports\n\nGaël Le Bris, Vice President, Aviation Planning, WSP\n\nEmployee Experience Drives the Customer Experience\n\n104C\n\nLooking to improve your airport customer experience? Try looking at your employee experience. Airport workers – especially frontline staff – are crucial “value add” brand ambassadors and, given the proper support and focus, can have a positive, measurable impact on the airport’s bottom line. But measuring, optimizing, and leveraging airport employee satisfaction and engagement is not an easy endeavor. This session will explore how airports are designing new strategies to examine the entire employee journey and how it impacts the customer experience.\n\nModerator:\n\nLise D’Andrea, President & CEO CXE Inc.\n\nPanelists:\n\nLeah Douglas, Director of Guest Experience, Philadelphia International Airport\n\nMyron Keehn, President and CEO, Edmonton International Airport\n\nLeslie Kwasny, CFO & Vice President, Culture and Risk, Edmonton International Airport\n\nAtif Saeed, CEO, Philadelphia International Airport\n\n2:15 PM – 2:45 PM\n\nNetworking Break\n\nPromenade Lobby\n\n2:45 PM – 4:30 PM\n\nOpening General Session\n\nGrand Ballroom\n\nSam Samaddar\n\nChief Executive Officer, Kelowna International Airport\n\nChair, ACI-NA\n\nCynthia Guidry\n\nDirector, Long Beach Airport\n\nKevin Burke\n\nPresident and CEO, ACI-NA\n\nZanny Minton Beddoes\n\nEditor-in-Chief of The Economist\n\nEditor-in-Chief of The Economist and named one of the “Most Powerful Women in the World” by Forbes, Zanny Minton Beddoes is a renowned global economics expert, sought-after for her authoritative perspectives on the world economy.
