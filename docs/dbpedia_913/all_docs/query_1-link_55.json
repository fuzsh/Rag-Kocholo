The way the catchment area mechanic works is totally flawed because you have to stick everything in the midle of the city for it to be effective. This can be quite annoying when dealing with large bus stations and cargo stations, (you must delete buildings to place it where it needs to go). But even the first airfield is so large that placing it is an issue not only because of the terrain, (not enough flat area unless you play on flat mode), but especially when it comes to the catchment mechanic. You simply can't place an airfield effectively for it to attract people because the catchment area is too small. And because the time mechanic from trainfever is no longer here, you can't really set up bus / tram traffic to the airfield effectively either which makes the whole thing pretty much useless, not to mention the fact that this thing is enormous which makes it ridiculously hard to find a place for. I had to spend 20 million just in landsculpting to place the Medium size airfield where I wanted.\n\nClearly theere needs to be some patching to these mechanics, the best solution that I can come up with is to make the catchment area dynamic, Bigger stations = bigger catchment area. So a bus stop has the smallest, and a bus station has a bigger, large bus station bigger etc, and the Airfield catchment area better be pretty much the same size as a city of the size in my picture.\n\nIt's That.. or turn back the clock / make some kind of hybrid mechanic that utilizes both catchment area and travel time, which I think if developed could work great, but that's for someone else to figure out. Would be nice if Devs get this.\n\nA solution to the airfields being so large and difficult to place would be to make the maps larger, like 2x larger, that would leave more room between mountains for flat areas, even on Hilly version. This would also solve another problem, which is TGV \"300kmh\" BS, and Concorde Mach 2 BS. The maps simply arn't large enough to accomodate the speed of these vehicles. I set up a line between the 2 very furthest cities on each end of a 1x2 map, and the Concorde was still only able to get up to ~1100 kmh before decelerating.\n\nAnother issue with the airfields and even trainstations is the fact that they have to be all totally flat, meaning the terrain around it has to adjust which when talking about large stations and airfields makes the price skyrocket, see #1 pic. Maybe they could be made to adjust to the terrain a little in conjunction with the terrain adjusting around it.\n\nAs a footnote, the water generation needs to improve as well, there's too much of rivers and not enough lake/ sea, you can't even place a 3 terminal station in a river without it blocking the waterway.\n\nWe need larger maps, and better catchment mechanics.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4jQPAUs.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pZFB3nJ.jpg"
