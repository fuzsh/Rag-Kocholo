However, if you live near an airport it is inevitable you will hear and see aircraft – these aircraft are required to adhere to procedures and air traffic instructions whilst operating in and out of London Biggin Hill. Dark Background (dark blue) Our online flight tracker, Webtrak, uses the radar service from National Air Traffic Services (NATS) at Heathrow Airport and allows the system to automatically file a violation report, should aircraft depart from the agreed flightpaths when arriving or departing the airport. The violation reports are then investigated by London Biggin Hill in the same way that we investigate complaints relating to specific aircraft movements. You can report an aircraft that you think is not complying with the agreed noise abatement protocols. To help you through this process, we have put together some guidance on how to use Webtrak and how aircraft operate at London Biggin Hill.

        "text": "The easiest way for a complaint to be made is by using the Webtrak system. This has a simple form designed to ensure we have all of the required information to process your complaint, including data gathered by Webtrak, so we can investigate your feedback in full.\n\nAny other complaint may be made using our online complaints form which can be found here: Make a Complaint\n\nA telephone message line, 01959 578580, can also be used to register a complaint that does not relate to a specific aircraft movement. Please include details on how we can contact you with a response. If a complaint is submitted more than 7 days after the event took place, this will not warrant a response nor will it be recorded as a complaint.\n\nWe aim to respond to all complaints within 10 working days – dependant on the complexity and method used to submit the complaint.\n\nFollowing our increased opening hours in 2015, significant changes were made to the way in which aircraft operate to and from London Biggin Hill. This included the introduction of Noise Sensitive Areas (NSAs) covering local towns and villages and a reduction and restrictions to circuit flights – see ‘What is a circuit?’ further below on this page.\n\nAll complaints received are investigated using air traffic data and Webtrak, before being reviewed by the airport’s CEO who will respond to the complainant in writing.\n\nThe following highlights the stages through which we process your complaint:\n\nStage 1: Compliant received and acknowledged\n\nStage 2: Initial investigation regarding compliance/non compliance\n\nStage 3: Response advising compliance or further review by SANARB\n\nStage 4: Further investigation\n\nStage 5: Post SANARB outcome\n\nWe would hope to get Stage 3 responses to residents within 14 days.\n\nWe would hope to get Stage 5 responses back to residents within 8 weeks, which allows for pilots and operators to respond to SANARB requests for additional information and for all elements of a potential non-compliance to be fully investigated.\n\nAll personal information relating to the complainant is redacted before it is passed to SANARB and the Noise Sub Committee.\n\nA record is kept of all complaints for a period of five years and is included in the noise and safety sub committee report to the quarterly Airport Consultative Committee.\n\nAll airports are required by the Department for Transport to communicate openly and effectively with their local communities and users of the airport about the impact of the airports operations. This is the role of the Airports Consultative Committee (ACC) – government guidelines have been created to assist with establishing and running an airport’s ACC. Minutes of all ACC meetings held at London Biggin Hill are published here.\n\nThe ACC has a Noise and Safety Sub Committee that reviews all complaints that are brought before SANARB. The chair of the Sub Committee will report the findings to the ACC at the quarterly meetings.\n\nIn addition to the two fixed noise monitors at either end of our runway, we have two mobile noise monitors that are available to be positioned in residents’ properties to measure the noise generated by aircraft.\n\nApplications can be made for the monitor to be positioned in your garden for up to two weeks. The monitor will appear on the Webtrak system so that you and other Webtrak users can see the noise levels in decibels. At the conclusion of the monitor being deployed a noise report will be sent to the resident containing all noise occurrences. If you would like to apply, please email: [email protected]\n\nThe monitors are calibrated annually by a noise specialist in accordance with the conditions of the Noise Action Plan.\n\nA vexatious complaint means one that is made or pursued without reasonable grounds or made to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment, or for any other wrongful purpose that may have a detrimental impact on the airport’s reputation.\n\nLondon Biggin Hill Airport is committed to dealing with all correspondence and complaints comprehensively and in a timely manner. If a complainant is unhappy with the outcome of a complaint and seeks to challenge it, this does not qualify them as vexatious or unreasonably persistent.\n\nThe airport may become subject to persistent complaints, as part of organised attempts to disrupt the noise complaints system, as a protest of the airport. For example, somebody with access to the online WebTrak system might repeatedly log their complaint by telephone or email to overwhelm the comments line and, as a consequence, delay the response times for those unable to use the WebTrak system (for any reason).\n\nThe airport has therefore developed a policy to address ‘vexatious’ complainants, counted as anyone who:\n\nSubmits complaints which are abusive, threatening, or unacceptable in nature\n\nMakes repeated complaints about the same movement\n\nMakes more than five non-substantiated complaints (i.e., those where no deviation from flight procedures is found or where there were safety reasons for making that deviation) within a one-month period.\n\nAll cases of vexatious complainants will be referred to the Airport Consultative Committee’s (ACC) Noise and Safety Sub-Committee for confirmation. If the ACC Noise and Safety Sub-Committee confirm that a complainant is vexatious under this policy:\n\nSubsequent substantiated complaints from a person deemed to be vexatious will be processed in the normal manner, including a letter of response, however, unsubstantiated complaints by complainants listed as vexatious will not warrant a response.\n\nThe ACC Noise and Safety Sub-Committee will notify the vexatious complainant in writing, informing them of their decision. The ACC Noise and Safety Sub-Committee will review those listed as vexatious complainants 12 months after they have been listed as vexatious and the decision confirmed at the next Airport Consultative Committee meeting. This review will confirm that either the complainant remains vexatious or that they may be removed from the status of vexatious based on the record of complaints made in the previous 12 months.\n\nThe Air Traffic Zone (ATZ) is a 2.5 nautical mile circle centred on the runway. This circle of airspace rises from ground level up to 2,000 feet above aerodrome level. The ATZ, in which aircraft are controlled by London Biggin Hill’s Air Traffic Controllers, is designed to give protection to aircraft during the critical stages of flight when departing, arriving or flying in the vicinity of an aerodrome.\n\nClick here for more information. The airspace outside of the ATZ is classified as Class G, see below.\n\nThe airspace across the UK is designated in Classes, A, B, C, D, E, and G. Class G is the only type that is “Uncontrolled” but does have restrictions applied for weather, visibility and the speed of aircraft below 10,000 ft restricted to 250kts. In Class G airspace, aircraft may fly when and where they like, subject to a set of simple rules.\n\nAlthough there is no legal requirement to do so, many pilots notify Air Traffic Control of their presence and intentions and pilots take full responsibility for their own safety, although they can ask for help. Air Traffic Control can provide pilots in Class G with basic flight information service to support their safe flying.\n\nA vast array of aircraft operate in and out of London Biggin Hill; anything from a two seat light aircraft up to an Airbus A320, although the more common larger corporate business jets are the likes of a Bombardier Global or Challenger aircraft.\n\nFor jet aircraft to operate at London Biggin Hill, they must be “ICAO Chapter 3 compliant or better” – this means that it must meet the noise standards set out in Chapter 3 of part II, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the convention on International Civil Aviation Organisation. This is fast being superseded by Chapter 4 certified aircraft which was introduced for all new aircraft produced after January 2006.\n\nWe restrict the period between 06:30 and 07:00 hours to Chapter 4 certified aircraft as part of our Noise Action Plan (NAP)."
