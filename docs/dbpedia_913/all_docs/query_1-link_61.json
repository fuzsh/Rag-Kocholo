        "text": "The Providenciales International Airport is the primary airport in the Turks and Caicos. All scheduled international flights to the country land at this gateway.\n\nThe island of Provo welcomes flights from over two dozen international cities, including London, New York, Washington D.C., Miami, Toronto, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Atlanta.\n\nSeveral international airlines fly to the Turks and Caicos, including British Airways, American Airlines, United, Air Canada, Delta, Jet Blue, West Jet, and InterCaribbean. All airlines share a general ticketing and check-in hall. There are no satellite terminals.\n\nThe Providenciales Airport IATA code is PLS, the ICAO code is MBPV.\n\nThe airport has been nominally renamed the Howard Hamilton International Airport, however, the name Providenciales International Airport remains the dominant name used. Howard Hamilton was a local entrepreneur who founded one of the first local airlines in the Turks and Caicos.\n\nCheck-In Info\n\nProvidenciales International Airport Facts Airport Code IATA: PLS, ICAO: MBPV Runway Length 9,199 feet (2,804 meters) Elevation 15 feet (5 meters) Runway Direction 10/28 Clearance Status International Entry Car Parking $2 per hour, $25 per day\n\nMost airlines recommend arriving at least two hours before international flights. For domestic flights, 45 minutes is sufficient.\n\nDue to overcrowding at the airport (there has been a large increase in flights over the last decade, with a small increase in terminal space), the airports authority requests that all passengers arrive only two hours before their flight.\n\nSaturday and Sunday Flights\n\nGive yourself additional time to check in on Saturday and Sunday. There is a high number of flights on these days and this can lead to delays at check-in and security.\n\nAirport Fast Track\n\nAn airport Fast Track concierge service is available at additional cost and allows guests to bypass the queues at Immigration and Customs on arrival, and check-in and security at departure. Several different Fast Track packages are offered, and prices start at $65 per person.\n\nImmigration, Passport, and Customs Information\n\nYou’ll need to clear immigration and collect your baggage before proceeding through customs. Unlike in some other Caribbean airports (such as Nassau), there are no pre-clearance facilities operated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for U.S. nationals returning home.\n\nImmigration clearance can be over an hour depending on the day and time of your arrival.\n\nThe Providenciales International Airport is a relatively small facility, and only has two baggage carousels. During typical conditions, there isn’t much of a wait for luggage, and customs is generally efficient as well.\n\nLuggage carts ($5 usage fee) and porters are onsite.\n\nTerminal Facilities and Services\n\nThere is one departure lounge each for international and domestic flights. The international lounge can become crowded at times, but plans are underway for expansion.\n\nThe check-in hall features an open-air design, and has both traditional check-in counters with staff, and automated kiosks for some of the major airlines.\n\nBefore the international security checkpoint, there are resin copies of the stones from the Sapodilla Bay Hill Rock Carvings.\n\nThe international departure lounge features two levels, and seating is found in both areas. The upper level also offers an outdoor viewing deck and limited amounts of seating, as well as a VIP and first-class lounge.\n\nInternet\n\nThe departure lounge is covered by a complimentary Flow Wi-Fi hot spot. Unfortunately, the connection doesn’t always function, and is often poor when it is operational.\n\nShopping and Eating\n\nA restaurant, Gilly’s Restaurant, is found outside the security checkpoint in the main terminal. Gilly’s Café, a small bar that also serves food, is located in the upper level of the international departure lounge.\n\nSeveral gift, souvenir, duty-free, and jewelry shops are located on the lower level of the departure lounge, including The Wellington Collection, which features unique gifts and art made in the Turks and Caicos, and a kiosk for Turkberry, which is a popular local frozen yogurt shop.\n\nCurrency Exchange\n\nThere is no Bureau de Change at the airport. You are advised to exchange currency before you arrive. Currency can be exchanged at local banks, but the fees are exorbitant and queues can be over an hour for service.\n\nLost and Found\n\nTo contact the Providenciales International Airport regarding lost and found items, please call airport security at +1 (649) 941-4380, or contact the Turks and Caicos Airport Authority at +1 (649) 946-4420, and ask to be transferred to the security desk.\n\nGround Transportation and Taxis\n\nTaxis and cars (both private and rental) are the only forms of ground transportation from the airport.\n\nTaxis are available directly outside the baggage claim area. We advise you to confirm your fare (total for all passengers) before setting off. There are fixed fares as set in the ordinance (and often posted by other information sources), but these are not always respected.\n\nWe recommend that most visitors rent a car because of the lack of public transportation. Find out more at Getting Around Providenciales, Providenciales Car Rentals, and Driving in the Turks and Caicos. See Providenciales Taxis for more information on taxi fares, stands, and availability.\n\nSome accommodations, such as vacation rental villas, offer complimentary airport pick-up and drop-off.\n\nTransport from the Providenciales Airport to Grace Bay\n\nGrace Bay is home to the majority of resorts, hotels, and restaurants on Providenciales. This region of Providenciales is about a 10-minute journey by car from the airport.\n\nIn the case of visitors picking up a rental car at the airport (recommended), it’s not difficult finding Grace Bay. Simply follow Leeward Highway from the Downtown area to its conclusion at the Gateway to Grace Bay roundabout, and follow the short Allegro Road to the center of Grace Bay.\n\nTaxi fares for two people typically cost $28–34. Be aware that taxis may multiply the fare by the number of passengers, so clarify the total rate for your party before embarking.\n\nAirport Transport Businesses\n\nFast Track Transport\n\nFast Track Transport is a luxury private car service, with punctual and impeccable rides via Chevrolet Suburban SUVs or BMW 5 Series cars.

It is illegal to leave cars unattended at the curbside.\n\nThe small car park is located a short distance from the terminal, which does become full at times. As usual, don’t leave any valuables in your car, as there isn't security personnel stationed at the car park.\n\nThe Providenciales Airport Authority has recently begun the practice of towing and clamping improperly-parked vehicles. We advise against leaving a car unattended for any length of time outside of the car park.\n\nAirport Parking Fees Hour (or part) $2.00 Day $25.00 Week $175.00\n\nArrivals\n\nDepartures\n\nRenovations and a New Terminal\n\nPlans to make major improvements to the current Providenciales International Airport and terminal have been ongoing for several years.\n\nThe Turks and Caicos Government is working with ALG Consulting, a Canadian firm that specializes in logistics, infrastructure, and transportation, to create a workable strategy in the short term to reduce congestion issues and improve the air passenger experience, while building a new and much larger terminal that can serve the forecasted needs of the Turks and Caicos for at least 30 years.\n\nAs of July 2024, the Government is in the final stages of selecting a company to carry out the redevelopment project, which will include construction of a new terminal to the west of the current location.\n\nCurrent projections are that over 300 million dollars will be spent on improvements to the existing airport and the new terminal.\n\nShort Term Improvements\n\nSeveral improvements are expected to be made to the current terminal and runway, including:\n\nRelocation of current administration offices upstairs at the airport, to allow for a larger departure lounge\n\nImprovements to security, immigration, and customs, to greatly improve the rate of processing, including the introduction of E-gates\n\nImprovements to baggage hall and baggage handling facilities\n\nAdding a turning pad, and parallel taxiway on the north-eastern side of the runway, to greatly reduce the time aircraft spend on the primary runway\n\nExpanding the current terminal on both the eastern and western sides\n\nAdding a parallel taxiway on the north-western side of the runway, to reduce the time aircraft are on the primary runway\n\nConstruction of an airside walkway canopy that will provide shade for arriving and departing passengers is ongoing, and is scheduled for completion in August 2024.\n\nNew Terminal in 2027\n\nThe primary goal of the Providenciales International Airport Expansion Project is to build a new and modern terminal, with a goal of completing the terminal in 2027. The new terminal is expected to have four sky bridges to service large aircraft, and bus service between the terminal and aircraft to service smaller aircraft, domestic flights, and large international aircraft that can’t be accommodated by the sky bridges.\n\nPrivate Aircraft and Fixed Base Operators\n\nFor information on traveling by private plane, see Turks and Caicos FBOs and Private Planes.\n\nThere are two FBOs on Providenciales, and these full-service facilities cater to luxury and commercial aviation."
