        "text": "MOORABBIN AIR MUSEUM - 1972\n\nEstablished at Melbourne's Moorabbin Airport less than 7 years earlier, these photographs were taken on a visit in November 1972.\n\nLater renamed Australian National Aviation Museum, it continues today at the same site, although enlarged and with display buildings\n\nThe view through the cockpit windscreen of DC-3 VH-ANH\n\nVH-ANH was flown to Moorabbin from Essendon in August 1972 after Ansett Airlines of Australia retired its last DC-3s.\n\nNote the Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines, which Ansett-ANA preferred for its large DC-3 fleet\n\nGloster Meteor T.7 A77-707 was one of the last aircraft to avoid scrapping at the vast RAAF storage airfield at Tocumwal NSW\n\nIt was dismantled by museum members and moved by road to Moorabbin in 1963\n\nRoyal Australian Navy DH.112 Sea Venom FAW.53 N4-901 was formerly WZ901\n\nVampire A79-422 was salvaged in battered condition from a playground at the Lord Mayors Holiday Camp at Portsea Vic.\n\nIt is seen under restoration in the open, before hangars were erected on the museum site\n\nRoyal Australian Navy Fairey Gannet AS.1 XG789 coded \"M841\" from service on aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne.\n\nEarly museum stalwarts are (L-R) Gil Johnson, Jon Lock and Neil Follett\n\nPride of place went to former RAAF Bristol Beaufighter A8-328 from the Australian wartime production.\n\nIt had been laying in sand on its belly in a playground at the Lord Mayors Holiday Camp at Portsea for ten years.\n\nWhen saved in 1962, it was in deplorable condition\n\nThe Beaufighter from the port side, showing the big rebuilding task under way. Today it is displayed in a hangar\n\npainted in wartime camouflage as RAAF \"A8-39 EH-K\", interior and external restoration completed\n\nRAN Fairey Firefly TT Mk.6 WD828 code \"847\" was delivered to the museum by air in February 1967 by Terry Brain\n\nThe fuselage of RAAF Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawk A29-53 was found on a farm near Colac Vic in 1966.\n\nIt was displayed at the museum for many years mounted on a spare CAC Mustang mainplane as seen here.\n\nHowever it is currently undergoing complete restoration using authentic P-40 wing and undercarriage parts\n\nWoomera-based RAAF Bristol Sycamore A91-1 had a short civil life as VH-GVR before an accident in the Victorian Alps in 1967.\n\nAfter having the gaudy civilian paintwork stripped, it was stored. Today it displayed as RAAF \"A91-1\"\n\nCAC CA-6 Wackett Trainer VH-AGP had been painted in RAAF camouflage, its wooden wing removed for preservation\n\nThe one and only Southern Cross Aviation SC-1 VH-SCA had been built and flown at Toowoomba Qld in 1961\n\nDH.60G Gipsy Moth VH-UKV Diana had been donated to the museum in 1962.\n\nPending display buildings at the Moorabbin site, it was kept in a hangar at Berwick airfield near Melbourne\n\nLast inmate seen on the 1972 visit was this fuselage of RAAF Bristol Beaufighter A19-43, from a farm at Nhill, Victoria.\n\n15 years later this and other Beaufighter sections were sold for restoration for the USAF Museum at Wright Patterson AFB Ohio,\n\nwhere it is displayed today representing USAAF 415th Night Fighter Squadron Beaufighter \"KV912\" in the Mediterranean Theatre\n\nTailpiece: Salvaging a Beaufighter\n\nThanks to Nigel Daw and Neil Follett,, these pictures show the recovery of A19-43 from a farm near Nhill Vic in January 1971:"
