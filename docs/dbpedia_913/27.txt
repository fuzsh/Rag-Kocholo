Nhill Air Show 2019

Nhill is a Wimmera Western Highway town, in western Victoria. About halfway between Adelaide and Melbourne. Nhill's population is a little over two thousand residents.

Fund Raising for Wheels for the Wirraway

Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre Open to the public March 10th 2018 and again in 2019. Very successful public flying displays were attended by a few thousand.

Many light aircraft flew in. A few jet powered. Some from interstate. All who attended enjoyed the flying and static displays. Very good extensive air show for a small town.

The Nhill Aviation Heritage Centre is located at the historical Nhill airport. Included in its permanent displays is a rare Avro Anson aircraft undergoing restoration. In April 2018, it also acquired a rare Wirraway aeroplane, to much public support and fanfare. Nhill Air show proceeds go to aircraft restoration projects.

"Nhill" is believed to be a local aboriginal word meaning "early morning mist rising over water" or the very similar "white mist rising from the water".
