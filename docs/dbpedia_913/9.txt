DEVELOPMENT OF AIRPORT

In the spring of 1924 Francis Birtles, noted Australian explorer, arrived over Nhill in an aeroplane piloted by Lieut. Briggs of the Royal Australian Air Force, and landed in Messrs Moll Bros. paddock, a mile east of the town. They were returning from an exploring flight over the Lake Eyre region of northern South Australia, and were met in Nhill by Messrs Herbert Moll, S. C. Moll and F. K. McKenzie, who was intensely interested in aviation since its inception. Lieut. Briggs said, "Why don't you make this an aerodrome? It is ideal for the purpose and is exactly half-way between Melbourne and Adelaide." Today Nhill is not only the oldest inland airport in Victoria, but it is one of the chain of great aerodromes that extends from Brisbane to Perth. Herb. Moll said that he was prepared to grant the paddock at an infinitesimal rental to the aviation authorities. After protracted negotiations by Mr McKenzie with the late Colonel Brinsmead and the Minister for Defence, the ground was inspected by officers of the civil and military departments and the area was ultimately proclaimed a Government landing ground.

NIGHT FLYING DEPOT

In 1928 Messrs. Moll Bros sold the property to Mr H. L. Bond, who decided to cut it up into building allotments. Mr McKenzie's work seemed to have gone for nothing when Mr I. S. Young, a Lieutenant in the R.A.A.F. in the war, and a former president of the Nhill branch of the R.S.L. came to the rescue and placed his horse training track north of Halpin Park, at their disposal.

Many of the world's most celebrated aviators of both sexes have landed on the aerodrome, including C. W. A. Scott. Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith. "Battling" Butler. Jimmy Mollison. Bert Hinkler and Amy Johnson. Nhill was a control station for the East-West air race, and also for the SA. Centenary race from Brisbane to Perth.

Mr McKenzie was not satisfied, until he had an assurance from the P.M.G.'S Department that Nhill's claim would be taken into consideration when the mail route for night flying was established - and it has been established - the work of preparing the aerodrome has begun, the wireless beam tower has been erected, also the meteorological station, and the identification tower on which will be placed a flashing neon light. The area of the drome will be surrounded with coloured electric lamps at 50-yard intervals. It is expected that the aerodrome will be officially opened during a visit by the Minister tor Defence, members of the R.A.A.F., and representatives of various aero clubs.

Note: There are several inconsistencies in this report. 1924 August, Glenferness Street Aerodrome complete. 1927 September, Aerodrome transferred to Young and Sutherland’s paddock now known as Blackwood’s on north side of Park Street opposite school, then known as Halpin Park. This was temporary and a paddock to the west of Blackwood’s house became the aerodrome and continued to be used for all events mentioned above. 1937 April 19. Announcement that a new aerodrome would be built on the present (2019) site. First plane landed 1938 Feb 20. 1938 November 19 mentioned as official opening with aeradio station, perimeter lighting and radio towers in place. John Deckert.

1938 Sept 26th . NHILL'S CLAIM FOR AERODROME AS A TRAINING CENTRE

Mr TH Scholfield M.H.R. has received the following letter from the Minister of Defence, Mr Thorby, dated 22/9/38. "I have to acknowledge receipt of your personal representations supporting the request from Mr F.K. McKenzie of the Nhill Free Press Office, Nhill for the establishment of an RAAF flying training school at that centre. I have fully noted the advantages which the Nhill Aerodrome possesses for a purpose of this nature and you may rest assured that the claims of this centre will receive every consideration along with those of other centres."

STAFF FOR AERADIO STATIONS Special P.M.G. School

A special school for the training of aeradio operators is to be established by the Postmaster-General's department, the Director General of the Civil Aviation department (Mr. Corbett) announced yesterday.

Under the big scheme of the Civil Aviation department to improve the radio flying aids throughout Australia, aeradio stations are being, established at various points in the north-west and central areas of the Commonwealth. Amalgamated Wireless of Australasia Ltd., which is supplying many of the stations, had contracted to operate and man them for 12 months, Mr. Corbett stated, and at the end of that period, A.W.A. operators who were suitable for the public service, would be invited to join the Civil Aviation department. The new school, which will be constructed in Sydney, will train operators to take over from men who are not suitable for the public service. The course of training will occupy about six months. It will be free, but open only to Postal department employes.
