        "text": "(1935–2020 and 1926–75, respectively). The Swedish husband-and-wife team of Per Wahlöö and Maj Sjöwall were journalists and innovative writers of detective fiction. They used the popular form of the detective story as a vehicle for social criticism.\n\nPer Wahlöö was born on August 5, 1926, in Göteborg, Sweden, and Maj Sjöwall was born on September 25, 1935, in Stockholm. They married in 1962. Together they wrote a series of detective stories in which Martin Beck and his colleagues at the Central Bureau of Investigation in Stockholm were the main characters. From Roseanna, published in 1965, to The Terrorists, published in 1975, the series consists of ten novels in which the crime itself is subordinate to social commentary. Both the police force and the criminals mirror the shifting social forces within the Swedish welfare state. The authors strongly criticize abuses of power and the systematic use of propaganda in society. Many of these same motifs appear in Wahlöö’s novels of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Wahlöö died on June 22, 1975, in Malmö, Sweden. Sjöwall died on April 29, 2020."
