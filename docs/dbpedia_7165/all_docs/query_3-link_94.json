        "text": "Why do we love crime fiction so much? The crime/thriller genre made up 36% of total book sales in Britain in 2017 and for the first time crime fiction exceeded literary/general fiction.\n\nA range of explanations have been suggested for this trend, perhaps I will discuss these in another post. For now, I will just feature some recent reads and highlight what I look for in crime fiction, or more particularly, in mysteries.\n\n1. The Plot\n\nMost mysteries follow a well-defined structure, with a crime or discovery of a crime early in the story and the remaining part focusing on the gradual discovery of facts â€“ possibly with a good many red herrings â€“ ultimately leading towards the climatic revelation and finishing with a short epilogue.\n\nMy ideal mystery features relatable characters, but at its best, a strong plot can stand alone. A prime example of a strong plot is Agatha Christieâ€™s And Then There Were None, which I read as a child. It was my first Christie and it shook my world. I have been an avid fan of Christie (and crime) ever since.\n\nI recently read Smallbone Deceased by Michael Gilbert on recommendation from FictionFan. This is one of British Libraryâ€™s Crime Classics and another example of a clever plot. The action is centred around a solicitorâ€™s office, where the body of Mr. Smallbone is found. The suspects are a charming bunch, but Gilbert didnâ€™t engage much in character studies, which meant only a few of them stood out to me. Occasionally, I had to go back to remind myself about one of the characters. However, the plot combined with excessively charming writing made up for that and I enjoyed it very much.\n\n2. The Characters\n\nA plot has to be unique to stand on its own. A good plot can keep me entertained, but the stories I remember afterwards typically include a gallery of interesting characters. Ann Cleeves is in my opinion a master in this respect. Her characters are real, complex and nuanced. Like in real life, nothing is black or white. Inevitably, you will sometimes feel deep empathy with the â€˜badâ€™ guys or be utterly frustrated with the â€˜goodâ€™ guys.\n\nP. D. James also excels in depicting interesting characters. Last month, I listened to The Murder Room, which revolves around the Dupayne, a small crime-focused London museum. The air is filled with tension, because a member of the Dupayne family wants to close down the museum.\n\nThis is a slow burner and not the strongest plot seen from P. D. James. It breaks with the usual plot structure; the first incident happens quite late in the story. It did not matter to me. I had a blast delving into the lives of the characters.\n\n3. The Escapism Factor\n\nSometimes, depth and nuances are of less importance. Instead, fast-paced entertainment, which will induce you to frantically flip the pages, is required.\n\nBefore I got my Kindle, I often picked up such books in the airport from the bestseller shelf. The right book can keep my attention fixed even in a noisy airport and (almost) make me forget my annoyance about the plane being two hours delayed. Airport reading has introduced me to authors like Lee Child and David Baldacci, which I doubt, I would have picked up otherwise.\n\nRecently, I read Mel Sherratâ€™s Hush Hush, which fits perfectly in this category.\n\nDS Grace Allendale is a sympathetic heroine, who like all modern detectives has moved to a new city for a new start. Also, like any modern detective with respect for herself, she has a seriously dark and messed-up past, which she escaped from. True to form her past catches up with her and she has to face her ghosts.\n\nBesides from Grace, the other characters are one-dimensional, or in best case two-dimensional. The plot is not particularly original. But I spent some happy hours completely immersed in this mystery and I donâ€™t regret it for a minute.\n\nðŸ¤”\n\nGood writing and an interesting setting can contribute to my enjoyment of a mystery, but these attributes cannot stand alone.\n\nDo you enjoy crime fiction? Which books got you hooked? And what does it take to create the perfect mystery for you?\n\nDonâ€™t forget the upcoming Capital Crime Festival which will take place in London 26th â€“ 28th September."
