        "text": "The Martin Beck books are widely acknowledged as some of the most influential detective novels ever written. Written by Swedish husband and wife team Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö between 1965-1975, the ten-book series set a gold standard for all subsequent Scandanavian crime fiction. Long before Kurt Wallander or Harry Hole, Beck was the original flawed policeman, working with a motley collection of colleagues to uncover the cruelty and injustice lurking beneath the surface of Sweden's seemingly liberal, democratic society.\n\nThis complete collection includes:\n\nRoseanna (1965) - translated by Lois Roth and dramatised by Jennifer Howarth\n\nThe Man Who Went Up in Smoke (1966) - translated by Joan Tate and dramatised by Katie Hims\n\nThe Man on the Balcony (1967) - translated by Alan Blair and dramatised by Katie Hims\n\nThe Laughing Policeman (1968) - translated by Alan Blair and dramatised by Jennifer Howarth\n\nThe Fire Engine That Disappeared (1969) - translated by Joan Tate and dramatised by Katie Hims\n\nMurder at the Savoy (1970) - translated by Amy and Ken Knoespel and dramatised by Jennifer Howarth\n\nThe Abominable Man (1971) - translated by Thomas Teal and dramatised by Katie Hims\n\nThe Locked Room (1972) - translated by Alan Blair and dramatised by Jennifer Howarth\n\nCop Killer (1974) - translated by Thomas Teal and dramatised by Jennifer Howarth\n\nThe Terrorists (1975) - translated by Joan Tate and dramatised by Katie Hims"
