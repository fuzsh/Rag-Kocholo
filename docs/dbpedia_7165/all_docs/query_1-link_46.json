        "text": "When the Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesbø was in his early teens, he had a panic attack. The sun had set in Molde, the small city on Norway’s west coast where he grew up, and the apartment in which he lived with his parents and two brothers was silent. Thoughts of death descended on him, visions of being trapped in a coffin under the earth. He ran to his father, Per, woke him from a nap, and asked him what happens when you die. “Do you really want to know?” his father asked. The boy insisted. “It all goes black,” he said.\n\nIn the crowded field of Scandinavian crime fiction, Nesbø’s books stand out for their blackness. He has written ten novels about the investigations of Inspector Harry Hole, a cynical, alcoholic detective in the Oslo police department. Hole, who is both destructive and self-destructive, always gets his man, but by the end of the story he has inadvertently caused the death of someone he loves, or become an opium addict, or been disfigured. At the conclusion of “Phantom,” the ninth novel in the series, Harry is shot at point-blank range. Not until well into the next book, “Police,” do you find out whether or not he is still alive.\n\nNesbø likes to rip plots up in this way, to play with the conventions of his genre. He attributes his skill to hearing his father and his relatives tell the same stories over and over. “For me, as a storyteller, that was my school,” Nesbø told me. “It wasn’t about the punch line but how they would build up the story toward the punch line.” Now, he said, “I get paid a king’s ransom for doing what comes naturally.”\n\nNesbø’s Harry Hole novels have sold twenty-three million copies, in forty languages. He is also the author of the popular “Doctor Proctor’s Fart Powder” books for children, as well as a series of novels written under the pen name Tom Johansen. The movie version of his 2008 novel, “Headhunters,” is the highest-grossing film in Norway’s history. His literary success has made him the country’s first international pop-culture star. Aside from a few complaints about the lurid violence in his novels—in one installment, a woman’s face and throat are torn apart by an exploding metal ball that is forced into her mouth—public criticism of Nesbø is rare. Though his friend and biking companion Jens Stoltenberg, twice Prime Minister of Norway, had been appointed chief of NATO days before, he returned my call to say of Nesbø, “He’s very simpatico, a nice guy.”\n\nThe sense of Nesbø’s immunity to criticism extends even to those institutions which are not treated with much respect in his fiction. I went to see Hans Sverre Sjøvold, Oslo’s chief of police, and asked him what he thought of Nesbø’s representation of the Oslo police as being largely corrupt. The color rose in his cheeks. Behind black-framed glasses, his eyes watered, and he chuckled uneasily. “It is fiction, you know,” Sjøvold said. Then, referring to Nesbø’s portrait of the fictional chief of police in “Police,” he slipped into the first person: “Even if I have an affair with one of the local constables—”\n\nI interrupted him and asked if this was a true story. “Not at all!” Chief Sjøvold cried. “That is fiction!” He laughed. Later, he said firmly, “I enjoy reading Jo Nesbø, because it is excitement from page 3.”\n\nNesbø’s novels are marked by the darker elements of parent-child relationships: doubtful paternity (“The Snowman,” in which a killer takes revenge on married women who have had a child by another man and deceived their husbands into thinking the child was theirs), or paternal sacrifice (“Phantom,” in which Harry allows himself to be nearly killed rather than arrest his beloved surrogate son for murder). In “The Leopard,” Harry’s relationship with Olav, the cancer-stricken father he loves but could never connect with, helps propel the plot. Buried in the snow as the result of a villain’s machinations, Harry hears Olav’s voice, encouraging him to give up: “You were scared of the dark, but that didn’t stop you going there.” But, Nesbø writes, “Olav Hole would have to go on ahead; he would have to be that much of a fucking father!”\n\nThis month, Nesbø will publish a novel called “The Son,” about a man whose revenge on those who led his father into corruption also serves as a redemption of his father’s sins. During the Second World War, Nesbø’s father volunteered, at nineteen, to fight alongside Norway’s German occupiers on the Eastern Front, near Leningrad. He believed that the Soviets posed a greater threat to Norway than the Nazis did. After the war, a Norwegian court sentenced Per Nesbø to three years in jail.\n\nPer Nesbø’s voluntary participation in Nazism seems both to haunt Nesbø and to inflame his imagination. “One of the lessons I learned at a young age was that you have to see things from different sides,” he told me. Nesbø, who is fifty-four, has a long, small-boned, triangular face. When I met him, at Bolgen & Moi, a sleek Oslo restaurant that is Nesbø’s favorite, stubble crept up his cheeks from a goatee. His skin is creased and leathery. With a knit cap pulled down low, his features crowding one another, he looks like a gnome. As soon as he takes his cap off, his broad, high forehead makes him, all at once, delicately handsome. Nesbø began to speak as though he were his father: “O.K., I believe that the Jews were not popular in Germany, but when we heard about the concentration camps we didn’t believe that. People just didn’t do that to other people.” He told me that he didn’t know if his father was a member of the Norwegian fascist party that collaborated with the Nazis. After a moment, he said, “Maybe he was.”\n\nPer Nesbø, who died, of cancer, in 1994, recounted his wartime adventures many times for his sons, without shame or embarrassment. “My father would light up whenever he was going to tell a story,” Nesbø said. The tales made their way into “The Redbreast,” a Harry Hole novel, published in 2000, that jumps back and forth between the entrenched Norwegian volunteers outside Leningrad in the early nineteen-forties and a shadowy neo-Nazi conspiracy in fin-de-millennium Norway involving politicians at a high level of government. Nesbø mostly treats the volunteers with compassion, and, by the end of the novel, Norway’s present-day fascists loom larger than their forebears. One volunteer writes in his journal, “The decisions in my life have often been between two or more evils, and I have to be judged on the basis of that. . . . I have risked taking the wrong decision rather than living like a coward as part of the silent majority.”\n\nWhen Per Nesbø got out of prison, he had trouble finding work; he finally landed a job with a firm that made office equipment. He wanted to be his own man, though, Nesbø said, and so he opened his own business, selling kitchen appliances. But it didn’t go well. Drowning in debt, he refused to declare bankruptcy. He felt that his actions during the war made it necessary to satisfy his creditors. Nesbø said that he respected his father for stoically accepting his fate, though it meant abandoning the construction of a dream house, which would have allowed him and Nesbø’s mother, Kirsten, to move out of their small apartment. Kirsten, who worked as a librarian, resented Per for this. One time, when Nesbø was young, his mother took him and his brothers on a trip to Leningrad; his father thought it prudent not to return to the Soviet Union.\n\n“He was honest,” Nesbø said. “He never made excuses for the choice he had made. He was a person who never gave himself the luxury of having a life-lie.” The life-lie is a phrase from Ibsen’s play “The Wild Duck”; it refers to the comforting illusions people cling to in order to go on living.\n\nThe modern Scandinavian crime novel was all but invented in the nineteen-sixties, by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, Swedish partners who borrowed realist elements of the nineteenth-century novel and made the crime genre into a form of social criticism. Though Sweden’s social democracy expanded after the war, the government allied itself with business. Sjöwall and Wahlöö were members of Sweden’s Communist Party; they considered the welfare state to be merely a cover for the plunder of the working class, and were disgusted by what they perceived as the venal, bureaucratic dead end of Sweden’s social democracy. This was fertile ground for the crime novel. In their austere perspective, capitalist crimes were everywhere, and the list of suspects was long.\n\nOne of Sjöwall and Wahlöö’s motives for taking up the genre was to give their views a broader audience, a desire that has driven many of their successors, especially since the international success of the Danish writer Peter Hoeg’s “Smilla’s Sense of Snow,” published in the United States in 1994. Today, about a hundred Scandinavian crime writers have been translated into English, including Anne Holt, who is a former minister of justice in Norway. The crime tale has become to Scandinavia what the sonnet was to Elizabethan England: its trademark literary form.\n\nThe surge had other causes, too. One was the assassination of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, in 1986. Palme was shot in the back on a winter evening while walking home from a movie theatre. His murder has never been solved, but the range of suspects includes just about every threat to Swedish society, past and present, from random sociopaths to neo-Nazis, leftist terrorists, and South African pro-apartheid extremists. Nesbø’s publisher, Trygve Åslund, said that Palme’s murder also sent tremors through Norway and Denmark, with which Sweden shares tight social, political, and linguistic bonds.\n\nThe paranoia engendered by Palme’s killing endowed the Scandinavian crime novel with a horrifying vitality. Without the assassination, there might never have been a Stieg Larsson, whose leftist “millennium trilogy,” beginning with “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” (2005), conjures vast webs of conspiracy. The books’ female protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, has the same first name as Palme’s widow. One of the Swedish writer Henning Mankell’s novels, “The Troubled Man” (2009), takes up the Palme affair; Mankell has also written a play about the assassination. In “Another Time, Another Life” (2003), by Leif G. W. Persson, who is also Swedish, Palme’s murder is the background for the novel’s sinister atmosphere. “Nothing’s the same here since they killed Palme,” a police detective says.\n\nAnother reason the crime genre flourished, particularly in Norway, was the discovery of oil off the Norwegian coast, in 1969. By the late nineteen-seventies, the profits had begun to flow into the Norwegian economy. While the wealth has strengthened the welfare state—in Norway, health care and higher education are virtually free—it also created a new class of privilege. The crime novel was an effective vehicle for the expression of fears and resentment.\n\nThe nation’s new wealth also opened the door to voices, like Nesbø’s, that were more frankly critical of society, sometimes audaciously so. In 2011, Anders Behring Breivik killed seventy-seven people, most of them the young sons and daughters of the country’s liberal political élite, whom Breivik hunted down on an island retreat. Nesbø told Britain’s Independent that he was proud of his country’s restrained response to the massacre, but he also complained that Norwegians “fell in love with [their] reaction to the tragedy,” preening themselves on being “so calm, wise and full of love.” Nesbø’s remarks passed virtually without comment in Norway, where criticism of the country’s smug insularity can itself often be a source of pride. “We can sometimes be too self-confident, too narrow-minded,” Jens Stoltenberg said.\n\nBreivik was a monstrous exception: in a country that had only forty-five homicides last year, all murder is local and intimate. “A murder in Oslo or in a remote, small Swedish city or village is a shocking event,” Nesbø told me. In his novels, he said, murders become “symbols of other things—chaos, the fear that what we see as safe and solid civilization really is just varnish.”\n\nNesbø’s crime stories have little in common with the tradition of left-wing social criticism that shaped the work of Swedish writers like Sjöwall and Wahlöö, Larsson, and Mankell. They would never have written sympathetically about the Norwegian volunteers outside Leningrad. Though Nesbø’s social insights can be mordant—in “The Bat,” Harry refers to Norway’s resource-intensive economy, saying, “We’ve just exported our nature and avoided thinking. We’re a nation with golden hair up our arses”—he tends to be less ideological. In his work, there are not the same connections between capital and corruption. Instead, Nesbø’s villains include an Aborigine boxer, a saintly assassin, and a disaffected son who wanders into the drug trade.\n\nFor all the chilling moral ambiguity of Scandinavian crime fiction, the genre’s most famous detectives have traditionally been heroes. Even Lisbeth Salander, in her furious revenge on male predators, remains within the boundaries of some kind of higher morality. But Harry Hole, to the degree that his effectiveness as a detective lies in the amorality he shares with his outlaw prey, is closer to the genre’s American antiheroes.\n\nNesbø’s masterpiece, “The Snowman,” exploits the unease caused in Scandinavia by the sense that its orderly civilization may be an illusion. The novel begins with a mother who has left her son in the car while she goes to a tryst with her lover. When she returns, her son whispers into her ear, “We’re going to die.” A serial killer is murdering unfaithful women, and gradually Nesbø spins the murders out of the realm of crime and into the question of paternity. Emotional betrayals and the act of killing come to seem nearly identical. The murderer’s signature is to use a body part of his victim in the construction of a snowman in the victim’s yard. As the novel progresses, the figure of the snowman becomes symbolic of a naïve belief in the sanctity of marriage. Harry’s pursuit of the killer is entangled in his tortured relationship with Rakel, his on-again, off-again lover, and with her son, Oleg, whom he treats as his own. The killer, it turns out, is a doctor—the symbol of rationality and order in a country where socialized medicine is a national emblem.\n\nBut Nesbø’s shattering of rationality and order is itself supremely rational and ordered. Don Bartlett, a British translator who has worked on several of Nesbø’s novels, said, “Nesbø sees a scene, there’s a pause, and then he flicks to the next scene. You can just see that he thinks as a cinemagoer.” Often Nesbø leaves the subject out of the sentence, quickening the pace. Bartlett said that Karl Ove Knausgaard, Norway’s other literary celebrity, whom he also translates, has coincidentally begun to do the same thing.\n\nNesbø sometimes achieves his effects at the expense of ordinary human feeling. The pace can flatten characters into cartoons. And the women are treated with either brutality or rank sentimentality. Even by the standards of crime fiction, Nesbø can become so absorbed in his neatly whirring spectacle of inhumanity that all the giddy slaughter bogs down the plot. Nesbø told me that he reveres the work of Frank Miller, the author of the graphic novels “Sin City” and “300,” and there are times when his affinity for the comic book overwhelms his finesse. In “The Son,” the eyelids of a bad guy are cut off by another bad guy; surgeons replace them using the foreskin of his penis. Nesbø writes, “It stank of dick curd when he rubbed his eyes in the morning.” The quality of his prose is another aspect of his writing that is sometimes sacrificed to the demands of pace and plot.\n\nIn high school, Nesbø neglected his studies to concentrate on soccer. He became a star player in Molde. “I peaked as a celebrity when I was seventeen,” he told me, when he made his début with Molde FK, a top Norwegian soccer club. When he was eighteen, he won the prize for best junior player at the prestigious Norway Cup. But torn ligaments in both knees made an athletic career impossible, and he didn’t have the grades to get into college. He signed up for the Air Force and spent a year stationed on the lonely northern tip of Norway, where he worked in an administrative position. While there, he studied to get into business school, and spent his off-hours reading, playing guitar, and listening to music.\n\nAdmitted to the Norwegian School of Economics, in Bergen, he held a variety of jobs during the summers: cabdriver, factory worker, merchant seaman. He spent the next several years after graduation working in Oslo as a financial analyst. At night, he played guitar and sang in a wildly popular band, Di Derre (Those Guys), which, in 1996, won the Gammleng Award, a major Norwegian culture prize. Nesbø’s former bandmate Espen Stenhammer told me that when Nesbø was young he sometimes was so excited by the audience’s attention that he sang and played off key. Nesbø described the crime novel to me as “the punk rock of literature,” comparing punk audiences tangling with the musicians onstage to readers immersing themselves in the crime writer’s manipulations of the genre’s conventions.\n\nHis first novel, “The Bat,” was published in 1997. He wrote it in a few weeks, during a vacation in Australia. Never an avid reader of crime novels, he chose the genre because it seemed easier to write than the memoir of his life as a rock star that a publisher friend had asked him for.\n\nNesbø lives alone in a duplex apartment in Oslo’s upscale Majorstuen district. He has a fourteen-year-old daughter named Selma, who lives nearby with her mother. He refuses to talk about either of them, saying that Selma’s mother, whom he never married, “doesn’t like the limelight.” On the first floor is Nesbø’s bedroom; a large photograph of a full moon hangs over his bed. When I visited him, in March, we ascended a bright-red spiral staircase to a large space divided into a kitchen, a sitting area, and his office. A computer screen sat on a blond desk facing a picture window that looked out over the neat jumble of Oslo’s rooftops to the low mountains just outside the city. A large photograph of a quarter moon, its dark side clearly silhouetted against the sky, hung nearby. The moon photographs were from the Apollo 13 mission, the “Houston, we have a problem” mission, as Nesbø put it. An electric guitar stood in a stand just behind his desk. Off to the side was a bright-red chair with voluptuous curves—the Surrealist term “biomorphic” sprang to mind—and a matching ottoman in the shape of a ball.\n\nDressed in a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers, Nesbø made coffee. We sat at a long wooden table, Rickie Lee Jones playing in the background. Nesbø said that Ibsen’s plays were similar to crime novels, since they don’t reveal their secrets—their crimes—until the final act. Knut Hamsun was a favorite of his when he was younger, he said, though Hamsun’s novels weren’t on the school curriculum. Nesbø said that he admired the way, in Hamsun’s fiction, “a person is lying and you know he’s lying. You just have to flip the coin and you get the truth.”\n\nWhen we stood up, Nesbø stopped in front of the curvy red chair. “What do you think it is supposed to be?” he asked me. I said I didn’t know. “Guess.” I thought for a minute and said again that I didn’t know. “Try,” he said. “Come on.” I said that it looked like some kind of biomorphic chair. Nesbø smirked. “Obviously, it’s a mother giving birth to a child,” he said. “The chair is the mother, and the ball is the child. That’s the umbilical,” he said, pointing to a thick black cord attaching the ottoman to the chair.\n\nDownstairs, Nesbø took me into his daughter’s room, which was as much a shrine to his own achievements and interests as it was a teen-age girl’s bedroom. Nesbø is an avid climber, and there was a climbing wall on one side of the room. A group of photographs stood on a shelf. One depicted him in an early incarnation of Di Derre. The four musicians, their arms around one another, mugged for the camera. Nesbø looked astonishingly young: blond and smooth-faced under a colorful knit cap, with an insolent, punkish expression. His brother Knut, who died last year, of cancer, at fifty-two, was next to him, his long blond hair cascading over his face. “He looks like Kurt Cobain!” Nesbø exclaimed, as if noticing the resemblance for the first time. He had told me earlier, “All the things I long for, those are not things in the future. Those are things in the past.”\n\nIt was dark outside, and the building was quiet. Nesbø walked me to the door and then lingered there, talking about his current projects. He was especially animated about a TV series in which the Russians conquer and occupy Norway, in order to obtain the country’s oil. No shots are fired, and the Russians do not interfere with people’s everyday lives. “The question is, if materially you have the same life, what do really big words like ‘freedom,’ ‘independence’ mean?” Nesbø said. “Are you willing to fight for big words like that? It seems like you have everything to lose and you’re not sure what you have to gain.”\n\nAt a packed event one evening at Oslo’s Litteraturhuset, where a psychiatrist interviewed Nesbø about his work, the author sat on a low stage in front of about a hundred people. Wearing a blue blazer over a white T-shirt, meticulously cuffed jeans, and black military-style boots, he explained how he develops a novel: from a short synopsis to a fuller treatment, to a longer outline, to the finished work, like a screenwriter constructing a screenplay. Nesbø is a devotee of American film noir—before he wrote “The Bat,” he was “more into crime movies” than crime novels, he said—and he likes to envisage scenes playing out on a movie screen before he writes them. Three of his novels have been optioned by movie studios, and another—“Blood on Snow,” written under his Johansen pseudonym—is in development at Warner Bros. With restrained, slightly ironic boastfulness, he told me that the night before we met at Bolgen & Moi he had had dinner with Channing Tatum, who has signed on to star in and direct “The Son.”\n\nAt Litteraturhuset, Nesbø reflected on the novelist’s responsibility to confront readers with moral dilemmas. He said that evil changes depending on who is looking at it. He referred to Michael Corleone’s metamorphosis from war hero to murderous gangster, in “The Godfather.” Readers “become morally corrupted,” he said, as they follow Harry Hole’s descents into Hell. “Many conversations on evil start with the concentration camp guards,” he said. “I’m not sure that this is where we should start looking.” He continued, “There is the other evil, when night falls, the man who . . . rapes that child. . . . That is the evil I’m after. And he isn’t the type to work at a German concentration camp.”\n\nNesbø later sent me an e-mail elaborating on his remarks. “I’m not sure whether brainwashed people following orders, no matter how stupid, cowardly, mindless, and evil they may be, represent the purest evil imaginable,” he wrote. “What I look for in my antagonists is the pure evil of proactive individuals . . . who will actively inflict pain on others without there being any orders, peer pressure or propaganda.” It was an interesting proposition, but I was also struck by how frequently Nesbø indulged his impulse to situate evil outside history, in aberrant individuals.\n\nAfter the interview at Litteraturhuset, there was a reception in the café. Nesbø glided between groups of people sitting at long tables and high stools. Saying his goodbyes, he kissed the bare shoulder of a woman in her mid-forties, a crime writer named Sidsel Dalen, with whom he shares a publisher. He stared into her eyes with a provocative smile. She smiled back, and then he left. After he was gone, she said of Harry Hole, “He has this woman, Rakel, and she has been there throughout all the books. And he has sex with her when it suits him, and he can retreat, and that is a male perspective. Because if you turned this the other way around and you had a female hero, and she had sex with a man whenever, and she left in the meantime, everyone would ask what’s wrong with her. I think that the way he’s inspired me is that I want to make a really strong female character. I want to make Rakel alive.”\n\nThe next morning, Nesbø picked me up at my hotel in a taxi. He doesn’t own a car, because it is too much trouble to find parking in Oslo. Instead, he depends on his bicycle and on what he impishly refers to as “designated drivers.” We were headed for the airport—he was flying to Stockholm to appear on “Skavlan,” a sort of Scandinavian “Charlie Rose.” Done in a mixture of Norwegian, Swedish, and English, it is one of the most popular talk shows in Europe. Nesbø sat in the front. Though the day was cloudy, he was wearing dark glasses.\n\nThe taxi sped along the highway, past farms and car dealerships. Nesbø gazed at the road in front of him and talked about the way that his writing intersects with his work in Di Derre, which still performs occasionally. “I do take on different personas,” he said. “It’s a different character that walks onstage. Sometimes I will even fall out of character in that role and just laugh, just to make sure that you understand what is happening, that this is not for real. Your job now is to scream because I’m wiggling my ass, yeah, and you do scream. Good. Now we have an understanding.\n\n“I am, of course, an exhibitionist. When you sit down and you write your first sentence, the idea that you start out with is, of course, not that I’m going to write five hundred pages, I’m going to send it to a publishing house. The idea is that somebody there with six years’ education will think this is great stuff. They will send it to a designer who will make a great cover for you, people will pay a lot of money, and they will read every fucking word that you have written. And afterward you expect them to come up to you in the street: ‘Can I shake your hand? Can I have your autograph?’ That is the grand idea that you see when you start writing. If not, you wouldn’t need to write it.”\n\nAt the airport, we went to a café, where Nesbø ordered a sandwich and coffee. He flirted with a young Indian woman at the cash register. I asked him what he said to her. “I asked her out,” he said. “Did you?” I asked. “No,” he said.\n\nAlmost everyone I spoke to about him remarked on his ferocious competitiveness—the sort of intensity that, among other things, drives Nesbø not to let society or history have the last word on his father. “He always likes to win,” Jens Stoltenberg said. Sitting in the waiting area at our gate, Nesbø and I started talking about Michael Corleone. Soon, Nesbø was vying with me to describe what was going through Michael’s mind, in the first “Godfather” movie, when he throws away the gun after shooting the gangster and the police captain in a Bronx restaurant. Nesbø was so intent on the game that neither he nor I heard the announcement that our gate had been changed. We hurried to the new gate. The door was closed. “Why don’t you tell someone who you are?” I asked. “Maybe they’ll open the door.” He looked annoyed. “In Norway, you don’t get results like that,” he said. We found the airline’s service desk, where Nesbø waited as a gruff, heavyset woman read his ticket. After a minute or so, she told him that because he was “such a great writer” she was going to get us on the next flight, even though it was full. He blushed.\n\nFor the past five years, Nesbø has gone climbing in the mountains outside Oslo and, when the weather is bad, in a gym. Every year, he takes a climbing trip to a national park in Thailand. “Most of the things I’ve done in life have come quite easy to me,” Nesbø told me. “Climbing has not. I have a fear of heights, and I have to face my own fears.”\n\nNesbø went to the gym one day with one of his climbing buddies, a bald, soft-looking man named Erik, whom Nesbø calls “the German,” even though he is Danish and admitted to me that he dislikes the nickname. As Erik held the rope, Nesbø climbed the wall; its colorful artificial rocks, or holds, looked like large clumps of Play-Doh stuck on by children. Nesbø climbed with deliberation, trying a hold, then another one, carefully gripping it and moving his feet up once he felt secure. He paused, standing on two holds, and shook his hands to get the numbness out of them. Resuming his ascent, he grabbed a hold with each hand and let his feet dangle, as if testing, or perhaps displaying, his strength. ♦"
