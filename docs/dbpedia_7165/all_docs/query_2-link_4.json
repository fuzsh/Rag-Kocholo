        "text": "StålsprångetThe Steel Spring\n\nInspector Jensen\n\nNot a crime, but a peculiarly chilling and plausible political horror is the subject of the second and final part in Per Wahlöö’s diptych with Chief-Inspector Jensen. Already known to readers of the first part in the diptych, Murder On The Thirty-First Floor, Chief-Inspector Jensen is not a detective in the ordinary fictional sense. He belongs to a hypothetical but discomfittingly realistic Northern country of the near future, where paternalistic government, on the principles of the broilerhouse, has been carried to its logical end. Where newspapers are designed for reassurance, unsolved difficulties are concealed and suppressed, and wrong thoughts are held to be unthinkable. In The Steel Spring, this country of the sterile and half-alive is suddenly cut off from communication with the rest of the world, and from its own governing class who have fled the capital. Jensen returns to penetrate the silence and mystery of the sudden curtain that has fallen over the people.\n\nIn Per Wahlöö’s powerfully imaginative diptych with Chief-Inspector Jensen, Murder On The Thirty-First Floor and The Steel Spring, he clearly demonstrates the gift he and Orwell possesses, namely that of elevating the expression of his ideas by apparently depersonalising his subjects.\n\nMord på 31:a våningenMurder on the Thirty-First Floor\n\nInspector Jensen\n\nThis chilling yet satirical semi-surrealistic political thriller is set in an unnamed Northern country in a horribly possible future world. A paternal government spoonfeeds the stolid unthinking masses with tales of show-piece Royals and of successful, materialistic workers. Taste has been deadened through the medium of sugary newspapers and magazines, all the monopoly of a publishing trust organization housed in a huge glass tower which overlooks the whole city. An anonymous letter arrives to say that there is a bomb in the building. It is in effect a hoax, and Chief-Inspector Jensen is given a week to find the culprit. There are false confessions. Then Jensen begins to wonder if the heads of the trust really want him to pry into their secrets. What is the mystery of the 31st floor?\n\nMurder on the Thirty-First Floor, the first part of Per Wahlöö’s diptych with Chief-Inspector Jensen, is another crisp, fast-moving, sardonic story of ruthless power-politics by the author hailed as one of the 20th century’s finest Swedish writers.\n\nGeneralernaThe Generals\n\nCorporal Edwin Velder is on trial for his life. Some of his 127 alleged crime are military, but others are civil and moral: bigamy, rape, and sacrilege. The Generals, Per Wahlöö’s most complex novel, takes the form of the proceedings of the trial, stretching over three months. The trial is of great political importance to the regime. The result is foregone conclusion: Velder has been prepared in prison by “specialists” for three years. He is a physical and mental wreck and confesses to all but one of the charges. In reality the court-martial is an elaborate rehearsal of the events of the last eight years. The past and the dead are on trial. A group of civilized, intelligent men took over the island, we learn, and began to build an ideal state. There were no politics, religion, laws, bureaucracy, or taxes. The country was carefully developed and enjoyed great prosperity and general happiness under the loosely exercised authority of the state’s founders. After five years the first cracks appeared with a disagreement in the ruling council. Slow disintegration set in: a secret armed force was built up by one of the rulers, and eventually civil war broke out. The rout of the liberal party was followed by full-scale fighting between the “fascists” and the “reds”. At the time of the trial the country has enjoyed, officially, three years of peace after the cease-fire, but in fact the Generals, who rule with an iron grip, are ceaselessly struggling for power with one another. The military tribunal, a gallery of fanaticism and obtuse cruelty, forces Velder to reconstruct the events, personalities, ideals, battles, and final defeat of the island revolution. As the inevitable verdict is pronounced on the innocent, unprotesting Velder, the latest coup takes place.\n\nThe Generals is a political novel but told with Wahlöö’s sardonic humor and thriller writer’s sense of suspense. He is too subtle a moralist to draw an obvious allegory or point a message for his readers. They must draw their own conclusions from what is Wahlöö’s most demanding and satisfying novel.\n\nUppdragetThe Assignment\n\nThe Provincial Resident of a desolate province in a South American country has been assassinated. When Manuel Ortega, a minor diplomat, accepts the appointment as the dead man’s successor, it seems a foolhardy decision. From the day he assumes his post he is thrown into a violent, corrupt world, where two extremist political factions are trying to destroy each other. Ortega is the proverbial man in the middle, surrounded by men and women he wants to trust - his secretary, the cy\n\nnical Chief of Police, and the sullen bodyguards who try to keep the Resident alive. Political and moral undercurrents, and a brutally ironic climax.\n\nThe Assignment is another brilliant and tense novel by a Scandinavian Franz Kafka.\n\nReviews\n\n“A frighteningly effective and clear book. /…/ *The Assignment *is a novel with clear documentation as an organic component, but set up for a brave film director (perhaps a Kubrick). It is as exciting as a thriller by Graham Greene, unpleasant, because its not written as entertainment, but in concentrated novel form sets forth shocking material. /…/ An international book of unseen cogency.”\n\nJyllands-Posten, Denmark\n\n“The Assignment is something as uncommon as a political thriller which is equally excellent as a thriller and as a political novel. You rush through it with pounding heart and cold hands, but it is so precisely constructed and so sensually written that it is impossible to read it superficially.”\n\nInformation, Denmark\n\n“Frighteningly effective.”\n\nSvenska Dagbladet, Sweden\n\nLastbilenA Necessary Action\n\nThis gripping and highly disturbing novel takes place in a coastal village in Spain - not the tourist Spain of toreadors and castanets, but a country of passionate and brooding people with the fury of the Civil War still fresh in their minds. A land of poverty, of hot summers and cold winters, and of violence hidden by fear. Against this backdrop, Dan and Siglinde Pedersen – a cheerful, irresponsible and beautiful couple from Norway – live in a dilapidated cottage with their lonely and introspective companion, Willi Mohr. When Siglinde Pederen sees her husband murdered, and is then brutally raped and killed, it sets Willi Mohr, the hitherto apathetic anti-hero, on his own violent road to resolving the conflict between alienation and commitment.\n\nRegarded as one of the most extraordinary and exciting Scandinavian novels of the sixties, The Lorry is a unique fusion of tension, social insight, and awareness of the connection between political frustration and sexual violence.\n\n“A Necessary Action is necessary reading.”\n\nVinden och regnetThe Wind and the Rain\n\nSpain 1955. Two rootless survivors share a short journey before an indomitable catastrophe shatters their hopes and slight chance of happiness. Both are damaged by the cruel reality that hounds them. He is poisoned by a misanthropic ideology; she is its already scarred victim - a Jew without a country. An act of violence forces them into a joined escape and during a short boat passage between two islands, with their pursuers at their heels, panic brings them together in a passionate and intensely rendered encounter.\n\nHövdingenThe Chief\n\nPer Wahlöö’s 1959 debut The Chief is a classic sports novel, as extraordinarily festive as it is savage in its description of the game in the lower soccer divisions. Behind the quirkiness lie darker undercurrents; already in this debut one can trace Wahlöö’s dedication to social issues.\n\nIt is also a book about human ruthlessness. The team leader known as The Chief is an unconscionable climber, determined to raise his worthless team higher in the divisions, no matter the costs. For The Chief, his own success and that of the team have become synonymous. And in The Chief’s world, the game set on the pitch is often less important than that played out behind the scenes.\n\nSALOMONSSON AGENCY"
