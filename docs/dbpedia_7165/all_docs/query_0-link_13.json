        "text": "June 22, 2024\n\nThis is a truly fabulous book — a political thriller, of sorts — but much more. Possibly the best thing Wahlöö ever wrote. Can’t recommend this enough.\n\nJuly 27, 2018\n\nPer Wahlöö, co-author of the remarkable Martin Beck series of Swedish detective novels, here takes a solo outing, departing from the crime novel genre into that of diplomatic intrigue. In THE ASSIGNMENT, a South American diplomat, Manuel Ortega, is ordered to replace a provincial official after the man's assassination. Ortega must try to establish peace, or at least an end to violence, between the wealthy white population of the province and the Indian peasants who have united against them in hopes of liberating themselves from oppression. Much of the novel depicts Ortega waiting tensely and tediously for events to occur, yet there is nothing tedious for the reader. When events do break, what happens is both exciting and intelligent, with turns and intrigue accelerating the tension. There is a strong philosophical debate at play between Ortega and the police commander who is both his political opponent and his greatest source of security, and Wahlöö, a deeply political writer even in his most commercial works, makes no secret of where he stands on the issues at play in the story. At times deceptively even-paced, THE ASSIGNMENT turns out to be a sturdy exploration of the lifelong fight between true good and true evil and the grey areas where so much of life exists. A highly engaging book.\n\nNovember 26, 2019\n\nEski mardinde gezerken denk geldiğim bir sahafın raflarını karıştırırken karşılaştığım güzel kitap. Şuanki bulunduğum durum ve konum itibarıyla kitabı rahatça bitirmek pek kolay olmasa da neyse ki kimse elimde görüp neyden bahsediyor bu diye sormadı. Kitapla alakası olmayan insanların arasında zaman geçirmenin faydalarından biri de bu olsa gerek .\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nA serious book that, sadly, could have easily shifted into a farcical lampoon.\n\nThere is no doubt that the petty diplomat protagonist is trying to improve the world and \"do good things,\" but where Wahloo lets us get closer to the oppositional figures, most notably in the police chief, we get mired in the complexity of their being no real \"bad guys,\" or at least none among the people who are themselves close to the action.\n\nThe sex in the book is an intersting reflection on this. The happily married diplomat moves easily into an affair with his secretary, and he barely reflects back on his family even when faced with death, those particular mores when being in a difficult situation changing for him easily.\n\nOr it could be just what is needed to sell a pop novel.\n\nStill, an interesting study of whether or not (or how much) one should stand up to the \"inevitable\" forces.\n\nJuly 15, 2018\n\nHaving finished the complete Martin Beck series by Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall, I f0und and read this page turning solely authored Wahloo novel set in a bleak unnamed South American country--so a hotter, and bleaker, world than Sweden. Left a similar sadness than in spite of good efforts and human foibles, things don't work and and perhaps not only stay the same but are worse. I do like the writing.\n\nMay 27, 2022\n\nThis is undoubtedly the best of Wahlöö's non-mystery novels. Something of a political thriller, which I'm shocked I even condescended to glance through. Psycholically taut, philosophically terse (and realistic). I think Wahlöö was a member of the Communist Party, but you really wouldn't know it by his books. And that is great.\n\nOctober 29, 2021\n\nI don't know exactly when I read this book but it's a powerful political thriller that I'd heartily recommend.\n\nI've been a ghost member of Goodreads for ages but am intending, who knows if successfully?, to become a more active member.\n\nJune 24, 2020\n\nStarted out as a fairly interesting story but quickly became predictable and comes with a ridiculous ending.\n\nDecember 30, 2022\n\nManuel Ortega accepts the position of the head of local administration in a region plagued by horrible inequality, social injustice, and civil war violence. His decision to serve his country in such an agonizing capacity stems from his good intentions to support the new government that seeks peace and progress. However, he soon realizes that the local well-to-dos are the fascists ready to sabotage his efforts and even endanger his life. He gets to know revolutionaries who fight for the liberation of the oppressed local people. Still, he also meets counter-revolutionaries with their hypocrisy and appalling brutality. In days full of doubts and struggle, he detaches from his past uneventful life and his trivial marital relationship. He finds love that helps him develop his determination. Still, he eventually loses everything, unable to fully face malicious deception, astonishing violence, and fear that prevents him from acting right. In some way, this is an Attic tragedy without catharsis and purification that would bring pity and fear into their proper balance. There is no corrective experience in this tragedy, just the feelings of remaining hopelessness and powerlessness in facing evil.\n\nOctober 24, 2015\n\n3.5 stars : Wahloo's first novel (with an acknowledgment to Maj Sjöwall, his future partner) is dark, brooding and fatalistic. Politics and power trump moral considerations and betrayal and the willingness to allow it to happen is central to this character study of a bland bureaucrat. All through one hopes for redemptive action, but it ends with what has always been inevitable.\n\nNovember 16, 2014\n\nJust eh, didn't like the subject matter nor the characters. Should try another by the author sometime."
