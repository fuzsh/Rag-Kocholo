        "text": "In the Conclusion the authors sum up their findings with reference to different factors at play in the conceptual development of Nordic Noir and claim that four primary perspectives are necessary to decode the conceptual content of Nordic Noir: (a) a common press reference, (b) a brand name, (c) stylistic and narrative content, and (d) a locative concept. By referring to two recent television dramas, Valkyrien and Marcella, the authors conclude that the ‘Nordic’ in Nordic Noir is a very negotiable term which, when Nordic Noir travels as a style, has very little to do with geography and much more with stylistic content. They sum up by suggesting that an emotional turn of the spatial turn of media studies might inspire the further development of location studies.\n\nYou might think you know what Nordic Noir is. Brutal crimes. Harsh landscapes. Brilliant but socially dysfunctional protagonists. Stylish knitwear. Yet, as a generic category and cultural phenomenon, Nordic Noir has always been far more complex. The story of its success owes as much to adaptation and evolution as it does to geographical migration or cosmopolitan curiosity. But how did this happen? What was it about the genre that struck such a chord with international audiences and readers? How did it build on previous trends and influences? And how has the category changed in order to survive in a cutthroat commercial landscape? Has it become less «Nordic »? Less «noir »? Has its proverbial moment in the sun passed? Featuring twelve original chapters and an editorial introduction, The Scandinavian Invasion brings together leading media and literature scholars from the UK, Denmark and Australia to critically examine how the phenomenon took shape and what we can learn from it. By exploring the cultural, aesthetic and industrial forces that propelled Nordic Noir across borders, the book provides a kaleidoscopic look at a disruptive cultural phenomenon in transition. Nordic Noir is dead. Long live Nordic Noir!\n\nAbstract Alexi Sofia, Film Studies, Victoria University of Wellington Abstract of Master’s Thesis, Submitted 10 April 2017: “Investigating Nordic Noir” Scandinavian crime films and television series have become popular in recent years. This thesis explores some of the key texts in ‘Nordic noir’ through a discussion of detectives, the environment, and visual style. The emphasis in the project is on textual analysis. The first chapter examines the figures of Wallander and Lund in Wallander and Forbrydelsen respectively. I argue that the conflicts Nordic detectives often have between work and the domestic sphere are an indication of how gender stereotypes are challenged in the Scandinavian crime genre. The second chapter considers the role of the natural and built environments in Nordic noir. Features such as forests and water play a crucial role in Forbrydelsen because of the ways in which they create uncertainty, anticipation, and suspense. The urban spaces of Bron/Broen develop a sense of anonymity that recalls the function of the city in classic film noir. Rather than developing links between Sweden and Denmark, the series suggests that the Øresund bridge that spans the two countries is ultimately a disconnecting, centrifugal force that functions as what Marc Augé would call a ‘non-place’. The final chapter considers the role of colour and light in the films Insomnia and Jar City. My analysis demonstrates that Nordic noir encompasses more than naturalism and realism. Like classic and neo-noir, it includes a range of expressive aesthetic strategies that serve both narrative and thematic functions.\n\nAs the book’s introduction, this chapter argues that Nordic noir is an under-recognized and in fact constitutive element of Nordic noir and in so doing, reframes the prevailing critical view. Born from the genre of Scandinavian crime fiction and now celebrated for its regional and global sweep, Nordic noir has not been understood as the thoroughly transnational and transmedial phenomenon it is. Deploying the concepts and tools of current adaptation studies to undertake a wide-ranging geographical, transcultural, and intermedial exploration of Nordic noir, this volume approaches it less as a genre than as a brand, network, or family, thus adding an important new layer to the rich scholarship that has arisen around Nordic noir in recent years.\n\nNordic noir can be productively defined as a group style. The global popularity of prototypical Nordic noirs Forbrydelsen (The Killing, 2007–2012) and Bron/Broen (The Bridge, 2011–2018) encourages Nordic filmmakers and television producers to adapt and appropriate their conventions in the hope of reaching large audiences. Employing a specific style is a way of producing crime films and television series in an identifiable manner as Nordic noir. As a key example, the chapter analyzes how “the first Finnish Nordic noir” Sorjonen (Bordertown, 2016–) adapts and appropriates stylistic elements from The Bridge and The Killing in its use of (1) modernist art cinema elements, (2) conventions of the popular crime genre, and (3) Nordic regional elements. These are the three categories essential to Nordic noir.\n\nAbstract Gender politics is at the heart of what crime novelist Hakan Nesser called ‘the strange genre of Nordic Noir’ (quoted in Foreshaw 2012: Preface), a contemporary body of writings with historical roots in a heavy political subtext that betrays a wider dissatisfaction with both the demise of the welfare state and the ideal of post-war utopianism in contemporary Scandinavia. Steig Larsson's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2005) quickly became regarded as a key example of the emerging new genre of Nordic Noir and one of the biggest global publishing phenomena of the twenty-first century. As a result of its popular female protagonist, Lisbeth Salander and section headings featuring damning statistical data about male violence against women in Sweden, the novel has been celebrated as a vessel for Larsson’s ‘deep feminist sympathies’ (Whitelaw 2010). Challenging claims that the novel offers a vision of female empowerment, this article instead suggests that Larsson uses his first fiction, and the wider Millennium Trilogy of which it is a part, to create and cull female characters using the men who ‘hate’ them as representations of the competing tensions between masculinity and violence in the new genre of Nordic Noir. Nordic Noir is the product of claustrophobia, of small countries in the midst of population crises, frustrated at a lack of safety promised in the post-war years and experiencing a growing lack of faith in the authorities governing them. This article suggests that beneath popular imaginaries of seemingly peaceful and equal societies, Nordic Noir exposes violent masculine authority as an expression of the relationship between the individual and the neoliberal state in the twenty-first century.
