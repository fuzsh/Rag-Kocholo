        "text": "Per Wahlöö wrote seven novels outside the partnership with Maj Sjöwall (these two, at least, are dedicated to Maj). Five of them appeared in the UK over the period 1966-74, all amongst the early translations of Joan Tate, that doyenne of Scandinavian translators into English. Collectively, these novels are sometimes known, I understand, as the ‘Dictatorship’ novels, with backgrounds as varied as South America, Franco’s Spain (from which Wahlöö , a committed Marxist, was deported in 1957) as well as the unnamed countries that form the background to these two novels.\n\nBoth novels feature Inspector Jensen, \"a middle-aged police officer of normal build,\" with, at this stage, \"an unlined and expressionless face\". Called to the eighteenth floor of The Skyscraper, home to a huge publishing conglomerate, he is confronted with an anonymous note to the conglomerate threatening a terrible reprisal for \"the murder committed by you.\" An explosive device will detonate shortly, threatening the lives of up to six thousand employees. Jensen first persuades a reluctant management to allow the building to be evacuated. The note, however, is a hoax. Jensen is given seven days to discover the perpetrator.\n\nJensen reappears just once more four years later, in The Steel Spring, published in Sweden in 1968 (the Martin Beck series with Sjowall well under way with The Laughing Policeman). Now 50 and with \"short grey hair\", Jensen is peremptorily summoned from a foreign country where he is recovering (significantly perhaps) from a liver operation. But all communications with his homeland have been suspended amid rumours of violent clashes during a recent election campaign – and a mysterious subsequent epidemic. Stranded at the border, he is commissioned by a government minister in a similar situation to find out the truth.\n\nBoth novels clearly use the form of the crime novel. They are economical and move with great pace, even as Jensen pursues his investigation to its logical conclusion (he’s never been known to fail) and Wahlöö drops in his clues to the nature of the society in which Jensen appears to be a willing participant. Thus Murder (published prior to Roseanna, the first Martin Beck novel) can be seen as a precursor to that series, written – Sjöwall/Wahlöö’s declared aim – to take \"a scalpel\" to \"the belly of … a morally debatable so-called welfare state of the bourgeois type\". But unlike the early apolitical Beck novels (softening up the reader for what came later?), Murder and its successor are nothing if not political.\n\nOr rather Murder is a successful and satisfactory crime and political novel, with a brilliant and chilling twist ending, whilst the less plausible Steel Spring depends rather more on its thriller and political elements to keep you reading until the end.\n\nFascinating too is the discovery that stylistically Wahlöö is also his own man. Sjöwall has already exploded the widespread Ed McBain theory of influence (neither of them had read McBain until they were well into planning and writing the first books). But only more general influence can be attributed to those other writers cited by Sjöwall as their most admired writers of the time: Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett (often quoted by writers of a left-leaning persuasion), Georges Simenon and Ross MacDonald. Indeed it is difficult to find a precise antecedent for Wahlöö’s plain, pared down, emotionless prose. Perhaps Julian Symons was right all those years ago when he cited (alongside Orwell) the crime novels of Friedrich Dürrenmatt. Like that author, Wahlöö clearly wanted nothing to detract from the forward movement of the story and its political/philosophical content.\n\nNeedless to say, translators of the reputation of Tate and her successor Sarah Death, appear to have no difficulty with the style. Comparing the two Murders it is evident that the new version has been subject to general updating – \"juvenile delinquency\" becomes \"youth crime\" for example; some political terminology has been changed. Whilst these changes have the effect of reducing the specific nature of Wahlöö’s bitterly satirical view of the changes in Swedish society, readers of today should have no difficulty in recognising in both books the many parallels between Wahlöö’s invented society, and the society that surrounds us in the present.\n\nTwo unique novels have been restored to the canon of European crime fiction in English. Don’t miss.\n\nReminded, elsewhere, of Georges Simenon’s claim that he used no more than 2000 words of his vocabulary in writing his Maigret stories, I wonder if that wasn’t, after all, a key influence on the Jensen novels?\n\nPer Wahlöö: Murder on the Thirty-first Floor and The Steel Spring, new translations by Sarah Death (Vintage, 2012) pb each £7.99, 215pp and 200pp"
