        "text": "Even before I started writing my various books on Scandinavian crime fiction, I realised that I would have to deal with the notably left-wing perspective of most of the genre, and I trust that I’ve done my duty in this regard. However, Per Hellgren — in his detailed and informed study — has gone much further in identifying the political perspectives of the genre, invoking the great American hard-boiled writer Raymond Chandler — an approach that is certainly new to me.\n\nTwo writers from the left – a crime-writing team with a markedly Marxist perspective – might (without too much argument) be said to have started it all in terms of important Scandinavian crime fiction: the spectacularly talented Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö. Their continuing influence (since the death of Per Wahlöö) remains prodigious.\n\nIt was something of scandal that for some considerable time the complete oeuvre this most influential team of crime writers was not available in translation (certain books – such as The Laughing Policeman (1968) – haunted various publishers’ lists, and then would inexorably melt away). This relative invisibility (until recent – and welcome – reissue programmes remedied this egregious blot on the reputation of publishing) was particularly odd, as the almost viral penetration of the duo’s literary reach was total, with many crime fiction writers citing them as the ne plus ultra of the socially committed crime novel., What’s more, the team has been – in many cases – a source of personal inspiration for the work of contemporary crime writers. The sequence of books featuring their tenacious policeman Martin Beck are shot through with the ideological rigour of his creators; that’s to say: as well as being lean and compelling crime novels, they simultaneously function as an unforgiving leftwing critique of Swedish society (and, inter alia, of Western society in general). But this shouldn’t put off those readers conscious of Marxism’s fall from favour since it first inspired Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö in a very different era; like the elements of Catholicism in Graham Greene’s work (which does not interfere with an appreciation of his peerless skills as novelist), the Marxist underpinnings of Sjöwall and Wahlöö’s Martin Beck books may be considered to be less important than the edgy, pared-down prose in which these finely-honed police procedurals trade. By introducing genuinely radical elements into what was at the time an unthreatening form (with, they felt, distinctly bourgeois values), the duo were able to both enrich and re-energise what had become something of a moribund field, with the realism of their work married to its political attitudes. To this end, the characterising of certain elements in the police force as corrupt or totalitarian was part and parcel of the radical political agenda underlying the books, themes that Hellgren examines here. But at no point in any of the Martin Beck novels (thankfully) are such notions allowed to be transformed into simple agitprop.\n\nMarxist theories have influenced the crime field in various ways since the Thirties, and Hellgren (a journalist) cogently analyses the work of relevant Swedish novelists (not just Sjöwall and Wahlöö) and that of the seminal American writer Raymond Chandler, dealing with direct influence and more subtle strains of political philosophy. It’s a provocative study.\n\nSwedish Marxist Noir by Per Hellgren is published by McFarland"
