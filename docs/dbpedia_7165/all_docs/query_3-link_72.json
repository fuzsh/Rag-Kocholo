        "text": "H.R.F Keating was an English crime fiction writer most notable for his series of novels featuring Inspector Ghote of the Bombay CID. He was also a crime books reviewer for The Times for fifteen years and published a book of his “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books” in 1987.\n\nI needed a new reading challenge after completing my Top 100+ Crime and Mystery novel list challenge so decided to read through all 100 books in H.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books”.\n\nAbout H.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books”\n\nH.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books” is based on his favorite books from the genre. His list is written in order of date published from Edgar Allan Poe (1845) through to P.D James (1986) with a two-page synopsis of his thoughts about the author and their novel. It’s a sort of history of crime writing using the exact approach I ended up following when I worked through my Top 100+ Crime and Mystery novel list challenge – except I wasn’t aware he had used the same approach until I brought his book!\n\nHis rules for selecting which books he included were based on:\n\nNo author should be represented by more than three titles.\n\nAdding a few personal favorites that other reviewers mightn’t have included.\n\nBooks must have crime in them and weren’t pure thrillers, espionage novels, horror stories, pure suspense stories, or considered proper novels like Dostoiesvski’s “Crime and Punishment”. This is why authors like Dick Francis, Daphne Du Maurier, Mary Higgins Clark, and John Le Carre aren’t included in his list.\n\nBooks were also chosen on the basis that in 1987 you were still able to get hold of the book.\n\nI started my H.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books” reading challenge in August 2022. I’ve already read some of his books as they were in my Top 100+ Crime and Mystery novel list challenge. My H.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books” reading challenge is documented on this page and includes a summary of each author and their novels as well as tips for finding the books from his list. I’ve focused on key points I felt would be helpful to others who might want to read the books from his list. For a more detailed review, you need to read H.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books” two-page synopsis of each author and their novel.\n\nI normally prefer reading physical versions of the books rather than e-books and in my previous reading challenge I was able to purchase the majority of the books from charity shops or second-hand book shops.\n\nBooks from H.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books” have been harder to source and the harder to find ones I’ve borrowed from the Internet Archive using the one hour borrow option.\n\nHere is H.R.F Keating’s “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books” for those wanting a copy of his list.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe (1841)\n\nTales of Mystery and Imagination\n\nThe Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) – Classic\n\nThe Mystery of Marie Roget (1842) – Classic\n\nThe Purloined Letter (1844) – Classic\n\nThe Gold Bug (1843) – Classic\n\nEdgar Allan Poe’s Tales of Mystery and Imagination is a compilation of Poe’s suspenseful tales. Poe is better known for his dark tales of terror and the supernatural however many consider Edgar Allan Poe’s three Auguste Dupin short stories as the first detective stories published.\n\nI’ve listed the four short stories to read for those who prefer to read his key short stories rather than the entire Tales of Mystery and Imagination book.\n\nHis three Auguste Dupin short stories provide insight into early detective stories and it’s helpful to be aware of these stories because some of the early 1900’s crime novels reference Dupin. His “The Gold Bug” story was heavily nominated by the Mystery Writers of America and isn’t a detective story; it’s an old-fashioned deciphering of a cryptogram in a tale without a crime.\n\nBelow are links to free ebooks that include the short stories:\n\nThe Works of Edgar Allan Poe – Volume 1\n\nThe Works of Edgar Allan Poe – Volume 2 – The Purloined letter\n\nWilkie Collins (1860)\n\nThe Moonstone\n\nWilkie Collins was an English novelist and playwright whose two novels The Woman in White (1860) and The Moonstone (1868) are considered by many as the precursors of modern mystery novel and suspense novels.\n\nThe novel was originally published in serial form by Charles Dickens, a close friend of Wilkie Collins, in “All the Year Round” and afterward published in book form.\n\nI was originally reluctant to read Wilkie Collins’s novels as I was worried being written in the 1800s that they would be hard to read and include content I couldn’t relate to. I love all his novels. “The Moonstone” uses the multi-narration method where different sections of the novel are told by different characters which isn’t commonly used nowadays but was very effective in developing the stories.\n\nThe Moonstone is about a priceless stone that goes missing soon after being given as a present on a birthday and the investigation to find what happened to the stone.\n\nThe book can be downloaded as free ebooks from Project Gutenberg. I sourced my paperback version from a charity shop.\n\nCharles Dickens (1870)\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood is the final novel written by Charles Dickens and he dies before he finished this novel. No one knows how he intended to end it and only six of the planned twelve installments were published.\n\nAn incredible novel that I really enjoyed reading. Wasn’t easy to find in charity shops and wish I had realized sooner that I could have downloaded the free ebook here.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle (1887)\n\nThe Complete Sherlock Holmes (1887-1927)\n\nH.R.F Keating lists the following Arthur Conan Doyle books on his list:\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)\n\nThe Hounds of the Baskerville (1902)\n\nI’ve listed “The Complete Sherlock Holmes” book as that is the best way to read his stories if you are interested in his character development.\n\nBeing reluctant to read Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories after watching the different movie and TV adaptations, I now appreciate how amazing his stories are and how they’ve withstood the test of time.\n\nSherlock Holmes wasn’t the first fictional detective but he is the “most portrayed movie character” in history. The Sherlock Holmes stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories, has been credited as an influence on forensic science due to Holmes’ use of methods such as fingerprints, trace evidence, serology, ciphers, and footprints long before they were commonly used by the police.\n\nYou can read my detailed review of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his work here.\n\nMy hardest task was working out where to start so here’s my recommendation of order to read:\n\nA Study in Scarlet (1887) – introduces Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.\n\nThe Sign of Four (1890) – introduces Dr. Watson’s future wife Mary.\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes – 12 short stories published in The Strand in 1891-1892 with the most famous being “A Scandal in Bohemia” which introduces Irene Adler.\n\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes – 11 short stories published in The Strand in 1892-1893 with the most famous being “The Final Problem” which kills off Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes – 13 short stories published in The Strand in 1903-1904 with the most famous being “The Adventures of the Empty House” where Sherlock Holmes is resurrected.\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – serialized in the Strand in 1901-1902. Considered by many as the best Sherlock Holmes novel.\n\nThe Valley of Fear – serialized in The Strand from 1914–1915.\n\nHis Last Bow: Some Later Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes – stories published 1908–1917.\n\nThe Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes – stories published 1921–1927.\n\nYou can read as individual novels or you’ll find them all in The Penguin Complete Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. His books can be downloaded as free ebooks or easily found in charity shops.\n\nE.W. Hornung 1899-1904\n\nThe Collected Raffles\n\nH.R.F Keating lists the novel as “The Amateur Cracksman” however it wasn’t until I read “The Amateur Cracksman” that I realized two of the stories, “The Fate of Faustina” and “A Jubilee Present”, he includes in his two-page synopsis of E.W. Hornung is from “The Black Mask”.\n\nThe best option is to read E.W. Hornung’s “The Collected Raffles” which includes his entire collection of Raffles stories – his character Raffles was referred to as the Amateur Cracksman. I’m assuming when H.R.F Keating lists “The Amateur Cracksman” he was actually referring to “The Collected Raffles”.\n\n“The Collected Raffles” is E.W. Hornung’s collection of Raffles short stories and is based on A.J Raffles, a gentleman thief in late Victorian Great Britain who is assisted by his friend Harry “Bunny” Manders.\n\nH.R.F Keating rates E.W. Hornung stories about A.J. Raffles, a gentleman burglar, squarely beside Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories. E.W. Hornung was married to Arthur Conan Doyle’s sister. Holmes stories are narrated by Watson while Raffles stories are narrated by his sidekick Bunny. Holmes and Raffles are polar opposites with Raffles being like an inversion of Holmes. Holmes fights crime and Raffles plans crime.\n\nIn Arthur Conan Doyle’s 1924 autobiography, Memories and Adventures, he said “I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal a hero.” E.W. Hornung died in 1921 so I decided to find out what crime books reviewer said about E.W. Hornung’s Raffles stories around the time he died compared to H.R.F Keating’s review. I have the benefit of being able to find reviews that were published when E.W. Hornung died which H.R.F Keating didn’t have when he published his book in 1987.\n\nAn excerpt from The Passing of E.W. Hornung published on Thursday 16 June 1921 said “For Sherlock Holmes represented the reaction against crime, and lives in the public favor in virtue of his eccentric skill in fighting it. Raffles, the criminal, is as dead as any Deadwood Dick hero that ever had a brief hour of popularity. With the younger generation, a reference to him almost needs an explanatory note. Older readers and theatre-goers recall him with languid indifference. The vogue of Raffles only ran through a very few years and would have faded out still more quickly but for the clever stage presentation.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle’s comment in his 1924 autobiography was a reflection that by the time E.W. Hornung died Raffles was no longer popular.\n\n“The Collected Raffles” contains:\n\nThe Amateur Cracksman (1899)\n\nThe Black Mask (1901)\n\nA Thief in the Night (1905)\n\nI’m not sure I would have appreciated the Raffles stories as much if I only read “The Amateur Cracksman” as the characters developed more with each book.\n\nHis books can be downloaded as free ebooks or occasionally found in charity shops/second-hand bookshops.\n\nJacques Futrelle (1907)\n\nThe Thinking Machine (1907)\n\nJacques Futrelle was an American journalist and mystery writer best known for his short detective stories featuring Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen who was known as “The Thinking Machine” for his use of logic when solving mysteries supported by his friend and companion, Hutchinson Hatch, reporter of a fictional newspaper called The Daily New Yorker. He died shortly after his thirty seventh birthday on board the Titanic.\n\nThe Thinking Machine book contains the following three short stories:\n\nThe Problem of Cell 13\n\nThe Case of the Flaming Phantom\n\nThe Mystery of the Silver Box\n\nHere is a link for reading the Thinking Machine Book using the Internet Archive. I read it by purchasing The First Thinking Machine Omnibus: The Problem of Cell 13 & The Thinking Machine on the Case eBook as didn’t realize the book was available in the Internet Archive.\n\nMary Roberts Rinehart (1908)\n\nThe Circular Staircase (1908)\n\nMary Roberts Rinehart was considered America’s Agatha Christie. The Circular Staircase is considered the pioneer of “had I but known” mystery writing.\n\nI love reading her novels as her style is similar to Agatha Christie. In addition to The Circular Staircase I’ve read the following novels:\n\nThe Man in Lower Ten (1909)\n\nThe Window at the White Cat (1910)\n\nThe Case of Jennie (1913)\n\nThe After House (1914)\n\nKings, Queens and Pawns: An American Woman at the Front (1915)\n\nThe Door (1930)\n\nEnjoyed reading her autobiography My Story (1931) and the updated version of My Story (1948) that she published in later years.\n\nAll of her books I’ve read as ebooks as I’ve only once seen her books in a shop in Australia. Some of her ebooks can be downloaded for free here.\n\nG.K Chesterton (1911)\n\nThe Innocence of Father Brown (1911)\n\nThe Father Brown short stories were originally published in various magazines and later collated into five books. The first of the books published was The Innocence of Father Brown in 1911.\n\nCan’t decide how I feel about the Father Brown stories. I’ve only managed to get so far the series of stories each time I try to read The Innocence of Father Brown! Worth reading for those that enjoy the Father Brown TV series to see how the show evolved from the stories.\n\nI might have had more luck if I downloaded the free ebook rather than forgetting which short story I was up in my book!\n\nMelville Davisson Post (1918)\n\nUncle Abner (1918)\n\nMelville Davisson Post was an American writer best known for his short stories based on Uncle Abner, a mystery solving, justice dispensing West Virginian backwoodsman. His Uncle Abner stories first appeared in American newspapers. He published 22 Uncle Abner stories between 1911 until 1928.\n\nHere is a link to the Complete Uncle Abner book on the Internet Archive.\n\nEdgar Wallace (1925)\n\nThe Mind of JG Reeder (1925)\n\nEdgar Wallace was one of the most prolific thriller writers of the early 1900s. He was once considered second in popularity to Dickens and his popularity diminished after his death. At one stage he was producing one in every four novels sold in England.\n\nThe Four Just Man was the first novel of his I read and I really struggled reading it. It was only after reading some of his other novels that I appreciated how enjoyable his novels can be. Part of the issue may be I struggled to relate the earlier spy novels compared to crime novels.\n\nThe Mind of JG Reeder can be read online here and is a series of short stories featuring a police officer working for the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was published as The Mind of JG Reeder in the UK and The Murder Book of JG Reeder in USA. The order of the short stories varied between the UK and USA edition. The short stories were originally published in magazines before being published as a book.\n\nIt is common to see his books in charity shops. Some of his ebooks, including “Four Just Men”, can be downloaded for free here.\n\nAgatha Christie (1926)\n\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926) Poirot novel – The Golden Age\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (1934) Poirot novel – The Golden Age\n\nSleeping Murder (1976) – stand-alone novel\n\nI’m probably classified as an Agatha Christie fan based on my collection of her novels and other books related to her work and life. I read a selection of her novels when I was a teenager and initially started by reading “The Murder of Roger Ackroyd” in my Top 100+ Crime and Mystery novel list challenge and ended up reading over 50 of her books.\n\nI feel I would have appreciated “The Murder of Roger Ackroyd” if I had read the Hercule Poirot novels in order of date published. The four novels included in this list are considered the best but aren’t my favorites. At least two of these novels represent a unique or different approach to crime writing that hadn’t been done before.\n\nMy recommendation is to start with “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” in the Hercule Poirot series. You can download a Poirot Reading List here which includes tips on the order and which to read. Here is the Miss Marple Reading list and you’ll find the complete Agatha Christie Reading list here.\n\n“Sleeping Murder” was written during the Second World War but published after her death. Some consider this book one of her best.\n\nYou can download a few of her books as free ebooks here or buy them from charity shops. There is always a wide selection of her books being sold cheaply in charity shops due to their popularity. I was lucky enough to have purchased almost a complete collection of her Agatha Christie Crime Collection series at a charity shop.\n\nHer An Autobiography is the best autobiography I’ve read written by an author and well worth reading once you’ve read some of her novels.\n\nDashiell Hammett (1929)\n\nRed Harvest (1929) – hard-boiled detective\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1929) – hard-boiled detective\n\nDashiell Hammett was an American author of hard-boiled detective novels and is widely considered one of the finest mystery writers of all time.\n\nIn hard-boiled detective novels, the typical protagonist is a detective who battles the violence of organized crime while dealing with a legal system that has become as corrupt as organized crime itself.\n\nI’ve read all of Dashiell Hammett’s novels. My favorite is the “Maltese Falcon”.\n\nYou can borrow his novels from the Internet Archive or download his ebooks for free here. It’s fairly common to see his novels in charity shops.\n\nCHD Kitchin (1929)\n\nDeath of My Aunt (1929) – The Golden Age\n\nCHD Kitchin was a British novelist best known for his four detective stories featuring amateur sleuth Malcolm Warren, a stockbroker.\n\nDeath of My Aunt was his first Malcolm Warren novel. The story is based around Malcolm Warren, a conservative stockbroker, solving the mystery of his aunt’s murder before he becomes the prime suspect after being tricked into delivering a fatal dose of poison to his wealthy aunt.\n\nDorothy L Sayers (1930)\n\nDocuments in the Case (1930) – The Golden Age\n\nThe Nine Tailors (1934) – The Golden Age\n\n“Documents in The Case” was written by Dorothy L Sayers and Robert Eustace. It is her only novel that doesn’t include Lord Wimsey, her most famous detective character. I would start by reading her Lord Wimsey novels before reading “Documents in The Case” as it isn’t like her other books and is very different from how most novels are written. It is an epistolary novel where the novel is written as a series of letters. This is the same style of writing used in Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1987). Robert Eustace was an English doctor and writer who often collaborated with other writers. He supplied the main plot idea and supporting medical and scientific details for “Documents in The Case”. I’m not sure if I would have included “Documents in The Case” in a list of “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books”. It wasn’t as well-written an epistolary novel as Dracula or as good as other crime and mystery books that weren’t included in the list.\n\n‘Gaudy Night’ was the first Dorothy L Sayers novel I read and I read this book first as it was her highest-ranked novel on my Top 100+ Crime and Mystery novel list challenge but is the tenth novel in her Lord Wimsey series. I would have appreciated ‘Gaudy Night’ if had read her novels in order of the Lord Wimsey series.\n\nI recommend starting with ‘Whose Body?’ first as an introduction to the Lord Wimsey characters and then reading “The Nine Tailors” if you don’t want to read all the books in the series.\n\nHere’s the complete list of her detective novels:\n\nWhose Body? (1923)\n\nClouds of Witness (1926)\n\nUnnatural Death (1927)\n\nThe Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club (1928)\n\nStrong Poison (1930)\n\nThe Documents in the Case (1930) – stand-alone\n\nThe Five Red Herrings (1931)\n\nHave His Carcase (1932)\n\nMurder Must Advertise (1933)\n\nThe Nine Tailors (1934)\n\nGaudy Night (1935)\n\nBusman’s Honeymoon: A Love Story With Detective Interruptions (1937)\n\n‘Whose Body?’ can be downloaded as a free ebook. Some of her books can be borrowed from the Internet Archive or downloaded as ebooks here. Most of her books I sourced from libraries or brought from second-hand shops/charity shops. I’ve read and enjoyed all her novels.\n\nArthur W Upfield (1931)\n\nThe Sands of Windee (1931) – The Golden Age\n\nArthur Upfield was an English Australian writer best known for his detective fiction featuring Detective Inspector Napoleon “Bony” Bonaparte of the Queensland Police Force, a mixed-race Indigenous Australian.\n\n“The Sands of Windee” was his second book in the Detective Inspector Napoleon “Bony” Bonaparte series and was a a story about a “perfect murder”, where Upfield invented a method to destroy carefully all evidence of the crime.\n\nAs an Australian I really enjoyed reading “The Sands of Windee” as I could relate to the Australian characters and story. It was also interesting to learn that the murder plot used for the book was used in a murder before the book was published. Upfield had been having trouble with the plot of planning the perfect murder and had discussed ideas with other people. “Snowy” Rowles, an itinerant stockman, was at one of the discussions and committed a series of three murders known as the Murchison Murders using the murder methods they had discussed which he described a foolproof way to dispose of a body and thus commit the perfect murder which Upfield published in his The Sands of Windee novel.\n\nFrances Iles (1929)\n\nBefore the fact (1932) Frances Iles – Psychological suspense\n\nAnthony Berkeley Cox was an English crime writer who wrote under several pen names, including Francis Iles, Anthony Berkeley, and A. Monmouth Platts.\n\nHis book “Malice Aforethought” was on The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time created by the British-based Crime Writers Association and I loved Lesley Grant-Adamson’s comment in her Psychological suspense chapter in Hatchards Crime Companion where she says I don’t like “Malice Aforethought”. “Malice Aforethought” had 30% more votes than any of the rest in the British Crime Writers ‘Psychological suspense category’ and I also wouldn’t clarify this as his best novel. The novel was unique for its time and is credited as being the first book to tell the reader from the onset what happened and then spent the remainder of the book sharing details of how it happened. “Before the Fact” was selected by H.R.F Keating for his “The 100 Best Crime & Mystery books”. I enjoyed reading “Before the Fact” more than “Malice Aforethought”.\n\nYou can borrow a few of his novels from the Internet Archive. The books I’ve read have been sourced from second-hand bookshops or charity shops.\n\nErle Stanley Gardner (1933)\n\nThe Case of the Sulky Girl (1933) – Legal\n\nErle Stanley Gardner, a former lawyer and prolific American author, is best known for his Perry Mason legal detective series. He published 87 books in his Perry Mason series and “The Case of the Sulky Girl” is his second book in the series. His approach to each story follows a similar format, a very formula fiction approach, with a different plot to solve.\n\n“The Case of the Sulky Girl” is a fast enjoyable read.\n\nJames M Cain (1934)\n\nThe Postman Always Rings Twice (1934) – criminal\n\nJames M Cain was an American author most commonly associated with hardboiled American crime fiction. Both of these novels are typical of his writing style that show the crime and its consequences from the point of view of the criminal.\n\n“The Postman Always Rings Twice” was his first novel and is considered one of the more important crime novels of the 20th Century. Its title is a red herring as a postman doesn’t appear in the novel or is alluded to. The saying refers to “The postman used to ring twice if there was something that needed an answer or signing for.” The story is narrated by a drifter who ends up working in a diner and conspires with the beautiful young wife, the operator of the dinner, to kill her older husband.\n\nThis novel was made into films and can be borrowed from the Internet Archive.\n\nJohn Dickson Carr (1933)\n\nThree Coffins (USA) The Hollow Man (UK) (1935)– The Golden Age\n\nJohn Dickson Carr is an American author who lived for years in England and most of his novels have English settings with English characters. He is considered one of the greater “Golden age mystery” writers with plot-driven stories with complex puzzles. He was considered the master of the locked room mystery where a detective solves an apparently impossible crime.\n\n“Three Coffins” published as “The Hollow Man” in the UK is a classic example of his locked room mystery. The story revolves around how Gideon Fell solves two murders to explain how Professor Charles Grimaud received his visitor in his study and when a gunshot is heard from the study, the alarm is raised – the door is broken down and Grimaud is found, shot dead, and alone. While just as nobody could have left that room, nobody could have murdered Pierre Fley in Cagliostro Street, shot at close range in front of witnesses but with nobody in sight and again, surrounded by undisturbed snow.\n\n“Three Coffins” published as “The Hollow Man” in the UK is part of his Dr Gideon Fell series so I started by reading his earlier Fell novels before reading this one:\n\nHag’s Nook – 1933\n\nThe Mad Hatter Mystery – 1933\n\nThe Eight of Swords – 1934\n\nThe Blind Barber – 1934\n\nDeath-Watch – 1935\n\nThe Hollow Man – 1935 (US title: The Three Coffins)\n\nMany of his novels can be borrowed from the Internet Archive. It’s fairly common to see his novels in charity shops. I borrowed “The Devil in Velvet” from a local library. He also published under the pseudonyms Carter Dickson, Carr Dickson, and Roger Fairbairn.\n\nRex Stout (1935)\n\nThe League of Frightened Men (1935) – Detective\n\nRex Stout was an American author best known for his detective stories based on Nero Wolfe and his assistant Archie Goodwin. He published over 40 novels based on Nero Wolfe and “The League of Frightened Men” is his second in the series which was originally published as “The Frightened Men” in six issues in the “Saturday Evening Post”.\n\nFast paced enjoyable novel!\n\nEthel Lina White (1936)\n\nThe Wheel Spins (1936) – The Golden Age\n\nEthel Lina White was a British crime writer best known for “The Wheel Spins” which Alfred Hitchcock based his “The Lady Vanishes” movie on.\n\n“The Wheel Spins” is based on protagonist Iris Carr a beautiful, young socialite on her way back home to England after vacationing in the mountains of central Europe travelling alone on a train through Europe. She befriends Miss Froy, who disappears without a trace. No one on the train believes that Miss Foy is missing in fact they don’t believe she even exists.\n\nFast moving enjoyable story.\n\nNicholas Blake (1938)\n\nThe Beast Must Die (1938) – The Golden Age\n\nThe Private Wound (1968) – Whodunnit\n\nNicholas Blake is the pseudonym of Cecil Day-Lewis, the famous poet.\n\n“The Beast Must Die” is a clever novel about a mystery novelist investigating who was responsible for the hit-and-run accident that killed his son. Packed full of twists and turns – very engaging and fast-moving.\n\n“The Private Wound” is very different from the “The Beast Must Die”. Set in the summer of 1939 and it tells the story of an English writer, Dominic Eyre, who, while staying in a small village in the West of Ireland, gets entangled in a love affair with the wife of a former IRA commander. The wife, Harriet Leeson, known as Harry ends up being murdered and Dominic becomes involved with trying to solve the crime to clear his name. Well written mystery novel.\n\nCornell Woolrich (1940)\n\nThe Bride Wore Black (1940) – Thriller\n\nCornell Woolrich was an American author who originally published “The Bride Wore Black” under the pseudonym William Irish.\n\nThe novel is based on a bride whose husband was killed by a shot as they were leaving the church.

She was primarily known for her Inspector Roderick Alleyn, a gentleman detective who works for the Metropolitan Police in London and was considered as a queen of crime along with Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Margery Allingham.\n\n“Surfeit of Lampreys” published as “Death of a Peer” in USA, was the tenth novel in the Roderick Alleyn series. The plot is about solving who murders an English peer and the title “Surfeit of Lampreys” is a reference to the abundance of Lamprey relatives who were present at the time of the murder and who made solving the crime complicated.\n\nI’m wondering if I had read the Inspector Roderick Alleyn novels in order if I would have enjoyed it more?\n\nRaymond Chandler (1942, 1953)\n\nThe High Window (1942) – Hard-boiled/Private Eye\n\nThe Long Goodbye (1953) – Hard-boiled/Private Eye\n\nI’ve read all of Raymond Chandler’s novels. “The Big Sleep” was the first hard-boiled/Private Eye novel I read and it is an absolute classic. His ability to describe and set scenes, and create the imaginary, in this novel is incredible. The ending frustrated me as someone more used to Golden Age novels. Hard-boiled incorporates the tone of realism and is more cynical, and hard-edged. Golden Age Crime fiction is based on a puzzle plot detective storyline with elements of whodunnit and fair play.\n\nHe originally published stories in the pulp magazine Black Mask and most of his novels were written by cannibalizing these short stories into his novels. The plot was less important to him than the atmosphere and the characters. When he merged the short stories together he spent most of the time on the descriptions of people and places and less time on the plot – which is why there can be gaps in his plots.\n\n“The Long Goodbye” is one of his last novels and the hardest to read. Some reviewers consider this his best novel and others consider it the worst. My mum’s comment on reading it was it should have been called “The Painful Goodbye”. She didn’t like it whereas I enjoyed it more because of the insight into the author. It is longer than his other novels and dragged on.\n\nYou can borrow his novels from the Open Library or download his ebooks for free here.

Appleby’s End is the tenth novel in his Appleby’s series.\n\nSome of Michael Innes’s novels can be borrowed from the Internet Archive. It’s fairly common to see his novels in charity shops.\n\nEdmund Crispen (1946)\n\nThe Moving Toyshop (1946) – Whodunnit\n\nI’ve read most of Edmund Crispin’s novels. I find his novels less enjoyable compared to other Golden Age crime writers as characters and plot development aren’t as good.\n\nYou can borrow this novel from the Open Library .\n\nElizabeth Ferrars (1946)\n\nMurder Among Friends (1946) – Whodunnit\n\nElizabeth Ferrars was a British crime writer. “Murder Among Friends” is an exploration of love, friendship, betrayal set in London during World War II.\n\nHelen Eustis (1946)\n\nThe Horizontal Man (1946) – Whodunnit\n\nHelen Eustis was an American writer who only published two novels. “The Horizontal Man” was her first novel, and only crime novel, won Mystery Writers of America’s Edgar Award for Best First Novel in 1946.

It is both a coming-of-age story and a murder mystery set in the underbelly of Chicago, navigating a world of seedy bars, gambling dens, and suspicious characters.\n\nMargery Allingham (1948)\n\nMore Work for The Undertaker (1948) – Golden Age\n\nTiger in the Smoke (1952) – Golden Age\n\nMargery Allingham is another of the well-known English novelists from the “Golden Age of Detective Fiction. I’ve read 16 of her novels.\n\n“More Work for the Undertaker” and “Tiger in the Smoke” are part of her Albert Campion novel series so if you wanted to read in the order published you would read:\n\nThe Crime at Black Dudley (1929: US title The Black Dudley Murder)\n\nMystery Mile (1930)\n\nLook to the Lady (1931: US title The Gyrth Chalice Mystery)\n\nPolice at the Funeral (1931)\n\nSweet Danger (1933: US title Kingdom of Death/The Fear Sign)\n\nDeath of a Ghost (1934)\n\nFlowers for the Judge (1936: US title Legacy in Blood)\n\nDancers in Mourning (1937: US title Who Killed Chloe?)\n\nMr. Campion: Criminologist (1937: short stories)\n\nThe Case of the Late Pig (1937: originally appeared in Mr Campion: Criminologist)\n\nThe Fashion in Shrouds (1938)\n\nMr. Campion and Others (1939: short stories)\n\nTraitor’s Purse (1941: US title The Sabotage Murder Mystery)\n\nCoroner’s Pidgin (1945: US title Pearls Before Swine)\n\nThe Casebook of Mr Campion (1947: short stories)\n\nMore Work for the Undertaker (1948)\n\nThe Tiger in the Smoke (1952: serialised in US newspapers as Tiger Loose)\n\nFrequently see her books in charity shops and second-hand bookshops. You can borrow her novel from the Open Library .\n\nJosephine Tey (1948)\n\nThe Franchise Affair (1948) – Whodunnit\n\nThe Daughter of Time (1951) – History Mystery\n\nJosephine Tey was a pseudonym used by Elizabeth MacKintosh, a Scottish author. She also wrote plays under the name of Gordon Daviot.\n\nI’ve read all Josephine Tey’s novels and this is another example of where I should have read her novels in order of the series rather than reading what was considered her best novel first.\n\nThe first novel of hers that I read was “The Daughter of Time” which I am sure I would have appreciated more if I had read the earlier novels first. I encourage anyone who reads this novel to research the background behind the story and the influence this novel had. The story is entirely based on the detective stuck in a hospital bed researching the mystery of Richard III.\n\nIncredible author and I enjoyed reading the biography of her life.\n\nI often see her books in charity shops and you can download her ebooks for free here.\n\nJohn Frankin Bardin (1948)\n\nDevil Take the Blue-Tail Fly (1948) – Psychological suspense\n\nJohn Franklin Bardin was an American crime writer. “Devil Take the Blue-Tail Fly” dives into the psychological torment of Ellen, a talented harpsichordist released from a mental institution. Returning to her seemingly perfect life with her conductor husband Basil, a dark secret from her past resurfaces.\n\nEllen encounters Jimmy Shad, a folk singer she had a passionate but destructive affair with during her youth.

Maigret is a methodical detective who relies on observation, intuition, and understanding human psychology to solve crimes. The stories typically focus on character development and revealing the motivations behind the crime, rather than intricate puzzles or action sequences.\n\nStandalone Novels (Romans Durs) – These are independent stories outside the Maigret series. They often fall under the umbrella of psychological crime fiction or hardboiled detective fiction. The “hardboiled” elements can include gritty settings, morally ambiguous characters, and a focus on the underbelly of society. However, Simenon goes beyond the typical hardboiled trope by adding a deeper psychological exploration of his characters and their motivations. These novels delve into themes of social alienation, mental illness, and the destructive power of the past.\n\n“My Friend Maigret” and “Maigret in Court” are part of his Inspector Maigret series while “Stain on The Snow” is one of his standalone novels.\n\nWR Burnett (1949)\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle (1949) – Criminal\n\nBurnett was a prolific American author known for his contributions to crime fiction and noir literature.

His works are characterized by their strong narratives, vivid characters, and sharp dialogue. He is perhaps best known for writing “Little Caesar” (1929), a seminal work in the genre that explores the rise and fall of a mobster named Rico.\n\n“The Asphalt Jungle” (1949) was adapted into a classic film directed by John Huston. His stories typically delve into themes of greed, betrayal, and the consequences of criminal behavior, portraying a world where moral ambiguity reigns and characters must navigate complex ethical dilemmas.\n\nMichael Gilbert (1950)\n\nSmallbone Deceased (1950) – Whodunnit\n\nUnable to find a paperback version I read it via Amazon Unlimited. A very enjoyable murder mystery set in a lawyer’s office that kept you guessing.\n\nHillary Waugh (1952)\n\nLast Seen Wearing (1952) – Police Procedural\n\nLast Seen Wearing is generally considered the finest early example of the police procedural.

As their relationship develops, Bill finds himself drawn into a world of espionage and betrayal.\n\nSet against the backdrop of post-World War II Europe, the novel explores themes of identity, trust, and the consequences of one’s actions. Bill’s journey takes him through various European cities, each represented metaphorically as “roundabouts,” where he navigates through twists and turns of both physical and emotional landscapes.\n\nBingham’s narrative is known for its atmospheric prose, complex characters, and suspenseful plot twists. “Five Roundabouts to Heaven” is regarded as a compelling example of Cold War-era spy fiction, blending elements of thriller and psychological drama to create a gripping story of intrigue and moral dilemmas.\n\nShelley Smith (1954)\n\nThe Party at No. 5 (1954) – psychological thriller\n\nShelley Smith was a British crime and mystery writer.\n\n“The Party at No. 5” story revolves around a group of people attending a party at a house numbered 5, where tensions and secrets among the guests quickly escalate into a deadly confrontation.\n\nThe novel unfolds as various characters with their own motives and hidden agendas navigate through the evening.

Margaret Millar published under her married name. Her husband Kenneth Millar was also a crime novelist better known under the pen name Ross MacDonald.\n\n“Beast in View” was enjoyable fast-reading novel that I completed within a day. I found a copy in a second-hand book shop and it can be borrowed as a free ebook from Open Library.\n\nPatricia Highsmith (1950)\n\nThe Talented Mr Ripley (1955) – Psychological suspense\n\nThe Tremor of Forgery (1969) – Psychological suspense\n\nPatricia Highsmith was an American novelist widely known for her psychological thrillers. Many of her novels have been made into popular movies but I’m not a fan of her obsessive, disturbing characters in her novels I’ve read so far.\n\nShe is considered the queen of the modern psychological thriller; her focus is more on the investigation of the human mind rather than the crime puzzle. What is interesting is Patricia Highsmith’s novels were more popular in Europe than in USA. This trend was highlighted in the two crime lists with her novels ranking higher on the UK list vs the USA crime writers list.\n\nFrequently see her books in charity shops and second-hand bookshops. You can borrow her novel from the Open Library.\n\nJ.J. Marric (1955)\n\nGideon’s Day (1955) – Police Procedural\n\nGideon’s Week (1956) – Police Procedural\n\nI read “Gideon’s Day” on my Top 100+ Crime and Mystery novel list challenge. Written under the pseudonym J.J Marric by John Creasy, the Gideon series is considered his best-known. “Gideon’s Day” is a police procedural based on telling the story of the main character Gideon with a glimpse into his personal life while juggling overseeing a series of different crimes.

Their novels are an example of nordic noir, a genre of crime fiction usually written from a police point of view and set in Scandinavia or Nordic countries.\n\nThey wrote 10 novels in the Martin Beck series and Per Wahloo died just before the last book in the series was published:\n\nRoseanna (1965)\n\nThe Man Who Went Up in Smoke (1966)\n\nThe Man on the Balcony (1967)\n\nThe Laughing Policeman (1968)\n\nThe Fire Engine That Disappeared (1969)\n\nMurder at the Savoy (1970)\n\nThe Abominable Man (1972)\n\nThe Locked Room (1973)\n\nCop Killer (1975)\n\nThe Terrorists (1976)\n\n“The Laughing Policeman” won the Edgar Award in 1971 for Best Mystery Novel.\n\nI occasionally see their books in charity shops and second-hand bookshops.\n\nHelen McCoy (1968)\n\nMr. Splitfoot\n\nPeter Dickinson (1968)\n\nThe Glass-Sided Ants’ Nest (1968) – The Whodunnit\n\nThe Poison Oracle (1974)\n\nPeter Dickinson was an English author and The Glass-Sided Ants’ Nest was his first novel in the Jimmy Peddle detective series.\n\n“The Glass-Sided Ants’ Nest” introduces Superintendent Jimmy Pibble who is called in to investigate the murder of tribal leader of a group of indigenous people who have lived in England after migrating with the daughter of an English missionary who had lived with the tribe in Papua New Guinea. The leader of the tribe decided to migrate after members of the tribe and the missionary were murdered by the Japanese during World War II.\n\nThe title “The Glass-Sided Ants’ Nest” is in reference to the fact that the daughter becomes an anthropologist and lives with the tribe where she is able to observe them living an adapted life while maintaining their customs like you might ants in a glass-sided ants’ nest.\n\nStory line was bizarre.\n\nChester Himes (1969)\n\nBlind Man With a Pistol (1969) – Police Procedural\n\nChester Himes was an American author best known for his Harlem Detective novels featuring Coffin Ed Johnson and Gravedigger Jones.\n\n“Blind Man with a Pistol” was his eight novel and final novel in the series. The novel tells the story of one night and a day in Harlem, and includes several murders, riots and looting. None of the murders, or who is responsible for the riots is answered in the story because Chester Himes wasn’t really interested in solving the mysteries. He is making a sociological and philosophical on white and black worlds. His goal is to make the point that most violence is like a blind man shooting a pistol, without aim, without strategy, without a point.\n\nI listened to this book on Audible. You need to accept when reading it that is isn’t a typical crime novel; the storyline is chaotic and it’s was his way of making a statement about violence, crime and what life was like for those living in Harlem in the late 60’s.\n\nJoan Flemming (1970)\n\nYoung Man, I Think You’re Dying\n\nEd McBain (1956)\n\nSadie When She Died (1972) – Police Procedural\n\nEd McBain was considered the author who perfected the police procedural sub-genre – where the crime is solved by an entire police department as opposed to a single detective.\n\nCop Hater was his first novel in the 87th Precinct series. I read numerous Ed McBain novels when I was younger. Cop Hater didn’t engage me until almost the end of the novel; maybe the ones I read in my younger years had evolved more or my tastes changed?\n\nFrequently see his books in charity shops and second-hand bookshops.\n\nGeorge V Higgins (1970)\n\nThe Friends of Eddie Coyle (1970) – Criminal\n\nGeorge V Higgins was an American author and lawyer best known for his crime novels that established the Boston noir genre of gangster tales.\n\n“The Friends of Eddie Coyle” was his debut novel published when he as an Assistant United States Attorney in Boston.\n\nThink I might have brought the ebook from Amazon after being unsuccessful in finding a physical copy of the novel.\n\nTony Hillerman (1973)\n\nDance Hall of the Dead (1972) – Police Procedural\n\nTony Hillerman was an American author best known for his detective series featuring Navajo Tribal Police Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee.\n\n“Dance Hall of the Dead” was his second novel and featured only Joe Leaphorn.\n\nThere was no ebook version of this novel and I think I brought it online as secondhand books.\n\nGregory Mcdonald (1974)\n\nFletch (1974) – Humorous\n\nGregory Mcdonald was an American mystery writer best known for his comic investigative reporter Irwin Maurice “Fletch” Fletcher.\n\n“Fletch” is a fast-moving enjoyable novel and was Edgar Awards winner for Best First Novel.\n\nThink I might have brought the ebook.\n\nCelia Fremlin (1975)\n\nThe Long\n\nColin Watson (1975)\n\nThe Naked Nuns\n\nP.D James (1971)\n\nBlack Tower– The Whodunnit\n\nA Taste of Death (1986) – The Whodunnit\n\nP.D James was an English novelist known for her detective novels featuring Adam Dalgliesh, a police commander, and poet.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, I read all the P.D James novels when I was younger.
