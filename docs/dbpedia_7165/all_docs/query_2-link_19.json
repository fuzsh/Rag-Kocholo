        "text": "Kollberg felt slightly sick at the thought of the task ahead of him. It was disagreeable at least. He had been forced into similar tasks before, but now, in the case of a child, the ordeal was worse than ever. If only Martin had been here, he thought; he’s much better at this sort of thing than I am. Then he remember how depressed Martin Beck had always seemed in situations like this, and followed up the train of thought: hah, it’s just as hard for everyone, whoever has to do it.\n\nThe apartment house where the dead girl had lived was obliquely opposite Vanadis Park, in the block between Surbrunnsgatan and Frejgatan. The elevator was out of order and he had to walk up the five flights. He stood still for a moment and got his breath before ringing the doorbell.\n\nThe woman opened the door almost at once. She was dressed in a brown cotton housecoat and sandals. Her fair hair was tousled, as if she had been pushing her fingers through it over and over again. When she saw Kollberg her face fell with disappointment, then her expression hovered between hope and fear.\n\nKollberg showed his identity card and she gave him a desperate, inquiring look.\n\n“May I come in?”\n\nThe woman opened the door wide and stepped back.\n\n“Haven’t you found her?” she said.\n\nKollberg walked in without answering. The apartment seemed to consist of two rooms. The outer one contained a bed, bookshelves, desk, TV set, chest of drawers and two armchairs, one on each side of a low teak table. The bed was made, presumably no one had slept in it that night. On the blue bedspread was a suitcase, open, and beside it lay piles of neatly folded clothes. A couple of newly ironed cotton dresses hung over the lid of the suitcase. The door of the inner room was open; Kollberg caught sight of a blue-painted bookshelf with books and toys. On top sat a white teddy bear.\n\n“Do you mind if we sit down?” Kollberg asked, and sat in one of the armchairs.\n\nThe woman remained standing and said:\n\n“What has happened? Have you found her?”\n\nKollberg saw the dread and panic in her eyes and tried to keep quite calm.\n\n“Yes” he said. “Please sit down, Mrs. Carlsson. Where is your husband?”\n\nShe sat in the armchair opposite Kollberg.\n\n“I have no husband. We’re divorced. Where’s Eva? What has happened?”\n\n“Mrs. Carlsson, I’m terribly sorry to tell you this. Your daughter is dead.”\n\nThe woman stared at him.\n\n“No,” she said. “No.”\n\nKollberg got up and went over to her.\n\n“Have you no one who can be with you? Your parents?”\n\nThe woman shook her head.\n\n“It’s not true,” she said.\n\nKollberg put his hand on her shoulder.\n\n“I’m terribly sorry, Mrs. Carlsson,” he said lamely.\n\n“But how? We were going to the country…”\n\n“We’re not sure yet,” Kollberg replied. “We think that she … that she’s been the victim of …”\n\n“Killed? Murdered?”\n\nKollberg nodded.\n\nThe woman shut her eyes and sat stiff and still. Then she opened her eyes and shook her head.\n\n“Not Eva,” she said. “It’s not Eva. You haven’t … you’ve made a mistake.”\n\n“No,” Kollberg said. “I can’t tell you how sorry I am, Mrs. Carlsson. Isn’t there anyone I can call up? Someone I can ask to come here? Your parents or someone?”\n\n“No, no, not them. I don’t want anyone here.”\n\n“Your ex-husband?”\n\n“He’s living in Malmö, I think.”\n\nHer face was ashen and her eyes were hollow. Kollberg saw that she had not yet grasped what had happened, that she had put up a mental barrier which would not allow the truth past it. He had seen the same reaction before and knew that when she could no longer resist, she would collapse.\n\n“Who is your doctor, Mrs. Carlsson?” Kollberg asked.\n\n“Doctor Ström. We were there on Wednesday. Eva had had a tummy ache for several days and we were going to the country I thought I’d better …”\n\nShe broke off and looked at the doorway into the other room.\n\n“Eva’s never sick as a rule. And she soon got over this tummy ache. The doctor thought it was a touch of the gastric influenza.”\n\nShe sat silent for a moment. Then she said, so softly that Kollberg could hardly catch the words:\n\n“She’s all right again now.”\n\nKollberg looked at her, feeling desperate and idiotic. He did not know what to say or do. She was sitting with her face turned towards the open door into her daughter’s room. He was trying frantically to think of something to say when she suddenly got up and called her daughter’s name in a loud, shrill voice. Then she ran into the other room. Kollberg followed her.\n\nThe room was bright and nicely furnished. In one corner stood a red-painted box full of toys and at the foot of the narrow bed was an old-fashioned dollhouse. A pile of schoolbooks lay on the desk.\n\nThe woman was sitting on the edge of the bed, her elbows propped on her knees and face buried in her hands. She rocked to and fro and Kollberg could not hear whether she was crying or not.\n\nHe looked at her for a moment, then went out into the hall where he had seen the telephone. An address book lay beside it and in it, sure enough, he found Doctor Ström’s number.\n\nThe doctor listened while Kollberg explained the situation and promised to come within five minutes.\n\nKollberg went back to the woman, who was sitting as he had left her. She was making no sound. He sat down beside her and waited. At first he wondered whether he dared touch her, but after a while he put his arm cautiously around her shoulders. She seemed unaware of his presence.\n\nThey sat like this until the silence was broken by the doctor’s ring at the door."
