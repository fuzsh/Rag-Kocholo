        "meta_description": "Some 1970s audiences in the UK might have known the name Ingmar Bergman, almost synonymous with the idea of a dark and twisted Swedish art film. But Bergman did not make films with many thrills or with much concern about contemporary politics. However, there is a direct link during the 1970s to the modern idea of Nordic Noir and it concerns a pair of Swedish writers who conceived a new kind of police hero in the 1960s, one who would become the character who did not just catch the bad guys but went about the job in a way that exposed political problems. And this character, a ‘revolutionary’ in terms of crime fiction, would not only survive and thrive in his contemporary world of crime fiction but would also act as a direct inspiration for many of the writers and filmmakers who produced works of Nordic Noir from 1990 onwards. This chapter explores the film adaptation of one of the novels featuring this ‘political detective’, Martin Beck.",
