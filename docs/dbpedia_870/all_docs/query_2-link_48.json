The company also intends to go public to expand its business. Currently, Joyalukkas has 100 showrooms in India and 60 outlets in ten countries. The investments will be funded through internal accruals and bank loans, and the showrooms will be company-owned.\n\nLeading jewellery firm Joyalukkas India Pvt Ltd plans to invest about Rs 2,400 crore in the next two financial years to open 30 new showrooms in India and ten outlets abroad, according to Chairman and Managing Director Joy Alukkas. The company is also preparing for an IPO (initial public offering) for further expansion of its business, he said.\n\nCurrently, Joyalukkas has 100 showrooms in India and 60 outlets in ten countries.\n\n\"We have plans to expand our operations both in India and abroad. We are targeting to open 30 new showrooms in India, while ten outside India in the next two financial years - 2024-25 and 2025-26,\" Joy Alukkas told PTI in an interview.\n\nAlukkas said the company will invest on an average about Rs 60 crore on each showroom. \"The total investment for opening 40 showrooms will be Rs 2,400 crore,\" he said.\n\nAround 30 showrooms will be opened mostly in north India, while ten of them in other countries including Canada and Australia.\n\nThe investments will be made from internal accruals and bank loans. The showrooms will be entirely owned by the company, he added.\n\nSharing about the IPO plans, Joy Alukkas said the company tried twice to go public in 2011 and 2022. The company could not bring an IPO in 2011 as the market was not favourable, while in 2022 there was a delay in the regulatory approval and the company's valuation by then had improved.\n\n\"We are internally preparing for an IPO. In the last three decades, the company has been operating like a family business. We are now trying to bring more transparency in the system as part of the IPO preparation process,\" he said.\n\nOn the company's quarterly performance, Joy Alukkas said the company expects more than 22 per cent jump in its net profit at Rs 1,100 crore in the current 2023-24 fiscal, as against Rs 900 crore a year ago.\n\nDuring the Q2 of this fiscal, the company posted a net profit of close to Rs 300 crore and a revenue of Rs 3,775.69 crore.\n\n\"Gold prices are down and we expect a 25-30 per cent increase in revenue during the third quarter of this fiscal,\" he added.\n\nThe Joyalukkas India generates much of its business from South India, especially Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nAfter a long stretch of slump, whatâ€™ll set the course for the hero of 100 cc bikes\n\n10 financial stocks that are trending in anticipation of rate cuts\n\nIndian investors are diverging from those in advanced markets.
