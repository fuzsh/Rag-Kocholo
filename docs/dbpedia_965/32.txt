Love You.. remember.. it was raining buckets, back when we first met..

.. and you, were crying so hard I could tell, even under that rain

Love You.. even those times when you find yourself seized with feelings of loneliness..

.. I, care about your each and every second

Because I understand the sad things that make you cry..

.. I want to stay by your side and shoulder all of your tears

I will protect you, from all the things that distress you

Even if that’ll be the extent of what I can do for you, I don’t mind

Even if not perfectly, but I’ll definitely make you feel happy

I swear it, no matter what happens, I will protect you

♫

Love You.. remember.. the first words I heard from you were “don’t cry”

Even though you said that to me, you were crying yourself

Love You.. even if you keep blaming yourself for not being good at laughing

.. I, love your each and every second

That time, when I went out into the storm to find you..

.. seeing you standing still under the downpour.. I just decided.. that I must protect you

I will protect you, from all the things that distress you

Even if others are gonna laugh at me, I don’t mind

Maybe I can’t do it perfectly, but you know, I’ll definitely make you smile

I swear it, no matter what happens, I will protect you

♫

Just as that shooting star is flowing.. and you’re casting your wish upon it..

.. I tone myself with you and wish, to be able to keep protecting you

When my life* comes to its end, I want you by my side..

.. and just at that last moment, this time I want you to watch over me

I will protect you, from all the things that distress you

Even if that’ll be the extent of what I can do for you, I don’t mind

Even though I can’t make miracles happen, to me, being with you is a miracle

I swear it, no matter what happens, I will protect you

♫

T/N: Once again I apologize to HF-san (who posted this request) and other readers for the hiatus that happened to me and the blog which lead to this belated post. Hope to see more requests from now on. Enjoy!

*: The Kanji lyrics use 生命 /sei mei/ which means ‘existence, life’ in a generic sense, but the vocalist says ‘inochi’ which is close in meaning but means ‘a person’s life’ precisely. There isn’t any hidden meaning there, and using synonymous words in the lyrics are quite common.
