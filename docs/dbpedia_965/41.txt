Romaji Lyric

Toki wa nagareteru dakara ima koko ni iru

Tokai no sora demo hora konna ni hoshi ga mabataku

Atarashii basho de ganbatteiru kara ne

Ano hi nagashita namida wa kono mune ni shimau kara

Shinpai kakenai you ni

Tsuyogaru toki mo aru kedo

Zenbu tsutawatteshimau

Tsunagatteiru yo doko ni ite mo

Onaji sora no shita de

Kimi no sono koe ga tsuyoku saseru

Hitori janai koyo wo tsutaete kureru

Watashi aruiteku yo

Itsumo soba ni iru kimi to hanareru koto ni

Fukuzatsu na kimochi, sou ano toki kanjiteta kedo

watashi no senaka kimi wa oshite kureta

Futari no kizuna shinjite mae dake wo mitsumete

Itsudemo kansha shiteru yo

Kimi ni moratta yuuki wo

Zenbu egao ni kaeru

Tsunagatteiru yo doko ni ite mo

Yasashii kimi no kotoba

Taisetsuna hito no asu ashita wo inoru

watashi mo kono basho de onaji KIMOCHI wo

Mochitsuzuketeru kara

Sayonara janakute futari

Hajimaridatta

Sorezore no kokoro ni

Ima made ijou omoiyaru jikan ga

Onaji sora no shita de

English Translation

Because time is flowing I’m here now

Even it’s a city sky but look the stars twinkled this much

Because I’ll do my best in a new place

I put away the shed tears at that day in my heart

To not make you worried

There’re the time that I pretend to be strong

All was conveyed

We wil be connected no matter where we are

Below the same sky

Your voice show the strenght

Tell me that I’m not alone

I’m walking down

Always be by my side, at the farewell with you

It’s comlplication feeling, I was feel it at that time but

You press my back

I believe our bond, See only the past

Always thanked to you

Bravery that I got from you

All change became smile

We wil be connected no matter where we are

Your gentle words

Praying for tommorrow of important person

Me too at this place, that same feeling

I continue to have it

It’s not a farewell, we

It has begun

In different heart

More than until now the Time of warmth

I feel it’s increase

We wil be connected no matter where we are

Below the same sky

Your voice show the streght

Tell me that I’m not alone

I’m walking down

We wil be connected no matter where we are

Your gentle words

Praying for tommorrow of important person

Me too at this place, that same feeling

I continue to have it

Irreplacable existence

“Sayonara mata….. . ”

English Translation

“Goodbye…”

But still I can’t forget the people who I love more than anyone

At the watch that remain stopped I step into new season

The winds that blow my lips was so cold, my heart was tightened

as much as time passed as much as I think it’s like a lie

Even I love you enough to cry, still it can’t reach you

“I want to be by your side…”

While I can’t said that simple words it’ll be end?

Even I feel you this near

I still love the pain of love, It’ll be hurt as much as it’s didn’t reach you

If my wish come true, please let us see our happy dream

Set up the things that I want, even I want to try to tell you a happiness

Without you I feel something isn’t complete, I just become vain

As much as I can remember you It’s hurt enough like my spirit go away

Because I will not cry, because I’ll be stronger please embrace me once again

“Goodbye…”

But still I can’t forget the people who I love more than anyone

The locked words seems overflowing

If there’s meaning of our meeting, I wonder the pain in this heart will be there too

If my wish come true, please realize this feeling that make this cheels wet

Even in the day with you I never lied

The important things will always spill over and fall?

“I want to be by your side…”

While I can’t said that simple words it’ll be end?

Even I feel you this near

I still love the pain of love, It’ll be hurt as much as it’s didn’t reach you

If my wish come true, please let us see our happy dream

English Translation

I hold my unringing phone with one hand

Think nothing but you

In such a fear night I can’t sleep

I feel the end will come soon

Even myself didn’t understand it, it’s not like me

Though it’s pain as much I chase for it

Hey why should be you?

If it’s not you it’ll be useless?

only me only me can you see only me?

can you love only me?

can’t reach you can reach you even you beside me

If I lenghten my hand it seems will be dissapear

Today I also wait at promised place

You forever didn’t appeared

It’s so you

But why I can’t hate you?

I don’t want to be drown in love that nothing but cry

even I understand I can’t stop it

hey what should I do

to be your number one?

Only me only me I want you to look only me

I want you to spoil only me

Right now right now I want to meet you right now

The only things that I can’t say is because I love you

thrust away that soft face

At the expected time being hurt again

I wonder It’ll be better If from the first I didn’t meet

The love that will not come true

Only you only you, My heart

will not satisfied if with someone else

However it may be however it may be I don’t want to lose you

Because I love you.. Because I love you..

only me only me can you see only me?

can you love only me?

can’t reach you can reach you even you beside me

If I lenghten my hand it seems will be dissapear

I want to believe

Because I just love you..

English Translation

falling in the corner

a sheet of dry leaves

slowly as possible

telling goodbye

we still holding each other

in our shoulder

we saw the future

someday until the day to meet you come

I will blow the wind

we go at different path, right?

love grow in the same branch

after losing it

noticing the important bonds

the sadness is alittle

change into memories

in my empty heart

it’s has bud it’s hope

the kind words are powerless

more than last kiss

understand each other

someday until the day to meet you come

I will know loneliness

searching for the sunshine

the season that have passed

definetely mor than now

for the sake of thinking of you

someday until the day to meet you come

I will blow the wind

we go at different path, right?

love grow in the same branch

after losing it

one more again

falling into spiral shape

the times of you and me

I won’t let it go from this hand

there’s no one doing wrong

the path that we choose

let’s believe our life

of living

was go away

the other side of moon (in calm ocean)

beautiful shadow (someone’s tears)

if it’s something important

you can see if you close your eyes

the other side of moon (in calm ocean)

even it hidden (feel the indication)

eventough if it’s a real lies

it’s certainly exist..

I was loved (memories of the past)

the pain in my heart

the two of us looked from here

the sky that change it’s color in selfish way

in unnoticed place in the stars

love also unmistakable

the time when

practiced in tenderness

another heart away

the common

warmth

was lost

the limit of

this reality

I can’t imagine it

we can see there

only the table

that was all

the other side of moon (in calm ocean)

even it hidden (feel the indication)

eventough if it’s a real lies

it’s certainly exist..

I was loved (memories of the past)

A cold night, It was painful

I was looked at your photo

even I wanted to tell it, I can’t

I can’t put it in words properly

I absolutely want to see you

If I walked at that street

an usual view like a starlight

I was searching for you

One day With courage

my feeling towards you

I wonder a day to tell it would come

now just a little

I need a time

because for me, a feeling like this

is my first love

start from tommorow, we go to

different way, but

in my heart, this feeling now

I’m just locked it

at this rate, one day

my heart seems to be broken

writting a letter, I’ll tell all

my feeling, I Love you

in the night when i want to see you, I be patient

today is the last excuse

when tommorow comes a night

beacause any answer

I can take it, I must be strong

my heart should be fine..

to not make a regret

I honestly tell the truth

the feeling that I hid, I don’t want to lose to anyone

now a feeling to love you

I was happy with only a miracle to meet you

my tears come out this much

just thinking of you

my heart become painful

First we met, from that moment

I just chasing afer you

thank you, from bottom of my heart

Someone tell me please named this feeling

looked up at starless, moonless and empty night sky, even I cheating at this overflowing feelings

the pain seems like want to burst in my heart

the times with you is the most gentle, but it’s the most painful moments too. So

I always tell lies to you

I don’t care about rumor but there is something come to break

anyone else? someone important? who the person that you love?

Someone tell me, please end this feeling

Always in my heart, If it’s love it’s too painful

I feeling more lonely when at the times that we spent together rather than be alone

even I understand it but we just already met

even I know its “unreachable wishes” I decided to not run away

I tell you lies again today

though we’re so close I can’t do nothing but looking at your back

but I can’t say it, I can’t separated from you, I want to embrace you

looked up at starless, moonless, and empty night sky, even I cheating on this overflowing feelings

the times with you is the most gentle, but it’s the most painful moments too. So

I always tell lies to you

English Translation

everytime you smiled, your face look so defenseless

I don’t think impossibly, flowing in my heart I love you

Not only to arrange common words

I want to continue to told you a Indubitable truth

go beyond the days..

In that eyes, our future has reflected

amazed by the words “I love you”

because I will always hold that words

a time when we see

a clean wind blows in the sky

the one who always thought you, I hope that person is definetely me

that spring night when we met, a love was born

everytime we touch each other it become a bonds

then came the morning…

If you lamented the day called today

I definetely come with calm face and sing for you

even in pain, even in sadness, believe in love

with outstretched hand, I definetely always want to grab you strongly

to pray, to cover up, to protect

While playing with happiness we take step together

I sing this love song

In that eyes, our future has reflected

amazed by the words “I love you”

because I will always hold that words

a time when we see

a clean wind blows in the sky

the one who always thought you, I hope that person is definetely me

If you lamented the day called today

I definetely come with calm face and sing for you

Let sing a love song

Romaji Lyric

Kimi e no omoi wo kogashiteku taiyou

Mune no takanari wo tomenaide itai no

Kanawanai koi to omoitakunai yo

Tatoe mirai ga mienakute mo

Manatsu no koi ga kogoeteru

Kimi no nukumori ni furetakute

Ato dore kurai nakeba ii no?

Tatta hitori kimi ni aisaretakute

Kimi no egao ga mabushi sugite

Marude natsu no taiyou mitai de

Motto hayaku ni deattetara

Hitorijime dekita no kana

Chakushin ki ni suru shisen ga setsunai

Ano ko ni naritai

Tada kokoro dake ga sakenderu

Manatsu no koi ga kogoeteru

Kimi no nukumori ni furetakute

Ato dore kurai nakeba ii no?

Tatta hitori kimi ni aisaretakute

Moshimo watashi ga ano ko dattara

Motto yasashiku dekiru no ni

Nani ga tari nai no?

Nani ga makete iru no?

Dare yori suki na no ni

Soudan aite ni sareru tabi ni

Harisake souna kokoro wo kaku shiteru

Kuchi wo kiku tabi kitai shiteru

Watashitte ZURUI no kana

Konnani chikaku ni iru no ni

todokanai, ano ko ni narenai

Tada kokoro dake ga kowareteku

Manatsu no koi ga kogoeteru

Kimi no nukumori ni furetakute

Ato dore kurai nakeba ii no?

Tatta hitori kimi ni aisaretakute

Moshimo watashi ga ano ko dattara

Kitto wagamama iwanai no ni

Nani mo iranai no nani mo kowakunai no

Dare yori suki dakara

Kimi e no omoi wo kogashite iku taiyou

Mune no takanari wo tomenaide hoshii no

Kanawanai koi to omoitakunai yo

Itsuka mirai wo kaetai kara

Manatsu no koi ga kogoeteru

Kimi no yasashisa wo shiritakute

Ato sukoshi dake soba ni isasete

Tatta hitori watashi dake wo mite

Manatsu no koi ga kogoeteru

Kimi no nukumori ni furetakute

Ato dore kurai nakeba ii no?

Tatta hitori kimi ni aisaretakute

Moshimo watashi ga ano ko dattara zutto

Kimi dake mi teru no ni

Nani ga okotte mo nani ga jama wo shite mo

Dare yori suki dakara

English translation

my feeling towards you burned by the sun

I don’t want to stop my throbbing heart

I dont want to think this love didn’t come true

even if i can’t se future

midsummer love is freezing

I want you touch me by your warmth

how much longer should I cry

I just want to be the one who you love

Your smile is too bright

It’s like summer sun

If we met earlier

I wonder if I can make you mine

the feelings taht i got from your eyes are painful

I want to be that girl

My heart just shouting

midsummer love is freezing

I want you touch me by your warmth

how much longer should I cry

I just want to be the one who you love

If I were that girl

I could be more gentle though

What thing that not enough?

in what thing that i has been losing?

though I love you more than anyone

whenever I got advice

I hiding my achy breaky heart

i expecting everytime I hear complaints

I wonder if I’m unfair

even though we so close

my feeling didn’t reach you, I couldn’t be that girl

only my heart is broken

midsummer love is freezing

I want you touch me by your warmth

how much should I cry

I just want to be the one who you love

If I were that girl

I’m sure I wouldn’t saying selfish things

I don’t need anything I’m not afraid of anything

because I love you more than anyone

my feeling towards you burned by the sun

I don’t want to stop my throbbing heart

I dont want to feel this love didn’t come true

because someday I want to change my future

midsummer love is freezing

I want know your kindness

just a little more please let me be by your side

I just want to be the one who you see

midsummer love is freezing

I want you touch me by your warmth

how much should I cry

I just want to be the one who you love

If I were that girl

I’ll always see only you, though

even anything happened, even anything in the way

because i love you more than anyone
