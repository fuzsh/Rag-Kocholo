Take it easy It's gonna be alright / Have faith and trust what a person you are / In times when you feel lost believe yourself / Overcome all the enemies I am falling, I am fading, / I am drowning, Help me to breathe / I am hurting, I have lost it all / I am losing, Help me to breathe Never too long or harsh / Always beside you / that's all I wished for
