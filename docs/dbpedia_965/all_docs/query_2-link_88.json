        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nThere‚Äôs never much to report on oppa-dul‚Äôs days off. So why not have some fun? I‚Äôm up for fun when there‚Äôs nothing important to post^^ Especially, when I have free time on my hands. Besides, I always feel like there‚Äôs something to post about our dear boys! üòÄ\n\nRandom facts of SHINee!\n\nKey almost cried every time Onew scared him at the dorm. Onew will pat his shoulders from the back and Key will scream at least four times a day. (Poor Key xD)\n\nAll the members sleeptalk.\n\nTaemin and Onew would always practice together on the rooftop during trainee days.\n\nMinho is very cautious about what he says, that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt talk much. (But with people he‚Äôs close with he can talk a lot and very loud xD)\n\nMinho glares at the step if he trips. (What‚Äôs that going to do? xD)\n\nSHINee is the first Korean artist in Japan to have 200,000 attendees in their first Japan arena tour.\n\nWhen they are dieting, SHINee won‚Äôt eat after 7pm.\n\nOnew gave Taemin his first direct vocal lessons.\n\nAll of them love watermelon juice. (Sounds good!)\n\nOnew thinks that a true man shouldn‚Äôt lie.\n\nTaemin liked to climb everywhere when he was younger. His parents were so scared when he jumped down.\n\nIn Las Vegas, SHINee got thrown out of the casino because Jonghyun tried to fit himself into a machine and got stuck. (Wow! How could someone throw them out? üò¶ Silly Jonghyun xD)\n\nJonghyun is willing to accept the age gap up to 6 years.\n\nJonghyun admitted that once he threw his father‚Äôs handphone out of the house and told it to fly.\n\nBefore Minho debuted with SHINee, he was a model. (Yep, there‚Äôs even a little video of his fashion show on YouTube somewhere^^)\n\nOnce Minho got the lyrics wrong and he cried in the makeup room while Taemin accompanied him. (Awww! My two biases ‚ù§ )\n\nSHINee likes it when fans make GIFs about them.\n\nSHINee and MBLAQ are close friends, they used to live next door to each other.\n\nJonghyun said that if Taemin was a detective, he‚Äôll probably arrest an innocent person. (Hilarious!)\n\nThe members say that Taemin eats a lot but he never gets fat.\n\nTaemin only takes about 5 minutes to get dressed in the morning.\n\nJonghyun says that once he starts crying he can‚Äôt stop because he keeps thinking of other things that make him cry more.\n\nMinho and BoA once watched the World Cup together. (BoA!! ‚ù§ )\n\nTaemin once made Jonghyun eat a paper cup. (I won‚Äôt even ask why xD)\n\nOnce Key bought a snail back to the dorm during a rainy day. (-_-)\n\nOnew felt like a bad boy when they were filming Lucifer. (That cracked me up!)\n\nMinho thought that Taemin was older than him when they first met.\n\nWhen Jonghyun first brought his dog Roo into the dorm the first night, Roo pooped on Minho‚Äôs bed and Jonghyun felt bad about it. So he let Minho name the dog and out of anger Minho just said: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not that impressive, just call him Roo.‚Äù.\n\nTaemin used to carry a bag containing a lot of sweets around. All those sweets had a SHINee logo attached to the wrapper and he would give out the sweets whenever he saw noonas. (My sweet oppa!!^^)\n\nKey‚Äôs Daegu accent slips out whenever he gets excited about something.\n\nOnce, Minho‚Äôs school hired an American teacher for English classes and since none of the kids could speak in English, they just kept quiet. But Minho was excited and started putting together the few words that he knew in English like: ‚ÄúHey yo, whatcha been doing, I‚Äôm thinking about you baby.‚Äù and the teacher thought that he was having a mental breakdown so he sent him to the nurse‚Äôs office. (Wow! Minho must have been so embarrassed!)\n\nWhen Onew was younger, he went to a CD game shop just to play games for free. But at the end he bought the game because he felt bad about it. (He‚Äôs so sweet^^)\n\nTaemin‚Äôs dream when he was a child was to protect earth. (Cute üòÄ )\n\nWhen Key was younger he had a fight with a flight attendant because he wanted another piece of bread but they wouldn‚Äôt give it to him. (We all know how‚Ä¶Key‚Ä¶was during younger days‚Ä¶right?)\n\nTaemin got bullied in high school after SHINee‚Äôs debut. (He denied it but it was probably to avoid trouble. There were pics back then and the SHINee members would always walk him to school then, so he wouldn‚Äôt go alone. Later on, he transferred, though.)\n\nWhen Minho got bad grades in school, he would hide himself in the washing machine when he was little and when his mother opens the lid, she would freak out to see her son sitting in there.\n\nAll the members are Christian. (As in Roman Catholics)\n\nSo was it fun, Shawols? üòÄ\n\nRemember, if there‚Äôs ever anything you want to know or you have any requests‚Äìdon‚Äôt hesitate to let me know^^\n\n-T4L\n\n(Note: I‚Äôm getting all the titles song out there^^ But I wanted to put one of my top faves up now! This MV introduced me to SHINee and it was love at first üòÄ It will always be a special song for me ‚ù§ )\n\nEnglish:\n\nJonghyun: When I see myself during these times\n\nI feel that I really am young\n\nEven with you in front of me\n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do\n\nOnew: To the people who are in love\n\nPlease tell me how you started to love\n\nTaemin: Will the day I hold her hand ever come?\n\nJonghyun: Will the day I kiss her above her closed eyes also come?\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nKey: I brought up the courage\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nOnew: I want to talk to you for a moment\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nJonghyun: I may be rushing a bit\n\nAll: Who knows? We might\n\nTaemin: End up doing well\n\nMinho: Whether I should approach you\n\nOr wait a little longer\n\nJonghyun: With everyone saying different things\n\nMakes it much harder (Onew: You might not believe me)\n\nKey: She has higher standards than she seems\n\nOnew: This kind of thing is uncommon for me\n\nPlease believe what I say\n\nTaemin: Will the day I casually hold her come?\n\nOnew: I believe everything will turn out the way you think it will\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nJonghyun: I brought up the courage\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nKey: I want to talk to you for a moment\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nTaemin: I may be rushing a bit\n\nAll: Who knows? We might\n\nJonghyun: Oh yeah\n\nIt‚Äôs not my first time to be honest\n\nI‚Äôve loved and broken up before\n\nOnew: But it‚Äôs hard, please believe these words\n\nJonghyun: You are different\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nMinho: I‚Äôll bet my all this time\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nKey: Ooh yeah, baby baby baby girl\n\nAll: Hello, hello\n\nJonghyun: I don‚Äôt know how you feel right now\n\nAll: Who knows?

Two of us\n\nOnew: Might be destiny\n\nMinho: Hello, the times I spent by your side\n\nCan no more compare to any other happiness\n\nI can‚Äôt express myself to you\n\nMy heart wants all of you, never let you go\n\nIf this is love, I‚Äôll never let it go\n\nWho knows?
