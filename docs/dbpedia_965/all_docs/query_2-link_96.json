        "text": "English:\n\nEven my dried up voice doesn’t pay attention to it\n\nI’m just gazing at the stars like always\n\nIt seems like I wandered off somewhere far\n\nThe color of meteors fly through empty space\n\nI wavered in the interval between 1 and 0\n\nMy heart breaks and disappears\n\nI wish, I wish I could walk in this place\n\nI only want to tell you a single word\n\n“Goodnight”\n\nI throw a coin and decide the answer\n\nIf I close the curtains, let’s go to the infinite darkness\n\nI wavered in the interval between 1 and 0\n\nThe world fades and melts away\n\nAnd when I wake up again\n\nYou will be there, I will be there\n\nCan you remember even the words I left behind?\n\nI wish, I wish I could see your dream\n\nI only want to tell you a single word\n\n“Goodnight”\n\nEnglish:\n\nI give you my name\n\nI’m fine with just being here\n\nIt doesn’t matter if someone makes a fuss about it\n\nI give it to the very very small you\n\nThe voices of flowers, the smiles of trees\n\nThey are right beside you\n\nJust now, the world revolves\n\nEverything knows freedom\n\nYou don’t need to worry about\n\nLittle things\n\nI give you this voice of mine\n\nThis way, you can sing songs\n\nYou don’t need to pretend anymore\n\nI give it to you who cries all the time\n\nThe sound of sand, the rhythm of fire\n\nThey are right beside you\n\nJust now, the world changes\n\nEverything becomes the color of the rainbow\n\nYou don’t need to pay attention to\n\nBoring things\n\nStanding there is the me of the past\n\nI who felt insecure and had no self-confidence\n\nEven though you made me wear small clothes\n\nYou yourself couldn’t help but notice it\n\nTo the many people around me, I give much love\n\nThe transparent rain\n\nWashes away everything\n\nIf I have feelings that I want to convey\n\nI will surely…\n\nJust now, the world opens up\n\nI hear the heartbeat of the future\n\nIt’s fine to try and start from\n\nThe things before your eyes\n\nEnglish:\n\nIlluminated in the night, the moon’s smile\n\nIs so dark and stagnant that it seems sad\n\nIt concealed the you who I could see\n\nThrough the cracks of the show you put on\n\nShards of distant days flutter in my dream\n\nThey break like they are being fiddled with\n\nThe passing of time swallows everything\n\nWhen was it that I started desiring the future?\n\nI embrace the fragile illusion and let it fill my heart\n\nWhen I strain my ears to listen\n\nThe solitary fruit is steeped in silence\n\nTo mature is to rot away\n\nIn your palms that I grasped tightly\n\nOnly the red words that spilled out of your mouth\n\nWill smolder forever\n\nPalely, heavily, they dissolve in your sighs\n\nIlluminated by the stars, even my footprints\n\nAre so white and distorted that it’s painful\n\nYou continued to hide\n\nThe key to my closed heart\n\nEven now, do you still remember\n\nThe distant days we dreamed about?\n\nThe world stays vivid, unchanging\n\nNo matter how long it takes, I will believe in the future\n\nThe dream we drew in the sky blazes out\n\nIf I close my eyes\n\nYour gentle smile\n\nWarms up my frozen body\n\nI want to protect you, I want to feel you\n\nBut the hand that I stretch out\n\nSlips through you and grasps empty space\n\nPalely, fleetingly, the feathers scatter\n\nWhen was it that I started desiring the future?\n\nI embrace the fragile illusion and let it fill my heart\n\nI can’t stay by your side\n\nNo matter how long it takes, I will believe in the future\n\nThe dream we drew in the sky blazes out\n\nBeyond the strength\n\nYou are―\n\nSet this wish free\n\nThe blue bird flies into the light\n\nEntrusting its body to the wind\n\nThe final key rests on those wings\n\nAnd pierces through the clouds\n\nIt’s the sound of me living not in the past or the future\n\nBut “right now” that I feel when I raise my hand to my chest\n\nSimply by feeling it\n\nMy feelings bloom stronger and stronger\n\nI sing because there is no hesitation in my heart\n\nEnglish:\n\nWe walked side by side with your pace matching mine\n\nOur fingers that occasionally touched became very hot\n\nYour smile that is illuminated by the sunset is precious to me\n\nI want to stay with you forever in the dazzling light\n\nThese hands overflow with warm, gentle warmth\n\nAnd my tender love\n\nAlthough it will disappear someday\n\nI want us to continue protecting our flame together\n\nWhen the lukewarm wind stroked my cheeks\n\nThe large flower of light was still looking down on us\n\n“Although I had decided to convey my feelings today for sure…”\n\nWhen I suddenly see your face, my chest feels like it would burst\n\nThe happy times pass by quickly\n\nLook, I need to hurry up and take your hand and tell you\n\nBut my trembling lips hinder me\n\nIt’s frustrating, ah…\n\nYou who I love so much is close to me\n\nI don’t need anything more than this\n\nI’ve wished for it so many times\n\nPlease let time stop right here, for eternity…\n\nThese hands overflow with warm, gentle warmth\n\nAnd my tender love\n\nAlthough it will disappear someday\n\nI will protect our flame\n\nYou who I treasure so much is close to me\n\nI don’t need anything more than this\n\nI’ve vowed so many times\n\nI won’t let go of our joined hands, for eternity…\n\nEnglish:\n\nI’m sorry that I’m unable to be honest\n\nI wish I could say things like ‘I love you’\n\nThank you for giving birth to me\n\nI’m happy I was born as your child\n\nWhile you worked until late at night everyday\n\nYou brought me up by yourself until now\n\nNo matter how tired you were, you didn’t complain even once\n\nYou always continued to give me a smile\n\nWhen we fought over trivial things, I immediately ran out of the house\n\nBut I couldn’t forget your sad face\n\nWhen I opened the front door, the usual aroma of dinner\n\nGently enveloped me\n\nI’m sorry that I’m unable to be honest\n\nI wonder how much your voice saying “Welcome home” has saved me\n\nThank you for giving birth to me\n\nI’m happy I was born as your child\n\nBack when I was young, when I played around, fell down, and cried\n\nYour warm hand would stroke my head\n\nBefore I knew it, you had become smaller than me\n\nI wonder if I can be the one to protect you this time\n\nYou always supported me and encouraged me again and again\n\nI wonder just how much kindness I received from you\n\nThe first time I confided my dreams to you\n\nWithout saying anything, you supported me from behind\n\nI’m sorry that I’m unable to be honest\n\nI wish I could say things like ‘I love you’\n\nThank you for giving birth to me\n\nI’m happy I was born as your child\n\nThank you for being here for me\n\nBecause of that, I could be myself\n\nThank you for giving birth to me\n\nI want to express my gratitude to you right now\n\nI’m sorry that I’m unable to be honest\n\nI wish I could say things like ‘I love you’\n\nThank you for giving birth to me\n\nI’m happy I was born as your child\n\nI’m glad that I’m your daughter, thank you\n\nEnglish:\n\nIf I could fly in the sky, where should I go?\n\nAt that time, I could laugh when I dreamed about such things\n\nI reminisce nostalgically and quietly close my eyes\n\nThe white floor on the other side of the closed door\n\nThe shining scenery that slowly fades away\n\nMy completely dried up memories crack\n\nMy voice murmuring “Don’t disappear yet” resounds like\n\nan echo\n\nI want to confirm that I exist here\n\nCountless shards of dazzling days scatter\n\nI gather them with slender fingertips\n\nI try to piece them back together but the scars won’t disappear\n\nEven if I’m alone, I will gently smile\n\nMy shadow is still looking down slightly and swaying\n\nFrom a place where a transparent droplet fell\n\nLight dwells in even my completely dried up memories\n\nMy voice murmuring “I can still walk” resounds in the empty\n\nmorning\n\nI now stand up and open the door\n\nThe light shines blue and high\n\nLike it is pushing me from behind, the wind blows through\n\nCountless shards of dazzling days soar\n\nMy shattered memories overflow\n\nEven though they are full of patches, their vividness will not disappear\n\nIf I melt into the sky, if that day comes\n\nI will surely be smiling at the very end\n\nRomaji:\n\nWake up to an alarm in your head\n\nit’s the sound that you hear before the approaching catastrophe\n\nTick-tock, there’s not a moment to spare\n\neverybody counts down to the start of a history\n\nShow down play the cards in your hand\n\nring the bell you just won everything

anybody\n\nChanges into shouts of joy\n\nI won’t hesitate anymore, start\n\nEnglish:\n\nI want to become a flower\n\nAlways, no matter what time it is\n\nTo be a flower blooming close to you\n\nI want to become a flower\n\nWhen I put it into words\n\nThey seemed to be swept away in the wind\n\nI was always just\n\nLooking down\n\nIn this endless\n\nWide world\n\nYou somehow\n\nFound out about me\n\nI want to become a flower\n\nA flower that gently illuminates your heart\n\nWhen you are sad\n\nI want to become a flower\n\nWhen I open the window\n\nThe light is too bright\n\nThere are also painful days\n\nWhen I am looking up, but\n\nThis endless\n\nCourage continues on to someone\n\nEven if I am living exaggeratedly\n\nI think, “I’m glad”\n\nI want to become a flower\n\nA flower that gently adorns your scenery\n\nWhen you are happy\n\nI want to become a flower\n\nI want to become a flower\n\nIt’s fine if I don’t have a name\n\nWhen you are too lonely\n\nThink of me…\n\nI want to
