        "text": "We met where thousands of roads intersect\n\nThat day we played around, fooled around with each other\n\nThe morning of dreams that we talked away, with our footfalls light\n\nAnd unbending gazes, we looked ahead to the future\n\nIf we walk together regardless of what happens\n\nCourage of many more times will surge up\n\nAnd we can overcome anything; we are protected\n\nThe words we swore on the setting sun stained red\n\nIs being absorbed by the sepia moon\n\nThis passionate bond that stretches into the distance:\n\nI pray it continues forever\n\nIn the town unchanging from norm, the usual smiles\n\nResonating, coinciding with each other – this dear place\n\nThere were times we cried; during those times you\n\nJust quietly and softly stood by my side\n\nEven if time flows and our ways part\n\nI want you to keep protecting, without destroying\n\nKeep looking ahead, without turning back"
