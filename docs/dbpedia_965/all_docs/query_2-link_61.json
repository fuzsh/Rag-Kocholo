This is the only track in the rate that got multiple 11s. Produced by BACK-ON a.k.a. Hi-yunk's band, and written by them and Kumi, the track appeared on \"DNA\". It was also used as an opening theme for the anime \"Black Clover\", which made some people into new Kuu fans I'd imagine, since the feature turned the track into a digital hit. Currently it sits comfortably at the top of Kumi's most listened to songs on Spotify with whooping 9 million listens. Just imagine! It's 2 millions ahead of \"Ai-fucking-no-Uta\" of all songs. THE POWER!\n\nI do enjoy this quite a bit, especially since it's kinda different in comparison to all of her rock songs. It actually reminds me of \"No Man's Land\" a lot with those more talkative verses and more sing-along-y chorus, but other than that not much else. I'm pretty sure I dug the verses right from the first listen, but the chorus had to get to the \"lalala\" part for me to click. I also love how it starts just like a typical anime song and then it just says \"fuck it\" and does its own thing.\n\nI don't know what the anime is about, hence why I don't know what this song is about.​\n\nThe harmony I played with you is still\n\nleft behind in the past\n\nYour confident scent still\n\npulls on my heart\n\n\"We'll be together for all eternity\"\n\nThere's a trap hidden in those words\n\nThis world wanting a meaning isn't enough\n\nI'll add some color to it\n\n(c) @otenkiame\n\nThe lyrics in the verses are pretty though.\n\n@Cutlery (6) decides to sharpen the suspense by making very... long... pauses... between... words, \"I… kinda… like this… but I… kinda… can't stand this...\"\n\nLooks like @Yeziirl (7,5) has something against the anime openings, \"oh yeah I’ve guessed right, rock anime openings are back and I’m not really happy. Though it’s probably her most popular song off DNA album and doesn’t sound bad overall.\" Yeah, actually, when I think about this songs popularity I always go:\n\n​\n\n@otenkiame (8) spurs me up, \"Rock Kuu comes back with this aggressive and in-your-face number. Gotta say, for an anime track, it does well to not fall into your atypical anime rock sound. Kuu herself gives a great performance with a super catchy hook that I can attest was fun to hear live!\" And I didn't! Shush!\n\n@RUNAWAY (10) asks me how much I know him, \"such A MOMENT. You know how much I love Rock-Kuu, and this song is another fantastic addition to that part of her discography. Boom Boom Boys, Ningyo Hime, Can We Go Back, ahhhhhhh I love just thinking about it <3\" Do I know though? Always thought you more of a ballad lover, but then again, having seen your ballots for all for Parts of the rate you just love... Kumi. And I really appreciate it!\n\nAs for our precious 11s, first up is @Sprockrooster (11), \"WHEW! I was not ready. The absolute power this track has in it's roaring guitar and fantastic vocals. Sprocky-bait.\" I've said it several times over the course of the rate, still it deserves a repeat when I say I love how the chameleonic nature of Kumi's artistry lets everybody find something to their liking in her vast discography.\n\nLastly @Weslicious (11) lauds the track, \"Queen of coming back six months after her last album! I love this. Like LOVE. The attitude, the production, the call and response chorus... It all just works together to make her best rock song and arguably the best song in this batch. And it’s also always in her top songs on Spotify so Japan agrees with me. And if the country that gave us Ms. Koda Kumiko Kenji03 herself agrees with me, then I know I’m right.\" Let's not get overboard, when \"Selfish\" is right there, okay?​\n\nHaving this large of a tie-in this was bound to be performed live.\n\n​\n\nHow is Livin' La Vida Loca still here?\n\nBecause SLAYIN’ La Vida Loca is a bop.\n\nIs it though?\n\n40\n\nGOLDFINGER 2019 / Livin' La Vida Loca\n\nAverage: 7,93\n\nHighest scorers: 10x2 (@Sprockrooster, @RUNAWAY), 9,5x1 (@Yeziirl)\n\nLowest scorers: 5x1 (@mi|kshake), 6x2 (@Weslicious, @Remorque)\n\nMy score: 7,5​\n\nIt is, kinda. Produced by Desmond Child and written by him and Draco Rosa in its original form, the song was first sung by Ricky Martin in 1999. Only 4 months later the Japanese legend Go Hiromi released his version of the song in Japanese, retitled \"GOLDFINGER '99\". The Japanese lyrics were written by Kan Chinfa (BoA's \"Kimochi wa Tsutawaru\" and \"VALENTI\" !!!). In an unprecedented turn of events, Kumi recorded both versions of the song, because why the fuck not, right? This also marks the second song of Hiromi's Kuu has covered, with the first one being the ever lovely \"Ienai yo\", which was released on \"ETERNITY\" and also poorly rated in this very rate in Part III. There were actually rumors that Kuu might release a new cover album with a possible title of \"re(CODE)\" after she unceremoniously dumped this onto her YouTube channel, but looks like it was never meant to be. Both of Kumi takes appear on \"re(CORD)\", which is a bit of an overkill.\n\nIt's a nice enough rendition, really. She sounds great both in English and in Japanese and brings the necessary energy to the table. I mean, we all know the original song and it was quite a moment, and since Kumi doesn't change much about this, I guess it all boils down to our perception of the original. Kumi did bring in a kind of weird / kind of genius dance break into the song and... it's probably my favorite part of it? I didn't really get it the first time, still after the repeated listens I was only drawn to it more and more. It's magic, I'm telling you.​\n\nYou know the meaning of the Ricky's version, true, but the Hiromi's one is... interesting.\n\nOuch, so hot! Is it burning?\n\nNow, ouch, so hot! Did you feel it?\n\nOh, upside inside out, even if I make you cry\n\nOuch, so hot! That's what the sun\n\nmakes you do\n\nThe summer sun\n\n(c) @otenkiame\n\nOh wow.\n\nMy theory about the original proves true with @Weslicious (6), \"I never much liked the original. I mean, it’s an uptempo and catchy so I won’t be bombing it but I definitely don’t imagine we run the risk of a cover winning this part like we did Ayu's rate.\" I mean, \"Movin' on without you\" is just a better song.\n\n@otenkiame (8) doesn't mind this one even one single bit, \"This is an unexpectedly fun track. Everyone knows the original, but Kuu did wonderfully making this her own. The latin pop sound isn't as prominent, but I'm so glad she kept the horns. And, yes, I still like the weird trap dance bridge that has no business being in the song.\"\n\n@Cutlery (9) was awe-struck with Kumi's charisma in the video form, \"Either iteration of this is pretty much amazing. She ate that up! Especially in the video.\" The video was definitely fun.\n\nWho knows, maybe @Yeziirl's (9,5) suggestion isn't that far off, \"English one has better lyrics, so… not a fan of la vida loca, but I think it’s a very good cover with an amazing music video and it is definitely stuck in my head! Kumi I am eagerly waiting for Ricky Martin on your next random featuring!\" I mean, we had some unexpected collaboration in the past, nothing is off the table for Kuu, I guess.\n\n@RUNAWAY (10) is probably dancing in the sun to this or something at the moment, \"I absolutely love her GOLDFINGER cover and it’s a fucking bopperoo.\"\n\nAnd finally @Sprockrooster (10) adores this and thinks it's a fantastic cover, \"What a fantasic cover. I adore it.\"​\n\nThis was already a hit two decades ago all around the world and in two languages, so naturally Kuu milked this live like a savvy businesswoman that she is.\n\n​"
