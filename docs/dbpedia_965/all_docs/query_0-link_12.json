        "text": "Said I’d post this list a couple of months ago.\n\nThis year I constructed a playlist of a 1000 of my favourite songs by Japanese artists – they could be anything from songs that first brought me into Jpop (like the first 10 on the list), made me fall in love with an act or a genre or simply, songs where I abused the ‘repeat’ button.\n\nI referred to my Last.fm charts a lot which unfortunately only go back to 14 years so that’s missing a slice of my early Jpop-listening days from the late 90s to 2003 – had to trawl through my extensive archives and portable devices listening to older playlists and albums.\n\nAlmost 2/3rds of the list are 2000s tracks, with the 2004-06 period contributing 30% of the list overall. Figures, cos I was in university then and a hikikomori with too much time on my hands.\n\nNot a saint only buying physical CDs (through Yesasia & CDJapan), so I obviously have a large collection of downloaded music: Audiogalaxy, winMX, winNY, Share, Bunko/Public MM tracker, soulseek and Jpopsuki being the primary sources in the 2000s. Nowadays I just check Youtube and stream off Spotify, then buy on iTunes or Recochoku if something’s to my liking – physical CDs are a no-go for me now thanks to space limitations.\n\nOldest songs would be from the ’60s, stuff that I found through kayōkyoku compilations & such. There are newer tracks too: 5 songs from 2017, in fact. Anisong/doujin/eroge themes makes up a good percentage (around 40%) of the list though a chunk of that overlaps with jrock/jpop as more & more rock acts such as VELTPUNCH and Tokyo Karankoron have had songs used in animation over the last decade.\n\nI compiled the list by rough groups of 10 songs each with a loose ‘theme’ to them ie anisong rock, kayokyoku/folk faves, j-urban and so on and so forth. My favourite of these is probably the Kajiura Yuki vocal tracks list\n\nIt appears Tomatsu Haruka has the most tracks featured on the list both solo and as part of a unit (8). Not intentional at all.\n\nTwo of the songs here have nonsensical made-up lyrics: 100s’s Honeycom.ware & B-DASH’s Cho. One is in traditional Okinawan dialect (Warabigami)\n\nTracks with solo female vocals outnumber males by 588 to 367, with 30 duets, 14 instrumentals & 1 vocaloid. I blame the anisong for that high ratio of girls to guys…\n\nTo listen to every second of every song would take 3 days 2 hours 14 minutes and 34 seconds.\n\nI tried to link to Youtube wherever possible but there are some with Spotify links (you’ll need an account for that) & legal Recochoku/iTunes/Mora (samples) links.\n\n01. Ozaki Yutaka – I LOVE YOU (1983)\n\n02. Hosokawa Takashi – Kita Sakaba (1982)\n\n03. Southern All Stars – Manatsu no Kajitsu (1990)\n\n04. Inagaki Junichi – Christmas Carol no Koro ni wa (1992)\n\n05. Yamashita Tatsurō – Christmas Eve (1983)\n\n06. Takeuchi Mariya – Genki o dashite (1984)\n\n07. Madoka Hiroshi – Musōbana (1978)\n\n08. Arai Yumi – 12gatsu no Ame (1974)\n\n09. Murashita Kōzō – Hatsukoi (1983)\n\n10. Yoshida Takurō – Asu ni Mukatte Hashire (1976)\n\nWhen I began my sojourn into Japanese music, I was not impressed. It was mostly bubblegum pop (Johnny’s, Hello Project, Hamasaki Ayumi) of little substance and really, it wasn’t ’til I stumbled across Ozaki Yutaka via a random download through Audiogalaxy that I started to think that Jpop might have more to it. Around that period my mom would flick through random folk/enka shows on NHK as well, which was how I got into the classic hits. These 10 tracks represented some of my earliest favourites that I first heard in the late 90s.\n\n11. Utada Hikaru – Wait & See ~Risk~ (2001)\n\n12. m-flo loves melody. & Ryohei – miss you (2003)\n\n13. Tokyo Jihen – Sōnan (2004)\n\n14. sleepy.ab – Shiki Utakata (2006)\n\n15. Spitz – Robinson (1995)\n\n16. Yen Town Band – Swallowtail Butterfly -Ai no Uta- (1996)\n\n17. FREENOTE – Re:Channel (2004)\n\n18. Onitsuka Chihiro – Gekkō (2000)\n\n19. Chemistry – Pieces of a Dream (2001)\n\n20. HY – AM11:00 (2003)\n\nThese would be the 10 I’d say best reflect my overall taste in Japanese-language music – a mix of styles from urban to pop to rock and indie.\n\nThe defunct FREENOTE is probably the band here that is closest to my heart as I watched a bunch of their lives when I was still staying in Japan.\n\nObviously Utada Hikaru is my First (Jpop) Love [pun fully intended] and I think my local record shop was sick of me calling up on them all the time to find out whether her latest album had arrived.\n\nWill never forget how loud I squeed when I found Onitsuka Chihiro’s first album in a pokey corner of a CD store in some godforsaken mall in town. It really was so hard to get hold of original copies of Japanese music at the time… (for a high-school kid like me)\n\nI fell in love with Spitz after buying a triple-CD bootleg of their tunes out of desperation. I made sure to get their albums proper after Yesasia came into existence.\n\nIf you asked me to pick my #1 Japanese song of all time, push come to shove, I’d nominate Swallowtail Butterfly.\n\n21. Ōsawa Yoshiyuki – Soshite, Boku wa Tohō ni Kureru (1984)\n\n22. KAN – Ai wa Katsu (1990)\n\n23. Happy End – Kaze o Atsumete (1971)\n\n24. H20 – Omoide ga Ippai (1983)\n\n25. Nakamori Akina – Slow Motion (1982)\n\n26. Moritaka Chisato – Watarasebashi (1993)\n\n27. Kosaka Akiko – Anata (1973)\n\n28. Hibari Misora – Kawa no Nagareru Youni (1989)\n\n29. Ohashi Junko – Tasogare My Love (1978)\n\n30. Yamamoto Kotaro to Weekend – Misaki Meguri (1974)\n\nMore evergreen classic Jpop tracks, the type you see oft featured on cover albums. Have a soft spot for melancholic, minor-key power ballads like Ohashi Junko (sad to hear that she was diagnosed with early-stage esophageal cancer earlier this year, hope she recovers well) and Nakamori Akina’s songs here.\n\n31. JUDY AND MARY – Kaze ni Fukarete (1997)\n\n32. Misia – Everything (2000)\n\n33. Quruli – Bara no Hana (2001)\n\n34. THE BACK HORN – Sunny (2001)\n\n35. fra-foa – Light of sorrow (2002)\n\n36. Noanowa – Yume no Arika (2009)\n\n37. the pillows – That House (1998)\n\n38. ANATAKIKOU – Fushigi na Ito (2005)\n\n39. LOST IN TIME – Mada Furusato e wa Kaerenai (2006)\n\n40. Swinging Popsicle – I just wanna kiss you (2004)\n\nAnother 10 songs that I’d consider to be amongst my favouritest of all times. noanowa and LOST IN TIME are 2 acts I spent a lot of time pursuing live as well – Yume no Arika is just so explosive to watch in person.\n\n41. Sakai Masaaki – Saraba Koibito (1971)\n\n42. Kondo Masahiko – Yuyake no Uta (1989)\n\n43. Wada Akiko – Ano Kane o Narasu no wa Anata (1972)\n\n44. Bread & Butter – Ano Koro no mama (1979)\n\n45. Moriguchi Hiroko – Mizu no Hoshi e Ai o Komete (1985)\n\n46. Anzen Chitai – Suki sa (1986)\n\n47. Kubota Toshinobu – La La La Love Song (1996)\n\n48. Fukuyama Masaharu – Heart (1998)\n\n49. The Jacks – Tokei o Tomete (1968)\n\n50. Akai Tori – Tsubasa o Kudasai (1971)\n\nMore all-time favourites. The Jacks is the one that stands out most on this one ‘cos it’s JP psychedelic-rock at its finest (not that there was a lot of that being made in the first place).\n\n51. Every Little Thing – Time goes by (1998)\n\n52. Fumido – Nakimushi no Uta (2005)\n\n53. DEPAPEPE – Summer Parade (2005)\n\n54. Lost in Time – Anata wa Ikiteiru (2004)\n\n55. TRICERATOPS – Jewel (2004)\n\n56. dorlis – Mabataki (2005)\n\n57. Soutaiseiriron – Jigoku Sensei (2009)\n\n58. Shiina Ringo – Kabukichō no Joou (1998)\n\n59. Rin’ – Fuhen (2004)\n\n60. ELLEGARDEN – Missing (2004)\n\nIt’s funny to think now that I actually discovered certain acts through watching NHK’s weekly (dead) Pop Jam show – TRICERATOPS and acoustic instrumental duo DEPAPEPE being 2 examples. Pop Jam died in 2006 & was replaced by Music Japan which in turn died in 2016. I haven’t tuned into NHK for ages now so god knows what’s replaced that now.\n\nI discovered this Time Goes By (and other classics like Zard & YMO) through playing beat mania GB2 Gatcha Mix on the bloody Game Boy Color back in 2000. Somehow, I could still tell that it was a great tune despite being chiptuned beyond recognition.\n\n61. Porno Graffitti – Saboten (2000)\n\n62. EXILE – Your eyes only -Aimai na Boku no Katachi- (2001)\n\n63, Hitomi – IS IT YOU? (2001)\n\n64. Suga Shikao – 8gatsu no Serenade (2001)\n\n65. YOSHII LOVINSON – CALL ME (2005)\n\n66. SURFACE – Kimi no Koe de Kimi no Subete de… (1999)\n\n67. Hysteric Blue – Haru~spring~ (1999)\n\n68. Mr.Children – Tomorrow never knows (1994)\n\n69. Sakamoto Ryuichi – energy flow (1999)\n\n70. Hamasaki Ayumi – M (2000)\n\nAnother way I discovered Jpop hits at the turn of the century was through the MTV cable channel that would play the odd Jpop track here and there, and through watching dorama. EXILE and Hitomi’s tracks here were the themes from one of my fave doramas – Dekichatta Kekkon (Shotgun Wedding), headlined by Takenouchi Yutaka and Hirosue Ryoko\n\nHysteric Blue is one of those bands who used to be so big but whose legacy will forever be tarnished by an unsavoury scandal – in 2005, guitarist Akamatsu Naoki was jailed for 14 years, reduced to 12 upon appeal, for raping teenage girls. He’s due for release in October 2018.\n\n71. Onsoku Line – Nagareboshi Line (2005)\n\n72. Hirakawachi 1-chome – Hoshi kara Fuku Kaze (2004)\n\n73. school food punishment – 04:59 (2010)\n\n74. B’z – Konya Tsuki no Mieru Oka ni (2000)\n\n75. Hotaru Biyori – Ringo Ame (2010)\n\n76. CUNE – Refrain (2002)\n\n77. Okuda Tamio – E10 Rider (1996)\n\n78. ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION – Kimi to Iu Hana (2003)\n\n79. Tsubakiya Shijuso – Koharu Biyori (2004)\n\n80. Otsuka Ai – Daisukidayo. (2004)\n\nSupposedly a rock-themed list but for some reason, Otsuka’s power ballad is tacked on at the end here.\n\nI’ve written about Hirakawachi 1-chome before. The duo recently reformed for a series of gigs on the 10th anniversary year of their split and their previously-estranged mom came to see their tour finale. Elder brother Ryunosuke has remained in music all the while (he also married a single mother & they recently had their 1st child), but younger brother Naojiro’s now a personal trainer.\n\n81. Lia – Tori no Uta (2000)\n\n82. Supercell – Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari (2009)\n\n83. Ishiwatari Junji & Sunahara Yoshinori + Yakushimaru Etsuko – Kamisama no Iu toori (2010)\n\n84. DOES – Shuraba (2007)\n\n85. Suneohair – Waltz (2005)\n\n86. Galileo Galilei – Aoi Shiori (2011)\n\n87. Chatmonchy – Shangri-la (2006)\n\n88. Lama – Fantasy (2011)\n\n89. FLOW – DAYS (2005)\n\n90. SPYAIR – Samurai Heart (Some Like it Hot) (2011)\n\nAnime themes list. The first 10 that came to mind when I thought of ‘anisong’ – which apart from maybe Lia & Supercell, is probably not what other people think of when they think of ‘anisong’!\n\nThe opening bars of Suneohair’s Waltz evokes bittersweet memories tinged with regret, as I suspect it would do for those of us who watched and were able to relate to Honey & Clover during our college/uni days.\n\nAoi Shiori reminds me of Japan – I’d quit my job & was living in Japan, doing my ‘jibun sagashi’ thing when the song was released that summer. I particularly like the line ‘Mada jikan wa bokura no mono de’ (Time is still ours to spend as we wish).\n\n91. DREAMS COME TRUE – Asa ga Mata Kuru (1999)\n\n92. Superfly – Ai o Komete Hanataba o (2008)\n\n93. JUJU – I can be free (2008)\n\n94. Nishino Kana – Tatoe donna ni… (2011)\n\n95. Dew – Dandelion (2008)\n\n96. Natsukawa Rimi – Nada Sousou (2001)\n\n97. Cocco – Jukai no Ito (1999)\n\n98. ZONE – Secret Base ~Kimi ga kureta mono~ (2001)\n\n99. Fayray – feel (2004)\n\n100. RUI (Shibasaki Kou) – Tsuki no Shizuku (2003)\n\n101. Shojo Jidai – you-aholic (2011)\n\n102. Spangle call Lilli line – Crawl (2002)\n\n103. Supercar – Yumegiwa Last Boy (2002)\n\n104. Nao’ymt feat. S-key-A – Okay (2008)\n\n105. Perfume – 575 (2010)\n\n106. Amuro Namie – COPY THAT (2009)\n\n107. Apogee – 1,2,3 (2009)\n\n108. Modern Conya – Namida no Ame (2003)\n\n109. Aira Mitsuki – China Discotica (2008)\n\n110. Sakanaction – Identity (2011)\n\nA vague attempt at an electronic-themed list.\n\n111. Kobukuro – Million Films (2004)\n\n112. Sukimaswitch – Furete Mirai o (2004)\n\n113. Sasuke – Ajisai no Uta (2004)\n\n114. Hata Motohiro – Uroko (2007)\n\n115. L’arc~en~ciel – Honey (1998)\n\n116. Fujifrabric – Akakiniro no Kinmokusei (2004)\n\n117. Kuchiroro – Hawaii (2005)\n\n118. BUMP OF CHICKEN – Guild (2004)\n\n119. Oda Kazumasa – Masshiro (2004)\n\n120. The Miceteeth – Kiri no Naka (2004)\n\nGuild was a song that meant a lot to me when it was first released (on the album Yggdrasil) – lyrics about being tired and feeling like there’s no point in being alive resonated within me.\n\nMentioned it before, but I don’t really listen to Fujifabric’s music any more after they chose to continue on when vocalist Shimura Masahiko died – he was the last remaining original member of the band from the indie days and I don’t recognize anything of what Fujifabric used to be.\n\nThe Miceteeth are my favourite J-ska group but of course, I had to pick the one song that’s most unska-like. Try Subarashii Hibi for something a little more upbeat & typical of their sound.\n\n121. Ketsumeishi – Sakura (2005)\n\n122. Hilcrhyme – Shunkashūtō (2009)\n\n123. RIP SLYME – Tasogare Surround (2004)\n\n124. Aqua Timez – Sen no Yoru o Koete (2006)\n\n125. ORANGE RANGE – Ikenai Taiyō (2007)\n\n126. Steady&Co. – Shunkashūtō (2001)\n\n127. Dragon Ash – Shizuka na Hibi o Kaidan o (2000)\n\n128. Ozawa Kenji feat. Scha dara Parr – Kon’ya wa Boogie Back (1994)\n\n129. HOME MADE KAZOKU – Thank you!! (2005)\n\n130. Spontania feat. Juju – Kimi no Subete ni (2008)\n\nMainstream hip-hop/rap songs. I had a tendency to pick them when I went for solo karaoke in Japan despite having the rapping skills of a drunk priest.\n\n131. BONNIE PINK – Last Kiss (2004)\n\n132. KOKIA – Arigatō… (1999)\n\n133. Tomosaka Rie – Cappucino (1999)\n\n134. Odani Misako – rain (1997)\n\n135. Shibata Jun – Hoshi no Yoin (2002)\n\n136. Le Couple – Sofa (1997)\n\n137. Hana*Hana – Sayonara Daisuki na Hito (2000)\n\n138. Hirosue Ryoko – Rhythm (1999)\n\n139. I WiSH – Asu e no Tobira (2003)\n\n140. Kiroro – Nagai Aida (1998)\n\nQuite a few of my early favourite Jpop songs on this list, which in hindsight, were pretty depressing. KOKIA’s is an ode to someone who’s died, Hana*Hana’s is a breakup song, and I can’t think of many Shibata Jun songs that aren’t depressing…\n\nHirosue Ryoko ain’t a great singer (she’s an actress so…) but I spent so much time listening to her albums which I had loaded on my old Creative Jukebox Zen MP3 player, during the 4 & 1/2 hour bus rides between London Heathrow and my boarding school in Somerset. I didn’t even own a mobile phone then, fun times.\n\nI didn’t learn until a lot later on that Cappucino was a Shiina Ringo-written track (which she eventually self-covered), but I still prefer Tomosaka’s version\n\nI thought Last Kiss might’ve been the weirdest choice for an anime theme ever but somehow, the lyrics ended up fitting Gantz so perfectly. Odd.\n\n141. Mr. Children – Sign (2004)\n\n142. TUBE – Natsu Matsuri (2004)\n\n143. Under Graph – Paradigm (2005)\n\n144. Do As Infinity – Tooku made… (2001)\n\n145. KUMACHI – Sayonara (2003)\n\n146. Kuwata Keisuke – Shiroi Koibitotachi (2001)\n\n147. LUNA SEA – I For You (1998)\n\n148. Janne Da Arc – Gekkōka (2005)\n\n149. Ulfuls – Waraereba (2002)\n\n150. 19 – Ashiato (2001)\n\nMore of those ‘ultimate favourite tunes’ (I have a lot of those). DAI was one of the first Jpop/rock bands I got into, and I remember having to hunt down their CDs when I went on holiday to Singapore back in the day before Internet shopping existed.\n\n151. Kaientai – Okuru Kotoba (1979)\n\n152. Ogura Kei – Saraba Seishun (1971)\n\n153. Iruka – Nagoriyuki (1975)\n\n154. Sakamoto Kyu – Ue o Muite Arukou (1961)\n\n155. EPO – U, Fu, Fu, Fu (1983)\n\n156. Kai Band – Anna (1979)\n\n157. Hamada Shogo – Midnight Flight -Hitoribocchi no Christmas Eve- (1985)\n\n158. Matsuda Seiko – Akai Sweet Pea (1982)\n\n159. Nakajima Miyuki/Kashiwabara Yoshie – Haru na no ni (1983)\n\n160. Ota Hiromi – Shiawase Miman (1977)\n\nClassics, classics, classics. I wish I had more time to discover more of them. I do get fed up with modern day artists picking the same ones over and over to cover though – I really don’t want to hear another version of Nagoriyuki tbh…\n\n161. Moriyama Naotaro – Toki no Yukue~Jō.Haru no Sora~ (2005)\n\n162. BEGIN – Kimi o Miteiru (2004)\n\n163. HY – Toki o Koe (2010)\n\n164. Atari Kosuke – Ieji (2006)\n\n165. Koja Misako – Warabigami (1997)\n\n166. Nakashima Mika – Sakurairo Mau Koro (2005)\n\n167. Matsushita Nao with Gontiti – Tsuyukusa (2006)\n\n168. Rin’ – Sakura Sakura (instrumental with shakuhachi, shamisen) (2005)\n\n169. Oshio Kotaro – Sakura. Saku koro (2004)\n\n170. Hitoto Yo – Morainaki (2002)\n\nSongs with a traditional feel, which tend to set my tear ducts into action pretty quickly. HY’s Toki o Koe, an Okinawan-flavoured tune (backed by a modern choir!) about the sacrifices of grandparents gets me every time.\n\nKoja Misako’s Warabigami may sound alien to most – it’s sung in Uchinaguchi (Okinawan language) though over the years the likes of Natsukawa Rimi & Hana*Hana have recorded it in standard Japanese\n\nAt first I thought Morainaki was partly sung in a foreign language before I realized it was just Hitoto’s version of…yodelling or something. She’s half-Taiwanese, and her life has been eventful. Her parents died early on – her father when she was a young child, and her mother when she was 16. She got entangled in a messy affair with musician/producer Kobayashi Takeshi (who was married to his My Little Lover bandmate Akko at the time) in 2007 but they split in 2013 and she’s now married to guitarist Yamaguchi Shuhei and they have a child.\n\nAnd yes people might remember Moriyama Naotaro for dissing anisong back in 2005 or so when he wished the moe and Akiba-kei stuff would disappear (responding to seeing Negima on the charts). His songs are lovely though, and the classic Sakura was later covered by Idolmaster seiyuu! w\n\n171. RYTHEM – Kasumizakura (2007)\n\n172. I WiSH – Yakusoku no Hi (2004)\n\n173. Matsumoto Eiko – Naturally Yours (2000)\n\n174. Ganaha Mina – Tsuki no Shizuku (2006)\n\n175. Michelle143 – Futarigurashi (2006)\n\n176. Takei Shiori – Sakurairo (2006)\n\n177. Hoshimura Mai – EVERY (2005)\n\n178. Takaoka Ai – LaLaLa (2004)\n\n179. Lyrico – Kiseki no Hana (2002)\n\n180. Le Couple – Ichinichi no Owari ni (2000)\n\nFemale singers, mostly ballads. There are a lot of these types in Japan, and most are underappreciated chart-wise.\n\nLyrico now operates under her real name Tsuyuzaki Harumi. She’s a powerhouse vocalist that again, Japan can’t seem to appreciate ‘cos it ain’t cute or novel.\n\nI thought Takei Shiori (signed to Giza, home of Kuraki Mai etc) had a lot of potential but it just didn’t work out for her and she retired from singing at the age of 23 when her contract ended. Now a normal salarywoman.\n\nSimilar story for Takaoka Ai, another Giza talent who left the company in 2009 and after 2 years at Box Corporation, went on hiatus in 2011 at age 29.

This is another subset of Jpop that I couldn’t quite get into – tried hard with the genre’s main exponents ie Pizzicato Five, Cibo Matto, Cornelius, Kahimi Karie etc but they all flew over my head.

Sowelu – Last Forever (2004)\n\nI used to be a massive fan of EXILE when Shun was still in the group – I never felt like Takahiro matched up with Atsushi as well as Shun did, and Hane 1/2 is the best example of why. I watched the video of that medley of songs the pair did during a reunion performance at Atsushi’s live last year and like most of the crowd (and Atsushi himself), I was in tears throughout.\n\n511. APOGEE – Spacy Blues (2008)\n\n512. Toddle – Hesitate to see (2005)\n\n513. Chirinuruwowaka – Hanamuke (2005)\n\n514. LOSTAGE – Tanemaku Hitobito (2006)\n\n515. Oceanlane – Sign (2005)\n\n516. detroit7 – Raymond (2005)\n\n517. Spangle call Lilli line – rara (2010)\n\n518. Hirama Mikio – Serifu (2005)\n\n519. Bugy Craxone – 11gatsu (2004)\n\n520. Tsubaki – Memai (2005)\n\nTsubaki were one of the earlier melodic Jrock bands I got into during my uni days. Sadly vocalist Isshiki Noriyasu succumbed to brain cancer in 2017, an ailment he had been suffering from since 2010.\n\nUsually abhor the terrifying attempts by Japanese bands to Engrish (re: Beat Crusaders etc) but Oceanlane were different, because singer Kay Naoe is half-English.\n\n521. Takahashi Mikako – Negai no Toki (2003)\n\n522. Ishikawa Chiaki – Uninstall (2007)\n\n523. Faylan – AROUSING SOUL (2009)\n\n524. Hashimoto Miyuki – innocence (2005)\n\n525. Chiba Saeko & Nanri Yuuka – Without you (2005)\n\n526. Tomatsu Haruka – motto Hade ni ne! (2008)\n\n527. Sphere – Now loading…SKY!! (2010)\n\n528. eufonius – Bokura no Jikan (2005)\n\n529. Ceui – Centifolia (2009)\n\n530. Atsumi Saori – Mou sukoshi…mou sukoshi… (2003)\n\nAnother group of much-loved songs from anisong artists, seiyuu and the like. Though some of them remind me of series I’d rather forget, like Takahashi’s ending theme from L/R: Licensed by Royal, which probably ranks amongst the 10 worst anime I’ve had the displeasure of completing. Back in those days, you watched whatever was fansubbed – beggars can’t afford to be choosy.\n\n531. Idoling!!! – Queen Bee~Shōjo no Jidai kara~ (2011)\n\n532. Afilia Saga – Embrace Blade (2015)\n\n533. AKB48 – Koisuru Fortune Cookie (2013)\n\n534. BoA – LISTEN TO MY HEART (2002)\n\n535. Dream – Kono Natsu ga Owaru Mae ni (2005)\n\n536. Move – silent white? (2000)\n\n537. Utada Hikaru – Automatic (1998)\n\n538. Speed – my graduation (1998)\n\n539. Sugawara Sayuri – Kimi ga Iru kara (2009)\n\n540. Perfume – love the world (2008)\n\nThis was supposed to be a female idol-centric theme but as you can see, I ran out of selections pretty fast. Never understood Momusu or things like that 20 years ago so not much has changed there.\n\nThe Idoling!!! song came at the peak of the Hallyu wave in Japan and was pretty much, the most Kpop thing not made by a Kpop group. It was written by Sweetune, for one thing.\n\nKoisuru Fortune Cookie is one of only two AKB48 songs I can claim to like – the other being Sugar Rush.\n\nAnd of course BoA was my introduction to Kpop even though her style was so distinctively urban Jpop\n\nPerfume’s love the world was my ringtone (on my old HTC) for a long while.\n\n541. Horishita Sayuri – honey (2004)\n\n542. Fairlife feat. Kishitani Kaori – Niji (2004)\n\n543. Matsukura Saori – Choucho. (2006)\n\n544. Hoshimura Mai – Sunao ni Narenai (2005)\n\n545. Kanno Yoko & Kiyoura Natsumi – Obento o Tabenagara (2009)\n\n546. Youmou to Ohana – Yureru (2008)\n\n547. Nakano Yoshie – Soleil (2008)\n\n548. dorlis x Toki Asako – Room 305 (2010)\n\n549. BONNIE PINK – Water Me (2007)\n\n550. I’s CUBE – Hane (2008)\n\n551. Noto Mamiko – Yūgao (2004)\n\n552. Kotobuki Minako – Hikari no Kage (2009)\n\n553. Horie Yui – Andante (2005)\n\n554. Ueda Kana – FLOWER IN THE DARK (2005)\n\n555. Kuribayashi Minami – Hoshizora no Waltz (2003)\n\n556. Ohara Sayaka – ray of light (2004)\n\n557. Hirano Aya – Doushite… (2006)\n\n558. Ueda Kana, Horie Yui, Tamura Yukari – Compass ~Egao no Yukue~ (2005)\n\n559. Tamura Yukari – Hanbun (2005)\n\n560. Kawaragi Shiho – Rin to, Rin to (2006)\n\nCharacter songs-centric (do play spot the ancient forgotten series!). Somehow there ended up being quite a few Ueda Kana-featuring tracks (well, 4) in this list overall. Guess she was just the flavour of the day back then thanks to Fate/stay night etc\n\n561. Haisuinonasa – Aru Yoru no Kokyū (2012)\n\n562. Schroeder-Headz – Blue Bird (2014)\n\n563. Kotringo – Konnichiwa Mata Ashita (2007)\n\n564. Singer Songer – Shoka Rinrin (2005)\n\n565. YUKI – Dramatic (2005)\n\n566. Cocco – Dugong no Mieru Oka ni (2005)\n\n567. Rurutia – Selenite (2005)\n\n568. MAMALAID RAG – Harusame Dōchū (2002)\n\n569. L’arc~en~ciel – Hitomi no Jūnin (2004)\n\n570. the pillows – Ice Pick (2007)\n\n571. Arai Akino – VOICES (1994)\n\n572. Tane Tomoko – Love Song (1998)\n\n573. Honda Minako – Kaze no Uta (1999)\n\n574. Jinguji Sakura & Teikoku Kagekidan – Yume Mite Iyou (2000)\n\n575. Kotobuki Minako – metamorphose (2010)\n\n576. Takagaki Ayahi – LIFE (2009)\n\n577. Toyama Nao – Koko kara Hajimaru Monogatari (2011)\n\n578. Hayami Saori – Yume no Hate made (2017)\n\n579. mao – Sentiment (2010)\n\n580. Aina – Yasashii Sayonara (2005)\n\nHayami’s song is one of the newest songs on the list. It’s the best song Takeuchi Mariya’s written in years, that she really should’ve kept for herself.\n\n581. Kiroro – Mirai e (1998)\n\n582. day after tomorrow – for you (2002)\n\n583. Mizuki Arisa – Hitomi no Chikara (2002)\n\n584. Atsumi Saori – Ashita ni Nareba (2006)\n\n585.

Every Little Thing – nostalgia (2002)\n\n591. Love Psychedelico – This is a Love Song (2002)\n\n592. Hysteric Blue – Naze… (1999)\n\n593. the brilliant green – There will be love there ~Ai no Aru Basho~ (1998)\n\n594. Nishihata Saori – Hearts (2001)\n\n595. Sleepin’ JohnnyFish – Radio Jack (2003)\n\n596. Scudelia Electro – Sha la la (2002)\n\n597. Kurosawa Kenichi – Pale Ale (2001)\n\n598. Changin’ My Life – Eternal Snow (2002)\n\n599. Shifo from UNIVERS★LD – Real (1999)\n\n600. BUCK-TICK – Kuchizuke (2010)\n\n601. Atari Kosuke – Natsu Yūzora (2008)\n\n602. Moriyama Naotaro – Kachōfūgetsu (2010)\n\n603. Nagayama Shōta – Arigatō (2006)\n\n604. Kawaguchi Kyogo – Suiyobi no Asa (2004)\n\n605. Kumaki Anri – Haru no Kaze (2007)\n\n606. Kawae Minako – Shiawase (2005)\n\n607. Ohnuki Taeko – Anata o Omou to (2001)\n\n608. Hajime Chitose – Miyori no Mori (2007)\n\n609. SAKURANBO – Poroporo (2005)\n\n610. Hikawa Kiyoshi – Omokage no Miyako (2005)\n\nAh, I didn’t know where to tack on the one and only contemporary enka song I love…it still sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\n611. riya – Dianoia (2004)\n\n612. Veil x Lia – Tazunebito (2008)\n\n613. Duca – platonic syndrome (2009)\n\n614. Hashimoto Miyuki – Star Drops (2007)\n\n615. Chata – Kawari yuku Sekai no Tame ni (2006)\n\n616. Marie – Seikōtōtei (2009)\n\n617. Misato Aki – Montage (2004)\n\n618. Kotera Kanako – Cry for me, cry for you (2007)\n\n619. Murata Ayumi – Shining Star (2004)\n\n620. KAKO – Junka (2007)\n\nEroge themes. I got into these through playing Stepmania to relieve the monotony of doing my uni dissertation.\n\n621. Katakiri Rekka x Shimotsuki Haruka [MW] – Tamashii no Dōkoku (2009)\n\n622. UR@N – refrain moon (2007)\n\n623. eufonius – Narcissus (2005)\n\n624. Chata – Shizai Senri~Koihime Yobite Hyakka no Ou to Nasu (2007)\n\n625. Faylan – Gekka no Rasen (2007)\n\n626. Ayumu – Occultics no Majo (2009)\n\n627. Yuna – Towarebito (2006)\n\n628. flair – Subarashii Sekai (2005)\n\n629. Nakahara Suzuka – Remember (2006)\n\n630. yozuca* – My wish = Only one (2010)\n\nMostly eroge/game themes. flair’s is a song written by Koshiro Yuzo for the Namco X Capcom game.\n\n631. Chano – Kimi to Watashi o Tsunagu Mono (2010)\n\n632. 40mp – Natsukoi Hanabi (2010)\n\n633. fhána – kotonoha breakdown (2012)\n\n634. Fullkawa Honpo (feat. Kikuchi Ryota) – Storywriter (2013)\n\n635. Sasanomaly – Kyokankaku Obake (2015)\n\n636. Duca – Ai no Niwa (2007)\n\n637. Marie – Clover Heart’s (2003)\n\n638. Yuria – Koe ga Kikoeru ~Calling You~ (2007)\n\n639. Nana – Be_Natural (2006)\n\n640. KAORI – Tenmu no Mai, Akatsuki no Mon (2005)\n\nMix of more eroge songs and doujin music.\n\nI’d gotten into fhána through kotonoha breakdown, which featured the vocal of Naka Makiko from Tornado Tatsumaki. The EP it was taken off (New World Line) was from before the group hired towana as a fixed vocalist and went major. Not trying to be a snob or whatever but their music now doesn’t appeal to me as much – too much polish and overproduction; I prefer a more understated, stripped-down sound.\n\nStorywriter is one of those songs that makes me feel depressed upon listening, even if the lyrical content isn’t particularly sad. It’s a pity Fullkawa has been in semi-hiatus mode since 2015\n\n641. Ishii Tatsuya – River (2003)\n\n642. SOX – B-chiku Sentai SOX (2015)\n\n643. Onmyoza – Kōga Ninpōchō (2005)\n\n644. GRANRODEO – Hen’ai no Rondo (2013)\n\n645. UVERworld – D-tecnolife (2005)\n\n646. Stereo Dive Foundation – Daisy (2013)\n\n647. Takahashi Naozumi – Muteki na Smile (2006)\n\n648. Ide Yasuaki – Reckless Fire (2001)\n\n649. wyse – Kokoro no Sukima (2002)\n\n650. Kotani Kinya – Glaring Dream (2000)\n\nGrab bag of anime themes. Glaring Dream is from Gravitation, which represented my first taste of anything LGBT in anime.\n\n651. 9nine – Cross Over (2010)\n\n652. TRUSTRICK – Flying Fafnir (2015)\n\n653. ZAQ – hopeness (2016)\n\n654. ELISA – hikari (2008)\n\n655. ClariS – Connect (2011)\n\n656. Aimer – Anata ni Deawanakereba~Kasetsutōka~ (2012)\n\n657. Kon Natsumi – Niji no Kakera (2014)\n\n658. AKINO from bless4 – Miiro (2015)\n\n659. Avaivartika – Sky5 (2015)\n\n660. Origa – Mizu no Madoromi (2004)\n\nSome of my ‘newer’ anisong favourites (apart from Origa I suppose). Though anything within the last 10 years seems ‘new’ to me….\n\n661. tiaraway – Omoide good night (2004)\n\n662. savage genius – Itsuka Tokeru Namida (2006)\n\n663. Suzuki Tatsuhisa – Towayuki (2006)\n\n664. Cell Division (Suzuki Tatsuhisa & Hatano Wataru) – Sweet Depression (2007)\n\n665. Brace;d – Devotion (2006)\n\n666. Tanisaki Naomi – Daisuki dayo (Into Your Heart) (2004)\n\n667. Saegusa U-ka in db – Whenever I think of you (2002)\n\n668. Under17 – Kujibiki Unbalance (2004)\n\n669. Miko Twins (Kadowaki Mai & Matsuki Miyu) – just for my love (2005)\n\n670. Makishima Yuki, Yoshikawa Yukako & Fujita Saki – Himitsu (2007)\n\nThese were all tracks that I loved when they were released, but I had not listened to for a very long time. Some not in 10 years! Really loved Sweet Depression, released back when I thought 90% of male seiyuu sang dreadfully – how times have changed.\n\n671. More Peach Summer Snow (Noto Mamiko, Ikezawa Haruna, Saito Chiwa, Hirohashi Ryo) – Gaburingo Kajiri Tai (2005)\n\n672. Saito Chiwa – Kami to Hairpin to Watashi (2006)\n\n673. Kondo Takashi – Hitori Bocchi no Unmei (2007)\n\n674. Eclipse (Tomatsu Haruka, Hayami Saori, Nakajima Megumi) – nO limiT (2009)\n\n675. Chiba Saeko, Orikasa Fumiko, Kawasumi Ayako, Noto Mamiko – Ichigo Complete (2005)\n\n676. Inoue Marina – Bara no Hitsugi (2006)\n\n677. Horie Yui, Nonaka Ai, Inoue Marina, Hirano Aya, Fujita Saki – A Happy Life (2007)\n\n678. Sphere – Hazy (2011)\n\n679. Sasaki Nozomi – Futari no Kisetsu ga (2006)\n\n680. Toyoguchi Megumi – Gindokei (2005)\n\nMore character and seiyuu unit songs.\n\nMore Peach Summer Snow has always been my favourite seiyuu idol unit name as it’s named after the characters: Moa + Momo(ka) + Natsu(mi) + (Ko)yuki. The lyrics also played around with those themes\n\nSome songs instantly make your heart soar due to the memories they evoke and that final EP seiyuu cast’s cover of A Happy Life is one example. Manabi Straight! was truly something special to me at the time.\n\n681. NakamuraEmi – YAMABIKO (2016)\n\n682. haruka nakamura – Luv (sic) pt2 [acoustica] w/ Shing02 (2013)\n\n683. amarazashi – Anomie (2011)\n\n684. Tanimura Nao – If I’m not the one (2008)\n\n685.

Awesome City Club – Outsider (2015)\n\n700. TAMTAM – Enter Key (2014)\n\nNewer indie music, though some of them have gone major.\n\n701. Morita Koichi & Top Gallant – Seishun Jidai (1976)\n\n702. Watanabe Machiko – Kuchibiru yo, Atsuku Kimi o Katare (1980)\n\n703. Matsuyama Chiharu – Koi (1980)\n\n704. The Wild Ones – Omoide no Nagisa (1966)\n\n705.

Mori Shinichi – Minatomachi Blues (1969)\n\n710. Pinky & Killers – Koi no Kisetsu (1969)\n\nA few more folk and classic pop songs. Music was so innocent back then, ugly old dudes regularly appeared on TV and idols could actually sing…ah.\n\n711. Suzuki Konomi – DAYS of DASH (2012)\n\n712. SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki – aLIEz (2014)\n\n713. Kitade Nana – Kesenai Tsumi (2003)\n\n714. Taneda Risa – Wareta Ringo (2013)\n\n715. fhána – Que Sera Sera (2013)\n\n716. Itou Kanako – Fetishism Ark (2010)\n\n717. Mizuhara Mai from Harajuku BJ Girls – Brand New Morning (2006)\n\n718. binaria (Yanagi Nagi + annabel) – Kamiiro Awase (2016)\n\n719. Suara – Hikari no Kisetsu (2006)\n\n720. Takahashi Hitomi – Atashi no Machi, Ashita no Machi (2008)\n\nAnisong tracks by female vocalists of the upbeat variety.\n\nthe mizuki with Sawano is from the indie band Itsue who feature somewhere else on this list\n\nI was so uninterested in seiyuu at the time Shin Sekai Yori aired that I didn’t even know Taneda Risa was a seiyuu and not a singer w\n\nOf course, Mizuhara Mai is now better known as the singer from GARNiDELiA.\n\n721.

MIO – Mieru Darō Byston Well (1983)\n\n730. Moriguchi Hiroko – ETERNAL WIND ~Hohoemi Hikaru Kaze no Naka~ (1991)\n\nAnisong classics! Maybe it’s a stretch to call the Gate Keepers OP a classic when it’s only 18 years old…\n\n731. whoo – Diary (feat Kakin) (2013)\n\n732. Honeyworks – Boku ga Namae o Yobu Hi (feat.
