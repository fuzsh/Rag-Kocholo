        "text": "The Ghost Hotel\n\nHere I am with a new travel in the past in “Throwback Thursday”! Today’s subject is a release by the visual band Pentagon, but this time we get back to their second album Welcome to Ghost Hotel, come out on 27th January 2016. The concept of this release is strictly linked to their extravagant concept, set in a gothic and bizarre atmosphere. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Front: the album starts with a dark and disquieting theme, leading up to a retrò melody, accompained by obscure vocals.\n\n-Welcome to Ghost Hotel [horror hotel]: the title-track starts following up the theme of the previous one, with animated vocals leading up to a rhythmed and gothic-ish, with a bit of grotesque and aggressive vibe; a quite decent song. —> 8/10\n\n-Shounen Waltz (Waltz boy) [waltz for the loved one]: *already reviewed by me* —> 8.5/10\n\n-Believe [believing in ourselves]: this song starts with an aggressive beat, leading up to a fast and freaking rhythm, underlined with strong guitar parts; Chizuru’s voice is high-toned, keeping up a good song, even with some heavy shade. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Here I am [being together in despair]: a steady guitar opens this song, featuring an energetic and fresh rhythm, which goes on in a paced way; the vocals are pretty limpid, where the guitar becomes more intense, building up a flowing and pretty engaging song. —> 9/10\n\n-Jesus Phobia [cult of beauty]: *already reviewed by me* —> 9/10\n\n-Subarashii “kyouiku” (Fabulous “education”) [brainwashing]: Chizuru’s vibrant voice kicks off a song which turns back to the grotesque vibe, with some exotic shade; the vocals become faster, along with a beating rhythm, easy to follow, thanks to a good drumming work; a nice song, well developed by the instruments. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Nimensou Cinderella (Double-phase Cinderella) [lost innocence]: this song starts with a fast rhythm, dyed by freaking notes, which explodes in a rapid and grotesque theme; the vocals are pretty animated, accompained by a limpid guitar and a steady rhythm, for a funny song, featuring a catchy refrain. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Tetsu kizu (Lost bruise) [drawing the future together]: *already reviewed by me* —> 8.5/10\n\n-Fuyu uta (Winter song) [waiting the end of winter for meeting the loved one]: this song is introduced by a limpid piano, leading up to a theme driven by a sustained rhythm and soft and crystalline notes; the vocals are clear and balanced, driving a passionate and well structured ballad, helped by a really interesting and suggestive vocal interpretation. —> 9/10\n\n-Fumikiri maigo (Letters intersection) [hypocrisy]: fast notes and a dynamic drumming open this song, putting the release again in the retrò-grotesque vibe; Chizuru’s voice is steady and the guitar is balanced, building up an interesting song, really unpredictable and rich of style changes. —> 9/10\n\n-Dejavu panic [someone revokes a memory of the past]: this track starts with dark notes and an aggressive rhythm, leading up to an extreme and strong theme; the vocals alternate between screamo parts with clearer and more intense ones, for a pleasant and catchy song, empowered by the guitar’s presence. —> 9/10\n\n-Kanchigai kakumei (Incomprehensive revolution) [things can’t be changed at all]: the album ends with a song featuring a steady rhythm which opens to an energetic and freaking theme, ending this release in the same way which it started. —> 8.5/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 8.5/10\n\nAfter one year of career, characterized by a solid debut album and two different but engaging singles, Pentagon estabilished their own style with this second album, putting the basis of their own music for the following years. Gothic settings with a bit of grotesque, freaking but quite refined themes, impressive vocal performances and a significant alternance between soft and heavy are the core elements of the release, which defects only in balancing all these features altogether, leaving some hole during the execution in general. But this won’t stop us to suggest you to start to listen to Pentagon’s music, as, despite all the flaws, it’s worth your time and you will have only fun in doing that. An album for who needs a funny visual band or is looking for revaluing Pentagon’s sound, freaking and entertaining.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you for a new band review in “Focusing on”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nAnxious and Confused\n\nHere I am with the final part of “Let’s Listen to”! Talking always about Pentagon, we are going to review their latest work, the seventh single Culture Shock, come out on 23rd January 2019. The single’s concept is linked to the sense of anxiety and confusion coming from a radical change in terms of society and habits. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Culture Shock: the single starts with the title-track, opening with Chizuru’s steady vocals and a strong beat, leading up to a powerful rhythm, quite surprising for them, where the vocals become more intense, in a compelling refrain, made of pure energy; an awesome song and one of their best ones so far. —> 9.5/10\n\n-27: the first b-side starts with suffused beats and quite soft vocals, accompained by Minpha’s subtle bass; the vocal interpretation is quite simple, but well driven by the bright guitar, in a light and nostalgical rock song. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Lonely one: the single ends with a song introduced by melancholic notes, leading up to a rhythmed and steady theme, with a dynamic work by the guitar and flowing and warm vocals; the song is well managed, swaying between a romantic and nostalgical vibe without any effort. —> 9/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 9/10\n\nFinally Pentagon seemed to have found their own shape, in musical terms. In fact, if the two previous singles were lacking of a sort of energy, with the second starting to enclose it, in Culture Shock we can say that they fulfilled their goal in becoming more addictive. Three songs, balanced and well performed, where the lead theme is the highest peak, thanks to a singular technique and mature vocals, are the core of this single, where the soft and the heavy are mixed in a clever way, offering to the audience a consistent example of what Pentagon is really able to do. We can hope that this band will become even better, so fingers crossed! A single for who was looking for Pentagon’s musical breakout, united with a touch of melancholia and nostalgical notes.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new time-travel in “Throwback Thursday”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nUseless Desire\n\nHere I am with the second part of “Let’s Listen to”! Let’s continue to talk about the visual kei band Pentagon, with the sixth single Mantra, come out on 04th July 2018. This single deals with the image of the Hinduist concept of mantra, used for describing an useless desire of salvation from own sins. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Mantra: the title-track opens the single with an energetic and dark theme; here Chizuru’s voice is more aggressive than expected, leading up a fast and well rhythmed melody, made of dynamic parts and unpredictable twists; a really good and catchy song. —> 9/10\n\n-Mellow Sunset Beach: the first b-side has a cheerful and summer-ish sound, as per title; the vocals are limpid, driving a quite simple and flowing rhythm, for a positive and pretty enjoyable rock song, in its own. —> 9/10\n\n-Monochrome: the single ends with a song kicked off by soft notes and an energetic beat, with electronic vocals; then the theme becomes more energetic, well kept up by Chizuru’s vocal performance and the instrumental work, well mixed in this good track. —> 9/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 9/10\n\nSo, after a pretty plain phase for their sound, Pentagon turns back to its energetic roots, bringing out a fresh and entertaining single, fitting his Summer release. Their extravagant soul is still there, but this time the melodies are more refined and dynamic, with a certain versatility showed by the vocalist Chizuru and some technical feat coming from the other members. Mantra is the release you might not expect from a band like them, confirming that they have still the cards for becoming an important act in the scene, as they showed in their early days. A single for who loves a mix between extravaganza and energy, provided by the visual band Pentagon.\n\nDo the Wrong Thing!\n\nHere I am with the first part of “Let’s Listen to”, dedicated to last month’s featured band! Today’s subjects are the most recent singles by the visual kei band Pentagon, starting from the fifth one, Hankou seimei (Insubordinate declaration), come out on 7th February 2018. The concept of this release is doing the wrong thing, even if it is actually the right one. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Hankou seimei: the single starts with the title-track, kicked off by a fast drumming which keeps up with a rapid rhythm put in an extravagant melody; the vocals are piercing and fast, for a catchy and quite simple song. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Yotogibana (Talking nocturne scenes): the first b-side starts with the sound of rain, leading up to an energetic and more positive theme, with a good guitar playing; Chizuru’s voice is clearer, in a song which maintains the good level brought up by the release. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Goodbye: the single ends with a song opened by a ticking clock; then the melody, dyed by a retrò shade, invests the whole thing, along with Chizuru’s light and electronic-ish vocals, where the theme develops gradually, in a playful and nostalgical track, quite easy to listen. —> 8/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 8/10\n\nPentagon is a band with many and various sides, which they draw from each time for each release. In Hankou seimei the band decided to going closer to their extravagant and freaking shade, even being lighter than their early times, an approach started two years before with Popcorn Monster. The final result is a single of an average quality, made of good performances and easy themes, made only of energy and fun, worth of this band’s unique world. If you are looking to something more compelling, you should lower your expectations here, as Pentagon wanted only to have fun with their audience, being successful in this mission. A single for who wants to listen to funny and catchy rock music, without a great technicality.\n\nAnd it doesn’t end here…\n\nFragile Bonds\n\nHere I am with a new song analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual kei band Baroque, precisely one of their most famous ones, Kizuna (Bonds), come out in the single with the same name on 12th December 2012. The song has a peculiar meaning for this band, featuring a catchy and flowing theme with a subject linked to one of the most pivotal aspects of human life.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nA cheerful guitar kicks off this song, along with a simple beat, leading up to a rhythmed and energetic rock theme; Ryo’s vocals are animated and really flowing, keeping up this enjoyable song, pleasant and easy to listen, with a relevant guitar work.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nDono wakare ni mo imi ga aru nara\n\nbokutachi no baai wa nandarou?\n\nsono kotae sagashi nagara kyou mo\n\nkimi no inai michi wo susumunda.\n\nAtarimae ni tonari ni ita hibi\n\nkudaranai kenka sae natsukashii\n\nshinjiru shinjinai toka janaku\n\ntada kokoro kara itsumo waratta.\n\nKimi wa kimatte nayama shii toki hodo\n\nomoidetsure te sugata wo miseru\n\nkawarazu ima mo sasaerarete iru to kizuitakara.\n\nDoredake hanareteite mo soba ni kanjirunda\n\nkokoro kitto tsunagatteru kara\n\nnido to aenai to shitemo bokutachi wa tsuzuiteku\n\ntomoni aruku yo.\n\nIma nani wo mite nani wo kanji teru no?\n\nboku ni wa toutei wakaranai keredo\n\nkono shunkan mo shiawase deite hoshii soredakenanda.\n\nKazoe kirenai deai ga boku ni matte itemo\n\nkimi no kawari wa inai kara\n\nnagare yuku toki no naka taisetsuna mono wo zutto\n\nkoko ni kanjite.\n\nKenmei ni hashiri nuke ru tagai no michi no saki de\n\ntatoeba honno wazukademo terashi aeta nara.\n\nDoredake hanarete itemo soba ni kanjirunda\n\nkokoro kitto tsunagatteru kara\n\nnidoto ae nai toshitemo bokutachi wa tsuzuiteku\n\ntomoni aruku yo.\n\nKimi to omone ta aoi kisetsu ni\n\nkoukai dakeha kesshite sasenai\n\nano nichi no mirai wo tsukan demiseru.\n\nDono wakare nimo imi gaarunara\n\nbokutachi no baai wa nandarou?\n\nsono kotae wa bokutachide tsukurunda.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nIf each separation would make sense\n\nWhat is our situation?\n\nWhile I am looking for an answer\n\nI will go on the road without you.\n\nOf course I was close to anybody else\n\nEven a silly nostalgical fight\n\nBelieve it or not\n\nI might laugh of it in my heart. (I)\n\nYou are definitely hard\n\nShow me the shape of your memories\n\nI noticed that nothing has changed and that I am still supported.\n\nEven if you are far, you will feel me by your side\n\nI am sure that my heart is connected\n\nWe will go on even if we won’t be able to meet again\n\nWe will walk together. (II)\n\nWhat are you seeing and feeling now?\n\nI don’t understand it at all\n\nI only want that you are happy in this moment.\n\nEven if I hadn’t considered it, a meeting awaits me\n\nBecause there’s not an alternative for you\n\nThe most important thing at the moment of going on\n\nFeel it here. (III)\n\nHardly running for each one’s road\n\nFor example if you can light some of it.\n\nEven if you are far, you will feel me by your side\n\nI am sure that my heart is connected\n\nWe will go on even if we won’t be able to meet again\n\nWe will walk together. (IV)\n\nYou repeated yourself in the blue season\n\nI won’t ever leave only regret\n\nI will catch the future of that day.\n\nIf each separation would make sense\n\nWhat is our situation?\n\nThe answer is made by us. (V)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by all the members of the band, the song has a plain layout, with precise lines, whose structure is sometimes flowing, sometimes cryptic (in my translation I tried to be closer to the original meaning, so if you find something wrong or whatever you can write me about that). The song’s subject is the human bonds, or better, their fragility, as they are not indivisible and sometimes a relationship can end for a multitude of reasons, but in some cases, despite the separation and the distance, the affection between the two is still present. The song can be seen as a reference to the bassist Bansaku’s sudden disappearance from the band, occurred at that time, which engaged a lot the two remaining members. And now… let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the protagonist who is wondering if the separations have a proper sense, asking what is the situation with his partner (Dono wakare ni mo imi ga aru nara/bokutachi no baai wa nandarou?), then he decides to look for the answer going on his road without the other person (sono kotae sagashi nagara kyou mo/kimi no inai michi wo susumunda); while he is closer to the other people, he starts to remember a silly fight he had with his partner, laughing in his own heart and living in the nostalgia for the past (Atarimae ni tonari ni ita hibi/kudaranai kenka sae natsukashii/shinjiru shinjinai toka janaku/tada kokoro kara itsumo waratta).\n\nII) He defines his partner as hard to understand (Kimi wa kimatte nayama shii toki hodo) and he asks him to show the shape of his past memories (omoidetsure te sugata wo miseru), realizing that nothing has changed in his life and that he is supported in his own existence (kawarazu ima mo sasaerarete iru to kizuitakara); even if his partner will be distant, he will be by his own side (Doredake hanareteite mo soba ni kanjirunda), as if his heart is connected (kokoro kitto tsunagatteru kara), and they will continue their lives even if they won’t meet anymore, as if they will walk together (nido to aenai to shitemo bokutachi wa tsuzuiteku/tomoni aruku yo).\n\nIII) He asks him what he is seeing and feeling, as he doesn’t understand that at all (Ima nani wo mite nani wo kanji teru no?/boku ni wa toutei wakaranai keredo), so he wants only that his partner is happy (kono shunkan mo shiawase deite hoshii soredakenanda); but despite everything, he thinks that they will meet each other again (Kazoe kirenai deai ga boku ni matte itemo), since there’s not an alternative to him (kimi no kawari wa inai kara), and invites him to feel the same while he goes on his own life (nido to aenai to shitemo bokutachi wa tsuzuiteku/tomoni aruku yo).\n\nIV) While they go on their own road, the protagonist hopes that his partner would light some of his path (Kenmei ni hashiri nuke ru tagai no michi no saki de/tatoeba honno wazukademo terashi aeta nara); after repeating the second half of the second sequence, the protagonist realizes that while his friend repeated his own mistakes in the blue season (Kimi to omone ta aoi kisetsu ni, the blue season can refer to winter, or to the time when Bansaku disappeared, on June), he won’t leave any regret and rather he will get to the future of the day they separated (koukai dakeha kesshite sasenai/ano nichi no mirai wo tsukan demiseru); the sequence ends with the repetition of the core question from the first sequence, whose answer, which he was looking for, is actually in themselves, in their choices (sono kotae wa bokutachide tsukurunda).\n\nSometimes two people get separated and get two different paths in their own lives, but it happens that their past feelings are still vivid, even while they live another experience. With this song Baroque hinted to a personal event, extending the concept to the fragility of human relationships, which are untied by the events, even if the connection can be still perceived.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\n*HELLO GUYS! FINALLY I RECOVERED THE POSTS OF THE PAST MONTHS; NOW I WILL GET TO DO THIS MONTH’S THEMED WEEK, ALONG WITH THE ALBUM SELECTION OF 2018, WHICH WILL COME OUT BACK-TO-BACK. THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT!*\n\nBaroque - First the Music, Then the Style\n\nHere I am with a new band special in “Focusing on”! Today’s subject is a visual band, which had a troubling and various career, but despite everything, they never stopped being good. We’re talking about Baroque, formed on 2001 and currently composed by Ryo (vo.) and Kei (gt.), both former members of the famous band Kannivalism; they used to have other members in the past, like Akira (gt.), who left on 2013, Bansaku (ba.), departed on 2012 and Yuji (dr.), who substituted Naru on 2002 and left the band the following year. The band name is a possible reference to the artistic current with the same name, even if they doesn’t have so much in relation with it. In fact their most relevant feature is their attitude in not being attached to a single style, fitting it to the sound they want to propose each time, making them lacking of a definite concept. Considered as one of the pioneers of the oshare kei, their genre, started as a funny punk-rock, enclosed more melodious themes, up to integrate electronic music as a basis until the current days, where they evolved the sound, as a duo, in a mature version of their best works. Their debut occured on 28th February 2002 with the first mini-album Tokyo Stripper, followed by the singles Sukebe Boy (Pervert boy), Chaplin and ila..\n\nThe title-track is a really cheerful rock theme, with soft vocals and well refined by the instruments; the song is about hoping for a future of peace and tranquillity. It has been followed by the singles Gariron, Gakidou (My street) and Nutty a Hermit. and the first album Sug Life (reviewed here). Then the band, because of Akira’s health issues, decided to disband on 2004, for then being reunited on 2011 as a three-man band. In this new phase they released the singles Monodrama, Teeny-tiny star, Rinzen identity (Ridiculous identity), Zazafuri ame (Pouring rain), Mellow Hollow and Kizuna (Bonds).\n\nThe title-track mixes up the cheerfulness of Baroque’s sound with a more energetic and mature touch; the song is about the fraility of human relationships. It has been followed by the single Tatoeba kimi to boku (For example, you and I), the second album Non-fiction and the compilation Complete Collection 2001-2004. Then, because of Bansaku’s disappearance, occurred some month before, the band suspended their own activities on 2012, for reprising it as duo on 2015. They started this new musical phase, maturer than before, releasing the third album Planetary Secret (reviewed here), followed by the singles Girl, An Eternity and Flower of Romance (these last ones are reviewed here).\n\nAn Eternity represents their musical change for sure, as the theme is more atmospheric and fascinating, accompained by melting vocals and a compelling guitar; the song is about the sense of human life.\n\nBaroque is a band which went through a lot of obstacles and turns, but despite everything they are always appealing and unpredictable. Evolving from their oshare kei roots, the band arrived to an unexpected and awesome maturation, going from simply and funny tracks to more complex and enigmatic componiments. They are the symbol of how the time can maintain and reinvent a style, when needed and for sure they are a must for whoever is in the visual kei scene and not only. If you already are into the magical and mysterious world of Baroque, you should check out their latest work, the single You, come out on December, whose wintery atmosphere is fit for these cold days we are living now. So, if you don’t know what band you want to know more, Baroque is a really good choice, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nWho might enjoy: who is looking for a versatile and unique rock band, whose story is full of twists and new directions.\n\nRecommended songs: ila., Nutty a Hermit., Exit, Kizuna, Tatoeba kimi to boku, Celebrate and An Eternity.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new song analysis in “Lyrical Love”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nColorful Life\n\nHere I am with a new review in “Throwback Thursday”! Today’s subject is another release by the band Baroque, but this time we go back to their early phase with their first full album Sug Life, come out on 1st September 2004. The concept of this album is the thousand colours which compose each aspect of human life. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Intro: the album starts with a short interlude, in a fleble melody which grows, adding each time a new element, like guitar, drums and some electronic beat.\n\n-Style [distance between two people]: this song starts with a fast guitar and a steady rhythm, leading up to an energetic and flowing theme; Ryo’s voice is whispered and quite mature for such track, accompained by good guitar lines, which enrich the melody of this good tune. —> 9/10\n\n-Gariron [mixture of colours and sounds]: the lead-track of the fifth single is opened by fast beats, with clear notes animating the simple theme, wrapped by a rapid rhythm; the vocals are steady and balanced, fitting with the whole melody, in a catchy and enjoyable track. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Wai (Distorted) [distorted life]: the final song of the mentioned single sees an electronic presence, with Ryo’s rapped vocals accompained by DJ parts leading up to an energetic and rebel theme, driven by the guitar and piercing vocals, for a quite nice song. —> 9/10\n\n-Rump: another short interlude, featuring a deep beat in background, which is joined by a soft and melancholic guitar and electronic effects.\n\n-Hito no iro (People’s colour) [shades of each one]: this slower song starts with a light, but pretty articulated guitar; Ryo’s voice is shaded and intense, driving up a melodious and tender theme, for a suggestive ballad, well driven by the instruments. —> 9/10\n\n-Exit [going out from the darkness]: another melodious track, driven by a warm guitar in an articulated theme, enriched by a fleble drumming; the vocals are suggestive and well managed in a really fascinating vocal interpretation, for a powerful and really nostalgical ballad, where the guitar’s presence can be noticed for sure. —> 9.5/10\n\n-ila. [waiting for the future]: the lead-track of the fourth single is introduced by a soft guitar in a steady rhythm, accompained by beats, in a cheerful and positive theme, really pleasant to listen to, even thanks to the balanced mature vocals and to the nostalgical vibe. —> 9/10\n\n-Bug: another short interlude, coming from the seventh single, features fast notes, along with a relevant beat, in a crystalline melody.\n\n-Nutty a Hermit. [each day brings a new story]: the lead-track of the seventh single is opened by an articulated drumming, accompained by clear notes; the vocals are whispered but fast, which slowly increase, even staying in the simple and flowing theme; a good song, which slowly grows and entertains. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Sound of Respire [breath as sound of life]: this song starts with the classical guitar, along with an intense rhythm and the electric guitar joining in gradually; Ryo’s voice is soft, with some spoken part, for an enjoyable tune. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Caramel Drops [sweetness and warmth]: a soft melody kicks off this song, driven by the guitar and the drums; the vocals are sweet and balanced, with clear notes keeping up this rhythmed song, which hides a melancholic shade, well rendered by the vocal interpretation and the instrumental work. —> 9/10\n\n-Graphic Noise [giving a shape to the music]: a fast and freaking beat opens this song, animated and fast, with nice vocals and a balanced rhythm, building up a rapid and articulated theme, thanks to the beats and the aggressive notes, but anyway efficient and pleasant. —> 9/10\n\n-Outro: the album ends with another short track, featuring a growing sound, fleble like the wind, in an atmospheric ending for the release.\n\nFinal Vote —> 9/10\n\nBaroque had a beginning in the shadows, with a mini-album and few singles accompaining them, which unveiled a precise image for them. Sug Life represents the confirmation of this image, in particularly of the fact that they gave the basis for the funniest side of visual kei, despite they have some feature from it. The album unites the energy and the positive soul of Baroque’s music with a mature shade, which makes each theme more unpredictable than expected. Despite the incredible background they have brought in three years, the band would have suffered the pain of disbandment, because of the bassist Bansaku and Akira’s health, but at least we have still them nowadays, even if after a troubling phase. An album for who wants to feel the true essence of Baroque’s music, positive and energetic as few.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a band special in “Focusing on”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nEternal Romance\n\nHere I am with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”! Today’s subject are two singles by the visual kei duo Baroque, respectively the fourteenth, An Eternity, and the fifteenth, Flower of Romance, both released on 24th July 2018. The songs deal with two different but linked concepts; the first one is about the sense of life itself, while the second is about the love, represented by a flower. And now… let’s review!\n\nAN ETERNITY\n\n-An Eternity: the first song starts with a growing melody, driven by a soft piano playing and an elevate guitar, which grows and domains the whole theme; the vocals are deep and light at the same time, flowing well in the melody, for a complex and strongly melodic track, a really refined ballad, as few in the genre. —> 9.5/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 9.5/10\n\nFLOWER OF ROMANCE\n\n-Flower of Romance: the second song starts with a steady rhythm, driven by a dynamic and sinuous guitar; vocals are darker, but anyway intense and pleasant, flowing in a simple, but well refined theme, for a compelling and energetic song, empowered by the guitar’s work. —> 9.5/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 9.5/10\n\nFollowing up two years of hiatus since 2013, Baroque comes back with a smaller line-up, but with greater ambitions. Their new and renewed path starts with the album Planetary Secret, followed by several singles, including the ones reviewed here. In these two songs we see two different but strictly linked sides of their music, the complex and atmospheric melody opposed to a catchy but anyway refined one, in a mix which can surely summarize Baroque’s current style. These two singles are a certain confirmation of this duo’s unique talent, which always delivers, despite everything; so you shouldn’t miss them. Two singles for who is addicted to Baroque’s new music or wants to experience a new and intriguing band.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new review in “Throwback Thursday”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nBest of… October/November 2018\n\nHello guys, I know that is weird to see this post only now, but it was queued after all the previous ones you have seen here, so I decided to put it out anyway, but in a double format, so here we will cover the charts of October and November 2018, while December is made directly in the Album Selection of the past year. And now… let’s start the countdown!\n\nOCTOBER\n\n5) Zonbi - We are Zonbi!!/Kurenai [Crimson red] (24.10.2018)\n\nThe young and freaking visual band shakes the things up with a new single, featuring two different and really interesting lead songs.\n\nWhy they are here: The Halloween single of this band is composed by two tracks; the first one is a pure and all-rounded exaltation of their extravagant concept, a well made one, while the second is a cover of one of the most famous songs by X Japan, here revisited in a macabre but really efficient style; this single definitely puts Zonbi under the spotlight.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nWe are Zonbi!!\n\nKurenai\n\n4) Diaura - Malice (24.10.2018)\n\nAfter almost one year, Diaura gets back to their own roots with a new and energetic single.\n\nWhy they are here: Following the short old-school phase (Unmei Kaika), Diaura reprise their own path with a strong and dark single, built on engaging tones and dynamic rhythms, showing how the band has never lost their own appeal.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nMalice\n\nResonance\n\nHuman Noise\n\n3) The Thirteen - Lament (24.10.2018)\n\nThe visual metal duo continues their brilliant career with the third EP, being always better and better.\n\nWhy they are here: In each their release, Mao and Mizuki have always brought forward an obscure and provoking image, making each song more pleasant than ever; in Lament, which sees the presence of musicians, like Kazu from Gibkiy Gibkiy Gibkiy and the former Awoi drummer Ryo, we see a major emphasis of the aggressive side of their sound, but unexpectedly united with a poetic shade, compared to a more adrenalinic work, as seen in Urge, confirming the duo’s unique and versatile talent.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nAngelic Grief\n\nRhapsody in Blue\n\nLament\n\nThe Depths of Despair\n\nErode\n\nUmbrella\n\n2) Mai Yajima - Vampiress (17.10.2018)\n\nThe young gothic-metal singer finally releases her first full album, after four years of career.\n\nWhy she is here: An album made of powerful and really fascinating sonorities, driven by Mai’s charismatic voice and an instrumental work worth of respect, bringing life to a really incredible product, which will get more people close to this rising star of the Japanese metal scene.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nHakoniwa (Box garden)\n\nVelvet Rose\n\nInferno\n\nSecond Dead\n\nSenkou no Overlord (Modern overlord)\n\nStargazer\n\nChi no kyouen (Blood feast)\n\nAoiro shinju (Blue pearl)\n\nRequiem of Silence\n\nLunatic Isolation\n\nTwilight\n\n1) Madmans Esprit - Conscientization of Unconsciousness (01.10.2018) *already reviewed by me*\n\nThe best release of October 2018 is, surprisingly, not Japanese, even if they seem to be; the South-Korean metal band Madmans Esprit releases their second album, the first work of their coming out worldwide.\n\nWhy they are here: Even not being Japanese, this band has a strong link, in terms of style and sound, with the rock scene of the Rising Sun (not by case they recently signed under Gan-shin Records, the German label which has always promoted visual kei bands in the West); the genre they propose is a complex metal, made by dark and chilling tones, unpredictable and thrilling vocals and compelling compositions; this album is a bold and dim product and it hints that we will hear more from Madmans Esprit.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nEine alte dunkelheit (An old darkness)\n\nFrom the Nothingness\n\nParade of Extinction\n\nI Planted You\n\nIncompleteness\n\nLife, Thus Pain\n\nFalling Star\n\nDrowning and Burning, Empty\n\nBall of the Devils\n\nYou Don’t Allow Me\n\nA Day in Black\n\nI’m Horrified by the Thoughts of Losing You\n\nGyedan (Stairs)\n\nNOVEMBER\n\n5) Trnty D:Code - [HELL]hound. (28.11.2018)\n\nThe young visual band delivers the second single, becoming more suggestive and interesting than expected.\n\nWhy they are here: This band’s line-up is made by members of the unlucky band Killaneth, which they share some musical element with; in fact their sound is adrenalinic and well managed, with rap influenced which are well fit in the respective melodies; another good rookie from the visual kei scene.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nHELL[hound].\n\ninside.\n\nsteep.\n\ngone.\n\n4) D - Deadly Sin (14.11.2018)\n\nD goes on with their new and fresh path, releasing a new single, five months after the fascinating Revive.\n\nWhy they are here: This band continues to surprise with the several influences they have in each work and this time they choose to make a relevant use of electronic notes, well fit in the energetic melodies, driven by Asagi’s powerful voice; it’s impossible to not love D.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nDeadly Sin\n\nStar Sapphire\n\nThe Secret Rose Garden\n\nBlood War -Instrumental-\n\n3) Razor - Knot Invisible (14.11.2018)\n\nOne of the most succesful visual bands of the recent years releases a new and interesting mini-album.\n\nWhy they are here: Razor doesn’t change their energetic and pounding style at all in this mini-album, in powerful and freaking themes driven by Ryoga’s unique charisma, in an intense and balanced product, enriched by some technical feat, confiriming the great impact of this band in the scene.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nKnot Invisible\n\nNamari (Lead)\n\nKeiai naru kimi e (To the honorable you)\n\nDisclosure\n\nError Brain\n\n2) Dexcore - Brain Washing (14.11.2018)\n\nThis new band, featuring as drummer the former Deathgaze member Naoki, is growing more and more, releasing the fourth single.\n\nWhy they are here: A young band, but with really clear ideas, at least as showed in the previous singles, and in this latest work, they make a relevant turn musically, introducing a major dynamicity in the rhythms and in the vocal interpretation; Dexcore are really promising and can really go on and on.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nBrain Washing\n\nHEY!! Cockroaches.\n\nNaked\n\n1) [Alexandros] - Sleepless in Brooklyn (21.11.2018)\n\nThe best release of November is the latest effort by the alternative rock band [Alexandros], their eighth full work.\n\nWhy they are here: The most important feature of this album is the incredible variety seen inside it, alternating catchy and soft themes with maturer and peculiar compositions, accompained by a distinctive technique and versatile vocals, in a release which shouldn’t be missed.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nLast Minute\n\nArpeggio\n\nMosquito Bite\n\nI Don’t Believe in You\n\nHana uta (Flower song) -ft.

See you with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nFaith or Submission?\n\nHere I am with a new song analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual kei band Angelo, precisely Faith, released as lead-track and second song of the same name album, come out on 27th November 2013. This song is strictly linked to the band’s concept, mixing up an energetic and obscure melody with a deep and provoking subject, which makes reflecting.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nThe fast drumming opens the song, along with a really dynamic guitar, leading up to an energetic and fast theme, empowered by aggressive notes; Kirito’s voice is really chilling and psychedelic, making the song more extreme than expected and despite that, it goes on easily and the structure is really simple and enjoyable, even thanks to a certain technique.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nKawaita hoho o shitataru shizuku kunda tenohira\n\nFukai dōkō no oku ni hikaru asenai kibō.\n\nFaisu… todoku no ka sō shite ireba\n\nRerīfu… ugokazu ni machi tsudzuketa\n\nTsukiageru dōkoku no mama ni yagate deaeru to shinjita\n\nHikari kou sono yubisaki ni kuruoshiku motometa kyūsai\n\nHijōna made tsukihanasa re ame ni nureru\n\nKanda kuchibiru soredemo mada inori tomezu.\n\nFaisu… mieru no ka hizamazukeba?\n\nDivine… shinario wa kawaranai mama\n\nWakiagaru gimon o fūji mukuwa reru koto o shinjita\n\nYurushi kou furueru kata o mitsumeru dakedatta ano toki.\n\nFōru out… ki no sumu made inori o\n\nDisobey… ushirosugata kono-me ni yakitsuketa.\n\nKanpekina baransu no moto kurikaesa reru kanashimi\n\nHaguruma o hitotsu kowasou modorenai taizai o daite.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nDrops fall from thirsty cheeks, through the palm\n\nShining deep in the pupils, with the hope of not fading.\n\nFaith… it will come if I engage myself\n\nRelief… I continued to wait without moving (I)\n\nI trust that soon we will find ourselves to outburst our wailing\n\nI asked for salvation, madly praying with the light between the fingers\n\nCruelly thrown away, wet by the rain\n\nWith bitten lips, but still without stopping the prayer. (II)\n\nFaith… see or bow?\n\nDivine… the scenery is unaltered\n\nI believed that the doubt would raise up sealed and rewarded\n\nAt that time I asked for forgiveness, looking for a trembling shoulder. (III)\n\nFall out… a prayer for calming the spirit\n\nDisobey… a retreated figure is impressed to the sight\n\nRepeated sadness, origin of a perfect balance\n\nBreak one of the gears, embracing the returned deadly sin. (IV)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Kirito, the song takes a theme directly from Angelo’s concept, unveiling it in all the possible aspects, with a quite simple layout, made by piercing and efficient lines. The subject of the song is indeed the faith, explained as an image which drives a thought, a culture or an ideology, a definition used for explaining the album where this song has been released. The text raises up a fundamental question: how it can be used? Faith is, at one hand, a pure and selfless thing, an act of belief despite everything, but at the other side, it can be used as a device of control and oppression, as the past (and current) history has learnt us. The protagonist finds himself to question the meaning of the faith itself, relying on his prayer, waiting for an answer that might come or not. And now… let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the image of tears falling from thirsty cheeks, thirsty because of the many drops fallen, going through the hand’s palm (Kawaita hoho o shitataru shizuku kunda tenohira), shining deeply in the pupils, hoping to not fade away (Fukai dōkō no oku ni hikaru asenai kibō); the protagonist reflects on the faith, which will appear only if he will behave (Faisu… todoku no ka sō shite ireba, note that the word “faith”, like all the English terms seen here, is written in katakana, as for maintaining a sort of proximity with the text), and this brings him relief, so that he will wait its arrival without moving (Rerīfu… ugokazu ni machi tsudzuketa).\n\nII) He trusts that soon everybody can let out their wailing (Tsukiageru dōkoku no mama ni yagate deaeru to shinjita), while he asks for salvation, praying madly with the light in his hands (Hikari kou sono yubisaki ni kuruoshiku motometa kyūsai); he is thrown away with cruelty, gets wet by the rain, bites his own lips, but despite everything, he won’t stop his prayer (Hijōna made tsukihanasa re ame ni nureru/Kanda kuchibiru soredemo mada inori tomezu).\n\nIII) He wonders what is the true sense of faith, whether is seeing something concealed by the reason or being submitted to a more powerful authority, the core contrast of the whole text (mieru no ka hizamazukeba?) and seeing the divine, notice that the reality is always the same, pointing the faith towards its darkest side (Divine… shinario wa kawaranai mama); he believed that the doubt would raise up sealed in its darkness and rewarded for being opened to the faith (Wakiagaru gimon o fūji mukuwa reru koto o shinjita), so at that time he asked for forgiveness, because he looked for someone’s else shoulder, instead of looking inside himself (Yurushi kou furueru kata o mitsumeru dakedatta ano toki).\n\nIV) He feels like he is falling out and thinks that a prayer can calm his own spirit (Fōru out - ki no sumu made inori o) and aware that such in a way he disobeyed, a figure is imprinted in his sight, haunting him (Disobey… ushirosugata kono-me ni yakitsuketa); this unveils the core of the whole text, a sadness which is repeated every day, in order to reach a perfect “balance” (Kanpekina baransu no moto kurikaesa reru kanashimi), and if one of the gears of this system gets broken, the deadly sin, a metaphor for punishment, will return to the offender (Haguruma o hitotsu kowasou modorenai taizai o daite), ending the text in a dark way.\n\nWhat is faith really? An unconditioned devotion, whose goal is reaching a perfect comprehension of life itself, or a medium which the oppressors use for annihilating any individual thought? Angelo touch their own concept with a deep and contained composition, made of darkness and a bit of light, in contrast like everything in our world.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with the old chart of October and November 2018!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nAngelo - The Rebirth of the Creature\n\ndrkreviews:\n\nHere I am with the week-end band review in “Focusing on”! Today’s subject is band, born from the ashes of another relevant project and maintained their fascination throughout the years. They’re Angelo, formed on 2006 and composed by Kirito (vo.), the famous vocalist of the band Pierrot, Giru (gt.), former guitarist of the band Vidoll, Karyu (gt.), former member of D’espairsRay, who both joined the band on 2011, Kohta (ba.) and Takeo (dr.), both from Pierrot. The name comes up from the Christian figure and it indicates the concept of a reborn creature, which means that Angelo are a new version of Pierrot (in fact it maintains some features from them, such as the dark and suggestive vibes given by most songs); along with this prosecution of style, Angelo has a strong spiritual vibe, put into all their songs, and also a little psychological component. Their music reprises much the Pierrot’s one, but adding new and interesting influences. Their debut occurs on November 2006 with the single Reborn, followed by the single Winter Moon, the album Rebirth of a Newborn Baby (already reviewed by me) and the mini-album Freak Show (reviewed here).\n\nThe main-track, He is a Monkey, has a biting rock sound, really attractive and unique in its genre, which is one of the strongest features of this band; the song is about our world, invaded by false ideals and fake doctrines. It has been followed by the singles Chaotic Bell Sister and Usubeni no kakera (Piece of red thin), the album Metallic Butterfly and the singles Hikari no kioku (Light’s memory) and El Dorado.\n\nThe title-track, famous for being the ending of the second season of Sengoku Basara, has a more energetic and catchy, suitable as anime theme; the song is about ancestors’ sins, which remain carved also into the descendants. It has been followed by the single Fate, the albums Design (reviewed here) and Babel and the single Calvary.\n\nThe title-track has a metal sound which has its roots on darker atmospheres, with a peculiar touch of electronic; the song is about having a bit of hope in a hard life. It has been followed by the single Rip/Moment, the album Retina, the single Outbreak and the album Faith.\n\nThe title-track has a more psychedelic and suggestive vibe, reminding more Pierrot than they could ever done in a song; the song is about the image of prayer as an unrealized hope. It has been followed by the single Scare and the album Psyche.\n\nIn conclusion, Angelo continued the majestic work started by Pierrot, but adding more depth and spirituality compared to the obscure and unpredictable world of the famous old-school band. The new elements has been added by the members who joined on 2011, who came from two important bands, Vidoll and D’espairsRay, so they improved a lot Angelo’s music. And this can be seen on their latest release, the EP Factor, released on 30th September 2015, which will be followed by another one, Result, expected on December 2015.\n\nWho might enjoy: who loved Pierrot and needs them with a bit of maturity.\n\nRecommended songs: Reborn, He is a Monkey, El Dorado, Feather, Calvary, Ruthless Reward and Faith.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you on Tuesday with another lyrical analysis on “Lyrical Love”!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n*Sorry for the delay*\n\n*REBLOG + UPDATE*\n\nFollowing up the mentioned EPs Factor and Result, the band continued their career releasing the albums Cord, Heterodox and Resonance (reviewed here).\n\nDesign of Existence\n\nHere I am with a new review in “Throwback Thursday”! Today’s subject is always related to the visual kei band Angelo, but this time we will go back to the past, precisely reviewing their third album Design, come out on 06th October 2010. The album’s concept is strictly linked to the band’s spiritual side, using as image of existence as a design made day after day. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Blind Light [looking for the light]: the album opens with a song, featuring a fast rhythm and an energetic guitar; the vocals are quite balanced and, along the drums, animate a really simple and flowing track, for a quite pleasant song, even thanks to the guitar work. —> 8.5/10\n\n-El Dorado [going towards a bright future]: the lead-track of the seventh single, famous as ending theme of Sengoku Basara II, is opened by a really powerful guitar, followed by Kirito’s soft and animated vocals, for a catchy and melodious song. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Noise [voice which guides the existence]: clear vocals kick off this song, featuring a steady rhythm and a clear-toned guitar, which keep up pretty well this enjoyable and positive rock track, with a good instrumental work. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Design of Infinite Circle [divine design]: this song is opened by an electronic melody, leading up to an aggressive rhythm, driven by a piercing guitar which makes the theme more energetic than expected; Kirito’s voice is quite electronic, well accompained by the bass, taking even stronger shades, for a song which raises the album’s level. —> 9/10\n\n-Hikari no kioku (Memory of light) [memories bringing to the future]: the lead track of the sixth single, known for being the ending of Tegami Bachi, is opened by Kirito’s melodious vocals, accompained by a suave violin, leading up to a bright melody, emphasized by the classical guitar; the theme is slow and fascinating, for a really powerful ballad, with one of the best guitar solos ever heard in Angelo’s repertory. —> 9.5/10\n\n-Speak to Deep Colors [love colors]: the b-side track of the seventh single is kicked off by an articulated guitar, leading to a light but well rhythmed theme; the vocals are really limpid, keeping up the whole melody, in a pleasant and pretty nostalgical song. —> 9/10\n\n-Fate [fate made by our actions]: another b-side, this time from the sixth single, is opened by a fast drumming, along with a dynamic guitar and flowing vocals, in a light melody; the guitar is sinuous, wrapping up the melody, especially in the solo, showing the most powerful element of the song. —> 9/10\n\n-Eve [forgiveness, even in the hardest moments]: this song starts with a light guitar, with a romantic violin; the vocals are soft and deep, driving a structured and intense theme, in another compelling and powerful ballad, worth of this band’s talent. —> 9.5/10\n\n-Rasen (Spiral) [pain which always comes out]: soft notes kick off this song, with a simple rhythm and clear vocals animating the melody; then the theme evolves in an energetic way, even maintaining a soft and nostalgical vibe, even thanks to the well arranged guitar work. —> 9/10\n\n-Last Song [song for the loved one]: another b-side from the sixth single starts with Kirito’s light vocals, accompaining a simple and tender melody; the song’s structure is quite flowing and it fits the nostalgical atmosphere presented by the previous tracks, especially with the guitar’s presence. —> 9/10\n\n-Lotus Blossom [flying for being free]: the album ends with a song opened by slow notes and light vocals, accompained by a thin rhythm, which evolves gradually in something more relevant; the light and nostalgical vibe is still there, ending the album in a coherent style. —> 8.5/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 9/10\n\nOn 2006, after the dissolution of Pierrot, Kirito took his own initiative for forming a brand-new project, which would have taken inspiration from his previous works, but at the same time would have developed an own path, including musicians from other famous bands. So Angelo started to bring out intense musical works, as in Rebirth of a Newborn Baby, along with energetic themes, like in Freak Show, reaching a solid base with Design. The album is a perfect commistion of the suggestive and the energetic component, helped by the addiction of two new guitarists (who would have been confirmed only the following year), which allowed them to become even more popular than expected and not by case, in this release there are two anime themes, a rare thing for a visual kei band in these times. So after only four years, Angelo found their own balance with their third full work and since that moment, everything was better and better for them. An album for who likes each aspect of Angelo’s music, without any distinction.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new special in “Focusing on”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nResonating Music\n\nHere I am with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”! Today’s subject is the latest release by the Japanese band Angelo, precisely the tenth album Resonance, come out on 14th November 2018. The concept of this release is the resonance which their music brings up, with chilling themes and peculiar atmospheres. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Activate Resonate: the album starts with a song featuring a steady rhythm and relevant electronic effects; Kirito’s clear voice accompains the theme, fast and pounding, for a good and flowing opening song, easy to listen. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Crevasse: the lead-track of the album is opened by a dark intro, leading to a more aggressive theme; the vocals are piercing, in a fast and animated rhythm, for another paced and quite good song. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Zankyou (Reverb): an incisive guitar opens another fast-paced song, with an energetic rhythm, where the vocals are more flowing, keeping up a well structured song, empowered by a good guitar work and an unpredictable electronic component. —> 9/10\n\n-New Century Birth Voice: this song is opened by a piercing guitar, accompained by a fast rhythm in a steady and strongly electronic theme; Kirito’s voice is more aggressive and metallic, driving a catchy and really flowing melody, for another good track. —> 9/10\n\n-Reunion: a strong guitar and a deep bass open this song, featuring a really peculiar but intense melody; the vocals are clear and flowing, keeping a light theme, but with relevant shades, making this song more interesting. —> 9/10\n\n-Hologram: the classical guitar introduces this song in a melancholic way, where Kirito’s voice starts clear and light, becoming more intense throughout the song; then the theme becomes more rhythmed, but it stays in a slow pace, for a melting ballad, well executed, especially in the guitar solo. —> 9.5/10\n\n-Keikyou no toge (Rose thorns): a steady drumming, with subtle notes brought by the bass, introduce this song, with balanced vocals, shaded at the right level, which becomes stronger along with the theme itself, in a quite compelling song. —> 9/10\n\n-Breath: this song is kicked off by the bass and the guitar, which together open the theme with clear notes, maintaining the right energy seen in this release; Kirito shows off fast and steady vocals, keeping up a simple melody, dyed with a nostalgical atmosphere. —> 9/10\n\n-Deep Vision: a dim intro opens this track, accompained by a crystalline piano and a crescent beat, leading up to an aggressive and well rhythmed theme, where the guitar is well intertwined in the melody; Kirito’s voice is clear, with a nostalgical shade, like in the previous track. —> 9/10\n\n-Cruel World: the album ends with a song introduced by a peculiar melody, leading up to an energetic theme, sustained by the instruments; the vocals are pretty flowing, driven by a balanced rhythm, in a quite structured melody, for a pleasant ending track. —> 9/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 9/10\n\nOne year after their latest work, Heterodox, Angelo gets back to the scene with a release which doesn’t betray at all their own style. Resonance does literally what it says, built up by compelling themes, some more refined than others, but all of them fulfilled by a great energy and a peculiar technique, one of the most important features of this band’s sound. Probably the experience of each member makes their sound never boring at all, making Angelo more interesting than what it seems, despite their presumibily formulaic approach. Now, after being satisfied with this album, we can only wait for more good work by them. An album for who missed Angelo’s music and needs some unique energy in his/her playlist.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new review in “Throwback Thursday”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nBest Moment\n\nHere I am with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”! Today’s subject is the debut work of the band Unmei Kousaten, precisely the single Saikou no shunkan (Best moment), released on 19th October 2018. This band has formed last summer and is composed by Sono (vo.), the famous singer of Matenrou Opera, Rex (gt.), Shoko (key.), from Sonicscape, Toshi (ba.), former member of Femme Fatale and Yuki (dr.), drummer of bands like Versailles and Jupiter. And now… let’s review!\n\n-Tokyo: the single starts with soft notes, accompained by a warm vocalism which puts the listener in the right mood, opening the release in a nice manner. —> 8.5/10\n\n-Saikou no shunkan: a living drumming and clear vocals kick off this song, in a jazzy theme, empowered by an energetic and dynamic guitar; Sono’s voice is steady and intense, keeping up a light and pleasant track, where the guitar is relevant in the whole melody. —> 9.5/10\n\n-Namae mo shiranai whiskey (Whiskey which I neither know the name of): this song is opened by a soft guitar, leading up to a simple and enjoyable theme; the vocals are more dynamic and seducing, well accompained by the guitar, in a sensual and passionate vocal interpretation, in a really awesome and various song. —> 9.5/10\n\n-15sai no boku wo (Me at fifteen years old): the single ends with a more rocking song, in a steady and fast rhythm, accompained by a good guitar and a soft piano; the vocals are clear and quite animated, keeping up this catchy and cheerful song. —> 9/10\n\nFinal Vote —> 9/10\n\nSono is one of the several visual kei musicians who decided to get in his own, despite their band’s activity, for experiencing new shades and sonorities which they couldn’t achieve. Unmei Kousaten is his solo project, made of distinctive musicians and oriented towards a genre which is quite far from Matenrou Opera’s epic themes (even if not so new, as the mentioned band already experimented a jazz-rock style in the album Chikyuu). Their debut single shows a certain freshness and ease in developing each track, where the vocals, warm and intense, intertwine well with the instruments, building passionate and technical melodies all at once. So, even if the name and the style are different, the quality is still there and Sono is the representer of this good work. A single for who loves Sono’s voice and jazzy-rock bands with a touch of sensuality.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nHidden Nature\n\nHere I am with a new song analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the Japanese band Sads, precisely one of their oldest themes, Masquerade, released as lead-track of their ninth single with the same name on 28th May 2003. This song characterizes them in a particular way, as it is one of the few not heavy songs, a gloomy and intense ballad, whose topic is struggling and emotional.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nA warm guitar opens the song, in a slow and articulated theme, where the rhythm is relevant and the atmosphere pretty melancholic; Kiyoharu shows off melting and intense notes, bringing out a passionate and powerful vocal interpretation, which builds up this ballad, powerful and well structured by the instruments, especially by the combination between guitar and bass, a technical feat hard to be missed.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nAware sawo sorrow sashikae masukareido masukareido\n\nkawaira shii kun sae mie naiyo masukareido.\n\nSaa atarashi i shoku de yorokobi wo arawashi te\n\numare kawa ruyousa kairaku saikou no masukareido.\n\nSouzou hakasukani hazuretagurai machikoga reteta risou.\n\nWasure rareruyo itami wo iyadatta yoru wo\n\nharuka kanata hekitto…\n\nwasure rareruyo kanashi i kioku wo kodoku wo saki midare ta meiro.\n\nYeah masukareido, yeah masukareido\n\nyeah kyou kara, yeah sayonara\n\nTsukuriage teta nichijou wo me wo toji te keshi satte.\n\nWasure rareruyo itami wo iyada tta yoru wo\n\nharuka kanata hakitto…\n\nwasure rareruyo mise takunai kako wo kizu wo\n\nraku ninareru toki wo, toki wo…\n\nYeah masukareido, yeah masukareido\n\nyeah kurue sou, yeah sayonara\n\nYeah kowaku naiyo, yeah korekara\n\nyeah itoshi teruyo, yeah masukareido\n\nSou, kitto sou, kitto sou, kitto\n\nharuka kanata hekitto… raku ninareru toki wo…\n\nsaki midare ta meiro\n\nraku ninareru toki wo… toki wo saki midare ta… saki midare ta…\n\nsaki midare ta meiro.\n\nOh yeah sayonara, yeah sayonara\n\nyeah sayonara, yeah masukareido\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nPity is a replacement for sorrow, masquerade, masquerade\n\nYou don’t seem lovely, masquerade.\n\nCome on, show the pleasure in a new colour\n\nRebirth for pleasure, the greatest masquerade.\n\nVague imagination, as if disconnected, a longing ideal. (I)\n\nA pain which is forgotten, it was an unpleasant night\n\nIn a definitely far direction…\n\nA sad memory of loneliness which is forgotten, bloomed in a maze.\n\nYeah, masquerade, yeah, masquerade\n\nYeah, from today, yeah, goodbye (II)\n\nMy complete routine, closing the eyes and leaving everything behind.\n\nA pain which is forgotten, it was an unpleasant night\n\nIn a definitely far direction…\n\nAn unrevelaed past which is forgotten, a wound\n\nOne moment for getting me accustomed to peace, one moment…\n\nYeah, masquerade, yeah, masquerade\n\nYeah, an obsession, yeah, masquerade\n\nYeah, scary, yeah, from now on\n\nYeah, I love you, yeah, masquerade (III)\n\nSo for sure, for sure, for sure\n\nIn a definitely far direction… one moment for getting me accustomed to peace…\n\nA bloomed maze\n\nOne moment for getting me accustomed to peace… a bloomed moment… bloomed…\n\nA bloomed maze.\n\nOh yeah, goodbye, yeah, goodbye\n\nYeah, goodbye, yeah, masquerade (IV)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Kiyoharu, this song features a quite simple layout, with short but really efficient lines, enriched by a peculiar use of some word as metaphors which will be explained here. As by the title, the song deals with a masquerade, synonym of appearing in a specific way only for attracting someone’s interest, hiding the true self behind, indeed, a mask. The protagonist has come out from a relationship which brought him pain and despair, feelings that he wants to erase going straight in his own life, even if it is incredibly hard, as the other person has a powerful influence on him and on his mind. And now… let’s analyze the song!\n\nI)The text starts with the protagonist, which sees his pity as a replacement for his own sorrow, caused by the masquerade (Aware sawo sorrow sashikae masukareido masukareido), which shows that his loved one is not so lovely as expected (kawaira shii kun sae mie naiyo masukareido); so he asks her to show the pleasure in a new colour, different from reality (Saa atarashii shoku de yorokobi wo arawashi te), as a proof that she has reborn only for pleasing him, an attitude which he considers as the greatest masquerade (umarekawaru you sa kairaku saikou no masukareido, the verb “umarekawaru” means “to be born again”, but it can be translated also as the noun “metamorphosis“), representing a vague imagination, disconnected from reality, a desired ideal which can’t be obtained (Souzou hakasukani hazuretagurai machikoga reteta risou).\n\nII) The protagonist tries to forget his own pain, coming from an unpleasant night, going in a far direction (Wasure rareruyo itami wo iyadatta yoru wo/haruka kanata hekitto…) and to erase a sad memory of loneliness, bloomed in a maze, symbol of mind (wasure rareruyo kanashi i kioku wo kodoku wo saki midare ta meiro); finally he says goodbye to the masquerade and not by case this part is written half in English and half in Japanese.\n\nIII) His daily routine allows him to close his eyes and to leave everything behind (Tsukuriage teta nichijou wo me wo toji te keshi satte); then the first line of the previous sequence is repeated, but this time he wants to erase a unrevealed past, because of the mask, which has left a wound in him and he asks for one moment for getting accustomed to his own peace (wasure rareruyo mise takunai kako wo kizu wo/raku ninareru toki wo, toki wo…), as, despite everything, the masquerade is obsessing him in a scary way, revoking his love feeling.\n\nIV) Now his belief starts to waver and he repeates himself that is sure of his own choices (Sou, kitto sou, kitto sou, kitto) and while he tries to get far from that sad memory, the masquerade haunts him, while he wants to be in peace, but finally he chooses to leave the masquerade forever, saying goodbye to it for the last time, going on his own life.\n\nPeople hide themselves in a mask only for appealing others and attracting them in their dark world, but when the trick is discovered, it’s hard to get out from it; Sads use a theatrical image for describing a common state of mankind, where the lies are more spreaded than the truth and the manipulation gets to beat out the purest people, becoming a true obsession.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!"
