It includes the singles \"Any Love\" and \"Royal Chocolate Flush\" as well as the J-Wave image song for Winter Campaign Holy December, Be in Love with J-Wave and \"To Be in Love\", the theme song to the Japanese release of the movie Bridge to Terabithia. The first pressing of the album was in a sleeve case packaging.\n\nThe album is certified gold for shipment of 100,000 copies.\n\nTitle\n\n[edit]\n\nThe title, Eighth World, was chosen because of the coincidence of the year of release and the number of the album. Moreover, with the Kanji for eight {八, hachi), resembling a folded fan spreading out, and the symbol for infinity, ∞, being similar to the number 8 turned on its side, the message conveyed in the title is that \"an infinite amount of happiness is spreading out in the eighth world of Misia\".[2]\n\nInformation\n\n[edit]\n\nWith her previous album, Ascension, focusing on the vast theme of \"life\" and \"birth\", Misia began production of Eighth World with the idea of incorporating this element in a more tangible way. The album has a more personal theme, with lyrics about relationships and the many scenarios she encountered in her homeland as well as in Kenya, where she visited the Kibera slum in Nairobi.[3] In an interview with MSN Music, she explained, \"Last spring, I visited Kenya and the reality of their conditions I saw in the slums was harsher than I had imagined. It made me think over a lot of things. It made me want to sing about \"real\" issues and with that in mind, one of the first songs I wrote right after was \"Any Love\".\"[3]\n\n\"Taiyō no Malaika\" was also written during her stay in Africa. A performance of the song was captured in a documentary of her visit. She explained the crowd's reaction, saying, \"The words are in Japanese, so naturally, I didn't think they would understand. However, as I sang, I saw the mothers crying as they listened. That's when I realized firsthand that music has no borders and transcends language.\" The song \"Ishin Denshin\", which was written by the essayist Mayumi Satō at Misia's request, speaks of this realization.[3]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nOricon sales chart\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease Chart Peak\n\nposition Debut\n\nsales Total\n\nsales Chart\n\nrun January 9, 2008 Oricon Daily Albums Chart 1 131,635 11 weeks Oricon Weekly Albums Chart 3 70,916 Oricon Monthly Albums Chart 12 Oricon Yearly Albums Chart 85\n\nPhysical sales charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart Peak\n\nposition Oricon Daily Albums Chart 1 Oricon Weekly Albums Chart 3 Oricon Monthly Albums Chart 12 Oricon Yearly Albums Chart 85 Billboard Japan TOP Albums 3 G-Music J-pop Chart[4] (Taiwan) 4 Five Music J-pop/K-pop Chart[5] (Taiwan) 5 Soundscan Albums Chart (CD-Only)[6] 2\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
