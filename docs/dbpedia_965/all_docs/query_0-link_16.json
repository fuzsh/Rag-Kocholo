        "text": "Did it for Japanese songs, now I’m doing it for ‘Western’ music.\n\nNot quite ‘English’ since there are quite a few tracks in other languages, plus a couple of instrumentals thrown…left off the classical pieces though.\n\nI started off aiming for a 1000 but by 800 or so I realized it wasn’t anywhere near enough to fit everything I wanted to so instead of agonizing over what to leave off, I went ahead and expanded it to 1500 songs\n\nThere was a brief desire to stick to one song per artist bar collabs/duets/OSTs but abandoned the idea cos that would mean a whole goddamn trove of great songs missing out\n\nUnapologetically mainstream tastes. I’m not a hipster snob\n\nNot gonna do breakdown stats for this but it should be fairly obvious that I’m a kid of the 90s. Luckily my family members are all into music in some form and shape so I had plenty of influences to absorb and genres to explore, though it took me a long time to get my head around things like folk, bluegrass and country\n\nIn the mid-90s my tastes were heavily influenced by radio – that would be Radio 4 in Malaysia, which happened to run episodes of The World Chart Show on weekends, which was my gateway to global contemporary hit music. The show was hosted by Adrienne ‘Ace’ Walker and Joe Cipriano back then and introduced me to a whole new world of rap, dance and alternative music\n\nI was never in step with my peers – when they were into Barbie dolls I was into Take That, when they were into Backstreet Boys and Spice Girls I had already moved on to Oasis and Radiohead. Thank the Lord that my older brother was into the same kind of music at the time, so we had a shared record collection & could clue each other in on the latest tunes. And he’s also pinched a copy of this playlist (and the Japanese one too) for himself now\n\nRoughly, my fads and phases: mid-90s = Britpop + chart music, late-90s to early-00s = Canto/Mandopop, Jpop, early to mid-00s = folk, country, acoustic singer-songwriter, mainstream rock, mid-00s to 2010 = Japanese indie, anisong, 2011-2014 = Kpop, 2014 onwards = moved back into Jpop, anisong & mainstream English-language music. You can tell there’s a pretty significant period of time where I barely listened to anything in English.\n\nNotable missing artists? Marvin Gaye, Aerosmith, Bruce Springsteen, Sex Pistols, Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly, Ray Charles, Prince, Ramones, Johnny Cash etc the list stretches on. The classics, I’ve still not had enough time to give them a real go.\n\nIf there was a track 1501 it would’ve been Warren Zevon’s Werewolves of London….sorry.\n\nTo listen to every second of every song would take 3 days 23 hours 22 minutes and 56 seconds.\n\nAgain, I tried to link to Youtube wherever possible but there are some with Spotify links (you’ll need an account for that) & an odd Soundcloud or two\n\n1. Crowded House – Don’t Dream It’s Over [1986]\n\n2. Ben Folds Five – Brick [1997]\n\n3. Eels – Susan’s House [1996]\n\n4. Depeche Mode – It’s No Good [1997]\n\n5. The Rolling Stones – Anybody Seen My Baby [1997]\n\n6. R.E.M. – Losing My Religion [1991]\n\n7. James – Sit Down [1989]\n\n8. Gin Blossoms – Til I Hear It From You [1995]\n\n9. Red Hot Chili Peppers – Scar Tissue [1999]\n\n10. Stars – Calendar Girl [2004]\n\nAll-time favourites, most of which were released when I was most heavily obsessed with music in my early teens.\n\nSusan’s House is a rather strange one for me – I remember vividly how I got hooked on the tune after seeing its music video on TV the year it was released. 1997 was also the year I first got dial-up Internet, and the first MP3 song I downloaded was Susan’s House.\n\nAlso quite strange to see that It’s No Good has gained a second wind after being featured in Aquaman, of all things..\n\n11. Sting – Russians [1985]\n\n12. Foo Fighters – Walking After You [1999]\n\n13. Savage Garden – To The Moon & Back [1996]\n\n14. Levellers – What A Beautiful Day [1997]\n\n15. New Order – True Faith ‘94 [1994]\n\n16. The Beatles – In My Life [1965]\n\n17. Super Furry Animals – Juxtapozed With U [2001]\n\n18. Massive Attack – Teardrop [1988]\n\n19. The Stone Roses – Fools Gold [1989]\n\n20. Heart – Alone [1987]\n\nAnd these are another 10 favourites. Russians was probably my first taste of political-charged lyrical content (and I was like…10 when I first heard it) and ‘Oppenheimer’s deadly toy’ is a phrase that has stuck in my mind to this day, to the point of being the name of my office wi-fi hotspot.\n\n21. Pulp – Disco 2000 [1995]\n\n22. Oasis – Live Forever [1994]\n\n23. Dodgy – Good Enough [1996]\n\n24. Ocean Colour Scene – Up on the Downside [2001]\n\n25. Blur – Country House [1995]\n\n26. The Bluetones – Marblehead Johnson [1996]\n\n27. Shed Seven – Chasing Rainbows [1998]\n\n28. Suede – Beautiful Ones [1996]\n\n29. The Boo Radleys – Wake Up Boo! [1995]\n\n30. Mansun – Wide Open Space [1996]\n\nBritpop. The love of me life.\n\n31. Tori Amos – Spark [1998]\n\n32. The Cranberries – Ode to My Family [1994]\n\n33. Bic Runga – Listening For the Weather [2002]\n\n34. Sophie B. Hawkins – As I Lay Me Down [1995]\n\n35. The Corrs – Runaway [1995]\n\n36. Jewel – Who Will Save Your Soul [1995]\n\n37. Shawn Colvin – Sunny Came Home [1996]\n\n38. Alanis Morisette – Head Over Feet [1995]\n\n39. Madonna – I’ll Remember [1994]\n\n40. Jann Arden – Insensitive [1994]\n\n41. Thirteen Senses – Gone [2004]\n\n42. Belle and Sebastian – We Rule the School [1996]\n\n43. Matthew Jay – You’re Always Going Too Soon [2001]\n\n44. Josh Rouse – My Love Has Gone [2005]\n\n45. Phil Campbell (White Buffalo) – Hope, Faith and You [1997]\n\n46. Witness – Freezing Over Morning [1999]\n\n47. Sigur Rós – Hoppípolla [2005]\n\n48. Ooberman – Shorley Wall [1998]\n\n49. Kings of Convenience – I’d Rather Dance With You [2004]\n\n50. Death Cab for Cutie – Title and Registration [2003]\n\nIt all seems so surreal to think that the only way I could ‘discover’ new/good bands was by reading magazine reviews and then taking chances on buying the albums without being entirely sure whether the music would suit my tastes. Sure ended up with a few stinkers along the way, but nothing beats the exhilarating feeling of stumbling across an amazing album track – almost impossible nowadays when everything gets uploaded on Youtube. Also discovered a lot of bands and songs through magazines’ free compilation discs – thanks Q, Select, Mojo and Word.\n\n51. Carpenters – Yesterday Once More [1973]\n\n52. Barbra Streisand – The Way We Were [1973]\n\n53. Janis Ian – At Seventeen [1975]\n\n54. Carly Simon – You’re So Vain [1972]\n\n55. Dusty Springfield – I Only Want to Be With You [1963]\n\n56. Carole King – It’s Too Late [1971]\n\n57. Joni Mitchell – Big Yellow Taxi [1970]\n\n58. Judy Collins – Send in the Clowns [1975]\n\n59. Skeeter Davis – The End of the World [1962]\n\n60. Kate Bush – Wuthering Heights [1978]\n\nListened to a classic pop tunes as well when I was a teenager – part parental influence, part listening to oldies on radio at night.\n\n61. Delerium – Silence (feat. Sarah McLachlan) [1999]\n\n62. Fatboy Slim – Rockafeller Skank [1998]\n\n63. Moby – Natural Blues [1999]\n\n64. Modjo – Lady (Hear Me Tonight) [2000]\n\n65. Spiller feat. Sophie Ellis-Bextor – Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love) [2000]\n\n66. Stereo MCs – Connected [1992]\n\n67. Crustation – Purple (w/ Bronagh Slevin) [1997]\n\n68. Rob D – Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino mix) [1995]\n\n69. Chemical Brothers – Block Rockin’ Beats [1997]\n\n70. Basement Jaxx – Red Alert [1999]\n\nI started to get into house/dance/Europop in the mid-90s alongside Britpop, all thanks to the Now! That’s What I Call Music [UK versions] compilation discs that I’d buy whenever my family took trips to Singapore.\n\n71. downhere – How Many Kings [2009]\n\n72. Delirious? – Deeper [1997]\n\n73. All Star United – La La Land [1997]\n\n74. DC Talk – What If I Stumble? [1995]\n\n75. FFH – Where You Are [2000]\n\n76. PFR – Forever [1997]\n\n77. Jars of Clay – Love Song for a Savior [1995]\n\n78. Casting Crowns – East to West [2007]\n\n79. Audio Adrenaline – This Day [1997]\n\n80. Natalie Grant – Clean [2015]\n\nContemporary Christian songs. I was brought up in a staunchly religious family so I used to listen to a lot of Christian music in my teenage years – didn’t find too many acts that catered to my tastes at the time though.\n\n81. Radiohead – Paranoid Android [1997]\n\n82. Garbage – Push It [1998]\n\n83. Muse – New Born [2001]\n\n84. The Cardigans – My Favourite Game [1998]\n\n85. The Killers – Somebody Told Me [2004]\n\n86. Arctic Monkeys – Mardy Bum [2006]\n\n87. The Dandy Warhols – Bohemian Like You [2000]\n\n88. Klaxons – Golden Skans [2007]\n\n89. Delays – Valentine [2006]\n\n90. Franz Ferdinand – Take Me Out [2004]\n\nBritpop started getting a little too cheerful for me at some point during my angsty teenage years and I yearned for something a bit more edgy, which is why Radiohead’s OK Computer was such a massive turning point for me. Oh, and even if Ed O’Brien denies any such creative intentions, Paranoid Android was definitely the Bohemian Rhapsody for my angry generation.\n\n91. U2 – One [1991]\n\n92. Teenage Fanclub – Tears [1995]\n\n93. Manic Street Preachers – Empty Souls [2005]\n\n94. Electronic – Vivid [1999]\n\n95. Pavement – Major Leagues [1999]\n\n96. Monaco – Happy Jack [1997]\n\n97.

Five For Fighting – Superman (It’s Not Easy) [2001]\n\n300. Firehouse – I Live My Life for You [1995]\n\nSomething for the Pain was the song I used to listen to whenever I was feeling emo – I was somewhat fixated on that ‘hanging from a hang-man’s noose’ line, morbidly enough I was only 10 when I was first addicted to the song…\n\n301. The Seahorses – Love Me and Leave Me [1997]\n\n302. Hurricane #1 – Step into My World [1997]\n\n303. McAlmont & Butler – Yes [1995]\n\n304. Lowgold – In Amber [2001]\n\n305.

The Clovers – Love Potion No.9 [1959]\n\nMy parents had a bootleg 10-disc box set of oldies that I plundered for myself when I was barely into my teens and that”s where I first got to listen to great songs like a lot of those here. Also rubbish like Itsy Bitsy Bikini whatever and How Much is that Doggie in the Window…\n\nBut my opinion of the Perez Prado song was forever ruined when my parents said ‘oh this is the song they use in strip shows’….\n\n361.

Rednex – Cotton Eye Joe [1994]\n\nCheese, novelty, ridiculous, overblown…that’s the name of these 10 songs. Don’t ask me why that Beastie Boys tune is still stuck in my mind after 20 years, it’s an awful song by all accounts.\n\n431. Five – When The Lights Go Out [1998]\n\n432.

B.B.E. – 7 Days and One Week [1996]\n\nie the ‘I’m off my head on drugs so anything sounds good’ trance/house mix. In hindsight, it seems amazing I was listening to these songs at 11-12 without any notion of their druggy connotations…of course the biggest headbanger is elsewhere on this list (Born Slippy, of course).\n\n501.

England Dan & John Ford Coley – I’d Really Love to See You Tonight [1976]\n\n540. Richard Marx – Now and Forever [1994]\n\nEven more cheesy ballads. I’m a sucker. But it’s strange to think how much more relevant the lyrics of Blessid Union of Soul’s I Believe are in our current climate. Timeless, I guess, is what they call songs like this.\n\n541. The Zutons – Railroad [2004]\n\n542. Razorlight – Somewhere Else [2005]\n\n543. Spoon – I Turn My Camera On [2005]\n\n544. The Ting Tings – That’s Not My Name [2008]\n\n545.

Howling Bells – Low Happening [2005]\n\n550. The Bees – Chicken Payback [2004]\n\nI’m not even going to deny being a fan of Lostprophets when they were in their prime – Watkins is a stain on society and should be locked away for good but that does not erase the legacy of the band’s music.\n\n551.

Chris Tomlin – Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone) [2006]\n\nBack to Christian music, this time contemporary/worship songs. I could conceivably fill these 10 solely with Twila Paris songs, to be honest.\n\n591. Linkin Park – In The End [2002]\n\n592. Fuel – Shimmer [1998]\n\n593. Incubus – Drive [1999]\n\n594.

The Corrs – The Right Time (acoustic version) [1996]\n\n1500. The Coral – Pass It On [2003]\n\nThe last 10 features 10 other songs from 10 from my all-time fave artists.\n\nSaid I’d post this list a couple of months ago.\n\nThis year I constructed a playlist of a 1000 of my favourite songs by Japanese artists – they could be anything from songs that first brought me into Jpop (like the first 10 on the list), made me fall in love with an act or a genre or simply, songs where I abused the ‘repeat’ button.\n\nI referred to my Last.fm charts a lot which unfortunately only go back to 14 years so that’s missing a slice of my early Jpop-listening days from the late 90s to 2003 – had to trawl through my extensive archives and portable devices listening to older playlists and albums.\n\nAlmost 2/3rds of the list are 2000s tracks, with the 2004-06 period contributing 30% of the list overall. Figures, cos I was in university then and a hikikomori with too much time on my hands.\n\nNot a saint only buying physical CDs (through Yesasia & CDJapan), so I obviously have a large collection of downloaded music: Audiogalaxy, winMX, winNY, Share, Bunko/Public MM tracker, soulseek and Jpopsuki being the primary sources in the 2000s. Nowadays I just check Youtube and stream off Spotify, then buy on iTunes or Recochoku if something’s to my liking – physical CDs are a no-go for me now thanks to space limitations.\n\nOldest songs would be from the ’60s, stuff that I found through kayōkyoku compilations & such. There are newer tracks too: 5 songs from 2017, in fact. Anisong/doujin/eroge themes makes up a good percentage (around 40%) of the list though a chunk of that overlaps with jrock/jpop as more & more rock acts such as VELTPUNCH and Tokyo Karankoron have had songs used in animation over the last decade.\n\nI compiled the list by rough groups of 10 songs each with a loose ‘theme’ to them ie anisong rock, kayokyoku/folk faves, j-urban and so on and so forth. My favourite of these is probably the Kajiura Yuki vocal tracks list\n\nIt appears Tomatsu Haruka has the most tracks featured on the list both solo and as part of a unit (8). Not intentional at all.\n\nTwo of the songs here have nonsensical made-up lyrics: 100s’s Honeycom.ware & B-DASH’s Cho. One is in traditional Okinawan dialect (Warabigami)\n\nTracks with solo female vocals outnumber males by 588 to 367, with 30 duets, 14 instrumentals & 1 vocaloid. I blame the anisong for that high ratio of girls to guys…\n\nTo listen to every second of every song would take 3 days 2 hours 14 minutes and 34 seconds.\n\nI tried to link to Youtube wherever possible but there are some with Spotify links (you’ll need an account for that) & legal Recochoku/iTunes/Mora (samples) links.\n\n01. Ozaki Yutaka – I LOVE YOU (1983)\n\n02. Hosokawa Takashi – Kita Sakaba (1982)\n\n03. Southern All Stars – Manatsu no Kajitsu (1990)\n\n04. Inagaki Junichi – Christmas Carol no Koro ni wa (1992)\n\n05. Yamashita Tatsurō – Christmas Eve (1983)\n\n06. Takeuchi Mariya – Genki o dashite (1984)\n\n07. Madoka Hiroshi – Musōbana (1978)\n\n08. Arai Yumi – 12gatsu no Ame (1974)\n\n09. Murashita Kōzō – Hatsukoi (1983)\n\n10. Yoshida Takurō – Asu ni Mukatte Hashire (1976)\n\nWhen I began my sojourn into Japanese music, I was not impressed. It was mostly bubblegum pop (Johnny’s, Hello Project, Hamasaki Ayumi) of little substance and really, it wasn’t ’til I stumbled across Ozaki Yutaka via a random download through Audiogalaxy that I started to think that Jpop might have more to it. Around that period my mom would flick through random folk/enka shows on NHK as well, which was how I got into the classic hits. These 10 tracks represented some of my earliest favourites that I first heard in the late 90s.\n\n11. Utada Hikaru – Wait & See ~Risk~ (2001)\n\n12. m-flo loves melody. & Ryohei – miss you (2003)\n\n13. Tokyo Jihen – Sōnan (2004)\n\n14. sleepy.ab – Shiki Utakata (2006)\n\n15. Spitz – Robinson (1995)\n\n16. Yen Town Band – Swallowtail Butterfly -Ai no Uta- (1996)\n\n17. FREENOTE – Re:Channel (2004)\n\n18. Onitsuka Chihiro – Gekkō (2000)\n\n19. Chemistry – Pieces of a Dream (2001)\n\n20. HY – AM11:00 (2003)\n\nThese would be the 10 I’d say best reflect my overall taste in Japanese-language music – a mix of styles from urban to pop to rock and indie.\n\nThe defunct FREENOTE is probably the band here that is closest to my heart as I watched a bunch of their lives when I was still staying in Japan.\n\nObviously Utada Hikaru is my First (Jpop) Love [pun fully intended] and I think my local record shop was sick of me calling up on them all the time to find out whether her latest album had arrived.\n\nWill never forget how loud I squeed when I found Onitsuka Chihiro’s first album in a pokey corner of a CD store in some godforsaken mall in town. It really was so hard to get hold of original copies of Japanese music at the time… (for a high-school kid like me)\n\nI fell in love with Spitz after buying a triple-CD bootleg of their tunes out of desperation. I made sure to get their albums proper after Yesasia came into existence.\n\nIf you asked me to pick my #1 Japanese song of all time, push come to shove, I’d nominate Swallowtail Butterfly.\n\n21. Ōsawa Yoshiyuki – Soshite, Boku wa Tohō ni Kureru (1984)\n\n22. KAN – Ai wa Katsu (1990)\n\n23. Happy End – Kaze o Atsumete (1971)\n\n24. H20 – Omoide ga Ippai (1983)\n\n25. Nakamori Akina – Slow Motion (1982)\n\n26. Moritaka Chisato – Watarasebashi (1993)\n\n27. Kosaka Akiko – Anata (1973)\n\n28. Hibari Misora – Kawa no Nagareru Youni (1989)\n\n29. Ohashi Junko – Tasogare My Love (1978)\n\n30. Yamamoto Kotaro to Weekend – Misaki Meguri (1974)\n\nMore evergreen classic Jpop tracks, the type you see oft featured on cover albums. Have a soft spot for melancholic, minor-key power ballads like Ohashi Junko (sad to hear that she was diagnosed with early-stage esophageal cancer earlier this year, hope she recovers well) and Nakamori Akina’s songs here.\n\n31. JUDY AND MARY – Kaze ni Fukarete (1997)\n\n32. Misia – Everything (2000)\n\n33. Quruli – Bara no Hana (2001)\n\n34. THE BACK HORN – Sunny (2001)\n\n35. fra-foa – Light of sorrow (2002)\n\n36. Noanowa – Yume no Arika (2009)\n\n37. the pillows – That House (1998)\n\n38. ANATAKIKOU – Fushigi na Ito (2005)\n\n39. LOST IN TIME – Mada Furusato e wa Kaerenai (2006)\n\n40. Swinging Popsicle – I just wanna kiss you (2004)\n\nAnother 10 songs that I’d consider to be amongst my favouritest of all times. noanowa and LOST IN TIME are 2 acts I spent a lot of time pursuing live as well – Yume no Arika is just so explosive to watch in person.\n\n41. Sakai Masaaki – Saraba Koibito (1971)\n\n42. Kondo Masahiko – Yuyake no Uta (1989)\n\n43. Wada Akiko – Ano Kane o Narasu no wa Anata (1972)\n\n44. Bread & Butter – Ano Koro no mama (1979)\n\n45. Moriguchi Hiroko – Mizu no Hoshi e Ai o Komete (1985)\n\n46. Anzen Chitai – Suki sa (1986)\n\n47. Kubota Toshinobu – La La La Love Song (1996)\n\n48. Fukuyama Masaharu – Heart (1998)\n\n49. The Jacks – Tokei o Tomete (1968)\n\n50. Akai Tori – Tsubasa o Kudasai (1971)\n\nMore all-time favourites. The Jacks is the one that stands out most on this one ‘cos it’s JP psychedelic-rock at its finest (not that there was a lot of that being made in the first place).\n\n51. Every Little Thing – Time goes by (1998)\n\n52. Fumido – Nakimushi no Uta (2005)\n\n53. DEPAPEPE – Summer Parade (2005)\n\n54. Lost in Time – Anata wa Ikiteiru (2004)\n\n55. TRICERATOPS – Jewel (2004)\n\n56. dorlis – Mabataki (2005)\n\n57. Soutaiseiriron – Jigoku Sensei (2009)\n\n58. Shiina Ringo – Kabukichō no Joou (1998)\n\n59. Rin’ – Fuhen (2004)\n\n60. ELLEGARDEN – Missing (2004)\n\nIt’s funny to think now that I actually discovered certain acts through watching NHK’s weekly (dead) Pop Jam show – TRICERATOPS and acoustic instrumental duo DEPAPEPE being 2 examples. Pop Jam died in 2006 & was replaced by Music Japan which in turn died in 2016. I haven’t tuned into NHK for ages now so god knows what’s replaced that now.\n\nI discovered this Time Goes By (and other classics like Zard & YMO) through playing beat mania GB2 Gatcha Mix on the bloody Game Boy Color back in 2000. Somehow, I could still tell that it was a great tune despite being chiptuned beyond recognition.\n\n61. Porno Graffitti – Saboten (2000)\n\n62. EXILE – Your eyes only -Aimai na Boku no Katachi- (2001)\n\n63, Hitomi – IS IT YOU? (2001)\n\n64. Suga Shikao – 8gatsu no Serenade (2001)\n\n65. YOSHII LOVINSON – CALL ME (2005)\n\n66. SURFACE – Kimi no Koe de Kimi no Subete de… (1999)\n\n67. Hysteric Blue – Haru~spring~ (1999)\n\n68. Mr.Children – Tomorrow never knows (1994)\n\n69. Sakamoto Ryuichi – energy flow (1999)\n\n70. Hamasaki Ayumi – M (2000)\n\nAnother way I discovered Jpop hits at the turn of the century was through the MTV cable channel that would play the odd Jpop track here and there, and through watching dorama. EXILE and Hitomi’s tracks here were the themes from one of my fave doramas – Dekichatta Kekkon (Shotgun Wedding), headlined by Takenouchi Yutaka and Hirosue Ryoko\n\nHysteric Blue is one of those bands who used to be so big but whose legacy will forever be tarnished by an unsavoury scandal – in 2005, guitarist Akamatsu Naoki was jailed for 14 years, reduced to 12 upon appeal, for raping teenage girls. He’s due for release in October 2018.\n\n71. Onsoku Line – Nagareboshi Line (2005)\n\n72. Hirakawachi 1-chome – Hoshi kara Fuku Kaze (2004)\n\n73. school food punishment – 04:59 (2010)\n\n74. B’z – Konya Tsuki no Mieru Oka ni (2000)\n\n75. Hotaru Biyori – Ringo Ame (2010)\n\n76. CUNE – Refrain (2002)\n\n77. Okuda Tamio – E10 Rider (1996)\n\n78. ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION – Kimi to Iu Hana (2003)\n\n79. Tsubakiya Shijuso – Koharu Biyori (2004)\n\n80. Otsuka Ai – Daisukidayo. (2004)\n\nSupposedly a rock-themed list but for some reason, Otsuka’s power ballad is tacked on at the end here.\n\nI’ve written about Hirakawachi 1-chome before. The duo recently reformed for a series of gigs on the 10th anniversary year of their split and their previously-estranged mom came to see their tour finale. Elder brother Ryunosuke has remained in music all the while (he also married a single mother & they recently had their 1st child), but younger brother Naojiro’s now a personal trainer.\n\n81. Lia – Tori no Uta (2000)\n\n82. Supercell – Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari (2009)\n\n83. Ishiwatari Junji & Sunahara Yoshinori + Yakushimaru Etsuko – Kamisama no Iu toori (2010)\n\n84. DOES – Shuraba (2007)\n\n85. Suneohair – Waltz (2005)\n\n86. Galileo Galilei – Aoi Shiori (2011)\n\n87. Chatmonchy – Shangri-la (2006)\n\n88. Lama – Fantasy (2011)\n\n89. FLOW – DAYS (2005)\n\n90. SPYAIR – Samurai Heart (Some Like it Hot) (2011)\n\nAnime themes list. The first 10 that came to mind when I thought of ‘anisong’ – which apart from maybe Lia & Supercell, is probably not what other people think of when they think of ‘anisong’!\n\nThe opening bars of Suneohair’s Waltz evokes bittersweet memories tinged with regret, as I suspect it would do for those of us who watched and were able to relate to Honey & Clover during our college/uni days.\n\nAoi Shiori reminds me of Japan – I’d quit my job & was living in Japan, doing my ‘jibun sagashi’ thing when the song was released that summer. I particularly like the line ‘Mada jikan wa bokura no mono de’ (Time is still ours to spend as we wish).\n\n91. DREAMS COME TRUE – Asa ga Mata Kuru (1999)\n\n92. Superfly – Ai o Komete Hanataba o (2008)\n\n93. JUJU – I can be free (2008)\n\n94. Nishino Kana – Tatoe donna ni… (2011)\n\n95. Dew – Dandelion (2008)\n\n96. Natsukawa Rimi – Nada Sousou (2001)\n\n97. Cocco – Jukai no Ito (1999)\n\n98. ZONE – Secret Base ~Kimi ga kureta mono~ (2001)\n\n99. Fayray – feel (2004)\n\n100. RUI (Shibasaki Kou) – Tsuki no Shizuku (2003)\n\n101. Shojo Jidai – you-aholic (2011)\n\n102. Spangle call Lilli line – Crawl (2002)\n\n103. Supercar – Yumegiwa Last Boy (2002)\n\n104. Nao’ymt feat. S-key-A – Okay (2008)\n\n105. Perfume – 575 (2010)\n\n106. Amuro Namie – COPY THAT (2009)\n\n107. Apogee – 1,2,3 (2009)\n\n108. Modern Conya – Namida no Ame (2003)\n\n109. Aira Mitsuki – China Discotica (2008)\n\n110. Sakanaction – Identity (2011)\n\nA vague attempt at an electronic-themed list.\n\n111. Kobukuro – Million Films (2004)\n\n112. Sukimaswitch – Furete Mirai o (2004)\n\n113. Sasuke – Ajisai no Uta (2004)\n\n114. Hata Motohiro – Uroko (2007)\n\n115. L’arc~en~ciel – Honey (1998)\n\n116. Fujifrabric – Akakiniro no Kinmokusei (2004)\n\n117. Kuchiroro – Hawaii (2005)\n\n118. BUMP OF CHICKEN – Guild (2004)\n\n119. Oda Kazumasa – Masshiro (2004)\n\n120. The Miceteeth – Kiri no Naka (2004)\n\nGuild was a song that meant a lot to me when it was first released (on the album Yggdrasil) – lyrics about being tired and feeling like there’s no point in being alive resonated within me.\n\nMentioned it before, but I don’t really listen to Fujifabric’s music any more after they chose to continue on when vocalist Shimura Masahiko died – he was the last remaining original member of the band from the indie days and I don’t recognize anything of what Fujifabric used to be.\n\nThe Miceteeth are my favourite J-ska group but of course, I had to pick the one song that’s most unska-like. Try Subarashii Hibi for something a little more upbeat & typical of their sound.\n\n121. Ketsumeishi – Sakura (2005)\n\n122. Hilcrhyme – Shunkashūtō (2009)\n\n123. RIP SLYME – Tasogare Surround (2004)\n\n124. Aqua Timez – Sen no Yoru o Koete (2006)\n\n125. ORANGE RANGE – Ikenai Taiyō (2007)\n\n126. Steady&Co. – Shunkashūtō (2001)\n\n127. Dragon Ash – Shizuka na Hibi o Kaidan o (2000)\n\n128. Ozawa Kenji feat. Scha dara Parr – Kon’ya wa Boogie Back (1994)\n\n129. HOME MADE KAZOKU – Thank you!! (2005)\n\n130. Spontania feat. Juju – Kimi no Subete ni (2008)\n\nMainstream hip-hop/rap songs. I had a tendency to pick them when I went for solo karaoke in Japan despite having the rapping skills of a drunk priest.\n\n131. BONNIE PINK – Last Kiss (2004)\n\n132. KOKIA – Arigatō… (1999)\n\n133. Tomosaka Rie – Cappucino (1999)\n\n134. Odani Misako – rain (1997)\n\n135. Shibata Jun – Hoshi no Yoin (2002)\n\n136. Le Couple – Sofa (1997)\n\n137. Hana*Hana – Sayonara Daisuki na Hito (2000)\n\n138. Hirosue Ryoko – Rhythm (1999)\n\n139. I WiSH – Asu e no Tobira (2003)\n\n140. Kiroro – Nagai Aida (1998)\n\nQuite a few of my early favourite Jpop songs on this list, which in hindsight, were pretty depressing. KOKIA’s is an ode to someone who’s died, Hana*Hana’s is a breakup song, and I can’t think of many Shibata Jun songs that aren’t depressing…\n\nHirosue Ryoko ain’t a great singer (she’s an actress so…) but I spent so much time listening to her albums which I had loaded on my old Creative Jukebox Zen MP3 player, during the 4 & 1/2 hour bus rides between London Heathrow and my boarding school in Somerset. I didn’t even own a mobile phone then, fun times.\n\nI didn’t learn until a lot later on that Cappucino was a Shiina Ringo-written track (which she eventually self-covered), but I still prefer Tomosaka’s version\n\nI thought Last Kiss might’ve been the weirdest choice for an anime theme ever but somehow, the lyrics ended up fitting Gantz so perfectly. Odd.\n\n141. Mr. Children – Sign (2004)\n\n142. TUBE – Natsu Matsuri (2004)\n\n143. Under Graph – Paradigm (2005)\n\n144. Do As Infinity – Tooku made… (2001)\n\n145. KUMACHI – Sayonara (2003)\n\n146. Kuwata Keisuke – Shiroi Koibitotachi (2001)\n\n147. LUNA SEA – I For You (1998)\n\n148. Janne Da Arc – Gekkōka (2005)\n\n149. Ulfuls – Waraereba (2002)\n\n150. 19 – Ashiato (2001)\n\nMore of those ‘ultimate favourite tunes’ (I have a lot of those). DAI was one of the first Jpop/rock bands I got into, and I remember having to hunt down their CDs when I went on holiday to Singapore back in the day before Internet shopping existed.\n\n151. Kaientai – Okuru Kotoba (1979)\n\n152. Ogura Kei – Saraba Seishun (1971)\n\n153. Iruka – Nagoriyuki (1975)\n\n154. Sakamoto Kyu – Ue o Muite Arukou (1961)\n\n155. EPO – U, Fu, Fu, Fu (1983)\n\n156. Kai Band – Anna (1979)\n\n157. Hamada Shogo – Midnight Flight -Hitoribocchi no Christmas Eve- (1985)\n\n158. Matsuda Seiko – Akai Sweet Pea (1982)\n\n159. Nakajima Miyuki/Kashiwabara Yoshie – Haru na no ni (1983)\n\n160. Ota Hiromi – Shiawase Miman (1977)\n\nClassics, classics, classics. I wish I had more time to discover more of them. I do get fed up with modern day artists picking the same ones over and over to cover though – I really don’t want to hear another version of Nagoriyuki tbh…\n\n161. Moriyama Naotaro – Toki no Yukue~Jō.Haru no Sora~ (2005)\n\n162. BEGIN – Kimi o Miteiru (2004)\n\n163. HY – Toki o Koe (2010)\n\n164. Atari Kosuke – Ieji (2006)\n\n165. Koja Misako – Warabigami (1997)\n\n166. Nakashima Mika – Sakurairo Mau Koro (2005)\n\n167. Matsushita Nao with Gontiti – Tsuyukusa (2006)\n\n168. Rin’ – Sakura Sakura (instrumental with shakuhachi, shamisen) (2005)\n\n169. Oshio Kotaro – Sakura. Saku koro (2004)\n\n170. Hitoto Yo – Morainaki (2002)\n\nSongs with a traditional feel, which tend to set my tear ducts into action pretty quickly. HY’s Toki o Koe, an Okinawan-flavoured tune (backed by a modern choir!) about the sacrifices of grandparents gets me every time.\n\nKoja Misako’s Warabigami may sound alien to most – it’s sung in Uchinaguchi (Okinawan language) though over the years the likes of Natsukawa Rimi & Hana*Hana have recorded it in standard Japanese\n\nAt first I thought Morainaki was partly sung in a foreign language before I realized it was just Hitoto’s version of…yodelling or something. She’s half-Taiwanese, and her life has been eventful. Her parents died early on – her father when she was a young child, and her mother when she was 16. She got entangled in a messy affair with musician/producer Kobayashi Takeshi (who was married to his My Little Lover bandmate Akko at the time) in 2007 but they split in 2013 and she’s now married to guitarist Yamaguchi Shuhei and they have a child.\n\nAnd yes people might remember Moriyama Naotaro for dissing anisong back in 2005 or so when he wished the moe and Akiba-kei stuff would disappear (responding to seeing Negima on the charts). His songs are lovely though, and the classic Sakura was later covered by Idolmaster seiyuu! w\n\n171. RYTHEM – Kasumizakura (2007)\n\n172. I WiSH – Yakusoku no Hi (2004)\n\n173. Matsumoto Eiko – Naturally Yours (2000)\n\n174. Ganaha Mina – Tsuki no Shizuku (2006)\n\n175. Michelle143 – Futarigurashi (2006)\n\n176. Takei Shiori – Sakurairo (2006)\n\n177. Hoshimura Mai – EVERY (2005)\n\n178. Takaoka Ai – LaLaLa (2004)\n\n179. Lyrico – Kiseki no Hana (2002)\n\n180. Le Couple – Ichinichi no Owari ni (2000)\n\nFemale singers, mostly ballads. There are a lot of these types in Japan, and most are underappreciated chart-wise.\n\nLyrico now operates under her real name Tsuyuzaki Harumi. She’s a powerhouse vocalist that again, Japan can’t seem to appreciate ‘cos it ain’t cute or novel.\n\nI thought Takei Shiori (signed to Giza, home of Kuraki Mai etc) had a lot of potential but it just didn’t work out for her and she retired from singing at the age of 23 when her contract ended. Now a normal salarywoman.\n\nSimilar story for Takaoka Ai, another Giza talent who left the company in 2009 and after 2 years at Box Corporation, went on hiatus in 2011 at age 29. Never returned to the biz since.\n\n181. Do As Infinity – Shinjitsu no Uta (2002)\n\n182. Tanizawa Tomofumi – Kimi ni Todoke (2009)\n\n183. Kukikodan – Aoi Hana (2009)\n\n184. Rie fu – Life is Like a Boat (2004)\n\n185. Younha – Houkiboshi (2005)\n\n186. Takahashi Hitomi – Aozora no Namida (2005)\n\n187. YeLLOW Generation – Tobira no Mukou e (2004)\n\n188. Linked Horizon – Guren no Yumiya (2013)\n\n189. Jinguji Sakura & Teikoku Kagekidan – Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan (1996)\n\n190. Kuraki Mai – Secret of My Heart (2000)\n\nMore anisong that aren’t very anisong. Except maybe Sakura Taisen, which topped my list of my 100 favourite anisong.\n\n191. SPECIAL OTHERS – STAR (2007)\n\n192. Bonobos – Ano Kotoba, Ano Hikari (2004)\n\n193. organic stereo – Upon My Soul (2008)\n\n194. Tokyo No.1 Soul Set – Naked Waltz (2005)\n\n195. POMERANIANS – Nagareru Hoshi no Youni (2005)\n\n196. Dry & Heavy – Dawn is Breaking (2000)\n\n197. ACIDMAN – Sekitou (2002)\n\n198. Sacra – Yesterday (2003)\n\n199. Iwase Keigo – Kurikaesu wa Kuchiguse to Zaiakukan (2002)\n\n200. THE YELLOW MONKEY – MY WINDING ROAD (1998)\n\nNot much of a theme going on here it seems. There’s ska, post-rock, dub, plain ‘ol rock.\n\n201. Hoover’s Ooover – Fender (2003)\n\n202. the brilliant green – angel song -Eve no Kane- (2001)\n\n203. YOGURT-pooh – 8gatsu no Echo (2002)\n\n204. Tokyo60WATTS – Soto wa Samui kara (2004)\n\n205. 100s – Honeycom.ware (2005)\n\n206. THE LOCAL ART – Sakura (2006)\n\n207. SPARTA LOCALS – Tokyo Ballerina (2005)\n\n208. Scoobie Do – Parade (2004)\n\n209. STARBOARD – Drawing (2006)\n\n210. Straightener – Hashiru Iwa (2002)\n\nSome of my favourite rock acts. The majority of these I got hold of through trading albums on Soulseek – I recall some of those users being very particular about who they’d allow to download their stuff so unless you had a substantial collection of your own, you’d never get access.\n\n211. Sing Like Talking – Spirit of Love (1995)\n\n212. Skoop on Somebody – Sha La La (2001)\n\n213. Kirinji – Kimi no Koto dayo (2008)\n\n214. JAY’ED – Everybody (2009)\n\n215. Yamamoto Ryohei – Moon Sexy (2004)\n\n216. Crazy Ken Band – Loco Loco Sunset Cruise (2005)\n\n217. Kinmokusei – Futari no Akaboshi (2002)\n\n218. RAG FAIR – She Side Story (2002)\n\n219. silly – break of dawn (2004)\n\n220. m-flo – Yours only, (2001)\n\nUrban/r’n’b music. Not a genre I usually favour but there is always the odd track here and there that piques my interest. Most of these acts have either ceased to exist or sunk into obscurity.\n\n221. Syrup16g – She was beautiful (2001)\n\n222. the ARROWS – Buribura (2004)\n\n223. Saito Kazuyoshi – Kimi wa Boku no Nani o Suki ni nattan darou (2007)\n\n224. advantage Lucy – Kaze ni Azukete (1999)\n\n225. Sunny Day Service – Yoru no Melody (2000)\n\n226. Burger Nuds – Kusa no Hana (2002)\n\n"
