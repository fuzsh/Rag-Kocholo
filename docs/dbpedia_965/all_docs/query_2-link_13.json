        "text": "Vocalist: Saeko Chiba\n\nComposer: Yuki Kajiura\n\nArranger: Yuki Kajiura, Susumu Nishikawa\n\nLyrics: Yuki Kajiura, Chiaki Ishiakawa, Kanata Asamizu\n\nProducer: Yuki Kajiura\n\nPublisher: Victor Entertainment\n\n[Click on photo to enlarge]\n\nBasics\n\nThe collaboration between the seiyuu / singer Saeko Chiba (千葉 紗子) and Yuki Kajiura started in 1999, when Saeko sung the song 恋の奇跡 (Koi no Kiseki) composed by Yuki for the Playstation game ‘Meguri Aishite’ music. The song was used for the game along with Kajiura’s game-related score, and a single was released on February 27, 1999 containing the song and its karaoke version.\n\nAfter a hiatus of 4 years (during which Saeko release 2 singles where Yuki Kajiura was not involved: Carry On Everyday and トゥインクル☆スター [Twinkle Star]), the second single of the collaboration was released: ダイヤの原石 (Daiya no Genseki). The single contained the title song, the b-side そばにいて (Soba ni Ite) and their respective karaoke versions. It’s notable that in the title song of this single, Chiaki Ishikawa of See-Saw was also involved in co-writing the lyrics with Yuki Kajiura. In November 10, 2002, the 3rd single titled さよなら (Sayonara) was released. This single contained the title song, the b-side 星空の虹 (Hoshizora no niji), and their karaoke versions.\n\nOn January 22, 2003, the 4th single of the collaboration was released, the title song of which, ひかり (Hikari) was used as the 2nd ending for the anime Heat Guy J. The single also contained the b-side ‘Hello Goodbye’ and the karaoke version of the two songs.\n\nThe 1st album of the collaboration was released on March 26, 2003. It was titled ‘Melody‘, containing 13 tracks. All of them except ‘Hikari’ and ‘Koi no Kiseki’ (which was included as “Bonus Track”) were new songs. The limited edition also contained a DVD with the PV of Melody and some “making of” videos.\n\nThe 5th single was released On May 21, 2003, containing アイスクリイム (Ice Cream), the b-side 始まりの景色 (Hajimari no Keshiki) and the respective karaoke versions, with the title song being the Ending Theme for the anime Narue no Sekai. Seven months later, on November 27, 2003 the single Winter Story was released, containg Winter story, the b-side “story”, the respective off vocal versions, and the bonus track “another story”. Thi single was not composed for any anime or game in particular.\n\nThe last single to date of the collaboration was released on January 24, 2004, with the title さよならソリティア (Sayonara Solitia) used as the Ending Theme of the anime Chrono Chrusade. The single included the title song, its b-side “Here we stand in the morning dew”, and the respective off vocal versions. Its notable that “Here we stand in the morning dew” was later covered by Yuriko Kaida on FictionJunction’s album, Everlasting Songs.\n\nThe collaboration’s 2nd (and last) album was released on June 23, 2004. It was titled Everything, with 14 tracks in total, some of them from previous singles released between the 2 albums, as well as new songs. There was also a rearranged version of Daiya no Genseki (Daiya no genseki #brilliant covered). The album tracks are still composed by Yuki Kajiura with some tracks arranged by her e-guitarist Susumu Nishikawa (2 and 10), and some of the song lyrics being written by Kanata Asamizu (2, 7 to 11 and 13).\n\nAfter that album release, the collaboaration ended. Chiba Saeko got married in 2007 and concentrated in voice acting, and Yuki Kajiura discovered Yuuka Nanri (probably thanks to Yuuka’s and Chiba Saeko’s duo “Tiaraway”), and thus FictionJunction Yuuka project was born which later expanded to FictionJunction.\n\n(Thanks to tinba for translating the text written by Angelica, hosted on his site, Kajiura Eternal Heaven (KEH), which helped alot in making the above narration.)\n\nLive Performances\n\nSaeko Chiba LIVE 2004 “everything”\n\nJuly 19, 2004\n\nChiba Saeko\n\nEbisu the Garden Hall, Tokyo, Japan\n\n19 Songs\n\nDiscography\n\nSaeko Chiba – everything\n\nLACA-5290 | June 23, 2004\n\nAlbum\n\n14 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – Sayonara Solitia\n\nLACM-4118 | January 24, 2004\n\nSingle (Chrono Crusade ED)\n\n4 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – Winter Story\n\nLACM-4111 | November 27, 2003\n\nSingle\n\n5 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – Ice Cream\n\nLACM-4096 | May 21, 2003\n\nSingle (Narue no Sekai ED)\n\n4 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – melody\n\nLACA-5160 | March 26, 2003\n\nAlbum\n\n13 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – Hikari\n\nLACM-4085 | January 22,2003\n\nSingle (Heat Guy J ED)\n\n4 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – Sayonara\n\nLRPS-1004 | November 10, 2002\n\nSingle\n\n4 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – Daiya no Genseki\n\nLRPS-1003 | August 24, 2002\n\nSingle\n\n4 tracks\n\nSaeko Chiba – Koi no Kiseki\n\nSRDL-4585 | February 27, 1999\n\nSingle\n\n2 tracks\n\nAppearances"
