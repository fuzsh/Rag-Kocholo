        "text": "Hi. I'm learning Japanese on my own.\n\nI came across this sentence\n\n\"watashi wa koko ni iru\"\n\n'watashi' is I\n\n'wa' is the topic marker\n\n'koko' is here\n\n'ni' is used for a location. like \"in XXX\"\n\nBut what does the 'iru' here means?\n\nI searched around the net for the translations for \"koko ni iru\" and it gave me \"I am here\". But that doesn't give me the rough meaning of 'iru'\n\nThe internet also gave me verbs with iru form. which i think doesn't concerns me here?\n\nAnd also, when to use 'wa' or 'ga'?\n\n. What's the meaning of 'iru'\n\n. when to use 'wa' or 'ga'\n\n. Any good site to recommend to improve my Japanese?\n\nThank you in advance for any help.\n\nIt means \"[As for me,] I am here\".\n\nThe English \"be\" (\"am\") already means \"exists\" in this case.\n\nEdit: it occurs to me that \"I will be here\" is a better translation.\n\nHmm... What makes you think that \"I will be here\" is better?\n\nBecause the -ru forms means to something?\n\nSo iru will be to exist (to be). \"I to be here\" becomes \"I will be here\"?\n\nAnd one more thing. I heard soba ni iru from a song and it roughly translates to \"to be by my side\" right? and soba ni ite from the song HEAVEN by Ayumi. so ite is the -te form of iru? So it's more of a command form of \"to stay by my side\"?\n\nIf ite is the -te form of iru. No wonder I can't find the word ite in dictionary.\n\nEdit: it occurs to me that \"I will be here\" is a better translation.\n\nThe future interpretation is possible but not necessarily a better one. What I have argued ad nauseam in the long thread about Tenses and Aspects in Verbs (1 2) does not seem to apply to iru. Usually, the ru-form of a verb is a reference to a future action or a present habit but the simple present is the most general interpretation for iru and other verbs that express a state (yes, existing somewhere can be understood as a state). Again, the future interpretation is possible. Only context can determine which is better.\n\nTo Death4ngel;\n\nYes, ite is the te-form of iru. In your example (soba-ni ite), it is best understood as a casual imperative meaning, \"stay beside me!\"\n\nThe future interpretation is possible but not necessarily a better one.

Would you have to say 私は後でいる?\n\nWhat does いている imply? Perfect aspect? (Something happened, so I'm here now)\n\nWhile on the topic, I have two questions:\n\nHow would one explicitly say that they will be here? Would you have to say 私は後でいる?\n\nWhat does いている imply? Perfect aspect? (Something happened, so I'm here now)\n\n\"they will be here\" would be \"anatatachi wa koko ni iru\". It should be this. Someone better confirm.\n\nThere's no explicit future tense in Japanese. いる means \"I am here\" or \"I will be here\". Context or the use of time words (明日、etc.) can clarify the timeframe involved.\n\nWhen I suggested \"I will be here\" was a better translation, it was because I couldn't think of many situations where saying \"I am here\" made sense. I mean, where else would you be?\n\nThere's no explicit future tense in Japanese. いる means \"I am here\" or \"I will be here\".

I mean, where else would you be?\n\nI thought this might be the case.\n\nRegarding the ambiguity of ここにいる, in English, \"I am here\" is often announced when someone arrives to meet with people who are expecting him; especially if that person's attendance is important. Do Japanese people never use the expression in such a way?\n\nThat said though, even if they do, the context would negate the ambiguity. Nobody will ever say \"I will be here!\" in the context I described unless they have a few screws loose.\n\nCaptain Haddock said:\n\nI couldn't think of many situations where saying \"I am here\" made sense. I mean, where else would you be?\n\nImagine you and other people are in a very dark place, some may ask: \"John, where are you?\" In that case \"I am here!\" would make perfect sense.\n\nHow would one explicitly say that they will be here? Would you have to say 私は後でいる?\n\nWhat does いている imply? Perfect aspect? (Something happened, so I'm here now)\n\nいている is non-existent. A few verbs including いる and ある cannot receive -teiru.\n\n\"they will be here\" would be \"anatatachi wa koko ni iru\". It should be this. Someone better confirm.\n\nBesides what our good captain has said, \"they\" can be expressed by karera but it is not the only word for it. \"Personal pronouns\" in Japanese have been discussed several times in the forum. Feel free to search for appropriate threads and add comments (but not here, please ).\n\nIn this case, I think the translation would be \"I will be here\". I took this from an anime \"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu\"\n\nSince this is from a picture of an advertisement of season 2 which is yet to be out. Then the future form would be better.\n\nSo the -ru form can be present or future? (it's roughly said in the thread, but just to make sure)\n\nRegarding the ambiguity of ここにいる, in English, \"I am here\" is often announced when someone arrives to meet with people who are expecting him; especially if that person's attendance is important. Do Japanese people never use the expression in such a way?\n\nA Japanese person will say something like 着いたよ, literally \"I have arrived\".\n\nBy the way, I looked up ここにいる in the ALC dictionary/language corpus. For every instance in which this was used as a sentence (6 or 7), it was indeed in the future tense.\n\nSo the -ru form can be present or future? (it's roughly said in the thread, but just to make sure)\n\nYes. (short answer)"
