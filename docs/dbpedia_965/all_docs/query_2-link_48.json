        "text": "Word of the Day posts are great for learning new words, but sometimes we want to learn through more engaging styles. My high school French teacher always enjoyed sharing songs with us, and lyrics can sometimes be simple enough if you actually analyze them. Here’s one of my favorite songs as of late. Lyrics and translations from:\n\nAnd for more from Leo Ieiri, take a look at my site!\n\nhttp://cs2033.gaul.csd.uwo.ca/users/htsang22/assign3/music.html\n\nROMAJI\n\nkimi no koe shiroku hibiku soba ni ite yo to\n\nfutari tsunaide’ta ro-do kiesou na yoru\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nshinjitsu no tobira wo sagasou\n\nmimi wo sumaseba kikoeru yo\n\nfutari no mirai\n\nkisetsu wa mata sugite’ku boku wo okizari ni shite\n\nsayonara no uta utaou tabidachi no asa\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nfuridashita ame ni utarete\n\ntooi jikan no saki made\n\nyasashiku nareta\n\nyakusoku no basho de toikakete miru\n\nkokoro wa ima demo\n\nnukumori shinjite machitsudzukete’ru\n\nLay it down\n\nshinjitsu no tobira wo sagasou\n\nkodoku na taiyou ni\n\nniji wo kakeyou\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nshinjitsu no tobira wo sagasou\n\nmimi wo sumaseba kikoeru yo\n\nfutari no mirai\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nfuridashita ame ni utarete\n\ntooi jikan no saki made\n\nyasashiku nareta\n\nkisetsu wa mata sugite’ku (boku wo) okizari ni shite\n\nENGLISH\n\nYour voice rings out whitely to stay by your side\n\nA night when the road we were connected by is about it disappear\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nLet’s find the door to the truth\n\nIf you listen closely, you can hear it\n\nOur future\n\nThe seasons are changing again, leaving me behind\n\nLet’s sing a song of goodbye, the morning I set off on my trip\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nCaught in the rain that’s started to fall\n\nI was able to become kinder\n\nUntil the end of our distant time\n\nI’ll ask the question at the place where we’re meeting\n\nMy heart believes in your warmth\n\nAnd continues to wait, even now\n\nLay it down\n\nLet’s find the door to the truth\n\nLet’s put a rainbow\n\nOn the lonely sun\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nLet’s find the door to the truth\n\nIf you listen closely, you can hear it\n\nOur future\n\nI wanna lay it down\n\nCaught in the rain that’s started to fall\n\nI was able to become kinder\n\nUntil the end of our distant time\n\nThe seasons are changing again, leaving (me) behind\n\nI usually reserve this blog for Word of the Day posts, but I would really like to share a bit about my Japanese class. I take a second-year Japanese course at Huron College, and we recently had our final class. To be completely honest with you all, Japanese has been a fairly difficult class for me, but it’s still managed to maintain its spot as my favourite time of the week. Our teacher, Akai-sensei, puts a huge amount of effort into making our classes engaging, and I really respect her for encouraging us all to participate (especially the less-fluent members of the class… like myself). So I’ll keep this brief – I just wanted to commemorate my time with this wonderful class. I’m unsure if I’ll have the time and space to fit another Japanese course in my schedule next year, but we’ll see how it goes. Japanese will always be a passion of mine!"
