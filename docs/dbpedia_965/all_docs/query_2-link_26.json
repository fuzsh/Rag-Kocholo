        "text": "Two Thoughts\n\nHere I am with the final part of October’s themed week in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual kei band Gotcharocka, precisely Ash, the lead-track of their eighth single with the same name, released on 9th November 2016. This song features all the band’s key elements, with an energetic rock sound accompained by a really positive message.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nThe song starts with pretty energetic and paced guitar notes, leading up to a flowing and dynamic theme; Jui’s voice is quite fast and passionate, well accompained by the guitar notes, in a catchy and engaging rock track, pretty easy to listen and emphasized by Jun’s awesome guitar work, especially in the second part.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\n\"Mata kurai kao shichatte douse kangaegoto nan desho?\" GARASU goshi ni utsutta jibun o mitsumete wa umaku nante ikanai ne... kinou to onaji SERIFU narabeta ashita mo kitto kawaranai no desu ka? \"Ii desho? kore ijou\" \"ii desho? ima ijou\" \"nayami komanakute ii\" \"Kono sekai ni kimi wa tatta hitori sa kimi no kawari o enjiru hito nado inai\" Kagiri naku nibiiro ni chikai sora no shita de akiru kurai iya na koto ga aru noni kawaranai dakedo tachidomari wa shinai kara ikura namida koboretatte waraeru sa ima kanashimi ni todome o \"Mada NIGAi kao shichatte douse omoidashita n'desho?\" nanigenai hitoiki ga tameiki ni kawatta wasurerarenai doushite... youyaku rikai shita yo hito ni wa hanarerarenai kako ga arutte koto \"Ii desho? ima kara de\" \"ii desho? osoku wa nai\" \"umarekawareru no sa\" \"Sukoshi kurai yasashisa nagesutete shimaeba ii kokoro ga oreru kurai nara\" Tsurakatta azayaka ni nokoru kako no kioku ima mo kokoro tokiori sashikomu kedo mou nidoto omoide no maigo ni wa naranai ikura namida koboretatte waraeru sa ima kanashimi ni todome o Let's sing a merry song. Let's dance together. Keep playing until your grief is gone. Kagiri naku nibiiro ni chikai sora no shita de akiru kurai kujike tsudzuketa keredo kawareru sa koko de tachidomari wa shinai kara ikura namida koboretatte waraeru sa ima kanashimi ni todome o hikari sasu ashita e\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\n“Do I have again a gloomy face or is only a thought?” Looking at myself, reflected in the mirror It is not good... Disposing words from yesterday Will it change tomorrow?\n\n“Is everything alright? Not anymore.” “Is everything alright? More than now.” “You don’t have to worry.”\n\n“You are unique in this world nobody can replace you.” (I)\n\nUnder the sky, closer to grey I am tired of this It doesn’t change, but it doesn’t stop It doesn’t matter how many tears will be shed, you can laugh Now stop the sadness. (II)\n\n“Do you remember you still have a painful face?” A casual breath, becoming a sigh Why I can’t forget... Finally I understand that for people There’s a past which can’t be separated.\n\n“Is everything alright? From now, yes.” “Is everything alright? It’s not late.” “I am reborn.”\n\n“Throw away the kindness for a little if it breaks your heart.” (III)\n\nA painful and vivid memory of the past Even now, sometimes I insert my heart Don’t lose yourself in memories It doesn’t matter how many tears will be shed, you can laugh Now stop the sadness. (IV)\n\nLet's sing a merry song. Let's dance together. Keep playing until your grief is gone.\n\nUnder the sky, closer to grey I am tired of this I can change because I won’t stop here It doesn’t matter how many tears will be shed, you can laugh Now stop the sadness The light shines on tomorrow. (V)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Jui, the text appears quite simple and contained, fitting with the band’s musical style. The single where the song is features follows a sort of conceptual path about feelings, since the other two songs, ...Murideshita (...It was unreasonable) and She Luvs “Pop Star”, deal respectively with emotions seen by a female point of view and the fanatism in musical world. The lead-track is about an inner conflict between positive and negative thoughts (explaining the presence of lines written in quotes), where the protagonist jumps in and out, finding himself drawn into a maze of memories and pain, which he can’t get out from. So he realizes to have a new goal, which is to find the happiness and the positivity in an hard time, even if he has to leave his past and his feelings behind. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the protagonist having one of his inner thoughts, about his face, become gloomy (”Mata kurai kao shichatte douse kangaegoto nan desho?”); he realizes that it is like that after looking to his self at the mirror, thinking that it is not a good thing for him (GARASU goshi ni utsutta jibun o mitsumete wa/umaku nante ikanai ne...) and he asks if his future will change, whether he uses the same words of the previous day (kinou to onaji SERIFU narabeta/ashita mo kitto kawaranai no desu ka?). He is aware that something is wrong on him and tries to motivate himself (\"Ii desho? kore ijou\"/\"ii desho? ima ijou\"/\"nayami komanakute ii\"), considering himself as unique and irreplaceable, probably as someone has said to him (\"Kono sekai ni kimi wa tatta hitori sa/kimi no kawari o enjiru hito nado inai\").\n\nII) He finds himself under a sky which is almost grey (Kagiri naku nibiiro ni chikai sora no shita de, the grey is symbol of absence of feelings or, more specifically, of depression) and he is tired of living in pain (akiru kurai iya na koto ga aru noni), since it doesn’t change and doesn’t stop at all (kawaranai dakedo tachidomari wa shinai kara). Despite the tears shed, he says that his mate, the reader, can laugh, and asks him to free his mind from sadness (ikura namida koboretatte waraeru sa/ima kanashimi ni todome o).\n\nIII) The protagonist wonders if he ever remembered of having a painful face (\"Mada NIGAi kao shichatte douse omoidashita n'desho?\"), leading a casual breath to become a sigh (nanigenai hitoiki ga tameiki ni kawatta) and to questioning the reason behind his inability to forget the past (wasurerarenai doushite...), and slowly he realizes that each person has a past which he can’t be separated from (youyaku rikai shita yo hito ni wa/hanarerarenai kako ga arutte koto). Being aware of his condition, he realizes that he can be reborn (”Ii desho? ima kara de\"/\"ii desho? osoku wa nai\"/\"umarekawareru no sa\") and that the kindness he used to feel is the cause of his pain (\"Sukoshi kurai yasashisa nagesutete shimaeba ii/kokoro ga oreru kurai nara\").\n\nIV) In his mind one of the memories of his painful past comes out (Tsurakatta azayaka ni nokoru kako no kioku), stimulating in some way his own heart (ima mo kokoro tokiori sashikomu kedo) and he hopes to not being lost in memories anymore (mou nidoto omoide no maigo ni wa naranai). The sequence ends with the repetition of the final lines from the second part.\n\nV) The final sequence starts with a whole strophe written in English and not by case, since it encloses the core message of the text, an invitation to sing, dance and play until the pain fades out (this part might be a sort of signature of the band’s concept), ending with a repetiton of the second sequence, where the protagonist knows that he can change his path (kawareru sa koko de tachidomari wa shinai kara) and that his future can shine (hikari sasu ashita e).\n\nIn troubled times of our life there’s always a ray of light and happiness awaiting for each one of us, which must be found in order to leave behind an hard and painful past. Gotcharocka goes beyond their cheerful style, building up a really mature song, without betraying the positive energy they usually bring on each their work.\n\nThat’s all folks! This is the final post of this 2020 and next year we will be back with new reviews and not only... but don’t forget to stay tuned for the “Album Selection of 2020″!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nREAD OUR RELATED POSTS\n\nREVIEWS\n\nVirginity (19.12.2012)\n\nCrysis (17.07.2013)\n\nPolychrome (14.10.2020)\n\nSPECIALS\n\nGotcharocka - The Clattering Rock\n\nDeleting the Guilt\n\nHere I am with a new song analysis in “Let’s Listen to”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual kei band Scapegoat, precisely one of their less known ones, Deletion noise, released officially as tenth track of their compilation Shokuzai no yagi (Scape goat) on 25th April 2018 (originally it has been released on an omnibus named Explosion Showcase in 2011). The song encloses all the common features seen in this band, such as an energetic sound and a melancholic theme, dealing with an aspect closer to their world.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nAn electronic dark intro and a fast drumming kick off the song, leading up to an highly heavy theme, empowered by aggressive notes; Haru’s voice is psychedelic, but pretty distinctive and articulated despite the track’s style; the song features even melancholic parts, especially in the refrain, in a strong and intense song.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nKono hitomi ni miru mono subete yugande mie hajime shinjiru koto ni obie owari e no Countdown nukumori motomete samekitta kono te ni tsukamu mono Soumatou no you ni mawaru sekai no kioku no danpen ni jibun no ibasho wa doko ni aru no deshou ka? nakusu koto ni tsukare samekitta kono te ni tsukamu mono The sing which the end left, it's sleeper itami ni furueru utsukushiki sekai de yogorete nigoru hitomi Nandomo kurikaesu yume owaru koto no nai ame no naka nureteitemo mou sukoshi dake soba ni isasete kore ga yume nara samenaide nidoto it's days Under the sun are you know I see nothing anymore the sound that a heart is warpet it's seem to be broken the end that began on the oneday all which a out of order Deletion Kazoe kirenai hodo todoku koto no nai tsumi to kimi ga mazariau nugue kirenu namida ni obore nanimo mienai hodo yogore kuchiteku it's days.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nAll the things I see with these pupils appear distorted Fear of believing Countdown Looking for warmth Things to grab with those hands.\n\nA fragment of the memory of the world revolving like a lantern I wonder, where is my place? Tireness of giving up to loss Things to grab with those hands. (I)\n\nThe sing which the end left, it's sleeper (= the song which has left in the end, is sleeping) Shivering in pain Clouded eyes, become dirty in the beautiful world.\n\nA dream which repeats again and again Getting wet in the endless rain Let me stay a little bit closer If this is a dream, don’t wake me up Again it’s days. (II)\n\nUnder the sun Are you know (= do you know) I see nothing anymore The sound that a heart is warpet (= the sound which an heart is warped of) It’s seem to be broken (= it seems to be broken) The end that began on the oneday (= the end that began one day) All which a out of order (= where all was out of order)\n\nDeletion\n\nA countless measure A sin which doesn’t arrive, mixed to you Drown in the tears, which can’t be wiped out Nothing will decay, dirty and invisible It’s days. (III)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Haru, this song sees a quite simple layout, even if there’s something unusual in the parts written in English. If you read carefully, you will see that most lines are accompained by a more proper translation, even for helping in understanding the meaning, as they were grammatically wrong (we don’t know if it was made on purpose or it has been a simple mistaken knowledge of language). Talking about the meaning of the song, is good to note that it has been “officially” released in a compilation entitled like the name of the band, as for representing their true essence (in fact the album is composed by famous hits and several new tracks, mostly coming from live-limited releases or omnibuses) and the content of the text represents perfectly the atmosphere brought by them in all their works. The main theme is the act of deleting, erasing an orrible action made in the past, which starts to haunt who made it; the protagonist of the text lives through this haunting, feeling himself corrupted and damned by his guilt forever, an image which reflects Scapegoat’s concept, based on guilt and sin represented through music. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the protagonist who sees that everything he looks at appears distorted, out of his own reality (Kono hitomi ni miru mono subete yugande mie hajime); he is afraid of believing on what he sees, feeling that his countdown is coming to an end (shinjiru koto ni obie owari e no Countdown, the countdown is a common image for Scapegoat’s songs, indicating the imminent judgement of own sins), so he looks for warmth and any other thing he can get with his hands (nukumori motomete samekitta/kono te ni tsukamu mono). He sees a fragment of the memory of the world, which is revolving like a lantern (Soumatou no you ni mawaru sekai no kioku no danpen ni, in Buddhism the lantern is a symbol of enlightenment and mostly, forgiveness) and starts to wonder what is his own place (jibun no ibasho wa doko ni aru no deshou ka?), feeling himself tired of losing things he cares most (nakusu koto ni tsukare samekitta), keeping to hang on everything he can get (kono te ni tsukamu mono).\n\nII) The song which has left in the end, his own song, has become sleeping, so he is scared of feeling pain (itami ni furueru), while his eyes become dirty and clouded next to a beautiful world, because of his sin (utsukushiki sekai de yogorete nigoru hitomi). Then he describes his own guilt as a dream which repeats continously, wet by an endless rain (Nandomo kurikaesu yume/owaru koto no nai ame no naka nureteitemo); he chooses to not avoid it and to live through it, not wanting to be waked up during the dream, making it last for days (mou sukoshi dake soba ni isasete/kore ga yume nara samenaide/nidoto it's days).\n\nIII) Under the sun he doesn’t see anything more, asking to his interlocutor if he/she knows it; the sound of the song which had warped his heart appears broken (a reference to the image of the previous sequence) and the end, which is coming, puts everything out of order, so he decides to delete everything (likely a reference to death). He defines the measure of his sin countless, impossible to calculate (Kazoe kirenai hodo) and this guilt doesn’t arrive at him, mixing instead with his interlocutor (todoku koto no nai tsumi to kimi ga mazariau, it seems that the person he is talking with is a victim of his, a person beloved to him, who he hurt such in a way, likely with a murder, a not-so-new image for Scapegoat, as they used that concept in most of their musical videos), so he feels to drown in the tears which can’t be wiped out (nugue kirenu namida ni obore); finally nothing will decay, as everything is dirty and invisible for him, leaving his fate without any hope for the future days (nanimo mienai hodo yogore kuchiteku/it's days).\n\nThe sin is something which can’t be erased like nothing, as it stays carved inside anyone, shaping his life from that moment and beyond; Scapegoat goes on with their unique concept, in a song which goes right to the point in expressing how the guilt can be heavy and radical for someone’s life.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nDust of Pain\n\nHere I am with a new song analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual kei duo The Thirteen, precisely White Dust, lead-track of their second single with the same name came out on 29th March 2017. This song reflects the band’s obscure concept, despite the clearer atmosphere and colors that would came out from such song.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nThe song starts with a relevant rhythm and an energetic guitar, leading up to a pretty flowing theme, which shows off an unexpected melodic component; Mao’s voice is fast and balanced, in a performance which brings out some depth, in a catchy and pretty easy song, a bit unusual for the band’s style.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nKaze fuiteru shiroku tsumetai itami o kakushite aruiteru nan no tame ni iki o shiteru shizunde yuku toki to tomo ni ukabiagaru yume no kakera ikikau hito no shinkirou bakari\n\nTsuyoki mono hakanaki mono atashi mo zutto naite imasu “... kawaranai?” “... mou kawaranai.” saigo no serifudeshita\n\nKuzureochiru suna no you ni oto mo tatezu ni hora nakunaru houmatsu no wakare okizari-nin omoide to ka taion to ka takusan karada ni shimitsuiteru futari de aruita michi o nazoru\n\nDenwa-goshi dare ka no kore yukiba o nakushita tori no you ni “kaeranai?” “mou kaeranai.” saibou ga myaku o utta\n\n“Subarashii jinsei datta” to ieru hito o urayami atashi wa ikiru “subarashii jinsei datta to shinenai” kimi ga soba ni inai kara\n\nZetsubou no donzoko ni matsu jibeta haitsukubaru munashi-sa yubikiri mo yubiwa no imi mo hakushi no monogatari\n\nHitori-pocchi sabishi-sa koraeru suki ka douka mo wakaranai mama hitori-pocchi kyou mo yoru ga akeru sora wa harenakute ii\n\n“Subarashii jinsei datta” to ieru hito o urayami atashi wa ikiru “subarashii jinsei datta to shinenai” kimi ga soba ni inai kara\n\nWaraetetan da atashi wa itsumo kimi ga soba ni ite kureta kara nan kai nere ba wasurerareru no sono hi made no yakusoku, sayonara ne.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nThe white and cold pain blown by the wind Walking and hiding Slowly drowning, fragments of a dream emerge Just a mirage of people who come and go.\n\nStrong and frail, I constantly cry “... does not it change?” “... it doesn’t change anymore.” Those were the last words. (I)\n\nIt won’t appear either as to sound like sand grains An ephemeral farewell, leaving people behind Meshed into body like a temperature, like memories Tracing the road walked by two people.\n\nSomeone’s voice on the phone Like a bird who has lost the place where to go “Is coming back home?” “It doesn’t come back anymore.” A cell gives the impulse. (II)\n\nIt can be said: “It has been a wonderful life” I envy people and live “I can’t die and it has been a great life” Because you aren’t in the grains.\n\nI wait in the depth of despair Crawling in the ground, bringing the emptiness A promise or the sense of the ring A story of white paper. (III)\n\nWe bear loneliness by ourselves I still don’t know if you like it The dawn of our night is today I don’t want that the sky is sunny\n\nIt can be said: “It has been a wonderful life” I envy people and live “I can’t die and it has been a great life” Because you aren’t in the grains.\n\nI always laughed Because you were in the grains How many times I sleep and forget Until the promise of that day, goodbye. (IV)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Mao, the song appears quite flowing in reading its text, whose layout is quite plain, but analyzing the single words it can be seen an unique complexity, which makes their comprehension quite hard in some cases (in some lines there were at least three possible translations, so I tried for the simpler one for each of them, trying to stick more to the proper meaning). As always the song must be put in the context of the single where it is released, where the b-sides deal with themes fitting with the band’s concept; precisely, Cinderella uses a reference to the famous tale for describing the briefness of an happy moment, while Girls, be ambitious is about female emancipation in an hard world. Going back to the song analyzed here, the title provides an important element for understanding it more; the white dust is the sand, an important symbol of Japanese culture, linked to the time who passes, the resistance to changes and the purification of soul. Through this image, the song talks about a man, who is living an inner conflict, caused by the memories of his past, of a love which doesn’t exist anymore, and because of its absence, he lets himself go to pain and loneliness, abandoning himself to an illusion. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the image of a white and cold pain, brought up by the blowing wind (Kaze fuiteru shiroku tsumetai itami o kakushite aruiteru), which is walking and hiding in the protagonist’s conscience (nan no tame ni iki o shiteru); while he is drowning in it, the fragments of a dream come out, defined nothing else than a mirage of people coming and going (shizunde yuku toki to tomo ni ukabiagaru yume no kakera/ikikau hito no shinkirou bakari). He defines himself a strong but frail person and says that he cries continously (Tsuyoki mono hakanaki mono atashi mo zutto naite imasu), thinking about the last words told by his loved one, saying that nothing will change anymore (“... kawaranai?”/“... mou kawaranai.”/saigo no serifudeshita).\n\nII) He says that the farewell which brought them to separation doesn’t appear either to sound like sand grains (Kuzureochiru suna no you ni oto mo tatezu ni hora nakunaru), because it is ephemeral, transient and leaves behind people (houmatsu no wakare okizari-nin*), meshed in his body like a temperature or memories (omoide to ka taion to ka takusan karada ni shimitsuiteru), which have been traced the path made by them (futari de aruita michi o nazoru, this line could have a reference to the role of sand in Buddhism, where it is used for creating a soil for meditation, which lines are made on, linked to the image of water; based on this image the second line of this sequence* may be even translated as “leaving behind foam people”, where the foam is another symbol of transience in human life). The focus moves on a voice on the telephone, talking like a bird who has lost his own home (Denwa-goshi dare ka no kore/yukiba o nakushita tori no you ni, the bird is another symbol of transience, referring to a soul who has lost its place), who is replied that he can’t come back home, to the place where he belonged to, even if there’s an impulse of doing it (“kaeranai?”/“mou kaeranai.”/saibou ga myaku o utta).\n\nIII) He claims that it can be said that life has been wonderful for him, despite he has felt envy for other people (“Subarashii jinsei datta” to ieru/hito o urayami atashi wa ikiru); he realizes he can’t die, even if he has lived a great life, as his loved one is not in the sand grains (“subarashii jinsei datta to shinenai”/kimi ga soba ni inai kara). So he waits in the depth of despair (Zetsubou no donzoko ni matsu), crawling in a ground which brings emptiness (jibeta haitsukubaru munashi-sa), wishing for a promise or to a sense for it, rendered by the image of the ring (yubikiri mo yubiwa no imi mo), which is defined a story of white paper, because it has been never made at all (hakushi no monogatari).\n\nIV) He finds himself to live in loneliness, a thing which has to bear by himself (Hitori-pocchi sabishi-sa koraeru), and says that he still doesn’t know if his loved one likes to be alone (suki ka douka mo wakaranai mama); the dawn of their night is coming and he hopes that the sun, the happiness, goes away from the sky, because is illusive (hitori-pocchi kyou mo yoru ga akeru/sora wa harenakute ii). After the repetition of the first part of the third sequence, he ends the text with the image of him laughing because of his loved’s presence in the sand grains (Waraetetan da atashi wa itsumo/kimi ga soba ni ite kureta kara) and he slept so many times for forgetting that it was only a dream (nan kai nere ba wasurerareru no); so he says goodbye to that past, until he can go back to it, to that promise, when he will die (sono hi made no yakusoku, sayonara ne).\n\nAn illusion of a far memory, where happiness and joy dominate the life, which overcomes the true essence of reality, painful and dark; The Thirteen stays true to their dim concept accompaining an energetic rock song to a text which talks in another level, a constant reminder of how good things are transient and not firm in time, as we would like to believe.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nFalling in Pain\n\nHere I am with a new review in “Let’s Listen to”! Today’s subject is the latest release by the notable Japanese band Sads, precisely the eighth album Falling, come out on 21st July 2018. The concept of the release is the image of falling towards the pain and the despair, in a dimension where is hard to get out from. And now... let’s review!\n\n-Ache: the album starts with its first lead-track, opened by an electronic intro, dyed by dark notes and intense vocals; the theme is powerful and adrenalinic, greatly helped by an awesome vocal interpretation, in a great start for the album. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Freely: the second lead-track still features an electronic shade along with Kiyoharu’s powerful vocals, opening to a beating rhythm and a majestic guitar, letting evolve the theme in something more dynamic and engaging, keeping high the level of the release. ---> 9/10\n\n-Gone: this song is opened by a dim intro, along with a cutting drum work and electronic shades, which build up a powerful and aggressive rock theme, accompaining intense and compelling vocals, as expected. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Far away: an high-sounding guitar kicks off this song, with a strong rhythm and a pretty dark atmosphere; Kiyoharu’s voice is soft and melancholic, for an unique ballad, compelling and suggestive as few. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Tell me what you lie: a pounding drumming for this heavy and steady song, the first b-side of their fourth single Spin, where the vocals are really penetrating, with some electronic effect along the road, making them even more seducing; a fascinating track. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-May I stay: the lead-track of the fifth single is opened by a dark piano melody, leading up to a strong and dynamic rhythm, helped by a compelling guitar work; Kiyoharu shows off aggressive and rocking vocals, animating the song in a brilliant way, for a great song, with a great technique. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Spin: the lead-track of the eleventh single starts with grave and soft notes, leading up to a steady and strong rhythm, accompained by a subtle guitar; the vocals are shaded and flowing, becoming more intense and engaging; another great track, domained by the guitar work, especially in the solo part. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Falling down: this song is opened by an aggressive guitar, with strong and steady notes; the vocals are darker, accompained by a deep and chilling bass, helping Kiyoharu’s interpretation in being more compelling. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Breathless: a vibrant guitar opens this song, in an energetic and well rhythmed rock theme; the vocals are fast and balanced, accompained by a good guitar, creating a wonderful harmony in the melody, in a powerful song, with a melting vocal interpretation. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Smily sadly: the album ends with a song which comes back to the electronic side of the release, with a clear guitar and a quite balanced beat; Kiyoharu’s voice is metallic, but anyway relevant, ending pretty well this album. ---> 9/10\n\nFinal Vote ---> 9/10\n\nAbout four years ago Sads came back after the album Lesson 2, released on 2010, with a single which already confirmed that their style wasn’t diminuished at all by the hiatus. Therefore they waited a bit more before unleashing their new full work, an album made of quality and good intentions. Falling mixes up the best of this band’s sound, along with the talent and the experience coming from each member, which resulted in some pleasant experimentation. Kiyoharu’s voice, the core of this band, has grown compared to the early releases, putting up maturer and deeper performances, fitting each track in a surprising way, and who is a fan of his in any of his projects, can’t be certainly disappointed by this album. Unfortunately the band has ceased activities last year, but they decided to greet the fans with a re-release of this album, along with the self cover compilation Erosion, containing most of their hits. So we can hope that the single members will continue in other projects, as they don’t deserve to fade away. An album for who loves Sads’ rocking and compelling music and for who will miss them a lot.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you for another review in “Throwback Thursday”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\n*Hello followers... I started this new year with the first of a long series of posts shelved in the drafts since October... I am sorry for being absent when not needed and I am glad that despite everything, people continues to read my reviews here. THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT GUYS, I LOVE YOU!*\n\nA Curse in Straw\n\nHere I am with the last song analysis of this season in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the dark visual kei band Xaa-xaa, precisely one of their recent works, Noroi uta (Cursed song), the lead-track of the 11th single with the same name, come out on 23th May 2018. The song encloses the darkest shades the band ever used, where the words and the sound have a strong connection, rendered by the unpredictable structure of the song.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nThe song is opened by a piercing guitar and an incredibly steady rhythm, where Kazuki’s voice shows off macabre and violent notes altogether, moving fast and with darker shades, creating a really chilling atmosphere; the melody alternates extreme parts, enriched by screamos, with energetic riffs and a little slow interlude, not put by case inside the theme; the song ends to be structurally dynamic and highly aggressive, worth of this band’s unique talent.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nMijikai hari ga ichi wo sasu masshiro na koromo matoi surudoi aijou ikutsu mo tazusae.

(VI)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Kazuki, the song has a pretty free layout, as for each Xaa-xaa’s work, sign that the feelings and the images lead this text in its own development. In general the band is quite famous for its dark and mysterious themes, and the single where the song has been released is not so different; the b-side tracks, Shiranai, shiranai (I don’t know, I don’t know) and Kage (Shadow), deal respectively with the difficulty in understanding our reality and the shadow as a symbol of someone’s presence, and they fit perfectly with the macabre and disquieting theme of the song here analyzed. The title already contains a key word, the curse, made by the protagonist against a person who caused pain to him, an image vehicled by the song. With the creation of a figure, a straw puppet, the protagonist tries to exorcise and to get away the pain from his own life, even if it is hard to get rid of it. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the image of a needle, the weapon used in the curse, which points to someone (Mijikai hari ga ichi wo sasu), a person who is wearing a pure white cloth (masshiro na koromo matoi, the white is symbol of a visibile thing) and brings up a piercing affection (surudoi aijou ikutsu mo/tazusae, note the final lines of each strophe containing only one word, in this case for emphasizing the action described); then the protagonist says to the reader, the target of his curse, that he is now a straw figure, so that he can keep it on his chest (Anata no sugata wara ni nari/futokoro ni shimaeru hodo), in order to challenge its own pain when he goes out in the forest by night (yonayona tobidase mori e to/mukaimasu).\n\nII) Ironically, the protagonist asks to his target what tree he would use (Dochira no ki ni itashimashou), so that when he chooses the pillar, he can start his ceremony (hashira wo senbetsu sureba/gishiki wo toriokonaimasu/hajimari); during this one, the target will find himself embraced in the corruption, with his right arm (Mazu wa kegare wo dakiyoseta/anata no migi no ude kara, the right side in Japanese culture is linked to the wisdom, the thought and the mind), a choice he will soon regret (sukoshi zutsu yarimasu kara ne/sange wo).\n\nIII) The protagonist starts to violently hit the figure, counting them one after another, while he senses that is made of straw (Hitotsu futatsu/waraeya waraeya iyaiya, the straw is a symbol of frailty, the ease with which someone commits mistakes); then he continues to pierce and starts to hear laments (mitsu yottsu/ugate/itsutsu muttsu/nakeya nakeya iyaiya), but more he goes on, more he realizes that the whole situation is pitiful (nanatsu nanatsu/oki no doku). Then we get to know why the protagonist is doing this curse; this target has put him in the darkest sadness ever, a thing he can’t stand anymore (Kanashikute kanashikute/doushiyou mo nakute), which didn’t allow him to sleep for countless nights, at the point that he doesn’t remember when this pain started (nemurenai yoru kazoe/itsu kara ka? itsu kara ka?) and therefore he became a demon (watashi wa oni ni nari, note the use of the word “oni”, a mythological creature which has been described as a monster which protects people from evil things) and started this violent ritual against his target, object of his cursed song (hitotsu futatsu kugi wo utsu).\n\nIV) He continues to hit the figure and senses a great turmoil around his target (Hitotsu futatsu/sawageya sawageya iyaiya) and while he goes on, feels his screams (itsutsu muttsu/nakeya nakeya iyaiya); then he says that he need a pierced body to expose for his pain more than anything else, as for outbursting his inner rage (Dare yori mo dare yori mo tsukaeteita no desu/mi wo kezuri mi wo teishi) and even if what he has received is unforgivable, the offender still laughs as nothing has happened (yurusanai yurusanai anata ga warau nado), confirming his death sentence, which there’s no escape from (shikeishuu wo nogasanai).\n\nV) The protagonist says that a love which used to be pure, confirming that his offender was a person he loved, has changed its own shape (Muku naru ai wa katachi wo kaeyuki), becoming an ugly figure which can’t be penetrated either by his eyes (keredo kochira ni wa kobiritsuite kienai); so the target begs him to stop this violence (Shi ne/Todome/Hayaku..., this part puts the song’s meaning in discussion, as the text might be interpretated by the offended or the offender’s point of view, so it might be that the protagonist begged his loved one to stop inflicting him pain); finally the protagonist realizes that he will disappear sooner or later, but he won’t cling on to what made him suffer (Kitto sochira ni wa usureyuku mono de/keredo kochira ni wa kobiritsuite kienai).\n\nVI) After repeating the second part of the third sequence, the text ends with the protagonist’s declaration; if his offender will get hurt because of his violent ritual, he won’t see that (Kizutsukeau no nara awanakereba), but now he can’t go back anymore to the deep and dark forest by the night, as when he started the cursed song, because the judgement has been issued (mou hikikaesenai hodo/fukai mori de/yami ni ochita/ushimitsu toki).\n\nWhen someone inflicts pain to someone else, the punishment is unavoidable and cannot be escaped; with macabre and definitive tones, Xaa-xaa brush up the symbology of the darkest side of Japanese culture for an accurate description of a love pain, which leads the protagonist to a violent and obscure revenge, a metaphorical style for saying that none gets away with it.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you tomorrow for the last new review of the season in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nLike a Flower\n\nHere I am with the first part of this month’s themed week in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is one of the most recent works by the Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, named Flower and released as second track of her 17th album M(a)de in Japan on 11th May 2016. The song is incredibly energetic and intense, with a theme dealing with love and an atmosphere which recalls her origins as singer.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nThe song starts with sweet and chilling koto notes, which already have a traditional taste, in a fascinating atmosphere; Ayumi’s voice is seducing and warm, driving the melody, which starts slow and tender, for becoming then more energetic and intense, where the vocals become stronger and more compelling; the song builds up in a solid and flowing structure, with good guitar parts and all the best things that can come out from Ayumi Hamasaki’s unique style.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nMe wo tojite ukanda no wa Koremade no ayunda michi Mou sugu de hana saku koro Ano koro wa tanoshimi datta.\n\nYasashiku waratteta kimi wa Doko he kieta no deshou.\n\nHana ni natte toge wo motte karete chitte kuchi hatetai Hirowanaide hanaretette wasuretette.\n\nAme ni natte kiri ni natte sonomama de nurete itai Yoko ni natte nemuku natte hitori ni shite.\n\nYubi karame aruita no wa Oite kita ano kokyou Ima omoeba shiawase da to Ieru hi mo sugoshimashita.\n\nTe wo hiite kureta kimi no Nukumori ga nokotteru.\n\nTamerawanaide douse nara todome sashite owarasete Warawanaide tsumetai me de uso ga heta ne.\n\nTori ni natte kaze ni notte ano basho wo mezashitai Itami mo nai ai mo nai mukou gawa he.\n\nYasashiku waratteta kimi wa Doko he kieta no deshou.\n\nHana ni natte toge wo motte karete chitte kuchi hatetai Hirowanaide hanaretette wasuretette.\n\nTamerawanaide douse nara todome sashite owarasete Warawanaide tsumetai me de uso ga heta ne.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nWhat comes out when I close the eyes The road we have walked so far Soon it will be the time when the flowers bloom I was waiting for it. (I)\n\nYou are kindly smiling I wonder where have you gone.\n\nI will become a flower with thorns, scattering and withering Don’t gather me, don’t leave me, don’t forget me.\n\nI will become rain, I will become fog, getting wet Lying and getting asleep alone. (II)\n\nWe walked with fingers intertwined That birthplace I left behind Now you think to be happy I spent days for being able to say it.\n\nYou are rejecting my hand There’s still warmth.\n\nDon’t hesitate in any case, stab me and finish it Don’t laugh with cold eyes, you are not good in lying. (III)\n\nI will become a bird, for arriving until that place, riding the wind There’s not either pain or love in the other side.\n\nYou are kindly smiling I wonder where have you gone.\n\nI will become a flower with thorns, scattering and withering Don’t gather me, don’t leave me, don’t forget me.\n\nDon’t hesitate in any case, stab me and finish it Don’t laugh with cold eyes, you are not good in lying. (IV)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by Ayumi herself, the song incarnates the true essence of the album where it has been released and in general of her presence as artist. The main image of the album M(a)de in Japan is a strict connection between Ayumi and her country, Japan, and it can be felt by the kind of sounds contained in the same. In particular this song captures this image and permeates it in each its element, including the text. Starting from the song title, the flower is a key image of Japanese culture, and according to how is described, it might be a peach flower, which symbolizes the immortal love; in the song the protagonist wishes that her loved one shows himself for who he really is, hitting her and not using lies against her, because the truth is less painful than lies and in this sense it was thought that the song might contain an autobiographical reference, as Ayumi has been married twice and in both cases, it went bad. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the protagonist who, when closes her eyes, sees something with her mind, the road that she and his loved one have walked together until that moment (Me wo tojite ukanda no wa/Koremade no ayunda michi), but she remembers that the time when the flowers will bloom is closer, a moment that she waited with great interest (Mou sugu de hana saku koro/Ano koro wa tanoshimi datta)\n\nII) Then she notices that he is kindly smiling (Yasashiku waratteta kimi wa), but at the same time she feels his absence, wondering where he would be (Doko he kieta no deshou); so she decides to become a flower, with thorns, scattering and withering as a flower should do (Hana ni natte toge wo motte karete chitte kuchi hatetai), but she tells him to not gather her, to not leave her and to not forget her (Hirowanaide hanaretette wasuretette), but also to become the rain, symbol of life or memory, and the fog, symbol of loneliness and isolation, getting wet by herself, lying and sleeping alone (Ame ni natte kiri ni natte sonomama de nurete itai/Yoko ni natte nemuku natte hitori ni shite).\n\nIII) Then she recalls when they walked with their fingers intertwined (Yubi karame aruita no wa), when she left her birthplace behind (Oite kita ano kokyou, a sign of Ayumi’s tie with her country), but back to the present, she tells his former partner that now he thinks to be happy without her, a thought she expressed after the days spent together (Ima omoeba shiawase da to/Ieru hi mo sugoshimashita), but he rejected her hand, where there was still some warmth (Te wo hiite kureta kimi no/Nukumori ga nokotteru); finally she invites him to not hesitate, to hit her and to end this situation (Tamerawanaide douse nara todome sashite owarasete), to not smile with his cold eyes, as he is not good in lying as he thinks to be (Warawanaide tsumetai me de uso ga heta ne).\n\nIV) In the final sequence, she wants to become a bird, symbol of freedom, who flies, riding the wind, towards a place where there are neither love nor pain (Tori ni natte kaze ni notte ano basho wo mezashitai/Itami mo nai ai mo nai mukou gawa he) and finally lines from the second and the third part are repeated, ending the text.\n\nWhen we love someone, we try to not see as he is, because unveiling his true nature can be hard to do; in this song, Ayumi Hamasaki portrays the end of a love story, close to her personal life, where she, the flower, gets to be touched by a partner who resulted ambiguous and not sincere, letting her to search for freedom and a distance from pain.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you tomorrow for the next part of this themed week, in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nDying Sphere\n\nHere I am with the first part of this month’s themed week in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual metal band Nocturnal Bloodlust, precisely Sphere, released as seventh and lead track of the first album Grimoire, come out on 29th May 2013. This song is really important for this band’s style, as it shapes up the kind of melodies we hear right now and its theme is deep and made of strong images, well rendered by the musical counterpart.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nA fast piano opens the song, with an intense and pounding rhythm wrapping a beautiful and chilling melody; Hiro’s voice is variable, powerful and thrilling in each note, fitting the mood of each line and building a complex and overwhelming vocal interpretation; the sound is powerful and adrenalinic, with virtuous guitars and beating drums, resulting in a melancholic and extraordinary work of metal music.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nAwai kioku no naka ni tsuki o wasurenai mama Kaze wa fuku koto o tome aoki inochi ga toita. \"Kowashi tsudzuketa kako ni owari no yui sue e to Saisei nozomu mirai omaeno-sen taku wa?“ Mawarumawaru kono sekai no furidashita Tsumi wa hai ni. Dying…dying… It’s suffering this planet will be decayed one by one. Daichi wa karete hanahachiri yuki Yogore tate de sakende himei o ageta. Mienai kizu yo do ka yurushite inochi wa kezure yuku Koko wa mada ikite iru “tomoni ikou” Saa te o tsunagou ikisaki wa “Toru Akira” Tenohira kara afureta tomi, yokubo ga miseru Maboroshino-saki wa. Demise, demise… Destined indication will disappear into blaze is burning the vice blaze is burning the virtue. This planet will be decayed one by one. Justice by the judgment will no longer stop this sacrifice. Justice by the judgment will no longer expose evil lie. Daichi wa karete hanahachiri yuki yogore tate de sakende himei o ageta. Mienai kizu yo do ka yurushite inochi wa kezure yuku Koko wa mada ikite iru ”tomoni ikou” Just standing over there will never change infliction. Asking yourself if it’s right or what to do. A little hand is going to be a hope to save us. Save us all. Nobody hopes this sky. Nobody helps. It’s too late. Nobody knows this scar is yours. The sphere is… Blaze is burning the vice… blaze is burning the virtue… You’re fucking lying to me You’re lying to me. Hibike tamashi no koe, itami no omo-sa o shire.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nI won’t forget the moon in a feeble memory The wind has stopped blowing, I questioned the pale life.\n\n“In the past which continues destroying at the end of the end What future you choose to play again?”\n\nTurning and turning, the world lets the sins falling in the ash. (I)\n\nDying…dying… It’s suffering this planet will be decayed one by one.\n\nThe earth has died and the scattered blossoms has gone away With dirty hands, I threw out a shriek and I screamed.\n\nExcuse me for the invisible wounds Life will be erased.\n\nHere there’s still life, “Let’s go there together”.\n\nNow connect the hands, the destination is “clear”. (II)\n\nThe wealth overflowing from the palm, the desire shows what lies beneath the vision.\n\nDemise, demise… Destined indication will disappear into blaze is burning the vice blaze is burning the virtue. This planet will be decayed one by one. Justice by the judgment will no longer stop this sacrifice. Justice by the judgment will no longer expose evil lie.\n\nThe earth has died and the scattered blossoms has gone away With dirty hands, I threw out a shriek and I screamed.\n\nExcuse me for the invisible wounds Life will be erased.\n\nHere there’s still life, “Let’s go there together”. (III)\n\nJust standing over there will never change infliction. Asking yourself if it’s right or what to do. A little hand is going to be a hope to save us. Save us all. Nobody hopes this sky. Nobody helps. It’s too late. Nobody knows this scar is yours. The sphere is… (IV)\n\nBlaze is burning the vice… blaze is burning the virtue… You’re fucking lying to me You’re lying to me.\n\nThe voice of the resonant soul, the weight of pain are unveiled. (V)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Hiro, the song features a sumptuous layout, even for one of its own kind. The mixed use of Japanese and English is well managed, where each language represents a different side of the song’s mood. A better understanding comes after putting the song inside the band’s context; it has been released in the first full album Grimoire, a fundamental release, as it estabilished the main concept of their following tracks. The decadence of the world is the key image, which we have to add a component of hope, featured in a particular way in this song. The sphere of the title is our planet, the Earth, which is slowly dying because of our sins and lies, but despite of it, there’s a little hope: the will of each one of us for changing the things and improving the condition of our world, but the hope fades because of the inability of acting, seen in the majority of mankind. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the protagonist, who doesn’t want to forget the moon in a weak, feeble memory (Awai kioku no naka ni tsuki o wasurenai mama), but it can’t be avoided, as the wind has stopped blowing (Kaze wa fuku koto o tome) and he finds himself questioning the life, now become pale (aoki inochi ga toita, this part can be translated in two ways, both working; the first one sees the word “aoki” translated as “pale”, synonym of the life coming to an end, while the second sees that word translated as “green”, identifying with the living things of our planet); the protagonist asks to it what future has been chosen to repeat, while the past continues to destroy itself at the extreme end (\"Kowashi tsudzuketa kako ni owari no yui sue e to/Saisei nozomu mirai omaeno-sen taku wa?“) and the world, while is turning, makes falling its own sins in the ash, trying to conceal them (Mawarumawaru kono sekai no furidashita Tsumi wa hai ni).\n\nII) This sequence is opened by two lines in English, used for expressing the inner anger and despair felt by the protagonist; he feels the sense of the death and considers suffering to see that this planet will decays piece per piece; this decadence is killing the earth and the scattered blossoms are going away (Daichi wa karete hanahachiri yuki) and he takes out a scream, while his hands are dirty of the decaying condition of our world (yogore tate de sakende himei o ageta); he excuses for his invisible wounds (Mienai kizu yo do ka yurushite) and underlines that the life as he knows it will be soon erased (inochi wa kezure yuku). But there’s still hope, as a glimpse of life can be still perceived, so he invites his mate to go with him in this living place (Koko wa mada ikite iru ”tomoni ikou”, even this line can be translated in two working ways; the first one sees the verb “ikou” as the simple act of “going”, the most literal one, while the second uses a variant of the verb, meaning “dying”, changing the part from “let’s go there together” to “let’s die there together”, not excluding that the first meaning hinted to the concept of death) and finally he invites to connect their hands, as their destination is now clear (Saa te o tsunagou ikisaki wa “Toru Akira”).\n\nIII) The world is afflicted by the wealth, overflowing from people’s hands (Tenohira kara afureta tomi) and the desire shows what lies beneath the vision of ideal which is hoped to be up (yokubo ga miseru Maboroshino-saki wa); then here starts another part in English, this time longer. As the life is totally immersed in vanity, the death is closer and soon what has been established, the clear destination will vanish forever, burnt by the blaze, which is destroying the vice and the virtue, bringing the world to its destruction; now the sentence can’t be stopped anymore, neither with a single sacrifice and won’t expose the evil lies afflicting the mankind; finally it repeats almost all the Japanese part of the second sequence.\n\nIV) This situation can’t be changed staying there, without acting, while questioning what is right or what must be done. Only a little gesture can give an hope for saving everyone from their damnation, because none hopes for the sky, none helps for making this world better. Therefore it’s too late for doing something, none sees the others’ wounds, making that the sphere where we live in is left in its doomed fate.\n\nV) The final sequence repeates the blaze part of the third one and ends the text with a Japanese line, really enigmatic in its own; now the voice of the resonant soul and the weight of the world’s pain are unveiled and evident to everyone, leaving a possibly open ending in the text (Hibike tamashi no koe, itami no omo-sa o shire).\n\nThe Earth, our planet, the sphere where we live in, is suffering a great pain, because of the evilness, the violence, the deception, the materialism, the destruction of the nature and something has to be done for changing the things, even if none seems to not care about that. In their strength and power, Nocturnal Bloodlust deal with a complex and fundamental subject, which concerns each one of us, reminding that nothing is lost, if something is done and it’s enough a little act for making our world better and brighter.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you tomorrow for the next part of this month’s themed week in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\n🎄Love and Pain in all the Shades🎄\n\nThe existing love of the world is merciless All the people indulge in sympathy and die Love is holy sorrow Love is cruel sorrow Free me from darkness to influence loneliness.\n\nHere I am with the weekly time-travel in “Throwback Thursday”! Today’s subject is the second full album by the visual kei band Sadie, entitled Master of Romance and released on 25th February 2009. The concept of this release revolves around the image of love and pain, expressed in all the possible shades, as suggested by the opening lyrics, belonging to the first track. And now... let’s review!\n\n-Imaginary Creature [devastating love]: the album starts with a deep melody made with piano, accompained by a soft beat and whispered vocals, with some growl during the theme.\n\n-Ice Romancer [love which is cold after a separation]: the main track of the seventh single is one of the most famous themes by the band; the theme is started by a fast drumming, along with a raging guitar playing, building up a powerful metal theme; Mao’s voice is really intense, with mixed tones, from aggressive to clear, driven by a dynamic and powerful melody, empowered by the piercing bass; this song is one of the best tunes by Sadie. ---> 10/10\n\n-Shinigai (Mind’s eye) [finding ourselves in a chaotic world]: an aggressive guitar opens this song, in a strong rhythm and extreme dark vocals; the drums are the core element of the song, in a massive performance, versatile and unpredictable, for a quite decent theme. ---> 8.5/10\n\n-Virtual Fakeman [extreme madness]: Mao’s aggressive voice kicks off this song, maintaining the adrenalinic style of the previous one; the strong bass lines accompain dim and macabre vocals and a relevant electronic component. ---> 8.5/10\n\n-Scarlet [waiting for love]: a melancholic piano introduces this song, strong and decise, in a theme built by a good guitar playing; the vocals are quite metallic, accompained by a strong bass, well fit in a powerful theme, thanks to an astonishing vocal interpretation, for another highlight of this release. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Ageha no nakigara (Remains of a swallowtail butterfly) [choosing for love]: this song is opened by a vibrant guitar, leading up to a theme driven by a soft rhythm, which gradually grows during the song; the main element of this track is the sudden extreme approach with aggressive vocals, coupling once again with a deep bass, enriching once again the whole interpretation of the song. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Crimson Tear [blood tear as symbol of human pain]: another famous theme by the band, coming from their fifth single; the theme is opened by a dynamic guitar, accompaining spoken and dark vocals which explode in a whirl of aggressivity and potency; Mao’s interpretation encloses the best tones possible, inside an intense and powerful metal track. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Kagerou (Heat haze) [everything is transitory]: becoming afterwards the lead of their eighth single, this song is kicked off by a decise metal sound and dynamic guitar riffs; the vocals go on with an unique energy, suiting the theme, catchier and more intuitive than usual, but maintaining the best quality possible. ---> 9.5/10\n\n-Parasite Scene [being weaker is a defeat]: a soft piano along with relevant bass lines open this song; the guitars intertwine in a beating rhythm; the vocals are aggressive, but with a grotesque vibe, making this song quite different but anyway enjoyable. ---> 8/10\n\n-Grieving the dead soul [everything is reflected in our soul]: the lead-track of their sixth single is opened by biting vocals and a fast beat, where the guitars make piercing notes and the pace is quite elevated; once again Mao shows off his best notes, in an impressive vocal interpretation, in part overcome by the heaviness of the melody. ---> 8.5/10\n\n-Swallow Rain [sharing the pain]: a soft guitar opens this song, with a powerful rhythm and an energetic melody; the guitar riffs wrap the theme with their unique intensity, where once again the vocals and the bass drive the song, with clear and bold themes in a powerful track, empowered by the sudden rhythmical change in the finale. ---> 10/10\n\n-Newage Slicer [damaging other people]: the bonus track ends the release with a song driven by an aggressive guitar playing inside an extreme and electronic metal theme, with biting vocals; a decent ending, where the instrumental work is the best feature. ---> 8/10\n\nFinal Vote ---> 9/10\n\nIn the visual kei contemporary history, Sadie is one of the bands which must be mentioned in any case. Since their debut, they showed a brutal and engaging musical style, that allowed them to become more popular in a few time. Master of Romance is a sure improvement of what they showed in their early days, bringing up some of the most important themes of the genre inside a solid tracklist, with some defect bound more to the approach used in a certain kind of melodies. Sadie confirmed their relevance with this second album, giving them more and more success, until that, unfortunately, they went on hiatus two years ago. But nowadays you can hear their style and work in other remarkable projects; Mao and Mizuki founded The Thirteen, with a full album, three singles and an EP, released on October, Tsurugi joined the band Razor, led by Born’s Ryouga, Aki created a solo project entitled Axessory, which released the first EPCall My Name yesterday. An album for who wants to know or to relive Sadie’s best melodies, for not forgetting them at all.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you on Sunday for the week-end special in “Focusing on”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\n*Sorry for the delay*\n\nShadowy Desire\n\nHere I am with our song analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is one of the latest songs by the visual kei band Kiryu, precisely the song Oborozukiyo (Hazy moon night), released as one of the main tracks of the 18th single Jou no hana/Oborozukiyo on 25th October 2017. This song surely belongs to the darkest side of this band, suggested by the style, heavy and obscure, containing a creepy and intense theme inside it.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nA macabre rhythm, given by the drums, kicks off the song, with Mahiro’s voice being fast and piercing inside a pounding and extreme metal sound; the melody is articulated by the drums and by the biting guitars, accompaining an aggressive and obscure vocal interpretation worth of this singer’s creepy style, building up a dark and violent metal theme, with prevalence of screams and aggressivity, as only Kiryu can do.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nOsanagokoro ni tsukisasari nukezu kusari hajimeta ibitsu na kage osanaki hi manaura ni kaeshitemo ITAI ITAI asaki yume to miru koto mo dekizuni fukami ni hamaru ibitsu na kage ikuyo kokoro kawari o kasanetemo mada...

(VI)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nThis song has been written by the guitarist Mitsuki Sakai and in general we can notice a certain complexity in the layout, typical of most of their songs. This aspect is given by the deep traditional approach presented by the band itself, where each componiment and in general each release takes its inspiration from figures and tales of Japanese ancient culture. So, for understanding the sense of the text we should start from the single where it is contained. It is made by four tracks, two lead and two b-sides; the first lead, Jou no hana (Flower of emotions), deals with a brighter theme, which is the power of emotions, while the two b-sides, Onaji ana no mujina (Similiar to a mujina’s lair) and Setsugekka (Snow, sun and flowers), deal respectively with the deception, represented by the mujina, and the cycle of life, represented by the four seasons. All the single has been inspired, according to the band, by the famous Japanese tale called Genji Monogatari and the song we are dealing with is a direct reference to the same. In the eighth chapter of the tale, entitled Hana no en (Festival of cherry blossom), the protagonist has a secret affair with a woman named Oborozukiyo (for hiding his true affair with Murasaki), who was already promised in marriage to the crown prince. After having spent a night together, she, despite of her promise of marriage, feels something for Genji. Through this sequence of the tale, the song deals with the theme of emotions, like in the other lead, but in the darkest approach, generating confusion and doubt inside who feels it and this is explained by the kind of the words used in the text, as we will get to see. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the image of a distorted shadow which is going to decay for penetrating a young mind (Osanagokoro ni tsukisasari nukezu kusari hajimeta ibitsu na kage) and even if she would get back to her youth days, nothing would change, because it hurts much (osanaki hi manaura ni kaeshitemo/ITAI ITAI, note the use of an onomatopeia instead of expressing the pain with normal words, all for emphasizing the image); this same shadow is going to lie in the depth, so that it can be seen like a shallow dream and not like a real thing (asaki yume to miru koto mo dekizuni fukami ni hamaru ibitsu na kage) and it will be still there even if the young girl would still change her mind for many nights (ikuyo kokoro kawari o kasanetemo mada...).\n\nII) Her hands are picking the petals, while caressing the darkness given by the shadow (Yami o naderu te ga hanabira o mushiru, the petals are symbol of the young days going away, because of the presence of the shadow which is draining them away) and these petals, blooming and scattering, stick and smell, as if they died (saite chireba nebatsuite kaoru). The sort-of shallow dream desires a bud, the young girl, (tsubomi o musaboru yume) is overlapping itself for the much feeling it is having (kasaneawase) and actually the hazy red moon is sleeping, not watching what is happening (utsutsu ni madoromu akai oborodzukiyo, this line can be translated in two ways, or translating “oborozukiyo” literally, meaning hazy moon, as in this case, or not translating it, leaving it as the name of the girl Genji had an affair with).\n\nIII) Her screaming voice is piercing the shadow in a bad way (Nakisakebu koe ga mimi ni sasari itamu kara), while it invites to enter and to taste the flavor of her raw meat (nejirikomi fusagimashou namanurui niku no aji); her hand falls in the darkness, while it is trying to pick the petals (Yami ni otosu te ga hanabira o mushiru), which torn and scattered, become coloured and polished by the blood (saite chireba irodzuite aderu); the dream continues to desire the flower, overlapping itself, while actually the evening flower is sleeping, not caring about it (urei o musaboru yume kasaneawase/utsutsu ni madoromu yoi no hana).\n\nIV) The young girl makes resonating her throat, asking for a falseless love, even if she doesn’t understand what really happens (Itsuwari naki ai dearedo satorarenu you ni nodo narasu); behind the skin of a gentle face, there’s hidden a despicable desire (yasashiki tsura no kawa no shita iyashiki yoku no bake no kawa) and when a layer of it is torn away, it becomes irrational and obscene (usukawa ichimai hagitoreba midari ni midara) and so they box it like if it is a destroyed heart, the girl’s one (kokoro kowashite shimawanu you ni hako o tsume futa o shimashou) and in general this gives an important lesson; the pleasure, veiled by pureness, is an irrational and obscene thing (muku o someru sono etsuraku wa midari ni midara).\n\nV) This sequence is opened by a series of words, apparently not connected, but actually they work as keywords for the song’s concept (You fu rai shou mu sui shou/tsuu don haku in jou shu rou); then there’s an invite to make blooming the flowers in the obscure night, while the moon is dyed of deep red, for the blood (Yamiyo ni hana o sakasemashou makka ni somaru yoi no tsuki) and, according to the shadow, if she touches it with her tongue lip, it won’t be irrational and obscene as she thought (yubisaki shitasaki de furereba midari ni midara).\n\nVI) The final sequence starts with a passion which covers people and drowns them in the sew, putting them back and forth in a discontinue happiness (tsuyu ni mamirete oboremashou omote to ura no zetsu to etsu) and if the pain could change its color, it would become irrational and obscene like the thing offered to her by the shadow (itami ga irodzuki hajimereba midari ni midara); after repeating the first line of the second sequence, she will end in begging with tears if would dare to pick the petals (saite chireba nakitsuite haneru); the dream desires of itself, overlapping until it is annihilated (musou o musaboru yume kasaneawase), because at the end she is sleeping, counting only on her figure, rejecting that violent passion (utsutsu ni madoromu yubiori kazoe); the song ends with the repetition of the second sequence.\n\nA wild and shadowy passion, which generates pain, confusion and takes away the best of our beauty, outer and inner. Kiryu uses a famous Japanese tale for telling how much can be dangerous and withering having feelings provoked by a not wanted desire, because desire must be reciprocal for being lived at best.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you tomorrow for a new review in “Let’s Listen to”\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\n*Sorry for the delay*\n\nDesire of Flying\n\nHere I am with a new song analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the young visual kei band Initial’l, entitled Pathos and released as second track of the debut single Moonlight Down on 30th November 2016. This song is probably the closest one to the band’s past style (as they were formerly known as Lycaon) with an energetic sound and a theme dealing with several images and sensations, making it not so simple as expected.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nAn energetic guitar kicks off the song, in a fast and melodious rock melody, with piano parts; Yuuki shows off his clearest notes ever, steaming a lot the whole structure of the song, the refrain is incredibly catchy and rapid, quite remindful of Lycaon’s sound, with good electronic effects and a bright guitar work, for a really good and rhythmical rock track.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nKurai kurai oto mo kieta umi wa Naite mo saken demo hikari ga nai kodokuna heya. Tsubureta risou to yume sore ha zetsubou no shoumei Mamoru beki mono ga nakute bushi nau mono mo nakatta Nani o nozomeba ii no? Nani o shinjireba ii no?

Yoake mai ima nara boku wa Tobitateru ki ga suru yo Fuki nukeru kaze wo kanjite Maiagare kono sora ni.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nThe sea where the dark dark noise fades Crying and screaming, there’s not the light A lonely cage.\n\nA destroyed ideal and a dream, this is a proof of despair There’s nothing to protect, because there isn’t. For what I can hope? In what should I believe? A voice which mustn’t speak turns around the empty of my chest. (I)\n\nI don’t have nothing of what I was looking for.\n\nAs flapping everywhere Even if the future disappears Aiming to a dream which I saw someday This growing pathos. (II)\n\nA rain spear falls in the grey sky which wets for piercing a dry heart.\n\nA rusty emptiness hits the disorder which passes through my heartbeat In the time when a roaring endless trap creaks Everywhere there wasn’t a place where I didn’t want to return So one day I will certainly cut the heavy chains. (III)\n\nFlying everywhere you want from this place.\n\nThe lasting endless future There’s nothing to block Beyond the endless dream What I wanted was the eternity. (IV)\n\nAs flapping everywhere Even if the future disappears Aiming to a dream which I saw someday This growing pathos.\n\nBefore the dawn now as I am I feel to fly away I feel the wind blowing through Soaring in this sky. (V)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Yuuki, this song plays with an apparently simple theme, but it goes down to a more philosophical root, as we can see from the title. The word “pathos”, coming from the ancient Greek (πάθος), represented in the Greek culture one of the moving forces of the human soul, precisely the irrational one, where there are the emotions. It generates the conflicts of the human consciousness, leading up to the choices, typical of the human life. Starting from the technical definition of this secular word, we can unveil the true meaning of this song: the desire of freedom, eternity and elevation from the earthen dimension, which means a complete departure from the pain and the weak points of each man, a thing worth of going through an hard existence. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with the image of the sea where a dark noise, a last sign of hope, fades away (Kurai kurai oto mo kieta umi wa), leaving only a world made of sadness and screams and without the light (Naite mo saken demo hikari ga), a world surrounded by a lonely cage (nai kodokuna heya); this cage is a symbol of a destroyed ideal, of a past dream, a proof of the despair lived by the protagonist (Tsubureta risou to yume sore ha zetsubou no shoumei), who is aware which there’s nothing worth of protection anymore (Mamoru beki mono ga nakute bushi nau mono mo nakatta), questioning himself about what he should hope for (Nani o nozomeba ii no?) and what he should believe in (Nani o shinjireba ii no?) and the voice of his pain, getting him in discomfort, which must not to speak, turns around the empty spot left in his chest, his deep wound (Kotoba ni naranai koe ga mune no suki ma sora mawaru).\n\nII) He doesn’t have anymore what he was looking for, the happiness (Soko ni wa motome teta mono nani mo nai kara, the concept of nothing and of empty is recurring in this text) and he, as he is flapping everywhere (Doko made mo habataku you ni), even if the future disappears in front of him (Moshi mirai ga kiete mo), he is aiming for a dream he saw a day (Itsuka mita yume o meza shite), the same dream which has gone, generating in himself a growing pathos, with the emotions, the bad ones, winning over the rest (Mai agaru kono pathos).\n\nIII) A rain spear, recalling his past, falls in the grey sky (Gurei no sora ni ame no yari ga ochite), whose wet presence is piercing his dry heart (Kawaita kokoro o uchi nuku you ni nurashite yuku), afflicted by a rusty emptiness which brings in each single beat a piercing disorder (Sabitsuku sukima kugutta kodou made midare uchitte); and in the time when the roaring endless trap, his pain (represented by the mentioned cage), starts to creak, to fail (Hoto bashiru mujou no wana kishima reta toki no naka de), he, aware that there isn’t a place where he wouldn’t want to return (Doko ni mo ibasho nakatta modoritai basho nakatta), is sure that one day will cut the heavy chains which hold him in his grief (Dakara sou sa itsuka kitto omoi kusari tachi kitte).\n\nIV) His desire is flying in any place he wants from where he is now (Doko demo tonde yukeru yo kono basho kara), looking for a lasting endless future (Hateshinaku tsudzuku mirai wa), where nothing has to be blocked (Saegiru mono wa nai yo) and going beyond the endless dream he was aiming for (Owaranai yume no mukou de), what he really wants is the eternity (Nozonda no wa eien).\n\nV) In the final sequence there’s a repetition of the second part of the second one, followed by an ending part, unveiling the real aspiration of the protagonist; before the dawn, as he is now (Yoake mai ima nara boku wa), he feels to fly away (Tobitateru ki ga suru yo), he feels the wind which blows through him (Fuki nukeru kaze wo kanjite), soaring in the sky (Maiagare kono sora ni), where he will be finally free from his painful condition.\n\nPathos as vehicle of emotions, hard decisions and struggling choices, which unevitably lead to pain and grief, at the point that it is better to fly away, free and eternal. Initial’L differs from Lycaon, as there is not only the love seen as thing in itself, but there is something more existential, more cosmic, more relevant for the soul, going to a more platonic dimension, making this song more compelling of what it seems.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you tomorrow for the weekly review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nLiving for the Universe\n\nHere I am with the first part of June’s themed week in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is the latest song released by the visual kei band Diaura, entitled Universe and released exclusively during the live performance Dictatorial Garden Nakano -Beyond the resistance- on 18th February 2017. This song is less complex than their typical componiments, but its style and theme are really flowing and efficient, with a positive subject revolving around the same.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nA powerful guitar playing introduces the theme of the song, quite fast and rhythmical, well developed by the single instruments; Yo-ka’s voice is clear and appealing, alternating slow tempos with more energetic ones, accompained by interesting guitar riffs; in general the song has a simple structure, but it flows pretty well, especially thanks to the intense guitar work.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nI sing for you belive'n universe still I live...still I live... owari naki butai no ue de kizu tsukinagara soredemo hikari e mata fumidashite iku.

(VI)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten as expected by the singer Yo-ka, the song results simpler than the typical ones of theirs, even if it transmits the ethereal and religious thought which this band brought up in each their componiment. For understanding the meaning we can start from the title word, universe, which, as the same suggests, embraces a wide typology of meanings, but generally it is the totality of the human life and the world, an image which is surely linked to the band’s particular concept. And the music exists for the purpose of transmitting the unique sense that this universe carries on to whoever wants to receive it, as symbol of vitality and desire of going forward, against any wound received. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text starts with two lines written in English, making evident the core theme of the same; the protagonist sings for someone he cares of (or generally to the listener), who believes in the universe and thanks to this melody he can still live in an infinite stage (owari naki butai no ue de, from here the Japanese starts and the line itself is linked to the strong relationship between Diaura and the audience), even when he carries on his wound to the light (kizu tsukinagara soredemo hikari e) and is going to make a step forward in his life (mata fumidashite iku).\n\nII) The protagonist asks to whoever listens to him of not ever leaving his hand which was strongly connected, in the days of strong rain and even in the ones with a grey sky and without any light (Tsuyoi ame no hi mo hikari no nai haizora no hi ni mo/kesshite hanasazu ni boku no te wo tsuyoku tsunaide ite kureta ne) and despite his songs are like if are left behind in the shadow of the distant, past days (tooki hi no kage ni okizari ni sareta mama no uta mo), he knows that he won’t ever fade and reveals himself as a steady person, aware of his resources (kesshite iroasezu yuruginai boku wo utsushidashite ita), a sign of strong consciousness.\n\nIII) The protagonist feels an extreme impulse of throwing out his anger and pain in a savage way (Mouzen to hakidasu shoudou, where the verb “hakidasu” literally means “to vomit” or “to spit”, but in a poetical way can be translated even “to throw out”) while he turns around the sky (karakara to sora mawaru, meaning while he continues to live); this impulse is satisfied with his voice, which downpours (like the mentioned strong rain) towards the next instant, the future (Furisosogu koe tsuginaru toki e), where the night runs away from his control (kono yoru wo kakete yuku) and finally he, even if he will lose everything of the absent world, will follow his loved one (mu no sekai de nani mo kamo wo ushinatte mo/kimi e to tsutau).\n\nIV) This sequence is equal to the the first one.\n\nV) In his life he has received comforting words and a thoughtless affection (Nagusame no kotoba mo kokoro nai aijou mo) and during the days which reject everything (nani mo kamo wo kobamu hibi ni) he wonders if he will carry on his shoulders the wounds received on his life and where he will eventually go (‘doushite boku wa ikiru no/kizu wo shoi doko e iku no?’/toikake teta, symbol of a strong pain that it creates uncertainity on the future); but the answer of this question is cryptic and cunningly twisting (Koukatsu ni nejimagaru kaitou) and he tries to understand it, while is turning around the sky (meaning that he tries to understand the sense of his existence while he is living it).\n\nVI) The final sequence repeats the third and the first one.\n\nUniverse as something infinite, wide and impossible to embrace completely while we live, as there are wounds, pain and hard times; Diaura simplyfies their musical approach, dealing with a not so predictable and remaining in their fascinating and enigmatic style, giving a message of courage and hope of going forward for brighter days.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you tomorrow for the weekly review on “Let’s Listen to”, while the themed week will continue next week!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\nThe Echo of Past\n\nHere I am with the song analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual metal band Mejibray, precisely their longest one so far. Its title is Echo and it has been released as ninth track and lead theme of their second album The “420″ Theatrical Roses. Probably one of the most peculiar songs of the band, because of the melodious sound, a rare thing for them, and above all for the theme, always dealt in pure Mejibray-ish style, which is not the usual dark and gritty one.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nA melancholic melody opens the song, featuring a pretty energetic and deep rhythm (the last example of this style can be seen in another ballad, Emily, even if in a minor way); Tsuzuku here shows off that he is capable not only to scream and growl, but even to calm and touch the heart of who listens to his voice, with tender and limpid notes (in some cases it appears like that there’s another singer instead of him). In general the song is well articulated in almost seven minutes time, for a innovative and fascinating ballad, where the mix between classical and electric guitar is sublime (not by case the guitarist MiA composed this song); in few words, Echo is a splendid ballad, a touch of epicness for this band.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nMe wo somuketa sumishi hi to temaneki suru mukuna ito tozasareteta sukima kara utsusareta “higeki?”\n\nKotoba ni sureba kako e to okuru kujuu no hanamuke de shika… omoide saemo garasu no you ni hifu wo kirisaku yo\n\nKimi ga nozomu nara nozomu katachi ni narimashou somukete kita kako ga oto ni yureta me mo awaserarezu muon ni mimi wo somuketa kimi no ima mo shitteru kara\n\nMata kyozetsu wo hajimete waratteru furi wo shitara kimi wa naku no? soretomo waratte kureru no?\n\nOchite yuku youni motomeau yubi kodomo no youni naiteta kimi no sonzai ga kowarenu youni mabuta wo tojita.\n\nKimi ga nozomu nara nozomu katachi ni narimashou fui wo tsukare naku… soto wa ame 『Anata ga inai to watashi ga kiete shimau』 kyouizon no zankyou.\n\nTotsuzen kimi ga shinde shimau nara boku wa anshin suru deshou mou naku koto mo kurushimu koto mo nai aisuru koto mo…\n\n『Suki da yo』 nante kotoba ni shita setsuna somukete kita kako ga oto ni yureta.\n\n『Aishiteru kara』kuzureru kimi wo dakishimeta fui wo tsukare naku…soto wa ame.\n\n『Anata』 ga nozomu nara nozomu katachi ni narimashou yubiori kazoeru kuuhaku wa… mienai asu ga fukai yami da to shite mo kako ga ima saita no sa owarinaki ana e ochiteku…\n\nKawaita ame no ato towa to shizuka ni tsunda.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nOnce that I turned away, in these clear days A thread of innocence came beckoning Was that the “tragedy” which slipped through the cracks that I have shut out? (I)\n\nIf I put it in words, I can only send a sour farewell gift to the past And the memories of this will pierce me through my skin, like glass. (II)\n\nIf you want, I will become whatever you want me to be The past which I turned away from is shaken by this sound Unable even to have sight contact, I stopped to listen to the silence Because I know your pain too. (III)\n\nIf I pretend to smile when once again I begin to shut out everything Will you cry? Or will you smile to me?\n\nOur fingers sought themselves each other as we were to fall You cried like a child and I didn’t want to ruin that image So I closed my eyes. (IV)\n\nIf you want, I will become whatever you want me to be Caught by surprise, I cried… there is the rain outside. “If you are not here with me, I will disappear” An echo of codependence. (V)\n\nIf suddenly you were to die I would be surely relieved I wouldn’t have any reason for crying, or for suffering, or for loving… (VI)\n\n“I like you” A moment condensed in the words The past which I turned away from is shaken by this sound.\n\n“Because I love you”, I held you as I were in pieces Caught by surprise, I cried… there is the rain outside. (VII)\n\nIf “you” want, I will become whatever you want me to be I can count the free spots on my fingers Even if a deep darkness waits in the future which I can’t see yet The past is bloomed now And it is falling in an endless abyss… (VIII)\n\nI gathered calmly the vestige of the wet rain Along with eternity. (IX)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Tsuzuku, in general the song features all the typical aspects of Mejibray’s songs: a sad and dark theme, related to love, a strong psychological component, which always accompains their music and an efficient layout, with simple but strong lines. But in Echo there's something more: the theatricality. In fact, it has been released on the second album, explained by the band like a theatrical piece, with a great attention to the expressions and to the writing style, which reinforces their psychological approach (in this song there are some examples that we are going to see). The theme of the song can be found in the title; the echo is something which can be heard at great distances, which is less strong as soon as we go further. It can be associated to a memory, an image, a feeling or more in general, to the past itself, which appears as something not closer to us, but anyway relevant for our life. But in this case it is a painful one (in particular related to love) and it resonates in eternity, like an echo indeed. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text opens up with a sort of prologue of what the song will deal with; the protagonist perceives that, once he turned away his sight from the clear days (Me wo somuketa sumishi hi to), a thread, a short sign of innocence appeared in that moment (temaneki suru mukuna ito), a possible sign of the tragedy (higeki, written between inverted commas for a specific purpose, linked to the theatrical approach mentioned above), which is approaching by the cracks he shut out from his life, the inner wounds of his past (tozasareteta sukima kara utsusareta), an important psychological hint.\n\nII) If he tried to put in words what he really is feeling (Kotoba ni suteba), he might only send a sour farewell gift to the past (kako e to okuru kujuu no hanamuke de shika..., synonym of the difficulty of being freed by his weight) and so the memories bound to the same (omoide) will pierce his skin deeply, like the glass (saemo garasu no you ni hifu wo kirisaku yo), painful than ever.\n\nIII) In the refrain sequence, the protagonist tells to the loved one that, if she wants (Kimi ga nozomu), he will become whatever she wants him to be (nara nozomu katachi ni narimashou), sacrifying completely who he really is; the past which he turned away from (somukete kita kaka) has been shaken by a sound (oto ni yureta), which can be the sound of pain or love, which echoes continuously, and he, being unable to have a sight contact (me mo awaserarezu, with the loved one), decides to stop to listen to the silence (muon ni mimi wo somuketa, note the contrast between oto and muon), because he knows the pain of who he loves too (kimi no ima mo shitteru kara).\n\nIV) In this sequence the protagonist asks to his loved one what she would do if he pretended to smile when once again he will begin to shut out everything (Mata kyozetsu wo hajimete waratteru furi wo shitara); will she cry (kimi wa naku no?) or will she smile at him (soretomo waratte kureru no?), another image contrast; their fingers sought themselves each other for long time, as if they were to fall apart (Ochite yuku youni motomeau yubi), towards a dark abyss, as we will see afterwards, but he couldn’t ruin the image of the loved one crying like a child, symbol of innocence (kodomo no youni naiteta kimi no sonzai ga kowarenu youni), so he closed his own eyes, leaving everything behind (mabuta wo tojita).\n\nV) After repeating the first line of the third sequence, he, caught by surprise, cried, while it was raining outside (fui wo tsukare naku… soto wa ame, in a good image analogy); and inside himself, he knows that if the loved one is not with him, he will disappear (『Anata ga inai to watashi ga kiete shimau』, notice that the whole line is written between brackets for a major emphasis to the interiority of the protagonist), as result of a echo of codependence (kyouizon no zankyou), since one cannot exist without the other one, the basis of real love.\n\nVI) But if he felt that the loved one is going to die (Totsuzen kimi ga shinde shimau nara), he would be relieved of that (boku wa anshin suru deshou), not because he doesn’t love her anymore, but because he wouldn’t have any reason for crying (mou naku koto mo), for suffering (kurushimu koto mo nai) or for loving (aisuru koto mo…), in few words he would prefer to not feel anything rather than having pain.\n\nVII) This sequence is the most psychological one of the text, where the protagonist literally explores his deepest thoughts; when he realized that he liked her (『Suki da yo』), that single moment was condensated by the words (nante kotoba ni shita setsuna), which had shaken his past (like in the third sequence), but when he knew that he loved her (『Aishiteru kara』), he held her as she was going to be in pieces (kuzureru kimi wo dakishimeta) and he cried like in the fifth sequence.\n\nVIII) Repeating once again the first line of the third sequence (where the word anata is written between brackets, as something which doesn’t belong to his reality), the protagonist says that he can count the free spaces between his fingers (yubiori kazoeru kuuhaku wa…), because her hand is not there anymore; even if in the future which he cannot see yet there’s the deep darkness (mienai asu ga fukai yami da to shite mo), his past has bloomed again (kako ga ima saita no sa) and it is falling in a endless abyss, because it doesn’t exist anymore (owarinaki ana e ochiteku…).\n\nIX) The final sequence is made only by two lines, which are cryptic and quite hard to understand; he says that he gathered the vestige of the wet rain, with a deep calm (Kawaita ame no ato), along with the eternity (towa to shizuka ni tsunda); the most probable meaning is that he took what remained of his soul and decided to go in the eternity, so he died and he doesn’t belong anymore to this world, giving a sad epilogue to the text.\n\nA love feeling between two people which echoes even in the most distant place and time, even where the mortal life ends; Mejibray literally reached a deep dimension of the heart with a compelling and passionate ballad, built around the concept of real and eternal love, something which doesn’t belong to our limited perception of existence.\n\nThat’s all folks! See you tomorrow for a review in “Let’s Listen to”!\n\nThanks for the reading!\n\n*Sorry for the delay*\n\nBrotherly Love\n\nHere I am with the lyrical analysis in “Lyrical Love”! Today’s subject is a song by the visual symphonic metal band Versailles, named Philia and released as lead-track of their on 16th March 2011 and afterwards on their third album Holy Grail. A song which incarnates perfectly the essence of this band, both in music and in theme, enclosing the features which represent them at best: virtuosism, potency and passion, united with a theme linked to the best human feeling ever.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nA triumphant opening, with the powerful guitars by Hizaki and Teru, kicks off this track, showing off the strongest shades which always characterized Versailles’ music; then Kamijo comes in, with his fascinating voice, suggestive from the first notes, building up an interpretation driven by passion and energy; in an incredible rhythm, the song creates up on itself, in an engaging and, as predicted, incredibly technical and virtuous structure, which it has only to be appreciated completely.\n\nLyrics (Romaji)\n\nAi ni michita rougoku he kokoro ibara no kusari Mitoku dakede tsukurareta Semaku kurushii sekai Tozasareta haitoku ga torawareta ai wo sabaku Shinjiru koto aisuru koto sou ikiteyuku koto Kono sakebi, kono itami daitakeshitekure Tomadoi koroshite aishitai Tozasareta sekai kara miageta sora Kono yoru ni, kono yami ni hikari sasu mede wa Kageru tsuki ga kimetsuketa Sadame kokoro ni kodama suru Tozasareta haitoku to gensou ga yume wo sabaku Arashi no naka rintosaite, sou tsuyoku kedakaku. Kono sakebi, kono itami yoru ni kieteyuke Komazoi koroshite kanaetai Tozasareta sekai kara miageta sora Egaita miraide yami wo kirisaite Osorenaide minikusa wo kaku sazu ni ikiru koto de Hito wa motto tsuyoku dareru, Ah... hinikuna mono ne? Hanayaka ni, utsukushiku ikitayuki takute Kurushisa, kuyashisa dakishimeta Nozomarete aisarete shinji aeru nara Kono yoru ni kono yami ni itsuka sakihokore. Dispel days of the dark. Need your love. Feel it in my soul Dispel days of the past. Undo the chain for now. Break the spell.\n\nLyrics (Translation)\n\nThe heart, filled with love, is closed in a prison made by thorny chains Made from virtue This little world full of pain.\n\nTrapped in the immorality - love is judged I have trust and I love, so I am still alive. (I)\n\nPlease, embrace me and delete that scream, that pain I want that the love destroys all the confusions From the enclosed world, I looked up the sky This night, even the darkness will be completely illuminated. (II)\n\nThe clouded moon has decided My destiny will resonate in my heart.\n\nThe trapped illusions and the desires are judging my dreams During the storm I will bloom proudly, strong and noble. (III)\n\nThat scream, that pain, let that they disappear in the night I still want to help myself in destroying all the confusions From the enclosed world, I looked up the sky Tearing the darkness which appeared in my colorful future. (IV)\n\nDon't have fear anymore, without hiding the ugliness People is becoming stronger Ah... is it not an irony?\n\nI wanted to live beautifully, brillantly I embraced all these sufferings and preoccupations Desirable, loved, if only we would trust each other In this night, in the middle of this darkness, we will completely bloom. (V)\n\nDispel days of the dark. Need your love. Feel it in my soul Dispel days of the past. Undo the chain for now. Break the spell. (VI)\n\nTHE WORDS\n\nWritten by the singer Kamijo, this song, as all the songs made by Versailles, and in general by him, present a peculiar structure, since the syntax and the order of the words can appear extremely weird (in fact my translation can provide only a general meaning of the song, where the literal meaning of each word couldn’t have a precise sense and can appear out of context), but the meaning can be easily understood. For a better comprehension, we should start from the title, philia; this word, coming from Ancient Greek (φιλία), represents one of the four love concepts of Greek culture, the brotherly love, or more simply, the friendship. But more in general the song has at its roots the concept of love, a force which destroys any pain and confusion and illuminates the life of whoever feels it totally. And now... let’s analyze the song!\n\nI) The text opens up with a direct reference to the protagonist’s heart, which, filled with love, is imprisoned in a prison made of thorny chains (Ai ni michita rougoku he kokoro ibara no kusari), a prison made of pain, like the "
