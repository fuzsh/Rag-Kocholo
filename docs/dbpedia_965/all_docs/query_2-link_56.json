        "text": "Game over, no-one wants to admit they lost\n\nTake over, gotta win no matter the cost\n\nSo let’s go the whole mile, party on in style, gotta be the number one\n\nStartin’ over from rock bottom, live a life that’s so damn grand\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nAlways so close, yet so far you pass by\n\nLeaving me here cast aside\n\nSo why’d you do it to me?\n\nCan’t hate my dreams though they’re all left to die\n\nEven a stray has his pride\n\nNever been down in the gutter so deep\n\nLike a kid tryin’ to crawl his way off the heap\n\nWhat’s left here for me, headin’ for the city\n\nJust a future I can’t start to see\n\nSo let’s go the whole mile, party on in style, gotta be the number one\n\nStartin’ over from rock bottom, live a life that’s so damn grand\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nLived my life choking the words out the throats\n\nOf people who can’t say a thing\n\nI’m stuck here on this see-saw\n\nFeeling my nerves wanna sink and then float\n\nIn booze and anaesthesia sting\n\nWhen street scum starts thinkin’ they ought to rule\n\nThen sometimes justice has gotta be cruel\n\nThough suffering and damned, with knife in my hand\n\nI’ll make a new age for this land\n\nSo let’s go the whole mile, party on in style, gotta be the number one\n\nStartin’ over from rock bottom, live a life that’s so damn grand\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nAnd though this story feels so burdened by despair\n\nWe can soar and fly free of the shadow of night to\n\nReach the future I know is waiting for us there\n\nA legend forged in light\n\nThough they try and make you fall, just keep on ridin’ tall, you\n\ngotta be the number one\n\nKeep on fightin’ for your dreams and take ’em on from where you stand\n\nThough you might be real lame, with nothing to your name, be\n\na Hero for everyone\n\nStartin’ over from rock bottom, live a life that’s so damn grand\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nTrapped within the eternal spiral deep below\n\nIs the light that lurks sealed away\n\nAre the chains that keep it at bay\n\nBut the devil’s there whispering what I want to know\n\nHow the seal may be undone\n\nOf untold pleasures to be won\n\nWarnings ringing out in my ears\n\nDesires winning out over my fears\n\nBy my hand, forbidden gates have disappeared\n\n-What have I awoken…?-\n\nAwake in the Dark\n\nJudgement day has arrived, no longer will I be denied\n\nAll I need is you, to be here by my side\n\nI wanna watch the world burn, to see it torn apart\n\nTill nothing stands in the way of our new start\n\nWhen the war was won, this world was ours to remake\n\nFrom the ashes our heaven grows\n\nFrom the ruins of all we know\n\nCutting through the grey skies that lie in our wake\n\nTogether we will make anew\n\nA beautiful world for just me and you\n\nWarnings ringing out in my ears\n\nCan I even trust the words I hear?\n\nWatching me lose myself, the devil sneers\n\n-Our deal had a price…?-\n\nthe End of the Dream\n\nNow the Eden we built, our new world, our brand new start\n\nAll that we have made, just starts to fall apart\n\nAh, but there is no going back, the world that we once knew\n\nIs the price we paid for a dream that can’t come true\n\nYou belonged in the dark, I joined your fate\n\nAll we gave, all our love, and all our hate\n\nBalancing on the scales, is it too late?\n\nWhat is god’s judgement now…?\n\nWho knows?\n\nthe Fate of the World\n\nWe will roar, we will yell, we will rage with the fires of hell\n\nAgainst the wings of light, we know we must rebel\n\nNow, let your fangs tear them apart, let our love be made true\n\nTogether our hearts will sing, a new era will begin\n\nThat miracle will rebuild this world anew\n\nIn the darkest, emptiest depths of my heart, there’s the look in my eyes\n\nMy breath held tight, drawn in as deep as the ocean’s floor\n\nThe pain tugging at my heart seems to spill out\n\nAnd as you walk away, all that comes from my lips is\n\n“Goodbye”\n\nMy heart has nothing to do but wander in the dark\n\nHeld in isolation’s cruel grasp\n\nAnd so I walk\n\nWith my heart being wrenched apart\n\nBattered by the winds, till this dreary grey city\n\nIts people\n\nAnd their dreams\n\nAll seem to crumble from my vision\n\nBut even as I stumble and trip in my anguish\n\nI keep on walking by\n\nThere’s a light waiting for me, one free of this sorrow and pain\n\nAnd as my heart burns empty\n\nThe breath that escapes me turns to brilliant light\n\nAnd I want the light within my heart\n\nTo grip me tighter, tighter, tighter yet\n\nI’ve wandered so long, hiding my heart away\n\nShedding tears without ever knowing why\n\nBut when I’ve no tears left to shed, I gaze up\n\nAt all the stars there shining in the sky\n\nEvery one of them shining without end\n\nAnd the part of me that only valued what I couldn’t see\n\nSeems to melt away in their light\n\nThe diamond dust shines in the dark sky\n\nIt’s light blooms for just a fleeting moment\n\nAnd small as it may be\n\nIt leads me back to you\n\nIn this moment, I want to be as only I can be\n\nLetting my light shine forever more\n\nSo stay by my side\n\nIt’s your eyes I want watching over me\n\nIf you can feel what’s inside my heart\n\nThe feelings welling up inside me\n\n“I love you, I love you”\n\nThen I know this light within is real\n\nJust you being there\n\nSeems to change this pain inside into love\n\nWhen I’m pressed against you, the light and dark inside\n\nSeem to blend enough to let me move on again\n\nI want to believe in what that first step will bring\n\nAnd it’s what I’ve been through that\n\nlets me know\n\nThat these tears\n\nwon’t come back again\n\nThe diamond dust hangs in the dark sky\n\nIt shines with such beauty\n\nAnd small as it may be\n\nIt leads me back to you\n\nThat light blooms for just a fleeting moment\n\nBut it will keep shining inside me\n\nAnd I wish that it will watch over me on those silent, still nights\n\nIf I can share with you what’s inside my heart\n\nThe feelings welling up inside me\n\nThen I’ll send them to you, I’ll send them to you\n\nI’ll give them voice, and send them in my song\n\nHere within the lightless, deepest depths\n\nEvery step treads the bloodied sands down deeper\n\nI cannot even remember why I shed these tears now\n\nPulled along by this cruel fate that constrains me\n\nMy monologue echoes, filled as I am with hatred and despair\n\nStill I cling to this shattered song through all these countless cycles\n\n“Destroy me, o hunter”, let my end and my tragedy be as falling petals\n\nIf to relinquish my dream truly is to be my fate\n\nA lingering emotion still walks here\n\nEvery step treads the bloodied sands down deeper\n\nI cannot even remember why I felt so close to you\n\nWith the howling lament of the stars echoing inside my head\n\nDoubtful ideologues, will your words take melody as they cross time?\n\nWhile I cling to my eroded limbs through all these countless cycles\n\n“Destroy me, o hunter”, let my end and my tragedy be as falling petals\n\nIf to relinquish my dream truly is to be my fate\n\nMy monologue echoes, no matter how much I am torn apart\n\nThese countless wills shall be heard, if that is what those I love desire\n\nFly high, fly strong, chosen heroes!\n\nLet your wings take flight, in search of the untold dawn!\n\nIn force, we fill the skies\n\nDespite the fearsome hordes ahead\n\nIn combat, we never look back\n\nAnd fight to our last breath!\n\n(We go now, listening to our hearts!)\n\nOur wings carry such faith\n\nThat no cruel destiny can frighten us\n\nThe storm approaches, the flames bare their fangs\n\nFor judgement day is here!\n\n(So stand tall!)\n\nFor my world, for your dream\n\n(The time has come)\n\nListen to the distance so far away\n\nAnd you will hear your comrades\n\nSo let’s go, with our voices raised high!\n\nOh here we are, this blue planet of ours\n\nOh here we are, is covered by terrible darkness\n\nOh here we are, but I promise you this, my friend (right here and now)\n\nOh here we are, I swear it on my very soul\n\nThat one day, we will return here (I know we will)\n\nAnd bring an end to all this fighting (And then…)\n\nWe will live together, in peace, on this planet we call home…\n\nThis wounded world waits (for one alone)\n\nFor you, and none other\n\n(It’s waiting for you, waiting for you to…)\n\nTake the light of our dreams we bestowed\n\n(We give you the light, we give you our dreams, take it…)\n\nAnd fly, fly high once more!\n\nIn force, we fill the skies\n\nDespite the fearsome hordes ahead\n\nIn combat, we never look back\n\nAnd fight to our last breath!\n\nOur wings carry such faith\n\nThat no cruel destiny can frighten us\n\nThe storm approaches, the flames bare their fangs\n\nFor judgement day is here!\n\n(Now stand tall!)\n\nThe dreams we fought for,\n\nThe path we chose to walk,\n\nWithout fear or doubt, we follow them now\n\nAnd by our hands the light will fill this world!\n\nThis wounded world waits\n\nFor you, and none other\n\n(It waits only for you)\n\nTake the light of our dreams we bestowed, and\n\n(With the dreams we bestowed at your side)\n\nFly, fly high!\n\nFly high, fly strong, chosen heroes!\n\n(Fly, soar, ever higher!)\n\nLet your wings take flight, in search of the untold dawn!\n\nOur Kingdom will rise with the dawn!\n\nCan you hear me say “thank you”?\n\nCan you hear my song, see this part of me laid bare?\n\nWhen I close my eyes, I can still see you\n\nBecause you were closer to me than anyone\n\nCan you hear me say “I love you”?\n\nCan you hear my voice, hear my heart speak?\n\nRealizing I’ll never feel your touch again\n\nIt seems unreal, like a bad dream\n\nAnd I can’t move on from here, not yet\n\nWhat will the world be like without you?\n\nHow will the dawn’s rays look, how will they feel?\n\nI’ve never felt this kind of sadness before,\n\nnever felt my breath strangled in my throat\n\nYou were so reckless, and such a brat\n\nA handful, yes, but does that matter now?\n\nI thought I knew you inside and out\n\nBut now I realize how little I must have known\n\nSo can you hear me ask “Why?”\n\nCan you hear my song, can you see my tears?\n\nWe thought we’d share our entire lives together\n\nWe fought, but we were always the closest of friends\n\nCan you hear me say “I miss you”?\n\nCan you hear my voice, do you know I’m here?\n\nIf all things are sent to test us\n\nThen I need to learn to accept this\n\nRather than saying a pitiful “goodbye”\n\nYou always did love my songs\n\nAnd I hope they gave you strength\n\nMaybe then I’ll believe, even though your body is gone\n\nThat you’ll always be with me in spirit\n\nCan you hear me say “thank you”?\n\nCan you hear my song, see this part of me laid bare?\n\nIf I listen to my heart, I can still hear your voice\n\nThe only words you spoke, your last request\n\nCan you hear me say “I love you”?\n\nCan you hear my voice, hear my heart speak?\n\nI’ll stand tall and put on a smile\n\nAnd do it until it feels right\n\nAnd I’ll move on, now I’ve found that strength\n\nIn every breeze, every rainbow, every star, every flower\n\nYou are there, like a comforting song\n\nYou taught me weakness, taught me strength, taught me about myself\n\nAnd though you’re gone, you’re still by my side\n\nClose your eyes, and feel within you\n\nThe pulse you can hear within your soul\n\nReach out your hand, and grasp it tight\n\nAnd grab hold of that courage inside!\n\nWe’re all still just wandering\n\nThat long path towards the future\n\nThough the horizon that we seek\n\nIs still so far away\n\nBut that irreplacable smile of yours\n\nCan light up the deepest darkness\n\nNo matter how far apart we may be,\n\nIt will always shine its light into your heart\n\nSo let’s get moving, let the wind blow in our wake\n\nAnd dive into our neverending story\n\nThe future will always be yours to shape\n\nAs long as you stay strong\n\nAnd every time you realize you don’t stand alone\n\nYou’ll grow that little bit stronger\n\nJust let the warmth of my hand in yours\n\nBe your guide as you take those first steps\n\nI look around, and see no-one there\n\nJust the ripple of the breeze\n\nBut I know I heard your voice\n\nSo warm and gentle\n\nYou can feel my love push you on\n\nWatching over you always\n\nSo press on, don’t look back\n\nHead right for where you want to be!\n\nOur hearts will signal us onward\n\nInto our endless story\n\nThis world is vast beyond our understanding\n\nSo let’s explore it together\n\nThe lights we all carry within us\n\nMay be quite weak on their own\n\nBut as we unite them, one by one\n\nThey shine with such dazzling radiance\n\nWe all share the same story\n\nBut we all get to be the heroes\n\nSo hold your head high, and let us see\n\nThe miracles reflected in your eyes\n\nSo let’s get moving, let the wind blow in our wake\n\nAnd dive into our neverending story\n\nThe future will always be yours to shape\n\nAs long as you stay strong\n\nAnd every time you realize you don’t stand alone\n\nYou’ll grow that little bit stronger\n\nJust let the warmth of my hand in yours\n\nBe your guide as you take that step…\n\nAnd one day we’ll reach that world we saw\n\nIn our dreams, now reflected in our own eyes\n\nAnd let that warmth we’ll always share\n\nBe our guide as we take that step!\n\nWelcome one, and welcome all\n\nWe welcome you to Earth!\n\nLet your bonds unite you,\n\nand stand tall come what may, Arks!\n\nYou’ve found this star we call home,\n\nan ever-changing world awaits you\n\nYour phantasies have grown ever stronger\n\nAnd crossing reality itself, you’ve come\n\nWe may never have a meeting like this again,\n\nSo we ought to sing and dance our hearts out!\n\nJoin us Arks, join us monsters, join us Dark Falzes!\n\nAh, the story you’re weaving\n\nIs one so vivid, and intense\n\nThat a whole future is being set into motion\n\n(Phantasy Star…)\n\nWelcome one, and welcome all\n\nWe welcome you to Earth!\n\nThe adventures of Arks will never end!\n\nNow come one, come all\n\nFor today you will find the glory you seek\n\nLet your bonds unite you,\n\nand stand tall come what may\n\nBe the person you’ve always wanted to be\n\nA radiant belle, or a gallant gent\n\nJust let your imagination go haywire\n\nAnd take you beyond the very limits of possibility\n\nBe it too close for words, or across the Ether sea\n\nIf we can join together, breaking borders\n\nThen when Oracle comes to Tokyo\n\nWe can welcome them with open arms!\n\nAh, though it may be fleeting in its beauty\n\nLike the shining stars in the sky\n\nWe can still make a perennial conclusion bloom for you\n\n(Phantasy Star…)\n\nWelcome one, and welcome all\n\nWe welcome you to Earth!\n\nThe phantasies of Arks will never be stopped!\n\nNow come one, come all\n\nLet’s laugh and dance from the depths of our souls\n\nMove your hands, sing it loud\n\nThis is your festival, Arks!\n\nCome pay a visit to our lovely Earth,\n\nto the shining city of super Tokyo\n\nBring out the Advanced palanquin, yay yay yay!\n\nWe’ll have ourselves an Ultimate festival!\n\nYou’re always welcome on our lovely Earth,\n\nTo sample Edo’s renowned fires and Bursts!\n\nWe’ll beat the Special festival drum, ba-ba-dum!\n\nAnd have ourselves an Extreme festival!\n\nRappy rappy! (Yay yay yay!)\n\nRappy rappy! (Way-hey-hey!)\n\nRappy rappy! (Ba-ba-dum!)\n\nRappy rappy! (Heave ho!)\n\nRappy rappy! (Sa-chi-ko!)\n\nRappy rappy! (P-S-O!)\n\nWhen life is tough, and you can’t go on\n\nYour friends will be there to pick you up\n\nArks will always rise from the ashes\n\nSo lift your heads, face tomorrow\n\nAnd stand tall together\n\nRise like a phoenix, and soar across the cosmos!\n\nWelcome one, and welcome all\n\nWe welcome you to Earth!\n\nThe adventures of Arks will never end!\n\nNow come one, come all\n\nAnd let’s meet here again tomorrow\n\nOur bonds will cross time and space,\n\nAnd last forever more, Arks!\n\nWe welcome you all to Earth!\n\nThe cold light pierces through the mist\n\nAwakening me from my peaceful slumber\n\nA lone bird flies through the sky, carried on the gentle breeze\n\nBefore they both melt into the sunlight\n\nIf this world is doomed to die beneath my feet\n\nThen it’s better I walk alone\n\nI’ve nowhere left to call home anymore,\n\nSo where can the wind be leading me?\n\nThe voice that called to me from deep in the forest\n\nReaches my ears no more\n\nSo heavy though my feet feel\n\nI walk, with but the wind as my guide\n\nIf this world is doomed to die beneath my feet\n\nThen it’s better I walk alone\n\nI’ve nowhere left to call home anymore,\n\nSo where can the wind be leading me?\n\nThe voice that called to me from deep in the forest\n\nReaches my ears no more\n\nSo heavy though my feet feel\n\nI walk, with but the wind as my guide"
