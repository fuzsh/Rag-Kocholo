I, care about your each and every second\n\nBecause I understand the sad things that make you cry..\n\n.. I want to stay by your side and shoulder all of your tears\n\nI will protect you, from all the things that distress you\n\nEven if that’ll be the extent of what I can do for you, I don’t mind\n\nEven if not perfectly, but I’ll definitely make you feel happy\n\nI swear it, no matter what happens, I will protect you\n\n♫\n\nLove You.. remember.. the first words I heard from you were “don’t cry”\n\nEven though you said that to me, you were crying yourself\n\nLove You.. even if you keep blaming yourself for not being good at laughing\n\n.. I, love your each and every second\n\nThat time, when I went out into the storm to find you..\n\n.. seeing you standing still under the downpour.. I just decided.. that I must protect you\n\nI will protect you, from all the things that distress you\n\nEven if others are gonna laugh at me, I don’t mind\n\nMaybe I can’t do it perfectly, but you know, I’ll definitely make you smile\n\nI swear it, no matter what happens, I will protect you\n\n♫\n\nJust as that shooting star is flowing.. and you’re casting your wish upon it..\n\n.. I tone myself with you and wish, to be able to keep protecting you\n\nWhen my life* comes to its end, I want you by my side..\n\n.. and just at that last moment, this time I want you to watch over me\n\nI will protect you, from all the things that distress you\n\nEven if that’ll be the extent of what I can do for you, I don’t mind\n\nEven though I can’t make miracles happen, to me, being with you is a miracle\n\nI swear it, no matter what happens, I will protect you\n\n♫\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n___\n\nT/N: Once again I apologize to HF-san (who posted this request) and other readers for the hiatus that happened to me and the blog which lead to this belated post. Hope to see more requests from now on. Enjoy!\n\n*: The Kanji lyrics use 生命 /sei mei/ which means ‘existence, life’ in a generic sense, but the vocalist says ‘inochi’ which is close in meaning but means ‘a person’s life’ precisely. There isn’t any hidden meaning there, and using synonymous words in the lyrics are quite common.\n\n______________________________________________________________________"
