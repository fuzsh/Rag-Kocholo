And it sounds good so I have no complains lol\n\nThis time the theme of Shori's solo is 'shitsuren' that means 'broken heart' or unrequited love'.\n\nI personally like the song, from the music to the lyric. I think among all the songlyrics that Shori wrote, I like this one and ikiteyo the most. And I wonder who broke your heart until you wrote a lyric like that, Shori? lol\n\nFrom Sexy Zone's 6th Album \"PAGES\"\n\nRelease Date: 2019.03.13 (our beloved Kento's birthday)\n\n風景画\n\nLyricist: 佐藤勝利\n\nComposer: 藤野翔之\n\n[Kanji]\n\n何気ない日常を切り取った絵画\n\n名画と思うのはいつになるんだろう\n\nどうかそんな風景は空想と気づけたら\n\nほらそこに在る日常が輝きだし始める空へと\n\n出会いの糸から溢(こぼ)れた色たちは\n\nその前の色には戻れない\n\n幾重にも紡がれた糸を辿れば\n\n君がいる だといいな…\n\n空は青い久しぶりに見上げたな\n\nこの景色はいつまで続いてくんだろう\n\nだっていつも下向いて日常て気づけない\n\n寂(さび)しいかな偽りつづけ雨降りだし始める此処へと\n\nついた嘘の数だけ菫(すみれ)を咲かそう\n\nたかがって疑って無視せずに\n\n互いの言葉を聞かずに僕たちは\n\n今いる なんでかな…\n\nあの雨もいつかまた咲かすんだ\n\nさよならと言わず気づいてよ\n\nこの蕾を\n\n雨が止んだのに傘を閉じないのは\n\n泣き顔が君にさ見えるから\n\nじゃあねと言った側からもう僕たちは\n\n1人だね\n\n早くして… 離れてよ…\n\n早くして… 離れてよ…\n\nそばにいて\n\n[Romaji]\n\nNanigenai nichijou wo kiritotta kaiga\n\nMeiga to omou no wa itsu ni narundarou\n\nDouka sonna fuukei wa kuusou to kidzuketara\n\nHora soko ni aru nichijou ga kagayaki dashi hajimeru sora he to\n\nDeai no ito kara koboreta irotachi wa\n\nSono mae no iro ni wa modorenai\n\nIkuenimo tsumugareta ito wo tadoreba\n\nKimi ga iru dato ii na…\n\nSora wa aoi hisashiburi ni miageta na\n\nKono keshiki wa itsumade tsudzuitekun darou\n\nDatte itsumo shita muite nichijou tte kidzukenai\n\nSabishii ka na itsuwari tsudzuke ame furidashi hajimeru koko he to\n\nTsuita uso no kazu dake sumire wo sakasou\n\nTakagatte utagatte mushi sezu ni\n\nTagai no kotoba wo kikazu ni bokutachi wa\n\nIma iru nande ka na…\n\nAno ame mo itsuka mata sakasunda\n\nSayonara to iwazu kidzuite yo\n\nKono tsubomi wo\n\nAme ga yanda no ni kasa wo tojinai no wa\n\nNakigao ga kimi ni sa mieru kara\n\nJaa ne to itta soba kara mou bokutachi wa\n\nHitorida ne\n\nHayaku shite… hanarete yo…\n\nHayaku shite… hanarete yo…\n\nSoba ni ite\n\n[Translation]\n\nA painting that cuts off daily life\n\nWhen will it be thought of as a masterpiece?\n\nIf you think such a landscape is a fantasy\n\nYou see, to the sky where the everyday life begins to shine\n\nThe colors that spilled from the thread of encounter\n\nIt can't go back to its previous color\n\nIf you find the threads that piled up in layers\n\nIt would be really nice if you're there...\n\nLook up at the blue sky for the first time in a long time\n\nI wonder how long this view will last?\n\nBecause I always look down and never realize my everyday life\n\nTo the place where the lonely lies continue and rain starts pouring\n\nLet's bloom as many violet as the number of lies I've made\n\nDon't ignore the doubt*\n\nWe who don't listen to each other words\n\nWe are here now, I wonder why...\n\nThat rain too, it will bloom again someday\n\nI notice it even without saying goodbye\n\nThis flower bud**\n\nI didn't close my umbrella even though it has stopped raining\n\nBecause you will see my crying face\n\nI said goodbye from the side, we are already\n\nWe are alone\n\nHurry up... leave me...\n\nHurry up... leave me...\n\nStay with me\n\n======================================== ======================================\n\nNOTES:\n\nIt's quite hard to translate this song. If you find the (*) beside a line, it means;\n\n(*) I think I missed something, I really can't find the right words to translate 'takagatte' so I only translated the other words.\n\n(**) Tsubomi means flower bud, flower before it blooms. It's not like I'm doubting my own translation on this line, but I don't know, I just think it's not poetic at all, and I hope people will still get the feel this song has that Shori trying to tell us.\n\nShori said, when he started writing this song, the first words that came to him was that \"tsuita uso no kazu dake sumire wo sakasou (let's bloom as many violet as the number of lies I've made)\" and I personally and honestly think that this line is the most beautiful one in this song :)\n\nNo copyrights infringement intended. Got the picture from gugel. Kanji from mojim as always, romaji and translation by me, so don't claim it as yours. If you spot any mistakes, feel free to tell me, I'm still learning so your opinion can really help me improve my Japanese :)\n\nYou can use the lyrics (romaji and/or translation) to sub video, or retranslate them to whatever language you like, but please credit this journal. Thank you :)"
