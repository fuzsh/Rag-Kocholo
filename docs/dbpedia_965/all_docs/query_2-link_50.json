        "text": "Today that I’m experiencing with you for the first time is a special Christmas time\n\nA dazzling holy night when the streets sparkle brightly\n\nI’m sorry I don’t notice every day\n\nSorry for being a selfish child, unable to see past your kindness\n\nWith my gratefulness, today is\n\nI want to tell you, “Thank you,” for you\n\nI swear to you on this night when angels descend\n\nSo I want you to be beside me and make my heart clench\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nWriting “I like you” on the misted glass, I immediately erased it\n\nEmbarrassed, you smile as you hum Christmas carols\n\nI wanna feel your warmth every day\n\nSnuggling, gripping your hand and walking\n\nWrapped in your hand’s warmth that reaches my heart\n\nFor being by my side, “Thank you,” for you\n\nBecause you’re here I become stronger\n\nAnd I swear to become even stronger\n\nTo protect your all\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nOn Christmas night I give you alone my love\n\nThe Church’s bells of love are blessing us"
