I thought you'd always stay by my side\n\nAt the time I didn't notice; I only realized it after you were gone\n\nYour smile was warmer than anyone's - if it had been now, I would have realized it\n\nThe wind brings memories with it, but still the seasons only pass me by\n\nSoftly I place my hand, where your warmth still lingers, in my pocket\n\nThe wind grows just a little bit colder\n\nIt's times like these when I want you nearby the most\n\nYet you're only within my memory of that day\n\nStill smiling so happily it makes me sad\n\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\n\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\n\nThe words you left behind that day dance on the wind with the falling leaves\n\nI recall them as I face the dusk alone, and the traces of you slowly fade\n\nI stand alone on the bustling street as its lights start to glow one by one\n\nThe warmth my hand felt from yours grows empty with time\n\nAs the moon shines through the long night, within my hazy memories\n\nI search for you; I wanted to spend this season with you\n\nAfter all the days that have passed, if I saw you now I could ask \"How are you?\"\n\nI feel the autumn breeze grow colder as I move on to tomorrow\n\nThe wind grows just a little bit colder\n\nIt's times like these when I want you nearby the most\n\nYet you're only within my memory of that day\n\nStill smiling so happily it makes me sad\n\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\n\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\n\nEven though we're each seeing different scenery and living on separate time now\n\nAs the footsteps of winter draw closer, the hands of the clock suddenly stop\n\nWe're so far, far apart, rumors on the wind don't even reach me\n\nBut please just don't forget the way you smiled on that day\n\nPlease stay smiling\n\nThe scent carried softly on the wind brings back memories of you\n\nNow you live only in my happiest memories, still smiling so brilliantly\n\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\n\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\n\nThe wind grows just a little bit colder\n\nIt's times like these when I want you nearby the most\n\nYet you're only within my memory of that day\n\nStill smiling so happily it makes me sad\n\n[1] The Koshu Kaido is a historic road, one of five built in the Edo period to connect Edo (now Tokyo) with other locations in Japan. At present it runs between Tokyo and the town of Shimosuwa in Nagano Prefecture.\n\nDisclaimer: This song belongs to Funky Monkey Babys and Dreamusic Inc., not me.
