I’ll let these desperate thoughts\n\nfloat in the air and cool off.\n\nMuch like today,\n\nit just repeats over & over.\n\nI know the answer, but it’s so damn blurry.\n\nI’m positive\n\nyou will forever\n\nremain in my mind.\n\nFrom morning until night,\n\neven when I wake from my dreams,\n\nI’ll be daydreaming of you.\n\nFor example,\n\nI knew that those\n\nmore honest, stylish earrings\n\ndidn’t suit me at all, and yet…\n\nOn this night, where it feels like\n\nthere’s nothing I can do,\n\nmy voice will never be able to reach you\n\never again.\n\nOh!

Pretending to look at the rainbow in the water fountain,\n\nI just mutter “Pretty, huh” – and I’m sure\n\nyou think I’m just shy…\n\nBut I can’t say it! You cast a spell on me,\n\nand in this secret garden, any word I say,\n\nall of them, are lies.\n\nMay, I call out to you in secret.\n\nThe first time I met you, the dazzling sunlight filtered through the trees.\n\nMay, I wish I could say it out loud.\n\nBut this is a dream, so since I don’t wanna risk waking you up,\n\nnope, I won’t tell you.\n\nYou’re like a delicate glass bird.\n\nEven when we’re together,\n\nI can only dream my own dreams.\n\nI’m such an idiot; I wanna make you happy, and yet\n\nit’s just a dream I can’t emerge from. I can only\n\nlook down and smile a little…\n\nBut I love you! I love you, I love you, I love you more than anyone.\n\nSomeday, I’ll break out of this birdcage so strongly\n\nthat the whole world will shake.\n\nAll the time, I wanna make you happy, and yet\n\nit’s just a dream I can’t emerge from. I can only\n\nlook down and smile a little…\n\nBut I love you! I love you, I love you, I love you more than anyone.\n\nSomeday, I’ll tell you how I feel with such a loud voice\n\nthat the whole world will shake.\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nI look down on the frozen streets\n\nfrom the sunny spot by my window.\n\nLoneliness, hatred…\n\nthere’s an entire story on the other side of the glass.\n\nYeah, if only the whole world was someone else’s problem,\n\nthen I could live my life without getting hurt.\n\nBut I wanna keep living with all my heart,\n\nfrom the door of paradise… alone.\n\nI go down the cold stairway,\n\ninto the noisy sea.\n\nLonging and sorrow\n\ncollide and trip over one another on the street corners.\n\nYeah, swallowed up in the waves of people,\n\nI don’t mind taking a detour.\n\nOne step at a time, I wanna get closer~\n\nto a strong kindness… always.\n\nThe blue sky is dazzling;\n\nit makes me feel so small.\n\nBut don’t get swept away by the waves of people.\n\nIf you could walk straight ahead,\n\nthen someday, I wanna embrace you\n\njust like that sunny spot by the window.\n\nI’m a little clumsy in my new shoes,\n\nand they give me a dull pain, but\n\none step at a time, I’ll put them on and get used to them,\n\nso I can be closer to you…"
