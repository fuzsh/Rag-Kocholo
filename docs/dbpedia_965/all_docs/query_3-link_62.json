Participants were patients registered between April 2014 and March 2016 in a multicenter epidemiological survey database involving 30 university hospitals and medical centers across Japan. Statistical analysis was performed to clarify the factors associated with their clinical characteristics and the severity of hearing impairment, treatment, and prognosis. Idiopathic SSNHL and ALHL differed significantly in terms of male-to-female ratio, age distribution, and time from onset to start of treatment. The treatment methods and hearing prognosis also differed markedly between the two diseases. A majority (92%) of idiopathic SSNHL patients were administered some type of corticosteroid, while half of the ALHL patients received corticosteroids and a diuretic agent. The results suggested that idiopathic SSNHL and ALHL belonged to different categories of inner ear disease.\n\nEffect of prostaglandin E1 on idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a double-blinded clinical study.\n\nPubMed\n\nOgawa, Kaoru; Takei, Satoshi; Inoue, Yasuhiro; Kanzaki, Jin\n\n2002-09-01\n\nThe authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial for the purpose of elucidating the effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. With the approval of the institute ethics committee, a total of 57 consecutive patients with diagnoses of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss were included in the study. The patients in the PGE1 group received continuous infusion containing 60 microg PGE1 and 100 mg hydrocortisone for 7 days, and the patients in the placebo group were treated with continuous infusion containing an inactive placebo and 100 mg hydrocortisone. No significant differences were observed in the improvements of pure-tone average and subjective symptoms between the PGE1 and the placebo groups. However, the hearing improvement at high frequencies (4 kHz and 8 kHz) was significantly higher in the PGE1 group than in the placebo group, especially in the patients with severe tinnitus. These results failed to prove a beneficial effect of PGE1 in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Further studies will be needed to clarify the pharmacologic actions of PGE1 in the cochlea.\n\nMetabolomic analysis of urine with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: A preliminary study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarta, Filippo; Lussu, Milena; Bandino, Fabrizio; Noto, Antonio; Peppi, Marcello; Chuchueva, Natalia; Atzori, Luigi; Fanos, Vassilios; Puxeddu, Roberto\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIdiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a frequent emergency, with unknown aetiology and usually treated with empiric therapy. Steroids represent the only validated treatment but prognosis is unpredictable and the possibility to select the patients who will not respond to steroids could avoid unnecessary treatments. Metabolomic profiling of the biofluids target the analysis of the final product of genic expression and enzymatic activity, defining the biochemical phenotype of a whole biologic system. We studied the metabolomics of the urine of a cohort of patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, correlating the metabolic profiles with the clinical outcomes. Metabolomic profiling of urine samples was performed by 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistical approaches. 26 patients were included in the study: 5 healthy controls, 13 patients who did not recover after treatment at 6 months while the remaining 8 patients recovered from the hearing loss. The orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis score plot showed a significant separation between the two groups, responders and non-responders after steroid therapy, R 2 Y of 0.83, Q 2 of 0.38 and p value <0.05. The resulting metabolic profiles were characterized by higher levels of urinary B-Alanine, 3-hydroxybutyrate and Trimethylamine N-oxide, and lower levels of Citrate and Creatinine in patients with worst outcome. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a specific disease with unclear systemic changes, but our data suggest that there are different types of this disorder or patients predisposed to effective action of steroids allowing the recover after treatment.

The sensitivity and specificity of the hyperventilation test were compared with other audio-vestibular diagnostic tests (bedside examination of eye movements, caloric test, auditory brainstem responses) in the two groups of patients. The hyperventilation test scored the highest diagnostic efficiency (sensitivity 65.3 %; specificity 98.1 %) of the four tests in the differential diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma and idiopathic unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Small tumors with a normal caloric response or caloric paresis were associated with ipsilateral HVN and larger tumors and severe caloric deficits with contralateral HVN. These results confirm that the hyperventilation test is a useful diagnostic test for predicting vestibular schwannoma in patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPrediction of hearing outcomes by multiple regression analysis in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuzuki, Hideaki; Tabata, Takahisa; Koizumi, Hiroki; Hohchi, Nobusuke; Takeuchi, Shoko; Kitamura, Takuro; Fujino, Yoshihisa; Ohbuchi, Toyoaki\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis study aimed to create a multiple regression model for predicting hearing outcomes of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). The participants were 205 consecutive patients (205 ears) with ISSNHL (hearing level â¥ 40 dB, interval between onset and treatment â¤ 30 days). They received systemic steroid administration combined with intratympanic steroid injection. Data were examined by simple and multiple regression analyses. Three hearing indices (percentage hearing improvement, hearing gain, and posttreatment hearing level [HLpost]) and 7 prognostic factors (age, days from onset to treatment, initial hearing level, initial hearing level at low frequencies, initial hearing level at high frequencies, presence of vertigo, and contralateral hearing level) were included in the multiple regression analysis as dependent and explanatory variables, respectively. In the simple regression analysis, the percentage hearing improvement, hearing gain, and HLpost showed significant correlation with 2, 5, and 6 of the 7 prognostic factors, respectively. The multiple correlation coefficients were 0.396, 0.503, and 0.714 for the percentage hearing improvement, hearing gain, and HLpost, respectively. Predicted values of HLpost calculated by the multiple regression equation were reliable with 70% probability with a 40-dB-width prediction interval. Prediction of HLpost by the multiple regression model may be useful to estimate the hearing prognosis of ISSNHL.

This paper presents two cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, initially considered as idiopathic, but which were caused by septic emboli. Hearing loss in these cases was bilateral, sequential and total. The first patient had mild fever one week prior to their presentation with sudden sensorineural hearing loss; the other patient had no additional symptoms at presentation. These patients were later diagnosed with infective endocarditis, at two and seven months following the sudden sensorineural hearing loss respectively, showing that septic emboli had been the cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Septic emboli should be considered as a possible cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss in cases of total hearing loss. This form of hearing loss should prompt the otolaryngologist to further investigate for infective endocarditis.\n\nMultivariate analysis of prognostic factors for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss treated with adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nXie, Shaobing; Qiang, Qingfen; Mei, Lingyun; He, Chufeng; Feng, Yong; Sun, Hong; Wu, Xuewen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate possible prognostic factors of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) treated with adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) using univariate and multivariate analyses. From January 2008 to October 2016, records of 178 ISSNHL patients treated with auxiliary hyperbaric oxygen therapy were reviewed to assess hearing recovery and evaluate associated prognostic factors (gender, age, localization, initial hearing threshold, presence of tinnitus, vertigo, ear fullness, hypertension, diabetes, onset of HBOT, number of HBOT, and audiogram), by using univariate and multivariate analyses. The overall recovery rate was 37.1%, including complete recovery (19.7%) and partial recovery (17.4%). According to multivariate analysis, later onset of HBOT and higher initial hearing threshold were associated with a poor prognosis in ISSNHL patients treated with HBOT. HBOT is a safe and beneficial adjuvant therapy for ISSNHL patients. 20 sessions of HBOT is possibly enough to show its therapeutic effect. Earlier HBOT onset and lower initial hearing threshold is associated with favorable hearing recovery.\n\nQuality of Life and Hearing Eight Years After Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nHÃ¤rkÃ¶nen, Kati; KivekÃ¤s, Ilkka; Rautiainen, Markus; Kotti, Voitto; Vasama, Juha-Pekka\n\n2017-04-01\n\nTo explore long-term hearing results, quality of life (QoL), quality of hearing (QoH), work-related stress, tinnitus, and balance problems after idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). Cross-sectional study. We reviewed the audiograms of 680 patients with unilateral ISSNHL on average 8 years after the hearing impairment, and then divided the patients into two study groups based on whether their ISSNHL had recovered to normal (pure tone average [PTA] â¤ 30 dB) or not (PTA > 30 dB). The inclusion criteria were a hearing threshold decrease of 30 dB or more in at least three contiguous frequencies occurring within 72 hours in the affected ear and normal hearing in the contralateral ear. Audiograms of 217 patients fulfilled the criteria. We reviewed their medical records; measured present QoL, QoH, and work-related stress with specific questionnaires; and updated the hearing status. Poor hearing outcome after ISSNHL was correlated with age, severity of hearing loss, and vertigo together with ISSNHL. Quality of life and QoH were statistically significantly better in patients with recovered hearing, and the patients had statistically significantly less tinnitus and balance problems. During the 8-year follow-up, the PTA of the affected ear deteriorated on average 7 dB, and healthy ear deteriorated 6 dB. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss that failed to recover had a negative impact on long-term QoL and QoH. The hearing deteriorated as a function of age similarly both in the affected and the healthy ear, and there were no differences between the groups. The cumulative recurrence rate for ISSNHL was 3.5%. 4 Laryngoscope, 127:927-931, 2017.

We report here the development and evaluation of âconstraint-induced sound therapyâ, which is based on a well-established neuro-rehabilitation approach, and which is characterized by the plugging of the intact ear (âconstraintâ) and the simultaneous, extensive stimulation of the affected ear with music. The sudden sensorineural hearing loss patients who received the constraint-induced sound therapy in addition to the standard corticosteroid therapy showed significantly better recovery of hearing function compared to those who had only received corticosteroid treatments. Additionally, the brain activity obtained in a subgroup of patients suggested that the constraint-induced sound therapy could have prevented maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization. Constraint-induced sound therapy thus appears to be an effective, practical, and safe treatment option for sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

The subjects were 191 consecutive patients (192 ears) with ISSNHL (hearing level â¥40 dB, interval between onset and treatment â¤30 days). They received systemic prednisolone (100 mg followed by tapered doses) combined with intratympanic injection of dexamethasone (4 mg/ml). Intratympanic injection was performed 4 times (days 1, 2, 4, and 7) in 92 patients (92 ears) or 2 times (days 1 and 2) in 99 patients (100 ears). The hearing outcomes were evaluated at 1 week from the start of treatment and 1 to 2 months after the completion of treatment. There was no significant difference in hearing outcomes between the 4- and 2-injection groups at either time point. Multiple regression analysis also showed that the hearing level after treatment did not depend on the total number of intratympanic steroid injections. These results indicate that a protocol using only 2 intratympanic steroid injections exerts a sufficient effect on the hearing outcomes of ISSNHL. This simplified treatment protocol would be greatly beneficial to relieve the physical and mental stress of patients.\n\nIdiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and mÃ©niÃ¨re syndrome: The role of cerebral venous drainage.\n\nPubMed\n\nCiccone, M M; Scicchitano, P; Gesualdo, M; Cortese, F; Zito, A; Manca, F; Boninfante, B; Recchia, P; Leogrande, D; Viola, D; Damiani, M; Gambacorta, V; Piccolo, A; De Ceglie, V; Quaranta, N\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo evaluate the influence of cerebral venous drainage on the pathogenesis of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) and MÃ©niÃ¨re syndrome (MD). Observational, prospective, cohort study. ENT and Cardiology Departments (University of Bari, Policlinico Hospital, Bari, Italy). We enrolled 59 consecutive patients (32 males, mean age 53.05 + 15.37 years): 40 ISSHL and 19 MD. All patients underwent physical examination, biochemical evaluation (glycemic and lipid profile, viral serology, C reactive protein, etc), audiometric (tonal, vocal, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials and auditory brainstem response test) and impedentiometric examination. The pure tone average (PTA) was calculated for the following frequencies: 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 8000. An echo-color Doppler evaluation of the venous cerebral veins, internal jugular (IJV) and vertebral veins (VV) at supine and 90Â° position was performed. No morphological alterations were found both in patients and controls. There were no signs of stenosis, blocked flow, membranes, etc. We found lower minimum, mean and maximum velocities in distal IJVs (P = .019; P = .013; P = .022; respectively) and left VVs (P = .027; P = .008; P = .001; respectively) in supine (0Â°) position in both MD and ISSHL patients as compared to controls. The same was for orthostatic position (90Â°). We found negative correlations between the velocities in extracranial veins and PTA values: therefore, the worst the audiometric performance of the subjects, the lower the velocities in the venous cerebral drainage. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and MÃ©niÃ¨re syndrome patients showed altered venous flow in IJVs and VVs as compared to controls, independently from posture. This different behavior of venous tone control can influence the ear performance and may have a role in the pathogenesis of both diseases.

To assess postural control stability in students with normal hearing (i.e., listeners) and with sensorineural hearing loss, and to compare data between groups, considering gender and age. This cross-sectional study evaluated the postural control of 96 students, 48 listeners and 48 with sensorineural hearing loss, aged between 7 and 18 years, of both genders, through the Balance Error Scoring Systems scale. This tool assesses postural control in two sensory conditions: stable surface and unstable surface. For statistical data analysis between groups, the Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used. Students with hearing loss showed more instability in postural control than those with normal hearing, with significant differences between groups (stable surface, unstable surface) (p<0.001). Students with sensorineural hearing loss showed greater instability in the postural control compared to normal hearing students of the same gender and age.

This study investigated the correlation between the laterality of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, handedness and the preferred ear for mobile phone use. The study included all patients who presented with sudden sensorineural hearing loss to the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery in our tertiary referral medical centre between 2014 and 2016. Patients were asked to indicate their dominant hand and preferred ear for mobile phone use. The study comprised 160 patients. No correlation was found between the dominant hand or preferred ear for mobile phone use and the side of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. There was no correlation between the side of the sudden sensorineural hearing loss (preferable or non-preferable for mobile phone use) and audiometric characteristics. No correlation was found between the laterality of ears used for mobile phone and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nVitamins A, C, and E and selenium in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaya, Hakan; KoÃ§, Arzu Karaman; SayÄ±n, Ä°brahim; GÃ¼neÅ, SelÃ§uk; AltÄ±ntaÅ, Ahmet; YeÄin, Yakup; Kayhan, Fatma TÃ¼lin\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness of vitamins A, C, and E, with selenium, in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). This was a prospective, controlled study performed at a tertiary teaching and research hospital. Over a 32-month period, patients were treated with either our standard ISSNHL treatment regimen plus vitamins A, C, and E and selenium (ACE+ group) or with only our standard ISSNHL treatment regimen (ACE- group). The demographics, additional symptoms, mean initial and final hearing levels, mean hearing gain, and recovery data were compared between the two groups. The ACE+ group, consisting of 70 (55.5 %) patients, received vitamin A (natural beta-carotene, 26,000 IU), vitamin C (ascorbic acid, 200 mg), vitamin E (d-alpha-tocopherol, 200 IU), and selenium (50 Î¼g) twice daily for 30 days in addition to our ISSNHL treatment regimen: methylprednisolone at an initial dose of 1 mg/kg body weight per day, tapered over 14 days; Rheomacrodex(Â®) [(10 g of dextran and 0.9 g of NaCl)/100 ml] 500 ml daily for 5 days; Vastarel(Â®) 20-mg tablet (20 mg of trimetazidine dihydrochloride) three times daily for 30 days; and ten 60-min hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) sessions (2.5 absolute atmospheres of 100 % O2), once daily, starting the day of hospitalization. The ACE- group comprised 56 (44.4 %) patients, who received only our ISSNHL treatment regimen. The mean hearing gains were 36.2 Â± 20.3 dB in the ACE+ group and 27.1 Â± 20.6 dB in the ACE- group. The mean hearing gain rates were significantly higher in the ACE+ group than in the ACE- group (p = 0.014). Treatment with vitamins A, C, and E and selenium was effective in ISSNHL patients undergoing treatment with methylprednisolone, dextran, trimetazidine dihydrochloride, and HBO, and might be more effective when the initial hearing level is below 46 dB.\n\nSensorineural hearing loss in hemorrhagic dengue?\n\nPubMed\n\nRibeiro, Bruna NatÃ¡lia Freire; GuimarÃ£es, Alexandre Caixeta; Yazawa, Felipe; Takara, Tammy Fumiko Messias; de Carvalho, Guilherme Machado; Zappelini, Carlos Eduardo Monteiro\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDengue is an acute febrile infectious disease, with high fever followed by symptoms flu-like. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a vascular leak syndrome and could present spontaneous bleeding and worsening of symptoms after some days. Dengue could have some ENT manifestations, however hearing loss is not one of them. Sudden hearing loss is considered as sensorineural or perceptual hearing loss with a sudden onset in a person without other prior otological history. The relation between infectious diseases and sudden hearing are been investigated, some viruses were already linked, but the relation between dengue virus and sudden hearing still remains unknown. This article has the goal of presenting a case of DHF that evolved with SSHL in his hospitalization process. We report a 60 years-male patient of with DHF who developed bilateral secretory otitis media and sensorineural hearing loss after the fifth day of onset of symptoms. His hearing loss remained even after 7 months and the patient was referred for hearing aid fitting. This is the first case report that brings together DHF and sudden hearing loss. In the development of this case no other cause to sudden hearing loss was found and the correlation between dengue and hearing loss was questioned. In the literature review was found that some viruses, as mumps virus, varicella-zoster virus and HSV-1 and HSV-2 are related to sudden hearing loss, all of them fit in the viral theory. Besides the viral theory of sudden hearing loss, there is the vascular theory that is the occlusion of the end artery that supplies the cochlea. DHF has a vascular commitment, and the hypothesis of a vascular cause could be elicited in this case. Many studies in this area are needed and this article has the objective of elicit the discussion about the subject. Could dengue be associated with sensorineural hearing loss? Copyright Â© 2015.

In our program of early hipoacusia detection, 241 babies were examined from January 1996 until November 1999; 7 cases had a history of hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period and 2 of them were diagnosed of sensorineural hearing loss. We discuss how the bilirubin or any other associated factor might have been the cause and this could explain the selective affectation of some children.\n\nP300 in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nReis, Ana ClÃ¡udia Mirandola Barbosa; Frizzo, Ana Claudia Figueiredo; Isaac, Myriam de Lima; Garcia, Cristiane Fregonesi Dutra; Funayama, Carolina AraÃºjo Rodrigues; IÃ³rio, Maria CecÃ­lia Martinelli\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBehavioral and electrophysiological auditory evaluations contribute to the understanding of the auditory system and of the process of intervention. To study P300 in subjects with severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss. This was a descriptive cross-sectional prospective study. It included 29 individuals of both genders with severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss without other type of disorders, aged 11 to 42 years; all were assessed by behavioral audiological evaluation and auditory evoked potentials. A recording of the P3 wave was obtained in 17 individuals, with a mean latency of 326.97ms and mean amplitude of 3.76V. There were significant differences in latency in relation to age and in amplitude according to degree of hearing loss. There was a statistically significant association of the P300 results with the degrees of hearing loss (p=0.04), with the predominant auditory communication channels (p<0.0001), and with time of hearing loss.

Conventional treatments for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), i.e. hearing aid and cochlear implant, are effective for some cases, but not without limitations. For example, they provide little benefit for patients of profound SNHL or neural hearing loss, especially when the hearing loss is in poor dynamic range and with low frequency resolution. We emphasize the most recent evidence-based treatment in this field, which includes gene therapy and allotransplantation of stem cells. Their promising results have shown that they might be options of treatment for profound SNHL and neural hearing loss. Although some treatments are still at the experimental stage, it is helpful to be aware of the novel therapies and endeavour to explore the feasibility of their clinical application.\n\nDelayed restoration of maximum speech discrimination scores in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoguchi, Yoshihiro; Takahashi, Masatoki; Ito, Taku; Fujikawa, Taro; Kawashima, Yoshiyuki; Kitamura, Ken\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTo assess possible delayed recovery of the maximum speech discrimination score (SDS) when the audiometric threshold ceases to change. We retrospectively examined 20 patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) (gender: 9 males and 11 females, age: 24-71 years). The findings of pure-tone average (PTA), maximum SDS, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), and tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) were compared among the three periods of 1-3 months, 6-8 months, and 11-13 months after ISSNHL onset. No significant differences were noted in PTA, whereas an increase of greater than or equal to 10% in maximum SDS was recognized in 9 patients (45%) from the period of 1-3 months to the period of 11-13 months. Four of the 9 patients showed 20% or more recovery of maximum SDS. No significant differences were observed in the interpeak latency difference between waves I and V and the interaural latency difference of wave V in ABRs, whereas an improvement in the THI grade was recognized in 11 patients (55%) from the period of 1-3 months to the period of 11-13 months. The present study suggested the incidence of maximum SDS restoration over 1 year after ISSNHL onset. These findings may be because of the effects of auditory plasticity via the central auditory pathway. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The estimated incidence rate is 5-30 cases per 100,000 people per year. The causes of SSHL and the mechanisms underlying SSHL currently remain unknown. Based on several hypotheses such as a circulatory disturbance to the cochlea, viral infection, and autoimmune disease, pharmaco-therapeutic approaches have been applied to treat SSHL patients; however, the efficacy of the standard treatment, corticosteroid therapy, is still under debate. Exposure to intense sounds has been shown to cause permanent damage to the auditory system; however, exposure to a moderate level enriched acoustic environment after noise trauma may reduce hearing impairments. Several neuroimaging studies recently suggested that the onset of SSHL induced maladaptive cortical reorganization in the human auditory cortex, and that the degree of cortical reorganization in the acute SSHL phase negatively correlated with the recovery rate from hearing loss. This article reports the development of a novel neuro-rehabilitation approach for SSHL, \"constraint-induced sound therapy (CIST)\". The aim of the CIST protocol is to prevent or reduce maladaptive cortical reorganization by using an enriched acoustic environment. The canal of the intact ear of SSHL patients is plugged in order to motivate them to actively use the affected ear and thereby prevent progress of maladaptive cortical reorganization. The affected ear is also exposed to music via a headphone for 6 hr per day during hospitalization. The CIST protocol appears to be a safe, easy, inexpensive, and effective treatment for SSHL.

The present study used magnetoencephalography to investigate auditory-evoked magnetic fields [a component of the middle-latency auditory evoked fields peaking at approximately 50 ms (P50m) and a component of the long-latency auditory evoked fields peaking at approximately 100 ms (N100m)] on stimulation of both healthy and affected ears in patients with acute unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) of moderate degree in order to elucidate the functional plasticity of the auditory system. Sixteen right-handed, previously untreated adult patients with acute unilateral left (n = 8) or right (n = 8) ISSNHL of moderate degree were studied. Sixteen right-handed healthy volunteers with normal hearing served as control. Auditory neuromagnetic responses, measured by a whole-head 306-channel neuromagnetometer, were detected by monaural tone stimulation applied to affected and healthy ears, respectively, in different sessions. Intragroup and intergroup interhemispheric differences of peak dipole strengths and latencies of P50m and N100m, respectively, to monaural tones were evaluated. Healthy-side amplitude dominance of both P50m and N100m was found in ISSNHL, i.e. contralateral dominance was preserved on affected-ear stimulation but ipsilateral dominance was seen on healthy-ear stimulation. The phenomena could be attributed to the combined contralateral attenuation and ipsilateral enhancement of P50m and N100m activity in response to healthy-ear stimulation. Our findings confirmed that functional modulation can occur within the first few tens of milliseconds of evoked response at the auditory cortex in ISSNHL. The mechanisms of healthy-side dominance might be ascribed to a functional retune of auditory pathways, i.e. conjoined contralateral inhibition and ipsilateral excitation of the auditory pathway in response to healthy-ear stimulation.

About 60% of full term neonates and 80% of premature ones will suffer from jaundice within the first week of life. Hyperbilirubinemia at birth is a risk factor associated with hearing loss that is usually further linked to other factors that might have an effect on hearing synergistically. This study aimed to identify the relationship between hyperbilirubinemia at birth as a risk factor for sensorineural hearing loss in children born at Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Insular Materno-Infantil de Gran Canaria, in the 2007-2011 period. This was a retrospective study of 796 newborns that had hyperbilirubinemia at birth, using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and evoked auditory brainstem response. Hundred eighty-five newborns (23.24%) were referred for evoked auditory brainstem response. Hearing loss was diagnosed for 35 (4.39%): 18 neonates (51.43%) with conductive hearing loss and 17 (48.57%) with sensorineural hearing loss, 3 of which were diagnosed as bilateral profound hearing loss. Half of the children had other risk factors associated, the most frequent being exposure to ototoxic medications. The percentage of children diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss that suffered hyperbilirubinemia at birth is higher than for the general population. Of those diagnosed, none had levels of indirect bilirubinâ¥20mg/dl, only 47% had hyperbilirubinemia at birth as a risk factor and 53% had another auditory risk factor associated.

There was no history of upper respiratory tract infection, systemic illness, ototoxic medication or trauma, and normal otoscopic examination. Pure tone audiograms (PTA) demonstrated right-sided sensorineural hearing loss (thresholds 90-100 dB) and normal left-sided hearing. MRI internal acoustic meatus, viral serology (hepatitis B, C, HIV and cytomegalovirus) and syphilis screen were normal. Positive Epstein-Barr virus IgG, viral capsid IgG and anticochlear antibodies (anti-HSP-70) were noted. Initial treatment involved a course of high-dose oral prednisolone and acyclovir. Repeat PTAs after 12 days of treatment showed a small improvement in hearing thresholds. Salvage intratympanic steroid injections were attempted but failed to improve hearing further. Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an uncommon but frightening experience for patients. This is the first report of SSNHL following rabies immunisation in an adult. 2015 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\nBilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss as a presenting feature of systemic lupus erythematosus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChawki, Sylvain; Aouizerate, Jessie; Trad, Selim; Prinseau, Jacques; Hanslik, Thomas\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Introduction: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is an unusual presenting clinical feature of systemic lupus erythematosus. Case report: We report the case of a young woman who was admitted to hospital for sudden sensorineural hearing loss and hemophagocytic syndrome which was attributed to systemic lupus erythematosus on the basis of specific renal involvement, thrombocytopenia, and consistent autoantibodies. Favorable outcome was obtained on high-dose corticosteroids, and the hearing fully recovered. Discussion: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in systemic lupus erythematosus is seemingly more frequently associated with severe systemic involvement and antiphospholipid antibodies may be present. Although management remains empirical, the high risk of permanent hearing impairment seems to justify emergency treatment with high-dose corticosteroids. When the clinical and laboratory criteria of antiphospholipid syndrome are met, antiplatelets agents or anticoagulation therapy shall be considered.

Which Clues to Suspect the Diagnosis?\n\nPubMed\n\nZiegler, Alban; Loundon, Natalie; Jonard, Laurence; CavÃ©, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Baujat, GeneviÃ¨ve; Gherbi, Souad; Couloigner, Vincent; Marlin, Sandrine\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTo highlight Noonan syndrome as a clinically recognizable cause of severe to profound sensorineural hearing impairment. New clinical cases and review. Patients evaluated for etiological diagnosis by a medical geneticist in a reference center for hearing impairment. Five patients presenting with confirmed Noonan syndrome and profound sensorineural hearing impairment. Diagnostic and review of the literature. Five patients presented with profound sensorineural hearing impairment and molecularly confirmed Noonan syndrome. Sensorineural hearing impairment has been progressive for three patients. Cardiac echography identified pulmonary stenosis in two patients and was normal for the three other patients. Short stature was found in two patients. Mild intellectual disability was found in one patient. Inconspicuous clinical features as facial dysmorphism, cryptorchidism, or easy bruising were of peculiar interest to reach the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. Profound sensorineural hearing impairment can be the main feature of Noonan syndrome. Associated features are highly variable; thus, detailed medical history and careful physical examination are mandatory to consider the diagnosis in case of a sensorineural hearing impairment.\n\nEarly cortical metabolic rearrangement related to clinical data in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nMicarelli, Alessandro; Chiaravalloti, Agostino; Viziano, Andrea; Danieli, Roberta; Schillaci, Orazio; Alessandrini, Marco\n\n2017-07-01\n\nResults in studies concerning cortical changes in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) are not homogeneous, in particular due to the different neuroimaging techniques implemented and the diverse stages of ISSNHL studied. Considering the recent advances in state-of-the-art positron emission tomography (PET) cameras, the aim of this study was to gain more insight into the neuroanatomical differences associated with the earliest stages of unilateral ISSNHL and clinical-perceptual performance changes. After an audiological examination including the mean auditory threshold (mean AT), mean speech discrimination score (mean SDS) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), 14 right-handed ISSNHL patients underwent brain [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET within 72Â h of the onset of symptoms. When compared to an homogeneous group of 35 healthy subjects by means of statistical parametric mapping, a relative increase in FDG uptake was found in the right superior and medial frontal gyrus as well as in the right anterior cingulate cortex in ISSNHL patients. Conversely, the same group showed a significant relative decrease in FDG uptake in the right middle temporal, precentral and postcentral gyrus as well as in the left posterior cingulate cortex, left lingual, superior, middle temporal and middle frontal gyrus and in the left insula. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation between mean THI and glucose consumption in the right anterior cingulate cortex and a positive correlation between mean SDS and glucose consumption in the left precentral gyrus. The relative changes in FDG uptake found in these brain regions and the positive correlation with mean SDS and THI scores in ISSNHL could possibly highlight new aspects of cerebral rearrangement, contributing to further explain changes in those functions that support speech recognition during the sudden impairment of unilateral auditory input.

Most patients have a background of traditional coronary risk factors related to these cerebrovascular episodes. A 32-year-old male, a regular user of anabolic steroids, presented to the emergency department with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and symptoms suggestive of an infarct of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery but in the absence of risk factors for ischaemic stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of infarction in the region supplied by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Polycythaemia was found on haematological analysis, which we believe was secondary to the use of anabolic steroids. The patient was commenced on aspirin as per the stroke management protocol. There was resolution of neurological symptomatology six weeks after the episode, but no improvement in hearing. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of unilateral sensorineural hearing loss secondary to the use of anabolic steroids causing polycythaemia. This cause should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with sensorineural hearing loss, especially in young males, when no other risk factors can be identified.\n\nIsolated Sensorineural Hearing Loss as a Sequela after Lightning Strike\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTuran, Mahfuz; Kalkan, Ferhat; Bozan, NazÄ±m; ÃzÃ§alimli, Ä°sa; Zeki Erdem, Mehmet; YalÄ±nkÄ±lÄ±Ã§, AbdÃ¼laziz; Garca, Mehmet Fatih\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn most of the surviving patients after a lightning strike, audiovestibular abnormalities have been reported. The most frequently reported type of abnormalities is a tympanic membrane perforation with hearing loss and external ear canal burn. However a sensor neural hearing loss and mixed type hearing loss can also occur, but these occur rarely. A nineteen-year-old female patient had, after a lightning strike, serious burns on the left ear, behind the ear, and on the chest and neck. She also had in her left ear 108âdB hearing loss with irregular central perforation and in her right ear 52âdB sensorineural hearing loss. There was no hearing loss before the strike. A hearing aid was recommended for the right ear and good care and follow-up were recommended for the left ear. A lightning strike can cause serious audiological damage. Therefore, it is necessary to make a careful audiovestibular evaluation of the patients. Although there exist rarely healed cases from sensorineural hearing loss after lightning strike in literature, in our case hearing loss occurred bilaterally and then it healed unilaterally. This condition is quite rare in literature.

We randomly selected, from 8 hearing institutes in Israel, 429 patients with sensorineural hearing loss of at least 30 dB at one frequency and a speech reception threshold not exceeding 30 dB. Patients with middle ear disease or retrocochlear disorders were excluded. The results of audiometric examinations were compared binaurally and in relation to the selected factors. The left ear's hearing threshold level was significantly higher than that of the right ear at all frequencies except 1.0 kHz (p < .05). One hundred fifty patients (35%) had asymmetric hearing loss (more than 10 dB difference between ears). In most of the patients (85%) the binaural difference in hearing threshold level, at any frequency, was less than 20 dB. Age, handedness, and sex were not found to be correlated to asymmetric hearing loss. Noise exposure was found to be correlated to asymmetric hearing loss.\n\n[Subclinical sensorineural hearing loss in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis].\n\nPubMed\n\nTreviÃ±o-GonzÃ¡lez, JosÃ© Luis; Villegas-GonzÃ¡lez, Mario JesÃºs; MuÃ±oz-Maldonado, Gerardo Enrique; Montero-Cantu, Carlos Alberto; Nava-Zavala, Arnulfo HernÃ¡n; Garza-Elizondo, Mario Alberto\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical entity capable to cause hearing impairment that can be diagnosed promptly with high frequencies audiometry. To detect subclinical sensorineural hearing loss in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Cross-sectional study on patients with rheumatoid arthritis performing high frequency audiometry 125Hz to 16,000Hz and tympanometry. The results were correlated with markers of disease activity and response to therapy. High frequency audiometry was performed in 117 female patients aged from 19 to 65 years. Sensorineural hearing loss was observed at a sensitivity of pure tones from 125 to 8,000Â Hz in 43.59%, a tone threshold of 10,000 to 16,000Hz in 94.02% patients in the right ear and in 95.73% in the left ear. Hearing was normal in 8 (6.84%) patients. Hearing loss was observed in 109 (93.16%), and was asymmetric in 36 (30.77%), symmetric in 73 (62.37%), bilateral in 107 (91.45%), unilateral in 2 (1.71%), and no conduction and/or mixed hearing loss was encountered. Eight (6.83%) patients presented vertigo, 24 (20.51%) tinnitus. Tympanogram type A presented in 88.90% in the right ear and 91.46% in the left ear, with 5.98 to 10.25% type As. Stapedius reflex was present in 75.3 to 85.2%. Speech discrimination in the left ear was significantly different (p = 0.02)in the group older than 50 years. No association was found regarding markers of disease activity, but there was an association with the onset of rheumatoid arthritis disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had a high prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss for high and very high frequencies. Copyright Â© 2015 Academia Mexicana de CirugÃ­a A.C.

Patients and methods A total of 41 RA patients (2 males, 39 females; mean age 46.5Â±10.2 years; range 20 to 63 years) with no known traditional cardiovascular risk factors were included. Routine clinical and laboratory assessments for RA patients were performed. Pure tone air (250-8000 Hz) and bone conduction (250-6000 Hz) thresholds were obtained, tympanograms and impedance audiometry were conducted. Sensorineural hearing impairment was defined if the average thresholds were â¥25 decibels. Carotid intima-media thickness was assessed and classified with a cut-off point of 0.6 mm. Results Thirteen patients (31.7%) had normal audition, while 28 (68.3%) had hearing impairment. Of these, 22 had bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment. Four patients had conductive hearing impairment (right in three patients and left in one patient). Patients with sensorineural hearing impairment had increased carotid intima-media thickness in the media segment of carotid common artery compared to patients with normal hearing (right ear p=0.007; left ear p=0.075). Thickening of the carotid intima-media thickness was associated with sensorineural hearing impairment in RA patients. Conclusion Rheumatoid arthritis patients should be evaluated by carotid intima-media thickness as a possible contributing factor of hearing impairment in patients without cardiovascular risk factors.

It is conjectured that SSNHL is closely related to the changes in the cardiovascular system, hematological system, endocrine system, and/or some other systems due to pregnancy. These changes possibly evoke disorders of cochlear circulation or cochlear fluid homeostasis leading to SSNHL. Two SSNHL cases were observed in our clinic, and their clinical features were analyzed. In one patient the SSNHL was likely to be related to the disturbance of cochlear fluid homestasis and in the other it might be induced by some disorders in cochlear circulation. Based on their distinct clinic profiles, we defined a new disease, called \"pregnancy-induced sudden sensorineural hearing loss,\" similar to the definition of \"pregnancy-induced hypertension.\" This study also deepened our understanding of the etiology of SSNHL.\n\nSudden sensorineural hearing loss: results of intratympanic steroids as salvage treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nDispenza, Francesco; De Stefano, Alessandro; Costantino, Claudio; Marchese, Donatella; Riggio, Francesco\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe aim of the present study was to verify the efficacy and the safety of intratympanic dexamethasone to treat sudden sensorineural hearing loss as salvage therapy. A prospective study was conducted on patients affected by idiopathic sudden hearing loss who were treated before with some systemic therapy, but without recovery of the hearing The patients able to undergo the study, but who refused salvage treatment were considered as control group. A solution of Dexamethasone 4 mg/ml was then injected through the posterior-inferior quadrant filling completely the middle ear. The follow-up in the following 6 months included an audiogram every month. The number of patients treated with salvage therapy was 36. The patients who refused treatment were further 10. The salvage treatment was done with a mean delay of 24.3 days from the onset of symptoms. Mean hearing threshold after the onset of sudden hearing loss at PTA was 66.5 dB. After the failed treatment the mean PTA was 59.6 dB. The mean PTA after the intratympanic steroid administration was 46.8 dB, with a mean improvement of 12.8 dB. No hearing change was noted in the 10 patients who refused salvage therapy. The patients that assumed systemic steroid as first therapy showed a better PTA threshold after the salvage intratympanic treatment (p<0.01). A significant difference (p<0.05) of hearing recovery was evidenced between non-smoker patients and those with smoking habit. Our data showed that a salvage treatment with intratympanic dexamethasone should be suggested to all patients who failed the first systemic treatment. The systemic steroid therapy done before the salvage treatment seems to exert a protective role for the inner ear, as shown by our series. On the contrary the smoke habit is a negative prognostic factor in the hearing recovery. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Perinatal risk factors of infants with hearing loss were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications. Our observations demonstrated an association of hearing loss with a higher incidence of perinatal complications. Ototoxicity appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of ototoxic drugs, particularly aminoglycosides and furosemide. Finally, we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audiologic assessment in sick preterm children as hearing loss is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe.\n\nSpeech recognition in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Andrade, Adriana Neves; Iorio, Maria Cecilia Martinelli; Gil, Daniela\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHearing loss can negatively influence the communication performance of individuals, who should be evaluated with suitable material and in situations of listening close to those found in everyday life. To analyze and compare the performance of patients with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss in speech recognition tests carried out in silence and with noise, according to the variables ear (right and left) and type of stimulus presentation. The study included 19 right-handed individuals with mild-to-moderate symmetrical bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, submitted to the speech recognition test with words in different modalities and speech test with white noise and pictures. There was no significant difference between right and left ears in any of the tests. The mean number of correct responses in the speech recognition test with pictures, live voice, and recorded monosyllables was 97.1%, 85.9%, and 76.1%, respectively, whereas after the introduction of noise, the performance decreased to 72.6% accuracy. The best performances in the Speech Recognition Percentage Index were obtained using monosyllabic stimuli, represented by pictures presented in silence, with no significant differences between the right and left ears. After the introduction of competitive noise, there was a decrease in individuals' performance. Copyright Â© 2015 AssociaÃ§Ã£o Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia CÃ©rvico-Facial.

Wave V results from clicks and tonebursts revealed all intra- and intersession data to be reliable (p > 0.05). Linear regression curves were highly significant (p < or = 0.0001), indicating linear relationships for all stimuli analyzed. Comparisons between the linear regression curves from a previously reported normal-hearing subject group and this sensorineural hearing-impaired group showed no significant differences. This study demonstrated that tonebursts at 8, 10, and 12 kHz evoked ABRs which decreased in latency as a function of increasing intensity and that these LIFs were consistent and orderly (14 kHz was not determinable). These results will contribute information to facilitate the establishment of change criteria used to predict change in hearing during treatment with ototoxic medications.\n\nAcute otitis media associated bilateral sudden hearing loss: case report and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, A; Gutteridge, I; Elliott, D; Cronin, M\n\n2017-07-01\n\nSudden sensorineural hearing loss is a rare otological condition with potential for dire outcomes including permanent hearing loss. Although the majority of cases are deemed idiopathic, bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss represents a rare subset typically related to systemic conditions, with higher morbidity and mortality. A controversial association with acute otitis media has been reported, with few bilateral cases published in the literature. A very rare case of bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss associated with acute otitis media is described, with a review of the literature. The limited evidence available suggests that acute otitis media with tinnitus and/or bacterial pathology may have an increased risk of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, which is consistent with the case described. Although there is no sufficiently powered published evidence to provide definitive treatment guidelines, the literature reviewed suggests that early myringotomy and antibiotics may greatly improve treatment outcomes.\n\nImprovements in speech understanding with wireless binaural broadband digital hearing instruments in adults with sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nKreisman, Brian M; Mazevski, Annette G; Schum, Donald J; Sockalingam, Ravichandran\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThis investigation examined whether speech intelligibility in noise can be improved using a new, binaural broadband hearing instrument system. Participants were 36 adults with symmetrical, sensorineural hearing loss (18 experienced hearing instrument users and 18 without prior experience). Participants were fit binaurally in a planned comparison, randomized crossover design study with binaural broadband hearing instruments and advanced digital hearing instruments. Following an adjustment period with each device, participants underwent two speech-in-noise tests: the QuickSIN and the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT). Results suggested significantly better performance on the QuickSIN and the HINT measures with the binaural broadband hearing instruments, when compared with the advanced digital hearing instruments and unaided, across and within all noise conditions.\n\nDistribution of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 alleles in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nYeo, S W; Chang, K H; Suh, B D; Kim, T G; Han, H\n\n2000-09-01\n\nThis study was performed to investigate the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and susceptibility to sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the Korean population. HLA-A and HLA-B typing using a standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique and HLA-DRB1 genotyping were performed in 35 patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss and in 206 healthy controls. Prednisone (usual dose 60 mg/day) was administered for 6 days and tapered for an additional 4-6 days. Both initial hearing levels at the onset of deafness and final hearing levels after treatment were examined and evaluated for association with HLA alleles. The frequency of HLA-DRB1*14 was increased in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss compared with controls (relative risk [RR] = 2.7, p = 0.016). The frequencies of HLA-A2, -A31, -B52, -B61, -DRB1*04, -DRB1*11 and -DRB1*12 were slightly higher than in the controls, but did not reach statistical significance. When an association between the treatment results and HLA alleles was also evaluated, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*04 was found to be increased in the patients who did not respond to steroid treatment compared with both patients who responded well to steroid (50%, vs 16%, p = 0.034) and controls (RR = 3.0, p = 0.046). These results suggest that there is an association between HLA-DRB1*14 and disease susceptibility and that the presence of HLA-DRB1*04 may be an useful marker for predicting a poor prognosis in Korean patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nThe evidence base for the application of contralateral bone anchored hearing aids in acquired unilateral sensorineural hearing loss in adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaguley, D M; Bird, J; Humphriss, R L; Prevost, A T\n\n2006-02-01\n\n. Acquired unilateral sensorineural hearing loss reduces the ability to localize sounds and to discriminate in background noise. . Four controlled trials attempt to determine the benefit of contralateral bone anchored hearing aids over contralateral routing of signal (CROS) hearing aids and over the unaided condition. All found no significant improvement in auditory localization with either aid. Speech discrimination in noise and subjective questionnaire measures of auditory abilities showed an advantage for bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) > CROS > unaided conditions. . All four studies have material shortfalls: (i) the BAHA was always trialled after the CROS aid; (ii) CROS aids were only trialled for 4 weeks; (iii) none used any measure of hearing handicap when selecting subjects; (iv) two studies have a bias in terms of patient selection; (v) all studies were underpowered (vi) double reporting of patients occurred. . There is a paucity of evidence to support the efficacy of BAHA in the treatment of acquired unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Clinicians should proceed with caution and perhaps await a larger randomized trial. . It is perhaps only appropriate to insert a BAHA peg at the time of vestibular schwanoma tumour excision in patients with good preoperative hearing, as their hearing handicap increases most.\n\nRandomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of ozone therapy as treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nRagab, A; Shreef, E; Behiry, E; Zalat, S; Noaman, M\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTo investigate the safety and efficacy of ozone therapy in adult patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group, clinical trial. Forty-five adult patients presented with sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and were randomly allocated to receive either placebo (15 patients) or ozone therapy (auto-haemotherapy; 30 patients). For the latter treatment, 100 ml of the patient's blood was treated immediately with a 1:1 volume, gaseous mixture of oxygen and ozone (from an ozone generator) and re-injected into the patient by intravenous infusion. Treatments were administered twice weekly for 10 sessions. The following data were recorded: pre- and post-treatment mean hearing gains; air and bone pure tone averages; speech reception thresholds; speech discrimination scores; and subjective recovery rates. Significant recovery was observed in 23 patients (77 per cent) receiving ozone treatment, compared with six (40 per cent) patients receiving placebo (p < 0.05). Mean hearing gains, pure tone averages, speech reception thresholds and subjective recovery rates were significantly better in ozone-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (p < 0.05). Ozone therapy is a significant modality for treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss; no complications were observed.\n\nEvaluation of very low birth weight (â¤ 1,500 g) as a risk indicator for sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nBorkoski-Barreiro, Silvia A; FalcÃ³n-GonzÃ¡lez, Juan C; LimiÃ±ana-CaÃ±al, JosÃ© M; Ramos-MacÃ­as, Angel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHearing plays an essential role in the acquisition, development and maintenance of the properties of the speech and language. Birth weight is an indicator of biological maturation of the newborn. Premature newborns with very low birth weight (VLBW<1,500 g) constitute a group with the highest risk of sensorineural hearing loss. Our objective was to ascertain the degree of hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and presence of the association to other risk factors for hearing loss in VLBW infants included in the Universal Hearing Loss Screening Programme at the University Mother-Child Hospital of Gran Canaria (Spain) in the 2007-2010 period. This was a retrospective study of 364 infants with VLBW, measured by transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response. There were 112 newborn (30.8%) referred for auditory brainstem response. A diagnosis of hearing loss was given to 22 newborns (2.2%), 14 had conductive hearing loss and 8, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), of which 2 had bilateral profound hearing loss. The VLBW newborn presented the association to another risk factor in more than a quarter of the sample studied. All those diagnosed with SNHL were premature. The percentage of VLBW newborns diagnosed with hearing loss is higher than expected in the general population. All those diagnosed with SNHL were premature and presented one or 2 hearing risk factors associated with VLBW. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.

Behavioral studies suggest that this difficulty may be caused by changes in auditory processing of the rapidly-varying temporal fine structure (TFS) of acoustic signals. In this paper, we review the presently known effects of sensorineural hearing loss on processing of TFS and slower envelope modulations in the peripheral auditory system of mammals. Cochlear damage has relatively subtle effects on phase locking by auditory-nerve fibers to the temporal structure of narrowband signals under quiet conditions. In background noise, however, sensorineural loss does substantially reduce phase locking to the TFS of pure-tone stimuli. For auditory processing of broadband stimuli, sensorineural hearing loss has been shown to severely alter the neural representation of temporal information along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea. Notably, auditory-nerve fibers innervating the high-frequency part of the cochlea grow increasingly responsive to low-frequency TFS information and less responsive to temporal information near their characteristic frequency (CF). Cochlear damage also increases the correlation of the response to TFS across fibers of varying CF, decreases the traveling-wave delay between TFS responses of fibers with different CFs, and can increase the range of temporal modulation frequencies encoded in the periphery for broadband sounds. Weaker neural coding of temporal structure in background noise and degraded coding of broadband signals along the tonotopic axis of the cochlea are expected to contribute considerably to speech perception problems in people with sensorineural hearing loss.

Eightyone patients (44 males, 37 females; mean age 40.4 year; range 18 to 72 years) who had treatment between January 2002 and December 2006 with diagnosis of idiopathic sudden hearing loss were evaluated retrospectively. These patients were divided into four groups according to the treatment they received. The patients who had combined treatment constituted the first group; those who had combined treatment and piracetam the second; those who had combined treatment and acyclovir the third; those who had combined treatment, acyclovir, and piracetam the fourth group. For the four treatment groups, in the pre-and post-treatment (10th day) evaluation of the treatment efficiency made by calculation of the hearing thresholds in 250-8000 Hz frequencies, no significant difference between the groups was determined (p>0.05). No additional benefit was obtained with acyclovir and piracetam in treatment.\n\nStatic and dynamic balance of children and adolescents with sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nMelo, Renato de Souza; Marinho, SÃ´nia Elvira Dos Santos; Freire, Maryelly Evelly AraÃºjo; Souza, Robson Arruda; Damasceno, HÃ©lio Anderson Melo; Raposo, Maria Cristina FalcÃ£o\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo assess the static and dynamic balance performance of students with normal hearing and with sensorineural hearing loss. A cross-sectional study assessing 96 students, 48 with normal hearing and 48 with sensorineural hearing loss of both sexes, aged 7 and 18 years. To evaluate static balance, Romberg, Romberg-BarrÃ© and Fournier tests were used; and for the dynamic balance, we applied the Unterberger test. Hearing loss students showed more changes in static and dynamic balance as compared to normal hearing, in all tests used (p<0.001). The same difference was found when subjects were grouped by sex. For females, Romberg, Romberg-BarrÃ©, Fournier and Unterberger test p values were, respectively, p=0.004, p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.023; for males, the p values were p=0.009, p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively. The same difference was observed when students were classified by age. For 7 to 10 years old students, the p values for Romberg, Romberg-BarrÃ© and Fournier tests were, respectively, p=0.007, p<0.001 and p=0.001; for those aged 11 and 14 years, the p values for Romberg, Romberg-BarrÃ©, Fournier and Unterberger tests were p=0.002, p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.015, respectively; and for those aged 15 and 18 years, the p values for Romberg-BarrÃ©, Fournier and Unterberger tests were, respectively, p=0.037, p<0.001 and p=0.037. Hearing-loss students showed more changes in static and dynamic balance comparing to normal hearing of same sex and age groups.\n\nCochlear implantation for severe sensorineural hearing loss caused by lightning.\n\nPubMed\n\nMyung, Nam-Suk; Lee, Il-Woo; Goh, Eui-Kyung; Kong, Soo-Keun\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLightning strike can produce an array of clinical symptoms and injuries. It may damage multiple organs and cause auditory injuries ranging from transient hearing loss and vertigo to complete disruption of the auditory system. Tympanic-membrane rupture is relatively common in patients with lightning injury. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms of auditory lesions in lightning survivors have not been fully elucidated. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss caused by a lightning strike, who was successfully rehabilitated after a cochlear implantation.

Here, we compared patients with definite MD, vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) to elucidate the relationship between saccular hydrops and extent of SNHL. In this prospective study, we performed 3D-FLAIR sequences between 4.5 and 5.5 h after contrast media injection in patients with MD (n=20), SNHL (n=20), vertigo (n=20) and 30 healthy subjects. Two radiologists independently graded saccular hydrops. ROC analysis was performed to determine the hearing loss threshold to differentiate patients with saccular hydrops. Saccular hydrops was found in 11 of 20 MD patients, 10 of 20 SNHL patients and in none of the vertigo patients and healthy subjects. In SNHL patients, 45 dB was the threshold above which there was a significant association with saccular hydrops, with sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 90 %. In MD patients, 40 dB was the threshold above which there was a significant association with saccular hydrops, with sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 44 %. Our results indicate saccular hydrops as a feature of worse than moderate SNHL rather than MD itself. â¢ MRI helps clinicians to assess patients with isolated low-tone sensorineural hearing loss. â¢ Saccular hydrops correlates with sensorineural hearing loss at levels above 40 dB. â¢ Vertigo patients without sensorineural hearing loss do not have saccular hydrops. â¢ Saccular hydrops is described in patients without clinical diagnosis of Meniere's disease.\n\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging of Central Auditory Pathways in Patients with Sensorineural Hearing Loss: A Systematic Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nTarabichi, Osama; Kozin, Elliott D; Kanumuri, Vivek V; Barber, Samuel; Ghosh, Satra; Sitek, Kevin R; Reinshagen, Katherine; Herrmann, Barbara; Remenschneider, Aaron K; Lee, Daniel J\n\n2018-03-01\n\nObjective The radiologic evaluation of patients with hearing loss includes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to highlight temporal bone and cochlear nerve anatomy. The central auditory pathways are often not studied for routine clinical evaluation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging MRI-based modality that can reveal microstructural changes in white matter. In this systematic review, we summarize the value of DTI in the detection of structural changes of the central auditory pathways in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. Data Sources PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. Review Methods We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement checklist for study design. All studies that included at least 1 sensorineural hearing loss patient with DTI outcome data were included. Results After inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, 20 articles were analyzed. Patients with bilateral hearing loss comprised 60.8% of all subjects. Patients with unilateral or progressive hearing loss and tinnitus made up the remaining studies. The auditory cortex and inferior colliculus (IC) were the most commonly studied regions using DTI, and most cases were found to have changes in diffusion metrics, such as fractional anisotropy, compared to normal hearing controls. Detectable changes in other auditory regions were reported, but there was a higher degree of variability. Conclusion White matter changes based on DTI metrics can be seen in patients with sensorineural hearing loss, but studies are few in number with modest sample sizes. Further standardization of DTI using a prospective study design with larger sample sizes is needed.\n\nThe efficacy and safety of systemic injection of Ginkgo biloba extract, EGb761, in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoo, Ja-Won; Chang, Mun Young; Yun, Sung-Cheol; Kim, Tae Su; Kong, Soo-Keun; Chung, Jong Woo; Goh, Eui-Kyung\n\n2016-09-01\n\nSteroids are currently the most frequently accepted agents for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL). However, the therapeutic effect of steroids is not always satisfactory. In this pilot study, we evaluated whether systemic treatment with Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) has an additive therapeutic effect in patients receiving a systemic steroid due to ISSNHL. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed. Fifty-six patients with ISSNHL were allocated to either EGb761 or placebo. In both groups, methylprednisolone was administered for 14Â days. EGb761 was infused intravenously for 5Â days in the EGb761 group, while the same amount of normal saline was infused in the placebo group. For the efficacy evaluation, pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) and short form-36 health (SF-36) survey outcomes were obtained before administration and on days 3, 5, 14 and 28 of administration. Twenty-four patients in each group completed the study protocol. There was no difference in hearing loss between the two groups before treatment. At day 28, air conduction threshold values in the placebo and EGb761 groups were 34.63Â Â±Â 28.90 and 23.84Â Â±Â 25.42Â dB, respectively (pÂ =Â 0.082). Speech discrimination scores in the placebo and EGb761 groups were 69.17Â Â±Â 40.89 and 87.48Â Â±Â 28.65Â %, respectively (pÂ =Â 0.050). THI and SF-36 scores in the placebo and EGb761 groups were similar. Although a combination of steroid and EGb761 for initial treatment did not show better pure tone threshold, compared with steroid alone, speech discrimination was significantly improved in combination therapy. Further studies will be needed to know if addition of EGb761 actually improves the outcome of ISSNHL treatment.\n\nStreptococcus suis meningitis with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuh, Hee Jae; Park, Kyoung-Jin; Jang, Ja-Hyun; Lee, Mina; Lee, Jang Ho; Ahn, Yoon Hee; Kang, Cheol-In; Ki, Chang-Seok; Lee, Nam Yong\n\n2011-07-01\n\nStreptococcus suis infection is an emerging zoonosis in Asia. The most common disease manifestation is meningitis, which is often associated with hearing loss and cochleovestibular signs. S. suis infection in humans mainly occurs among risk groups that have frequent exposure to pigs or raw pork. Here, we report a case of S. suis meningitis in a 67-yr-old pig carcass handler, who presented with dizziness and sensorineural hearing loss followed by headaches. Gram-positive diplococci were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures and showed gray-white colonies with Î±-hemolysis. S. suis was identified from CSF and blood cultures by using a Vitek 2 system (bioMÃ©rieux, France), API 20 STREP (bioMÃ©rieux), and performing 16S rRNA and tuf gene sequencing. Even after receiving antibiotic treatment, patients with S. suis infection frequently show complications such as hearing impairment and vestibular dysfunction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of S. suis meningitis in Korea. Prevention through public health surveillance is recommended, especially for individuals who have occupational exposures to swine and raw pork.\n\nPerception of dissonance by people with normal hearing and sensorineural hearing loss\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTufts, Jennifer B.; Molis, Michelle R.; Leek, Marjorie R.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether the perceived sensory dissonance of pairs of pure tones (PT dyads) or pairs of harmonic complex tones (HC dyads) is altered due to sensorineural hearing loss. Four normal-hearing (NH) and four hearing-impaired (HI) listeners judged the sensory dissonance of PT dyads geometrically centered at 500 and 2000 Hz, and of HC dyads with fundamental frequencies geometrically centered at 500 Hz. The frequency separation of the members of the dyads varied from 0 Hz to just over an octave. In addition, frequency selectivity was assessed at 500 and 2000 Hz for each listener. Maximum dissonance was perceived at frequency separations smaller than the auditory filter bandwidth for both groups of listners, but maximum dissonance for HI listeners occurred at a greater proportion of their bandwidths at 500 Hz than at 2000 Hz. Further, their auditory filter bandwidths at 500 Hz were significantly wider than those of the NH listeners. For both the PT and HC dyads, curves displaying dissonance as a function of frequency separation were more compressed for the HI listeners, possibly reflecting less contrast between their perceptions of consonance and dissonance compared with the NH listeners.\n\nLanguage Development and Impairment in Children with Mild to Moderate Sensorineural Hearing Loss\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHalliday, Lorna F.; Tuomainen, Outi; Rosen, Stuart\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose: The goal of this study was to examine language development and factors related to language impairments in children with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss (MMHL).

This study assessed the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy or ozone therapy in the treatment of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss, when either therapy was included with steroid treatment. A retrospective analysis examined 106 patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss seen between January 2010 and June 2012. Those with an identified etiology were excluded. The patients were divided into three treatment groups: oral steroid only (n=65), oral steroid+hyperbaric oxygen (n=26), and oral steroid+ozone (n=17). Treatment success was assessed using Siegel criteria and mean gains using pre- and post-treatment audiograms. The highest response rate to treatment was observed in the oral steroid+ozone therapy group (82.4%), followed by the oral steroid+hyperbaric oxygen (61.5%), and oral steroid groups (50.8%). There were no significant differences in the response to treatment between the oral steroid and oral steroid+hyperbaric oxygen groups (p<0.355). The oral steroid+ozone group showed a significantly higher response rate to treatment than the oral steroid group (p=0.019). There were no significant differences between the oral steroid+hyperbaric oxygen and oral steroid+ozone groups (p=0.146). The efficiency of steroid treatment in patients with severe hearing loss was low. It was statistically ascertained that adding hyperbaric oxygen or ozone therapy to the treatment contributed significantly to treatment success.

A complex, multistage, stratified geographic area design for collecting representative data from the noninstitutionalized US population. Cross-sectional data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2006) were available for 1533 participants 12 to 19 years of age who underwent audiometric testing, had serum cotinine levels available, and were not actively smoking. SNHL was defined as an average pure-tone level greater than 15 dB for 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (low frequency) and 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz (high frequency). Secondhand smoke exposure, as assessed by serum cotinine levels, was associated with elevated pure-tone hearing thresholds at 2, 3, and 4 kHz, a higher rate of unilateral low-frequency SNHL (11.8% vs 7.5%; P < .04), and a 1.83-fold increased risk of unilateral low-frequency SNHL in multivariate analyses (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.41). The prevalence of SNHL was directly related to level of SHS exposure as reflected by serum cotinine levels. In addition, nearly 82% of adolescents with SNHL did not recognize hearing difficulties. Secondhand smoke is associated with elevated pure-tone thresholds and an increased prevalence of low-frequency SNHL that is directly related to level of exposure, and most affected individuals are unaware of the hearing loss. Thus, adolescents exposed to SHS may need to be closely monitored for early hearing loss with periodic audiologic testing.\n\nEffects of sensorineural hearing loss on visually guided attention in a multitalker environment.\n\nPubMed\n\nBest, Virginia; Marrone, Nicole; Mason, Christine R; Kidd, Gerald; Shinn-Cunningham, Barbara G\n\n2009-03-01\n\nThis study asked whether or not listeners with sensorineural hearing loss have an impaired ability to use top-down attention to enhance speech intelligibility in the presence of interfering talkers. Listeners were presented with a target string of spoken digits embedded in a mixture of five spatially separated speech streams. The benefit of providing simple visual cues indicating when and/or where the target would occur was measured in listeners with hearing loss, listeners with normal hearing, and a control group of listeners with normal hearing who were tested at a lower target-to-masker ratio to equate their baseline (no cue) performance with the hearing-loss group. All groups received robust benefits from the visual cues. The magnitude of the spatial-cue benefit, however, was significantly smaller in listeners with hearing loss. Results suggest that reduced utility of selective attention for resolving competition between simultaneous sounds contributes to the communication difficulties experienced by listeners with hearing loss in everyday listening situations.\n\nPerspectives for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss by cellular regeneration of the inner ear.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlmeida-Branco, Mario S; Cabrera, Sonia; Lopez-Escamez, Jose A\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSensorineural hearing loss is a caused by the loss of the cochlear hair cells with the consequent deafferentation of spiral ganglion neurons. Humans do not show endogenous cellular regeneration in the inner ear and there is no exogenous therapy that allows the replacement of the damaged hair cells. Currently, treatment is based on the use of hearing aids and cochlear implants that present different outcomes, some difficulties in auditory discrimination and a limited useful life. More advanced technology is hindered by the functional capacity of the remaining spiral ganglion neurons. The latest advances with stem cell therapy and cellular reprogramming have developed several possibilities to induce endogenous regeneration or stem cell transplantation to replace damaged inner ear hair cells and restore hearing function. With further knowledge of the cellular and molecular biology of the inner ear and its embryonic development, it will be possible to use induced stem cells as in vitro models of disease and as replacement cellular therapy. Investigation in this area is focused on generating cellular therapy with clinical use for the treatment of profound sensorineural hearing loss.

HL is most frequently of sensorineural origin, being caused by the irreversible loss of hair cells and/or spiral ganglion neurons. The etiology of sensorineural HL (SNHL) is multifactorial, with genetic and environmental factors such as noise, ototoxic substances and aging playing a role. The nutritional status is central in aging disability, but the interplay between nutrition and SNHL has only recently gained attention. Dietary supplementation could therefore constitute the first step for the prevention and potential repair of hearing damage before it reaches irreversibility. In this context, different epidemiological studies have shown correlations among the nutritional condition, increased total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) and SNHL. Several human genetic rare diseases are also associated with homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and SNHL confirming this potential link. Accordingly, rodent experimental models have provided the molecular basis to understand the observed effects. Thus, increased tHcy levels and vitamin deficiencies, such as folic acid (FA), have been linked with SNHL, whereas long-term dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids improved Hcy metabolism, cell survival and hearing acuity. Furthermore, pharmacological supplementations with the anti-oxidant fumaric acid that targets Hcy metabolism also improved SNHL.

The etiology of sensorineural HL (SNHL) is multifactorial, with genetic and environmental factors such as noise, ototoxic substances and aging playing a role. The nutritional status is central in aging disability, but the interplay between nutrition and SNHL has only recently gained attention. Dietary supplementation could therefore constitute the first step for the prevention and potential repair of hearing damage before it reaches irreversibility. In this context, different epidemiological studies have shown correlations among the nutritional condition, increased total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) and SNHL. Several human genetic rare diseases are also associated with homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and SNHL confirming this potential link. Accordingly, rodent experimental models have provided the molecular basis to understand the observed effects. Thus, increased tHcy levels and vitamin deficiencies, such as folic acid (FA), have been linked with SNHL, whereas long-term dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids improved Hcy metabolism, cell survival and hearing acuity. Furthermore, pharmacological supplementations with the anti-oxidant fumaric acid that targets Hcy metabolism also improved SNHL. Overall these results strongly suggest that cochlear Hcy metabolism is a key player in the onset and progression of SNHL, opening the way for the design of prospective nutritional therapies.

Case-control study. Fifteen children < 33 weeks' gestation with significant SNHL born between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1994, detected within 9 months of birth, and 30 matched control children. Perinatal variables in the two groups were compared using non-parametric tests and conditional logistic regression (EGRET). Median birth weight for the index group was 960 g (range 600-2914 g) compared with 1026 g (range 410-2814 g) for controls. Children with SNHL had longer periods of intubation, ventilation, oxygen treatment, and acidosis, and more frequent treatment with dopamine or frusemide. Neither peak nor trough aminoglycoside levels, nor duration of jaundice or level of bilirubin varied between groups. However, SNHL was more likely if peak bilirubin levels coexisted with netilmicin use (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 14.2 (1.8 to 113.6)) or if acidosis occurred when bilirubin levels were over 200 micromol/l (OR 8.0 (0.9 to 71.6). Frusemide use in the face of high serum creatinine levels (OR 8.9 (1.1 to 74.5)) or netilmicin treatment (OR 5.0 (0.99 to 24.8)) was also associated with SNHL. At 12 months of age, seven of 15 children with SNHL had evidence of cerebral palsy compared with two of 30 controls (OR 12.3 (2.1 to 71)). Preterm children with SNHL required more intensive care in the perinatal period and developed more neurological complications than controls.
