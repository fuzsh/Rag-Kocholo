I'm somewhat leary of free download sites.(Alot are loaded with Adware, Spyware, etc.)\n\nHeck, I've been planning on getting some of Kurt Cobain's FM demo(which is in circulation right now) along with some other things but haven't due to the infected system.\n\nEdit: They have game music too?

Which is far better than McAfee.(which someone else put on to get rid of internet hijack that happened on my computer, afterward McAfee became a severe liability, so I removed it after it angered me with too many slow downs on my comp)\n\nI do have AVG on a disc, the one that the guy brought with him, but then he found out that my drives weren't accessing. He somehow accessed his computer put and McAfee in.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI remember that dude saying Spybot was mediocre(the one that put in McAfee)... But Spybot found everything else that McAfee didn't.\n\nMcAfee was only good for two things, getting rid of a hijacker and getting rid of another that kept making icons pop up on my desktop.

Seriously, I've done a few games on Game Maker before our computer crashed and I lost everything... (luckily I had a few burned to a disc). I never finished any games, just the demos: one point-and-click ball-popping game, and an RPG. They were kinda rough around the edges (kind of looked like Powered By The Cheat), but were enough for the moment. Need to re-download Game Maker sometime! Anyways, I ould only play Action 52 if someone paid me. Guys like those who make travesties like that need to scrub all the floors in Hyrule. (LOL another CD-I Zelda quote.)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI've messed around with the RPG Maker on the PS1, even made one game.(The only thing I don't like about it is that the Reviving spells only heal 1 Hit Point and can't be used out of battle)\n\nI no longer have it though... Mainly because my apartment was broken into.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nYes I have.\n\nAlso, I went on the Galbadia site and couldn't find any DQ music.\n\nI don't know if I went to a wrong version of it or not.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nThis is funny:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkHu_WNa6u8\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nThey had three Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons in the 90s, two that I watched abit of. One was more of a comedy type, while the other two(one of which I watched quite abit) were darker in nature.\n\nI also watched the movie that came out in the late 90s.\n\nBlue Laguna, I try that then.(I was amazed that they alot of anime and gaming stuff on Galbadia though, I seen Ducktales game music on there as well).\n\nThat guy on the link in my previous post made quite abit of fun at ol' Secret of the Stars.(It's still kinda of funny though)\n\nTeamsponkel is satire as well, but the guy(well, actually they're a duo) admittedly likes the game too and feels that despite some of it's flaws, there is something special about it.\n\nSomething kinda of funny about Secret of the Stars, you know the character art that I posted from Japanese version? Well, the US version has different art(Which was a common practice during the NES and SNES days)... The almost all of characters in the US art actually look younger than they do in the Japanese art. Dan(The little boy) is the only one that looks about the same.\n\nI'll find the US box art and show it to you here shortly, I also have a link to Secret of the Stars music(from Youtube) that I'll post as well.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=62982C2BA4F03D93&search_query=secret+of+stars+tecmo\n\nHere's the links with the music.(I don't know if any site has just the soundtrack, but it might be the case that some do considering the youtube ones)\n\nI haven't listened to much of them yet, but the Aqutallion battle music is pretty good.\n\nEdit in this:(Testing out image posting from this site at this moment, okay cool....)\n\nhttp://tartarus.rpgclassics.com/secretstars/title.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nAlbiet not much younger.... :D (Maybe a year for Ray, Cody and Leona, Tina, the one with purple-ish hair looks about two years younger however)\n\nWhen searching for the art, I didn't know that there was a seperate rpgclassics page for Secret of the Stars.\n\nwww.rpgclassics.com\n\nThis site has a mix of faqs for different RPGs and adventure games(Even a few imports here and there), I've went to it quite of abit. It's not expansive like Gamefaqs though.\n\nhttp://tartarus.rpgclassics.com/secretstars/ (No wonder I didn't see under the normal site sections)\n\nIt's a shame I didn't get to play it on my SNES, I was really starved from the lack of Dragon Quest games at the time.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nWow, that's a lot of stuff on that game! I watched part of the Games You Should Not Play review. LOLed at the Tom Cruise line! The game actually looks really good in my opinion. So what if it was translated funny? I love Engrish in my games.\n\nWhen you said the thing about Nintendo wouldn't let the pentagrams on the characters, that reminded me how they took the pentagram off Exodia in the English Yu-Gi-Oh. Censorship is very common in gaming. Many things get lost in translation...\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI don't know how serious he was on that little playthrough(although the fact that he beat that mini-boss with the Auto command was pretty funny, although I doubt it would be the same during a big boss fight).\n\nHeck, Dragon Warrior 3 and 4(1 and 2 on the NES had on old Royal-esque language to it) had a few translation hiccups here and there.\n\nOn Teamsponkel, they have a nonsensical dialogue counter(well... until he got tired of counting them). I think the big reason for some of the errors in the english version is probably because of it was rushed.\n\nLike the line in the later town in Secret of a Stars: I don't trust men, they all say one thing but. I'm not sure if I remembered that line right, but it was somewhere along those lines. But that line was one of the ones he marked it down for.\n\nThere is one typo in Secret of the Stars that they didn't fix and it's one of the words that you'll see the most in the game(You've probably already seen this):\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeDEiZAVnqw&feature=channel_page\n\nGames with typos and errors like this can be a blast to play, especially for similiar to why some people like B-movies.\n\nAs for Nintendo censorship, there were a few things that slipped through sometimes.\n\nKid Icarus had crosses in certain parts of the game. This is something Nintendo was known for censoring, although Kid Icarus was one of the NES's early titles. Kid Icarus is also known for having Venus De Milo statues in the final level(well, they're not that graphic) and the instruction booklet also has art for a certain enemy that I find funny. It's a Siren and she's topless. I'm surprised that got through more than anything.\n\nBionic Commando has Hilter in it, although his name was altered for US release. What they didn't censor, however, was the scene where his head explodes after you shoot the cockpit of his helicopter.\n\nMonster Party has some bloody scenes in it, in heavy loads at that. It's mainly the second half of the first level and the Round number scenes. It's really surprising that Nintendo missed that. The Japanese version was unreleased, but released here(The Japanese version was abit more graphic looking too, I bring up a link here shortly. It would be nice to find the rom of the unreleased version dumped soon).\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nMonster Party stuff:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DWSqAVIdTY\n\nhttp://www.unseen64.net/2008/08/07/monster-party-nes-beta/\n\n(In fact, the Youtube vid is embedded also in the Unseen64 link) :D\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nAnd don't forget there was an Assist Trophy called \"Devil\" in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.\n\nIn the cult-hit rhythm-action game Um Jammer Lammy, there was a lot of censoring. In the Japanese version, some of the lyrics referenced hell, the devil, angels, and even nature cruelty. Also, hell was one of the concert venues in the Japanese version. The US replaced all of these. Hell was replaced with a deserted island, and some of the lyrics were changed. Unfortunately, some of the stuff they removed made the story make no sense. I'll check out those Monster Party vids when I have the time.\n\nAs for old-school RPGs, I'm playing one from Genesis called Sword Of Vermilion. It seems to be a little annoyingly hard at times, but it's still pretty cool. Here's the box-art: http://www.mywii.com.au/.../Sword-of-Vermillion-1.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nCrap, that didn't show up. Here's another try: http://www.mywii.com.au/img/game/large/Sword-of-Vermillion-1.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nhttp://www.flammie.net/vse/trans/mdoropie/index.htm\n\nhttp://www.flammie.net/vse/trans/mdoropie/screens.htm\n\nMagical Doropie, this game was released over here, under the title Krion Conquest. (I happen to own this one)\n\nIt had some art changes, and removed all of the story but the intro before the game starts. They also took out a Pentagram that appears after each stage that is cleared.\n\nhttp://www.meltyfresh.com/neshouse/onlyinjapan/doropie/index.html (This link is even better)\n\nThis is an extra link.... I'm trying to find another that shows something that they were planning to do in the localization.\n\nhttp://www.flammie.net/vse/trans/mdoropie/francesca.jpg\n\nhttp://www.flammie.net/vse/trans/mdoropie/francesca.jpg\n\nHere it is. ^ They were originally going to call it Francesca's Wand. I even remember seeing it in an old EGM of mine.(I think it's the same one I'm looking for with that particular DJ Boy image)\n\nAnd here's another interesting thing:\n\nhttp://www.flammie.net/vse/things/rad/index.htm\n\nThis is a section dedicated to the comparison of Totally Rad(US NES release) and Magic John(Original Japanese release). Totally Rad was a makeover, a big one at that. While Krion Conquest was just the result of a heavy edit.\n\n(Sings Malcolm in the Middle) Life is unfair................. (I'm not sweating it though, especially since I've seen the unaltered version)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nhttp://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/snake-02/gift03.htm\n\nFound this on there too...\n\nKinda cute and funny.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI just got lucky with Um Jammer Lammy.\n\nWhile I still have the Um Jammer Lammy import, it's a shame I don't have a way to play it.(My PS1 was one of the stolen items) I was alot better at it than I was at Parappa. The Funny thing is my import of Um Jammer Lammy has an English caption option on it, which is for the songs and dialogue between the levels. They didn't have to do alot in the localization process.(which was retarded of them to omit the hell references just to get an E rating, I'm sure most of the players who played the games were at least in their teens) A line in the first song of Um Jammer Lammy was changed to reflect the changing of the Hell stage to an island. The Hell stages lyrics, though are what you're talking about being altered the most.\n\nI've seen the Elite Beat Agents game before, but never played it at all. A fair amount of music games from Japan usually get song changes, didn't the DDR games get some different songs for international release? Although that would also have to do with the songs being mostly unknown over here(Minus some people from the anime crowd).\n\nI do have other imports, like Pocket Fighter, Darkstalkers 3 and Albert Odyssey for the Saturn. Also Ranma 1/2(The one with Herb in it) and Dragon Quest 5 for the SNES.\n\nThere was something that they took out of Pocket Fighter on the US release for the PS1, which was the actual spoken Japanese dialogue during the intros and endings. Capcom just didn't want to pay voice actors(although considering their track record at the time when it came to english dubbing, this is not a completely bad thing. But still...)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI haven't gotten that PocketStation, in fact... I think that's the first time I've heard of it.(I could be wrong and just not remember)\n\nThe burglaries happened in 2006, the first one in July and the second one in November. Hasn't happened since, but the lion share of all of newer stuff I owned was taken at those times.\n\nThe first one had the most stolen, including a TV(and both remotes... thanks alot), electric guitar(It didn't work at that time), my newer game systems(Including a Dreamcast that died), several games including Dragon Quest 8 and Dragon Warrior 3, a VCR and one anime DVD.\n\nThe second had the least stolen, but it was the rest of my anime DVDs(they might as well had cut my legs off... it would have had the same effect) and one game. I wish I would have put them elsewhere, I'd probably still have them today.\n\nBoth of the times these happened, I was gone of course. And I know the people that broke in the second time were my upstairs neighbors, mainly because I locked the outside door.(my door was on the inside and their door were up the stairs, the outside door didn't look broken, it was just left open)\n\nThey were evicted later.(Too bad I didn't see if the maintenance guys would give me some of their stuff, they owe me for all those anime DVDs)\n\nMy RPG Maker was in the PS1 which was stolen in the first burglary. I was lucky I didn't have a computer at the time, it would have been most likely been swiped as well.(I used to use library internet early on when) Although none of my other PS1 games were stolen, not even the Um Jammer Lammy game. One of my anime CDs was taken as well(The Mahoromatic one) and a Nirvana import single that is extremely difficult to find. It doesn't help that I haven't parodied it yet.(One of my parody writing goals is to cover the entire Nirvana catalog, released and unoffically released)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nThat's was quite abit(there's an understatement) to post about. :D\n\nAnyway, I found out about some the censorship and localization info early on while I was still using the library's internet.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI am back, and I am fine. Man, I feel so sorry for you about the robberies. Parodying every Nirvana song? Good luck with that. That's a very good goal to strive for.\n\nI'm going to start getting hardcore into anime. I've watched a lot on Toonami, but I wanna go deeper. Where can I get some good, reasonably priced anime DVDs? I hear some of them go for around $100 per season.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nP.S. Check this page out for a good anime song: http://www.inthe00s.com/index.php?topic=37911.0 I promise you it's not a Rick Roll. Or a PINGAS Roll for that matter.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI'll look that here shortly.\n\nI've been watching that one guy's(the one with games you should never play of Tecmo Secret of the Stars) Let's Play of Pokemon Gold.\n\nPretty funny stuff.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI watched it, pretty good.\n\nAlso started watching a Secret of the Stars walkthrough, the guy playing it has sort of a love/hate view of it.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI've heard of those \"Let's Play (insert game here)\" videos. I might check some out. Let's continue posting YouTube videos here for now. Here's Choujin Sentai Jetman: www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FAdBkERrYY And also, I might be getting an account here soon. Silver Power said he might set me up an account sometime. I thank him heavily.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nClicked that for a quick look.\n\nI picked Charmander on the new file of Pokemon Leafgreen. I usually pick Squirtle, I really missed having a water type on my team until I got to Celadon.(Where I got an Eevee)\n\nI remember being like that when I picked Bulbasaur.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nLooks like the Power Rangers, although some people say on there say the Power Rangers were inspired by this.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI figured I'd post this link from RPGClassics as well:\n\nhttp://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/spike/index.shtml\n\nI found this one many months ago, it's kinda fun when you find things you've never heard of before.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nYeah, I half-way noticed it.\n\nhttp://www.gamingsanctuary.com/KConquestMR.html\n\nFound this link, which is a review of Krion Conquest.\n\nWhat Magical Doropie had:\n\n1. Stage Intros\n\n2. Cutscenes(Both of these were already known)\n\n3. Continues\n\n4. A worthwhile ending\n\nWhat Krion Conquest had:\n\n1. Francesca(Doropie)'s art changed\n\n2. Only one cutscene(before the start screen)\n\n3. No continues\n\n4. A crappy ending(no cutscenes)\n\nMagical Doropie/Krion Conquest is a Mega Man clone(I know this from playing it) of sorts. The playing style is similiar to Mega Man, the music, the way the heroine dies, life meter, etc.(The reviewer was surprised that they didn't get sued)\n\nThe US localized version is actually more difficult. The removal of the continues contributed to this, you also have to start a level over again if you die. The second to last boss(might be in the final area, since the reviewer didn't specify, I'm not sure if they were talking about the 4th area boss or the second to last boss in the final area) is alot more difficult due to an increase in stamina.\n\nI did go through the entire game myself, with a game genie, without it I can only get to the second main area in the game.\n\nThis is one of those instances where I've heard of a game being made more difficult, and boy is it a doozy of a boost.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nOn the topic of MegaMan clones, I played a freeware one for PC called Megabot. It was done on Game Maker and is insanely hard. Too bad I lost it when the computer crashed.... also on the topic of MegaMan, I chose what appears to be Protoman from the default avatars.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI remember watching some rom hacks of Mega Man 2(Japanese version), which were made harder.\n\nMy favorite is Rockman no Constancy(I think that's how you spell it).\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nRom hacks? I've actually played a few Mario hacks. Very good stuff!\n\nUpdate: I watched Power Rangers RPM today. Pretty good. The action sequences looked like they were taken directly from Go-Onger.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI seen one of the original Donkey Kong that was based off of Pink Floyd's The Wall.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nBased on The Wall? Weird.\n\nQuick question: What was the last game you beat?\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nPokemon Platinum, E4 wise.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nFor me, Choujin Sentai Jetman on Normal mode. I've been playing Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion recently on PS3. Ever tried it?\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI haven't.\n\nDon't have a PS3 for one.\n\nPS2, on the other hand, I do.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nEver feel that recent PS2 games feel like a toned-down PS3 version with horrible graphics?\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nNot really, because I haven't played a PS3.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nYeah, that question was irrelevant. I'll let you pick the next topic of discussion on this thread.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI don't know, other than I got a game not too long ago at work that was 10 dollars. I work in grocery and I guess they accidently got some video games, I found one that I wanted. Now I see another one there, which is Taito Legends 2.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI go to Food City Video Store occasionally, and they have a few xBox games for cheap. Too bad I dont have an xBox...\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI seen Guilty Gear 2(or X2 I think) for the XBOX there. I have owned Guilty Gear 2 before on the PS2, but man it's a hard fighting game.\n\nFrom what I heard, we got the games by mistake. They're selling them as used, even though most of them are new. I bought Neo Geo Battle Colloseum, it said it was used and had no instructions. But it had the booklet and no scratches that I could see.\n\nAs long they still have Taito Legends 2 tommorrow, I'll be getting it.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI got it on Friday.\n\nThe only real mistake on the back of the case was \"Puzzle Bobble 2\"(They show a different picture too), it's actually the arcade version called Bust A Move again.\n\nIt also has Kiki Kaikai which is the first game in series that's called \"Pocky and Rocky\" over here.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nThe only Taito games I've tried are Bubble Bobble and Operation Wolf on NES. Both are awesome.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI remember playing Bubble Bobble.\n\nPuzzle Bobble/Bust A Move are related, the latter ones in particular which have Bub and Bob in them.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI finished my Breed parody tonight, will be submitting it tommorrow.(It took me awhile to get back to it)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nAnd my username was changed...(It's not a hacker though, just something some of the others come up with)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nA Dragon Quest-y looking RPG that was unreleased:\n\nhttp://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/12/off-zarken-nes-unreleased/\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nSpeaking of lyrics:\n\nHave you ever wrote any original songs?\n\nEdit: I just went through the newer comments on my author page.\n\nTo the questions on the Anime Geek and Anime, Video Games and Nirvana I figure I'll answer here(I did answer them there as well, but it was the first time in awhile I looked, so it'll be easier to for you to read it here)\n\n1. There is Sailor Moon(I've seen plenty of others in H-doujin fashion as well) hentai, I even seen a Sailor Moon hentai parody video at a comic book store before I ever visited the net. As Rule 34 says: If it exists, there's porn of it, no exceptions.\n\n:D\n\n2. The Dave and Krist references were about Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic from Nirvana and the Nirvana box set(released in 2004) in particular, since they(and I imagine Courtney) went through alot of material to put on it.\n\nSorry for not responding to them earlier, I wasn't really thinking too much about Amiright at the time.\n\nThe I Am Error parody I did is not my best work, as it's a minimal effort parody(wrote when I was not as worried about things such as pacing and lyrical variety). I have thought about maybe revising it(I did it with my Drain You, About a Girl and Mexican Seafood parodies, the last one being a parody on the adult song parody site that is a cousin of this one) over the past couple of days.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI'd like to try to write some power metal lyrics, but the actual songs would have to wait till I get some kind of MIDI sequencer. Thanks for the responses.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI have a guitar, so it's no problem with me. I wrote a small amount of stuff before moving out on my own(including a couple of parodies) and abit more after getting my own place. Some were wrote as jokes, some are still fragments of sorts and others I plan on rewriting.\n\nI also have an original song about Gohan's superhero indentity.\n\nAbit of what I wrote was influenced by Nirvana.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nChecks Blue Laguna....\n\nYep, DQ is on here.\n\nCool!\n\nEdit: But it looks like it only has images for the most part...(Didn't have any music under the section, unless I need to click something first)\n\nExtra Edit: Oh wait, they have some for 7 and 8, there are some tracks I like from those games, but they're not my biggest favs.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nNow I feel silly. Another site that I'm a member of, Woodus(Dragon's Den, a DQ/DW fan site), has MP3s from the games. Why didn't I think of looking there?\n\n:D\n\n(Am now listening to DQ2's normal battle theme)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI'm happy that you found your DQ MP3s. I've been playing Final Fantasy 6 on PS1 recently.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nKarma for ya.\n\nHere's the link:\n\nhttp://www.woodus.com/den/music/mp3.php?desc=dq5snes\n\nIt's on the 5th game, but the other games are listed on side in case you're interested.\n\nThat's the first time I heard alittle of DQ6's music(since I haven't played the game).*\n\nEdit: Except for Happy Humming, which is on Flyingomelette.*\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI'll check that out. Oh, and I started doing one anime song per day over on the anime songs thread. Check it out.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nOkay :)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nI played abit of Puchi Carat on the Taito Legends 2 collection. It's like a combination of Arkanoid and Columns.\n\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/data/568519.html\n\n^ Puchi Carat\n\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/image/584096.html\n\n^ Arkanoid\n\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/console/genesis/image/586114.html\n\n^ Columns\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI've played both Arkanoid and Columns. Both are pretty cool, but combining them would be cool. I'll check that out.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nIt's a pretty hard game and I was playing on Beginner.\n\nOne of the interesting things about the Taito Legends compilation is the fact that a solid amount of the games were originally never released over here(whether it was arcade or home port).\n\nI know Puchi Carat(as far as I can tell) has never had a US release. I think I'll check to make sure, but I'm sure it wasn't.\n\nEdit: It wasn't.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nThe playing style is mainly Arkanoid, the gems that are lined up look alittle like Columns. The gems stay in place are act as lines, you bounce a ball around to knock out the gems. After a certain period of time, more lines of gems start to come down. If you miss hitting the ball with your track, more lines of gems come down.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9-yfka-YY4\n\nWhen reading through Punch Out article on Hardcoregaming101, I found out about a ripoff of both Punch Out and The Super Mario Brothers. The vid that I linked up is a clone of the later, it started out on computers in the 80s(but got taken off shelves after Nintendo threaten legal action), this is a DS form of the game.\n\nWhen I looked at the old Amiga/Commadore versions, the similiarities were far too obvious. It's less glaring on the DS one.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nSpeaking of Taito Legends 2 again...\n\nI was playing another puzzle game on there called Cleopatra's Fortune. It's sort of a combo between Tetris and Columns.(They seem to have Columns style combined alot on some of their puzzle games)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/image/581465.html\n\nThe one on my compilation is the arcade version, I didn't know there was a PS1 version out that came over here. I never heard of it before getting the Taito Legends 2.\n\nCome to think of it... I need to check and see what the first Taito Legends compilation has. I imagine Bubble Bobble is one of the games.\n\nEdit: First one does have Bubble Bobble.\n\nI need to look up some info involving Puzzle Bobble games. I haven't had much in the way of gaming magazines, so I need to find out if there are any compilations of it on the PS2, otherwise I'll be on a manhunt for the 4th game.(And a working PS1 memory card)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nI played Bust-A-Move, and I think that counts as Puzzle Bobble. Very addicting. Bubble Bobble is one of my fave NES games, but you have to have 2 players to get the best ending.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nYes, Bust a move is Puzzle Bobble. For some reason I've been in the habit of calling it's original Japanese name most of the time.(I don't have a problem the international title of it though)\n\nI didn't see anything on a compilation for that Bust a move though, which means I'll have to find the original game and a PS1 memory card again(A shame PS2 memory cards don't work on PS1 titles).\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nYeah, the PS2 memory card incompatibility makes no sense. If you can store PS1 saves on a PS2 card, why can't you use them?!\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nConsidering that PS2 plays PS1 games, it definetly makes no sense.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nShame they dropped PS2 compatibility with the PS3. Is there no love for older stuff?\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nWith them, apparently not.(Other than money)\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: DJ Blaze\n\nOf course. Hey, the new PS3 can still play PS1 games, plus you can download them.\n\nSubject: Re: Sayaka Minami - Hatsukoi (Japanese and English Lyrics)\n\nWritten By: Step-chan\n\nThe only thing stopping me with that is the current price of the PS3."
