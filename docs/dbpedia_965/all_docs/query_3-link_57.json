        "text": "With the sokuirei (Ceremony of Ascension) for Emperor Naruhito having taken place on Oct. 22, 2019—the grandest of celebrations marking a new future for the Chrysanthemum Throne—we’re looking back a piece from KJ Issue 9 (Winter 1989), “Japan’s Other Emperor.” Author David Kubiak presents a lively and engrossing romp through Japan’s history of imperial ascension, navigating the motley plotting, deception, spiritualism, and debauchery that wrought the path to the Throne from the 14th to 20th centuries. Filled with excellent anecdotes (including where the family name Kumazawa, or “bear swamp” originates) Kubiak’s writing remains a refreshing look at the context that has led to the festivities we see today.\n\nWhat was the title of the reigning dynasty from the time when Nurhachi assumed the title of “khan” to the time when Hong Taiji declared himself emperor? There remains controversy among scholars as to whether the title “Jin” 金 or “Later Jin” 後金 was used, or if both were in use during different periods. Based on voluminous historical sources dating to the pre-Qing period, which have been published and even digitized in recent years, in addition to conducting the first comprehensive search of relevant Manchu and Chinese sources as well as artifacts, the authors have confirmed that there is no conclusive evidence proving that “Later Jin” was once used as the title of the reigning dynasty. Based on over a hundred instances of official usage of the title “Jin,” the authors have also concluded that the title of the reigning dynasty remained “Jin” during the entire pre-Qing period and that “Tianming” (Mandate of Heaven) was not the title of an emperor’s reign.\n\nThe main issue of this paper is the role of two empresses: Chinese Wu Zhao (624-705) and Japanese Koken (Shotoku, 718-770) in the history and religion in China and Japan. Both female rulers took Buddhist percepts and patronized the Buddhist Sangha in order to legitimate their power. As the female rulers in the mostly patriarchal society, both Wu Zhao and Koken had numerous enemies among the formidable court officials and influential families who opposed their rule. Therefore, they both used various auspicious signs and omens as the calculated political tools to secure their position. In various documents (edicts, manuals etc.) both Wu Zhao and Koken used the examples, mostly from Buddhism, to show their legitimate status. However, despite of their contribution in the state government and religious system, both empresses Wu Zhao and Koken were reviled as bad rulers by the later Confucian historians who resented their patronage of Buddhism and the fact that they were female rulers."
