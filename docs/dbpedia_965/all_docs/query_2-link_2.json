        "text": "Romaji and English translation of the song Bath Room from the album NIL by the GazettE.\n\nLyrics originally sung in English are in italics , and words or phrases I felt were implied are in [brackets] in the translation.\n\nI also (usually) put repeats of chorus/verses/stanzas in [brackets] if they’re not written that way in the original lyrics for ease of singing along.\n\nIf he writes a word in the lyrics but doesn’t sing it, I put it in light grey to make it easier to skip when singing along.\n\nI usually romajize katakana characters in CAPITALS, and keep punctuation and line spacing as close to the original booklet as possible. If you see me putting spaces before punctuation at the end of a sentence or writing things in mixed-case capitals, that’s because it’s how it was in the booklet.\n\nAny comments I had during the romajization/translation process will be included as footnotes so as not to disturb the flow of the song. They’re not required reading, but Ruki does some pretty nifty things with his lyrics/kanji choices, or sometimes there’s further explanations about words or phrases in there.\n\nBath Room: Romaji\n\nNemurenai no wa naze? shizukesa ni yoi shireteta\n\nShimetta heya de hitori mata kuchizu sameba munashiku\n\nNemurenai no wa naze? anata ga mieta kara\n\nShiten wa nureta yuka atama wo kashigete nemutteru\n\nShiritaku mo nai youna genjitsu ni tada mu kanjou de\n\nKoe mo dasazu zutto matataki sura wasurete anata ni mitoreteita\n\nNemutte shima itai mezame dake wo osorete\n\nSubete wo wasuretai migatte na zaregoto ne\n\nAnata no namae wo yobu kamoku ni ki ga fureru\n\nYaseta kata wo tsutsumi1 sakenda ka hoso sugita nukumori ni\n\nShiritaku monai youna genjitsu ni fukaku kokoro obore\n\nKuchibiru wo kami koraeta namida sae imi ga naito shitta\n\nTachi tsukusu boku no haigo no koe\n\nHakidasu wake2 nado dou demo yokatta\n\nTada me no mae no anata ga totemo sabishi sou na kao de\n\nNani hitotsu deki nakatta jibun wo shinu hodo nikunda\n\nNamae wo kureta yuiitsu no anata e kono mama soba ni ite kurenai ka\n\nSou boku ni totte saisho de saigo no yasashiki “mama3”\n\nShiroi kabe ni sotte makka na enogu de anata wo fuchidotta\n\nMada atatakai hoo wo suri yosete shizuka ni waratte mise you\n\nOotsubu no namida ga anata to kasanatte hitotsu ni nareta ki ga shita [no]\n\nMabuta wo toji nukumori ga kieru koro boku wa anata no soba de\n\nBath Room: Translation\n\nWhy can’t I sleep? I was bewitched by the silence\n\nI’m still here, alone in this damp room absently humming to myself\n\nWhy can’t I sleep? Because I saw you\n\nThe only thing left here is this wet floor so I’ll lay my head down on it and try to sleep\n\nI don’t really care about this reality that I can’t understand\n\nI was so mesmerized by [the sight of] you that I was rendered completely silent, forgetting even to blink\n\nI just want to sleep because [at the moment] I’m more afraid of being awake\n\nI want to forget about everything But that’s just selfish nonsense, isn’t it?\n\nI call out your name because I’m going mad in this silence\n\nI grabbed your slim shoulders and yelled; they [felt] too thin, but still so warm\n\nMy heart is drowning in this deep reality that I can’t understand\n\nI bit my lip as I tried to hold back my tears because I just couldn’t understand\n\nI was frozen in place, even when the voice in the background\n\nspat out observations But it doesn’t matter anymore\n\nbecause your face, right before my eyes, looks so forlorn\n\nI guess there’s nothing we can do but hate our own mortality\n\nBut [I say] to you, the one who gave me my name, couldn’t you have stayed by me just a little longer?\n\nBecause as far as I’m concerned, you are my “mother” – gentle from the beginning to the end\n\nOn the white wall [behind you] you’re surrounded, almost tenderly, by such a deep scarlet color4\n\nYour cheek is still slightly warm when I touch it and I can see the hint of a smile [on your face]\n\nMy large tears fall onto you; I just feel so helpless\n\nI [gently] close your eyes; your warmth is already starting to disappear but I’m still here by your side5\n\nNote: Also check out DRIPPING INSANITY – it’s kind of a continuation or or alternate view of this song.\n\nThe kanji 掴み (tsukami – grip) is written, while 包み (tsutsumi – wrap) is sung; this gives the impression of the singer firmly – yet gently – wrapping his hands around her shoulders, as if to shake her to get her to wake up (not with the intention of hurting her).\n\nThe kanji 理由 (riyuu – reason, motive) is written, while 訳 (wake – conclusion from reasoning) is sung.\n\nKanji is typically pronounced haha but he uses the more Westernized “mama.”\n\nI think this line is referring to blood splattered on the white wall behind her.\n\nObviously, if you couldn’t tell by the end of the song, the woman the singer is talking about – someone admired as a mother figure (possibly his actual mother, since she was “the one who gave [him his] name” – but since he has “mother” in quotes, I don’t think so) – has died. I get the sense that she committed suicide in a bathroom (not only from title of the song – duh – but also the dripping sounds at the beginning of the song, the damp room, the wet floor), and I think it was suicide rather than, say, murder because he says even though her face is “forlorn” he can see the hint of a smile on her face, perhaps because she is finally free from whatever problems / illness / what-have-you caused her to choose to kill herself.\n\nThe line about a voice in the background “spitting out observations” gave me a lot of trouble, but my opinion is that there are one or more people in the room with the singer – such as an EMTs, police detectives, etc. – who are having a rather cold, clinical, or factual discussion about the situation, one devoid of the sorrow and compassion the singer obviously feels towards the deceased.\n\nFinally, throughout the song, the singer could be saying “sleep” and meaning “death” – wishing that he were dead along with the woman.\n\nNIL album cover art © 2006 King Records / JPU Records\n\nPublished by hanak0toba\n\nレベッカ ♥ 「葵」| the GazettE | ♪♫♬ View all posts by hanak0toba"
