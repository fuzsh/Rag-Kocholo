*soba ni ite yo Baby girl

I don't wanna lose you

SAYONARA nante mada iwanai de

I don't wanna be without you girl

sono subete wo hanasenai Cuz I love you

I need you girl

**Baby baby baby kimi ga soba ni inakya

Baby baby baby kono machi mo yozora mo

Baby baby baby tooku kiete shimau

Just say you'll still be mine cuz I love you

I need you girl

kimi ni aenaku naru nante kitto

kanashimi wa koukai no Reality

kidzukanai furi shiteta hitori For real kimi ga nagashita namida ni

Yeah yeah yeah

Baby you my everything I'd do anything for ya

Never knew another girly quite like ya

And I wanna excite ya, like-like givin' you what you wanna do, girl

If it's anyone I straight run'em

Unfadeable GD stun 'em what up what up

Can't put up put up when you're tellin' your gonna need time alone

Repeat *

Baby baby baby itsumo tonari ni ita

Baby baby baby dare yori taisetsu na

Baby baby baby kimi wo torimodoshitai

Just say you'll still be mine coz I love you

I need you girl

henshin wa todokanai All night long

shinji takunai yo If you're gone

koe kikazu mou dono kurai?

kono kimochi wo tsutaetai

mani au nara... Don't leave me alone

Yo, we used to be one-lovers on the run no doubt

Fo sho we had each others back that's a fact, yo

Never had a bit prob we'd solve and

Evolve like a couple should is all, that's all

warawaretemo ii sa arifureta Mistake

Too little too late now...

(I don't wanna let you go)

soba ni ite yo baby girl

Why'd you tell me good-bye?

omoide ni nante shitakunai kara

I don't wanna be without you girl

mitsukedasu yo kimi no koto Yes I love you

I miss you girl

Baby baby baby futari kiiteta Love song

Baby baby baby nagareteru machikado

Baby baby baby komi agete kuru omoi

Just say you'll still be mine coz I love you

I need you girl

ano yoru kawashita KISU ga ima setsunaku yogitta

sono egao wo zutto mamoru yo to (For you)

Oh yakusoku shita noni...
