        "text": "Early life and career\n\nBogart’s father was a prominent surgeon, and his mother was a commercial artist. He served in the United States Navy at the end of World War I, and he later began a stage career in New York City playing juvenile roles in drawing-room and country-house comedies. By the mid-1920s he had won a leading role in the comedy Cradle Snatchers (1925) and other plays, and the young actor with the distinctive lisp began receiving good notices from critics. Bogart often played the ascot-wearing playboy or country-club fixture who seemingly frolicked through life in dinner jacket and tails, which is ironic in light of his later screen persona as the hard-bitten world-weary man of few words. He is reported to have originated the classic line of the mindless society fellow: “Tennis, anyone?”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nBogart’s Broadway success led to roles in two film shorts—The Dancing Town (1928) and Broadway’s like That (1930)—and a contract with the Fox Film Corporation. His supporting roles in some 10 films made between 1930 and 1934 failed to make an impact, and the disillusioned Bogart returned to the Broadway stage. He scored his biggest triumph to date as the ruthless killer Duke Mantee in Robert Sherwood’s The Petrified Forest (1935). The following year he finally garnered some serious attention in Hollywood after reprising the role in the Warner Brothers’ film adaptation of the play. Bogart spent the next five years playing numerous supporting roles—mostly gangster types—and occasional leading roles in B-films. His best pictures of this period included Black Legion (1937), Marked Woman (1937), Dead End (1937), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), The Roaring Twenties (1939), Dark Victory (1939), and They Drive by Night (1940).\n\nStardom: The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, and The African Queen\n\nTwo films in 1941 marked the turning point of Bogart’s career. In High Sierra he played a killer with a tortured soul and a sense of morality—a departure from the one-dimensional thugs he had portrayed earlier. His performance as detective Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston’s adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett detective thriller, helped make the film a classic. He followed this with leading roles in such well-regarded films as All Through the Night and Across the Pacific (both 1942) before he was cast in what is perhaps his quintessential screen characterization, that of cabaret owner Rick Blaine in Casablanca (1942). Despite its hurried, chaotic production, begun when the script was only half-finished, Casablanca is one of the best in moviemaking history; it ranked third to Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941) and Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather (1972) on the American Film Institute’s 2007 list of the top 100 American films. Released just after America’s entrance into World War II, Casablanca’s topicality and sentimental cynicism helped to make it an enormous success. The film won the Oscar for best picture, and Bogart’s Oscar-nominated performance secured his newfound status as Warner Brothers’ top male star.\n\nFrom this success Bogart went on to compile an impressive list of screen credits. Few actors can match his track record for quality films: To Have and Have Not (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Key Largo (1948), In a Lonely Place (1950), The African Queen (1951), Sabrina (1954), and The Caine Mutiny (1954; Oscar nomination) are all regarded as screen classics. For his portrayal of a slovenly riverboat captain in The African Queen, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, Bogart received his first and only Academy Award. He seldom appeared in a truly bad picture, and his legend helped such minor films as Sahara (1943), Passage to Marseilles (1944), Dark Passage (1947), Beat the Devil (1953), and The Barefoot Contessa (1954) to achieve cult status.\n\nBogart’s screen persona was that of laconic reserve with the suggestion of complex underlying emotions. It was this duality that distinguished him from other “tough guy” actors, who relied on swagger and bravado to convey their anger with the world. Bogart, conversely, employed cool detachment to suggest world-weariness. He often gave his most ruthless characters a slight hint of decency, whereas the heroes he portrayed often had a dark or vulnerable side. He succeeded in making cynicism an endearing quality.\n\nBogart and Bacall\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Their rapport was evident in their memorable onscreen pairings in To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage, and Key Largo. They teamed again for a well-received television adaptation of The Petrified Forest (1955) that also starred Henry Fonda and were planning another screen collaboration when Bogart died in 1957.\n\nAlthough he was a popular actor during the 1940s and ’50s, Bogart achieved the status of a legend after his death. In 1999 he was named the top male film star of the 20th century by the American Film Institute.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
