        "text": "Humphrey Bogart (1899 - 1957)\n\nFilm Deaths[]\n\nMidnight (Call it Murder) (1934) [Garboni]: Shot to death off screen by Sidney Fox.\n\nBullets or Ballots (1936) [Nick 'Bugs' Fenner]: Shot to death in a shoot out with Edward G. Robinson (whom he mortally wounds).\n\nThe Petrified Forest (1936) [Duke Mantee]: Shot (off-camera) by Police after shooting Leslie Howard; his death is mentioned when the people at the diner hear that the police had got Bogart.\n\nDead End (1937) [Hugh 'Baby Face' Martin]: Shot to death by police when he open fires on them, after first being shot by Joel McCrea and falling from a fire escape.\n\nKid Galahad (1937) [Turkey Morgan]: Shot in the chest by Edward G. Robinson.\n\nSan Quentin (1937) [Red Kennedy]: Shot to death by police patrol; he manages to make it to the front gate of the prison before dying.\n\nThe Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938) ['Rocks' Valentine]: Poisoned when Edward G. Robinson spikes his liquor.\n\nAngels with Dirty Faces (1938) [James Frazier]: Shot in the back by James Cagney when he tries to flee the office they were in.\n\nKing of the Underworld (1939) [Joe Gurney]: Shot to death by Federal agents.\n\nThe Return Of Doctor X (1939) [Dr Maurice Xavier/Marshall Quesne]: Shot to death by the police as he is about to kill Rosemary Lane.\n\nThe Oklahoma Kid (1939) [Whip McCord]: Shot to death by the mortally wounded Harvey Stephens, just as he is about to kill James Cagney.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties (1939) [George Hally]: Shot three times by James Cagney but we only see him fall after the first (non fatal) shot, followed by a shot of Cagney firing the last two shots. His body is not shown afterwards.\n\nInvisible Stripes (1939) [Chuck Martin] Wounded several times, but the fatal wound is from Joe Downing.\n\nVirginia City (1940) [John Murrell]: Shot to death in a shoot-out between his bandits and his Union Soldiers.\n\nHigh Sierra (1941) [Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle]: Shot to death by a police sharpshooter when he emerges from his spot on the mountainside to call down Ida Lupino.\n\nThe Wagon Rolls at Night (1941) [Nick Coster]: Mauled to death by a lion after he draws it attention away from Eddie Albert.\n\nThe Big Shot (1942) [Joseph 'Duke' Berne]: Dies in the prison hospital after a shootout with Paul Ridges.\n\nPassage to Marseille (1944) [Jean Matrac]: Goes down with his plane when it is shot at by German fighters.\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) [Fred C. Dobbs]: Hacked to death with a machete by Alfonso Bedoya. We don't see the actual impact of the blade, but Alfonso's arm movements as he chops. According to director John Huston, it's also implied that the character was decapitated, but the studio refused to let him extend the scene to contain a fake head rolling out of the shot.\n\nTokyo Joe (1949) [Joseph 'Joe' Barrett]: Presumably dies of several gunshot wounds sustained in a shootout with Sessue Hayakawa, while Bogart tries to save his daughter (Florence Marly). We last see Bogart being carried out on a stretcher; the doctors say that his injuries are taking quick effect and could perhaps be fatal, but it's strongly implied that he dies.\n\nSirocco (1951) [Harry Smith]: Killed in an alley explosion.\n\nThe Desperate Hours (1955) [Glenn Griffin]: Machine-gunned by police when he attempts \"suicide by cop.\" (See also Mickey Rourke in the 1990 version.)\n\nSpecial thanks to Paul, MP, Stephen, Mac, Fred and DeMan for information making this list.\n\nTV Deaths[]\n\nTales from the Crypt: You, Murderer (1995) [Lou Spinelli]: Beaten to death with a statue by Isabella Rossellini. (Although this episode was made 38 years after Bogart's actual death, he \"guest-starred\" posthumously through edited footage from existing films, with some dialogue redubbed by Robert Sacchi.) (Thanks to Andrew)\n\nNoteworthy Connections:[]\n\nEx-husband of Mary Phillips\n\nEx-husband of Mayo Methot\n\nHusband of Lauren Bacall\n\nGallery[]"
