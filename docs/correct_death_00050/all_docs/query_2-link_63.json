        "text": "One of Hollywood's most classic movie pairings is Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The couple shared the silver screen on several occasions and met one another while working on a film together. Unfortunately, their union was short-lived. Bacall was only in her early 30s when her husband passed away.\n\nBogart and Bacall's love story is legendary. The couple had a magnetic attraction that her children, who were very young when their father died, easily recognized. While the two acting giants are no longer on earth, their son has some strong memories about their life together that he's now shared with the public.\n\nHumphrey And Bacall Fell In Love On Set And Knew They Wanted A Family\n\nBogart and Lauren Bacall worked together for the first time in 1944. The pair starred in the film To Have and Have Not, and sparks flew. Just one year later, the couple tied the knot at Malabar Farm in Lucas, Ohio. The home was owned by Bogart's close friend, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Louis Bromfield.\n\nThe couple continued to work together after they got married. They starred in The Big Sleep (pictured above) as well as Dark Passage and Key Largo. Their son Stephen was born on January 6, 1949, while Bogart was filming Tokyo Joe."
