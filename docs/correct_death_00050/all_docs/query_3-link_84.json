        "text": "Close readers of last week’s column may have noticed that Humphrey Bogart, the legendary film star, had a walk-on part.\n\nIn writing about Mary Hamlin, the Canandaigua playwright who co-authored the first Hamilton in 1917, I noted that when Bogart was a teenager and summering on Canandaigua Lake, he would come over to the Hamlin cottage and chat with Mary Hamlin about plays.\n\nThe backstory for those encounters was that Bogart’s mother, the illustrator Maud Humphrey, was a Rochester native, and she and her husband purchased an estate on Seneca Point in 1899. She was pregnant with Humphrey at the time. They summered at the cottage until selling it in 1916.\n\nMy source for this information was George Hamlin IV, chairman of the Canandaigua National Bank & Trust, and Mary Hamlin’s grandson.\n\nThus, it would seem Bogart could have influenced the first version of Hamilton. That’s speculation, but it’s fairly certain that he may have saved the life of George Hamlin IV’s uncle Arthur. Family legend has it that in 1913 or so, the 3-year-old Arthur fell into the lake. Bogart jumped in and pulled him out.\n\nAs someone who cherishes Rochester connections – the number of links that noteworthy people have to this area – I didn’t find myself surprised that Humphrey Bogart would have a part in Mary Hamlin’s life. Sure, we all associate him with Hollywood, but he had to at least spend his summers some place, so why not Canandaigua Lake?\n\nBogart wasn’t really here long enough to be eligible for this column’s list of Remarkable Rochesterians, though I’m tempted. His mother is on the list, however, as she spent the first 18 years of her life in Rochester, and she went on to a very successful career as an illustrator for books and magazines.\n\nPerhaps, in honor of Humphrey Bogart, we might create an addendum to the list, a resting spot for luminaries whose light shone briefly in the Rochester area but much brighter elsewhere.\n\nJohn Lithgow\n\nThat would give us a place for John Lithgow, the stage and movie star. As I have written before, Lithgow was a Rochester short-timer. He was born at Strong Memorial Hospital in 1945 and only spent a couple of years here, as his parents, actors, moved often. His mother did grow up in Rochester, and Lithgow has talked fondly about visiting relatives here when he was young.\n\nIngrid Bergman\n\nI have placed the Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman in the short-timer category, as well. She was here for not all that long in the early 1940s while her husband was studying medicine at the University of Rochester. Some of her time was spent away, working on movies, including Casablanca with Bogart. I like to think that their Rochester connection created a bond, the start of a beautiful friendship.\n\nLouise Brooks\n\nThere are some people who have made the Remarkables list even though no one seemed to know they were here when they were here. Those famous recluses include the silent film star Louise Brooks, who spent the last years of her life quietly in Rochester before her death in 1985 at age 78.\n\nSon House\n\nAnd then there’s the blues legend Son House, who made a name for himself in the 1930s and then arrived in Rochester in the 1940s and lived in relative obscurity until he was rediscovered in the 1960s. He died in Detroit in 1988 at age 86. House’s time in Rochester will be celebrated in Revival: The Resurrection of Son House to be performed at Geva Theatre from May 1 through June 2.\n\nWhile Rochester looms large in a lot of lives, I suspect that there are some quite famous people hiding out here right now. Keep your eyes open.\n\nBeyond that, I’m sure there are some future stars in Rochester, many of them at the Eastman School of Music, certainly others at School of the Arts and other high schools.\n\nAnd don’t forget summer visitors. That kid pulling you out of Canandaigua Lake could go on to win an Academy Award.\n\nOn Remarkable Rochester\n\nRetired Senior Editor Jim Memmott reflects on what makes Rochester distinctively Rochester, its history, its habits, its people. Since 2010, he has also been compiling a list of Remarkable Rochesterians. Contact him at: (585) 278-8012 or jmemmott@DemocratandChronicle.com or Remarkable Rochester, Box 274, Geneseo, NY, 14454.\n\nRemarkable Rochesterians\n\nThe Remarkable Rochesterians list has always welcomed people who live near to, but not in, Rochester. Canandaigua’s close enough, and we added Mary Hamlin to the list last week. This week let’s put the name of a Canandaigua benefactor on the list that can be found at rochester.nydatabases.com:"
