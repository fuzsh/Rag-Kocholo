        "text": "Born Betty Joan Perske in 1924, Lauren Bacall lived a lucky life—and she knew it. In her 1978 autobiography By Myself, republished with additional material in 2005 as By Myself and Then Some, the word “luck” seems to appear more frequently than any other.\n\nIn these pages, Bacall—long painted as a difficult diva—recounts her life with a sense of humor, curiosity, and gratitude that’s miles from her icy, grande dame persona. From her worshipful flirtation with politician Adlai Stevenson to her friendships with everyone from Robert Kennedy to Vivien Leigh and Nicole Kidman, Bacall recounts her exciting life in an honest, emotional, and vulnerable way that’s rare to find in a celebrity autobiography.\n\n“I realize that I’ve lived a long time,” she wrote in 2005. “But still not long enough to suit me.”\n\nA Good Jewish Girl\n\nBacall was raised in New York City by her beloved, hard-working divorced mother and a tight-knit group of aunts, uncles, and a grandmother who originally hailed from Romania. Taught to be a “good Jewish girl” by her family of lawyers and executive secretaries, Bacall was a go-getting dreamer who knew the stage was where she wanted to be.\n\nWhen she wasn’t taking acting lessons (where she casually dated a young Kirk Douglas), a teenage Bacall could be found outside legendary Broadway haunts like Sardi’s, hawking Cue magazine in an effort to meet producers. “There I’d stand outside, stopping all and sundry to buy my products,” she writes. “I kept my eyes peeled for the sight of a recognizable producer, actor, anyone who might help me get a job. I really was crazy, now that I think of it, and rather fresh, flip, nervy.”\n\nBy 1941, the gawky girl with big feet had blossomed into an exotic beauty who caught the eye of legendary Harper’s Bazaar editor Diana Vreeland. After a trip to St. Augustine for a photo shoot, Vreeland was determined to squeeze onto a packed train back to New York. Bacall remembered the hilarity that ensued:\n\nOur group boarding the train—me leaning on Diana for the benefit of porters, conductors, God knows who—playing the death scene from Camille—trying to be brave—feeling a bit faint…Diana saying, ‘There, there, dear. Take it easy now, you have to rest.’ Not the best acting I’d ever seen—we were both overdoing it.\n\nBacall’s spreads in Harper’s drew Hollywood’s interest, and she was soon off to California to meet famed director Howard Hawks. Her entire family met at Lindy’s before she left for her new life. “They all had faith in me. They all loved me,’’ she writes. “They were sending me on my way with jokes, joy, confidence, and a few tears.”\n\nSlim and Steve\n\nIn 1942, Bacall went with her mother and Aunt Rosalie to see Casablanca. “Rosalie was mad about Humphrey Bogart,” she writes. “She thought he was sexy, I thought she was crazy.” Bacall was equally uninterested when her determined Svengali, director Howard Hawks, said he’d like her film debut to come opposite Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart. “I thought, ‘Cary Grant–terrific! Humphrey Bogart–yucch.’”\n\nNevertheless, Bacall was terrified on her first day shooting To Have and Have Not with Bogie and Hawks in 1944. Bogart put her at ease, joking and teasing her, calling her the name of her character, Slim. Slowly, an intense attraction grew between the 19-year-old Bacall and Bogie, who was 25 years her senior and married. Bacall writes:\n\nIt was about three weeks into the picture—the end of the day—I had one more shot, was sitting at the dressing table in the portable dressing room combing my hair. Bogie came in to bid me good night. He was standing behind me—we were joking as usual—when suddenly he leaned over, put his hand under my chin, and kissed me. It was impulsive—he was a bit shy—no lunging wolf tactics. He took a worn package of matches out of his pocket and asked me to put my phone number on the back.\n\nWhen Hawks found out about their affair, he was furious, and even tried to set Bacall up with Clark Gable. “Bogart likes his life—he likes the drinking and he likes his wife—you’re throwing away a whole career because of something that’s just not going to happen,” he warned her.\n\nBut Bacall believed Bogie was worth it. “I wanted to give Bogie so much that he hadn’t had. All the love that had been stored inside of me all my life for an invisible father, for a man,” she writes. “I could finally think of allowing it to pour over this man and fill his life with laughter, warmth, joy—things he hadn’t had for such a long time, if ever.”\n\nThe Battling Bogarts\n\nThe fact that Bogie was still in a toxic marriage to the actress Mayo Methot, his third wife—the press had nicknamed them “The Battling Bogarts”—meant that the two lovers were forever hiding out. Bacall was repeatedly wakened in the night by a drunken Bogart, much to her mother’s chagrin. One night, Bogie called Bacall and said to pick him up from the 101 Highway. With that limited information, Bacall took off, scouring the side of the road for hours.\n\n“As the sun rose, I caught sight of him—unshaven, wearing espadrilles, and with a\n\nlarge sunflower in his lapel,” she writes. “We were about a half-hour out of Newport—I don’t know how he’d got there. I slammed to a halt, rushed out of the car—there was no traffic—and into each other’s arms we fell.”\n\nAnother night, Bacall was on boat with Bogie in Newport Beach when the notorious Methot appeared:\n\nSuddenly Pat called down, ‘Christ, Mayo’s heading this way.’ I thought I’d drop dead from fright. There was nowhere to go. Bogie shoved me into the head, where I sat holding on to the door with my heart pounding so loudly I was sure it could be heard all over the boat.\n\nThe crisis was averted when Methot was convinced to go ashore. But soon after, a drunk Bogie called Bacall, as Methot taunted her in the background. “Listen, you Jewish bitch,” she slurred, per Bacall. “Who’s going to wash his socks?”\n\nMethot finally agreed to a divorce, and Bacall and Bogie made plans to marry in Ohio. In characteristic fashion, when Bogie was told that Life magazine wanted to send a photographer on the train with them, he was incensed. “Great,”\n\nBogie told Bacall, “maybe he’d like to photograph us fucking.” But his gentle side was revealed on the day of their wedding, May 21, 1945. As he and Bacall were wed, tears streamed down his face. “I couldn’t have wished for a man as incredibly good as this man was,” she’d later write. “He was to surprise and delight me continually in the ensuing years.”\n\nThe Real Rat Pack\n\nBogie and Bacall quickly became known for their free-wheeling entertaining and mutual gift for gab. “We were becoming a more and more popular pair—the word was getting around that it was fun at the Bogarts,” Bacall writes. If their light was on, close friends, including neighbors Judy Garland and her husband Sidney Luft, were welcome for a nightcap, no matter the hour.\n\nBacall grew enormously fond of Garland but was well aware of her many demons. “She was a complicated woman of tremendous wit and intelligence who had survived a distorted childhood and distorted marriages,” she writes. “She was fun and, when we’d sit quietly on an afternoon or evening, great company. It was hard for her to think beyond herself—it had been that way for too long.”\n\nTogether with the Lufts, David and Hjordis Niven, Mike and Gloria Romanoff, talent agent Swifty Lazar, and Frank Sinatra, the Bogarts formed the original “Rat Pack.” Spencer Tracy was an honorary member: “He lived a secluded life, but his heart was in the right place.” Bacall writes:\n\nWe held a dinner in a private room at Romanoff’s to elect officials and draw up rules...I was voted Den Mother; Bogie was in charge of public relations. No one could join without unanimous approval of the charter members. Nat Benchley, a visiting rat from New York, drew up an insignia for us—a large group of rats of all shapes and sizes in all positions. What fun we had with it all! We were an odd assortment, but we liked each other so much, and every one of us had a wild sense of the ridiculous.\n\nA Bad Romance\n\nDuring Bogart’s battle with esophageal cancer, Frank Sinatra was always around, always helpful. “Bogie always liked Frank,” Bacall writes. “Enjoyed his ‘fighting windmills,’ and Frank made him laugh.” But he knew why Sinatra was really there. “You don’t think he comes to see me, do you?” Bogie asked Bacall perceptively.\n\nAfter Bogart’s death in 1957, Bacall found herself a 32-year-old widow with two small children. Heartbroken and irrational, she threw herself into a giddy, volatile romance with Sinatra. Determined to “be cool,” Bacall learned to put up with Sinatra’s unpredictable behavior. “As a couple we were combustible. Always when we entered a room, the feeling was: Are they okay tonight? You could almost hear a sigh of relief when we were both smiling and relaxed,” Bacall writes.\n\nThe pair were soon engaged, and their mutual friend Swifty Lazar let the secret out to gossip columnist Louella Parsons. But Sinatra decided that it was Bacall who alerted the press, and abruptly cut her out of his life.\n\nBacall would not see Sinatra for six years. When they finally met at a party hosted by Lazar, Sinatra was drunk and ill-tempered, with a young Mia Farrow in tow:\n\nHe pulled the tablecloth out from under the glasses and plates, and amid the crash and spillage he shouted furiously at Swifty, ‘You—you were responsible for what happened between her and me!’ I almost laughed. It was Frank’s way of admitting finally that he did know it was Swifty and not me who’d spilled the beans.\n\nEventually, Bacall would come to see Sinatra’s devastating treatment of her as a blessing in disguise. “Frank did me a great favor—he saved me from the disaster our marriage would have been,” she writes. “The truth is, he was probably smarter than I: he knew it couldn’t work. But the truth also is that he behaved like a complete shit.”\n\nKatie to the Rescue\n\nPerhaps no friendship meant more to Bacall than her 50-year relationship with Katharine Hepburn, cemented in the Congo during the filming of 1951’s The African Queen. “She was loyal—demanding—pure and purely demanding—open—reserved—formally informal—proud—intimidating—exasperating—funny—touching,” Bacall writes.\n\nBack in America, the Bogarts became a tight foursome with Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The secretive couple were constant visitors during Bogie’s illness. Hepburn would become a mentor of sorts to Bacall, always available with warmth and common sense. It was she who finally convinced Bacall to end her troubled second marriage to stage star Jason Robards. In By Myself, Bacall recalls the last time she saw her dearest friend, by now battling dementia:\n\nThere were two large picture books—one with a shot of Bogie from The African Queen—one of Spence. As I showed each to her and spoke to her of these two men who meant so much to her, she miraculously seemed to brighten and understand…. That day when I was about to leave, she said, ‘Please stay.’ After I had stayed for a half-hour longer, I leaned over and kissed her cheeks many times after which she looked at me and whispered, ‘Thank you.’\n\nApplause\n\nDuring her Hollywood heyday in the 1940s, composer Moss Hart told Bacall, “Congratulations on your success...from here on you have nowhere to go but down.” Bacall soon found he was correct. She would never have the career she wanted in film, but found her greatest success once she returned to her hometown: New York City.\n\nUntil her death in 2014, Bacall was a fixture on the Broadway stage and scene, living in the legendary Dakota and winning two Tony Awards. Bacall adored the eccentricity and generosity of theater actors, and she recalled one night when a Broadway legend knocked on her dressing room door during intermission for 1970’s Applause:\n\nElizabeth, my dresser, opened the door and there was Ethel Merman. As I gasped, she charged into the room, saying, ‘Where’s the can?’… Out she came, saying, ‘You’ve got to stop doing this,’ as she hit her chest with her fist. In ‘Welcome to the Theatre,’ the first-act curtain number, I hit my chest several times and she said that each time my body mike would send a resounding roar through the theatre.\n\nBacall also continued her lifelong hustle. “I have tried to convince Martin Scorsese that I would be a perfect Mafia member,” she writes. “Why does it always have to be a man? He smiles sweetly, ‘Yeah, great idea.’”\n\nA true New Yorker to the end, Bacall stayed forever grateful for all she had seen, though she never got over the feeling of wanting more. “My life has had meaning, with the friendships full and valuable and essential to me,” she writes. “My children, Steve, Leslie, and Sam, are all different—all first-rate human beings with high standards. [...] They all have wit and a sense of humor and, thank God, I have hung on to mine.”\n\nAll products featured on Vanity Fair are independently selected by our editors.
