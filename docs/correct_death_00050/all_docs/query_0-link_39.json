        "text": "Humphrey DeForest \"Bogie\" Bogart (1899-1957) is a historic film actor. He portrayed Charlie Allnut in the 1951 film, The African Queen, which was an inspiration behind the original Jungle Cruise attraction as well as its 2021 film adaptation. Bogart also portrayed Rick Blaine in Casablanca (1942), which has its own lore and developmental history with Adventureland and the Jungle Cruise, as it was set-designed by Jungle Cruise imagineer Harper Goff.\n\nAppearances, allusions & tributes[]\n\nAttractions[]\n\nBengal Barbecue: In Bengal Barbecue, there's a photograph of Bogart as Allnut, across from Rose Sayer aboard the Jungle Cruise boat the Zambezi Miss, passing by the African veldt and trapped safari.\n\nThe Great Movie Ride: An audio-animatronic Humphrey Bogart appeared in this extinct attraction during the Casablanca scene. The prop plane was a supposedly authentic prop from Casablanca, which had its backside moved to the Magic Kingdom's Jungle Cruise and prior to the 2021 refurbishment had its origins alluded to via references to, \"Aero-Casablanca\".\n\nThe Magic of Disney Animation: There were two indirect allusions to Humphrey Bogart here. One was for the Casablanca parody CasaMousa with Mickey in place of Bogart, while the other was for an African Queen satire called, \"The Jungle Cruise\" with Mickey again replacing Bogart as male lead. Another is a parody of The Maltese Falcon (1941) titled The Maltese Duck, this time with Donald in place of Bogart's character Sam Spade.\n\nTrader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar: While Bogart is not directly referenced, Trader Sam has post-cards from Bogart's characters Charlie Allnut and Rick Blaine.\n\nParaphernalia[]\n\nJungle Cruise Adventure Game: One of the tokens for the Cruz and DeNyle families was modelled after Bogart as Rick Blaine.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nRick Blaine was made much larger in the Great Movie Ride than Humphrey Boggart was.\n\nIn an interview, Bogart's son Stephen Bogart (1949-) talked about parallels between the Jungle Cruise 2021 film and the African Queen.[1]\n\nGallery[]"
