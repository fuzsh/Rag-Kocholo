        "text": "Lauren Bacall, the award-winning actress and Humphrey Bogart's partner off and on the screen, has died. She was 89.\n\nThe managing partner of the Humphrey Bogart Estate, Robbert J.F. de Klerk, says that Bacall died Tuesday in New York. Bacall's son Stephen Bogart confirmed his mother's death to de Klerk.\n\n\"With deep sorrow, yet with great gratitude for her amazing life, we confirm the passing of Lauren Bacall,\" the @HumphreyBogart account tweeted late Tuesday.\n\nBacall and Bogart were married for 12 years until Bogart died in 1957. The couple had two children.\n\nCiting sources in the Bacall family, TMZ.com said the cause of death was a massive stroke that happened when she was at her home on the Upper West Side in Manhattan.\n\nBacall was also a longtime presence in the Hamptons, where she vacationed regularly.\n\nThe actress owned a home in the Hamptons and was a regular at East End fundraisers and social events, from the annual summer Rock the Dock fundraiser for the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor to the Hampton’s Film Festival. She was also known to shop at farmstands and egg ranches nearby. And she was one of the many celebrities over the years who first stopped at Grace’s Famous Hot Dogs, a trailer set up in front of owner Grace Almond’s Manorville house, for bite to eat at one of the picnic tables set up on the lawn, before continuing to her home.\n\n“I talk to my birds, my trees. I love my house. It’s my haven,” she told People magazine of her Hamptons home in 1981.\n\nShe was born Betty Joan Perske on Sept. 16, 1924, in New York City, the only child of immigrant parents. After her parents' divorce, she adopted a variation of her mother's maiden name, Bacal.\n\nBacall had set out to be a Broadway star. She played small roles on stage and modeled for Harper's Bazaar magazine, which published a photograph of her that was spotted by director Howard Hawks' wife.\n\nBacall was only 19 when Hawks cast her in her first movie, 1944's \"To Have and Have Not,\" as an American girl who shows up at a seedy hotel in Martinique. She won a place in Hollywood history with her sexy query to Bogart, \"You know how to whistle, don't you? You just put your lips together -- and blow.\"\n\nBacall and Bogart were married the next year after he ended his turbulent third marriage to actress Mayo Methot. Bacall and Bogart went on to star together in \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), \"Dark Passage\" (1947) and \"Key Largo\" (1948).\n\nShe appeared in more than 30 other movies, including \"Young Man With a Horn\" (1950), \"How to Marry a Millionaire\" (1953) and \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1974).\n\nStill, Bacall's movie career was rocky. In such films as \"Confidential Agent\" (1945) and \"Bright Leaf\" (1950), she essentially played the same role as in \"To Have and Have Not.\"\n\nA comic turn in \"How to Marry a Millionaire\" earned applause, but few of her other films were memorable and she became the self-proclaimed \"den mother\" to her two children, Stephen and Leslie, and a regular crowd of Bogart's drinking buddies.\n\nMuch of Bacall's allure came from what was known as \"The Look,\" a sexy but soft glance. She explained it by saying: \"I used to tremble from nerves so badly that the only way I could hold my head steady was to lower my chin practically to my chest and look up at Bogie. That was the beginning of 'The Look.' \"\n\nAfter Bogart's death in 1957 at age 57, Bacall had a well-publicized affair with Frank Sinatra and a stormy eight-year marriage to actor Jason Robards that produced a son, Sam, who would become an actor.\n\nBacall worked occasionally in films in the 1960s and '70s, notably in \"Harper\" (1966) opposite Paul Newman, the all-star Agatha Christie hit \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1974) and \"The Shootist\" (1976), which was John Wayne's last film.\n\nHer career revived in fits and starts through the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in her first Oscar nomination for her supporting role as Barbra Streisand's domineering mother in \"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\" Bacall won the Golden Globe and several other honors for the role, but the Oscar continued to elude her.\n\nAfter her film career cooled, Bacall returned to the stage. She won best actress Tony Awards for \"Applause\" in 1970 and \"Woman of the Year\" in 1981. Over the years she had transformed her persona from a willowy temptress with a come-hither look to a shrewd and worldly woman.\n\nOf her career and life, Bacall once said, \"I traveled by roller coaster, a roller coaster on which the highs were as high as anyone could ever hope to go. And the lows! Oh, those lows were lower than anyone should ever have to go -- 10 degrees below hell.\"\n\nShe published two volumes of memoirs, \"Lauren Bacall by Myself\" in 1979 and \"By Myself and Then Some\" in 1996.\n\nIn 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded her an honorary Oscar \"in recognition of her central place in the Golden Age of motion pictures.\"\n\nWith the Associated Press and Newsday staff."
