        "text": "Humphrey Bogart: Classic Leading Man\n\nThe Early Years\n\nHumphrey Deforest Bogart was born on December 25, 1899, in New York City to Belmont and Maud Bogart. Humphrey had two younger sisters: Frances (Pat) and Catherine Elizabeth (Kay).\n\nThe Bogarts lived in an Upper West Side apartment and owned a 56-acre estate in Canandaigua Lake in upstate New York. Whenever Humphrey was at the lake, he and his friends would put on plays.\n\nAlthough well-read and intelligent, Humphrey was bored by school. He enlisted in the Navy during World War I and served as a coxswain. He was considered a model sailor, and after his enlistment ended, he worked as a shipper and a salesman, and joined the Coast Guard Reserve.\n\nEarly Acting Career\n\nDespite his family’s belief that acting was a lowly profession, Bogart recognized that he had a talent for it. So, from 1922-1935, he acted in 17 Broadway productions. During this time, he married his first wife, Helen Mencken, in 1922. Then, he divorced her in 1927 and married his second wife, Mary Philips in 1928.\n\nIn 1929, Humphrey Bogart appeared for the first time in a film called The Dancing Town. In 1930, he was cast in Up the River, where he met Spencer Tracy, who nicknamed him “Bogie” (and the name stuck).\n\nBogart Goes to Hollywood…and Stays\n\nIn 1935, Bogart’s supporting role in the Broadway production of The Petrified Forest caught Hollywood’s attention. Warner Brothers wanted to make the film, but they wanted Edward G. Robinson to star in it.\n\nSince Leslie Howard was set to star in the film—and he owned the production rights—he told the studio: “no Bogart, no deal.” When it was clear that Howard would not budge, the studio relented, and agreed to cast Humphrey Bogart.\n\nThe film opened to great critical reviews and was a box office smash. Now, at last, Humphrey Bogart was a Hollywood star.\n\nLife In The “B” Movies\n\nFor the first 34 movies that Bogart made with Warner Brothers, he was typecast as a gangster. He joked that he was either “electrocuted, shot, or hanged” in the movies he made from 1934-1940.\n\nWith stardom, Bogart had hoped to find top billing and a chance to grow as an actor. His second wife, Mary, refused to join him in Hollywood, preferring to stay in New York for her own career. Finally, they divorced in 1937.\n\nIn 1938, he married his third wife, Mayo Methot. Although an actress in her own right, she was known more for her heavy drinking, violent outbursts, and turbulent marriage to Bogart.\n\nThe Making of An American Icon\n\nThe 1940s ushered in some of Humphrey Bogart’s most celebrated work. In 1941, he starred in High Sierra in a better role than he ever had before. John Huston was the screenwriter, and they became great friends and drinking buddies.\n\n1941 was also the year that Bogie starred in The Maltese Falcon. This film noir classic marked John Huston’s directorial debut and was a big commercial hit.\n\nIn 1942, Bogie starred in Casablanca. This role brought him his very first Academy Award nomination for best actor; the film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Thanks to the Maltese Falcon, Bogart became the highest paid Hollywood actor of his time.\n\n1944 saw Bogart starring in To Have and Have Not, co-starring Lauren Bacall. If Mayo Methot was jealous before, no one could blame her for being jealous now. There was no denying the chemistry between Bacall, a 19-year-old starlet, and 44-year-old Bogart.\n\nWhile critics weren’t thrilled, audiences were—and made To Have and Have Not one of the top 30 grossing films of the year. Audiences were delighted to see them paired up again in The Big Sleep in 1946, Dark Passage in 1947, and finally, in Key Largo in 1948.\n\nFollowing Bogart’s divorce, Bacall and Bogart married in 1945. They had a son, Steven, and a daughter, Leslie. They remained happily married for the next 12 years.\n\nLater Years\n\nThe end of the 1940s were good years for Bogie. He got a better contract from Warner Brothers and was allowed to start his own production company, Santana Productions.\n\nIn 1948, he starred in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (William Huston) and for Best Director (John Huston). Some say it featured one of Bogart’s greatest performances.\n\nMore Greatness Ahead\n\nIn 1951, Bogie starred in The African Queen. Shot on location in the Belgian Congo, and despite the heat and harsh conditions, Bogart’s performance as captain Charlie Allnutt finally won him the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn 1954, he played Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny. His riveting performance earned him his final Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. In the same year, he delighted audiences by starring in Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn and in The Barefoot Contessa with Ava Gardner.\n\nLife and Legacy\n\nBogart continued to work in movies, television, and on radio until 1956, when he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. Despite surgeries and chemotherapy, Bogart’s health quickly deteriorated. Humphrey Bogart died on January 14, 1957, just twenty days after his 57th birthday."
