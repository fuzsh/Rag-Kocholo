        "text": "Humphrey DeForest Bogart (December 25, 1899 – January 14, 1957) was an American screen and stage actor whose performances in 1940's films such as \"The Maltese Falcon\", \"Casablanca\", and \"The Big Sleep\" earned him status as a cultural icon.\n\nOnce, after signing a long-term deal with Warner Bros., Bogart had predicted with glee that his teeth and hair would fall out before the contract ended. By 1955, though he was well established as an independent producer, the sometime actor's health was failing. In the wake of Santana Productions he had formed a new company and had anxious plans for a film, Melville Goodwin, in which he would play a general and Bacall a press magnate. However, his persistent cough and difficulty eating became too serious to ignore and he dropped the project.\n\nBogart, a heavy smoker and drinker, had developed cancer of the esophagus. He almost never spoke of his failing health and refused to see a doctor until January 1956 after much persistence from his wife, Lauren Bacall. A diagnosis of cancer was made several weeks later. He underwent a surgical operation on March 1, 1956, where his entire esophagus, two lymph nodes, and a rib were removed but, by then, it was too late to halt the disease, even with chemotherapy. Bogart fell into a coma and died in his bed the next day. He had just turned 57 twenty days prior and weighed only 80 pounds (36 kg)."
