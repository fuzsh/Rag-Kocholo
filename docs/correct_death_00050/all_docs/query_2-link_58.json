        "text": "Listen to this episode on Apple Podcasts.\n\nIn the late 1940s, as the country was moving to the right and there was pressure on Hollywood to do the same, Katharine Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and John Huston all protested HUAC in ways that damaged their public personas and their ability to work in Hollywood. Hepburn’s outspokenness resulted in headlines branding her a \"Red\" and, allegedly, audiences stoning her films. Bogart and Huston were prominent members of the Committee For the First Amendment, a group of Hollywood stars who came to Washington to support the Hollywood Ten -- and lived to regret it. With their career futures uncertain, the trio collaborated on the most difficult film any of them would ever make, The African Queen.\n\nShow notes:\n\nHere is a list of published sources that the entire season draws from:\n\nThe Red and the Blacklist: An Intimate Memoir of a Hollywood Expatriate by Norma Barzman\n\nDalton Trumbo: Blacklisted Hollywood Radical by Larry Ceplair and Christopher Trumbo\n\nTrumbo: A biography of the Oscar-winning screenwriter who broke the Hollywood blacklist by Bruce Cook\n\nWhen Hollywood Was Right: How Movie Stars, Studio Moguls, and Big Business Remade American Politics by Donald T.

We'll get into that next week. This week, we're flashing back to our episode on Bogart from 2014, describing how the Casablanca star struggled to find his niche in Hollywood during the first part of his film career, the tough guy roles that changed things around, and finally his transformative romance with Lauren Bacall.\n\nThis episode originally debuted in September 2014. The original show notes for the episode contains sources, soundtrack information and more.\n\nWe’ve also previously discussed the careers of Katharine Hepburn and John Huston. In our 11th episode, from way back in July 2014, we talked about Katharine Hepburn’s rise and fall and rise again in the 1930s, and her relationship with Howard Hughes. Listen to that episode if you want to get a sense of how Hepburn was perceived as a star going into the Blacklist era, and for details as to what was going on in her personal life during the events that we’re going o talk about next week, check out episode number 64, which deals with Hepburn’s relationship with Spencer Tracy and their work together on such films as Woman of the Year. Finally, John Huston pops up here and there throughout our archive, but most prominently in episode number 35, which dealt with Huston’s service in World War II, and his relationship with actress Olivia de Havilland.\n\nListen to this episode on Apple Podcasts.\n\nLike Marilyn Monroe and James Dean, it sometimes seems as though Audrey Hepburn’s actual movies have been swallowed up by a superficial image of her as a star. When you think of her, you probably think of her in a black cocktail dress, swinging a cigarette holder — an image from the film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a film about a golddigging party girl which somehow convinces the viewer that it’s about a girl-next-door princess. This ability to mix sex and class and innocence was Hepburn’s real trademark, and along with her ballerina/waif body type - the total opposite of the bombshell look that was in vogue at the time — it made Hepburn not just a great star, but a groundbreaking one: she was the first glamorous actress whose style seemed to be to dress for herself, and not to appeal to men.\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s came along fairly far along in Hepburn’s evolution as a star. Today we’re going to talk about a film which sparked that evolution, Sabrina — Hepburn’s second Hollywood film, on which she was romanced by William Holden, resented by Humphrey Bogart, and first dressed by Givenchy. It was also the first film on which her complicated star persona as a “new woman,” who used fashion to both broadcast her individuality and negotiate around the censors, started to come together.\n\nShow Notes!\n\nMy book Hollywood Frame by Frame contains several pages of images taken on the New York set of Sabrina. There’s one page that shows Hepburn, Holden, director Billy Wilder, and screenwriter Ernest Lehman, sitting around a table together — without Bogart. When I started researching that photo, I learned that Bogart had been an antagonist on that set, in part because he seemed to feel threatened by the up-and-coming Hepburn, who he thought was getting special treatment, and who would thus upstage him. That reminded me of the portion of Sam Wasson’s book Fifth Avenue 5 A.M., in which he details the special treatment that Hepburn did get, in that she was sent to Paris to pick out items for her character’s (and her own) wardrobe at the atelier of Hubert de Givenchy, the designer with whom Hepburn would work for the rest of her career. I thought it would be interesting to explore ways in which Sabrina, made when Hepburn was still a total newcomer, put in motion various aspects of her now-indelible star persona.\n\nThis episode features more film criticism/analysis than usual, and because I had researched these films and Hepburn’s life before, I didn’t need to do the usual exhaustive research. But most of the quotes and information about Hepburn’s early and personal lives came from Barry Paris’ biography Audrey Hepburn.\n\nDiscography:\n\n\"Moon River\" by Henry Mancini, performed by Morrissey\n\n“Benbient” by Canton\n\n“Free and Easy” by Brian Jonestown Massacre\n\n“Oceanic Dawn” by DJ Masque\n\n“Just in Time” performed by Blossom Dearie\n\n“Big Deal” by Everything But the Girl\n\n“6,49” by Black Ant\n\n“Wonder Cylce” by Chris Zabriskie\n\n“Sous le soleil exacttement (orchestre)” by Serge Gainsbourg\n\n“Transparent” by Peter Rudenko\n\n“Divider” by Chris Zabriskie\n\n“Gunshy” by Liz Phair\n\n“Inside You” by Eddie Henderson\n\n“The Slide Song” by Spiritualized\n\n“The Girls Want to Be With The Girls” by The Talking Heads\n\nShow notes!\n\nI researched this episode concurrently with last week’s episode, so there’s not much more to report on the sources front, other than this Guardian article. Bacall herself left behind a goldmine in her memoirs, By Myself (which was updated about ten years ago with a new chapter, and re-released as By Myself and Then Some), and Now. Ordinarily I wouldn’t want to use a subjects own autobiographies as my primary sources, but Bacall’s voice is so strong, and her point of view mostly so clear (except for her occasionally blinkered view of her first marriage, but she basically cops to being to blinded by love that she couldn’t report on that objectively, so whatever) that it seemed like the best idea. Also, she just died, and it seemed like the best tribute to her would be to showcase her side of the story.\n\nDiscography\n\n\"Preludes for Piano No. 2\" by George Gershwin\n\n\"An American in Paris\" by George Gershwin\n\n“After Parties” by DNTEL\n\n\"Welcome to Heartbreak\" by Kanye West\n\n\"Dances and Dames\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\n”Prelude No. 21” by Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Erik’s Song\" by Slowdive\n\n\"The Future\" performed by Frank Sinatra\n\n\"looped\" by Jahzzar\n\n\"The Best is Yet to Come\" performed by Frank Sinatra\n\n\"For Better or Worse\" by Kai Engel\n\n\"Dance of the Stargazer\" by US Army Blues\n\n\"Single\" by Everything but the Girl\n\n\"Quasi Motion\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\n\"Autumn in New York\" performed by Chet Baker\n\n\"Divider\" by Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Benbient\" by canton\n\n\"Welcome to the Theater\" from Applause, performed by Lauren Bacall\n\n\"Tikopia\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\n\"Mesmerizing\" by Liz Phair\n\n\"Cylinder One\" by Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Empty Bottles\" by Magik Markers\n\nListen to this episode on Apple Podcasts.\n\nHumphrey Bogart is perhaps the most enduring icon of grown-up masculine cool to come out of Hollywood’s first century. But much of what we think of when we think of Bogart — the persona of the tough guy with the secret soft heart, his pairing on-screen and off with Lauren Bacall — coalesced late in Bogart’s life. Today we take a look at how Humphrey Bogart became Bogey, tracing his journey from blue blood beginnings through years of undistinguished work and outright failure (both in the movies and in love), to his emergence in the early 1940s as a symbol of wartime perseverance who could make sacrifice seem sexy. Finally, we’ll look at what it took to get him to take the leap into a fourth marriage that seemed to saved his life … until the world’s most glamorous stoic was faced with cancer. Next week, we’ll present the sequel to this story: Bacall, After Bogey.\n\nShow Notes!\n\nThis episode was researched in part at the Warner Brothers Archives at USC. Thanks to Brett Service for inviting me to make use of the Archives and for helping me find what I needed.\n\nAs I noted last week, each episode in this season has some connection to Hollywood Frame by Frame, the book I worked on which compiles previously unseen contact sheets of Hollywood still photographers. The admittedly rather flimsy connection to this week and next week’s episodes is that there are images in the book of Bogart and Bacall on the set of The African Queen. Pre-order the book now! </blatant plug>\n\nThere are a lot of biographies of Humphrey Bogart. I’ve flipped through many of them over the years, and I’m not sure there’s a single definitive or really great one. But, the most recent, Stefan Kanfer’s Tough Without a Gun, at least does the work of sorting through most of the previously published sources and comparing versions of the truth. Bogey by Clifford McCarty was one of the few film books my parents had around when I was a kid, and it was disappointing to open it during research for this episode and find that it had more pictures than text, although that also makes it pretty emblematic of the wave of Bogey image worship that sprung up in the late-60s and 1970s, which we’ll talk about in next week’s episode.\n\nI became interested in the idea of exploring Bogey’s life before Bacall through City of Nets, Otto Friedrich’s beautifully written book on Hollywood in the 1940s. which dramatizes Bogart’s relationship with his third wife, Mayo Methot. Other sources relevant to this episode include By Myself by Lauren Bacall, Who the Hell’s In Itand Who the Devil Made It by Peter Bogdanovich, Humphrey Bogart by Nathaniel Benchley, Bogart and Bacall by Joe Hyams, Slim: Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life by Slim Keith with Annette Tapert. and finally, the chapter on Bogart in Louise Brooks’ Lulu in Hollywood. After his death, more than one Bogart biographer disputed Brooks’ impressions/interpretations of her old friend Humphrey Bogart, who she insisted was not the same man as the Bogey the world thought they knew. Of course, Brooks’ recollections are self-serving, but I always think first-hand accounts are interesting, especially when they challenge or add shading to a legend. And that’s the thing about Bogartography: for all that’s been written about the man, his life and his work, there still seems to be so little that we actually know.\n\nDiscography\n\n\"Intro\" by The Big Sleep\n\n\"Fourty Four\" by The Kills\n\n\"Dances and Dames\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\n\"Out of the Skies, Under the Earth\" by Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Divider\" by Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Melody\" by Serge Gainsbourg\n\n\"Love Like a Sunset\" by Phoenix\n\n\"roughcut\" by Tripwire\n\n\"Life Round Here\" by James Blake\n\n\"Your Impersonation This Morning of Me Last Night\" by Joan of Arc\n\n\"Rite of Passage\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\n\"For Better or Worse\"Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Intelligent Galaxy\" by The Insider\n\n\"Looped\" by Jahzzar\n\n\"Shadow of a Doubt\" by Sonic Youth\n\n\"Cyllinder One\" by Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Theresa’s Sound World\" by Sonic Youth\n\n\"Will Be War Soon?\" by Kosta T\n\n\"Prelude No. 21\" by Chris Zabriskie\n\n\"Tikopia\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\n\"Benbient\" by canton\n\n”Don’t Fence Me In,” by Cole Porter, performed by Frank Sinatrac"
