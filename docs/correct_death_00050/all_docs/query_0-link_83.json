        "text": "The girl was so pretty that Earl Robinson, who had been asked to look out for her on the four-day train trip from New York to Los Angeles, felt compelled to write his wife en route \"to reassure her that there was nothing in this.\" Robinson, a popular composer, had been called out to Hollywood by the agent and producer Charles K. Feldman to work on a proposed film. Feldman told him he would have company-just a kid, really, whom he was thinking of signing up. She had never been on her own before, and would Earl keep an eye on her?\n\nShe came down the long platform at Grand Central Station to board the Twentieth Century Limited in early April 1943, a leggy, long-haired, simply dressed teenager wearing a gardenia corsage, her mother by her side. No one would have recognized her as the high-fashion blonde with the smoky-eyed stare on the March cover of Harper's Bazaar. Robinson saw no \"starring qualities\" in the girl, whom he nevertheless thought attractive, but then, he was there with his wife and \"wasn't looking for them.\" Rather, she seemed more a schoolgirl with a crush on movies, and since Robinson had \"a New York attitude toward Hollywood,\" his opinion of starlets was low. \"I thought Hollywood was unreal, and I lumped her in with that. Which was stupid on my part.\" Even so, he found the 18-year-old Betty Bacal, soon to be known as Lauren Bacall, \"honestly friendly,\" and was comforting to her mother, Natalie, when she \"sort of latched onto me, thinking that I could be a guardian, I guess. I was 33 then.\"\n\nA childhood friend, Gloria Nevard, called Betty \"a determined young lady with a will of iron.\" The two had been roommates and best friends at the Highland Manor school for girls in Tarrytown, New York. Both were children of divorce, raised by working mothers who instilled character in their daughters. For many of Betty's years at the school, the records listed her as Betty Joan Perske, but she later shucked the surname of her long-vanished, deadbeat father and took on her mother's—Bacal.\n\nEven at Highland Manor, Betty was strikingly pretty, with long blond hair, and she acted in school productions. Despite the breakup of her parents' marriage, she was the focus of a large Jewish family, with a circle of adoring aunts and uncles and a grandmother who had emigrated from Romania with her small children. One of Betty's uncles had lent her mother the money for the expensive boarding school. The family believed in the verities of hard work and night school, and held the conviction that in the new land nothing was beyond reach if you worked for it. After returning home to New York City for high school, Betty embarked on the beginner's hard road in the theater, working variously as a garment-district model, an usher, and a vendor of show-business guides in front of Sardi's restaurant, the social center of the theater community. She learned that it didn't help to be a shrinking violet and it didn't hurt to be young and pretty to make oneself visible.\n\nShe also learned that it didn't help to be Jewish. She was 16 when she landed her first job as a model. One day another of the girls asked, \"What are you?\" Not knowing the girl meant ancestry rather than religion, she answered, \"I'm Jewish.\"\n\n\"Oh—but you don't look it at all.\"\n\nSoon afterward, Betty was fired, ostensibly because she was too thin for the designer's clothes.\n\nWhen Gloria Nevard, now away at college, visited Betty in the city, she already seemed a part of the Broadway scene. At the theater where she ushered, Betty took Gloria backstage to meet the actors, among them Vincent Price and Kirk Douglas. Bacal, who had never really known her father, seemed especially attracted to leading actors who were older.\n\nThrough her network of older and more influential friends, she was introduced to legendary Harper's Bazaar (and later Vogue) editor Diana Vreeland. Enchanted by Bacal's looks, Vreeland put her into the pages of the January and February 1943 issues of Harper's Bazaar and then onto the March cover.\n\nNancy Gross \"Slim\" Hawks, the wife of Howard Hawks, Feldman's partner (as a producer) and client (as a director), had seen the shot of Betty and two actresses modeling blouses while she was leafing through the magazine in Los Angeles, and had promptly urged her husband to sign the striking young woman. Others had noticed her, too—David O. Selznick and Howard Hughes both made inquiries about her, and Columbia wanted to put her under contract. However, Bacal accepted Feldman and Hawks's proposal of an expenses-paid trip to California.\n\n\"Bacall emulated Slim Hawks—striding around with these great clothes and able to say four-letter words trippingly.\"\n\nHollywood was invented for people like Charlie Feldman. He was a lawyer who became an agent and an agent who became a producer. In the course of his career, his more than 300 clients included John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Greta Garbo, and Marilyn Monroe. He married the golden-haired actress and former showgirl Jean Howard, who had been courted by the tyrannical MGM head Louis B. Mayer. Mayer barred Feldman from his studio and tried to have him barred from others.\n\nFeldman's partner, Howard Winchester Hawks, directed, over the course of his career, more than a dozen classic movies that play as beautifully today as when they were made decades ago, including Twentieth Century (1934), Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940), The Big Sleep (1946), and Red River (1948). The critic and film historian David Thomson wrote, \"Like Monet forever painting lilies . . . Hawks made only one artwork. [Its theme is] that men are more expressive rolling a cigarette than saving the world.\" Hawks was also \"a secretive rogue, stealthy dandy, and a ruinous womanizer.\" His bigotry, and his underlying misogyny, would destroy his three marriages—to Athole Shearer, sister of Norma; to Nancy Gross; and to Dee Hartford. One day in the 1950s, William Faulkner turned his great sad eyes on Hartford (later Cramer) and commented in his soft drawl, \"Miz Dee, I wouldn't want to be a hoss, a dawg, or a woman around Mr. Hawks.\"\n\nBoth Hawks and Feldman lived lavish, outsize lives, often at the expense of others, but in Hollywood that hardly made them unique.\n\nBacal and Robinson were met at Union Station in Los Angeles by a Feldman underling, who drove them first to the office of Hawks-Feldman Productions on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills and then on to the Claremont Hotel in Westwood Village.\n\nLunch the next day was with Feldman and Hawks at the Brown Derby. Hawks, in later interviews, would say that in a sweater and gabardine skirt the sexy young woman of Harper's Bazaar looked to him like \"just a kid.\" He would claim, \"I said, 'Fix her up with a tour of the studio so she can say she's been here . . . then send her back home.'\" As with many Hawks recollections, that account is more colorful than accurate. The Feldman-office records clearly detail the money laid out and the promises made before bringing \"the kid\" to California, including a screen test within a stipulated time. But Betty Bacal was not the highest priority for Hawks and Feldman at the time. That distinction went to Ella Raines, whom they had brought to Los Angeles two months earlier. Unlike Bacal, who was imported quietly and housed modestly, Raines was accorded all the perks of a prospective film sensation. The instructions from the office were that she was to have deluxe accommodations at the Beverly Wilshire hotel. In addition, a public-relations man was always to accompany her and make sure that she had the best of care.\n\nDavid O. Selznick and Howard Hughes made inquiries about her and Columbia wanted to put her under contract.\n\nNot that Bacal was neglected. On the Sunday after her arrival, Feldman and Jean Howard invited her to their Beverly Hills home for lunch. Feldman invariably asked his wife for her impressions of new talent—John Wayne, she once told him, seemed \"just a great big good-looking cowboy,\" which was to the point. Of Bacal, Howard said, \"She just sounds like a tough kid to me. I think she's very pretty.\"\n\nAbout three weeks after she arrived in Los Angeles, Bacal was scheduled to make her screen test. Late Sunday afternoon, she went to the Feldmans' and spent the night. Jean Howard, seeing that \"she was nervous and frightened, did what I could, without holding her hand. She knew that she was with friends. My nephew drove her over to Warner's to do her test.\" In sharp contrast to the usual rushed assembly-line test, whose lack of production values had ended many an aspirant's dream of a Hollywood career, Bacal's test was in the care of a great director, who paid attention to every aspect of makeup, lighting, and photography. A still that survives from that morning's test shows a dreamy-eyed girl with wavy hair falling to her shoulders, the light picking up the bone structure of the perfect, strong young face.\n\nOn May 3, 1943, Betty Bacal signed a four-page, single-spaced document putting her under personal contract to Howard Hawks, starting at $100 a week, with options up to seven years and a maximum of $1,500 per week.\n\nNext came the months of transformation. To begin, there was the speaking voice. Subsequent allegations notwithstanding, Betty Bacal had no serious vocal problems, though her speech did have the unmistakable inflections of her hometown. Hawks later insisted that \"she had a little thin, reedy voice,\" casting himself once again in the role of miracle worker. But her achieving the timbre Hawks desired was more the result of her own effort than of his alchemy. Each day Bacal drove up either Benedict Canyon Drive or Coldwater Canyon Drive, which connect Beverly Hills with Mulholland Drive, the ribbon of road that overlooks the city on one side and the San Fernando Valley on the other. She would stop at a deserted spot and read aloud from Lloyd C. Douglas's 1942 biblical novel, The Robe, deliberately making her voice lower, more masculine, sexier, an exercise suggested by Hawks.\n\nOne day, Hawks later said, his secretary left a message: \"That girl\" had asked to see him. \"And when she came over, she . . . just talked way down, you know. She changed her voice. And . . . what the hell, you have to notice a girl like that.\"\n\nNext came the question of style. She was sent to Hawks's manorial home on Moraga Drive in the hills of Bel Air; she later wrote that the huge single-story ranch house filled with antiques was \"the most beautiful house I had ever seen.\" Dee Cramer, who was married to Hawks from 1953 to 1959, agreed. \"The style was not to be believed.\" The estate included barns, a gardener's cottage, and a racing stable filled with Thoroughbreds. The young actress found a friendly mentor in Hawks's wife of two years, the fashionable, trendsetting Slim, one of America's best-dressed women. The second Mrs. Hawks, about 20 years younger than her husband and only 7 or 8 years older than Bacal, soon became her role model. To Dee Hawks Cramer, who knew and admired her predecessor, \"Slim was Lauren Bacall—I mean, just mannish, striding around with these great clothes and able to say four-letter words trippingly. And the wit. . . . Betty really emulated Slim—she became Slim.\"\n\n\"They'd disappear into one of their dressing rooms, and we thought, What the heck. They'd come out looking very happy.\"\n\nIn September, Hawks bought the literary rights to Ernest Hemingway's To Have and Have Not from Howard Hughes, who had unsuccessfully tried to make a movie of it at RKO. The novel, published in 1937, was one of Hemingway's less popular books, and originally no one in Hollywood was especially excited about the property. But when Hawks chose to direct it and signed on Humphrey Bogart as leading man, the project was regarded as money in the bank. Hawks asked that Bacal's April screen test be run for Jack Warner, vice president and head of production for Warner Bros., who liked the clip tremendously.\n\nHawks and Feldman launched a quiet campaign to increase Bacal's visibility by introducing her at celebrity-studded evenings in their homes or those of other influential people. For all their kindnesses, her closest allies also posed dangers. Feldman, his glamorous wife notwithstanding, was known to have many affairs. At least some people thought he wanted to include Bacal among them. Earl Robinson was certain. \"Charlie was sweet on Betty. He was trying to make her and she resisted him.\" Jean Howard was equally convinced he wasn't. \"He did not make a try, I can tell you that for sure. Betty, really, was not his type. She was a little tough, maybe. A little too . . . Jewish. I don't like to say that, he didn't have a prejudice against them, but I know that he never had affairs with them.\" (A curious statement considering Feldman himself was a Jew.)\n\nHawks's prejudice, on the other hand, was completely open. AntiSemitic barbs studded his conversation, and they shocked his protegée. She noticed that Feldman was the only Jew who ever seemed to get invited to Hawks's home and wondered if Hawks knew about her own background. But mindful of how she had perhaps lost her first modeling job, she was both intimidated into silence and full of self-reproach for not standing up to her benefactor.\n\nWhatever Hawks's prejudices, there were hints, subtly or not so subtly conveyed by third parties, that Mr. Hawks wanted to be more than simply a business associate. Joyce Gates, an actress friend of Bacal's from New York, who had also come out to Hollywood for a screen test, remembers Betty telling her about the pressure she was under: \"She was careful. And very scared.\"\n\nWhen asked how she liked her martinis, Bacall replied, \"Just pass the vermouth over the glass.\"\n\nYet she managed, unlike so many others, to avoid the complications of the casting couch. She didn't need it. Jules Buck, the photographer and later producer who married Joyce Gates, said, \"Betty was a force. She was pushing herself, seemingly without pushing herself.\"\n\nIn October, Hawks took Bacal onto the set of Humphrey Bogart's new movie, Passage to Marseille, and introduced her to the then 43-year-old star. Originally a theater actor from New York, Bogart had labored for years as the villainous tough guy in more than a score of Warner Bros, films. With High Sierra (1941), however, he achieved a breakthrough by making the character of Roy \"Mad Dog\" Earle a sympathetic gangster. In The Maltese Falcon (1941), his portrayal of Sam Spade defined the cinematic version of the classic American private eye. And as Rick Blaine in Casablanca (1942), he proved himself as a romantic lead. Whether in a white dinner jacket or a trench coat and snap-brim fedora, Bogart was, by the early 1940s, one of the top movie stars in the world and also a timely symbol of post-Pearl Harbor America: tough but compassionate, skeptical yet idealistic, betrayed yet ready to believe again, and, above all, a potent and deadly opponent.\n\nOffscreen, however, Bogart was a man in a deeply troubled marriage of five years to actress Mayo Methot. Their much-publicized fighting had led amused reporters to call them the Battling Bogarts, but there was nothing funny about their home life. Mayo, alcoholic and mentally unstable, had stabbed him in a rage one night in 1942 while he was making Across the Pacific, an incident that was kept secret from the press and from the police. But Bogart, whom his friend John Huston, the director, described as \"morbidly faithful,\" persisted in the marriage.\n\nOn the set of Passage to Marseille a few polite words were exchanged between Bogart and Bacal. A slight figure in his convict's uniform of loose trousers and cotton shirt, Bogart seemed friendly enough, but \"there was no clap of thunder,\" she later wrote. He would remember seeing a pretty walking prop that could either help or ruin a film, and he wondered if she could act.\n\nA couple of weeks before shooting on To Have and Have Not began, five months later, Bogart met his co-star at the door of Howard Hawks's bungalow on the lot. This time she registered: a lovely young woman with blue-green eyes, as tall as he was, maybe taller. He told her he had seen her test, and she would always remember his verdict: \"We'll have a lot of fun together.\"\n\n\"She courted him as much as he courted her.\"\n\nThe fun began at nine A.M. on February 29, 1944, a leap-year Tuesday, when the company of To Have and Have Not gathered at Warner's. The first day started with the lead-in to Bacal's entrance: a hotel M hallway, an open door, and the first of her two opening lines, \"Anybody got a match?\" She later wrote that during rehearsal she shook with fear—her head, her body, the hand holding the cigarette. \"Hope we don't hear her knees knocking!\" the sound mixer whispered to Bogart. The cameras rolled. The first try was a false start. So was the second. Bogart tried to joke her out of her nervousness.\n\nThen she \"realized that one way to hold my trembling head still was to keep it down, chin low, almost to my chest, and eyes up at Bogart, [which] turned out to be the beginning of 'The Look' ''—the tag that studio publicists would invent for Bacall. The third take was a print. The dailies showed none of the nervousness. Instead, there was the enduring image of the beautiful young woman in the doorway—coolly appraising, supremely self-assured.\n\nRegardless of her youth and anxiousness, Bacal's strong showing in the dailies marked her immediately as a talent of stature, a strong personality and performer who could hold the screen. \"Betty was special,\" Dan Seymour, an actor in the movie, agreed. \"She had a sense of timing. And, of course, Howard Hawks knew exactly what to do with her.\" Marcel Dalio, the croupier of Casablanca now playing a Martinique hotel owner, followed her every move and intoned with Gallic appreciation to those nearby, \"O-o-o-oh, watch out for her.\"\n\nShe had a combination of naivété and knowing, of sugar and steel, and Bogart, intrigued, tested her sense of humor and capacity for being teased. On one occasion Bogart and Seymour handcuffed Bacal to one of the portable dressing rooms and then made a great show of trooping off to lunch. \"Of course we came back and took them off again, but she played along. She was a good sport, and she was smart,\" Seymour recalled. But the actor sensed something else behind the foolery. \"I think Bogie wanted to make her feel at home. Here you're a leading woman to Humphrey Bogart—but you're 19 years old, you've got the lines to think about, and you know you have to get a characterization; it's a rough deal. So I think he took the pressure off her, making her one of the bunch.\"\n\nThe change in their relationship was so gradual as to be unnoticed by the crew at first and possibly by the stars themselves; Bacall later called it \"almost imperceptible.\" Meta Carpenter Wilde, the script supervisor, who was working on her fourth Hawks film, saw no indication of a growing attraction during the first weeks of shooting. \"It was all so new to Betty. She had to concentrate. So I think it was sometime after they had been acting together that the chemistry started.\"\n\nIn Bacall's account, she was sitting in her dressing room, joking with Bogart, when he leaned over, put his hand under her chin, and kissed her. He then pulled a matchbook from his pocket and asked her to write her phone number on the back.\n\nFour weeks into production, they shot the \"You know how to whistle, don't you?\" scene. \"The way they did that scene, we knew things were happening,\" Dan Seymour said. \"He had that sort of smile you can still see on the screen.\"\n\nTo Walter Surovy, who under the name Walter Molnar played Paul De Bursac in the movie, \"it was like an explosion. They looked at one another like, Well, did you ever go into a party and across the room there was somebody who was fascinating to you and it was fatal? It happens. So I believed from the beginning that this was going to work.\"\n\nBogart was not the only one on the set to fall for her. \"She was different-looking, with an animal quality and great eyes,\" according to Fred de Cordova, who went on to a career as a prominent television producer but in 1944 was a young dialogue director just in from New York. He had called her at the home number wheedled out of a friend in the contracts department and asked her to dinner. It was not a good night, she told him. Ten days later he called again. Once more it was not a good night. He called a third time, \"not giving up easily in those days. And a male voice answered the phone. I said, 'Hello, this is Fred de Cordova,' and Bogie said, 'Isn't there any way you're going to get the hint that Betty and I are together, and to stop bothering us with these silly phone calls?' \"\n\nOn the set, the two became inseparable, walking hand in hand for all to see. \"They really were smitten with each other,\" Joy Barlowe, a Warner's dancer taken on for the cafe scenes, said. \"You could tell by the looks. He always had his hand on her shoulder. And he called her Baby. . . . They were always disappearing. That was when directors told the company, 'O.K., take a break, be back in 15.' And the rest of us, we'd be right back there. . . . But they would disappear into one or another of their dressing rooms, and sometimes 15 minutes ran a little longer. But we just thought, Oh, what the heck. And they'd come out looking very happy, a little mussed up, but nothing that you couldn't fix. I mean, they weren't obscene about anything.\"\n\nTo Barlowe, \"Bogie was more serious. Betty was pretty giggly—and silly. But cute. And funny. And Bogie got a little more giggly because of her.\" On the set, Meta Carpenter Wilde added, Bogart would swing along singing the nonsense hit \"Mairzy Doats\" in a raspy cigarette baritone, certainly not minding anybody's seeing that he was in love with Betty and that she was in love with him.\n\nMrs. Hawks, a tall, elegant presence, beautifully dressed, would come almost every day, always in the company of her dark-gray poodle. Its fur had black highlights, and its nails were done in a bright red. Dan Seymour thought it \"very handsome-looking. And the biggest ham there was. She would put it on the [cafe] bar and it would walk up and down, sort of showing off. The nails were so long, you'd hear them tapping. She would talk with her husband first, then she'd go over to Betty and they'd go somewhere and talk. They were very thick, though Betty was her own gal.\"\n\nThe budding affair with Bogart and its intimation of divided loyalties threatened to alter Betty's estimation of Howard Hawks. On the set, he was a patient mentor, creative and understanding in his use of fresh talent. But he was also proprietary, a latter-day Pygmalion who was not about to permit any interference with what he considered his creation.\n\nFor the first several months, Betty Bacal knew only his beneficence. Then one night in late April, about two weeks before the end of production, she was commanded to come to the Hawks home. In her memoirs, the mature Bacall relived the terror of that confrontation: her mentor telling her in his quiet voice that she meant nothing at all to Bogart; that she was throwing away her big chance; that he, Hawks, was washing his hands of her; and that he would send her to Monogram, a B studio on Hollywood's so-called Poverty Row that ground out product with titles like Sarong Girl and Women in Bondage. She tearfully assured him that she would do better, then drove home and cried all night.\n\nThe next day, Bogart picked up the pieces and quieted her fears. Howard was simply jealous, that was all. Bogart also assured her of his own feelings for her. She calmed down, but Bogart did not. What followed, according to studio records, was an angry confrontation between the two men that threw the production into jeopardy amid clear indications that Bogart was threatening to walk. Jack Warner, called in as the peacemaker, asked Bogart to his office for a \"personal talk to smooth over everything.\"\n\nFilming continued. The following Monday, the first of May, Bacal, in a clinging black satin sheath held together at the bare midriff by a single plastic ring, stood beside Hoagy Carmichael at the piano and sang \"How Little We Know,\" the song that he and Johnny Mercer had written for her.\n\nMaybe I'm only supposed to stay in your arms awhile, As others have done. Is this what I've waited for? Am I the one?\n\nSome later accounts alleged that the actual singing was done by a very young Andy Williams, dubbed in for Bacall. But studio memos and production reports make it clear that she did her own singing.\n\nAs she sang, across the lot in the executive building, the last touches were being put to the agreement converting Howard Hawks's discovery into the newest Warner's star. In a final step, her backers granted legal permission to change her name: \"In this connection her professional name is now Lauren Bacall.\"\n\nThat same April, Bogart's wife, Mayo Methot, turned 40. Methot had been a pretty blonde ingenue on Broadway and in films, but by this time the last vestiges of her beauty were gone. She had let herself go, the cardinal sin in the movie colony, and was a squat, unkempt figure with lackluster hair pinned carelessly back with a cheap barrette. Stately, thin Lauren Bacall was the disaster for her that had been waiting to happen.\n\nThe studio publicity department kept churning out stories about the happy, scrappy Bogarts in an attempt to shore up the image of the faithful husband in the face of rising, though still discreet, gossip. When it became clear that something had to be said about Bacall, Warner Publicity head Alex Evelove and his staff dished up the relationship as an on-the-set flirtation.\n\nBacall has written of furtive meetings on street corners, at the trailer home of boating friends of Bogart's, even at her apartment while her disapproving mother, Natalie (who had moved in to be close to her daughter), kept her distance. The company always knew when Methot was on the lot. It took only one ring from the gate saying she was coming through to make the two leads quickly unclasp their hands and move just a bit apart. Mayo, fighting back, tried to use the telephone as a weapon. Bogart told Joe Hyams, his friend and biographer, about being called to the phone on the set to hear Mayo, her voice dripping acid: \"Hello, lover boy. How're you doing with your daughter? She's half your age, you know.\"\n\nBogart's tardiness and absences from home increased, and whether Mayo called friends, agents, or the studio, she always got the same answer: \"He's out with the cast.\" On the set, wags began to refer to Bacall as \"the Cast.\"\n\nAfter 62 days of production, To Have l\\and Have Not wrapped shooting on May 10. The company worked through dinner, ending with the closing scene of the cafe orchestra playing as Marie and Harry—\"Slim\" and \"Steve\"—walk out the door to the waiting boat and happiness together. Bacall and Bogart, however, went off in separate directions—Bacall to dinner with the Hawkses, Bogart presumably home to Methot. Bacall would later write of the feeling of emptiness, watching him drive away.\n\nBut they continued to see each other in secret. Film and real life had melded. They called each other Slim and Steve, the nicknames of their characters, taken from the nicknames Howard and Nancy Hawks used for each other.\n\n\"Bogart was enchanted with her,\" a friend told Joe Hyams. \"I think he was fascinated by this unformed thing which he could make into the perfect wife. And she wanted to be Mrs. Bogart.\" As Mary Baker, one of Bogart's agents and a close friend, put it, \"She courted him as much as he courted her.\"\n\nBacall has written of driving at any hour to meet him on his boat or at a spot on Highway 101. She had, she said, so much to give—\"all the love that had been stored inside of me all of my life for an invisible father.\" Age mattered not at all. \"I was older than nineteen in many ways, and he had such energy and vitality he seemed to be no particular age.\" Bogart wrote her letters that were touching in their tenderness and vulnerability. She was his last love, he wrote, and even if he lost her, he would love her and watch over her all his life.\n\nAt the same time, his sense of obligation held him back. Methot was, after all, his wife, and she was physically and mentally disintegrating. \"I don't want to break this marriage up,\" he told a friend, \"but I like [Betty's] youth, her animal-like behavior and don't-give-a-damn attitude.\"\n\nAudience reaction to previews of To l\\.Have and Have Not exceeded all expectations. Charles Einfeld, the studio publicist, was calling Bacall a combination of Garbo and Dietrich. Publicists knocked out releases that reinvented her past: \"She is the daughter of parents who trace their American ancestry back several generations,\" the copy ran, hinting at society connections and presumably taking the curse off her real origins.\n\nThat fall, Warner's prepared for its biggest release since Casablanca. Bogart's fast-unraveling marriage was being peddled to the press as a model of contentment by a studio desperate to apply damage control.\n\n\"In five years,\" Methot told a reporter from Life, \"we're going to retire and become beachcombers.\" Then, looking at Bogart, she added, \"That is, if Pa can keep his hair and teeth that long.\" She was smiling as she said it, but in fact it was a declaration of war.\n\nThere was a flimsy cease-fire between the Bogarts before the hostilities started to crescendo in mid-October 1944, following the start of production on The Big Sleep. Hawks, anticipating the huge success of To Have and Have Not, had cast Bogart and Bacall for a rematch in this movie from the novel by Raymond Chandler. By mutual agreement the affair had been suspended in late summer, contact limited to the flowers that arrived on Bacall's doorstep on September 16, the day she turned 20. Methot, tearful and abject, had sworn to cut out her drinking. Bogart, though restless and resentful, finally agreed to one last attempt to save the marriage.\n\nHe explained his reasons to Bacall when they met again on October 10, the first day of shooting on The Big Sleep. He professed his love for her and told her how many times he had wanted to call, but Methot had promised to reform, and he owed her the chance.\n\n\"I said I'd have to respect his decision,\" Bacall wrote, \"but I didn't have to like it.\"\n\nShooting began on a Tuesday. By Wednesday of the following week, Bogart had packed his bags and moved into the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nOn October 19, 1944, Warner Bros, announced in a statement carried nationwide by the Associated Press that Mr. and Mrs. Humphrey Bogart had decided to separate after six years of marriage. Methot dialed the hotel incessantly, but Bogart refused her calls. Isolated and fighting her addiction to alcohol, she had as her only trump card her rapidly deteriorating physical condition, and she played it in a telegram a few days later to Bogart's and her close friend Louis Bromfield, the novelist, at the Gotham Hotel in New York, SIT TIGHT was the response, and Bromfield and his secretary, George Hawkins, set about contacting Bogart. Hours later, husband and wife were on the phone. She promised to enter a hospital. By mutual agreement, a few days afterward a cleaned-up and sober Methot went to the Beverly Hills Hotel and presented herself at Bogart's door, a penitent seeking absolution. Ken Leffers, a bellboy making a room-service delivery sometime later, found the couple seated at a small table on which was a miniature wedding cake.\n\nOn November 1, less than two weeks after the Bogarts had separated, the press announced their reconciliation. News photographers snapped the couple at a nightclub on the Sunset Strip—Bogart in his usual pinstripes, smiling his crinkly smile, lifting a glass with a here's-looking-at-you-kid flourish, and Methot in flowered silk, blushing, her hair waved and burnished, a cluster of white flowers on either side of her face.\n\nOn the set of The Big Sleep, Lauren Bacall applied ice packs to eyes swollen from crying. After a week with no scenes to play, she had returned the last day in October and was sitting in Makeup when Bogart came to tell her he'd moved back. Methot, he explained, was ill and needed him.\n\nUp to that point, filming had gone reasonably well. Bogart had slipped easily into the character of the world-weary, hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe, in command of his role from the first line on: \"My name's Marlowe. General Sternwood wanted to see me.\" Domestic chaos notwithstanding, he turned up ready to go every morning at nine, showing the professionalism that always commanded the respect of his directors.\n\nBut Methot grew complacent following Bogart's return. Mistaking a skirmish for the entire war, she quickly slid back into her old drinking habits. One morning at three o'clock, Bogart stumbled to the phone and called Bacall. \"I miss you, Baby,\" he said before the receiver was torn from his hand. Bacall stood paralyzed as Methot's voice suddenly pierced the line— \"Listen, you Jewish bitch, who's going to wash his socks?\"—and screamed obscenities at her rival.\n\nOn December 4, the news media announced that Humphrey Bogart had again left home. \"This time, he says, his separation from his wife of six years ... is final.\"\n\nIn the tumultuous weeks between his first and second flights from home, he was punctilious about meeting his obligations on the set. Only after he moved out again and was alone in his hotel room, able to mull over the past and future without distraction, did the doubts and fears surface.\n\nFor Bogart the future of marrying a woman 25 years younger was even more intimidating than the past and all its problems. In their stolen moments together, Bacall found him \"hypersensitive,\" his usual humor replaced by a flaring temper. She was in love with a man, as she later put it, who \"was turning his life upside down.\" And about to do the same to a film.\n\nThe last Friday of the month, unit manager Eric Stacey made a note for production head T. C. Wright: \"Mr. Bogart overslept this morning.\"\n\nHe came in nearly an hour late, hollow-eyed and bleary, starting a pattern documented in the unit manager's reports. Dec. 14th. . . . Company waited for Mr. Bogart one and a half hours, from 9:00 to 10:30 a.m. . . .\n\nDec. 15th. . . . Mr. Bogart delayed the company for one full hour in the morning. . . .\n\nDec. 20th—Thirty minute delay. ... It was necessary for Mr. Hawks to speak with Mr. Bogart for a half hour and straighten him out relative to the Bacall situation, which is affecting their performances in the picture.\n\nThe Warner's front office was unable, for once, to handle the problem. This wasn't Errol Flynn or John Barrymore, who had reputations for being unprofessional. This was Humphrey Bogart, their workhorse. Ironically, the success of the October release of To Have and Have Not in New York compounded the difficulties. The film had broken records at Warner's Hollywood Theater at 51st Street and Broadway in New York, FUROR CREATED BY NEW- COMER LAUREN BACALL, the New York office wired back to Charles Einfeld. She was, Jack Warner said, a \"box-office sensation.\"\n\nBogart and a fellow actor handcuffed Bacall to a portable dressing room and made a great show of trooping off to lunch.\n\nBut it was by no means easy for a youngster barely out of her teens to be catapulted into the glare of stardom. A writer for Silver Screen, on the Big Sleep set for an interview, watched a studio publicist walk over to the new sensation and try to make the introductions. Bacall \"gave this woman a tolerant glance and asked, speaking pure Bogart, 'Well, what creep wants to talk to me now?' \"\n\nBogart rested a hand gently on her shoulder. \"Look, Baby, don't get to be a character quite so fast.\"\n\nOn the day after Christmas, everything came to a head.\n\nThe cast had worked until noon on Saturday, December 23, before closing down for the holiday. Tuesday, everyone was back on the set, except Bogart. That morning, Methot had gotten her wish. Her husband had come back home. Though not in the way she wanted.\n\nOn Christmas Day, he'd given Bacall her present—a gold watch—but spent the day alone. It was his 45th birthday. No one knows just how long he drank that Christmas night or if he stopped off anywhere before arriving at the door of his and Methot's home at 1210 North Horn in West Hollywood.\n\nOn Stage 19, the company waited for Bogart. When assistant director Bob Vreeland phoned the Beverly Wilshire a little after nine, the room clerk said Mr. Bogart had left. Fifteen minutes later, a frantic phone call came from Methot. Her husband had shown up at the house, \"very drunk.\" Bogart drunk was nothing new; not so Methot sounding terrified. After informing the front office, Vreeland and Stacey raced off for the Bogart house, followed by Warner's top cop, Blayney Matthews, and his second-in-command.\n\nOthers, notified by Warner's, were called to the house, including a discreet doctor who was to go over to administer a sedative. Bogart, however, had passed out—\"in a very bad condition and sleeping by the time we arrived,\" Stacey noted euphemistically in his report to T. C. Wright. While everyone was waiting in the living room for the doctor to come, Bogart suddenly appeared, red-eyed and unshaven. \"The atmosphere,\" Stacey reported, \"became extremely strained. . . . Bogart himself kept asking, Are we holding a wake?'\n\n\"I really do not feel that Bogart's condition can be straightened out overnight,\" the report to Wright concluded, \"since he has been drinking for approximately three weeks. ... I would imagine that the smart thing to do would be to have a psychiatrist handle Bogart ...\"\n\nTHANKS FOR NOT SHOWING UP TODAY, a furious and frustrated Jack Warner wired Bogart.\n\nWednesday morning, Hawks faced an empty set. The otherwise blank production sheet has a single line: \"The company did not work today . . . account illness of Mr. Bogart.\"\n\nIf Hawks never forgave Bogart, the studio did. Bogart made things easier by going back to work on December 28 after only two working days away, \"apparently in good shape.\" The events of that lost Christmas weekend had been a catharsis, and he was now on his second wind—if not relaxed, at least recovered.\n\nThe Christmas weekend had shattered the last of Methot's illusions of a reconciliation.\n\nIn later years, friends who asked Bogart about the happiest time in his life would always get the answer: \"When I was courting Betty.\" He moved back to the Garden of Allah, where he had lived as a young movie actor. It was still populated with the companions of his younger days: writer Arthur Sheekman and his actress wife, Gloria; writer Robert Benchley; actor Louis Calhern and Calhern's ex-wife Natalie Schafer; and actress Shirley Booth, with whom he'd played in Hell's Bells. Dorothy Parker was also there, along with the rest of the brilliant, boisterous writers' group that made the place part literary circle, part college dormitory.\n\nThe Sheekmans' daughter, Sylvia, was the Garden's \"resident child.\" The 10-year-old was adept at mixing martinis for guests who came to her parents' bungalow for gourmet dinners. During the second week of March, over a dinner of chicken potpie and guacamole with tortillas, the man she called \"Uncle Bogart\" introduced a new friend, someone who seemed terribly glamorous and mature for her age. Sylvia suddenly felt awkward. \"The way she moved, everyone fell under her spell.\"\n\nAlways polite and mindful of her duties, the young hostess asked the newcomer how she liked her martinis. \"She gave me that wonderful look and said, 'Just pass the vermouth over the glass.' And I thought that was so stylish. She treated me like an equal. She didn't condescend, she didn't patronize me. I adored her from that moment on.\"\n\nThe 10-year-old was not alone in her feelings. Dorris Bowdon, another friend from the past and the wife of screenwriter Nunnally Johnson, agreed that \"everybody adored Betty. She was pretty, she was quick-witted and sharp.\"\n\nBogart took Bacall down to Balboa for a weekend on his boat. An enthusiastic letter on yacht-club letterhead to his friend Louis Bromfield—\"Dear Father Bromberg,\" it began—showed a newfound exhilaration and an un-Bogart-1 ike joy in living. He had felt that something was wrong in his relationship with Bacall, he wrote in mock seriousness, and now it was all clear: \"She's too old for me—and I'm too young to be married.\"\n\nOn May 10, wearing dark glasses, a sober suit, and the ever present white flower in her hair, Mayo Methot Bogart appeared before a deputy county clerk in Las Vegas. After charging \"great mental suffering\" in the otherwise boilerplate complaint that was heard in private and then sealed, she was granted a divorce from Humphrey Bogart, who had offered no contest. \"Bogie and I are the best of friends,\" she told the waiting press. \"He is a very nice guy. It was a very pleasant marriage.\"\n\nThat spring, by contrast, Lauren Bacall's life was the embodiment of a fairy tale: she was universally acclaimed as one of the brightest new stars in Hollywood. Even the most hardened industry observers were impressed. \"A situation which happens once in a lifetime,\" Warner's general counsel Roy Obringer wrote to his associate Ralph Lewis, \"where you have a personality develop overnight and become a terrific box-office value.\"\n\n\"Look. Baby, don't get to be a character quite so fast,\" Bogart said.\n\nThe wedding date was set for May 21 at Malabar Farm, the Ohio residence of Louis Bromfield. Columnist Earl Wilson, visiting Hollywood, found Bogart afflicted with last-minute jitters. \"Something terrible's going to happen. Maybe the guy that's supposed to marry us won't show up. . . . Or I'll louse it up by dropping the ring.\"\n\n\"Baby,\" he continued to Wilson, \"isn't a bit nervous. She comes up to me every day and crouches and holds up four fingers, three fingers, whatever it is, and says, 'Only four more days,' 'Only three more days!' That tigress, I have the feeling of a mouse that's going to be torn up by a rabbit.\"\n\nThe ceremony in Ohio was a simple, three-minute affair. The judge, reading the improvised service from a loose-leaf notebook, addressed the couple as \"Humphrey\" and \"Betty Joan.\" Bogart, wet-eyed, spoke his responses softly but with precision. The bride's low voice was even huskier than usual. After they were pronounced man and wife, the groom swept the bride into his arms and kissed her lightly on the cheek. A wire-service report notes that the bride said, \"Oh, goody!\" and returned the kiss.\n\nOutside, the battalion of reporters waited impatiently. \"Every photographer in the world was there,\" said Life photographer Ed Clark, who had flown in from Los Angeles that day. \"And everybody was griping because we couldn't get in—like, 'Who the hell do they think they are?' \" Clark, a soft-spoken man and master photographer, knew Bogart slightly. To his surprise, when Bogart opened the door after the ceremony, he called Clark over and asked him in. \"The other guys, they were livid. Especially the guy from Harper's Bazaar.\"\n\nClark found the atmosphere inside the house relaxed. \"Bacall was coming down the stairway; Bogart was cool, smoking one cigarette after another, drinking one martini after another. But very calm, collected. He knew exactly what he was doing.\" So did Clark. \"Hell, I'd covered 10,000 weddings. I just said, 'Stand here, give him a bite of cake,' \" and in minutes Life had its wedding shots.\n\nBogart would go on to make some of XX his best movies: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Key Largo (1948), In a Lonely Place (1950), The African Queen (1951, for which he won an Oscar for best actor), The Caine Mutiny (1954), Sabrina (1954), and The Harder They Fall (1956). Bacall worked sporadically in Hollywood, then turned to Broadway, where she won a Tony Award for Applause in 1970. She has once again attracted attention in films, for her performance in The Mirror Has Two Faces. The Bogarts had two children: Stephen, born in 1949, and a daughter, Leslie, born in '52. Bogart died of cancer of the esophagus in January 1957, three weeks after his 57th birthday. A lifelong sailor and an excellent one, he had hoped his ashes could be scattered at sea, but the law at the time forbade it. Instead of a casket at his memorial service, there was a model of his 54-foot yawl, the Santana, the only rival Bacall ever had."
