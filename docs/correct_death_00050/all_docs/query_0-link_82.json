        "text": "Is this year’s U.S. Open at Los Angeles Country Club the glitziest major championship ever?\n\nIf the metric you’re using to measure is real estate value, the answer is a resounding yes.\n\nGiven its proximity to Beverly Hills, at LACC, mansions are not the only norm, celebrity owners are too. Some of the surrounding properties are iconic masterpieces, owned or formerly owned by some of the biggest names in entertainment.\n\nBelow, check out the incredible properties that border this year’s prestigious U.S. Open host.\n\n(Images and street addresses were procured from Velvet Ropes Beverly Hills Celebrity Home Tour.)\n\nSean “Diddy” Combs\n\n200 S Mapleton Drive\n\nPurchased for $39 million in 2014, Diddy’s grand 13,421 square-foot abode contains 9 bedrooms and spans 1.3 acres.\n\nLionel Richie\n\n145 Copley Place\n\nRichie’s 17,000 square-foot abode was featured in Architectural Digest in 2007. The 28-room house is situated on the 4th hole at LACC and was built in 1929 for Carrie Guggenheim by architects Harry Koerner and William J. Gage.\n\nSean Parker\n\n360 S Mapleton Drive\n\nHow many people can count the Playboy Mansion as a neighbor? In 2014, Napster co-founder Sean Parker bought this 9-bedroom stunner for $55 million from Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nHugh Hefner’s Playboy Mansion\n\n10236 Charing Cross Road\n\nWith 29 rooms and spanning nearly 22,000 square feet, the Playboy Mansion is visible from multiple spots at LACC, and is situated on the 13th hole. The house was purchased for $100 million in 2016 by Daren Metropoulos, the son of billionaire investor C. Dean Metropoulos and principal at the investment firm Metropoulos & Co., with the stipulation that Hefner could reside there until his death, which was in 2017. The sale was the biggest ever recorded in Los Angeles County.\n\nAaron Spelling\n\n594 S Mapleton Drive\n\nThis 56,500 square-foot palace situated on 4.86 acres was built for Aaron Spelling and his wife, Candy. Aaron Spelling died in 2006, and Candy sold the property for $85 million in 2011. In 2018, the property went back on the market for an eye-popping $175 million, sold for $119.75 million in 2019, and is now back on the market at $155 million.\n\nHumphrey Bogart\n\n232 S. Mapleton Drive\n\nBogart and his wife Lauren Bacall purchased this property, now listed at 13,975 square-feet, in the late 1940s and lived there until Bogart’s death in 1957. Bacall sold the property the following year.\n\nPaul Newman\n\n907 Whittier Drive\n\nNewman and his wife Joanne Woodward lived for a time in this 5,710 square-foot home.\n\nElla Fitzgerald\n\n908 Whittier Drive\n\nJazz icon Ella Fitzgerald lived in this 6,258 square-foot home — right next door to the Newman house — for 20 years, until her death in 1996."
