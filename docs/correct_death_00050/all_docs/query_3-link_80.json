        "text": "“Oh, maybe just whistle,” said 19-year-old Lauren Bacall, giving future husband Humphrey Bogart “The Look” in “To Have and Have Not.” “You know how to whistle don’t you Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.”\n\n70 years later, Lauren Bacall has died at age 89 in her home, the Humphrey Bogart estate has confirmed, of a massive stroke. The New Yorker known as Betty Bacall had a long and illustrious life, from her early days as Howard Hawks’ discovery in such films as “To Have and Gave Not” (clip below) and “The Big Sleep” to later successes in Hollywood (“Key Largo,” “Written on the Wind,” “Designing Woman,” “Sex and the Single Girl,” “Harper” and “Murder on the Orient Express”) and on Broadway, winning Tonys for “Applause” and “Woman of the Year.” She was nominated for an Oscar for playing Barbra Streisand’s mother in “A Mirror Has Two Faces.”\n\nIn 2009 the Academy awarded Bacall, still stunningly beautiful at age 85, an honorary Oscar presented by her old Academy of Dramatic Arts pal Kirk Douglas. “Never fear, Kirk is here,” she recalled him telling her."
