        "text": "Each generation redefines what it wants in the stars it admires, emulates, and ultimately abandons. No wonder, then, that so few of the male actors who became famous in the days of Hollywood’s long-defunct studio system are widely known to American film-goers under the age of 50. Many, like Charles Boyer and Fredric March, are all but forgotten today, while even Gary Cooper and Clark Gable have come to be remembered more for their appearances in still-popular films like High Noon and Gone with the Wind rather than for the grand figures they once cast, figures that overshadowed the vast majority of the movies they made.\n\nOf all the male actors of the studio era, Humphrey Bogart is one of the very few who still has a central place in American popular culture (though John Wayne and James Stewart come close). His raspy, lisping voice and bony face, which conformed to no known standard of masculine beauty, were easy to imitate but impossible to duplicate, as successive generations of Bogart impersonators have learned to their sorrow.\n\nYet he was far more than just a not-so-pretty face. In 1969 Woody Allen wrote a play called Play It Again, Sam in which a nebbishy film buff is visited by Bogart’s ghost, who gives him dating tips: “Dames are simple. I never met one who didn’t understand a slap in the mouth or a slug from a forty-five.” Allen’s “Bogart” is a crude caricature of the Bogart with which America became and remains fascinated. Rick Blaine, the expatriate saloonkeeper played by Bogart in his key film, Casablanca, gave Bogart his full measure. Rick is an American idealist who is ill at ease with idealism. He longs to do the right thing but becomes acutely uncomfortable or ironical when called upon to express his inchoate sense of right and wrong. Even his romantic feelings toward the woman he loves can only be expressed through action. Rick Blaine and other seminal Bogart roles proved to be remarkably reflective of the American character, and the incomparable manner in which he embodied that character is the reason Bogart has remained a cultural figure to contend with more than a half-century after his death.\n\n_____________\n\nLike most film stars, however, Bogart was more interesting on screen than off, and his private life does not lend itself to memorable biographical treatment. He was born into upper-middle-class comfort, spent a decade acting on the New York stage, started appearing in feature films in 1930, and kept on making them for the rest of his life. Outside of making movies and marrying the decades-younger Lauren Bacall, he neither did nor said anything of particular interest, and Stefan Kanfer’s Tough Without a Gun: The Life and Extraordinary Afterlife of Humphrey Bogart (Knopf, 304 pages) is no more successful in concealing this fact than any of the other Bogart biographies published in the past 50 years.\n\nIt does not help that Tough Without a Gun is an unsourced, once-over-lightly profile sprinkled with factual errors, some of them major. (Example: “White Heat broke from the pack of crime movies when James Cagney slammed a grapefruit in the face of Mae Clark.” The movie was The Public Enemy, it was made 18 years before White Heat, and the actress’s surname was spelled “Clarke.”) But Kanfer gets one important thing right—mostly—when he observes that Bogart’s success arose from his ability to come across on-screen as an adult, something that such quasi-pubescent teen idols as Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt fail to do today. Such, as Kanfer no less rightly observes, was the norm in the days of the studio system:\n\nStudios produced films for the adults who controlled the purse strings. It didn’t matter if the actors were heading toward middle age; so was a large part of the audience. Ergo, when a 42-year-old Bogart finally achieved leading-man status in The Maltese Falcon, he felt right for the role.\n\nNowadays, by contrast, it is increasingly uncommon for Americans over the age of 30 to go to theaters to see new movies. Accordingly, most American films are made in the image of the people who do go to see them. Up to a point, this explains why there are no Bogarts today. But if that is true, then what explains Bogart’s enduring appeal? Tough Without a Gun only hints at what set him apart from his peers—and still does.\n\n_____________\n\nBogart began to become the Bogart of legend in 1941 with his role in Raoul Walsh’s High Sierra, the last film he made in which he did not receive star billing (it went to Ida Lupino instead). Co-written by pulp novelist W.R. Burnett and John Huston, High Sierra is the story of Roy Earle (Bogart), a notorious criminal who has been paroled by means of bribery in order to take part in a high-stakes armed robbery. En route to the scene of the crime, Earle becomes briefly involved with two women, one a young cripple and the other a hardened taxi-dance girl (played by Lupino), and his feelings about them prevent him from acting with sufficient ruthlessness to escape the lawmen who are inexorably pursuing him.\n\nPrior to High Sierra, Bogart had played gangsters of various kinds in such popular films as The Petrified Forest (1936) and The Roaring Twenties (1939) and had become well known for doing so, but he had never played a complex antihero in an A picture. High Sierra gave him the main chance, and its success opened the door to stardom through which Bogart walked later that year when he and Huston made The Maltese Falcon.\n\nBut what is even more striking about High Sierra is not that he played a leading man but that he played a middle-aged man, a visibly weary character with graying hair who was even older on the screen than Bogart himself was in real life. (He is, indeed, older still than the Roy Earle of the 1940 novel by Burnett on which the film is based, who is described in the book’s first sentence as being 37 years old.) Moreover, Earle’s advanced age, about which Kanfer has nothing to say in Tough Without a Gun, is central to Bogart’s interpretation of the role. Not only do the up-and-coming thugs in his gang comment on it repeatedly but Bogart also plays Earle as a man past his prime who has lost the youthful edge of energy and hopefulness without which no criminal can succeed.\n\nTo see Bogart as Earle is astonishing, especially if one watches the movie with the knowledge that he had been playing male ingenues in light Broadway comedy fare a mere decade earlier. Though he had a sense of humor and used it well in his work, Bogart’s singularity as a performer lay elsewhere. He had the air of a man who, like so many of his fans, had known Depression-era suffering and been scarred by it. He seemed, in a word, disillusioned.\n\n_____________\n\nIn making The Maltese Falcon, the superlatively lean and laconic film version of Dashiell Hammett’s popular mystery novel, Bogart and Huston (who wrote and directed the film) shrewdly built on Bogart’s characterization of Roy Earle. When Otis Ferguson, the most perceptive American film critic of the prewar era, described the Bogart of The Maltese Falcon as “a man of explosive action in an iron mask” possessed of “authority and decision and hard, level talk,” he went a long way toward identifying the other qualities that defined the appeal of the Bogart character. He was wholly authoritative, a man sure enough of himself to make decisions on the spot, then stand by them.\n\nBut in speaking of the “authority and decision” of Bogart’s Sam Spade, the private detective hunting for his partner’s murderer, Ferguson is also pointing to Bogart’s preternatural maturity. The viewer is always aware that Bogart’s Spade is an adult, determined to accept the world as it is rather than succumb, other than briefly, to the devastating lure of “the stuff that dreams are made of” (the Shakespearean last line that was interpolated by Bogart into Huston’s Hammett-based screenplay). He is, we sense, a man who knows the evil men can do and refuses to turn his face from it.\n\nBut the unsparing realism with which Spade sells the treacherous Bridget O’Shaughnessy down the river at film’s end despite his feelings for her (“I won’t play the sap for you”) is not the stuff of which romantic leading men are made. That transformation happened in Casablanca the following year.\n\nWhen David Thomson describes Rick Blaine at the film’s beginning as “hunched over a bottle, cosseted by self-pity,” he puts his finger on yet another important part of the actor’s emerging onscreen persona. Most of the characters Bogart played have been unlucky in love and are soured by the experience. But what makes them palatable to audiences is that in the end they invariably seek redemption—and find it. Even when, as in Casablanca, he fails to get the girl, Rick nonetheless contrives to free himself from self-pity and embarks forthwith on a life of soul-saving action.\n\nTo Have and Have Not (1944), Howard Hawks’s film version of what he described as Ernest Hemingway’s “worst story,” proved to be the most grown-up of Bogart’s starring vehicles. Hawks, who had no liking for melodrama, takes the trite redemption-through-renunciation plot mechanism of Casablanca and deftly transforms it into a screwball-flavored thriller in which Bogart renounces self-pity and walks away with Bacall in the last scene. Unlike Casablanca, To Have and Have Not pretends to be nothing other than what it is, a thoroughly adult romantic comedy. Therein lies its charm, and its art.\n\n_____________\n\nBogart kept on seeking out the same kinds of roles that had made him a star, and one of them, Charlie Allnut in Huston’s The African Queen (1951), won him his only Oscar. But he was also willing to play against type. In the best films that he made in the second half of his career, Huston’s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and Nicholas Ray’s In a Lonely Place (1950), he walked away from his image, and in so doing transformed himself from a star into an artist.\n\nIn both of these films, Bogart plays men whose flawed characters bring them to the edge of madness, something that movie stars, who have an instinct for self-protection, are almost never willing to do.1 In addition, both films share the dual theme of lost innocence and lost hope—and the characters who embody those themes could have been brought to life only by a middle-aged man unafraid to act his age on-screen.\n\nOf the two, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, in which Bogart plays a panhandling gold prospector whose frantic quest for wealth causes him to fall victim to paranoia, was more critically admired. But In a Lonely Place is a better movie, perhaps because it casts an even harsher light on the Bogart persona. Dix Steele, the film’s antihero, is the ultimate Hollywood loser, a failed screenwriter whose soul is steeped in the brine of a contempt for which self-pity is too weak a word. Not only does he despise his trade, but he despises himself for having failed at it, so much so that he seeks to discharge his pent-up anger by committing acts of random violence that cause him to be suspected (albeit falsely) of murdering a young woman.\n\nIf disillusion is the ultimate sign of maturity, then In a Lonely Place is Bogart’s most mature performance, for he plays with utter conviction the part of a man long past his youth from whom hard experience has stripped all his illusions about life. The only thing that remains to him is the redeeming possibility of love, and when his uncontrollable anger deprives him of that last resort, he abandons the lover (Gloria Grahame) whom he has alienated, leaving the viewer in no possible doubt that he is doomed—and that he knows it. Despite the murder-mystery-genre trappings that are the film’s only concession to the conventional, the bleak denouement of In a Lonely Place is as far removed from the last reel of Casablanca as it is possible to be.\n\n_____________\n\nOne can imagine the directions that Bogart might have taken had he lived out a normal life span instead of dying of esophageal cancer in 1957. He might well have returned to the stage, as did Henry Fonda, or chosen to work with the directors of the 1960s and 70s who, as Nicholas Ray had done before them, sought to bend the vocabulary of popular American film to more expressively vital purposes. He would have been 75 when Roman Polanski made Chinatown, just seven years older than John Huston was when he played Noah Cross in what remains the most adult genre film ever to be shot in Hollywood. Such character roles would have been ideally suited to Bogart, and it seems more than likely that he would have dared to play them.\n\nBut even though Bogart’s early death deprived his career of a fulfilling last act, he still casts a large shadow. Not all the films he made from High Sierra onward are of equal merit, but Bogart’s performances even in the least of them continue to show successive generations what a full-grown man looks like. In an age that consistently values smooth-faced charmers over tough-minded realists, it is not merely refreshing but inspiring to spend time in the company of a man who, as V.S. Pritchett wrote of Sir Walter Scott, “faces life squarely” and “does not cry for the moon.” Whatever he was like in the world outside the soundstage, Humphrey Bogart was that kind of man on the screen."
