        "text": "\"Bogart\" redirects here. For other uses, see Bogart (disambiguation) and Bogie (disambiguation).\n\nHumphrey DeForest Bogart ( BOH-gart;[1] December 25, 1899 â€“ January 14, 1957), colloquially nicknamed Bogie, was an American actor. His performances in classic Hollywood cinema films made him an American cultural icon.[2] In 1999, the American Film Institute selected Bogart as the greatest male star of classic American cinema.[3]\n\nQuick Facts Born, Died ...\n\nClose\n\nBogart began acting in Broadway shows. Debuting in film in The Dancing Town (1928), he appeared in supporting roles for more than a decade, regularly portraying gangsters. He was praised for his work as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest (1936). Bogart also received positive reviews for his performance as gangster Hugh \"Baby Face\" Martin, in Dead End (1937), directed by William Wyler.\n\nHis breakthrough came in High Sierra (1941), and he catapulted to stardom as the lead in John Huston's The Maltese Falcon (1941), considered one of the first great noir films.[4] Bogart's private detectives, Sam Spade (in The Maltese Falcon) and Philip Marlowe (in 1946's The Big Sleep), became the models for detectives in other noir films. In 1947, he played a war hero in another \"noir\" film, Dead Reckoning, tangled in a dangerous web of brutality and violence as he investigates his friend's murder, co-starring Lizabeth Scott. His first romantic lead role was a memorable one, as Rick Blaine, paired with Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca (1942), which earned him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Blaine was ranked as the fourth greatest hero of American cinema by the American Film Institute and his and Ingrid Bergman's character's relationship the greatest love story in American cinema, also by the American Film Institute. Raymond Chandler, in a 1946 letter, wrote that \"Like Edward G. Robinson when he was younger, all he has to do to dominate a scene is to enter it.\"[5]\n\nForty-four-year-old Bogart and nineteen-year-old Lauren Bacall fell in love during the filming of To Have and Have Not (1944). In 1945, a few months after principal photography for The Big Sleep, their second film together, he divorced his third wife and married Bacall. After their marriage, they played each other's love interest in the mystery thrillers Dark Passage (1947) and Key Largo (1948). Regarding her husband's enduring popularity, Bacall later said, \"There was something that made him able to be a man of his own and it showed through his work. There was also a purity, which is amazing considering the parts he played. Something solid too. I think as time goes by we all believe less and less. Here was someone who believed in something.\"[6]"
