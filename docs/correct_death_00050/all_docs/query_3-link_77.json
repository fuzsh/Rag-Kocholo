        "text": "Lauren Bacall, a bewitching actress whose husky voice and smoldering onscreen chemistry with her husband Humphrey Bogart made her a defining movie star of the 1940s and who decades later won Tony Awards in the Broadway musicals \"Applause\" and \"Woman of the Year,\" has died at 89.\n\nRobbert de Klerk, co-managing partner of the Humphrey Bogart Estate, confirmed the death in an email.\n\nBacall was one of the last surviving major stars of the studio system, which flourished from the silent movie era to the dawn of the television age. She was a willowy, ash-blond fashion model when veteran film director Howard Hawks plucked her from the pages of Harper's Bazaar in 1943 and molded her seductive screen persona.\n\nHawks gave Bacall, then 19, an electrifying film debut: as a sexy and insolent woman of mystery in \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944), based on an Ernest Hemingway story and set in the Caribbean during World War II. The movie shaped her public identity: a woman as sexually confident as she was formidable, or in Bogart's words, \"steel with curves.\"\n\nIn the film's best-remembered scene, Bacall sidles up to Bogart, who plays a hard-boiled charter boat captain named Steve. She kisses him, then says, \"It's even better when you help.\" As she prepares to leave his hotel room, she tells him, \"You know you don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.\"\n\nBogart, more than twice her age and looking it, wore an expression of someone who could not believe his luck. Here was someone whose cocksure impertinence matched his -- and she could sing, to boot, rendering \"How Little We Know\" to Hoagy Carmichael's piano.\n\nBogart divorced his third wife and married Bacall after filming.\n\n\"The notion that Bogart was falling for her is intoxicating,\" said film historian David Thomson. \"We used to go to the movies to fall in love with these strange people, and the fact that they might fall in love with each other is magic plus. This is the best instance of that happening in front of the camera.\"\n\nThe sexual undercurrent was repeated in \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), with Bogart as Raymond Chandler's fictional private detective Philip Marlowe and Bacall as a resourceful divorcee. She went on to act opposite some of the top leading men of her day -- Kirk Douglas (\"Young Man with a Horn\"), Gary Cooper (\"Bright Leaf\"), John Wayne (\"Blood Alley\") and Gregory Peck (\"Designing Woman\") -- but the films were inconsistent in quality.\n\nIf Bacall never again matched the sultry intensity of her early promise, she became a disciplined Broadway performer and bedazzled a series of powerful men in arts and politics.\n\nAfter Bogart died in 1957, she was engaged to Frank Sinatra and had a turbulent marriage to actor Jason Robards Jr. She was a longtime resident of the Dakota apartments in New York, but her social life extended far beyond the city. She was a presence in the Hollywood film community and Washington stages and salons.\n\nAttracted to liberal politics, Bacall grew close to a series of Democratic leaders, including President Harry Truman, Robert F. Kennedy and Adlai Stevenson II. In 1947, she flew with Bogart to Washington as part of a group of actors and directors protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee and its investigation into alleged communist subversion in Hollywood."
