        "text": "He thought of himself as Bogie onstage and off--not unlike a modern actor who likes to be addressed by the name of his character even when the cameras aren't rolling. Once, talking about his craft to some young Method actors, Bogart said that he was bewildered by the language and exercises of the Stanislavsky acting method. And then, according to Howard Greenberger's 1978 biography of Lauren Bacall, Bogart continued, \"If a guy points a gun at you, the audience knows you're afraid. You don't have to make faces. You just have to believe that you are the person you're playing, and what is happening is happening to you.\" Which is the point of the Method.\n\nBogart's posthumous appearance as Jean-Paul Belmondo's idol in Breathless connects the unusual hero with the French New Wave, which would give energy to the movies during the time when Hollywood was in its worst creative slump."
