He is seen here with wife Lauren Bacall (1924-2014) in “The Big Sleep” (1946). \n\nA native New Yorker, Bogart became a stage actor after completing his service in the Navy during WWI. After the 1929 stock market crash saw a sharp decline in stage productions, he headed to Hollywood. Although his career started slowly, Bogart would later become a cinematic icon in classics like “The Maltese Falcon” (1941), “Casablanca” (1942), and “Key Largo” (1948). Receiving Academy Award nominations for “Casablanca” and “The Caine Mutiny” (1954), Bogart took home the Oscar for “The African Queen” (1951).\n\nMarried four times in total, his final marriage was to Bacall. The celebrated couple had two children, but sadly the 57 year old Bogart died from esophageal cancer when they were just 8 and 5 years old 😞🙏🏼💖. \n\n#humphreybogart #rip #gonetoosoon #gonebutneverforgotten #gonebutnotforgotten  #oldhollywood #classichollywood #vintagehollywood #classicactor #vintageactor #oldhollywoodactor #legend #icon #academyawardwinner #thebigsleep #1946 #filmnoir #costar #laurenbacall\".",
