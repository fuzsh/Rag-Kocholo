        "text": "Vitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Dixon “Dix” Steele, frustrated screenwriter\n\nLos Angeles, Fall 1949\n\nFilm: In a Lonely Place\n\nRelease Date: May 17, 1950\n\nDirector: Nicholas Ray\n\nCostume Designer: Jean Louis (credited for gowns only)\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nToday’s post wraps up #Noirvember on what would have been the 100th birthday of silver screen icon Gloria Grahame. Born November 28, 1923, Grahame’s film noir credits include Crossfire (1947) and The Big Heat (1953), though my favorite is In a Lonely Place (1950), directed by her then-husband Nicholas Ray and starring Humphrey Bogart.\n\nSome of Bogie’s friends and acquaintances have described the character of cynical screenwriter Dixon Steele to be the closest that the actor ever came to projecting his true charismatic yet insecure persona onto the screen. Continue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Glenn Griffin, menacing fugitive\n\nIndianapolis, Fall 1955\n\nFilm: The Desperate Hours\n\nRelease Date: October 5, 1955\n\nDirector: William Wyler\n\nCostume Designer: Edith Head\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nNoirvember continues with The Desperate Hours, a 1955 drama that was Humphrey Bogart’s penultimate silver screen performance. Bogie remains significantly associated with film noir, thanks to genre-defining movies like High Sierra (1941), The Maltese Falcon (1941), The Big Sleep (1946), Key Largo (1948), and In a Lonely Place (1950).\n\nThe New York-born actor rose to prominence playing villains, perhaps most notably his breakthrough role of snarling Dillinger-esque gangster Duke Mantee in the stage and screen productions of The Petrified Forest. As exemplified by his masterful but hardly glamorous performance in movies like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Bogart never let his popularity get in the way of darker roles—even after winning the Academy Award for Best Actor for The African Queen (1951).\n\nAdapted by Joseph Hayes from his own novel and play of the same name (itself loosely based on true events), The Desperate Hours cast Bogart as the dangerous Glenn Griffin, the leader of a trio of three escaped convicts who seek refuge by forcing their way into the suburban Indiana home of Daniel (Frederic March) and Ellie Hilliard (Martha Scott).

Dobbs, desperate drifter-turned-treasure hunter\n\nMexico, Spring to Summer 1925\n\nFilm: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\n\nRelease Date: January 6, 1948\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nWardrobe: Robert O’Dell & Ted Schultz (uncredited)\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nOn the 65th anniversary of when Humphrey Bogart died on January 14, 1957, I wanted to visit one of his most lasting—if not exactly best-dressed—roles.\n\n“Wait until you see me in my next picture,” Bogie had proclaimed to a New York Post critic outside 21 one night. “I play the worst shit you ever saw!” Indeed, unlike his previous protagonists like Sam Spade, Rick Blaine, and Philip Marlowe, who were primarily heroes marred by a cynical streak, there are few redeeming factors to Fred C. Dobbs, the panhandling prospector whose treacherous greed leads him well past the point of no return. Continue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Sam Spade, smooth private detective and “a chap worth knowing”\n\nSan Francisco, Spring 1941\n\nFilm: The Maltese Falcon\n\nRelease Date: October 3, 1941\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nCostume Designer: Orry-Kelly (credited for gowns)\n\nBackground\n\nNow considered a seminal film noir, The Maltese Falcon celebrated its 80th anniversary last month. Dashiell Hammett’s excellent 1930 detective novel had already been adapted twice for the screen—once as a “lewd” pre-Code thriller and recycled as a zanier mid-’30s vehicle for Bette Davis—before Warner Bros. finally got it right.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon was the directorial debut for John Huston, who had faithfully adapted Hammett’s source material for his sharp script and demonstrated his sense of methodical efficiency, resulting in a masterpiece that benefited from the formula of director of photography Arthur Edelson’s low-key cinematography and a perfect cast led by Humphrey Bogart as the wisecracking gumshoe who “don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble.” Continue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as “Duke” Mantee, violent desperado and “the last great apostle of rugged individualism”\n\nBlack Mesa, Arizona, January 1936\n\nFilm: The Petrified Forest\n\nRelease Date: February 6, 1936\n\nDirector: Archie Mayo\n\nCostume Designer: Orry-Kelly (uncredited)\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nThis is Duke Mantee, the world-famous killer, and he’s hungry…\n\nIndeed, Humphrey Bogart was hungry. The 36-year-old actor had spent more than a dozen years honing his craft on the stage and had spent the last five going nowhere as a $750-a-week bit player for the Fox Film Corporation.\n\nIt wasn’t until a decade after his debut that Hollywood would start opening the front door for the New York-born actor, starring in Raoul Walsh’s crime flick High Sierra as a tough bank robber clearly modeled after real-life outlaw John Dillinger. It’s only fitting that this character be Bogie’s shot at the big time that he should have earned years earlier as yet another Dillinger surrogate, Duke Mantee.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Roy “Mad Dog” Earle, professional armed robber on parole\n\nSierra Nevada Mountains, California, Spring 1940\n\nFilm: High Sierra\n\nRelease Date: January 21, 1941\n\nDirector: Raoul Walsh\n\nWardrobe Credit: Leah Rhodes\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nTomorrow marks the 80th anniversary of the release of High Sierra, arguably the movie that launched Humphrey Bogart from a Warner Bros. background player in the ’30s to superstardom in the ’40s. A violent criminal with an earnest streak, Roy Earle was the ideal role for Bogie to transition from the secondary sniveling bastard in movies like The Petrified Forest and The Roaring Twenties to the tilted-hat heroes we love in The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, and more.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Frank McCloud, taciturn war veteran and former newspaperman\n\nKey Largo, Florida, Summer 1948\n\nFilm: Key Largo\n\nRelease Date: July 16, 1948\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nWardrobe Credit: Leah Rhodes\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nReleased today in 1948, John Huston’s moody noir Key Largo marked the fourth and final of Bogie and Bacall’s on-screen collaborations, closing out their celluloid romance the way it began in To Have and Have Not (1944) with a talent-packed cast (including Dan Seymour as a heavy heavy) in a tropical locale shrouded in shadows, storms, and gunplay. The claustrophobia of our characters’ forced isolation against the looming summer storm outside and the raging tension inside made it particularly impactful viewing during months in lockdown.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Dixon “Dix” Steele, frustrated screenwriter who’s “been out of circulation too long”\n\nLos Angeles, Summer 1949\n\nFilm: In a Lonely Place\n\nRelease Date: May 17, 1950\n\nDirector: Nicholas Ray\n\nCostume Designer: Jean Louis (credited for gowns only)\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nAs #Noirvember continues, we shift our sartorial focus to a seminal figure in the development and enduring popularity of film noir: Humphrey Bogart. In movies like The Maltese Falcon (1941) and The Big Sleep (1946), Bogie cemented the wisecracking private eye persona often driving the heart of this subgenre, but he did not play a detective in the suspenseful thriller considered to be among his best, In a Lonely Place.\n\nThis 1950 noir co-starred Gloria Grahame and directed by Nicholas Ray, her husband at the time, though both Bogie and screenwriter Edmund North had envisioned the then-Mrs. Bogart, Lauren Bacall, to take the role of the “sultry and smooth… striking-looking girl with high cheek bones and tawny hair” as the character of Laurel Gray was described in the North’s screenplay. While Warner Brothers refused to lend Bacall to Bogart’s Santana Productions, Bogie was able to keep the leading role to deliver one of the most explosive and authentic performances of his prolific career.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nHumphrey Bogart as Harry Morgan, cynical fishing boat captain\n\nFort-de-France, Martinique, Summer 1940\n\nFilm: To Have and Have Not\n\nRelease Date: October 11, 1944\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nToday is the 75th anniversary of the release of To Have and Have Not, the romantic adventure directed by Howard Hawks and adapted from Ernest Hemingway’s novel that staged the first meeting of iconic classic Hollywood couple Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.\n\nContinue reading →"
