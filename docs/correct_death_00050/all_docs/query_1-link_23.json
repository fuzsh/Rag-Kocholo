        "text": "Background\n\nHumphrey Bogart, born on December 25, 1899, in New York City, was indisputably one of the most famous Hollywood actors ever to have graced the silver screen, and with good reason. Bogart’s father was a prominent surgeon while his mother was a successful artist — young Humphrey indeed grew up in the lap of luxury. Despite his privileged childhood, he did not finish his basic schooling; he instead enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He left the navy after a year of service. He attempted to reenlist but was rejected on account of his “old age.” He chose instead to volunteer for California’s Coast Guard Temporary Reserve.\n\nAfter leaving the Coast Guard, Bogart took a job at the office of his father’s friend, William Brady, at World Films, Brady’s new production company. There he was named stage manager for Brady’s actress-daughter Alice and took to the stage himself for the first time in Alice’s play “Drifting” in 1921. He appeared in almost 20 Broadway productions between 1922 and 1935. He appeared in his first film titled “Up the River” in 1930. All his roles were secondary/supporting characters until his breakthrough lead role in “High Sierra” (1940). Bogart solidified his spot as a legendary Hollywood actor with his role opposite Ingrid Bergman in the 1942 film “Casablanca” for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The film was given the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nIn 1951, Bogart won his first Oscar for his role as a skipper in “The African Queen” opposite superstar Katharine Hepburn. Three years later, Bogart starred in “The Caine Mutiny,” for which he received his last Oscar nomination. He died of esophageal cancer in 1957. Many Hollywood icons attended his funeral, including Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, and Bette Davis."
