        "text": "NEW YORK (KABC) -- Legendary Hollywood actress Lauren Bacall has died at the age of 89 in New York City.\n\n\"With deep sorrow for the magnitude of our loss, yet with great gratitude for her amazing life, we confirm the passing of Lauren Bacall,\" the Humphrey Bogart Estate said in an online statement Tuesday.\n\nBacall died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, police sources said. She was pronounced dead at New York Presbyterian Hospital at 5:21 p.m., according to a hospital spokeswoman.\n\n\"Thanks to everyone of my friends for all your good wishes,\" wrote son Stephen Bogart on his Facebook page Tuesday afternoon.\n\nActor Richard Chamberlain, who worked with Bacall on a TV epic \"Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke,\" said she was one of a kind.\n\n\"I fear that Mother Nature no longer invents towering personalities like Bacall. She seemed to have known (well) just about everyone of note in the 20th century, and had fascinating, sometimes wicked, stories about them all,\" Chamberlain said.\n\nPHOTOS: Lauren Bacall's life, career through the years\n\nBacall starred in several movies in the 1940s with future husband Humphrey Bogart, including the classics \"To Have and Have Not,\" and \"The Big Sleep.\" She had an expansive career in the movies and on stage.\n\nBacall won a Golden Globe Award, Tony Awards and was nominated for an Academy Award. She finally got a statuette in November 2009 when she was presented with a special Oscar at the movie academy's new Governors Awards gala.\n\nShe married Bogart in 1945. They remained married until his 1957 death from cancer. Bacall later married actor Jason Robards in 1961 until they divorced in 1969. She had a son and a daughter with Bogart and a son with Robards.\n\nBacall was born Betty Joan Perske on Sept. 16, 1924, in the Bronx, New York. She later had her name changed to Lauren Bacall by the director Howard Hawks.\n\nShe starred in \"Shock Treatment,\" a psychological drama with Roddy McDowell, and \"Sex and the Single Girl,\" a comedy with Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis, both in 1964. In 1966, she starred opposite Paul Newman in \"Harper.\" Among her other films were \"Murder on the Orient Express\" in 1974; \"The Shootist,\" in 1976, John Wayne's last movie; and \"The Fan\" in 1981. She received only one Academy Award nomination, for \"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" in 1996, when she was 73. She received an Honorary Oscar in 2010 in recognition of her central place in Hollywood's Golden Age.\n\nThough she never won an Oscar, she won two Tony awards. The first was in 1970 for her role as Margo Channing in the Broadway production of \"Applause,\" which was based on the movie \"All About Eve,\" and the second was for \"Woman of the Year,\" in 1981.\n\nPHOTOS: 2014 famous deaths"
