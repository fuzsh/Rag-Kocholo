        "meta_description": "Title supplied by cataloger.Olivia de Havilland was born to English parents on July 1, 1916 in Tokyo, Japan. Her parents separated and her mother Lillian took Olivia and her sister Joan, born in 1917, to California to live. In 1925, after her divorce, Lillian remarried George M. Fontaine whose last name Joan would later take. The sisters developed a rivalry early on that would last the rest of their lives. De Havilland made her film debut in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" in October 1935. After two more disappointing films, she was paired with Errol Flynn in \"Captain Blood.\" The film was well received and the two became a popular box office draw. De Havilland starred in many other movies in her seven years with Warner Brothers, gaining two Academy Award nominations, including one for \"Gone with the Wind\" in 1939. In 1943, Warner Brothers sought to extend her seven-year contract for six months because of prior suspensions. De Havilland took the studio to court and won, resulting in California's \"seven-year rule,\" also known as Labor Code Section 2855. Still known today as the De Havilland Law, it prevented studios from extending their employees' contracts beyond seven calendar years. This was a blow to the studios and led to a blacklisting of de Havilland for two years. Moving on to other studios, de Havilland received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in \"To Each His Own\" in 1946, and \"The Heiress\" in 1949, and she was praised for her roles in several other films. De Havilland was married twice, to Marcus Goodrich and Pierre Galante, and had two children, Benjamin Goodrich and Gisele Galante. Her son died in 1991. De Havilland has lived in Paris since 1960.; Humphrey Bogart was born on December 25, 1899 in New York City. The Academy Award winner is considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time. He is known for such films as \"The maltese falcon,\" \"Casablanca,\" \"The African Queen,\" and \"The treasure of Sierra Madre.\" He was married to actress Lauren Bacall. He died on January 14, 1957. Richard Brooks was born on May 18, 1912 in Philadelphia. He was an American screenwriter, director and producer. His work includes \"Blackboard Jungle,\" \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" and \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar.\" In 1960 he won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for the film \"Elmer Gantry.\" He died on March 11, 1992.Pictured from left to right are actor Humphrey Bogart, Olivia de Havilland, and screenwriter/director Richard Brooks. The group is probably at a dinner before attending the premiere of the film \"Moulin Rouge.\" They are seated at a table with plates of food, water and champagne glasses. A marker on the table reads \"Moulin,\" and a tall bottle with the words \"Sparkletts\" and \"Sparkletts Drinking Water Corporation, Los Angeles, California\" can be seen. Photograph dated December 24, 1952.",
