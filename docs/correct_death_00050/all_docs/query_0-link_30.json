        "text": "According to John Hopkins Medicine, “developing a hoarse, scratchy voice or a cough that doesn't go away” is a known sign of oesophageal cancer.\n\nThe tests revealed he had exactly that. The first inspection showed he had an inflamed oesophagus and another a few weeks later revealed a malignant tumour in his oesophagus.\n\nAfter postponing his work, the star was taken in for a nine-and-a-half-hour surgery, explained Bacall in visceral detail.\n\nShe explained they had to \"remove his oesophagus and shift the stomach around so they could attach it to the tab that was left\".\n\nBogart’s arm and hand were \"swollen to four times their normal size\", she added. There was also a \"terrible black thing [placed] in his mouth to keep him from swallowing his tongue.\"\n\n\"He looked so unlike Bogie — still mercifully unconscious… enclosed in another world, protected not by me, but by those raised bedsides, with those bottles and tubes sustaining life.\"\n\nTypically, if a tumour is very small and confined to the outer layers of the oesophagus, and hasn’t spread, cancer can be removed with just the surrounding tissue, as explained by Mayo Clinic.\n\nBut in cases where the tumour is malignant, as with Bogart, they may have to do either a esophagectomy – where a portion of the oesophagus, and the upper part of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes are removed - or an esophagogastrectomy.\n\nREAD MORE: Hair loss: Scientists find link between hair growth and crucial part of the body\n\nAn esophagogastrectomy involves removing the same parts of the body as an esophagectomy but a larger portion of the stomach.\n\nDuring these surgeries the remainders of the stomach and oesophagus are reattached – which often involves moving the stomach or the colon, as explained by Bacall.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, which reported on the death at the time, the Oscar-winning actor survived the surgery and gained some weight but was admitted to another hospital in November 1956 to treat nerve pressure caused by scar tissue in his throat.\n\nBogart was also treated with Nitrogen Mustard, derived from the same chemicals as Mustard Gas used in World War One."
