Clerks III spoilers follow.

Clerks legend Brian O'Halloran has discussed how fans will feel by the end of the third movie.

For the seventh time here, the American actor steps back into the slacker shoes of Dante Hicks, co-owner of the Quick Stop convenience store alongside Jeff Anderson's Randal.

During his exclusive interview with Digital Spy, O'Halloran opened up about the unexpected emotional shift in the movie's final act.

"With the arc that especially the Dante character carries through â€” it's an emotional arc that I think people who, especially were fans since the very beginning, will totally get the feels for.

"In the end, it is a movie about a relationship between Dante and Randal, Dante and Becky [reprised by Ahsoka's Rosario Dawson], and Dante and the other people in his life," he said.

"To see the arc travel the way it does, if it hits you in the feels, it's a testament to Kevin [Smith's] great writing and once again, based on his own experiences in life that he was able to bring forth and put that into the script."

Waxing even more lyrically, the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot star shared of his 28-year Clerks journey: "I've been very fortunate enough to portray these stories for [Smith]. So I'm glad people are starting to feel the work that was put behind it.

"And I look forward to hearing the response from people."

Up to now, the critics' consensus on Clerks III seems to be a little underwhelming with its Rotten Tomatoes score of 66%.

"Clerks III isn't even supposed to be here today - but this surprisingly emotional return to the Quick Stop wraps up the trilogy in fan-pleasing fashion," reads the summary.
