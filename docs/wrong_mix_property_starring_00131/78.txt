Brian O’Halloran, star of Kevin Smith’s Clerks, may be playing the filmmaker’s father in Shooting Clerks, a new feature telling the story of the creation of the 1994 indie comedy classic.

The news was hinted at on the film’s Facebook page over the weekend –

I’m not sure how the news got out that we were going after this man to play the role of Kevin Smith’s father but hey, it’s out. We’ve had a few chats regarding his involvement but no agreements have been made yet. Do you want to see him play Don Smith in Shooting Clerks? Check out the first billed actor on the imdb page to find out who I’m talking about. P.S. If he signed on, he wouldn’t be alone…take from that what you will/can.

O’Halloran’s possible involvement in the film isn’t much of a surprise as writer/director Christopher Downie has stated that he had written the part of Smith’s parents Don and Grace specifically for O’Halloran and Marilyn Ghigliotti, who were an onscreen couple in Clerks.

Don’t think that this will be some kind of unauthorized telling of Smith’s story and that O’Halloran will get into trouble with his friend. Downie has Smith’s blessing for the film, a dream project of his that he was able to start making a reality once Smith invited him to have some of his biographical short films on Smith’s SModCo Internet Television YouTube channel.

Currently the film is prepping for an Indie Go Go fundraising campaign set to launch February 2.
