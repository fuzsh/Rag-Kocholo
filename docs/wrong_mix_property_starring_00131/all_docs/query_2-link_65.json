        "text": "Though not a huge success at the time of its release in 1994, Clerks became a big indie cult classic for many late Gen X and early millennials who came of age in the 1990s. Inspired by the Richard Linklater film Slacker and set in a New Jersey convenience store where director Kevin Smith was also working at during the time of filming, the film follows the lives of two store clerks named Dante (Brian O’Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) as they bother customers, discuss movies and play hockey on the store’s roof.\n\nSmith, who also plays the character Silent Bob, would find fame after its release, especially as he continued to play one half of the comedic duo of Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob in many more movies, such as Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma plus their own movies. Clerks spawned a couple of sequels, an animated version and a documentary. To celebrate the anniversary here are 10 fun facts you may not know about this ’90s classic.\n\n1Kevin Smith made the film on a shoestring budget funded mostly by the sale of his comic book collection.\n\nEven though this may not come as a shock, the film was incredibly low-budget, and probably a large part of why it is black and white. In addition to his comic book sales, Smith also used credit cards and some insurance money he got for a car he and Jason Mewes lost in a flood? (That seems like a fun story!)\n\n2Kevin Smith’s mom made a cameo.\n\nSmith cast many of his friends in the film, and even had his mom play a character known as Milk Maid.\n\n3Filming was a challenge.\n\nBecause Smith was actually an employee of the convenience store featured in Clerks, he had to work there all day before clocking out and using the place as a set at night. (This is why the shutters are closed and it’s dark all the time.) This called for some very long hours on his part!\n\n4The original ending had Dante being shot dead by a robber.\n\nSmith agreed to cut it after it was considered too “dark.”\n\n5Silent Bob was not entirely silent.\n\nHe had one line, originally meant to be Jay’s, but Jason Mewes was struggling with it so Smith said it instead. It was: “You know, there’s a million fine looking women in the world, dude. But they don’t all bring you lasagna at work. Most of ’em just cheat on you.”\n\n6The film was semi-successful in theaters.\n\nThough it was not critically acclaimed, it did get picked up by Miramax and ended up pulling in $3 million, which was a pretty good profit considering it cost $27,000 to make. Entertainment Weekly listed it as one of the 50 greatest independent films a few years later.\n\n7Jason Reitman was inspired by Clerks to become a filmmaker.\n\nSon of Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman, Jason Reitman, who directed Up in the Air and Young Adult, told Smith Clerks was what inspired him to become a filmmaker.\n\n8The film was originally called Inconvenience.\n\nIt was then changed to Rude Clerks, then Clerks.\n\n9There is an animated series based on the movie.\n\nIt aired for six episodes in 2000, but was not a hit. The two sequels to Clerks also didn’t do well. It was perhaps a film too unique and too timely to be repeated.\n\n10Clerks is loosely based on the narrative poem The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.\n\nThis might explain the name of one of the main characters being Dante. Also there are nine breaks in the movie to represent the rings of hell. Clearly, Smith felt working in a convenience store was a bit like being in hell.\n\nRumor is Kevin Smith is currently writing Jay and Silent Bob 3, meanwhile Clerks is streaming on multiple platforms."
