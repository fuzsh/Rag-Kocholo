        "text": "2. Independent – Clerks.  Clerks themes are tailored to a specific niche audience and made all from one directors ideas. There was no backing from a major studio who had specific needs to be followed.  Some themes seen throughout Clerk are Sex, Drugs, Necrophilia, Relationships, Smoking and the failing of the education system.  These themes are not normally seen in mainstream films because there is certain criteria they have to meet. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  The Force Awakens is a more family friendly film and isn’t as vulgar as Clerks.  Some themes seen throughout Star Wars are War, Death and Love.  Even though these read as adult themes they are presented in a soft way that Disney has developed. Its soft to the eye and suitable for a large audience unlike Clerks. This means the film is appropriate to most ages. THEMES\n\n3. Independent – Clerks.  The mise en scene in Clerks is very simple but has had a lot of thought put into it. Such as the small signs like the one on the till saying “If you plan on shoplifting please tell us”. These are very simple but make the audience laugh.  The costumes in Clerks show they are working class people. You see this from the backwards baseball caps and the non designer shirts.  There film is built up from long takes with static camera angles. the lighting is also very simple and seems to be just using sunlight coming into the store and the lights in the store itself. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  The mise en scene in Star Wars is a lot more complex. There is a mix of short quick clips and also long takes to build more tension. Unlike Clerks there is various angles such as aerial shots and tracking shots.  The scenes are very complex as well in Star Wars and everything is designed to precise detail.  The lighting and colour of a film is very important as it is used to create mood and atmosphere. The positioning of the lighting creates different effects. Most of the trailer is filmed in natural lighting, as it is in the daytime in most of the shots. However it is also filmed in dark lighting as there are shots of space. MISE-EN-SCENE\n\n5. Independent – Clerks.  Kevin uses a lot of long takes in Clerks. An example of this is when Dante is stood behind the till having conversations with customers. This makes the conversation feel more natural and realistic.  The cuts are very basic and there is no complex editing techniques involved unlike in Star Wars. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  Editing tells us about how it changes the pace of the narrative, and the editing narrative used tells us about where the narrative is. Most of the techniques consist of: straight cuts, fades, dissolves, wipes, jump cuts, etc. There is a lot of fading included in order for it to move onto the next key scene rather than straight cutting through it. EDITING\n\n6. Independent – Clerks.  The Clerks sound is very basic and mainly consists of just the characters voices. This is also heard along side basic sounds that objects in the scene our making for example the till opening, store door opening and the bashing of hockey sticks during the hockey game.  There are basic sound effects in the film including a drum roll when Dante is head to head with his opponent and when the ball rolls down the drain in the hockey scene. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  The sound in Force Awakens is very complex. There is a lot to take into consideration during each and every scene.  An example of this is in the fighting scenes where blasters and light sabers are going of and you hear people shouting and screaming.  There is a soundtrack that was made just for the Star Wars franchise and is noticeable to many. SOUND\n\n7. Independent – Clerks.  Clerks was filmed on 16mm B&W film to save money. It was also shot all in 21 days.  Clerks cinematography is very basic and the shots are mainly static shots normally mid or long shots. There is a lack of large scale professional looking shots like in Star Wars because they didn’t have access to the equipment to get these shots.  The hockey scene is the scene where the cinematography is most experimental. There is faster cuts and closer angles shots to show the fast pace and the tension between the who teams. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  The Force Awakens is filmed from many different angles, heights, distances and movements. An example of this is when it starts off from a low horizontal height, and then switches to a high height with an overhead angle, far from the subject.  Many of the shots of the characters are filmed as close-mid shots, and their faces are frequently zoomed in, in order to show the audience who the main characters are.  Because there are so many action shots of the spaceships its filmed from so many different angles, as it shows the explosions and movement of the spaceships .  When there is more action seen in the film there is a larger variety of angles and shots used to create more of an effect through the scene. There is also a lot of panning and tilting the create more of a dramatic effect during the action scenes.  The Force Awakens was shown in Imax cinemas meaning it was filmed at 4K quality. Technology has developed since Clerks was made and allows recording to be done on a larger and cheaper scale. CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\n9.  Budget - $27,575  Kevin Smith (Director) had to source all this money from his own back. He didn’t have a budget given to him by a leading company.  He did this by maxing out 8-10 credit cards at $2,000 limits and selling a large portion of his extensive comic book collection.  He also used money that he been put aside for college education and even used money he had claimed from car insurance. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  Budget - $245,000,000  The Force Awakes was a Disney film so financial backing wasn't an issue here. Because the Star Wars franchise has been so successful and is so popular Disney would have no doubt investing so much money into the film.  The budget is so much larger for this film compared to Clerks because they needed to pay for the well known cast, professional equipment, marketing schemes and distribution. BUDGET Independent – Clerks.\n\n10. Independent – Clerks.  Clerks director Kevin Smith used what was around him to market his film. He was always busy and interacting with people. Weather that was in the video store or at a college gig. This meant he could tell people about the film and it would travel by word of mouth.  Clerks started to be viewed when it was viewed by Bob Hawk at IFFM and he decided to show it at Sundance where it was picked up by Miramax Films.  It was very low key advertising including posters and signs around at the time. Because it was only shown in a small number of cinemas. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  The trailers that they used were what’s called peering trailers. They got people very interested in the movie but they did not disclose much of the content and the storyline, so they were very creative in generating these teaser trailers that got people to the movie theatres.  Unlike Clerks Disney had the budget the promote the film a few years in advanced and build up a large audience before the films even been made.  Disney also produce a lot of merchandise for the films including links with Lego and even making a board game. MARKETING\n\n11.  Clerks Poster.  Star Wars Poster.\n\n12. AUDIENCE TARGETING Independent – Clerks.  For films such as Clerks which are independently produced the target audience tends to be a niche audience.  To find Clerks appealing and enjoyable to watch you have to have a sense of humor and understand the types of humor they are using.  The target audience for Clerks is primarily people in there late teen/early 20s who work minimum wage jobs such as the one seen in the film. Especially the types of jobs which students live of during there times of study’s. It’s a relatable film for those who work in a similar work place or for the older generation looking back on how there work used to be. Clerks makes fun out of the customer service and education systems so its easy for people to relate too. Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens.  The Force Awakens was aimed to be more family friendly and to suit a much wider audience than Clerks to increase maximum income.  It was seen that in the first week of viewing it was mainly men age from 18-49 who bought tickets to see the film with a average of 35 years old.  The Force Awakens wasn’t aimed at one direct audience it was produced to be appealing to a lot more people. There was animation to reach out to children and the action scenes to interest adult males. But its seen that Disney hasn’t tried to aim this film towards adult women at all.\n\n13.  Brian O'Halloran – Dante Hicks  Jeff Anderson – Randal Graves  Silent Bob – Kevin Smith  Marilyn Ghigliotti – Veronica These are all small scale actors that dont have a popular name in the industry and this is there first proper peice of work they’ve appeared on. They would have been payed a minimal amount of money and some even done the acting vollenterally because the budget was just too small. STARDOM  Independent – Clerks.\n\n14.  Harrison Ford – Han Solo  Carrie Fisher – Princess Leia  Mark Hamill – Luke Skywalker  Daisy Ridley – Rey  John Boyega – Finn This is a cast built up from well known famous actors and actress that would have cost millions to get together. Without these key stars, especially the first three in the list the film would’nt have worked and not been as popular as it was. STARDOM  Mainstream – Star Wars Force Awakens."
