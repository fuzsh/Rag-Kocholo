        "text": "We've done it. We've reached the end of the Kevin project and I can't think of a more troubling, confounding possible conclusion than this. One that despite hearing about its premise second-hand was somehow still shocking to actually witness. For those not aware this opens on the wrinkly cast recreating the original Clerks to My Chemical Romance's 'The Black Parade', before having Randal suffer the same heart attack Kevin Smith actually did in real life and kickstarting the ugliest-looking metafictional mid-life crisis therapy movie ever made and ends with Dante dying from an identical heart attack right before our eyes while literally watching the original two films in some sort of ghostly movie theater afterlife. (Made all the more disturbing by the fact that Brian O’Halloran is giving this movie his all, and apparently on tour with it was drunkenly talking about how he wishes he could go back in time and slit his own throat instead of being famous only for this role and having to still reenact images from it 30 years later.) In between all this are a few scenes where the goofy characters you love suffer, cry, scream, and continue to make lame pop culture references even at each other's funerals. Genuinely feels like the kind of movie you make right before you kill yourself. Not good but sort of harrowing and haunting in its badness, and like all great art made me more keenly aware of my own mortality as it went on."
