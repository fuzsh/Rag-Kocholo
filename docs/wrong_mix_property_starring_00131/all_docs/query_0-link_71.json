        "text": "Silent Bob has spoken. Kevin Smith announced on Monday that he plans to host a live reading of his un-produced screenplay for “Clerks III,” a second sequel to his cult, debut film.\n\n“This August – in the great state of New Jersey! Come hear what might have been, when we read the unmade ‘CLERKS III’ script,” the director said on Twitter.\n\nThe event is billed as a script reading with Smith “and friends” and will be held at the First Avenue Playhouse in Atlantic Heights, a town in New Jersey, on Aug. 3, with proceeds going toward restoration of the theater. The First Avenue Playhouse is an 80-seat theater, and tickets cost $100.\n\nSmith is currently at work on his “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,” which is a sequel to a previous spinoff movie of “Clerks” featuring his character alongside Jason Mewes, Jay and Silent Bob. Jay and Silent Bob appeared in both “Clerks” films and would’ve appeared in “Clerks 3.” However, Smith said on a podcast last year that he opted to direct “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot” over “Clerks 3” because one of the film’s original stars, Jeff Anderson, was uninterested in returning for the sequel.\n\nThe original “Clerks” is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. The film stars Brian O’Halloran and Anderson as two lazy, slacker store clerks and follows them on one day in their life as they annoy customers and talk about popular culture.\n\nSmith’s “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot” stars Smith and Mewes and was acquired for North American theatrical release by Saban Films in January."
