        "text": "First came a week of shooting a movie called “Flea,” and then a week of signing autographs at a film fan convention.\n\nOnly then could Brian O’Halloran return and resume rehearsals for Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” at Holmdel Theatre Company.\n\n“They were really nice about working around me,” says the actor, who will forever be known Dante Hicks in Kevin Smith’s “Clerks” and “Clerks II.”\n\nNeedless to say, the salary O’Halloran is getting in Holmdel doesn’t compare to what he has been making in Hollywood.\n\n“Although my bank account and wallet loves film,” he says, “theater is so much better. In film, you might like what you did in take three, but it won’t necessarily make the final movie. Maybe the director liked take five because the background was in focus. Theater is the real actor’s medium.”\n\nIn “The Crucible,” O’Halloran finds himself in 1692 Salem, Mass., as the Rev. Parris. “One night he finds that his daughter and niece are nowhere to be found,” says O’Halloran. “When he goes out and finds them dancing naked, he’s none too pleased.”\n\nO’Halloran stops to laugh. “Funny; from ‘Clerks,’ I’ve become known for male debauch comedies. I’ve been given that label of sassy and comedic. The thing is, I’m 40 now and old enough to be playing fathers who get outraged.”\n\nIf there’s one thing that O’Halloran understands, it’s parental disapproval. “My parents both came to American from Ireland, so they were conservative people,” he says. “My father died when I was a teenager, so my mother had a very cautious view of life. Imagine how she flipped out when I quit my job in the early ’90s to act. I had spent years working at ShopRite, clearing over $500 a week, which was a lot of money in those days. As she always pointed out, a grocery store will always be in business no matter what happens.”\n\nHence the litany that many an actor hears. O’Halloran can still cite chapter and verse: “ ‘Why are you doing this silliness? Why are you acting in this movie that you aren’t getting paid for? And why are you going to Utah for — what is it, a film festival?’ ”\n\nOnce Mrs. O’Halloran saw “Clerks,” she wasn’t swayed. “When I showed her a VHS and we got to the raunchy parts, I had to tell her that I really didn’t understand what I was saying; I’d just memorized the words. I even told her, ‘Mom, we made it in black and white because we know you like old movies.’ ”\n\nNot until “Clerks” won a Sundance Film Festival prize and O’Halloran was acclaimed did his mother join the bandwagon of fans. Yet the success hasn’t gone to his head; he can’t be accused of going Hollywood and forgetting his Old Bridge roots. Although he now lives on Staten Island, he’s kept many of his Jersey friends from when he was toiling in community theaters as the First Avenue Playhouse in Atlantic Highlands and the Center Players in Freehold.\n\n“I still do community theater if there’s a director I love working with or a role I’ve always wanted to do,” he says. “Here at Holmdel I’ve known the producer, Rebecca Harris Flynn, for many years, and I worked with the director Lea Eckert at New Jersey Rep in Long Branch.”\n\nEckert’s staging was not the only reason O’Halloran got involved.\n\n“Holmdel Theatre Company has a distinctive mentoring program,” he says. “They bring in students, and we tell them what we’ve learned from experience. When I started, I wish I had someone who could come over and tell me, ‘Hey, here’s the way it is — both good and bad.’ I might not have spent so many years at ShopRite.”\n\nThe Crucible\n\nWhere: Holmdel Theatre Company, 36 Crawfords Corner Road, Holmdel\n\nWhen: Through July 31. Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m.\n\nHow much: $20 ($15 for seniors, $10 for students). Call (732) 946-0427 or visit holmdeltheatre company.org."
