Hitcher represented artists such as Kaytranada, Run the Jewels, Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Migos, Birdman, Nicki Minaj, Tim Armstrong of Rancid, andmost notably, Prince. He also represented independent music publishers / record labels Cash Money/Money Mack, 300 Entertainment, NPG, Parlophone, along with consulting for major labels. PULSE, an independent music publisher with several Grammy-nominated hits including “Havana” by Camila Cabello and “Girls Like You” by Maroon 5, purchased Hitcher and tapped Joe to Head of Creative Sync Licensing/A&R.\n\nAs partner at PULSE and Head of Creative Sync/A&R, Joe placed top-tier music producers and songwriters behind the Billboard hits performed by Drake, Nicki Minaj, Migos, Travis Scott, Rhianna, Run the Jewels, Ty Dolla $ign, Maroon 5, Cordae in countless films and series including featured placements in Black-ish, Empire, Power, Insecure, Grey’s Anatomy, Billions, This is Us, Fast and Furious 8, Atlanta, and Euphoria, as well as countless gaming & advertising campaigns.

In 2020, PULSE was acquired as a joint venture by the Concord Music Group, in a highly publicized deal. Joe left the company to pursue independent music supervision and consulting, as well as other film-music related activities. Joe’s intrinsic passion for music in media and deep relationships with artists, songwriters, music producers, managers, record labels, music publishers, and the broader film and television community make him an invaluable creative collaborator.\n\nJoe is a native-born Latino from El Paso, TX who recently relocated to Austin, TX from Los Angeles with his family."
