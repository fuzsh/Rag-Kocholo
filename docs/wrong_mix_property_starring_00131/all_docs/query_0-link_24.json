        "text": "Vanity Fair has shared the first official image for the set of Clerks III, which is currently in production in Leonardo, New Jersey; the same town where the original film was made in 1993. Lionsgate has acquired worldwide rights.\n\nSmith has ofcourse written the screenplay and will direct, with all major cast members set to reprise their roles Jeff Anderson as Randal, Brian O’Halloran as Dante, Jay Mewes as Jay, Smith as Silent Bob, and Rosario Dawson as Becky. The film is produced by Liz Destro and Jordan Monsanto.\n\n“There’s a saying from the Tao that goes something like ‘To be great is to go on. To go on is to go far. To go far is to return.’ Thanks to Lionsgate, we get to return to where it all started with almost the whole cast that started it all! And for the first time since the first time we ever made a movie in 1993, we’re shooting the entire flick on location in New Jersey, as an ode to both the enduring allure of cinema and the resourcefulness and lunacy of its storytellers. Years ago, Dante and Randal made me a filmmaker – so now it’s time I return the favour.\n\nKevin Smith\n\nThis is a new version of the script after a previous version from six years ago was scrapped due to a variety of issues. Smith announced in October 2019 that he was working on a new script as well as announcing lead actor Jeff Anderson (Randal) was back on-board. He held script readings of the original Clerks 3 script previously in New Jersey.\n\nKevin Smith documentary ‘ Clerk’gets release date.\n\nClerks III begins production\n\nNew film book ‘Kevin Smith’s Secret Stash: The Definitive Visual History’ details announced\n\nArrow Video announce MallRats (Limited Edition) BluRay\n\nOrder Clerks from Amazon"
