        "text": "“Headlined with a true Breakout Performance by Award-Winner Kevin Interdonato, and featuring electric support from Amanda Clayton (Bleed For This), Tom Sizemore (Showtime’s Twin Peaks, Saving Private Ryan, HEAT), Brian O’Halloran (Clerks 1 & 2), and boxing icon Ray ‘Boom-Boom’ Mancini, Bad Frank has become a majorly sought after Film this year, and acquired by heavyweight Foreign Rep, Lotus Entertainment.\n\nFrank Pierce (played by Interdonato) leads a seemingly normal life, but when a disturbing past re emerges and something precious is taken from him, his mask of sanity loosens and unearths the urge to be violent once again.”\n\nI wasn’t exactly sure what I was expecting when I went into Bad Frank. It was definitely an intriguing sell, and definitely seemed worth the watch. For one, I always try to make an effort to see everything that Brian O’Halloran ever works on. Even if the part turns out to be minimal and underwhelming, he always does it so damn well. Such is the case in Bad Frank. And the addition of the legendary bad ass Tom Sizemore definitely jumped at me and made me think, “Alright, let’s see what this is about.” And dammit if I am not enthralled that I gave it a shot.\n\nBad Frank is a brilliant indie blood darling of a film. It is a brilliant tale about how the demons inside of us are sometimes impossible to sustain, and that the past is always there to haunt us even if we attempt to avoid any acknowledgement of its presence. Kevin Interdonato gives a truly gut-wrenching performance as the lead man, and is definitely a force of nature that we should all be looking out for. And Lynn Mancinelli was a sleeper act that really brought the whole thing together. And dammit if legendary Ray ‘Boom Boom’ Mancini didn’t pull of a brilliant performance that he seemed to be born to do. Also as I already mentioned, we had the great Brian O’Halloran and his continuous brilliance.\n\nOverall Bad Frank is a deeply disturbing story told extremely well with a cast that is top shelf. It is also a film that will leave you with a few “What If’s” on your mind. Especially, “what if they just had more money?”. I know I ended the film thinking just this. I was left with two thoughts: 1.) It is amazing what a talented filmmaker like Tony Germinario can pull off on what appeared to be a shoestring budget, and I want to know more about him, and 2.) It is plain sickening that more brilliant ideas like this aren’t being given the fair treatment they deserve. For every god damned Marvel movie that comes out every year, 50 brilliant films like Bad Frank could be coming out. But, that isn’t the way the cinema world works I’m afraid. No matter the budget though, there was nothing stopping me from enjoying Bad Frank for exactly what it is, a damn good story featuring damn good actors.\n\nCheck out this trailer for Bad Frank, available NOW on VOD:"
